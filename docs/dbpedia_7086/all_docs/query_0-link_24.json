        "text": "Tomb of Richard the Lionheart in Fontevraud Abbey, Loire Valley , France. Photo source: https://www.historyextra.com/\n\nRichard I (8th September 1157 – 6th April 1199) was King of England from 1189 until his death in 1199. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus and Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, and seemed unlikely to become King, but all his brothers except the youngest, John, predeceased their father. Richard is known as Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.\n\nBy the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father. Richard was an important Christian commander during the Third Crusade, leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and achieving considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, although he finalized a peace treaty and ended the campaign without retaking Jerusalem.\n\nRichard was born in England, where he spent his childhood. Before becoming King, however, he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine, in the southwest of France. Following his accession, he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England. Most of his life as King was spent on Crusade, in captivity (he was captured shortly before Christmas 1192 near Vienna by Leopold of Austria and was famously ransommed off) or actively defending his lands in France. Rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler, he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies. Nevertheless, he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects. He remains one of the few kings of England remembered more commonly by his epithet than his regnal number, and is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France.\n\nAs we saw with King John, the second Great Seal of Richard I (1195) shows him bearing a shield depicting three lions passant guardant. This is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon, which later became established as the Royal Arms of England. It is likely, therefore, that Richard introduced this heraldic design. In his earlier Great Seal of 1189, he had used either one lion rampant or what many believe to depict two lions rampant combatant, Arms which he may have adopted from his father.\n\nSecond Great Seal of Richard I. Vintage Print from 1845. Photo source: https://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/\n\nRichard added the third Lion on his second Great Seal (sometime between May 21st and Michaelmas in 1195) as shown by Exchequer accounts or 'Pipe Rolls'. This was to reinforce his position on his return from captivity on the Continent during which time this brother John had tried to launch a rebellion against Richard's regents. Also, by creating a new Great Seal, Richard was able to raise funds from charging to renew old charters under the old Seal. This is believed to have caused a delay in implementing the new Seal until the Spring of 1198.\n\nThe coat of three Lions continues to represent England on several coins, forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (such as the England national football team and the team's \"Three Lions\" anthem) and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.\n\n​More interesting for Richard heraldically was his first Great Seal. ​\n\nHis Seal shows Richard on horseback, galloping to the right, as shown in the photograph here. His Shield is heavily curved and only shows one half bearing a complete Lion rampant towards the sinister (i.e. the left, according to the Shield-Bearer). Lions are usually shown rampant to the dexter unless it is face-to-face with another Lion on the other half of the Shield which, in this instance, is not shown. Equally, a boss is shown on the profile of the Shield, implying that there is another side the Shield and that the one Lion isn't just squashed into the visible half. If this Lion is not to be taken as an anomaly, Richard's Coat of Arms would only be heraldically correct as Two Lions combatant.\n\nThis idea may appear to be supported by both an eyewitness account of Richard's saddle from the Itinerary of Richard I whilst on Crusade in 1191 and by the poet William the Breton (although he wrote 30 years later). However, other contemporary examples would argue against this and simply reflect artistic license.\n\nReverse of the First Great Seal of King Richard I of England, exhibited in History Museum of Vendée - Les Lucs-sur-Boulogne, Vendée, France. Photo source: Wikipedia/Selbymay.\n\nEven Lions passant (walking) are shown fully within the visible half of the Shield. This includes Richard's three Lions and King John's two as Lord of Ireland. Both the 1171 Seal of Philip d'Alsace, Count of Flanders and Patrick, 6th Earl of Dunbar roughly a century later show a whole Lion rampant within the visible half of the Shield on the equestrian figure on the reverse side but show a whole shield and still just one rampant Lion on the obverse side. On both of Richard's Great Seals, the obverse side simply shows Richard enthroned with symbols of suns, moons, stars and what look like representations of Planta Genista, the broom plant Badge of the Plantagenet Dynasty. There are no other Shields to make a comparison.\n\nEither way, the Shield carried by a king of England in the equestrian figure on the Seal was shown facing away from the viewer up until Richard's father, King Henry II. It therefore cannot be used to confirm anything other than that heraldic devises of any significance were not carried on the front of the Shield. otherwise they would have been shown.\n\nThere is an argument that two Lions back-to-back (or addorsed) were more common at that time and, hence, would have lead to more ambiguity for heraldists then. There is more evidence that, at the time of the beginnings of what we now know as heraldry, heraldic beasts could be portrayed facing either way and this shown with the same Coat of Arms in what we would nowadays effectively consider as inconsistency. The saddle described in the Itinerary may simply have shown decoration rather than anything heraldic.\n\nThat both his uncle, William FitxEmpress, and his half-brother, William Longespée, used a single Lion rampant and that an upright single Lion would have fitted better onto Shields and the tall, upright banners of the time - one such description, from the Itinerary, clearly states a single Lion on Richard's banner (ad regium cum leone ​vexillum) which agrees with a description in the the account of the Third Crusade by Ambrose - clearly suggest that it is highly unlikely that Richard bore anything other than one Lion rampant until his second Great Seal of 1189/95.\n\nThe question, therefore, is where did Richard get the Arms of two Lions passant to add the third Lion to...?\n\nThe Coat of Arms and Flag of Normandy famously show two golden Lions passant on red. Whilst the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey have changed to three Lions, Sark retains the two - The Channel Islands used to be part of Normandy. This Coat of Arms, and even the three Lions, have been erroneously attributed to King William I of England (The Conqueror). Erroneously, because heraldry as we know it didn't exist then.\n\nLions, very much in general at that stage, appear to have been used by the descendants of King Henry I of England, a younger son of The Conqueror. Henry's son-in-law, Geoffrey of Anjou, is probably one of the first people to have adopted a inheritable Coat of Arms showing not only a Lion but a number of Lions (six to be specific). Having lost his only son William in the sinking of the White Ship, Henry was keen to keep in with Geoffrey, the husband of Henry's only other child, Maud, especially as he needed a grandson as heir. (Women, though often instrumental in the order of succession, were generally not looked upon favourably to take on sovereignty in those dark days.)\n\n​Within a few years of Henry I's death he was being described as the 'Lion of Justice' and his (illegitimate) sons 'the cubs of the lion'. He is known to have kept lions and leopards in his menagerie at Woodstock. All of these would only go to show Henry's association with Lions as a symbol.\n\nHenry's nephew and successor, Stephen, has been with attributed one or three Sagittaries (half man, half horse - with or without a bow and arrow) as he ascended the Throne under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and also with the help of archers. These are purely conjecture from later generations. A royal Banner is known to have existed, but unfortunately, although recorded as closely guarded, no contemporary detailed description exists.\n\nAnd so we come to Richard and John's father King Henry II. Grandson of Henry I through the Maud who had been sidestepped earlier, he is certainly described as carrying Arms but, again, no detailed description exists and, as mentioned, his Shield on his Seal still faces away. His father, brother, sons even, chamberlains and attendants are all known to have used Lions in one way or another, and Henry II was again associated with or variously described as a 'lion', like his grandfather. Henry II looked more to his royal and ducal inheritance through his mother and the grandfather after whom he was named, rather than his father, however capable a person Geoffrey of Anjou was.\n\nUnfortunately, the two Lions of Normandy did not become fixed until centuries after Henry II and the idea that men whom Henry II knighted used two Lions according to the practise of 'patron-in-chivalry' cannot be used to fully justify Henry's use. However, the use of the two Lions, amongst other devices, by so many men closely associated with Henry II, including, after the death of his eldest son, Henry the Young King, his favourite son John, might have meant that Richard wanted to trump them by swapping from one Lion to three!\n\n​\n\nBerengaria of Navarre\n\nBefore leaving Cyprus on crusade, Richard married Berengaria, the first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre. Richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native Navarre. The wedding was held in Limassol on 12th May 1191 at the Chapel of St George and was attended by Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour. Many feasts and entertainments, public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event. When Richard married Berengaria he was still officially betrothed to Alys, the daughter of Louis VII of France, and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the Kingdom of Navarre as a fief, as Aquitaine had been for his father. Further, Eleanor championed the match with Berengaria, as Navarre bordered Aquitaine, thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands. Richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly, though they returned separately. Berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did, and she did not see England until after his death. After his release from German captivity, Richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct, but he was not reunited with his wife. The marriage remained childless.\n\nBy the 15th century, the mythology of the Coat of Arms would trace its origin back to the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 involving Berengaria's brother, Sancho VII, where the cavalry broke the chains of the caliph's slave-warriors and captured an emerald, among other prizes.\n\nThey may equally be a development of Berengaria's or, rather, her father's Arms - a change of colours, etc - as the white Cross pommy on blue does resemble a simplified carbuncle as well.\n\nA portrait of King John hunting (England, 14th century): British Library, Cotton MS Claudius D II, f. 11r. Photo source: https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/index.html\n\nJohn (24th December 1166 – 19th October 1216) was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands. However, he also lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian Dynasty during the 13th century. He became his father's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173–74 by his brothers Henry the Young King, Richard and Geoffrey. John was appointed Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent and unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion himself against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard I, whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but was still proclaimed King after Richard died in 1199. He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise personal possession of the continental Angevin lands at the Peace Treaty of Le Goulet in 1200.\n\nWhen war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton, and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. He spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. His judicial reforms had a lasting effect on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute he finally settled in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed because of the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis VIII of France, which soon descended into stalemate. John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year.\n\nContemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the current historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\". Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", such as pettiness, spitefulness, and cruelty.\n\nWith John, before and after his accession to the Throne, we come to an interesting period in the development of the Coat of Arms of England and the distinctive three gold Lions on a red background. Some would conjecture that it was John's rebellious nature towards his elder brother which lead to the 'upgrade'.\n\nLions had already been emblems of kings and higher nobility for many years. King Richard I was, of course, nicknamed 'The Lionheart'. Advances in armour, such as the barrel helmet, were making identification in battle more important and more problematic during the 12th century and so a more organised system of what became heraldry became more important than just 'emblems'. Whilst the dragon banner had long been associated with England, the use of Lions was becoming more popular within Continental Europe and the family and allies of the Normans. Two gold Lions on red have been the Arms of Normandy for many centuries now. They were attributed to William the Conqueror, Richard and John's notable ancestor, and it is conjectured that their father, King Henry II, took these two Lions and added the single Aquetaine Lion of his wife Eleanor to make up the now distinctive Shield of England. This, however, is all conjecture.\n\nJohn had opposed the men Richard had appointed as regents in his absence on his Crusade, and had rebelled. On the Lionheart's return a number of other things happened. Firstly, Richard reconciled himself with John and appointed him his heir in place of their nephew Arthur. This may have been to ensure more control over John as Richard also confiscated his lands. Richard also went through a second Coronation on 17th April 1194, some say to to nullify the shame of his captivity whilst on Crusade when he was handed over to Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI and ransommed off. Some say it was to ensure he was the recognised ruler of the Kingdom.\n\nTwo Lions passant (i.e. walking) were associated with King Henry II, whether they were guardant (looking out) or not. They were certainly John's Arms as Prince and Lord of Ireland, and also associated with his rebel supporters, especially in the period 1194 and 1195. It was therefore not enough for Richard just to inherit his father's Arms, but a necessity to build on them to again emphasise his position. King Richard I's second Great Seal, produced sometime between May and Michaelmas 1195, shows the first evidence of the change to three Lions.\n\nIn turn, when Richard died in 1199, John had a choice. Up until then, succession to the English Throne had been no easy matter. Since the Conquest, William II and Richard I had been the only Anglo-Norman Kings who had directly succeeded their fathers. This instability may well have been reflected in the ruling house's late adaptation of a single, hereditary Shield, in comparison, for instance, with France. Thus, John's adoption of his brother's three Lions, whilst not a foregone conclusion, was a wise move in indicating he had come into his elder brother's full inheritance.\n\n​The rest, as they say, is history...\n\nJohn's tomb (the oldest royal effigy in England) in Worcester Cathedral (shown here in photographs from the author's personal collection) shows the English Arms on its stone plinth. However, this plinth was a later addition, made in the 16th century at the same time as the nearby magnificent monuments to Prince Arthur, Prince of Wales, brother of King Henry VIII..\n\nJohn was not a lucky King, as we have seen. Legend has it that he lost the Crown Jewels in The Wash - a bay and estuary in eastern England known to be surrounded by low-lying marshy land and riddled with quicksand - whilst on his last campaign when he was already fatally ill. Some say, however, that only a few pack-horses were lost, and the exact location has never been confirmed.\n\nHe remains the only English/British King of that name, not helped by the fact that John Baliol, King of Scotland a little while later, is thought of as a largely ineffectual King. Only two other members of the British Royal Family have been given the name - HRH Prince Alexander John of Wales (youngest son of the later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) and HRH The Prince John (youngest son of Alexander John's elder brother King George V and Queen Mary). Alexander John was born prematurely in 1871 and died 24 hours later. Prince John is famous as the 'Lost Prince'. He was epileptic and was kept from the public eye at Sandringham until he died after a severe seizure in 1916 at the age of only 13. His illness was disclosed to the wider public only after his death.\n\n​\n\nIsabella of Angoulême\n\nJohn's first marriage, to heiress Isabella of Gloucester, had been annulled shortly prior to his accession due to consanguinity. She was also a descendant of Henry I, although her grandfather was that King's illegitimate son. The marriage was doomed as, despite his father making Isabella sole heiress to the Gloucester lands, John lost them on the annulment.\n\nJohn soon became infatuated with another Isabella, Isabella of Angoulême (c. 1186/1188 – 4th June 1246). She became Countess of Angoulême in 1202, a couple of years after marriage at about 12 or 14 years of age and her elaborate Coronation in Westminster Abbey on 8th October 1200. However, she had been betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan, and, a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued.\n\n​John was really living up to his nickname by now!\n\nCoat of Arms of Isabella of Angoulême, Queen Consort and second wife of King John. Author: Wikipedia/Jacques63\n\nRumours abounded that John was so infatuated that he would stay in bed till noon and Isabella was described as 'more Jezebel than Isabel' by her harsher critics. Notwithstanding the criticism, John and Isabella had five children, all of whom survived into adulthood. When John died in October 1216, Isabella's first act was to arrange the speedy Coronation of her nine-year-old son, Henry, at Gloucester on 28th October. As the Crown Jewels had supposedly recently been lost in The Wash, Isabella supplied her own golden circlet to be used instead.\n\nIn the Spring of 1220, Isabella married Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children. Hugh was the son of her former fiancé and was actually promised to Isabella's daughter Joan. The mother still retained the beauty which had entranced John and so Joan was promised to the King of Scotland. Unfortunately, Isabella did not seek permission from the King's Council to re-marry and so, like her first husband, had lands and her pension as Queen Dowager taken off her.\n\nIsabella was possessed of a fiery temper, which had been the equal of her first husband, but meant she didn't take kindly to being a virtually penniless countess in France. Some of Isabella's contemporaries, as well as later writers, claim that she formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France in 1241, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile, for whom she had a deep-seated hatred. In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the King when two cooks confessed to having been in Isabella's pay. To avoid arrest, she sought refuge in Fontevraud Abbey, where she died two years later.\n\n​\n\nIsablla's family Arms - Lozengy or and gueles - are shown on the tomb of her son by her second husband, William de Valance, Earl of Pembroke in Westminster Abbey.\n\n​\n\nRichard, Earl of Cornwall\n\nRichard (5th or 6th January 1209 – 2nd April 1272) was the second son of King John and Isabella. He was created Earl of Cornwall on 30th May 1227.\n\nBetween then and 1238 he frequently opposed his brother, King Henry III, by joining the barons in several crises. However, he never proceeded to rebellion but always made Henry pay heavily for reconciliation. He took the cross in 1236 and led a small English force to the Holy Land from June 1240 to January 1242, refortifying Ascalon and negotiating an advantageous treaty. During Henry III’s disastrous Poitevin campaign in France in 1242, Richard’s prompt retreat at Saintes and his persuasive diplomacy at Taillebourg saved Henry from capture. While acting regent of England during Henry’s Gascon visit (1253–54), Richard summoned knights to represent the shires at the critical Easter Parliament of 1254. Reputedly the richest magnate in England, he refused Pope Innocent IV’s offer of the Sicilian crown (1252–53), saying, according to Matthew Paris, “You might as well say, ‘I make you a present of the moon - step up to the sky and take it down’.” Instead, his brother King Henry purchased the kingdom for his own son Edmund. Richard accepted imperial candidature in 1256. Purchasing four of the seven electoral votes, Richard was elected King of the Romans and was crowned at Aachen on 17th May 1257. By lavish bribery he gained recognition throughout the Rhineland, returning home in January 1259.\n\nRichard helped Henry to overthrow the Provisions of Oxford, but from June to October 1260 he again visited Germany, then discovering the impossibility of his hopes of the imperial crown.\n\nHe again helped Henry invaluably against the rebel barons (1263–64) but was captured at Lewes on 14th May 1264 and was imprisoned at Wallingford and then at Kenilworth until the overthrow of Simon de Montfort at Evesham on 4th August 1265. He then worked ceaselessly to obtain the relatively moderate settlement of the Dictum of Kenilworth on 31st October 1266. His fourth and last visit to Germany from August 1268 to August 1269 is notable only for his third marriage, to Beatrice of Falkenburg.\n\nRichard's claims to Gascony and Poitou were never more than nominal, and in 1241 King Louis IX of France invested his own brother Alphonse with Poitou. Richard and Henry were encouraged to recover Poitou by their stepfather, Hugh X of Lusignan, but the expedition turned into a military fiasco after Hugh betrayed them. Having said that, Richard did not take on a version of the English Arms but those of Poitou, namely:\n\nArgent, a Lion rampant gules within a Bordure sable bezanty.\n\nIt is argued that these Arms represent both Poitou and Cornwall with the red Lion going back to William FitzEmpress who had also been a Count Poitou and the Bezants on black already representing Cornwall and, quite bizarrely, their propensity for being the most enterprising and prosperous merchants and pawnbrokers in all England, the symbol of the association of pawnbrokers being fifteen gold balls!\n\nIt is also argued that they are 15 gold coins to represent a ransom paid to the Saracens to release Richard from captivity.\n\nHowever, James Planché (Somerset Herald in the 18th century) discovered a neglected manuscript later called the Planché Roll after him which showed that the Bezants (the golden balls) originated in Poitou and not the other way round. In reality, they represented golden peas (pois in French) and were so a pun on the name Poitou. The Arms of Cornwall were actually designed in the 15th century, based on Richard's Arms.\n\nWhen he was elected and crowned King of the Romans, he placed his Poitou Arms as a dynastic Inescutcheon onto the breast of the Imperial Eagle.\n\nThe Poitou/Cornwall Arms were used by Richard's surviving son, Edmund, by his second wife (Sanchia of Provence) as second Earl. Edmund, however, died with no issue and so Edmund's entire estate passed to the Crown, excepting a dower for his widow, Margaret, sister of Gilbert de Clare."
