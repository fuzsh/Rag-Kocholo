        "text": "Madeleine of France, also called Magdalena de Valois (December 1, 1443 – January 21, 1495), was a French Princess who became Princess of Viana by marriage to Gaston of Foix. She was the Regent of Navarre between 1479 and 1494 during the minority of her two children, each of whom became monarchs of Navarre: King François I and Queen Catherine I.\n\nLife\n\nShe was born at Tours, a younger daughter of King Charles VII of France and Marie of Anjou, the eldest daughter of Louis II, Duke of Anjou, claimant to the throne of Naples, and Infanta Yolande of Aragon, claimant to the throne of Aragon, the eldest daughter of King Juan I of Aragon by his second wife, Yolande of Bar, the granddaughter of King Jean II of France.\n\nMagdalena was betrothed to Ladislaus the Posthumous, but he died suddenly in Prague on November 23, 1457 while preparing for his marriage. Ladislaus the Posthumous was also Ladislaus V, Duke of Austria and King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. He was the posthumous son of Albrecht of Habsburg (King Albrecht II of the Romans and Germany) with Elizabeth of Luxembourg.\n\nIt was rumored at the time that his political opponents in Bohemia had poisoned Ladislaus the Posthumous; but in the 20th century it was proved that Ladislaus died of leukemia, not a recognized disease in that period.\n\nMagdalena de Valois instead married Gaston de Foix, Prince of Viana, son and heir of Gaston IV of Foix and Infanta Eleanor of Navarre, at Saint-Jean-d’Angély in 1461.\n\nRegent of Navarre\n\nHer husband died in 1470, predeceasing his father; accordingly, when Gaston IV died in 1472, his possessions were inherited by Magdalena’s son, Prince François Phoebus. Prince François became the heir of Navarre in 1479 upon the death of his great-grandfather, King Juan II of Aragon and Navarre, who left Navarre to the rightful heir, Magdalena’s mother-in-law, Infanta Eleanor. Eleanor only spent a few weeks as Queen before she herself died.\n\nPrince François Phoebus became King of Navarre, and his mother acted as Regent until his death, at age 17, in 1483. Magdalena continued her Regency, then for her daughter, Queen Catherine I of Navarre, until 1494. During this Regency, she was forced to battle her brother-in-law, Jean of Foix, who claimed the throne of Navarre as heir male of King François Phoebus.\n\nIn 1483, she arranged for her daughter to be married to a French nobleman on the suggestion of King Charles VIII of France and refused the match with Infante Juan, Prince of Asturias, the heir to the throne of Castile and Aragon, in order to protect Navarre from being united with Castile and Aragon by a French alliance.\n\nThe marital contract was signed in 1484 and the wedding of her daughter to Louis of Beaumont (c. 1430 – 1508) 2nd Count of Lerín a noble in the Kingdom of Navarre, took place in 1486. Her daughter’s marriage does not to have been consummated until 1491.\n\nIt is possible that the consummation, being a political event, was purposely postponed in order to prevent Catherine and her husband being declared of legal majority, which would allow Magdalena to continue her regency. Magdalena continued to act as regent despite the fact that her daughter had given birth in 1491 and her marriage had clearly been consummated and, at the age of twenty-three, should no longer have the need of a minor regency.\n\nHer continued Regency even after her daughter’s coronation in 1494 is clearly evidenced, as it is documented that she continued to sign charters and be mentioned first officially as regent despite her daughter and son-in-law being adults.\n\nMagdalena was taken hostage by King Fernando II of Aragon in 1494. This ended her Regency of Navarre and her daughter and son-in-law are confirmed to have been active rulers from this time onward. She died in the following year at Pamplona; her death provoked fresh conflict.\n\nWith the death of Charles VIII of France (Magdalena’s nephew), the descendants of Charles VI of France ceased to occupy the French throne.\n\nBy the death of Anne de Valois of France, Magdalena’s niece, along with that of her elder sister Yolande, Duchess of Savoy, became the last surviving legitimate descents from King Charles VII of France. Her descendant and heir, King Henri III of Navarre, would become King Henri IV of France and Navarre in 1589, returning the descent and heirs of King Charles VI and King Charles VII to the French throne.\n\nAntoine de Bourbon, (jure uxoris) King of Navarre (April 22, 1518 – November 17, 1562)\n\nAntoine was born at La Fère, Picardy, France, the second son of Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme (1489–1537), and his wife, Françoise d’Alençon (died 1550). He was the older brother of Louis, Prince of Condé (1530–1569), who would lead the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion.\n\nAntoine found himself in a disadvantageous position in the court of King Henri II of France due to the disgrace that had befallen his house after the defection of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon to Emperor Charles V in 1523.\n\nOn October 20, 1548, at Moulins, Antoine married Jeanne d’Albret, the daughter of King Henri II of Navarre and his wife Marguerite de Navarre. After his father-in-law’s death in May 1555, Antoine was able to secure the kingship of Navarre through jure uxoris (by right of his wife) and he became King of Navarre, Count of Foix, of Bigorre, of Armagnac, of Périgord, and Viscount of Béarn. It was reported that Jeanne was much in love with him. His reconversion to Catholicism separated him from his wife and he threatened to repudiate her.\n\nIn the same year, 1555, the critical border governorship of Picardy was removed from him and given to Admiral Coligny arousing significant protest. However, he was bought off with the rich southern governorship of Guyenne. In 1556, upon hearing that Jacques, Duke of Nemours had made his cousin-by-marriage pregnant, he threatened bloody consequences for Savoie and his family, causing the man to take the excuse of a campaign into Italy to leave France.\n\nIn February 1557, Antoine, Jeanne and their son Henri travelled to the French court in Paris; while there Henri suggested a betrothal between his daughter Margaret and Henri. Desiring to reverse the Spanish occupation of much of his kingdom, he entered into negotiations with Emperor Charles V; however these went nowhere and compromised his position at court still further. Navarre demonstrated early sympathy towards the reformation.\n\nIn 1558 he attended the psalm singing at the Pré-aux-Clercs to the considerable fury of Henri. He fought for the crown in the last stage of the Italian wars in 1558. The Huguenot leadership were animated by the prospect of bringing Navarre into their camp causing Calvin and Beza to devote considerable efforts to the project.\n\nWhen in 1559 King Henri II of France died, and was succeeded by his eldest son as King François II of France. Opponents of the Guise Family, including Anne de Montmorency flocked to meet Navarre in Vendôme hoping he would establish himself in the government. The Guise were however able to neutralise him by buying him off with the governorship of Poitou and sent him off to escort Elisabeth of Valois to the Spanish border.\n\nTo further isolate Antoine of Navarre, Louis, Prince de Condé and the house of Bourbon-Vendôme, the Guise created two super governorships, giving them to their cousins Charles, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon and Louis, Duke of Montpensier, separating the princes of blood from each other. On August 31, the Guise wrote Navarre they had 40,000 troops ready to move into the south, and to present themselves at court. Navarre and Condé, possessing only around 6000 foot, were unable to resist, and came north without a fight. Upon their arrival Condė was detained and sentenced.\n\nIn December 1560 the young King François II died and was succeeded by his brother as King Charles IX of France. Charles, being too young to rule, required a regent, a position Antoine was entitled to as first prince of the blood. His mother, Catherine de Medici, however possessed considerable leverage over him due to the imprisonment of his brother Louis for treason. The two agreed that in exchange for Catherine being regent while Navarre would become Lieutenant General of the kingdom and Condé would be brought back into favour.\n\nCollapse of the regency\n\nAntoine found himself increasingly in opposition to the religious policy of Catherine’s administration, finally breaking with her concerning the Edict of Saint-Germain, writing urgently to Guise to return to court so they could present a united front against the edict. On his way to Paris, Guise’s men committed the Massacre of Vassy, plunging France into civil war. Navarre in his role as Lieutenant General would be the supreme commander of the crown’s forces in the coming conflict.\n\nFirst French War of Religion\n\nIn May he issued a decree expelling all Protestants from Paris, much to the delight of radicals in the capital. His army and that of Condé faced off against each other in June near Orléans. The sides only came to light skirmishing however, as negotiations between the sides to avoid bloodshed continued.\n\nWith Louis, Prince de Condé now retreating, Antoine of Navarre and the other leaders began retaking rebel towns, capturing Blois, Tours and Amboise. In August the main royal force under Navarre besieged and overcame the rebel garrison in the key town of Bourges. When his wife, Jeanne d’Albret, allowed the Huguenots to sack the chapel and the churches of Vendôme, he threatened to send her to a convent.\n\nHaving reduced Bourges the royal army was faced with a choice, to march on the Huguenot capital of Orléans immediately, or first strike at the northern town of Rouen, which Aumale was currently unsuccessfully trying to besiege with his small force. Navarre counselled immediately pushing on Orlėans, but the plague in the town, the threat of the English and the hopes of Catherine that he might yet prevail on his brother to abandon rebellion persuaded the court against this policy.\n\nNavarre’s army invested the city of Rouen on September 28, and began trying to reduce the town. On October 13 while inspecting the trenches of the Siege of Rouen, Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre was mortally wounded by a musket shot to the shoulder. Despite the efforts of the famed surgeon Ambroise Paré he could not be saved, and died of his wounds on November 17, 1562.\n\nIt was rumoured that his last rites were taken in the Lutheran custom, compounding long-held suspicions of his religious unorthodoxy.\n\nAntoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre was the father of King Henri IV of France and Navarre.\n\nOn this date in History: Henri IV was crowned King of France at the Cathedral of Chartres on February 27, 1594.\n\nHenri IV (December 13, 1553 – May 14, 1610), also known by the epithet “Good King Henry”, was King of Navarre (as Henri III) from 1572 to 1610 and King of France from 1589 to 1610. He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, another branch of the Capetian dynasty (through Louis IX, as the previous House of Valois had been through Philippe II). He was assassinated in 1610 by François Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII.\n\nHenri was born in Pau, the capital of the joint Kingdom of Navarre with the sovereign principality of Béarn. His parents were Queen Joan III of Navarre (Jeanne d’Albret) and her consort, Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme. Although baptised as a Roman Catholic, Henri was raised as a Protestant by his mother, who had declared Calvinism the religion of Navarre. As a teenager, Henri joined the Huguenot forces in the French Wars of Religion. On June 9, 1572, upon his mother’s death, the 19-year-old became King of Navarre.\n\nAt Queen Joan III’s death, it was arranged for Henri to marry Margaret of Valois, daughter of Henri II and Catherine de’ Medici. The wedding took place in Paris on August 18, 1572 on the parvis of Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nHenri became heir presumptive to the French throne in 1584 upon the death of François, Duke of Anjou, brother and heir to the Catholic Henri III of France who had succeeded Charles IX in 1574. Because Henri of Navarre was the next senior agnatic descendant of King Louis IX, King Henri III of France had no choice but to recognise him as the legitimate successor. Salic law barred the king’s sisters and all others who could claim descent through only the female line from inheriting. Since Henri of Navarre was a Huguenot, the issue was not considered settled in many quarters of the country, and France was plunged into a phase of the Wars of Religion known as the War of the Three Henries. Henri III of France and Henri III of Navarre were two of these Henries.\n\nThe third was Henri I, Duke of Guise, (the eldest son of François, Duke of Guise, and Anna d’Este. His maternal grandparents were Ercole II d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Renée of France, herself the second daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne of Brittany) who pushed for complete suppression of the Huguenots and had much support among Catholic loyalists. The Catholic League accepted Henri, Duke of Guise because of his staunch Catholicism, despite his claim to the throne being in contention with the Salic Law for his claimed descent from Louis XII of France, his great-grandfather, was through the female line. Political disagreements among the parties set off a series of campaigns and counter-campaigns that culminated in the Battle of Coutras.\n\nIn December 1588, Henri III of France had Henri I of Guise murdered, along with his brother, Louis Cardinal de Guise. Henri III thought that the removal of Guise would finally restore his authority. Instead, however, the populace were horrified and rose against him. In several cities, the title of the king was no longer recognized. His power was limited to Blois, Tours, and the surrounding districts. In the general chaos, the king relied on King Henri of Navarre and his Huguenots.\n\nThe two kings were united by a common interest—to win France from the Catholic League. Henri III acknowledged the King of Navarre as a true subject and Frenchman, not a fanatic Huguenot aiming for the destruction of Catholics. Catholic royalist nobles also rallied to the king’s standard. With this combined force, the two kings marched to Paris. The morale of the city was low, and even the Spanish ambassador believed the city could not hold out longer than a fortnight. But Henri III was assassinated shortly thereafter (August 2, 1589) by a fanatical monk.\n\nWhen Henri III died, Henri of Navarre nominally became king of France. The Catholic League, however, strengthened by support from outside the country—especially from Spain—was strong enough to prevent a universal recognition of his new title. Most of the Catholic nobles who had joined Henri III for the siege of Paris also refused to recognize the claim of Henri of Navarre, and abandoned him. He set about winning his kingdom by military conquest, aided by English money and German troops. Henri’s Catholic uncle Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, was proclaimed king by the League, but the Cardinal was Henri’s prisoner at the time. Henri was victorious at the Battle of Arques and the Battle of Ivry, but failed to take Paris after besieging it in 1590.\n\nWhen Cardinal de Bourbon died in 1590, the League could not agree on a new candidate. While some supported various Guise candidates, the strongest candidate was probably the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, the daughter of Felipe II of Spain, whose mother Elisabeth had been the eldest daughter of Henri II of France. In the religious fervor of the time, the Infanta was recognized to be a suitable candidate, provided that she marry a suitable husband.\n\nThe French overwhelmingly rejected Felipe II’s first choice, Archduke Ernest of Austria, the Emperor’s brother, also a member of the House of Habsburg. In case of such opposition, Felipe indicated that princes of the House of Lorraine would be acceptable to him: the Duke of Guise; a son of the Duke of Lorraine; and the son of the Duke of Mayenne. The Spanish ambassadors selected the Duke of Guise, to the joy of the League. But at that moment of seeming victory, the envy of the Duke of Mayenne was aroused, and he blocked the proposed election of a king.\n\nThe Parlement of Paris also upheld the Salic law. They argued that if the French accepted natural hereditary succession, as proposed by the Spaniards, and accepted a woman as their queen, then the ancient claims of the English kings would be confirmed, and the monarchy of centuries past would be nothing but an illegality. The Parlement admonished Mayenne, as Lieutenant-General, that the Kings of France had resisted the interference of the Pope in political matters, and that he should not raise a foreign prince or princess to the throne of France under the pretext of religion. Mayenne was angered that he had not been consulted prior, but yielded, since their aim was not contrary to his present views.\n\nDespite these setbacks for the League, Henri remained unable to take control of Paris.\n\nOn July 25, 1593, with the encouragement of his great love, Gabrielle d’Estrées, Henri permanently renounced Protestantism and converted to Roman Catholicism—in order to obtain the French crown, thereby earning the resentment of the Huguenots and his former ally Queen Elizabeth I of England. He was said to have declared that Paris vaut bien une messe (“Paris is well worth a mass”), although there is some doubt whether he said this, or whether the statement was attributed to him by his contemporaries. His acceptance of Roman Catholicism secured the allegiance of the vast majority of his subjects.\n\nSince Reims, the traditional location for the coronation of French kings, was still occupied by the Catholic League, Henri IV was crowned King of France at the Cathedral of Chartres on February 27, 1594. He did not forget his former Calvinist coreligionists, however and was known for his religious tolerance. In 1598 he issued the Edict of Nantes, which granted circumscribed toleration to the Huguenots.\n\nKnightfall is an upcoming historical fiction drama television series on the History Channel. The 10-episode series is set to premiere on December 6, 2017. It recounts the fall, persecution, and burning at the stake of the Knights Templar as orchestrated by King Philippe IV of France on October 13, 1307. The series focuses on Templar leader Sir Landry, a brave warrior discouraged by the Templars’ failures in the Holy Land who is reinvigorated by news that the Holy Grail has resurfaced.\n\nWhile I love historical fiction it contains just that, fiction. So here is some historical background that goes into the events of the series Knightfall.\n\nThe King\n\nPhilippe IV (April–June 1268 – 29 November 1314), also known as Philippe the Fair and the Iron King was King of France from 1285 until his death in 1314. Through his marriage to Joan I, Queen of Navarre and Countess of Champagne 1274-1305, (daughter of King Henri I of Navarre and Blanche d’Artois) he was also Philippe I, King of Navarre from 1284 to 1305. Though his wife was Countess of Champagne in her own right, Philippe IV briefly took the reigns of government into his own hands by Right of his wife. Philippe IV was known as handsome, however, his obstinate character won him from friends and enemies. His fierce opponent, Bishop Bernard Saisset of Pamiers, said of the king, “He is neither man nor beast. He is a statue.”\n\nThe mounting Crisis.\n\nIn 1290, King Edward I of England (1272-1307) had ordered the Jews to leave England. In turn, Philippe IV, the Iron King, also expelled the Jews from France in July of 1306. With the Jews out of France, Philippe IV had to appoint royal guardians to collect the loans made by the Jews, with the money being passed to the Crown. These actions did not go well in France. The Jews were looked upon as honest and good businessmen who not only satisfied their customers but were held in high esteem by the general populace. In contrast the king’s money collectors were universally reviled.\n\nIn 1315 the people of France complained and complained loudly, to the point where the Jews were invited back to France and were given a guarantee of 12 years free from government interference. In 1322, the Jews were expelled once again by the King Charles IV of France and Navarre 1322-1328, third son of King Philippe IV, who did not honour his fathers commitment after the great leper scare of 1321.\n\nPhilip IV’s financial treatment of the Jews was anti-semitic, but Christians, the wealthy and poor, clergy and lay people alike all suffered due to the Kings actions. Another prominent group wounded by Philippe IV’s policies were wealthy abbots and Lombard merchants. The merchants, who had made extensive loans on the pledge of repayment from future taxation, were expelled from France and their property sized. To further demonstrate his cruelty Philippe IV reduced the value of French coinage. In 1306 these policies which had a harsh impact on all less-wealthy people of France, led to a two-thirds loss in the value of the livres, sous and deniers in circulation. This financial crisis led to rioting in Paris which forced Philippe IV to briefly seek refuge in the Paris Temple – headquarters of the Knights Templar.\n\nPhilippe IV vs. Boniface VIII.\n\nPope Boniface VIII 1294-1303 condemned Philippe IV for his damaging policies along with his spendthrift lifestyle and his treatment of the Jews. The king levied taxes on the French clergy, calling for at least half their annual income, causing a major conflict with the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy, prompting Pope Boniface VIII to issue a Papal Bull, Clericis Laicos (1296), which forbade the transference of any church property to the French Crown.\n\nIn response to the Papal Bull, Philippe IV convoked an assembly of bishops, nobles and grand bourgeois of Paris in order to condemn the Pope. This assemble was a precursor to the Etats Généraux, appeared for the first time during his reign. This assembly was viewed as a measure of the professionalism, order and legitimacy that his ministers were trying to implement into the government. This assembly gave support to Philippe IV’s condemnation of the pope. Pope Boniface VIII retaliated and escalated the conflict with the ground breaking Papal Bull, Unam Sanctam* (1302) which declares papal supremacy.\n\nKing Philippe IV emerged as the victor in the conflict. Philippe sent his agent Guillaume de Nogaret to arrest Pope Boniface VIII at Anagni. Prior to the arrival of the French garrison Boniface excommunicated both Philippe IV and Nogaret. However the pope was able to escape, after being beaten, but died soon afterward. With the Holy See vacant French archbishop Bertrand de Goth was elected pope as Clement V beginning the Babylonian Captivity of the papacy (1309–77), during which the official seat of the papacy moved from Rome to Avignon, an enclave surrounded by French territories, and was subjected to French control and became a virtual puppet of the French monarchy.\n\nSuppression of the Knights Templar\n\nWith the aid and refuge given to Philippe IV by the Knights Templar the king was substantially indebted to them. The Knights Templar were a monastic military order whose original role was that of protectors of Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land during the Crusades. By the time of Philippe IV’s war against Pope Boniface VIII the influence and need for the Knights Templar had waned. In order to free himself from his indebtedness to the Knights, Philippe IV used a disgruntled complaint of heresy ** against the Knights Templar as an excuse to move against the entire organization and destroy both its religious and financial power and influence in France.\n\nAnother prime motive for Philippe to squash the Knights Templar was in order to consolidate power into a royal theocracy where the monarchy had both secular and spiritual power/authority in France. This foundation was built upon the Franco-papal rift at the time of Boniface VIII. With the Papacy now a fixture in France, Philippe IV saw himself as the ultimate defender of the Catholic faith, and felt empowered with a Christlike function giving him authority above the pope. This places the need for the Papal Bull Unam Sanctam of 1302 by Boniface VIII, in a proper historical context.\n\nAt daybreak on Friday, October 13, 1307, hundreds of Templars in France were simultaneously arrested by agents of Philippe IV, and were later tortured into admitting heresy into the Order. In their view the Knights rejected the spiritual authority claimed by Philippe IV and believed they were only answerable to only the Pope. With Pope Clement V under the direct control of the French king, ordered the Knights Templar to disband. At first Pope Clement V did attempt to hold proper trials, but Philippe IV used previously forced and coerced confessions to condemn the Knights Templars who were promptly burned at the stake before a proper defense could be made.\n\n* The Bull lays down dogmatic propositions on the unity of the Catholic Church, the necessity of belonging to it for eternal salvation, the position of the pope as supreme head of the Church, and the duty thence arising of submission to the pope in order to belong to the Church and thus to attain salvation. The pope further emphasizes the higher position of the spiritual in comparison with the secular order.\n\n** The heresy levied against the Knights Templar stem from claims that were made that during Templar admissions ceremonies recruits were allegedly forced to spit on the Cross, deny Jesus Christ, and engage in indecent kissing. The Nights were also accused of worshipping idols, and the order was said to have encouraged homosexual practices. None of these claims have ever been historically verified."
