        "text": "I admit it, I am totally a (historical) royals geek. Of course, I understand that royalty are just people, some of whom arenât very interesting or nice. But especially when I was younger, I read numerous âQueens of Englandâ books and biographies of various queens. I always think about doing social media theme days with images of different queens, then get disappointed when I realize that there arenât enough movies/TV series to make it worthwhile. I did the English queens in three posts, now I have to do the French!\n\nBEFORE YOU FREAK OUT, I am consciously skipping these people who are worthy of (or already have) their own posts:\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine\n\nCatherine de’ Medici\n\nMary, Queen of Scots\n\nMargaret of Valois\n\nAnne of Austria\n\nFranÃ§oise d’AubignÃ©, Marquise de Maintenon\n\nMarie Antoinette of Austria\n\nJosÃ©phine de Beauharnais\n\nMarie Louise, Duchess of Parma\n\nMarie ThÃ©rÃ¨se of France\n\nEugÃ©nie de Montijo\n\nIâm mostly working with Wikipedia data here, so if you know of a movie or TV series that has included any French queens, please feel free to add it in the comments! If theyâre not listed here, itâs because I canât find any onscreen portrayals. Also, I donât wanna hear any bitching about the term âlesser.â I mean âless frequently depicted.â Breathe.\n\nRadegund of Poitiers (c. 539-61)\n\nA ThuringianÂ princess, she was one of six wives of Clotaire I, king of the Franks. SheÂ founded theÂ Abbey of the Holy CrossÂ atÂ Poitiers.\n\nFredegund (c.Â 545-597)\n\nBorn into a low-ranking family but marriedÂ ChilpericÂ I, theÂ MerovingianÂ FrankishÂ king ofÂ Soissons. She has a bad reputation (deserved?) and was “put aside” for another woman by her husband, but after his deathÂ served as regent for her son fromÂ 584-97.\n\nShe was played by Diane Delor inÂ L’Enfant des loupsÂ (1991). I can’t find a photo…\n\nHildegard of the Vinzgau (771-83)\n\nThe daughter of CountÂ Gerold of Kraichgau, she was the second wife of Charlemagne.\n\nAnne of Kiev (1051-60)\n\nDaughter ofÂ Yaroslav the Wise,Â Grand Prince of Kiev, she married Henry I. She served as regent for her son fromÂ 1060-65, and founded St. Vincent Abbey in Senlis. I can’t find an even vaguely-contemporary image of the real deal!\n\nBlanche of Castile (1223-26)\n\nDaughter ofÂ Alfonso VIII,Â King of Castile, she marriedÂ Louis VIII. She was involved in politics and organized armies in support of her husband multiple times. She served as regent for her son during his minority (1226-34) and again when he was on Crusade (1248-52).\n\nMargaret of Provence (1234-70)\n\nDaughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence, she married Louis IX. Her sisters were also queens: Eleanor of England, Sanchia of Germany, and Beatrice of Sicily. She joined her husband on crusade and was very politically active.\n\nMargaret of Burgundy (1305-15)\n\nDaughter ofÂ Robert II, Duke of Burgundy, she married Louis X of France and I of Navarre. She was caught up in a scandal when she and her sisters-in-law were accused of committing adultery in the “Tour de Nesle affair,” and she spent the last two years of her life in prison.Â I can’t find an even vaguely-contemporary image of the real deal! Maybe because she was considered a hoooor?\n\nClementia of Hungary (1315-16)\n\nShe was the daughter ofÂ Charles Martel of Anjou, the titularÂ King of Hungary, although she was born and grew up in Naples. She was the second wife of Louis X of France/I of Navarre, who died shortly after their marriage while she was pregnant (the baby died). She continued to be active in royal life in Paris thereafter.\n\nJoan II, Countess of Burgundy (1315-30)\n\nShe was the daughter ofÂ Otto IV, Count of Burgundy, andÂ Mahaut, Countess of Artois. She married Philip V and ruled as Countess of Burgundy and Countess of Artois. She was implicated as possibly knowing about the adultery that happened in the “Tour de Nesle affair” and was imprisoned as a result, but eventually her name was cleared.\n\nBlanche of Burgundy (1322)\n\nSister of Joan II of Burgundy, she was the daughter ofÂ Otto IV, Count of Burgundy. She married the future Charles IV, and was yet another accused of adultery in the “Tour de Nesle affair.” She was imprisoned until her death. Yet another for whomÂ I can’t find an even vaguely-contemporary image of the real deal – again, maybe because of potential hoor-dom.\n\nShe was played byÂ Anne Malraux inÂ Les Rois mauditsÂ (2005), but I can’t find any images.\n\nJoan of Burgundy akaÂ Joan the Lame (1328-49)\n\nDaughter ofÂ Robert II, Duke of Burgundy, she married Philip IV; she had some kind of limp, hence the nickname. She served as regent while her husband fought on campaign, and was a scholar.\n\nShe was played by Claude Gensac inÂ Gaston PhÃ©bus, le Lion des PyrÃ©nÃ©esÂ (1978), but I can’t find any pics.\n\nTune in next week for the second half of my French queens run-down!"
