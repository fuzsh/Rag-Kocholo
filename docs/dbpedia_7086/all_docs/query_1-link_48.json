The image, created by Eduardo Rosales and colored, depicts the moment when Blanche is being delivered into the custody of the Captal of Buch, a nobleman from Foix, in the castle of Buch. The scene is set against the backdrop of the Middle Ages, an era marked by feudal loyalties and complex political alliances. Blanche is depicted as a regal figure, dressed in the finest medieval attire, with an air of determination and resilience in her eyes. Surrounding her are a group of men, including her husband, Gaston IV of Foix-Bearn, the Infante of Castile, Eleanor of Navarre, her sister, and other noblemen from Asturies, Evreux, Moncada, and Orthez. The interior of the castle tower looms ominously in the background, a symbol of Blanche's impending confinement and imprisonment. The Captal of Buch, a stern and imposing figure, stands before Blanche, his expression betraying a mixture of authority and concern. The scene is a testament to the complex web of power dynamics and political maneuverings that characterized the medieval world, where alliances could shift rapidly, and the fate of a queen could hang in the balance. This engraving is a stunning reminder of the intricacies of medieval politics and the strength and resilience of the women who navigated them. It is a powerful visual representation of Blanche II of Navarre's story, a tale of power, politics, and determination in the face of adversity.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nFramed Prints\n\nBring historical elegance to your home or office with Media Storehouse's Framed Prints featuring Blanche II of Navarre (1424-1464).
