        "text": "Monarchs of the Kingdom of Navarre\n\nSee also: List of Navarrese consorts\n\nThis is a list of the kings and queens of Pamplona, later Navarre. Pamplona was the primary name of the kingdom until its union with Aragon (1076–1134). However, the territorial designation Navarre came into use as an alternative name in the late tenth century, and the name Pamplona was retained well into the twelfth century.\n\nThe Íñiguez dynasty are credited with founding the Navarrese kingdom (of Pamplona) in or around 824 when they are said to have risen against an attempt to extend Frankish (Carolingian) authority into the region. The Cordoban sources referred to them as sometimes-rebellious vassals, rather than in the manner used to refer to the Christian realms outside their control. They were supplanted in 905 when an anti-Cordoba coalition placed the succeeding Jiménez dynasty in power.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriages Death Íñigo Arista\n\n824?–851/52 4 children 851/52 García Íñiguez\n\n851/52–882 son of Íñigo Arista Urraca\n\n5 children 882 Fortún Garcés\n\n882–905 son of García Íñiguez Auria\n\n5 children 922\n\n(deposed 905)\n\nIn 905, a coalition of neighbors forced Fortún Garcés to retire to a monastery, and enthroned in his place a scion of a new dynasty. Under their reign, the name Navarre began to supplant that of Pamplona.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Sancho I Garcés\n\n905–925 son of García Jiménez and Dadildis de Pallars Toda of Navarre\n\n6 children 11 December 925\n\nResa Jimeno Garcés\n\n925–931 son of García Jiménez and Dadildis de Pallars Sancha of Navarre\n\n3 children 29 May 931 García Sánchez I\n\n931–970 919\n\nson of Sancho I Garcés and Toda of Navarre Andregota Galíndez of Aragón\n\n2 children\n\nTeresa Ramírez of León\n\n3 children 22 February 970\n\naged 51 Sancho II Garcés Abarca\n\n970–994 after 935\n\nson of García Sánchez I and Andregota Urraca Fernández\n\n4 children December 994 García Sánchez II\n\n994–1000/04 son of Sancho II Garcés Abarca and Urraca Fernández Jimena Fernández of Cea\n\n981\n\n4 children 1000/04 Sancho III the Great\n\n1004–1035 985\n\nson of García Sánchez II and Jimena Fernández of Cea Muniadona of Castile\n\n1010\n\n4 children 18 October 1035 García Sánchez III\n\n1035–1054 1016\n\nson of Sancho III the Great and Muniadona of Castile Estefanía of Barcelona\n\n1038\n\n9 children 15 September 1054\n\nAtapuerca Sancho IV Garcés\n\n1054–1076 1039\n\nson of García Sánchez III and Estefanía of Barcelona Placencia\n\n1068\n\n3 children 4 June 1076\n\nPeñalén\n\nWith the assassination of Sancho IV, Navarre was partitioned by his cousins Alfonso VI of León and Sancho Ramírez of Aragón, and the latter made king, leading to more than half a century of Aragonese control.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Sancho V Ramírez\n\n1076–1094 1042\n\nson of Ramiro I of Aragón and Ermesinde of Bigorre Isabel of Urgel\n\n1065\n\n1 child\n\nFelicia of Roucy\n\n1076\n\n3 children 4 June 1094\n\nHuesca\n\naged approximately 52 Peter\n\n1094–1104 1068\n\nson of Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragón and Navarre and Isabella of Urgel Agnes of Aquitaine\n\n1086\n\n2 children\n\nBertha of Aragón\n\n1097\n\nNo children 28 September 1104\n\nAran Valley\n\naged approximately 36 Alfonso I the Battler\n\n1104–1134 1073\n\nson of Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragón and Navarre and Felicia of Roucy Urraca of León\n\n1109\n\nNo children 8 September 1134\n\nHuesca\n\naged approximately 61\n\nThe death of Alfonso led to a succession crisis in Aragón and the nobles of Navarre took advantage to reestablish an independent monarchy, crowning a grandnephew (through an illegitimate brother) of the assassinated Sancho IV.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death García Ramírez the Restorer\n\n1134–1150 son of Ramiro Sánchez of Monzón and Cristina Rodríguez Marguerite de l'Aigle\n\n1130\n\n4 children\n\nUrraca of León\n\n24 June 1144\n\n2 children 21 November 1150\n\nLorca Sancho VI the Wise\n\n1150–1194 1133\n\nson of García Ramírez and Marguerite de l'Aigle Sancha of Castile\n\n1157\n\n6 children 27 June 1194\n\nPamplona Sancho VII the Strong\n\n1194–1234 1157\n\nTudela\n\nson of Sancho VI of Navarre and Sancha of Castile Constance of Toulouse\n\n1195\n\nNo children\n\nClemence (of Hohenstaufen?)\n\naft. 1201\n\n1 son 7 April 1234\n\nTudela\n\nSee also: Count of Champagne\n\nThe death of Sancho VII, the last of the Jiménez kings, led to the crown of Navarre being inherited by the son of his sister Blanche, Countess of Champagne, she having been regent during much of her brother's reign.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Theobald I the Posthumous\n\n1234–1253 30 May 1201\n\nTroyes\n\nson of Theobald III of Champagne and Blanche of Navarre Gertrude of Dagsburg\n\n1220\n\nNo children\n\nAgnes of Beaujeu\n\n1222\n\n1 child\n\nMargaret of Bourbon\n\n1232\n\n6 children 8 July 1253\n\nPamplona\n\naged 52 Theobald II the Young\n\n1253–1270 1238\n\nson of Theobald I of Navarre and Margaret of Bourbon Isabelle of France\n\n6 April 1255\n\nNo children 4 December 1270\n\nTrapani\n\naged 32 Henry I the Fat\n\n1270–1274 1244\n\nson of Theobald I of Navarre and Margaret of Bourbon Blanche of Artois\n\n1269\n\n2 children 22 July 1274\n\naged 30 Joan I\n\n1274–1305 14 January 1271\n\nBar-sur-Seine\n\ndaughter of Henry I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois Philip IV of France\n\n16 August 1284\n\n7 children 4 April 1305\n\nChâteau de Vincennes\n\naged 34\n\nSee also: Kings of France\n\nHenry's unexpected death left his infant daughter Joan as the only heir to the throne.
