        "text": "Charles III (Basque: Karlos, Spanish: Carlos; 22 July 1361 – 8 September 1425), called the Noble, was King of Navarre from 1387 to his death and Count of Évreux in France from 1387 to 1404, when he exchanged Évreux for the Duchy of Nemours.\n\nAs a young man, Charles was frequently sent by his father, King Charles II, to act as the envoy to France, where the family had vested interests both as fief holders and princes of the blood royal. Following Charles II's dismal reign, Charles III set out to improve Navarre's infrastructure, restore its pride, and mend strained relations with France. While he may have seen himself primarily as a French prince, particularly early on, the focus of the Navarrese foreign policy during Charles III's reign gradually shifted towards Navarre's neighbours in the Iberian Peninsula."
