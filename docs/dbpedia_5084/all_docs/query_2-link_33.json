        "text": "Since the early Nintendo days, we’ve seen many of our favorite horror films (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th) turned into a digital piece of entertainment, and vice-versa.\n\nFast forward to today, many video games have made the jump from the very small screen to the big screen (Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Five Nights at Freddy’s). What could be fueling such a revolution? That’s where Brie Hoban (Game Reviewer, Journalist, and Horror Fanatic) jumps in and talks to Letterboxd’s Brett Petersel about horror films, video games, and more.\n\nYou and I have been planning this for so long, so it’s great to finally have you on Letterboxd. I’m such a fan of your written work, so let’s start there and talk about your approach to your craft.\n\nWhat is it about video games, and their crossover into film, that excites you?\n\nHonestly, so much excites me about the crossing of these two mediums and the potential for some of gaming’s best horror to be introduced to a larger audience. The horror genre of gaming has evolved so much in recent years, due in significant part to the boom in indie horror titles, and the unique audiences they draw. Until now, we have primarily seen legendary horror films attempt to make their mark on the gaming space. The last two gaming generations alone have seen cult-classic series, such as Friday the 13th, Evil Dead, TheTexas Chainsaw Massacre, The Blair Witch Project, and The Exorcist, as well as more recent properties like Paranormal Activity, attempt to make their mark on a mainstream gaming audience. Quite a few of those properties have already attempted this feat multiple times before. Then you have original properties, such as Dead By Daylight, which are fighting to become a new home for many of the silver screen’s biggest Horror icons.\n\n2023 saw a shift in the opposite direction, due in no small part to the massive success of Blumhouse’sFive Nights at Freddy’s, which, in my opinion, is based on one of horror gaming's most overlooked masterpieces. The success of FNAF promises to have a huge impact on the horror film genre moving forward and is already setting the precedent for how studios approach such adaptations. I promised I wouldn’t gush too much about this, but FNAF really stands as the perfect example of how audiences, and the horror landscape, have changed in recent years. The film was made explicitly for fans, and Blumhouse did a great job of keeping fan expectations in check throughout production. The FNAF community is accustomed to a certain level of direct, but cryptic, communication with the games’ developers, and Blumhouse did a great job of establishing a similar rapport. Adhering so closely to the game series’ methods of communication and storytelling came at a cost, as general moviegoers could tell you. When the film was released, it was all but alienating for those unfamiliar with the series and its shift throughout the years. After all, everyone is familiar with the original’s “jump-scare simulator” reputation. However, diehard fans have since experienced 13 additional titles and over 30 novelizations, all of which have expanded the lore to something much greater and far more disturbing than casual audiences are aware of. It’s all a lot to keep track of, and theorizing the FNAF series is one of the things that led me to game journalism in the first place.\n\nHow effective do you think this approach was, regarding the FNAF film’s reception? Do you think it will have a larger effect on the horror genre?\n\nWhen the FNAF film finally premiered, it was exactly what diehards had hoped to see: a story-driven narrative that offered more questions than answers. Currently, the games are known for their environmental storytelling, rather than their all-out horror, with each entry requiring a keen eye and hours of additional observation to fish out fact from fiction. The film replicated this so effectively that it ignited the same type of theorizing and community discourse that the series’ most popular games had prior. To a moviegoer, that may sound absurd, but the numbers speak for themselves. Despite a critical thrashing, FNAF went on to become Blumhouse’s most successful theatrical release of all time, and concurrently Peacock’s most-watched movie of all time. Its success has already seen the announcement of various new projects from within the indie horror space. There was recently an announcement of a Bendy and the Ink Machine feature film, which hopes to adapt a franchise that shares a lot of similarities to FNAF. This is a bit of a tangent but Bendy, like FNAF, is generally regarded with disinterest from a lot of unknowing, or “mature”, gamers, largely due to its marketing and merch. Honestly, this is a topic that I could easily get lost in but will try to refrain from. Marketing and merch in the modern indie horror space is a monster all its own.\n\nThat’s a good point. Do you believe that marketing for these films, let alone their IP, affects the overall product, which includes films, merchandise and more?\n\nAlright, well, if we’re going there, allow me to explain this “trend” in greater detail. A lot of indie horror games today start as small, free releases. They rely largely on word of mouth and live streams to do their initial marketing. Many studios, or individual game creators, will send out the first chapter of their game months, or even a year, before the final product is close to being finished. This results in a unique duality since the titles that go on to be the most successful are usually those that connect as watchable media first, and then as a full game experience. Had no one found it fun to watch FNAF, there would be no franchise. No games. No books. No movie. Hell, an entire sub-genre of gaming would never have come to exist. While the first FNAF was the full experience from day one, others, like Bendy, took quite a while to release the full experience. The first episode of Bendy and the Ink Machine was released for free on a site called Game Jolt in February 2017, before arriving on STEAM in April, but the fifth and final episode didn’t arrive until October 2018. While those who waited to pick up the complete experience were able to play from start to finish, those who started with Chapter 1 on Game Jolt experienced periodic chapters over roughly 20 months. This method of release is very common within gaming’s indie horror genre.\n\nBut here’s the thing. In the interim (before that final product is released), what is the quickest way to make a few bucks, while keeping the fanbase hyped for each episode’s release? After all, the rest of the game needs to be funded, and we don't want people to move onto another property while they wait for each episode. That’s the dilemma that a lot of indie horror developers face right now, and few are seeing the overnight success garnered by FNAF. What results is an abundance of merchandise. For who? The people who WATCH people play the games, not the players themselves. Studios and companies aren't trying to sell the merch to late-20’s/early 30-year-old players of these games, such as Markiplier, Dawko, 8bitryan, FusionZgamer, and MatPat (I’m aware these names are unknown to most audiences), but the demographic watching them. After all, these games are starting as free releases. They make little to no money from the players themselves. Then FNAF came along and a path to success was seemingly laid before small indie horror developers. FNAF was made for those who connected with its core concept (creepy 80’s-style animatronics at Chuck E. Cheese or Showbiz Pizza), but the merch was aimed at the kids watching adults freak out on YouTube. Why? Because these players are doing the developer’s marketing for them. That's why now, in 2024, you can go to Wal-Mart and see FNAF Backpacks, Poppy Playtime Blind Boxes, and Bendy action figures, and costumes for all three come Halloween. The developer’s core demographic, when creating a game, is the people old enough to play it, i.e. the PG-13 to R-rated crowd, but the merchandise is aimed much much younger.\n\nMarketing sure has changed quite a bit since we were young.\n\nMuch has changed. When we were young, we had to chase this type of media ourselves. I’ve no doubt Horrorville’s audience is familiar with the unique thrill of watching a movie they weren’t supposed to at a friend’s house, trying to rent something in secret, or being introduced to some horrifically gory movie by an older sibling. Streamers are that very resource for today’s young horror fans, except the whole process cuts out the middle-man - parents. Kids can access these games for free, by watching them second-hand, and companies are capitalizing on this new dynamic. So now you see parents buying adorable little Poppy Playtime plushies, and FNAF graphic novels (from Scholastic, no less) at Target for their kids, without knowing anything about the source material. They see other kids with the merch and it basically sells itself. However, if you took one look into some of those books (or what they’re rated) you would find that the majority are ages 13 and up, at least. I dare you to open up a copy of the newest FNAF Graphic novel, next time you’re at the bookstore, and take a look at the art for The Breaking Wheel. That would give you a good idea of what the FNAF series' true subject matter consists of.\n\nThis whole duality causes an interesting scenario to occur when these franchises are adapted for film, as two very different fan demographics exist. Who is the movie for? How do you make a film that satisfies both the players and the watchers? More importantly, how do you market the film to general audiences? FNAF seemingly solved this dilemma by meeting in the middle. A PG-13 film that puts storytelling - lore, if you will - over scares, making its “horror” slightly more accessible to a younger audience, but giving the older audience the veiled storytelling that they crave. Still, you can’t fully satisfy any audience member through this method. General moviegoers and critics found FNAF’s disjointed storytelling alienating. Adult fans were satisfied, but are now clamoring for an R-rated cut that will never come. Lastly, despite its PG-13 limits, quite a few parents were utterly shocked by the gore and darker elements in the film’s story. After all, they were taking their child to what they believed to be a horror movie aimed at children, due to their familiarity with the merchandise.\n\nIn 2024, we have a new Silent Hill film hitting the big screen and the Killer Klowns from Outer Space video game coming to both computer and game systems. What do you think has fueled all of this, allowing old films and/or franchises to shift into new realms?\n\nThe horror film genre has a long history of attempting to break into the gaming mainstream. I’m sure that you, as well as many of Horrorville’s readers, are very familiar with the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street NES games, and you and I have previously discussed the delightful Evil Dead and The Thing titles from the PS1 and PS2 eras. While each has had its niche audience, none had been all that successful financially, leading to corporate higher-ups growing hesitant to go all-in on horror film adaptations in the past. In the modern era, however, the line between games and films has grown blurry, as both are capable of releasing blockbuster titles with immersive and altogether terrifying methods of storytelling. As the gaming landscape has grown, companies have begun to test the waters once more, adapting classic franchises into easy-to-digest formats, such as the asymmetrical horror genre, including the recent Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, and Dead by Daylight titles, as well as the upcoming Killer Klowns from Outer Space.\n\nLikewise, I believe we will see the same shift in the film space, with franchises like Silent Hill, which already boasts two enjoyable, but altogether weak, films, taking another stab at a big hit on the silver screen. Like I said earlier, the success of FNAF is what will truly result in a shift within the “horror games adapted to film” landscape. You’d likely be surprised to hear, given my immense praise of the FNAF franchise, that I believe this shift will have a largely negative impact. Just as the original game resulted in a massive boom in mascot horror titles, I suspect the film's success will see a similar barrage of watered-down content. As we speak, film adaptations of various indie horror titles are already in development, including the aforementioned Bendy, Martha Is Dead, Dead by Daylight, Until Dawn, and Poppy Playtime. Frankly, the latter provides a rather perfect example of exactly how an attempt to cash in on this trend can go awry.\n\nRegarding the potential negative impact, you bring up a great point. We’re seeing this “landscape” come up for grabs, and the results we’re seeing come close to “watered-down content.” Do you believe the film studios are just rushing in to make a quick buck, or do you believe they’ll deliver what the fandom wants?\n\nIt’s hard to say. FNAF and Bendy are certified successes, and, while older fans may feel the film was slightly watered down, FNAF managed to connect with all of its demographics at once. Both have a concrete place in the indie horror space, with multiple, complete titles released, and are praised by their respective fanbases. I truly don’t believe that either of the studios behind these films are in it for a quick buck. Hell, FNAF’s creator, Scott Cawthon, was present and active in nearly every phase of the film’s writing and production, and Blumhouse used him as the guiding force behind the film, despite its potential to leave general audiences behind. What resulted was an excellent film, according to those it was made for, and success the likes of which Blumhouse had never before seen. If done right, these films can absolutely deliver what fans want, but it comes at a cost. Game fandoms are not like movie fandoms, and FNAF is a good example of how doing the right thing poses an enormous risk of failure since it comes at the cost of leaving many film conventions, and audience members, behind.\n\nHowever, this smooth transition to film is usually not the case, and the indie horror gaming space can create quite the unique nightmare scenario, should a studio attempt to cash-in on the game-to-film concept. Take Poppy Playtime, for example. I thoroughly enjoy the Poppy Playtime series, but the future of the series is looking murky at best. Poppy Playtime released its first episode in October 2021 and immediately started pumping out merchandise. To the surprise of many, it seemingly managed to replicate FNAF’s overnight success. This led to a film adaptation being announced in April 2022, which, it should be noted, was a month before the title’s second chapter was released. However, we are now in 2024, and fans have not gotten Chapter 3, which is not intended to be the final chapter. To make matters worse, a group of essential writers and programmers left the developer, MOB Entertainment, in December 2023. Coming up on two years since the film’s announcement, Poppy Playtime remains unfinished and fans are worried it may never see completion. This is a problem unique to the pipeline we are seeing develop in these indie-game-to-film adaptations. I think this problem is only going to grow, following the success of the FNAF film.\n\nTouching upon your point on how “Game fandoms are not like movie fandoms”, can you explain the difference between the two?\n\nI think it’s all rather straightforward. Game fandoms are actively involved in the media that they are consuming. They are making decisions, facing challenges, guiding narratives, exploring worlds, and, in general, feeling like a part of something bigger. The fandoms for different franchises are involved in their respective worlds to varying degrees. As I said (above), the FNAF fandom solves puzzles and has been the driving force behind determining that series’ narrative since day 1. They explore this world and piece together that narrative, it isn’t presented to them. At this point, they have films, books, games, and multiple full-fledged VR titles hiding this information for them to find. In the latter, they are quite literally dropped into the game’s world and asked to search. This whole process does something for gamers that films simply cannot do, bridge the gap between screens and audiences. Gaming fandoms are borderline rabid about their respective series because they’ve spent time and invested in its world. Whether it is a shooter, RPG, Horror, or Action-Adventure game, fans of a given title are such because of how the experience involves them, rather than what is experienced. Movie fans need to go to Halloween Horror Nights or Galaxy’s Edge to get a small taste of what a VR horror game can provide to its fans for $40+. That’s nothing against movie fans or gaming fans, it's just a snapshot of how each medium elicits different needs from its fans.\n\nMovie fans, a category to which I’m sure anyone involved in or reading this interview belongs, engage with their fandom differently. Information is presented to them. They are an observer of a story without a definitive ending, and the way they engage with their fandom is quite the opposite of gaming fans. Movie fandoms bring the world of their respective properties to life, themselves. Collecting memorabilia, hosting screening events, throwing watch parties, attending conventions, creating cosplay, going to meet and greets, etc. Movie fandoms experience their favorite properties secondhand through watching and then reinforce their experience through social interaction and celebration. Gaming fans, on the other hand, interact with their property’s world and narrative, firsthand and often in isolation, before reinforcing the experience through shared discourse. As I said earlier, there are a few circumstances through which movie fans dip into a gaming-style fandom, such as Universal and Disney Parks' attempts to recreate the worlds of certain fan-favorite properties and the occasional movie-to-game adaptation. However, as history has repeatedly shown, those costly attempts at enveloping movie fans in their respective worlds often leave them dissatisfied. Movie fans want to do that themselves through expression.\n\nI’m sure someone might say “What are you talking about, Brie, you just listed books as one of those open-world examples for FNAF and gaming fandom”, but it's true. These aren’t books like a movie tie-in would be. There’s no true story to them. They are just as cryptic as any game and some require the same amount of extracurricular exploration to decipher. The same goes for many other “games-adapted-to” formats. Gaming audiences expect to receive, and are therefore given, a very different style of information than movie audiences, and we are going to see this truth play out on screen more and more, following Blumhouse’s satisfying treatment of FNAF fans.\n\nI’d love for you to tell our readers about your business, Brie Kind Rewind, part of which sees you collect and refurbish VHS tapes. I’ve seen some before and after highlights on your Instagram. How did this come about?\n\nSo, Brie Kind Rewind came about due to my love of horror films. While I certainly enjoy modern horror films and games, old-school VHS slashers and straight-to-VHS schlock are my happy place. There’s just something special about it, you know. VHS just fits horror. The way it looks. The way it sounds. Everything is perfect. Sure, I could spend my time watching a 4K Blu-ray on the PS5, or playing some wholly immersive VR horror game. However, nothing quite feels more right than, and I kid you not, plopping a small composite VHS combo TV on my coffee table, turning out the lights, and watching my favorite horror tapes. I did that very thing with one of my odd favorites, Dead Dudes in the House, just last night.\n\nCollecting tapes can be expensive, though, and more times than not you will find that tape you’ve been looking for, only to discover that it's moldy. I quickly learned how to clean tapes thoroughly, so that I could save a few bucks and keep my overall collection in great condition. Sure, it takes maintenance, but it's a good skill to have. A lot of people just trash their moldy tapes.\n\nIt also bears mentioning that I’m rather strange about my collecting. Those who know me can attest that I have written rules for myself, to keep my collecting from getting out of hand. One of these rules is that I can not have more than 100 tapes in my true collection at any one time, and another is that, if they are a US release, I must buy them through personal interaction. Additionally, I’ve challenged myself to find the very “best” release of each film I wish to keep in my collection. These tapes are added to my collection purely from the standpoint of personal value, but the “best” part is also subjective, which sees me replace that 100 with either better films, or rarer versions of each tape. I know it sounds insane. I’m known for these weird rules at this point, but honestly, it keeps me driven. While I don’t care much for comparing collections, there are some real heavyweights in there at this point, and having landed them through personal interactions and relationships makes them all the more valuable to me. My adherence to these strange rules is where Brie Kind Rewind began.\n\nAs I replaced previous tapes with rarer versions, or a new film entirely, I began to sell those replaced to others within the VHS community. I began to build relationships with other collectors and horror fans, giving rise to the cleaning of tapes for others. I started posting comprehensive guides on social media and getting DMs with pictures of others in the process of following those directions. I soon realized that this could be a business in itself. Now I buy some tapes purely for this purpose. I may head to a few record stores over the weekend and look through their tapes, even if it's not a particularly great film, I will buy the ones they planned to toss, clean them, and sell them, literally for $2 most of the time. Those who buy know their history, and I send along instructions on how to clean them, should any specs return years down the line. While it's fun for me and a nice way to make a little extra money, my favorite part of the tape cleaning aspect of my selling is that it keeps tapes in circulation.\n\nIt's also nice when this process leads to a rare find. My personal copy of Chopping Mall is actually a tape I bought from someone who planned to trash it, due to its mold. After a very VERY thorough cleaning process, that tape has been in my collection for years now and still looks great. That’s the process through which Brie Kind Rewind found its actual footing. At the moment, the Brie Kind Rewind business is in a state of transition as I shift towards a more official business approach, with some big new concepts in mind. You can expect some more news about that on my social media in a few months. It’s going through a bit of a “rebirth”, as you will.\n\nYou’ve shared some of your collection with me. I am incredibly jealous.\n\nI’m glad you like it! As I said, each has its own story, and that makes it all the better. For instance, one of my longtime favorite VHS tapes is Halloween III: Season of the Witch, of which I owned the second run-MCA release for quite some time. Then, last year, I visited The Horror House in Chicago, which everyone should stop to visit, and started talking tapes with co-founder Vinny Malave. Quick shoutout to Moses and Aaron as well. After about 30 minutes, I noticed some tapes hidden away in the background, and marked “Not for Sale”. However, by the time we were done, Vinny and I settled on a price for a “RAINBOW” MCA Halloween III I had seen in the stack, providing an upgrade for one of my favorites. That tape proudly sits on my shelf today, and I’ll never get rid of it.\n\nNow that we’ve talked a bit about retro games and movies, let’s move to modern horror. What are some films that you can’t wait to see this year?\n\nWell, first I’ll temper this part of the discussion with the shared understanding that both of us have been in various test screenings for some of this year’s big releases. So, there’s some extenuating context as to why these are my picks. That said, there are a few films that I am really looking forward to this year, for a variety of reasons.\n\nBring it on.\n\nTerrifier 3 is chief among my most anticipated, from a place of pure inspiration. I really love how Dameon Leone was able to start carving out a mythos in the second film, and elevate this character that has grown bigger and bolder with each subsequent appearance following The 9th Circle. Honestly, it's become one of those “I wish I was there” kind of films for me, which is another concept we’ve discussed. It may surprise you to learn, though probably not, that writing video game articles and cleaning tapes isn’t the lifelong goal for me. Shocking, right? I’m still very much on that path to carving out my place, and I like to think that someday I’ll be on that path I’ve always hoped to follow. Terrifer 2 was one of those “oh shit” experiences that made me remember there is that perfect place somewhere. One day, one of these weird ideas I have for a book, game, or movie could not only see release, but truly connect with a community the way that Terrifier has. As someone who loves strange and spectacular horror movies, “I wish I was there” is the pinnacle response any form of media can elicit from me. My place likely won’t have anything to do with Terrifier, but I hope to find a way to be a part of creating something with a similar effect. That being said, if (part) 4 needs a few more victims, those responsible know where to find me. Moving on….\n\nThough it's now seen release, Shudder’s Destroy All Neighbors was one of my most anticipated for the year. I’ll watch anything Alex Winter is a part of, and the prospect of seeing him in a weird and wacky film in head-to-toe prosthetics will get me to buy a ticket every time. I’ve shared that FREAKED is a big personal favorite of mine, so Destroy All Neighbors’ combination of that Alex Winter-y goodness, buckets of gore, and rock music had me counting the days to release. I had the opportunity to see the film with him present for a Q&A (shoutout Alamo Drafthouse NYC!), which made it all the more special. Due to the size of the event, I had some time to speak with him one-on-one about the film and FREAKED, which was, honestly, something I never dreamed I’d get to do. Cross it off the bucket list!\n\nLisa Frankenstein is another I’m eager to see, because Diablo Cody kicks ass and I love the aesthetic of the whole thing. Return to Silent Hill, MAXXXINE, and whatever the Alien franchise is cooking up are also high up on my list.\n\nLastly, a film that I somehow forgot about until just recently, and for which I am now very excited, is the Stone Age Horror film Out of Darkness. Such a compelling central concept, and very unique among this year’s slate of horror releases. It likely won’t be for everyone, but I am very intrigued by the folk horror-y vibes and ancient setting.\n\nHonestly, this year is just looking really solid for horror, as well as for horror-adjacent releases. I’m sure more films will fall out of the woodwork and make their way onto my list as these first months get underway.\n\n2024 is certainly shaping up to be quite a year for film, given the number of films you mentioned. What about horror games? Are there any that our readers should have on their radar in 2024?\n\nQuite a few promising horror games are coming out this year, but few have fans as excited as Bloober Team’s highly-anticipated Silent Hill 2 Remake. While it doesn’t have an official date yet, Silent Hill 2 Remake’s release will be one of gaming's biggest moments in 2024, for better or worse. Between now and March, you also have the very promising Alone in the Dark reimagining starring David Harbor and Jodie Comer, Banishers: A New Eden, and The Outlast Trials’ release on consoles. There’s also this cool-looking survival horror game called Pacific Drive coming out in February that sees players experience a supernatural narrative, with crafting mechanics, largely from the driver’s seat of their car.\n\nBeyond March 2024, very few horror titles have definitive release dates, but there are certainly some worth keeping an eye on. Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of both Silent Hill and Forbidden Siren, has a new title called Slitterhead coming out, though little is currently known about it. Dead by Daylight is set to release its first single-player narrative game, The Casting of Frank Stone, in partnership with Until Dawn’s Supermassive Games. Supermassive is also set to release Little Nightmares 3 this year, which I am personally very excited about.\n\nThere’s also a host of really cool indie horror games set to arrive this year. Still Wakes the Deep from developers The Chinese Room will pit players against an unknown horror while trapped on an oil rig in a violent storm. Then you have the first-person found footage title Paranormal Tales, which looks to leverage Unreal Engine 5 for photorealistic horror. Add to those a new Clock Tower game, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Reveil and you have the makings of a great year for horror, with even more titles likely to be announced for release in the year’s final months.\n\nThat’s a wrap! Thank you for joining us! Before I let you go, where can everyone find you online?"
