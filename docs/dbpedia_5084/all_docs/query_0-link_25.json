        "text": "For this installment of Bloody Disgusting’s The Silver Lining, we’ll be discussing M.J. Bassett’s Silent Hill: Revelation, which is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.\n\nChristophe Gans’ Silent Hill is single-handedly responsible for my obsession with horror. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always been fascinated by spooky media, but I grew up as a bit of a scaredy-cat. In fact, when I first watched this videogame adaptation, I absolutely hated the experience. Not only was I terrified by Gans’ take on the nightmarish Otherworld, but I was also left with recurring nightmares about Pyramid Head and that damned siren noise.\n\nIronically, these lingering scares are what eventually motivated me to purchase a Silent Hill game in order to face my fears. That decision led to a long-lasting love-affair with both the Silent Hill franchise and horror in general. So when a follow-up to the 2006 film was announced, I was understandably stoked. Not only would this sequel adapt Silent Hill 3, the game that introduced me to the series, but it would also be written and directed by MJ Bassett, a fan of the franchise who had already helmed the Silent-Hill-influenced WWI flick, Deathwatch.\n\nEven Bassett’s Solomon Kane adaptation had its fair share of moody scares, so I rushed to follow the director’s now-defunct blog which chronicled the making of Silent Hill: Revelation. From pre-production all the way to editing, MJ shared how her history with the games influenced her creative decisions while also posting behind-the-scenes photos and easter eggs for dedicated fans. Boasting a great cast, a passionate crew and eerily faithful visuals, the film looked extremely promising.\n\nSO WHAT WENT WRONG?\n\nStudio interference has become something of a recurring theme in these Silver Lining articles, and I’m afraid that Silent Hill: Revelation is no exception. From the project’s origins, producer Don Carmody claimed that the film was meant to be more accessible to general audiences, which is usually a bad sign for videogame adaptations. While the film made nearly three times its budget at the box office despite a mere 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, there’s no denying that it traded the first film’s atmospheric meditation on religion and parenthood for a more conventional experience.\n\nBassett has actually gone on record claiming that the writing and filming of Revelation was something of a collaborative effort, with the production turning into a classic case of “too many cooks” as the director struggled to maintain control of the picture. MJ has since taken responsibility for many of the film’s flaws, but it’s clear that the higher-ups weren’t exactly keen on letting her make the movie she had originally envisioned.\n\nTo make matters worse, the studio slashed the film’s budget to less than half of its predecessor’s while also demanding even more intense set-pieces, this time shot on extremely cumbersome 3D cameras. This insistence on flashy effects and costly CGI enhancements despite limited resources resulted in an extremely gimmicky sequel that somehow feels a lot smaller than the original film.\n\nOf course, the biggest problem here is the messy story. On the surface, Revelation follows the general plot of Silent Hill 3, seeing a teenage Heather Mason suffer through vivid flashes of the hellish Otherworld and travelling to the titular town to discover her true heritage. Unfortunately, the flick can’t quite decide if it’s a true sequel to the 2006 film (which took several annoying liberties with the source material) or a proper adaptation of the third game in a long-running series. This lack of commitment results in a confused film that tries to please everybody but doesn’t really reach anyone.\n\nAudience reactions actually got so bad that the director even apologized to fans after the film’s release, going so far as to delete her once-popular blog. In the years since, Bassett has revealed that she was also dissatisfied with the finished product but kept her opinions to herself for marketing reasons.\n\nAt the end of the day, not even the director could have saved this doomed sequel.\n\nTHE SILVER LINING\n\nI’m not going to lie. I absolutely despised Revelation when I first saw it back in 2012. From the questionable production value to the story culminating in what amounts to a Silent-Hill-themed Pokémon battle, I remember walking away from the experience as if I had just seen someone spit on the grave of a loved one (which is an appropriate analogy, as Konami has basically buried the Silent Hill franchise). That being said, the movie has really grown on me over the years, and there are several reasons for that.\n\nFirst and foremost, there’s no denying that MJ is a real fan of the games, and while studio interference and the lack of an appropriate budget might have sabotaged the intended experience, that genuine love of the franchise is still there. From the game-accurate Robbie the Rabbit appearances to Travis Grady’s unexpected cameo, it’s clear that the filmmakers were passionate about the source material. It’s just unfortunate that this passion wasn’t allowed to shine.\n\nEven so, Silent Hill fans are sure to appreciate details like the surprisingly faithful recreations of Heather’s outfits and the game-accurate graffiti, with the infamous “save” symbol appearing several times throughout the movie. The monster designs are also really creative, with a few unique creatures not present in the original games. Hell, Claudia Wolf’s new monstrous form wouldn’t look out of place in a Hellraiser flick, and I appreciate how the movie doesn’t skimp out on gore.\n\nIt may be schlocky and kind of off-brand, but you’ve got to admit that the bloody chases and kills are fun in a midnight b-movie sort of way. Limbs are severed and cultists are gutted in three glorious dimensions, with Revelation finding its charms as an entertaining theme park attraction.\n\nThe cast is also surprisingly great, with Adelaide Clemens making for a lovable protagonist, absolutely nailing her double role as both Heather/Sharon and a grown-up Alessa Gillespie. Of course, it’s Carrie-Anne Moss who steals the show as the devilish Claudia Wolf, chewing up scenery and somehow managing to out-perform Malcom McDowell as an insane cultist. There’s even a pre-Game of Thrones Kit Harrington thrown in for good measure, trying his best to hide his British accent.\n\nWhile I’m still holding out for a truly faithful Silent Hill adaptation (especially if it tackles the second or fourth games), the past decade has led me to appreciate this film as an entertaining misfire with a lot of potential. It may not quite live up to the source material or its predecessor, but I’d argue that Silent Hill: Revelation can be a fun time if you check your expectations in at the door. It might also get more people to revisit Bassett’s underrated Deathwatch, and that’s always a plus!\n\nWatching a bad movie doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad experience. Even the worst films can boast a good idea or two, and that’s why we’re trying to look on the bright side with The Silver Lining, where we shine a light on the best parts of traditionally maligned horror flicks.\n\nHurricanes are frightening all on on their own without having to involve a predatory animal. Yet Carlos Brooks’ Burning Bright not only features a Category 3 hurricane, a ferocious tiger is thrown in for added effect. Back when this film was first announced, its plot was met with laughter and doubt; the idea was as intriguing as it was ridiculous. Over time though, this suspenseful story of a girl, a boy, and a tiger has become a shining example of how to follow through on a high concept.\n\nTwo distinct yet equally uncontrollable forces are on display at the beginning of Burning Bright. As Hurricane Isabel builds a sense of foreboding in the background, a young woman finally confronts her family situation. The collegebound Kelly (Briana Evigan, Sorority Row) is making the difficult decision of leaving behind her autistic brother Tom (Charlie Tahan, Super Dark Times) when life catches her off guard again. Kelly’s plans are dashed after her late mother’s husband Johnny (Garret Dillahunt, Last House on the Left) steals the money intended for Tom’s new care. And for what? A wildlife ranch with the centerpiece being, of course, a former circus tiger deemed more evil than scary by Meat Loaf. The musician’s fulsome cameo feels nearly out of place in this film, but the character is a forceful reminder not to take the tiger lightly, even when the plot comes across as absurd.\n\nThere is no organic way to have a tiger present in this story, seeing as these creatures are exotic to most people. They don’t belong in, much less originate in a place like Florida. So there needs to be a bridge of some kind that brings these disparate elements together. And after assuming Johnny’s latest purchase would simply escape his enclosure and enter Kelly’s house, Burning Bright thinks outside the box even further by revealing the tiger was released. This plot development is both so nutty and so fiendish it sounds like something drummed up by EC Comics.\n\nThe film neither has nor needs time to ponder the whys and whats of the characters’ sudden predicament; like Kelly and Tom, Burning Bright is in survival mode. The director is instead too busy finding efficient ways to keep the momentum up and the audience engaged. Those forty-something minutes of a (big) cat and mouse game could have quickly gone south in less capable hands, but Brooks manages to avoid the worst possible outcome in these kinds of conceptual stories. That is, boring the audience by either desensitizing them to the threat or animal, or just being too repetitive.\n\nUnlike Alexandre Aja’s somewhat similar natural-horror film Crawl — the ’80s snake thriller Fair Game is an even closer match — Burning Bright doesn’t have the luxury of a dynamic venue (among other things). Kelly and Tom are very much sentenced to their home after it was sealed up with them inside. So there is a fair deal of the characters going around in circles here and revisiting the same parts of the house. In turn though, that story tightness becomes more and more intense as well as detectable on screen. The camera gets almost uncomfortably close and fixed on the actors’ faces, in particular when their rawest emotions are coming out in some form or another.\n\nEscaping the tiger would be easier than this film’s symbolism. Perhaps taking a page out of The Descent and other films like it, Burning Bright uses a deadly creature — albeit a non-fantastical one — to contextualize a personal dilemma. What’s missing is nuance, on account of the straightforward approach. There is no mistaking what is being communicated here as Kelly fights for hers and Tom’s life. That level of simple storytelling could maybe minimize the film’s impact, however, the uncomplicated route works well in this case. An allegory being precise is preferable to a poor one.\n\nBurning Bright would not be anywhere as effective without its leads. Charlie Tahan tends to be overlooked due to Tom being nonverbal, yet for his age, he turned in an impressive performance that is never ostentatious. Then there is Briana Evigan, a familiar face of 2000s horror, who is owed some credit for her character’s lasting impression. She requested the filmmakers give Kelly a personality touch-up so she would be more likable: “If you didn’t care about [her], why would you care if she survived?” And the work put into the protagonist pays off well. Yes, there is little delay before Burning Bright throws the brother and sister into the tiger pit that is now their home. However, it’s important to remember that Christine Coyle Johnson and Julie Prendiville Roux’s script doesn’t sacrifice character for action once the tiger shows up; the sibling relationship is always being explored. Every scene — especially ones with the tiger — deepens the personal story at the heart of the film, and paves the way for a rewarding and cathartic ending.\n\nThis isn’t a subtle film. Far from it. No, Burning Bright lays it on rather thick with traps both literal and metaphorical, which, by virtue of solid direction and performances, culminate into a worthwhile story of resilience. Apropos of thematic complexity, the film is still a far ways off from its namesake — William Blake’s poem The Tyger — but there are poetic moments here and there.\n\nHorror contemplates in great detail how young people handle inordinate situations and all of life’s unexpected challenges. While the genre forces characters of every age to face their fears, it is especially interested in how youths might fare in life-or-death scenarios.\n\nThe column Young Blood is dedicated to horror stories for and about teenagers, as well as other young folks on the brink of terror."
