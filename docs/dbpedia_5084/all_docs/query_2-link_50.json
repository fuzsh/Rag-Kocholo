        "text": "Mother is God in the eyes of a child, and it seems God has abandoned the town of Silent Hill. Silent Hill is not a place you want to visit. It’s a town destroyed by the warped beliefs of the townspeople and their evil practices which they carried out under the guise of purification. It’s a town sitting in limbo, punishing its population for their past actions. A fire still burns under Silent Hill, in the abandoned coal mines, and in the heart of a little girl now twisted by anger and her need for revenge.\n\nAnd yet, Sharon finds herself called to Silent Hill. In the night she sleepwalks and calls out for the town she has no memory of as her adoptive parents Rose and Christopher feel powerless to help her. While Christopher believes Sharon needs professional help, Rose decides that a road trip to Silent Hill itself will finally solve the mystery of her daughter’s night terrors.\n\nLISTEN TO OUR HORROR PODCAST!\n\nRose may be Sharon’s adoptive mother, but she still has a strong mothering instinct. She knows that the only way to figure out what is going on with Sharon is to return to the town that plagues her dreams and answer the call the town has made to her. Rose has to fight her husband to prove that she knows better and understands the needs of her daughter, even if Sharon doesn’t fully understand what is being asked of her. Whatever the truth is, no matter how horrible a place Silent Hill is, Sharon will never be free of the nightmares that make their way into her head every night unless she returns home and confronts the other parts of herself that have been left behind.\n\nChristopher blocks Rose’s credit cards and pleads with her to return, but Rose is strong in her resolve. Even when they almost get pulled over by the police officer Cybil Bennett, Rose decides to make a break for it instead to make a desperate bid for Silent Hill. It’s almost as though she believes all their problems will be solved the minute they cross into the town boundaries.\n\nRose even agrees to take Dark Alessa into herself, so that she can sneak the demon into the church and wipe out the townsfolk once and for all. Rose knows this is the only way she will be able to get Sharon back, but she also recognizes the importance of Alessa getting her revenge. Rose sees Sharon reflected in Alessa, and as a mother, sympathises with the things Alessa was put through in the name of religious purification.\n\nIt’s in this moment that Rose steps in and does what Dahlia couldn’t, by standing up for Alessa and supporting her needs. Rose is not overcome by fear or the pressure of the townsfolk and only thinks about what is best for her child. Her motherly bond is so strong that she saves both Sharon and Alessa from the horrible hold the town has over them at the same time.\n\nDark Alessa and Alessa are true to their word, and when they wreak their revenge on the town they leave Rose and Sharon unharmed. Rather than being evil just for the sake of it, the two versions of Alessa have a very clear purpose in their hatred and anger, and it’s very rightly focused on the people in the town who caused all this with their warped religious beliefs.\n\nThe only Silent Hill resident left alive is Dahlia. While Dahlia is confused that Alessa didn’t take her, Rose explains it’s “because you’re her mother. Mother is God in the eyes of a child.” While Alessa is unable to rescue Dahlia from the dark realm of Silent Hill, she spares her the torturous barbed wire death that everyone else has to suffer. Also, staying in limbo is surely preferable to being sent directly to Hell, which is definitely where Christabella was going.\n\nEarlier in the film, Anna remarks that “not even the darkness wants her” of Dahlia, but the truth is Alessa has been keeping her mother safe as much as possible from the creatures that roam the streets. Even after 30 years and enough rage to turn a whole town into a nightmare scape, Alessa still loves her mother and forgives her for the part she played in her burning.\n\nWhile Rose is not Alessa’s mother, both Alessa and Dark Alessa recognize her significance because she chose to welcome Sharon into her life. Rose formed a bond with Alessa by mothering and nurturing the good side of her, and that’s why she ends up such a vital part of Alessa’s plan.\n\nAlessa has tried to take down the townsfolk on her own, and yet they are still safe from her in their church. It is Rose’s bravery to take Dark Alessa into herself and fight Christabella head-on that finally allows both versions of Alessa access to the church. Christabella thought that God was the most powerful force in Silent Hill, but she clearly hadn’t reckoned on Rose. Only Dark Alessa recognised Rose’s full potential and the things a mother will do to protect her child.\n\nAdoption in horror movies is often told as a scary story from the point of view of the mother or new family who have welcomed this child into their home. Movies like Orphan (2009), The Omen (1976), or Before I Wake (2016) show adoption as a perilous activity that means welcoming a child into your home who may very well want to kill you (or possess powers that will kill you accidentally).\n\nAdoptive mothers are often dealing with the grief of the loss of a child, or the inability to have their own children and adopt in what is seen as a second-choice option. In Silent Hill, there’s never any real reason given for why Rose and Christopher chose to adopt Sharon. There’s no traumatic story from their past, but instead, just a need to have a child and love it. And so, they chose to pick a child that had already been born and abandoned and was so in need of a loving home.\n\nThey’ve had Sharon since she was a baby and clearly formed a very loving family around her. At the first signs of trouble, Rose takes immediate action to try and solve the mystery of Sharon’s past and help her get a good night’s sleep again. Sharon is seen as a happy and content child, drawing under a tree with her mother as they continue on their road trip. The bond the two share is undeniable.\n\nAnd so, Silent Hill gives us a more positive representation of adoption and the adoptive mother than a lot of other movies have managed. Rose never feels a disconnect from her daughter or like she isn’t her real mother. She tells Cybil, “Sharon’s adopted, but I’m her mother. I knew that from the moment I first laid eyes on her.” There’s never this worry of Sharon being some sort of cuckoo in the nest, waiting to strike and cause pain for her parents."
