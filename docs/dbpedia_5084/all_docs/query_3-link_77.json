        "text": "Casting has been revealed for the next Silent Hill movie, which will begin filming next month.\n\nJeremy Irvine (War Horse) and Hannah Emily Anderson (Jigsaw) will lead Return To Silent Hill, which is set to be based on the Silent Hill 2 video game, Deadline reports.\n\nFilming will be underway next month in Germany and Eastern Europe, directed by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.\n\nAs per the official synopsis, the film will follow James (Irvine), a man broken after being separated from his one true love (Anderson).\n\n“When a mysterious letter calls him back to Silent Hill in search of her, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil.\n\n“As James descends deeper into the darkness, he encounters terrifying figures both familiar and new and begins to question his own sanity as he struggles to make sense of reality and hold on long enough to save his lost love.”\n\nDirector Gans said in a statement: “Return to Silent Hill is a mythological love story about someone so deeply in love, they’re willing to go to hell to save someone.\n\n“I’m delighted to have the wonderful talents of both Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson take us on this journey into a psychological horror world that I hope will both satisfy and surprise fans of Silent Hill.”\n\nProducer Victor Hadida added: “Christophe and I have been working closely with our partners at Konami, as they update the video game, to also create a version of Silent Hill for the theatrical audiences of today.\n\n“You will still find the iconic monsters – but there will also be new designs. We are confident that this new film and Konami’s updated game together will propel the franchise forward for years to come.”\n\nFollowing months of speculation, Konami officially confirmed last year that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in the works at Bloober Team, in addition to NoCode’s Silent Hill Townfall and another new title Silent Hill F."
