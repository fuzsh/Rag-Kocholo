        "text": "Aside from the film version, the town of Silent Hill is not based on Centralia, Pennsylvania. This misconception is so widespread that even the series co-creator is getting tired of it. It's time to set the record straight so that balance can be restored to geekdom.\n\nThe Sources\n\nView: https://twitter.com/adsk4/status/1549579054155972609\n\nView: https://twitter.com/adsk4/status/1549948454272925697\n\nView: https://mobile.twitter.com/adsk4/status/1399688965024747521\n\nPlayStation Magazine: Why did you choose a small US town for the setting of the game? Is there a real Silent Hill?\n\nKeiichiro Toyama: If you like modern horror novels, it would be easy to understand, but it's the situation that you can't miss. In this game, the modern horror novel atmosphere was the hook, so we decided to choose a small U.S. town for the setting. Of course, Silent Hill really does not exist, and we have not allocated a certain place or time in the game. We deliberately did not use an actual place, since it might cause inconsistency with the real thing. However, with the name Silent Hill, we got a hint from a real place in Japan.\n\nPlayStation Magazine: In your opinion, how does Silent Hill differentiate itself from other games in the horror genre?\n\nKeiichiro Toyama: It will be easy to outline Silent Hill's characteristics if we look into the two main concepts that we focused on from the start. One is that the game was supposed have a \"modern American novel\" type of atmosphere. A traditional town in the countryside is the setting for the game, where it creates the weirdness and the eeriness in the ordinary world.\n\nThat was one of the themes of the game. Another point is on the technical side. Using the light and the dark effects to create a life-like atmosphere, using full polygons. The darkness is the key element to the game, and we have created a completely new light source engine specifically for this title.\n\nPlayStation Magazine: What is the inspiration for the supernatural powers that exist in Silent Hill? Does any of it stem from real life folklore or legend?\n\nKeiichiro Toyama: To tell you the truth, and this might be not such an interesting answer, but all of Silent Hill was made up. Some of the names have some cult backgrounds or the sort, but what the team was most inspired by were the cult movies from the 70's and the 80's and maybe the Science Fiction movies from the 50's, more than the modern horror novels, actually. There are some cult icons that appear in the game, but those were just some added points to build a frightening feeling.\n\nInterview with Keiichiro Toyama (PSM) - Silent Hill Memories\n\nSilent Hill series creators: information, biographies, articles and interviews\n\nEven in the nightmare world, there is a cycle. It becomes night (?) on a number of occasions as Harry moves about the town. In the same way, there are also many times when aspects of the town and its buildings change completely. For the sake of convenience, this will be referred to as the \"right side\" and \"reverse side\" in this book. These changes occur because there is a cycle in the world of Alessa's nightmares which envelops the town. In the same way that a person normally repeats REM sleep and non-REM sleep in regular cycles while he or she is sleeping, when the nightmare world approaches a deeper darkness (sleep), a phenomenon occurs in which light is almost completely taken away and the world shifts into an even deeper nightmare as the cycle shifts again. Incidentally, the reason the \"reverse side\" takes on such an ominous aspect is that with her burned body, Alessa's endless nightmares were twisted and amplified by thoughts of the malevolent god. Her hatred and terror became nourishment on which the malevolent deity thrived.\n\nSilent Hill is a town where an ominous god is worshipped, and where those who hold darkness in their hearts gather. This is a look back at half of the lifetime of the young girl from whom it all originated. Alessa (14 years old at the time) suffered from the burns inflicted upon her since the ritual that brought about the descent of God. In order to escape Dahlia's control, she calls out to Cheryl, her other self (7 years old at the time) to return. Due to the power of Alessa's thoughts, the town is transfigured into the otherworld.\n\nBook of Lost Memories - Alessa's History\n\nEnglish translation of Book of Lost Memories\n\nRecap\n\nSilent Hill wasn't based on any particular real world location.\n\nThere was no giant coal mining fire. Silent Hill is a tourist town in Maine, the coal fire stuff was made up by Christophe Gans.\n\nThe games have fog, not smoke.\n\nSnow, not ash.\n\nThe red rust in the first game is exclusively a reflection of Alessa's inner thoughts, which is why it's not in Silent Hill 2 and 4: The Room. Like Pyramid Head and Bubble Head Nurses, it was misused in later games because of the popularity of the movie. Every Otherworld is manifested from an individual, so there isn't a default look."
