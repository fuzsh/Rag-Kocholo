        "text": "As rumors keep swirling about a return to for the games, a new Silent Hill movie may also be in the works.\n\nDuring an interview with Jeux Video (translated via ComicBook.com) Christopher Gans – who directed the first Silent Hill movie – teased that a new entry could be released as soon as 2023. It seemingly won't be a sequel.\n\n“I'm currently working on it,” he said of a third Silent Hill movie. “The script for a new Silent Hill movie that is totally independent from the two previous movies made and respects the way Silent Hill has evolved.”\n\n“Silent Hill is a bit like Twilight Zone, the Fourth Dimension, a place where anything and everything can happen,” he said. “I worked on a new Silent Hill which is a Silent Hill of the year 2023 since the film would be released next year… in 2023… and not a Silent Hill as I imagined it in 2006.”\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThat’s quite a surprise given the lack of interest in the films. The original Silent Hill made just $100 million on a budget of $50 million, with its sequel, Silent Hill: Revelation, doing even worse both critically and at the box office. But Gans believes the franchise can evolve.\n\n“It is a Silent Hill for today's audiences while being ultra-respectful of the saga,” he added. “I am aware that Silent Hill is a very great video game franchise and a work of art in the noble sense of the term. The people who thought up Silent Hill put a lot of their guts into it.”\n\nTo date, there has been no official announcement about a third Silent Hill film. Equally, we have no idea who might star in the upcoming movie. But Gans asserts that Silent Hill 3 would reflect the changing face of modern horror.\n\n“For me, it was important to design a Silent Hill in the light of the current public,” he explained. “It is clear that today's horror cinema no longer resembles the horror cinema of 2006. Good for that matter. Not that 2007 horror cinema wasn't good, but every genre is going through an evolution.”\n\n“I'm trying to take into account what I've been able to see recently,” he added, “which is more original and more surprising in terms of horror films, and to see if in Silent Hill there are the seeds, or even the expression, of that. Silent Hill has always been a game beyond the norm and ahead of its time.”\n\nIt's interesting timing, given how many rumors we've seen in recent years about a return to the Silent Hill franchise in games. Reports have stated that the franchise will see at least two new games, said that Polish developer Bloober Team could be working on a Silent Hill 2 remake, and we've even seen leaked screenshots of what could be a new game.\n\nIt's possible that franchise owner Konami isn't just planning a return to the games, but the movies as well. In the meantime, read more about Silent Hill with IGN’s review of the original film, and find out why its sequel is on our list of the worst video game movies of all time."
