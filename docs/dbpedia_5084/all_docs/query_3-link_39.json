        "text": "While this adaptation was surprisingly faithful to the game, when told through the medium of film the plot is a bloated and confusing mess. It is hard to connect with the film’s characters in the onslaught of horror imagery and exposition dumps.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | May 22, 2024\n\n…Silent Hill is no masterpiece, the plotting is lopsided, the climax confusing and somewhat repellently violent in a Clive Barker way, but it’s also a strong, female-driven story with exquisite visuals and sound design…\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jun 4, 2023\n\nThe result looks better than most based-on-a-video-game adaptations, but the storytelling is just as dim as we’ve come to expect from such material.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Sep 25, 2022\n\nFans of the game could well be bewitched by Gans' attempts to recreate its tone and atmosphere, but those unfamiliar with the storyline will simply be left bothered and bewildered.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Aug 19, 2022\n\nGets lost over-explaining things in the last act (which somehow makes it even more confusing), but the first two are filled with such great atmosphere and style that it mostly makes up for it.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Apr 26, 2021\n\nCertainly, it's a far better bet than such unwatchable video-game efforts as Assassin's Creed, Max Payne and the worst-of-the-worst Alone in the Dark, even if it doesn't offer much more than superb visuals wrapped around an underwhelming narrative.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jul 13, 2019\n\nA train wreck. And this one is so bad I couldn't wait to look away.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 0/4 | Jun 5, 2019\n\nThere are worse adaptations of video games out there but this one will probably leave the PlayStation generation itching for their consoles.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Apr 25, 2019\n\nWhilst not as atrocious as some other films that have opened this year, the truely woeful story and quality of Silent is saved only by its occasion moments of visual flair, and its all over effective creepy atmosphere.\n\nFull Review | Jan 15, 2008"
