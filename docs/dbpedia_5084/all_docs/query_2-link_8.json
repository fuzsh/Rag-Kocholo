        "text": "Silent Hill is great. I used to hate scary movies. Shit would give me nightmares. Also I never understood why people wanted to be scared. How is being scared enjoyable in any way? It wasn’t till I got older and stopped being afraid of the dark that I came to understand and appreciate horror films. I still don’t watch horror films for the scares, that still does nothing for me. I watch them now for three reasons\n\nFor the imagination and creativity that goes into them (a horror-fantasy world really has no limits)\n\nThe mythology/back story of most horror films are like good ghost stories.\n\nFor the humor. Yes, I said humor. Once you come to terms with the fact that it’s not real, the super scary things in horror movies seem really funny.\n\nThe first thing you notice about Silent Hill is that it is beautifully shot. So Silent Hill is actually a Japanese survival horror video game franchise. The director of the movie, Christophe Gans, begged the producers of the video game for the rights to the franchise. When he made finally made a video interview explaining how important the games were to him, they finally relented and gave him the rights. And you can see the love on the screen. One of the most important aspects of any horror film is the atmosphere and Gans nails it. In the video game and in the film, the town of Silent Hill is covered in ash that is still falling. It’s just beautifully done.\n\nAnother plus is that the CGI, which usually hurts most horror films works in Silent Hill. The director doesn’t try to hide that the film comes from a video game. The CGI is blatently CGI and because of that, the audience just accepts that, and it works. We realize that we are in a dream world of sorts. The monsters in Silent Hill aren’t real monsters, they are monsters from our dreams.\n\nOh, and did I mention Sean Bean is in the film!!! The producers of the film demanded their be a male lead in the film. He actually has a small role compared to the other leading female characters, but any film with Sean Bean in it is a better film.\n\nOne last note, they fucked up the ending. I’m not going to ruin it for you, but the lead character keeps going further and further into the depths of Silent Hill, not just metaphorically but also literally. Right when we think she is about to get to the bottom and find the last great monster, the film pulls her and us out of the depths and goes in a different direction. They probably thought they had to do this because it’s a film, but I think they would have been better off sticking to the classic video game conclusion and just having it all end in the bottom of hell. Oh well, you win some you lose some!\n\nSilent Hill\n\nOverall Rating: 7.3\n\nHorror Film Rating: 7.8\n\nSilly Horror Film Rating: 8.4\n\nHorror Video Game Based Film: 8.9"
