        "text": "During the Silent Hill Transmission livestream today, a new featurette was revealed for Return to Silent Hill that provides a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming filmâs production. Gans spoke at length about his personal return to the project and together with producer Victor Hadida shared a behind-the-scenes look of the making of the film.\n\nReturn to Silent Hill is directed by Christophe Gans, who also directed the first movie released in 2006. He co-wrote the script with Sandra Vo-Anh and William Josef Schneider. The project is produced by Victor Hadida for Davis Films, Molly Hassell for Hassell Free Productions, and David Wulf.\n\nThis third film is the Silent Hill movie series is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2 (20o1), the fan-favorite game in Konamiâs successful survival horror series. The story follows heartbroken widower James Sunderland (Jeremy IrIrvine) as he searches for his seemingly deceased wife Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson) in the eponymous foggy town.\n\nAccording to the film’s official synopsis:\n\nWhen a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary, he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love.\n\nIn the new featurette, Christophe Gans spoke about the emotional layers of horror in the story, which is more disturbing and unsettling. He said he considers the first film “an epic journey of horror,” whereas Return to Silent Hill is “much more like a deep dive into psychological horror.”\n\nThe director also confirmed the return of series composer Akira Yamaoka for the film’s soundtrack. Gans spoke about retaining the spirit of the game and staying true to Yamaoka’s work, saying:\n\nYes, Akira Yamaoka is on this film. That’s very important for me, you know. Because I’m working on HIS creation. I never forgot that. It’s exactly like adapting a great book. It’s important to show respect and humility into his process.\n\nFan-favorite villain Pyramid Head from the film was recently revealed at the Cannes Film Festival a few weeks ago, where it was being previewed.\n\nUnfortunately, no release date was announced; instead, we only got a “Coming Soon” title card at the end of the featurette. Stay tuned here for more updates and announcements as they happen.\n\nYou can view the full Behind-the-scenes Early Sneak Peek of Return to Silent Hill below."
