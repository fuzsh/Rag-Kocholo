Konami officially announced the Return to Silent Hill film in October 2022.\n\nVictor Hadida (live-action Resident Evil film franchise) is producing the film.

M.J. Bassett later directed the Silent Hill: Revelation film that opened in 2012.\n\nKonami's Silent Hill horror game franchise debuted in 1999.
