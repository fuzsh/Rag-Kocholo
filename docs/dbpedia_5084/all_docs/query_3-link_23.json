        "text": "Silent Hill movie director Christophe Gans returns to the franchise with Return to Silent Hill, set to be a brand new film adaptation of Silent Hill 2. Variety has our first look today.\n\nCheck out the first preview of Pyramid Head’s return above!\n\n“The film will follow James (Jeremy Irvine), a man broken after being separated from his one true love (Hannah Emily Anderson). When a mysterious letter calls him back to Silent Hill in search of her, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil.\n\n“As James descends deeper into the darkness, he encounters terrifying figures both familiar and new and begins to question his own sanity as he struggles to make sense of reality and hold on long enough to save his lost love.”\n\n“Return to Silent Hill is a mythological love story about someone so deeply in love, they’re willing to go to hell to save someone,” said director Gans. “I’m delighted to have the wonderful talents of both Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson take us on this journey into a psychological horror world that I hope will both satisfy and surprise fans of Silent Hill.”\n\n“Christophe and I have been working closely with our partners at Konami, as they update the video game, to also create a version of Silent Hill for the theatrical audiences of today,” explained producer Victor Hadida. “You will still find the iconic monsters – but there will also be new designs. We are confident that this new film and Konami’s updated game together will propel the franchise forward for years to come.”\n\nGans wrote the script alongside Sandra Vo-Anh and William Josef Schneider.\n\nVictor Hadida (The Crow, Silent Hill franchises) will produce under his Davis Films banner, with Hassell Free Productions’ Molly Hassell (The Crow) and David Wulf (The Card Counter).\n\nThis will be the third official Silent Hill live action movie, coming in the wake of the Gans-directed Silent Hill in 2006 and 2012 sequel Silent Hill: Revelation, directed by M.J. Bassett.\n\nThe M3GAN Universe will also be expanding next year with a spinoff horror movie titled SOULM8TE, starring Lily Sullivan (Evil Dead Rise, Monolith). After popping heads as Victoria Neuman on Prime Video’s “The Boys,” Deadline reports that actor Claudia Doumit has joined the cast of the horror spinoff.\n\nThe spinoff is being billed as a ’90s-style erotic thriller with a “new technological twist,” and it’s coming to theaters on January 2, 2026.\n\nDoumit will star opposite previously announced leads Sullivan and David Rysdahl, but character details are currently under wraps.\n\nSOULM8TE follows along as “a man (Rysdahl) acquires an Artificially Intelligent android (Sullivan) to help him cope with the recent loss of his deceased wife. In an attempt to create a truly sentient partner, the man inadvertently turns a harmless lovebot into a deadly soulmate.”\n\nKate Dolan (You Are Not My Mother) will direct. The filmmaker rewrote an original draft from Rafael Jordan (Salvage Marines), which was based on a story by James Wan, Ingrid Bisu and Jordan. It’s said to be far more risqué than its parent film.\n\n“Fundamentally, I view this film as an exploration of relationships and loneliness,” Dolan said in a recent statement. “Despite technological advances, there are enduring human truths we cannot escape, and I am looking forward to delving into those depths.”\n\n“SOULM8TE is a thrilling and seductive addition to the M3GAN universe. We’re excited to partner with Kate to bring this story to life with her unique cinematic vision and point of view,” said James Wan, who produces through his company Atomic Monster.\n\nM3GAN was a massive viral hit for Blumhouse back in 2022, the film scaring up $180 million at the worldwide box office. It’s no secret why Blumhouse is all-in on all things M3GAN.\n\nWan and Jason Blum will produce, with Michael Clear and Judson Scott of Wan’s Atomic Monster exec producing alongside Ingrid Bisu. Alayna Glasthal is the executive overseeing the project for Atomic Monster."
