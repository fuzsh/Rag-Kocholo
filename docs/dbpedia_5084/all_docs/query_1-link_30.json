        "text": "Along with new Silent Hill games, the series' movie franchise is set to re-emerge with Return to Silent Hill.\n\nWe'd previously heard about plans for a new movie from director Cristophe Gans (who also directed the original Silent Hill in 2006), but this is the first official confirmation.\n\nA reveal for the film showed concept art, as well as discussion of the idea from Gans and producer Victor Hadida. The new movie will be based on the story of Silent Hill 2, and will be more of a psychological horror. Hadida says that the plan is to \"make it modern, but also very true to the video game,\" and will include familiar monsters (including the iconic Pyramid Head) but updated for the new version.\n\nPreviously, Gans indicated the movie could arrive as soon as next year, seemingly indicating it would be more of a reboot than a sequel.\n\n\"The script for a new Silent Hill movie [is] totally independent from the two previous movies made and respects the way Silent Hill has evolved. Silent Hill is a bit like Twilight Zone, the Fourth Dimension, a place where anything and everything can happen. I worked on a new Silent Hill which is a Silent Hill of the year 2023 since the film would be released next year… in 2023… and not a Silent Hill as I imagined it in 2006,” Gan said at the time.\n\nThe original Silent Hill earned a 5/10 review from IGN. We said, \"Silent Hill is probably the smartest and best-looking video game adaptation yet, it just doesn't have much else going for it. After all, video games are about entertainment, and Silent Hill is a chore to sit through.\"\n\nSince the first Silent Hill, Gans has only directed one other movie, a 2014 version of Beauty and the Beast starring Léa Seydoux and Vincent Cassel. We did get a Silent Hill movie sequel, but we ended up naming it one of the worst game adaptations of all time.\n\nJoe Skrebels is Executive Editor of News at IGN."
