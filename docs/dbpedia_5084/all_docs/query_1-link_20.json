        "text": "Konami has announced that a Silent Hill Transmission will take place on Thursday, May 30, at 4pm PT/7pm ET that will reveal game updates, a \"deeper look at the film,\" and new merch.\n\nThis second Silent Hill Transmission was announced on X/Twitter with no further hints as to what we'll see, but thankfully our wait for answers isn't too long.\n\n\"Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill,\" the official Silent Hill X/Twitter account wrote. \"Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch. #SILENTHILL\"\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe first Silent Hill Transmission took place on October 19, 2022, and included such big reveals as the Silent Hill 2 Remake, the spinoff from No Code Studios called Silent Hill: Townfall, a narrative driven spinoff set in 1960s Japan called Silent Hill f, the immersive project called Silent Hill: Ascension, and the movie titled Return to Silent Hill.\n\nSilent Hill 2 Remake is being developed by Bloober Team and it was given a new trailer back in January 2024 but no release date. Sony may have, however, revealed in a separate trailer featuring a few of its upcoming games that it would be arriving sometime in 2024.\n\nWe haven't been given any updates on the other two games, but Silent Hill: Ascension did come out in 2023. Unfortunately, it wasn't the \"triumphant return to Silent Hill we've been longing for.\"\n\nAs for Return to Silent Hill, we just got a look at the film's version of Pyramid Head back on May 16. This new film that is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, is being directed by the director of the original Silent Hill movie from 2006, Christophe Gans.\n\nThe film will follow \"James (Jeremy Irvine), a man broken after being separated from his one true love (Hannah Emily Anderson). When a mysterious letter calls him back to Silent Hill in search of her, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil\" and \"terrifying figures both familiar and new.\"\n\nHave a tip for us?
