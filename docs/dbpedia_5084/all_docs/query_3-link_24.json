        "text": "It would appear another Silent Hill film is in the works! French movie news website Allociné recently interviewed Christophe Gans and he had a small piece of information to share with regards to the Silent Hill movie franchise!\n\n\"I have two horror film projects with Victor Hadida . I am working on the adaptation of the video game Project Zero. The film will take place in Japan. I certainly don't want to uproot the game from its Japanese haunted house setting. And we're also working on a new Silent Hill . The project will always be anchored in this atmosphere of a small American town, ravaged by Puritanism. I think it's time to make a new one\"\n\nNo other details were shared about these two new films but this is very exciting news! Christophe Gans directed the original Silent Hill movie which I personally enjoyed very much so I am looking forward to what he has planned next for the town of Silent Hill.\n\nYou can read the original article right here where he does talk a little more about the original Silent Hill film as well as the sequel Silent Hill Revelation.\n\nScream Factory has revealed that a Collector's Edition of the original 2006 film is due for release this July!\n\nAlthough no details have been released with regards to special features, it does come with new artwork by Devon Whitehead and a slipcover. The new release is being worked on with Christophe Gans and will be a 2 disc release!\n\nNational street date for North America (Region A) is July 9th.\n\n• Release will come with a slipcover (guaranteed for three months after its original release date).\n\n• The newly-commissioned artwork pictured comes to us from Devon Whitehead (Trick r Treat, Valentine, Sleepwalkers). This art will be front-facing and the reverse side of the wrap will feature alternate theatrical artwork (woman walking towards the town’s sign in the fog).\n\n• Extras will be confirmed on a later date but we can confirm today this will be a 2-disc set and fully-loaded with extras. We are working closely with Director Christopher Gans.\n\nThe film is already up for pre-order priced at $25.99 and first orders also come with a free poster! Unfortunately Scream Factory do not ship worldwide and as of yet no release has been announced for outside of the USA but heres hoping!\n\nYou can pre-order your copy right here.\n\nSilent Hill Paradise fans recently had the opportunity to send in questions for Laurie Holden to answer.\n\nKnown for her role as Cybill Bennett in the original Silent Hill movie as well as Angela in The Walking Dead. She has recently finished working on her latest film Pyewacket.\n\nPyewacket is the story of;\n\n'A frustrated, angst-ridden teenage girl who awakens something in the woods when she naively performs an occult ritual to evoke a witch to kill her mother'\n\nHolden was on board for answering any questions the fans sent her way, find out below if she answered yours and thanks to everyone who submitted a question for her.\n\nQuestion 1 Ryan Shaffer: \"You were also in the film adaptation of Stephen King's ‘The Mist,’ whose source material heavily inspired the original Silent Hill games, and which led you to work with director Frank Darabont again on ‘The Walking Dead.’ What was it like, working on the movie?”\n\nThey always say it’s best when you can work with your friends. That was definitely the case on this film. I had worked with many of the crew previously on “The Majestic” and I was already quite friendly with Jeff DeMunn and Alexa Davalos. It was an intense shoot....but a LOT of fun. Frank Darabont is magic in his element.\n\nQuestion 2 EJ Murray: Is there one type of role that she has not done that she would like to and what makes her really want to explore that role?\n\nI would like to play a CIA operative or a Navy Seal. Why? Because they are BADASS and BRAVE...and I love kicking ass.\n\nQuestion 3 Fernando DA: Hi Laurie! My question is with regards to your thoughts on the silent hill franchise when you first stepped into your role. Did you realise how big and amazing this franchise was, along with the dedication fans have to it? I'm so happy you were able to be a part of it, and here's hoping in some way you get to come back to it (prequel, tv series, etc)!\n\nI knew going in how incredible the “Silent Hill”franchise was because I was a fan of the video game. I was over the moon to take on the role of Cybil...I loved everything about that character. Oh, and a tv series would be AMAZING.\n\nQuestion 4 Henrietta Darcy: Which are more scary, Walkers, or Silent Hill Monsters?\n\nSilent Hill Monsters for sure!!!\n\nQuestion 5 William Prosser: What has been your favourite role so far and why?\n\nMy favourite role so far has been The Mother in Pyewacket. You will get it when you see it....it was a very complex and challenging role (or shall I say TWO ROLES!) I loved everything about the dynamics between the characters. It was all just so very authentic and REAL.\n\nPyewacket is available to purchase or rent from Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.com now!"
