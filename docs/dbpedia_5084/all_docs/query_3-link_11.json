        "text": "Konami has premiered a behind-the-scenes featurette for the upcoming “Return to Silent Hill” film, which will see Christophe Gans, who directed the original 2006 film adaptation of the game franchise, return to the helm.\n\nJeremy Irvine (“Treadstone”) and Hannah Emily Anderson (“Jigsaw”) lead the cast of the new film which is directly based on the most acclaimed entry in the game series – “Silent Hill 2”. It also reportedly takes inspiration from Hideo Kojima’s famed “P.T.” short game.\n\nIrvine stars as James, a man devastated after being separated from his soulmate and receives a mysterious letter that leads him back to a town called Silent Hill, where he hopes to find her.\n\nHe discovers that the town has been changed by some unknown malevolent force. As James descends deeper into the darkness, he encounters terrifying figures both familiar and new and begins to question his own sanity as he struggles to make sense of reality and hold on long enough to save his lost love.\n\nGans shot the film in Germany last year with a script by Gans, Sandra Vo-Anh, and Will Schneider.\n\nThe 2006 film adaptation starring Radha Mitchell, Laurie Holden and Sean Bean was well-received critically and grossed $100 million worldwide off a $50 million budget.\n\nGans wasn’t involved in the poorly-received 2012 sequel “Silent Hill: Revelation”. Victor Hadida, Molly Hassell and David Wulf are producing.\n\n“Return to Silent Hill” has yet to set a release date."
