        "text": "The first image from Return to Silent Hill reveals the movie version of Pyramid Head, the famed monster from the video game series.\n\nThings are starting to take shape with the film adaptation of Silent Hill 2, as today, Variety debuted the first image of arguably one of the franchise's most terrifying and iconic villains, Pyramid Head. The live-action version of the character wears a massive iron helmet that conceals their face and a large section of their body.\n\nThe movie iteration of Pyramid Head also equips them with the villain's iconic weapon, many will know as the Great Knife, as he stands menacingly behind some rusty iron bars, which are bent out of shape, giving fans a better look at the fearsome figure (who, in the past, has taken inspiration from an executioner in Braveheart).\n\nPyramid Head first debuted in Silent Hill 2 and has appeared in many other Silent Hill games since. It has even made guest appearances in Super Bomberman R and Dead by Daylight. IGN ranked Silent Hill 2 as the scariest game of all time, with the character's reveal being one of our most unforgettable video game moments.\n\nChristophe Gans, the director of the original Silent Hill movie from 2006, is back to helm Return to Silent Hill. He has also co-written the script with Sandra Vo-Anh and William Josef Schneider. Victor Hadida has boarded the project as a producer under his Davis Films banner with Hassell Free Productions' Molly Hassell and David Wulf.\n\nUpcoming New Video Game Movies and TV Shows: 2024 Release Dates and Beyond\n\nThe film will follow \"James (Jeremy Irvine), a man broken after being separated from his one true love (Hannah Emily Anderson). When a mysterious letter calls him back to Silent Hill in search of her, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil\" and \"terrifying figures both familiar and new.\"\n\nIn other words, Pyramid Head will not be the only foe lurking in the Return to Silent Hill movie when it eventually hits screens.\n\nImage credit: Aleksandar Letic."
