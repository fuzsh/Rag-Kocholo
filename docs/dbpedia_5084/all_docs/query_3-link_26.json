Concerned about Sharon's sleepwalking episodes, Rose decides to take her to the eerie town of Silent Hill. As they arrive, Rose loses sight of her daughter, leading her on a desperate search through the foggy, ash-covered streets of the town. Along the way, she encounters terrifying creatures and unravels the dark secrets that plague Silent Hill.\n\nDirector Christophe Gans first mentioned the idea of adapting the 1999 video game Silent Hill to producer Samuel Hadida while they were working together on the film Brotherhood of the Wolf in 2001. Hadida recognized the game's visually stunning aesthetics and believed that Gans's extensive knowledge of cinematography would be a perfect fit for the eerie storytelling of Silent Hill. Gans had already been familiar with the video game series for about six years before making the film and initially intended to adapt the second game, released in 2001, due to its emotional depth and popularity among fans. He likened its story to the myth of Orpheus descending into the underworld for Eurydice.\n\nHowever, Gans realized that Silent Hill 2 lacked the true essence of the Silent Hill universe, as it didn't delve into the city's mythology and merely used it as a backdrop for the narrative. Consequently, he concluded that it would be impossible to adapt the second game without exploring the origins of the mysterious town.\n\nSilent Hill Locations\n\nSilent Hill, the 2006 horror film based on the popular video game franchise, was primarily filmed in Ontario, Canada.
