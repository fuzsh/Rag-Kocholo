        "text": "View: https://twitter.com/killer_se7ven/status/1578301667476660224\n\nChristophe Gans is the director of the first Silent Hill film, didn't work at all on the second one, is directing the upcoming reboot to the film series, which starts filming next February. He did a video interview, and uhhh, he said a LOT.\n\nA few direct quotes thanks to Angie :\n\n\"I know a bit about the [next Silent Hill game]. I work with the Silent Team, the original creators. I work in collaboration with Konami.\"\n\n\"I'm working with the Silent Team, the original creators at Konami, there are several games in development as we speak, there are several teams on it, with a big line of games, they will revive the franchise, I think they were really impressed of the success of the remakes of Resident Evil that are evidently exceptional games.\"\n\n\"I'm not working directly on the games but I'm working with Konami but not with Kojima, tho, but with the Silent Team who I met when I filmed the first Silent Hill movie.\"\n\n\"And they're still here\"\n\n\"In this second movie, I'll try to explain that Silent Hill is a place that owes as much to the creatures that live there as what we project on the town. So I'll enter into something way more psychological and way more psychoanalytic in order to try to make people understand that Silent Hill isn't only this strange labyrinth that changes its form but also the projection of tortured and tormented souls and sometimes of extremely paradoxical feelings that can be between mad love and violence.\"\n\nInterviewer: \"So who are developing the games?\"\n\nChristophe: \"It's Konami, there are several games.\"\n\nInterviewer: \"Because we know Bloober Team are working on Silent Hill 2 Remake\"\n\nChristophe: \"Yes\"\n\nInterviewer: \"And we don't know who's developing the others.\"\n\nChristophe: \"Yeah, there are several teams.\"\n\n------\n\nIn basic, he confirmed there's several Silent Hill projects in development right now in Konami and between several different teams, he's seen some stuff off of one Silent Hill game that's being worked on by people who worked on the original four Silent Hill games who he worked with back in the 2000s on the first film who are also working on this game revival. Confirms Bloober is working on a Silent Hill 2 Remake, confirms several of the series original creators and developers are working on these projects.\n\nHe also talks some about how his next film is planned to be more psychological and to focus on the strange reality of the town of Silent Hill itself.\n\nI'm honestly flabbergasted he was allowed to say that much, but very interesting!\n\nThe interviewer was very smart.\n\nInstead of asking if Bloober or whoever is working on what, he speaks of it like it's common knowledge to drop the guy's guard and just confirm stuff.\n\nSuprised they didn't ask him when was going to be announced.\n\nYeah, you're ahead of where I am but I get the sense that's what happened too, interviewer played it coy and acted like all of this was public knowledge already, which I think made Gans think it was all already out there now. If there really is a Silent Hill announcement this month in relation to Short Message as speculated, that also might've confused him since its October already, but that's speculation on my part (this interview seems to have happened in early October).\n\nWhy would I be joking? Gans talks out of his ass all the time. Why the fuck would he have access to intimate knowledge on MULTIPLE Silent Hill game projects?\n\nBecause he's working on a Silent Hill movie that's starting filming next February, and is working with Konami on that film as part of a larger plan to revive Silent Hill.\n\nBecause he's working on a Silent Hill movie that's starting filming next February, and is working with Konami on that film as part of a larger plan to revive Silent Hill.\n\nOr he's just bullshitting and using the same talking points the internet has been yammering about for over a year now. Like this \"movie\" of his hasn't even hit the film industry trades yet - despite him repeatedly trying to bring it up in interviews - and it's supposed to be filming in a few months? The film industry has a much more ordered production cycle than the game industry and the fact he's the only one who has said anything about it just feels like aspirational talk rather than reality.\n\nThe MGS movie is probably further along than this project and the MGS movie also doesn't exist.\n\nThe movie was pretty decent as far as game adaptations go\n\nIt kinda butchered every aspect of the lore and really only succeeded in LOOKING like Silent Hill. Yeah, it's not \"bottom of the barrel\" game adaptation status but it's still a bad movie and a bad translation of Silent Hill.\n\nI think the secrecy of projects is an industry-made problem at this point that snowballed into something huge.\n\nCompanies are desperately trying to control the image and narrative about their products, to the point they're willing, freaking terrified about answering the most ignorant and mean-spirited arguments instead of trying to convey reality like it is.\n\nOf course the usual costumer won't know games early in dev look like shit, will get frustrated about things changing and being cancelled all the time, but if you keep focusing on them like the most important aspect of the conversation you're never getting out of that hole, they'll feel validated and execs will fear losing control to them always.\n\nI'm impressed CD Projekt Red talked openly on what they're working and that's the stuff this industry needs.\n\nI understand creators want to show their work when it is ready, it's just that at this point it is getting ridiculously harmful especially when dumb suits punish devs themselves out of panic.\n\nHollywood gets it (for all their insane list of mistakes too).\n\nThings change, some cool stuff never see the light of the day and yes, it is sad, but we don't have to be held hostage by angry internet posters acting like manchilds."
