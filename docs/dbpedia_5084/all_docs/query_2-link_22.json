        "text": "I debated if I should be the one to make this thread or not, but it is new news.\n\nChristophe Gans, the director of the 2006 Silent Hill movie (had no involvement with the 2012 Silent Hill Revelations 3D) sat down for a 50 minute video interview with JEUXACTU (French website) because his movie, Le Pacte des Loups (great film, one of Bloodborne's inspirations), is getting re-released into France theaters currently. Can see the interview here, but the video is region restricted for most territories (not France though), and the entire interview is in French:\n\nHowever, there is a part of the interview where he talks very directly about Silent Hill. I got this confirmed by a few French speakers myself that this is what he was saying, but a proper written translation bringing attention to this was first provided by a very niche gaming site named, \"Gamingsym\", their article is here: https://gamingsym.in/christophe-gans-confirms-that-konami-is-working-well-on-several-games/\n\nAnd Gamingsym's translation of what Gans says, which I've had confirmed is accurate from all who I've checked with. What he says:\n\nIn fact, what happens is that… And we know it, it's in the thing… The franchise (Silent Hill, editor's note) is going to be relaunched in terms of video games, and therefore the film will become part of a global policy. I believe that on a forum, someone deduced that and he is absolutely right; in other words, the film is indeed part of a whole. I'm not saying that it was Konami who asked us to make a new film, it just so happens that a few months before the start of the pandemic, we are at the beginning of 2020, with Victor Hadida, following the death of Samuel (Hadida, his big brother editor's note), we went through all the rights that Samuel had acquired and we said to ourselves… We have the Fatal Frame franchise and the Silent Hill license, we have to do something about it.\n\nWhat I can say is that the film is rolling. I work with Konami. Konami's are all about it and I think they've been galvanized by the success of the Resident Evil 2 and 3 reboots, which are marvelous games, we have to give Caesar what belongs to Caesar.\n\nIn basic, he talks about how he's gained the rights to use the Silent Hill IP from Konami & the Fatal Frame IP from Tecmo officially, he's doing the Silent Hill movie first and it's \"further along than just talks\". He then says on online forums, there'd been deductions (rumors) that his film is part of a larger \"Global Policy\" for a revival of the franchise, and confirms the online rumors are true, that there's several Silent Hill projects in the works (even specifically confirms there's Silent Hill video games in the works). He also mentions Resident Evil directly, saying Konami had looked at the recent Resident Evil 2 Remake and other things for how to revive a horror IP. He didn't pitch his Silent Hill movie to be part of this initiative to revive the series, it just so happened the timing ended up working out so his film became part of a bigger multi-project effort to revive the series.\n\nMore smoke, as it were. Maybe too much smoke.\n\nI wish they got someone more fitting than Christophe Gans to do the film, though. Silent Hill (2006) was unsubtle, tropey, and more of a slasher-ish blockbuster film than the psychological horror the games were.\n\nAside from that, my only concern is that I hope those quotes aren't saying Konami is copying the modern Resident Evil games and Resident Evil 2 directly.\n\nMy opinion on upcoming projects in general:\n\nRooting for the Masahiro Ito and Sony game the most.\n\nAn Annapurna Interactive Silent Hill definitely sounds interesting.\n\nLess positive on the Bloober Team game.\n\nThis is just a bit of my opinion, but I'm keeping in mind that the 2000s were a rough period for horror films in general, they tended to go for this certain overtly color tinted look, with slasher elements mixed with over-the-top violence, certain filming techniques, etc. I think the 2006 SH movie sorta' reflected what a lot of horror in the 2000s looked like, just with enough SH influence & aesthetic over it to keep it a bit more interesting than some other output in the same year (and even though I know fans have big issues with the less interesting & more streamlined approach to the cult by basically making it a witch trial thing and making Alessa evil & a threat, the actual story of the movie is relatively easy to follow & well told, with some good character & narrative moments).\n\nI can comment that your concern you don't need to worry too much about. While they looked at RE, there's also been to my understanding a lot of focus on what made Silent Hill itself good to begin with and strike with so many. To see how the various devs pull off their visions, but they are there to make Silent Hill games, and not Resident Evil games."
