        "text": "The Silent Hill game franchise has been considered among players to be one of the biggest influences in the horror genre. Between its thought-provoking plots and truly unnerving monsters, complemented by the incredibly atmospheric music composed in most installments by Akira Yamaoka, it’s no wonder that the first game was chosen to be adapted into a feature film.\n\nIn April 2006, Silent Hill broke into theaters in the United States. I was still rather new to the world of horror gaming. With no real context or knowledge of the series, I went to see the movie anyway. Now I know that although the story of the film may change several key concepts about the plot (Rose taking the place of Harry being the biggest one and focusing hard on the whole, “Mother is God in the eyes of a child” thing). Overall, the film wasn’t necessarily a masterpiece. Still, there was something in that movie that amazed me: The incredible police officer Cybil Bennett, portrayed by the gorgeous Laurie Holden.\n\nCybil initially appears in the movie as a motorcycle-riding, no-nonsense, dedicated, driven cop. She even wears riding-appropriate attire, donning a leather jacket and a helmet! I immediately admired her for not only looking awesome but being smart. (I know wearing her sunglasses at night isn’t at all practical, but it still made her look tough and cool, okay?) However, what sealed the deal for me was in her first scene against a monster. A shambling creature approaches and spews noxious, acidic black goo all over Cybil, who stumbles away for a moment before ripping her helmet off. The rage on her face as she turns back around and fires on the monster, her short platinum blonde pixie cut mussed in this super slick and sexy way… I was taken aback at the level of unabashedly badass this character was. It might also have been one of the first times I realized I thought girls were cute.\n\nIn a world full of horror adaptations, it seems many of them feature women with shoulder-length or longer hair (looking at you, Alice from Resident Evil), which I couldn’t identify with because I’d always kept my hair on the much shorter side. When Cybil graced the screen, it was incredibly refreshing to see that the film had shunned some of the more Hollywood-insisted “feminine” aspects that many female leads get pigeonholed into. She had short hair, she literally kicked ass, she carried confidence on her left and cunning on her right; she was a fighter that exhibited courage to the very end.\n\nLaurie Holden gave a performance that was moving and empowering, especially to a teenage girl looking for new role models (even if they were fictional). I had experimented with my hairstyle and color for years, but I will be damned if Holden’s short blonde pixie cut didn’t inspire me to keep my hair short and, years later, be comfortable being a blonde bombshell. Cybil’s portrayal of strength and powerful, capable femininity was a mind-blowing concept for me. I have seen some women in horror films be fearless and tough, but in the face of nightmarish abominations and the fires of misguided cults, Cybil remains at the top of my list for one of the baddest bitches in cinema.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie may not be the greatest, and it definitely changes things from its source material, but Silent Hill gave me more than entertainment value. Because of Cybil, I found the ability to embrace my own strength in a way that is both powerful and feminine. I have developed an appreciation for the horror genre and its representation of women. I have gained confidence in rocking short hair. Most of all, however, I experienced a whirlwind of inspiration that has stuck with me for the last 18 years.\n\nRegarding film festivals, one of the unsung heroes is always the short films. Unfortunately, it seems most publications pay them little to no mind, and that’s a crying shame. Some of the best filmmakers got their start by making short films and so many future stars have short films on the festival circuit today. Let’s take a look at the short films of the Tokyo Horror Film Festival.\n\nStand Out Shorts Fresh From Tokyo Horror Film Festival\n\nKneading\n\nDirected by Lulu & Augie Syracuse\n\nWritten by Lulu Syracuse\n\nAn office worker pisses their boss off when they forget to feed the office cat. Surely this will be a normal exchange!\n\nKneading is short, sweet, and to the point. Lulu and Augie Syracuse have crafted an incredibly weird and atmospheric short film with a stinger you won’t see coming a mile away. The practical effect work gets the job done and leaves a lasting impact. There’s a lot of potential within this two-and-a-half-minute short, and it will be interesting to see where they go from here.\n\nBackward Creep\n\nWritten and Directed by Christopher G. Moore\n\nThree friends are en route to an anime convention, but their plans are stopped in their tracks after they run over a pedestrian.\n\nDelightfully campy, Backward Creep excels in one thing: giving audiences a good time. There’s not much to this short, and that’s fine. We have three friends who ran something over and it gets its revenge. It’s simple, in the best way possible. Some shorts try to overcompensate for their short runtimes; Moore doesn’t do that. He puts it all out there and lets you exist within this world for just a few minutes. Supposedly, there is a feature version of this in the works. If Moore keeps the feature fully practical and keeps the gnarly creature design, I’m sold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChateau Sauvignon: terroir\n\nWritten by David M. Night Maire and Allyssa Rivera-Cabrero\n\nDirected by David M. Night Maire\n\nA young boy and his father run a winery that might be more nefarious than it seems.\n\nLike a fine wine, Chateau Sauvignon: terroir feels a bit pretentious. It takes itself very seriously and constantly withholds from the viewer. Night Maire and Rivera-Cabrero’s script ends up feeling a bit too smart for its own good. Michael Lorz charismatically, and creepily, leads this short with the exhausted vigor of a young adult resigned to a life of depravity. The practical effects in this short look gorgeous and impactful. It’ll make you think twice before going back to a winery, that’s for sure.\n\nTen of Swords\n\nWritten and Directed by Faye Jackson\n\nWhat would happen if you woke up dead, destined to a life of forced labor? Would you take it on the chin, or fight back?\n\nLet’s see a show of hands if you had no clue Ten of Swords was a tarot card reference. (Raises hand.) Ten of Swords has a lot to say. It comments on forced labor, predestination (to an extent), and the human condition. Jackson’s script does a decent job of getting the point across, but the short really feels like it just goes beat to beat without any real visual flow. Overall, it’s an enjoyable watch with some great action and practical effects. The set and production design is impeccable and provides excellent world-building for this dystopian future. Knowing now, what tarot card this short references feels a bit on the nose with some of the visuals, but that doesn’t mean it’s not impactful.\n\nGrease Bunny\n\nWritten and Directed by Benedetto Cocuzza\n\nAfter a long day of work, Stacy (Haley Hammonds) gets home and orders a pizza. What could go wrong?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Benedetto Cocuzza might ring a bell for a few of you. He is the founder of the indie horror video game studio Puppet Combo. I’ll be able to put my bias aside, but there isn’t a single Puppet Combo game I don’t consider a 5 out of 5. Cocuzza’s PlayStation 1 low-res style just tickles that nostalgic spot in my brain that reminds me of my childhood. If you think his short films would be stylistically different from his games, you’re wrong. Grease Bunny is a liminal body horror nightmare, dripping with grease, cheese, and pepperoni. Hammond’s campy acting perfectly embodies the Puppet Combo style, though it could possibly be a turnoff for those who aren’t familiar with Cocuzza’s style. If you’ve ever wondered what a giant pepperoni pizza monster nibbling on someone’s toes would look like, then Grease Bunny is the short film for you.\n\nAlso, go check out Puppet Combo’s games; they’re truly excellent.\n\nSupport indie game devs!\n\nBeverly Hills Exorcist\n\nWritten and Directed by Rem Scobell\n\nA group of exorcists in Beverly Hills attempt to exorcise a house from a giant-headed demon.\n\nI’ll be upfront here, Beverly Hills Exorcist didn’t work for me. There’s a line of camp I can accept and enjoy…this short leaps over that line. The acting feels forced and unrehearsed and it all just happens too fast. Too much character development for too many characters happens in such a short amount of time and it feels overstuffed. Scobell’s idea is fun and could possibly work in a larger sense, but as a short film, it doesn’t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBody\n\nWritten and Directed by Ronald Short\n\nAn electronic Frankenstein toy makes its way into a couple’s house…and it’s moving!\n\nBody is incredibly cute. The entire short takes place in the kitchen with Dawn (Leila Anastasia Scott) and Jack (Aaron G. Hale). Scott and Hale are incredibly adorable together and exhibit one of the most believable relationships I’ve seen in a short film. Short has created a short film that should be studied by those who want to make short films. What he created with one prop, two actors, [presumably] one camera, and some fake blood is beyond impressive. Very little happens in this short, but it’s what happens and how it happens that makes this short film charming and exciting.\n\nThe Pencil\n\nWritten by Madina Schultz and Thomas Schultz\n\nDirected by Thomas Shultz\n\nSara (Mika Saruar) is an artist struggling to make ends meet. One day she finds a pencil that brings her drawings to life; flowers, money…monsters.\n\nOne of my favorite things about festival coverage is when I see a good short at a festival, and then another festival, and another, etc. At this point, I think I’ve seen The Pencil at four different festivals, and it’s well deserved. Coming in at just over 10 minutes, The Pencil tells a harrowing tale of struggle and love. Schultz’s script is tight and precise, and it gets its point across with enough time to play around a little bit. After seeing this short for the first time, I had nightmares of the short film’s creature. Well, guess what’s back in my nightmares now! The Pencil is a perfectly crafted short film that NEEDS a feature-length version.\n\nIf you get a chance to see any of these shorts at a film festival near you, be sure you do!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShudder is taking Hot Girl Summer to heart this August. This month’s press release was small but mighty, and I am canceling my plans to fit all these titles into my schedule. Before I tell you about the five movies I’m most excited to see on the streamer, I have to point out they are dropping a new original series called Horror’s Greatest on August 27th. It’s described as a deep dive into everything we love about horror. So, I expect it to be at least 1000 episodes long, and I love that for me. Anyway, here are the five movies I am not going to stop talking about this month.\n\nAnd as always, if you don’t have a Shudder sub, get one here!\n\nThe Best Movies to Stream on Shudder This Month\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nA serial killer with a bladed glove preys on teens as they sleep. I am a Petty Freddy stan account, so I live my best life every time the original film comes to Shudder. This remains one of the best films in the franchise. It is also arguably one of the most cherished films on Wes Craven’s resume.\n\nYou can watch A Nightmare on Elm Street on August 1st.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDancing Village: The Curse Begins (2024)\n\nA supernatural entity terrorizes a village. I have never seen an Indonesian horror movie that didn’t mess me up. So, of course, I will be hitting play on this new nightmare fuel the second it’s available on the streamer. I’m ready to see this spirit run through this town like the Tomb Raider.\n\nYou can watch Dancing Village: The Curse Begins on August 16th.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Deeper You Dig (2019)\n\nThe line between the living and the dead collapses after a roadside accident. I was late to The Adams Family party, so I still need to see this one. I’m thinking I might double feature it because their new movie Hell Hole will arrive on the streamer fresh from the Fantasia Film Festival on August 23. Seems like a disturbing family night to me, and I am ready.\n\nYou can watch The Deeper You Dig on August 19th.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness (1994)\n\nAn investigator realizes that there is more than meets the eye when it comes to an author’s horror stories. They had my attention because someone read a horror writer’s work. That’s the dream, even if some people are probably about to go through it in this movie. This John Carpenter movie stars Sam Neill, and I am surprised (and ashamed) that this will be my first watch. Thanks for helping a girl out, Shudder!\n\nYou can watch In The Mouth Of Madness on August 1st.\n\nWes Craven’s New Nightmare (1994)\n\nAn evil entity uses the character of Freddy Kruger as a gateway to our world. This is my other favorite movie in the franchise. It might also be where I started to learn the definition of meta. Seeing the cast, who made the movie I loved, come back to play versions of themselves terrorized by Petty Freddy is one of my favorite childhood memories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can watch Wes Craven’s New Nightmare on August 1st.\n\nShudder really didn’t come to play this month, and I’m here for it. I am probably parked on the app while you are reading this. To which, I say, close your mobile device and turn on your TV, friend. It’s time!"
