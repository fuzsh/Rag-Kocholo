It titillates them to not know what’s going to jump out from the shadow as they willingly head towards it. I’m a fan of powerful, working lights.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nA horror scaredy-cat reviews Silent Hill: Downpour Back to video\n\nSo I’ve never touched a game like Silent Hill: Downpour. Deciding to embark on a new experience, I gave Konami’s eighth title in the long-running survival horror series a try. As a standalone title, it didn’t need a deep knowledge of the existing canon. All I needed to know was that its goal was to scare me.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman, and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nWell, it’d be unfair to say that was the only motivation. Downpour tells the story of convict Murphy Pendleton, a reluctant anti-hero thrust into the strange, macabre world of monsters and demons, both around him and within.Pendleton is in jail, where we see that he’s in the pocket of a corrupt guard. The guard wants him to kill a sequestered child molester, who Pendleton mercilessly beats to death in a shower. He then gets moved to a maximum security prison. On the way, the transport crashes, killing everyone but Pendleton and one relentlessly ignorant corrections officer. After running through the woods, he eventually finds himself in the creepy town of Silent Hill.\n\nThe objective is simple, and the game makes a point of telling you that: Escape from Silent Hill. Why? Well, by now, you’ve been attacked by monsters you can’t explain — shrieking, zombie-like women with nails through their bodies, lanky, pale-skinned lurking creatures that drop down on top of you and a few town residents that offer you cryptic answers to your questions. Oh, and the occasional dimensional break into “Otherworld,” a place where you’re constantly fleeing a glowing red energy that wants to rip you apart. A charming vacation hotspot, really. It’s an interesting story, with the appropriate suspension of disbelief. Themes of guilt play heavily throughout, with the whole world of Silent Hill easily becoming an analogy of Hell, where debts and crimes are repaid through torment.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt’s scary. It succeeds at that. It definitely succeeded in making me jump in my seat when my cell phone said I had a new Facebook message. In Downpour, there are moments where you feel helpless, wanting nothing more than to stay in the same place with your trusty fire axe clutched to your chest. With the different ways that enemies attack you, pressing the left button to get a look behind you is very helpful, along with being a great camera angle.\n\nThe way the camera behaves in a horror game feels integral to the genre. Certain scenes force perspective, and many of the puzzles and mysteries require you to approach them from a different angle. They’re not particularly challenging. Many of them are going through a level to find a dead end, only to circle back around to find the object that allows you to get past that dead end, often with some enemies ready to pop out. So you better grab a weapon.\n\nWeapons are plentiful, but Downpour gets back to basics with how it feels to use one. A plank of wood breaks quicker than a wrench. A harpoon may splinter, but will still be useful. Also, just because an enemy is down doesn’t mean they’re out. I don’t know whether it was rage at being taken by surprise, but nothing satisfied me more than hacking away at a grounded enemy — making sure they wouldn’t get back up. The health system was similar. The limp of Murphy’s gait and the bloodiness of his shirt determined how badly hurt he was.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPaying attention means heavy use of your trusty flashlight (in both normal and ultraviolet modes) and a lot of Downpour is finding the object you can interact with in any given room. It felt both uninspired and sluggish, especially when constantly reaching into the map and objectives menu, which is in the form of a logbook. Flipping between the pages was tiresome, and zooming in and out of a very rigid map system proved more annoying than informative. For a game that has a good number of side quests, this could have been much more helpful. Those side quests, by the way, are part of the few moments where you’re left in the open world that is Silent Hill.\n\nThe real success of this game is in its music. Daniel Licht, composer on Showtime’s Dexter along with countless horror movies, creates an incredible feel to this game. Play with headphones on. The way he uses strings alone will create a terror solely in your head. The sound direction is also crucial to the terror, from endless whispers bouncing off the walls to the giggle of children. Nothing is scarier than giggling children in the dark.\n\nHowever, that goal of fear is its own worst enemy. What scared me at the top of the game was expected in the middle. An enemy could pop out at me and I would know how to kill it efficiently, and without a frantic heartbeat. It became a game, but thankfully, the developers realized that the psychological anguish of Murphy Pendleton is much more worthwhile than cheap scares.\n\nBut I’m still keeping the lights on during my next review of a horror game.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
