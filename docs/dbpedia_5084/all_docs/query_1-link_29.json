Follow us on Facebook / Twitter / Instagram\n\nReturn to Silent Hill, a new film adaptation of the famous video game saga created by Keiichiro Toyama and distributed by Konami, was officially announced to be released soon under the direction of Christopher Gans. That's excellent news for horror fans and gamers.\n\nBut how many movies exist in the Silent Hill franchise? Unlike its rival, Resident Evil, there are only two Silent Hill films made before the unreleased Return to Silent Hill. That's a low number, considering how popular the video game front of the franchise is.\n\nSilent Hill\n\nThe first film in the franchise is Christophe Gans' Silent Hill, released in 2006. The story is loosely based on the first instalment of the video game series and follows Rose, a mother who brings her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, which the young girl mentions in frequent sleepwalking episodes.\n\nRose is involved in a car accident near the city and wakes up to find Sharon has disappeared. During the ensuing search, the protagonist stumbles upon a mysterious cult that seems to know of a dark connection that ties the little girl to the town's past. Silent Hill earned about 100 million at the global box office but mainly received negative reviews; to date, it has a score of 32% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSilent Hill: Revelation\n\nMJ Bassett wrote and directed the second film, Silent Hill: Revelation, which was released in 2012. The film had a problematic production to begin with, with original director Christophe Gans abandoning the project following the departure of producer and screenwriter Roger Avary, who was arrested for vehicular homicide.\n\nRevelation eventually arrived in theatres six years after the original film's release, with a cast that included Martin Donovan, Carrie-Anne Moss, the great Sean Bean, and even a young Kit Harington, making his big-screen debut after his exploits with the first season of Game of Thrones, released in 2011.\n\nThe film's plot concerns Heather Mason, who realizes on the eve of her 18th birthday that her assumed identity is false: from that point on, she is drawn to another world in the American town of Silent Hill. The flop, in this case, was much more pronounced, grossing only 56 million worldwide and being trashed outright by the trade press (the brutal Rotten Tomatoes score is 8%).\n\nIn case you missed it: Resident Evil 4 remake will not be a short game.\n\nAccording to the first information released, Return to Silent Hill will be inspired by the Myth of Orpheus and will feature a story inspired by the video game Silent Hill 2. The film does not yet have a release date, so stay tuned for all upcoming updates.\n\nHave you watched any of the Silent Hill movies? Let us know in the comments!"
