The film was followed by a sequel, Silent Hill: Revelation (2012). In 2022, a third film titled Return to Silent Hill was officially announced, which will adapt the video game Silent Hill 2 (2001).\n\nThe series has grossed $156 million at the box office worldwide and has received generally negative reviews from critics.\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director(s) Screenwriter(s) Producer(s) Status Original series Silent Hill April 21, 2006 Christophe Gans Roger Avary\n\nChristophe Gans\n\nNicolas Boukhrief Samuel Hadida\n\nDon Carmody Released Silent Hill: Revelation October 26, 2012 M.

Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Jodelle Ferland, Deborah Kara Unger, and Alice Krige, among others, were cast into the film. Bean's character did not appear in the initial screenplay and was added by Gans later, due to the producer's concerns over a lack of male characters.[citation needed] The film was shot in Ontario, Canada, as well as sound stages, and was released to theaters in the U.S. on April 21, 2006.\n\nSilent Hill: Revelation (2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: Revelation\n\nFollowing Gans' departure with the project in 2007, Lionsgate brought on director M. J. Bassett in 2010, and announced the title as Silent Hill: Revelation 3D.[5] The film featured several returning characters from its predecessor, and serves as a direct sequel to the first film, rather than as an adaptation of another game. However, the film does feature elements from the 2003 video game Silent Hill 3, such as the inclusion of character Heather Mason, as well as the entirety of the plot, minus the character Pyramid Head, who is from the game Silent Hill 2.\n\nSilent Hill: Revelation was released theatrically in Canada on October 26, 2012.\n\nReturn to Silent Hill (TBA)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Return to Silent Hill\n\nIn October 2012, Bassett stated that if a sequel to Revelation was made, it would adapt stories from the graphic novels, rather than the video games.[6]\n\nIn January 2020, Christophe Gans stated during an interview that he was working on a new film in the series with Victor Hadida.[7] In June 2022, Gans stated that he was working on the film and expected it to be released in 2023.[8][9]\n\nOn October 19, 2022, Konami officially announced that a new film was in development, titled Return to Silent Hill, with Gans returning to direct and Victor Hadida serving as a producer. The film will be based on the 2001 video game Silent Hill 2 and will feature the return of Pyramid Head.[10][11] It will be written by Gans, Sandra Vo-Ahn, and Will Schneider.[12] In February 2023, Deadline reported that Return to Silent Hill had secured funding and would begin filming soon.[13] In March 2023, Deadline also reported that Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson were cast in the film's lead roles, with filming set to begin in April.[14]\n\nRecurring cast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nList indicator(s)\n\nThis section includes characters who will appear or have appeared in more than two films in the series.\n\nAn empty, dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film, or that the character's official presence has not yet been confirmed.\n\nA indicates an appearance through archival footage or audio.\n\nC indicates a cameo role.\n\nO indicates an older version of the character.\n\nP indicates an appearance in onscreen photographs.\n\nY indicates a younger version of the character.\n\nCharacter Original series Reboot Silent Hill Silent Hill\n\nRevelation Return to\n\nSilent Hill 2006 2012 TBA Rose Da Silva Radha Mitchell Radah Mitchell Christopher \"Chris\" Da Silva\n\nHarry Mason Sean Bean Sharon Da Silva\n\nHeather Mason Jodelle Ferland Adelaide Clemens Jodelle Ferland Erin Pitt Alessa Gillespie Jodelle Ferland Erin Pitt Lorry Ayers Jodelle Ferland Dahlia Gillespie Deborah Kara Unger Pyramid Head Roberto Campanella TBA Lisa Garland\n\nRed Nurse Emily Lineham Cybill Bennett Laurie Holden Christabella LaRoache Alice Krige Mentioned Officer Thomas Gucci Kim Coates Anna Tanya Allen Sister Margaret Eve Crawford Eve Crawford Eleanor Nicky Guadagni Adam Chris Britton Vincent Smith Kit Harington Douglas Cartland Martin Donovan Leonard Wolf Malcolm McDowell Claudia Wolf\n\nThe Missionary Carrie-Anne MossLiise Keeling Travis Grady Peter Outerbridge Suki Heather Marks James Sunderland Jeremy Irvine Mary Hannah Emily Anderson\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office performance\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Revenue Budget References Domestic International Worldwide Silent Hill $46.98 million $53.6 million $100.6 million $50 million [15] Silent Hill: Revelation $17.5 million $37.8 million $55.36 million $20 million [16]\n\nCritical and public response\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic CinemaScore Silent Hill 31% (105 reviews)[17] 31 (21 reviews)[18] C Silent Hill: Revelation 8% (59 reviews)[19] 16 (14 reviews)[20] C\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Format U.S. release date Distributor Notes Silent Hill DVD, Blu-ray, UMD August 22, 2006 Sony Pictures Home Entertainment [21] Blu-ray July 9, 2019 Scream Factory Remastered two-disc collector's edition with new bonus features.[22] Silent Hill: Revelation DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D Feb 12, 2013 Universal Studios Home Entertainment [23]"
