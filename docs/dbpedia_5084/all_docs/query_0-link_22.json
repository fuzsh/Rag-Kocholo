        "text": "Conclusion:\n\nAn Endless Nightmare\n\nSurvive, you must have the will\n\nThis movie doesn't end the way we want all the time\n\n…\n\nNow it's too late, too late for me\n\nThis town will win\n\nToo late, too late for me\n\nThis town will win\n\n—Hometown from SH3 soundtrack\n\nIn order to bring some light on the dark world of Silent Hill, I have chosen to concentrate on an analysis of the experiential route through the resort town. I'm inclined to think that such detailed critical inspection of the fiction, artifact, and gameplay emotions elicited by the games is the best way to show both the greatness and the importance of Silent Hill. Inasmuch as they present the main elements and set the core game mechanics that make the series what is, I've also given more attention to SH1, SH2, and SH3. SH: 0rigins, the prequel, SH: Shattered Memories, the reimagining of SH1, and SH: Homecoming follow the path mapped out by Team Silent, and so I did too. But consequently, I did not enter the room.\n\nGetting In and Out Of the Room\n\nSilent Hill 4: The Room might or might not have been originally intended to be related to Silent Hill; it is in any case part of the series now. It revolves around Henry Townshend, the player character, who finds himself trapped in his cursed apartment in South Ashfield Heights (which is incidentally not in Silent Hill). Townshend is compelled to explore mysterious portals, which lead to a disturbing alternate world, in order to uncover the reasons for his entrapment. SH4: The Room's plot is linked to the story of Walter Sullivan (first heard of in one of SH2's articles and tombstones) and the activities that have taken place at Silent Hill's orphanage. That being acknowledged, it is difficult not to emphasize the independence of its gameplay from the rest of the series, independence that explains why it ends up here at the outside edge. In fact, the first reaction to SH4: The Room has certainly something to do with the longing for the first and past experiences that Natasha Whiteman is talking about in “Homesick for Silent Hill: Modalities of Nostalgia in Fan Responses to Silent Hill 4: The Room” (2008). Beyond a doubt, SH1, SH2, and SH3 have built an important fandom that felt a strong allegiance to the series. However, remarks Whiteman,\n\nThis allegiance can be threatened when the texts that inspire fan devotion are taken in new directions. Enthusiasm and excitement surrounding new releases is frequently tempered by the voicing of loss, criticism, and disappointment, and in extreme circumstance, anger, which feed into the creation of websites, petitions, campaigns, and tirades left on bulletin board forums and discussion groups. (2008, 33)\n\nThrough her study of the posts on the high-profile unofficial fan site Silent Hill Heaven1 and of a particular 2004 thread in the SH4 forum (no longer available online), Whiteman reveals how the fans—the comments hold as well for many game reviewers—were calling for a gaming experience that would fit their horizon of expectations, for a “commonality which must hold the individual parts of the series together.”2 As SH1, SH2, and SH3 were “referenced as being more authentic,” “Silent Hill 4 is read as failing to demonstrate sufficient elements of the universe. In contrast to an ideal version of Silent Hill, the changes are read as corrupting elements, destroying the ‘Silent Hill experience.' In each post a longing to return is tangible” (2008, 43). Nostalgia becomes an important artifact emotion. The ironic suggestion is too easy to make: this is SH4, which should have been called SH: Shattered Memories.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Team Silent's main objective regarding the design of SH4: The Room was too far from the aforementioned idea of commonality. Akihiro Imamura, the subproducer, and Akira Yamaoka, the sound director, music composer, and producer, explain in their postmortem:\n\nWe wanted to make sweeping changes from the past titles and give players something new and fresh to play. Of course, changing something that has already proved its worth is always a risk, but we wanted to see what we could accomplish. We took on the challenge of affecting change from angles—from the horror concept to the game's subsystems. (2005, 36)\n\nOn the one hand, it is difficult not to agree with them that it was a good idea to trap someone within his own apartment and to transform it from a “place of refuge and comfort” to a haunted and hostile space. On the other hand, the player character Henry Townshend is not really prevented from moving since he is always traveling to the alternate world. Since the apartment is the location to go back to for healing during the first part of the game, and since the only save point is an orange notebook on a desk in the living room, it asks for a great readjustment in your gameplay when the space becomes haunted. Suddenly, you have to manage threats upon your return home too. If you save while the haunting is in action and did not light a holy candle to remove its damaging effect, you are damned to eternally die when you “continue” your game session—and to curse the game system, eliciting a negative emotion also stuck between the artifact and the gameplay, that is, frustration.\n\nThe absence of the flashlight and the pocket radio couldn't go without great notice. These are the true trademark devices of Silent Hill. Without the small portable lamp, you cannot set the brightness level very low in SH4: The Room in order to really feel more alone in the dark, as was possible in the other games. Doing so will prevent you from seeing important details, especially in the first-person perspective the game offers for the first time in the series. For instance, when the portal in the bathroom was blocked, I was trapped and puzzled for a good moment given that I could not see the symbols around the hole in the laundry room and could not understand the association I needed to make between the Succubus Talisman and the four collected Placards in order to open the new portal. With the general environmental lighting, the visual style of the game becomes similar to the one of Resident Evil. The resemblance becomes even more marked with the introduction of a limited inventory of 10 slots accessed in real time, as opposed to the unlimited one the gamer was accustomed to. Like the item boxes found in various locations of Resident Evil's Spencer Mansion, collected items must be stored in a chest located in the living room of the apartment. This forces Henry to go back and forth between the Otherworld and Room 302, a gameplay scheme totally different from the progression structure or level design of the other games.\n\nThe addition of the ghosts to the horde of enemies is interesting as it signals, in the line of the ambivalence introduced in SH3, the human nature beyond the monsters, though it removes the flesh presence these have. Following Imamura and Yamaoka's postmortem, although the horror of the ghost is deeply entrenched in the Japanese culture, the specter, “an indefatigable being that ceaselessly pursues the player … is a very frightening presence to all, regardless of the culture” (2005, 39). It's quite scary to see a ghost coming out of the walls, and you may have your share of gameplay fear. Yet, in comparison to those of Fatal Frame for example, the ghosts become merely an annoying presence since they can't be killed like Pyramid Head, the chief Silent Hill monster. Imamura and Yamaoka acknowledged the problem: “Ghosts were too obtrusive.... Players were irritated at constantly being on the run from them and as a result, were incapable of fully appreciating the beautiful rendered game environments” (2005, 40). Late in the game, when it is possible to stop them with Swords of Obedience, the option is still not that satisfactory: “The concept of invincible enemies wasn't a bad one, but in the case of the ghosts, we made them too strong. In the retail version, the ghosts become ‘unstunned' in 3–10 seconds. If we could change it, we would make the stunned time between 15 and 60 seconds … to give the players some respite” (2005, 40). In comparison to SH4: The Room, the gamer respires quite a lot more in SH: Shattered Memories, which is free of monsters in the “real world,” which allows him to appreciate the beautiful game environments.\n\nIt is likewise because of fans' reactions to The Room that Konami listened to the negative feedback about the first version of SH: 0rigins. Since this first version was, according to the senior executive editor for Electronic Gaming Monthly Shane Bettenhausen, too close to “a Resident Evil 4–inspired look and feel,” the project was rebooted. The revamped SH: 0rigins that we know today “wisely plays safe, closely mimicking the presentation and gameplay styles of fan favorite Silent Hill 2” with a few new touches, such as the breakable weapons (2007b, 77). Fans are more willing to accept changes in Silent Hill: The Arcade (2007), the arcade being more suited to the rail shooter genre, and to mobile phone games with their hardware, performance, or memory limitations. However, and SH: Homecoming bears witness, it is not possible to wander from the straight and narrow when it comes to the traditional survival terror (sub)genre.\n\nTracing the Lines of the Incubus\n\nAs with many conspicuous successes of popular culture, Silent Hill has become a franchise, similar to Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil. The far-off past and present of the resort town have expanded to noninteractive territories. In Japan, there is the novelization of SH1, SH2 (2006), and SH3 (2007) by Sadamu Yamashita, and the digital manga Silent Hill: Cage of Cradle (2006) and Silent Hill: Double under Dusk (2007) by Hiroyuki Owaku (story) and Masahiro Ito (art). In North America, not to mention the animated comic Silent Hill: The Hunger available on PSP's The Silent Hill Experience (2006), IDW Publishing has published six comic books since 2004.3\n\nSilent Hill: Dying Inside (story by Scott Ciencin) is the first “frightening new chapter to the lore of Silent Hill” (2004).4 With a look that is quite different from the usual American comic style, the drawings arouse—here and in the other books as well—particular artifact emotions. It is attractive to see how Ben Templesmith (issues 1 and 2) uses lines, ink stains, dark contrasts, and foggy and blur effects to render the nightmarish 3-D universe of Silent Hill and how Aadi Salman (issues 3, 4, and 5) brings into play larger brushstrokes and harsh colors with the reddish ones predominant. Of course, the story evolves around a known premise: author and psychiatrist Troy Abernathy and his patient, film student Lynn DeAngelis, return to Silent Hill to confront (their) demons. They get to a place that is, says Lynn to Troy, “feeding on what's inside us. What's inside you” (issue 2, 16). A corresponding play of ratiocination and a drama of proof are initiated. Has Abernathy's wife, whom he meets reincarnated as a nurse with a scalpel stuck in her neck, really committed suicide? What is Lynn's trauma hiding? Who is the demon-child Christabella, what does she want, and what kind of relationship does she have with her sister, who is drawn back to Silent Hill? Withal, the confrontation between the two sisters does not come to a conclusion in this chapter and continues during Silent Hill: Dead/Alive by Scott Ciencin (story) and Nick Stakal (art) in 2006. This last story is also the one of actor Kenneth Carter, brought to the nightmarish town when his house comes to resemble the paintings he has on his walls. The paintings are those of Ike Isaacs, whom he meets during his journey. The painter is the main protagonist of Silent Hill: Paint It Black by Scott Ciencin (story) and Shaun Thomas (art), published the previous year. Owing to such links, you understand that if you cross places you already know (Lakeview Hotel, Brookhaven Hospital, or Pete's Bowl-O-Rama), encounter monsters you've seen before (Insane Cancers, Numb Bodies, Twin Victims, or Pyramid Heads), the comic books have indeed their own intertextuality and textuality too, much more abstract or narratively elliptical than that of the games.\n\nThe showy and less restrained universe of the comics is certainly not like the universe of the video game. Hence there is one significant difference to underline between the two worlds. At the very beginning of Silent Hill: Dying Inside, Troy Abernathy uses his standing to sleep with one of his admirers. To say nothing about his nebulous relation with his wife, his intentions to take Lynn back to Silent Hill don't seem honorable. The book he has just published might well be entitled “You're in control!” but he is really not, nor are you in control of his behavior either. He overreacts to what he finds in town and utters many a “Fuck!” The quiet, lunatic patient bursts into rage and shouts, “Fucker! Gimme that” when she takes a gun from Troy's hand to shoot Christabella in the eye. Actually, as opposed to the quite composed Travis, Harry, James, Heather, Henry, or Alex, the protagonists of the comic books swear a lot. Consequently, they inspire more antipathy than anything else. It is difficult to feel fiction emotions such as empathy or sympathy for them, and this takes away from the feel of the videoludic experience. Silent Hill: Sinner's Reward (2008) remains, in my view, the exception to this pattern and the most interesting book of the group. It might not be a matter of chance, but it is modeled on the plot of SH2. With different tones and atmospheres used by the artist Steph Stamb, Tom Waltz brilliantly alternates between past, present, and future events to tell the story of hit man Jack Stanton. Jack is trying to start a new life with his lover, unfortunately the wife of his boss, who has no intention to let the lovers go away easily, even when the couple ends up in Silent Hill. For Jack, like James in SH2, the town represents his place of redemption. Jill, his sweetheart, is dressed like the nurse Lisa Garland once in the resort town and demonstrates the same sensibility. The monsters Jack meets prove to be past victims. Akin to Maria, Sara, the young woman he saves at one point and tries to protect later, is no different from the other creatures he has crossed. She pushes him to do to himself what he has done so many times before. The last pages are truly touching.\n\nAs judgmental as one can be about their fiction, comic books have their own language. The reader has to address not only the sequential continuity between the panels, but also the spatial montage of those panels. For instance, the layout plays a significant role in conveying meaning and in eliciting artifact emotions in Silent Hill: Paint It Black and Silent Hill: Among the Damned (2006) both by Scott Ciencin (story) and Shaun Thomas (art). However, relying on fixed images, comic books cannot reproduce the experiential flow of video games, as a movie can do.\n\nFilming the Game\n\nWith a long section of the third chapter displaying the cinematic experience offered by the series, that there is a Silent Hill film (2006) goes almost without saying, especially since the video game has become, in recent years, a new source of material for films.5 The French film director Christophe Gans—a hardcore gamer himself—talked about Silent Hill in the press long before he got to adapt it to the silver screen. According to his comments quoted at the end of the fourth chapter, he holds both SH2 and the series in high esteem. His philosophy goes in the opposite direction of the approach taken by Paul W. S. Anderson for the Resident Evil films or, worse, by Uwe Boll for Alone in the Dark.6 For Gans, who had to convince Team Silent to grant him the rights, it was not simply a question of profiting from the game's popularity, to resort to its characters or setting or to be inspired by videoludic aesthetics. He adapted the original material with all the consideration it deserves. “For me,” he says in an interview on the film's French website,\n\na good game is exactly like opening a good book or listening to a good record. In fact, no matter the support, it is only the quality of the emotion that counts. My work as a film director simply consists of finding the most effective and the most respectful way of carrying this experience to a new medium—the cinema in this particular case.... [It is] more complex for Silent Hill in that all people who played this game have in a way visited Silent Hill and have fond and personal memories. (2006; my translation)7\n\nFor the purpose of the seventh art, plot elements from SH1, SH3, and SH2 are brought into the foreground, as well as the characters' psychology. It is now a mother, Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell), who is going to walk through Silent Hill. Rose cannot accept the strange ache Sharon (and not Cheryl, played by Jodelle Ferland) is suffering from and that could confine her to a mental hospital. In spite of the protests from her husband, Christopher DaSilva (Sean Bean), and in order to find the answers to her worries, Rose drives Sharon to the ghost town, which seems to irresistibly attract the girl. While they penetrate this disturbing world, Sharon disappears and Rose goes off to search for her daughter. Alone most of the time, she meets few people, among whom are Officer Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), Dahlia Gillespie (Deborah Kara Unger), and Christabella (Alice Krige), the leader of a religious cult. In his turn, Rose's husband is going to look for his wife and daughter accompanied by a nearby city policeman, Officer Thomas Gucci (Kim Coates). As in the games, the town of Silent Hill is going to deliver its terrifying secrets during the movie.\n\nIn Les Cahiers du cinéma, Gans talks about the movies inspired by the video game universe's spirit and asserts that The Matrix (Andy and Larry Wachowski, 1999) is the only one to have openly put its finger on the video game and to offer an accomplished project: “There is in The Matrix a will to represent a universe constituted, as in video games, of layers into which one penetrates. We sink farther and farther into levels and forget where we come from” (Higuinen and Tesson 2002c, 16). His comment perfectly describes the multifaceted time and space structure of the Silent Hill movie. The real city of Silent Hill, the one of 30 years ago shown through flashbacks, as well as the foggy world of the day and the dark world of the night—all these represent layers into which the spectator sinks with Rose. But the movie's inclination to explain things more than one needs spoils the descent. Although it answers to narrative requirements, the segment with Rose's husband and the policeman, Gucci, draws too frank a line between the levels and the realities. The scene where Christopher and Rose cross each other in the schoolyard without being able to see each other, as well as the end of the movie, which definitively separates the father from his wife and daughter, sets the existence of a parallel world from which it is not possible to get out. The strength of Silent Hill was precisely to be more evasive on this subject.\n\nBesides the use of the original game music of Akira Yamaoka (the movie executive producer), the fidelity to the artwork leads to a complete transposition of the beginning of SH1 up to Harry's awakening (described in chapter 4) and of several other scenes. While certain shots during the sudden appearance of Alessa's silhouette on the road and during the first progression in the alley are almost exact reproductions of those of the game, Gans exploits the possibilities of a more dynamic cutting. If he reproduces the vertical panoramic view on the second crucified corpse at the end of the alley, he intensifies the horror thanks to a close-up of the bloodshot eyes of the crucified, which we discover is still alive. To translate the spirit of this ghost town, he shows Rose's arrival in town from the inside of a shop window, the back of a garage, and through an abandoned stroller. Then, to truly respect the framing and movements seen in the games, more than half of the shots of the movie are filmed by a crane. Combined with movable movie sets, this large trolley with a long projected arm at end of which the camera is attached permits the real camera to move as freely as the virtual game camera. Having understood that it was primarily a visit in the heart of the dark city the gamer had experienced, Gans joins Carol Spier (production designer known for her work with the Canadian film director David Cronenberg, among others, on his film eXistenZ in 1999) to reconstruct Silent Hill and faithfully re-create the aesthetics of the game. Shot outdoors in the streets of the city of Brantford, Ontario (the movie is a Canada-France coproduction), and in the studio to better control the fog, or having its images retouched afterward in the computer, the film is really close to the idea of what you would think of as a “real” Silent Hill. What's more, shot in part in high-definition video (by cinematographer Dan Laustsen), the darkness keeps its thickness without a film image too grainy.\n\nInsofar as the source of pleasure is not the same for a gamer looking at the translation of the game world to the big screen and a spectator looking at a horror film,8 it is the first segment of the movie that will certainly please the former because it captures the nature of his gameplay experience. Radha Mitchell, who plays Rose, learned, at her expense, what it implies to be in the shoes of a video game player character: “For the first few weeks [of shooting], I was just running and running and running. And then, there was some more running, followed by a bit more running. And then I was being attacked” (Helms 2006, 48). It is pleasantly entertaining to see Rose out of breath reaching the edge of an abyss at the end of a street, to see her use bus routes to find her way to Midwich Elementary School, to see her passing though the school courtyard to flee enemies or running into the rest-room, framed as in the game and haunted by the tears of ghosts of a young girl. On the other hand, already in the seat of an observer with no ability to intervene, the gamer looks at a protagonist left with few alternatives to flight. To make the situation even worse, Rose is handcuffed for almost 20 minutes. To compensate for this absence of means of defense, the number of monsters met during the search for Sharon is largely reduced. Instead of roaming in the whole hospital, the Nurses are, for instance, grouped in a single corridor. Using very little of the white noise effects Rose's mobile phone could have emitted, the tension of the off-screen space is also lower. Without the fear of seeing the main protagonist being killed as often happens in the game (no repetitive “game over” here in the vein of a Groundhog Day—Harold Ramis, 1993), the experience is less terrifying. There is nothing like the games for this."
