        "text": "A cult horror classic is coming back to theaters! Details for the Silent Hill thematic franchise reboot Return to Silent Hill have finally dropped, including casting and plot. The film will begin filming in April in both Germany and Eastern Europe. Christophe Gans (Silent Hill) will reprise his role as director, from a script he co-wrote with Sandra Vo-Anh and William Josef Schneider.\n\nThe upcoming spooky flick is based on Silent Hill 2, the second installment in the hit video game series from Konami. Lead character James, played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), is heartbroken after losing his love, played by Hannah Emily Anderson (Jigsaw, The Purge). A mysterious letter leads James back to Silent Hill in search of her, where he is drawn into madness by monsters both familiar and new. The lovelorn hero must fight to keep his sanity if he has any hope of ever saving her.\n\nRadha Mitchell and Sean Bean starred in the first Silent Hill movie, which premiered in 2006 and features VFX from BUF Compagnie, C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures, Mr. X, Intelligent Creatures, Invisible Pictures, Frantic Films, Mokko, Kook Ewo, and Optix Digital Pictures. The new film will play off Konami’s upcoming games from the horror franchise, including a Silent Hills 2 remake, Silent Hill: Townfall, Silent Hill f, and Silent Hill: Ascension.\n\n“Return to Silent Hill is a mythological love story about someone so deeply in love, they’re willing to go to hell to save someone,” Gans said to Deadline. “I’m delighted to have the wonderful talents of both Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson take us on this journey into a psychological horror world that I hope will both satisfy and surprise fans of Silent Hill.”\n\nWatch the Return to Silent Hill teaser trailer featuring a message from Gans now:\n\n“Christophe and I have been working closely with our partners at Konami, as they update the video game, to also create a version of Silent Hill for the theatrical audiences of today,” explained producer Hadida. “You will still find the iconic monsters – but there will also be new designs. We are confident that this new film and Konami’s updated game together will propel the franchise forward for years to come.”\n\nReturn to Silent Hill is produced by Victor Hadida (producer on The Crow and Silent Hill franchises) under his Davis Films banner, with Hassell Free Productions’ Molly Hassell (The Crow) and David Wulf (The Card Counter)."
