        "text": "Some things are so transparently awful that there can seem no other response but laughter. The brazenness of the wealthy and entitled is one of them. That the twenty-six richest people in the world have as much money as the poorest three billion is a statistic so ludicrous that it’s a very bad joke. And yet somehow, the super-wealthy seem not just okay with this, but actively pursue and consolidate their protected status while spinning myths to justify themselves. ‘I’m just playing by the rules’ says one character in Greed, from the deck of her self-designed luxury yacht in Monaco.\n\nGreed is a tonally bizarre film, oscillating between very funny comedy, black satire, and earnest political messaging. It centres around Sir Richard McCreadle (Steve Coogan), an entrepreneur who is a composite of Richard Branson, Alan Sugar, Donald Trump and any number of supposed ‘self-made men’. ‘Greedy McCready’ – a nickname he gave to himself at school – is driven by money above all else, but has recently been publicly embarrassed in front of a select committee that dug into his multiple failed companies, his reliance on sweatshop labour, and his personal ethics. Stung (and also custard pied by an activist), he decides to throw the party of a lifetime for his 60th, to show the world that he’s still on top.\n\nThis is the comedy plot, and it’s genuinely funny. Richard is influenced by Gladiator, a film he repeatedly quotes from in his own mythologising as a little guy taking on the world, and so the party will require everyone to wear togas (including the staff dressed as slaves) and to attend a gladiatorial contest with a live lion. Pixie Lott, Fatboy Slim, Coldplay and Elton John are scheduled to perform; Stephen Fry and Keith Richards are on the guestlist; and Richard’s extended family including ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher), model girlfriend Naomi (Shanina Shaik) and kids Lily (Sophie Cookson) and Finn (Asa Butterfield). Winterbottom has great fun satirising the mega-rich as Samantha and Richard mock one another’s most recent cosmetic embellishments and Lily, in some of the best scenes, stars in a reality show about rich beautiful young things (alongside Fabian, played by Made in Chelsea actor Ollie Locke), and finds herself unable to distinguish between herself and her ‘character’.\n\nThe deep supporting cast is full of riches who start eking out the tensions around the family. In old lady make-up, Shirley Henderson is magnificent as Richard’s bitter Irish mother, and in flashbacks we see her taking the spoiled Richard out of private school while boasting to the headteacher that he’ll never have anything like her money. Finn is creepy as hell, going on continually about Oedipus and then getting letchy over Naomi (who is his own age). Asim Chaudhry steals the show as the lion tamer trying to look after his star charge, while Sam (Tim Key) tries to persuade a Greek foreman of the urgency of getting the fake amphitheatre put up, descending into an increasingly complex set of profanities. The flimsiness of the mini-Colosseum is, of course, an on-the-nose metaphor for the facade of Richard’s riches, which all began with him gambling over magic tricks and sleight of hand at school.\n\nAs the film settles in, however, the darker edges start to appear. The film is framed by David Mitchell as biographer Nick, who interviews Richard’s friends and family about how he got to where he is. In flashbacks, we see the young Richard bullying his way around the retail scene of London in the 70s and 80s. There’s some fantastic writing as he throws underlings under buses and demands uncouth choices (a particular section on fuchsia is a masterclass – ‘I want in your face! It’s the colour of a twat! It invites you in!’), but Richard is also an embodiment of all the worst practices of free market trading. A Big Short-style explanation from a financier shows how he disguised his practices of asset-stripping and ran company after company into the ground, and then Nick goes to Sri Lanka to film some workers wishing Richard a happy birthday, only to be introduced to the living conditions and wages of the people on whom Richard’s business depends (and who Richard was responsible for driving down the pay of). Nick is an odd, blundering character, and the film leaves his own ethics somewhat murky, as he goes on to make big bucks from his ‘official’ biography while only gesturing towards the problems with Richard’s empire.\n\nAnd so the film’s moral compass passes over to Amanda (Dinita Gohil), assistant party planner and daughter of one of Richard’s former workers in Sri Lanka. She and Nick bond when she is upset by being forced to dress as a slave for Richard’s party, and she also intervenes to support a group of Syrian refugees camping out on the public beach next to Richard’s villa (the responses to the dignified refugees throughout are revealing – Lily builds them into her reality show, other flunkies scream at them, and Richard gambles with them, using his sleight-of-hand to get them to put on togas and help finish the amphitheatre for minimum wage). It’s Amanda who is given some of the most on-the-nose dialogue about the awfulness of Richard’s life, and so it’s she who presses the button when Richard is taunting the lion after the part, letting out the lion (who has recently had its meat spiked with cocaine by Finn), leading to the symbolic and literal eating of the rich.\n\nBetween the many celebrity cameos (including Caroline Flack, shockingly the first person seen on screen, following a quick tribute caption presumably rushed to cinemas just before general release), the silly satire and the conspicuous consumption, it’s a very funny film. But ultimately the film’s purpose is deathly serious. A long closing captions sequence, set to ‘Money, Money, Money’, outlines the issues of wealth disparity, refugees, sweatshop labour and misogyny that the film tries to deal with in one package – it’s all connected. And as Amanda herself goes to work in an upstairs garment-making factory, and Finn takes over the company with ambitions to make it even bigger, it’s a reminder that – as well-trodden as these issues are – they aren’t getting better anytime soon."
