        "text": "Detective Mills, played by Brad Pitt, the other protagonist is an upcoming detective who lacks the experience and sincerity to his job that his more experienced counterpart Detective Somerset has. His character is portrayed as a naive young man unwilling to face his problems directly. His introduction is in more warm colors of daylight. It is also contrasted with the downpour taking place over the city, showcasing that his warmth is being washed off by the rain and despair of his colleagues and the city at large.\n\nThe film after introducing its two protagonists, starts unraveling the murders, the main conflict in the film. Director David Fincher, like any other filmmaker, has a certain tone, feel and emotions he wants his viewers to feel. These emotions felt by the viewer are a part of the experience and the journey that viewers take in the story. Color plays an important role in building this experience and correct use of color in each shot is necessary.\n\nColor has the power to change the meaning in each scene as well as represent multiple meaning in differing contexts. Throughout the film a mixture of colors are used to build different emotions and meanings. However one can clearly see a pattern in use of color on a closer inspection.\n\nThe film opened with emphasis on using cool, dark and dull colors. The film focused heavily on cooler colors in the first half, It showcased the dreary atmosphere of the city. Coldness surrounding the murders by John Doe, the apathetic nature of the police and general masses by extension.\n\nCool Colors like shades of blue are known for sparking feelings of calmness as well as sadness and depression. The director expertly used cooler shades to make the audience feel the depressive atmosphere of the city and the sheer in sensitiveness behind Doe’s murders.\n\nNow let’s talk about the murders. Throughout the film the killings were gruesome and violent. Earlier in the film the murders were shown in a similar color palette to that of the scene, mixing with the surroundings and feeling as if, it is a part of the world. Later in the film, the murders became more cruel and violent, the film maker chose implying the ghastly murder instead of showing it directly. Color Red and shades of it, were used in various crime scenes and its quantity increased as the killings became more horrendous.\n\nThe film shifted to a warmer color palette with the introduction and subsequent surrender of John Doe, played by Kevin Spacey. The shift symbolized the enlightenment that the actions of John Doe, Detective Somerset and Detective Mills will bring to the viewers. John Doe is portrayed as a man of knowledge and purpose. He is clear in his objectives and view of the world. Something that is absent in the two protagonists of the movie. His clarity and confidence overcame the depressive tones of the city and its people. His radiance filled the screen as the director prepared the audience for the final conclusion to John Doe’s murders.\n\nBefore discussing the use of colors and composition in the finale, it is important to know about the Seven Deadly Sins. Seven deadly sins are Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Wrath, Greed and Sloth. The sins in the context of the film represent excessive emotions.\n\nPride is excessive self-love.\n\nWrath is excessive anger, uncontrollable rage.\n\nEnvy is hateful looking on at those more fortunate than oneself, and wishing to cut them down.\n\nGreed is a passion for limitless wealth and luxurious possessions.\n\nGluttony is a passion for food.\n\nLust is an excessive desire for sex.\n\nSloth is an unwillingness to do anything for the common good, can be seen to be rooted in the emotion of despair, sadness.\n\nWe all experience each of these seven feelings at one point or another in life, and it’s perfectly normal and acceptable to feel a little of these emotions, provided we control them instead of vice versa. They become deadly sins when they’re allowed to run wild inside ourselves, driving us to hurt other people.\n\nSo the main theme of the story is unrestrained emotion. John blames society for letting these sins run wild and corrupt everyone. He is convinced that the growing apathetic nature of the people is directly related to the deadly sins corrupting the world and driving it into further madness and selfishness.\n\nWhen we understand the message of the film and Doe’s motivation we can relate the tools the film used in its visual storytelling. The film is very restrained in its use of colors and the filmmaker’s approach is to use a desaturated color palette, that lacks vibrant & popping colors dominating each and every scene.\n\nThis restrained use of colors truly convey the message of the filmmaker that we as an individual, part of a larger society, must restrain our expression of emotions and feelings and not let it control us.\n\nBy controlling the use of colors, the filmmaker is able to control the message of each sequence and direct our attention to the important subject matter in the film. The film is able to hold our attention by using bright colors as attention seekers in the scenes. Use of bright colors in minimum quantity add dynamic qualities to the scene and keep the viewer engaged.\n\nThe Cinematographer Darius Khondji used a simple approach to the camerawork influenced by the TV Show COPS, “how the camera is in the backseat peering over people’s shoulder.” He was able to achieve the distinct brooding look of the film using a chemical process called bleach bypass, wherein the silver in the film stock was not completely removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality. With deepened shadows and bright colors used in small quantities, the film was able to engage its viewers in its story and its message.\n\nFor the purpose of analysis we look at the complete color palette selected from 14 key moments in the film, 6 Scenes represent the murders and 8 Scenes are important plot points in the film. One can see a smooth transition between use of colors throughout the film and a balanced use of warm and cool colors. The complete palette is harmonious and matches with the tone of the film."
