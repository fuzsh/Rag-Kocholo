He was popularly known as “Shahenshah-e-Qawwali”.\n\nIn his prolonged music career, he traveled extensively to perform in a wide range of countries.\n\nKhan created a world record of releasing as many as 125 audio albums as a Qawwal which includes legendary numbers such as Dum mustt Qalandar mustt‚ Ali Maula Ali‚ Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hai‚ Mera Pia Ghar Aya and many others.\n\nIn 1987, the government of Pakistan bestowed Pride of Performance on the legendary singer for his contribution to Pakistani music. Two years before his death, he received the prestigious UNESCO Music Prize. He received a number of national and international honorary awards throughout his music career.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan died on August 16‚ 1997 due to a cardiac arrest in London."
