Some of his popular songs from those albums are ‘Khawaja Tum Hi Ho’, ‘My Heart, My Life’, ‘Tere Bin Nai Lagda’, and many more.\n\nHe got collaborated with Eddie Vedder to compose a soundtrack- ‘The Face of Love’ for the film, Dead Man Walking (1996), and also with Jonathan Elias to sang two songs- ‘Faith’, and ‘Benediction’ from his album ‘The Prayer Cycle.\n\nIn the year 1997, his albums, Intoxicated Spirit (1966) and Night Song, was nominated for the Grammy Award in the category of the best traditional folk album and the Best World Music Album respectively. His album, Intoxicated Spirit, includes some of his most popular songs such as ‘Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hai’, ‘Ruk pe Rehmat ka’, ‘Meri Saqi Saqi Yeh,’ and ‘Be Wafa.’\n\nHe had also composed various Bollywood songs such as ‘Koi Jaane Koi Na Jaane’ & ‘Zindagi Jhoom Kar’ from the film Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya, ‘Ishq Ka Rutba’ from Kartoos, ‘Iss Shaan-E-Karam Ka Kya Kehna’ from Kacche Dhaage, ‘Dulhe Ka Sehra’ from Dhadkan, and many other blockbuster songs for various films.\n\nHis songs were so much enticing and popular in the Bollywood that some of the hit numbers of Bollywood has often been allegedly copying the music of Nusrat’s songs. One of such songs is ‘Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast’ (Mohra- 1994), whose music is almost similar to that of the one of Nusrat’s song, ‘Dum Mast Qalandar.’\n\nA. R. Rahman had featured a song ‘Allah Hoo’, in his album, Gurus of Peace, and composed a song ‘Tere Bina’ (Guru-2007) as a tribute to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\non 16 August 1997, at the age of 48 years, he died because of a major cardiac arrest at Cromwell Hospital in London. However, as per the report, the doctors at the hospital had also mentioned the use of infected dialysis equipment in Pakistan’s hospital as one of the reasons behind his death.\n\nOn 13 September 2013, his wife had also died in Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Here is the rare interview video of his wife, Naheeda, telling about her companionship with her husband.\n\nHere is the video of the documentary, in which Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is narrating his journey of life."
