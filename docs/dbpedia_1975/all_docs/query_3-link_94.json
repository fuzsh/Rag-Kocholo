        "text": "Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan: A Sufi Music Master Revived\n\nBy Anil Mundra\n\nAll Things Considered, August 7, 2007 - Resurrecting the dead is nothing new in music. Remember Natalie Cole singing and dancing with her late father, Nat King Cole? The latest luminary to be revived is the Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. August 16 marks the tenth anniversary of his death.\n\nIn his short life, Nusrat was the world's greatest singer of qawwali, a boisterous and passionate music of mystical Islam. He embraced western pop music, teaming up with Peter Gabriel and Eddie Vedder. Now, Nusrat returns with the help of Italian dub reggae producer Gaudi. Their new CD is called Dub Qawwali.\n\nGaudi is a veteran producer with 11 solo albums over the past two decades. He specializes in dub reggae, a style that often reworks existing material, mixing booming bass and drums with electronic effects.\n\nAfter dabbling in punk music, Gaudi began experimenting with synthesizers, and was fully steeped in reggae when he first heard one of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's records in the mid-1980s. By this time, Khan was already being called the \"Emperor of qawwali.\"\n\nGaudi displays an appropriate reverence for the emperor, a fact that most likely helped him when he approached Khan's old record label. Gaudi says he was thrilled when they gave him full access to original 40-year-old reel-to-reel tapes of unreleased Nusrat sessions.\n\n\"It was incredibly emotive for me, seeing the writing, handwriting and everything, I had goose bumps, really,\" Gaudi recalls.\n\nHe took the tapes and worked some studio magic, removing unwanted instruments and laying the bare vocal tracks over his own beats. It was a daring venture, to be sure, but Gaudi says that in all that tinkering, his aim was not to adapt Khan's music to his own beats, but exactly the other way around. He was even careful to preserve the message of Khan's music.\n\n\"I couldn't understand what he was thinking about,\" Gaudi says, \"so I had to employ a translator. And making sure that all the vocals that phonetically for me sounded great, even meaning-wise made sense.\"\n\nThat's part of the reason the record took Gaudi two years to make. He says he spent months just listening, before touching anything. And in the end, his careful study convinced him that he could safely use Jamaican dub beats without compromising the spirit of Khan's music.\n\n\"Because the message of that music and the message of reggae is exactly the same,\" Gaudi says. \"It's peace, love, and spirituality. So that was my common denominator for me, just to try and unify the two elements.\"\n\nStill, as harmonious as it felt to him, Gaudi says sometimes felt he should abandon the project.\n\n\"I know already that whatever I do with this music,\" Gaudi says, \"it will not be as beautiful as the original material, and that's for sure. So I was about to give up. And the same feeling happened when I remixed Bob Marley four years ago. It's bigger than me, bigger than anything I did so far.\"\n\nBut he went ahead, trying to imagine that Khan's spirit was there with him in the studio. After all, Gaudi says, the studio is his \"temple.\"\n\nTIME's 'Asian Heroes'\n\n'Pakistan Times' Monitoring Desk\n\n\"Who can say what further bridges he might have built between East and West had he lived longer.\"\n\nTIME posed the question while introducing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. \"On Khan's death in 1997, Westerners were just starting to grasp this musical treasure that Pakistan had given the world... And in a way one had, because Khan had made the rich religious poetry of the Sufi tradition even more magical, bringing words and music together in an ecstatic celebration of the divine. To listen to him was to hear the harmony of the spheres.\n\n\"Believing that passion transcended words, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan rarely sang in English, preferring to use his native Punjabi and Urdu, or the Farsi of the Sufi poets. But it was passion that killed him in the end. A lover of food, music and constant touring, Khan never heeded his doctor's warnings to diet or slow down; he would sing for hours at a time, palms upraised as if channeling energy from his audience. And so his heart gave out at age 48, depriving humanity of one of its greatest voices. World music? The label is hardly adequate. File, instead, under 'genius.'\""
