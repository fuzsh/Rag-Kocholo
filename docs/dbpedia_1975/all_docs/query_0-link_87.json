        "text": "On the occasion of his 75th birthday, millions of admirers around the world are remembering the musical genius and Qawwali monarch, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nHe offered the music industry a fresh voice and left a lasting impact. On October 13, 1948, he was born in Faisalabad to a Qawwal family.\n\nThe first artist to combine Eastern and Western musical traditions together was Ustad Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan, and it is still done today, even after many years.\n\nThe king of qawwali was skilled in all musical genres, whether it be qawwali, song, ghazal, or classical singing. It is to his credit that he popularised Qawwali traditions around the world.\n\nHe earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for having released 125 albums in total, the most by a Qawwali musician.\n\nSome of the maestro's well-known compositions are \"Dum mast Qalandar,\" \"Wohi khuda hai,\" \"Kisy da yar na bichry,\" \"Tumhy dillagi bhool jani pary ge,\" \"Jany kb hon gy km,\" and \"Tera inam Pakistan.\"\n\nFor his assistance in promoting music, he also received the Pride of Performance award.\n\nAdditionally, in 2005, the UK Asian Music Awards presented Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan with the Legends Award and the UNESCO Music Prize.\n\nOn August 16, 1997, he passed away in London, yet he continues to live on in the hearts of his many admirers all over the world."
