        "text": "Dubai: Today marks Pakistani Sufi (devotional) music legend, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s 70th birth anniversary.\n\nKnown for having one of the greatest voices ever recorded and as the ‘King of Qawwali’, Khan’s tunes influenced the face of music globally. The maestro specifically has contributed greatly to the genre of Qawwali, a musical tradition prevalent in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nThe world is remembering the legendary singer for his contribution towards music, not only from the subcontinent but internationally. People took to online platforms to remember the musician.\n\nTweeting a picture of the singer, tweep Basim Ayub, @AyubBasim, wrote: “The only voice without filters, auto-tune and fake sounds. There would never be anyone more melodious and talented than NFAK (Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan).”\n\nWhereas, Twitter user, @DrAliya7, posted: “... anniversary of Ustad [expert] #NusratFatehAliKhan is being observed today! When they say heroes never die... they are right. He is a legend even today...”\n\nTweep, Kristiane Backer, @KristianeBacker, commenting on a video of his performance, shared her experience of hearing him for the first time: “I was there! My first exposure to #Qawwali music and the phenomenal #NusratFatehAliKhan! I was an #MTVpresenter at the time, it was an acquired taste but got intoxicated for life.”\n\nBollywood lyricist who has remixed some of Khan’s tracks, Manoj Muntashir, @manojmuntashir, tweeted about his admiration towards the artist: “Back in my college days, all I wanted was to work with #NusratFatehAliKhan sahab (sir). Unfortunately he left this mortal world, two years before I came to Mumbai. I feel proud to have recreated his undying legacy. HBD Ustad Ji. #MereRashkeQamar #DekhteDekhte #SanuIkPal #Dillagi #NitKhair”\n\nWhereas, tweep, @Farma_ceutico, wrote about the popularity Khan’s music has till date: “#NFAK continues to rule over hearts. Who would believe that, his songs are still played at every event. The tributes successfully impart his rich music legacy to the generation that was born after his demise. #NusratFatehAliKhan”\n\nNusrat passed away unexpectedly at the age of 48. Currently, his musical legacy is carried forth by his nephew Rahat Fateh Ali Khan who has covered his uncle’s numerous songs and regularly conducts tributes to the Qawwal."
