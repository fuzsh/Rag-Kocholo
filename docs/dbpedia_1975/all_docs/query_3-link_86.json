        "text": "\"The Qawwali is in my spirit. It's instilled in my soul. It nourishes my spirit. Qawwali is forever.\" These are words spoken by a man who virtually worships his music, since he was born into a dynasty where it runs in the blood. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan gracefully carries the onus of upholding a legacy. The legacy of Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. His heritage is Qawwali, the 700-year old musical component of the mystical tradition called Sufism.\n\nBorn and brought up in Faislabad, Pakistan, Rahat cannot identify the point of inspiration, since music was ubiquitous, throughout his childhood. \"When I first heard a Qawwali, I was spellbound. I wanted to learn it and become a Qawwali singer. And there was no better school than my home itself. It was a musical institute and we were a joint family of musicians. I learnt everything at home.\"\n\nThe voice, which Jeff Buckley described as \"the incomparable velvet fire\", faded away on August 16, 1997. Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the greatest practitioner of Qawwali, had no sons, and the Qawwali tradition required that the master choose his own rightful heir.\n\nRahat was the natural successor. He began vocal training at the age of three. At the age of six, the rigorous process of vocal training began with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan personally teaching him ragas. \"When he saw the potential in me, Nusratji asked for me to be given to him as a son. I've been brought up learning music in Nusratji's lap.\n\n\"At the age of nine, I performed on stage for the first time. It was a carnival-like atmosphere, where ghazal and classical singers came together. The stage seemed so big. I had my father, Farroukh Fateh Ali Khan next to me, and my guru, Nusratji, on the other side. I was very nervous, but once the performance began, it was as if I was transported into a different dimension altogether.\"\n\nThe relationship between his guru and him has been a crucial factor in Rahat's life.\n\nRahat spent 12 years, from 1985 to 1997, touring with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. \"Not only was he my grand-uncle, but also my best friend and teacher. I learned from him, from day one until the end of his life. We shared a beautiful and unforgettable relationship. One which I will always cherish.\"\n\nBut Rahat's music is more of a mission. \"Sufism promotes love and brotherhood. Saints have professed this for ages for the whole world, which we translate and present in the form of Qawwali. It doesn't require modern instrumentation nor does it require popularity. The message itself is sincere and integral.\"\n\nFor Rahat, music is an austere practice; a near religion. \"I wake up at around 6.00 in the morning every day and do riaz (vocal training) for five or six hours. Qawwali is more a form of prayer than a form of music. It is a way of advocating a philosophy to the world, through phrases and poetry, through devotional music.\"\n\nRahat does not feel that being a successor to Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has hindered his individual persona. \"We come from a gharana (musical family). Nusratji's father was his major influence. There's always a different path to reach your final destination. You may call it impersonating your ustad (teacher) or establishing your own style. It is, undoubtedly, an honour for me to be his successor and I am proud to be carrying the message of Nusratji. No one is or ever can be like him. His voice and his magic cannot ever be recreated. I am only doing my duty because I was his student. I have my own vocal sound and my own style. I learned from him and he expected me to be a different singer. I'm sure people will understand this when they listen to me.\"\n\nRahat can never forget his performance at Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's shrine in Lahore, Pakistan, in the spring of 1998, immediately after his death, touted to be the largest festival in South Asia. He was the youngest Qawwali singer present in the three-day festival and more than 200,000 people attended the all-night performance.\n\n\"Now we have the ceremony in Los Angeles at the residence of Joseph Lazarro. It's every year, on August 16. It is attended by several directors, actors, actresses and musicians from around the world.\"\n\nRahat also performed at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles in 1998 for the Dead Man Walking benefit concert, along with Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam, and did 11 successful concerts in August 1999 at prestigious venues including Central Park and the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nHow does one term Rahat Fateh Ali Khan? A musical ambassador. An unassuming prodigy who carries off a rich heritage with finesse. A performer par excellence. With talent galore, the most evident factor about Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is his immense respect for the legacy he has been entrusted with. The passion is visible in his eyes as he speaks about it with zeal.\n\n\"Once you begin listening to Qawwali music it enters you slowly, fills up your senses and makes you feel alive. My family carried the tradition for over 700 years. My mission is to explore the world through Qawwali and to spread the message of peace, love and brotherhood to one and all. I think there should be no differences of race and religion. This was the dream of Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\n\"I am also very interested in collaborating with other singers, including those in the West. Nusratji collaborated with artists like Peter Gabriel, Massive Attack, Philip Glass, Patti Smith and Pearl Jam. I will definitely do it in the future. I feel that this music is my duty, to spread the message of Sufism. My future is that one day I will fulfil the desire of Nusratji to spread this message to the world.\"\n\nRahat is looking forward to his forthcoming concert entitled A Tribute to the Legend, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. It would be held in Dubai on July 5 at the Crystal Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency.\n\nA musical evening with Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is a marriage of the traditional and the contemporary. More than a dozen musicians and back-up vocalists would join Rahat in the generation of a unique musical symphony, which would utilise some modern instruments but would maintain the fervent, authentic spirit of the Qawwali culture.\n\nHarmoniums and percussion form the backdrop, as Rahat and his team would take you on a meditative and soulful journey, wrought with ecstatic poetry.\n\nThe appeal of Qawwali is an undeniable je ne sais quoi, which mesmerises the listener so as to completely immerse him/her into the very depths of music.\n\nIn Rahat's words, \"There is no soul in this world that will not be able to relate to our music. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's music spread far and wide because it was universal. It speaks of peace, love and brotherhood, and they do not require a language to propagate.\"\n\nWith a devoted, dedicated and gifted successor like Rahat Fateh Ali Khan determined to realise his dream, even though the legend himself may not be with us today, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's legacy will live on, forever."
