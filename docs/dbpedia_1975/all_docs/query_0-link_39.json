        "text": "Internet search giant Google on Tuesday paid tribute to Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on his birth anniversary.\n\nThe doodle showed the musician singing, his left hand raised to make the letter “l” in the word Google.\n\nBorn on October 13, 1948, Khan was primarily a singer of qawwali, the devotional music of the Sufis.\n\nThe singer died of a cardiac arrest at the age of 49 on August 16, 1997.\n\nLast week, another Pakistani singer Gulam Ali cancelled his concert in Maharashtra after the far-right political group Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt it."
