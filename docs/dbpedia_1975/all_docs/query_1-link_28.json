        "text": "Turning heavy and hulkingly powerful, yet also becoming nimble and pointedly precise - the vocalisations of the late Pakistani vocalist Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has come to epitomise not only the tradition of the Qawwali, but the art of singing itself.\n\nUstad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is considered one of the greatest performers of Qawwali, a Sufi devotional music characterised by simple melodies, forceful rhythms, and energetic improvisations that encourage a state of euphoria in the listener.\n\nHe is considered one of the greatest singers ever recorded - possessing a six-octave vocal range and he could perform at a high level of intensity for several hours.\n\nWidely credited with introducing Qawwali music to international audiences, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has popularly come to be known as \"Shahenshah-e-Qawwali\", meaning \"The King of Kings of Qawwali\".\n\nKhan sahab was described as the fourth greatest singer of all time by LA Weekly in 2016.\n\nBorn as Pervez Fateh Ali Khan in Faisalabad, Punjab on 13 October, 1948, the music maestro belonged to the Patiala Gharana - the tradition of Qawwali in Khan's family had passed down through successive generations for almost 600 years.\n\nKhan's father - Fateh Ali Khan, did not want his son to follow the family's vocation. The senior Khan had his heart set on Nusrat choosing a much more respectable career path and becoming a doctor or engineer because he felt Qawwali artists had low social status.\n\nHowever, Khan showed such an aptitude for and interest in Qawwali, that his father finally relented.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan had his first public performance at the age of 15, at his father's Chelum - the usual length of mourning after the death of a family member or loved one in some Muslim traditions.\n\nKhan became the head of the family Qawwali party in 1971.\n\nHe was signed by Oriental Star Agencies, Birmingham, England in the early 1980s. Khan went on to release movie scores and albums in Europe, India, Japan, Pakistan and the US He engaged in collaborations and experiments with Western artists, becoming a well-known world music artist.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan sahab toured extensively, performing in over 40 countries.\n\nIn addition to popularising Qawwali music, he also had a big impact on contemporary South Asian popular music, including Pakistani pop, Indi-pop and Bollywood music.\n\nIn 1988, Khan teamed up with Peter Gabriel on the soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ, which led to Khan being signed to Gabriel's Real World label.\n\nHe would go on to release five albums of traditional Qawwali through Real World, along with the more experimental albums Mustt Mustt (1990), Night Song (1996), and the posthumous remix album Star Rise (1997).\n\nUstad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's experimental collaborations with the Canadian guitarist Michael Brook, spurred on several further collaborations with a number of other Western composers and rock musicians.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy of these collaborations came in 1995, when Khan grouped with Eddie Vedder on two songs for the soundtrack to Dead Man Walking.\n\nKhan also provided vocals for The Prayer Cycle, which was put together by Jonathan Elias, but died before the tracks could be completed. Alanis Morissette was brought in to sing with his unfinished vocals.\n\nIn 2002, Gabriel included Khan's vocals on the posthumously released track \"Signal to Noise\" on his album Up. Khan's album Intoxicated Spirit was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album in 1997.\n\nThat same year, his album Night Song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album.\n\nIn August of 1997, Khan travelled to London to treat liver and kidney problems, he was rushed from the airport to Cromwell Hospital in London.\n\nHe died of a sudden cardiac arrest at Cromwell Hospital on 16 August, aged 48.\n\nHis body was repatriated to Faisalabad, and his funeral was a public affair. Khan's musical legacy is now carried forward by his nephews, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Rizwan-Muazzam.\n\nBefore his untimely demise, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan gave the world a number of soulful compositions that have since become timeless.\n\nHere is a list of songs from the myriad musical pieces Khan performed that can only hope to succinctly summarise the great vocalist and the greater tale of the philosophy behind the tunes and tone:\n\nDam Mast Qalandar\n\nDama Dam Mast Qalandar is a spiritual Sufi song written in honour of the most revered Sufi saint of Sindh, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar (1177–1274). The original poem was initially written by the famous 13th-century Persian Sufi philosopher-poet Amir Khusrow, then further modified by Punjabi philosopher-poet Bulleh Shah in the 18th century.\n\nWith origins dating back 600 years, \"Dama Dam Mast Qalandar\" is a popular traditional Sufi Islamic folk song across the northern Indian subcontinent as well as Iran. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and M Arshad composed a new song inspired by \"Dam Mast Qalandar\", with a different melody and arrangement.\n\nThe Bollywood music director Viju Shah used Khan's version to produce the hit song \"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast\" for the Bollywood film Mohra (1994).\n\nMere Rashq-e-Qamar\n\nThe beguiling and sui generis Ghazal-Qawwali - Mere Rashke Qamar (Oh Envy of the Moon) was written by Urdu poet Fana Buland Shehri and composed by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. It was first performed in 1988 by Khan, and popularized by him and his nephew Rahat Fateh Ali Khan several times in different concerts.\n\nThis song sees a lover comparing his beloved not with the moon as most often tend to, but rather saying that his beloved is the envy of the moon itself.\n\nTumhe Dil Lagi Bhool Jani Paregi\n\nThis Ghazal was written by lyricist Purnam Allahabadi and composed by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nIt sees one drawing comparisons between love and infatuation.\n\nYeh Joh Halka Halka Suroor Hian\n\nReleased in 1992, this song was composed by the king of Qawwali himself. The soulful composition and the lyrics tells of love - or rather the pleasantly intoxicating nature of it as one gradually falls more into it.\n\nFace of Love\n\nFace of Love is a musical piece from the soundtrack album to the famous film Dead Man Walking (1995).\n\nThe harrowing and powerful performance was delivered by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan collaborated with Eddie Vedder.\n\nTu Mera Dil Tu Meri Jaan\n\nThis very soothing and soulful song is about a lover expressing his love for his beloved.\n\nThe Punjabi lyrics convey the feeling of want, paired with Khan's craftiness with vocals making this song tour de force.\n\nAllah Hoo\n\nThis Qawwali is one of the finest examples of religious musical pieces - where Khan succinctly delivers the story of Prophet Muhammad and the creation of the world through his masterful chants and singing.\n\nNa Man Behooda Girde\n\nBased on a poem by the famous mystique Rumi, this Persian song saw Khan conveying Sufi philosophy and mysticism through his strong performance.\n\nSochta Hoon Ki Woh Kitne Masoom Thhay\n\nA good example of Urdu-Farsi poetry with its penchant for allegories, this one tells of a person wondering how their dear one has become a different person than they used to be. But it also serves as a symbol for the philosophy of deity and worship.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan delivered a marvellous performance during his Qawwali party conveying that thought.\n\nUssay Bhool Jaa\n\nA heartbreaking song about forgetting a loved one, with themes revolving around the monsoon and the rain. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's voice gave the sadness in the song a soliloquy.\n\nGham Hain Ya Kushi Hai Tu\n\nThe dilemma of glee and grief in the journey of life, and the corner of love is entailed through this song. Khan delivers a powerful performance, as was his forte - in conveying the juxtaposing emotions, and covet for love.\n\nIshq Da Rutba\n\nThis song was featured in the 1999 Bollywood movie Kartoos. The title of the song, Ishq Da Rutba (Value of love) is the recurrent theme of this passionate musical piece that Khan performed with utmost eloquence and vocal vigour.\n\nZindagi Jhoom Kar\n\nAnother one of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's works in Bollywood, this hope evoking love-song was featured in the 1997 Bollywood movie Aur Payar Ho Geya.\n\nThe musical chorus, and timely flute tune highlighted Khan's vocal prowess.\n\nAfreen Afreen\n\nPerhaps one of the most popular of Khan's musical works, Afreen Afreen is based on a Ghazal by the legendary Javed Akter.\n\nThe fiery elements of one's beloved that allures are told here.\n\nPiya Re Piya Re\n\nKhan's take on this Punjabi song is the vehemence of missing one's loved one and the feeling of unsettlement it brings. The mood of the song is jovial.\n\nZehal-e-Miskeen\n\nThis Qawwali is based on another poem written by Amir Khusro in Persian and Brij Bhasha. The Sufi take on misery and sadness is rendered through this one.\n\nDulhe Ka Sehra\n\nFeatured in the 2000 Bollywood movie Dhadkan, this song is set with a traditional Indian wedding in the background, and mostly from the bride's view. It tells of how amid the celebrations and colours, her heart still beats with nervousness, feeling being distant and the plights of memories.\n\nBujhi Hui Shama Ka Dhuwan Hoon\n\nIndian poet from the Vanarasi, Jigar Muradabadi penned this very succinct poem about existential philosophy, love, lamentations, separation and religion.\n\nNit Kahir Manga\n\nThis folk song is based on a poem about love, written from a woman's perspective who is seeking the well-being of her beloved. Penned by poet Badar Ali Ansari.\n\nKhan, yet again being the epitome of vocal art, bought out the emotions through his singing.\n\nAkhiyan Udeek Dian\n\nPenned by prominent Pakistani film composer, and lyricist Khawaja Pervez, this is a song about longing and the want to have the beloved by one's side.\n\nThe mention of nature's elements, such as the noise that birds make, or the change of seasons is given life through the finesse of Khan's singing and command over the musical chants."
