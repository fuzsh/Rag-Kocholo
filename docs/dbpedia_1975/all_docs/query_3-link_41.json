        "text": "Today, October 13th marks the 69th birth anniversary of Qawwali maestro Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Born to a Qawwal family in Lyallpur, now Faislabad, Khan learned his art through his family. However, initially his father did not want him to follow the family’s tradition of becoming a Qawwal but instead wanted him to choose a respectable career like doctor or engineer.\n\nKhan went on to become a Qawwali maestro whose voice transcended boundaries and borders. Khan is known for his versatility – classic qawwalis, international collaborations, ballads and Bollywood songs for films. Khan led his audience into a trance when he sang.\n\nUstad Nusrat’s birth name was Pervez Fateh Ali Khan and his nickname was Peji. He was the fifth child and first son of his parents. Khan inherited a 600 year old Qawwali tradition from his forefathers. He was so passionate about music that he made his first public appearance at the age of 16. The first instrument he learnt to play was Tabla.\n\nHe is popularly regarded as The King of Qawwali music (Shahenshah–e– Qawwali). Khan had great stamina for singing and would perform in shrines and villages whole day and night. He collaborated with a number of international artistes, such as Peter Gabriel. And, performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next wave Festival in United States of America in 1989. Khan received President of Pakistan’s Award for Pride of Performance in 1987 and UNESCO music award in 1995.\n\nNusrat Sahab had no sons and hence chose his nephew, Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to carry forward his legacy. He started training him at the age of three.\n\nEvery single song sung by the maestro is a masterpiece. Tumhe Dillagi, Piya Re Piya Re, Sanu Aik Pal Chain Na, Ye Jo Halka Halka Suroor, Dam Mast Qalandar, Mann Kunto Maula, Meray Piya Ghar Aya, Mere Rashq-e-Qamar, Allah Hoo Allah Hoo, Dam Hama Dam Ali Ali are some of Nusrat Sahab’s songs which defines his legacy. The ‘King of Qawwali’ may have left us but his songs will forever keep him alive."
