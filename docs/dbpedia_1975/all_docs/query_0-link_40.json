        "text": "His family have been musicans and singers of Qawwali (Islamic devotional music) for six centuries. Nusrat's father, himself a singer, died in 1964 when Nusrat was about 16. His father had wanted his son to become a doctor because Qawwali is a very challenging style to learn. Ten days after his father's death, Nusrat had a dream where his father came to him and told him to sing, touching his throat. Nusrat woke up singing, and gave his first public performance at his father's funeral ceremony forty days later."
