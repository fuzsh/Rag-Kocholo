        "text": "Famous for his catchy tunes and introduction of traditional Qawwali genre music to the modern audience, Ustaad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was born in Faisalabad on October 13, 1948. His voice and music truly defied the restriction of borders, a reason why he was equally popular in Indo-Pak subcontinent and across the world.\n\nUstaad Nusrat debuted in his glorious career of music with traditional Qawwalis. He gained international attention and fame through the World Music and Dance Festival after which, the magic of his voice transcended all boundaries.\n\nUstaad Nusrat also sang national song like Mera Inaam Pakistan and also became the voice of Kashmiris through his heartfelt song Janay Kab Hongay Kam to highlight the atrocities committed in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. These are the classics people still relate to today and will continue to do so in years to come.\n\nThe music maestro received unprecedented love and popularity in India as well where several music producers including Anu Malik stole his initial works. But later, Ustaad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was invited in India to sing and produce music for Bollywood.\n\nHe collaborated with artists like Javed Akhtar, Lata Mungeshkar, Asha Bhosle and AR Rehman on various projects. His contributions to Bollywood are Koi Jane Koi Na Jane for Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya film, Saya Bhi Saath Jab Chhod Jaye for Sunny Deol starrer Dillagi and Dulhe Ka Sehra from the film Dhadkan.\n\nSome of the awards he won are Pride of Performance Award by President of Pakistan, UNESCO Music Prize, Grand Prix des Ameriques at Montreal World Film Festival and Arts and Culture Prize of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes. The awards and honours he won posthumously are the \"Legends\" award at the UK Asian Music Awards, Time magazine s \"60 Years of Asian Heroes\", NPR’s 50 Great Voices list, CNN’s list of twenty most iconic musicians and 14th position in UGO’s list of the best singers of all time.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan died at the age of 48 on August 16, 1997 due to kidney failure, leaving fans worldwide shocked. A feeling expressed very well by Khan sahib in another one of his Qawwalis:\n\nThe music maestro released as many as 25 Qawwali albums which earned him several awards and honours. His massive hit Haq Ali Ali and Dam Mast Qalandar became household anthems, something that became Ustaad’s introduction for years to come.\n\nOther popular records include Akhiyan Udeek Diyan, Yaar Na Wichray, Mera Piya Ghar Aya and Meri Zindagi. Among his many Sufi songs, Wohi Khuda Hay remained prominent as a spirituality-sparking song for the years to come."
