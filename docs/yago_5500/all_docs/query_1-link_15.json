        "text": "The jury’s statement:\n\n‘In his series “Gernstl unterwegs”, he travels around the borders of Bavaria with a small team, camera operator Hans Peter Fischer and sound recordist Stefan Ravasz, and invites people to chat.\n\nHis unobtrusive questioning, which is always friendly and remains respectful, gets the interviewees to open up. We get to hear what is still the most interesting thing people have to offer: stories.’\n\nA movie review states:\n\n“Three friends travel in a VW bus through Germany, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol. One has a camera, the other a microphone and the third simply the talent to listen. They usually arrive at their destinations by chance along the way: people.\n\nNo one in particular, no famous or no infamous people, but simply people who talk a bit (or a lot) about what they do and what drives them. And at times you see a little glimmer of what we call happiness."
