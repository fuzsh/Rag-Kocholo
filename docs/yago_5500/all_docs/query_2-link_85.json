        "text": "Nova’s work focuses on visual arts and camera operation, specializing in wildlife, expedition, and underwater documentary filmmaking. Throughout their career they’ve collaborated with organizations such as National Geographic, Discovery, Netflix, Pristine Seas, NOAA, Ocean Exploration Trust, and more. As a science communicator, Nova works to bridge the gaps between science and art, and has a robust portfolio of creative projects across mediums. Complementing this work, they routinely sail as a Video Engineer and Expedition Documentarian aboard the E/V Nautilus, operating deep-sea ROV camera and broadcast systems while documenting groundbreaking science and exploration operations. Recently, they released their first independent documentary, Diving for Rays, which is now available for global streaming on Waterbear Network. In addition to television networks, their work has been featured in several podcasts, magazines, and articles, and they have been engaging new audiences by guest speaking for panels, events, and schools. Nova is also highly involved in film festivals, serving as a participant, judge, and panelist. As a long-time board member of the Jackson Wild Queer Collective, they’ve been working to create spaces and events for creatives across the globe to meet and collaborate."
