        "text": "\"His musical touch hasn't left my ear.\" Sony Pictures Classics has unveiled a full US trailer for a fascinating, jazzy Spanish documentary called They Shot the Piano Player, which first premiered at the Annecy Film Festival in France this summer. It's a doc made by filmmakers Fernando Trueba & Javier Mariscal (of Chico & Rita) telling the true story of a missing pianist. A New York music journalist goes on a quest to uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of the young Brazilian piano virtuoso Tenorio Jr. - in full Francisco Tenório Júnior. A celebratory origin story of the world-renowned Latino musical movement Bossa Nova, They Shot The Piano Player captures a fleeting time bursting with creative freedom at a turning point in Latin American history in the 60s and 70s, just before the continent was engulfed by totalitarian regimes. Starring Jeff Goldblum as the voice of Jeff Harris, with Caetano Veloso & Joao Gilberto. It has some stunning animation that may seem basic but is quite vivid and dynamic. This is all my jam - I'll be watching.\n\nHere's the full trailer (+ poster) for Mariscal & Trueba's doc The Shot the Piano Player, from YouTube:\n\nAnd here's another international festival trailer for The Shot the Piano Player, also found on YouTube:"
