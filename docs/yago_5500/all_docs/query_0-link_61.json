        "text": "Directed by Leander HauÃmann\n\nRambaZamba Theater\n\nA closed ward of a mental facility. A newcomer who challenges the prevailing order. MiloÅ¡ Forman's 1975 film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel is one of the greatest successes in US film history. At the Oscars, it won all five top categories, including best film, director, screenplay, leading actor, and leading actress. Since then, it has become a cult classic. Leander HauÃmann's stage production also gained cult status quickly since its premiere in Berlin. \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is HauÃmannâs first production at RambaZamba Theater, one of the best-known inclusive theaters in the German-speaking world.\n\nTogether with his excellent cast, HauÃmann investigates what is considered 'normal' in society, only to turn it upside down. In the cuckoo's nest of the closed ward, Head Nurse Ratched reigns supreme. Every day is the same: pills, food distribution, therapy, pills. Everyone's head is spinning, no one fights back. When the newcomer Randle McMurphy arrives, he begins to question Ratchedâs reign. \"Who's crazy here?\" he yells over and over again into the silent room. This is not going to end well.\n\nLast year saw the release of Leander HauÃmann's feature film \"StasikomÃ¶die,\" which is the conclusion of his GDR trilogy that includes \"Sonnenallee\" (2000) and \"NVA\" (2005). From 1995 to 2000 he was the artistic director at the Schauspielhaus Bochum. Now he returns to the Ruhr area after a long absence with his brilliant new production."
