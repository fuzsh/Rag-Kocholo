        "text": "As a follow-up to my “History of German Theatre” graduate seminar last semester (when relevant performances were sparse), we continued to see shows together that relate in one way or another to Germany.\n\nDuring the last weeks, we saw four interesting productions that were quite different in style and scope. Our discussion was lively and went many ways, from the various merits of seats close to stage or far away to cross-gender/gender-neutral casting and use of microphones. The four productions fall in various categories of “German theatre” in Korea – one isn’t “German” at all, the other three translate and/or adapt German plays to varying degrees (for some theoretical thoughts sparked by an earlier seminar, see these two posts). Here are a few thoughts and notes on these four works:\n\n1. The Red Organ (붉은 오르골, March 15, 2023)\n\nA Korean original play by Jeong Jae-chun (정재춘), produced by ensemble No-eul (극단 노을) and directed by Lee Sin-yeong (이신영) as part of the 2023 Korea Theater Festival (대한민국연극제), a competition that highlights “local” productions, at Guro Arts Valley Theater. The quite melodramatic story of a journalist approaching a prize-winning novelist, an Korean adoptee grown up in Germany now back in Korea in search of his mother, a former ‘comfort woman’, uses Korean-German history as a backdrop, mostly a plot device that allows for complicated family drama. The titular “organ” (German “Orgel”), a music box with moving figurines (as shown on the poster), serves as a stand-in for the somehow romanticized image of Germany projected here. Not easy to follow, the plot twists unfold mostly in Korean, although some German and Japanese phrases – the writer settled down in Japan – spice up this fiction about an individual lost in the passage of time.\n\n2. Faust (파우스트, March 31, 2023)\n\nA large-scale show directed by Yang Jeong-ung (양정웅) of Pyeongchang Winter Olympics opening show fame at the new LG Arts Center in Western Seoul. Thanks to early bird booking, the tickets were not completely out of reach, but I was surprised that the three-floor theatre was filled almost to the last seat. Well, we attended the premiere and, as a student later pointed out, the show’s rehearsals had been featured on primetime news. Indeed, the cast comprised mostly of actors known from movies and TV series, as well as musicals. Park Hae-soo (박해수) from Squid Game played Mephisto, veteran Yu In-chon (유인촌) the old Faust, with Park Eun-seok (박은석) as the young Faust and Won Jin-ah (원진아) as Gretchen, her first stage role, adding to the hype.\n\nAccordingly, poster and teaser video focus on the actors, while taglines like “고전 중의 고전” (“classic among classics”) or “불멸의 희곡” (“immortal play”) stress the work’s universality. It seems very much in line with earlier major Faust productions that likewise boasted star power, such as Jang Min-ho (장민호) and Kim Dong-won (김동원), maybe the two best-known actors of their generation, as Faust-Mephisto in the very first Korean Faust from 1966 (for a short history of Korean Faust-reception up to 2000, see Rhee Won-Yang’s article in Korean or German). This new version might have added some contemporary costumes, effects (much smoke!), and video but felt relatively conventional, with most of the text left intact and, as far as I can tell, no scene completely cut.\n\nA recent Faust production by the National Theatre Company (국립극단), titled Faust Ending (파우스트 엔딩, 2021), featured a female Faust (Kim Seong-nyeo 김성녀), a cross-over monodrama performed by Jeong Dong-hwan (정동환) contrasted Goethe’s scholar with Dostojevsky’s Grand Inquisitor from The Brothers Karamazov (대심문관과 파우스트, 2020), and another production shown at Seoul Arts Center even switched focus to Mephisto (thus the title, 메피스토, 2014) played by a woman actor and used quite imaginative stage design (which later faced allegations of being ripped off a 2007 production from Romania, though).\n\nIn any case, what we saw felt more like a well-made movie to me, with animated backdrop and voices coming from the sound system. Even on 3rd floor and way back, the distance to the stage didn’t matter very much. Still, it has been a while since I saw Faust back in high school (in Bochum, Urfaust directed by Leander Haußmann) and it was fun – and more intelligible than I had thought – to hear the familiar lines in Korean.\n\n3. Herrinnen (여주인들, Engl. “Mistresses”, April 7 & 8, 2023)\n\nThe latest production by “Auf die Bretter”, Ewha’s German-language drama club (a quite common practice referred to as 원어극, original-language theatre) of the play by Theresia Walser – and after the 2014 premiere in Mannheim and a 2015 production at Odense Theater, Denmark, the second production one outside of Germany.\n\nThis is the synopsis provided by the publisher, Rowohlt Theaterverlag:\n\nEven prizes come at a price – as five women who have been nominated by the state for their “feminine lifetime achievements” will find out. Only one can be the winner, and so, shortly before the award ceremony, a competition ensues about who had to make the biggest sacrifices. Was it Rita who had laboured her way up the old-fashioned way, from secretary to CEO of a globally operating conglomerate? Was it the top executive Tanja whom Rita considers to be the epitomical “Harvard consulting chick” and who, despite her four children, also holds a leading position? Or is it Martha, a judge known for her strictness, who presently has put all plans for a family on ice – literally – and who found herself, at the beginning of her career, “with four men’s toilets, that’s it”? Shouldn’t Katie, the socially active Kindergarten teacher, get the award? Or Brenda, the mathematician, who is transgender and had herself turned into a woman? Even the word “feminine” is rejected by all five of them because it alludes to genderism. Until it becomes clear that we are actually watching five actors/actresses rehearsing a play, and this gives the term “female roles” a new dimension.\n\nPerformed by five women, in German with Korean surtitles (translated by the students themselves!), the production added a further layer to this exploration of female roles. And after three seasons of online theatre, the play was well-attended and received much applause. Big congratulations to the whole team!\n\n4. Woyzeck (보이첵, April 12, 2023)\n\nAnother interpretation of a German classic, this time in a much more creative, “physical” way by Sadari Movement Lab (사다리움직임연구소). The performers used chairs to get together and break apart, to fight and fall in love with each other. This show is actually rather old and was shown on (mostly mime?) festivals around the world. We had read the play last spring in my “German Classic Drama”-seminar and thus noticed that the few lines of text spoken were quite close to the original. Mostly, though, it was an acrobatic group choreography with strong lighting effects and – surprisingly – Piazzolla tracks. Clearly made for easy understanding and almost “non-verbal”, this was still an interesting way of remaking the 19th-century material for 21st-century audiences (another would be the Woyzeck in the Dark-musical on rerun at the same time).\n\nThese four productions might not be the most representative examples for the role of German-language drama (or “Germany” in general) in Korean theatre – even though Faust gained considerable media coverage and Woyzeck has become an evergreen –, but they span a quite wide spectrum, from the experimental to the popular, from the language-centered to the (almost) non-verbal. For the rest of the semester, we couldn’t find anything else in that vein (yet), so we’ll see Chekhow’s Cherry Orchard (which featured heavily in an eponymous 2008 Japanese movie, a remake of a 1990 movie, as a student noted), later in May.\n\n— 15 March 2023 (水), 31 March 2023 (金), 7 & 8 April 2023 (金, 土), 12 April 2023 (水)"
