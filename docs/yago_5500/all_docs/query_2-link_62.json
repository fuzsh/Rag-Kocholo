His film Belle Epoque (1993) won both the Academy Award and BAFTA for Foreign Language Film. Trueba’s Latin jazz documentary Calle 54 (2000) saw the birth of his collaboration and friendship with Javier Mariscal, who also co-directed They Shot the Piano Player (2024).\n\nJavier Mariscal is a Spanish artist and designer who works in a wide range of mediums, including paint, sculpture, and landscaping. His work in film has largely been in partnership with Fernando Trueba. The pair first collaborated on the jazz documentary Calle 54 (2000) and paired up again for Chico & Rita (2012)—a film which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature Film. They Shot the Piano Player (2024) is Mariscal and Trueba’s third collaborative feature.\n\nSee our upcoming films\n\nMAJOR SUPPORT\n\nOhio Arts Council\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nThe Columbus Foundation\n\nCampus Partners\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts"
