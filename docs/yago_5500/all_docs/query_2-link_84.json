        "text": "It is an age of men and beasts. Centuries of war have left nothing more than a dying planet for conquest. Habitable lands have become scarce and Toxic lands span to the edge of the world. Hidden beneath the desolation lives the Mad Doctor Mindskull. Originally created to be the first Super being, but when fears arose he was split in two dividing his superior strength from his superior mind. Although physical strength could be contained, a mind so powerful could not, and Dr. Mindskull became an uncontrollable danger capable of anything imaginable and what even thought impossible. Now plotting against the human race he has created the ultimate weapon. Using the planets core essence of life and creation, there is the power of death and total annihilation. Can mankind find away to stop Dr. Mindskull before his vision of a new world is complete. The only answer lies out of reach, lies... within the Nova Seed.\n\nBorn and raised in Canada, Nick always had a passion for drawing and film-making. Graduating with Honors from the Sheridan College Classical Animation program, he began his career in the video game industry. He moved to Japan where he worked as \"Animation Director\". Now founder of his own animation studio \"Gorgon Pictures Inc.\" Nick has self-produced, animated and directed two fully 2D hand-drawn animated feature films. His first feature film \"Nova Seed\" had an impressive film festival run, earning multiple awards and leaving audiences wanting more from the beautiful world it envisioned."
