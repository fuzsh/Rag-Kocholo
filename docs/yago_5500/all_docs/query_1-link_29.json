        "text": "ThehistoryofSchauspielhausBochum\n\nThe history of Schauspielhaus Bochum begins in 1908 when the Apollo Theater, a variety theatre belonging to the property developer Clemens Erlemann, opens in the Königsallee. From 1910 a city “theatre commission” supports the theatre’s management and subsidises it with civic funds. After Erlemann goes bankrupt the city buys the theatre building in January 1914. However, during the First World War only visiting productions are performed there. The Bochum City Theatre opens on 30 December 1915 with Friedrich Schiller’s Don Carlos, a visiting production from the Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus.\n\n1919 – 1949\n\nThe moment when Schauspielhaus Bochum was founded is considered to be the appointment of Saladin Schmitt as Artistic Director. Schmitt hires the first Bochumer Ensemble in November 1918 and opens the city-owned company with Franz Grillparzer’s Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen on 15 April 1919.\n\n1949 – 1972\n\nSaladin Schmitt is succeeded as Artistic Director by Hans Schalla in the 1949/1950 season. Schmitt ran the Schauspielhaus throughout the Weimar Republic, the era of National Socialism, the period of occupation and into the first year of the Federal Republic.\n\n1972 – 1979\n\nWith the appointment of Peter Zadek as Artistic Director from 1972, director’s theatre arrives in Bochum. Zadek brings young directors who have trained in Britain to the theatre. Rainer Werner Fassbinder and his actors from the Munich “anti-theater” is also a guest in Bochum.\n\n1979 – 1986\n\nThe Schauspielhaus flourishes once again from the beginning of the 1980s under the Artistic Directorship of Claus Peymann. The Bochumer Ensemble, with stars such as Gert Voss, Kirsten Dene and Traugott Buhre is regarded as the most innovative theatre in the Federal Republic at this time.\n\n1986 – 1995\n\nAfter Peymann left for the Vienna Burgtheater in 1986, Frank-Patrick Steckel takes over as Director in the Königsallee. He creates a more thoughtful theatre with fewer effects and brings directors such as Andrea Breth and Jürgen Gosch to Bochum for the first time.\n\n1995 – 2000\n\nIn 1995 Leander Haußmann arrives at the theatre as Germany’s youngest Artistic Director. In deliberate contrast to his predecessors Haussmann, together with his fellow directors Jürgen Kruse and Dimiter Gotscheff, announces a modern theatre influenced by pop culture that successfully appeals to a younger audience.\n\n2000 – 2005\n\nLeander Haußmann is followed in 2000 by Matthias Hartmann, who also succeeds in generating publicity with coups such as hiring Harald Schmidt and a series of acclaimed productions.\n\n2005 – 2010\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010 Elmar Goerden takes over as Artistic Director. He arrives with the slogan Von hier aus (“From This Point”) and promises a serious repertoire concentrating on classics old and new from Shakespeare to Botho Strauss.\n\n2010 – 2017\n\nAnselm Weber is Artistic Director in the Königsallee from 2010 to 2017. In addition to artists from the Ruhr region and all over Germany he also invites international guests to work at the theatre. They present their perspectives on the future, on Europe and what they find in the region.\n\n2017 / 2018\n\nOlaf Kröck’s season as Artistic Director in 2017/2018 is characterised by theatre productions that have not previously been seen in Bochum, such as the world premiere of Lars von Trier’s Melancholia and two commissioned works by Laura Naumann and Nesrin Şamdereli.\n\nThe Present\n\nThe Dutch theatremaker and director Johan Simons has been the Artistic Director of Schauspielhaus Bochum since 2018/2019. He regards the Schauspielhaus as a repertoire and ensemble theatre in its most modern form: a place where the visual arts, theatre and dance meet – as do politics, pop music and artists from many different nations. The new acting ensemble shows cultural influences from numerous countries in Europe and around the world. Alongside contemporary interpretations of classical texts the repertoire consists of world premieres and devised works. A new centre for media arts, the Oval Office, opens in the theatre’s basement which audiences may visit free of charge. For the first time since the era of Reinhild Hoffmann Zeche Eins is again regularly used as a venue for performances. The series Konzerte im Schauspielhaus powered by Brost-Stiftung presents a wide range of musicians working outside the mainstream.\n\nThehistoryofJungesSchauspielhausBochum\n\n2000 – 2005\n\nThe Junge Schauspielhaus Bochum was officially founded in 2000. Under the artistic direction of Anette Raffalt, various productions of theatre plays for children and young people are created, while youth clubs and workshops for young people are offered.\n\n2005 – 2018\n\nFrom 2005-2018, Martina van Boxen establishes the Junges Schauspielhaus Bochum as a place of encounter, communication and creativity - with educational trainings, workshops, youth clubs and director's workshops in the fields of theatre, dance, music, media and literature. Professional in-house productions for children from the age of three, artistic works with young people and adults, diverse cooperation projects flow into the extensive repertoire.\n\nThe Present\n\nWith the 2018/2019 season, Cathrin Rose takes over as artistic director of the Junges Schauspielhaus, whose programme is characterised by new narrative forms for a modern and diverse urban society. In addition to plays for the whole family, artistic productions are developed with children, young people and adults. The theatre education programme is also aimed at people with disabilities and includes dance, puppet theatre and research projects.\n\nFrom the 2020 season onwards, a separate venue for children's and youth theatre is established – the Theaterrevier. With the support of the Ministry of Culture and Science in North Rhine-Westphalia as part of the Neue Wege programme, a new, vibrant theatre and meeting space for all generations is opened on the former site of the Prinz Regent collierywhich stands for creativity and dialogue between art and pedagogy. The Drama Control, a children's and youth supervisory board consisting of 15 people between the ages of 4 and 21, manages the Theaterrevier together with the team of the Junges Schauspielhaus.\n\nArtistic Directors\n\nSaladin Schmitt (1919 – 1949)\n\nHans Schalla (1949 – 1972)\n\nPeter Zadek and directorate (1972 – 1979)\n\nClaus Peymann (1979 – 1986)\n\nFrank-Patrick Steckel (1986 – 1995)\n\nLeander Haußmann (1995 – 2000)\n\nMatthias Hartmann (2000 – 2005)\n\nElmar Goerden (2005 – 2010)\n\nAnselm Weber (2010 – 2017)\n\nOlaf Kröck (2017/2018)\n\nJohan Simons (since 2018)\n\nFurther information\n\nFurther and more detailed information about Schauspielhaus Bochum and its previous Artistic Directors can be researched in the Bochum City Archives.
