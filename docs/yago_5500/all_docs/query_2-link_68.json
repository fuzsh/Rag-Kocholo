        "text": "A documentary chronicling the murderous terror attack on the Nova Music Festival in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 will debut on Paramount+. The streamer announced on Thursday (May 16) that the See It Now Studios Original Documentary We Will Dance Again will get a worldwide premiere in the fall, a year after the surprise assault by Hamas militants left more than 400 dead and dozens kidnapped at the peaceful desert EDM gathering.\n\n“The human cost of what happened on October 7th in Israel, and the war in Gaza, has been catastrophic. We can’t tell everyone’s story. This film is about innocent young people, forced to fight for their survival,” said See It Now Studios president Susan Zirinsky in a statement. “It is a painful story of unfathomable tragedy, and also of bravery, sacrifice and heroism.”\n\nA description of the film notes that Nova Music was “supposed to be a celebration of life, love, and music for thousands of young people but became one of the first targets when Hamas launched the deadliest terror attack in Israel’s history.” The film recreates the day of the worst terror attack in Israel’s as told through the eyes of more than a dozen survivors of the Nova assault, many of whom videotaped their experience as the massacre was taking place. In addition, the film will include eyewitness accounts from more than a dozen survivors, as well as footage taken by both the victims and the Hamas assailants.\n\nThe film was directed by Yariv Mozer (The Devil’s Confession: The Lost Eichmann Tapes).\n\nThe surprise assault on the festival was part of a coordinated attack from Hamas militants, who crossed the border into Israel on the morning of Oct. 7, killing more than 1,200 Israeli men, women and children according to Israeli authorities, as well as taking more than 250 hostages, nearly half of whom are still believed to be held — alive or dead — in Gaza."
