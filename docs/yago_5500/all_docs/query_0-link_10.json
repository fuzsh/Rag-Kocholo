        "text": "Daniel, what first sparked your interest in acting and led you down this career path?\n\nI was watching Ghostbusters at the end of the 80s and I decided, “This is what I want to do when I grow up!” Busting ghosts? No, acting in movies is full of fun and fantasy. During that time, I landed my first leading role in our school theatre play, in which I played the king. I found it easy to learn my lines, and I had a very loud voice, so the teacher thought I was perfect for that part.\n\nAfter bowing down to the audience and listening to the applause, I realized this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I found my purpose very early. Typical for a Capricorn.\n\nCould you share with us what your experience was like growing up as the son of nurses in Berlin-Neukölln?\n\nMy whole family is from Berlin; our roots are deep. My parents are very down-to-earth and yet very special. For me, it’s always good to come home to my parents’ house and calm down. They are proud but not my “fans,” you know?\n\nYour film debut came with Leander Haußmann’s movie NVA; how did this initial experience shape your acting career?\n\nI think it changed everything for me. I was so naive when I landed that role. And it was so well written. The late casting director Simone Bär taped my audition behind the director’s back because he didn’t want to invite me to the casting process. Later she showed him the tape, and he was convinced to invite me to a live audition, which was crazy. Full of improv, and I had to show my whole range of talent… Leander Haußmann was satisfied, and they offered me the role. During the shooting process, he wrote a whole new scene for me, which was a long funny, heartwarming monologue. I was so excited and didn’t want to mess up. But in the end, it was just a wonderful experience, and the scene was kind of groundbreaking for me."
