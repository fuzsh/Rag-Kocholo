        "text": "FOUR OSCARS®: ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT MAKES GERMAN OSCAR® HISTORY\n\nFortunately, the German Films brunch took place indoors at La République in Los Angeles. And most importantly: The bad weather didn't hurt the mood in the restaurant at all. There were about 70 guests plus three camera teams (ARD, ZDF, Pro Sieben) and from the writing press Barbara Munker, DPA and Marc Pitzke from Der Spiegel were present. Steven Gätjen tuned in for the Red Carpet Live coverage with the German Films brunch as well.\n\nIn addition to local representatives from production companies, talent agencies, festivals and other mulitplicators, the team of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT was of course the main focus.\n\nThe team was in a great mood - it was almost a bit of a family reunion for them, as many saw each other for the first time since the end of the film shoot of ALL QUIET. The overall atmosphere at the event was very relaxed and conversation flowed easily.\n\nOn Friday evening, the approximately one-hour INTERNATIONAL FEATURE FILM panel took place at the Academy Museum's David Geffen Theatre in the presence of the five nominated directors. Moderated by Rajendra Roy and director Susanne Bier (Co-Chairs International Feature Film Executive Committee), the event had an exceptional atmosphere full of respect and appreciation for foreign language film and the importance to the Academy. The conversation was very much about LANGUAGE as a cultural identity.\n\nAt noon on Saturday, the traditional two-hour reception for OSCAR®nominees took place at the Villa Aurora artists' residence, with German Films participating.\n\nIf you can't get enough of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT then listen to our Deep Dive Genre in-depth podcast episodes with OSCAR®-winner Edward Berger as well as the films costume designer, OSCAR®-nominee Lisy Christl.\n\nNEW EPISODES – SHORT TAKE: A GERMAN FILMS PODCAST\n\nEpisode 40 - 23 March:\n\nMaeve Metelka recently charmed us in SACHERTORTE. And although she was in the middle of theatre rehearsals for CLOCKWORK ORANGE we had a wonderful chat, which incidentally ever so slightly turned into an Astrid Lindgren and Christine Nöstlinger appreciation podcast.\n\nEpisode 41 - 13 April:\n\nFilms, Films, Films – for director Lukas Nathrath it’s all about going to the cinema and talking about the films seen with friends later. Although he does have a soft spot for YouTube videos about American political scandals – and a good Wiener Schnitzel.\n\nSHORT TAKE: A GERMAN FILMS PODCAST has already racked up more than 20.000 listeners from various countries since the format’s launch - and more are joining with each new episode.\n\nYou can find all of the episodes on our website and wherever podcasts are available.\n\nSHORT TAKE on Instagram!\n\nAWARDS AND PREMIERES AT THE CLERMONT-FERRAND SHORT FILM FESTIVAL\n\nThe International Competition and the Lab Competition presented eight German productions, another seven shorts were screened in the special programs. The Grand Prix of the International Competition was awarded to the WILL MY PARENTS COME TO SEE ME by Mo Harawe (AT/DE/SO). SUBTOTALS by Mohammadreza Farzad (PL/DE/IR, Road River Films) received the Best Documentary Award and a Special Mention of the Lab Competition Jury. With its short film market and a broad spectrum of industry activities, Clermont-Ferrand is the world's most important festival specialising in short films. Together with the AG Kurzfilm, German Films organised a booth at the film market where it provided information about the new online catalogue and presented the traditional market screenings of the MATINÉE ALLEMANDE with nine new German shorts as well as of the new edition of the biennial program EMERGING ARTISTS.\n\nThe 18th edition of the German-French cooperation program SOIRÉE ALLEMANDE celebrated its premiere to a packed cinema on 30 January. Six new films representing the diversity of German short filmmaking were selected from the more than 470 German submissions to the festival: the documentary BORDER CONVERSATIONS by Jonathan Brunner, the experimental documentary THE GUARDIANS OF REFUSE: A SHORT HISTORY OF GARBAGE by Susann Maria Hempel, the animation HELLO STRANGER by Julia Ocker, and the fiction shorts DESIRED CHILD by Laura Solbach, I WAS NEVER REALLY HERE by Gabriel B. Arrahnio and IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE TODAY by Sophia Groening. The directors Gabriel B. Arrahnio, Jonathan Brunner and Laura Solbach attended the premiere and the following Q&A with Anne Gaschütz (Locarno Festival, Filmfest Dresden), held during the traditional reception of the German Consulate Lyon. The short film program is a collaboration between AG Kurzfilm, German Films, the International Short Film Festival Clermont-Ferrand, the Goethe-Institute Lyon and the Kurzfilm Agentur Hamburg and will go on tour as SHORT EXPORT. The program can be booked by the Goethe-Institutes and their partners around the globe, it’s available with English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Russian subtitles.\n\nAn overview of all German films in Clermont-Ferrand is available here.\n\nGERMAN SHORT FILMS 2023 – ONLINE CATALOGUE\n\nThe first catalogue update for 2023 with a total of 25 new shorts was published in January in time for the Clermont-Ferrand Short Film Festival and Market. The members of the AG Kurzfilm – German Short Film Association and a jury selected a broad spectrum of short films - fiction films, animated films, experimental films and documentaries as well as various hybrid forms. All of the short films added to the catalogue had their festival premiere very recently or are just about to premiere.\n\nEveryone interested can search for German short films in the online catalogue using a wide range of functions, keywords, themes, categories, etc. International film professionals can also screen the films online after registering. More than 900 short films produced since 2004 are now available for viewing. The selection process is currently underway for the films for the next update which will go online in mid-May around the time of the Festival de Cannes.\n\nKINO! GERMANY NOW!\n\nCurated by SXSW film programmer Jim Kolmar, these titles are “idiosyncratic, visionary and inventive, striking a balance between the accessible and the conceptually challenging. It was a true pleasure to curate this selection of films for the KINO! Germany NOW! program. Taken together, the original, substantial pool of potential titles represents a significant berth of themes, influences, aesthetics and, most importantly, talent. Narrowing them down to five was a daunting task, but I believe the results represent a vibrant distillation of the energetic innovation that characterizes German film. While each title is distinct, the selected titles are a collective attempt to reckon with themes of human connection, alienation and emotional intimacy. They aim to tackle the anxieties of the current moment, with an eye on the past, present and future. It’s been a thrill and privilege to help make these films available, and I’m looking forward to seeing how audiences respond.”\n\nAll films are preceded by a short film selected by the German Short Film Association:\n\nA E I O U: A QUICK ALPHABET OF LOVE by Jan Soldat’s STAGING DEATH\n\nAXIOM by Alison Kuhn’s FLUFFY TALES\n\nKISS MY WOUNDS by Frédéric Jaeger’s THE DELUGE\n\nTHE ORDINARIES by Jonatan Schwenk’s ZOON\n\nSORRY COMRADE by Jonas Riemer’s THE ONE WHO CROSSED THE SEA\n\nFrom the beginning of April through the end of June 2023, the KINO! Germany NOW! film program is available for in-person screenings in theaters, art house cinemas, regional and local film festivals, film societies, and other venues in the United States. We are pleased to offer special booking conditions for these films, both as a package and individually. For more information, please contact our partner Kino Lorber.\n\nKINO!
