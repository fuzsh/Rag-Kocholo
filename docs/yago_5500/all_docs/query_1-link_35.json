        "text": "A chronicler of social inequality in a system of colonial oppression\n\nAlexander von Humboldt became an acclaimed chronicler of social inequality, his voyages of exploration earning him worldwide renown. His documenting of enslavement on sugar cane plantations in Cuba, and the inhumane work of the ‘cargueros’ carrying wealthy people on their backs through the Andes, for example, portrayed the unvarnished truth of their lives. But equally, Humboldt’s discoveries and achievements are themselves based on a system of colonial oppression. This aspect of Humboldt’s legacy is reflected in, among other things, the ruthless invasion of hitherto protected spaces and territories that was only made possible by Humboldt’s close contact with colonial rulers. Even the fact that he was able to go on a world tour at all, going on to publish his experiences and research results, and gain widespread renown, was something Alexander von Humboldt owed to his friendly ties with the Prussian and Spanish royal families.\n\nAgainst this background, how are we to interpret Humboldt’s inner compass, his attitude to all of this? Which side was he on – the side of the oppressed or the rulers? Or somewhere in between? What was he prepared to accept for the sake of his achievements and scientific discoveries? And not least: was he aware of his own conflict of interest?"
