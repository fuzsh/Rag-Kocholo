While teaching in San Antonio, Saint Mary’s Hall honored him with the school’s first Master Teacher Award.\n\nWhile teaching full time, Riordan began writing mystery novels for grownups. His Tres Navarre series went on to win the top three national awards in the mystery genre – the Edgar, the Anthony and the Shamus.

Rick and his wife Becky are both executive producers overseeing TV/film adaptations of his works including Percy Jackson, the Kane Chronicles and Daughter of the Deep.\n\nRick Riordan now writes full-time.
