BERLIN — Helmer Leander Haussmann, who enjoyed critical and box office success last year with “Berlin Blues,” has begun “NVA,” a comedy-drama about the East German military.

Pic marks a thematic return to the German Democratic Republic for the East German-born helmer and stage director, who made a huge splash with “Sun Alley,” his 1999 debut film about kids growing up in 1970s East Berlin.

“NVA” looks at draftees in East Germany’s National People’s Army (NVA). The film is being shot on location at a former NVA military base in the Saxon town of Bad Dueben.

Penned by Haussmann and Thomas Brussig, whose novel “Sonnenallee” was the basis for “Sun Alley,” pic stars Kim Frank, Oliver Broecker, Maxim Mehmet, Philippe Graber and Detlev Buck.

Buck, who recently won the German Film Award for supporting actor for his stint in “Berlin Blues,” is producing “NVA” with partner Claus Boje. Their joint company, Boje Buck Produktion, also produced “Berlin Blues” and “Sun Alley.”

Commercial broadcaster Sat 1 is co-producing “NVA” with support from state and federal subsidies Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, the German Federal Film Board, Mitteldeutsche Medienfoerderung, Filmfoerderung Hamburg and BKM Filmfoerderung.

Boje’s distrib shingle Delphi Filmverleih will release “NVA” in local theaters next summer.
