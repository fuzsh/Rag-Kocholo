Evaluation allows the quality of the model to be assessed but it's also an opportunity to see if it meets the initial request. (8th in methodology)\n\nThe ROC curve is a useful diagnostic tool in determining the optimal classification model. This curve quantifies how well a binary classification model performs, declassifying the yes and no outcomes when some discrimination criterion is varied.\n\nModel evaluation can have two main phases: a diagnostic measure phase and statistical significance testing.\n\nQuiz\n\nSelect the correction statement. -- a training set is used for predictive modelling\n\nA statistician calls a false-negative, a type I error, and a false-positive, a type II error. -- False (false-negative == type II; false-positive == type II)\n\nThe Modelling stage is followed by the Analytic Approach stage. -- False\n\nModel Evaluation includes ensuring that the data are properly handled and interpreted. -- True\n\nThe ROC curve is a useful diagnostic tool for determining the optimal classification model. -- True\n\nData Science Methodology -- Week 3\n\nFrom Deployment to Feedback\n\nOnce the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work, it is deployed and put to the ultimate test. Depending on the purpose of the model, it may be rolled out to a limited group of users or in a test environment, to build up confidence in applying the outcome for use across the board. (9th in methodology)\n\nOnce in play, feedback from the users will help to refine the model and assess it for performance and impact. The value of the model will be dependent on successfully incorporating feedback and making adjustments for as long sa the solution is required. (10th in methodology)\n\nThe data science methodology is highly iterative, ensuring the refinement at each stage in the game.\n\nThinking like a data scientist:\n\nforming a concrete business or research problem\n\ncollecting and analyzing data\n\nbuilding a model\n\nunderstanding the feedback after model deployment\n\nLearning how to work with data:\n\ndetermining the data requirements\n\ncollecting the appropriate data\n\nunderstanding the data\n\npreparing the data for modelling\n\nLearning how to derive the answer:\n\nevaluating and deploying the model\n\ngetting feedback on it\n\nusing that feedback constructively so as to improve the model\n\nQuiz\n\nThe final stages of the data science methodology are an iterative cycle between which of the different stages? -- modelling, evaluation, deployment and feedback\n\nFeedback is not required once the model is deployed because the Model Evaluation stage would have assessed the model and made sure that it performed well. -- False\n\nWhat does deploying a model into production represent? -- it represents the beginning of an iterative process that includes feedback, model refinement and redeployment and requires the input of additional groups, such as marketing personnel and business owners\n\nThe data science methodology is a specific strategy that guides processes and activities relating to data science only for text analytics. -- False\n\nA data scientist determines that building a recommender system is the solution for a particular business problem at hand.

Here are some of the advantages of learning SQL for someone interested in data science:\n\nSQL will boost your professional profile as a data scientist\n\nLearning SQL will give you a good understanding of relational databases\n\nIf you work with reporting tools that generate SQL queries for you, it might be useful to write your own SQL statements\n\nWhat is SQL\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used for relational databases and for querying data.\n\nWhat is data\n\nData is a collection of facts in the form of words, numbers or even pictures. Data is one of the most critical assets of any business. Data is important, so it needs to be secure and it needs to be stored and accessed quickly.\n\nWhat is a database\n\nA database is repository of data. It is a program that stores data. A database also provides the functionality of adding, modifying and querying that data. Different kinds of databases store data in different forms. Data stored in tabular form is a relational database.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct about databases?\n\nA database is a repository or logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning.\n\nTypically comes with functionality for adding, modifying and querying data.\n\nSQL or Structured Query Language is commonly used for accessing data in relational databases.\n\nWhat is an RDBMS\n\nRDBMS, or Relational DataBase Management System, is a set of software tools that controls the data: access, organization and storage.\n\nA relational database stores data in a tabular format - i.e. in rows and columns. But not all types of databases use the tabular format.\n\nA Cloud Database is a database service built and accessed through a cloud platform. Benefits are: ease of use / scalability / disaster recovery. Database services are logical abstractions for managing workloads in a database. An instance of the Cloud Database operates as a service that handles all applications requests to work with the data in any of the databases managed by that instance.\n\nQuiz\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct about databases? -- a database is repository of data; there are different types of databases - Relational, Hierarchical, No SQL, etc; a database can be populated with data and be queried\n\nWhich of the following statements about a Database is/are correct? -- a database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning\n\nSelect the correct statement below about database services or database instances: -- database services are logical abstractions for managing workloads in a database; an instance of the Cloud database operates as a service that handles all application requests to work with the data in any of the databases managed by that instance; the database service instance is the target of the connection requests from applications\n\nThe 5 basic SQL commands are: -- CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\n\nA database stores data in tabular form only. -- False\n\nThere are 5 simple statements:\n\ncreate table\n\ninsert data\n\nselect data\n\nupdate data\n\ndelete data\n\nDDL (Data Definition Language) statements: define / change / drop data\n\nDML (Data Manipulation Language) statements: read / modify data\n\nThe Primary Key in a relational table prevents duplicate rows in that table. -- True (the primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each row in a table)\n\nCREATE TABLE author (author_id CHAR(2) CONSTRAINT AUTHOR_PK PRIMARY KEY (author_id) NOT NULL, lastname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, firstname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(40), city VARCHAR(15), country CHAR(2) ); DROP TABLE author;\n\nThe main purpose of a database management system is not just to store the data but also facilitate retrieval of the data. The SELECT statement is called a query and the output we get from executing this query is called a result set or a result table.\n\nYou can retrieve just the columns you want. The order of the columns displayed always matches the order in the SELECT statement. WHERE clause helps to restrict the result set, which always requires a Predicate: True, False or Unknown. (not equal to <>)\n\nSELECT ID,NAME FROM COUNTRY; SELECT * FROM COUNTRY; SELECT * FROM COUNTRY WHERE CCODE='CA';\n\nCOUNT() is a built-in function that retrieves the number of rows matching the query criteria.\n\nSELECT COUNT(COUNTRY) FROM MEDALS WHERE COUNTRY='CANADA';\n\nDISTINCT is used to remove duplicate values from a result set.\n\nSELECT DISTINCT COUNTRY FROM MEDALS WHERE MEDALTYPE='GOLD';\n\nLIMIT is used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the database.\n\nSELECT * FROM MEDALS WHERE YEAR=2018 LIMIT 5\n\nINSERT statement is used to populate the table with data. A single INSERT statement can be used to insert one or multiple rows in a table.\n\nINSERT INTO AUTHOR (AUTHOR_ID, LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, EMAIL, CITY, COUNTRY) VALUES ('A1', 'CHONG', 'RAUL', 'RFC@IBM.com', 'TORONTO', 'CA'), ('A2', 'ZIHENG', 'ZHANG', 'ZZH@IBM.com', 'SHENZHEN', 'CH')\n\nUPDATE statement is used to alter the data when the table is created and data is inserted into the table.\n\nUPDATE AUTHOR SET LASTNAME = KETTA FIRSTNAME = LAKSHMI WHERE AUTHOR_ID = A2\n\nDELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from the table.\n\nDELETE FROM AUTHOR WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN ('A2','A3')\n\nif no WHERE clause is used, all rows will be removed.\n\nQuiz\n\nThe primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each rwo in a table. -- True\n\nThe INSERT statement cannot be used to insert multiple rows in a single statement. -- False\n\nThe SELECT statement is called a Query, and the output we get from executing the query is called a Result Set. -- True\n\nThe CREATE TABLE statement is a -- DDL statement\n\nWhat are the basic categories of the SQL language based on functionality? -- Data Definition Language and Data Manipulation Language\n\nInformation models and data models are different and serve different purposes. An information model is at the conceptual level and defines relationship between objects. Data models are defined in a more concrete level, are specific and include details. A data model is a blueprint of any database system.\n\nRelational Model\n\nmost used data model\n\nallows for data independence (logical data / physical data / physical storage)\n\ndata is stored in tables\n\nAn entity-relationship data model or ER data model is an alternative to a relational data model.\n\nWhich statement below is correct about the relational model? -- data is organized in tables with entity relationships\n\nThe ER model is used as a tool to design relational databases. In ER models, entities are objects that exist independently of any other entities in the database. Building blocks of ER models are entities and attributes. Entities have attributes, which are the data elements that characterize the entity.\n\nDefining relationships between entities:\n\none-to-one relationship\n\none-to-many relationship\n\nmany-to-many relationship\n\nER Diagrams are basic foundation for designing a database. Begin with ERD, and map the ERD to the table.\n\nWhich of the following statements about Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) is true? -- attributes in an ERD are mapped to columns in a relational table; entities in an ERD are mapped to tables in a relational table\n\nIn a relation: degree = the number of attributes in a relation; cardinality = the number of tuples. Rows in a relational instance (or a table) are also known as Tuples. If a table has 4 columns and 8 rows then its cardinality is 4.\n\nQuiz\n\nCAR DEALERSHIP DATABASE CAR: serial_no, model, manufacturer, price SALE: salesperson_id, serial_no, date, sale_price SALESPERSON: salesperson_id, name, phone\n\nHow many relations does the Car Dealership Schema contain? -- 3\n\nHow many attributes does the relation CAR contain? -- 4\n\nWhat is the degree of the relation Salesperson? -- 3\n\nQuiz\n\nAdvantages of the relational model include: -- it is the most used data model; data is stored in simple data structures such as tables; provides logical and physical data independence\n\nA table containing one or more foreign keys is called a Dependent table. -- True\n\nThe Primary Key of a relational table uniquely identifies each __ in a table. -- row\n\nDatabases and SQL for Data Science -- Week 2\n\nRetrieving rows from a table\n\nSELECT * FROM BOOK; SELECT BOOK_ID, TITLE FROM BOOK; SELECT BOOK_ID, TITLE FROM BOOK WHERE BOOK_ID='B1'\n\nIn a relational database, we can use string patterns to search data rows that match this condition. The LIKE predicate is used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column. We can also use the comparison operators or BETWEEN AND in a WHERE clause (the values in the range are inclusive). We can use IN operator to specify a set of values in a WHERE clause.\n\nSELECT FIRSTNAME FROM AUTHOR WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE 'R%'; SELECT TITLE, PAGES FROM BOOK WHERE PAGE >= 290 AND PAGES <= 300; SELECT TITLE, PAGES FROM BOOK WHERE PAGES BETWEEN 290 AND 300; SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, COUNTRY FROM AUTHOR WHERE COUNTRY='AU' OR COUNTRY='BR'; SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, COUNTRY FROM AUTHOR WHERE COUNTRY IN ('AU', 'BR')\n\nTo display the result set in alphabetical order, we add the ORDER BY clause to the SELECT statement (ascending by default; descending using DESC). In addition, we can specify column sequence number in ORDER BY clause.\n\nSELECT TITLE FROM BOOK ORDER BY TITLE; SELECT TITLE FROM BOOK ORDER BY TITLE DESC; SELECT TITLE, PAGES FROM BOOK ORDER BY 2; (order by pages)\n\nTo eliminate duplicates in the result set, we use the keyword DISTINCT. Besides, the GROUP BY clause groups a result set into subsets that has matching values for one or more columns. We can further restrict the number of rows with HAVING clause in the GROUP BY clause.\n\nSELECT DISTINCT(COUNTRY) FROM AUTHOR; SELECT COUNTRY, COUNT(COUNTRY) FROM AUTHOR GROUP BY COUNTRY; SELECT COUNTRY, COUNT(COUNTRY) AS COUNT FROM AUTHOR GROUP BY COUNTRY; SELECT COUNTRY, COUNT(COUNTRY) AS COUNT FROM AUTHOR GROUP BY COUNTRY HAVING COUNT(COUNTRY) > 4\n\nQuiz\n\nYou want to select author's last name from a table, but you only remember the author's last name starts with the letter B, which string pattern can you use? -- SELECT FIRSTNAME FROM AUTHOR WHERE LASTNAME LIKE 'B%'\n\nIn a SELECT statement, which SQL clause controls how the result set is displayed? -- ORDER BY clause\n\nWhich SELECT statement eliminates duplicates in the result set? -- SELECT DISTINCT(COUNTRY) FROM AUTHOR\n\nWhat is the default sorting mode of the ORDER BY clause? -- ascending\n\nWhich of the following can be used in a SELECT statement to restrict a result set? -- HAVING / WHERE / DISTINCT\n\nMost databases come with built-in SQL functions. Built-in functions can be included as part of SQL statements. Database functions significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved. Built-in functions can speed up data processing.\n\nAggregate or Column Functions\n\nINPUT: collection of values (e.g. entire column)\n\nOUTPUT: single value\n\ne.g. SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG() etc\n\nSELECT SUM(SALESPERSON) FROM PETSALE; SELECT SUM(SALESPERSON) AS SUM_OF_SALESPERSON FROM PETSALE; SELECT MAX(QUANTITY) FROM PETSALE; SELECT MIN(ID) FROM PETSALE WHERE ANIMAL='DOG'; SELECT AVG(SALEPRICE) FROM PETSALE; SELECT AVG(SALEPRICE / QUANTITY) FROM PETSALE WHERE ANIMAL='DOG'\n\nScaler and String Functions\n\nperforms operations on every input values. e.g. ROUND(), LENGTH(), UCASE(), LCASE() etc\n\nSELECT ROUND(SALEPRICE) FROM PETSALE; round up/down every value SELECT LENGTH(ANIMAL) FROM PETSALE; retrieve length of each value SELECT UCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETSALE; SELECT * FROM PETSALE WHERE LCASE(ANIMAL)='cat'; SELECT DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) FROM PETSALE\n\nDate and Time Functions\n\nMost databases contain special data types for dates and times.\n\nDATE YYYYMMDD\n\nTIME HHMMSS\n\nTIMESTAMP YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZZZZZZ\n\nDate / Time functions: YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY(), DAYOFMONTH(), DAYOFWEEK(), DAYOFYEAR(), WEEK(), HOUR(), MINUTE(), SECOND()\n\nSpecial registers: CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME\n\nSELECT DAY(SALEDATE) FROM PETSALE WHERE ANIMAL='CAT'; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PETSALE WHERE MONTH(SALEDATE)='05'; SELECT (SALEDATE + 3 DAYS) FROM PETSALE; SELECT (CURRENT_DATE - SALEDATE) FROM PETSALE)\n\nSub-query is a query inside another query. This allows you to form more powerful queries than would have been otherwise possible.\n\nSELECT COLUMN1 FROM TABLE WHERE COLUMN2 = (SELECT MAX(COLUMN2) FROM TABLE); SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY < (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES); SELECT EMP_ID, SALARY, (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES) AS AVG_SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES; SELECT * FROM (SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID FROM EMPLOYEES) AS EMP4ALL\n\nThere are several ways to access multiple tables in the same query:\n\nsub-queries\n\nimplicit JOIN\n\nJOIN operators (INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, etc)\n\nSELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE DEP_ID IN (SELECT DEPT_ID_DEP FROM DEPARTMENTS); SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE DEP_ID IN (SELECT DEPT_ID_DEP FROM DEPARTMENTS WHERE LOC_ID='L0002'); SELECT DEPT_ID_DEP, DEP_NAME FROM DEPARTMENTS WHERE DEPT_ID_DEP IN (SELECT DEP_ID FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY > 70000); SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS; (full join / Cartesian join / every row in 1st is joined with every row in 2nd) SELECT * FORM EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS WHERE EMPLOYEES.DEP_ID=DEPARTMENTS.DEPT_ID_DEP; SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES E, DEPARTMENTS D WHERE E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP; SELECT EMPLOYEES.EMP_ID, DEPARTMENTS.DEPT_NAME FROM EMPLOYEES E, DEPARTMENTS D WHERE E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP; SELECT E.EMP_ID, D.DEP_ID_DEP FROM EMPLOYEES E, DEPARTMENTS D WHERE E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP\n\nQuiz\n\nWhich of the following will retrieve the LOWEST value of SALARY in a table called EMPLOYEES? -- SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES\n\nAssume there exists an INSTRUCTOR table with several columns including FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, etc. Which of the following is the most likely result set for the following query? SELECT DISTINCT(FIRSTNAME) FROM INSTRUCTOR -- LEON / PAUL / JOE\n\nWhich of the following queries will return the first name of the employee who earns the highest salary? -- SELECT FIRST_NAME FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES)\n\nWhich of the following queries will return the data for employees who belong to the department with the highest value of department ID? -- SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE DEP_ID=(SELECT MAX(DEPT_ID_DEP) FROM DEPARTMENTS)\n\nA DEPARTMENTS table contains DEP_NAME, and DEPT_ID_DEP columns and an EMPLOYEES table contains columns called F_NAME and DEP_ID. We want to retrieve the Department Name for each Employee. Which of the following queries will correctly accomplish this? -- SELECT D.DEP_NAME, E.F_NAME FROM DEPARTMENTS D, EMPLOYEES E WHERE D.DEPT_ID_DEP=E.DEP_ID\n\nA Foreign Key is a set of columns referring to a primary key of another table. It is the Primary Key which uniquely identifies a row in a table.\n\nParent Table: a table containing a Primary Key that is related to at least one Foreign Key\n\nDependent Table: a table containing one or more Foreign Keys\n\nThe following six constraints are defined in a relational database model:\n\nentity integrity constraint\n\nreferential integrity constraint\n\nsemantic integrity constraint\n\ndomain constraint\n\nnull constraint\n\ncheck constraint\n\nIf a Primary Key was allowed to have NULL values the Entity Integrity Constraint of a table could be violated. The Referential Integrity ensures the validity of the data using a combination of Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.\n\nQuiz\n\nWhich Relational Constraint prevents duplicate rows in a table? -- Entity Integrity Constraint\n\nWhich Relational Constraint ensures the validity of the data using a combination of Primary Keys and Foreign Keys? -- Referential Integrity Constraint\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct about the primary keys? -- the value of the Primary Key must be unique for each instance of the entity; the Primary Key is immutable, i.e., once created the value of the Primary Key cannot be changed; Primary Keys cannot have missing or NULL values\n\nWhich of the following statement is true? -- a Foreign Key refers to a Primary Key of another table\n\nDatabases and SQL for Data Science -- Week 3\n\nThere are many benefits of Python for database programming:\n\necosystem: NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, SciPy\n\nease of use\n\nportable\n\ndatabase APIs\n\nsupport for relational database systems\n\ndetailed documentation\n\nNotebooks are very popular in the field of data science because they run in an environment that allows creation and sharing of documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory texts. A notebook interface is a virtual notebook environment used for programming.\n\nSQL API consists of a library of function calls as an application programming interface (API) for the DBMS.\n\nTwo concepts of the Python DB API:\n\nconnection objects\n\ndatabase connections\n\nmanage transaction\n\ncursor objects\n\ndatabase queries\n\nCursors created from the same connection are not isolated, i.e. any changes done to the database by a cursor are immediately visible to the other cursors. Cursors created from different connections can or cannot be isolated depending on how the transaction support is implemented.\n\nA database cursor is a control structure that enables traversal over the records in a database. It behaves like a file name or file handle in a programming language.\n\nfrom dbmodule import connect # create connection object Connection = connection('databasename', 'username', 'pswd') # create a cursor object Cursor = Connection.cursor() # run queries Cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM MYTABLE') Results = Cursor.fetchall() # free resources Cursor.close() Connection.close()\n\nThe ibm_db API provides a variety of useful Python functions for accessing and manipulating data in an IBM data server Database.\n\nThe ibm_db.exec_immediate() function prepares and executes a SQL statement.

Which of the following is NOT required to establish a connection with a relational database from a Python network. -- table and column names\n\nA simple SELECT statement retrieves data from one or more columns from a single table. The next level of complexity is retrieving data from two or more tables. To combine data from two tables, we use JOIN operator: 1) combines row from two or more tables; 2) based on a relationship.\n\nPrimaryKey-ForeignKey is the common JOIN operator\n\nJOIN operator is used to combine more than one table\n\nYou have to know the relationship between the tables\n\nINNER JOIN\n\nmost popular\n\nAn INNER JOIN operation returns only data from the rows in the tables that match the inner join criteria.\n\nSELECT B.BORROWER_ID, B.LASTNAME, B.COUNTRY, L.BORROWER_ID, L.LOAN_DATE FROM BORROWER B INNER JOIN LOAN L ON B.BORROWER_ID=L.BORROWER_ID SELECT B.LASTNAME, L.COPY_ID, C.STATUS FROM BORROWER B INNER JOIN LOAN L ON B.BORROWER_ID=L.BORROWER_ID INNER JOIN COPY C ON L.COPY_ID=C.COPY_ID\n\nLEFT OUTER JOIN\n\nA LEFT (OUTER) JOIN operation matches the results from two tables and displays all the rows from the left table, and combines the information with rows from the right table that matches the criteria specified in the query.\n\nSELECT B.BORROWER_ID, B.LASTNAME, B.COUNTRY, L.BORROWER_ID, L.LOAN_DATE FROM BORROWER B LEFT JOIN LOAN L ON B.BORROWER_ID=L.BORROWER_ID\n\nWhen using a LEFT JOIN, if the right table does not have a corresponding value, a NULL value was returned.\n\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN\n\nA RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN operation matches the results from two tables and displays all the rows from the right table, and combines the information with rows from the left table that matches the criteria specified in the query.\n\nSELECT B.BORROWER_ID, B.LASTNAME, B.COUNTRY, L.BORROWER_ID, L.LOAN_DATE FROM BORROWER B RIGHT JOIN LOAN L ON B.BORROWER_ID=L.BORROWER_ID\n\nIf you do not specify what type of OUTER JOIN you want to perform, it defaults to RIGHT OUTER JOIN. -- False (you need to specify which type of OUTER JOIN you want to perform - LEFT, RIGHT OR FULL)\n\nFULL OUTER JOIN\n\nThe FULL (OUTER) JOIN operation returns all rows from both tables, all rows from the left table and all rows from the right table. So, the FULL JOIN could return a very large result set.\n\nSELECT B.BORROWER_ID, B.LASTNAME, B.COUNTRY, L.BORROWER_ID, L.LOAN_DATE FROM BORROWER B FULL JOIN LOAN L ON B.BORROWER_ID=L.BORROWER_ID\n\nQuiz\n\nAn INNER JOIN returns only the rows that match. -- True\n\nA LEFT OUTER JOIN displays all the rows from the right table, and combines matching rows from the left table. -- False\n\nWhen using an OUTER JOIN, you must explicitly state what kind of OUTER JOIN you want - a LEFT JOIN, a RIGHT JOIN, or a FULL JOIN. -- True\n\nWhich of the following are valid types of JOINs? -- LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN\n\nA FULL JOIN returns only the rows that match. -- False\n\nDatabases and SQL for Data Science -- Week 4\n\nMany of the real-world datasets are made available as .csv files.
