        "text": "Sometimes it is requisite to determine distinct groups of points on a map which are closest to each other. To automatize this process, Cluster Points allows you to find a predefined number of groups with mutually close points.\n\nDifferent cluster algorithms are provided in this comprehensive GIS implementation. The user may choose from the K-Means or Fuzzy C-Means algorithms, hierarchical clustering with SLINK or hierarchical clustering with the Lance-Williams distance updates together with a cluster feature preprocessing (similar to BIRCH). All versions output an explicit cluster ID for individual points. The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm additionally outputs cluster membership probabilities for individual points.\n\nThe user is offered the option to prescribe multiple numericals fields which can be incorporated into the spatial clustering by a prescribed percentage. Depending on this percentage, the clustering is rather location-based or attribute-based.\n\nThis plugin was started during the project phase of a GIS-Analyst training course in Berlin (https://gis-trainer.de)."
