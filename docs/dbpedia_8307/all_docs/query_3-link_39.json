        "text": "Google Cloud projects form the basis for creating, enabling, and using all Google Cloud services including managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions for Google Cloud resources.\n\nThis page explains how to create and manage Google Cloud projects using the Cloud Resource Manager API and the Google Cloud console.\n\nBefore you begin\n\nRead about the project resource in the Resource hierarchy overview. For guidance on setting up your resource hierarchy, see Decide a resource hierarchy for your Google Cloud landing zone.\n\nThe following are used to identify your project:\n\nProject name: A human-readable name for your project.\n\nThe project name isn't used by any Google APIs. You can edit the project name at any time during or after project creation. Project names do not need to be unique.\n\nProject ID: A globally unique identifier for your project.\n\nA project ID is a unique string used to differentiate your project from all others in Google Cloud. After you enter a project name, the Google Cloud console generates a unique project ID that can be a combination of letters, numbers, and hyphens. We recommend you use the generated project ID, but you can edit it during project creation. After the project has been created, the project ID is permanent.\n\nA project ID has the following requirements:\n\nMust be 6 to 30 characters in length.\n\nCan only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.\n\nMust start with a letter.\n\nCannot end with a hyphen.\n\nCannot be in use or previously used; this includes deleted projects.\n\nCannot contain restricted strings, such as google, null, undefined, and ssl.\n\nProject number: An automatically generated unique identifier for your project.\n\nDon't include sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or security data in your project name, project ID, or other resource names. The project ID is used in the name of many other Google Cloud resources, and any reference to the project or related resources exposes the project ID and resource name.\n\nCreating a project\n\nTo create a project, you must have the resourcemanager.projects.create permission. This permission is included in roles like the Project Creator role (roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator). The Project Creator role is granted by default to the entire domain of a new organization resource and to free trial users. For information on how to grant individuals the role and limit organization-resource wide access, see the Managing Default Organization Roles page.\n\nIf you don't specify the parent resource, a parent resource is selected automatically if applicable based on the user account's domain.\n\nYou can create a new project using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or the projects.create() method.\n\nTags provide a way to create annotations for resources. You can add tags at the time of creating projects. You must assign the Tag User role while adding tags. For more information on the permissions assigned to this role, see Manage tags on resources. You can only add the namespace for the tag key-value pairs in one of the following ways:\n\nCreating a project using a service account\n\nYou can use a service account to automate project creation. Like user accounts, service accounts can be granted permission to create projects within an organization resource. Service accounts are not allowed to create projects outside of an organization resource and must specify the parent resource when creating a project. Service accounts can create a new project using the gcloud CLI or the projects.create() method.\n\nManaging project quotas\n\nIf you have fewer than 30 projects remaining in your quota, a notification displays the number of projects remaining in your quota on the New Project page. Once you have reached your project limit, to create more projects you must request a project limit increase. Alternatively, you can schedule some projects to be deleted after 30 days on the Manage Resources Page. Projects that users have soft deleted count against your quota. These projects fully delete after 30 days.\n\nTo request additional capacity for projects in your quota, use the Request Project Quota Increase form. More information about quotas and why they are used can be found at the Free Trial Project Quota Requests support page. For more information about billing reports, see the Billing Reports support page.\n\nIdentifying projects\n\nTo interact with Google Cloud resources, you must provide the identifying project information for every request. A project is identified by its project ID and project number.\n\nTo get the project ID and the project number, do the following:\n\nGo to the Dashboard page in the Google Cloud console.\n\nGo to the Dashboard page\n\nClick the Select from drop-down list at the top of the page. In the Select from window that appears, select your project.\n\nThe project ID and project number are displayed on the project Dashboard Project info card:\n\nIn the above example, the project name is My Sample Project and the project ID is my-sample-project-191923.\n\nGet an existing project\n\nYou can get an existing project using the Google Cloud console or the projects.get() method.\n\nIf you are not a project owner, you must have the permissions included in the Browser role (roles/browser).\n\nListing projects\n\nList all projects under a resource\n\nTo list all projects that are direct children of a resource, use the v3 projects.list method, with the parent resource specified in the query:\n\nRequest:\n\nGET https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/projects { \"parent\": \"folders/662951040570\" }\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"projects\": [ { \"name\": \"projects/951040570662\", \"parent\": \"folders/662951040570\", \"projectId\": \"tokyo-rain-123\", \"state\": \"ACTIVE\", \"displayName\": \"Tokyo Rain\" \"createTime\": \"2013-11-13T20:31:53.308Z\" \"updateTime\": \"2013-11-13T20:31:53.308Z\" \"etag\": \"BwWUlZ6XEfY=\" } ] }\n\nSearch for projects\n\nTo search for projects matching the specified query, use gcloud alpha resource-manager projects search, passing the query in the --query flag. The scope of search is all the projects for which the user has projects.get permission.\n\nIf you specify the parent.type and parent.id fields in your request body, then the resourcemanager.projects.list permission is checked on the parent. If the user has this permission, all projects under the parent are returned after the remaining filters have been applied.\n\nIf the user lacks this permission, then all projects for which the user has the resourcemanager.projects.get permission are returned after remaining filters have been applied.\n\nIf no filter is specified, the call returns projects for which the user has resourcemanager.projects.get permissions.\n\nUpdating projects\n\nYou can update projects using the Google Cloud console or the projects.patch() method.\n\nThe only fields that can be updated are the project name and labels. For more information about updating projects, see the project API reference page.\n\nTo move a project within your resource hierarchy, see Moving a project. To migrate a project from one organization resource to another, see Migrating projects.\n\nShutting down (deleting) projects\n\nYou can shut down projects using the Google Cloud console or the projects.delete method in the API. A project must have a lifecycle state of ACTIVE to be shut down in this way.\n\nThis method immediately marks a project to be deleted. A notification email is sent to the user who initiated the delete operation and the Technical category contacts that are listed in Essential Contacts on a best effort basis; if the notification fails to send, the project is still marked to be deleted. If there's no contact in the Technical category, the fallback contact isn't notified.\n\nA project that is marked for deletion isn't usable. If the project has a billing account associated with it, that association is broken and isn't reinstated if the project delete operation is canceled. After 30 days, the project is fully deleted. Until it is fully deleted, the project might still be visible, although it isn't usable.\n\nTo stop the project delete process during the 30-day period, see the steps to restore a project.\n\nAt the end of the 30-day period, the project and all of its resources are deleted and cannot be recovered. Until it is deleted, the project counts towards your project quota.\n\nTo help ensure that you don't delete any important projects, you can enable change risk recommendations. Change risk recommendations generate warnings when you try to delete projects that Google Cloud has identified as important.\n\nIf you have set up billing for a project, it might not be completely deleted until the current billing cycle ends and your account is successfully charged. The number and types of services in use can also affect when the system permanently deletes a project. To learn more about data retention and safe deletion, see How Google retains data we collect.\n\nTo shut down a project:\n\nTroubleshooting project deletion\n\nIf the process to shut down a project fails, you can find more information at Troubleshooting project deletion.\n\nRestoring a project\n\nProject owners can restore a deleted project within the 30-day recovery period that starts when the project is shut down. Restoring a project returns it to the state it was in before it was shut down, with certain exceptions:\n\nBilling is disabled on the project when the project is shut down and billing is not automatically enabled on restored projects. The Cloud Billing account must be manually linked again after the project is restored. You might need to wait a few hours before you can successfully link a recently restored project to a billing account.\n\nYou can recover most resources if you restore a project within the 30-day period. Some services have delays in restoring and you might need to wait some time for services to be restored.\n\nSome resources, such as Cloud Storage or Pub/Sub resources, are deleted much sooner. These resources might not be fully recoverable even if you restore the project within the 30-day period.\n\nSome services might need to be restarted manually. For more information, see Restarting Google Cloud Services."
