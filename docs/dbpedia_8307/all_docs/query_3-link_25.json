        "text": "My laboratory produces large amounts of data from RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and genome resequencing experiments. Orange allows me to analyze my data even though I donâ€™t know how to program. It also allows me to communicate with my collaborators, who are experts in data mining, and with my colleagues and trainees.\n\nGad Shaulsky, Ph.D.\n\nMolecular biologist and Director of Graduate Studies ( Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA )\n\nThe scientific community is in need of tools that allow easy construction of workflows and visualizations and are capable of analyzing large amounts of data. Orange is a powerful platform to perform data analysis and visualization, see data flow and become more productive. It provides a clean, open source platform and the possibility to add further functionality for all fields of science.\n\nFerenc Borondics, Ph.D.\n\nPrincipal beamline scientist at SMIS ( SOLEIL synchrotron, France )\n\nI teach Orange workshops monthly to a diverse audience, from undergrad students to expert researchers. Orange is very intuitive, and, by the end of the workshop, the participants are able to perform complex data visualization and basic machine learning analyses. Most of our attendees have been able to incorporate this tool in their research practice.\n\nFrancesca Vitali, Ph.D.\n\nResearch Assistant Professor ( Center for Biomedical Informatics & Biostatistics, The University of Arizona )"
