        "text": "Over time, Python has emerged as one of the most suitable languages for building Data Science solutions. It is a high-level programming language that is easy to understand and hosts popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc., that are much needed for implementing Data Science projects. In this blog, we will explore Python projects for data science to deeply understand why Python is becoming the popular choice for designing Data Science solutions.\n\nWhy Practice Python for Data Science Project Ideas?\n\nPython has come to command a celebrity status in data science over the years. It is loved by all data enthusiasts and provides an easy introduction to data science and machine learning. It’s easy to write and offers plenty of built-in libraries for complicated data science tasks. Python also owes its place among the favourites to easy code readability. Its syntax is skeletal and minimal when juxtaposed with other heavy-weight languages. Following is a non-exhaustive list of libraries available to use in Python for Data Science - seaborn, matplotlib, sci-kit learn, NumPy, SciPy, requests, pandas, regex etc. Aptly so, Python is a fine choice for beginners to get started learning data science. The best way to learn any technology or a programming language is to learn by doing. Here is a curated list of data science Python projects to help you get started on your learning journey and gain the hands-on experience needed for a data science job.\n\nTop 20 Python Data Science Projects\n\nWithout much ado, it’s time for you to get your hands dirty with Python Projects for Data Science and explore various ways of approaching a business problem for data-driven insights.\n\nData Science Projects for Beginners using Python\n\nLet us quickly dive into the list of beginner-friendly data science projects in Python.\n\n1) Music Recommendation System on KKBox Dataset Python Project for Data Science\n\nMusic in today’s time is all around us. With over 70 million songs on Spotify alone as of 2021, it’s safe to say music is easily accessible. And there are other services as well like Apple Music, Gaana, Saavn, KKBox. In an industry where there is already so much content, how does new content get discovered? It is through the Recommendations system that people find new songs and acquire new musical tastes. Music streaming services profit from recommendation algorithms as well. It helps them grow their audience and increase engagement on their platform.\n\nKKBox is among Asia’s largest Streaming Services platforms.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset contains the metadata for users and songs. Metadata includes user-specific and song-specific data, like user_ID, user_Registration_date, song_ID, song_genre, song_ArtistName, song_releaseDate etc. The dataset contains the time when a song is played for the first time by a user. This information is unique for each song-user pair.\n\nThere are three files in the dataset :\n\nTrain.csv - It stores user-song pair related data like use_id, source_system_tab, source_type, source_screentime, target.\n\nTarget defines if the user listened to the same track within the bracket of one month.\n\nTarget = 1 means the user repeated the song in 30 days\n\nTarget = 0 means the user did not repeat the song\n\nSongs.csv - It contains data on songs like song_id, song_genre, song_artist, song_lyricist, etc.\n\nmembers .csv - It contains user account data like user_name, user_age, user_gender, user_subscription_plan, etc\n\nData Cleaning\n\nThe dataset can have anomalies, outliers and missing values. Such cases can interfere with the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithmic implementations. We need to normalise the data and make it uniform throughout. On average, about 20-40% of values in a dataset are outliers or missing.\n\nWe use the following techniques to clean the data\n\n1. Outlier Detection and Treatment\n\nOutliers are absurd values that don’t fall under the permissible range for a label. For Example, a user’s age below 0 and above 100 can be considered absurd. It could be more stringent for some cases, like for purchasing liquor - between 18 and 100.\n\n2. Imputing Missing Values\n\nImputing is replacing the missing values in the dataset with another value.\n\nWe categorise user-song pairs under two prominent labels, i.e. repeat and non-repeats.\n\nReplacing missing values with appropriate data - The missing values in the dataset are replaced with either the mode or the median of the values.\n\nRemoving all null values - This case removes all the data points with missing data, resulting in data loss. After this procedure, the dataset file effectively reduces in size.\n\nMaking a new label as Missing - A new category called ‘missing’ is created for data points that have some value missing. It segregates missing resources under one single group.\n\nAnd lastly, convert string labels into numerical counterparts.\n\nLibraries\n\npandas, sklearn, NumPy\n\nThis project will evaluate the following four modelling approaches to build a music recommender system -\n\nLogistic regression\n\nLogistic regression is the simplest of all the algorithms. It resides in python as a linear model in the sklearn library.\n\nDecision Tree\n\nThe decision tree makes use of the tree structure to reach conclusions or results. At each level, there is a choice to follow either of the branches. Upon all the iterations, the tree outputs the result.\n\nRandom Forest\n\nA Random Forest is a collection of Decision Trees.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Music Recommender System using KKBox\n\n2) Natural Language Processing ChatBot with NLTK for Text Classification\n\nChatbots are programs that can chat with users about common problems and reply with adequate information. Many organisations use these chatbot data science python projects as the first point of interaction with their customers.\n\nNLP Techniques Implemented in this Python NLP Project\n\nTokenization\n\nWe break the sentences into their basic constituent words called tokens. The punctuation marks are labelled as separate tokens. Tokens help in processing large chunks of text efficiently by splitting the tet into smaller parts.\n\nFor example, the sentence - ‘Data Science projects are so fun. When can I be a Data Scientist?’ will form these tokens.\n\nTokens = [ ‘ Data ’, ‘ Science ’, ‘ projects ’, ‘ are ’, ‘ so ’, ‘ fun ’, ‘ . ‘ , ‘ when ’, ‘ can ’, ‘ I ’ , ‘ be ’ , ‘ a ‘, ‘ data ’, ‘ scientist ’, ‘ ? ’ ]\n\nStopwords\n\nWords that don't add to the meaning of the sentence are stopwords. They make the token-dataset redundant and don't add to the efficacy of the algorithm.\n\nE.g. ‘Why are we even doing all this has the following stopwords\n\nStopwords - [‘ even ’,’ all ’]\n\nTagging\n\nTagging associates tokens with some meaning. Tokens are tagged based on grammar; for example, nouns, adjectives, adverbs are acceptable for the project.\n\nNamed-entity recognition is another type of tagging where names of things, places, objects, people are Tags.\n\nLemmatisation\n\nIt groups different variations of a word into a single parent word. It ensures that various forms of the exact words get tagged under the same token. Lemmatisation reduces redundancy and makes the text set unique.\n\nE.g. feet and foot are the same in context, so they are grouped under the word foot.\n\nStemming\n\nStemming, just like Lemmatisation, replaces different forms of a word with its root form. Thus, reducing confusion and duplication. For example, words written in past tense or plural form can be replaced with the root world instead - Go can substitute went, goes, going, gone. People have their way of speaking. There may be many different sentences that could entail the same meaning. We essentially want the algorithm to treat these sentences as the same, and hence we use stemming and lemmatisation.\n\nFinal Data Set format\n\nThe chat data needs to adhere to a particular format before feeding to the classifier. The format for this project is - ( ‘input text’, ‘meaning behind the text - category’, ‘response from chatbox’ ). This process is called feature extraction.\n\nAlgorithms Implemented\n\nDecison Tree Classifier\n\nDecision Tree Classifier works by creating a tree where each node is a feature name, and each branch defines the feature value. The leaves of the tree are classification labels.\n\nNaive Bayers Classifier\n\nIt is a simpler algorithm that sets a basic baseline accuracy model. Naive Bayers Classifier provides comparatively less accuracy in the particular project.\n\nHyper Parameter Tuning\n\nEntropy cutoff - This parameter refines the tree based on the training dataset. Tree Refinement is the process where the tree decides to create new branches, thus making new decisions.\n\nSupport cutoff - It is the number of label feature sets that are required to refine the tree. Support cutoff value defines the least number of instances required in the tree’s training data to complete the refining process.\n\nFine-tuning hyperparameters achieves the best prediction from the algorithm. With the algorithm set up and tuned correctly, we proceed with data prediction.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Natural Language Processing ChatBot with NLTK\n\n3) Ola Bike Ride Request Demand Forecast Project on Data Science using Python\n\nIt is challenging to service ride requests because of their unpredictability and spontaneity. For this very reason, it is vital to have a prediction algorithm in place that can forecast the approximate number of rides in the near future. This project aims to predict the ride-request demands for a particular area for a given duration of time. The area is recognised by latitude and longitude values and duration measures in military hours.\n\nDataset Description\n\nData is made available from Ola’s repository. It contains fields like user_ID, request_latitude, request_longitutude, request_Time, pickup location and drop locations. We make some assumptions to simplify the data set, as follows.\n\nIf there a multiple ride requests from an area ( unique latitude-longitude) in an hour, it is simplified as one request only.\n\nSubsequent ride requests under 8mins after the first request will get ignored, regardless of the area of origin for the requests.\n\nDistances under 50 meters under pickup and drop locations are assumed as fraud and hence ignored.\n\nData Clustering\n\nThe original data format in latitude and longitude is quite large and distinct for the algorithm to work effectively. So, we group all pairs of latitude and longitude that fall under a specific area into one cluster. K-means clustering algorithm is responsible for the area selection and clustering of data. We specifically use the mini-batch K-means algorithm to form clusters of data. After the mini-batch k-means algorithm runs, we have data as follows.\n\n(latitude, longitude ) -> cluster number\n\nEvaluating Various Algorithmic Approaches\n\nLinear Regression\n\nLinear regression usually underfit the data and is an appropriate dataset that shows inherent linearity. Since the data in this project doesn’t follow any linear relationship, it would not be ideal to use linear regression. Linear Regression helps set the baseline for the subsequent algorithms.\n\nRandom Forest Regressor\n\nOverfits the data. It tends to perform well on training data set as compared to test data set.\n\nSequential Learner algorithm - Extreme Gradient Boost\n\nXgBoost is an optimised gradient boost algorithm based on decision trees. It focuses on speed and performance with parallelization and cache optimization as its features.\n\nSource code with Guided Videos - Ola Bike Ride Request Demand Forecast\n\n4) E-Commerce Product Reviews - Pairwise Ranking and Sentiment Analysis\n\nDataSet\n\nData for the project is formatted in users, review, helpful and not-helpful reviews.\n\nData Processing\n\nLanguage detection - This detects the language of the written review. It also removes languages that are not our chosen language for sentiment analysis. For example, it eliminates native languages like Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi for an English language sentiment analysis engine.\n\nGibberish Review Removal - These include reviews that are not useful for our engine. These can be emojis or reviews unrelated to the product etc.\n\nProfanity Filters - This part removes profanity and curses from the review dataset.\n\nCorrect poorly written reviews - This helps make the review grammatically correct and logical, thus creating uniformity in grammar for all text.\n\nFeature Extraction\n\nNoun Strength\n\nReview Polarity\n\nReview Subjectivity - This qualifies the reviews as more objective or subjective on a scale of 0 to 1\n\nReview complexity\n\nReview Word length - Single worded reviews aren’t informative in general. That’s why word length is a significant feature factor.\n\nService Tagger - Some reviews, instead of describing the product experience, blame the service provider. These reviews would not help us since they dont convey product-specific sentiments.\n\nCompound Score (RSC) - This deciphers the tonality of the review depending on the emoticons and capitalisation of words. For example, In the review ‘The hand wash was GREAT!!!’, ‘great’ is emphasised with block letters and exclamations. It makes the review more informative.\n\nPair-wise classification of each review is done against every other review to label them as helpful and not helpful. For a total of n-reviews, there will be n-squared classifications. The classification uses the following models.\n\nThe linear model uses the logistic regressor to achieve an accuracy of 85 per cent.\n\nThe non-linear model uses a Decision Tree classifier, reaching an accuracy of 70 per cent.\n\nThe ensemble model uses a Random Forest Classifier, which is a bunch of decision trees put together.\n\nSource code with Guided Videos - E-Commerce Product Reviews\n\n5) Abstractive Text Summarization using Transformer-BART Model\n\nSummarisation is crucial in many areas and finds plenty of use cases in everyday life. We are always onto the summary before the book, product, course, or looking for a college. Some professional experts write summaries but not every time we need expert summaries for our products. The use of Text Summarisation Python Data projects produces good quality jists in an automated fashion. It also takes less time.\n\nFollowing are the two ways to summarise texts:\n\nExtractive Summarisation constructs an intermediate representation of the text with low-level information. We score the sentences based on representation. And finally, we select the few sentences with the top score.\n\nAbstractive Summarization is further divided into Syntactical summarisation and Semantic summarisation.\n\nSyntactical summarisation looks at the relationship between entities in the text.\n\nSemantic summarisation defines the graphical relations based on the meaning of the entities in the text.\n\nBART or Bi-directional Autoregressive Transformer is a denoising autoencoder that corrupts the training text and adds noise for training the model. It then learns the model to construct the original text from the noise-embedded sequence.\n\nDataSet - Cleanup and Formatting\n\nThe data set is the collection of 40,000 summaries of news articles and the corresponding original articles.\n\nLibraries- Pandas, PyTorch, sklearn, transformers\n\nImplementation\n\nBART is a denoising autoencoder that trains sequence to sequence models. It uses various noising approaches like randomly shuffling the order of sentences in the text or replacing part of sentences with specific tokens.\n\nSource code with Guided Videos - Abstractive Text Summarization\n\nIntermediate Data Science Python Projects\n\nBelow are a few examples of data science projects using python and data analysis projects in Python that are slightly challenging than the ones mentioned in the previous section.\n\n6) Building a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System\n\nRecommending the right products to customers can be instrumental for companies sales and engagement. Recommendations work with the rating of the product and the type of product that the customers had purchased. Collaborative Filtering uses distance proximity using nearest neighbours and cosine distances. Prime factors like customer interaction and feedback are essential in collaborative filtering.\n\nCosine similarity - Distance Metric\n\nCosine similarity depends on finding the group of users similar to the user who need recommendations. The similarity between two users is the distance between them in the rating matrix. The closer two users are, the more likely they will enjoy the same movies.\n\nDataset Description and Pre-Processing\n\nNormalisation\n\nLabel encoding converts products Id to numerical values. Thus, making it possible to plot the products mathematically. Normalised ratings are average subtracted from the actual ratings.\n\nFiltering Process\n\nProducts with lower ratings get dropped, so the data left is robust and can be faster. The larger the pool of ratings, the better the model can train.\n\nUser-Item Matrix\n\nIt’s a matrix with users in the columns and products in the rows, where the intersection defines the rating given by the user for the product. Missing value in the matrix is replaced by zero.\n\nLibraries - Numpy, operator, sklearn,\n\nCosine similarity helps in finding the k-top similar users. After recognising the k similar users, we aggregate the movies liked by each user into one group. We can start recommending those movies from this group to the user who hasn’t seen them yet. An important point to note is creating similarity matrices using the user-item matrices.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Building a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System\n\n7) Resume Parsing in Machine Learning with Python OCR and Spacy\n\nRecruiters and companies get thousands of resumes every month in their inboxes from job applicants. It is pretty challenging and taxing to sift through these many job applications for a person. The process soon becomes and monotonous and numbing. Resume Parsing is one of the popular data science projects with python helps in collating the pivotal information in the resumes into cardinal categories/labels. These labels are the vital points that make up the gist of the resume. These labels can be name, designation, school, college, work experience etc. A resume parser converts these processes resumes into a format that contains only the crucial information. Thus, making the recruiter’s work more manageable and less tiring.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset format is in JSON as (label, entity start tag, entity end tag, actual text )\n\nLabels, as discussed earlier, are the categories in the resume that form the crux. Like, name, designation, city, experience, skills etc. The dataset needs to go through processing before the modelling. Processing makes sure the data is formatted in the correct way for implementation in Spacy NER.\n\nSpacy Natural Entity Recognition is a framework written in python that correlates text and its semantics. It is an advanced natural language processing algorithm that uses the generative positional parsing technique. The technique works by word-embedding that pulls out the relation between semantics and syntax of a word.\n\nFor example, ‘ my experience in Cambridge was not pleasant. NER would recognise that Cambridge means a college or school after going through hundreds of resumes with the same content or meanings.\n\nOptical Character Recognition reads and converts texts from images. Optical character recognition reads the resumes and converts them into pdf or text as inputs to the model.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Resume Parsing with Machine Learning\n\n8) Face Recognition System in Python using FaceNet\n\nFace recognition identifies the person or an object given an image or a video. It falls under the computer vision category of artificial intelligence. Many cellphones nowadays come with a face recognition unlock feature because of the popularity of such data science projects with python. Its uses are widespread in security and surveillance. Face recognition also finds use in tagging people on their photos and recognising plant species or obscure objects. Its benefits are multidisciplinary.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe data set contains faces of people extracted either from videos or propriety camera repository. Face obtained this way can vary in size and quality. So all the images are processed to fit a particular size ratio and have uniform quality.\n\nOnce we have the normalised image dataset ready, we can begin with the implementation of the Face Recognition model.\n\nWe start by processing pixels in each photo to extract meaningful relations and eights for our model.\n\nThe machine learning algorithm is applied depending on the requirements and conditions.\n\nExtract faces from photos to form a HAAR cascade for face extraction\n\nModel training identifies and labels faces extracted in the previous step.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos- Face Recognition System is Python using FaceNet\n\n9) Hotel Recommendation Project on Data Science using Python\n\nChoosing vacation destinations is hard and choosing a hotel is a bigger hassle. With so many tours and hotel operators over the internet, it might get overwhelming. Hotel recommendation comes into the picture—providing personal hotel recommendations based on the user’s choice and needs.\n\nDataset Description\n\nData for this data science python project comprises a user search and booking history, hotel cluster details, hotel details and user details.\n\nUser details include a user name, user age, user location, user booking history.\n\nUser search history is all the searches that the user undertook in the past to find hotels.\n\nHotel Details include hotel name, hotel location, hotel pricing and hotel rating.\n\nHotel Cluster is a group of hotels that have matching characteristics like pricing, hotel rating. Clustering is vital since it reduces the expected output and increases efficiency in the learning phase of the algorithm.\n\nExpedia Hotel Recommender System Python Project Dataset.\n\nAs the endpoints are discrete, we use classification algorithms to predict hotel clusters for a given user. In this project, you can implement multiple classification algorithms to find the best one suited for the dataset.\n\nRandom forest classifier\n\nGaussian Naive Bayes classification\n\nLogistic regression\n\nKNN classification\n\nXGBoost classification\n\nDecision tree classification\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Hotel Recommendation project in Python\n\n10) Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN for MNIST Dataset\n\nThis project aims to correctly identify handwritten digits and be able to archive them digitally in one place. Before the advent of computers, no more than 25 years ago, organisations relied on paper for archiving events and details. The data stays stored in these paper documents now, even as they disintegrate slowly. It is crucial to store these old records in a digital copy to reference them in the future if the need arises. Allocating human resources on such a task seems redundant when it can be automated and is double through Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nData Set\n\nMNSIT or Modified National Institue of Standard and Technology dataset is quite popular for handwritten digit recognition models. It stores over 60,000 images of handwritten digits, with each image 28x28 pixels in size.\n\nData Processing\n\nShaping data\n\nShaping data refers to changing the 3-dimension vector to a 4-dimension vector since the model takes 4d vectors as input.\n\nOne hot encoding\n\nIt means labelling images with numerical so that they can be processed efficiently in the model. Manipulating numbers is relatively easier than manipulating images.\n\nFeature scaling\n\nImages are scaled down to 0-1 from 0-255 pixels range so that a standard scale is available for all images.\n\nLibraries/Packages - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, sci-kit learn, seaborn.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN\n\nAdvance Projects on Data Science with Python\n\nThese advanced data science projects in Python are a must-try if you consider yourself a pro in the field.\n\n11) Building a Similar Image Finder Data Science Project in Python with Keras and TensorFlow\n\nThe project aims to build a model that takes an image as input and provides images similar to the original image given by the user. Recommending similar products based on product images is used in online retail sites like Amazon, Flipkart, etc. It helps users to make an educated choice by displaying more recommendations through the technique.\n\nDataset Description\n\nDataset has three columns\n\nUrl - public URL for the images\n\nId - unique id for each image\n\nClass - Images are labelled with classes depending on their category or nature.\n\nIndexing uses Elastic search, where features extraction using the weights of ImageNet from MobileNetV2.\n\nK nearest neighbour algorithm helps to find images that are most similar to the input images. Finding k-nearest vectors in the cluster map accomplishes this for an image.\n\nLibraries - Elastic search, Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas, Requests, Sci-kit learn are the libraries needed for the project.\n\nSource code with Guided Videos - Building a Similar Image Finder in Python\n\n12) Topic Modelling using K-Means Cluster Project on Data Science using Python\n\nTopic modelling is extracting significant words from a text or paragraph which can aptly describe the whole paragraph in short. It is like summarisation, but topic modelling specifically concentrates on short sentences or groups of words. It is a flavour of text mining to obtain recurring patterns of words that form crucial data points for the topic.\n\nSteps involved in implementing this Python Project for Data Science -\n\nData Cleaning\n\nThis step removes all the patterns/symbols that are not beneficial for the algorithm in the dataset.\n\nFor example, symbols like ‘ @’, ‘ to ’, ‘ a ’, ‘ the ’ are removed from the tweet database. Even words with a word length less than 3 are not essential.\n\nNumbers also can be removed from the tweets.\n\nTokenise\n\nTokenisation extracts all the individual words in the text and counting their instances in the dataset.\n\nVectorise the data\n\nTerm frequency-inverse document Frequency vectorisation defines how important a particular word is to a document in a dataset or corpus. It counts the number of times a word occur in the document and compares it with other documents. The more a word appears in multiple documents, the lower is the TFIDF number and vice versa. Less frequency of a world implies uniqueness.\n\nCount Vectoriser simply counts the number of occurrences of a word in the whole corpus. The total number of features get defined by the total number of unique words in the corpus.\n\nLibraries - Nltk, wordcloud, sklearn, requests\n\nThe project uses unsupervised k-means clustering to identify main topics or ideas in reviews/test datasets. Cluster is the endpoints of our corpus. For example, tweets get labelled as happy, neutral, sad, angry. These categories would become the four end clusters.\n\nClustering with eight centroid\n\nEight clusters mean there will be eight clusters the algorithm will output. The semantics and meaning of the clusters will have to be inferred by us.\n\nClustering with two centroid\n\nTwo centroids imply there will be 2 clusters. Less number of centres may affect the efficiency of the algorithm since there will only be two topics.\n\nSource Code and Guided Videos - Topic Modelling using K-means Cluster\n\n13) Human Activity Recognition Data Science Project in Python\n\nThe project recognises human activity such as cycling, walking, laying, running by analysing the location, gyroscope and accelerometer readings. Activity recognition finds use in smartwatches and smartphones that run fitness tracking applications. The project is confined to 6 specific activities: Walking, laying, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing.\n\nDataset Description\n\nData is from an experiment on 30 people who undertook various activities while wearing smartphones.\n\nData Pre-Processing\n\nNull values in the data set are replaced by either mean, median or zero. The mode places the missing data in the data set. The technique is called Mode replacement.\n\nMaintain a count of occurrences for each activity to check if data skews towards an activity more than others. A well-balanced dataset is one where the number of occurrences for each activity is almost the same.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\nUni variate analysis\n\nNecessary fields such as Standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and mean values are plotted against each data variable in the data set. A normal distribution with one bell shape implies that the data variable is distributed generally across the data set.\n\nBi-Variate analysis\n\nBi variate analysis plots two different features on the x and y axes and plots their relationship. A graphical curve helps discern the patterns and dependency between features and variables.\n\ntSNE plot\n\nA multivariate analysis becomes difficult when there are many variables involved, sometimes even up to 500. A plot with 500 variables just doesn’t make sense.\n\ntSNE plots help when there are numerous variables in the plot to visualise multivariate systems into two-dimensional data.\n\nNormalisation or Standardisation\n\nNormalisation is the process to scale down the large variable ranges under -1 and 1. It accomplishes the measurement of each variable against a standard metric.\n\nAfter normalisation, an ideal output would be when the mean is zero and the standard deviation is one.\n\nLibraries -Python Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, seaborn\n\nSource Code and Guided Videos - Human Activity Recognition in Python\n\n14) Topic Modelling using LDA with RACE Dataset\n\nThe objective of the project is to extract the dominant topic from the text or document. Topic modelling finds use in labelling vast amounts of unstructured data and organising the texts into topics and labels. Semantically and logically similar words group under the same topic.\n\nDataset Preprocessing Steps\n\nlowercasing all words\n\nTokenising words and Lemmatization\n\nRemoving stop words and punctuations\n\nAdding all the tokens from the document to forms the processed document\n\nTransform the processed document using TFIDF or count vectoriser\n\nLibraries - Numpy, matpltlib, sci-kit learn, nltk, pandas, tsne, pvLDAvis\n\nLatent semantic analysis, Latent Dirichlet allocation and Non-negative matrix factorisation are some of the algorithms and techniques that one can learn from this Python data science project.\n\nSource Code with Guided Dataset - Topic Modelling using LDA\n\n15) Rossman Store Sales Prediction Project on Data Science using Python\n\nA store’s sales depend on the day of the month, time of the day, promotion, offers, seasonality, etc. It is hard to predict the sales on any given day in general. Sales prediction is also imperative for company insights and sourcing materials before keeping the stocks from running out. It also helps us know when to start running seasonal or day-wise offers to attract more people to the store.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe data set for the project is collected from Rossman stores historical data from the Kaggle site.\n\nSource Code and Guided Videos - Rossman Store Prediction Sales Project\n\n16) Time-Series using Long Short Term Memory Forecasting\n\nLSTM or Long-Term Memory Network is an artificial recurrent neural network with a memory cell in each node. An LSTM has feedback connections in its hidden layers that make it different from Feed Forward Neural network. It overcomes the problem of vanishing gradient.\n\nSome common examples include sentiment analysis, video analysis, speech recognition etc.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe data set contains a monthly number of passengers that commute through a particular airline. The data is formatted as - the month of the year, number of passengers. The project’s objective is to predict the number of passengers in the future for a given month using past data and recent memory.\n\nNormalise the data\n\nThe data is normalised using the MinMaxScaler function present in the package preprocessing under sklearn. After the MinMaxScaler operation, we need to transform the dataset under the -1 to 1 range.\n\nLibraries\n\nPandas, matplotlib, dataset, keras, math, sklearn\n\nImplementation\n\nLSTMs are RNN that overcome the limitations like exploding gradient and vanishing error. It can minimise the error in each iteration and arrive at an accurate prediction. It uses two layers that are encoder and decoder. The encoder layer reads the input sequence and outputs a vector representation of the sequence. The encoder output is fed to the decoder which interprets it into a unique value for each time-point in the time series.\n\nSource Code and Guided Videos - Time Series using Long Short Term Memory Forecasting\n\n17) Fake News Classification Python Project for Data Science\n\nFake news creeps up in our news feeds and subterfuge the truth. Fake news is a deliberate\n\nmisrepresentation of data and facts. With easy accessibility to the internet, new media and news houses have popped up all over the country. And consequently, it has become easier to publish and propagate unchecked news. It is crucial to curb such articles and news posts.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe data set contains news in the following format.\n\nNews_id, news_author, news_text, news_label, news_title\n\nData Cleaning\n\nRemove missing records\n\nMerge together all text\n\nDelete special characters from the text\n\nData Preparation\n\nTokenisation\n\nBuild vocabulary for filtering text\n\nSequence data preparation\n\nMaximum sequencing length\n\nPadding\n\nWord embedding\n\nWord embedding converts text data into numerical vectors.\n\nLibraries - Sci-kit, TensorFlow, Keras, glove, flask, NLTK, pandas, NumPy\n\n18) Retail Price Optimization based on Price Elasticity of Demand.\n\nPrice elasticity of a demand or Elasticity is the degree to which the effective desire of something changes as the price changes. As a general observation, as things become expensive, people tend to desire those things less. The elasticity of price and demand varies from product to product. There are products for which customers will show a sharp drop in desire if the price increases a little. While there are products that exhibit hardly any plummet in demand regardless of price soars.\n\nDataset Description\n\nData set includes product name, product price, regional holidays, product combo with other products etc.\n\nSubsetting\n\nSubsetting is the idea of creating a subset of features that will aptly define the model. It excludes all the extra and unnecessary features that don't contribute to the model accuracy.\n\nReplace missing data points\n\nDelete entries with price as 0\n\nLibraries\n\nNumpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy.sparse, lightGBM\n\nImplementation\n\nLinear Regression plots variables on a linear graph to model the transformed/normalised dataset.\n\nLightGBM uses a tree-based algorithm for the gradient boost framework.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Retail Price Optimisation based on Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nData Science Mini Projects in Python\n\nBelow you will find samples of two simple data science projects in Python that are pretty easy to implement. These mini projects for data science using Python will be especially useful if you are a final year student.\n\n19) Customer Churn Prediction for Organisation\n\nThe churn rate is the annual percentage rate that signifies customers’ unsubscribing rate from a service or the rate of employees leaving their jobs. A company needs to know which customers will leave them to route their advertisement and engagement efforts with these customers appropriately.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe data set contains bank records collected over a period of time. Following are the details useful for the project :\n\nCustomer id\n\nCustomer surname\n\nGender\n\nGeography is the location of the customer\n\nTenure is the association time with the bank so far)\n\nBalance\n\nAge\n\nProducts used\n\nA credit card is a binary field denoting if the customer has a credit card.\n\nData transformation\n\nOutlier and missing value treatment\n\nOutliers can affect the mean and standard deviation in the data set. So it is crucial to treat them by either deleting the entries or replacing them with mean/median values.\n\nMissing values make the corpus weak and inadequate and can skew the results. Columns with too many missing values are dropped out of the dataset.\n\nEncoding\n\nEncoding is the process of converting data set values into categorical values.\n\nLabel Encoding - Label encoding is used for binary categorical or ordinal values where the order or labels of entries are essential.\n\nOne-hot encoding - It is helpful for non-ordinal categorical variables with mid cardinality, i.e. several occurrences.\n\nTarget encoding - Target coding is used where variables show high cardinality.\n\nFeature Selection\n\nNot every feature is as crucial for data analysis and model fitting. Some features do not show any distribution curve because of randoms. It is vital to select only those features that help in model fitting.\n\nUnivariate selection\n\nRecursive feature elimination - This function recursively removes features that do not add to the model’s accuracy. While in the end, only the essential features remain.\n\nPrincipal component analysis transforms a dataset with many variables into a compressed form with fewer variables, keeping the data distribution and characteristics intact.\n\nLibraries\n\nNumpy, sklearn, keras, pandas, joblib\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Customer churn for Organisation\n\n20) Credit Card Fraud Detection Project as Classification Problem\n\nCredit Cards companies should be able to discern the fraudulent transactions happening over their systems so that they can charge the customer justly and correctly. Companies need to have a model for understanding which transactions are genuine and which ones are potentially fake. The problem becomes complex as the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that there are very few fake transactions among the genuine transaction.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe Data set contains the transactions performed by customers for a specific time block. The data set holds three fields - time, amount and numerical input values. Numerical input values are the output of Principal Component Analysis transformation on the feature set.\n\nIn comparison, time and amount are the time of transaction and amount of transaction, respectively. The PCA transformation is applied to hide the customer information and features to maintain confidentiality.\n\nLibraries\n\nNumpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib\n\nThe crux of the credit card fraud detection model depends on the concept of the validation matrix. Validation matrices define how accurate the true predictions are among the actual true data. Following are the two types of validation matrices used:\n\nRecall matrix is the ratio of the actual number of accurate predictions to the total number of valid values.\n\nPrecision Matrix is the ratio of the actual true values in the dataset to the total number of true predictions given by the model.\n\nRandom Forest Classifier\n\nSupport Vector classifier\n\nDecision Tree Classifier\n\nK-nearest neighbour classifier or KNN\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nAmong all the algorithms, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbour are the most accurate.\n\nSource Code with Guided Videos - Credit card fraud detection using Classification\n\nData Science Projects in Python with Source Code On Github\n\nIn this project, you will find ideas for python data science projects with source code along with their github repository links.\n\nDetecting Parkinson’s Disease Python Project for Data Science\n\nParkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and coordination, and it is often difficult to diagnose in its early stages.
