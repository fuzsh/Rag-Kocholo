The Sound of Music

Notes

The Nonnberg Abbey (Benedictine) in Salzburg was founded AD 714; current buildings are from the XVI century.

Maria von Trapp was born Maria Augusta von Kutschera; born January 25, 1905, in Vienna; graduated from college; presented herself at Nonnberg as a candidate for the Novitiate.

Married Georg von Trapp November 26, 1927; founded family choir in early 1930s; fled Austria in 1938 to Italy, then to the United States, with 10 children; died March 28, 1987, Stowe, Vermont.

Georg Ludwig Ritter von Trapp; born April 4, 1880, in Zara (Zadar), Croatia (then part of Hungary); father a naval captain; attended naval academy at Fiume (Rijeka); married Agathe Whitehead, 1910; commanded U-boat "U6"; sank French sub "Leon Gambetta"; promoted Korvettenkapitän (Lt Cdr) in 1918; in recognition of his wartime service, he was permitted to put "von" in his name, and given the title Ritter (knight); Agathe died 1924, having borne him 7 children; left Austria 1938. died May 30, 1947, Stowe, Vermont.

Fr Wasner became family chaplain, 1935; fled Austria with them.

The Anschluss occurred March, 1938.

The original plan for this show was to use only songs sung by the Trapp family on their concert tours. That proved unsuitable, so it was decided to write entirely new songs and use no songs from their tours.

A nun is a religious sister that lives in a cloister. A sister that lives in a convent, is strictly speaking, not a nun.

A woman who wishes to join a community of nuns is first accepted as a postulant, in which her vocation is tested. She is not under vows. After a period of time, if she appears to have a vocation to the cloistered life, she takes temporary vows, for three to six years, and becomes a novice, and receives a habit. At the end of that period, if she is still determined to remain in the cloister, she takes solemn, permanent vows, and is now a full member of the community.
