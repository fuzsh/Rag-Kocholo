        "text": "Eleonore von Trapp Campbell, the second daughter of Maria von Trapp, whose Austrian family was depicted in the stage musical and the beloved movie “The Sound of Music,” died on Oct. 24 in Northfield, Vt. She was 90.\n\nThe death was confirmed by Day Funeral Home in Randolph, Vt.\n\nMrs. Campbell was a younger half sister to the von Trapp children who were depicted in “Die Trapp-Familie” (“The Trapp Family”), a 1956 West German film, and later in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “The Sound of Music” and its 1965 movie adaptation. All those works were based loosely on a 1949 autobiographical book by Maria von Trapp, who died in 1987.\n\n“The Sound of Music” tells the story of an Austrian governess (played by Julie Andrews in the film) who marries her employer, a widower (Christopher Plummer in the film), and then teaches his seven children music. The movie won the Academy Award for best picture.\n\nMrs. Campbell’s father, Capt. Georg von Trapp, and his first wife, Agathe Whitehead von Trapp, had the seven children who were the basis for the singing family. Maria Kutschera married the captain after Agathe von Trapp died.\n\nGeorg and Maria von Trapp had three children, who were not depicted in the movie; Mrs. Campbell was the second. Early on, she sang soprano as a member of the Trapp Family Singers, who performed in Europe before World War II and, after fleeing Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938, continued to do so in the United States and internationally.\n\n“The life of singing on tour is one that involves an extraordinary amount of discipline and hard work,” Mrs. Campbell’s daughter Elizabeth Peters said, “and my mother lived as a teenager singing lead soprano, night after night after night, and toured much of the year, and it really shaped who she was.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
