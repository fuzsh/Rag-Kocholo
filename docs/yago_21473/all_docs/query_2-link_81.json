        "text": "Hailed as the world’s most ­beloved musical – it is the true story of a girl who wants to be a nun but falls in love with a widower and his seven children.\n\nThe Sound of Music came out 50 years ago and held millions of cinema goers spellbound.\n\nJulie Andrews warbling her way across the ­mountains in the role of Maria von Trapp remains one of the silver screen’s iconic images.\n\nBut the real-life Maria could hardly have been more different.\n\nInstead of the film’s scatty, wide-eyed girl who sang about whiskers on ­kittens, Maria was domineering and prone to rages.\n\nShe has even been branded a religious fanatic.\n\nA difficult Austrian childhood left her with, in the words of her son Johannes, “insecurities that plagued her all of her life”.\n\nIn a new book, The Sound of Music Story by Tom Santopietro, Johannes, 75, recalls: “She was a complex person, incredibly strong with a formidable will, literally an indomitable will.\n\n“And sometimes running into that will was not so pleasant.\n\n“She had a very unhappy childhood. Someone with her background either ­becomes a very strong ­person or becomes a homeless person. She ­became very strong.”\n\nMillions of people have watched the screen ­version of Maria’s ­amazing story. How she left a convent to become a governess, married her boss and fled with the children to escape the Nazis.\n\nIn fact, her life was ­incredible from the moment she was born Maria Kutschera in 1905 – on a train and delivered by the conductor.\n\nBy the time she was three her mother was dead. Her father died when she was nine.\n\nMaria was sent to live with a violent uncle. She ran away to Vienna in her teens and by 19 she had found God.\n\nShe enrolled in a Benedictine convent in Salzberg, then went to take a job as governess at the home of widowed Baron Georg von Trapp, a ­retired ­navy captain.\n\nJohannes, who still runs the hotel the family opened in Vermont, USA, says: “My mother was absolutely unsuited for a ­contemplative life in the abbey and I suspect the nuns were happy when the position she took opened up in our father’s house.”\n\nWhat followed inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical then the Oscar-winning film. The story follows true events only loosely and the portrayal of the family has frequently irritated the real von Trapps.\n\nToday only three of the children survive. They are Rosmarie, Eleonore and Johannes, all born to Maria and her husband, Baron von Trapp. The 1965 film features only the seven von Trapp children from Georg’s first marriage and it changes their names.\n\nThe family did not hike over the mountains from Austria to Switzerland in 1938 as the film shows but took a train to Italy.\n\nThey then sailed to America and formed the famous Trapp Family singing group.\n\nAs Agathe, the eldest daughter who died in 2010, put it: “It’s a very nice story but it’s not our story. If they hadn’t used our name I ­probably would have enjoyed it.”\n\nDirector Robert Wise firmly rebuffed Maria’s attempts to act as adviser on the film. He later admitted: “She was bossy, I didn’t like that about her.”\n\nFor her part, she thought the Maria portrayed by Julie Andrews was wet.\n\nShe said Julie and Mary Martin, who took the role on the Broadway stage, were “too gentle – I was a wild creature”.\n\nThere was also little physical resemblance. Maria was a well-built woman, while Julie, was “so slight by comparison” ­according to Christopher Plummer, who played Baron von Trapp.\n\nHe found Maria “buxom, bouncy and bossy” but she liked Plummer and told him: “You’re more ­handsome than my real husband.”\n\nYears later when they met again, Maria cried out: “My husband, My husband!”\n\nMaria was also not the dewy-eyed bride the film showed. The real couple married in 1927, when Georg was 47 and Maria 22. She once confessed: “I didn’t love him, I loved the children.”\n\nStill, when mild-mannered Georg – he was not at all stern as the film suggested – died in 1947, Maria missed him terribly.\n\nJohannes, who was born in the US, recalled: “My mother was a bundle of energy. She was the ­engine and my father guided it and ­directed it. They were very well matched in that regard.”\n\nMaria’s children often found her dificult. Rosmarie, who had long suffered from stage fright, refused to continue the constant gruelling touring with the Trapp Family act after her father died.\n\nShe said: “I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it.”\n\nWhen Rosmarie had a breakdown and was found wandering across a field, Maria’s response was to send her for shock therapy.\n\nAnd when step-daughter Johanna announced she was ­marrying, Maria locked her in her room.\n\nShe had to climb out of a window to elope.\n\nThe film did not make the children rich because Maria – who died in 1987 aged 82 after working as a missionary – sold the rights for only 9,000 dollars.\n\nJohannes recalled: “She never quite accepted they could do what they wanted with the story. She was used to controlling things.”\n\nComparing the film with reality, Rosmarie, 87, added: “We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.”\n\nThe Sound of Music Story, by Tom Santopietro, is out now, Bantam Press, £16.99.\n\nThe original Von Trapp children\n\nRupert - Born 1911.
