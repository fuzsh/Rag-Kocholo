        "text": "And now a page from our \"Sunday Morning\" Almanac: January 26th, 1905, 109 years ago today . . . Day One of a journey that led from Austria to Broadway to Hollywood.\n\nFor that was the day Maria Augusta Kutschera was born on a train bound for Vienna.\n\nOrphaned at age seven, Maria studied to be a teacher before entering a convent in Salzburg.\n\nIn 1926, she was assigned to tutor the bedridden daughter of a widower and former naval captain, Georg von Trapp.\n\nWhat happened next inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \"The Sound of Music\" . . . first on the stage with Mary Martin, then on the screen with Julie Andrews.\n\nNot that the musical stuck strictly to reality.\n\nMaria and Georg DID marry, but years earlier than in the show.\n\nThe musical changed the names of the seven children from von Trapp's first marriage . . . and never mentioned the three children Maria later bore.\n\nAnother difference: the von Trapp family was singing publicly for years before the German takeover of Austria.\n\nAnd forget about climbing every mountain! When they fled the Nazis, they didn't hike across the Alps into Switzerland -- they took the train to Italy.\n\nBy the early 1940s, the Von Trapp family arrived in the United States, and eventually established a family ski lodge in Stowe, Vermont.\n\nGeorg von Trapp died in 1947, but Maria lived to see her story re-told in musical form.\n\nAnd in 1973, Maria von Trapp even got a chance to teach proper yodeling to Julie Andrews on her ABC variety show.\n\nMaria von Trapp died in 1987 . . . but the songs her life story inspired echo still.\n\nFor more info:"
