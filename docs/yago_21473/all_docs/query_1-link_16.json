        "text": "Baron Captain Georg Ritter von Trapp\n\n(1880-1947)\n\nGeorg Ritter (Knight) von Trapp (later elevated to Baron) was born on April 4, 1880 in Zara, Austro-Hungarian Empire (today Zadar, Croatia). Both his parents, Captain August Ritter (Knight) von Trapp and Hedwig Wepler, were musically inclined and passed on a passion for music to their children Hede, Georg, and Werner. His father August was gifted with an exceptional auditory memory, where he could reproduce melodies heard once on the piano to the delight of his family and friends. On Georg's mother's side, his Aunt Mina Wepler was a professional pianist in Hesse (today Hesse, Germany). Georg was also an accomplished musician and had learned to play the violin, fiddle, guitar, mandolin, harmonica, and accordion. As a father, Georg passed on a love of music to his children. He personally taught them to play several musical instruments and shared many navy and folk songs from the various lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Making music together was the fabric of their family life.\n\nBaroness Johanna Karolina Gobertina von Trapp\n\n(1919-1994)\n\nMusical Instruments: Johanna learned the violin from her father, had piano and clarinet lessons in her youth, and played the recorder and guitar.\n\nTrapp Family Choir, Trapp Family Singers, and Trapp Family Music Camp: Johanna was a First Soprano vocalist and played recorder for the groups from 1934-1948.\n\nAfter Touring: In 1948 Johanna married Ernst Florian Winter and stopped touring. They raised seven children and lived in the U.S. and Austria. She supported her husband's diplomatic career and work with students. Her artistic career continued with creating ceramics and painting wildlife watercolors. The last exhibition of her work was in Salzburg, Austria in 1993.\n\nBaron Rupert Georg Gobertus Ritter (Knight) von Trapp\n\n(1911-1992 )\n\nMusical Instruments: Rupert learned accordion from his father, had piano lessons in his youth, and played the tenor recorder.\n\nTrapp Family Choir, Trapp Family Singers, and Trapp Family Music Camp: Rupert was the Bass vocalist and played tenor recorder for the groups from 1934-1943.\n\nAfter Touring: In 1943, Rupert stopped touring to serve in WWII with the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division. Later, he completed his American medical degree and maintained a successful medical practice. He married Henriette Lajoie and together raised six children. After many years, they divorced and he married Janice Tyre.\n\nFrederick C. Schang / F.C 'Freddy' Schang (1893-1971)\n\n​Columbia Concerts, Inc (Today Columbia Artist Management, Inc.)\n\nTrapp Family Singers Concert Manager (from 1940-1955)\n\nFrederick Christian Schang graduated from Columbia School of Journalism. He was a reporter for the New York Tribune and then later worked for the Metropolitan Music Bureau. In 1948 he was elected President of Columbia Artists Management. He represented many musical groups and was responsible for their concert bookings. For over fifteen years he was the Trapp Family Singers' concert manager, contributing to their success both within the United States and abroad.\n\nCountess Agathe von Breunner\n\n(1859-1945)\n\nAgathe's mother, Countess Agathe von Breunner, was the von Trapp childrens' Grandmother. They affectionately called her 'Gromi', a nickname for Grandmother. Gromi's side of the family was musically inclined. She was musically accomplished herself as she had formal musical training in her youth. She too ensured that her own children Agathe, John, Frank, Mary, and Joan, also received formal musical training. During WWI, Gromi provided a safe harbor for her daughters and their families, at her home in Zell am See, Austria. One of the earliest experiences of Agathe's children (the von Trapp children) remembered of this time Zell am See was of the family making music together. Their mother played the piano, violin, and sang folk songs with her sisters. Gromi played piano, sometimes 'four-hands' style. The von Trapps also remembered the children's music book Gromi gave them, Sang und Klang Fuer's Kinderherz/Songs and Sounds for the Child's Heart. After the war, Gromi's side of the family continued to make music time with the von Trapps whenever they were together.\n\nAgathe Gobertina Whitehead von Trapp\n\n(1891-1922)\n\nAgathe Gobertina Whitehead, Georg's first wife and mother to their seven children, was born June 14, 1891, in Fiume, Austro-Hungarian Empire (today Rijeka, Croatia). Her father was British engineer Knight John Whitehead (son of British engineer Robert Whitehead, the inventor of the torpedo) and Countess Agathe von Breunner of Austro-Hungarian nobility. Although Agathe passed away a little over a decade before the von Trapp children started singing professionally, her musical influence was felt for a lifetime. She inherited a deep passion for music from her mother, Countess Agathe von Breunner, who was a talented amateur musician. Also on her mother's side, Agathe's Great-great-grandparents, Count Johann Esterházy and Countess Rosa Festetics, had been musical patrons of the Austrian composer Franz Shubert. In the early 1800's, Schubert stayed with the Esterházy's for several summers and tutored piano to their two daughters Marie and Karoline. As a girl Agathe learned to play the piano, violin, and to sing. When she grew up, as was custom at the time, her mother and she would often entertain at gatherings and parties for guests, family, and friends. At such an event, Georg met Agathe for the first time in 1909. As a mother, she played music for her children and made music together with them, weaving it into their daily lives.\n\nGeorg and Agathe\n\nCaptain Georg von Trapp and Agathe Gobertina Whitehead married in 1911. Music had played a role in their first meeting. In 1909, they both attended an Austro-Hungarian Navy celebration in Fiume (today Rijeka, Croatia). There, Agathe and her mother entertained guests with the violin, piano, and song. Georg fell in love with Agathe and described it as \"love at first sight\".\n\nFor Georg and Agathe, making music was a long-standing tradition going back many generations in both of their families. Each played several instruments and passed down a love and passion for music to their seven children. They personally instructed their children in musical instruments and singing. As was the custom at the time, the children also received formal musical training at a young age. Playing music together as a family was a daily occurrence in the von Trapp household.\n\nDuring WWI from 1914-1918, Georg became one of the most decorated commanders of the 20th century Austro-Hungarian Navy. Tragically in 1922, Agathe Whitehead von Trapp passed away from Scarlet Fever, after nursing her children back to health from the infection. Georg became a single parent for several years, caring for his children and continuing the musical tradition.\n\nBaron Werner Gobertus Ritter (Knight) von Trapp\n\n(1915-2007)\n\nMusical Instruments: Werner had cello and clarinet lessons in his youth and was a choir member at school.

In 1994 she collaborated on the CD recording \"Folk Harp Music of Austria\". She knits and crochets and is active in the arts and crafts community.\n\nBaroness Agathe Johanna Gobertina von Trapp\n\n(1913-2010)\n\n​Musical Instruments: Agathe learned guitar from her father, had piano lessons in her youth, and played recorder.\n\nTrapp Family Choir, Trapp Family Singers, and Trapp Family Music Camp: Agathe was a First Soprano vocalist and played recorder for the groups from 1934-1956.\n\nAfter Touring:After 1956, Agathe and a life-long friend founded a kindergarten in a Maryland.

A graduate of Hunter College, she promoted the Juilliard String Quartet for 23 years, The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center for 22 years, the Trapp Family Singers for more than two decades and pianist André Watts, tenor Richard Tucker, and New York Philharmonic for fifteen years. Alix suggested and encouraged Baroness Maria Kutschera von Trapp to write her memoirs which later became the basis for the musical The Sound of Music.\n\nA Musical Childhood\n\nCaptain Georg von Trapp and Agathe Gobertina Whitehead, his first wife, had seven children who were later portrayed in the musical, The Sound of Music. The von Trapp children at a young age were all musically trained and the family loved making music together daily. In their playroom a gramophone exposed them to the musical likes of Johann Strauss, Mozart, Franz Liszt, and Beethoven. As the children grew older, Georg personally taught Rupert and Maria the accordion, Agathe the guitar, and Johanna the violin. From a teacher Martina and Hedwig learned the piano and Werner learned the cello and clarinet. Georg also sang navy and folk songs with the children accompanied by his guitar. They formed a small family Quartet consisting of Georg as first violin, Johanna as second violin, Rupert or Maria on accordion, and Agathe on guitar. As Maria later recalled,​ \"Growing up, we were surrounded by music.\" Johanna remembered, \"We sang early on with my father. I can remember running through the house singing. As children, we sang simple folk sings in two-part harmony... He [my father] wrote his friends, 'My children sing the whole day long.' \".\n\nMaria Augusta Kutschera\n\n(1905-1987)\n\nMaria Augusta Kutschera was born January 26, 1905 in Vienna, Austro-Hungarian Empire (today Vienna, Austria) to parents Karl Kutschera and Augusta Rainer. Her father and mother died when she was young and she was raised by other family members. In her youth her musical interests grew as she learned folk songs and guitar through an Austrian youth movement, the Neuland. She spent several summers with the group, collecting regional folk songs and holding impromptu performances. Later she attended and gradated from the State Teacher's College of Progressive Education in Vienna, with a teaching certificate. During her studies she enjoyed the musical traditions and culture of Vienna, both secular and religious. After graduation she moved to Salzburg and taught fifth grade at the Nonnberg Abbey, from where she was hired as a live-in tutor at Villa Trapp. When Maria Augusta joined the von Trapp family, she taught the children the folks songs she knew. In 1927 Maria Augusta and Georg were wed. As a family, they had all the required vocal ranges necessary for four-part music like madrigals and masses. They maintained the musical tradition Georg and Agathe instilled, by making musical music together daily.\n\nBaroness Eleonore Elisabeth von Trapp\n\n(1931-2021)\n\nMusical Instruments: Eleonore played the recorder and spinet.\n\nTrapp Family Singers and Trapp Family Music Camp: Eleonore debuted as a recorder soloist in 1941, at the age of 10, and was a Second Soprano vocalist from 1944-1948 and a First Soprano with the group from 1948-1954.​\n\nAfter Touring: In 1954 Eleonore married Hugh Campbell and stopped touring with the family. Together they raised seven children. Often gathering her family and friends, she is known for being a great hostess and cook. She is an accomplished seamstress and enjoys gardening.\n\nGeorg & Maria Augusta\n\nIn 1925, three years after Georg's first wife Agathe Gobertina Whitehead von Trapp passed away, Georg moved his family of seven children to Aigen, near Salzburg, Austria, for a fresh start. In 1926, Maria Augusta Kutschera was hired as a live-in-tutor for Georg's third child, Maria, who suffered from health issues that temporarily prevented her from attending school. In 1927, he married Maria Augusta Kutschera. At the time, his children ranged in age from 5 to 16: Rupert, Agathe, Maria, Werner, Hedwig, Johanna, and Martina. Later, Georg and Maria Kutschera von Trapp had three children: Rosmarie, Eleonore, and Johannes.\n\nIn the early 1930's, the family lost a large part of their wealth due to a global depression and a banking failure. Georg worked on several endeavors to stabilize their financial situation, including writing his WWI memories, lecturing, and exploring some engineering ideas. They were able to stay at their home in Aigen, but took on boarders to help cover their expenses.\n\nIn 1934 the family started publicly singing along with the oldest seven von Trapp children, who ranged in age from fourteen to twenty years old. In 1935 the group was joined by Rev. Dr. Franz Wasner as Musical Director. For the next twenty years the family toured professionally, establishing themselves as world-renowned musicians.\n\nIn 1949, Maria Kutschera von Trapp wrote The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, sharing about the family's musical career and their 1938 escape from pre-WWII Austria.\n\nBaroness Maria Augusta Kutschera von Trapp (1905-1987)\n\nAlto Singer & Recorder Player (from 1934-1956)\n\nChorale Co-Manager (from 1947-1956)\n\nMaria Augusta was with the Trapp Family Choir and Trapp Family Singers from beginning to the end.

She acted as the 'master of ceremonies' at their concerts, providing background information on the family and their songs. For twelve years Maria was also a host at the family's summer Trapp Family Music Camp. After her husband Georg passed away in 1947, she took on the mantle of co-managing the Trapp Family Singers together with Rev. Franz Wasner, their Musical Director. Later she went on to lecture and manage the family's Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont.\n\nReverend Dr. Franz Wasner (later Monsignor) (1905-1992)\n\nMusical Director, Composer, Bass Singer & Spinet Player (from 1935-1956)\n\nChorale Co-Manager (from 1947-1956)\n\nWasner was musically trained and specialized in 16th-18th-century music. In 1934 he graduated with a doctorate in cannon law from Rome. He then moved to Salzburg to teach Gregorian chant and serve as Assistant Director at the Salzburg Seminary. In 1935 Wasner started coaching the von Trapp family, who had won recognition in a folk singing contest the year before Wasner further cultivated their talents becoming their long-time Musical Director, and touring with the group for twenty years. Twelve years of which, he also taught music at the family's summer Trapp Family Music Camp. In 1947, after Georg passed away, he and Maria Kutschera von Trapp co-managed the Trapp Family Singers.\n\nBaron Captain Georg von Trapp (1880-1947)\n\nChorale Manager & Logistics (from 1934-1947)\n\nAt the beginning of the von Trapp musicians' career, Georg performed on stage and radio a few times with his family: singing folk song and playing quartets as first violin. At the same time he promoted his WWI Memoir, To the Last Salute, and lectured across Austria and Germany. When the family's repertoire changed from folk songs to early chorale music, Georg moved from \"front-of-house\" to \"back-of-house\", taking care of transportation, logistics, equipment, and contracts, etc. He toured every season with his family, often driving the group from between U.S. cities, attending to concert needs, and giving radio and newspaper interviews. Additionally, Georg was a host during their summer Trapp Family Music Camp and played violin with his children in a family Quartet. He was acknowledged by his family as \"the quiet support behind the family's success.\"\n\nBaron Johannes Georg Sebastian von Trapp\n\n(b. 1939)\n\nMusical Instruments: Johannes played the recorder.\n\nTrapp Family Singers and Trapp Family Music Camp: Johannes debuted as a recorder soloist as a small child and then as a Soprano vocalist in 1948 at 9 years old. Later, as a Bass vocalist, he sang with the Trapp Family Singers until 1956.\n\nAfter Touring: He graduated from Dartmouth College and received his Masters at Yale University's School of Forestry. He married Lynne Peterson and together they raised two children. Johannes owns and operates the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont. He is also an avid hunter and sportsman.\n\nFive years after Agathe passed away from Scarlet Fever, Georg married his second wife, Maria Augusta Kutschera, who then became known as Baroness Maria Augusta von Trapp. Maria August was later portrayed as Maria Rainer in the musical, The Sounds of Music. She had three children that were not represented in the film: Baroness Rosmarie von Trapp, Baroness Eleonore von Trapp, and Baron Johannes von Trapp.\n\nThe combined family of ten children, Georg, Maria Augusta and their Musical Director, Rev. Dr. Franz Wasner, went on to establish the world-renowned musical chorale group, the Trapp Family Choir (1934-1940) and Trapp Family Singers (1940-1956).
