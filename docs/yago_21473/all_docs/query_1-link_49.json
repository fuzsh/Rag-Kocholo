Georg von Trapp, a widowed naval officer, married Maria Augusta Kutschera, a former nun. Together with his seven children, they formed the Trapp Family Singers and fled Austria in 1938 to escape the Nazis. They settled in the United States, where they became famous for their concerts and recordings.\n\nBroadway Musical\n\nIn 1959, the story was adapted into a Broadway musical, \"The Sound of Music,\" with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II.
