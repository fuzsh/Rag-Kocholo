        "text": "March 28, 2021\n\nMARIA, the autobiography of Maria Von Trapp of \"The Sound of Music\" fame, is a quite readable book and goes quickly. The thing I most enjoyed was getting the story of Maria's childhood, her education, and what led her to the convent at the Benedictine Abbey at Nonnberg, Austria. She was indeed an intelligent, high spirited, physically active girl who had a hard time settling down to the restricted life of a novice but her desire to serve God was strong. She was not happy to be sent as a nanny for Captain Von Trapp's children, though he was not the military martinet portrayed in the movie and, in fact, had a warm and loving relationship with the children. Some details of family life are glossed over (this is a personal book about Maria and her spiritual life, really) and we are even referred to her earlier book STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS for more information. Maria does describe the escape from Nazi-held Austria and enumerates the concert tours that followed. The family settles in Stowe, Vermont, in the United States where they buy a farm and eventually build a lodge. They hold summer singing camps there in between concert tours and end up becoming innkeepers and restaurateurs. Maria describes their hard struggles to make ends meet as well as her own struggles to \"know God's will.\" Whenever she is at an impasse, Maria seeks out a priest or nun for guidance and finds the next step on the path. She takes a year off at one point and goes visiting Catholic missions in the Pacific (three of her children are missionaries at one station). She is a strongly traditional Catholic, but the surprise of the book is what happens when she runs into the Catholic Pentecostal Movement. That takes up the final chapters of the book. While much of this book covers the mundane, it interested me to know the real Maria, her thoughts and struggles, her stubbornness, her domineering personality, and her willingness to look at herself and change.\n\nDecember 20, 2016\n\nEste é um livro ternurento que conta a verdadeira história de Maria Von Trapp (a heroína de Música no Coração). É uma história de vida, de provação, de miséria mas também de superação e de amor.\n\nO tema essencial deste livro é o amor, o amor na família e o amor ao próximo, como tal um livro maravilhoso para ser lido na época natalícia.\n\nJuly 6, 2011\n\nThe autobiography of Maria Von Trapp and the Von Trapp Family Singers.\n\nOn a recent car trip I listened as my boys watched Sound of Music for the first time. Even though I couldn't see what was happening I knew it. Always been one of my favorites since childhood. So I thought I'd take the Hollywood out of the story and find out the truth.\n\nMaria Von Trapp's account of her life was interesting. Her writing was rather simple and seemed to be more like how she would talk. It was rather linear in the first half of the book up until her husband died, but then seemed to be more topical in each chapter thereafter - often filling in facts in the strangest places. She was not very detailed, but included bits and pieces and anecdotes. However you get a good sense of her personality and the struggles they all went through. She was a woman of faith, though it fluctuated at times. I had no idea of her missions to the Pacific Islanders or the Lodge they ran in Stowe Vermont or how much she traveled around the world on speaking tours. I would have liked to learn more about her marriage, their life in Austrian and their escape (which was crossing the street to the train station and not the Alps!), but that all may be in her first book \"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\". Nevertheless, she had an extraordinary life!\n\nJuly 23, 2012\n\nI've read The Story of the Trapp Family Singers a couple times, and thought I'd check out a couple more books about the von Trapp family. This is a nice complement to The Story of the Trapp Family Singers; indeed, I am left with the impression that this includes a lot of the memories that did not make it in the first book, as well as adding her memories and life after the end of the previous installment. Much of it covers her life in the von Trapp's lodge in Stowe, Vermont. Maria strikes me as a very honest, straightforward woman who had her own (very strong) way and ideas of doing things. By her own admission, she could be difficult. I guess when asked if she was as difficult at the Nonnberg Abbey as portrayed in the movie and stage play \"The Sound of Music,\" she replied that she was much worse. Even in her later years she wasn't afraid of trying new things. She took up skiing and horseback riding in her 40s, and had her first cross-country skiing venture when she was in her 60s. An enjoyable read, and fans of The Sound of Music should consider picking it up for the real story of the von Trapp family (while I will always enjoy the musical, it does take a LOT of \"artistic liberties\")\n\nAugust 25, 2018\n\n3.5-4.0 rating. Full disclosure: I have been an avid Sound of Music fan since the movie came out in 1965. After visiting the beautiful city of Salzburg this summer, I had to get this book as well as The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, both written by Maria Von Trapp.\n\nAlthough this book was written after the other one, I decided to read this first since it also covers her childhood. I’m glad I did. It’s only 200 pages and gives an overall account of her life, her personality and her beliefs. If you are a SOM fan, I recommend it (although it’s no longer in publication so need to find it online).\n\nAs soon as I finished this one, I started the other one because I feel they are a blend of one fascinating, true story!\n\nSeptember 17, 2007\n\nThis was interesting to read and gave a different perspective on the family saga from The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. Maria's crazitude comes out more, but you also start to see where she got it (look for the passage about her wedding night). The end is extremely religious in an odd way, as Maria becomes sort of a Pentecostal Catholic, and may be an uncomfortable read for some people.\n\nMay 10, 2010\n\nI just finished reading \"Maria: My Own Story\" by Maria von Trapp. What an amazing story of a wonderful, faith-filled, energetic woman. How wonderful to learn to ski in her 40s after breaking her back in a skiing accident, and then learning to ride in her 50s after one fall that broke all her ribs. She truly is an inspiration!\n\nJuly 7, 2009\n\nThis one was great--Maria is a far more interesting person then the movie would lead us to believe. She is funny and smart and daring and sweet. The family did more than just sing and create a farm in Vermont. They travelled extensively using their gifts and ideas to the fullest.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020\n\nIt is nice and an easy read. Maria's story is told in her own words and it is never boring. Euphemistically she tells about the worst parts of her life, such as her miserable youth and her departure from Austria with Georg and her whole family just before the start of World War II. Between the lines, she mentions that she was pregnant eight times, of which only three children were born. She savoured life as it came, with a strong belief, throughout. One may wonder why she never returned to Austria.\n\nMarch 21, 2016\n\nI'm sure I had seen the Sound of Music when I was a child, but I did not remember the storyline at all. Last week I went to see R&H show on Broadway and I loved it. I had to know more right away, so I immediately went into work and looked up books and found this one.\n\nI found it very difficult not to make a list of differences between this book, the play, and the movie. I had to remind myself this was the truth and not the media version. Mainly I found out plenty of interesting facts about a woman I knew nothing about, her family, and how they got to the United States (it doesn't appear to be the treacherous escape I imagined since she describes them hiking to the train station and just traveling all over Europe to sing - it seems no one was after them, it's just that they couldn't return to Austria once they left). Sometimes her tone was a bit condescending in talking about all the \"uncomfortableness\" she endured on her missionary work, especially in comparison to those she was actually visiting.\n\nThere are a bunch of interesting facts I wanted to share (I'm not sure if these are \"spoilers\", but be forewarned I'm going to list them below).\n\n1. Maria and Von Trapp were not in love (or, she didn't love him) - she thought she was just going to be a mother to his children. Love (and 3 children and 5 miscarriages) came afterwards.\n\n2. She was a missionary around the world, especially New Guinea where she met a cannibalistic tribe and asked one of the women what were the \"best\" parts (forearms, calves, and palms. The buttocks are tough and chewy and must be smoked).\n\n3. At times during her marriage she was a petulant and cross woman, throwing anything she could reach at her husband and screaming at him.\n\n4. She had lots of ups and downs with the Catholic church - seemingly leaving it for awhile and she'd come back after some sort of revelation.\n\n5. She caught Scarlet Fever after her babies had it, but it was misdiagnosed and caused a lot of kidney damage. She had 5 miscarriages in the years that followed.\n\n6. She was best friends with Bob Hope's wife and made frequent visits to the White House\n\n7. Well into her \"late middle age\" she broke her back skiing, then took up horseback riding and broke all 12 ribs\n\n8. The Sound of Music (Broadway) - her only issues with the show was the depiction of her husband. In real life he was not a dictator with his children. He did use a whistle, but for practical purposes and no one minded.\n\n9. The Sound of Music (Hollywood) - not consulted for the movie and told her life didn't matter, they just wanted the rights to the title. Not even invited to the premiere, and when she asked if she could go, they said there wasn't any room left.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nI love a good autobiography, and this one was one of the most enjoyable ones ever! To truly enjoy this book, one MUST be a bilingual. Preferably English and another language. Her struggles with learning English were so relatable to me!\n\nThis is not the story of the Trapp Family singers, but of Maria. She talks a little of their singing, but not a lot. I loved the little family bits, and the Austrian/German bits!\n\nMaria was relatable to me in many ways and truly enjoyed reading of her struggles in Austria and America and how she came through!\n\nI did not agree with the theology in this book, at all. She was catholic at the beginning, and then began to visit another church (the name of the denomination has escaped me for the moment) that believed in seeing things and revelations, etc. Of course, Maria is a staunch catholic believer, so is there a lot of mentions about religious things, praying to the saints, etc.\n\nMaria's relationship with her husband was so sweet, especially on his side. Georg was a darling, as were all the children. I feel sad that Maria was never able to see God's redemptive Grace, and was therefore never accepted to heaven, neither her, Georg or her children that have gone on. It is a pity that other religions so confuse people that they never see the truth right in front of them.\n\nMarch 19, 2014\n\nThis is Maria Von Trapp's autobiography before and after 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers' (better known as The Sound of Music). 'Maria' was an interesting book, confirming she truly was a handful for the nuns at Nonnberg Abbey. But it was also ... skimpy on certain details. Maria mentions she had a brain tumor and completely glosses over it, other than the mention of it. Was it removed? Never answered. Later on, she has heart issues and was 'seriously ill' to the point of 'having purple lips', but beyond getting an injection and some pills, nothing more is mentioned. She talks about meeting President Johnson and Queen Elizabeth. She shared more detail about hers and the \"childrens\" time as missionaries. This was an interesting book to read, esp. if you are interested in learning about Maria Von Trapp, as I am. But I think she could have added more meat, or substance to her autobiography.\n\nFebruary 16, 2010\n\nGrowing up I fell in love with the Sound of Music. The music, the dances, the characters, the story. As I grew older I realized that this was based on a true story. Now I read about the \"real\" Maria Von Trapp. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of the Von Trapp Family Singers but there is another book entirely on that, so I will have to look that up. This autobiography, rather, deals with an overview of Maria's entire life. Unfortunately her early life was only talked about briefly and the focus was primarily on her older, adult life. I enjoyed reading of family traditions, religion, work ethics, and her spirit for life and learning. I was surprised at how Hollywood did not even attempt to work with Maria when making the movie. Very interesting. In all it was fun to learn a little bit more about her and I do intend to read the other book.\n\nFebruary 9, 2010\n\nWe watched the Sound of Music the other week, so I decided to check out this one and The Trapp Family Singers (I am still working through it), just to see what was true in the movie. They are fun and move fairly quickly, though I just skim when it comes to the heavy Catholicism. It's hard not to like Maria and I enjoy these little portraits of her family life. The things that are the same and different from the movie are kind of suprising--I wouldn't have guessed that the Captain's special whistle and that the girlfriend taking Maria aside to tell her of the captain's love were true elements, and I was kind of devastated to learn that they simply took a train out of Austria. But, the real story has its own thrills.\n\nJune 29, 2010\n\nThis was a book Adam randomly picked up because I had mentioned I wanted a non-fiction/biography kind of book. I was hesitant to read it because I had already seen the Sound of Music and that was enough for me. But Maria von Trapp's story was actually really remarkable. She had struggles, it wasn't all fun and games after she married von Trapp. She had to be resourceful and keep the family together. She talks about her missionary work, spreading the gospel to remote parts of the world (I think she went to Guinea...) and the culture and people she met there. She was a lot more fascinating than I would have thought (how prejudiced of me, I know). I recommend this book.\n\nJanuary 25, 2008\n\nOne of my favorite things to look for in books is watching the characters learn and grow and change as a result of the circumstances that they encounter. That's my favorite part of \"Maria\" (aside from the fact that it's title is my name). Maria von Trapp tells her own story of growing up, becoming an atheist, finding God, becoming a nun, and marrying Captain von Trapp- but that's just the beginning of the story. Maria led a full and varied life and has a delightful way of relating stories and explaining how different circumstances brought her closer to God and taught her things.\n\nApril 28, 2010\n\nA very interesting read. It's always great to hear the true story behind fictionalized stories. Some of the true things I'd heard some of them I'd misheard, but this set it straight. I was surprised, though, although perhaps I shouldn't have been, that most of the book was about other times in her life. She has some good faith-inspiring stories, and some that are definitely Catholic and kind of curious.\n\nNovember 21, 2011\n\nReviewed with The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. Some interesting additional detail about Maria's childhood, conversion, repeated miscarriages (including one just after the death of the Captian), and big personality.\n\nJune 8, 2010\n\nAn interesting memoir, mostly about Maria's pre-convent and post-war days. I think the story we know from The Sound of Music was covered in another book, which I also read years ago.\n\nRead\n\nNovember 4, 2017\n\nIt was one of those books you don't put down. I finished in less than a week.\n\nJanuary 28, 2023\n\nI was thrilled to find a second hand copy of this book by Maria Von Trapp as the movie The Sound of Music has been a favourite of mine since I was a child. She tells of her childhood, entering the convent and subsequently being sent to look after the Von Trapp children then her marriage to the Captain. She tells this series of events rather quickly and refers the reader to her other book \"Stories of the Trapp Family Singers\" to find out more from that time of her life. The rest of this book mostly tells of her life after the Captain dies, her missionary journeys, touring with the children, establishing the Trapp Family lodge and then her gradual realization that she could have a personal relationship with her Heavenly Father. What a fascinating and eventful life indeed.\n\nJanuary 2, 2023\n\nmy husband and I spent a day in Stowe, Vermont and visited the von Trapp Lodge. I have always loved the story of Maria von Trapp and \"The Sound of Music.\" This memoir written by Maria teels her story after moving to the USA and settling into Stowe, Vermont. She sure had an adventurous spirit, liked to know people and different culture, enjoyed her family, and worked hard on creating a new life in USA.\n\nJanuary 5, 2023\n\nI would only read this if you are a fan of Maria’s. She is not a writer and the story is all over the place but I enjoyed learning more about her and now want to read the book that inspired the Sound Of Music.\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nMaria shares much of her life story in such a delightful way! Before and beyond the Sound of Music experiences, we get to know her in a more real way … some not surprising things and some very surprising things … I look forward to hearing her sing in Heaven to our Lord!\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\nI thoroughly enjoy reading Maria's books! Her writing is fun, humorous, honest, and wholesome, among other things. It's always fun to learn more about the von Trapp family!\n\nOctober 27, 2013\n\nThis was pretty interesting. I was expecting more of the \"Sound of Music\" story but it looks like I'll have to read one of her other books for that. This focused more on Maria's life before and after that time period. I enjoyed reading the story in her own words, though I did get a little bored towards the end when she focused on the pentacostal movement I was a confused by it, it seemed tacked on and in a different tone from the rest of the book... Also, If you're planning to read this and don't already know much about the Von Trapps, there is a spoiler ahead regarding Maria and the movie she inspired.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\n\nI was shocked and saddened to discover that Maria signed away all rights to her story and profited very little from the broadway musical and got nothing at all from the movies... and that she wasn't even invited to the Hollywood Premier of the movie musical. What is wrong with people? Everything was legal, though it was certainly unethical. You'd think the person who inspired the story itself would at least get invited to the movie premier. Good thing she wasn't a bitter person and seemed to take it in stride.\n\nSeptember 10, 2016\n\nThis is a very interesting woman. Today, her family would have been a reality show. Her story goes beyond the nun-governess-refugee who led an elite family over the Austrian mountains. She devotes chapters to the years before meeting the Captain--a surprisingly lonely childhood and a rebel of the Church. Later she gives us the story behind the house in Vermont, how it became a business, and, despite what most think, how it was constantly in the red. Her mission in New Guinea where the natives treat a full moon like we treat a sunny day. And, of course, she reflects on her persistent devotion to God. And if you are curious about her opinion and experiences with the production of the Sound of Music, you won't be disappointed. A fun, quick autobiography and something you can read to the kids if they want to know more about the character in the movie."
