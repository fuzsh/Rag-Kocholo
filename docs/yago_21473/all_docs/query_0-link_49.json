Maria was the stepmother and matriarch of the Austrian singing family, the Trapp Family Singers.

They began their career in Europe, but after Germany annexed Austria the family located to the United States and began touring the Us and Canada.\nIn 1976, the United Methodist Women at St. Johns United Methodist Church in Rock Hill, SC initiated a request to Maria von Trapp to see if she would be interested in visiting as a lecturer for a planned Arts festival held at St. Johns. She eventually agreed and arrived on April 11, 1978, had dinner with the Hornsby Family, gave her lecture, and stayed overnight at the Howard Johnson Motel in Rock Hill. She departed on April 12, 1978.\nThis collection consists of correspondence discussing the possible visit, a photocopy of a newspaper article concerning her visit, several receipts of her stay, and a brief biographical write-up of her and her visit.",
