        "text": "Rosmarie Trapp, the last surviving daughter of Georg and Maria Von Trapp, whose family inspired The Sound of Music, has died at her Vermont home at the age of 93, leaving just one of the couple's children still living.\n\nThe family of Rosmarie, who had no children and dropped the Von in her name after becoming a US citizen i n 1950, shared the news of the musician's death on Instagram on Sunday, saying the first child born to Georg and Maria, had 'passed away peacefully on Friday evening at the age of 93', saying 'she was in the presence of loved ones all day long.'\n\nThe statement continued, 'Her kindness, generosity, and colorful spirit were legendary, and she had a positive impact on countless lives', and published two photos of Rosmarie, including one of the singer riding a bicycle and wearing a bright blue anorak.\n\nThe Sound of Music, released in 1965, remains one of the world's best-loved films, telling the story of how Captain Georg Von Trapp, his ex-nun wife Maria and his seven children - born to his late wife Agathe - sing their way out of bankruptcy and escape Nazi-occupied Austria to start a new life in America.\n\nTrapp was born on February 8th 1929, just outside Salzburg in Austria. During her lifetime, Rosmarie, who became part of the Trapp Family Singers, admitted that she had a strained relationship with her 'difficult' and 'bossy' mother Maria, particularly after the death of her father Georg in 1947.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSaying she often felt forced to perform on stage, the late musician told the Sunday People six years ago: 'I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it. We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.'\n\nNearly 60 years after the film's release, there is now only one of Georg and Maria's children still living, 83-year-old Johannes, the couple's last born child.\n\nMany of the couple's children have suggested that the film wasn't entirely based on fact; while the Von Trapp family did flee their home in Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938, before performing together around the US, Hollywood clearly embellished in the Oscar-winning film, which saw Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews in the leading roles. The couple's oldest son, Rupert, for example was portrayed as Liesl, the film's nearly 17-year-old teenage girl.\n\nAfter arriving in the US, Georg and Maria bought the Trapp Family Lodge in 1950 - with the family becoming US citizens soon after.\n\nLast year, Johannes, who still lives in Vermont, told ITV daytime show This Morning that he can't 'remember a time when my family wasn't well known or famous.'\n\nThe family's love of music has passed down through the generations; four of the Captain and Maria's great-grandchildren - Sofi, Melanie, Amanda and August, now all in their twenties, have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together.\n\nHere, FEMAIL Looks at what happened to the Von Trapp family, and the actors who took on the roles of her seven half-siblings to tell their extraordinary story on the big screen.\n\nGEORG AND MARIA VON TRAPP\n\nThe family's story begins with Georg Ritter Von Trapp, born on April 4th, 1880, in what is now Zadar in Croatia, part of the then Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nThe son of a navy captain, Georg signed up to the Royal Naval Academy in Fiume to follow in his father's footsteps. At the age of 20, he fell for Agathe Whitehead and the pair wed before he went on to rise to the ranks of Lieutenant Commander during the First World War. His wife, Agathe, died in 1924 during the scarlet fever epidemic, leaving him to parent seven children alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Austrian Maria Kutschera was born in 1905 while travelling from her parents' village in Tyrol to a hospital in Vienna, Austria, on a train. By the time she was ten both of her parents had died and she was sent to live with a violent uncle.\n\nMaria escaped from him and in 1926 she was a schoolteacher at the Nonnberg Abbey, in Salzburg, intending to become a nun.\n\nHowever, while there she was asked to take a job as a governess at the home of a widowed Baron - Georg Von Trapp.\n\nThat man was Georg Von Trapp. They would quickly become married and have three more children, Johannes, Rosmarie and Eleonore, with Johannes, now 83, the only remaining Von Trapp sibling still alive.\n\nIt was not long before Maria founded a family choir. Although the children sang together before she joined them, they remember her particularly pushing public performances - especially after Georg lost his fortune.\n\nThe film was made after Broadway found a book detailing the family's adventurers. Maria later sold the rights to Hollywood for £3,000.\n\nHer story wasn't quite as idyllic as the film makes out though, Maria was said to be at times a difficult woman plagued by insecurities. The Sound of Music's director Robert Wise rebuffed her attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her.'\n\nRUPERT VON TRAPP\n\nThe first child of Georg and his first wife Agathe was born in 1911 and pursued a medical career alongside singing with his famous family. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Rupert was a qualified doctor.\n\nIn 1947 he married Henriette Lajoie and left the family's singing troupe, graduating from the University of Vermont the same year. He died in the family's adopted home state of Vermont in 1992 at the age of 80.\n\nAGATHE VON TRAPP\n\nAgathe Von Trapp was the oldest daughter of the Croatian-born naval captain and his first wife. Miss Von Trapp, 97, died at a hospice in Baltimore in 2010, after sharing five decades of her life with Mary Louis Kane. The companions ran a kindergarten together until 1993.\n\nMiss Von Trapp admired the movie, but felt it misrepresented her father as too strict, Miss Kane said. She added: ‘She cried when she first saw it because of the way they portrayed him.’\n\nMARIA FRANZISKA VON TRAPP\n\nMaria, the second-eldest daughter of Georg, was born in Zell am See, Salzburg, in 1914 and, of the seven siblings who inspired the film, she was the last to pass away, reaching 99 before she died at her home in Vermont.\n\nHer longevity wasn't expected. Family friend Marianne Dorfer said at the time of her death in 2014 that she was 'surprised' that Maria had been the last of the seven oldest children to survive because she had a weak heart, which indirectly led to The Sound of Music being born.\n\n'It was a surprise that she was the one in the family to live the longest because ever since she was a child she suffered from a weak heart,' she said.\n\n'It was the fact that she suffered from this that her father decided to hire Maria Von Trapp to teach her and her brothers and sisters.\n\n'That, of course, then led to one of the most remarkable musical partnerships of the last century.'\n\nMaria was last back in Salzburg in 2008 when she flew back to her family home for the first time since she fled Nazi-occupied Austria. The estate, which was confiscated by the Nazis during World War Two at the request of SS police chief Heinrich Himmler, has now been transformed into a hotel.\n\nWERNER VON TRAPP\n\nWerner was born in 1915, and renamed as Kurt in The Sound Of Music movie. Of all the Von Trapp siblings, his legacy has seen the family's music heritage live on via his grandchildren, who have their own musical group.\n\nWerner settled in Montana, with his grandchildren now living in Portland, Oregon. He died in 2007 aged 91.\n\nHis granddaughter Amanda said in 2014, 'Grandfather Werner was a very quiet man, and didn't tell many stories. He died in 2007, but long after he retired he'd come to our house to teach us Austrian yodelling songs and that inspired our love of music. But there was no pressure on us to carry on the family tradition.'\n\nHEDWIG VON TRAPP\n\nThe fourth child of Georg Von Trapp, Hedwig was born in 1917 and, in comparison to many of her nonagenarian siblings, lived a shorter life, dying in 1972 at the age of 55. After settling in Vermont, Hedwig later moved to Hawaii where she taught singing and crafts.\n\nJOHANNA VON TRAPP\n\nBorn just after the end of the First World War, Johanna Von Trapp was among the youngest of the seven siblings born to Agathe and Georg. She died on Christmas Day in 1994 in Vienna at the age of 75 after suffering a stroke.\n\nA keen painter, Johanna married Ernst Florian Winter, who was the first director of the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna, after the Second World War.\n\nThe couple went on to have four daughters and three sons, although one was stillborn. one of whom was stillborn.\n\nMARTINA VON TRAPP\n\nThe youngest child of Agathe and Georg, Martina was born in Klosterneuburg, Austria on 17 February, 1921 - her mother would die before her second birthday during the scarlet fever epidemic.\n\nTragedy also followed for Martina; she died at the age of just 30 in 1951, following complications during childbirth. Her daughter survived the birth.\n\nTHE THREE CHILDREN THE VON TRAPPS HAD TOGETHER: ROSMARIE, ELEONORE AND JOHANNES\n\nRosmarie, Eleonore and Johannes were all born to Georg and Maria, half-siblings to Georg and Agathe's seven children: Rupert, Agathe, Maria Franziska, Werner, Hedwig, Johanna and Martina.\n\nWhile they weren't portrayed in the film, they did go on to become part of the Trapp Family Singers, which toured the world and were lead by Maria.\n\nEleonore was the second daughter of the couple; she died on Oct 24th in 2021 in Vermont, at the age of 90.\n\nRosmarie, her older sister, was born in 1929 and died on Friday at the age of 93. She had dedicated her life to music but wasn't always receptive to her mother's dominating ways.\n\nShe called her mother 'difficult' - particularly after her father Georg died in 1947; and told the Sunday People six years ago: 'I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it. We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.'\n\nThe last surviving member of the Von Trapp family - the youngest of Georg's ten children is Johannes, born in 1939.\n\nThe Vermont native, who was born in Philadelphia, told ITV's This Morning last year that the film is 'far from a documentary' and that he has 'never known what it's like to not be famous' as he claimed fans of the film still visit their home to ask to see the children.\n\n'We were well known among a small group who knew the kind of music we did, but The Sound of Music just opened us up to the whole world.\n\n'All of a sudden people were coming to our small house in northern Vermont'."
