        "text": "National constitutions are the basis of our constitutional systems. The question is, however, whether each European constitutional system is the same or whether, on the contrary, they are all unique. The answer is twofold. Of course we might have the same values, the same principles, but we have unique characteristics and we have our own values as well. Each constitutional system has its own specific characteristics, based on the history of the constitutional community and the constitutional system itself. Reactions to certain events in history have shaped the constitutional community and the identity of the constitutional state. On this basis, it is possible to identify specific features that are specific to a given constitutional system, i.e. elements of its identity. At the same time, the constitutional system carries certain social and constitutional values which also define the system itself. We call these constitutional values, which could be different state by state, nation b...\n\nThe paper proposes a discussion on reconsidering the concepts of \"state\" and \"democracy\" from the systemic perspectives of dualism: cause and effect. It also encourages a systemic analysis of the state and dynamics of human society from the perspective of compliance with objective laws in the content of legal law, subjective, by its source: the state. Some of the laws of the gregarious biotic — centralism, temptation, and domination — and their differentiated application in the constitution and evolution of states are brought to attention. The author compares the types of states structured on the basis of extreme political, liberal and communist dogmas and the socio-economic effects of transposing political dogmas into legal norms, according to the principle of the dualism of systems. On the same basis, he concludes that all national and international conflict states are caused by the systemic antagonism between democracy and anti-democracy.\n\nThis chapter argues against the legal unified and essentialized concept of national constitutional identity which is frequently constructed by the scholars of European Law and Constitutional Law. Instead, a pluralist, deconstructivist and de-essentialized concept of national constitutional identity is advocated. Relying on interdisciplinarity, especially on critical historical studies, constructivist sociology and psychosociology, I understand national constitutional identity as a plurality of perpetually diverging and historically driven narratives constructed by particular social actors. Undertaking a special survey of Central and Eastern Europe, I shall highlight that the contemporary Hungarian national constitutional identity should not be equated with the illiberal identitarian narrative enshrined in the constitutional text and preached by the politicians in power, while the Romanian national constitutional identity should not be equated with the liberal-civic identitarian narrative which seems to be dominant nowadays. In Hungary, the national constitutional identity is also constituted by a liberal-civic narrative which directly challenges the illiberal one and tries to undermine its dominant-official character. In Romania, the dominant-official liberal-civic narrative is constantly and more subtle challenged by an illiberal ethnocentric narrative. The Hungarian open and harsh competition between the identitarian narratives is paradoxically much more benefiting than the Romanian apparent nonconflictual and unified identitarian narrative about the national constitutional identity.\n\nConstitutional law – nomos - entails two sets of social practices, including on the one hand, the agreement about principles, norms and procedures which guide and regulate politics, and, day-to-day interaction in the social, cultural, political, economic contexts of a community, on the other. Both constitute an expression of the universally derived yet particularly established set of institutions of a constitution. This paper argues that once constitutional norms are dealt with outside their sociocultural context of origin, a potentially conflictive situation emerges. The potential for conflict caused by this process lies in the decoupling of the two sets of social practices, i.e. the customary and the organizational. Through the transfer between contexts the meaning of norms becomes contested as differently socialized actors apply them and scholars of different legal tradition analyze them. The analytical challenge is to provide a methodological link between these practices. To that end, the chapter focuses on approaches to institutions. It proceeds in three steps. First three general political science approaches to institutions are distinguished. In a second step institutional analysis in the process of European integration is summarized based on three phases; first, integration through supranational institution-building, second, Europeanization through domestic institutional adaptation and third, late politicization as the complex process of sociocultural and legal institutional adaptation in vertical and horizontal dimension. The third step critically discusses the impact of institutions on political behavior. Two cases, citizenship and the finality debate, briefly illustrate the role of soft institutions in the process of constitutionalization.\n\nThe paper intends to present the adoption of two new and fundamental Acts in Hungary after the landslide victory of Fidesz in 2010. The legislators created a new Constitution and reshaped the electoral system – while the drafting processes were closed to opponent forces or citizens. We are going to demonstrate that this method lacks legitimacy and can threaten the democratic institutions, while the new electoral system is a turnaway from the values, which were laid down by the Roundtable Discussions in 1989: creating an electoral system in order to achieve stability and legitimacy. Through the critics we are going to analyze these Acts in order to understand the consequences of this one-sided legislation.

(ISBN:978-83-62907-91-5)\n\nThe problem of protecting the constitutional identity, in contents of modern constitutional developments, becomes a top discussed topic by lawyers. We share the opinion of scholars that the constitutional identity is the manifestation of the national and political identity of the society, which is reflected in the content of the Constitution. Having a millennium history, including a rich legal history, Armenia is probably one of the states that, according to geopolitical situations and historical circumstances has very often had to defend its national, including constitutional identity. The report presents specific historical examples. Nowadays Armenia is actively integrating into globalization processes: on the one hand we join the Eurasian Economic Union, on the other hand, conclude a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU. These circumstances are new challenges for our country. The report also highlights the importance of the role of the Constitutional Court..."
