        "text": "He was convinced that melody and rhythm express the structure of the human psyche and that melancholy and extreme passion are psychological twins. He found evidence for these theses in taverns between Sarajevo, Vranje and Skopje\n\nIn his native Croatia, at least 331 people would have to remember Vladimir Dvorniković. According to the 2011 census, there were so many Yugoslavs among the Croats. And in Severin's birthplace, on the Kupa River, which is also the border between Croatia and Slovenia, all XNUMX inhabitants could theoretically be proud not only of one of the castles of Frankopan, but also of their most learned child - the first of eleven children of Ljudevit Luja Dvorniković and his mother Marjana, born Kovačević, teacher.\n\nVladimir was born on July 28, 1888, exactly 130 years ago. The countries resulting from the breakup of Yugoslavia will most likely not mark this date especially in academic circles, although almost every little detail from national history in the newly composed interpretation is accompanied by national pathos and palanquin pomp, especially when a date is round.\n\nWhy is Dvorniković forgotten? The matter is simple. He was not only a Yugoslav by nationality. He spoke truths about the Yugoslavs that are among the most accurate and painful insights that an ethnopsychologist could come up with. Despite the ethnic pluralism and tribal diversity that Dvorniković was aware of in detail even in royal times, some of his findings have survived and resisted the vagaries of history, and are valid for the overall ethnic substance south of the Sava and the Danube to this day.\n\nIn ethno-nationalist narratives, the narcissism of small differences has prevailed for several decades. Dvorniković very early states precisely this dangerous similarity of Yugoslav ethnic groups - everyone thinks that they are very special and construct essential differences in relation to others, and consider obvious, essential similarities to be an unfortunate product of wicked history. After all, here is a record from 1925: \"We caressed ourselves, lied to ourselves - but before we could raise our heads, she rushed up and stood between us with her own head - Freedom! What now? What should we fuss about now, what should we dream about, who should we complain about - who should we hate? Well, each other! - that enemy of the 'thousand years' has been kicked out and bought his teeth at the door, and now we will settle the score!\" , each according to possibilities. Published in 1925 under the title \"The Psyche of Yugoslav Melancholy\", this essay can be considered the starting point for the extensive ethnopsychological study \"Characteristics of the Yugoslavs\", which was published in 1939.\n\nDvorniković was persecuted in Austria-Hungary as a pro-Yugoslav intellectual, but even in freedom he did not keep silent. He was looking for answers to the questions of why this harsh and sad man, this Yugoslav, is unable to overcome the shadows of his historical suffering. His first accurate insights happened in Bihać, where he was expelled in 1917 as a suspicious element. The Balkan dirge, set in a Sevdalian style, enables him to understand what is going on in the souls of our people: \"Only the one who had the opportunity to listen to the song of those neglected, despised, sooty mehans somewhere in Sarajevo, Vranje or Skopje will understand me here. With what song does that \"cruel\" Balkan man of ours \"cheer up\"! How \"angry\" he \"breaks\" his dert! Both Christian and Muslim and Catholic, everywhere and always one and the same, both monotonous and desperate to the point of boredom and forever all one song - from which one only needs to choke back a cry\".\n\nDvorniković is completely convinced that melody and rhythm most directly express the structure of the human psyche, and that melancholy and extreme passion are psychological twins. He found evidence for these theses while traveling along a line that he would later call the \"Sevdalian arc\" - from Bosnia through Southern Serbia to Northern Macedonia. \"The psyche of these Pokarin variants is basically the same: something accumulated, congealed, should be discarded; you need to get out of something, but the path is strange and exotic, psychologically enigmatic: release is sought by even deeper drowning and immersion, in - the sweetness of appeal and bitterness!\", he writes in his \"Characteristics of Yugoslavs\". Dvorniković is the first to make this paradoxical sediment in the Yugoslav soul, that \"unlived remnant that seeks expression\", somewhat comprehensible.\n\nA high school student from Zemun and Sarajevo, a Viennese student with a professorship in philosophy in Zagreb, he didn't know how to keep his mouth shut even in the newly founded country of the South Slavs. He believed that Yugoslavs are the correct name for the numerous varieties of the fragmented South Slavic area. He thought that only the Yugoslav nation could rise from the mud of ahistoricity and step onto the historical stage. But it never occurred to him to justify every hogwash that knew how to hide behind that idea. Already in 1926, he was summarily sent into forced retirement. He was again accepted into the civil service in the Ministry of Education of Serbia in 1933, but was expelled again in 1934. However, he lectured in Europe and did research in the Balkans.\n\nThe events that will follow in the Second World War confirm rather than refute his most radical findings about the Dinaric type of man. That man who sings passionately, who heals longing with sadness and sadness with pain, knew how to be unnecessarily cruel, fratricidally irrational, prone to cynicism and fatalism. He knew how to adopt advanced ideas only as much as he had to, to resemble a European gentleman: \"Many and many Yugoslav high intellectuals - who may make statements and write articles for the emancipation of women - in marital practice remained a racial-patriarchal husband-master or half-oriental\" , says Dvorniković.\n\nAnd although there is no Yugoslavia, and there are fewer and fewer committed Yugoslavs, even those who claim today that Yugoslavia was the biggest delusion of their people will not escape Dvorniković's judgment. Because according to Dvorniković, they are only a sub-variant of that delusion.\n\nVladimir Dvorniković also welcomed Tito's Yugoslavia. In it, he was a clerk in some absurd construction commissions, a high school teacher, and occasionally supported himself by selling watercolors. He died in 1956 in Belgrade. His works were not printed until the nineties.\n\nThat is the price of an independent opinion: for the royalists too liberal, for the communists a bourgeois reactionary, for today's official Croatia a delusional Yugoslav who is not even worth mentioning on the list of professors at the Faculty of Philosophy. I am fascinated by the fact that someone who was born in Kupa was able to penetrate to the end into the core of the Sevdalian-Dinaric Yugoslav, that he understood to the smallest detail all the joyous misfortune of a tragic area. I have read what he wrote, so I am sorry that he is not our contemporary. He would be a man with whom I would gladly have a drink and silently listen to \"Come on, come on\".\n\nOf course, whoever is angry with the Dvornikovićes could say anything to him posthumously. Well, me too, because I remembered him. Today at least it's easy, that's how the Internet sewer works. Dvorniković would also understand that: \"Swearing is a relaxation of the psychological and nervous current for a Yugoslav, like bloodletting for a thoroughbred.\"\n\nNews"
