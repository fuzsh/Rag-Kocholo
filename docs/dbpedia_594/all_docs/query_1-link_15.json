Planning and designing in the field of architectural heritage requires not only knowledge of contemporary building techniques, design processes and national and international guidelines, but also a deep understanding of architectural heritage, its evolution and genesis, the building techniques that have been applied, materials used, traditions, etc. In many cases, it is indispensable to perform a detailed building survey and building research to achieve an adequate design concept. The Department of History of Architecture and Building Archaeology of TU Wien has an extensive tradition of building research and over the course of the past 10 years, has developed a teaching workflow to introduce architectural students to building archaeology und surveying methods for building research. A sophisticated, temporally interwoven combination of courses and lectures on different topics related to building archaeology and surveying rapidly gives the architectural students the right tools for this important but often neglected task.\n\nTobin-Dodd, Fredrik. \"Erik Wetter and the genesis of the San Giovenale excavations.\" Opuscula.

This article examines the genesis of the project, and suggests that the early history of the project has sometimes been misrepresented. While the excavations came to serve as a training-ground for young Swedish archaeologists and made very important contributions to the study of ancient domestic architecture, these were not explicit goals at the conception of the project. The article also studies the peculiar role of Admiral Erik Wetter in the San Giovenale excavations. Despite not being an archaeologist himself, Wetter was both the instigator and, in many ways, the driving force behind the project. The result was an unusual and unclear leadership situation, something that in the long run created problems for the project.\n\nSzczerba, Adrianna. \"Urban archaeology in the activities of the Management of Research on the Beginnings of the Polish State (1949–1953).\" Materials and studies on archaeology of Sub-Carpathian and Volhynian area 23 (November 26, 2019): 379–87. http://dx.doi.org/10.33402/mdapv.2019-23-379-387.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Management of Research on the Beginnings of the Polish State was established to carry out extensive, interdisciplinary research on the genesis and functioning of the state of the first Piasts, which was undertaken in connection with the need to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the Polish state and its baptism. In 1949–1953, Early Medieval archaeological sites were examined in 31 cities. The most attention was devoted to strongholds with Piast records (Gdańsk, Gniezno, Giecz, Poznań, Kruszwica, Kalisz, Tum pod Łęczycą, Błonie, Bródno, Wrocław, Opole, Niemcza, Cieszyn, and Wiślica). Most of them are located in the medieval centres of modern cities. In this situation, the natural order of things was to link the problems of Early Medieval castles with the problems of the beginnings of Polish cities. Early Medieval sites in Poland, usually with a complicated stratigraphy, especially in the case of cities or strongholds, are the most difficult to excavate. Meanwhile, at that time only limited experience of excavation work at multi-layer sites prior to World War II was available – as a consequence, research methods for larger settlement complexes were developed on an ongoing basis, in the course of the research itself. Thus, the Millennium program has become a kind of testing ground in the field of urban archaeology in Poland. Key word: history of Polish archaeology, Management of Research on the Beginnings of the Polish State, millennium archaeology, urban archaeology.\n\nGoshgarli, G., and I.

Their work has revealed the process of transformation of temporary camps into permanent settlements, confirming ancient references to ca. 30 cities in Albania, and indicates the emergence of a new culture integrating native and Iranian elements in the late 1 st mill. B.C. -early 1 st mill. A.D. Mediaeval archaeology still focusses on urban settlements, but the number of sites and the scale of investigations have increased considerably. Main concerns have been the process and problems of urbanisation and the development of crafts, trade and architecture, however use of modern scientific methods studying the mass of excavated material is expected to throw light on the genesis of the mediaeval town, its social structure.and typology and the social aspects of its craft industries.\n\nPalavestra, Aleksandar, and Monika Milosavljević. \"Delo Jovana Cvijića i Vladimira Dvornikovića kroz prizmu srpske arheologije.\" Issues in Ethnology and Anthropology 10, no. 3 (February 28, 2016): 619. http://dx.doi.org/10.21301/eap.v10i3.4.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nFrom the point of view of the fact-oriented history of archaeology, there is no reason to consider the works of Jovan Cvijić and Vladimir Dvorniković. However, if we consider the history of ideas that have fundamentally determined the course of Serbian archaeology, it is relevant to examine the contributions of other disciplines and their key representatives. In the case of Serbian archaeology, the estimation of interdisciplinary transfers of ideas must be approached critically and with great caution, due to the deeply rooted tradition of not explicating the theoretical and methodological base of research. In other words, well into the 20th century, archaeologists have very rarely referred to authors from other fields of research, especially when dealing with general social phenomena. Serbian archaeology has tended to be a-theoretical, and the ideas of social development, social dynamics, or the rules of social behaviour have been considered as “implicit knowledge”, that need not be explained. However, these knowledges are counted upon, and are still considered as indubitable; there lies the power of “common points”, whose origins and genesis are very hard to discern. In this case study, the aim is to: 1) reconsider the link between the culture-historical archaeology in Serbia and cultural belts of Jovan Cvijić; and then to 2) attempt to understand the genealogy of the idea of continuity in Serbian archaeology. In other words, we shall challenge the apparently very logical supposition that our culture-historical archaeology has used the foundations laid by Jovan Cvijić, both in the case of cultural belts and of continuity. It will be demonstrated that archaeologists have skipped the lesson of Cvijić’s anthropo-geographical school of cultural circles, as well as his rejection of deep continuity in the Balkans. This means that the source of the archaeological idea of the elements of (material) culture that may be preserved from prehistory to the present, must be sought for in another direction, outside the work of Cvijić. One possible solution is to acknowledge the worlds of ideas of Milan Budimir and Veselin Čajkanović, along with very explicit ideas of continuity of less known Niko Županić and more prominent Vladimir Dvorniković, who modified and widely disseminated the ideas of Županić.\n\nStaley, David P. \"Shadow of Doubt or Doubtful Shadows: Small-Scale Low-Density Lithic Scatters and Agrifacts.\" North American Archaeologist 27, no. 2 (April 2006): 175–99. http://dx.doi.org/10.2190/m228-g714-1603-1kp6.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe fundamental identification of flaked stone as artifact is critical to all that follows in archaeology. The identification of sites, interpretations of prehistoric behaviors, adaptations, land use patterns, settlement and subsistence studies, etc. can be distilled to the initial determination of an artifact as being “real” or the result of natural or accidental phenomena such as plow damage. In cultural resource management, artifact identification drives immediate field decisions to modify research strategies and ultimately forms the argumentative basis for research potentials and determinations of significance. Chert flakes and shatter discovered during a NYSDOT sponsored project conducted by New York State Museum-Cultural Resource Survey Program were subjected to a battery of lithic attribute analyses in an attempt to identify artifacts in an agricultural area blanketed by natural chert. With the exception of exotic material types, no single attribute can certainly identify human involvement. A cumulative score of multiple attributes affords greater levels of confidence for cultural vs. natural determinations for larger assemblages. In settings with the “background noise” of natural chert in cultivated soils, cultural genesis determinations of single pieces and very small sparse assemblages must be recognized as hunches or faith-based decisions yet worthy of measured continued investigation.\n\nCoutinho, Alexandra, Mário Vicente, and Carina Schlebusch. \"DNA is the key to unlocking our ancient African past.\" Biochemist 42, no. 1 (January 31, 2020): 12–17. http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/bio04201012.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nEach region of the world, and the human groups living in them, have unique histories of migration, genetic mixing (admixture) and adaptation that have shaped their past. While archaeology has been of extreme value in elucidating this complex, multifaceted past, the genesis of DNA studies has enriched their story, and now ancient DNA (aDNA) has helped answer even more questions surrounding our prehistory. aDNA offers a unique opportunity to access genetic variation of past populations and enables us to contextualize past populations in present-day genetic variation. By linking the past to the present in this way, we now have a deeper understanding of our prehistory, and how our genetic landscape has changed from the past to the present. However, the study of aDNA is complex and there are various factors that need to be considered to yield successful aDNA results.\n\nScarre, Chris. \"EDITORIAL.\" Antiquity 90, no. 349 (February 2016): 1–8. http://dx.doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2016.2.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nIt is not often that Egyptology features in US presidential campaigns, but such was the case back in November when Republican candidate Ben Carson asserted that the pyramids of Egypt were built not for burials but as grain stores. He had held this view for some time, apparently ascertaining it from the biblical narrative that tells how Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, rose to be the pharaoh's right-hand man and built grain stores in the seven years of plenty to prepare for the seven lean years to follow (Genesis 41). Whether or not there is some historical truth behind that story, a leap of faith of an entirely different order is required to believe that the pyramids were the grain stores in question. Carson's theory has been widely—and quite properly—dismissed, and one could well ask, does it matter? But surely it must. Ignorance of the past among politicians, and the public at large, is not encouraging, and if they take so little notice of evidence from archaeology, will they do any better elsewhere?\n\nIsarin, R.

The maps cover the central part the Meuse valley, located in the province of Limburg between Mook in the north and Eijsden in the south. The area consists of fluvial and aeolian landforms of the Holocene Meuse floodplain and Younger Dryas aged terraces along it, spanning a period of approximately 15,000 years of landscape genesis and human habitation. The GKM more clearly discriminates between map units of Younger Dryas and early Holocene age than in previous mappings of the Meuse valley. The AVM series provide predictive information on the location of sites for four distinct consecutive archaeological periods and four main cultural themes. The maps contribute to a better understanding of landscape processes (fluvial and aeolian geomorphology and the impact of man on river behaviour), and the possibilities for human habitation and land use in prehistoric and historic times.\n\nGriffin, Christine M. \"The genesis and diagenesis of cave sediments at Creswell Crags.\" Thesis, University of Sheffield, 1989. http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.339897.\n\nFull text\n\nWest, Larry.

Stoops, “the aim of micropedology is to contribute to solving problems related to the genesis, classification and management of soils, including soil characterization in palaeopedology and archaeology. The interpretation of features observed in thin sections is the most important part of this type of research, based on an objective detailed analysis and description” (Stoops et al. 2018). To answer such questions, two major books contributed to the comparative knowledge necessary to tackle this objective: the first one was published in 1985 and used micromorphology to distinguish between different classes of soils (Douglas and Thompson 1985); the second one is an extensive guide of more than 1000 pages to the interpretation of micromorphological features encountered in thin sections of soil (Stoops et al. 2018). The aim of this Atlas is neither to be a substitution for these books nor a way to enter directly into the interpretation of soil genesis and classification. Nonetheless, this chapter presents the imprints of major soil processes that can be easily deduced from specific features observed in thin sections. These processes involve the dynamics of (a) clay, both translocation and swelling, (b) water, such as waterlogging, evaporation, and its role as ice and frost, (c) carbonate, gypsum, and iron oxyhydroxides, and finally (d) biogeochemical reactions within the solum.\n\nIrwin, Mike J., and Geraint F.

It takes the reader back to the genesis of anthropological method as well as the debates that have influenced attitudes toward indigenous knowledge and oral traditions over the last century. It critically examines the failure of “New Archaeology” to employ anthropological methods and proposes a complementary practice that does not eschew science but advocates a broader practice incorporating empirical evidence from those with deep experience with material cultures and landscapes. This chapter brings into focus how a richer interpretative posture occurs when we open our practice to the knowledge of others by employing the principles of apprenticeship and patience when working with communities. By putting into action the principle of epistemic humility, alternative views of the past open as do alternative ontologies that structure how the archaeological record is formed and heritage is performed."
