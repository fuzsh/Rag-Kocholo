At the same time, the scholarly endeavor to adapt Begriffsgeschichte to different geographic, cultural and national spaces should also take into consideration local, regional or national specificities. This should be the case because no place in Europe or the world can accommodate concepts whose original meanings remain unchanged. Thus, we should accompany Koselleck’s prolific ideas within the freedom to choose the most adequate methods and to apply them in a particular context, time, historical process or event.

Conceptual history contributes to acquiring knowledge about the semantics of concepts throughout their evolution in time. This innovative method of history elaborated for the German case by Reinhart Koselleck is also highly applicable to Romanian culture, since a significant number of the concepts employed in the latter stem from the nineteenth century, expressing ideals that are alien to our times. When examined in its relation to the process of language modernization, to social history and the history of political thought, conceptual history can contribute to the understanding and promotion of European values, and to the fostering, among Romania’s population, of mental reflexes consonant with those of the Western world. In the wake of two totalitarian regimes—which used their knowledge about the country’s past in favor of their extremist ideologies—rewriting Romanian history has become an imperative. Having been interested for a long time in such a project and being among its initiators in Central and South-Eastern Europe, we strongly believe that the Europeanization/Westernization of Romania is tied, among other things, to how history is read. A major change of the political regime—the passage from a monologuous-totalitarian discourse to a dialogical-democratic one— presupposes the renewal of languages, the acquisition of alternative cultural and political thought benchmarks, as well as a distancing from the behaviors and practices of previous eras. In September 2009, the West University of Timişoara hosted the first international conference dedicated to the history of the basic concepts of\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013. Central European University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\nRomanian socio-political languages. Honored by the participation of an impressive academic roster, including professors and researchers from universities in Germany, the U.S., France, Holland, Hungary and Romania, the conference immediately drew the attention of top-notch academic circles, both in Europe and worldwide. The present volume presents the proceedings of that conference. The contributors to the present volume are: Armin Heinen (Aachen), Klaus Bochmann (Leipzig), Keith Hitchins (Urbana & Champaign), Alexandre Escudier (Paris), Angela Harre (Frankfurt/Oder), Dietmar Müller (Leipzig), Hans-Christian Maner (Mainz), Wim van Meurs (Nijmegen), Edda Binder Iijima (Heidelberg), Balázs Trencsényi (Budapest), Ruxandra Demetrescu (Bucharest), Mirela-Luminiţa Murgescu, Bogdan Murgescu (Bucharest), and Victor Neumann (Timişoara). Although there are differences in terms of information processing, and Koselleck’s method cannot be found in all texts, it is important that the authors have focused on the history of Romania, advancing alternative viewpoints, and examining those angles that so far have been broadly neglected by Romanian historians. Using as a point of departure concrete historical moments, the contributors to this volume focus on key-concepts such as politics, political person, democracy, Europe, liberalism, constitution, property, progress, homeland, patriotism, neam (Romanian for kin), nation, national character, national specificity, education, totalitarianism, democracy, democratic, democratization, transition, censorship, manipulation, and freedom of expression. The authors aim to reveal specific aspects belonging to Romania’s past and present and to identify the languages that either preceded or succeeded Romania’s most relevant political events. They also offer alternative approaches to Romanian culture through the relationship between the elite and the masses thanks to novel reflections on issues that bring out the delayed and unfinished modernization processes within the Romanian society and state. The aim of this volume has been to articulate the results emerging from various sciences, such as history, linguistics, sociology, political sciences, law and philosophy, so that the past and present profiles of Romania are better understood by all those interested. Key-Concepts of Romanian History. Alternative Approaches to SocioPolitical Languages contributes to the study of Romanian history by the description and analysis of selected terms, notions, concepts and languages from legal, political, historiographical, literary and sociological texts. We have chosen to focus on such texts because they have been the major means through which people’s access to the ideas and messages\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013. Central European University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nthat have dominated Romanian political thought in modern and contemporary times has widened. The contextualization of the phenomena under analysis has facilitated the production of provocative working-hypotheses, new interpretations and conclusions. Recommendations for the resemanticization of a number of concepts—whenever the authors considered these as a welcome contribution to present-day communitarian-civic aspirations—constitute the pragmatic side of the studies. The general theory of conceptual history is combined with case studies so that the essays in this volume account for the high significance of a Romanian Begriffsgeschichte on one hand, and demonstrate how de-mythicization makes possible the objective understanding of the past on the other. Agreeing that Begriffsgeschichte has made a worldwide career thanks to the originality of Reinhart Koselleck’s oeuvre, the contributors to this volume have gone one step further by pointing out the specifics of former communist states from Central and South-Eastern Europe. In view of revealing the hidden political meanings of concepts, they realized that this region of Europe has been characterized by a different socio-political context; that its cultures and languages evolved differently in comparison to Western-European ones. The studies published in this volume highlight the unknown or mostly ideologized sides of modern Romanian politics. They accurately point out the ways Romanian national consciousness and the Romanian state were formed, the cultural and social gaps separating them from the West, as well as what has been done to the benefit of Romania’s Europeanization since 1859. In this sense, reference to the fundamental notions and concepts that have played a significant role in the formation of Romanian mainstream political thought has been paramount. The results presented in what follows do not claim to be conclusive: rather, they offer a credible image of Romanian modernity and promote openness towards an alternative academic approach, one which is both theoretical and practical, both multi- and interdisciplinary. Such a history is addressed to a reader interested in Romanian culture, politics, society and mentality, eager to acquire new information and learn more about the country’s national past. The publication of this volume has been made possible thanks to the excellent cooperation among all the contributors who have eagerly agreed to follow a common goal and employ a similar methodology. We leave it to the reader to decide on the extent of our project’s success or failure. We extend our thanks to the Volkswagen Foundation for the financial support in organizing the conference in Timişoara and for encouraging the publication of the present volume.

The Evolution of Socio-Political Concepts and Alternative Interpretations\n\nCopyright © 2013. Central European University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nVictor Neumann\n\nScholarly publications of the last few decades prove that worldwide historiography has diversified its research tools and opted for fundamental methodological changes as far as approaching the past is concerned. Thanks to conjoined efforts on the part of historians, linguists, and philosophers, history has been significantly enriched and has gained a respectable status in the hierarchy of humanist sciences. Historians have become particularly drawn to interrogations, problematizations, and innovatory explanations. Their aim is not simply to narrate facts, but to comprehend them, to thoroughly investigate them and to ultimately formulate judgments of value. In order to be credible and persuasive, historical enquiry has to critically examine sources, objectively reflect upon them, honestly focus upon historical contexts, and employ adequate concepts and languages. In this respect, an understanding of Romania’s history in a European context requires a selection of the basic concepts to be used. The study of these concepts reveals how languages and mental reflexes have been formed. Many fundamental concepts are controversial in the Romanian milieu and thus they incite numerous debates, mostly on political topics. I have considered that specialists, and especially those who are not initiated in this field, would need a comprehensive explanation of these concepts in order to accurately understand them. Some key-concepts—such as those we have selected and presented in this volume—are meant to open research in this area in light of acknowledging the evolution of their meanings during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They clarify socio-political phrases of the past, and justify the aim of providing a methodological update to contemporary Romanian historiography. This is the case, for instance, for the concepts of property, transition, Europe, politics, nation,\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\n2\n\nVictor Neumann\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Key Concepts of Romanian History. Alternative Approaches to SocioPolitical Languages is a first-hand contribution to the process of updating the research methodology to be employed in the social and humanist sciences in Romania. Following the content of the studies from this volume, I am confident that a Romanian conceptual history can contribute to the understanding of socio-political languages in their evolution since the beginning of the modern era, as well as to the formulation of a working hypothesis concerning linguistic transformation. The future projects of Romania are closely linked, on the one hand, to a new way of interpreting history in the sense promoted by Reinhart Koselleck—that is, following the future’s past (Vergangene Zukunft)—and on the other hand, to the need to re-negotiate the fundamental concepts so that Romanian socio-political phrases, and Romanian culture in general, can earn the chance of becoming convergent with the European scene. Ever since the Enlightenment, history has been a dynamic field of study not only in regards to the acquisition of information, but especially as a necessary scholarly endeavor serving the need to unveil and define human thought and action.1 In Reinhart Koselleck’s words: One cannot deduce the meaning of actual long-term practice which gradually changed from the documents proper. One needs to undertake a preliminary stage which is predominantly theoretical and terminological. What proves to be the case of a history of concepts refers one to a clearly delimited linguistic space and to an empirical practice only perceptible through the medium of language. This stands proof of innovatory impulses meant to sanction or initiate new experiences; however, these means do not yet fully justify the fact that this is history properly speaking.2 1\n\nStarting with the eighteenth century, the concept of history became distinct from that of literature, being associated with knowledge based upon research and science. More information on the evolution of the concept within modern socio-political languages can be found in Reinhart Koselleck, “Geschichte” in Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe, Vol. 2, 593717. 2 Koselleck, Begriffsgeschichten, 29: “[...] was sich andererseits Begriffsgeschichtlich aufweisen lässt—am uberlieferten Schriftgut—, das verweist uns zwar auf den sprachlich umgrenzten Erfahrungsraum und bezeugt innovative Vorstösse, die neue Erfahrungen registrieren oder initieren mochten, aber der Rückschluss auf eine tatsächliche Geschichte ist damit noch nicht zulläsig. Die Differenz zwischen Handeln und Reden, die wir für die sich vollziehende Geschichte aufgewiesen haben, sie verhindert auch im Blick zurück, dass die gesellschaftliche ‘Wirklichkeit’ jemals mit der Geschichte ihrer sprachlichen artikulation konvergiert.”\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n3\n\nCopyright © 2013. Central European University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nJust as man is prone to freedom and to choosing among several options, so the historian’s angle of reflection should always change. Using this observation as a point of departure, Hans-Georg Gadamer holds that language has an immense potential to indicate the determining factors of human behavior and self-assertion.3 Alongside language, it is history which evaluates the legacies of the past, invites to the contextualization of the duration of events, compares events and develops hypotheses in the hope of understanding what has already happened. Just as the concept of history “is not simply a fight over scientific methods, theories, and politics,” so the theory of history is not just ideology, even if it suits ideological critiques given the ambivalences included in its own analyses and judgments. The structure of thought in which an event of the past is framed becomes essential, and facilitates hierarchic differentiations, interpretations and conclusions. From hence derives the freedom to decode events and to write and rewrite a point of view. Not by chance, the latest generations of historians have been increasingly drawn to identifying markers of thought. Whether they refer to the slow transformation of society and economy during the long periods of history, as identified by Fernard Braudel, or to the discontinuities one can trace within socio-political languages, as Reinhart Koselleck noted, questioning individual and social structures of thought is essential to the historian’s work. Under the Sign of Prejudices and Naive Telling: The Case of Histories from Former Communist Countries Starting a discussion about the new look of worldwide historiography is worthwhile given that the study of the past in former communist countries is still dominated by ideological, political, and religious partisan views which are characterized by the use and abuse of descriptions abounding in ethnic, nationalist, fundamentalist prejudices and inventing at every step a “class” or “race” enemy. Such is, for instance, the case in dichotomies like Romanian/Hungarian, Romanian/Rroma, Orthodox/Greek-Catholic, Christian/Jewish, communist/anti-communist, rich/poor, and educated/ignorant, which are part of the Romanian historical discourse and prevent the understanding of the complex and convoluted regional and national histories within Romania. Given the modest or unconvincing knowledge of the 3\n\nH.G. Gadamer, “Historik und Sprache” in Koselleck, Zeitschichten, 119–27; cf. 126.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Talking about the history of a region by either ignoring culturallinguistic and religious diversities or by extrapolating differences prevents the recuperation and development of a commonly shared history. Especially when historical writing bears the imprint of a strongly-felt response to either the mainstream communities’ ethno-nationalism or the minorities’ fears to assimilate, historians are left with too little time to reflect on the similarities between human aspirations, the European origins of a local civilization, or the older and newer legal meanings of the concept of citizen. Instead of offering elaborate studies to the benefit of the rational understanding of traits of thoughts characteristic to a particular set of values, many historians are still committed to the analysis of origin-based specificities; they continue to evaluate the past in relation to archetypes, genealogies, demographics, contradictions and wars or in the name of complexes of inferiority or superiority. To give an example, social phenomena as well as multicultural and multi-civilizational strata from various periods of time are usually described in light of the same ethno-cultural ideology, thanks to which the theory of the ethno-nation has been uncovered and prolonged.4 Following this logic, historians only select those pieces of information that indicate a quasi-perfect cultural and religious continuity of the population. At other times, figures are meant to probe a demographic dynamics in accordance with the researcher’s own beliefs and prejudices. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to separate fiction from reality, to distinguish 4\n\nThe concept of interculturality, in the usage prescribed to it by many Romanian historians, sociologists, ethnographers and philologists, has an assimilationist meaning according to which cultural-linguistic minorities always benefit from the mainstream’s tolerance, interest and inter-civilizational exchange of values. Yet, most of the time researchers have completely insufficient (if non-existent) knowledge about the language and religion characterizing the communities they focus upon. This can be deduced from the documentary sources they cite, from the bibliography they employ, from the way they construct their interviews, as well as from the obsessive invocation of old and new statistics which have been carried out by the state to answer a political agenda or by the administrative forms that preceded it. Even if in many cases we commend the authors’ good intentions and their merit to have contributed to the familiarization of the Romanian reader to the histories and cultures of minority groups, given the absence of a method involving the clarification of concepts, their studies continue to be dominated by an ideological load which questions the credibility and utility of their endeavors in view of renewing the benchmarks of the thought of the majority.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Or, access to historical facts precisely depends upon drawing such distinctions.5 Temporal layers lead to different, if not opposed, meanings. In modern Europe, collective identity was redefined thanks to political changes or changed spheres of influence. In comparison to the previous historical times, society was structured differently in modern Europe, while languages and their messages also became different. The concept of political identity, as formulated in the Declaration of Human and Citizen Rights from 1789, gave center stage to each individual’s administrative and legal belonging. At least in theory, the concept did not refer to legal, religious or community-based differences among the people or groups of people within a state. Following many controversies that occurred during the process of emancipation and in the aftermath of its re-semanticization by legal culture, the concept hindered the construction and labeling of an individual on the basis of fortune, name, faith, language, or cultural orientation. Consequently, both political thought and democracy became richer. Therefore, the states of Western Europe— especially Great Britain and Switzerland—have for long implemented the co-habitation of several cultural-religious groups. With the passage of time, the concept of citizenship in these regions has been increasingly associated with numerous normative aspects which have helped these states become productive in view of socio-political stability. In Central and South-Eastern Europe, the concept of citizen has had a much lower profile; the region’s cultures and their communitarian ideological offshoots (which were largely determined by post-World War I AngloAmerican and French policies) imposed ethnicity as the determining factor in the definition of a person’s identity. As a result, it was ethnicity that determined the individual’s status and rights in the public life of the state.6 This might seem natural if we remember that the rural and not the urban milieu inspired socio-political languages in the above-mentioned region. What was the result? Twentieth-century psychology and discriminatory politics continued to extrapolate one’s historical rights, abusively employing the concepts of ethnicity and ethno-nation. In light of this, since the topic of the day is that of the exclusion of such minorities as the Rroma, historiography urgently needs to make significant reappraisals. 5\n\nKoselleck, Futures Past, 257–58. In this sense, see a complex analysis of Koselleck’s theory of history in Hoffmann, “Koselleck, Arendt,” 212–36, particularly 215. 6 Neumann, “The Concept of Nation in the Romanian Culture,” 153–77.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The literature resulting from the study of a different universe and based upon another life experience, such as that of Will Kymlicka, requires not only the need to draw a correct inventory of its notions and hypotheses, but also the necessity to conduct a critical-rational examination of it if one intends to transfer theories generated in a different socio-cultural and political context to a new location (for example Romania).8 Regardless of the evident progress and recent political affiliations forged by states from Central and South-Eastern Europe within the European Union, we have to heed the facts. The slightly utopian estimations and the good intentions of some frontline scholars of international historiography regarding the process of the East’s integration into the EU, such as those of Maria Todorova, cannot hope to sustain a different truth.9 So much more cautious must be the steps historians take to conceptualize multiculturalism, given that citizenship did not make a career in Central and South-Eastern Europe since in most cases national consciousness was forged in the absence of civism.10 That is why, for the time being, a discussion about the liberal sense of the concept of citizen is irrelevant. These are reasons for which historians must admit that in the study of history it is essential to distinguish between reality and imagination.\n\n7\n\nSee Salát, Multiculturalismul liberal, 305. Ibid. This happens even if the author is a scholar deeply involved with the multicultural phenomenon. At the same time, Western scholars themselves sometimes fail to focus upon those aspects that can define the specifics of the Central and South-Eastern European humanity. 9 Todorova, “Zukunft der Zivilgesellschaft in Europa,” roundtable bearing the same title, chaired by Maria Todorova, Warsaw University, organized in collaboration with the Volkswagen Foundation, 18 June 2010. 10 See Müller, Staatsbürger auf Widerruf. 8\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n7\n\nCopyright © 2013.

In Western cultures, medieval identity traits—structured by tribal marks— disappeared or were reconfigured as soon as the cosmopolitan ideas of the Enlightenment multiplied. New identity meanings were born out of old humanist creations due to the process of state reformation and its delimitation from Churches and the legislation and administration of previous centuries. Scientific development, geographic discoveries and technical progress fostered an alternative type of thought and a new way of being which did not exclude religious faith but stimulated instead freedom of conscience. Koselleck associated Enlightenment philosophy with masonic lodges in which “secret freedom became the secret of freedom” as a consequence of the norms of dialogue. Citing Kritik und Krise,11 an exegete of Koselleck’s oeuvre held that the above assertion refers to the separation of political authority from moral authority which occurred around the French Revolution. He also claimed that masonic lodges epitomized moral critique in social locations beyond the stately body, and “dangerously dissociated themselves from the specific field of politics,” leading to the generalized crisis at the end of the eighteenth century.12 In the context of social emancipation, the Freemasons’ aspirations must be understood differently. This organization represented the main heir to and transmitter of Antiquity and Renaissance spiritual revelations. At the same time, it stimulated and protected intellectual creations, formulated the time’s main questions, and hence contributed to the genesis of a critical-rational type of thought based upon sciences and the idea of emancipation from medieval servitudes. Not only did Freemasonry refuse to dissociate itself from politics; its movements essentially contributed to the development of science and political philosophy. The very concept of Freemasonry is fabulous, even though it is true that it points to a complicated issue which is often absent from humanist studies of transitions to modernity. Examining the vocabulary that assimilates such a concept and thereby explains the meanings of languages will be able to shed light upon the ideals held by intellectuals who were part of secret societies, as well as upon the confusion that took hold of the individual once these ideals were contradicted by the collectivist ideology which could be primarily defined by histori11 12\n\nCf.

I consider that decoding the concepts which have made possible the definition of collective identity by exclusion in societies and states such as Romania, is more than a topic that should be circumscribed to a specific locale. I see it as a part of European conceptual history on whose margins both Romanian and Western historians should reflect. In addition, the transnational approach to identities in the states of Central and South-Eastern Europe is a postmodern working method which enriches Reinhart Koselleck’s findings and contributes to a more complex theorization of the history of Europe. In this way, we will perhaps manage to identify Europe’s commonly shared identity politics so that the European Union will be able to find the pragmatic ideas and solutions necessary to bring to life the supra-state construction of the future. Even if the region in which Romanian-language culture and the Romanian state have been structured does not always share similarities with the West, the present-day historian will have to make an effort and present the past that occurred during the above-mentioned process of modern becoming with the help of universal scientific tools. The renewal of thought is ever more important, since obstacles to the analysis and objective narration of the past come from the side of political parties and economic organizations which have constructed their myths of superiority via references to the unreformed values of the past. Koselleck believes that at certain times educated milieus affirmed themselves by means of the exclusivist ideology specific to patriotism: “The barriers that used to be raised in the past out of patriotic feeling and in the name of patriotism, behind which units of political action or economic organizations constructed the myth of their own superiority and innocence, are redefined on another scale but they are not eliminated. The hereditary exclusivism of patriotism is omnipresent, multiplying itself in the various forms of patriotism.”15 This precise aspect 13\n\nMore details on the process of adopting and understanding the meanings of the Freemasons’ new languages in the Ages of Enlightenment and state formation can be found in Neumann, “Francmasoneria speculativă în Europa luminilor”, Orizont, no. 5, 2010: 22–3. 14 Neumann, Neam, Popor sau Naţiune?, Neumann, Essays on Romanian Intellectual History. 15 Koselleck, Begriffsgeschichten, 239: “Die ehedem patriotisch legitimierten oder als nationalistisch definierten Sperren, hinter denen sich die politischen Handlungseinheiten oder ökonomische Verbände ihrer eigenen Überlegenheit—oder gar ihrer Unschuld—\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

There have been successive generations of historians who have related Romania’s past to either their life experiences alone or to romantic stories. They have merely managed to promote a naïve or sentimental narration of the documents’ contents. Quite a few examples prove that, under the pretext of teaching the facts of the recent past, the written history from former communist countries often sanctions the obsessions of the authors and their intellectual milieus, or they record the society’s state of mind when confronted with the fluidity of intellectual, political and economic ideas. Such attitudes can be easier understood if we consider that over five hundred book titles have been published in reference to the events of 1989. With few exceptions, they pretend to be “true histories” of the events. Starting from oral testimonies and, to a lesser degree, if at all, from written sources, these publications present the most strained moments marking the end of 1989. The same “histories” are interested in communism and in how the totalitarian state led by Nicolae Ceauşescu came to an end. They vaguely discuss the causes or the socio-economic and political aspects that generated people’s discontent, favoring instead a post factum anti-communist dispute. They invoke Romanians’ loose adherence to the communist regime by invoking traditions without explaining, however, the genesis and constant presence of conservative or anti-modernist ideologies in Romanian intellectual-political milieus ever since the nineteenth century. They do not discuss the absence of civism and of a minimal political culture on the part of the great mass of the population. Instead they enumerate the external factors that contributed to the establishment and conservation of communist totalitarianism for five decades. Furthermore, they do not consider the domestic social context which favored a dependence on the power structure, namely the absence of ideals concerning citizens’ individual freedom; they do not investigate the small number of co-habitation norms or the predisposition of a majority of the population to cooperate with totalitarian regimes, just as they fail to notice the consequences of cultivating discrepancies between the elites and the masses. They are hardly aware of the meaning of a Ceauşescu-drawn protochronism which versicherten, werden umbenannt und in anderen Grössenordnungen neu errichtet, mitnichten beseitigt. Die einander ausschliessenden Erbteile des Patriotismus, pluaralisiert in zahllosen patriotismen, sind weltumspannend allgegenwärtig.”\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

They do not tackle this essential aspect; nor are they prone to remark, by contrast, the anti-communist and anti-totalitarian opposition from Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia which started to draw the contours of an alternative type of political thought from the 1950s and 1960s onwards.17 With only a few exceptions, the hundreds of Romanian studies on the year 1989 merely pay tribute to the authors’ fantasies and have not received the necessary correction on the part of scientific historiography, whose representatives have been late in redefining their stand.18 The same absence of a necessary correction also characterizes a significant number of historical studies describing the centuries of early modernity. They should have been far more independent of the identity-political constraints of the present. In fact, we hope that historians will soon and more accurately understand that at present there are new, different topics and novel criteria of selecting them, that there are new and different interpretations of various eras, novel reflections on the anthropological conditions of a human being’s acts, as well as different tools in point of the historian’s languages and methods of scientific critique. I would also add that in the case of most studies of the type mentioned above, there is a lack of any rigorous demonstration and an absence of any attempt to decode or re-semanticize important concepts such as revolution, progress, property, neam (Romanian for kin), state, nation, specificity, legionarism, fascism, communism, totalitarianism, and transition.19 16\n\nSee Balázs Trencsényi’s study in this volume, “The Conceptualization of National Character in the Romanian Intellectual Tradition.” 17 Neumann, “National Political Cultures and Regime Changes,” 228–47. 18 On the importance to redefine one’s stand, see Neumann, “Istoria conceptuală şi deconstrucţia limbajelor social-politice,” 179–91. 19 The most striking examples of reader manipulation can be found in the works of Alex Mihai Stoenescu who takes advantage of the audience’s low level of knowledge, the small number of existent historical-critical analyses, and the commercial appetite of certain publishing houses. See A. M. Stoenescu, Istoria loviturilor de stat în România, vol. 4, Revoluţia din decembrie 1989 – o tragedie românească, see Bogdan Murgescu’s review of Revoluţia Română din 1989, 205–12.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n11\n\nConsequently, studies that should offer a critical-rational approach usually abound in unnecessary details and give rise to quite a few confusions. Consider only one definition of the concept of revolution by a strongly marketed author in post-Ceauşescu Romania, whose books have benefited from very large circulation figures and nation-wide distribution:\n\nCopyright © 2013. Central European University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nA reform occurs the moment when, despite his entire divine legitimacy, the blood heir of a noble title accepts to no longer be the privileged intermediary between God and the people; once he is further replaced in this position by any trained (initiated) citizen, we have a revolution. More precisely: this moment represents the very core of a revolution, its imperceptible and exclusively ideatic beginning.20\n\nHence follows a theory of conspiracy, according to which the revolution would be the product of trained/initiated individuals who by occult means take over from the nobility the new role of master. In his preliminary considerations on the history of the concept of revolution, Koselleck notes that in its present-day use and meaning, the concept is inspired by the senses attributed to it by the French Revolution.21 First of all, “[the concept] refers to people’s anxieties expressed through a revolt that associates itself with violence and can turn into a civil war.” Secondly, it identifies “the change of the constitution,” “a transformation of structure which goes from the past towards the future,” in which case its meaning is that of permanent change.22 Finally, in close connection to politics, “it suggests violence, refers to the whole society, and can contain numerous fields, such as industry, science, culture.”23 This is a complex concept which describes a sudden short-term or long-term political change and which presupposes a particular social context. “The historical context clarifies the political aim and, reversely, the political aim opens up the historical dimension. Additionally, the concept refers to both a leader and a counselor for action. It is this particular feature which constitutes its modernity.”24 In light of this, it becomes obvious why the above-mentioned quote by Romanian author Alex Mihai Stoenescu deserves further clarification. Alongside the universally valid meanings of the concept of revolution, 20\n\nStoenescu, Istoria loviturilor, 376. Koselleck, “Revolution. Rebellion, Aufruhr, Bürgerkrieg,” in Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe, vol. 5, 653–788. 22 Ibid., 653. 23 Ibid. 24 Ibid. 21\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

All rights reserved.\n\n12\n\nVictor Neumann\n\none also needs to take into consideration the specifics of language and culture so that the historian’s judgment of value will be based on an implicit knowledge of the social status, the type of a state’s administrative organization and the level of political awareness characterizing the event under analysis. Our example does not refer to either the universal meaning of the concept or to a serious evaluation of its national signification. Instead, the author’s evaluation is limited by the invocation of political unrest, which could at best suggest that the 1989 revolution has not yet finished. Why is it that the meaning of the concept plays a role in defining what happened? I return to Koselleck, since he relevantly drew attention to the fact that “each revolution which has violently changed power relations has led to the establishment of new power relations. Albeit legitimacy may be new and legal powers different, even better, what does not change at all is the top-bottom character of relations; finally, there is simply a return to forms of dependency that are legally reorganized and regulated.”25 The vague definition of the concept of revolution has prevented not only a well-balanced evaluation of the events from our recent past, but also of those from 1784 (Horea’s uprising), 1821 (Tudor Vladimirescu’s revolt), 1848 (the 1848 revolt/revolutionary movement/civil war), 1907 (the great peasant revolt from Romania’s Old Kingdom), 1944 (liberation from Ion Antonescu’s fascist dictatorship), etc. In investigating these periods, the use of a mere approximate semantics of the same concepts has delayed the possibility to decode the reasons behind Romania’s countless processes of transition towards modernity. The wide array of meanings given by Romanian historiography to this concept—as well as to those invoked above, which are closely related to this particular one—indicates, for the time being, the indifference of most historians to using rigorous methods and the theoretical comprehension of events. Hence springs the slow pace characterizing the progress of knowledge for humanist disciplines which have been confiscated by politics or trending ideologies. In this respect, a particularly relevant observation by Bogdan Murgescu in25\n\nKoselleck, Zeitschichten, 109: “Jede Revolution, die aufgewaltsame Weise Gewaltverhältnisse geändert hat, führt zur Etablierung neuer Gewaltverhältnisse. Die Legitimation mag neu sein, die Rechtsverhältnisse mögen andere, vielleicht sogar bessere geworden sein, an der Wiederkehr von neu organisierten und rechtlich geregelten Abhängigkeits formen, an der Oben-Unten-Relation selber ist deshalb noch nie etwas geändet worden. Selbst eine Vereinbarung unter Gleichen setzt politische Gewalt ein, um die Relationen zu stabilisieren.” Also see Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann’s pertinent observations and comments in “Koselleck, Arendt…,” 221.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n13\n\nvites a much-needed reflection on the margin of writings such as those I have already mentioned: The author’s [Alex Mihai Stoenescu’s] descriptive talent and efforts towards documentation are undermined by the high degree of freedom he takes upon himself as to the rigors of scientific research and the devotion towards holding preestablished theses no matter what. […] Consequently, Stoenescu’s book fails to become a reference book of history and remains an exemplary sample of ideological discourse about the revolution.26\n\nSuch types of writings actually reveal a truth about a significant part of Romanian historiography which is worth mentioning: its tendency to continue endorsing a romantic view of Romanian history, an approach which is opposed to critical analysis, methodological renewal, and conceptual progress, and which is not willing to tear itself away from past structures of thought and promote, instead, Western norms.\n\nCopyright © 2013.

If so, how can one explain the tragedies that have occurred in that region? Is it necessary to comparatively assess the number of victims in view of a better understanding of history? Are the regions of the East more prone to totalitarian regimes than those of the West? In that case, how should one interpret Western influences on the East of Europe, or, more precisely, what are the cultural and identity similarities and differences between the two zones of the continent? Is it right to rewrite the modern history of Europe from the perspective of the atrocities that were perpetrated in the middle of the twentieth century? Such questions about the past persist in many people’s minds. Even if there is a high degree of curiosity for the recent past in each of the former communist countries—where historians, politicians and journalists have collected archival information, published journals, collections of documents, essays, and monographs, and have institutionalized their activities—, the political class does not seem to be convinced of the importance of having lively debates on serious political errors. Historians still depend upon either archival documents or prejudices influencing their research. It should be so because any totalitarian system is interested, on the one 26\n\nMurgescu, Revoluţia Română din 1989, 212.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Under these circumstances, reality may develop its own partisanships, opposing power and the lack of power, the new and the old, progress and regress, political language and scientific language. According to François Furet, it is imperative to distinguish between traditional history and history remodeled by social sciences. Using as an example the study of the 1789 French Revolution, he shows that narrative history substitutes the social meaning of an event by the political one and fetishizes documents.27 In his critical analysis of Richard Cobb’s oeuvre, Furet notes that the presentation of history on aesthetic or moral grounds limits the number of possible themes to be considered and is detrimental to the very wit of history. The idea according to which the historian restitutes the past starting from the documents is an absurd ambition or, at best, it proves the author’s literary talent thanks to which he sensibly rewrites the content of the sources. However, documents are not always credible; they do not always warrant an accurate description of the past. In this sense, Koselleck warned about the importance of selection, fully aware that even though documents can probe new experiences, they do not always represent a “serious index of history properly speaking.”28 If we choose to renew the discourse about the past in former communist countries and remodel it through the study of language, concepts, ideas and society, we have the chance to develop a science which will distance itself from the obtuse ideologies that stimulated the imagination of dictators and their totalitarian regimes. The study of concepts is a method whereby we not only decode the social and political functions of language, but through which we make the historical evolution of society our object of reflection. Changes also depend on the historian’s chutzpah to question national histories so that, jointly with the reader, he can be able to decode simplifying myths and overcome the tyranny of the past. The studies in this volume invite to such a scholarly endeavor, their aim being to rewrite Romanian history and to intellectually reconstruct the citizen by foregrounding the benefits of scientific-rational thought. 27 28\n\nFuret, L’atelier de l’histoire, 30. Koselleck, Begriffsgeschichten, 29: “Und was sich andererseits begriffsgeschichtlich aufweisen läßt—am überlieferten Schriftgut—, das verweist uns zwar auf den sprachlich umgrenzten Erfahrungsraum und bezeugt innovative Vorstöße, die neue Erfahrungen registrieren oder initiieren mochten, aber der Rückschluß auf eine tatsächliche Geschichte ist damit noch nicht zulässig.”\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n15\n\nCopyright © 2013. Central European University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nWhy an Alternative History? In the collective imaginary, the notions/concepts which sustain marginalization or exclusion have hardly changed, if at all. Real events are not considered of interest as long as they lack an ideological engagement; hence result dangerous interpretive distortions, half-truths presented as definitive verdicts, and ultimately the falsification of history. The example of dogmatic controversies over alternative school textbooks of Romanian history points to radically conservative options. This is due to school curricula, an old-fashioned educational system, as well as to cultural and political elites who have preferred to prolong old structures of thought in postcommunist times rather than make authentic reforms, using the old cultural-identity paradigm instead of alternative languages, and “forms without substance” instead of European pragmatism. How else could we see things when ministries of education promote university curricula and recommend bibliographies filled with out-of-date information and theories, with notions and concepts with nineteenthcentury meanings, or when they define collective/political identity by conjoining the ethnic with the national? How could we label sociopolitical languages which ignore the fundamental concepts of democracy such as decentralization and local and regional autonomy? How could we assess the contradictions surrounding the process of Romania’s European integration when we notice that the meanings of the concept of Europe (as they are acknowledged by Western cultures) are so much distorted that neither schools nor the media can correct their false connotations?29 A national history which claims to know how to orient its own citizens is expected to also know how to connect local/regional themes with European and universal ones. One also expects such a history to be animated by the desire to go beyond a binary-type of thought which uses parallel histories and conflicting ideologies. That is why the new understanding of history— the one which results from rewriting it on the grounds of scientific accumulation and the intellectual might of the contemporary world—will be made 29\n\nThe structure of thought in which a past event is framed becomes paramount; on its basis, one can create hierarchies, offer interpretations and conclusions. The freedom to decode an event and formulate a point of view is due to the very structure of thought. The most recent generations of historians have been drawn to identifying the intellectual benchmarks in the formation of thought. Whether we refer to the slow transformation of society and economy during the long eras of history—as Fernard Braudel believed—or to the discontinuities that constitute socio-political languages—as identified by Reinhart Koselleck—it is essential for the historian’s work to question structures of thought.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Social polarizations and the will to relocate the rapports among various culturallinguistic and religious groups asks for a reconstruction of languages and the acquisition of a sensus communis, a commonly shared meaning useful in view of social, multicultural and multi-religious co-habitation. In this sense, the episode in which the mayor of the seacoast city of Constanţa wears a Nazi officer uniform and marches like SS troops for a fashion show either indicates the absence of a minimum of culturalhistorical and doctrinarian benchmarks, or a voluntary contamination with extreme ideologies. Either way, this case involves a politician’s lack of responsibility before his electors, as well as his instinctual desire to hold the reins of power in the simple Nazi-like way.30 “At best imaginable in the palace of some African dictator,” the above-mentioned slippage was quickly criticized by the Western press. When discussing twentiethcentury totalitarianisms,31 we should keep in mind that Central and SouthEast European experiences have been and continue to be different in comparison to those from Western Europe. The short-lived tradition of democracy in the East of Europe, and its often debatable results, can be explained by the ignorance of the masses, the continuity of the romantic idea of the nation and the ethno-national state,32 and the replacement of the politics of social integration with a discriminatory attitude, with reflexes of intolerance to any difference. In order to understand the above observation, it is worthwhile noting that some Romanian press makers have returned to chauvinist, antiSemitic and racist messages drawn upon a legionary orientation. Some widely mediatized journalists often write or talk in a fascist manner, resuming the ideology of the most popular segment of interwar Romanian elites. Thus, in his article “România cu lanţul de gât” (“Neck-Noosed Romania”), a well-known news presenter from the ProTV and Antena 2 television stations reflects as follows on the national question and a possible way out: 30\n\nSee Armin Heinen’s study in this volume, “Images of Europe – Images of Romania (1945/1948–2008).” Heinen therein identifies several stages characterizing the rapprochement and distancing between Romania and Europe in the post-World War II era, and he proposes the analysis of three dimensions, “the political sphere, intellectuals’ reactions and the anchoring of everyday history to a symbolical geography.” 31 T.

A value-dumping place], România Liberă, 27 July 2009. 32 See Neumann’s study in this volume, “The Concept of Totalitarianism in Romanian Socio-Political Languages.”\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n17\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Demographic figures have suddenly changed, like a storm coming out of the blue. We are under occupation albeit no army is in sight. We are colonized by a quarrelsome and callous population which has arrived here from no steppe and has been brought here by no plane.

Those people who were giving orders to the police prepared their final strike before getting hold of official power, after having already taken over symbolic power: we listen to their music, we remold our benchmarks following their values, and we are run over by their cars. Far away, the European Union and trending political correctness teach us to be thankful and wipe our mouth. We used to be a nation, now we are becoming an amalgam of tribes.33\n\nIs this manner of seeing the Romanian social scene the result of family-run or school-run education? Does it signal the return to extremist ideas? Does it involve the journalist’s old attachment to metaphors likely to generate trivial languages and no actual knowledge of the meaning of terms and, hence, a serious error in interpretation? To what kind of democratic values can such a propaganda-oriented society aspire? This is a very serious issue once we understand that the article’s message refers to an invented enemy, to the theory of the scapegoat. According to the author, the nation belongs to the elites, not to the state’s citizens; it belongs to writers who have gained renown, not to the various social classes. The absence of criteria defining the collective, administrative-political identity is as dangerous as the lack of an individual consciousness. Facts are distorted, as transpires from the fact that the above-quoted author is an adept of an aberrational social polarization which is quasiidentical with the one of Romania’s Old Kingdom around 1900. In addition, he draws inspiration from the continuous (open or hidden) conflict between the elites and the masses, between the mainstream and the minorities, between the educated (“the smart ones”) and the less educated (“the stupid ones”). Messages from the article “România cu lanţul de gât” prove their allegiance to the 1930–1940 legionary orientation. This is yet another reason why we have to acknowledge the importance of the re-semanticization of notions and concepts in agreement with those val33\n\nMândruţă, “România cu lanţul de gât,” 4 September 2008.

This endeavor may offer an opportunity to stop blaming political correctness when the debate is centered upon a society which has not yet stated its own existential norms. In what regards to history as a fundamental cultural benchmark for the formation of the individual, it must leave behind the uneven path carved by ambiguous notions overcharged with deeply partisan messages, such as fate, genius, eternity, a people of masters, national self-determination, Satan, historia magistra vitae, history as divine providence, etc. Why? In this way, history will avoid using manipulations like those belonging to dictators. “Only under the hammer of world history can the eternal values of a people become the steel and iron that make history,” wrote Hitler in one of his books.34 “The Germans have helped us to regain Bessarabia and Bukovina, to arm ourselves, to start delousing the country from its internal enemies, the Jews, which we have considered to be more toxic than the external ones as the latter could determine the disintegration of the country, while the internal ones could poison and corrupt the soul of the people”35—as asserted by Antonescu in an interview dated March 5, 1943. We still need to address, among other things, the questions regarding the formation of the new generations and the criteria in whose name cultural products and the educational process facilitate change in mental reflexes. Secondly, it is essential to give up using parallel languages when it comes to the history of cultural-linguistic and religious minority and mainstream communities. Thirdly, in a pluri-lingual Europe, communication is relevant, but even more relevant is embracing a set of communitarian values. In many of the Central and South-Eastern European states, languages continue to be infested by the legacies of totalitarian regimes. These countries’ references to cultural and religious minorities are polemical in relation to the EU legislation; this represents an important clue about the population’s structure of thought. Chauvinist, anti-Rroma and anti-Semitic slogans feed propaganda as well as extremist attitudes.36 The return to ethno-nationalism not only proves the “original character” of Romanian democracy, which fails to cultivate a community’s welfare or an authentic social-democratic doctrine, but also the temptation to mo34\n\nCited by Koselleck, “Geschichte”, 714.

A pre-modern nineteenth-century orientation of Romanians—acutely present on the local level—confronts the normative supra-state meaning of the European Union. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the modernization of Central and South-Eastern Europe was lagging far behind that of the Western world. Later, two totalitarian regimes—fascism and national-communism—found it easy to freely establish and manifest themselves in the region, untroubled by the existence of an intellectual critique and a civic attitude. Despite the efforts of a social layer emancipated from obtuse ideologies, the endorsement of a multi-party system and the borrowing of democratic laws and their specific languages were not enough to uproot totalitarian-like behaviors in states like Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, or Hungary. The study of history must take into consideration not only the narration of facts or the invocation of statistical data as representing the sole testimonies to what happened; it must also consider the evolution of the language and the cultural and political thought characterizing a particular location. A thoughtful comparison of figures, as that by Timothy Snyder from the New York Review of Books of 16 July 2009, must be accompanied by thorough reflection on individuals, the baggage of knowledge assimilated in family and school, and especially on the attempt to find answers to difficult questions concerning the behavior of leaders and the masses before these take up certain decisions or political actions. Many questions need to be addressed before statistics dare proclaim verdicts: What are the intellectual sources which have favored the degradation of the human species during the “century of extremes”? Who invented the concept of enemy, when, to what aim? What is to be understood by expressions such as race enemy and class enemy and in what kind of political contexts are they likely to multiply and become the main weapons serving propaganda? Who becomes an enemy in times of war and what is the role of activating prejudices thanks to this concept? What does the notional pair we-you try to suggest or regulate? Who does we represent and who does you represent when one speaks of one and the same national society?37 37\n\nIn an article in Dilema Veche, no. 263/2009, entitled “Istoria de la povestire la problematizare” [The movement of history from story-telling to problematization], I showed that by failing to re-semanticize key-notions such as revolution, totalitarianism, communism, bolshevism, legionarism, fascism, Nazism, state, and nation, the authors of books\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

As to the geography of Central and South-Eastern Europe, it represents the infrastructure of history. I consider that the examination of the individual and the collective cultures which have generated mass crimes is a more adequate method for grasping the intimate resorts of totalitarian regimes and for understanding the evil they have produced. In this way we can also go beyond the political disputes among great powers in contemporary times.38 As to the Supreme Evil of Auschwitz, or the factory of death, as it has been called, there is no term of comparison for it. Yet, I consider helpful Snyder’s comment that “memory has had eccentric deviations from history,” which makes history more necessary than ever before. Central and South-Eastern Europe is at a crossroads stage where it needs to assume a different kind of knowledge as to its own history. This should not happen under just any circumstances, though; it needs to profit from the wealth of archival documents, the methodological gains and the effort of conceptualization, elements that one can use as research tools. What is at stake is not the invention of another national history, as attempted by dictatorial politics, but a rethinking of the same past events, facts, names, institutions and ideas. We must learn of the Holocaust and the Gulag via the legislations that have made possible such administrations; via their military actions, lagers and mass homicides; via the population’s structure of thought and the elites’ political culture; via reflexes which have affected radical actions. Critical analysis and problematization enrich one’s knowledge and facilitate access to the experiences of the past. Based on the above considerations, I see Romania standing at an essential crossroads, in need to distance itself from a history elaborated under the influence of the uniqueness doctrine, the so-called official history. Decoding fundamental concepts from the modern era and investigating their subsequent evolution are particularly useful for a thorough theoretical substantiation of the present and for the positive elaboration of future projects. When extended to areas such as language, literature, sociology and politology, studying the semantics of concepts significantly contributes to the identification of the traits of character that have been our legon December 1989 have created a literature whose only secret is the attempt to recover the emotional load of that political moment. 38 I do not think these disputes help to advance the progress of historical knowledge.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n21\n\nacy.

Is there any relation between the fundamental concepts of a language and the variants of socio-political interpretation? What should we consider from the theory that results from conceptual history? Is conceptual history capable to better disclose the realities of modern, contemporary Romania? What are the key-concepts we should investigate in the first stage of using Romanian conceptual history as research method? The end of World War II was followed by the reconceptualization of social and political events, of ideologies and languages from the great Western European states. For years on end, Germany, France and England focused on possible methods to approach history. Without disregarding the results of their predecessors, historians looked for alternative ways to their old approaches, finding conceptual history via Begriffsgeschichte as the means to rewrite national histories. According to Koselleck, the history of concepts is a minimum condition for “redefining the world of history” and the linguistic reflection on social evolution:40 No social activity, no political attitude, no economic exchange is possible without language, without the existence of a speaker and an addressee, without planning meetings, without public debates and secret gatherings, without order and obedience, without the consent of participants or disagreement on the part of people who are in conflict with one another. Any ordinary, everyday history that happens repetitively is dependent upon language in action and the act of speaking, just as no love story can be imagined without the presence of at least three words: I, you, and we.41 39\n\nSee Neumann’s “Foreword” to the Program of the International Conference Fundamental Concepts in Romanian Socio-Political Languages, held in Timişoara between 23 and 26 September 2009. The conference was organized by the “Reinhart Koselleck” International School in Conceptual History within the University of West, Timişoara in cooperation with Aachen University; it was sponsored by the Volkswagen Foundation and inspired by the work of historian Reinhart Koselleck. 40 Koselleck, Begriffsgeschichten, 9. 41 Ibid., 14: “Keine gesellschaftliche Tätigkeit, keine politischen Händel und kein wirtschaftlicher Handel ist möglich ohne Rede und Antwort, ohne Planungsgespräch, ohne öffentliche Debatte oder geheime Aussprache, ohne Befehl—und Gehorsam—, ohne\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Similar to the case of Germany after 1945, it is important for Romania to create the premises for a pluralist political culture by means of language awareness. The political discourse of Romania is marked by a flawed communication on the part of the elites; it is tributary to the culture of the monologue. Because of this, the deconstruction of concepts aims at drawing awareness to messages, and their re-semanticization stimulates the search for new representations of the collective identity. For instance, replacing the concept of ethno-national—whose origins lie in nineteenth-century Völkerpsychologie—by that of a nation of citizens would facilitate our ability to overcome communitarianist polarizations and the possibility to create a state entity which naturally accepts pluri-lingual, multicultural and multiconfessional co-habitation. Conceptual history aims to renew the possible approaches one might have to a historical entity by assuming an alternative cultural paradigm, namely by assuming political languages that are similar to those from the advanced societies of the European Union. Explaining the experiences from the past of Central and South-Eastern Europe by means of concepts represents one of the challenges we have chosen to address. Under the circumstances, we invite historians to come closer to the linguistic structure of texts and the messages contained therein so as to better grasp the communication happening among social and cultural groups living inside or outside Romania. If Reinhart Koselleck focused on the linguistic shifts occurring during the German period of transition that lasted from 1750 to 1850, paying particular attention to concepts that reflected modern thought such as Aufklärung or the Enlightenment (seen as a cultural theory), reform, progress, revolution, romanticism, idealism, privilege, freedom, future etc.,42 the approach that I consider particularly useful for Romanian historiography and Romanian culture as a whole is one which investigates concepts that describe “identities” or representations of “civil society,” in their turn leading to the formation of political identities. Romania is a country in Konsens der Beteiligten oder artikulierten Dissens sich streitender Parteien. Jede Alltagsgeschichte im täglichen Vollzug ist angewiesen auf Sprache in Aktion, auf Reden und Sprechen, so wie keine Liebesgeschichte denkbar ist ohne mindestens drei Worte— du, ich, wir.” 42 Cf. Brunner, Conze, Koselleck, Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe. For the manner in which the historian interprets the evolution of notions function of historical time, see, for instance, Koselleck, “Fortschritt,” vol. 2, 353–423.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n23\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Because of this, contradictions go hand in hand with what political thought and action express. Conceptual overlappings not only indicate delays in the process of transition from medieval to modern times, but also point to an incomplete modernization. On the one hand, our studies mean to reconsider and renew the approaches one might have to the history of Romania and the period of Romanian modernity, and on the other, they aim to problematize and instigate new reflections on linguistic shifts and transformations. An important step for socio-humanist sciences and the formation of a cultural politics in present-day Romania might be the analysis of some fundamental historical concepts in the Romanian language and their comparison with similar ones in German. The influence of German culture on the Romanian space has been less foregrounded than the influence of French culture; this is one more reason why our studies are even more welcome and necessary, just as they are willing to uncover the cultural path/transfer (the interculturalism) of concepts such as mothercountry/motherland, constitution, property, progress, nation, Europe, politics, and political person. Below are other reasons why we preferred to follow a Romanian-German cooperation and line of study: a) if French culture facilitated Romanians’ reception of cultural-ideological models and political-administrative forms, German culture significantly influenced the Romanian perspective on group consciousness, namely the idea of a cultural nation based upon claims of sharing the same language, the same origins and the same historical continuity on the same territory; b) the reception of the Austrian Aufklärung and the Prussian “Sturm und Drang” by the intellectual milieus of Transylvania occurred at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, while the transfer of their ideas to Wallachia and Moldavia took place during and after the events of the 1848 revolution; c) the German concepts regarding the state, nation and society were influential and played an important part in the development of Romanian thought in the nineteenth century. (In this sense, we could cite concepts such as: continuity, culture, ethnicity, ethno-culture, cultural nation, and nation); d) though we cannot ignore it, nineteenth-century German historiography is obsolete; consequently, we must note the renovations proposed by its postbellic schools, especially the major contribution of the Bielefeld\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\n24\n\nVictor Neumann\n\nCircle around Reinhart Koselleck, who contributed to the enrichment and reorientation of the working methodology in similar terms with the suggestions coming from the School of Annales run by Marc Bloch, Lucien Lefebvre and Fernand Braudel; e) the openness offered by German interdisciplinary studies deserves special attention since they have managed to de-Nazify historical and political languages in the post-World War II era; f) without ignoring national values, and the need to relate to one’s own past, conceptual history benefits from the pragmatism of the German method and is understood as a “European” relation to both the past and the future.\n\nCopyright © 2013. Central European University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nConclusions Many concepts are controversial in the Romanian space; hence, they provoke political disputes. Some of these concepts—the ones we have selected, framed and presented in this book—facilitate our ability to understand their meanings during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They clarify fragments from the past, motivating the necessity of methodological changes and the importance of rewriting the history of Romania. Representing a first research of this kind, and bearing a title which suggests the need for deep reformation, The History of Romania through Concepts. Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages may prove to be a praiseworthy contribution to historiography if it succeeds in enabling the establishment of a new and correct diagnosis of the problems characterizing Romania’s modernity. On choosing to more accurately pin down the past by the mastery of notions and by the capacity for theorization, historical writings gain in nuances and clarity as well as in the ability to better explain and understand facts and the context of their occurrence. They enhance the meaning of the past’s experiences in view of renewing science and culture and of having a visible, positive impact on society and politics. The evolution of linguistic norms and their renegotiation relativizes the discourse of the national past and, by that, it increases the chances for an authentic (and not merely formal) convergence between the values of Romania and Europe.\n\nKey Concepts of Romanian History : Alternative Approaches to Socio-Political Languages, Central European University Press,\n\nIs Rewriting Romanian History Useful?\n\n25\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Even if, thematically speaking, Romanian historiography has broadened its horizons, and contemporary Romanian history, in particular, has been the object of more in-depth analyses than in the past, Cristina and Dragoş Petrescu hold that, overall, post-1989 Romanian historiography has been less innovatory.1 Romanian Studies have made a modest progress in point of scientific results. Rather than aspiring to methodological innovations, the post-1989 Romanian historical science has aimed to free itself from ideological assertions by letting the sources speak for themselves and try to discover the “truth.” “What actually happened?” (Rilke)—historians have formulated this question as a reaction to dictators’ previous immersion in how to approach the past. The return to positivist traditions, to historicism and to a classical history of politics has represented an opportunity for the established historians of the Ceauşescu era to finally be able to freely express themselves. Nevertheless, Romanian public debates were still pretty heated in the aftermath of the 1989 Revolution, so that history thematized itself under other forms than might have been expected. Innovative outsiders and young scholars started to speak up and to employ new Western-inspired working methods. In this sense, it is worthwhile noting the debates around Lucian Boia’s studies on the myths of Romanian history2 and the debate around the school textbook of Romanian history ed1 2\n\nPetrescu and Petrescu, “Mastering vs. Coming to Terms with the Past,” 311–408. Pop, Istoria, adevărul şi miturile. See also Platon, “Despre istorie, adevăr şi mituri.

Which are the facts and what should be the role of history for the present? In what follows, I will present a few methodological considerations regarding the study and knowing of history. “Suprastructure” determines individual fate and—like serious economic events—it is historically significant; in Romania, it cannot be questioned given the socialist dictatorship that ruled on this territory. It proposes the understanding of the real as a “resistance force.” Meanwhile, having oftentimes been a subject of the power structure that can determine how the world is interpreted, the social field has had a long tradition and has been permanently reconfigured. Thought and speech thereby have become aspects of conscious or unconscious social action. Nevertheless, overly elaborated methodological approaches or the setting of too high methodological stakes should be avoided in the current stage of research on Romania; such is the conclusion of the first part of my study. Since this stage is devoted to the exploration of historiography’s research topics and to finding out the combatants, conceptual differences should not become criteria of exclusion. In this sense, “the methodological indeterminacy” characterizing “conceptual history” makes this research method useful for the Romanian case. Observing the basic, normative rules of a good historiography is more important than employing a rigorous methodology. This is why the studies in this collective volume resulting from the September 2009 International Conference on Romanian Conceptual History held at Timişoara will be thematically devoted to various problematizations and approaches. Romanian historiography asks similar questions to those of interest to German historiography. In the 1960s,4 when conceptual history was confronted with three established schools of historical research, German historians thematized similar issues to those concerning present-day Romanian historians. Going against the grain of common political history, which focused on events and intentions, conceptual history turned its attention to social change. It ran against the classical history of ideas, from Droysen to Meinecke, disagreeing with the latter’s faith in eternal reason. Conceptual history highlighted fissures and discontinuities; it opposed 3\n\nHeinen, “Auf den Schwingen Draculas nach Europa?” 91–104; Murgescu, Istoria din ghiozdan; Ihrig, “Die kommunistische Vergangenheit,” 81–90; Schippel, Kultureller Wandel als Ansinnen, 77–100. 4 To date, several scholars have written surveys that trace the history of conceptual history.

The agenda of conceptual history was not set from the very beginning. It had to make sure that its object was “the writing of history,” an executive action, which would lead to scholars’ further analysis of controversies and similar approaches from within and outside Germany. We could explain many of the reproaches later ascribed to conceptual history by its experimental beginnings and agenda: its initial aim was circumscribed to"
