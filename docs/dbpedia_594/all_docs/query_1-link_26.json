        "text": "This article deals with the process of creation of symbolic boundaries in the context of designing the folk music programs at Radio Belgrade since its foundation until the beginning of World War Two. A detailed insight into the musical contents aired on Radio Belgrade, the texts on folk music published in the radio weekly magazine (Radio Belgrade), and the preserved memoirs, with an emphasis on their broader socio-cultural and socio-political significance, has enabled me to single out the factors and mechanisms that played a key role in defining the boundaries of folk music. I will analyse the work of different editorial teams before World War Two; at the same time, I will consider the tastes and cultural preferences of the subscribers and listeners of the Radio Belgrade programs. By means of crossing out specific aesthetic, political and economical positions of radio editors and experts who designed the folk music program with the expectations of listeners and, to an extent, performers of folk music, I will attempt to explain how the process of symbolical demarcation of folk music as a separate entity, different from art and popular music, took place; but also, how the folk music broadcast on the radio related to the Serbian folklore musical practices.\n\nIn 1878, the centuries-long Ottoman rule ended and Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. A completely different sociopolitical system marked the beginning of the decades-long of the adjustment process, a significant contribution to which was given by immigrants, the Czech population being the most numerous among them. Events and innovations in cultural life prompted by the immigration of a new layer of society of different professions, nations and customs were the most prominent in Sarajevo. The aim of this paper is to investigate the forms of professional activities of Czech musicians in Sarajevo, as well as their role in the development of musical culture of Sarajevo, the administrative, political, economic and cultural center of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nStarting with Maria Todorova’s landmark study Imagining the Balkans (Todorova 1997), numerous authors have raised their voices against stereotypical images of the Balkans. Over twenty years after the publication of this book, the term “the Balkans” seems to have lost some of its negative connotations related to wars in favour of characteristics with positive overtones, such as the Balkan peoples’ joie-de-vivre and entertainment strongly related to music. The areal ethnomusicology drawing from fieldwork throughout the Balkan peninsula has been a fruitful topic for numerous local and foreign ethnomusicologists and the very term “the Balkans” has raised a special interest in the ethnomusicological research of “outsiders”, as well as in the music industry. This paper is written from the perspective of an “insider” ethnomusicologist from the Balkans. I raise the question of the definition of the “Balkan” popular music label and discuss its main structural characteristics. I offer a new possibility of (re)considering a specific musical genre of the region based on the research of urban folk music practices. I present characteristics of urban folk music practices from the second half of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century in the countries of the Balkans, with special attention paid to their common aspects. Also, contemporary urban folk music, which is often criticized as a specific popular music form, is considered."
