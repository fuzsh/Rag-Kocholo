The Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum (or short SLM) is the museum I liked most at Aachen and that is quite a surprise as large parts of the museum are filled with Christian art. It was founded in 1883 and is named after the entrepreneurs Barthold Suermondt and Irene & Peter Ludwig. First located in the Comphausbadstraße it can be found since 1901 at the Villa Cassalette at the street surrounding the city center and rather close to the main railway station. Within this wonderful building you can find paintings and sculptures from the 12th to the 18th century staged in a great way. A masterpiece are the many illuminated glass paintings.

A colorful museum that adds short texts to all items so that it is easy to learn more. Throughout the museum you can – in additional to the sacred art – also discover fascinating works of artists like Max Beckmann, Lovis Corinth, Albrecht Dürer, Francisco de Goya, August Macke, Rembrandt and Max Slevogt. A very special room is the Bürgerliche Kunstkammer, a cabinet of curiosities donated by the citizens. I stayed much longer inside than expected and that also has to do with the museum education officers that had prepared a quiz game that made me spend an hour looking at details of Christian art; never thought that this might happen…
