Plompy Manfred Sellink Bibliography 301 Index 317 Photograph Credits 323 Director s Foreword One of the most beloved of Netherlandish artists, Pieter Bruegel the Elder is best known today for his paintings of peasants and proverbs. He is now less commonly recog- nized as the inventive and influential draftsman who brought a new naturalism to the rendering of landscape and who created a body of print designs that pointedly dis- sects the imperfections of human nature. Yet it was above all through this exceptional graphic work that Bruegels art achieved widespread fame during the sixteenth century. Surprisingly, this is the first major exhibition devoted solely to Bruegels remarkable drawings and prints. For this unique occasion we have assembled as many of his drawings as possible, fifty- four of the sixty-one sheets that survive — the largest number of drawings by the master that has been brought together in several centuries. Our undertaking is especially opportune, because our conception of Bruegels landscape drawings has changed dramatically since the time of the last major exhibition of his drawings, which was held in Berlin in 1975. This reassessment is based on the changes in attribution made by the late Hans Mielke, whose scholarship has forced us to look at the master s drawings with new eyes and to whose perception of a \"new Bruegef our exhibition is indebted. We hope that our exhibition will offer both scholars and the general public a unique opportunity to examine and judge for themselves this new Bruegel. To this end the organizers of this presentation have included a selection of works formerly assigned to Bruegel so that visitors can examine the new attributions in the context of earlier ones. Our selection is also distinctive in another respect; we made it a point to show strong, early impres- sions of the engravings and etchings after Bruegels designs whenever they could be located, an endeavor that is rarely undertaken but one that shows the prints at their best and has led to a fresh view of these familiar works. Bruegel's accepted drawings are relatively few in number, and thus our exhibition would not be possible without the generous participation of both private collec- tors and public institutions willing to part with their very rare possessions. We are, therefore, most gratefial to these lenders. A particular note of appreciation must be exten- ded to the three museums with the largest holdings of Bruegels drawings, the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Kufperstichkabinett; The British Museum in London; and the Graphische Sammlung Albertina in Vienna, whose directors and curators made the exceptional gesture of lending all their drawings by Bruegel for this occasion. The exhibition was organized by Nadine M. Orenstein, Associate Curator in the Department of Drawings and Prints at the Metropolitan Museum, and Manfred Sellink, Director of the Stedelijke Musea Brugge and formerly Chief Curator of Drawings and Prints in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. We are indeed grateful to Manfred Sellink, who had considered holding an exhibition of Bruegels drawings and prints some time before a collab- oration with the Metropolitan Museum was envisioned. Our thanks are also extended to all of our colleagues at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen who helped to organize the exhibition as well as to the members of the staff of the Metropolitan Museum who have contributed their efforts toward coordinating the show and producing the catalogue. The Museum extends its sincere thanks to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for its support of the exhibition. We are also indebted to the generosity of Karen B. Cohen and The Drue E. Heinz Fund for mak- ing this publication possible. Philippe de Montebello Director The Metropolitan Museum of Art VII Acknowledgments This catalogue is dedicated to the memory of the late Hans Mielke, whose transformative insight into Bruegels drawings provided the basis for our exhibition.

XII Pieter Bruegel the Elder Drawings and Prints The Elusive Life of Pieter Bruegel the Elder NADINE M. ORENSTEIN Who was Pieter Bruegel the Elder? An engraved portrait of him published about three years after his death (fig. i) is our best surviving record of his appearance/ But this stiff profile view reveals little; he does not even hold a paintbrush or palette, traditional symbols of the painter s craft. Biogra- phers since the sixteenth century have sought to describe the life of this Netherlandish artist whose works so capti- vate us but whose own story is still largely a mystery. Bruegel himself seems as elusive as his Beekeepers (cat. no. 107): men with palpable presence, whose identities we cannot penetrate, for their encased heads and covered bod- ies offer few clues to who they are, where they have come from, or what they are thinking. Like them Bruegel remains an intangible figure, although his remarkable paintings and drawings leave us with enduring impressions. While such panels as The Wedding Banqmt^ ca. 1567 (fig.2), and The Harvesters^ 1565 (fig. 3), present the viewer with vivid images of peasant life, we know that their creator was not the \"Peasant Bruegel\" that so many of his early biographers imagined him to be but rather a city dweller who associated with the learned intellectuals of his day.^ However, during the past four and a half centuries, little more than these meager facts have been revealed about BruegeFs background, and there is even less information about his beliefs and opinions. As a result, we can in the main only make educated guesses about what ideas he might have intended to convey in his extraordinary paintings of peasants and in the landscapes and allegorical print designs featured in the present catalogue.^ Tracing Bruegel's biography is problematic because doc- umentary evidence relating to his life is exceptionally sparse. Indeed, we can track the history of his paintings over the last four and a half centuries more easily than we can reconstruct his life. Archival records provide us only with glimpses of disparate moments — his inscription into the artists* guild, a painting commission, his marriage.\"^ We can extrapolate information from these glimpses and piece them together with other contemporary evidence and with what we know about the period in which he lived, his family, and his friends. The two-and-a-half-page biography published by Karel van Mander in his Schilder-boeck of 1604 has served as an important source for details about Fig. 1. Attributed to Johannes Wierbc. Portrait of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Engraving from Dominicus Lampsonius, Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae Inferiores effigies^ 1572 Detail, cat. no. 107. The Beekeepers Bruegels life, but it cannot be taken entirely at face value:^ while the author must have based his account partly on information from people who knew Bruegel,^ his narrative is interwoven with the sort of topoi and invented anecdotes meant to clarify the painter s work that were standard features of artists' biographies of the time. Van Mander asserts, for instance, that Bruegel and his friend Hans Franckert went to country fairs and weddings dressed like peasants and gave \"presents just like the others, pretending to be family or acquaintances of the bride or bridegroom.\"^ Bruegel may well have been friends with Franckert, a mer- chant and jeweler in Antwerp, but the rest of the story seems likely to be a fantasy inspired by the imagery in the artist's depictions of peasant festivities, several of which the author had seen in local Amsterdam private collections.^ It is usual to begin a biography with the date and place of its subjects birth, but here this cannot be done, for in Bruegels case both of these facts are open to question. The main source of evidence for his birth date is one of the ear- liest documents we have relating to Bruegel: the record of his inscription into the Antwerp artists' guild, the guild of Saint Luke. This document, which reads Peeter Brueghelsy schilder (Peeter Brueghels, painter), is dated 1551.^ And because artists normally joined the guild between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five, most scholars calculate that Bruegel was born sometime between 1525 and 1530.^*^ The place of Bruegel's birth has been a matter of even more speculation. It is possible that he was born in either of two towns named Breughel or Brogel — one in the Northern Netherlands the other in the Southern Netherlands. According to Van Mander, he came from a village called Bruegel, not far from Breda, but the place described in this way could be the northern or the southern town.\" One theory, based on the form of the artist's name as it appears in the register of the guild of Saint Luke — which is Brueghels — points in an altogether different direction. Proponents of this view believe that because the final ^ in a name often indicated a patronymic, it may well be that he did not come from a town called Bruegel but rather that he was the son of a man named Brueghel.'\"^ Not much is known about Bruegel's early training. Van Mander writes that he studied in Brussels with Pieter Coecke van Aelst, who was one of the most important painters in the Netherlands during the early sixteenth century and whose daughter we know he eventually married. It is difficult to confirm Van Mander's statement, although details of Bruegel's life do coincide with aspects of the history of Coecke or rather that of Coecke's wife, the watercolorist Mayken Verhulst.^^ As has often been noted, Bruegel's work bears little resemblance to Coecke's, which is marked by friezelike compositions as weU as ornamentation and muscu- lar figures that both show Italian influence. Indeed, Bruegel's art, with its expansive, naturalistic landscapes, distinctly Flem- ish scenes, and stocky peasants, can be viewed as having developed in reaction to the production of Coecke and the artists of his generation.'\"^ Nevertheless, it may be that Bruegel was Coecke's pupil, absorbing from him certain general com- positional principles and an appreciation for Italian art rather than a legacy of specific stylistic formulas.'^ We have concrete evidence that in 1550 and 1551 Bruegel was in Mechelen, where he was in the employ of the artist and art dealer Claude Dorizi, painting the outer wings of an altarpiece for the glove makers' guild in the cathedral of Saint Rombout. The records for this altarpiece, Bruegel's earliest documented work, show that Peeter Baltens carried out the main panel and that the outer wings were to repre- sent Saint Gommaire and Saint Rombout in grisaille.'^ The date of Bruegel's work in Mechelen accords well with the theory that he studied with Coecke, who died in 1550; it is reasonable to suppose that the death of Coecke, if he had been Bruegel's master, would have prompted his pupil's move from Antwerp at this moment. Moreover, Coecke's wife was originally from Mechelen, and it may have been through her that Bruegel came into contact with Dorizi.''^ It was soon after he finished work on the altarpiece, which unfortunately no longer exists, that Bruegel joined the guild of Saint Luke. Not long after that he began a journey to France and then to Italy, which Van Mander describes. There is only scant proof that Bruegel traveled in France, whereas Van Mander's account of the artist's stay in Italy between 1552 and 1554 is complemented and supported by both documentary evidence and works by the artist. (This is the first of very few instances in which that author's asser- tions about Bruegel are confirmed by tangible proof.) Bruegel probably traveled to Italy via Lyons, making his way south to Sicily and then turning back north toward Rome, where he remained for some time. It has often been proposed that he went to Italy in the company of two 5 Fig. 4. Attributed to Simon Novellanus after Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Landscape with Mercury Abducting Psyche, ca. 1595. Etching. The Metropohtan Museum of Art, New York, Harris Brisbane Dick Fund, 1946 46.100.2 Antwerp artists, the painter and prolific print designer Maarten de Vos and the sculptor Jacob Jongelinck, both of whom have been documented as present in Italy in 1552.^^ A few surviving works can be associated with this period in Bruegels life. One of these is the drawing Southern Cloister in a Valley (cat. no. i), which is dated 1552 and depicts an Italian landscape that was probably sketched on site. His print Naval Battle in the Strait of Messina (cat. no. 85), although dated 1561, must have been based on sketches made on site as well and indicates that he traveled as far south as Sicily. Two other sheets attest to Bruegels stay in Rome: the drawing Ripa Grande in Rome^ ca. 1552-54 (cat. no. 8), and the engraving Prospectus Tyhurtinus (View of Tivoli)y ca. 1555-56 (cat. no. 24). That the Roman sojourn probably took place about 1553 is suggested by two etchings published near the end of the sixteenth century that purport to reproduce drawings Bruegel made in Rome and are inscribed Petrus Bruegel fee: RomaeA° 755J (made by Pieter Bruegel in Rome in the year 1553) (see fig. 4).'^ Moreover, it is likely that in 1553 Bruegel met and collaborated with the Croatian miniaturist Giulio Clovio, who returned to Rome in that year after a two- year absence from the city. Their acquaintance and work together are attested by Clovio s estate inventory of 1577 recording five works, now lost, that Bruegel would have made during his trip. These include a Tower of Babel painted on ivory, a gouache view of Lyons — which testifies to the truth of Van Mander s statement that Bruegel traveled in France on his way to Italy— and a gouache of a tree/° The most intriguing of them, however, is a miniature, of which half was painted by Clovio and half by Bruegel/^ Although scholars have not succeeded in identifying Bruegel's hand in any of Clovio s works, we can surmise that it is this miniaturist's influence we see in such paint- ings by Bruegel as The Tower of Babel (fig. 5), which teems with minute figures. When he went back to the Netherlands, probably by 1554 and presumably settling in Antwerp, Bruegel began to work for the Antwerp print publisher Hieronymus Cock. That year he drew the Landscape with Bears (cat. no. 15), which Cock elaborated and etched as The Temptation of Christ (cat. no. 16), and in 1555-56 he made the designs for The Large Landscapes group of prints (cat. nos. 22-34). These works marked the beginning of Bruegels most prolific period of activity as a designer of prints, which lasted until 1561. During this time he carried out more than forty draw- ings for prints, including The Seven Deadly Sins series, 1556-57 (cat. nos. 42-54), Everyman^ 1558 (cat. nos. 58, 59), The Alchemist^ 1558? (cat. nos. 60, 61), and The Seven Virtues sequence, 1559-60 (cat. nos. We must remember that these engravings and etchings not only were fasci- nating projects for Bruegel but also offered him a steady source of income at a time when he seems to have had few major painting commissions. Indeed, only a handful of his surviving paintings bear a date earlier than 1562: The Parable of the Sowery 1557 (Timken Museum of Art, San Diego), The Netherlandish Proverbs, 1559 (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Gemaldegalerie), The Battle between Carnival and Lent, 1559 (fig. 6), and The Childrens Games, 1560 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). From about 1562, however, his commis- sions for paintings became more numerous, and his produc- tion as a designer of prints declined dramatically. Yet his few late drawings for prints are no less significant than the many early ones, for among them are Spring, 1565 (cat. no. 105), and Summer, 1568 (cat. no. 109), as well as the two woodcut designs The Wild Man or The Masquerade of Orson and Valentine, 1566 (cat. no. 108), and The Dirty Bride or The Wedding of Mopsus andNisa, 1569 (cat. no. iii). Bruegels painting Two Monkeys (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Gemaldegalerie) offers a background view of Antwerp, which has been considered an indication that the artist was still living in that city in 1562, the date borne on the panel.\"^^ He was certainly in Brussels in 1563, marrying Mayken, Coecke s daughter. According to Van Mander, about the time of the marriage, Maykens mother convinced Bruegel to move from Antwerp to Brussels in order to distance him from a former girlfriend. The veracity of this story wiU likely never be confirmed, but it seems clear that by the time of his wedding, Bruegel was in Brussels, the city where he had at least one significant patron and ultimately was buried.\"^^ While Antwerp was the prosperous commercial center of the Netherlands, Brussels was the seat of the government, 7 Fig. 6. Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The Battle between Carnival andLent^ 1959. Oil on panel. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna and it may be that Bruegel moved there seeking court com- missions. This is conjecture, but we know for certain that he became increasingly active as a painter beginning in 1562. In fact, most of his forty or so surviving paintings date to the last seven years of his life — the period that saw the creation of such important works as The Fall of the Rebel Angels^ 1562 (Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, Brussels), Dulle Griet, 1562 or 1563 (Museum Mayer van den Bergh, Antwerp), The Wedding Dance ^ 1566 (fig. 104), and The Sermon of Saint John the Baptist, 1566 (Szepmiiveszeti Muzeum, Budapest). The great majority of these paintings are large pan- els, cabinet pieces that Bruegel produced for wealthy, well-educated private collectors in Antwerp and Brussels. Among Bruegel's most notable and devoted patrons can be counted Cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, arch- bishop of Mechelen and counselor to Margaret, duchess of Parma and regent of the Netherlands. Granvelle owned several of Bruegel's pictures, but we can identify only one, the Flight into Egypt, 1563 (Courtauld Institute Galleries, London). The prominent Antwerp merchant and royal official Nicolaes Jongelinck was the most avid contempo- rary collector of Bruegel's work. He owned sbcteen of his pictures, including the Tower of Babel, 1563 (Kunsthis- torisches Museum, Vienna), and the Road to Calvary {The Carrying of the Cross), 1564 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, 8 Vienna), as well as the great series The Months, 1565,^^^ which appears to have decorated a single room in his coun- try villa, Ter Becken. How Bruegel might have come into contact with such wealthy and powerful patrons is unclear. Granvelle he may have met through his presumed traveling companion in Italy Jacob Jongelinck, who was one of the archbishop s favorite artists — or the link here was perhaps Cock, who dedicated several prints to Granvelle/^ And he could well have been introduced to Nicolaes Jongelinck by Jacob, who was his brother. We know that another important patron was BruegeFs friend: the renowned car- tographer Abraham Ortelius, who owned the grisaille Death of the Virgitij 1564 (fig. 109; see entry for cat. no. 117). In 1567, two years before Bruegels death, the duke of Alva arrived in Brussels. From there he unleashed a reign of terror, the culmination of campaigns of oppression and censorship that had been waged for many years by the Inquisition and the Catholic Spanish governors of the Netherlands against Protestants and others they deemed heretics and subversives. Bruegels production from his last years, such as the paintings The Blind Leading the B/indy 1568 (Capodimonte, Naples), and The Magpie on the Gallows^ 1568 (fig. 7), are pervaded by a tone of sorrow and bitterness that seems to reflect the artist s feelings about contemporary events. Specific details and themes treated in many of the works of these years offer tantalizing clues to these feelings. Thus the magpie in The Magpie on the Gallows^ Van Mander tells us, refers to gossiping tongues that Bruegel consigned to the gallows — and we wonder if the gossips might stand for informers. Ambiguous too, for example, are the many knives featured in the draw- ing and the print Summer, 1568, which seem not to relate merely to the theme of the harvest but to something more ominous as well. While it is difficult to imagine that Bruegel was unmoved by the climate of terror that surrounded him, we cannot say what he thought about it. Unfortunately, there is no information about his religious or political beliefs, and his imagery, although suggestive, is too enigmatic to give us any clear evidence of his intended meanings. We can examine what we know about Bruegels circle of friends, acquaintances, and patrons for what this might teU us about him, but this exercise yields no real answers. His friend Ortelius, for example, belonged to a clandestine religious sect, the Family of Love, that rejected all ceremony and hierarchy, but there is no proof that Bruegel was also a member. Moreover, the faith of the Family of Love stood in radical opposition to the ideologies of Bruegels major patrons. Cardinal Granvelle was an envoy of the Spanish court who took a harsh stand against heretics, and Nicolaes Jongelinck was a staunch Catholic. Perhaps it is reasonable to propose, as one scholar has done, that Bruegel did not side with one particular group but that his sympathy and allegiance shifted over time.^'' Yet the conclusion to Van Mander s biography of the artist encourages us to think that Bruegel had strong, even subversive, opinions: \"One sees many unusual inventions of symbolic subjects of his witty work in print; but he had still many more, neatly and care- fiilly drawn with some captions on them, some of which he got his wife to burn when he was on his deathbed because they were too caustic or derisory, either because he was sorry or that he was afraid that on their account she would get into trouble or she might have to answer for them.\"^^ What might these drawings have been like, if they did indeed exist? Were there many with the sort of captions that Van Mander mentioned and did they resemble The Beekeepers, with its handwritten inscription? Were many destroyed, and, if so, is this the reason so few survive from this period? As with so many aspects of Bruegels life, we can only wonder. Pieter Bruegel died in Brussels in 1569; we know this from a memorial erected many years later by his son the painter Jan Brueghel in honor of his parents in the church of Notre-Dame de la Chapelle in Brussels. Bruegel's wife, Mayken, outlived him by nine years. Jan, the younger of BruegeFs two sons, and Pieter the Younger, the older child, were about one and five years old, respec- tively, when their father died. They must hardly have known him, but even so both eventually became success- ful painters in their own right. Pieter the Younger, in fact, ran a prolific workshop that produced variations on his father's compositions.^*^ Although Bruegels story for the most part remains a mystery, we can state with confidence that he achieved some fame during his lifetime and that this fame grew exponentially soon after his death. Not long after he died, his paintings were eagerly sought after and had become quite costly. Cardinal Granvelle, who had been forced out 9 of the Netherlands in 1564 and had left his collection behind, tried to replace his Bruegels in 1572 and found this to be a difficult and expensive undertaking.^^ By the end of the century Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor in Prague, owned a large and notable group of Bruegel pictures — some of which he had inherited from his brother Archduke Ernest, who had collected them when he was governor of the Netherlands between 1593 and 1595. Bruegel became widely known through his prints, w*hich circulated as far as France and Italy during his lifetime and were published and republished in the decades after his death. Among the Italians who saw his prints was Lodovico Guicciardini, whose description of him as the second Hieronymus Bosch in his 1567 Descrittione di . . . tutti i Paesi Bassi would have been based, at least in part, on such prints as The Seven Deadly Sins, compositions overrun by Boschian creatures. Another was Giorgio Vasari, who listed Bruegel among the noteworthy Netherlandish painters in his 1568 Le vite de piu eccellenti pittori, scultori et architettort and also related his vision to that of Bosch.^\"^ The per- ceptions of these Italian authors appear to have been encouraged by information sent to them by Dominicus Lampsonius when he was compiling a series of prints showing famous Netherlandish painters. In the verses that accompanied Bruegels portrait, the stiff engraved Fig. 7. Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The Magpie on the Gallows, 1568. Oil on panel. Hessisches Landesmuseum, Darmstadt profile image that appears at the beginning of this essay, Lampsonius praised his compatriot: Who is this new Hieronymus Bosch, appeared again in the world'? Who through his great artistry is able to imitate the spirited dreams of the master with his brush and pen, so as now and then even to surpass him'? May you, Pieter, grow in your spirit as you have in art, for in your and your old masters comical genre of design you earn everywhere and from everyone the outstanding rewards of praise, by no means less than any other artist. About the same time Lampsonius s poem was pub- lished, Ortelius wrote a tribute in memory of his friend on a page in his Album Amicorum^ which in even more lavish terms reveals the contemporary view of Bruegel: \"That Pieter Bruegel was the most perfect painter of his age, no one — unless jealous or envious or ignorant of his art — could ever deny. But that he was snatched away from us in the flower of his age — I cannot say whether I should attribute it to Death, who thought Bruegel was more advanced in age when he observed the distinguished skill of his art, or whether I should attribute it to Nature who feared that she would be held up in contempt because of his artistic and talented skills at imitation. 10 Perhaps the strongest testimony to Bruegel's posthu- mous fame is provided by the many copies of his paintings and drawings as well as the numerous works imitating his style that were produced during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. Drawings such as those by Jacob Savery and the Master of the Mountain Landscapes included in this catalogue (cat. nos. 120-129) stand as proof of the admiration his art commanded; they are unequivocal evidence that his style was already identifiable soon after his death and that it quickly became a model to be emulated and sometimes even forged. We may never learn with cer- tainty when or where Bruegel was born, or who his teachers might have been, or what precisely he intended to express in his pictures, but the strong impact of his work on later generations and the timelessness of his contribution make these gaps in our knowledge seem insignificant. 1. The portrait, which is unsigned, is now given to Johannes Wierix by Zsuzanna van Ruyven, who is compihng the Wierix volume for the New Hollstein series. As the engraving was published in Dominicus Lampsonius's Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae Inferioris effigies^ by Volcxken Diericx — the widow of Bruegels longtime publisher Hieronymus Cock — only a few years after Bruegel's death, it is likely that the bearded profile bears some resemblance to the artist. 2. Gliick (1910, p. 6) put an end to the idea of the Peasant Bruegel. 3.

Jacob Jongelinck was the brother of Nicolaes Jongelinck, who would become Bruegel's patron. 19.

II Hans Mielke in memoriam Pieter Bruegel as a Draftsman: The Changing Image MARTIN ROYALTON-KISCH The epithet \"Peasant Bruegel\" still clings tena- ciously to Pieter Bruegel the Elder.' Yet he won the admiration of his contemporaries not for painting rustics but as a disciple of \"nature\" and of Hieronymus Bosch. His early reputation was based primarily on his engraved designs, for which more than half of his surviving drawings are preparations. The drawings could not have given rise to the \"peasant\" epithet, for far from illustrating the rustic life of Flanders, almost all of them are either landscapes or fan- tastic allegories in the manner of Bosch. Likewise, Bruegels oil paintings represent religious subjects more often than the peasantry, despite the exceptional focus on it in compo- sitions like the celebrated Wedding Banquet {fig. 2). The first published notice of Bruegel appeared in 1567, in a book by Lodovico Guicciardini entitled Descrittione di , , . tutti i Paesi Bassi (Description of All the Low Countries), He described the artist as a \"great imitator\" of Bosch who had become known as the \"second Hieronymus Bosch.\"^ A year later Giorgio Vasari also paired Bruegel with Bosch and called Bruegel an \"excellent master.\"^ Vasari, although garbling the chronology of the two painters, described their works as \"landscapes in oil, fantasies, bizarre things, dreams, and imaginations\" and was thus the first to catego- rize Bruegels art into landscapes on the one hand and fantasies on the other.\"^ Vasari revealed that his information came from Domini- cus Lampsonius of Liege, who in 1572, three years after Bruegels death, published a brief tribute to Bruegel on a portrait engraving of his late friend (fig. i). This again paired him with Bosch: Wbo is Ms new Hieronymus Boschy appeared again in the world? Who through his great artistry is able to imitate the spirited dreams of the master with his brush and pen, so as now and then even to surpass him'? MayyoUy Pieter, grow in your spirit as you have in art, for in your and your old masters comical genre of design you earn everywhere and from everyone the outstanding rewards of praise, by no means less than any other artist} Two aspects of Lampsonius's text are worth stressing. Despite heading his poem \"Pieter Bruegel, Painter [Pictor]\" Lampsonius highlighted Bruegels skill with the pen and in design {graphices)y giving an unusual emphasis to his works on paper rather than to his paintings. Lampsonius also considered Bruegels achievements as an artist to be of the highest order, despite the \"comical genre\" of his art, a genre that normally would have condemned its practitioners to the ranks of the second-rate.^ At about the same time another friend, the cartographer and humanist Abraham Ortelius, wrote (without mention- ing Bosch) that Bruegel was an imaginative artist who, as Pliny the Elder had said of Apelles, \"painted many things that could not be painted.\"^ Ortelius also emphasized Bruegels naturalism, comparing him with Eupompas, the Greek master of the fifth century B.C. \"who followed nature, not other artists.\"^ This aspect of Bruegels art was similarly praised by Karel van Mander in his biography of him published in 1604. But like Guicciardini, Vasari, and Lampsonius, Van Mander also described Bruegel as a Bosch imitator, revealing that, early on, \"he had practiced a lot after the manner [handelinghe] of Jeroon van den Bosch.\"^ Bruegel's drawings reveal with particular clarity that although he initiated neither the fantastic nor the natural- istic in art, he occupies a significant place in the history of both genres. Yet just sixty-one drawings by Bruegel are known — which makes them rare, even though this is a wealth in comparison with those of earlier Flemish painters such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, and Bosch. Only one drawing is generally accepted as by Van Eyck: the Detail, cat. no. 14, Wooded Landscape with a Distant View toward the Sea Fig. S.Jan van Eyck. Saint Barbara, 1437. Brush? drawing on prepared panel. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp Portrait of Cardinal Alb ergati now in Dresden/\" However, Van Eyck's painting of Saint Barbara of 1437 t^kes the form of an elaborate finished drawing on a prepared panel (fig. 8), and the background landscape announces, in an extraordi- nary way, Bruegel's pen drawings of more than a century later.\" We encounter in Bruegel the same distant hills, dot- ted with trees and capped by an unreal city — a Heavenly Jerusalem — with a broad river below (compare cat. nos. 9, 10, 12, 20). We also observe builders at work, cutting and transporting newly quarried stones and preparing mortar, much as Bruegel portrayed them in his two paintings of the Tower of Babel (see fig. 5). Such connections between Bruegel and fifteenth- century art will detain us again later. Drawings ascribed to Rogier van der Weyden are also extremely rare,'^ and only a few more are known by Bosch (see figs. 9, 34). However, the catalogue of the sixty-one draw- ings by Bruegel published in 1996 by Hans Mielke has so Fig, 9. Hieronymus Bosch. The Field Has Eyes, the Forest Has Ears, ca. 1505-16. Pen and brown ink. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett radically revised our conception of Bruegel the draftsman that we need to return to first principles. Iconography and cultural history, which have long been the chief concern of writers about Bruegel's art, are treated at greater length elsewhere in this catalogue.'^ Here we will concentrate on Bruegels drawings in the context of those by his predeces- sors and contemporaries, both in Flanders and in Italy. Bruegel in Italy: The Mastering of Landscape The earliest dated drawings by Bruegel are five landscapes of 1552 (fig. 10; cat. nos. 1-4). In this year, like so many Flemish artists before him, he set off from Antwerp for Italy to com- plete his education as a painter. Having in aU probability trained with Pieter Coecke van Aelst, who died in 1550, Bruegel had worked in Mechelen (Malines) alongside Peeter Baltens (of whom more below) for the art entrepreneur 14 Claude Dorizi. Bruegel had enrolled in the Antwerp painters* guild for the 1551-52 \"guild year.\" One may imagine that as a pupil of the recently deceased Coecke, a highly suc- cessful painter who had been to Italy himself and had trans- lated into Dutch the architectural treatise of Sebastiano Serlio, Bruegel ventured south in 1552 in anticipation of studying a wide range of material and, as Vasari stated of Bruegels compatriots, in order \"to learn the Italian manner.\"'^ Before examining the drawings that Bruegel made dur- ing his travels, we should pause to consider a characteristic design by his master (fig. 11). It has become a commonplace to state that Bruegel's works reveal no trace of Coecke s influence.'^ Although this is largely true, Coecke did pro- duce paintings with Bosch-like characteristics,^^ and his well-ordered and inventive compositions would have been instructive to Bruegel. Reminiscent of the works of GiuHo Romano and of the Font^ainebleau school, Coecke s designs often teem with figures in complex arrangements and exag- gerated postures — raw materials that emerge transformed in Bruegels explosive fantasies. The tree to the left in The Capture of the City of At (fig. 11), rising in a spiral to frame the design, also reveals something of Coecke s abihties in landscape, a genre taken up by his pupil with enthusiasm.'^ Besides studying the ruins of ancient Rome, northern European artists visited Italy to marvel at the paintings, sculpture, and architecture that had been produced there during the previous sixty years, above all by Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian. We should remember that Michelangelo and Titian were still active, the two most celebrated artists in the world, when Bruegel traveled south in 1552. Michelangelo, who had completed The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel more than ten years before, had recently finished the frescoes The Conversion of Saint Paul and The Crucifixion of Saint Peter in Pope Paul Ill's private chapel in the Vatican. However foreign to Bruegel's artistic ambitions Michelangelo's aims might appear — and Michelangelo could be dismissive of Netherlandish painting'^ — it is unimaginable that Bruegel would have ignored the Sistine Chapel and the other sights of Rome. Indeed, the festive rustics in his paintings must partly have derived their weighty plasticity from the figures of the Italian sculptor,^^ and these types reappear in Bruegels late drawing of The Beekeepers (fig. 12; cat. no. 107), which quotes from The Sacrifice of Noah on the Sistine Chapel ceiling (fig. 13). Titian had for twenty years been court painter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the most powerful sov- ereign in the hemisphere and, ultimately, the ruler of Flanders.^' Besides completing numerous portraits and historical paintings, Titian had reinvigorated the art of Fig. 10. Pieter Bruegel the Elder. River Landscape, 1552. Pen and brown ink on blue paper. Departement des Arts Graphiques du Musee du Louvre, Paris 15 landscape, though he based his vision on Flemish models. Knowledge of his works had spread through prints (see fig. 14),\" and these influenced Bruegel, whose cotton -wool foliage in Wooded Landscape with Mills (cat. no. 2) is remark- ably like that in a woodcut after Titian's Two Goats at the Foot of a Tree (fig. 79).^^ Thus Bruegels art, like that of most of his countrymen, was tempered by his experience of Italian art.'^'^ Bruegels earliest drawings reveal that he was already a consummate landscapist when he embarked on his travels, just as Diirer had been on setting out for Italy in 1494.''^ River Landscape of 1552 (fig. 10) has been eloquently described by Mielke: \"a winding, slow-moving river between gentle mountains; a boat on the left, walkers and riders on the slope masterfiilly incorporated into the move- ment of the landscape; on the right bank, a cart and two riders. The young artist portrays the most unpretentious view and yet attains the greatest heights of his art.\"\"\"^ Mielke stresses the everyday character of the view, which lacks a dominant motif — a departure from most earlier drawings. He notes the extraordinary variety of Bruegels touch in both this work and in Southern Cloister in a Valley (cat. no. i), ranging from the lively calligraphy of the fore- ground scrub to the stenography of minuscule ticks and hooks that describe the trees near the summits of the dis- tant mountains. River Landscape is also remarkable for its 16 Fig. 12. Pieter Bruegel the Fig. 13. Michelangelo. Detail, Elder. Detail, cat. no. 107, The Sacrifice of Noah, 1508-12. The Beekeepers Fresco. Sistine Chapel, Vatican City reticence, for the broad, empty expanses of river and open sky. The detail in the trees at the center left is extraordinary, their minutely stippled outlines admitting the light, with a few longer but still brittle strokes providing shadow and mass. The anatomy of the rocky slopes is perceptible beneath their coats of vegetation, and the whole view is unified in a relentless movement, curving toward distances that our eyes strain to fathom. Such drawings must have been executed directly from nature (in contemporary Dutch, naer het leven)^ and it was through such diligent study that Bruegel became equipped to conjure up from his own imagination (uit den gheest) visionary landscapes such as Wooded Landscape with Mills and Landscape with Fortified City (cat. no. lo). Both were produced during his Italian journey and are summations of his experience of nature, now transformed and distilled by his imagination, by his creative spirit — or by his ingenium, to use a term employed at the time.^^ The large tree in Wooded Landscape with Mills, 155a, seems to buckle under its own weight. Rising from straggling roots, it spirals skyward like the funnel of a tornado, twisting and spreading out into arterial branches that snake across much of the page. Below, shielded by the tree's foliage, is a more commonplace wood- land scene of the type Bruegel could have known from such predecessors as Cornells Massys (see fig. 15), or compiled from motifs extracted from his own drawings from nature: the woodland with two hunters and a dog to the left, the house and church glimpsed on either side of the main trunk, and the row of trees marching into the distance toward the right. The determined viewer will discern more rooftops to the right of the windmill and, immediately to its left, so small as to escape attention, a loaded horse-drawn wagon, a cousin of the vehicle on the right of River Landscape, Bruegel s finished drawings never lack details of this sort, and they provide long and rewarding lessons in looking. In Landscape with Fortified City, 1553 (cat. no. 10), Bruegel created an almost limitless urban view, encircled by seem- ingly unending walls. The view stretches to a distant coast- line on the left, with a ship in an estuary. Among the multiplicity of churches, towers, fortresses, and rooftops nestled around the citadel in the center, a bridge with nine arches, each reflected in the water, spans the river. Yet the imposing metropolis appears threatened by its vast natural environment: the buildings peter out beyond the walls, the wind has picked up in the trees to the right, and dark clouds loom above the inhospitable mountains. The detail is extraordinary: toward the left a rider passes a gruesome gibbet; near the right foreground a church tower with a belfry and a raised choir rises above some light-struck trees; on the hill to the right of the city are two figures and some 17 Fig. 17.

Reproduced In reverse grazing animals represented by rectangles on stilts, an abbre- viation encountered time and again in Bruegels landscapes. Compositions like these, informed by studies of nature, are more immediate and realistic than those by BruegeFs most influential predecessors Jan van Amstel, Herri met de Bles, Cornelis Massys, and Joachim Patinir (see figs. 15, 16).^^ Theirs was the tradition into which Bruegel was born and by which he was shaped, but his almost tangible grasp of nature was a new development. His drawings bear out the assessment of Van Mander, who in 1604 famously stated: \"On his travels he drew many views from life so that it is said that when he was in the Alps he swallowed all those mountains and rocks which, upon returning home, he spat out again onto canvases and panels, so faithfidly was he able, in this respect and others, to follow Nature. \"\"\"^ These works clearly dumbfounded BruegeFs fellow artists, even in the country that prided itself on being the home of landscape. Elsewhere, Van Mander praised Bruegel as \"one of the great masters who bear the palm of honor in landscape,\"^^ in works \"that look so natural ... he teaches us to represent, without much effort, the angular, rocky Alps, the dizzying views down into a deep valley, steep cliffs, pine trees that kiss the clouds, far distances, and rushing streams.\"^' How did Bruegel formulate such a vision of nature? For part of the answer we must turn, as he did, to Italy. Con- trary to widely held belief, Bruegel had much to learn south of the Alps. From the time of Van Eyck until the death of Raphael in 1520, the tide of influence in landscape had swept largely from Flanders to Italy, but from the mid- sixteenth century there were currents moving in the oppo- site direction.^^ Bruegel was among the first Northerners to absorb the lessons in compositional presentation, variety of texture, and atmospheric perspective that had been so suc- cessfully developed by Italian painters since Leonardo. For the poetic plausibility of his designs, the breadth and reach of his lines, and the balance of his compositions, he was indebted to Titian and to the Venetian painter s acolyte Domenico Campagnola (1500-1564). In 1554 Bruegel even drew a free version of a composition by Campagnola (fig. 17, cat. no. 13),^^ rethinking Campagnolas distant vistas, adding in his own style a river between cliffs at the left (with one of his insect-like animals grazing in the middle 19 Fig. i8. Federico Barocci. Landscape. Pen and brown ink with brown wash heightened with white on blue paper. Kunsthalle, Hamburg distance) and a church approached by travelers on the right, and enriching the foreground with vegetation and everyday figures; some of the figures are walking, while two others — a man and a woman — take a rest and choose fruit from a basket. This reinterpretation speaks volumes about Bruegels reaction to his Italian model. A fiall-fledged mas- ter, he felt secure enough to resist mere imitation, selecting from Campagnola only the general compositional plan. The Italians method of hatching in broad parallel curves is seen in Bruegels drawing below the central copse of trees and in the lower left foreground, by the river. This was an element that Bruegel had already made his own, however (see cat. nos. 2, 10).^'^ The verso of the copy after Campagnola bears the begin- nings of a sketch, which afford a rare glimpse of Bruegel initiating a new design.^^ The sketch is related stylistically to another Italianate drawing of 1554, the recently discov- ered Wooded Landscape with a Distant View toward the Sea (cat. no. 14). Here, on blue, probably Venetian, paper Bruegel produced a landscape comparable to the rare exam- ples by his contemporary Federico Barocci (see fig. 18).^^ The medium of the two drawings is identical, the scale similar, and the style surprisingly close — from the flowing lines in the tree trunks to the white stippling in the foliage. Fig. 19. Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Bears in a Wood, ca. 1554. Pen and brown ink with black chalk. The British Museum, London 20 That this is no isolated case is shown by a comparison of Bmegels drawing Bears in a Wood (fig. 19) with Barocci s Landscape with the Stigmatization of Saint Francis (fig. 20).^'' Here, again, Bruegel employs ink and white heightening on blue paper in a composition that has strong links with Barocci s scheme. When a few more contemporary landscapes are added to our survey, Bruegel falls into context. A drawing by Campagnola of about 1516 (fig. 21) depicts a mountain town and an approaching storm, much like Bruegels 1553 Land- scape with Fortified Cityf' an autograph sketch by Titian evinces analogies with Bruegels penmanship (fig. 22).^^ As the eighteenth-century connoisseur of drawings Pierre-Jean Mariette stated, \"some of these landscapes drawn with the pen [by Bruegel] . . . would not be disavowed by Titian.'*\"^® Thus, despite Bruegels reputation for robust independence, his landscapes harmonize with the traditions of his day. Art history has been so compartmentalized into the study of different national schools that similarities between Fig. 20. Federico Barocci. Landscape with the Stigmatization of Saint Francis. Pen and brown ink with brown wash height- ened with white on blue paper. The British Museum, London them can seem surprising.\"^^ Yet such transnational features confirm that Bruegels Italian journey led to an enthusias- tic artistic exchange with his Southern colleagues, at least in the field of landscape.\"^^ Whether Bruegel influenced Barocci, or Barocci Bruegel, is not the point. Rather, it is clear that the enriched textures of Bruegels landscape drawings evolved in Italy and that they conform to interna- tional stylistic norms. This is equally true of their iconog- raphy: the landscape is transformed into an idealized arena within which figures and animals are pitted against nature, and the transitory, insubstantial works of man against God's durable creation,\"^^ Thus was landscape conceived and inter- preted throughout Europe. Peculiar to Bruegel within this tradition, however, are his awe-inspiring details: horsemen and carts, rooftops and belfries, and even fruit in baskets, to recall but a few of those mentioned above. Neither the Venetians nor Bruegels Northern masters had paid such heed to the par- ticular, preferring to emphasize the unifying flow of their Fig. 21. Domenico Campagnola. Landscape with a River before a Mountain, ca. 1516. Pen and brown ink. Teylers Museum, Haarlem 21 Fig. 22. Titian. Landscape with a Fortified Castle, ca. 1525-30. Pen and brown ink. Musee Bonnat, Bayonne compositions. In this attention to detail Bruegels work is related to traditions of manuscript illumination and minia- ture painting, arts in which he was certainly versed. Bruegel not only married, in 1563, the daughter of the miniature painter Mayken Verhulst, who was described in 1567 by Guicciardini as one of the four principal female artists living in the Low Countries;\"^ but while in Rome Bruegel also col- laborated with the miniaturist Giulio Clovio (1498-1578), who collected Bruegels work. The inventory of Clovio s possessions drawn up at his death lists \"a small miniature painted half by himself and half by Pieter Bruegel,\" a small \"Tower of Babel'^ painted by Bruegel on ivory, a \"View of Lyons'* (Leon diFrancta) in gouache, two other landscapes, and a gouache study of trees.'^^ Sadly, all these works are lost. Yet there are still conclusions to be drawn from this documentation. Vasari s life of Clovio opens Fig. 23. Giulio Clovio. Detail, fols. 66-67, Farnese Hours: Landscape, ca. 1535-39. Gouache. The Pierpont Morgan Library, New York 22 with the statement: \"For many centuries, and perhaps for yet other centuries, there has been no more excellent illumi- nator or painter of small things than Giulio Clovio, who has far surpassed all others in this exercise. Clovio s rep- utation was barely inferior to Titian s or Michelangelo's and was already secure a full decade before Bruegels arrival in Italy. That the young Fleming should collaborate with the prince of illuminators even on a small miniature is reveal- ing in the context of the detailed execution of Bruegels finished drawings. The lost gouaches may also have been miniatures or illuminated leaves, and it is logical to suppose that Bruegel had received some training in this art. Scholars have attempted to identify Bruegels hand among the land- scapes in Clovio s masterpieces of illumination, but the attributions are unlikely, given the similarity of the periph- eral views in much earlier manuscripts by Clovio himself (see fig. 23).'^'' Yet this investigation into Bruegels role indi- cates once more how his landscapes meld with those by his Italian contemporaries. Bruegels subsequent landscape drawings rarely deviate from the patterns set in Italy. The two surviving Large Landscapes from among those published by Cock in 1555 (one of which is cat. no. 21) the sketchier Rabbit Hunt ior Bruegels only autograph etching, of 1560 (cat. nos. 81, 82), and even the late compositions Spring (cat. no. 105), The Beekeepers (cat. no. 107), and Summer (cat. no. 109) retain Italian links, despite Bruegel's evolution (in the last-named three drawings) of a less panoramic setting. In the late works the forms and atmosphere dissolve into a range of dots, with a \"grainy, frothy characterization of ground and trees,\"\"^^ pro- ducing optical effects that were taken up by the so-called Master of the Mountain Landscapes and by Roelandt and Jacob Savery (cat. nos. 120-34) and by Dutch landscape painters in the seventeenth century. Bruegels drawings from nature appear so fresh and skillful that they have been taken as evidence of his origi- nality (fig. 10, cat. no. i). Here we need to be cautious. Few such sketches survive from before his time, and it has recently been argued that they were especially vulnerable to loss. Made for practice and as mere records of landscape rather than as developed \"works of art,\" and often slight, they were of no value either to collectors or to other artists, who could make such drawings themselves. As a rule, only the most elaborate might be preserved and, as with Bruegel s drawings, prized enough by the artist for him to sign them. Both north and south of the Alps, the practice of drawing from nature was widespread throughout the sixteenth century,^° and a vast number of landscape sketches, by hundreds or even thousands of artists, must have been destroyed. The extant groups of landscape draw- ings by the so-called Anonymous Fabriczy (an artist close to Bruegel in style), by the Master of the Errera Sketch- book, and, even earlier, by Fra Bartolommeo (see fig. 24)^^ are exceptional. Moreover, Bruegels, and even Fra Bar- tolommeo s drawings are not widely separated in style or composition from landscape sketches made in the seven- teenth century, or even later.^^ Although our modern enthusiasm for them would have seemed almost ridiculous in Bruegels time,^^ we continue to admire these informal drawings, with their suggestions of light and distance, both as works of art in their own right and as precursors of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape Fig. 24, Fra Bartolommeo.

Because of the immense losses in this branch of art, we cannot easily claim that Bruegel was a pioneer in the genre, a landscape sketcher who altered the course of the history of art.^\"^ Such assertions have been made but result partly from a concern to bolster the uniqueness of an artist whose chief claims to originality, however, lie elsewhere. But compared with the few other works of the kind known from his time — in particular, with those associated with the Mas- ter of the Small Landscapes (cat. nos. 135-144) and those by the Master of the Errera Sketchbook, which employ the same media (see figs. 25, 26)^^ — Bruegels sketches are of remarkable quality Nevertheless, like his composed land- scapes, they conform to the styles practiced by many artists of his period. The miracle is that some, if only a few, have survived; and as rare examples of their type, their claims to \"originality\" have seemed all the more plausible. Finally, there are four landscapes by Bruegel that stand apart from those described thus far. Three (including cat. nos. 4, 5) are datable to about 1552, the year in which Pastoral Landscape^ now in the Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo (cat. no. 3), is dated, and one (cat. no. 19) is thought to be from about 1554.^^ Both compositionally and stylistically, they fall between Bruegel s precise drawings from nature (see fig. 10, cat. no. i) and such richly textured and highly finished com- positions as Wooded Landscape with Mills (cat. no. 2) and Landscape with Fortified City (cat. no. 10). Despite some freedom and fluency, they surprise the viewer with their even line, their thin textures in the foliage (where, as Mielke has observed, Bruegel was wont to draw flourishes that resemble the number 3, written many times over),^^ ^sid their flatter modeling. Equally divergent from the norm is Landscape with a Group of Trees and a Mule (cat. no. 17), which transmits, as do few drawings by any artist, a sense of the speed, purposefiilness, and energy with which it was set down. In this case, however, although the composition appears more or less fixed, the style is that of a preliminary sketch for a more finished work.^^ Thus this drawing does not entirely belong with the four mentioned above. Of critical importance is the stylistic relationship between these four drawings and those by Peeter Baltens (1527-1584). In Baltens s Landscape with Rider and Shepherd (fig. 27)^^ we again encounter the traits that we have described: the even, fluid, and somewhat incoherent lines and flatter modeling. Bruegel is first documented in 155 1 24 Fig. 26. Master of the Errera Sketchbook. Fol. 29, Tree, ca. 1530-40. Gouache.

Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, Graphische Sammlung Fig. 28. Detail, cat. no. 48. Luxuria (Lust) as Baltenss collaborator on the altarpiece for the glove makers' guild in the cathedral of Saint Rombout in Meche- len.^' Could Bruegel have been working as Baltens s assis- tant following his training with Coecke? Van Mander praises Baltens as \"a very good landscape painter, who followed very closely the manner of Pieter Brueghel and also handled the pen very cleverly.\"*\"^ Van Mander s chronology is unreliable, however. He states that Baltens joined the Antwerp painters* guild only in 1579,^^ when in fact he was enrolled as a youth in 1540. In the Mechelen project he was charged with painting the central, colored parts of the altarpiece, and Bruegel with the grisaille wings, assignments that imply that Baltens was the more established figure. Thus he may well have influenced Bruegel's first landscape drawings, which would necessitate redating the Pastoral Landscape group. This would make them Bruegels earliest surviving works, and it would mean that Wooded Landscape with Mills (cat. no. 2), was Bruegels first landscape to respond clearly to Italian models, a response that becomes more evident in 1553 and 1554 (see fig. 19; cat. nos. 10, 11). It appears unlikely that Bruegel made his most Baltens-like draw- ings only after he had begun to develop his style in this Italianate direction. Fig. 29. Detail, cat. no. 46. Superbia (Pride) Antwerp and Brussels: The Allegorical Drawings After returning from Italy to Flanders in 1554 or 1555, Bruegel was initially still preoccupied with landscape, and the set of twelve Large Landscapes engraved after his designs was published in Antwerp by Cock in 1555 (cat. nos. 22-34). But he soon concentrated on allegorical designs, many of them in the style of Bosch. Bosch s popularity had not diminished since his death in 1516.^'^ Collectors of his works included Mencia de Mendoza, marquesa de Cenete, in Guadalajara (she was the third wife of Count Hendrick III of Nassau, who probably commis- sioned The Garden of Earthly Delights); Domenico and Marino Grimani in Venice; the Portuguese humanist and traveler Damiao de Goes; and, later, Philip II of Spain, Cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle (Bruegels patron, too), and Emperor Rudolf II in Prague. In sixteenth-century art literature, Bosch is mentioned by Marcantonio Michiel, by Vasari in both the first (1550) and the second (1568) editions of his Lives of the Artists, and by Felipe de Guevara and Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, as well as by the authors who wrote about Bruegel — Guicciardini, Lampsonius, and Van Mander. This enthusiasm must have sparked Cock into perceiving a market for prints after Boschs designs and into commission- ing Bruegel to produce new ones in the same vein.^^ 26 Bosch was the first of four old masters who have always been celebrated for \"fantasies, bizarre things, dreams, and imaginations,\" to quote Vasari again. The others are Bruegel and, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Blake and Goya. Bosch and Bruegel, however, left no draw- ings that catch them in the very throes of inventing their visions. We must largely content ourselves with the two earlier artists' final compositions, and they make Bruegel's dependence on Bosch abundantly clear. As we turn from Bruegels landscapes to his allegorical drawings, the change in style, even in passages depicting nature, is as marked as the change in iconography. It is as if we are faced by another artist. The trees in Desidia {Sloth) (cat. no. 52), far from bearing the \"airily stroked roofs of foliage\"^^ that character- ize even Bruegels most finished landscape drawings, jetti- son their leaves, and their branches turn to coral. These subaqueous qualities mark even the tree on the left of the most naturalistic scene. Ice Skating before the Gate of Saint George (cat. no. 62). Abandoning the lessons he had learned in Italy, Bruegel transmogrifies everything into symbols and ciphers from an allegorical world. Boschs influence is strongest in Bruegels Seven Deadly Sins (cat. nos. 42-54), the drawings for which are dated 1556-57, while the prints came out in 1558. It echoes through Bruegels later designs, less in The Seven Virtues of 1559-60 (cat. nos. 64-77) ^'^^^ ^^^^ Judgment of 1558 (cat. no. 56), The Descent of Christ into Limbo of 1561 (cat. no. 87), The Fall of the Magician Hermogenes of 1564 (cat. no. 102), and several other designs now known only through prints (for example, cat. nos. 95, 113-115). The Calumny ofApelles (cat. no. 104), despite its relationship to a wide Renaissance tradition of representing this subject, also nods to Bosch in its configuration. Bruegels mastery of his predecessor's idiom is complete, and his emulation frequently runs to direct quotation: the prostrate reptile at the lower right of Luxuria (Lust) (fig. 28, cat. no. 48) and the upside-down Fig. 30. Alart Du Hameel after Hieronymus Bosch. The Last judgment, late 15th century. Engraving. The British Museum, London 27 frog on the background mountain of Superbia (Pride) (fig. 29, cat. no. 46) are both from Boschs Last Judgment^ which was engraved in Bosch s time by Alart Du Hameel (fig. 30) and repubUshed in the mid-sixteenth century.^^ Such borrowings are numerous; but not for Bruegel the slav- ish imitation or self-conscious inclusion of isolated motifs that we find in works by earlier imitators of Bosch, such as Jan Wellens de Cock (Hieronymus Cocks father), and Jan Mandijn (ca. 1500-ca. 1560), and Peter Huys (ca. 1519- 1584) 7*^ Bruegel, rather, along the lines of Van Manders description of his treatment of the Alps, swallowed Bosch whole and regurgitated his spirit with the freedom of a maestro. Yet however much The Seven Deadly Sins were the product of Bruegels own imagination, and even though Boschs depictions of the seven sins are less fantastical,'^^ Bruegels debt to Bosch is unsettling. Modern writers have sought to stress Bruegel s uniqueness (a quality necessary to every hero) and to excuse his indebtedness by citing con- cepts of emulation that were current in the art theory of his time. But as we have seen, Bruegels dependence was immediately recognized — he was the \"second Hieronymus Bosch,\" as Guicciardini named him. Bruegel, as we must acknowledge, was playing the tunes that his audience wanted to hear. His resurrection of Bosch was a strategy, perhaps initiated by Cock, for reaping the financial rewards of commercial success. Fantastical as many of BruegeFs creations are, the very fact that Bosch had paved the way creates a sense almost of familiarity, like approaching Brahms after Beethoven or Schiller after Shakespeare. To be sure, Bruegel refreshed his inheritance, from the reptilian monsters to the precarious rocks and organic architecture. Yet his vision is less out- landish, less outre, than Boschs. Perhaps this increases the power of Bruegels images: the perspectives and human ele- ments are plausible enough to induce powerful projections in the viewer. They reflect scrutiny not only of Bosch but also of mankind, incorporating incisive observations of expression, gesture, and movement. From Anger to Sloth, from Envy to Pride, Bruegel commands every gradation. The allegorical drawings lack the stylistic variety of Bruegels landscapes. The outlines are solid, the details are less suggestive, and textures are differentiated only rudimentarily. The sense of chance is diminished. These characteristics remind us that the drawings were merely a means to an end, serving as cartoons or templates for engravers who could wrest only a limited range of effects from their copperplates.^^ Their uniform qualities were dictated by their role in the technology of printmaking and were subsequently increased by the printmakers who had to indent the outlines with a stylus in order to transfer them to the copperplates, a process that leaves its mark on the sheets. Among Bruegels first efforts in this vein was Big Fish Eat Little Fish (cat. no. 39). Its publication in 1557 with the legend Hieronymus Bos inuentor — though Bruegel signed the preparatory drawing for the print and dated it 1566 (cat. no. 38) — has led some to suggest that Cock simply exploited Boschs name and suppressed Bruegels for com- mercial reasons. Yet Mielke considers this unlikely, not least because Cock had already credited Bruegel with the designs for The Large Landscapes published in the previ- ous year (cat. nos. 22-34).'^^ In addition, several motifs in Big Fish Eat Little Fish^ such as the pointing man in the boat and the structure atop the rock in the distance, seem more typical of Bosch than of Bruegel. Thus the print may well depend on a lost prototype by Bosch, with Bruegel merely providing the engraver, Pieter van der Heyden, with a template. This of course he had already done, not only for The Large Landscapes but also in 1556 for The Temptation of Saint Anthony (cat. no. 37). This first print by Bruegel in the Bosch mode credits only its publisher, Cock, and the design is ascribed to neither artist. The drawing (cat. no. 36) is manifestly by Bruegel, though, again, an invention by Bosch may have lain behind it. Uniquely among Bruegels drawings for prints, the composition is not reversed in the printing, and its outlines are not indented, indicating that the engraver resorted to another method to transfer it to the plate. Perhaps dissatisfied with the print, Bruegel thereafter always provided directly transferable drawings in reverse. In 1557 came not only Big Fish Eat Little Fish but also prints of Patientia (Patience) (cat. no. 55) and The Ass at School (cat. no. 41). For the latter the drawing survives in good condition (cat. no. 40). It employs the mature style that characterizes all Bruegels designs for the engraver. There is an element of pedantry in the detail, in the unin- terrupted outlines and fastidious cross-hatching. Nothing 28 Fig. 31. Detail, cat. no. 68. Prudentia (Prudence) is left to chance, from the carpentry of the four-legged stool to the bars in the basket-weave enclosure shielding the woman/^ and the engraver (in this case, Pieter van der Heyden once again) had only to replicate each line. His fidelity is extreme: the idiot expressions, the bees and alpha- bets, the cracks in the plaster are all impeccably duplicated. The print even enhances the wood graining and the legi- bility of the letters prepared for the teacher s inspection. But as with all copies, the prints are harsher and less subtle, making us return, time and again, to the original drawings. Here we sense ourselves closer to Bruegels spirit, a circum- stance of which the earliest collectors and the artist himself must also have been conscious, as the sheets are inscribed in unreversed letters in acknowledgment of their status as independent works of art7^ The drawings detain us with a plethora of details and demand patient, reflective viewing/^ They could hardly be further removed from our age of the quick sound bite and the instant gratification, but the rewards are almost endless. Desidia (Sloth) may serve as an example. There are many distinct areas to absorb, arranged around the key central figure of Sloth herself She has three snails around her and reclines on her symbol, the ass (also asleep). Her head is doubly supported: on her hand in the traditional gesture of Melancholy, husband of mental sloth, and on a pillow held by a devil, for \"Sloth is the Devils pillow.\" Moving clock- wise from the lower left, the viewer encounters a man in bed fed by a bear and perambulated listlessly by a skeletal being; lethargic pupils in a schoolroom attended by three demons who offer another comforting pillow; a vacuously cawing bird near an idle boot that fails to rouse either a night owl or a couple in bed; and the movement of a clock. Above the clock a prostrate man redundantly hammers a bell that has its own clapper, an act of folly itself, but his action stirs no one; strings are attached to additional bells in the branches of a tree rising through the roof of a neg- lected and dilapidated edifice. In the ruined rafters are a nest and an ax, and gaming dice lie unused on a table. In the far distance two animals stand stranded on barren ter- rain, with a rider on a slug beneath them. Below this, a miller — a yawning, somnolent giant — defecates only after prompting (he is \"too lazy to shit,\" as a Dutch saying goes); his waste is collected in a boat within his mill, and his urine fills a bottle suspended nearby. At the upper right, the slow hand of time, its housing in flames, points to the \"eleventh hour\" while a group of idlers looks on. Below them a figure in a grotesque chariot is helped by devils to the river (the Lethe?), watched by a couple kneeling on a dead, multi- clawed fish, above an empty boat drawn up on a lifeless shore. A demonic carpenter yawns and saws into the turf (producing, one imagines, a snoring sound). A fat, immo- bile bird squats on a tree; in an opening in the trunk, an obese, slothful pig feeds on a thistle, too lazy to search for superior provender (another plant grows in the center); and a monstrous biped, its knife stashed in its hat, drags along its rooted body. The inscription below tells us that sloth makes the sinews dry and powerless, so that man becomes fit for nothing. Many hours are required to absorb the prolixity of Bruegels imaginative details in The Seven Deadly Sins. In the series's counterpart. The Seven Virtues of 1559-60 (cat. nos- 64-77), Br^egel produced a more naturalistic vision, for virtue has its place on earth. Only Fortitudo (Fortitude) (cat. no. 74) retains its Hieronymosities, as the armies of sin are driven into the pit. The central allegorical 29 figures with their symbols also possess a clear relationship to their countertypes in The Seven Deadly Sins. Although the drawings of the Virtues remain diagrammatic, their increased naturalism provides glimpses of Bruegels abilities as a landscapist, notably in the backgrounds of Caritas (Charity) (cat. no. 66), Prudentia (Prudence) (cat. no. 68), Spes (Hope) (cat. no. 70), and Fortitudo (Fortitude) (cat. no. 74). The individual vignettes are bound together in more unified spaces. In Fides (Faith) (cat. no. 64), for example, the hoods flow like a tide through the worshipers, balanced by a diagonal thrust that unites the marriage ceremony with the celebration of Holy Communion to the right. After being turned upside down, the world regains an even keel, and virtue resides even in such everyday activities as the salting and pickling of meat (in Prudentia [fig. 31, cat. no. 68]).79 In other drawings the realism increases, as in Ice Skating before the Gate of Saint George (cat. no. 62), Kermis atHoboken of 1559 (see cat. no. 80; fig. 55), View of the River Scheldt near Antwerp (fig. 95), Spring (cat. no. 105), and Summer (cat. no. 109), and The Beekeepers (cat. no. 107). For all their alle- gorical implications, and despite the Michelangelesque monumentality of the figures in The Beekeepers^ Bruegel returns to depicting a world we can enter. The Corpus as Fragment Mielke s catalogue raisonne of Bruegels drawings describes sixty-one autograph sheets and six more known through copies. Of these sixty-seven items, thirty-five are finished designs for engravers. Eighty-four prints were published (not counting those after paintings or produced posthu- mously), so forty-nine design drawings are missing. They would have resembled the highly elaborated templates we have seen, works of the type that were most likely to appeal to early collectors of drawings and therefore to survive. This preference is articulated in a well-known letter of February 12, 1579, from Joris Hoefnagel to Niccolo Gaddi in Florence, stressing the desirability of an album contain- ing \"beautiful, finished, perfect drawings . . . drawings of importance and finished.\"^'' For these, at least, there was a market. Given the complexity of Bruegels designs, he must have rehearsed them in rougher sketches. But among drawings of this character only The Rabbit Hunt (cat. no. 81) can be related to a finished work; the drawing is preparatory to the one print that Bruegel etched himself (cat. no. 82), so that a more detailed cartoon was probably never made. None of Bruegels few outdoor sketches was referred to directly in a completed composition, though, as we have seen, Van Mander wrote that \"he made many drawings from nature.\" We would like to know how many, as at most only six of those known appear even remotely to belong in this category. We can assume that there were many more, as Van Mander stresses Bruegels commitment to this type of work, stating that \"he used to make fine and pure sketches of landscapes from nature in pen.\" Bruegels study of the Alps must have been thorough, and he probably filled several sketchbooks with Alpine views. Now we have none, as both River Landscape (fig. 10) and the Southern Cloister in a Valley of 1552 (cat. no. i) are thought to have been made in Italy. Yet the degree of naturalism in Bruegels prints inspired by Alpine scenery lends credibil- ity to Van Mander s assertion. For his figures, Bruegel also presumably studied individual models from life, but we have only The Bagpipe Player (cat. no. 98), The Gozzard (Staatliche Kuntsammlungen Dresden), and the group of figures together on a single sheet in the Louvre. Surely Bruegel made many more such drawings. Most depressing of all is the lack of a single sketch for any of his paintings. Yet writers have hinted that they are based on drawings, and the recent revelation (through infrared reflectography) of firm drawn outlines under the paint surface has prompted the suggestion that Bruegel made full-size car- toons as well as preliminary drawings. His paintings and other compositions abound in details that an artist would have sketched before attempting to incorporate them in a finished work — fishing nets, toys, musical instruments, church towers, city gates, carts, hoists and scaffolding (for The Tower of Babe!) y rocks, mules, chickens, and owls. And where are the drawings of seagoing galleons, of which Bruegel made a series of ten prints (cat. nos. 89-94) and which he depicted in the paintings The Fall of Icarus (Musees Royaux des Beaux- Arts de Belgique, Brussels) and The Bay of Naples (Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome)^^ and the print Naval Battle in the Strait of Messina (cat. no. 85)? Another statement by Van Mander gives cause for con- cern. Having correctly pointed out that many of Bruegels 30 \"strange, comical, and fantastic compositions\" were pub- lished in the form of engravings, he relates that the artist \"had still many more, neatly and carefully drawn with some captions on them, some of which he got his wife to burn when he was on his deathbed because they were too caus- tic or derisory, either because he was sorry or that he was afraid that on their account she would get into trouble or she might have to answer for them/^^^Thus the artist him- self, like Michelangelo before him,^^ initiated the destruc- tion of his own work. The sbcty-one surviving drawings (and the six copies of lost ones) can be only a pitiful fragment of a much larger corpus, yet it is impossible to know precisely how many drawings Bruegel made. Van Mander offers few clues; like all early artist- writers, he was anxious to elevate the status of his profession, concentrating on finished works and their reception by powerful patrons and referring to drawings only occasionally. With rare exceptions, drawings had Uttle intrinsic or financial value until well into the seventeenth century. As Edward Norgate noted, a drawing \"conduces to make profitable things, but is none it selfe.\"^^ That Van Mander should dwell at all on BruegeFs drawings suggests that they were known and that their quality was recognized. Drawing was the fundamental activity of the sixteenth- century artist in almost every part of Europe, from the commencement of his training until the end of his career; from trials of different media — pen, chalk (we know of no drawings by Bruegel in chalk), wash, colored papers — to copies after other artists* prints, drawings, and paintings; from sketches from nature and the figure to ideas for compositions and the provision of designs for execution by others — engravers, woodcutters, craftsmen, tapestry weavers, and goldsmiths, as well as other painters. Only in Venice, from the time of Giorgione, was the preparatory role of the drawing sometimes abandoned, as Vasari and other commentators relate. For most artists drawing was the cen- tral, inescapable activity — in Vasari s words, \"the father of our three arts. Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting.\"^° Bruegels surviving works may represent less than i per- cent of his original corpus of drawings. Even paintings by Bruegel have disappeared. Forty are known, but they all date from a twelve-year span; around thirty of them are from his last six years in Brussels. This seems an odd imbal- ance. Several mentioned by Van Mander no longer exist.^^ Fig. 32. Circle of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Woman Carrying a PaiL Pen and brown ink. Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam One of Bruegels set The Seasons, painted for Nicolaes Jon- gelinck but subsequently in the collection of Archduke Ernest in Brussels, is missing,^^ as are all the paintings listed in Giulio Clovio s inventory. Antonio Tronsarelli, also in Italy, owned a landscape in oils by Bruegel that was set into the binding of a luxurious album of drawings by famous, mostly Italian, masters.^^ A Crucifixion and other lost paint- ings are also recorded in documents, and most of the twelve paintings by Bruegel that were owned by Rubens in the seventeenth century have also disappeared.^\"^ Van Mander cites paintings in distemper as well as in oil paints, \"for he was most outstanding in the handling of both techniques,\" but only three are known: The Adoration of the Magi (Musees Royaux des Beaux Arts de Belgique, Brussels) (the attribution of which is uncertain). The Blind Leading the B/indy 1568, and The Misanthrope, 1568 (both Capodimonte, Naples). What chance had drawings when paintings and 31 even prints recorded in documents of the period can no longer be traced?^^ That Bruegel made many hundreds of drawings can be taken as certain; and he probably made thousands. The vast majority of the sixty-one we know are highly finished and may not have been at all typical. Van Mander speaks of Bruegels extraordinary facility as a figure draftsman, appar- ently referring to individual figure sketches, but as we have seen, these have almost all disappeared as well. There are more facts to worry us — for example, the statistic that while eighteen copies are known after the surviving sixty- one original drawings, there are as many as ten after the six that are known only through copies. Many drawings by Bruegel have come down to us in appalling condition.^^ Could it be that a large group of drawings was irreparably damaged, a disaster from which only a few sheets were sal- vaged? Or that, like The Resurrection of Christ (cat. no. 96), they were framed and treated as independent works, which disintegrated as they were exposed to light?^^ The versos of three of Bruegels drawings are inscribed in an early hand, in red chalk, with the numbers 406, 407, and 937.^^ What were the other items in this sequence? And how could Jacob and Roelandt Savery have produced such persuasive imitations of Bruegels landscapes (see cat. nos. 126-134) unless they had access to numerous drawings? Perhaps significantly Roelandt Savery had connections with Prague, where many of Bruegels paintings were in the collection of Rudolf II and whence several made their way to Vienna.^^^ To assert that losses have occurred is not new;^^^ nor are such losses unusual. No work by Bruegels mother-in-law, Mayken Verhulst, is now known^°^ — a frequent occurrence among sixteenth- and even seventeenth-century painters. As we have seen, drawings by Van Eyck and other fifteenth- century artists are rare. Van Mander informs us that there were 150 factories producing decorative landscapes (probably mostly watercolors on canvas) in Mechelen alone in the late sixteenth century;^^3 their products have not survived. Art was an industry, and in this hive of activity, drawings formed the commonest creative activity in every studio. But 432 years after Bruegels death we are left to \"gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost\" (John 6:12). His few sur- viving drawings peer at us tantalizingly out of the darkness, and in order to regain a sense of his range as a draftsman we are forced to enlist our imaginations — to conceive of a lake on the basis of a small pond. This may be one reason why, after several previous attempts to define Bruegels corpus of drawings, a consensus has begun to emerge only in the last decade around Mielke s clear-sighted catalogue. W^hen the study of Bruegel began in earnest during the early twentieth century, many drawings were assigned to 32 Fig. 34. Hieronymus Bosch, Two Sketches of a Beasts early i6th century.
