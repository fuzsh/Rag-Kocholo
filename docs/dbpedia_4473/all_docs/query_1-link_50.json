They wanted a portrait of themselves to commemorate their service to the city, as was customary. It had to be dignified, reflecting their virtues as brave and responsible citizens, but without being stuffy and formal, like the old civic guard portraits. In those earlier group paintings, everyone appeared in the same stiff pose, and they all looked so much alike it was hard to tell one person from another. No, these leading men of the great city of Amsterdam wanted something lively and colorful to hang in their headquarters—something modern. Ordinarily, Amsterdam civic guards hired Amsterdam painters for such an important commission. The Saint George officers, however, broke with tradition. They went beyond the city limits and sought out a celebrated master painter from Haarlem. The terms of the agreement were clear: the artist was to come to Amsterdam on a regular basis, and the sixteen guardsmen would take turns posing for him in a borrowed studio. He was to be paid sixty guilders per figure. Everything should have gone smoothly. Travel from Haarlem to Amsterdam was relatively easy now that there was a canal between the two cities. The painter could take a barge or go by land along the tow path. Overnight stays in Amsterdam would be necessary, but not too much of an inconvenience. Moreover, this was an experienced painter of civic guard portraits; he had already completed three of them for Haarlem companies and was about to start work on his fourth. He could give the Amsterdam militiamen just what they were\n\n1\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nlooking for, since what they were looking for was just what they had seen in his paintings. In the end, though, it did not work out well. Things took a bad turn when, after a number of sessions in Amsterdam and making good progress on the large canvas, the painter suddenly stopped coming to the city. He refused to leave his Haarlem home and studio. It was too much trouble, he complained, and his lodgings in Amsterdam were costing him a lot of money for which he was not getting reimbursed. If they wanted the painting finished, they would have to come to him. That was certainly not the arrangement, the officers argued as they filed the first of several legal complaints against him. He could not possibly expect all of them to travel to Haarlem. Come to Amsterdam and finish the painting, they demanded, or they would have another artist finish it. Still hopeful that they could persuade the painter to resume his work, they sweetened the pot and offered him an additional six guilders per figure. By 1637, four years after the commission, negotiations had broken down completely. Much to the dismay of the Amsterdam guardsmen, Frans Hals would not budge. He was leaving more than a thousand guilders on the table, a significant amount of money for any seventeenth-century artist but especially for a man with financial problems. But he could not afford to be away from Haarlem so often, or so he said—he had apprentices to supervise, other projects to attend to, and a family to care for. He called their bluff. Let someone else finish the damn painting. It was not the first time that a brilliant but stubborn and irascible artist had aggravated a client—Michelangelo famously caused splitting headaches for the popes he served (and vice versa)—nor would it be the last; Rembrandt, a contemporary of Hals, was a difficult character, and Picasso was best avoided when he was in “one of his moods.”1 We do not know how typical such behavior was for Hals. But one thing is certain: never again would a commission from an Amsterdam civic guard company come his way. * 2\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nThis book offers a portrait of one of the greatest portrait painters in history. The name of Frans Hals may not be as familiar as other marquee names of early modern art, especially the outstanding portraitists of the seventeenth century: Velázquez, Rubens, Van Dyck, and Rembrandt. And yet, those who have seen Hals’s work in museums or in art history books will immediately recognize his style. Whether or not they know of Hals, they know “Hals”—that rough, loose brushwork, not unlike what we find in later Impressionist paintings, that when viewed up close seems like nothing but abstract daubings, but when seen from a distance so beautifully captures the well-to-do citizens of the Dutch “Golden Age.”2 It is a style like none other in the period. Rembrandt, of course, put his own mark on portraiture with a painterly manner that grew coarser over the years. One contemporary critic—the painter Gerard de Lairesse, whose portrait Rembrandt did late in his own life— complained that the paint in Rembrandt’s works “runs down the piece like shit [drek].”3 Hals and Rembrandt were likely working side by side in the same Amsterdam workshop for a brief time, and no doubt Rembrandt was impressed by what Hals, his elder by almost twenty years, was doing with paint on his panels and canvases. But there is no mistaking a Hals for a Rembrandt. Hals may have painted in what was by then a well-established tradition, but he had an approach to rendering sitters that was all his own. Over the course of a long career, more than fifty years as a master konstschilder (fine art painter),4 Hals changed people’s ideas and expectations as to what portraiture can do—indeed, what a painting should look like. A portrait by Hals, with its visible brushstrokes and bold execution, might lack fine detail and a smooth finish, but it more than made up for this with a sense of the sitter’s animated presence, captured with unprecedented energy and immediacy. Some dismissed his works as “sloppy” and “unfinished.” For others, they were fresh and cutting-edge. Connoisseurs or collectors—the Dutch called them liefhebbers; the term, derived from the word for love and used for art lovers generally, could also be translated as “amateur” (which comes from the Latin amator, lover) but without the pejora-\n\n3\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\ntive sense (in contrast with “expert”) it often carries today5—sought him out for portraits that they could proudly hang on the walls of their homes and boardrooms and impress visitors with their cultivated taste. To his contemporaries, in Haarlem and beyond, Hals was, for several decades at least, the modern painter par excellence. * Of course, I love Rembrandt. Everyone loves Rembrandt. There is a depth to Rembrandt’s portraits and anonymous head studies (au naturel or in costume) unmatched by any other painter. It has been said many times—perhaps too many times—that what makes Rembrandt’s pictures so special is that they “reveal the soul of the sitter.”6 While such a romanticized and spiritualized view of Rembrandt’s art has given way over the years to more sober, pragmatic, and historically grounded assessments of him and his place in Amsterdam’s art world, with greater attention paid to the painted surface than to the depth of depiction, still, it is hard not to be moved while standing in front of his portraits, especially his many self-portraits.7 Hals’s portraits and genre pictures also draw us in, but in a very different way—in fact, in a variety of ways. They invite, entertain, provoke, engage, tempt, amuse, and instruct; they show us a range of affects and attitudes, including pride, joy, lust, affection, wit, and intelligence. The Haarlem burghers in Hals’s paintings can be as contemplative and reflective as Rembrandt’s Amsterdammers. But the subjective penetration of a Rembrandt portrait can have the effect of creating a distance between us and its sitter. Occupied with their own thoughts and feelings, Rembrandt’s introspective characters are often not there for us. We can love and admire the magnificent painting from 1654 of Jan Six, perhaps Rembrandt’s finest portrait, but there is really no communion between Six and us; whatever he is pondering as he puts on his gloves he ponders alone. Hals’s people, on the other hand, are fully present. Even as their attention is drawn elsewhere and we fail to catch their eye, we are, so to speak, in the same place. Fortunately, we do not have to choose. It is not like the exclusive alternatives imposed upon us by the sixteenth- century Flor4\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nentine artist and writer Giorgio Vasari: Florence or Venice, disegno or colore, draftsmanship or color. (For the biased Vasari, there was no question: Disegno!) There may have been artistic rivalry and economic competition between Rembrandt and Hals. Their contemporaries who wanted to be portrayed did have to opt for one or the other (or one of the many other great portraitists in Amsterdam and Haarlem). We, on the other hand, do not have to take sides. We can enjoy the virtues, and virtuosity, of both artists. * I have long been a fan of Hals’s paintings. But my interest in actually writing about him came about, oddly enough, through my work on a French philosopher who was a contemporary of Hals and even at one time resided near Haarlem (and who makes a cameo appearance in this book). It all started with a chance encounter in Paris in the world’s largest art museum. It is a remarkable thing about the Louvre. In what can often seem to be the most popular and crowded tourist destination on the planet, it is possible to enjoy wonderful works of art, even some of the greatest paintings and sculptures ever made, in blissful solitude, as long as you avoid the big-ticket items for which visitors are willing to stand in line for hours and to which they rush immediately upon entry. Thus, alone one day in one of the museum’s rooms devoted to seventeenth-century Dutch art while the mobs with their selfie sticks rushed to see the Mona Lisa, I stood before a painting that was once labeled Portrait de René Descartes. (It was a picture with which I and other scholars of early modern philosophy were quite familiar, as it typically serves as the cover illustration for books on Descartes and his philosophy.) For a long time, the Louvre believed that it had an original portrait of Descartes by Frans Hals. However, by my visit this time, they had downgraded the work to a copy d’après Hals (after Hals). This is right, and long overdue, since the painting bears none of the trademark features of a Hals. The brushwork is smooth, even invisible, and the figure finely drawn. But then, where was the original? The best candidate, it turned out, was in Copenhagen, in the Statens Museum for Kunst: a small, very rough oil painting of 5\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nDescartes that was both undeniably a Hals and obviously the model for the Louvre portrait. My quest to understand the circumstances that gave rise to that unusual painting of a seventeenth-century intellectual celebrity—we do not have many portraits from life of the great philosophers before the nineteenth century—led me, ultimately, to write a book titled The Philosopher, the Priest, and the Painter: A Portrait of Descartes.8 This philosophical/biographical/art historical study brought together Descartes, Hals, and a Haarlem Catholic cleric named Augustijn Bloemaert, who there is good reason to believe commissioned the portrait from Haarlem’s best portraitist as a keepsake before his dear philosopher-friend departed Holland for Sweden, where he would die within just a few months. As an obsessive academic constitutionally incapable of allowing questions to go unanswered, I was unsatisfied with the relatively cursory treatment in that book that I gave Hals and the city that was his base of operations. As big a part of the story as the painter and his milieu were, it was not enough. He was too interesting a figure, and Haarlem too important a place in Dutch history and art history. There was so much more to learn, and so much more to be said: not just about his paintings, but about his family history, his training, his personal life, his profession, his clientele, and his reputation. There were no two ways about it. At some point, I was going to have to do a life of Hals, if only to satisfy my own curiosity.9 * The subject of this book is an artist, but it is not a work of art history. I offer little stylistic analysis of paintings, technical details of materials, or discussion of iconography or symbolism. I do consider some of the artistic influences upon Hals and put his work in a broader art historical context, but such matters are not a large part of the project; I leave all that kind of work to art historians, trained experts who can do a much better job of it than I can.10 This book is, rather, a biography, one that I hope tells a good historical story and gives the reader a well-drawn picture not only of Hals’s life, but also of the artistic, social, political, and religious mi6\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nlieus in which he lived and worked. As much as Rembrandt (though born in Leiden) was of Amsterdam, and Rubens (born in Germany) was of Antwerp, so Hals (born in Antwerp) was of Haarlem. His youth, his training, his business model, the tradition of portraiture that he so creatively adapted, the overwhelming bulk of his clientele, indeed everything that was familiar and important to him belonged to the city in Holland in which he spent his life from boyhood on. There are many challenges facing a biographer of Hals. Even the most basic facts are uncertain. We do not know when exactly he was born, when his family left Flanders in the southern Netherlands, when they arrived in Haarlem in Holland, and what his native religion was. There is some certainty as to the master painter with whom he trained, but even that is based on hearsay. What kind of husband was he? What kind of father? And why did he have lifelong money problems? There is, regrettably, no solid basis on which to answer these baseline biographical questions. Then there is the oeuvre. Hals painted nothing but portraits; even his temporary foray into genre painting consisted of portraitlike pictures of anonymous characters. But there is little agreement among Hals scholars on how many paintings he did and when he did them. Estimates range from just over a hundred to over three hundred panels and canvases. And forget about putting an exact year to most of his paintings; it is hard enough to place them securely in this or that decade. Really, the best that can be done for the majority of his extant works is arrange them in a rough chronological order. Even this is mostly guesswork based on biographical information about the sitters, clues in the fashions they are wearing or on stylistic assumptions. The task is complicated by the known unknowns, as well as some unknown unknowns. There are certain paintings that we know are lost; we have historical evidence of their existence, and sometimes even a visual record (in an engraved reproduction), but no longer any trace of them.11 There are many other paintings we do not know about that, if not destroyed, lie hidden away in an attic somewhere or are ruined beyond recognition. Then there is the problem of misattributions. Hals rarely signed his paintings, and when he did it was 7\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nwith a monogram. Moreover, like many master painters of his time, Hals had a workshop in which he trained pupils and apprentices, some of whom made copies of his paintings or unsigned works of their own imitating his style.12 So, in the end, there is not a lot to go on, and a lot to lead one astray. Other than the paintings, we have nothing by Hals’s own hand: no diary, no letters, no written documents whatsoever. In this, he could not have been more different from his contemporary Rubens, who left behind a wealth of professional and personal correspondence. The quantity of information on Hals pales compared even with what we know about Rembrandt;13 it is more like the spotty record we have for Vermeer (which was sufficient for John Michael Montias’s masterful study of that painter’s life and his relations).14 With Hals, the most important sources are official documents, almost two hundred of them: baptism records (but not one for Hals himself ), marriage banns, death and burial notices, estate inventories, records of auction and lottery sales, notary statements of debts and other legal proceedings, and collection holdings. These have been discovered and transcribed by Hals scholars working in the archives over the last century and a half, and conveniently compiled (although not in complete transcriptions) by Irene van Thiel-Stroman.15 (My debt to Van Thiel-Stroman’s work is evident in the large number of references to the documents in Van Thiel-Stroman 1989.) Unfortunately, and with just one exception, what we do not have are records of portrait commissions for Hals, which would provide crucial information on who his clients were and how much he charged them. So yes, there are enormous gaps in what we know, and can know, about Hals’s life and personality. Imaginative reconstruction will take us only so far. And yet, despite the obstacles, there is indeed a story to be told about this remarkable painter—a biographical story, built on the extant documents, generations of careful scholarship, and, of course, the paintings, that provides a sense of the man, a familiarity with the pictures he made and the clients he served, and an understanding of the Netherlandish society and early modern Europe within which he worked. 8\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nThe Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century was arguably the most cosmopolitan, innovative, and tolerant place in Europe. So much of what we now consider “modern” can be traced back to what the Dutch accomplished in the political, economic, military, technological, and cultural domains. These achievements are all the more remarkable given that many of them took place in a brand-new nation still engulfed in an eighty-year struggle for independence. (The American Revolution lasted a mere eight years.) From the philosophical and scientific advances of Descartes, Huygens, and Van Leeuwenhoek to the extraordinary “history” paintings, portraits, landscapes, still lifes, marine scenes, and genre pieces of thousands of artists, from the engineering feats that created land from sea to the military and mercantile maritime prowess that allowed the Dutch to compete with the other great powers of Europe—it is no wonder that the most creative period of a small but uncommonly gifted and improbably powerful territory continues to fascinate us today. At the same time, we must not romanticize, much less idealize, either the Dutch Republic or this early Enlightenment period. Europe in the seventeenth century saw great material and intellectual progress, and the arts flourished under all manner of regime. But there was also great misery brought about by political conflict, religious strife, and morally abhorrent practices, not to mention the forces of nature. People lived through what must have seemed like endless warfare. They suffered multiple outbreaks of the plague. During the so-called Little Ice Age, they endured long, unusually cold winters made even harsher by famine and economic instability. The Europeans also enslaved Africans and slaughtered indigenous peoples of the lands their armies and trading companies invaded. It was a brilliant but also cruel era, and the Dutch were no exception. This, for better and for worse, was Hals’s world. A proper portrait of his career demands putting the reader into the streets, homes, churches, headquarters, and taverns of Haarlem, the city that nurtured his art. It also requires following the difficult birth pangs of a young nation divided by political and religious allegiances and the turbulent and unpredictable Realpolitik of post-Reformation Europe. All too often, Hals himself may disappear from view. But his 9\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\npaintings, portraying the good people of Haarlem, Amsterdam, and other cities—men and women; merchants, preachers, writers, other artists; married (and sometimes unmarried) couples and whole families; town regents; the civic guardsmen who kept order in the streets; boards of governors of public institutions; laughing children and merry drinkers—are always there to remind us that he contributes as much to our image of the Dutch “Golden Age” as his more famous competitor, Rembrandt. * A number of things may be unfamiliar to readers not versed in the details of seventeenth-century Dutch life: Names: Early modern Dutch individuals typically used a patronymic as an identifying second name. Thus, Jan Pieterszoon was “Jan, Pieter’s Son,” and Lysbeth Reyniersdochter was “Lysbeth, Reyniers’s daughter.” The patronyms were conventionally abbreviated as “– sz” or “– dr”; thus, Jan Pietersz and Lysbeth Reyniersdr. As the seventeenth century progressed, it became more common to add a family name: for example, the painter Frans Pietersz de Grebber and his son Pieter Fransz de Grebber. Often that family name indicated the person’s place of origin: the painter Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem was “Cornelis, Cornelis’s son, from Haarlem.” Political organization: The Dutch Republic was a federation of provinces. There were seven provinces—Holland, Utrecht, Zeeland, Gelderland, Friesland, Overijssel, and Groningen—along with the county of Drenthe and the “generality lands,” territory owned by the Republic at large. Holland was the largest and most powerful province, which is why the Republic is often referred to (inaccurately) as “Holland.” I use the term “Holland” to refer only to the province. I use the terms “Dutch Republic,” “Republic,” and “United Provinces (of the Netherlands)” interchangeably to refer to the political entity established by the Union of Utrecht in 1579 (although the Union’s constituent provinces and borders would change over subsequent decades). On the other hand, I avoid using the unqualified, modern term “the Netherlands” to refer to the Dutch Republic (the northern Netherlands), since in the seventeenth century there were also the 10\n\niNTroDuCTioN\n\nsouthern Netherlands, the provinces that, still ruled by Spain, were not a part of the Republic. Each province had central executive, legislative, and judicial bodies. The “States” of a province was its executive body. Thus, the States of Holland governed that province. Each city in a province sent representatives to the provincial States. The Republic as a whole also had the States General, attended by representatives from each province. For most of the seventeenth century, there was also a stadhouder, or stadholder. This was a hereditary (but appointed), quasimonarchical position. The stadholder—always a member of the House of Orange-Nassau—was the political leader of several provinces at a time and the supreme military commander of the Republic’s armed forces. The dominant stadholder was the one who held the position jointly in Holland, Utrecht, Zeeland, Gelderland, and Overijssel. A city was governed by its vroedschap, or city council. From the vroedschap were appointed schepenen, who made up the board of aldermen, and four sitting burgemeesters, burgomasters or mayors. Currency: The main currency in the Dutch Republic was the guilder (in Dutch: gulden) or Carolus guilder. It was also called the florin (from fiorino d’oro, the gold coin of the Republic of Florence in the Middle Ages), and so was typically abbreviated as “fl.” One guilder was worth twenty stuivers; and a stuiver was worth about sixteen pennings. A skilled laborer in the first half of the seventeenth century would earn about one guilder per day. In terms of purchasing power in today’s currency, a guilder is generally estimated to be equivalent to about sixty US dollars/forty pounds/fifty euros.\n\n11\n\nChaPter 1\n\nExile\n\nFranchois Hals knew that it was time to leave Antwerp. Like many other residents of the city, he saw that there was no future there for him, his wife, Adriana, and their sons Frans and Joost. Daily life had become too risky, both economically and, for a large number of its citizens, personally. This once flourishing entrepôt would soon be the first major casualty of the Eighty Years’ War. The military leaders of the revolt by the northern Netherlandish provinces made sure of that, with a good deal of help from their Spanish overlords and foes. Located in the southern Dutch-speaking region of the Low Countries— in the Duchy of Brabant, close by the border with the lands of the Count of Flanders—Antwerp was by far the biggest and most cosmopolitan city in the Netherlands in the 1500s. With a population approaching eighty thousand by midcentury, it was also, after Paris (which had nearly three hundred thousand inhabitants), the second-largest urban center on the Continent north of the Alps.1 Antwerp was governed by a clique of financiers and aristocrats who oversaw an economy that made it among the richest cities in Europe. The source of its wealth was diverse: banking and money lending; international trade over a wide array of raw materials and products; manufacturing, especially textiles; and a number of small, homegrown industries—including painting and tapestry by artisans whose work was highly coveted by Europe’s elite. Antwerp was the headquarters of numerous mercantile firms, hosting business representatives and diplomatic corps from all over the Continent and beyond: not just Spain, to whose empire all of the Low Countries still 13\n\nChaPTer oNe\n\nbelonged, but Italy, Portugal, France, England, and the German, Baltic, and Scandinavian lands, as well as states and colonies in Asia and in the New World. The city’s harbors, at the estuary of the Scheldt River, saw the arrival of hundreds of ships each day, some bearing sugarcane from South America and the Caribbean to be processed in local refineries. Bulk goods— wood, wheat, and fruit— shared warehouses with luxury items, such as spices, fur, fabrics, and jewels. In the mid-sixteenth century, Antwerp was the heart of European trade, an international center of high finance and commerce open “to the merchants of all nations.”2 For just these reasons, Antwerp was also an essential component in the economy of the Habsburg Empire. Which is why the Spanish were so outraged to see it join the Dutch Revolt. * Things had been growing increasingly unsettled in the Spanish Low Countries for some time. Government from afar—even when mediated by sympathetic, locally based regents—is rarely well exercised, and never well tolerated. Antwerp and the rest of the Burgundian Netherlands— presentday Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and some of northeast France— became part of the extensive and widely dispersed Habsburg realm in 1477, when Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, who would soon be crowned as Holy Roman emperor. Maximilian and Mary had a son, Philip the Fair, who became Duke of Burgundy. After Philip’s marriage to the daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, Joanna of Castile—she was also known as “Juana la Loca,” or Joanna the Mad, a nickname she earned because of her erratic behavior, probably from mental illness3—and the death of his mother-in-law in 1504, Philip was crowned Philip I, king of Castile. He brought his sovereignty over northern territories with him to the Spanish throne. Philip did not live long after his coronation, however, and was succeeded by his son, Charles. When Charles— who, in addition to being Charles I, king of Spain, was also archduke of Austria; Charles II, Duke of Burgundy; and Charles V, Holy Roman emperor— abdicated all of his royal positions in 1556 14\n\nexiLe\n\nfor a life of monastic retreat, he divided his domains among his family. Spain, as well as Holland, Brabant, Flanders, and the other Burgundian provinces, passed to his son Philip, who reigned as Philip II, king of Spain and lord of the seventeen provinces of the Spanish Netherlands. Charles, at least, had been born in Flanders, in Ghent. He knew the Dutch language, and he knew the people. He was one of them. His son, born in Valladolid, Castile, was not. Philip was less empathetic than his father to local sensitivities and did not rule the Dutch lands with the consideration to which they had become accustomed. Subjects always regard taxation as heavy, but Philip burdened his northern provinces to an extreme, in part to finance his many wars. He also reduced local political autonomy while stationing Spanish troops in their cities and towns, and ignored rights and prerogatives traditionally enjoyed by the landed nobility and urban burghers. Of perhaps even greater consequence, the king and his governors, Catholics one and all, severely persecuted Protestants. Followers of the Reformed faith were a growing and influential minority in much of the Netherlands, much to the dismay of the Spanish court. Philip regarded these Calvinists and Lutherans as a serious threat not just to the confessional unity of his domains, but to the provinces’ loyalty to his rule. Ignoring decades of relative restraint and tolerance, Philip went so far as to institute an Inquisition in the north to root out this “foreign heresy.”4 By the late 1560s, Philip’s harsh and repressive behavior had become too much to bear. The Dutch rose up against the heavy-handed Spanish governance. William of Orange (William I, also known as William the Silent), whose Dutch lands had been confiscated by the king, led an insurgency of nobles and commoners in 1568. This first uprising did not have broad support, and it was soon put down by the forces of Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, the Duke of Alba, on behalf of the Spanish crown. The Dutch were not so easily pacified, however, and by 1572 the revolt was back on, again under William’s leadership but this time with the combined forces of Holland and Zeeland behind him. These provinces were later to be joined in the Union of Utrecht of 1579 by Utrecht, Gelderland, Groningen, Friesland, and 15\n\nChaPTer oNe\n\nOverijssel, as well as a number of Flemish and Brabantian cities, including Ghent, Brussels— and, most important of all, Antwerp. The “Spanish Fury” of 1576, when Philip’s troops, angered over their lack of pay, went on a murderous rampage against Antwerp’s citizens and set the city on fire, turned even devoted subjects against their foreign ruler. The rebellion of the Netherlandish provinces against Spain was now in full swing, although Philip was still too distracted by other military engagements, especially against the Ottoman threat in the east, to devote all his resources to putting it down. The conflict will last for decades, with major consequences for the subsequent political, economic, military, and cultural history of Europe. * Franchois Fransz Hals—Franchois, Frans’s son—was born around 1550, not in Antwerp but Mechelen, a town just to the south. His parents, our painter’s grandparents, were Frans Hals (d. 1571), a textile dyer, and Barbara de Witte, whom Frans had married in 1526.5 Around 1562, Franchois and his brother Carel went to Antwerp to find work. Soon after he arrived in the city, Franchois married a woman named Elisabeth Baten. Over the next dozen years, they had four, possibly five children: Carel (born in 1567), Clara (1569), Johannes (1572), Maria (1574), and, perhaps, another girl who was named Barbara. It may have been too much for Elisabeth, for she died in the fall or early winter of 1581, possibly while giving birth to yet another child. (Franchois’s brother Carel also married an Antwerp woman, Cornelia Wils. His fate was not a happy one: apparently an alcoholic and ne’er-do-well, Carel died bankrupt in 1581, the same year as his mother; Cornelia, who supported the couple by working as a washerwoman— there were no children— died a year later.)6 Following in his father’s footsteps, Franchois worked in Antwerp’s booming textile industry. He was employed as a droochscheerder, or cloth cutter—a job that involved using shears to make decorative patterns in material woven out of wool coming from England and Spain or linen made from imported flax. 16\n\nexiLe\n\nIt could not have been easy being a widower with four young children and trying to make a living. Within several months of Elisabeth’s death— and before April 1582— Franchois married his neighbor Adriana van Geertenryck. Adriana, a widow, was around thirty years old at the time,7 and had one or more children of her own from her first marriage to Henrick Thielmans, a tailor. It is possible that the wedding had to take place in secret. This is because between 1581, shortly after the city joined the Dutch Revolt, and 1585, when it was retaken by Spain, the Protestants were in control and Catholic services were banned, and one contemporary document—part of the census of civic guard companies made by the Spanish—indicates that Franchois was (or at least claimed to be) a Catholic.8 In April 1582, the newlyweds sold their interest in the house “Saint Jacob” on Rozenstraat that Adriana had inherited from her late husband. The buyer was Jan de la Flie, a pastry baker, who also owned the house two doors down that Franchois had been living in.9 The couple continued living on Rozenstraat in a house rented from De la Flie— either the one sold to him by Adriana or the one rented by Franchois before their marriage. This is where Adriana gave birth to their first son, Frans— named after his paternal grandfather— in 1582 or 1583. A second son, Joost, was born two years later. There is no record of either son being baptized, neither as Catholic nor as Protestant. Because their births coincided with that brief period of Protestant domination in Antwerp, Catholic baptisms were not publicly recorded, and even Protestant baptismal records from this time are not extant. The house on Rozenstraat must have been pretty full, then, with at least five other children from first marriages. The oldest of Frans’s half siblings, Carel, would have been only fifteen by the time Frans was born, and now there was a toddler and an infant. As combined households go, it may not have always been a peaceful domain; we know there was never enough money. The Hals family occupied the Rozenstraat dwelling for only a couple of years; by July 1586, there was a new tenant, Thomas van Oudendijck.10 By this point the family was probably gone from Antwerp altogether. Why did they leave so suddenly? What was so trou17\n\nChaPTer oNe\n\nbling about this great city that they, and many others, felt they had no choice but to pick up their lives and settle elsewhere? * Relations between Antwerp’s Catholic majority and its Protestant communities, made up mainly of Calvinists and Mennonites (Anabaptists), with some Lutherans, had long been strained. Periods of accommodation, motivated in part by economic interest, alternated with repression and persecution. As Protestant congregations grew in size and power— especially after iconoclastic riots in the summer of 1566, when Protestant mobs attacked Catholic churches and destroyed their “idolatrous” beelden, or images— the city’s leaders, hoping to forestall even greater unrest, but against the wishes of the Spanish governors, granted more religious freedom to Calvinists (but not to Mennonites). They allowed public worship and even outdoor preaching. What was once a tolerated underground movement became a publicly recognized denomination.11 The civic peace did not last long. Philip’s local regent, Margaret of Parma, and especially her less indulgent successor, the Duke of Alba, took various measures to restore the more repressive status quo ante and push Protestant worship back behind closed doors. But these efforts, like those elsewhere in the Dutch provinces, did little to restrain the growing number and power of the Calvinists— so much so that when the Protestants did temporarily take over the Antwerp city council, they not only banned Catholic religious services but instituted a purge of Catholics from public and ecclesiastic office, and even from the guilds. Another iconoclasm in 1581, less violent than the earlier one but fairly thorough nonetheless, emptied the local churches of many valuable images. At this point, King Philip, no longer distracted eastward by the Ottomans, could turn his full attention to the north and implement more forceful measures to put down the uprising in his Low Countries. The fight was now on for good. This was Philip’s land, Habsburg and Catholic, no matter what the locals thought. He was not about to hand it over to heretical upstarts speaking a language he did not understand. 18\n\nexiLe\n\nPhilip dispatched Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma (and Margaret’s son), to retake the rebellious Dutch provinces. After gaining control of the rest of Flanders and Brabant, Farnese finally set his army upon Antwerp. In the summer of 1584, his troops surrounded the city and blockaded the Scheldt River, which was the main waterway for its commercial traffic. The siege lasted over a year. The Dutch insurgents from the north tried to free the city and relieve the suffering of its citizens, but to no avail. In August 1585, Antwerp surrendered to the duke. Spain—and the Catholics—were back in charge of the city. This prolonged ordeal was the beginning of the end for Antwerp. Despite Farnese’s relatively gentle treatment as he restored Spanish control, Antwerp’s glory days as northern Europe’s greatest port city, a jewel in the crown of the Habsburg Empire, were over. In large part this was due to the migration from Antwerp and other southern Netherlandish cities that began with the Dutch Revolt, increased during the Spanish siege, and became a mass exodus in the years after capitulation. In this period, an estimated one hundred thousand to 150,000 people, for a variety of reasons—economic, religious, social, political, even artistic—left the Flemish lands for “greener pastures.”12 Some headed to England or the Rhineland, especially in the early years of the revolt.13 But a large number of families from Antwerp fled northward, to Holland and the other “liberated” territories, now proclaiming themselves the Dutch Republic of the United Provinces (although it would take another sixty-odd years of conflict for the Dutch to finally win their formal independence). For many of the exiles, the departure from Flanders, while under some duress, was voluntary. The motive was money. With the siege and the closing of the Scheldt estuary, Antwerp’s trade essentially came to a standstill. After the city was returned to the Spanish fold, Parma’s maritime blockade was replaced with one imposed by the Dutch. The Watergeuzen, or “Sea Beggars,” as they called themselves—essentially privateers led by the Dutch nobility— sought to choke the city and cut off an important lifeline for the Spanish provinces of Flanders and Brabant and, thereby, a crucial source of income for the Habsburg throne. Without access to the 19\n\nChaPTer oNe\n\nsea, Antwerp was isolated from practically all the international commerce on which it depended. Already weakened by the Spanish onslaught and intramural religious and political strife, the city now faced an uncertain future. Its mercantile activities and manufacturing industries were doomed as long as the Dutch war for independence continued. Families who relied especially on the textile trade— importers of wool, flax, and silk; spinners and weavers; bleachers; cloth cutters, tailors, and other artisans responsible for making garments, household cloths and linens, sails, and other items; export merchants and their agents— all knew it was time to seek their livelihood elsewhere. Antwerp’s Protestants, on the other hand, had little choice in the matter. The Spanish authorities saw no need to tolerate unorthodoxy and gave Calvinists and others four years either to convert to Catholicism or get their affairs in order and depart. If they chose the latter, they had to leave all their property behind. (Other religious minorities were likewise affected by these changes in the city’s political, economic, and confessional fortunes. Perhaps most important of all, in terms of Antwerp’s future, were the converso, or “New Christian,” families, descendants of Jews who had been forcibly converted to Christianity in Spain and Portugal. Many of them had fled the Iberian peninsula and settled in Antwerp to be further removed from the dungeons of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, which suspected that the conversions were not entirely sincere. Despite being ostensibly Catholics, these “Portuguese merchants,” as they are called in contemporary documents, also thought it wise to relocate after the Spanish recapture. Many of them had continued practicing Judaism in secret and were eager to return openly to their ancestral religion. To do so, they went to Hamburg or Venice, which had established Sephardic congregations, as well as to Amsterdam, where they would soon create a brand-new and flourishing Jewish community. The Portuguese Jews took with them their lucrative business networks, especially in the New World, further hastening the demise of Antwerp’s economy.) The clear winner of this combination of economic upheaval and religious intolerance in the southern Low Countries and the con20\n\nexiLe\n\nsequent massive emigration was the Dutch Republic. One scholar has called it a “hand-and-brain drain to the north.”14 In the last two decades of the sixteenth century, Antwerp lost almost half of its citizens— mainly to the province of Holland. * Why did Franchois Hals and his family pack up their things—at least those they were allowed to take with them—and leave? Was it for economic or religious reasons? If Franchois was in fact a Protestant who was only pretending to be Catholic when the Spanish took that census of Antwerp’s guard companies in 1585— and there would have been good, prudential reasons to dissemble on this point— then there was no question; the truth would have come out eventually, and so they had to go. They did have the option of converting to Catholicism, but in such a tense situation—war against the Dutch Protestant enemy—that probably would have worked no better to put them above suspicion for being insincere in the faith than it did for the Portuguese conversos. The Inquisition never let down its guard. But maybe Franchois really was a Catholic. After all, he married his first wife, Elisabeth, in Antwerp’s Saint Jacob’s Church; and all the children from that marriage were baptized there. One or two of those children ended up staying in or returning to Antwerp even after it reverted to Catholicism—not a wise, or even permissible, choice if they were Protestants. The family’s decision to leave is not, by itself, evidence one way or the other, since many Catholics joined the exodus, opting to abandon a city in decline. Unless some further material turns up in the archives, the question of the faith into which Frans Hals was born must remain uncertain. Regardless of their religious persuasion, the most likely reason the Hals family left Antwerp, shortly after the capitulation to the Duke of Parma and well before the four-year deadline for Protestants to leave, is that it was simply a matter of following the textile trade wherever it went. Sometime during the summer of 1586, then, Franchois Hals, Adriana, and most of the children from both of Franchois’s marriages— including two- or three-year-old Frans and his younger 21\n\nChaPTer oNe\n\nbrother Joost— left Antwerp and the southern Netherlands for good. The clan would retain connections to the city, and Frans would be known in later years as “Frans Hals of Antwerp.”15 Indeed, Hals’s Flemish origins will continue to play a significant role in his life, and especially in his art. But except for his half sister Maria, who would marry an Antwerp tailor and settle there, and possibly another half sister (Barbara), as far as we know no member of Franchois Hals’s immediate family would ever again reside in the Spanish southern Netherlandish provinces.16 There was still the question of where to go. To the northern provinces, of course, like everyone else. That is where the best opportunities were for Dutch speakers. But where? Many Antwerpers ended up in Amsterdam.17 But for someone seeking in those Dutch lands employment in the textile industry— and that is all that Franchois knew— there were really only two possibilities. Leiden had developed into a major center for the production of cloth. The Hals family, however, following many other southerners in the trade, opted for Haarlem.\n\n22\n\nChaPter 2\n\nHaarlem\n\nIn the late 1660s, Jacob van Ruisdael, an artist active in Amsterdam, began a series of paintings depicting the landscape around Haarlem, the city of his birth. The panoramic works, known at the time as Haerlempjes, are dominated by dramatic Dutch skies. Covering almost two-thirds of the canvases, the massive, billowing clouds of white and gray float over a background of varying blues (fig. 1).1 In the more muted foreground of some of the paintings, among the greens and browns of woods and meadows and framed by the shadows cast by the clouds, are bleaching fields. Long strips of linen—small, thin white lines in the paintings—are shown stretched over tawny late season grass to lighten in the sun. The woven fabric has already gone through several cycles of being washed with soap and water; treated with lye, potash, or cow dung; and, most important of all, soaked for days in buttermilk to soften. Sunlight has managed to break through the thick clouds to highlight the cloth bolts as they dry and fade in the summer air. Despite the atmospheric spectacle above and human industry below, the viewer’s eye cannot but be drawn to the center of Van Ruisdael’s paintings. There, sitting right on the distant horizon, where blue sky meets the reddish shades of a city’s rooftops, is an edifice that, while dwarfed by the heavens, is of considerable size, large enough to dominate its urban and natural surroundings. It looms over the houses around it, its onion-domed spire extending far higher than any of the nearby towers. Unlike Johannes Vermeer’s View of Delft, which presents a quiet morning by the water in front of the city’s gates, Van Ruisdael’s 23\n\nChaPTer Two\n\n1. Jacob van Ruisdael, View of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds, ca. 1670–75, Mauritshuis, The Hague.\n\nHaarlempjes do not provide much detail of Haarlem itself. You can see along the horizon an expanse of steeples, windmills, and houses that make for an impressive skyline, but almost nothing that would allow you to identify it with certainty as Haarlem— nothing, that is, except that massive structure rising above everything else: the Sint Bavokerk (Church of Saint Bavo), at this point called by the town’s Protestants the Grote Kerk (Great Church).2 A traveler in the seventeenth century, coming along country lanes like those in the paintings, perhaps approaching the city from the shore of the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem Lake) that lies between Haarlem and Amsterdam to the east, would spy the church’s roof and spire from far off, well before any other landmarks. It helped that the land around Haarlem was exceedingly flat, flatter even than most of the Netherlands. In those preindustrial days, there was little in the countryside, besides\n\n24\n\nhaarLem\n\ntrees and the occasional hillock, to keep one from seeing all the way to the horizon. * Haarlem was originally settled in the early Middle Ages, on some high ground at a bend in the Spaarne River. (The name is often taken to be a contraction of “Haar,” “lo,” and “heim,” meaning “elevated home on a forested dune.”) The meandering waters of the Spaarne afforded access to the IJ Bay and, eventually, the North Sea. The first extant mention of the town occurs in a document from the tenth century.3 Haarlem later became the seat of the Counts of Holland, and in 1245 it was granted its stadsrecht, or city right (somewhat akin to incorporation today) from Count Willem II. In 1270, after the city found itself under siege, it was fortified by walls. When these mud and wood battlements proved insufficient to contain and protect the city as it expanded over the next hundred years, they were rebuilt, with a canal moat added for good measure. During this later medieval period, Haarlem became a major mercantile hub, conveniently situated on the busy route between Leiden and Alkmaar. It was also the second most populous city in the province of Holland, after Dordrecht. (Dordrecht and Haarlem were the two oldest cities in the province, which gave their representatives to the States of Holland the honor of the right of first address at that body’s meetings.) However, by the end of the sixteenth century, Haarlem’s economic importance was eclipsed by that of Amsterdam, which had grown rapidly in size after the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and the start of the war for Dutch independence, helped along by the subsequent decline of Antwerp. At the same time, Haarlem developed into the province’s center of several notable and highly profitable industries—among them, linen. * Van Ruisdael’s “Little Haarlem Views”— whether they should be called landscapes, cityscapes or skyscapes— are somewhat misleading. The bleaching of linen, both of the yarn and the woven fabrics, took place\n\n25\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nnot right outside the city, as depicted in these works, but on the dunes and grass fields by the villages along the coast, from Egmond in the north to Katwijk further south, in the vicinity of, but still a bit of a way from, Haarlem.4 Nonetheless, the paintings reflect the pride that Haarlem took in its linen production, and the activity carried out on the coastal sands was called Haarlemmer bleek, or Haarlem bleach. One contemporary writer, Samuel Ampzing, provides a rather idyllic picture of the process in his Beschryvinghe ende lof der Stad Haerlem (Description and praise of the city of Haarlem), published in 1628: On this side of the dunes are beautiful green meadows, where the dunes lend their pure rain, that gushes out of their veins as if from a fountain; and with a sweet rustling, flows out of their breasts. This is where the linen is made white. Here the gray thread is bleached, and the weavings made to be as if snow white; and see how, again, so many youths and maidens [are] busy in their work in many forms: Here one bleaches the linen goods; there it has been pressed, covered with milk to soak away the grayness; they wash it in the tub before treating its blue skin, and rub such residue out with the fist; they rinse it out again and lay it out in the fields, and fasten it with pins and sprinkle it with silver rains of dew, until it becomes white and soft; then it is taken from the bleachery and carried back to the city.5\n\nHaarlem’s linen industry— not just the rural bleacheries themselves, but the manufacturers and merchants who oversaw the import of raw material, the weaving of fabric and the exporting of wares, whether as bolts of whole cloth or as finished goods such as clothing and household furnishing— was, by the early seventeenth century, a mainstay of the area’s economy. Quality control of the final product was overseen by the directors of the city’s weavers guild. Haarlem’s superior (and expensive) white linen, the finest and softest available, was soon in high demand throughout Europe. Garments made from Haarlem linen clothed royal and aristocratic bodies in Spain, France, England, and elsewhere; its bedsheets covered noble 26\n\nhaarLem\n\nbeds; and its tablecloths and napkins sat on many courtly tables. The Dutch themselves— at least, those who were able to afford it— could not imagine a life without fine linen. As Ampzing notes, What do you think? Should not one clothe one’s naked limbs with linen and other stuffs? How can one be clean at his meals, and have no linen goods, and have no table cloth? What? So he goes to sleep and has no linen sheets? In short, can one exist well without linen? Or do you wish that one shall stink and perish?6\n\nTo most ordinary citizens in Haarlem, the local linen, a luxury, was not only out of reach financially but out of sight, either bleaching near the North Sea dunes or, after being woven in private homes, stored inside the city’s warehouses. What the Haarlemmer on his daily rounds could not avoid, though, was the Saint Bavo Church. As it is the focal point of Van Ruisdael’s paintings, so it was the true center of the city: geographically, religiously, and, with its surrounding marketplace and proximity to the Spaarne, commercially and socially. A resident of Haarlem likely crossed the cobblestone square outside the Gothic building several times a day. Here he found fruit and vegetable sellers, cheese mongers, bread and pastry bakers, dairymen, poultry and beef farmers, fishermen, and flower merchants all hawking their wares at the top of their voices. It would have been a treacherous march through the market in wooden shoes, the stones slippery with detritus from the stalls—cabbage leaves, rotten produce, fish scales—and run-off water. If our stroller went inside Saint Bavo’s, he might have been a member of the Dutch Reformed Church on his way to prayer. Or perhaps he was meeting a friend or business partner in one of the church’s aisles or side chapels, where a private conversation could be held away from the din of the market. Or maybe he was someone out on errands, going from one end of town to the other and taking a shortcut through the church’s nave or transept. Bavo was for a long time the patron saint of Haarlem, as well as of the southern Netherlandish cities of Ghent and Lauwe. Born in 622 to a rich aristocratic family in Brabant, Bavo, after the death of 27\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nhis wife, came to realize the vanity of the pursuit of worldly goods. He decided to give it all up for a life of faith and good works. After distributing his lands and wealth to the poor, Bavo took off for missionary work throughout the Low Countries. The legend relates that he eventually became a hermit and lived out his days in a forest near an abbey in Ghent. Bavo was an inspiring model of piety and perseverance to Dutch Catholics, especially those in Haarlem. This city of mixed faiths had, by the beginning of the seventeenth century, reached a tolerably peaceful religious modus vivendi, but not without some difficult years. Haarlem was not spared the kind of sectarian troubles that Antwerp and so many other northern towns experienced in the wake of the Reformation and during the long Dutch war for independence. The city’s turbulent religious affairs in the period are reflected in the changing ecclesiastic status of the structure named after its patron saint. The Saint Bavo Church was originally a Roman Catholic church, its earliest parts dating to the late fourteenth century.7 It was commissioned as a cathedral in 1559 by Pope Paul IV and served the bishopric of Utrecht. After the province of Holland took the lead in the Dutch Revolt, in 1572, Haarlem was put under siege by the Spanish; the foreign forces were abetted by civic guard soldiers from Amsterdam, which alone of Holland’s cities was still loyal to the distant crown. The blockade lasted until July 1573, with the citizens suffering all the physical hardship and plunge in morale that a sustained military assault brings. A brief but failed effort at resistance and a largely unsuccessful attempt at iconoclasm of Saint Bavo’s by Haarlem’s Protestants only exacerbated the misery. When Haarlem finally surrendered to the Spanish that summer, Philip’s exhausted but voracious army sacked the city. The soldiers plundered homes and carried out violent reprisals against the citizens, including beheading the leaders of the resistance and drowning many of their followers in the Spaarne. To make sure his defeated Dutch subjects got the message, the king, as was his practice, levied a series of heavy financial penalties. He also directed his agents to\n\n28\n\nhaarLem\n\nrestore, and protect, the city’s Catholic character. In Saint Bavo’s, religious imagery that had been removed by Calvinists (as well as by Catholics, for safekeeping)—altarpieces, paintings, statues—were returned to their proper places. Still, if Philip’s goal was to ensure Haarlem’s future as a loyal Catholic possession, his campaign was a failure. When the Spanish troops withdrew a few years later, broke and demoralized after an unsuccessful assault on Alkmaar, the Protestants did not waste a moment.8 During the so-called Haarlemse Noon of 1578, Calvinists, while still outnumbered by Catholics, went on the attack. They took over Saint Bavo’s, forced the clergy to flee and once again emptied the church interior of its visual treasures. (To get a sense of how a Protestant iconoclasm can “cleanse” a Catholic church, one need only look at the Haarlem artist Pieter Saenredam’s paintings of the interior of Saint Bavo’s from the first half of the seventeenth century; the whitewashed, ostentatiously bare walls are devoid of any religious imagery.) The erstwhile Cathedral of Saint Bavo, now the Grote Kerk, would henceforth be a Protestant house of worship.9 Haarlem’s two main denominations eventually came to an irenic if short-lived understanding. The city leadership would remain in Protestant hands, with the Catholic bishop and his flock swearing allegiance to William I rather than Philip II. But Catholics were to enjoy equal rights, including the right to public worship. At least, such was the original plan. Within a few years, however, the comity broke down. This was in part because of immigration. Haarlem’s Protestant population swelled as exiles poured in after Spain’s reconquest of the southern Netherlands in 1585. By the end of the century, Protestants (or, at least, Protestant fellow-travelers, if not actual members of the Dutch Reformed Church) would constitute a majority in the city. But it was also due to pressure on city councils from the States of Holland, the governing body of the province— and which itself was under pressure from the Synod of the Reformed Church and its ministers—to clamp down on Catholic life and make things difficult for those Papists whose loyalty to the Dutch Republic was suspect. Already in 1583, the States had issued a province-wide\n\n29\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nedict forbidding Catholics even from holding public office, and it would remain in effect through the early decades of the seventeenth century. This put Haarlem in a difficult situation. It could go only so far in refusing to accommodate its Catholic population. The city’s economic life, benefiting as it did from the Flemish exodus, was too dependent on industries employing large numbers of Catholics. Still, within little more than a decade, Catholicism went from being Haarlem’s public faith to being only a tolerated religion. The city may have been more open to Catholics than other Dutch municipalities; and, as the historian Jonathan Israel puts it, the practice of Catholicism “retained more vitality” there than elsewhere in Holland.10 Various Catholic life-cycle events that were outlawed in other cities were allowed to continue, albeit with some discretion. Catholic priests were permitted to carry out baptisms, and it was “perhaps more or less possible” to be married by a Catholic priest (with civil weddings for Catholics and Mennonites performed in the town hall).11 Nonetheless, despite this relatively tolerant environment, Haarlem’s Catholics now found themselves in what Israel calls an “untenable position.”12 Having lost the opportunity for everyday public worship and repeatedly denied their requests to celebrate mass and the sacraments together in a church, they had become second-class citizens reduced to holding religious services in more or less clandestine schuilkerken (hidden churches). To these gatherings in the attics and basements of private homes, the city’s Calvinist authorities at best tended to turn a blind eye.13 * By the time Franchois and family were settled in Haarlem, Calvinists had a firm grip on the city—indeed, on the whole province. Did the members of the newly arrived Hals clan join those local Catholics forced to observe their rites behind closed doors? Apparently not. Although Franchois identified himself to the Spanish as a Catholic during the 1585 civic guard census in Antwerp, perhaps as a precautionary move, the baptismal register of Haarlem’s Grote Kerk, which of course did not keep track of Catholic affairs, suggests a different 30\n\nhaarLem\n\nstory. The record book states that on March 19, 1591, “a child named Dirric [Dirck] is baptised; the father Franchois Hals, the mother Adriana Hals; the witnesses are Dirric van Offenberch, Nicolaus Snaephaen, Maria van Loo.”14 Franchois and Adriana had brought their new son to the Dutch Reformed Church for his christening. Dirck would be the first member of the family born in Haarlem and the first to be baptized in the city’s dominant faith. This baptismal record is also the earliest extant evidence of the presence of Franchois, Adriana, and their children in Haarlem. We do not know where the family first lived in the city. Despite the great influx of south Netherlanders in the final decades of the seventeenth century, there was no housing shortage in Haarlem. The rebuilding that took place after the great fire of 1576 destroyed hundreds of buildings, a conflagration started by Spanish shelling, made sure of that. Moreover, the city now owned ecclesiastic properties— monasteries, cloisters, chapels—that had once belonged to the Catholic Church, and made them available to house ordinary citizens. Haarlem was well prepared to accommodate the large number of immigrants. Franchois and Adriana managed to rent something, but it was certainly not in Haarlem’s more upscale district. It is not that they were destitute. Their departure from Antwerp, coming well before the five-year deadline, was likely voluntary and not especially hasty. This must have left them time to gather their property (or at least as much of it as they were allowed to take), sell some things, and secure their affairs. Still, there is reason to believe that not all was well financially. They had trouble meeting their most basic obligations. In February of 1599, we find Franchois and Adriana paying a visit to a notary’s office. They were hoping to come to agreement with Jan Pietersz, a cattleman and butcher who had sold them half an ox at a recent Saint Luke’s fair. They still owed him thirty-seven guilders and two stuivers, and Jan Pietersz was after them to pay the balance. In their testimony, Franchois and Adriana thank Jan Pietersz for his patience— he could have pressed them for payment much earlier— and, with witnesses present, “confer into his [Jan Pietersz’s] hands . . . all their furniture goods” and tell him that he may do with 31\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nthem as he likes.15 We do not know whether the meat merchant actually took possession of the Hals’s property or only used it as collateral until they paid up, but the affair does reveal that the family was, at the time, not quite flush with funds. Franchois was at least gainfully employed in Haarlem’s textile trade. In documents from this period—where he is identified as “Franchois Hals van Mechelen”—he is again called a droogscheerder (cloth cutter) or, occasionally, a lakenbereyder (cloth preparer). He must have found a position doing just the kind of work he had been doing back in Antwerp, only now in a city where that industry had a bright future. Franchois seems even to have gained some standing in the community, as he was asked in June of 1592 to serve as a witness on behalf of one Huybrecht de Wit, a fellow cloth dresser. Huybrecht wanted to be released from his promise of marriage to Tanna Sweenen, whom he had asked to marry him when he was “light-hearted and drunk.” Franchois and the other witness swore, before the notary, that they heard Tanna release the inebriated romantic from his vow.16 It would not have been difficult in Haarlem to get work, especially for a skilled cutter like Franchois and with the city’s rapid expansion and economic growth. The first wave from the south arrived in 1578, mostly Mennonites from Kortrijk (Courtrai) fleeing persecution by Catholics. The more substantial immigration of Protestants occurred between 1585 and 1590, in the wake of the Spanish reconquest and expulsion edict. Between 1575 and 1600, Haarlem’s population almost doubled, with over half of the city’s now thirty thousand residents being Flemish émigrés.17 Still, the situation for Franchois might have been a little competitive, since many of the refugees from the south were also textile workers—by some estimates, over six hundred of the Flemish families that settled in Haarlem by the end of the century were involved, in one way or another, in textiles. The social process of absorbing the south Netherlanders did not always go smoothly. There were, as to be expected, some tensions between natives and newcomers. Immigrants typically generate re-\n\n32\n\nhaarLem\n\nsentment and suspicion, even insecurity, among established citizens, and this was no less true in Haarlem, as we shall see. But there was room and resources for everybody. For the most part, Haarlem was perfectly happy to welcome these wealthy businessmen and skilled craftsmen. The fact that it was a religiously mixed, Dutch-speaking city with an existing infrastructure for textile manufacture and trade made the transition for the southerners relatively easy. (There may also have been mutual empathy between the two groups, since Antwerp and Haarlem had both suffered grievously under Spanish siege and occupation.) As a further enticement, the Haarlem city council, seeing the economic benefits to come, offered subsidies and land grants to Flemish arrivals. With this influx of merchants and labor, Haarlem’s linen and cloth production grew rapidly; by the end of the sixteenth century, it was the city’s second-largest industry—after beer.18 Far more than wine, beer was the drink of preference across the Dutch provinces. It was an essential beverage for those who lived in the cities, where the water was pretty much undrinkable. Men and women, adults and children, regularly drank beer at their meals— breakfast, lunch, and dinner (with the young ones given a watereddown, low-alcohol “small beer”)—as well as to sustain them at work, to celebrate their many festivals, and just to pass the time in taverns and at home. Construction contracts often stipulated how many barrels of the beverage were to be provided per day for the workers. By one estimate, the average annual per capita consumption of beer in Holland was several hundred liters, with adults regularly drinking more than four liters a day.19 A good many of these liters were provided by Haarlem’s brewers. Beer had long been Haarlem’s mainstay industry, well before the expansion of the textile trade in the wake of the Flemish immigration. In the early 1500s, there were almost a hundred breweries in the city. Although their number was down to about twenty by the time the Hals family had settled in, things would rebound in the early 1620s, with over fifty establishments producing beer for both local consumption and domestic export.20 That amounts to one brewery for\n\n33\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nevery eight hundred people. By comparison, Rotterdam, second in beer production, had thirty breweries; Amsterdam, the largest city in Holland, a mere fifteen. In the city quarter on the Spaarne between the Saint Catherijne Bridge and the Saint Nicolaes Bridge alone there were ten breweries, including firms with such picturesque names as “The Two Lilies,” “The Glasses,” “The Fire Iron,” and “The Leaping Horse.” A brewery just beyond this neighborhood, and seeking to one-up its competitor, was called “The Three Lilies.” There were “The Ship,” “The Two Ships,” and “The Small Ship,” as well as “The Acorn” and “The Two Acorns.” Those who did not want their beer from “The Anchor” could go to “The Two Anchors,” “The Small Anchor,” or even “The Great Anchor.” Best of all, at least in name, was a brewery called “The Two Herrings.”21 At the beginning of the seventeenth century, these local breweries were running more than two thousand brews per year, with each brew consisting of around eighty liters of beer.22 Over the following two decades, Haarlem brewers will average fifty-seven million liters of beer annually, more than any other European city except London.23 While taxes on the production, sale, and consumption of such quantities of beer were a major source of income for the municipal coffers, it was the profits on beer exports that made the brewers very wealthy citizens indeed. (One Haarlem specialty was a hop beer made from a secret recipe. It was a luxury product intended primarily for export and carried a premium price.)24 The many rich brewer families—along with the local landed gentry, urban professionals, and bulk and rich-trade merchants—formed a substantial part of Haarlem’s governing elite. They also played a large role in the city’s art patronage throughout the first half of the seventeenth century and made a considerable contribution to the success of Frans Hals’s long career. * None of Franchois and Adriana’s sons followed in their father’s professional footsteps as a cloth cutter. In fact, they did not go into any of the textile trades. Neither did they become brewers. Frans, Joost, 34\n\nhaarLem\n\nand Dirck would all find their calling in the third industry for which Haarlem was famous: art. Joost appears to have been the least successful of the three. He died as a relatively young man, and no works by him have been identified.25 Dirck, on the other hand, will be celebrated for his “merry company” paintings showing festive gatherings of citizens, both well dressed and less elegantly attired, as they revel in taverns, ballrooms, and outdoors. Frans will enjoy even greater success, becoming not just one of the greatest Dutch portrait painters of the seventeenth century, but—along with his contemporaries Rembrandt, Rubens, Velázquez, and Van Dyck—one of the greatest portraitists in history. Art in Haarlem, as in Antwerp, was indeed an industry, a major one that, like textiles, grew significantly during the first half of the seventeenth century. In 1600, when the population of Haarlem was around 30,000, there were nineteen fine art painters registered in the local guild of artists and artisans. This was not an especially large number, especially when compared to other major Dutch centers of painting. Leiden’s population was 25,000, and it had ten painters, while Delft, with a population of 17,500, had twenty painters. By 1625, however, Haarlem had, in absolute terms, more painters than Amsterdam, Delft, Utrecht, Leiden, or Rotterdam. Haarlem’s residents then numbered about 38,000, and its cohort of painters had grown to forty-four. While Leiden’s population had by then surpassed Haarlem’s and was close to 45,000 individuals, it had only twenty-seven painters; among Delft’s 21,000 denizens, there were thirty-six painters. By 1650, more than ninety of the almost 50,000 people living in Haarlem were painters; while of Leiden’s 67,000 residents, only fifty-one were painters; and of the 24,000 people in Delft, there were forty-four painters.26 Numbers aside, what distinguished the art world in Haarlem from that in other Dutch cities and towns was its deep and celebrated traditions. The city’s reputation as a center of painting and graphic work went back to the late fifteenth century. Throughout Haarlem’s Catholic period, the high quality of the etched and engraved prints and the luminous oil panel paintings coming out of its studios was, like the brilliant white of its linen, recognized across Europe.27 35\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nHaarlem artists were producing altarpieces and other religious and devotional works—depicting stories from the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Gospels, and lives of the saints, including annunciations, nativity scenes, Holy Families, and crucifixions and other episodes of Christ’s Passion—as well as solo and, by the late sixteenth century, group portraits for a broad religious and secular clientele. The city’s renown for fine art, including magnificent works of High Renaissance style, would only grow in the decades to come. * Karel van Mander was one of the recent Flemish émigrés to Haarlem. He was born in 1548, in Meulebeke, just north of Kortrijk. Though raised in a noble family—his father was in the entourage of the local lord—he was set on a career in painting and printmaking. After apprenticeships in Ghent and Kortrijk, and some very wellspent time in Prague, Florence, Rome, and Vienna, he returned to his hometown. It was not a religiously peaceful time in Flanders, as we have seen, and Catholic extremists, whom Van Mander’s anonymous early biographer, writing in 1618, calls “the Malcontent Walloons,” made life in the area unbearable for Protestants.28 Van Mander himself, although born a Catholic, had become a Mennonite and as a result faced harassment by these zealots.29 At one point he was, his biographer tells us, “set upon by a number of Walloons and stripped naked.” The brigands put a rope around his neck and were about to hang him from a tree when he was saved by a man passing by on horseback. When this rider, who happened to be Italian, inquired what was going on, Van Mander spoke to him in Italian and informed him that he was a painter, and that he had spent some time in his country. The rider, after looking closely at Van Mander, recognized him as someone he had met in Rome. The Italian thus “drew his short-sword and set about the Walloons, saying ‘Remove that noose instantly, let my friend go and give him back his clothes.’”30 Van Mander narrowly escaped with his life and returned to his father’s lands. Rather than wait around for the next attack, though, in 1582 he left the area altogether and headed with his family first for Bruges and, subsequently, Haarlem. 36\n\nhaarLem\n\nBut since there was no peace [in Bruges] either, with the [Spanish] enemy approaching nearer each day, and a severe plague beginning to rage in the city, Karel departed with his wife, her mother and his children, taking ship to Holland, and settled in the ancient and glorious city of Haarlem, where he was engaged to make paintings and drawings.31\n\nMuch of Van Mander’s art was in a mannerist tradition, combining Italian and Flemish influences. His richly colored paintings of biblical, mythological, and allegorical scenes—dominated by greens, blues, and bolts of red and yellow—are densely populated with highly stylized figures. They act out their historical dramas, typically in period dress, in lush and fantastic landscapes. His prints, meanwhile, depict elongated, muscular bodies in fabulous encounters and uncomfortably torqued positions. Van Mander’s work as a painter and printmaker enjoyed some respect, if not great popularity, among his contemporaries. But his reputation, like mannerism generally, took a downward turn in the seventeenth century and never really recovered.32 His real claim to fame was his role as a Netherlandish Vasari. He is known primarily not for any great works of art but for his Schilder-Boeck (Painter book), which includes an opinionated but judicious survey of the lives and careers of hundreds of historical and contemporary painters—not unlike Le Vite de’ più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori (Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects) written in the mid-sixteenth century by Giorgio Vasari of Florence, whom Van Mander met during his time in that city. To underscore the lessons that might be learned from his history of painting, Van Mander supplemented the Schilder-Boeck with an influential treatise, composed in verse, on the art of painting.33 In the Schilder-Boeck, Van Mander relies a great deal on earlier sources: Pliny’s Natural History for the painters from antiquity and Vasari’s Le Vite for the artists of Italy. But when it comes to the biographies of “the illustrious Netherlandish and German painters,” from the fifteenth century on—starting with Jan and Hubert van Eyck—Van Mander is on his own. The result is a remarkable survey of the art and artists of his time. 37\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nVan Mander makes no attempt to hide his partisanship for his adopted city. In his profile of the Haarlem native Cornelis Cornelisz (1562– 1638), who was so closely associated with the city that he was also known as Cornelis van Haarlem, he boasts that the ancient, distinguished town of Haarlem was an admirable spectacle before the whole world and everyone talked and spoke of how she, during the time of the thirty-one week siege, withstood the great, horrifying Spanish might with feeble ramparts, stout hearts and the fist.34\n\nVan Mander goes to great lengths to highlight Haarlem’s rich artistic tradition and has nothing but high praise for the artists of a place where, he says, “there had always been great painters.” He does not hesitate to name names. It has long been rumored that of old, even in very early days, very good or even the best painters of the entire Netherlands lived in Haarlem in Holland, which cannot be denied or exposed as untruthful but can rather and far better be proven true with the previously mentioned old masters, [Albert van] Ouwater and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, as well as with Dierick [Dirck] van Haarlem.35\n\nThe prose here is a bit of exaggeration for rhetorical effect. Van Mander did not really think that Ouwater was a better painter than Jan van Eyck, who worked in Bruges; and he devotes twice as much space to Rogier van der Weyden, another Fleming, than he does to Dirck van Haarlem.36 Still, Van Mander notes, in his entry on the native Haarlemmer Jan Mostaert, that “in Holland the ancient and important city of Haarlem has brought forth many good spirits in our art.”37 The city is especially renowned, he says, “for the best and earliest manner of landscape painting.”38 And yet, the reader of Van Mander’s text will find that this is hardly the only genre for which Haarlem deserves acclaim. Among the local masters profiled by Van Mander is Maerten van Heemskerck. Van Heemskerck was not a 38\n\nhaarLem\n\nHaarlem native but came to study with its masters, and he eventually settled there. Van Mander devotes a fairly long entry to this important printmaker and painter of religious works in the mid-sixteenth century—a man, Van Mander says, with “a very subtle manner in drawing with the pen, and very precise in shading, with a deft, light way of handling,” and gifted with “a special light for art in his time.”39 But Van Heemskerck also excelled at straight portraiture; although it was a minor part of his output, he helped to establish Haarlem’s early reputation for brilliance in that area. While Van Mander’s local favoritism, even prejudice, is undeniable, his praise of Haarlem would have been seconded by many of his contemporaries. From the late sixteenth-century engraved prints of Van Mander’s friend Hendrick Goltzius (1558– 1617)—who was born in Brüggen, in the German lands, but arrived in Haarlem in 1577 and never left—with their mannerist depictions of improbable musculature and elongated features, to the verdant seventeenth- century landscapes of Esaias van de Velde (active in Haarlem in the 1610s), Haarlem outshone practically all cities of the northern Netherlandish provinces in the quality of its artistic output in the final period of Spanish rule and the decades of the Dutch Revolt. * The early, homegrown Dutch talent—men like Mostaert and Van Heemskerck—was one thing. But Haarlem’s art world also received a significant boost from the southern provinces.40 A large number of artists, art dealers, and others in associated trades—frame makers, auctioneers, and appraisers, not to mention a cohort of wealthy art consumers—arrived with the Flemish exiles in the decades after the Spanish reconquest. Some of the newcomers were Flanders born, others were native sons returning to Haarlem after several years making a successful living in Antwerp. There was Van Mander himself. And Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem, the son of a draper, was coming home to his native city after six years abroad: three in Rouen and, when he fled that French city because of the plague, three in Antwerp, where he trained with Gilles Coignet, a history painter.41 Cornelis’s own history works— 39\n\nChaPTer Two\n\npaintings of episodes from the Bible, like his 1591 Massacre of the Innocents, and scenes from ancient mythology, such as The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis from 1593 or the horrific Dragon Devouring Two Followers of Cadmus of 1588 (of which Goltzius made an engraved print that same year)—set a high standard for Haarlem artists looking to specialize in that genre. During the final decades of the century, Cornelis, as we shall see, also enjoyed favor as portraitist to Haarlem’s militia companies. Ampzing, turning in his Haarlem encomium to the city’s artists, offers the highest praise for Cornelis’s skill and inventiveness: “first place to you must all concede, a painter by name, a painter by his deeds.”42 Over the next few decades, and in the wake of Van Mander, Goltzius, and Cornelis—arguably Haarlem’s three most prominent artists in these years—there arrived, among many others, the engravers Dirck Volckertsz Coornhert and Jacob (Jacques) de Gheyn the Younger, the latter an Antwerper who, after six years in Haarlem (from 1585 to 1591), moved on to Leiden, Amsterdam, and then back to Leiden, finally finishing his career in The Hague. Somewhat later, Haarlem welcomed the marine painter Jan Porcellis, originally from Ghent but who arrived in the city in 1621 after five years in Antwerp; Pieter Claesz, a Catholic from Berchem, just outside Antwerp, and painter of brilliant still lifes; the Haarlem native Pieter Soutman, another Catholic, who returned to the north in 1624 after several years in Antwerp; and Adriaen Brouwer, also Catholic and likewise arriving from Antwerp (but originally from Oudenaarde), a genre painter of raucous tavern scenes who was in Haarlem only briefly and would return to his Flemish home in 1631. In 1600, among the nineteen painters listed in the membership of Haarlem’s artists’ guild, one-third were émigrés from the Spanish Low Countries. There must have been many more, since in these early years of Dutch quasi-independence not every painter in the city registered with the guild.43 According to one database, more than 17 percent of the painters and printmakers in Haarlem between 1565 and 1630 were born in Antwerp.44 As a pair of recent scholars put it, between the immigrant textile workers and the relocated art world, by 1600 “Haarlem . . . was in effect Antwerp transferred.”45 40\n\nhaarLem\n\nWhile these Flemish artists and the themes and styles they brought north would flourish in Haarlem’s artistic and economic environment and contribute enormously to the expansion of the city’s art market—practically all of the art dealers there either came from Antwerp or were descendants of Antwerp families46—the transition for individual artists was not always and immediately a smooth one. For one thing, they had to get along without their usual forms of patronage. Back in the southern Low Countries, an important source of commissions was the royal court: portraits of the Spanish king and queen and their retinues, their regents and entourages in the Low Countries, their offspring and their titled relatives. Perhaps more important, artists in Flanders, as in most Catholic lands, could count on ecclesiastic support. Altarpieces and other religious works— paintings, statues, glassworks, tapestries—were needed to decorate the altars, walls, and pillars of churches and chapels. In Holland and the other rebellious Protestant provinces, none of this existed. There was no longer a king or queen, and the Catholic Church was, in most places, forced into hiding. Artists had to seek their living elsewhere: from the wealthy burghers of the cities, from guilds and companies, and from what was left of the noble families. But there were also independent dealers, auctions, lotteries, art markets, and fairs. There was certainly no lack of demand for art, but in the Dutch Republic it did not come from court or cathedral. The artists from the south, once settled in Haarlem, had to get used to a new way of doing things. * Within a few years of his arrival in Haarlem in 1583, Van Mander established himself as a major presence on the city’s art scene. Along with Cornelis, who had returned that same year, and Goltzius, he set up a kind of school and workshop in Haarlem—his anonymous biographer calls it “an academy”—to teach aspiring artists “to study from life.”47 It was not an art academy or art school proper. It did not have the endowment, organization, or formal curriculum of more established institutions elsewhere in Europe, such as the Accademia di 41\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nBelle Arti in Florence, founded by the Medicis in the mid-sixteenth century, or, later in the seventeenth century, Paris’s Académie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture. Rather, it was just a trio of local, likeminded artists—two Catholics and a Mennonite convert—with different but complementary skills and interests who, with the support of a patron, the Amsterdam art dealer and collector Jacob Rauwert, collaborated on art production, teaching, and theory.48 Goltzius was making engraved prints after Cornelis’s mannerist paintings, with Van Mander, when he was not himself painting, providing theoretical foundations, and interpreting literary source material for their work. The three artists may even have shared studio space. It was a relatively short-lived enterprise, ending perhaps in 1603, when Van Mander left Haarlem (and he died soon thereafter, in 1606), and certainly with Goltzius’s death in January of 1617.49 Still, the Haarlem group, in its brief lifetime, was well known throughout Holland and was not without some influence on art practice and theory. It attracted talented students from all over the province—from Haarlem, but also, if Van Mander’s biographer is to be believed, from Amsterdam, Delft, The Hague, and elsewhere. Was Franchois’s gifted son Frans among the pupils working with Van Mander, Goltzius, and Cornelis? There is, in fact, hardly anything that we know for certain about Frans Hals’s earliest training as a painter, least of all the master with whom he spent his formative years as a pupil and apprentice. Among the Dutch painters Van Mander profiles in his SchilderBoeck, he discusses three whom his biographer (but not Van Mander himself ) refers to as his “students [discipulen].”50 Van Mander has nothing but high praise for all of them, although it is not clear whether they apprenticed with him personally or were students whose work he, along with Goltzius and Cornelis, oversaw in the “academy.” Jacques de Moschero from Delft, Van Mander notes, is “accomplished and experienced in all aspects of art”; Evert Krijnsz, now working in The Hague, acquired in Italy “a beautiful, rapid and lively manner of painting both in histories and in portraits”; and “Cornelis Enghelsen” (that is, Cornelis Engelsz, also called Cornelis Versprongh) from Gouda is “a very good painter and an outstand42\n\nhaarLem\n\ning portraitist.”51 Surprisingly, Van Mander does not include an entry for, or even any mention of, Karel van Mander II, his eldest son and, later, an accomplished painter in his own right, whom he must have taught (as the biographer—who may be Karel II himself—confirms for us). Neither is there any mention in the original edition of the SchilderBoeck of Frans Hals, not even among the brief notes devoted to “various Netherlandish painters presently alive.” This is likely because when Van Mander was writing, in 1604, the twenty- one-year-old Hals was not someone worth mentioning among the “illustrious” and “renowned” artists who interested him. Hals had not yet joined the local artists’ guild and so was not a master painter—he was a journeyman at best, if not still an apprentice. It all depends upon when he began his requisite entry-level work in the profession. According to the 1590 charter of the Haarlem guild—and this charter was still in effect in the first decade of the 1600s and would not be replaced by new regulations until 1631—an apprenticeship was to last no less than three years.52 This had to be followed by at least one additional year of work with a master as a journeyman before one could apply to become a master painter oneself. It was not uncommon, though, for a young painter to take up to nine years to become a master and open his (or her) own workshop with apprentices.53 In 1604, Hals, wherever he may have been in his preparatory period, was still a nobody—a talented nobody, perhaps, but not yet someone who would attract much notice outside of the workshop in which he was training or assisting. It was a different story fourteen years later, after Van Mander had passed away but when his biographer was writing for the second edition of the Schilder-Boeck. Hals had become a master painter by this point and made enough of a name for himself finally to earn a mention.54 The biographer describes him—along with Van Mander’s oldest son—as having been one of Van Mander’s “pupils”: He [Van Mander] had various pupils, some of whom became good masters: Jacques van Moschero; Jacob Martensz.; Cornelis Enghelsen; Frans Hals, portrait painter of Haarlem; Evert Krijnsz. from 43\n\nChaPTer Two\n\nThe Hague; Hendrick Gerritsz. Oost-Indiën; François Venant; and many others, too many to mention, and also his eldest son Karel van Mander, who was born in Haarlem and lives in Delft. All deserve esteem and praise for their rich invention and accomplished manner of painting and drawing.55\n\nIf Van Mander’s son, Karel II, is indeed the author of the biography, he can be trusted on this matter, for he surely would have known who among the now celebrated painters in Holland worked under his father. Many years later, a German painter and younger contemporary of Hals named Matthias Scheits (ca. 1625– ca. 1700) wrote a brief biographical sketch of Hals on the flyleaf of his own personal copy of Van Mander’s Schilder-Boeck. Scheits had been in Haarlem from 1640 to 1650—as a student of Philips Wouwerman, who in turn had been Hals’s pupil—and no doubt knew Hals personally. He thus had the opportunity to correct what Van Mander’s earlier biographer said about Hals’s training. Instead, he only reiterates that “the excellent portrait painter [conterfeiter] Frans Hals of Haarlem learned from Carel Vermander van Molebeke.”56 There is yet a third contemporary witness, one who was only reminding his audience of what was, among his Haarlem compatriots, common knowledge. Giving a toast in 1686 at the Guild of Saint Luke’s annual New Year’s banquet, this anonymous speaker tells the company how it was the love of art that drove Van Mander, so that he left Flanders to go and live in Haarlem, where he flourished for twenty years with his clever brush. And this he taught Frans Hals, proud Prince Apelles, to perfection.\n\nThe speaker adds that the reason why Van Mander left Haarlem for Amsterdam is that “this Phoenix [Hals] has surpassed him in fame.”57 (We will have to make allowance for the kind of exaggeration encouraged in speeches at such affairs, especially when the speaker is\n\n44\n\nhaarLem\n\nlikely already deep in his cups after many other toasts; Van Mander left Haarlem well before Hals even joined the guild as a master.) On the basis of the contemporary record, then, it seems fair enough to conclude that Hals studied painting under Karel van Mander. If Hals, whose family arrived in Haarlem just two years after Van Mander, received his training from the great art theoretician and poet, either as a member of the “academy” or as one of Van Mander’s own apprentices, then he presumably received fine painterly and graphic training in his teacher’s preferred style. Van Mander’s early biographer indicates that in teaching his pupils Van Mander “showed them the Italian manner.”58 What that meant, at least for Van Mander, was the style of Titian. In his biographical entry on Dirck Barendsz, “excellent painter of Amsterdam,” Van Mander says that Dirck, who traveled to Italy and even trained with Titian, was a born painter and besides enjoyed the breast of the great Titian and became such a man that one might truthfully say that he was the most important person to have brought the pure and unalloyed correct manner from Italy to the Netherlands.\n\n“There is,” he continues, “presently in Gouda in the friary a painting by him, a ‘Nativity,’ astonishingly well handled in the Italian manner,” and he notes that in this and other works of his “one sees a striking Titianesque and Italian manner of working.” He adds, for good measure, that Dirck Barendsz “had a real Venetian accen"
