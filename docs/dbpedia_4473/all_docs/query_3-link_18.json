P. Hartley reminds us at the beginning of The Go-Between; 'they do things differently there'. In the arts we spend more of our time in this territory than in our own land, savouring its confusing yet comforting ways, enjoying its artistic legacy while often forgetting its political and social shell in our enthusiasm to get at the cultural pearl. Until recently, almost instinctively, its differences were absorbed into a technological assessment of music's progress. We assumed the superiority of the later over the earlier ('the seed sown by Stamitz developed into the full Classical symphony of late Mozart'), the modern over the old ('our Steinway, so much more resonant that Mozart's slight forte piano''), the public over the private (the opera aria over devotional hymn), the composer over the patron, the studied phrase over the impromptu gesture. But it was not always so, and a delight in the music of the 17th and 18th centuries is soon tempered by some puzzlement as we realize that, in the Age of Patronage, they did things differently. The lure of the Baroque, at least in the broad view, began at much the same time as the arrival of the LP. It had been preceded by another important 20th-century invention, the concept of 'chamber orchestra'. These two, with the connivance of Vivaldi, ensured that every cultured household soon had daily access to a handful of well-seasoned concern; everyone was indelibly convinced that the 'Albinoni Adagio' was actually by Albinoni. As a consultative, sometimes almost archival, attitude to records developed, so the number of light anthologies declined, and the greatest omissions from the standard concert repertory were repaired; we began to appreciate the clavichord and the counter-tenor, the Bach cantata and the Handel opera seriay though still in ignorance of their appropriate visual and social setting. At the same time an attitude to the Baroque developed which can only be described as 'best buy', and with it that unfortunate corollary of the Ur-text, the 'Ur-performance'. 'Wie es eigentlich gewesen' ('As it really was'), the catch-phrase of Leopold von Ranke in the 1830s, became again the watch-word, and a surfeit of Olde Musicke made life in the recreative arts begin to look like one endless historical romance. The death of the past and its resurrection as history can produce as much nostalgia as archaeology; the challenge in all recreative arts is to combine the science of discovering expression in texts with the art of communicating it. Some commentators still hold that we are busy historicizing ourselves, that musical ventures into past contexts and countries are a form of creative anachronism, as misleading and laughable as Inigo Jones's certainty that Stonehengc was a Roman monument. The opposing school would counter Ezra Pound's exhortation to 'Make it New' with a demand that all works be recreated 'brand old', taking advantage of historical information to try and reconcile the demands of 'then' and 'now', blending archaeology and passion. Over the last 20 years, it has been the Baroque period in particular that has focused our attention on the inherited obligation to temper instinct with information. A dizzying increase in available repertory and styles of performance, constant debate on the value of Telemann as a composer, or the xi Copyrighted material Foreword Baroque oboe as an instrument, leaves most music-lovers gasping for digestible information and a sense of context. Cult phrases, fashionable adjectives and buzz-words confuse, but also galvanize the forum. Once it was 'terrace dynamics', followed by 'hemiola', then 'non-vibrato'; tempo and metronome markings seem to be the present kiwi-fruit of nouvelle musicologie, but may soon be as dated as Asphalt-Lyrik. The over-examined term 'authentic' is gradually being allowed to slink back to its old position (Lionel Trilling), and in its place Andrew Porter has suggested HIP - the Historically Informed Performance. This concept, well-designed to rebuild bridges and demolish ghettos, in its turn requires HAL - the Historically Aware Listener. This sensible musician seeks to strike the happy mean, and develop 'informed instinct', the heart endorsed by the head. Such a form of accommodation is, I feel, one of the most elusive aspects of any debate on performance, simply because there are so few norms. Some artists would, by instinct, like to see themselves as rebels against all information, arguing that information is old, and that therefore tradition is stultifying. Others would so manipulate their instincts that, like some bonsai creation, they become totally constrained by external information and devoid of natural independence. (This is the attitude that Stravinsky is so often, and wrongly, said to have asked of his interpreters.) Part of the problem is the need for us to ignore the surface; since our first reactions may often be lopsided or imperfectly informed, one must pass to that state where the information is allowed free passage, even when the instinct rebels. I, for instance, have an instinctive dislike of the ornamented form of capital Q in the type-face known as Bookman; but this instinctive recoil is balanced by the ability we all have to look through the actual forms of letters and comprehend words. The instinct is subordinated to the information, and I do not feel any personal animosity towards either Queen Elizabeth, Quantz or the Salomon Quartet. Bertrand Russell prescribed 'immunity to eloquence' as a condition of intelligent appraisal of writing, and the same also goes for musical interpretation that needs must begin with a cool appraisal of the printed note. Of course one is moved, of course one's heart responds and one hopes to be the medium whereby an audience's collective heart resonates in consonance with this feeling. But it is very easy, in these days of 'one size fits all', to over-react, to milk the passing moment for more than it asks or more than the structure can bear; 'tasteful' is out, 'dramatic' is in, the composer's expectations arc superseded by those of the marketeers - 'Does it sell?', 'Do they applaud?' - and an interpretative school based on the 'Look at Me!' principle. Such display of over-indulgence in personal vanity on a podium (or even from the harpsichord), the 'Moi!' school, is very similar to the type of Shakespearian acting on which I was brought up; every line was spoken in italics, with sudden underlining and shocking CAPITALIZATION to add yet more emphasis. When Pelion was finally in place on Ossa, I was left wondering what had happened to the poetry - sometimes even to the story. We have conditioned ourselves to extremes of stimulation incompatible with the code of intention of the creator. We have asked, as it were, for the Rembrandt to be relegated to the gallery store-room and a 12-times enlargement with 'colour enhancement' to be hung in its place. A silly analogy, you may say; but if a painting xii Copyrighted material Foreword were to dissolve into small pots of its component colours at the end of every day as the gallery doors closed, imagine how scrupulously you would ask the staff to follow the artist's prescription when the paint was reapplied to the canvas the following morning. In the concert-hall, where there is less credit for similar scruples, the cavalier approach to 'enhanced' interpretation can lead to a total destruction of the composer's code of intentions and system of rhetoric, a crime surely worse than the employment of an incorrect accidental, a tasteless ornament or a less than authentic instrument. Like the new and (we hope) passing enthusiasm for devising ever more coloured versions of old black and white movies, it amounts to laying on more paint rather than cleaning the picture. I have to confess to an old-fashioned preference for Handel the colour he started off. You may rightly ask how can one be so presumptuous as to 'know' what that was, but I would rather make some progress along such a line of thought, even with difficulty and experiment, than sell out to the school of obligatory italics and car-chases which presupposes that whatever colour he was, it wasn't good enough. The historical approach is far from limiting; it actually offers a greater freedom of choice, a multiple choice of 'correct' readings. But it will inhibit most musicians from following the uninhibited creed of Wanda Landowska who declared that, however others played his music, she played Bach his way. The new and undogmatic spirit will, I believe, eventually lead towards a co- ordination where instinct and information begin to mesh, that delicious moment when it suddenly sounds and feels 'inevitable'. Maybe it is not 'as it really was'; who knows? We will surely continue on the path of 'knit your own Baroque', but at least with a healthy spirit of agnosticism it will be with more regard to the prescribed pattern and purpose and less for the perverse pleasure of hearing the needles clash. Christopher Hog wood Cambridge xiii Copyrighted material A Short Explication By acquiring this book, you have gained the materials for exploring anew the Baroque era of music. The Companion to Baroque Music is designed to be accessible to enthusiasts while at the same time being a useful tool for specialists. Those seeking a potted history, listening notes for the best-loved works or neatly-columned worklists will be disappointed; but these are to be found in the classic work by Manfred Bukofzer,' the more recent surveys of Claude Palisca2 and Lorenzo Bian- coniJ and The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.* By its very nature, a companion repays the time one spends with it. And as with a friend, the Companion cannot be all things to all people, although it is hoped that with familiarity will come greater pleasure and fresh insights into a much-loved repertory. I have attempted to present music and musicians in terms of their social, temporal and topographical contexts. The traditional biographical dictionary of composers, performers, writers on music, instrument makers, music publishers and the like is here parcelled out geographically by country and in some cases by region or city. Each smaller 'dictionary' is augmented by a mine of cross-references to secondary places of work (though not necessarily of study or apprenticeship), which may alert the browser to the varied foreign influences at work in a given place, besides explaining the absence of an entry from that particular dictionary.5 The separation of musicians by locality also points up the phenomenon of 'centres of excellence' - violin making in Cremona, brass instrument making in Nuremberg, organ building in North Germany, publishing in Amsterdam and London, singing in Ferrara, Florence and Mantua, string playing in Bologna, Milan and Paris, and opera in Venice, Naples, Dresden and Hamburg. The index coordinates the various regional dictionaries in addition to providing references to the overviews written by specialists and to the essays under the headings 'Baroque Forces and Forms' and 'Performing Practice Issues', as well as to the Chronology. The maps may provoke new thoughts about the proximity of musicians and institutions and their roles in the dissemination of styles and taste. The Companion to Baroque Music subscribes to the boundaries traditionally set for this period of music, namely the years 1600- 1750, which embody - though not exclusively - the age of the basso continuo, symbolized by the birth of opera in Florence at the outset and the death of J. S. Bach at the close. But nothing is ever quite that tidy in the history of man, not to say of music. The last decade of the 1 6th century witnessed the deaths of Zarlino (1590), Palcstrina (1594) and Lassus (1594), all of whom greatly affected 17th-century composers; indeed, Giovanni Gabrieli lived only a few years into the century but exerted a profound influence upon several generations of composers. Just beyond the other end of our arbitrary spectrum arc the 'Quercllc des Bouffons' (1752), the publications of Quantz,6 J. J. Rousseau,7 C. P. E. Bach8 and L. Mozart9 which report earlier 18th-century instrumental practices, and the death of Handel (1759). The biographical coverage of the Companion is of course selective. Great effort has been made to balance it. The reader may, however, become aware of 'national styles' within the dictionaries, although all the entries are the work of a single author; XV Copyrighted material A Short Explication this impression would seem largely to be the result of the character of the source materials, but it is also a reflection of the apparently inextinguishable esprit du temps or Zeitgeist. By isolating traditions of music-making - composers and their proteges - within a geographical hierarchy, we can make a fresh set of comparisons. The presence of entries and cross-references to resident foreign musicians (as, for example the Germans in Poland) adds further colour and perspective to our impressions of the musical life in these places and, in the course of the period, reveals interesting changes in the patterns of the migration of musicians, which is in general from south to north. As to who qualifies for inclusion, it is those composers and musicians who flourished during the period 1600-1750. Those born in the late 16th century who - though perhaps better known as exponents of Renaissance music - nevertheless flourished for a significant time in the 17th century and contributed works or performances in the seconda prattica (such as monody) appear; those born after 171 5, with certain exceptions,10 do not. Characteristic of composers of the early 17th century is the versatility of their compositional techniques, which enabled them - by necessity - to produce works in both prima and seconda prattica, depending upon the commission. By contrast, the modes of expression employed by most early 18th- century composers tended to evolve from their own particular inherited late-Baroque national style to a single (derivative though some were), often lighter-weight and more cosmopolitan galant or pre-Classical style. The somewhat unorthodox format of the Companion is intended to help the reader re-examine assumptions and confront fallacies. The essays on places address the social conditions under which musicians worked and which determined the evolution of art music. In this sense, the essays provide a counterbalance for the dictionaries, in which I have sought to present the human face. The intimate scale of the individual dictionaries should, for example, enable the reader to gain an impression of what it was like to be a musician in a given place: the spectrum of employment opportunities\" and the 'pecking order' within different generations of musicians, as well as their relative openness to outside influences. As with 'Places and People', the annotated Chronology is meant to be consulted in a variety of ways. To be sure, most of the details contained within it appear elsewhere in the book, but by its format the Chronology reveals the synchrony of events and presents a wide-ranging if cryptic musical history of the era as a whole. Whether one surveys a year or a decade, follows the events of a controversy - of which there were many - or consults it like a musical Guinness Book of Records, a greater sense of connections between musicians will inevitably emerge. The format of the Chronology reflects the geographic ordering of the 'Places and People' section and presents both significant details of the lives of musicians and events relating to institutions and music. Consequently, the relative import of the events, however selectively chosen for inclusion, may not always be self-evident. This provides a useful example of how the dictionaries, index and chronology can be used complementarily: references to important performances - such as Monteverdi's LOrfeo (1607), Luigi Rossi's Orfeo (1647), Cesti's // porno a\"oro (1668), Lully's Cadmus et Hermione (1673), Fux's Costanza e Fortezza (1723), Gay's Beggar s Opera (1728), Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie (1733) and the Dublin Messiah (1742) - or the effect of the death of a composer such as Lully (1687), or the influence of a publication such as Corelli's op. 5 violin sonatas occur in many entries. Also included xvi Copyrighted material A Short Explication in the Chronology are those works familiar to most Baroque music lovers, such as PurcelPs Dido and Aeneas (1689), Handel's Rinaldo (171 1), Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and the B minor Mass, which made little or no impact on the course of music history. The reader may therefore distinguish between the forces of musical evolution and music appreciation. What, then, about the music and, in particular, how it should be performed? These topics are properly the domain of the essays on forces and forms, in which the qualities of the voices, the state-of-the-art instruments and the predominant forms and genres are surveyed. In each of these realms the aesthetic elements of national styles and 'good taste' are factors, and the commonly held assumptions of their day - along with a discussion of what is meant by 'authenticity', how and why it is so zealously pursued in our day, and what the listener should look for in a live or recorded performance - form the subjects of the essays in the section entitled 'Performing Practice Issues'. Make of it what you will.

Bach and even Domenico Scarlatti do not belong in a dictionary of Baroque-era musicians, but in each case the subject either composed in the late Baroque style or wrote about it, its traditions and exponents. 11 One has only to contrast the frustrations suffered by Monteverdi, Schiitz and J. S. Bach on account of their employers with the freedom to travel enjoyed by Froberger, Handel and Hasse (not to mention the castratos and the prima donnas). xvii Copyrighted material Acknowledgments I should like to express my gratitude to the Dent editors Julia Kellerman and Malcolm Gerratt for their support and enthusiasm throughout the long and evo- lutionary gestation of this handbook; Nigel Fortune and Tim Carter for their extremely useful comments on the manuscript; the text editors, Judy Nagley and Ingrid Grimes, for their meticulous understanding of the inner workings of the text, and in particular to Judy for her unstinting help with the index; Elisabeth Agate, for her sensitive and imaginative selection of works of art to underscore and enhance the text; John Gilkes, for his intrepid pursuit of historical cartography; Tabitha Collingbourne, for her careful rendering of the music examples; my fellow writers who rose so magnificently to the task; and, most of all, to my dear husband Stanley, whose contribution extends far beyond his essay to every corner of the book and without whose example I could never have summoned the necessary perseverance.

As late as the 19th century it was still possible to argue that cultural and linguistic unity, of which Italy had for centuries enjoyed a fuller measure than many of her European neighbours, was irrelevant to political allegiance, a factor more dependent on dynastic fortunes, diplomatic adjustments and military successes. A complex history of foreign invasion, inter-city rivalry and the ruthless pursuit of personal ambition - all of these complicated by the presence on Italian soil of the papacy - lay behind the periodically shifting political mosaic that the peninsula presented at the beginning of the modern era. Not too much should be made of the distinction between native-ruled and foreign- ruled territories, since the latter drew most of their officialdom, including their governors or viceroys, from the local elites and, until the Age of Reform, interfered little with traditional laws and customs. Nevertheless, the foreign dimension in Italian politics aided the spread of Italian culture outwards, leading to a curious 'domination' in reverse through which Italian, not German, became the language of polite conversation and of letters at the imperial court in Vienna; between Spain and Italy, however, the cultural exchange was less one-sided (though in music Italy dominated). During the period of the musical Baroque in Italy, roughly from 1600 to 1750, three large territories remained constantly under either imperial or Spanish rule. The duchy of Milan (Lombard) ) and the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily all belonged to Spain until by the Peace of Utrecht (1713), concluding the War of the Spanish Succession, Milan and Naples were transferred to Austria (Sicily followed in 1720, exchanged with Savoy for Sardinia). The Treaty of Vienna (1735, ratified 1738), concluding the War of the Polish Succession, returned Naples and Sicily, under a common crown, to Spain, although not as a hereditary possession; its first king was the Infant Don Carlos. Other territories came during our period under the sway of the Habsburgs or the Spanish Bourbons through force of arms or a dynastic void. The duchy of Mantua, ruled by the Gonzagas since 1328, paid the price for supporting France against Austria despite being an imperial fief and became attached to the empire in 17 10; the duchy of Parma and Piacenza, alienated from the papacy in 1545 by Pope Paul III, who donated it to his natural son Pierluigi Farnese, passed, through the marriage of Elisabctta Farnese into the Spanish Bourbons, to a cadet branch of the Spanish royal house in 1 73 1 ; the grand duchy of Tuscany came to the Austrians (though, like Parma and Piacenza, not as a hereditary possession) when Franz Stcphan, Duke of Lorraine and later emperor, succeeded Gian Gastone, last of the Medici, in 1737. Cutting a broad swathe across central Italy, with considerable extensions to the south-west (Rome) and north-east (Bologna, Ferrara), were the 13 provinces making 3 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview up the Papal States. These provinces, each administered by a high-ranking church- man with a title such as legate, vice-legate or governor, enjoyed a considerable degree of freedom from Rome in secular affairs, often preserving elements of an earlier history as principalities or free communes. Ferrara, indeed, reverted to the church only in 1598, after Alfonso II d'Este, whose family had held the duchy as papal vicars since 1332, died without male issue; the duchy of Urbino, since 1508 held by the Delia Rovere family, devolved similarly in 1631. Whereas Lombardy, Sicily, Naples and most of the other territories we shall discuss were highly cen- tralized - reducible, ultimately, to a capital city and its hinterland - the Papal States resembled more an agglomeration of self-contained statelets, each with its historic capital: Rome, Bologna, Ravenna, Ancona and so on. Of the independent territories other than those whose absorption by Spain or Austria has already been mentioned the most important were the duchy of Savoy (including Piedmont) in the north-west, the republic of Venice in the north-cast and the duchy of Modena north of Tuscany. Savoy, which officially became part of the kingdom of Sardinia after 1720, bore strong traces of its continuous involvement over the centuries with France. French was the language of the court at Turin, and the extent of French influence is illustrated by the fact that whereas the rest of the peninsula mostly kept 'Italian' time, in which the 24-hour cycle began at nightfall (the system goes back to medieval times and is related to the canonical hours), Savoy kept Trench' time, beginning the cycle at midnight. Venice, whose extensive administrative area on the Italian mainland - the so- called 'Terraferma veneta', or 'Veneto' - stretched from Bergamo in the west to Udinc in the cast and bordered the Po in the south (we will ignore here her possessions along the western seaboard of modern Yugoslavia and Greece and elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean), was in some respects, geographical and cultural, only peripherally Italian; yet in political terms she represented the concept of 'Italy', past and - many believed - future, better than any other state, having arisen from the debris of the Western Roman Empire and against all odds preserved her independence ever since. Venice's elaborate constitution, which reserved political power for a patrician class comprising between 2.5 and 4% of the population of the city of Venice, and many observances in her public life (such as the wearing of the toga by her nobles and the long prohibition of wigs in the Great Council) emphasized symbolically this historical or where history failed - mythical succession to republican and imperial Rome. Her proximity to the Ottoman empire in the cast and to Austria and Germany in the north (via major Alpine passes, notably the Brenner), made Venice a favoured entrepot for cultural as well as material products. Even after her manufacturing industry, like that of virtually all Italy, had gone into decline in the 16th and 17th centuries, and her maritime activity was curtailed by increasingly successful competition from English and French fleets in the 18th century, Venice kept afloat through the development of agriculture on the mainland and the growth of tourism - the term is not anachronistic - in the capital; it has been estimated that in the years around 1700 there were in Venice at Carnival time (January and February) around 30,000 foreign visitors, as compared with only 140,000 permanent residents. Modena and Reggio, which were ruled, together with Ferrara, by the Este family, remained in its possession after the cession of Ferrara to the papacy. The consequent removal of the Este court from Ferrara to Modena ushered in a period of intense 4 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview cultural activity belying Modena's slight political significance, especially under Francesco II (reigned 1662-94). For completeness, a group of small independent states adjoining Modcna must be mentioned: the republic of Lucca to the south; the duchy of Massa and Carrara to the west; the republic of Genoa further west, curling round the coastline. None of these distinguished itself in music betw een 1600 and 1750, and we shall hear no more of them. If the political map of Italy seemed to bear out Mcttcrnich's words, two factors tended to weld the fragments together; the Italian language and the Roman Catholic church. Although the people spoke - and still speak - an immense variety of dialects, a common literary language had been forged in the 13th and 14th centuries through the examples of Dante (1265-1321), Petrarch (1304-74) and Boccaccio (1313-75). Despite its label of Tuscan, since it was associated historically with the region of Florence, this literary Italian was soon cultivated by the educated throughout Italy, so that no irony attaches to the fact that the first great codifier of Italian linguistic and literary usage, Pietro Bembo (1470— 1547), was a Venetian. It is worth mentioning, however, that Venetian dialect aspired, like lowland Scottish, to an independent literary status; writing in dialect - with some relevance for comic opera - also existed, notably in Bologna and Naples. At a time - the 1 7th century - when the literary cultures of some other European nations had hardly begun to acquire their classic works, the Italians could look back on a tradition of lyric and epic poetry, drama and prose spanning four centuries. But it was a conservative tradition that weighed down heavily on the writer, challenging him with precedents at every turn. This tendency to conservatism was reinforced by the unique relationship to Latin that Italian enjoyed. The visible reminders, natural and man-made, of the Roman past; the lexical and grammatical similarities of the two languages; the wide acquaintance with classical authors stimulated by the Renaissance humanists and the development of printing: all these made the work of the writers of Antiquity as relevant as that of the post-Dante Italian school. When one reads the argomento before the libretto of an Italian Baroque opera, where the source of the plot, in Ov id or Livy perhaps, is dutifully identified, one realizes that the classical author is as close to the experience of the opera-goer as an Ariosto or Tasso. The symbiosis of Italian and Latin is strikingly illustrated, albeit unhappily from a literary standpoint, in the Latin texts of Baroque motets, which, if we can believe Grosley, were often penned by sacristans, thus men of only moderate education;1 here the accidence of Latin is wondrously assimilated to the syntax and fashionable imagery of contemporary Italian to produce a result too smooth and innocent to deserve the epithet 'barbarous'. Almost without exception the letterato was not a professional writer in the modern sense but a member of the leisured elite (the aristocracy and upper citizenry), hence distinctly superior socially to the typical musician, who belonged to the artisan class. For this reason opera librettos giv e the name of the author of the drama as a matter of course but that of the composer of the music as a mere courtesy, easy to forget. Whereas musicians organized themselves on a local basis in associations like the Venetian Societa S Cecilia (founded in 1690) that were concerned primarily with their members' welfare, writers came together on a wider, sometimes national basis, and with purely artistic goals in mind. These literary clubs were commonly known 5 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview as 'academies' (accademie), a term borrowed from the garden near Athens in which Plato and his followers once met and which, confusingly for us today, was used in many other senses in Baroque Italy (for a private concert, for a literary or musical composition performed in public, for an educational institution etc.). The Camerata, which, meeting in Florence between around 1573 and 1587 in the house of Count Giovanni de' Bardi, provided an intellectual basis for the introduction of monody and therefore, indirectly, of opera, was such an academy. Another famous and influential example was the Arcadian Academy (Accadcmia degli Arcadi) set up formally in Rome in 1690 to honour the memory of the late Queen Christina of Sweden, a leading patron of literature and the other arts. In order to recreate in their imagination the Peloponnesian Arcadia of old the members all adopted 'Arca- dian' names proper to shepherds or nymphs and participated in pseudo-classical ceremonies. Their essential business, however, was the classically inspired reform of taste in Italian letters, to be achieved by purging from them the uncouth and unseemly. The prestige of the Arcadians grew so fast that within a few years many existing literary academies in other cities had become affiliated to Arcadia, while others were created as 'colonies'. Arcadia became a nation-wide network of clubs imposing common literary standards that one finds observed equally in the Venetian Apostolo Zeno (1668-1750) and the Roman Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782), the two most eminent writers of melodrammi in the first half of the 18th century. The short-lived Societa Albrizziana (1724-45), named after the Venetian printer who founded it, even surpassed the Arcadians in the breadth of its membership, which grew to over 800 both inside and outside Italy and included a pope (Benedict XVI) and 14 cardinals. It demonstrates how truly national in character and homo- geneous in outlook the literary environment of Italy was. The religious environment was almost as homogeneous. What religious minorities there were - notably Waldenses in Piedmont and Jewish communities in several cities - had a low social profile and lived, from the point of view of the majority, on the margins of national life. In the spiritual sphere the papacy was, on one level, supranational, but the recruitment of all popes and most curial officials from the Italian elite and the residence of most cardinals (a disproportionate number of them also Italians) in Rome lent Italian Catholicism a peculiarly indigenous quality. The demographic, economic and social significance of the Italian clergy can hardly be overstated. It comprised not only parish priests and the hierarchy set above them but also monks and nuns, 'regular clerks' in non-monastic orders such as those of the Jesuits and the Barnabites, and secular priests (abati). With no public system of education in existence, the regular clerks - Jesuits, Somaschians and Scolopi (these last pioneers of free schooling in the vernacular for the poor) — dominated the instruction of the young, while the secular clergy formed a vital element of the intelligentsia in a society where the church provided almost the only means of upward mobility for the mass of the population. The size of the clergy in relation to the total population varied quite considerably from state to state. In Tuscany, where about half the land was in church hands, they numbered 27,000, or around 3% of the population, in 1738. The Veneto and the kingdom of Naples harboured a more typical proportion of around 2-2}%. In Piedmont, where, significantly, large landed properties were less common, they constituted under i}0o. The prominence of church buildings in the urban landscape was equally striking; in the late 18th century Bologna could boast 200 churches and 6 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview chapels, 36 monasteries and 28 convents of nuns. A penumbra of pious laymen surrounded the clergy; they were grouped in bodies that bore different names (confraternita, scuola, congregazione, accademia) but served similar devotional, charitable or propagandists purposes. Their importance for music lies above all in their cultivation of the oratorio genre, the musical weapon of the Counter-Reformation. Small wonder, then, that the church was the major employer of musicians and, for the general population, the main point of access to 'art' music. Every large church had its cappella or corn (these terms embrace singers and players alike) directed by a maestro di cappella. Except in convents of nuns, where the singers would naturally all be female, the choirs were made up of men and boys, the latter reinforced and sometimes entirely replaced by adult falsettists and castratos. There would be one or more fixed organs, each with its appointed player, and it was very common for their number to be augmented on special occasions by portative organs. Particularly in more prosperous northern Italy, a church would often employ a complementary band of strings led by a maestro det concertiy normally the principal violinist. In Rome and its area of influence the fashion arose in the last third of the 17th century to have the orchestra headed not by a single player but by a concertino, or 'small ensemble', consisting of the principal and co-principal violinists, a cellist and possibly also a continuo player for the trio. In Corelli's concerti grossi composed from the 1680s onwards and their many imitations this sytem of organization is 'written into' the musical language so perfectly that one is in danger of overlooking its other important aspects relating to the salary structure, management and spatial disposition of the orchestra. Some orchestras also included wind instruments in solo, doubling (rinforzo) or continuo roles. Harpsichords and plucked stringed instruments such as the lute and theorbo supported the organ in its continuo function. The permanent musical establishment of a church was usually of the appropriate size for services of middling importance such as those on Sundays. In services of a more routine nature the instrumentalists other than the organist might perhaps be dispensed with, and the choir might perform succinctly in a cappella style (note that in Baroque usage this expression embraces not only performance by unaccompanied voices but also performance with instruments doubling vocal parts strictly) or revert to plainsong, allowing the organ or a handful of strings to provide the element of contrast. On the other hand, for feasts of exceptional importance extra performers were commonly drafted in. Indeed, some churches such as that of the convent of S Lorenzo in Venice had no coro of their own, but, as if to compensate, celebrated the feast of the titular saint with an outsize choir and orchestra recruited for the event from far and wide (see Plate 1 ). In the early 17th century the singers of a cappella tended to outnumber the instrumentalists by something like two to one (at S Marco, Venice, in 1643 the proportion was 35:18). Orchestral performance in the modern sense (that is, with more than one instrument to each string part) took root in the second half of the century, gradually bringing the typical strength of the instrumental section up to parity with the vocal section. The approximately 70 musicians that S Marco employed in the 18th century were exceptionally numerous even for the principal church of a large city; the 28 musicians (16 singers, 12 instrumentalists) at S Petronio, Bologna, in 1663 present a more typical picture. The employment that 7 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview churches offered was not 'full-time' as we understand the concept today, for there was time and opportunity for the members of a cappella to supplement their modest salaries by accepting engagements elsewhere. Quite apart from the financial strain that a large musical establishment imposed, the positioning of the musicians in churches not originally built with such numbers in mind often proved difficult and led to curious and original solutions. It was often impossible for them all to be contained, as at S Petronio, within the chancel where the canonical stalls were also accommodated, and it became accepted practice to house them in special choir-lofts or even on improvised platforms within the nave itself. The two organs facing one another across the nave of the Venetian church of S Lorenzo, each surrounded by its own coro, offer a favourite, characteristically Italian solution. Being divided into two bodies, incidentally, did not mean that the musicians had to be given works specially written to take advantage of the spatial separation; undoubtedly, most of the music performed in due cori was written as if for an undivided ensemble. More radically, the musicians could be situated at the west end of the nave, causing the congregation to turn their seats towards the performers and - to the amused amazement of foreign visitors - their backs to the high altar. This partial dissociation of music from the rite (which it serves as an accompani- ment or commentary rather than as an actual ingredient) was possible in Catholicism, where the validity of the rite depends on the acts of the celebrant and his assistants, not on the participation of the congregation. When a motet or piece of instrumental music (toccata, ricercar, canzona, sonata, sinfonia etc) coincided with the recitation of the liturgy, the latter took place in a low voice, so reconciling liturgical propriety with musical integrity. The musical centrepiece of a service was, for the Mass, a setting of sections of the Ordinary; for Vespers and Compline, the psalms and canticle. The four great Marian antiphons, each in its appointed season, for the end of the canonical day were also regularly set. Because of the greater average length and complexity of Baroque vocal compositions compared with their 16th-century counterparts - a factor connected with the introduction of instruments and the cultivation of a more florid vocal style - a process of increasing selectivity and rationalization becomes evident after 1600. The Messa commonly becomes reduced to the Kyrie and Gloria (the Credo, or part of it, is set as a separate entity; the Sanctus and Agnus Dei only rarely). In Vespers the antiphons are replaced by motets or instrumental pieces, and in psalm settings preference is given to those psalms belonging to several liturgies rather than few. Although composers often set to music in cyclic fashion all the relevant parts of a given service, we know from contemporary descriptions that in practice the music was more likely to be heard in the form of extracts than as a complete whole. The modern concert audience that can hear Monteverdi's Vespers (1610) from start to finish is privileged. The general uniformity of Divine Service across Italy was tempered by the tolerance of small local peculiarities or liturgical forms cultivated by particular religious orders. Court chapels were a special case, for here tw o sources of authority, Rome and the secular power, each had to make themselves felt. Venice, which, as a republic, possessed no court in the ordinary sense and was, indeed, notably unostentatious in its use of music in state ceremony, made the ducal church of S Marco into a repository of autonomous cultural expression. Here, and in certain 8 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview local churches, a special rite believed to have a historical connection with the superseded Aquileian rite was observed, resulting in the musical setting of many texts foreign to the Roman rite. In Rome itself, the pope's own singers, based in the Cappella Sistina but often performing elsewhere, were another institution sui generis. They were recruited internationally and subject to a strict corporate disci- pline that forbade them to occupy outside posts or to marry. As if to emphasize the retrospective, stile antico nature of their repertory, they performed entirely without instruments. Courts themselves, after churches, offered musicians the best opportunities of regular employment. Much of the music in a court, as in a church, w as an accompani- ment to other activities - banqueting and dancing in particular. The musical genres qualified by the expression 4da camera' (literally, 'for the chamber') are written, ostensibly, for court use, though their cultivation inevitably filtered down to less exalted sections of society. Some musically-inclined rulers held conversazioni (acca- demie): private concerts at which the favourite genre was the continuo-accompanied solo cantata (most courts employed operatic singers who were released to sing in the great theatres of Venice, Rome, Bologna or Naples during the season, but returned to court in the off-season and devoted themselves to the chamber repertory). This sheltered milieu was a haven for dilettanti, the gentle-born amateurs that Italy produced in such large numbers and whose reluctance to perform before a wider audience stemmed not so much from lack of confidence as from a desire to preserve social distance. The high points of music-making in court w ere the musical contributions to the feste organized to celebrate birthdays, name-days, births, weddings, state visits and other occasions of rejoicing. Opera was born, in Florence and Mantua, as just another novel form of musical-dramatic entertainment in this festive context. Once entrepreneurially managed public opera came to the fore (the first public opera house, that of S Cassiano in Venice, opened in 1637), the many court theatres where operas had been, and continued to be, given (in Turin, Parma, Modena etc.) quickly adapted their style, practice and repertory to that of the public theatres, so that the rich diversity and lavish ingenuity of the early court operas was lost. This con- vergence is illustrated by the practice in Naples of transferring the same works between the viceregal palace and the public opera house of S Bartolomeo (opened in 1654). In the middle of the 17th century there arose a new genre that took its poetic character from the cantata and its dramatic character from the opera. This was the serenata, named after the serenoy or clear night sky, under which, with copious illumination from torches and candles, many of its performances took place. In scale (typically lasting between one and two hours), sentiment (lightheartcd, often amorous), resources (from two singers upwards, with orchestra, occasionally choir) and, above all, adaptability, the serenata was the ideal musical complement of a festa. If theatrical facilities existed or could be improvised, it could be given in theatrical style; if not, the singers could read from their parts and scenery could be limited to a simple background as often employed for oratorio performances. Serenata performances took advantage of the special features of palaces and their grounds; they were given in great halls, courtyards, pavilions, loggias, lakes, rivers, gardens - the possibilities were endless. Although not the exclusive property of courts (they were cultivated also by academics and institutions such as colleges and 9 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview convents), the serenata encapsulates more fully than any other genre the essence of the 'courtly' in music. Crudely stated, the music at any court was as good as the purse of its ruler was deep and his commitment high, for musicians would willingly flock to wherever they could enjoy superior pay, conditions and recognition. This made the state of music particularly vulnerable to fluctuating interest and financial investment among successive rulers. The discontinuity shown by Mantua is not untypical. Under Vincenzo I (reigned 1 587-1612) music flourished under masters such as Giaches de Wert, Benedetto Pallavicino, Salamone Rossi and Monteverdi; but the caprice or lack of interest of his successor, Francesco II, resulted in Monteverdi's abrupt dismissal and ushered in a period of quiescent mediocrity aggravated by uncertainties of dynastic succession, until the last Gonzaga duke, Ferdinando Carlo (reigned 1 665-1 708) splendidly - and ruinously - revived musical life, engaging Antonio Caldara as his director. After the Habsburg takeover the first governor, Prince Philip of Hessen-Darmstadt (in office 1714-35), maintained the high standards, enticing Vivaldi from Venice to become his maestro di cappella da camera (director of secular music including opera) between 17 18 and 1720; he also acted as patron to Locatelli. When Philip was recalled to Vienna the government of Mantua passed for some years to the Milanese authorities, and the lustre of musical activity once more dimmed. The personal taste of a ruler inevitably determined the emphases in musical life. Under Francesco II of Modena it was not opera but oratorio (100 performed between 1680 and 1691) that dominated vocal music; in instrumental music the sonata da camera^ in the hands of such excellent resident composers as Giuseppe Colombi, G. B. Vitali and G. M. Bononcini, enjoyed special favour. In addition, Francesco was an assiduous collector of secular vocal music (cantatas, oratorios, operas) that today forms a valuable nucleus of the music in the Biblioteca Estense. Apart from the courts of rulers there existed a host of petty or subsidiary courts formed by other members of ruling families, the minor nobility, high prelates and ambassadors. In the usage of the time the term 'court' refers to a style of life to which anyone of sufficient rank (and unearned income) could aspire with social approval. In Florence, where Grand Duke Cosimo III (reigned 1 670-1 721) inter- ested himself more in religion than music, his son Ferdinando (lived 1663-17 13; he was sometimes honorifically styled 'Ferdinando IIP, although he did not live to succeed his father) established around 1690 a brilliant court with a private theatre in the Villa di Pratolino, an associated church (S Felicita) and a regular scries of concerts held in the prince's apartments. The composers indebted to Ferdinando for patronage included Antonio Veracini, the two Scarlattis, Albinoni and Handel. A good keyboard player himself, Ferdinando provided the workshop where Bartolomco Cristofori built, just before 1700, the first piano. In Rome in those years a comparable role was performed by cardinals (Pamphili, Ottoboni) and feudal princes (Caetani, Ruspoli), who between them supported a vast army of rank-and-file musicians giving their services now to one, now to the other patron. Courts frequently travelled, commuting seasonally between city and country residences and, in slimmer form, accompanying the head of the court on his or her travels abroad. When Vincenzo I went to the Turkish wars in 1595, Monteverdi had to follow him to Hungary. State visits, which entailed the exchange of musical compliments between visitor and visited, provided the musicians of one locality 10 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview with a rare opportunity to meet those of another and promoted the diffusion of new styles. Visiting Venice in 17 16, the electoral prince of Saxony, Friedrich August, brought with him an elite group of musicians who used their stay for two distinct purposes: their first task was to entertain the prince and repay his hosts with music; but they also followed an old German tradition of using Italy as a 'finishing school' to which, in other circumstances, they might have been sent on leave. The third main source of institutional support for music was the opera. We have no space to deal in detail with its music and dramaturgy, but some broad features of its organization within Italy deserve mention. The opera houses themselves were built and owned by members of the aristocracy, individually or in consortium, but their management was commonly entrusted, season by season, to independent entrepreneurs who paid the lease of the building and all the other costs, hoping eventually to gain a profit. Most of an impresario's takings would not materialize until the time of the performances, when tickets of admittance to the parterre would be sold nightly at the door (and an extra charge made for seats, if required). However, a useful fund of working capital could be secured before the season opened through the leasing out of boxes for its duration to an inner circle of wealthy patrons; the same box was often taken by a member of the same family every season, giving the appearance of an inherited asset. In Venice and some other important centres the principal - often the only - season was that of 'Carnival', which in Venice ran from Boxing Day to Shrove Tuesday, long enough to take up to three successive operas. Venice also had a shorter 'autumn' season which ought to be regarded as the preliminary part of the Carnival season, since management and singers rarely changed; this began in mid November, when enough of the nobility had returned from their second villeggiatura of the year, and ended in mid December. In Naples, however, the corresponding pair of seasons occurred two months earlier. Provincial centres such as Ancona or Ferrara had to be content with brief seasons in the spring or summer organized by touring companies based in one of the metropolitan centres. This arrangement was highly rational since it paralleled the seasonal movement of the nobility between town and country and gave operatic singers the chance to fill an otherwise fallow stretch between winter and autumn. The most expensive item in the impresario's budget was the cast of singers. In the late Baroque period he would need a set of singers, often four, for the principal roles containing several arias apiece, and two or three further singers for the minor roles with only a token aria, if that. For a season 'star' singers such as Faustina Bordoni or Farinelli could command fees of over 1000 sequins, or about £450 in contemporary British money. In addition, a pair of comic singers for the intermezzi or a corps de ballet for danced entr'actes might be needed. Small wonder that impresarios desperately sought to cut costs by reducing or eliminating the chorus and retrenching the stage machinery that in the 17th century had been one of the glories of opera. The singers were predominantly high voices, the males being castratos or falset- tists. It was perfectly normal to sing the part of a character of the opposite sex: what mattered was the voice per se. Tenors and basses were not excluded, but tended to sing less prominent roles - except in comic intermezzi, where the male singer was always a basso buffo. Once the cast had been engaged, the impresario had to find a 'drama'. This could 11 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview be specially commissioned from a poet and thus perfectly tailored to requirements, or an old drama could be used, most likely with some adaptation. The civil and ecclesiastical censorship operating all over Italy required texts to be submitted for prior approval, and then printed so that what was sung could be compared with what had been approved. The poet or the impresario would have the libretto printed at his own expense and hope to cover costs by its sale to opera-goers and through the generosity of the patron to whom it was dedicated. Such librettos, as well as being complete 'programmes' in the modern sense, presented the text in an ideal literary form intended to be valued on that account by connoisseurs of literature and bibliophiles, quite irrespective of the composer's contribution. The music could be commissioned in the same way as the literary text. If, on the other hand, an earlier setting was appropriated, it was likely that alterations would be made, if only because the combination of voices would rarely be the same as in the earlier production. The universal adoption of da capo form in the years before 1700 turned the aria into a fully detachable and readily transferable unit. Since these arias did not deal with the specifics of a plot - significantly, personal names are rarely mentioned in them - but expressed in a conventional, generalized way states of mind such as anger, fortitude and tenderness, they lent themselves easily to new contexts: hence the ready-made arie di baule, or 'suitcase arias', with which singers liked to travel, and the pasticci cobbled together from texts and musical settings of diverse origins. Each theatre had its stock of scenery representing palace antechambers, woodland glades, rocky promontories, or whatever; the system of gliding wings on rails attached to a winch concealed underneath the stage, an invention of Giacomo Torelli (1608- 78), made rapid scene changes and near-instantaneous transformations part of the general operatic vocabulary. An average of two or three changes of set in each of the three acts was expected. In the terminology of the time the much more numerous changes of 'scene' refer not to the scenery but to an alteration of the characters on stage brought about by an entrance or an exit. Since it was customary for a singer to sweep off the stage to applause after his aria, most arias occur, almost by definition, at the end of a scene, in the so-called 'exit' position. Baroque opera was a co-operative but not fully integrated endeavour. Its successful marriage of music, words and spectacle was founded on the assumption that each party - librettist, composer, singer, painter, engineer - acted autonomously but anticipated (that is, knew from experience) the style and approach of the others: a perfect recipe for conservatism. The potential reusability of each component, with consequent saving of work and expense, favoured adherence to convention. It is significant that it was not public opera but court opera (see Plate 2), subject to autocratic direction and less inhibited by budgetary considerations, that spearheaded the reform movement in the age of Gluck. Whatever its artistic limitations, the public opera of Baroque Italy was a truly popular musical-dramatic form such as existed nowhere else at the time in Europe. It was, in effect, the national theatre, since spoken tragedy and comedy had a much more restricted appeal. The obverse of this popularity was the notoriously casual behaviour of Italian audiences, perceptively commented on by Burney in these words: 'I shall have frequent occasion to mention the noise and inattention at the musical exhibitions in Italy; but music there is cheap and common, whereas in England it is a costly exotic, and more highly prized'.2 12 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview This easy access to music implied the existence of large numbers of professional musicians. Musical skills, like those of any other trade, were most commonly acquired in the family circle, as one can easily see from the membership lists of musicians' guilds and associations. Famous musical dynasties such as the Scarlattis in Naples, the Laurentis in Bologna and the Somis family in Turin were only the most talented and successful representatives of a general pattern. Seminaries also imparted the rudiments of music to their students, and the Scuole pie of Bologna contributed much to the unrivalled tradition of singing in that ciy. Some musicians established schools of music in their own homes, though these amounted to little more than a group of private pupils. For a more institutionalized and systematic mode of music teaching we have to turn to the so-called conservatories of Naples and Venice. The four Neapolitan conservatories — S Maria di Loreto, S Maria della Pieta dei Turchini, Poveri di Gesu Cristo and S Onofrio a Capuana - originally catered only for orphaned boys, though their success later brought in fee-paying male students, some even from abroad. Three were state-supported and one (the Gesu Cristo) was under the archbishop. The aim of the conservatories was to prepare those boys showing talent for a musical career, in which they were notably successful, as one can see from the list of their ex-pupils, which includes the names of Mancini, Sarro, Porpora, Vinci, Leo and Pergolesi. Every effort was made to integrate the boys into the general musical life of the city, and their services were frequently hired out. That their conditions of study were not always ideal is amusingly commemorated in Burncy's description of a 'Dutch concert' at S Onofrio, where all manner of sounds from students practising cheek by jowl mingled cacophonously. The character and aims of the four Venetian conservatories, called ospitali (or, in Venetian fashion, ospedali), were very different. The Pieta, by far the largest of the four, took in foundlings; the others (the Mendicanti, the Incurabili and the Ospedaletto) catered for orphans and the poor. Boys did not figure prominently at the ospedali, since they left at an early age to serve apprenticeships. The girls were divided into commoners, who were trained in ordinary domestic duties, and figlie di coro, who were to staff the chapel choir and orchestra of their institution. On reaching adulthood some of the girls were permitted to marry (albeit with difficulty if they were good musicians) and some entered convents, but large numbers stayed on for the rest of their lives. Musical training was provided purely for the benefit of the ospedali, whose well-advertised services attracted large congregations and brought in revenue through the hiring out of seats and the generosity of benefactors; it was in fact the custom to insist that figlie released into matrimony undertook, in their marriage contract, not to sing in public. As in all female convents, the performers had to be screened off for the sake of their modesty from the congregation, a task accomplished by grilles and gauzes. The element of mystery that this occasioned - would the sight of a particular figlia be as angelic as her sound? - caught the fancy of several writers, notably Rousseau. In each institution the figlie di coro were organized in a pyramidal hierarchy serving both musical and disciplinary ends. At the Pieta, for instance, the coro was headed by two maestre di coro, who had under them a cadre of other maestre, followed by the ordinary members of the coro and then the beginners and others not yet admitted into the coro; 14 figlie were 'privileged' that is, they were allowed to give musical instruction to girls from patrician families coming in from outside. For 13 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview many purposes the coro was self-sufficient, supplying from within its ranks all the necessary teaching and performing expertise. All the ospedali employed a male musical director {maestro di coro), whose most important task was the composition of new works, and a teacher of singing. Teachers of instruments were hired and fired as the need arose; the legendary association of Vivaldi with the Pieta was much less continuous than has popularly been supposed, for he was out of its service in 1 7 10, 1718-34 and after 1738, preserving the relationship, if at all, merely through the sale of compositions. The Pieta, which had the best reputation for instrumental music among the Venetian conservatories, prided itself on the variety of its instruments; in Vivaldi's period these included, among the strings, the viola d'amore and a full consort of viole alFinglese (similar to the former but with more numerous sympathetic strings) and, among the woodwind, the chalumeau and the clarinet. Venice's exceptionally close contact, through trade and travel, with the German-speaking lands made her particularly receptive to several instruments, including the above, that were widely known beyond the Alps but rare in Italy. Strangely, Venice was slower than a number of other Italian centres to take up the oboe and, especially, the transverse flute, which does not seem to have been played in public there before the 1720s. In Italy, even more than elsewhere, the instruments of the violin family held sway. We know from the reports of Andre Maugars and Thomas Hill that by the middle of the 17th century the viol family had fallen into disuse there. By 1600 Cremona had already become the leading European centre of violin-making; it remained so until the end of the Baroque, thanks to the Amati, Bergonzi, Guarneri, Rugeri and Stradivari families, though Venice (Bellosio, Gobetti, Goffriller, Mon- tagnana, Serafin) eventually ran it close. In the 1 7th century, when ensemble music for strings commonly required two or even three viola parts, violas were manufactured both in small (alto) and large (tenore) sizes corresponding to the register in which their parts were respectively written. Towards the end of the century, when the practice of limiting the violas to a single alto part became general, the manufacture of violas dropped sharply. Indeed, the pendulum swung even further, so that from the 1720s onwards, particularly in Rome and Naples, one finds much orchestral writing that dispenses altogether with the viola, a practice strongly deplored by Algarotti in his Saggio sopra I 'opera in musica (1755). 'Violone' was the all-purpose name given to the bass instruments, which ranged from an instrument tuned like the cello but of larger dimensions to a true contrabass instrument (violone grosso); the violoncello (or violoncino) proper came into being around the middle of the 17th century, at first as an instrument playing a line distinct from, and often more elaborate than, the continuo part. In the 1 8th century this smaller instrument replaced the type of violone playing at 'eight-foot' pitch, leaving the 'sixteen-foot' instrument as the sole bearer of that name. Italian organs and harpsichords were of characteristic design and strongly influ- enced the style of the music written for them. Unlike contemporary French and German organs, which had an extended pedalboard, and English organs, which usually had none, Italian organs had about an octave of pedal 'pulldowns' good for little more than sustaining the occasional pedal-note rather in the manner of the sostenuto pedal on a Steinway grand piano. Italian organ music of the Baroque period differs technically (as opposed to gcncrically) little from harpsichord music 14 Copyrighted material Art Italian Overview beyond a greater commitment to counterpoint and a more sustained manner. The Italian Baroque harpsichord spurned the complexities of north European instruments; it rarely had more than one manual and emphasized brightness and clarity over power and tonal variety. The simplicity and portability of Italian harpsichords caused them often to be used for accompaniment in multiples, like the portative organs described earlier, hence the frequency of the direction 'senza cembali' (rather than 'senza cembalo') in musical scores. Whereas the countries of north-west Europe began the Baroque period with quite modest music-publishing industries but ended it with flourishing, large-scale ones, the fortunes of the Italian music-publishing industry followed, if anything, the reverse path. These divergent trends clearly have technological, economic, socio- logical and purely musical dimensions, and we still await the studies that would enable us to understand fully their complex relationship. Meanwhile, one can point to at least some of the factors involved. In Italy the art of engraving music, the result of which is to present the music in a form similar to the handwritten but more regular, never took root; there was no publisher employing this technique to compare with Estienne Roger in Amsterdam, John Walsh in London or Charles-Nicolas Le Clerc in Paris. Instead, Italy remained faithful to the process, perfected in the 16th century, of printing music in a single impression from movable type. Cumbersome and unsightly at best, this form of reproduction posed acute problems to the compositor (for instance, how could symbols in standard lengths such as ties or slurs be matched accurately to the enormous variety of distance between note-heads?), and consequently problems of interpretation to the reader. It could not beam quavers and shorter values together, a fact that both reduced legibility and wasted space. Above all, it was expensive and grew increasingly so. Relatively little music was published by Italian printers at their own expense, thus as a commercial venture stimulated by public demand. Rather, the conditions resembled those of the modern 'private' publication; the composer or his patron paid the printer for the full cost of his work and then made arrangements to place the bulk of the edition on sale through the same printer's bookshop. After use the type was distributed and would need to be reset in the event of a new edition (whereas the plates of an engraved edition could be stored and reused whenever needed, so that a purchaser could quite literally order a 'customized' example of a work). To a limited extent Italian printer-booksellers exchanged their stock in order to put works into wider circulation, but no properly organized national, let alone international, sales network comparable with that of Roger ever developed. Examples of Italian editions of musical works from the 16th to the 1 8th century abound in north European libraries, but these are rarely 'exported' copies; they were bought at source by visitors to Italy. Music was published either for reasons of prestige - in which case it represented, so to speak, a long-term investment by the composer - or because it belonged to a popular genre and medium guaranteeing that the volume of sales would bring unit costs down to or below those of handwritten copies. In the early 17th century, when Venice was the dominant centre of music printing in Italy, sacred and secular vocal music in four or five parts formed the core of the repertory; in the late 17th century, when Bologna joined and soon overtook Venice, the focus of attention switched to instrumental music: sonatas and the incipient concerto. In the first decade of the 1 8th century the spectacular rise of Amsterdam and London, where music printed 15 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview in Italy could expect to be 'pirated' within a few years and then sold to a far wider (in all senses) music-buying public, caused a very severe contraction in Italian music publishing, from which it did not recover until the next century. We know from the prefaces of works published in Rome during this critical period by the minor but by no means negligible violinist-composer Giuseppe Valentini that having one's music printed could be prohibitively expensive; in fact, Valentini supplies whole lists of works of his awaiting publication if only a Maecenas will provide the necessary subvention. Although we do not yet know the details of composers' contracts with their publishers in Amsterdam and elsewhere beyond the Alps, it is clear that publication entailed no great expense to them - perhaps rather the reverse - since dedications are so often absent. In 171 1 Vivaldi, who had previously entrusted his works to first one (Sala) and then another (Bortoli) local printer, sent his third opus, L'estro armonico, directly to Roger in Amsterdam, pointedly disparaging the Italian publishers in his foreword; en masse, other Italian composers followed his lead, setting in motion a vicious spiral. One unintended consequence of this new direct relationship between Italian composers of instrumental music and transalpine pub- lishers was that the former came, gradually, to shape their style according to the dictates of northern rather than indigenous taste; in contrast, vocal music, which was rarely published at that time, preserved its specifically Italian character. When the ascendancy of German music became confirmed later in the century, Italian instrumental music found itself without a 'home base' to which it could retreat for recuperation, whereas Italian vocal music continued much as before. Two further, mutually related factors worked against the success of music pub- lishing in late-Baroque Italy: the highly developed music-copying industry and the cphemerality of public taste. Some words of Burney sum up the situation as it had already existed for several decades before 1771: 'The art of engraving music there [Venice] seems to be utterly lost, as I was not able to find a single work printed in the manner we print music in England. [ .. .] Musical compositions are so short- lived in Italy, such is the rage for novelty, that for the few copies wanted, it is not worth while to be at the expence of engraving, and of the rolling-press. Indeed there, as in Turkey, the business of a transcriber furnishes employment for so many people, that it is cruel to wish to rob them of it, especially as that trade seems more brisk and profitable than any other.'3 Music copying benefited from the fact that Italy had pioneered the manufacture of music manuscript paper as understood today. In Venice we find, from around 1700 or earlier, special music paper on which, by means of a combination rastrum (Paul Everett's term for a fixed assembly of multi-nibbed instruments (rastra) capable of drawing several staves at a time), 10, 12 or more stave-lines have been ruled four times on each side of an extra-large sheet of thick paper, which, folded twice and cut, yields a quire of four leaves. In Rome and Bologna we find a similar system in use, except that there the staves are ruled after the folding and cutting. The fact that manuscript paper was acquired by composers in ready-made form sometimes influenced the scoring of the music in a way that underlines how heavily conditioned by practical considerations the world of 18th-century music could become. In the popular 10-stavc paper, for example, there was an incentive to limit the number of staves used to five so that two systems could be fitted in on every page; hence the high incidence of arias in which the staff occupied by the viola in the instrumental ritornellos is elsewhere taken over by the voice, causing the viola 16 Copyrighted material An Italian Overview to drop out, or of double concertos for violin in which the second soloist appropriates the staff belonging to the orchestral first v iolins. Copyists frequently worked in collectives ('copying shops'), dividing the work of writing out the parts or score of a single composition between several hands. As Burney says, they were well paid, earning about 15 soldi (fourpence) per completed quire. They were the indispensable intermediaries between Italian composers and foreign visitors; many an anthology of cantatas or operatic arias taken back to England must owe its choice of works to the recommendation (and priv ileged access to music) of copyists. Charles Jcnncns's description of Italy as 'the Land of Musick' - intentionally ironical, since he was only too aware of its symptoms of decline at the time of writing (1739) - gives one image of Italy in foreign eyes that remained constant during the 150 years from Monteverdi to Galuppi. In a purely quantitative sense it was indisputably true; the social 'investment' in music was higher in Italy than anywhere else, though one must remember that in the second half of the period, through tourism and the emigration of musicians, the 'dividends' were increasingly exported. It has often been suggested that the continued flourishing of Italian music amid conditions of economic decline and political instability was a case of 'far bella figura' in the spirit of an ageing beauty applying an ever greater quantity of cosmetics. In reality, the causes of Italian backwardness were the same as those of its pre-eminence in music: the persistence of feudal social relations. It was the 'done thing' for the nobility to endow churches, patronize the opera and give direct employment to musicians, thus providing the economic sustenance for music's cultivation. In an interesting passage referring to the year 1735 Goldoni comments that dedications (of librettos, but the point must surely be equally valid for music) 'had declined from the good fortune they had enjoyed in former times':4 fewer persons of quality wished to play Maecenas. So we end the Baroque period in Italy not only at the point where sonata form is introduced or where the hegemony of instrumental music dominated by Germans begins, but also at the point where the old, aristocratic order begins to disintegrate while the new, bourgeois order is still far from consolidation.

Savoy courtier, diplomat, poet, choreo- grapher and composer. Count Aglie was a gifted aristocrat who served Cardinal Mau- rizio of Savoy in Turin, then Duke Carlo Emanuele I ( 1 630-7) and finally Duchess Cri- stina, as her chief counsellor and confidant. He spent four years in Paris at the end of the reign of Louis XIII (1640-3), where he would have attended a variety of French court spec- tacles. For Turin he wrote or devised at least 30 entertainments between 1624 and 1660 ballets (which he choreographed in the French style), plays with music, water displays and carousels, which he tailored to the tastes, per- sonalities and political climate at the Savoy court.

Angclo Maria Fiore (r 1660- 1723) was a cellist and composer at the Parma court (1688-95) ano* a'so played in the church orchestra of Madonna della Stcccata (1689- 95), before taking up a post at the ducal court in Turin. There his reputation as a virtuoso cellist flowered, and he attracted distinguished pupils. In 1698 he published his Trattentmentt da camera, a collection of duets for cello and harpsichord or violin and cello. Earlier, in 1697, he and his young son Andrea Stefano (1686- 1732) were inducted as members of the Accademia Filarmonica in Bologna. Andrea Stefano was a child prodigy who by the age of 13 already held a post as musico di camera to the Duke of Savoy and had published a collection of trio sonatas (Sin- Jonie da chiesa). He studied in Rome during the period 1703-7 and composed operas for the Milan Carnivals of 1706 (Stdonio; text by Pariati) and 1707 (La casta Penelope; text by Pariati), before being appointed maestro di cappella of the Turin court in 1707. By then the Teatro Regio was closed and, until it re- opened in 1715, Fiore was free to compose operas for Vienna ( 1 708- 1 0), Barcelona ( 1 7 1 1 ) 18 and Reggio Emilia (1713); he composed // trionfo <TAmore for the reopening. When Quant z visited Turin in 1726 he was full of praise for Fiore's orchestra, which was led by G.B. Somis. Ghignone,Giovanni Pietro. See France / Paris and Versailles [Guignon, Jean-Pierre].

She was a poet and composer of Masses, motets, sacred concertos and sonatas which she published in 20 collections (1 665-1 700) in Bologna, Milan and Venice. She set many of her own highly expressive texts, sometimes interrupting arias with recitatives; in the sacred concertos she employed violins. Her first published music appeared in a collection (1640) by Gasparo Casati, maestro di cappella of Novara Cathedral. Juvarra, Filippo. See Italy 7 Papal States: Rome. Lalouette, Jean Francois. See France / Paris and Versailles. Lanzetti, Salvatore (ti 7 10-80). Neapolitan cellist and composer who contributed to the changing image of the cello as a solo instru- ment, independent of continuo functions. After training at the Naples Conservatory di 5 Maria di Loreto, Lanzetti worked at the Lucca court chapel, before taking up a perma- nent appointment at the Turin court of Vittorio Amcdeo II in 1727. He spent much of his career on tour in Europe and at least 15 years in London (late i730s-early 1750s), where he was highly acclaimed. In 1736 he became the first cello soloist to appear in Paris at the Concert Spirituel. His sonatas (his principal collection, op. 1, was published in Amsterdam in 1736) are technically as demanding as the Vivaldi violin concertos, particularly in terms of bowing, and reflect their grander pro- portions. La Pierre, Paul de (1612-after 1690). Pro- vencal violinist, dancing-master and composer who spent most of his career at the Turin Copyrighted material Italy 2 Lombardy court. La Pierre is first heard of at Dijon in 1640, performing in a ballet. From 1644 until 1 66 1 he led the Montpellier consulate's violin band, appearing with Moliere's troupe in a performance of the Ballet des incompatible* (1654). La Pierre first visited Turin in 1660, when a violin band from his native Avignon performed at the wedding celebrations of the Duke of Parma and Princess Margherita. He accepted a post there in 1662 as dancing- master to Carlo Emanuele II, charged with composing dance music for ballets and operas. In 1 67 1 he led the Turin court's equivalent of the Vingt-quatre Violons, which became the foundation of the Piedmont school of violin playing. Lonati, Carlo Ambrogio. See Italy 10 Itin- erant Musicians. Normand, Marco Roggero [Marc-Roger] (1663 -1734). French cousin of Francois Couperin, working from 1688 at the Turin court where he was known as 'Couprin'. Several years later Couperin initially passed off his own italianate sonatas, some of which were later incorporated into Les nations ( 1 726), as those of an Italian cousin. In 1690 Normand became attached to the household of the Prince of Carignan as a harpsichord teacher to the children; in 1699 he was appointed organist of the Turin royal chapel by the King of Sardinia, Vittorio Amedco II.

Rover, Joscph-Nicolas-Pancrace. See France / Paris and Versailles. Senesino. See Italy 10 Itinerant Musicians. Somis, Giovanni Battista (1686 1763). Violinist, influential teacher and composer. Generations of the Somis family had held musicians' posts in the ducal chapel at Turin before Giovanni Battista became a violinist there in 1699. He had been taught the violin by his father, Francesco Lorenzo ( 1 663-1 736), but in 1703 he was sent to Rome to study with Corelli (he may also have travelled to Venice to study with Vivaldi). When he returned to Turin in 1707 he was made maestro di violino and capo di cappella, posts he retained to the end of his life. Although he toured very little - in 1733 he went to Paris where he played at the Concert Spirituel and published his opp. 4 and 5 sonatas and trios (and in 1740 the cello sonatas and opp. 7 and 8, conceived for amateurs) - his playing and teaching exerted an influence comparable to that of Tartini. I lis Italian pupils included Gaetano Pugnani (later Viotti's teacher) and G. P. Ghignone, and among the French who sought him out were J.-M. Leclair Faint ''and L.-G. Guillemain. He composed as many as 150 concertos, all but nine of which arc lost; those that do survive reveal a style halfway between Vivaldi and Tartini. Somis is important as a sonata composer for the way in which he smoothed the distinctions between church and chamber sonatas, short- ening the latter to three movements (slow- fast fast) and leaving off dance titles, except in op. 6. I lis first allegro movements are cast in an incipient Classical sonata form, whereas his slow movements hark back to the sonata da chtesa. Stradclla, Alessandro. See Italy 7 Papal States: Rome. 2 Lombardy Aliprandi, Bernardo. See Central Europe / South Germany: Munich. Amati, Nicola (1596- 1684). Important Cre- moncsc v iolin maker whose students included Andrea Guarneri, Francesco Rugeri, G.B. Rogeri, Giacomo Gennaro and Antonio Stra- divari. Nicola Amati was the grandson of Andrea (d before 1 580), who was responsible for formulating the proportions of the modern violin, viola and cello. The plague which struck in the early 1630s left Nicola virtually the only Italian violin maker of any stature and the sole exponent of the Cremonese tra- dition. To remedy this situation he took on many gifted pupils and, ultimately, was sur- passed not by his own son, Girolamo (1649- 1740), but by Antonio Stradivari. Nicola's most prized instruments are those built to his own wider design, the 'Grand Amati', and are elegant in every detail. Assandra, Caterina (// 1609). Nun at the Convent of S Agata at Lomello (nr Milan) and an early composer of concertato motets. Only her op. 2 Motetti (1609, in two and three parts with continuo) survive. Bononcini, Giovanni.

Donati, Ignazio. See Italy 10 Itinerant Musicians. Fontana, Giovanni Battista. See Italy 4 Venice. Grancino, Giovanni {ft c 1685-r 1726). The most important Milanese violin maker before G.B. Guadagnini and the teacher of C.G. Testore. Grancino's instruments, based on Amati patterns, arc less pretentious in appear- ance than those made for wealthier clients in Cremona. Many of his cellos have survived, though most have been cut down in size. Grandi, Alessandro. See Italy 4 Venice. Guameri. Three generations of Cremonese violin makers. Andrea (ci 626-98) was appren- ticed to Nicola Amati in 1641. Yet, in spite of this influence, he was one of the first to make smaller cellos. I lis eldest son, Pietro Giovanni (1655- 1720), left Cremona for Mantua where he became a eourt musician; the few instru- ments he made reveal the hand of a per- fectionist. Andrea's younger son, Giuseppe Giovanni Battista (1666-f 1739), who became his father's assistant, inherited the business. The cellos he made, dating from the 1690s, are particularly fine. From 171 5 he was assisted by his two sons. After learning the craft, Pietro (1695 -1 762) went to Venice where he was influenced by the work of Matteo Goffriller, Domenico Montagnana and Carlo Tononi; his instruments from the period 1730 to 1750 are much esteemed. Bartolomeo Giuseppe, known as 'del Gesu' (1698- 1744), was a highly original maker whose instruments - prized for their responsiveness, strength and extra- ordinary beauty of tone - rank with those of Antonio Stradivari.

Virtuoso instrumentalist (violin, viol and flute), composer and the author of an important treatise, Selva de varii passaggi (1620), in which he differentiated between vocal and instrumental diminutions and described complex bow strokes. Rognoni was the son of Riccardo Rognoni (d 1619/20), an instrumentalist and the author of a didactic treatise (1592) in which he addressed the differences between diminutions for string and wind instruments, and also devoted con- siderable space to the bow stroke. Francesco's first appointment was at the Polish court of Sigismund III, but he soon returned to Italy, settling in Milan. From 1610 he served the Prince of Masserano and from 161 3 until 1624 he was director of music to the governor of Milan. His last appointment was as maestro di cappella of S Ambrogio. He was knighted and made a count Palatine. Rugeri, Francesco [4I1 Per'] (1620-^1695). The first Cremonese violin maker to make smaller cellos (in advance of Andrea Guarneri and Antonio Stradivari). Rugeri was Nicola Amati's first pupil and appears to have initially exported his own instruments with his teach- er's label on them; after 1670 he usually signed them 'II Per'. His sons Vincenzo and Giacinto {ft 1675-1730) worked with him, though neither achieved their father's greatness. From 1685 Francesco lived in Modena. Sammartini, Giovanni Battista (1700/01- 75). Important Milanese composer of sacred vocal and orchestral music. In contrast to his elder brother Giuseppe, Giovanni Battista remained all his life in their native Milan where he served as maestro di cappella for as many as 1 1 churches at any given time. In 1758 he helped to found a Milanese philharmonic society, after nurturing orchestral playing there over many years. His music - sonatas, quartets and quintets, concertos, overtures and smfonte - circulated widely and was pub- lished as far afield as London (where Giuseppe resided); other sonatas and symphonies were falsely attributed to him.
