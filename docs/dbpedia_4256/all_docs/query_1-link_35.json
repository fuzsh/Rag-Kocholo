        "text": "English actor Bob Hoskins passed away today at the age of 71. His thespian accomplishments are too numerous to mention, although this writer particularly recommends seeing him in Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (1985) and in Mermaids (1990). I mention him here, however, because of his starring role in Dennis Potter’s 1978 television mini-series “Pennies from Heaven” as Arthur Parker, a traveling sheet music salesman, for which he won a BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor. That show reintroduced a younger generation to the British dance band music of the 1930s, and has notable actors miming original recordings, one of which is featured here for obvious reasons.\n\nBob Hoskins as Elsie Carlisle, singing “The Clouds Will Soon Roll By”:\n\nDennis Potter’s ‘Pennies From Heaven’ – ‘The Clouds Will Soon Roll By’\n\nVideo from songanddanceman1234 (YouTube)\n\nI wonder how many people first encountered Elsie Carlisle’s music through the 1978 Dennis Potter BBC television series Pennies from Heaven (or through the 1981 movie based on it)?\n\nThis clip has Cheryl Campbell miming “You’ve Got Me Crying Again”:\n\nDennis Potter’s ‘Pennies From Heaven’ – ‘You’ve Got Me Crying Again’\n\nVideo from songanddanceman1234 (YouTube)\n\nAnd here is Bob Hoskins miming “The Clouds Will Soon Roll By” (the Ambrose version):\n\nDennis Potter’s ‘Pennies From Heaven’ – ‘The Clouds Will Soon Roll By’\n\nVideo from songanddanceman1234 (YouTube)"
