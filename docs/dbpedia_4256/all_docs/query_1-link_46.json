        "text": "ABOUT TOM & THE STUDIO\n\nOver the course of a career spanning four decades, Tom Todoroff has coached, produced, directed and acted alongside some of the most celebrated and respected names in theater, film and television and rock & roll. Check out this video to learn more about his background!\n\n“Tommy, you're the Invisible Coral Reefer. You hear stuff that only dogs hear and see stuff that only eagles see! I want you to know how much I've learned from you. You always give me great inspiration.”\n\nJimmy Buffett\n\nBlanca B\n\n\"This workshop isn't just about acting - it's about life and how our responsibility to ourselves and to our craft are eternally intertwined. \"To Thine Own Self Be True.\" If we can face our life with truth, humor and passion, our acting will follow.\"\n\nScott L\n\n\"Amazing class experience with a palpable feeling of community and family. Everyone was supportive, nurturing and ready to learn. I was especially touched to see people from Chile, Australia, Jakarta and everywhere in between. Some were online at 3am, others were getting their kids off to school. I felt like I was truly part of something bigger than myself.\"\n\nJagruti P\n\n\"If you're dedicated to fast-forwarding your career, you must attend this online acting class. It will guide you to understanding yourself and the business.\"\n\nChristina C\n\n\"Wanted to share I'm running to attend a rehearsal for a new production I've been cast in. I cannot express how GRATEFUL I am for Emily and Tom and this INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY. It has been a huge blessing in my life and doing the work here is what's gotten me the work out there!!! I appreciate you all more than I can express!\"\n\nLaurie K\n\n\"Best acting (and life) training imaginable. I learned more in one day with Tom than I ever learned in a University semester. Core principles to guide the actor which overflow into life in general. I'm a stronger actor AND human, thanks to this class.\"\n\nLars C\n\n\"Tom's ability to redirect a sub-par performance into a bookable one is remarkable and a thing of beauty to watch. He also teaches from a very clear and organized framework, which - when learned and followed - allows us to self-diagnose and make top level choices ourselves rather than being fully dependent on his direction.\""
