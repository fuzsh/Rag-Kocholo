        "text": "The hard man from the East End who ended up conquering Hollywood\n\n'I'm just a short fat bald guy who got lucky. Where's the glamour?' said Bob Hoskins\n\n'First I got stabbed in the shoulder and the top of my nose - which really now is just a big hole,' says veteran British actor Bob Hoskins, ruefully fingering the beaten bridge of his nose.\n\n'Then I got stabbed in the stomach.' His hand instinctively moves to protect the spot. 'I was looking at a knife sticking out of my belly thinking, \"He's killed me!'''\n\nThe legendary actor rolls up his shirt sleeve to reveal another scar, inches long, down his right arm. He is talking as though these attacks happened yesterday, instead of peppering his youth spent on the mean streets of Finsbury Park, north London, during the Fifties.\n\nHow did the stabbing happen?\n\n'Too much mouth and nothing to back it up with, love. That's basically what it was. I should've backed down and shut up.' He pats his stomach.\n\n'But the knife couldn't have gone in very far because it eventually fell out.' He laughs, a raucous, reverberating laugh. 'I went home and had a bath in the kitchen. Of course, my mum was upset. But that's what happened back then. You got through it. You survived.'\n\nIt could easily be a scene from one of the bleak, violent gangster movies that have defined Hoskins's career. Those indelible, pitch-perfect performances like Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday in 1980, or his Oscar-nominated role as George in Neil Jordan's Mona Lisa in 1986. But this is Hoskins talking about the brutal realities of his upbringing. With his gravelly voice and a pronounced Cockney accent, he explains how he was able to portray hard men so convincingly.\n\n'There was a lot of crime, of course, in the Forties and Fifties - robberies, old people getting mugged. There were gangs around Finsbury Park and Haringey. They had knives and coshes and sticks. It was quite violent and it didn't take a lot to get into a fight. You just had to look the wrong way. We were all thugs, love. If I wasn't an actor I'd probably have been a serial killer or a burglar - something like that,' he chuckles.\n\nDespite the hard man image, Hoskins, 67, has sidestepped being typecast during his career. For every tough-guy role there's been a heart-warming performance as the shy romantic with a heart of gold - from salesman Arthur Parker in Dennis Potter's BBC series Pennies From Heaven to his biggest mainstream Hollywood hit, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\n'I became a professional actor overnight and then I thought, I've got to learn to do this, because people are paying to see me,' said Bob\n\nToday, like his contemporaries Sir Michael Caine and Dame Judi Dench, Hoskins sits comfortably among the best of British acting talent - though he is still without a knighthood. As we sit down in a rare interview to discuss his new film Made In Dagenham - a Brit flick about the Ford car plant strikes in the Sixties demanding equal pay for women - I find Hoskins unusually loquacious about his origins.\n\n'I remember going into the Krays' house once and they had a washing line hanging up in one of the alcoves in the wall of the house, with all these handmade suits hanging up.'\n\nWere they friends?\n\n'I knew them but I wouldn't say I was a friend - they didn't 'ave any.'\n\nAnother resounding laugh.\n\n'The middle classes think the working classes want the big house and the swimming pool. Well, you take the Kray twins: they still lived in a council flat.\n\n'Back then it was all booze. Now drugs is the big thing because there's so much money. You take drugs and you do anything: it makes you crazy.\n\n'Our flat was tiny. I had a put-you-up in the front room. We had a bath in the kitchen. The point is you didn't really know anything else; that's how life was. I looked around and all my mates were the same. It was a very skint area.'\n\nWas he involved in crime?\n\n'No. Mum and dad made me honest. They made me respect property and people.'\n\nHoskins's father was a clerk; his mother was a school cook then a teaching assistant. He says his mother was the formative influence.\n\n'I remember we were at a market down the East End and they lost me when I was about eight. We were with my aunt. My mum was crying. She said, \"Somebody's taken him,\" and my aunt said, \"If they 'ave they'll soon bring him back.\" I can't overstate the influence Mum had - she taught me fairness, justice, equal opportunity. She said to me, \"If somebody doesn't like you, they've got bad taste.\"\n\nOn the Krays: 'I knew them but I wouldn't say I was a friend - they didn't 'ave any'\n\n'I only really got to know my dad when my mum died and then he had dementia.'\n\nHoskins's accent becomes more pronounced as he launches into a nostalgic impersonation.\n\n'He phones me up and he says, \"'Ere, the Mafia are launderin' money through my bank account.\" I say, \"What are you talking about Dad? That's your pocket money that I'm givin' you that I put in your account.''' He smiles and shakes his head.\n\nHoskins is ostensibly all Cockney wit and self-deprecating humour: 'I'm just a short fat bald guy who got lucky. Where's the glamour?' But what he lacks in stature (he's 5ft 6in) he makes up for in charisma.\n\nA career in showbusiness never crossed his mind when he was young. He worked in a variety of jobs.\n\n'I was a market porter in Covent Garden,' he says. 'I trained to be an accountant and thought this is not for me, so I bummed around. I worked on a kibbutz in Israel and travelled the world.'\n\nThe acting began by chance in the late Sixties when his friend - an aspiring actor - took the young Hoskins along to an audition. 'I was waiting for him in the bar for quite a while and this guy came up and said, \"Right, you're next.\" I did the audition and they gave me the lead in the play. The first night an agent came to see it and he said, \"Look, you've got to take this up professionally.\" So I said, \"Get us a job and I will.\"\n\n'I became a professional actor overnight and then I thought, I've got to learn to do this, because people are paying to see me. So I read the experts. I read Stanislavski and that seemed obvious; I read Lee Strasberg and that seemed like looking busy to impress everyone. And I found out that men are completely emotionally crippled - we can't express ourselves - so I started watching women. I became an actor by becoming a stalker.'\n\nThere is another roar of laughter.\n\n'If I wasn't an actor I'd probably have been a serial killer or a burglar - something like that,' said Bob\n\n'I noticed the way that women genuinely react to things and I thought, if I can get that emotional honesty looking like I do, that will be worth watching.'\n\nHoskins insists that while many other workingclass stars were carried away with fame and money in the Sixties and Seventies, success never changed him.\n\n'I didn't rush out and buy clothes, I didn't go and buy my mum a fur coat, I just put it in the bank.'\n\nHe lived in rented flats. 'The only time I bought a house was when I met Linda (his second wife). I was nearly 40.'\n\nHoskins has always resisted the lure of Hollywood despite his success there. After acting with De Niro in Brazil the two became good friends.\n\n'He has only shown me kindness. He's a real friend. He's helped me shop for a merry-go-round for my wife's Christmas present. He's invited me round to meet his granny and he's come to my house for a pot-luck dinner. That really knocked my wife out. I think she was finally impressed with me.'\n\nBut while fiercely patriotic about Britain, Hoskins is far from happy about the current state of the country. 'In some ways Britain is going to the dogs,' he says.\n\n'We've got some of the worst politicians in the world. They just cut the UK Film Council, so it's going to be like Maggie Thatcher's England. She said arts and drama were left-wing and she meant it. Without the Film Council, the independent movie has had it. We need the arts most when we're under the kosh, when we're really having a bad time, when people need to be able to analyse and discuss things. Films like Made In Dagenhamdo that.'\n\nDid he vote for David Cameron or Nick Clegg in the election?\n\n'Nah,' he shouts, appalled. 'You got to be joking.' Does he have a message for the Prime Minister?\n\n'Look after the people, for Christ's sake. If you don't look after the people, the people will suffer and if the people suffer the country suffers, and if the country suffers forget it, because that's the end. We should've nationalised the banks and made loans easier for small businesses. Making people unemployed is going to cost the country a fortune in benefit. If you cut health, people won't be able to afford the doctors, they'll get sicker and sicker and eventually that's going to cost a fortune.\n\n'When I became a film star I thought they're going to find me out soon... but they never did,' said Bob\n\n'I think we've got to get back to the old Labour party. We gave Tony Blair a chance - what a bouncing giggling idiot he was. Blair's done more damage to the country than Maggie Thatcher.'\n\nHow would he feel about being included in the New Year's Honours and given a knighthood? He bangs his coffee cup on the table.\n\n'A knighthood? You got to be joking. I wouldn't know who I was. I would wake up in the morning and go, Sir who? Sir 'Oskins!'\n\nAnd if a knighthood was offered?\n\n'I'd turn it down.'\n\nIt's easy to see why the political themes of Made In Dagenham proved irresistible for Hoskins. He plays the likeable union rep who stands up for the women striking for equal pay at Ford's Dagenham plant in 1968. Sally Hawkins stars as the women's leader, Rosamund Pike plays the boss's repressed wife and Miranda Richardson is Labour MP Barbara Castle.\n\nHoskins remembers the day the strike happened.\n\n'I'd just started in theatre in my first job,' he says. 'I was in Stoke-on-Trent at the Victoria Theatre doing Romeo And Juliet, and living in digs. I remember reading on the fifth page of the newspaper a little article about women going on strike for equal pay and I thought, \"What's going on? This should front-page news. It's a liberty if women are not being paid the same money for doing the same job. They're ripping the women off - that's robbery.\" And let's face it, even though Barbara Castle made it law (in 1970) that they couldn't give them less, employers are still doing it.\n\n'Sally Hawkins is the best thing about the film. She plays this ordinary girl who becomes a Joan Of Arc character. It was fantastic being one of the only men in the movie. The extras were real girls from an old factory - they had been made redundant from their jobs so it was great that they could be part of the film. And they made such a fuss of me. They used to pinch my bum.'\n\nLike his character, Hoskins has always empathised strongly with women. A devoted family man, he has two children (Rosa and Jack) with Linda and two more (Alex and Sarah) with his first wife, Jane Livesey.\n\n'I'm not quite right if I'm not married,' said Bob. He sank into depression when his first marriage ended\n\n'I'm not quite right if I'm not married,' he says, adding that when his first marriage ended he sank into depression.\n\n'I had a nervous breakdown,' he says. 'Walking away from two kids is not easy. I went bananas. I moved back in with my mum and dad in Islington because I was so broke. My first wife cost me a lot of money, she put me into debt because I was paying both lawyers and the divorce was going on forever. I said to myself, \"Marriage is not for you, it's not your game, you're terrible at it.\" I decided I wasn't going to married again...'\n\nThen on July 29, 1981, when Prince Charles married Diana, Hoskins met Linda Banwell, a teacher, at a pub in Belsize Park.\n\n'On Royal Wedding Day they kept the pubs open till 12 o'clock. I walked in to the Load Of Hay on Haverstock Hill (now The Hill, a gastro pub) and there she was. I got into conversation with her.'\n\nIt was, says Hoskins, love at first sight. He pursued her relentlessly.\n\n'I was so broke because of the divorce. I was living in the back of a van. That night I parked the van outside Linda's house in Parkville Road - and never left. I said, \"You're not going to leave me out here are you?\" She didn't stand a chance,' he grins. 'She went off on a holiday to Greece and she said, \"Would you water my plants while I'm away?\" I did and when she came back I was still there, watering the plants.'\n\nHave there never been any temptations while away in Hollywood on film sets?\n\n'Nah. People say, \"Who's gonna know?\" but they do know and if Linda found out it would cause so much pain... and then again she might do it to me. So we can't have that.'\n\nNeedless to say there is no sexism in the Hoskins household.\n\n'It's more than equal. She does the business. I just act as a skivvy,' he jokes. 'She handles everything, the banks, the money.'\n\nThese days Hoskins and his family live in Muswell Hill - an affluent north London suburb. But apart from the success, not a lot has changed, he says.\n\n'It's funny really, because people don't actually see me as a celebrity - they think they know me. The other day I was in M&S getting the shopping and this old girl says to me, \"Bob, where's the tea?\" I find the Typhoo and PG Tips and say, \"Have some of that\", and she's off.\n\nBob in his latest film, Made In Dagenham - a Brit flick about the Ford car plant strikes in the sixties demanding equal pay for women\n\n'I get taken for a mug every time I go out. One Christmas I was in the butcher's and an old girl came in and says, \"Give us a lamb chop.\"' Hoskins lowers his voice to a whisper. 'I say to the butcher, \"Go on, do the business. Find some reason for giving her a turkey.\" So he says, \"'Ere you are love, you're the 100th customer here today, you've won a turkey.\" Then she says, \"What's the difference in cost between the lamb chop and the turkey?\" He says, \"25 quid.\" She says, \"You owe me 25 quid.\"' He bursts out laughing.\n\nThere are neither plans to retire nor any financial need to work.\n\n'I only do what I want to - there's a stack of scripts at home just sitting on the den floor and I walk in and kick 'em now and again.'\n\nHoskins has won dozens of awards, from Baftas to Golden Globes. The only thing missing is an Oscar. And like knighthoods, he takes them with a pinch of salt. In 1987, the year Paul Newman won for The Color Of Money but didn't attend the ceremony, Hoskins was nominated for Mona Lisa. His friend James Woods was also there, for his role in Salvador.\n\n'Jimmy gave me a glass of champagne and said, \"Here's to Paul Newman\". I said, \"What do you mean?\" And he said, \"Well he's gonna win the Oscar.\" All the other nominees are sitting there and he points to each one and says, \"Did he give an Oscar-winning performance?\" I said, \"Yes.\" \"Did he?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did I?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you?\" \"Yes.\" Then he says again, \"Here's to Paul Newman. He's the only one who isn't here tonight and the only one who didn't give an Oscar-winning performance.\"'\n\nWould you like an Oscar?\n\n'I suppose so.' He shrugs. 'I've got loads of awards, love, and they're all tucked away in a cupboard. Nah, they're not important.'\n\nHoskins is not an extravagant man, but he does make exceptions.\n\n'I spoiled the kids,' he admits. 'If you're living in a place in Finsbury Park with no bed, no room, and suddenly you've got money and you can send your kids to a good school and have nice holidays - of course you do it. Just listen to them, they speak perfectly!\n\n'What gives me most pleasure is seeing Linda enjoy the money. It's nice being able to buy her jewellery; but if I bought her 80 grand's worth she'd look at me as though I was mad and send it back. It's nice having two cars. I drive a Mercedes B Class, a tiny little car, and she drives a Mercedes A Class. And holidays are nice. We've just come back from Sicily, which was wonderful. We eat well, we go out to good restaurants but I'm not attracted by big cars or boats or private planes.'\n\nHe pauses.\n\n'When I became a film star I thought they're going to find me out soon... but they never did. I got on with it. I kept pedalling. But I never know I've \"made it\" - even now. Some mornings I wake up thinking, \"I'm getting short of dough\", and I say to Linda, \"I'm skint!\" And she says, \"What do you mean? Have you seen how much we've got in the bank?\" But as far as I'm concerned the only thing I know about money is the money in my back pocket.\"\n\nHoskins pats his pocket and walks out into the warm glow of the late afternoon sun. Best of British.\n\n'Made In Dagenham' is out on October 1"
