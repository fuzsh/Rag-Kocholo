        "text": "The role that got Hoskins his Academy Award nomination found him playing ex-con George, who slowly befriends the high-priced call girl (Cathy Tyson) he's been assigned to drive around and protect, eventually promising to help find the friend from her earlier days she fears is still on the street.\n\nThis is the movie that made Hoskins a famous face on both sides of the Atlantic. As hard-drinking private eye and reluctant hero Eddie Valiant, he held his own against a group of animated co-stars that includes the Toon of the title, voiced by Charles Fleischer.\n\nHoskins played the man who managed to win Cher's heart and convince her to settle down in this dramedy about a unconventional woman prone to moving to new towns with her daughters (played by Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci) after her love affairs go wrong.\n\nThis live-action adaptation of the the '80s Nintendo video game was basically the reason we didn't see another of its kind until the 2000s. It was a critical and financial disaster, but Hoskins' nailed Mario's Brooklyn accent and, more importantly, his mustache.\n\nHoskins only appeared in six seconds of this Spice Girls comedy that featured cameos from the U.K.'s finest like Elton John, Jennifer Saunders, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Bob Geldof, and Jonathan Ross. Though he didn't even have a speaking part, playing a disguise for Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) in a fictional film within the film called Spice Force Five, he did get to mouth \"Girl power.\"\n\nIn the 3D animated take on the Charles Dickens story, Hoskins voiced two characters: Mr. Fezziwig, the proprietor of a warehouse business for whom Scrooge apprenticed, and Old Joe, who buys Scrooge's belonging in a different version of Scrooge's sliding doors tale. The project reunited Hoskins with Robert Zemeckis, who penned and directed the reimagining and also directed Who Framed Roger Rabbit two decades earlier.\n\nJust a few months after this dark take on the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale — in which Hoskins played Muir, the blind elder dwarf with the power of premonition — hit theaters, the then 69-year-old actor, who'd been diagnosed with Parkinson's, announced he was retiring.\n\n\"Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time,\" a rep for Hoskins said in a statement at the time. \"He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career.\""
