        "text": "Much-loved British actor Bob Hoskins has retired from acting after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The actor's agent broke the news in a statement, saying: \"Bob Hoskins wishes to announce that he will be retiring from acting, following his diagnosis of Parkinson's disease last autumn.\n\n\"He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career. \"Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time.\"\n\nDuring his career, Bob made his mark on both sides of the Atlantic, and cultivated a cheeky Cockney persona. An Oscar nod came in 1987 for his turn as a petty criminal in Mona Lisa. The critical acclaim propelled the Suffolk-born son of a truck driver onto his first big lead role in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The 1988 film is considered a classic for its innovative mixture of animation and traditional film techniques.\n\nHe starred opposite some of Hollywood's most famous names, working with Jennifer Lopez in Maid in Manhattan, and Cher in the cult film Mermaids. Following success in the US, Bob won the hearts of British audiences as the 'BT Man', leading the phone company's iconic 'Itâ€™s Good to Talk' campaign in the mid-Nineties.\n\nMost recently, he starred in Snow White and the Huntsman, the film that hit headlines after its star Kristen Stewart had a \"momentary indiscretion\" with the man in the director's chair, married father-of-two Rupert Sanders. Following his diagnosis, family man Bob will now rely on the love and support of his second wife Linda, pictured with him below, and his four children."
