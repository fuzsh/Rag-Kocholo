        "text": "‘I’m not a politician - I’m a businessman with a sense of history. I’m also a Londoner, and today is a day of great historical significance for London. Our country’s not an island anymore - we’re a leading European state.’ - Bob Hoskins as Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday.\n\nIt wasn’t only Hoskins’ acting which made The Long Good Friday a classic. The film’s plot now seems uncannily prophetic\n\nThirty five years ago The Long Good Friday reinvented the British gangster film, and launched the film career of an emerging actor called Bob Hoskins. This week, it’s released in cinemas and on DVD and Blu-ray, in a new restoration.\n\nHoskins was born to play Harold Shand, an East End gangster who yearns to become a respectable property tycoon.\n\nHowever it wasn’t only Hoskins’ acting which made The Long Good Friday a classic. The film’s plot now seems uncannily prophetic. Shand plans to redevelop London’s derelict docklands, a storyline which foresaw the construction of Canary Wharf.\n\nHe dreams of transforming this urban wilderness into a high-rise yuppie paradise, but his plan falls apart when he tangles with the IRA...\n\nThe Long Good Friday anticipated the ruthless entrepreneurialism of the 1980s, when big business became trendy, and greed was good. Yet although it’s of its time, this gutsy thriller has hardly dated.\n\nBarrie Keeffe’s screenplay crackles with streetwise one-liners; Phil Méheux’s intense camerawork puts the viewer at the heart of every scene.\n\nDirector John Mackenzie brings the best out of his actors, and paints a powerful portrait of a metropolis where crime and politics co-exist.\n\nHoskins bestrides this film like a cockney colossus, but there are loads of other fine performances: Helen Mirren plays Shand’s posh girlfriend; Pierce Brosnan (in his first movie) plays an IRA hitman.\n\nYou’d never guess the total budget was under a million pounds.\n\nBob Hoskins died in 2014, and John Mackenzie died in 2011, but Barrie Keeffe and Phil Méheux are both very much alive, and on Friday, 19 June they’re meeting up at the British Film Institute, on London’s South Bank, to talk about The Long Good Friday at a special screening.\n\nRobbing an actor of his voice is perhaps the single worst thing one can do to him. When one takes away his voice, one takes away his heart and soul\n\nSir Alec Guinness\n\nLast week, I caught up with them in London to hear about their memories of the film.\n\nBarrie Keeffe was born in London’s East End, and started his career working on a local newspaper.‘This was just before the Krays’ empire came to an end, and quite a few of the things in the film are things I actually experienced as a journalist.’\n\nAs a young reporter, he was sent to hospital to interview a man who’d been nailed to the floor by gangsters. Keeffe used this detail in the film. He wrote the first draft a month before Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister. ‘I sat down to start writing on Good Friday. I finished it on Easter Monday.’\n\nWhen Mackenzie cast Hoskins, Keeffe knew he’d be perfect. ‘He was such a force of energy,’ says Keeffe. ‘He means every word he says.’\n\nToday The Long Good Friday is widely regarded as one of the best British movies ever made, but it very nearly vanished without a trace.\n\nMade for Lew Grade’s production company, ITC, it was earmarked for the big screen, but in the midst of the Troubles, a film about terrorism defeating capitalism (even crooked capitalism) was considered too controversial for cinema.\n\nITC decided to show it on TV, cut from 111 minutes to 83. ‘It would have been meaningless on television,’ says Keeffe. ‘It would have been wallpaper.’\n\nTo make matters even worse, ITC decided to have Hoskins overdubbed by an actor with a Brummie accent. Ironically, it was this bizarre decision which saved the film.\n\nHoskins’ contract stipulated that his voice could only be overdubbed with his permission. Hoskins refused to budge, and Britain’s greatest actors supported him.\n\n‘Robbing an actor of his voice is perhaps the single worst thing one can do to him,’ declared Sir Alec Guinness. ‘When one takes away his voice, one takes away his heart and soul.’"
