        "text": "Bob Hoskins has passed away at the age of 71 following a battle with pneumonia.\n\nThe star made his name with a number of high-profile roles in the likes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Hook and Mona Lisa.\n\nIn a statement following his death on Tuesday night, his family confirmed their tragic loss.\n\nHoskins' wife Linda and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack said: \"We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob.\n\n\"Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia.\n\n\"We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.\"\n\nIn honour of his life and wonderful career, we've gathered some of his best big screen moments as a tribute to the man himself.\n\nThe Long Good Friday\n\nOne of Bob Hoskins' breakthrough moments was his performance in The Long Good Friday opposite Helen Mirren.\n\nHe took on the role of London gangster Harold Shand in the 1980 film, which ranked 21st in the British Film Institute's list of top 100 British films of the 20th century.\n\nHis performance saw him nominated for a Best Actor BAFTA.\n\nHook\n\nAmongst such aluminaries as Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman, Hoskins' performance as the bumbling Mr Smee is a highlight of this Peter Pan adaptation.\n\nThe scene in which he tries to talk Captain Hook out of committing suicide is instantly memorable and stands out as a wonderful moment of his career.\n\nHe and Hoffman worked brilliantly together in this swashbuckling adventure which has more than stood the test of time.\n\nMona Lisa\n\nLike The Long Good Friday, Mona Lisa helped cement Hoskins' career early on and earned him a number of awards.\n\nThe neo-noir mystery drama saw him play ex-convict George, and he went on to win Golden Global, BAFTA and National Society of Film Critics awards for Best Actor.\n\nAlthough he missed out on an Oscar - which went to Paul Newman in The Colour of Money - it was a major moment in his career.\n\nMade In Dagenham\n\nOne of Hoskins' more recent roles, this movie dramatised the Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968 and showed that his talent was still undeniable.\n\nHe played Albert in the film, and his performance saw him nominated the Best Supporting Actor prize at the British Independent Film Awards.\n\nMermaids\n\nBob appeared as Lou Landsky opposite Cher in Mermaids, taking on the role of her character Rachel Flax's love interest.\n\nHe impressed as the local shop owner, an the film featured a stellar cast including Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci, the latter making her first big screen appearance.\n\nSnow White and the Huntsmen\n\nThis was the star's last role before retiring from acting as he took part in the dark retelling of the classic fairytale.\n\nHe took on the role of Muir, a blind dwarf with the power of premonition, with the Denver Post writing: \"Only Bob Hoskins as the blind seer Muir comes close to making us care.\"\n\nMrs Henderson Presents\n\nBack in 2005, he took on the role of Vivian Van Damm in the movie, based on the true story of London's Windmill Theatre.\n\nHe was nominated for the Golden Global Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit?\n\nUndoubtedly one of Bob's defining roles, the 1988 comedy blended live action and animation perfectly.\n\nThe film is a classic, and the late actor's performance as private investigator Eddie Valiant was a huge part of its success, also earning him a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nWho could forget his roles in BT's Good To Talk adverts?\n\nHe may have made his name on the big screen, but his appearances on the small screen are still a part of his great legacy."
