        "text": "Acclaimed British actor Hoskins passed away in hospital from pneumonia while surrounded by family and friends on Tuesday, April 29, a statement released by his agent Lindy King read.\n\nThe 71-year-old was described as “jolly” and “lovely” by members of the Ford sewing machinists who went on strike over unfair wages in 1968, and was praised for his portrayal of their deputy covenor and union rep Bernard Passingham.\n\nMembers of the group Sheila Douglass, Eileen Pullen, Gwen Davis and Vera Syme consulted on the film and attended the premiere, as well as appearing on a TV chat show alongside the Bafta-award winner to help promote the movie.\n\nIn 1968 women workers at the Dagenham factory went on strike after their pay was cut\n\nVera said: “I was really upset and shocked when I heard the news [of his death].”\n\nRecalling meeting him for the first time, the 84-year-old added: “He was very jolly. We really took to him, it felt as though we had known him for years. He was a lovely man.”\n\nHoskins received a best actor Oscar nomination for his role in 1986 mystery drama Mona Lisa after rising to fame as the lead in British gangster flick The Long Good Friday six years earlier.\n\nEileen, 83, said the filmstar’s mannerisms were an exact copy of their union rep, adding: “How Bernard acted, that’s how he acted.”\n\nYoungest of the group, Sheila, 77, said: “We thought he was brilliant” and recalled the family man telling her he “must get home to the missus” after their appearance on TV together.\n\nHoskins career spanned four decades and included roles in productions as diverse as Peter Pan sequel Hook, comedy caper Who Framed Roger Rabbit and BBC drama The Street, for which he won an award.\n\nHe retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nIn a statement released following his death, Hoskins’ wife, Linda, and children, Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack, said: “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob.”\n\nA musical version of Made In Dagenham is due to open in theatres later this year."
