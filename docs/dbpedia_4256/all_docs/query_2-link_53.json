Born on October 26, 1942, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England, Hoskins grew up in a working-class family. His mother was a cook from Poland, and his father worked as a lorry driver in London. Hoskins left school at the age of 15 and took on various odd jobs before discovering his passion for acting.\n\nAt the age of 26, Hoskins enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) to pursue his acting career. After completing his studies, he began his career in theater, performing in plays such as “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” In the early 1970s, he made his television debut and gained recognition for his performances in drama series such as “Play for Today” and “Thick as Thieves.”\n\nHoskins’ breakthrough came in 1980 with his role in the British crime film “The Long Good Friday.” His portrayal of Harold Shand, a London gangster trying to secure a redevelopment deal, received critical acclaim and established him as a notable actor. Hoskins continued to impress audiences with his performances in films like “Mona Lisa” (1986), for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He won several awards for his role as George, a chauffeur who becomes romantically involved with a high-end call girl.\n\nThroughout his career, Hoskins showcased his versatility by taking on a wide range of roles.
