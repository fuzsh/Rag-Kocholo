He left school aged 15 to work in a series of odd jobs while dreaming of getting into acting. He claimed that he got his big break by accident, after being mistakenly called for a theatre audition, but he proved a natural, and stage success soon lead to TV and small film parts.\n\nChannel 4 News looks back at some films that Bob Hoskins starred in:\n\nPennies From Heaven\n\nHis breakthrough role came in Dennis Potter’s 1978 series Pennies From Heaven in which he played the lovelorn sheet music salesman Arthur Parker.\n\nRoger Rabbit\n\nHoskins appeared in Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, for which he received a second Golden Globe nomination.\n\nThe Long Good Friday\n\nHis portrayal of doomed London gangster Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday made him a film star, and was one of his most popular roles.\n\nEnemy at the Gates\n\nHoskins played Nikita Khrushchev as a political commissar in the film Enemy at the Gates in 2001.\n\nMade in Dagenham"
