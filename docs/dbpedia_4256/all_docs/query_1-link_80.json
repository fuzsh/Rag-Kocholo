But his thoughts on Denzel Washington were particularly interesting to me:\n\nIf you had a bunch of us...I think a lot of people would say, pound for pound, Denzel is the best actor working in the business. Because he's one of the greatest stage actors in America. Like full stop, no question. Classical...Julius Ceasar, The Iceman Cometh. I mean this guy has done canonical, big classical theatre. Fences by August Wilson, which I would say him and Viola Davis in Fences was one of the greatest things I've ever seen on stage. I've never seen an audience weeping like that. The film is really good. On stage I think it's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen on stage, that duet.\n\nAnd he's a great character actor. Like that one he did recently about the guy....Tony Gilroy's movie, he's a lawyer (Roman J Israel Esq)...he'll play like Hurricane Carter...and then he's one of the biggest movie stars in the world. He really does it all. But very, very few people are like that. I think Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors ever, but he hasn't like....I mean who is one of the greatest stage actors in the country, a huge movie star and actually like one of the really great film character actors too? There just aren't many people like that.\n\nHis thoughts on Washington begin about 1:03:35, but the whole interview is quite interesting.\n\nPost by sirchuck23 on\n\nNorton was on the Bill Simmons podcast a few days ago to promote Motherless Brooklyn, and gave his thoughts on many things.

I actually like how he gives credit to Washington to being a great character actor when he needs to be. Roman J Israel is a good example of that. Hopefully they work together one day.\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nEdit: Oh and btw Denzel is so funny in Carbon Copy. A little seen early comedy. I think he should have done more comedy, but he probably never gets offered that.\n\nDenzel fired his agent after Heart Condition (an atrociously reviewed buddy/Ghost comedy with Bob Hoskins).\n\nTo be honest though, he's pretty solid at comedy, and hardly needs to prove it. Not Eddie Murphy, but he doesn't need to be. As you said, he was very funny in Carbon Copy.\n\nThe Preachers Wife has is one of those romantic comedies that get rinsed by TV schedulers every Christmas. It's a romantic comedy with Denzel and Whitney Houston, that most cinephiles would never go out if their way to watch, but it's had a pretty long shelf life, and most of the reviews compared his performance favorably to Cary Grant, who starred in the original version, and is pretty much the greatest romantic comedy lead ever. The site Den Of Geek voted The Preacher's Wife and Grant's version The Bishop's Wife, joint number 1, as the most rewatchable Christmas films ever.\n\nwww.denofgeek.com/us/movies/top-10-re-watchable-christmas-movies/39455/top-10-re-watchable-christmas-movies\n\nI get the feeling he never did more rom-coms after The Preacher's Wife, despite decent reviews and solid box office because he didn't find it especially challenging. How hard is it for someone like him to be charasmatic and amusing? He pretty much treated it as a box ticking exercise. He made a successful rom-com, and never felt the urge to make another one. But he really could have made a killing milking that charming rom-com persona if he wanted to.\n\nPost by therealcomicman117 on\n\nEdit: Oh and btw Denzel is so funny in Carbon Copy.

Outside of The Preacher's Wife, there's just Mississippi Masala (obviously not a comedy, but a good movie nonetheless), and that's it. Even in his action films when he does have a love interest, she's usually heavily secondary to the big images on the screen.\n\nHonestly I get what he's saying about romantic comedies. They're very formulaic in general, and don't require much in the way of acting outside of maybe good comedy chops. Still I think he would have been perfect for a sensual \"sexual romantic drama\", and we never really got that much if at all, especially in his prime.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nSpeaking of The Preacher's Wife, I'm honestly surprised that Denzel didn't do more romantic films, especially considering his status as a sex symbol in the 1990s.

Still I think he would have been perfect for a sensual \"sexual romantic drama\", and we never really got that much if at all, especially in his prime.\n\nThe real \"problem\" (for lack of a better word) for him in this regard is 2 or 3 or more of the actors he's sometimes lumped in with as \"best American of his generation (or in his age group)\" have triumphed in big comedies especially Hanks his main rival.......and Sean Penn has a lead Oscar nomination for a comedy.......Ralph Fiennes (a Brit) has a madcap lead comic triumph, Jeff Bridges has a beloved comic film etc.\n\nA few years back I thought he was going to pull a full De Niro and go all comedies - that was around the time of Two Guns. He might still .....\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nActually, Hanks' case was totally different. He started from comedy and he was a very successful comic actor (Splash, Sleepless in Seattle, an Oscar nod for Big) before going into more serious/dramatic movies (with Philadelphia), at which he excelled.\n\nThat's a GREAT point........although I'm not sure the where you start thing matters as much as the \"where you end up\" thing if you know what I mean :\n\nNorton was saying that Denzel is the best \"working\" actor now (as opposed to \"living\" or \"ever\") and then he laid out his criteria - film, stage, character work. But clearly \"comedy\" didn't mean a lot to him and yet it meant a lot to ray who brought it up here............that's why it's always so tough to rate actors, everyone has different criteria that they value.\n\nI'm still stunned that anybody thinks consistency matters for an actor but you can't tell people they're wrong for how they feel either, they have that right ..........that's part of the fun of it all\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nDenzel fired his agent after Heart Condition (an atrociously reviewed buddy/Ghost comedy with Bob Hoskins).\n\nTo be honest though, he's pretty solid at comedy, and hardly needs to prove it.

Still I think he would have been perfect for a sensual \"sexual romantic drama\", and we never really got that much if at all, especially in his prime.\n\nDenzel solidified his status as a sex symbol and romantic leading man with Mo Better Blues, long before Missisipi Massala and The Preacher's Wife . That was as classic a romantic leading man role as you could imagine. In Mo Better, he was a tortued Jazz player, torn between romancing two women. That movie put him over the edge in terms of really getting him a big female following. That's your sensual romantic drama.\n\nHe's literally done everything, that we sometimes forget things like Mo Better Blues were milestones in his career. I don\"t think he ever wanted to coast on the romantic leading man or rom-com thing, because once you get to heavily into that, people can start to perceive you as a beefcake that is skating by on his looks and charm. Among black actors who went that route, it happened to Morris Chestnut, who went from Boyz In The Hood, to endless African-American romantic dramas and comedies, and ended up being seen as this sort of lightweight actor adored by black women. Among white actors who went that route, Matthew McConaughey.....he ended up being percieved as a lightweight skating by on his looks and charm thanks to being overly associated with rom-coms, and needed an entire career resuscitation movement named after him to shed that tag. We've even discussed how Richard Gere has struggled to be taken seriously because he leaned very much into the \"I'm a romantic leading man, I make romantic movies, women love me\" thing. Denzel avoided that.\n\nDenzel did it perfectly. He has a few perfectly timed \"romantic\" parts early in his career (Mo Better, Missisipi Massala, Preachers Wife...I'd even count his Don Pedro in Much Ado About Nothing as partial fanservice to his female fanbase), but didn't fall into the trap of becoming romantic beefcake. Once he got that female fanbase, they weren't going anywhere, and he didn't need to constantly top it up with romantic films.\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nActually, Hanks' case was totally different. He started from comedy and he was a very successful comic actor (Splash, Sleepless in Seattle, an Oscar nod for Big) before going into more serious/dramatic movies (with Philadelphia), at which he excelled.\n\nHanks has about as much relevance to Denzel's stature, as Jack Lemmon did to Marlon Brando's. Which is none. It's a phony, imaginary, almost non-existant \"rivalry\" because they are so fundamentally different that the only thing they really seem to have in common is being popular actors that are American of a similar age. They can exist comfortablely in the same space, as neither threatens the other.\n\nIn this scenario, Denzel is Brando and Hanks is Lemmon. Denzel is the intense, dramatic method actor that other actors idolise. Hanks is the likable movie star adept at both comedy and drama that actors very much respect and like, but not in the way they (mostly) ever worshipped or wanted to be like Brando or Denzel. You do not get middle aged Actors actors like Edward Norton or Benico Del Toro talking about Hanks in idolatry tones like they do about Washington. To be honest, actors rarely seem to rhapsodise unprompted about Hanks, full stop.Hanks is an actor other actors admire, without neccesarily wanting to be like. Lemmon had a similar affliction\n\nI don\"t even think a third Oscar (which is possible for Hanks one day, at the clip he Oscarbaits) will change that for Hanks. He's too fundamentally \"soft\" as an actor to ever be perceived by other actors like a Denzel or Brando (and Lemmon was far better than Brando at comedy, but that had zero relevance to Brando's stature. And their Oscar track record is pretty similar).\n\nHanks and Lemmon will always be beloved movie stars mentioned in all-time favorite actor discussions. Some people will even say they prefer them to those intense method guys who generally dominate GOAT debates.But actors in drama school do not generally speaking, aspire to be these guys, and pretty much nothing can change that. Being seen as \"nice\" or unthreatening may make you a popular actor, but those are the drawbacks. Shia Lebeouf saying he didn't want to be compared to Hanks because he preferred \"darker\" actors sums up Hanks eternal problem. Shia thought being compared to Hanks mads him look soft.\n\nIn his generation of American Leading men, Sean Penn may have at one point been the guy who could have challenged Denzel's stature among their peers. Both from the intense method school, and at one point in his career, actors talked in worshipful tones about Penn, like they currently do for Denzel. But he's fallen off so badly, that as I have said, Denzel's main American competition these days is Marlon Brando's Ghost. Whatever Hanks does, actors will never rate him or talk about him like Washington. He's not an edgy enough performer.\n\nPost by Good God on\n\nSure thing Kingpin (that's your Awardswatch name, right). While I do that,You keep on campaigning against Eddie Murphy for poor lil Leo on the all the other awards boards\n\nIs saying Eddie Murphy is more likely to win the Comedy Globe than Leonardo DiCaprio part of my campaign against Murphy, too? Because I said that both on here and on there. And I believe that. I think Murphy is the favorite to win the Comedy Globe (unless Pitt goes Comedy Lead).\n\nHave to say, that's really rich coming from you though. You became the laughing stock of the Goldderby board with your ridiculous stanning and insane conspiracy theories on that forum. I can post the screenshots to prove it. Can you show me screenshots where I was stanning for DiCaprio and going on anti-Murphy rants the way you did against Casey Affleck? You can't, because I didn't. And I can post all the screenshots of your insane nonsense against Affleck. Because you did.\n\nI'm not a blind stanbot like you are. I respect myself too much to embarrass myself (like you embarrass yourself) in stupid attempts to help the awards chances of any actor. I say it like I see it. I think Dolemite and Murphy are Netflix's 4th priority as Oscar contenders, and I've provided evidence to support my contention. Where is your evidence against my contention? Let me guess, you have none"
