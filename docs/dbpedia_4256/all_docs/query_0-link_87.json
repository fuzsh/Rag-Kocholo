        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nI'll start with the handsome Kevin McCarthy, known best for the 1956 cult classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'\n\nYou may also recognize him as one of Blanche's boyfriends on the first season of \"The Golden Girls.\"\n\nHe was Oscar-nominated in 1951 for his great performance as Biff Loman in 'Death of a Salesman' - a role which he had performed to much acclaim on the London stage. The playwright, Arthur Miller, reportedly hated Fredric March as Willy Loman in the film adaptation, but considered McCarthy's work some of the best he had seen.\n\nMcCarthy preferred working on stage as opposed to in films - I highly recommend the filmed version of the play 'The Seagull,' performed in 1975 as part of Massachusetts's prestigious Williamstown Theatre Festival. His Trigorin is appropriately irresistible opposite Lee Grant's kittenish Arkadina and Blythe Danner's devastating Nina. It's on YouTube - you should see it!\n\nGolden Hollywood Trivia: Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift both considered him one of their best friends. Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote were convinced that McCarthy and Clift were lovers, but I personally don't think this is true.\n\nOkay, your turn to shine the spotlight on a wonderful, under-appreciated actor.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nGood thread - for me there's those distinctive character actor guys who when they would pop up in a film, at least for a certain era and make it better or more interesting just by their presence - Fred Ward, Warren Oates, J.T. Walsh, even Timothy Carey. You couldn't really put your finger on what they did or what was special about it - all I know is the way Carey plays a scene in The Killing with Sterling Hayden is weird lol - but their presence always make you sit up and invest more.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nGood thread - for me there's those distinctive character actor guys who when they would pop up in a film, at least for a certain era and make it better or more interesting just by their presence - Fred Ward, Warren Oates, J.T.

Love him so much.\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nI only found out like a month ago that Dwight Yoakam was a really big country music star. I honestly had no idea he was a legit major music star.\n\nThat kinda surprises me, but then, I grew up surrounded by country music.\n\nYoakam's my go-to answer for \"best musician-turned-actor.\"\n\nPost by rhodoraonline on\n\nIs Martin Starr underappreciated? I have absolutely fallen in love with him ever since watching Freaks and Geeks on netflix. Best comic character actor ever! Now I'm waiting for Silicon Valley to finally come to netflix so I can watch him in it :-)."
