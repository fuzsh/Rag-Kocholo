        "text": "Albert Finney\n\nAlbert Finney portrayed the politician opposite Vanessa Redgrave in 2002’s The Gathering Storm, an HBO- and BBC-produced TV movie centered on Churchill’s marriage with his wife Clementine. Finney scored both a Golden Globe and Emmy award for his performance.\n\nDavid Ryall\n\nIn the 2002 British comedy-drama Two Men Went to War, based on the true account of two army dental corps who invaded occupied France during World War II, David Ryall made a brief cameo as the prime minister.\n\nRod Taylor\n\nQuentin Tarantino's war film Inglourious Basterds, starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender, saw Rod Taylor appear in a cameo role as Churchill.\n\nBrendan Gleeson\n\nBrendan Gleeson starred as the British politician in the HBO and BBC TV movie Into the Storm, which garnered 12 nominations and two wins (including a nod for Gleeson for best actor in a miniseries or movie) at the 2009 Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nRichard Burton\n\nBurton played the British prime minister in the 1974 biopic The Gathering Storm, a joint production by BBC and NBC based on Churchill’s life before the start of World War II.\n\nTimothy Spall\n\nThough King George VI was the focus of the Oscar-nominated biopic The King’s Speech, the character of Churchill, played by Timothy Spall, made an appearance as one of the King’s supporters.\n\nRobert Hardy\n\nThe 1981 eight-episode miniseries Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years detailed the darker years of Churchill’s life following his removal from the Cabinet in the 1930s and starred Robert Hardy in the lead role.\n\nChristian Slater\n\nSlater comically took on the role of the political figure in 2004’s parody film Churchill: The Hollywood Years, a satire on Hollywood’s often-inaccurate portrayal of history.\n\nBob Hoskins\n\nHoskins played the role of Churchill in the 1994 TV movie World War II: When Lions Roared. The film traced the World War II relations between the three Allied leaders – Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt – and also featured Michael Caine and John Lithgow."
