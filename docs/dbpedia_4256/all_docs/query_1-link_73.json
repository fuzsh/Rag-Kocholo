        "text": "One of Britain’s best loved actors Bob Hoskins has passed away at the age of 71. The actor died on Tuesday after suffering from pneumonia.\n\nThe Golden Globe Award winner and Oscar nominated star of numerous films including Mona Lisa, The Long Good Friday, Mrs Henderson Presents, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Hook enjoyed a hugely successful career spanning five decades.\n\nWhile Hoskins appeared little on stage in his later career, the Suffolk-born actor began his career at the Unity Theatre in 1969. He returned to the stage in 1982 to appear in Guys And Dolls at the National Theatre and most recently appeared in the West End opposite Kristin Scott Thomas in 2005’s As You Desire Me at the Playhouse Theatre.\n\nHis illustrious career saw him act opposite screen legends including Judi Dench, Michael Caine, Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams, and work with numerous respected directors including Shane Meadows, Nora Ephron, Francis Coppola, Steven Spielberg and theatre’s Jonathan Kent. He retired from acting two years ago after he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nConfirming the actor’s death earlier today, his wife Linda and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack released a statement, saying: “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob. Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.”\n\nThe news led to an outpour of tributes on Twitter. Eddie Marsan cited Hopkins as an inspiration, saying: “I never thought it was possible to become an actor until I saw Pennies From Heaven as a kid. RIP Bob Hoskins, brilliant, inspirational, kind”, while Frances Barber captured the spirit of many of his former colleagues’ tributes, saying: “Have just heard the saddest news about Bob Hoskins. One of the most wonderful, kind, generous, thrilling actors I ever worked with. RIP Bob.”"
