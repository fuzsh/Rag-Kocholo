        "text": "Three times Bob Hoskins played an American better than an American\n\nBritish character actor Bob Hoskins died Wednesday at the age of 71. While he portrayed everyone from Nikita Khruschev in 2001's Enemy at the Gates to Winston Churchill in 1994's When Lions Roared, he had a knack for playing Americans better than most American actors could.\n\nHere are three roles where he Yanked it up to great effect -- and one role that got away:\n\nEddie Valiant, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' (1988)\n\nHoskins played a hard-boiled private investigator straight out of Central Casting in the beloved animated/live-action mashup:\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover, 'Nixon' (1995)\n\nHe held his own as the controversial head of the FBI opposite Oscar-nominated (and also Briton-playing-an-American) Anthony Hopkins:\n\nEddie Mannix, 'Hollywoodland' (2006)\n\nHoskins again put on an accent to play a sleazy 1950s movie-studio executive whose wife is having an affair with Superman actor George Reeves (Ben Affleck):\n\nAnd one that got away -- Al Capone, 'The Untouchables' (1987)"
