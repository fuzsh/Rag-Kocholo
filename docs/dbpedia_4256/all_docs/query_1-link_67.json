        "text": "LONDON — Bob Hoskins never lost his Cockney accent, even as he became a global star who charmed and alarmed audiences in a vast range of roles.\n\nShort and bald, with a face he once compared to \"a squashed cabbage,\" Hoskins was a remarkably versatile performer. As a London gangster in \"The Long Good Friday,\" he moved from bravura bluster to tragic understatement. In \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" he cavorted with a cast of animated characters, making technological trickery appear seamless and natural.\n\nA family statement released Wednesday said Hoskins had died in a hospital the night before after a bout of pneumonia. He was 71 and had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2012.\n\nHelen Mirren, who starred alongside Hoskins in \"The Long Good Friday,\" called him \"a great actor and an even greater man. Funny, loyal, instinctive, hard-working, with that inimitable energy that seemed like a spectacular firework rocket just as it takes off.\"\n\n\"I personally will miss him very much, London will miss one of her best and most loving sons, and Britain will miss a man to be proud of,\" Mirren said.\n\nThe 5-foot-6 Hoskins, who was built like a bullet, specialized in tough guys with a soft center, including the ex-con who chaperones Cathy Tyson's escort in Neil Jordan's 1986 film \"Mona Lisa.\" Hoskins was nominated for a best-actor Academy Award for the role.\n\nHis breakout Hollywood role was as a detective investigating cartoon crime in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" a tribute to hardboiled 1940s entertainment that was one of the first major movies to meld animation and live action. The 1988 Robert Zemeckis film was a huge global success that won three Oscars and helped revive animated filmmaking.\n\nBorn in 1942 in eastern England, Hoskins was raised in a working-class part of north London. He left school at 15, worked at odd jobs including circus fire-eater and claimed he got his break as an actor by accident — while watching a friend audition, he was handed a script and asked to read.\n\n\"I got the lead in the play,\" Hoskins told the BBC in 1988. \"I've never been out of work since.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
