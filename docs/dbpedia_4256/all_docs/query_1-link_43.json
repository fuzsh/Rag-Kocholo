        "text": "Bob Hoskins—the actor known for playing tough guys who deep down had hearts of gold—has died, his publicist said Wednesday. He was 71 years old and although best known for playing gruff detective Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, he had a long series of career highlights (and a few lowlights).\n\nHis list of \"bests\" include, of course, Roger Rabbit and his Oscar-nominated turn in Mona Lisa, the 1986 film where he played a taxi driver who forms a relationship with a call girl. He was also fantastic in Hook as the Captain's right-hand Smee, and as English gangster Harold in The Long Good Friday. His not-best, though, is similarly close to our heart: 1993's Super Mario Bros. was a tragically failed attempt to bring the Nintendo franchise to life (Hoskins himself referred to as the biggest disappointment of his career).\n\nNintendon'ts aside, Hoskins was one of our faves—here are some of his best performances.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1998)\n\nAny kid who grew up in the 1980s knows this film; it was inescapable. Although toons Roger and Jessica \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way\" Rabbit are the stars, it was Hoskins' hardscrabble toon-hating detective Eddie Valiant who brought it home. Any animated character can be made to sing and dance for laughs, but when Hoskins did it—acting against his illustrated co-stars—it was pure brilliance.\n\nHook (1991)\n\nSteven Spielberg's reimagining of the Peter Pan tale looks a little crazy in retrospect (Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell and Phil Collins as Inspector Good?). But tapping Hoskins to play Hook's sidekick Smee was genius. It's a movie crowded with insane performances, our man made the best of every minute he was on screen, right down to his exclamation that he \"had an apostrophe.\" (As well as his thwarting of Hook's suicide attempt—like we said, it looks a little crazy in retrospect.)\n\nMermaids (1990)\n\nOK, so this movie is mostly about Cher (her character is named Rachel here, but she's still Cher) and her two daughters played by Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci. But as one of the poor guys thrown into the mix, Hoskins is awesome.\n\nSpice World (1997)\n\nThis is just a reminder that the Spice Girls made a movie called Spice World and that Bob Hoskins was in it. As himself. You're welcome.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. (1993)\n\nOK, so it's a lowlight. It's the one movie Hoskins really regretted making and served as proof that successful videogame franchises don't necessarily make for successful movies. He went so far as to tell the Guardian, \"The worst thing I ever did? Super Mario Brothers. It was a fuckin' nightmare. The whole experience was a nightmare.\" Despite his disdain, he was beloved by his co-star John Leguizamo (the Luigi to his Mario). \"Dear #BobHoskins rest in peace!,\" Leguizamo tweeted today, \"never worked with a more gentle kind and talented actor!\"\n\nThe 49 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\nThe Long Game, Leo, and Godzilla Minus One are just a few of the movies you should watch on Netflix this month.\n\nHow World of Warcraft Devs Launched One of the Biggest Unions in Video Games\n\nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard created an environment that helped workers. Amid layoffs and worries about AI, their efforts could be an indicator of the future of the industry.\n\nThe 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nSunny, Constellation, and Presumed Innocent are among the best shows on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nThe 30 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nLove Lies Bleeding, Dune: Part Two, and Beetlejuice are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.\n\nVideo Game Performers Are Going on Strike Over AI\n\nThe union representing the voice and motion-capture actors who work in video games authorized the strike after talks with gaming companies stalled over the use of AI.\n\nA Chaotic History of Clickolding, the Year’s Most Disturbing Game\n\nStrange Scaffold’s hit couldn’t have been made without a little help from their friends—and a late night joke that took on a life of its own. Here’s the oral history of the summer’s clickiest game.\n\nFortnite Has a Political Violence Problem\n\nIn a report shared exclusively with WIRED, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism says it found more than a dozen user-generated games on Fortnite that featured antisemitism and political violence.\n\nHow Telegram Game Hamster Kombat Got 300 Million Users—and the Ire of Iran’s Military\n\nIn June, Iranian authorities claimed the crypto game was distracting voters during the presidential election. Last month, Telegram's CEO touted its potential to bring millions to blockchain. Its creators say they’re just getting started."
