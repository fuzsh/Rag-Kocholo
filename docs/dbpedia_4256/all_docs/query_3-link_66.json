        "text": "A couple of weeks ago film director Mike Hodges was in the news, complaining that his new film A Prayer for the Dying had been taken out of his hands and recut. Hodges considered the result a hodgepodge of his work, and he wanted his credit taken off the movie.\n\nWell, his name is still on the film, and Hodges’ lack of enthusiasm for the finished product is understandable; A Prayer for the Dying is pretty much a mess. However, there’s some evidence here that the movie would have had some serious problems, no matter how you cut it.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that the source novel, by Jack Higgins (I haven’t read it), might have had a few interesting ideas floating around in it, though even these seem reminiscent of the works of Graham Greene. Fundamentally built as a thriller, the story is also a character study of an IRA revolutionary (Mickey Rourke) who has had too much of killing, is politically disillusioned, and wants out altogether.\n\nAs the story begins, Rourke is a hunted man. He can escape Britain via a passport held by a gangster (Alan Bates), but the gangster demands that Rourke rub out a fellow mobster in exchange. Rourke figures, well, one hood more or less won’t make much difference. So he kills the guy, but the hit is witnessed by a priest (Bob Hoskins).\n\nMuch to the priest’s surprise, Rourke doesn’t immediately kill him, too. Instead, Rourke goes to confession and tells the very same priest of the killing – thus preventing the father, bound by the secrecy of the confessional, from saying anything to the police.\n\nIt’s not a bad idea – Alfred Hitchcock examined some of the same moral questions in I Confess. But A Prayer for the Dying lays on the sobriety and symbolism, and even has the nerve to drag in the priest’s niece (Sammi Davis), a blind girl who plays the church organ. That part gets a bit thick.\n\nHodges has an interesting way of looking at things, but he can’t combine the Christian redemption allegory and the political thriller into a satisfying whole. The finale, when the roof quite literally falls in, is either deliriously bold image-making or wretched symbolic excess, depending on your taste.\n\nRourke negotiates his Irish accent with better success than you might guess. Bates doesn’t have a lot to do – it’s a cameo role, which he plays mostly with his expensive overcoat – but he slips a few sly glances in.\n\nHoskins, who has made his name with his explosiveness (The Long Good Friday, Mona Lisa), seems to enjoy being cast against type here. He gives a measured performance, using his combustibility to prevent the priest from being at all saintly, which creates a priest more convincingly of the streets than anything Pat O’Brien ever conjured up.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, September 10, 1987\n\nMickey Rourke also disowned the finished film, which along with the other re-edits had a new score by Bill Conti added. Other folks in this: Liam Neeson, Alison Doody, Anthony Head. Today, I’m not sure I would write this with confidence that the reader would know who the hell Pat O’Brien was.\n\nWith the Academy Award nominations coming up Wednesday, film distributors are jockeying their releases to get optimum tie-in publicity. That’s why Ironweed, with its presumably obligatory nominations for Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, is opening this weekend; that’s why The Whales of August is here. Small or difficult or serious movies open nationally now, hoping to get a boost from the Oscar picks.\n\nWhich brings us to The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne, and Maggie Smith. Maggie Smith epitomizes what the Academy loves about acting: She’s cultured, she’s classy, she’s English. Of course, she’s also a gifted actress, which helps, but that’s not the only criterion for winning an Oscar. Whatever Smith has, it has won her two statuettes (Best Actress for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, 1969; Best Supporting Actress for California Suite, 1977) and three other nominations.\n\nThe Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne is Maggie Smith’s latest bid, and it may well be recognized by the Academy; it’s a meaty role in an eminently Anglo story. Judith Hearne is another of Smith’s spinsters, a bright, disappointed woman who gives music lessons as a means of surviving. There’s a yearning within her that isn’t satisfied, however. Clue to her character: a mother complaining that her child isn’t learning enough because Judith plays too much during the lesson.\n\nThe film, adapted from the novel by Brian Moore, picks up Judith’s character just as she moves into a new rooming house in Dublin in the mid-1950s. The landlady (Marie Kean) is something of a shrike, whose son (the exceedingly perverse Ian McNeice) is a grotesque, lazy poet. The main attraction in the household in the landlady’s brother, James (Bob Hoskins).\n\nHe’s just returned to Ireland after 30 years in New York City. To Judith, he carries all the allure of someone who’s been somewhere and done things, and she’s rapt at his tales of America.\n\nTheir quasi-courtship is the center of the film, and Smith and Hoskins are a lovely match. Smith’s leanness and lined face contract nicely with Hoskins’ burly energy. James is a hustler, and most of his interest in Judith lies in his mistaken belief that she has money – money that might be invested in his going scheme, a fast-food place where Dubliners can buy American food.\n\nThe tentative and eventually sad relationship has possibilities that aren’t fully served by Jack Clayton’s direction. Clayton surfaces every few years to bring his literary approach to bear; his recent films include the extremely disappointing adaptations of The Great Gatsby and Something Wicked This Way Comes.\n\nClayton gives Judith Hearne a tasteful surface, but he can’t reach the source of Judith’s loneliness. The film’s central tandem, while fine, deserve better.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, February 11, 1988\n\nIt did not bag any Oscar nominations that year, despite my wariness. A marvelous cast in place, and the final performance by Marie Kean, who, by the way, had a beefy batting average; she appeared in fewer than 20 big-screen films, but they included Barry Lyndon (she’s Barry’s mum), The Dead, Ryan’s Daughter, Neil Jordan’s Angel, and Cul-de-Sac.\n\nBob Hoskins is the burly, beetle-browed English actor who was Oscar-nominated for Mona Lisa and performed heroically as the detective in a world of Toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Imagine this Cockney-accented, sawed-off actor as a director. Not an easy thing. Now imagine the last sort of movie you might expect him to make. That movie might well look like The Raggedy Rawney.\n\nNevertheless, The Raggedy Rawney is exactly the movie that Hoskins has made – as director, co-writer, and supporting actor. It’s an odd but beguiling story, a fairy tale really, which Hoskins described as a yarn that he remembers hearing from his elders while still a boy.\n\nIt’s the story of a young soldier (Dexter Fletcher) who deserts his unit in the face of enemy fire. He joins a group of traveling Gypsies, but he has disguised himself. Because deserters are liable to be shot (or worse), he assumes a woman’s dress and makeup.\n\nThe leader of the Gypsies (Hoskins) considers this boy a Rawney – a sprite who is “magic mad” and bound to change the fortunes of the troupe. But Hoskins’ daughter (Zoe Nathenson) knows the Rawney’s true nature, and she falls in love with him.\n\nThe film isn’t rooted in any particular time and place. At first the era resembles World War I, yet the actors are all English and they travel across a war-torn countryside that could not be England (filmed in Czechoslovakia). It becomes clear that The Raggedy Rawney is a true fairy tale, not set in any realistic time. It’s a parable about war and human nature, meant to be taken as such.\n\nHoskins, as director, finds some appropriately dreamlike images for his tale: the Gypsies singing as they march through a wheat field; the Rawney lying in a riverbed trying to cool himself after glimpsing his beloved naked; the moonlight on the water that has just swallowed one of the characters. These are nice moments.\n\nBut Hoskins isn’t quite director enough to make the film sing in the way a real stylist would. This subject matter needs a true dream-weaver; John Boorman comes to mind. The film doesn’t quite catch the magic to which it aspires. Interesting diversion, though.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, February 16, 1990\n\nAnother not-great review, but maybe a movie worth re-considering. Fletcher’s acting career, which began in childhood, has continued, but lately he’s gotten known for directing, including Rocketman and an uncredited rescue of Bohemian Rhapsody. George Harrison’s Handmade Films was one of the producers.\n\nA few years ago, Robert Evans, the producer of films such as The Godfather and Chinatown, needed a script rewrite for a project about new York’s famous Cotton Club, a place where white audiences paid top dollar to see black entertainment during the height of the Jazz Age.\n\nEvans had worked with larger-than-life director Francis Coppola on The Godfather, and he called Coppola to get some suggestions for a good script doctor. Coppola, ever alert (and coming off a string of commercial disasters), quickly suggested himself. Thus commenced a series of events that probably made Evans wish he’d never heard of Coppola or the Cotton Club.\n\nBefore long, Coppola had thrown out the original screenplay (the film’s “story” credit goes to Mario Puzo) and written a completely new script with Pulitzer Prize-winner William Kennedy. Then Coppola assumed the mantle of director, and the production of the film itself was beset by rising costs and constant script rewrites.\n\nAnd somewhere in the midst of this Robert Evans went bye-bye. The lawsuits are now flying, but it’s hard to imagine they will have any effect on what is already an incredibly expensive movie (something between $40 and $50 million, at last count).\n\nCoppola seems to be attracted by this kind of guerrilla moviemaking, but whether or not it agrees with him is another matter. The films he produced while he played at being the mogul of his own hectic studio were almost wholly uninvolving.\n\nWith The Cotton Club, he’s gotten himself interesting again. This film, which whips up a blend of gangsterism and musical comedy, clips along at a confident pace and has enough flavorful characters to fill a speakeasy.\n\nRichard Gere plays a cornet player (and Gere plays his own horn solos, by golly) whose trajectory through the Jazz Age—in the film, from the late ’20s through the early ’30s—places him in close contact with such figures as gangster Dutch Schultz (rivetingly played by unctuous James Remar), the Dutchman’s moll (Diane Lane), and the men who run the Cotton Club (Bob The Long Goodbye Hoskins and Fred “The Munsters” Gwynne, who make a great comedy team).\n\nGere’s brother (Nicolas Cage, Coppola’s cousin) is a hothead swept into the violent world around the Cotton Club, with bloody results. This story of the brothers is paralleled by a pair of dancing brothers (Gregory and Maurice Hines) who work their way up through the Cotton Club to different levels of stardom.\n\nThe film is obviously chock-full; unfortunately, as enjoyable as much of this is, Coppola has a tendency to rush past the building blocks of characterization. He has atmosphere (kudos to designer Richard Sylbert) and rat-a-tat action down pat, but once the smoke clears, I was left with the nagging feeling that the sound and fury didn’t amount to too much.\n\nThe scope of the film calls for the three-hour Godfather sprawl, and Cotton Club clocks in at barely over two. Characters meet, split, and kiss and make up with not much validation for their behavior. Coppola asks you to take a lot for granted.\n\nI wish the extra hour might have had more song-and-dance in it, too; although the film is full of terrific music, few numbers are presented in their entirety (Coppola enjoys cutting routines in pieces rather than letting them develop on their own). Still, Lonette McKee’s “Ill Wind” is a stand-out, and the brothers Hines tread the boards with grace.\n\nCoppola likes to describe himself as a ringmaster/magician of chaos. He may not quite prove that the hand is quicker than the eye in The Cotton Club, but at least he keeps all three rings of the circus busy at once.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, December 15, 1984\n\nAs anybody who’s ever seen this movie knows, you can forget about Gere and Lane: Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne are where the action is.\n\nWhatever else one might say about it, Who Framed Roger Rabbit unquestionably represents one of the most remarkable technical achievements to come out of Hollywood in the last decade. This movie is an ambitious blend of live-action and animation, brought together in a seamless, inventive, and sometimes exhilarating combination.\n\nIt’s the brainchild of Robert Zemeckis, the director of Back to the Future and Romancing the Stone. Having accrued some clout with those consecutive hits, Zemeckis was able to undertake this expensive production (the budget, rumored to be in the $50 million range, was bankrolled by Touchstone pictures—Disney, that is—and Steven Spielberg’s Amblin).\n\nRoger Rabbit was so expensive because of the high cost of animation and the elaboratness of Zemeckis’s design. This movie takes the cartoon/live-action interplay of something like Disney’s Song of the South and whips it up into a silly symphony.\n\nIn the late-’40s world of the film, flesh-and-blood people share space with “toons,” the animated character stars of the movies. One toon, Roger Rabbit (voice by Charles Fleischer) is framed for a murder, and he must go to a hard-boiled private eye (Bob Hoskins) to help clear his name. Prominent in the investigation is a sinister judge (Christopher Lloyd) who wants to rid the world of toons by dipping them in a nasty green acid.\n\nThe plot is an excuse for the spectacular visual effects, some movie in-jokes, and a gallery of animated characters. There are cameos by most of the great cartoon figures, including Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Dumbo, Tweety Bird, and Betty Boop.\n\nAside from the excitable and elastic Roger Rabbit, the most arresting newcomer is Roger’s wife, Jessica, a sultry, vixenish bombshell who purrs, “I’m not bad. I’m just drawn that way.” (Her voice, uncredited, is unmistakably that of Kathleen Turner at her most provocative.)\n\nZemeckis doesn’t let anything sit still for a single minute. His camera is continually swooping and panning, and he’s constantly staging tussles and clinches between his real and unreal characters, all of which must’ve added to the astonishing difficulty of painstakingly drawing in the animation. (Hoskins and company, needless to say, made their live-action movie first, which means that the actors were mugging and exchanging dialogue with thin air.)\n\nThe affectionate in-jokes poke fun at cartoon conventions such as the omnipresence of falling safes and flattening steamrollers. One of the funniest moments comes during a piano duet—no, make that duel—between Donald Duck and Daffy Duck. After a dose of Donald’s bellicose quacking, Daffy turns to the crowd and asks a question that has been on the minds of cartoon lovers for years: “Does anybody understand what this duck is saying?”\n\nZemeckis enjoys rubbing our faces in the amazing effects. Which is typical of him; I’ve always found his movies rather witless, even when they were enjoyable. If it were an ordinary movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit would be none too interesting. But then, as it demonstrates at almost every moment during its running time, this is no ordinary movie.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, June 1988\n\nThe absence of the question mark in the title was an early example of puctuaphobia that would creep into films. I never loved WFRR, but have grown to like Zemeckis more since, especially Cast Away and Beowulf."
