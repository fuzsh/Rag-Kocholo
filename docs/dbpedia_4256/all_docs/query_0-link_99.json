        "text": "IGN recently attended a Los Angeles press conference with the cast and director of Focus Features' Hollywoodland, which stars Oscar winner Ben Affleck as the former Adventures of Superman TV star George Reeves.\n\nHollywoodland explores Reeves' life, acting career and curious death (which was officially ruled a suicide), and serves as a cautionary tale about the hunger for showbiz success and the downside of celebrity.\n\nHere's what co-stars Adrien Brody, Diane Lane, Bob Hoskins and Robin Tunney, as well as director Allen Coulter, had to say about the film:\n\nQ: Diane, you're playing a real person. Can you talk about Toni Mannix and why you wanted to play her?\n\nDIANE LANE: Thank you. Well, I always had a thing for George [Reeves]. I grew up and he was the definition of Superman for me and I bought it hook, line and sinker in the sense of that's all he was. I never looked beyond the curtain or considered anything about actors versus the characters I knew them to be as a child. So there was no black cloud over him in terms of the lore that the generation before me knew about. It was still on morning television when I grew up. It's interesting because there are so many layers to the story of George and I was very happy to portray some version of love in his life, because I was a fan.\n\nQ: But Toni Mannix, what kind of woman is she?\n\nLANE: Well, it's interesting, because I was sitting next to Dominick Dunne very recently at a dinner and he knew Toni and I so wish I had spoken with him prior to filming. Everybody has so much to tell me now. I do feel a burden of responsibility to honor her as closely as I was told and could glean from things I'd read. I appreciated her vulnerability and how it came out all wrong and I just thought everybody in the movie was a truly interesting character in their own merit, so it's nice to be a thread in a very interesting tapestry.\n\nQ: This movie is about your life in Hollywood not really going the way you planned. Could you talk about having those moments in your own Hollywood life?\n\nLANE: I would say that the whole myth of the word 'plan' in your question relies on that little man behind the curtain in Oz, because there is no plan unless you're somebody who I... people I can't name. It's such a crapshoot. If they knew what made hits they'd make more of them. That's my bumper sticker on the whole industry. So I don't think you can live for that and I think the more you get caught up in that, whether you're a film star from the '50s who regrets that he was ever on television and the pop psychology of what it is to be a victim of the media and all of this that the film deals with is relevant today as it was then and it is a case study of what makes people happy and the myth of happiness itself.\n\nADRIEN BRODY: Well, I think they've so eloquently described this on a universal level. I think for me, my character [private detective Louis Simo] is obviously part of Hollywood, but not within the industry that we're all in. The advantage of that is that it illustrates that it is not just something that people within this industry face. I think it's a common thread. Most people are under the impression that if they only had more of something, that would fulfill them and it's usually not the case and you don't know that until you reach that goal. I'm fortunate, personally, to know kind of both. I mean that sincerely. I know what it's like to be a struggling actor. I know what it's like to be really successful and have a level of fame and the advantages of that and the pitfalls that come with that. In knowing both sides, I feel like I need less now. I need less. I need less for myself. It's nothing to do with my career or other people's perceptions. I have a better understanding of what I need and for that I'm really grateful for it, because I struggle less with certain things that I really thought would make me happier. I think within the story, Simo's life paralleled George's in the sense that he craved respect and money and success and he looked for a bigger picture, rather than solving the smaller problems within his life that would have helped make him a happier human being. So that's what was fascinating to me. It shows that what may appear glamorous is rarely as glamorous as it appears.\n\nBOB HOSKINS: Well, this is all completely new to me. Acting's my job. It's what I do for a living. The script turns up, I like it, I do it. If it doesn't turn up, sometimes I'm really great.\n\nROBIN TUNNEY: Who wants to see a historical movie that's a period piece unless there's some relevance in your life today? And I think that's why the film works, because everybody in America, they want the SUV and their wife should have longer legs or bigger breasts and everybody faces that day-to-day and I think that's why the film works now, because it's not just about an actor whose career wasn't enough. It's something I think we can all find in our own lives. I've been in bad movies. This is one of the only good ones I've actually ever been in. But it doesn't define who you are and I think that's what makes you happy as a person, that you go, 'OK. This is what I do. And it can't define who I am.' And saying, 'OK. This is my job and I go home and I love my wife and I love my kids' and have that be enough. I mean, that's sort of Simo's fatal flaw is that he's obsessed with making something of himself and can't look at his wife and say 'That's a beautiful woman.' And his son and his tiny house isn't enough. So I think it's the American Dream. We've read a thousand novels about it and it's the story of the tragic American Dream.\n\nQ: In your research and in your opinion, what do you think happened to George Reeves?\n\nBRODY: I've been asked this and I'm reluctant to share my personal feelings about it because somehow…I don't know the answer. The evidence shows that there might have been foul play but it was documented as a suicide. I chose to, Alan and I made a conscious decision to limit my actual research of the events beyond the scope of what Simo would know when we were filming because why play against something if you don't know and actors that you don't know so it just made sense. It was a real luxury. So I'm not sure actually and I would hate for my opinion to resonate as truth to someone because I don't know the answer.\n\nQ: How do you think this will affect either in terms of people more curious of people seeing this film now or not?\n\nALLEN COULTER: I mean, it's certainly in the air now. Apparently, there were some pseudo-documentaries on television about George Reeves and about people who played Superman in the past. I think it never hurts to have interest in that subject out and about. It was certainly not anything we planned or knew about because we didn't know when we were going to begin, much less when they were. And we didn't know when we were going to finish and they certainly didn't know when they were going to finish. So it's just a fortuitous thing, we hope, that happened and beyond that, I would say, we don't know what it will mean.\n\nQ: This is a period piece and over your character you've done period pieces including some in my home state, Oklahoma. Can you address the joys and challenges of doing these kind of films and also, Allen, if you could address that from a director's standpoint?\n\nLANE: Wow, it's always refreshing to step into another time. I've often loved Westerns because it was so interesting to experience the oppression of being in a corset, you know, just to appreciate being able to complain about high heels and tight jeans when you're done with your days work. There's always something to complain about, there's just different reference once you see what the limitations of the time you're portraying and the freedoms of that time because it cuts both ways. I hope I've answered your question not too generally.\n\nCOULTER: As far as the opportunity to work on a period film, we tried to take an approach that we hoped would lend some originality to the film. There have been some great films that take place in Hollywood in that period, not the least of which the ones we know about Chinatown kind of the mother ship and L.A. Confidential, another beautiful film. And so from the very beginning, I was not interested in getting on the playground with those guys because they were just consummate in what they did. One of the things that we did in the art direction and the emphasis for me was to try and make 1959, the period which the film actually takes place and world that Louis Simo lives starting June 16, 1959, make that the modern world. And it was my opinion, that indeed that was the beginning of world that we live in now in many ways. The old studio system was starting to fade away, television was becoming preeminent. The way people dressed was the world of sort of a formal, reserved, maybe you could even use the word dignified, in appearances and proprietary of a certain kind. I'm speaking superficially, not what went on behind closed doors, was fading away and the world that we live in now, the world of casual dressing and everything from posture to all kinds of things, was coming to the foreground and we tried to make that point.\n\nFor example, letting Louis Simo be one of the first guys without a suit. There's a comment on that and he ends up wearing one in the end. But the fact is that we visually gave a look to the world of 1959 that emphasized its modernity and at the same time, when we went back in time to George Reeves world, we tried to make that look like an earlier era. It wasn't just the clothes; it was the soundtrack. We always heard recorded music in Simo's side of the equation and always live music on George's side. Simo's side is much, much noisier. We hear the ubiquity of noise whether it's a record player playing all the time, someone shouting in the next room, dogs barking…and in the world of George Reeves, it's much quieter, you hear a morning dove, only live music with the exception of when Leonora puts a record on. But she also belongs to the new world that he's reluctantly trying to join or that he's being dragged into kicking and screaming really. So we did all kinds of things in terms of the art direction to make a point that Louis Simo lives in the modern world, the first wave. He sits in his crappy little apartment with his feet up on the coffee table; George would never do that. George wears suits and dresses in a certain way. All of you in that world would be in some form of a suit.\n\nLANE: And every man had a hat.\n\nCOULTER: And every man would have a hat unless he's of a certain generation. We had Louis Simo and some of his contemporaries not wearing a hat to make a point that that world is also fading away. We're in a hatless world and a suitless world. So we did all kinds of things to address what you asked which is to make clear that the world is changing and we really did try to make it like we shot it in 1959. We tried to be as perfect in the art direction as we could and then we ignored it.\n\nQ: Following on this theme of a changing world, I was fascinated by the power of MGM's Howard Strickling because he was just the supreme fixer in this case. How do you think he would have been in today's climate.\n\nCOULTER: He'd have had a lot more work. The studios are not in control of the town or of the news media as they were as they were at that time. It would have been very difficult. As I understand it, the Chief of Police at MGM was the Chief of Police in Culver City in the '30s and '40s. That's a very big difference there in terms of what kinds of information gets out. Eddie Mannix read the private telegrams of some of the actors under his sway - he'd take a wad of telegrams home at night and read them to know, who's sleeping with whom and where they were going and so on. They talked to actors who they should marry. There was a very different sense of control, as you know. In this world today, JFK would not have an easy time of it with his various and sundry dalliances if indeed those were true. … it's just a different world. There is not the governor on the media and there's not any controlling system. I mean, this town was run by the studios and MGM was the most powerful, and therefore, really ran it. People like Eddie Mannix and Howard Strickling, who I was sad to hear had a stammer of which we didn't know or we would have done it - I just learned that today. … But anyway, I think there would be a massive difficulty having the kind of control as we know from daily life, that they could exercise at that time. And I think, too, that control was that everybody had to be a participant in that control. The media had to agree, OK, we won't tell. There was a certain sense that you don't say those things or write about those things.\n\nQ: The film as far as period went the audience was primarily interested in characters and not so much the actors' personal lives, whereas today it seems the opposite. Has that made your jobs harder?\n\nBRODY: I think it differs for the individual. One doesn't have anything to do with the other. There is obviously a fascination in people's private life, but some people are actually fascinated about films and about the work that an actor does, and about the transformation that individual makes, and that's what my motivation has been to be an actor, and continues to be my motivation and inspiration. I think it's just part of life, and maybe more so today, but it's just a part of life and we all have experienced it on different levels, but they are two separate things. I love the opportunity to be here and discuss my work and hear thoughts about the project and discuss things that I may have overlooked, or details that I worked on that someone caught, and the process and all of that. That to me is an interesting facet and part of my occupation. The rest of it just comes with it. I think it just is.\n\nHOSKINS: People don't seem to see me as a celebrity, they all think they know me, and I certainly think I know them. I had a guy come up to me and say, 'Hey, Bob, you've got to talk to my Maureen, she's out of order, she's doing this, she's doing that,' and suddenly the guy realized that he'd never met me before, he got really embarrassed. By this time I wanted to go around and give this girl a talking to. I don't know, people don't seem that interested in my private life, they just think they know me.\n\nBRODY: But that may have something to do with it, what he's saying. It may have something to do with it, it's not just an obsession with people's private lives, it's this feeling that if you accomplish what you're setting out to do, you're expressing an intimacy and intimate moments and a vulnerability that you wouldn't share with a stranger, but it is something that you're called to do and you have to do, and you have to do it sincerely or else why should I expect you to believe that moment? And it's often very difficult and very revealing about the individual, and even if it is a character there is a sense that you know the person who you saw experiencing those emotions, and then when you encounter them in real life you feel that you know them intimately sometimes.\n\nQ: Bob, this isn't your first time working with Diane Lane, what was your perception of her when you worked together and whether having her to play your wife was one of the appealing prospects of this script.\n\nHOSKINS: Yeah, I did actually. When I first saw her in The Cotton Club, wow, this kid's amazing. And when they told me she was 18 I couldn't believe it. This kid's brilliant. Anyway, when I read this script what attracted me to play the part was he was this ruthless, pragmatic, businessman who has depths of feelings, could adore his wife way beyond his own ego, and having Diane made it a lot easier.\n\nQ: Diane, you age yourself in this movie for Toni, what was that experience like and I just read in Vanity Fair that she's being compared to Norma Desmond.\n\nLANE: I have the sharp intake of air over here. Nothing shocks me. I think it was a wonderful exhale to just embrace the fact that the alternative to aging is much worse, and frankly having had a mother and watching her gracefully have a currency of life that was more meaningful than her youth, the vulnerability of a woman of years is a very interesting commodity to work with on film versus our almost callowness of youth that is assigned to men, but I think women possess it as well. It's just something that's easy to come by, hard to lose. And certainly Toni Mannix, that's a very important element of their relationship, that she had with George, which was her vulnerability of being the older women, that whole element, which today you can be 18 months older and it means a great deal evidently. So I'm just saying, again it's about 1950's versus 2006. I think it meant even more then.\n\nQ: What about the comparison to Norma Desmond?\n\nLANE: No comment. I didn't write it, these things have a life of their own without me helping them\n\nQ: How much research were you able to do on Eddie Mannix, and as an actor you must have played your intention, do you feel he killed George Reeves?\n\nHOSKINS: I don't think he had to. George Reeves, whether he shot himself or not, killed himself. He destroyed himself.\n\nQ: And the research?\n\nHOSKINS: What was quite interesting was the script was very clear of who he was and what he was; his main objective was making movies and loving his wife. That was his life. And I didn't want to come in with any great structure I'd created, walk into (Coulter's) production, because I don't know what he's going to do, I don't know what anybody is going to do, I'm just coming in to fit in. And so I didn't do a lot of research at all, in fact I didn't do any.\n\nBRODY: Because he's brilliant. I sat there talking to him on the first day, and the first scene that we shot together was in the poolroom in his office, and I had just met Bob and we were talking as we are now, and I thought I was hot shit, I'd been working and I'd gotten everything down (filming) for a few weeks or whatever, and then Allen called Action and Bob transformed in front of my eyes, and it scared the shit out of me. It scared the shit out of me on a number of levels, I love it when I'm working with someone that inspires me and is really great. There was this immediate transformation to this breathing, I grew up in New York and he sounded like somebody from Jersey, intimidating and all of that, it was fascinating, so I don't think he needed to - whatever he did, maybe he's being modest, maybe he did work very hard, but he turned it right on and then turned it right off and said, 'Alright love, see you later. I'm off. Give me a crumpet.'\n\nCOULTER: I will say a little footnote on that too is that at one point I said to Bob that Eddie had had something like five heart attacks, one of the things that we slipped into his office in the scene with Howard Strickling is, if you look carefully you'll see on his desk a bunch of medicine bottles, and so I mentioned it to Bob, and I remember that you were fascinated by it, and when he came back after lunch he had developed a wheeze, I don't know how he did it. And after that every time you listen to him you hear this little whistling breath. It was fantastic, although he said I tried to kill him by making him smoke a lot of cigarettes.\n\nHollywoodland opens this Friday."
