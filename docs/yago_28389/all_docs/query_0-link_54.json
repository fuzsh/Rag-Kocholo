        "text": "Wikipedia\n\nArticles English: Anne of Kiev\n\nPrincess Anne of Kiev\n\nQueen of France\n\nAKA: Anna Yaroslavna\n\nAKA: Princess Anne of Rus\n\nAnne of Kiev was born circa 1024 to Yaroslav I Vladimirovich of Kiev (c978-1054) and Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden (1001-1050) and died 1075 of unspecified causes. She married Henry I of France (1008-1060) 19 May 1051 JL in Reims, France. She married Raoul IV de Vexin (?-1074) 1061 JL .\n\nBiography\n\nPrincess Anne of Kiev (also known as Anna Yaroslavna or Anne of Rus) was a prominent figure in medieval Europe during the 11th century. She was born in Kiev, the capital of the Kievan Rus' (present-day Ukraine), around 1024 AD, and was the daughter of Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise and Ingegerd of Sweden.\n\nIn 1049, Anne was married to King Henry I of France (1008-1060), which was a significant political alliance between the Kievan Rus' and France. Anne was known for her beauty, intelligence, and her strong character, which made her an important figure in the French court.\n\nAnne's marriage to Henry I was initially difficult due to the language barrier and cultural differences, but she soon became popular among the French people for her charitable works and her patronage of the arts. She also played a significant role in the education of her children, including her son, King Philip I of France.\n\nAnne was known for her strong influence on her husband, who often consulted her on political matters. She was also involved in diplomatic efforts between France and the Holy Roman Empire, which helped to maintain peace between the two powers.\n\nAnne died in 1075 and was buried in the Basilica of St. Denis in Paris. She is remembered as an important figure in medieval history, both for her political achievements and her influence on French culture.\n\nEngagement\n\nThe negotiations for Anne's marriage to the 18-years-older King Henry took place in the late 1040s, after the death of Henry's first wife, Matilda of Frisia, and their only child. Due to the pressing need for an heir, and the Church's growing disapproval of consanguineous marriages, it became necessary for Henry to seek an unrelated bride.[1][2] The Kievan Rus' was not unknown to the French. Yaroslav had married several of his children to Western rulers in an attempt to avoid the influence of the Byzantine Empire.[1]\n\nIn the autumn of 1049 or the spring of 1050, Henry sent Bishop Gauthier of Meaux, Goscelin of Chauny, and other unnamed advisors to Yaroslav's court.[1] It is possible that there were two diplomatic missions to the Rus at this time, with Roger of Chalons also present.[1][3][4] No record of the marriage negotiations or the dowry arrangements survives, although Anne reportedly left Kiev with \"rich presents\".[1] Gregorovich claims that part of the wealth she brought to France included the jacinth jewel that Abbot Suger later mounted on a reliquary of St. Denis.[3][5] Anne left Kiev in the summer or fall of 1050 and traveled to Reims.[1]\n\nKing Henry and Anne of Kiev had four known children, three sons and one daughter:\n\nPhilip I of France (1052-1108): Philip was born in 1052 and succeeded his father as King of France upon his death in 1060. He ruled for 48 years until his death in 1108. Philip was known for his military campaigns, expansion of the royal domain, and his tumultuous personal life.\n\nHugh de Vermandois (1053-1101): Hugh \"the Great\" was born in 1057 and was the eldest surviving son of Henry I. He was given the title of Duke of the Franks and Count of Vermandois. Hugh was a powerful and influential figure in French politics during the reigns of his brother, Philip, and his nephew, Louis VI. He also has a great posterity thru which many European royal families trace their ancestry\n\nEmma Capet (1054-c1109)-\n\nRobert Capet (c1055-c1060): Robert was born in 1054 and was given the title of Duke of Burgundy. He rebelled against his brother, Philip, and was imprisoned for a time. He later reconciled with his brother and served as regent for his nephew, Louis VI.\n\nAdele: Adele was born in 1067 and married the Count of Flanders, Baldwin V. She was known for her piety and charitable works, and was later canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church.\n\nHenry and Anne of Kiev are additionally said to have been the parents of the beatified figure Edigna.\n\nSome information in this article or section has not been verified and may not be reliable.\n\nPlease check for any inaccuracies, and modify and cite sources as needed.\n\n2nd Marriage: Ralph IV of Valois\n\nHer second husband was Count Raoul IV de Vexin (?-1074).[9] This marriage was controversial because of the couple's affinity (as Ralph was Henry's cousin), and it constituted bigamy, since Ralph was still technically married to his second wife, Haquenez.[1] Ralph was excommunicated for these transgressions.[1] King Philip's advisers may have encouraged him to turn away from his mother, perhaps mistrusting Ralph's influence.[9] Ralph began referring to himself as the king's stepfather in the late 1060s.[1] He died in 1074, leaving Anne a widow once again.[1]\n\nRegent of France\n\nAlthough Philip I of France (1052-1108) was crowned king at the age of seven, until age fourteen (1066) his mother acted as regent, the first queen of France ever to do so. Baldwin V of Flanders also acted as co-regent.\n\nChildren\n\nOffspring of Henry I of France (1008-1060) and Anne of Kiev Name Birth Death Joined with Philip I of France (1052-1108) 23 May 1052 29 July 1108 Melun Bertha van Holland (c1058-1094)Bertrade de Montfort (c1059-1117) Hugh de Vermandois (1053-1101) 1053 Meulan-en-Yvelines, France 18 October 1101 Tarsus, Mersin, Turkey Adelaide de Vermandois (1064-1120) Emma Capet (1054-c1109) 1054 1109 Robert Capet (c1055-c1060) 1055 1060\n\nSiblings\n\nOffspring of Yaroslav I Vladimirovich of Kiev (c978-1054) and Nomen nescio Name Birth Death Joined with Ilya Yaroslavich of Novgorod (1018-c1034) 1018 1034\n\nOffspring of Yaroslav I Vladimirovich of Kiev (c978-1054) and Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden (1001-1050) Name Birth Death Joined with Vladimir Yaroslavich of Novgorod (1020-1052) 1020 Veliky Novgorod, Veliky Novgorod Urban Okrug, Novgorod Oblast, Russia 4 October 1052 Veliky Novgorod, Veliky Novgorod Urban Okrug, Novgorod Oblast, Russia Nomen nescio Anastasya Yaroslavna of Kiev (1023-c1074) 1023 1074 Andrew I of Hungary (c1014-1060) Izyaslav I Yaroslavich of Kiev (1024-1078) 1024 3 October 1078 Gertrude of Poland (c1025-1108) Yelizaveta Yaroslavna of Kiev (1025-1067) 1025 1067 Harald III Hardrada (c1046-1066) Anna Yaroslavna of Kiev (c1028-1075) 1024 1075 Henry I of France (1008-1060)Raoul IV de Vexin (?-1074) Daughter Daughter Svyatoslav II Yaroslavich of Kiev (1027-1076) 1027 27 December 1076 Kiev Cecilia of Dithmarschen (c1030-c1070)Oda von Babenberg (c1040-c1087) Vsevolod I Yaroslavich of Kiev (1030-1093) 1030 13 April 1093 Vyshgorod, Vyshhorod Rayon, Kiev Oblast, Ukraine Anastasia Monomachos (c1035-1067)Anna Polovetskaya (c1050-1111) Igor Yaroslavich of Volhynia (1036-1060) 1036 Veliky Novgorod, Novgorod Oblast, Russia 1060 Smolensk, Smolensk Oblast, Russia Kunigunde of Orlamünde Vyacheslav Yaroslavich of Smolensk (1036-1057) 1036 Kiev, Ukraine 1057 Oda of Stade (c1036-c1075)\n\nAncestry Trees\n\nThe royal Russian ancestry of many European royals is traced the Ancestry of Princess Anne of Kiev, a Russian Princess who in the year 1061, married King Henry I of France.\n\nCharlemagne Family Ancestry - husband's ancestry\n\nAncestry of Princess Anne of Kiev\n\nRurik Family Ancestry\n\nCapetian dynasty\n\nSee Also\n\nwikipedia:en:Anne of Kiev\n\nAnne of Kiev at thePeerage\n\nCapetian Kings - Foundation for Medieval Genealogy\n\nAnna of Kiev, Queen Consort of the Franks - Geni.com\n\nAnne of Kiev at Find A Grave\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nTemplate:Cite Q\n\nBauthier, Robert-Henri.
