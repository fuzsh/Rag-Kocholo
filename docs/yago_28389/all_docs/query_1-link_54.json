        "text": "‘I'm finally beginning to feel and understand that I am king’, Henry Valois reportedly said upon his arrival in Poland in January 1574.Footnote 1 The fourth son of Henry II of France and Catherine de Medici, twenty-two-year-old Henry was elected king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1573, following the death of the last Jagiellonian king, Sigismund II August. Before his arrival in Poland, Henry was one of the key figures in the French Wars of Religion. Across Europe, he was believed to be at least partly responsible for the St Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572), during which Catholics brutally murdered thousands of Protestants.Footnote 2 Henry also commanded the Catholic forces at the siege of Protestant-held La Rochelle (1572–3), his first significant military experience. After only five months in residence as king of Poland–Lithuania, Henry fled Poland in June 1574 and returned to France upon inheriting the French throne from his brother, Charles IX. When he failed to return within the deadline set by the Polish nobility, Henry was deposed and a new king, Stephen Bathory, was elected in 1575. Before his election and flight, Henry was seemingly the ideal prince, but by the end of his life he was branded a violent tyrant and idle monarch, who allowed his mignons, or favourites, to run the kingdom and isolated himself from his subjects.Footnote 3 These accusations stemmed in part from the fact that Henry's French subjects found his style of kingship and court difficult to accept because it contrasted so sharply with that of his father and brother.Footnote 4\n\nHenry's short Polish–Lithuanian reign provides historians of more familiar early modern kingships and courts an entrée into the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It also throws into sharp relief how early modern kingship was not a singular, transnational phenomenon, but its varieties were strongly conditioned by differing political cultures and expectations. Indeed, Henry's expectations of his new role were surely shaped by his experience of the French court and its focus on the monarch's personal needs and tastes as the main source of secular authority.Footnote 5 This placed him at odds with the Polish–Lithuanian model of elective kingship and the clear sense that the Commonwealth was a descendant of the Roman Republic.Footnote 6 At the same time, Henry's Polish reign shows that a monarch's kingship could be transnational, shaped by international networks and experiences gained in different political contexts. Henry's attempts to navigate and subvert the Polish court, a state institution largely controlled by appointed officers rather than the king's household, not only reflected his immediate needs but, as this article contends, presaged his later French reign.\n\nHenry's experience as the elected ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth has been overlooked in attempts to understand his French kingship. Modern anglophone and francophone historiography has been largely concerned with revising our understanding of Henry inherited from Bourbon historians.Footnote 7 Pierre Chevallier, Jacqueline Boucher, Nicolas Le Roux, Michel Pernot, and Robert Knecht have done much to rehabilitate Henry's reputation and represent the complexities of his French reign and character.Footnote 8 On Henry's Polish reign, anglophone and francophone historians use works by Pierre Champion and the marquis de Noailles, which are respectively c. 80 and 150 years old, based primarily on French sources, and perpetuate old stereotypes of Poland–Lithuania.Footnote 9 The Chevallier and Knecht biographies devote less space to Henry's five months in residence as king of Poland–Lithuania than the five weeks he spent in Venice following his flight from Cracow. Similarly, Le Roux's magisterial work on the development of Henry's mignons nonetheless does not closely consider the impact of the Polish political system and court.Footnote 10 Any significant or long-term impact of Henry's first experience of kingship in a state very different to France is therefore lost.\n\nThis neglect of Henry's Polish–Lithuanian kingship is also notable given that until the end of his life Henry both self-identified and was thought of as ‘Roi de Pologne’ as well as ‘Roi de France’. The first medal that names Henry ‘Roi de Pologne’ portrays him with Charles IX to commemorate the Polish election of 1573.Footnote 11 Another medal, pressed in 1574, names Henry ‘Francorum et Polonorum Rex’.Footnote 12 Even after Henry was deposed by the Polish nobility in 1575, he continued to identify himself as the king of Poland. Medals from 1575, 1577, and 1588 identify him squarely as Roi de France et Pologne and some include images of Henry's two crowns on the reverse.Footnote 13 Even French coins minted in Henry's time bear his Polish title.Footnote 14 Not only was Henry thought of and represented as king of Poland during his lifetime, it was also an enduring part of his legacy. A book of Henry's ordinances for the order of the Holy Spirit published in 1594 reproduces on the cover his double coat of arms: the French fleurs-de-lis together with the Commonwealth's Polish eagle and Lithuanian Pahonia.Footnote 15 These items were collected in an exhibition ‘Fêtes et Crimes à la Renaissance: La Cour d'Henri III’ held at Blois in 2010. The beautifully illustrated catalogue includes essays on aspects of Henry's reign and court written by experts, but even though the objects tell the story of his dual identity, no essay contextualizes his Polish–Lithuanian experience.Footnote 16\n\nThat we little understand how Henry might have been shaped by his Polish kingship is compounded by the fact that the last significant Polish study of Henry's reign is Stanisław Grzybowski's 1980 biography, which focuses on the religious issues that surrounded Henry's election and both kingships.Footnote 17 This followed Maciej Serwański's 1976 biography, which focused on French–Polish diplomacy and the impact of Henry's election on the relationship between Poland and France until the coronation of Henry's successor, Stephen Bathory, in 1576.Footnote 18 These biographies make extensive use of Polish sources, but neither has been translated into English or French, which means that their influence is largely limited to Polish historiography. Henry's reign does feature in important recent work on the constitutional history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but this focuses almost exclusively on the election, propaganda, and creation of the contractual documents, viz. the Henrician Articles and pacta conventa (discussed below), but otherwise tends to reproduce the Serwański and Grzybowski narratives.Footnote 19\n\nThis study seeks to address these multiple imbalances by using the previously neglected treasury accounts of Henry's Polish court held at the Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw. The accounts were mostly written in the hand of Mikołaj Socha, the dispensator, whose job was to deal with provisions for the court. They record, among other things, preparations for Henry's arrival, coronation expenses, daily lists of food and drink consumed at court often with notes on the king's daily activities, and details of receiving and dispatching ambassadors. These documents can be difficult to interpret because the Polish court remains a notoriously understudied area. Marek Ferenc's recent study of the court structures of the last Jagiellonian, Sigismund August, is an invaluable aid when making sense of Henry's accounts but does not attempt to interpret the role of the court in politics and the political system of the Commonwealth.Footnote 20 The last article to discuss the structures of the court of Stephen Bathory, elected after Henry was deposed, is now over a hundred years old and is similar to Ferenc's study in its focus.Footnote 21 As Urszula Augustyniak argued in her study of Vasa kingship, more work is needed on understanding the functioning of the royal court in the Polish–Lithuanian elective, parliamentary monarchy.Footnote 22 We still lack a historical understanding of how the structures and workings of the Polish court after the fall of the Jagiellonian dynasty related to the political structures of the Commonwealth, what its role was in governing the Commonwealth, and what challenges a newly elected foreign monarch might face in taking control of the court.\n\nThis article makes a twofold argument. First, it argues that Henry's Polish episode was crucial to the development of his characteristic style of kingship and court. By giving us a detailed insight into Henry's day-to-day activities and the workings of his court, the treasury accounts allow us to see that Henry's behaviour presaged the trademark characteristics of his later French kingship. Furthermore, this article shows that some of these practices, which were later thought outlandish in France, were a response to the particular challenges posed by the Polish political system to a newly elected king. James Collins was right to point out that historians too often think of the direction of political or intellectual influence as from West to East and Henry's example is a clear example of a reverse trajectory.Footnote 23 Henry's Polish rule was not an episode disconnected from his later rule in France. Indeed, his French kingship should be seen as the continuation of the style of kingship he inaugurated in Poland in response to Polish circumstances. This allows us to recover a lost political connection between Poland and France, because through Henry the Polish political system had an impact on the French monarchy. This is particularly important because Henry's rule in France during the Wars of Religion helped usher in the absolutism of the seventeenth century.Footnote 24 To show this connection, this article examines the genesis of Henry's mignons, the politics of separating the king's table from the rest of the court, the use of countryside residences for secret dealings in important state matters as means of excluding the parliament, and faction building.\n\nThe second thread of argument demonstrates Henry's active engagement in Polish–Lithuanian politics, both internal and external, and challenges the widely accepted narrative that he was a passive king awaiting his imminent flight to Paris.Footnote 25 The unfortunate tendency to marginalize Poland's political importance and underestimate the extent of its relationships with Western European realms contributes to such representations of Henry's Polish reign.Footnote 26 But Charles IX's swift demise without an heir was not inevitable, and Henry was far from banking his political career on it. By using new evidence from the financial accounts, this article contends that Henry planned to cement his rule in Poland by mounting his own faction and shape the Commonwealth in the long term, and that his diplomatic agenda was more complex than simply keeping the peace on the eastern border until such a time as he deserted the throne.Footnote 27 Too often Henry's Polish reign has been approached from the perspective of his subsequent flight, or by exoticizing rather than contextualizing the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Seeing Henry's behaviour as intrinsically connected to his style of kingship rather than as a measure of his disdain for the Commonwealth and shifting the focus from the flight to his daily activities helps us better understand Henry as an active king, who shaped, admittedly for a short time, Polish politics and court culture.\n\nVII\n\nTo contextualize Henry's French kingship in terms of his Polish kingship helps us to understand better the development of his characteristic style of kingship and court as shaped by two different political systems and cultures. His time in Poland–Lithuania should be understood as one of the most important formative experiences of young Henry, alongside the St Bartholomew's Day massacre and the siege of La Rochelle. The financial accounts of Henry's Polish reign give us a new perspective on his time in the Commonwealth. They help us understand the challenges of his daily life, particularly the constraints on his authority regarding the organization of his court, his income and expenditure, and the scrutiny he faced on these counts. The key characteristics of Henry's kingship, known so well from his later French reign, should be understood in the context of his first experience of being a king. This experience was as unique as the conditions under which an elected Polish monarch had to function. The ‘republic of nobles’ exercised significant power over the royal establishment and there was no easy way for a newly elected monarch to dislodge existing officers of the court. This left very little space for forming a transnational or French establishment. The early genesis of Henry's mignons, his reclusive style of governing, and preference for being surrounded by people he was close to at mealtimes shows how the future king of France was first moulded by the Commonwealth's political system.\n\nFinally, the accounts suggest that the conventional narrative of Henry's flight is a reductive view of his short Polish reign, not least because it assumes that Charles IX's quick demise without an heir was inevitable. Henry clearly did not have such firm assumptions himself and he could not bank his entire future on reports of his brother's ill health. It is possible Orzelski understood the significance of Henry's trip to Niepołomice, but his account, written in the aftermath of Henry's shocking departure, relentlessly centres Henry's disinterest in Poland, helping create the ‘flight narrative’ so persistent in the Polish historiography on Henry. It remains difficult to recover with any certainty plans that never came to fruition, but the accounts provide strong circumstantial evidence that Henry was formulating such plans by working with powerful Catholic interests. As such, Henry's flight was an immediate response to a short-term crisis, neither predetermining his actions in the Commonwealth nor suggesting he regarded the Polish crown as a short-term prospect. That he retained his claim to the Polish crown suggests his few months in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth cannot be dismissed as an insignificant ‘episode’ but are instead central to any understanding of his kingship; that the Polish–Lithuanian nobility could not indefinitely tolerate Henry's absence reminds us of the centrality of the crown and the court to the functioning of the Commonwealth's parliamentary system."
