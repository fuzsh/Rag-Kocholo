The royal demesne of France reached its smallest size during his reign, and for this reason he is often seen as emblematic of the weakness of the early Capetians. This is not entirely agreed upon, however, as other historians regard him as a strong but realistic king, who was forced to conduct a policy mindful of the limitations of the French monarchy.\n\nReign\n\nA member of the House of Capet, Henry was born in Reims, the son of King Robert II (972–1031) and Constance of Arles (986–1034). He was crowned King of France at the Cathedral in Reims on 14 May 1027, in the Capetian tradition, while his father still lived. He had little influence and power until he became sole ruler on his father's death.\n\nThe reign of Henry I, like those of his predecessors, was marked by territorial struggles. Initially, he joined his brother Robert, with the support of their mother, in a revolt against his father (1025). His mother, however, supported Robert as heir to the old king, on whose death Henry was left to deal with his rebel sibling. In 1032, he placated his brother by giving him the duchy of Burgundy which his father had given him in 1016.\n\nIn an early strategic move, Henry came to the rescue of his very young nephew-in-law, the newly appointed Duke William of Normandy (who would go on to become William the Conqueror), to suppress a revolt by William's vassals. In 1047, Henry secured the dukedom for William in their decisive victory over the vassals at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes near Caen.\n\nA few years later, when William married Matilda, the daughter of the count of Flanders, Henry feared William's potential power. In 1054, and again in 1057, Henry went to war to try to conquer Normandy from William, but on both occasions he was defeated. Despite his efforts, Henry I's twenty-nine-year reign saw feudal power in France reach its pinnacle.\n\nHenry had three meetings with Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor—all at Ivois. In early 1043, he met him to discuss the marriage of the emperor with Agnes of Poitou, the daughter of Henry's vassal. In October 1048, the two Henries met again, but the subject of this meeting eludes us. The final meeting took place in May 1056. It concerned disputes over Lorraine. The debate over the duchy became so heated that the king of France challenged his German counterpart to single combat. The emperor, however, was not so much a warrior and he fled in the night; despite this, Henry did not get Lorraine.\n\nKing Henry I died on 4 August 1060 in Vitry-en-Brie, France, and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Philip I of France, who was 7 at the time of his death; for six years Henry I's Queen, Anne of Kiev, ruled as regent.\n\nHe was also Duke of Burgundy from 1016 to 1032, when he abdicated the duchy to his brother Robert Capet.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(from wikipedia.fr) Il est fiancé en 1033 à Mahaut (Mathilda, v.1027 - 1034), fille en bas-âge de l'empereur Conrad II le Salique, mais celle-ci trouve la mort à l'âge de sept ans.\n\nEn 1034, il épouse en premières noces Mathilde de Frise, (v. 1025/1026 - 1044), fille de Luidolf de Frise. Le 19 mai 1051 à Reims, il épouse en secondes noces Anne de Kiev, fille de Iaroslav le Sage, grand-prince de Kiev, et de Ingigerd de Suède.\n\nEnsemble ils eurent:\n\n* Philippe Ier (1052-1108)\n\n* Robert (1054-1063)\n\n* Emma (1055-1109)\n\n* Hugues (1057-1102), comte de Vermandois, époux d'Adélaïde de Vermandois.\n\nLeur fils aîné, associé au trône en 1059, succède à son père sous le nom de Philippe Ier.\n\nFrom the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy page on France Capetian Kings (covering his birth family):\n\nhttp://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/CAPET.htm#HenriIdied1060A\n\nROBERT de France, son of HUGUES Capet King of France & his wife Adelais [de Poitou] (Orléans ([27 Mar] 972-Château de Melun 20 Jul 1031, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis).\n\nThe Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Robertum regem et filiam Hadevidem…comitissam Hainonensium\" as the children of King Hugues[148].\n\nHe was invested as associate-king with his father 25 Dec 987, consecrated 1 Apr 988 at the cathedral of Sainte-Croix in Orléans[149]. He succeeded his father in 996 as ROBERT II \"le Pieux\"[150] King of France.\n\nHe claimed the duchy of Burgundy on the death of his paternal uncle Duke Henri in 1002, but took 12 years to complete its conquest in the face of opposition from Otto-Guillaume Comte de Mâcon[151].\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Heinrich II King of Germany in 1024, King Robert supported the rebels (led by Frédéric II Duke of Upper Lotharingia) opposed to King Konrad II but he refused the crown of Italy which they offered it to him. Robert nevertheless sent troops to attack Metz, but was repulsed[152].\n\nThe Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records the death in 1031 of \"rex Francorum Robertus\"[153]. Rodolfus Glaber records the death of King Robert at Melun in July and his place of burial[154]. The necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XII Kal Aug\" of \"Rotbertus rex\"[155]. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"XIII Kal Aug\" of \"Rotbertus…Francorum rex\"[156].\n\nm firstly (988, before 1 Apr, repudiated [991/92]%29 as her second husband, ROZALA [Suzanne] di Ivrea, widow of ARNOUL II “le Jeune” Count of Flanders, daughter of BERENGARIO II ex-King of Italy [Ivrea] & his wife Willa of Tuscany-Arles ([950/960]-13 Dec 1003 or 7 Feb 1004, bur Gent, church of the Abbey de Saint-Pierre du Mont-Blandin).\n\nRegino records that two of the daughters (unnamed) of ex-King Berengario were brought up in the imperial palace by the empress after being brought to Germany[157]. One of these two daughters was presumably Rozala, bearing in mind that the emperor arranged her marriage.\n\nThe Genealogica Comitum Flandriæ Bertiniana names \"filiam Berengeri regis Langobardorum, Ruzelam quæ et Susanna\" as wife of Comte Arnoul[158]. The Annales Elnonenses Minores record the marriage [undated between 950 and 968] of \"Arnulfus iunior\" and \"filiam Beregeri regis Susannam\"[159]. Her marriage was presumably arranged by Emperor Otto to increase his influence in Flanders at a time when Lothaire IV King of the West Franks was asserting his own control over the county.\n\nAccording to Nicholas, Count Arnoul II married Rozala di Ivrea when he reached the age of majority in 976[160], but the source on which this is based has not been located. \"Baldwinus marchysus cum matre sua Susanna\" donated \"villam Aflingehem…jacentem in pago Tornacinse\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand, after the death of \"Arnulfi marchysi\", by charter dated 1 Apr 988, signed by \"…Waldberto advocato, Theoderico comite, Arnulfo comite, Artoldo comite, Baldwino comite, item Arnulfo comite…\"[161]. The Vita Sancti Bertulfi names \"Rozala filia…Berengarii Regis Italiæ\", specifying that \"post mortem Arnulfi [Balduini filius] principis, Roberto Regi Francorum nupsit et Susanna dicta\"[162]. Kerrebrouck, presumably basing his supposition on this passage from the Vita Sancti Bertulfi, says that she adopted the name Suzanne on her second marriage[163], but the sources quoted above show that she was referred to by this name earlier.\n\nHugues \"Capet\" King of France arranged her second marriage to his son and heir, apparently as a reward for Flemish help when he seized power in 987[164]. She was given Montreuil-sur-Mer by the county of Flanders as her dowry on her second marriage.\n\nRicher records that King Robert repudiated his wife \"Susannam…genere Italicam eo quod anus esset\" but refused to allow her to retake her castle at Montreuil, whereupon she constructed another nearby[165]. She returned to Flanders after she was repudiated by her second husband, and became one of the principal advisers of her son Count Baldwin IV. France retained Montreuil-sur-Mer.\n\n\"Susanna regina cum filio suo Baldwino\" donated \"alodem suum…Atingehem…et in Testereph\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand, for the soul of \"filie sue Mathildis\", by charter dated 26 Jun 995[166]. \"Susanna regina…cum filio suo Baldwino\" donated \"alodem suum…in pago Flandrensi…in Holtawa…in Fresnere…in Clemeskirca…in Jatbeka…in Sclefteta…\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand by charter dated 1 Jun 1003[167]. The Annales Elnonenses Minores records the death in 1003 of \"Susanna regina\"[168]. The Memorial of \"regina Susanna\" records her death \"VII Feb\"[169].\n\nm secondly ([late 996/early 997], divorced Sep 1001) BERTHE of Burgundy, widow of EUDES I Comte de Blois et de Chartres, daughter of CONRAD I “le Pacifique” King of Burgundy [Welf] & his wife Mathilde de France [Carolingian] ([964/965]-16 Jan after 1010).\n\nThe Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum names \"Berta filia Conradi regis Burgundiæ\" as wife of \"Odone comite Carnotensium\"[170]. This origin is corroborated by Rodulfus Glauber who names \"Odo natus ex filia Chuonradi regis Austrasiorum, Berta nomine\"[171]. Richer records that King Robert married \"Berta Odonis uxor\"[172].\n\nPope Gregory V called on King Robert to repudiate his wife in 998 on grounds of consanguinity. The request was repeated in 1001 by the court of Rome. Robert at first refused and the kingdom of France was excommunicated[173].\n\n\"Bertæ reginæ, Odonis comitis filii eius…\" subscribed the charter dated 1004 under which \"Gislebertus prepositus\" recorded a donation[174].\n\nThe king, in reaction to the 1108 assassination of his favourite Hugues de Beauvais who had served Queen Berthe, visited Rome in 1008 in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce his third wife in order to take back Berthe[175].\n\n\"Odonis comitis, Ermengardis uxoris eius, Bertæ reginæ…\" subscribed the charter dated after 1005 under which \"comitem Odonem\" donated property \"in comitatu Dunensi…Boscus Medius\" to \"Sancti Petri\"[176].\n\nThe necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XVII Kal Feb\" of \"Berta mater Odonis comitis\"[177].\n\nm thirdly (after Sep 1001 before 25 Aug 1003) CONSTANCE d'Arles, daughter of GUILLAUME II “le Libérateur” Comte d’Arles [Provence] et Marquis & his wife Adelais [Blanche] d’Anjou ([987/89]-Château de Melun 22 or 25 Jul 1032, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis).\n\nThe Historia Francorum names \"Constantiam, filiam Guillelmi comitis Arelatensis, natam de Blanca sorore Gaufridi comitis Andegavensis\" as wife of King Robert[178]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also names \"Constantia filia fuit Blanche comitisse Arelatensis\" as wife of \"Robertus rex\"[179]. The Chronicon Hugonis names \"Constantiam\" as wife of \"Robertus\", specifying that she was \"cognatam Hugonis Autisiodorensis episcopi comitis Cabilonensis\"[180]. This is presumably based on Rodulfus Glaber who states incorrectly that \"Constantiam…filiam…prioris Willemi Aquitanie ducis\" was wife of King Robert II, specifying that she was \"cognatam\" of Hugues Comte de Chalon Bishop of Auxerre[181]. The only relationship so far identified between the two is that Constance's maternal uncle, Geoffroy I Comte d'Anjou, was the second husband of the mother of Comte Hugues.\n\nRodulfus Glauber dates her marriage to \"about the year 1000\"[182].\n\nThe king attempted to separate from Constance in 1008 in order to take back his second wife, according to Rodulfus Glaber through the influence of \"Hugo dictus Beluacensis\"[183], but he restored Constance's royal prerogatives end-1009[184].\n\nShe opposed her husband's proposal to crown their second son Henri as associate king in 1026, supporting the candidature of her third son Robert[185]. She organised two revolts against King Robert, and another against her son King Henri I after his accession in 1031[186].\n\nRodolfus Glaber records the death of Queen Constance in the same city as her husband [Melun] and in the same month [July] in the following year, as well as her place of burial[187]. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"XI Kal Aug\" of \"regina Constancia\"[188]. The necrology of Argenteuil Priory records the death \"VIII Kal Aug\" of \"Constancia regina\"[189].\n\nKing Robert & his third wife had [seven] children:\n\n1. [CONSTANCE de France.\n\nThere is no proof that Constance, wife of Manassès de Dammartin, was the daughter of King Robert II, the affiliation being proposed for onomastic reasons only[190]. It is, however, supported by the presence of the king and queen at a donation by Comte Manassès in 1031[191].\n\nRodolfus Glaber records that King Robert had two daughters by his wife Constance[192], presumably referring to Hedwige and Adela. According to Europäische Stammtafeln[193], the wife of Manassès was \"Constance [de Dammartin]\", presumably on the theory that she brought her husband the county of Dammartin.\n\nm ([1023 or before]) MANASSES Comte de Dammartin-en-Goële, son of HILDUIN II de Montdidier Seigneur de Ramérupt & his wife --- (-killed in battle Ornel, near Etain, Bar-le-Duc 15 Nov or 15 Dec 1037).]\n\n2. HEDWIGE [Avoie] de France ([1003]-5 Jun after 1063).\n\nRodolfus Glaber records that \"Rainaldus…Landrici comitis filius\" married a daughter of King Robert[194]. The Chronici Hugonis Floriacensis names \"Adelaidem…Rainaldi comitis Nivernensis uxorem\" as the daughter of King Robert and his wife Constance[195]. The Historia Nivernensium Comitum records that the wife of \"Renaldum\" was \"sorori Regis Roberti, filii Hugonis Capitonis\"[196]. The Annales Vizeliacenses also specifies that Renaud's wife was the sister not daughter of King Robert II[197]. However, this is chronologically unlikely given that King Robert and his known sisters were born in the 970s, more than 20 years before the earliest possible date of birth of Comte Renaud.\n\nHer marriage was agreed by her father as part of his alliance with Landry Comte de Nevers after capturing Auxerre, which the king gave to his daughter as dowry[198]. \"Rainaldus comes Nivernensis\" donated property \"Belmontis\" to Cluny, for the souls of \"…uxoris mee Advise…\" by charter dated to [1028/40][199].\n\nShe founded the abbeys of Crisenon and Issenon.\n\nm (1006, soon after 25 Jan 1016) RENAUD de Nevers, son of LANDRY Comte de Nevers & his wife Mathilde de Bourgogne-Comté (-killed in battle Sainte-Vertu, Yonne 29 May 1040, bur Auxerre, Saint-Germain).\n\nHe succeeded his father in 1028 as RENAUD I Comte de Nevers.\n\nHe was killed in battle against Robert I Duke of Burgundy, his brother-in-law.\n\n3.

He was installed as ROBERT I \"le Vieux\" Duke of Burgundy in 1032 by his brother King Henri I.\n\n6.

He was crowned King of France at the Cathedral in Reims on 14 May 1027, in the Capetian tradition, while his father still lived.

Inicialmente aliou-se ao seu irmão Roberto, com o apoio da sua mãe, numa revolta contra seu pai em 1025.\n\nMas ao subir efectivamente ao trono teve de fazer frente à hostilidade da sua mãe e dos grandes vassalos que pretendiam coroar o seu irmão Roberto. Henrique obteve o apoio do Sacro Imperador Romano Conrado II da Germânia e principalmente o de Roberto I da Normandia, e para obter a paz teve de ceder o ducado da Borgonha como apanágio ao seu irmão.\n\nHenrique encontrou-se três vezes em Ivois com Henrique III da Germânia, o sucessor de Conrado II. No início de 1043 discutiram o casamento do imperador com Inês de Poitou, filha de Guilherme V, Duque da Aquitânia. Reuniram-se mais uma vez em Outubro de 1048, e finalmente em Maio de 1056, desta vez para resolver uma disputa sobre a Lorena. O debate sobre este ducado tornou-se tão hostil que o rei da França desafiou o imperador germânico para um duelo. O segundo fugiu da região durante a noite, mas mesmo assim Henrique não conseguiu ficar na posse da Lorena.\n\nTutor de Guilherme I de Inglaterra, futuro duque da Normandia, apoiou-o inicialmente contra os seus vassalos, principalmente na batalha de Val-ès-Dunes em 1047, perto de Caen. Depois entraram em conflito. Quando o Conquistador, primo do rei inglês Eduardo o Confessor, casou-se com Matilde, filha de Balduíno V, conde da Flandres, Henrique temeu o seu poder crescente. Tentou conquistar-lhe a Normandia na batalha de Mortemer em 1054, e de novo em 1057 em Varaville, sem sucesso.\n\nDurante o seu reinado, Henrique I perdeu a Borgonha e apenas conquistou Sens. Os domínios reais atingiram a extensão mínima territorial em toda a história da França, pelo que este rei é visto como o epíteto da fraqueza da dinastia Capetiana inicial, contra um poder feudal no seu auge. Foi durante este período difícil que os bispos franceses proclamaram a Paz de Deus e a Trégua de Deus, para controlar a violência feudal pelo meio de sanções religiosas.\n\nHenrique morreu em 4 de Agosto de 1060 em Vitry-en-Brie, e foi sepultado na Basílica de Saint-Denis. Foi sucedido pelo seu filho Filipe I de França aos 7 anos de idade, sob a regência de Ana de Kiev.\n\nDarryl Lundy's Peerage page on Henri I of France:\n\nhttp://www.thepeerage.com/p10310.htm#i103097\n\nHenri I, Roi de France [1]\n\nM, #103097, b.

Aug. 2, 1060, Vitry-aux-Loges, France\n\nking of France from 1026 to 1060 whose reign was marked by struggles against rebellious vassals.\n\nThe son of Robert II the Pious and grandson of Hugh Capet, founder of the Capetian dynasty, Henry was anointed king at Reims (1026) in his father's lifetime, following the death of his elder brother Hugh. His mother, Constance, however, favoured his younger brother Robert for the throne, and civil war broke out on King Robert II's death (1031). The younger Robert was given Burgundy in 1032, after Henry had sought refuge with Robert, Duke of Normandy. From 1033 to 1043 Henry struggled with his feudatories, notably Eudes of Blois and his brother Robert. In 1055, as the result of an agreement made by Robert II, the county of Sens came to the crown as the sole territorial gain of Henry's reign.\n\nHenry helped William (the future William I of England), Robert's successor as duke of Normandy, to quell his rebellious vassals at the Battle of Val-aux-Dunes (or Val-ès-Dunes; 1047), but he was thereafter usually at war with him--a notable defeat for the king being that at Varaville (1058). Henry tried to resist papal interference but could not prevent Pope Leo IX from holding a council at Reims (1049). Philip, elder son of Henry's marriage to a Russian princess, was crowned in 1059.\n\nCopyright © 1994-2001 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\n\n---\n\nHistory: Henry I (of France) (circa 1008-1060), king of France (1031-1060), son of King Robert II and grandson of Hugh Capet, founder of the Capetian dynasty.

He went to a doctor in Chartres & obtained a potion to restore his health. Apparently he disobeyed the instructions as he was dead the next day.\n\nSources:\n\nComptons Interactive Encyclopedia\n\nThe book, 'The Oxford History of Medieval Europe'\n\nThe book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'\n\nBen M. Angel on the death of Henri I:\n\nThe suggestion of Henri I's death by elixir is rather difficult to pin down. The most reputable and complete source for it appears to be secondary (Debrett's Kings and Queens of Europe):\n\n\"Henry I's reign saw the burning of Paris and a famine of seven year's duration. The King appears to have been something of a nonentity and is chiefly remembered for the novelty of his second marriage. His first wife, Matilda, niece of the Emperor Conrad II, bore one daughter who died young and died herself very soon after. Henry, anxious to avoid a marriage within the prohibited degrees of kindred and affinity, determined to find his next bride from far afield and in 1051 married Anne, daughter of Yaroslav I, Great Prince of Kiev, who duly bore him three sons. The eldest, Philip, was crowned as associate King at the age of 7 in May 1059. Although only 52, Henry apparently suffered from premature senility, being described as \"old and wretched\". He obtained a potion which he hoped would restore his health and prolong his life from a doctor in Chartres, but apparently disobeyed the instructions to take it without water and died the next day. Philip succeeded at the age of 8. Queen Anne refused the regency. She was soon after abducted by Count Raoul de Crepy and eventually became his second wife.\"\n\nThe first and foremost problem with this is, of course, the lack of a primary source for the assertion of his death by self-poisoning. His physician, Jean Cormier, did indeed come from Chartres - he apparently paid for a porch off the south transept of the Chartres Cathedral before 1060, page 15 of \"The City of Chartres: Its Cathedral and Churches by H.J.L.J. Masse:\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/stream/cityofchartresit00massuoft#page/15/mo...\n\nThere is at least one identifiable glaring mistake in the research by Debrett, as Queen Anne did not refuse the regency. She was in fact the first French Queen to serve in such a role, albeit as co-regent with the young Philippe's uncle, Baudouin V, Comte de Flandres. She remained in that role for a year before her affair with Raoul began with an arranged \"abduction\" (accompanied later by scandal when she married him as her second husband).\n\nThe Medlands project shows no information on Henri's death, indicating a likely lack of primary sources for the supposition of his death by elixir. Until a primary source is found, the cause of his death should remain blank.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_France\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_France\n\nsee- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_France\n\nHenry I (4 May 1008 – 4 August 1060) was King of France from 1031 to his death.

In 1032, he placated his brother by giving him the duchy of Burgundy which his father had given him in 1016.\n\nIn an early strategic move, Henry came to the rescue of his very young nephew-in-law, the newly appointed Duke William of Normandy (who would go on to become William the Conqueror), to suppress a revolt by William's vassals. In 1047, Henry secured the dukedom for William in their decisive victory over the vassals at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes near Caen.\n\nA few years later, when William married Matilda, the daughter of the count of Flanders, Henry feared William's potential power.

Henry then married Matilda of Frisia, but she died in 1044, following a Caesarean section. Casting further afield in search of a third wife, Henry married Anne of Kiev on 19 May 1051. They had four children: 1.Philip I (23 May 1052 – 30 July 1108) 2.Emma (born 1054, date of death unknown) 3.Robert (c. 1055 – c. 1060) 4.Hugh \"the Great\" of Vermandois (1057–1102)\n\nAncestry[edit]\n\n[show]Ancestors of Henry I of France\n\nSources[edit] Vajay, S.

He succeeded his father in 996 as ROBERT II \"le Pieux\"[150] King of France.\n\nHe claimed the duchy of Burgundy on the death of his paternal uncle Duke Henri in 1002, but took 12 years to complete its conquest in the face of opposition from Otto-Guillaume Comte de Mâcon[151].\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Heinrich II King of Germany in 1024, King Robert supported the rebels (led by Frédéric II Duke of Upper Lotharingia) opposed to King Konrad II but he refused the crown of Italy which they offered it to him. Robert nevertheless sent troops to attack Metz, but was repulsed[152].\n\nThe Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records the death in 1031 of \"rex Francorum Robertus\"[153]. Rodolfus Glaber records the death of King Robert at Melun in July and his place of burial[154]. The necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XII Kal Aug\" of \"Rotbertus rex\"[155]. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"XIII Kal Aug\" of \"Rotbertus…Francorum rex\"[156].\n\nm firstly (988, before 1 Apr, repudiated [991/92]%29 as her second husband, ROZALA [Suzanne] di Ivrea, widow of ARNOUL II “le Jeune” Count of Flanders, daughter of BERENGARIO II ex-King of Italy [Ivrea] & his wife Willa of Tuscany-Arles ([950/960]-13 Dec 1003 or 7 Feb 1004, bur Gent, church of the Abbey de Saint-Pierre du Mont-Blandin).\n\nRegino records that two of the daughters (unnamed) of ex-King Berengario were brought up in the imperial palace by the empress after being brought to Germany[157]. One of these two daughters was presumably Rozala, bearing in mind that the emperor arranged her marriage.\n\nThe Genealogica Comitum Flandriæ Bertiniana names \"filiam Berengeri regis Langobardorum, Ruzelam quæ et Susanna\" as wife of Comte Arnoul[158]. The Annales Elnonenses Minores record the marriage [undated between 950 and 968] of \"Arnulfus iunior\" and \"filiam Beregeri regis Susannam\"[159]. Her marriage was presumably arranged by Emperor Otto to increase his influence in Flanders at a time when Lothaire IV King of the West Franks was asserting his own control over the county.\n\nAccording to Nicholas, Count Arnoul II married Rozala di Ivrea when he reached the age of majority in 976[160], but the source on which this is based has not been located. \"Baldwinus marchysus cum matre sua Susanna\" donated \"villam Aflingehem…jacentem in pago Tornacinse\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand, after the death of \"Arnulfi marchysi\", by charter dated 1 Apr 988, signed by \"…Waldberto advocato, Theoderico comite, Arnulfo comite, Artoldo comite, Baldwino comite, item Arnulfo comite…\"[161]. The Vita Sancti Bertulfi names \"Rozala filia…Berengarii Regis Italiæ\", specifying that \"post mortem Arnulfi [Balduini filius] principis, Roberto Regi Francorum nupsit et Susanna dicta\"[162]. Kerrebrouck, presumably basing his supposition on this passage from the Vita Sancti Bertulfi, says that she adopted the name Suzanne on her second marriage[163], but the sources quoted above show that she was referred to by this name earlier.\n\nHugues \"Capet\" King of France arranged her second marriage to his son and heir, apparently as a reward for Flemish help when he seized power in 987[164]. She was given Montreuil-sur-Mer by the county of Flanders as her dowry on her second marriage.\n\nRicher records that King Robert repudiated his wife \"Susannam…genere Italicam eo quod anus esset\" but refused to allow her to retake her castle at Montreuil, whereupon she constructed another nearby[165]. She returned to Flanders after she was repudiated by her second husband, and became one of the principal advisers of her son Count Baldwin IV. France retained Montreuil-sur-Mer.\n\n\"Susanna regina cum filio suo Baldwino\" donated \"alodem suum…Atingehem…et in Testereph\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand, for the soul of \"filie sue Mathildis\", by charter dated 26 Jun 995[166]. \"Susanna regina…cum filio suo Baldwino\" donated \"alodem suum…in pago Flandrensi…in Holtawa…in Fresnere…in Clemeskirca…in Jatbeka…in Sclefteta…\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand by charter dated 1 Jun 1003[167]. The Annales Elnonenses Minores records the death in 1003 of \"Susanna regina\"[168]. The Memorial of \"regina Susanna\" records her death \"VII Feb\"[169].\n\nm secondly ([late 996/early 997], divorced Sep 1001) BERTHE of Burgundy, widow of EUDES I Comte de Blois et de Chartres, daughter of CONRAD I “le Pacifique” King of Burgundy [Welf] & his wife Mathilde de France [Carolingian] ([964/965]-16 Jan after 1010).\n\nThe Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum names \"Berta filia Conradi regis Burgundiæ\" as wife of \"Odone comite Carnotensium\"[170]. This origin is corroborated by Rodulfus Glauber who names \"Odo natus ex filia Chuonradi regis Austrasiorum, Berta nomine\"[171]. Richer records that King Robert married \"Berta Odonis uxor\"[172].\n\nPope Gregory V called on King Robert to repudiate his wife in 998 on grounds of consanguinity. The request was repeated in 1001 by the court of Rome. Robert at first refused and the kingdom of France was excommunicated[173].\n\n\"Bertæ reginæ, Odonis comitis filii eius…\" subscribed the charter dated 1004 under which \"Gislebertus prepositus\" recorded a donation[174].\n\nThe king, in reaction to the 1108 assassination of his favourite Hugues de Beauvais who had served Queen Berthe, visited Rome in 1008 in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce his third wife in order to take back Berthe[175].\n\n\"Odonis comitis, Ermengardis uxoris eius, Bertæ reginæ…\" subscribed the charter dated after 1005 under which \"comitem Odonem\" donated property \"in comitatu Dunensi…Boscus Medius\" to \"Sancti Petri\"[176].\n\nThe necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XVII Kal Feb\" of \"Berta mater Odonis comitis\"[177].\n\nm thirdly (after Sep 1001 before 25 Aug 1003) CONSTANCE d'Arles, daughter of GUILLAUME II “le Libérateur” Comte d’Arles [Provence] et Marquis & his wife Adelais [Blanche] d’Anjou ([987/89]-Château de Melun 22 or 25 Jul 1032, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis).\n\nThe Historia Francorum names \"Constantiam, filiam Guillelmi comitis Arelatensis, natam de Blanca sorore Gaufridi comitis Andegavensis\" as wife of King Robert[178]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also names \"Constantia filia fuit Blanche comitisse Arelatensis\" as wife of \"Robertus rex\"[179]. The Chronicon Hugonis names \"Constantiam\" as wife of \"Robertus\", specifying that she was \"cognatam Hugonis Autisiodorensis episcopi comitis Cabilonensis\"[180]. This is presumably based on Rodulfus Glaber who states incorrectly that \"Constantiam…filiam…prioris Willemi Aquitanie ducis\" was wife of King Robert II, specifying that she was \"cognatam\" of Hugues Comte de Chalon Bishop of Auxerre[181]. The only relationship so far identified between the two is that Constance's maternal uncle, Geoffroy I Comte d'Anjou, was the second husband of the mother of Comte Hugues.\n\nRodulfus Glauber dates her marriage to \"about the year 1000\"[182].\n\nThe king attempted to separate from Constance in 1008 in order to take back his second wife, according to Rodulfus Glaber through the influence of \"Hugo dictus Beluacensis\"[183], but he restored Constance's royal prerogatives end-1009[184].\n\nShe opposed her husband's proposal to crown their second son Henri as associate king in 1026, supporting the candidature of her third son Robert[185]. She organised two revolts against King Robert, and another against her son King Henri I after his accession in 1031[186].\n\nRodolfus Glaber records the death of Queen Constance in the same city as her husband [Melun] and in the same month [July] in the following year, as well as her place of burial[187]. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"XI Kal Aug\" of \"regina Constancia\"[188]. The necrology of Argenteuil Priory records the death \"VIII Kal Aug\" of \"Constancia regina\"[189].\n\nKing Robert & his third wife had [seven] children:\n\n1. [CONSTANCE de France.\n\nThere is no proof that Constance, wife of Manassès de Dammartin, was the daughter of King Robert II, the affiliation being proposed for onomastic reasons only[190]. It is, however, supported by the presence of the king and queen at a donation by Comte Manassès in 1031[191].\n\nRodolfus Glaber records that King Robert had two daughters by his wife Constance[192], presumably referring to Hedwige and Adela. According to Europäische Stammtafeln[193], the wife of Manassès was \"Constance [de Dammartin]\", presumably on the theory that she brought her husband the county of Dammartin.\n\nm ([1023 or before]) MANASSES Comte de Dammartin-en-Goële, son of HILDUIN II de Montdidier Seigneur de Ramérupt & his wife --- (-killed in battle Ornel, near Etain, Bar-le-Duc 15 Nov or 15 Dec 1037).]\n\n2. HEDWIGE [Avoie] de France ([1003]-5 Jun after 1063).\n\nRodolfus Glaber records that \"Rainaldus…Landrici comitis filius\" married a daughter of King Robert[194]. The Chronici Hugonis Floriacensis names \"Adelaidem…Rainaldi comitis Nivernensis uxorem\" as the daughter of King Robert and his wife Constance[195]. The Historia Nivernensium Comitum records that the wife of \"Renaldum\" was \"sorori Regis Roberti, filii Hugonis Capitonis\"[196]. The Annales Vizeliacenses also specifies that Renaud's wife was the sister not daughter of King Robert II[197]. However, this is chronologically unlikely given that King Robert and his known sisters were born in the 970s, more than 20 years before the earliest possible date of birth of Comte Renaud.\n\nHer marriage was agreed by her father as part of his alliance with Landry Comte de Nevers after capturing Auxerre, which the king gave to his daughter as dowry[198]. \"Rainaldus comes Nivernensis\" donated property \"Belmontis\" to Cluny, for the souls of \"…uxoris mee Advise…\" by charter dated to [1028/40][199].\n\nShe founded the abbeys of Crisenon and Issenon.\n\nm (1006, soon after 25 Jan 1016) RENAUD de Nevers, son of LANDRY Comte de Nevers & his wife Mathilde de Bourgogne-Comté (-killed in battle Sainte-Vertu, Yonne 29 May 1040, bur Auxerre, Saint-Germain).\n\nHe succeeded his father in 1028 as RENAUD I Comte de Nevers.\n\nHe was killed in battle against Robert I Duke of Burgundy, his brother-in-law.\n\n3. HUGUES de France (1007-28 Aug 1025, bur Compiègne, church of the Abbaye de Saint-Corneille).\n\nThe Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and Constance[200].\n\nHe was consecrated associate-king 9 Jun 1017, at Compiègne, church of the Abbaye de Saint-Corneille, when he was \"barely 10 years old\" according to Rodolfus Glaber[201].\n\nHe rebelled against his father claiming the full authority of his position as associate-king, but later submitted[202].\n\nThe necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"V Kal Sep\" of \"Hugo iuvenis rex Francorum\"[203]. The necrology of Argenteuil Priory records the death \"V Kal Sep\" of \"Hugo iuvenis rex\"[204]. Rodolfus Glaber records his place of burial[205].\n\n---\n\n4. HENRI de France ([end 1009/May 1010]-Palais de Vitry-aux-Loges, forêt d’Orléans, Loiret 4 Aug 1060, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis).\n\nThe Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and Constance[206].\n\nHe succeeded his father in 1031 as HENRI I King of France.\n\n---\n\n5. ROBERT de France ([1011/12]-church of Fleury-sur-Ouche, Côte d’Or 18 Mar 1076, bur Saint-Seine-l'Abbaye, Côte d’Or).\n\nThe Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and Constance[207].\n\nRodulfus Glauber names \"Heinricus rex…germanium suum Rotbertum\" when recording the latter's installation as duke of Burgundy by his brother[208]. His mother supported him as candidate to be consecrated associate king in 1027, in place of his older brother Henri who was supported by their father.\n\nHis father named him heir to the duchy of Burgundy in 1030. He was installed as ROBERT I \"le Vieux\" Duke of Burgundy in 1032 by his brother King Henri I.\n\n6. EUDES de France ([1013]-Germigny-des-Prés, near Sully, Loiret 15 May [1057/59]).\n\nThe Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and Constance[209].\n\nHe allied himself with Eudes II Comte de Blois in the war against his brother Henri I King of France 1034-1041. He was defeated and imprisoned at Orléans.\n\nAfter his release, he fought for the king in Normandy, but was defeated in 1054 at Mortemer. Orderic Vitalis records the war between the Normans and \"Henricum regem\" in 1054 when \"Odonem fratrem suum\" was defeated by \"Roberti Aucensis comiitis et Rogerii de Mortuomari\" who led the Norman forces \"apud Mortuum-mare\"[210].\n\nHe owned land near Bellême[211].\n\nThe necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"Id Mai\" of \"Odo Roberti regis filius\"[212].\n\n7. ADELA de France (-Messines 8 Jan 1079, bur Messines, Benedictine monastery).\n\nThe Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"soror…regis Henrici Adela\" as wife of \"Balduino Insulano\"[213]. The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Alam comitissam Flandrensem\" as the daughter of King Robert[214]. She is named as daughter of King Robert in a manuscript whose attribution to Orderic Vitalis is disputed, which also refers to her marriage[215].\n\nKerrebrouck mentions her betrothal to Duke Richard \"très jeune\" but does not cite the primary source on which this is based[216].\n\n\"Richardus Nortmannorum dux\" agreed grants of property to \"Adela\" on the occasion of their marriage by charter dated Jan 1026, which does not specify her parentage[217]. Her father gave her the seigneurie of Corbie as her dowry.\n\nCtss de Contenance.\n\nShe founded the Benedictine monastery at Messines near Ypres.\n\nThe necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"VI Id Jan\" of \"Adelaidis comitissa\"[218].\n\nBetrothed (Jan 1027) to RICHARD III Duke of Normandy, son of RICHARD I Duke of Normandy & his first wife Judith de Bretagne ([1001]-6 Aug 1027).\n\nm (Amiens 1028) BAUDOUIN de Flandre, son of BAUDOUIN IV \"le Barbu/Pulchrae Barbae\" Count of Flanders & his first wife Ogive de Luxembourg ([1012/13]-Lille 1 Sep 1067, bur Lille, Saint-Pierre).\n\nHe succeeded his father in 1035 as BAUDOUIN V “le Pieux/Insulanus” Count of Flanders.\n\nHe was regent of France for his nephew Philippe I King of France 1060-1066/67.\n\nReferences:\n\n[148] Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis 2, MGH SS XIII, p. 252.\n\n[149] Kerrebrouck, P.
