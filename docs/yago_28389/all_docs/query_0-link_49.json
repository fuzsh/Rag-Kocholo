In the late forties of the 11th century she married the king Henry I of France (house of Capet) and, after his death, became the queen regent of their underage son; she participated actively in the government of the country and was in fact the reigning queen. The beautiful, highly educated and wise woman excited admiration of her contemporaries and meritoriously represented Kyiv Rus, a developed power that was held in esteem and played an important role in the international relations of the countries of Europe and the Middle East."
