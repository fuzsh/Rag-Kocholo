        "text": "Henry I (born c. 1008—died Aug. 2 or 4, 1060, Vitry-aux-Loges, France) was the king of France from 1026 to 1060 whose reign was marked by struggles against rebellious vassals.\n\nThe son of Robert II the Pious and grandson of Hugh Capet, founder of the Capetian dynasty, Henry was anointed king at Reims (1026) in his father’s lifetime, following the death of his elder brother Hugh. His mother, Constance, however, favoured his younger brother Robert for the throne, and civil war broke out on King Robert II’s death (1031). The younger Robert was given Burgundy in 1032, after Henry had sought refuge with Robert, Duke of Normandy. From 1033 to 1043 Henry struggled with his feudatories, notably Eudes of Blois and his brother Robert. In 1055, as the result of an agreement made by Robert II, the county of Sens came to the crown as the sole territorial gain of Henry’s reign. He attempted to strengthen his rulership through new court officials, and he twice contracted an important marriage alliance with members of the Salian dynasty, rulers of the Holy Roman Empire: he was betrothed to Conrad II’s niece, who died before the marriage could be formalized, and married Henry III’s daughter.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
