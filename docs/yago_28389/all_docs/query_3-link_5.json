        "text": "Sources show:\n\nRegent Dowager Queen Anne de Kiev of France\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Henri I, she reigned jointly with Baudouin V of Flanders in the name of her son, Philippe I. Her subsequent marriage to Raoul, Comte de Valois caused a scandal, since he was already married. He was excommunicated, and she died in a convent. She was daughter of Jarosla Vladimirovich of Kiev and Indegard of Norway, and lived (1051-89).\n\nhttp://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1000.htm\n\nAnna Jaroslavna (1) - (1036 - 1078)\n\nQueen consort of France (1051 - 1060)\n\nPrincess Anna Jaroslavna was the daughter of Jaroslav I Vladimirovich, Grand Prince of Kiev, and his second wife Ingegarde, daughter of Olaf II, King of Sweden. She became the third wife (1051) of Henry I of France, to whom she bore two sons, Philip I (1052 - 1108) and Hugh I, Comte de Vermandois. The kings death (1060) left Anna and Baldwin V of Flanders, as joint regents for Philip I, then aged eight. Despite this arrangement, and with no powerful relatives to spupport her, Queen Anna possessed little real power. She was forcibly abducted by Raoul IV de Crepy, Comte de Valois (1066), and their subsequent marriage aroused the anger and indignation of the French barons. However, the abduction had merely been a foil to preserve the queens dignity, and she proceeded to cohabit with the count as his wife, though he was still legally contracted to his former wife, whom he had dismissed. Even though Raoul was excommunicated for incest, the couple refused to separate. Queen Anna survived Raoul, who died in 1074, but was never again prominent in public affairs during her sons reign. Queen Anna has been credited with introducing some of the ritual of the Greek Orthodox Church to the French Catholic church, and of fostering some interest in Russian art in France. Queen Anna died (Sept 5, 1078) aged about forty-two, and was interrred in the Abbey of Villiers, near La-Ferte-Alais, at Essone.\n\nwww.abitofhistory.net\n\nhttp://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/letter/1190.html\n\nWomen's Biography: Anne of Kiev\n\nWoman's name: Anne of Kiev Woman's title: Queen of France Woman's biography: Anne of Kiev (Anna Yaroslavna), sometimes called Agnes, daughter of Yaroslav I of Kiev and Princess Ingegerd of Sweden; Yaroslav was grand-duke of Kiev and described in medieval histories as king of the Russians \"rex Russorum\" (Hugh of Fleury, Aubry des Trois Fontaines, and Raoul Tortaire). Jaroslavs sister was married to Casimir, king of Poland. Jaroslav and Ingegard had nine children, several of whom were married to royalty: Anastasia to Andrew I of Hungary, Elisabeth to Harold of Norway and later to Sven of Denmark, Isiaslav to the sister of Casimir of Poland, Vsevolod to a daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Vladimir to a niece of a former queen of France, Matilda of Stade. Anne was married in 1051 to Henry I, king of France, whose first two wives had died; she was consecrated queen at Reims when Liebert, bishop of Cambray was consecrated. Anne brought no land to the marriage, but did bring connections and wealth, probably including a jacinth which Suger later mounted in the reliquary of St. Denis (Bauthier, 550; Hallu,168, citing Comptes de Suger). Anne and Henry had three sons, Philip I, born 1052, Robert, born 1054, died young, and Hugh, born 1057, who became count of Vermandois by marriage. Anne is associated in four of Henrys acts, towards the end of his reign: in 1058, a charter of concession to the monastery St. Maur-les-Fosses, \"annuente mea conjuge Anna et prole Philippo, Roberto ac Hugone\" (HGF, 11.600, XXXII); a donation of Villas to the monastery of Hasnon, with the signatures of Henrici regis, Philippi Regis pueri, A. Reginae (HGF 11.599, XXXI); 1059, assent to giving restored church to abbey of Coulombs, signed by Henry king, Anna queen his wife (Reginae uxoris ejus), and Philip, son of the king (HGF, 11.604, XXXV); and a concession to St. Martin des Champs, which the king, queen, and son Philip with his brothers confirm with their signatures, \"Ego ipse Rex Henricus, et Regina pariter, et Philippus filius meus cum fratribus suis manufirmatam corroboravimus\" (HGF, 11.605-6, XXXVI).\n\nBut when Henry died in 1160, Anne participated in the government of her son, although Baldwin V of Flanders, married to Henrys sister, Adele, was technically regent. Baldwin described himself as \"procurator et bajulus regni\" but the bishop of Chartres speaks of Philip and Anne as his sovreigns (Prou, document VI, 1060). Philip declares that as a child he took up the kingdom together with his mother (\"ego, Philippus, filius ejus [Henrici] admodum parvulus, regnum unacum matre suscepissem,\" Prou, XIII, 1061). Anne signed various royal acts during Philips reign: see Prou, II, reconfirmation of a document of Henrys confirming a donation to a monastery St. Pere de Chartres,\"Philipus rex cum matre regina, hanc cartam firmavit\"; III, confirming consent to the donation of a church to the abbey of St Pere, \"Concessit autem hoc domnus meus rex Philipus, cum regina matre sua\"; IV, gift to the abbey of St. Denis at the request of his paternal aunt, Adele, and the intervention of his mother, \"per interventum matris mee A,\" who signed it; V, renunciation of certain royal rights over a monastery of St. Lucien de Beauvais, \"per interventum matris nostrae,\" with her signature; VI, confirmation of a charter to abbot of Marmoutier to build a church, with the advice and will also of our most pious royal lords, \"dominorum nostrorum piisimorum regum, Philippi scilicet et matris ejus, Agnetis\"; X, donation to St. Nicaise of Reims, with the counsel of our beloved mother \"consilioque dilectissime matris nostre Anne\"; XI, grants exemption to basilica of St. Adrieu in the presence of the queen \"Interfuerunt autem etiam huic adstipulationi Agnes regina, \"; XVI, concession to abbey of St. Crepin, which is signed apparently by Annes hand in Cyrillic, Anna queen; XVIII, confirming a gift to the abbey of St. Benoit-sur-Loire, signed Anna regina; XIX, confirmation of his fathers gift to St. Martin-des-Champs, with the good-will of his mother and count Baldwin, \"favente matre atque comite Balduino\"; XXXII, confirmation of renunciation of certain customs, signed Anna regina; according certain freedoms extended to other royal churches to a church restored by his mother, at her request, \"mater mea, nomine Anna, divina inspirante\"; LXXV, confirms the charter founding the monastery of Pontlevoy, signed Anne, matris Philippi regis. Documents II-VI are dated 1060, X, XI, 1061, XVI, 1063; XVIII, XIX,1065, XXXII, 1067, XLIII, 1069, LXXV, 1075. When Anne signs, it is either the first signature listed, or the first following the kings (in XXXII, several bishops precede the signatures of the king and the queen). There is also a confirmation by Henry of a donation to St. Peter of Chartres, dated 1059, which Philip and his mother signed in 1062, after Henrys death, \"Post mortem autem Henrici Regis, secundo anno regni sui Philippus Rex cum Regina matre sua manu propria firmavit\" (HGF, 11.602-4, XXXIV). Hallu lists 23 acts of Philip's which mention Anne or carry her signature, four of them probably after her death, 185ff.\n\nIn 1061, Anne remarried, a powerful ally of the king, Raoul, count of Crepy and Valois, the Vexin, Amiens, Bar-sur-Aube, Vitry, Peronne, and Montdidier, who repudiated his wife, accusing her of adultery, to marry Anne. But the wife, Eleanor of Champagne, appealed to the pope; Alexander II responded to her complaint, asking the archbishop of Reims to investigate, try to save the marriage or take appropriate steps. Raoul refused to take her back and was excommunicated. Nonetheless, he remains an important royal ally, signing some of Philips acts. Raoul died in 1074 and Anne returned to Philips court. There is one document of Raouls which Anne signed along with Raouls son, mentioned in HGF 11.433, dated 1069, a concession to a castle.\n\nI, Anne, by the grace of God queen of the Franks, wish to make known to our faithful and our relations the pact and agreement which we had between myself and abbot R. and the monks of the monastery of St. Peter of the Fosse, about a certain land located in the county of Melun, which they call Verneuil. Said abbot and monks gave me the land so that I might cultivate, plant, and build on it as best I could during my life, hold it and possess it according to my will while I live , but after my death, it would return to the monks and the church with all the building and improvements, namely with the oxen and other animals and herds and all the fruits. Which agreement, that it might be held more stable and fixed, we presented it to my son Philip, king of the Franks, to be confirmed and witnessed. He had this charter confirmed by his own hand and signed and imprinted with his seal.\n\nPresent at this agreement were F., bishop of Senlis, Baldwin chancellor, Rudolph, seneschal of the king, Baldric constable, Ingenulf, butler, Amaury, seneschal of the queen, Oscelin, marshal, and several other clerics and laymen.\n\nWikipedia shows-\n\nAnne of Kiev (or Anna Yaroslavna) (between 1024 and 1032-1075) was the queen consort of France as the wife of Henry I, and regent for her son Philip I.\n\nHer parents were Yaroslav I the Wise and princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, Matilda of Frisia, King Henry searched the courts of Europe for a suitable bride, but could not locate a princess who was not related to him within legal degrees of kinship. At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, which returned with Anne (also called Agnes). Anne and Henry were married at the cathedral of Reims on 19 May 1051.\n\nThe new queen consort was not instantly attracted to her new realm. She wrote to her father that Francia was \"a barbarous country where the houses are gloomy, the churches ugly and the customs revolting.\"\n\nAnne is credited with bringing the name Philip to Western Europe. She imported this Greek name (Philippos, from philos and hippos, meaning \"loves horses\") from her Eastern Orthodox culture.\n\nFor six years after Henry's death in 1060, she served as regent for Philip, who was only eight at the time. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent. Her co-regent was Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Anne was a literate woman, rare for the time, but there was some opposition to her as regent on the grounds that her mastery of French was less than fluent."
