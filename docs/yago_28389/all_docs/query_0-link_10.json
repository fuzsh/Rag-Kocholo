        "text": "Daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, Prince of Kyiv, and his second wife Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden, Anna Yaroslavna has been more commonly honoured by history as Anne of Kyiv, the princess of Kyivan Rus who became the Queen of France in 1051 after marrying King Henry I. The youngest of Yaroslav’s daughters, Anna’s life as French royalty is most chronicled by European sources, with few mentions of the princess found in writings from the period of the Kyivan Rus. In this special material, we look closely at the life and legacy of Anna Yaroslavna as an example of ancient diplomacy as part of our series on Ukraine’s global connections.\n\nGrowing up in the Kyivan Rus and marrying Henry I\n\nAnna Yaroslavna’s exact birthdate is unknown – it is estimated she was born between 1027 and 1032. While little is known about her upbringing and youth, it is assumed with a near certainty that she was the youngest of Yaroslav the Wise’s daughters and was literate. Because education was highly valued by Yaroslav, who founded many schools and educational initiatives in the Kyivan Rus, historians believe Anne would have been highly educated. She was born at a time when Kyiv was a bustling metropolis where book publishing and translation were an important part of state affairs, and the royal court hosted many a literary and musical evenings, with performances by poets and musicians. Besides knowing her mother’s native Swedish and Old East Slavic, Anne is thought to have known Ancient Latin, Greek, and French.\n\nFrench King Henry I sought out Anne’s hand in marriage when she was 18 years old, twice his junior, following the death of his first wife Matilda of Frisia. With no heir and no unrelated to Henry princess left in the kingdom, the king began his search for a bride outside France. Due to Yaroslav the Wise’s “marriage diplomacy,” through which he had married off several of his children to Western rulers in order to establish distance between the Kyivan Rus and the Byzantine Empire, the ancient Ukrainian state was not unknown in Europe. At the same time, King Henry I was in conflict with the Holy Roman Empire, making political alliance with the Kyivan Rus all the more a favourable option for the French kingdom.\n\nAs such, Henry sent several advisors to Yaroslav’s court in the late 1040s with a proposal for a union with Anne of Kyiv. The princess left Kyiv in 1050 and traveled to Reims, where she married Henry on May 19, 1051. Anne was crowned in the immediate aftermath, making her the first French queen to celebrate her coronation in the Reims Cathedral.\n\nAnna’s legacy in the history of French royalty\n\nDuring their nine-year-long marriage, Anne and Henry had three songs: Philip, Robert (who died young), and Hugh. The pair are also thought to have had a daughter, Emma, and are at times references as the parents of the beatified figure Edigna. Anne is said to have introduced the name “Philip” to the Western European royalty; the name’s Greek origins lead some to believe she may have borrowed it from her Eastern Orthodox roots. There are records of Henry citing Anne’s approval in his own granting of privileges to villages associated with the Saint-Maur-des-Fossés monastery in 1058. The following year, Henry began a feud with the Church on matters concerning the Gregorian Reform. As it went on, Pope Nicholas II sent Anne a letter where he praised her values and the upbringing of her children, while calling on her to advocate with her husband to govern with moderation. The letter is cited by some historians as proof of Anne’s potential conversion from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism, though the claims have never been substantiated.\n\nAfter Henry’s passing on Aug. 4, 1060, Anne’s son Philip ascended to the throne. Still young, he was assigned Count Baldwin V of Flanders as his regent. Anne is thought to still have had an active role in government as indicated by the appearance of her name following Philip’s in an act from 1060 and in four times as many charters as Baldwin’s.\n\nIt is from this period of time that Anne’s only existing signature has been acquired, found inscribed on a document issued at Soissons in 1063 for the abbot of Saint Crepin le Grand. The signature is written in Old East Slavic, transliterated as “Ana Reina,” which is interpreted as being a Cyrillic transliteration of the Latin “Anna Regina” with the second word likely being in accordance with the Old French spelling of the word reine (“queen”). The “Queen Anne” signature is believed by some to be the oldest example of Old Ukrainian writing. Today, the document is stored at the National Library of France.\n\nLast known stages of life and contemporary remembrance\n\nIn 1061, Anna Yaroslavna remarried with Count Ralph IV of Valois as her second husband. The marriage was deemed controversial and received criticism, because of Henry’s past rivalry with Ralph, and also because of it constituting bigamy, as Ralph was still married to his second wife, Haquenez. As a result of these transgressions, Ralph was excommunicated. In 1062, Anne became the patron of a chapel in Senlis dedicated to Saint Vincent of Saragossa after donating a generous amount of money for its restoration and bequeathing lands and income to the ecclesiastic institution, ensuring its sustained existence. The chapel exists to this day, with a monument honouring Anne with an inscription reading “Anne of Kyiv, Queen of France” located at its premises. In 1074, Anne became a widow once again after the death of Count Ralph IV of Valois.\n\nThe date of her own death is unknown – but it is believed she died on Sept. 5, 1075. Anne remains one of the most known figures of Ukrainian history, her life honoured by monuments in several countries around the world and her legacy carried forward by several Ukrainian charity initiatives.\n\nText: Kvitka Perehinets"
