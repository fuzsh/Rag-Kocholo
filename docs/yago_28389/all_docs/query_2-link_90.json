These links have been being built over the centuries and significantly increased after Ukraine gained independence. France will further strengthen and develop these links for the sake of the united, free, and strong Ukraine,\" the French Ambassador to Ukraine stressed.\n\nThe monument was created by Kostiantyn Skrytutsky.\n\nol"
