        "text": "A huge thank you to Amy Utting for cleaning up and rewriting the profile of Anne of Kiev in both English and French, but to finalise some issues we need to decide if the daughter Emma should stay or be disconnnected?\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only primary source for a daughter Emma is one version of the Historia Francorum (see the *** in line 55) by Hugues de Fleury and she isn't mentioned in other chronicles of the period.\n\nWilliam of Jumieges, in his version of Gesta Normannorum Ducum does have an unnamed daughter of Henri I but gets other details incorrect (calls his wife Anne of Kiev, Matilda, and only names 2 sons, Philippe and Hugues, omitting son Robert).\n\nBoth the English and French Wikipedia versions for Henry I, have Emma as a child, but neither have a source and both have Emma's death in 1109, which I find difficult to believe given if she lived for that period of time we should expect to see her name in other primary sources.\n\nHenri I is supposed to have a daughter (unnamed) with his second wife, Matilda of Frisia who died aged 4, though again some of the sources differ, but if we decide that Emma should be disconnected from Henri and Anne of Kiev, we could add her as the daughter of Henri and Matilda?"
