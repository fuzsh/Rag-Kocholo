        "text": "JSC NC QazaqGaz and Chevron Munaigas Inc. have signed a cooperation agreement for natural gas exploration in the Aktobe region in western Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Chevron Corp. subsidiary will in the initial phase reprocess seismic data for the target area, which is near the already proven Urikhtau and Zhanazhol fields, Kazakhstan’s national gas company said in a statement.\n\n“The respective parties view the signed agreement as a potential starting point for more extensive collaboration”, QazaqGaz said.\n\nThe exploration campaign is also supported by Samruk-Kazyna JSC and the Central Asian country’s Energy Ministry, according to the statement.\n\nQazaqGas chair Sanzhar Zharkeshov said in the statement, “Further geological exploration and development of a potential gas condensate or oil and gas condensate field at the Zhalibek site is expected to enhance the commercial gas resource base and drive economic growth in the country”.\n\nZharkeshov added the agreement for gas exploration with the United States oil and gas giant signals an increasing attractiveness of Kazakhstan to international gas players.\n\n“Our strategic partnership with Kazakhstan has spanned more than three decades, and this agreement creates new opportunities for potentially advancing Kazakhstan's energy sector”, Chevron managing director for Eurasia Derek Magness commented. “Chevron recognizes the importance of gas development and related potential opportunities within Kazakhstan's gas industry\".\n\nIn 2022 Chevron Munaigas and QazaqGaz inked a memorandum of understanding for collaboration in hydrocarbon exploration and production, gas processing and energy transition.\n\nLast year Kazakhstan produced 30.8 billion cubic meters (1.1 trillion cubic feet) of gas, while its gas consumption stood at 21.4 Bcm (755.7 Bcf), according to the Energy Institute’s Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\nChevron is the first multinational to enter Kazakhstan, in 1993, according to the San Ramon, California-based integrated energy company.\n\nCurrently it holds a 50 percent stake in the Tengizchevroil joint venture, which develops the Tengiz field and the nearby Korolev field. Chevron estimates 25.5 billion barrels of oil in place in Tengiz and 1.6 billion barrels in Korolev. Chevron pegs recoverable oil from the two at 7.1 billion to 10.9 billion barrels. Tengizchevroil contributed 358,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to Chevron’s net production last year, according to the company’s supplemental report to its annual report for 2023.\n\nChevron also owns an 18 percent interest in the Karachaganak gas condensate field.\n\nDownstream, Chevron holds a 15 percent stake in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which operates a 1,505-kilometer (935.2 miles) conduit that carries petroleum from Tengiz and Karachaganak for export overseas, Chevron says on its website.\n\nChevron also owns the Atyrau Polyethylene Pipe Plant.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com"
