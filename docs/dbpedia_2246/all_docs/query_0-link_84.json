As a result, the country will produce 18 million tonnes of petroleum products per year.In order to ensure oil supplies to the plant, projects will be implemented to increase the capacity of Kenkiyak - Atyrau oil pipelines from 6 to 15 million tonnes per year and Kenkiyak – Kumkol pipelines - from 10 to 20 million tonnes per year, the press release says.Regarding the petrochemical industry the construction of the first integrated gas and chemical complex for producing polyethylene with a capacity of 1.25 million tonnes with an infrastructure project for gas separation with 9.1 billion cubic meters processing capacity will significantly increase the production volumes of petrochemical products, attract large investments and utilize the full potential of the Tengiz field raw materials.In addition, seven geological exploration and field development projects with a total investment volume of about 10 billion dollars are envisaged.The key projects are the construction and preparation for production at the Kalamkas-Sea and Khazar fields, the development of the Urikhtau gas condensate field, as well as the Karaton-Podsolevoy geological exploration project.According to Minister of National Economy Alibek Kuantyrov, Kazakhstan intends to increase oil production to 102 million tonnes per year in 2024-2028 by speeding up the development of Kashagan, Karachaganak and Tengiz fields.
