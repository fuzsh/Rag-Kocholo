        "text": "Following the successful implementation of the oil strategy, Azerbaijan began to define strategic objectives in relation to gas export policy. Currently, Azerbaijan is the only country in the region exporting gas to the international markets (Turkey, Russia, Georgia). For this reason, it is seen as \" the provider and participant \" of Southern Gas Corridor by EU. In this direction, Azerbaijan aims to be the country of an important and strategic natural gas exporter. From Shahdeniz field to the end European user, it targets to take part in the every ring of the value chain. These assumptions bring Azerbaijan to the position of a remarkable natural gas supplier for the export of large amount of gas to the European markets through Nabucco West. The implementation of the project with financial and technical capabilities of Azerbaijan and Turkey has made it a project to be realized between Turkey-Azerbaijan. TANAP means Turkey and Azerbaijan will emerge together in the European market for energy transportation. Along with Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum, TANAP has reinforced Turkey's position as a necessary energy corridor in delivering the energy resources of the Caspian Sea to the Western markets. In this paper, expected strategic and economic outcomes of TANAP are analyzed.\n\nThe Caspian Basin has been one of the most important geopolitical scenes since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The historical development of the basin in the last decade and a half provides us with some important clues about the dynamics of the new energy geopolitics. This article aims to examine geopolitical events that have occurred in connection with the hydrocarbon riches of the basin from a historical perspective. The focus of the article is mainly on the energy upstream and midstream projects developed between Turkey and the Caspian states, especially Azerbaijan. These significant events are investigated as part of nine “game” concepts. After examining these games thoroughly, the winners are listed according to their degrees with a discussion of results and possible conclusions.\n\nThe Caspian region is considered to be one of the next oil and gas frontiers. Along with the re-distribution of political power and the emergence of new balances after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the continuous waves of change also have had significant effects on the prospects for development of energy resources in the region. The objective of this study is to develop a model in order to understand and predict the outcome of the policies of the major actors (governments and companies) in the development and marketing of Caspian Sea energy resources. More specifically, the purpose is to identify the principal factors and their interactions in selecting export routes for the energy resources of the Caspian Basin. My hypothesis in this study is that political factors are dominant in the region. In the final analysis, the political process is more important than economics in determining which pipeline is to be built. The principal inputs to the development of the model will be detailed analyses of; (1) the development of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline project, and (2) the determination of the export route for Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan offshore oil field. Such a predictive model can then be applied to other countries in the region, or other similar resource-rich regions of the world. After studying the developments leading to BTC’s success, the promising oil and gas developments in Kazakhstan shall be examined. How will the Kashagan oil field be developed? What alternatives are available to the Kazakh government other than the Russian oil pipeline network? With regard to this question, I put forward the most likely outcome. My methodology will modify Bruce Bueno de Mesquita’s (BDM) model of predicting political events in an attempt to find an answer to the abovementioned central question. Applicability of the BDM model will be tested in the context of energy development, which is different from the original and traditional fields of application for this model.\n\nThe Southern Gas Corridor is a system of three complementary gas pipeline projects controlled by Azerbaijan and Turkey, each at a different stage of implementation. The crisis in EU-Russia relations over Ukraine has made the two players interested in the Southern Gas Corridor once again. Brussels views it as an opportunity for a genuine diversification of gas supplies and a way to reinforce its position against Russia. In turn, Moscow’s proposal for Turkey and Greece to join the Turkish Stream gas pipeline project changes the energy map of the regional projects, which indirectly affects the Southern Gas Corridor. This has raised concern in Azerbaijan, which has been making efforts to manoeuvre between the interests of Moscow and Brussels.\n\nWhile political leaders continue to paint the corridor’s prospects after 2021-22 in very bright colours, the market dynamics – in the Caspian region itself, in the Caucasus and Turkey, and in Europe – are less promising. The commercial conditions for the southern corridor’s success have deteriorated as political support for it has grown. This paper argues that, up to 2030, the corridor will most likely remain an insubstantial contributor to Europe’s gas balance. It considers the potential sources of supply for the southern corridor (Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and others including Iran, Kurdistan, and the East Mediterranean); demand and transport issues in the Caucasus and Turkey that will influence the corridor’s future development; and the conditions under which southern corridor gas will compete with other supply in the European market."
