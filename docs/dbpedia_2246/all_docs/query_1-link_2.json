        "text": "In the Mugalzharsky district of the Aktobe region, the commissioning of the Eastern Urikhtau field took place on December 4, Kazinform reports.\n\nAs the official Telegram channel of the Samruk-Kazyna Foundation reported, the launch of the field will allow obtaining additional volumes of commercial and liquefied gas for the Aktobe region.\n\nAs part of the further development of the Eastern Urikhtau field, it is expected to drill 9 more wells, which will increase oil production to 200 thousand tons per year, and associated gas production to 100 million cubic meters per year.\n\nIn 2024, oil and gas production in Eastern Urikhtau is expected to amount to 89 thousand tons of oil and about 46 million cubic meters of gas.\n\nThe commissioning of the Eastern Urikhtau is a significant step towards the full-scale development of the Central Urikhtau field – a gas condensate field containing significant reserves of natural gas. Gas production in the amount of 1 billion cubic meters per year is planned here.\n\nBy the way, Urikhtau Operating LLP was one of the first in Kazakhstan to make the transition to industrial development of the field under the Improved Model Contract, which had a significant positive effect on the economics of the Urikhtau project, noted the Samruk-Kazyna Fund.\n\nThe East Urikhtau oil and gas field was discovered in 2015. Recoverable oil reserves are 4.7 million tons, dissolved gas reserves are 2.5 billion cubic meters. It refers to complex hydrocarbon production projects due to the high content of hydrogen sulfide in the product (3.5% or more)."
