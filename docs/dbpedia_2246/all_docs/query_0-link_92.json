This project is considered a part of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline, to which it connects in Shymkent. This project's importance is in that it connects several existing pipelines in Kazakhstan into a unified network, allowing gas to be delivered for the first time to the southern regions of the country (Central Asia-Center Gas Pipeline in the west, Bukhara-Ural Gas Pipeline in the center and the Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty Gas Pipeline in the south of Kazakhstan), as well for export to China via the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline. The pipeline is supplied by gas from the oil and gas fields in West Kazakhstan,[10] including Zhanazhol, Kenkiyak, and Urikhtau.[19]\n\nThe project started in January 18, 2011, when, on an equal share basis, Kazakh and Chinese companies KazTransGas JSC (rebranded to QazaqGaz in 2021)[7] and Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Ltd created the Beineu - Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP.[6] Construction started in September 2011 and the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent I pipeline was commissioned in November 2015.[19] Originally the pipeline had the operational capacity of 10 bcm/year.[19] In September 2020, construction of an additional (fourth) compressor station was finished, which allowed to increase pipeline capacity to 15 bcm/year.[1][20]\n\nIn February 2023, Minister of Energy of Kazakhstan Bolat Akchulakov suggested developing a feasibility study for construction of the second pipeline as the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent I pipeline was operating above its design capacity - at 106%. Reliability of gas supply of southern Kazakhstan with its growing population is also dependent on the construction of the additional segment of the pipeline.[21] In June 2023, Samruk Kazyna and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) discussed participation of CNPC in the project. An agreement was reached to establish a joint task force, develop a feasibility study by December 31, 2023 and identify preliminary sources of financing.[22] In July 2023, QazaqGaz, CNPC, PetroChina International и TapLine discussed further implementation of the project.[22] As of August 2023, the pipeline is expected to be built by the end of 2026.[23] Based on research, it appears that Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent I and Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent II will run parallel to each other.\n\nIn February 2024, the feasibility study for the construction of the second stage of the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent pipeline was still being developed and was expected to be completed in Q2 2024. The estimated completion date for the construction is the end of 2026.[15][16]\n\nIn February 2024, it was reported that an agreement had been signed with Qatari investors, specifically with Power International Holding, to jointly implement the project.[17] In May 2024, the terms of the deal with Qatar, including for implementation of three other joint gas projects, were approved at a government meeting. According to the agreement, Qatari UCC Holding (a subsidiary of Power International Holding) will build two gas processing plants, a new compressor station KS-14, the main gas pipeline KS-14 - Kostanay - Aktobe, and the second line of the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent pipeline. QazaqGaz and UCC Holding reached a consensus on all four projects. Their joint implementation is expected to begin in the near future.[18]\n\nCapacity expansion\n\nThe Roadmap for Development of Gas Infrastructure of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2015-2030 released in September 2023 mentions that the initial capacity of the new segment will be up to 10 bcm/year in the first stage. The transit capacity of the pipeline will be increased to 15 bcm/year through the construction of compressor stations.[11]\n\nFinancing\n\nThe project is operated by Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP, which is a 50/50 percent joint venture between QazaqGaz JSC and Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Limited Company.[4] KazTransGas JSC was a subsidiary of JSC NC KazMunayGas, the state-owned oil and gas company of Kazakhstan.[24] Rebranded, QazaqGaz is a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna SWF JSC.[8] Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Ltd. is a subsidiary of China Reform Holdings Corp.[25][9] In 2015, KazTransGas JSC has signed a loan agreement with China Development Bank Corporation and Bank of China for a sum of USD $2.5 billion for a period until 2028 to finance the construction of the pipeline.[8]\n\nOpposition\n\nThe workers of Zhanazhol and Kenkiyak oil and gas fields went on a strike in November 2021 to demand a salary increase in front of the offices of CNPC-AMG (СНПС - АктобеМунайГаз) and CNPC - Aktobe Transport Company (СНПС - Актюбинская транспортная компания).[26]\n\nArticles and resources"
