        "text": "The state company of Kazakhstan, \"KazMunayGas,\" plans to increase natural gas production to 6.7 billion cubic meters per year by 2030 by launching new deposits, Vlast.kz reports.\n\n\"KazMunayGas is developing a gas strategy within which it plans to increase natural gas production to 6.7 billion cubic meters per year by 2030 (excluding major projects such as Tengiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan),\" the statement says.\n\nIn 2024, the operation of three new fields started: Aksai South, East Urikhtau, and Rozhkovskoye. In the next 3-4 years, production is planned to commence at the Central Urikhtau field, which is expected to yield around 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year. In 2027, the West Proval and Kalamkas fields are scheduled to start production, with an anticipated gas extraction volume of 1.1 billion cubic meters per year.\n\nAdditionally, 12 promising geological exploration projects and projects for further exploration of existing fields are being developed jointly with international companies.\n\nCentralasianLIGHT.org\n\nJanuary 5, 2024"
