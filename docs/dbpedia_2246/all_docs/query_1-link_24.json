        "text": "China National Petroleum Corporation and Kazakhstan's state-run oil andgas company KazMunaiGaz has signed an in-principle agreement to jointlydevelop the Urikhtau natural gas field in the Central Asian nation, theChinese company said in a report Wednesday.\n\nThe agreement was signed during a three-day visit from February 21 led byKazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, CNPC said in the report carriedby the company newsletter China Petrochemical Daily.\n\nAccording to the report, state-owned CNPC and KazMunaiGaz will hold 50:50interest in a joint venture to explore and develop the gas field.\n\nLocated near Kenkiyak in the Aktyubinsk region of western Kazakhstan, theUrikhtau gas field was tapped during the Soviet era, but has not beendeveloped since Kazakh independence.\n\nAccording to earlier estimates by KazMunaiGaz, Urikhtau's reserves standat around 40 billion cubic meters, and the field has an estimated potential toproduce 1.5-2 Bcm/year.\n\nThe field's gas output is expected to be one of the sources forKazakhstan's Beineu-Shymkent pipeline, which is a 1,500 km pipeline linkingseveral existing trunk lines in Central Asia, including the Center,Bukhara-Ural, BGR-TBA and Kazakhstan-China pipelines.\n\nConstruction of the pipeline started in late December and is expected tobe completed by 2012.\n\nThe 10 Bcm/year pipeline is the second phase of the Kazakhstan-China gaspipeline and will go from near the Caspian Sea to a linkup with the firstphase of the pipeline in south-central Kazakhstan.\n\nThe first phase, which brings gas from Turkmenistan to China viaKazakhstan, was launched in December 2010 with a capacity of 30 Bcm/year andmay be increased to 40 Bcm/year.\n\n--Calvin Lee, calvin_lee@platts.com"
