        "text": "The Namibian sector of the Orange Basin continues to see exploration success. TotalEnergies and partners Impact Oil & Gas and QatarEnergy reportedly found hydrocarbons at two stratigraphic levels within the Cretaceous at the Mangetti-1 well (potentially in the Lower and Upper Cretaceous). Galp and partners Sintana Energy Inc. (TSXV: SEI) (OTCQB: SEUSF) also recently announced the presence of hydrocarbon pay at two levels within the Mopane-1X well. They plan to drill a follow-on prospect at Mopane-2X in the near future. Pancontinental Energy NL and Woodside Energy recently received the final 3D seismic survey used to assess the Saturn Superfan immediately to the North of the discovery. Woodside Energy has around 6 months to decide whether to proceed. Shell are also continuing assessing the viability of the Graff prospect and adjacent discoveries with the acquisition of a new 3D seismic survey. NAMCOR NAMIBIA has varying equity in these and surrounding licenses. I updated the map compilation I made last year using the Uber Kepler.gl platform to make a fairway map of the Cretaceous fairway systems in the Orange Basin. Hexbin plots are potentially useful ways to display thickness information, in this case Upper Cretaceous thickness (km) from Baby et al., 2018. While some of the recent tests, including Shell Cullinan prospect, are interpreted to be carbonates, and the Kudu Field terrestrial clastics, many of the prospects defined in this region are Lower and Upper Cretaceous turbidite sandstones fed from the ancestral Orange River, through a potentially influenced terraced slope relating to the early break up, and subsequent rifting, of the Southern Atlantic. These prospects appear to sit at major thickness changes, which could reflect changes in accommodation during deposition of the turbidites. Hopefully we will see further activity in this region, especially pushing the limits of the Cretaceous Turbidite Plays. All information is from public sources. Field of view approx. 250 miles. North to the left.

It is organized by geologic themes and is meant to be a quick go to reference for E&P folks, researchers and academia. This part is a simple compilation of Regional OG resource and Indicative Exploration Potential around the World. Note that basin creaming curves are only good until some bright spark comes up with a new play. The business of YTF estimation can also be quite subjective and at best is a ‚Äúguess-timate‚Äù. #OilGasExploration #GlobalAtlas #Resource #YTF #ExplPotential #Oil #Gas #Geology\n\n\"The South Atlantic Connection: Analogies between Southern African Discoveries and the Argentina-Uruguay Margin\" üìÖ Save the Date: Upcoming Webinar on January 30, 2024, 9:00 AM CT Join us for an insightful webinar exploring the remarkable similarities between recent deep-water discoveries in Southern Africa and the South Atlantic region. TotalEnergies, Shell, and other companies have uncovered significant oil and gas reserves in Namibia's Orange Basin, marking a new era in exploration. With an estimated 11 billion barrels of light oil and 8.7 trillion cubic feet of gas, these findings spotlight a promising Cretaceous turbidite play. The webinar will delve into the geological parallels between the Southern African Margin and its conjugate in Southern America. We'll discuss the latest leasing activities offshore Uruguay and Argentina, highlighting key prospects and upcoming explorations. üéôÔ∏è Speaker: Oscar Lopez-Gamundi Over 35 years of experience in geology and exploration. Extensive background in Latin America and West Africa. Held positions at Texaco, Chevron, Hess Corporation, and other prestigious organizations. Founder of @P1Consultants. üîç Learn about: The potential extension of the Cretaceous turbidite play. Comparative analysis of the Namibian discoveries and their Southern American counterparts. #IAPGH #Webinar #OilAndGas #Exploration #Geology #SouthAtlantic #EnergyIndustry\n\nGlobal Atlas 13: Some Recent OG Discoveries (musings from the desk of a retired geologist) The multi part Global Atlas is a compilation of public domain information on major basins around the world. It is organized by geologic themes and is meant to be a quick go to reference for E&P folks, researchers and academia. This is a simple compilation of some observations and some examples of recent OG Exploration successes. The value of high impact exploration in a company‚Äôs portfolio cannot be understated as you can see from some of the huge value creation associated with significant discoveries. #OilGasExploration #GlobalAtlas #OilDiscoveries #GasDiscoveries #Oil #Gas #Geology\n\nThis week's series of posts is on Geothermal Electricity projects, this one on energy from a Volcanic Island Arc Geothermal System. Potential hydrothermal reservoirs are typically an initial exploration target, but the local geology on this island required further geophysical work (e.g., 3D magnetotellurics) and shallow boreholes to investigate this possibility. Deeper reservoirs would be the next exploration target and deeper boreholes would be required to measure geothermal gradients and identify any potential upflow zones. Good heat and heat pathways were likely given the seismic data performed so far combined with the volcanic history. If a local government, asset holder, regional company, or multi-lateral is interested, we are happy to provide such an evaluation, including potential exploration plans and development scenarios based on a review of local data and geology.
