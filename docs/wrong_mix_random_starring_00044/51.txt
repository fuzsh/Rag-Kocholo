Classic Celebrity Quote

"Megan loved looking at women's bodies. She just had no inhibitions and made no bones about the fact she liked to fantasise about being with a woman. There were many times she would look at magazines for hours pointing out which actresses she thought were hot. Angelina Jolie was high up on her list. She would say, 'Look at her body, Ben, it's gorgeous, don't you think?' She just loved women who were not conventionally pretty and looked like they were into anything. Because that's what Megan was like. Back then she never said she actually wanted to have sex with a girl but I knew it was one of her fantasies because she told me. So I am not in the slightest bit shocked one of the first people she slept with after I had ended our relationship was a woman. It doesn't upset me though, it just makes me realise I was right, she was too wild for me."
