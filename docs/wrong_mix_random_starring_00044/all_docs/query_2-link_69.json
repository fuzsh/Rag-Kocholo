        "text": "Jodhpur, India – A scuffle between journalists and security guards marred the Indian wedding of Elizabeth Hurley and Arun Nayar, prompting local authorities to deploy extra police to the airport in Jodhpur for the celebrity couple’s departure.\n\nThe 41-year-old British actress-model and Nayar, a 42-year-old Indian businessman, were married Friday in a traditional Hindu ceremony at a palace-turned-hotel in the western Indian city of Jodhpur. It was their second wedding in a week. The couple were first wed in a private civil ceremony in a castle outside London.\n\nThe fight began outside Mehrangarh fort, the venue for a dinner, after a television reporter was slapped by a security guard as journalists tried to chase the celebrity couple’s car.\n\nAngry journalists then broke through one of the security cordons, setting off a fist fight with the security guards that lasted nearly an hour. No major injuries were reported.\n\nHurley appeared in the “Austin Powers” and “Bedazzled” films, and for several years was the international face of Estee Lauder cosmetics. Her 4-year-old son, Damian, accompanied the couple on their trip to India."
