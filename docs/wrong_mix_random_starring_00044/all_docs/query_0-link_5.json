        "text": "Introduction\n\nFunctional impairment is a key consequence of major depressive disorder (MDD).1, Reference IsHak, James and Mirocha2 Multiple domains of functioning are typically impaired in patients with MDD, particularly their ability to work and work productivity.Reference Beck, Crain and Solberg3–Reference Uribe, Pinto, Vecino-Ortiz, Gómez-Restrepo and Rondón7 Depression has a considerable impact in the workplace worldwide.Reference Evans-Lacko and Knapp8 Of ∼1.3 million Canadians aged 15–65 years who experienced a depressive episode in 2012, over 1 million were employed.Reference Stonebridge and Sutherland9 Of these, only 17% were reported to be fully functioning at work; 23% were unable to work due to their depression, 20% worked part-time due to their depression, and 40% worked full-time but with reduced functioning.\n\nThe Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines for the management of MDD state that recovery from depression involves both relief of symptoms and improvement of functioning.Reference Lam, McIntosh and Wang10 MDD is a multidimensional disease characterized by emotional, physical, and cognitive symptoms, all of which may require assessment and treatment to achieve functional recovery.Reference Lam, McIntosh and Wang10–Reference Sheehan, Nakagome, Asami, Pappadoulous and Boucher14 Systematic reviews have shown that improvement in mood symptoms is only modestly correlated with functional outcomes in MDD.Reference McIntyre, Lee and Mansur13, Reference Buist-Bouwman, Ormel and de Graaf15–Reference Iosifescu17 Functional impairment can persist in patients with MDD even after remission of mood symptoms,Reference IsHak, James and Mirocha2, Reference Kennedy, Foy, Sherazi, McDonough and McKeon18, Reference Trivedi, Morris and Wisniewski19 and residual functional impairment has been associated with an increased risk of relapse and recurrence of depression.Reference Solomon, Leon and Endicott20, Reference Hardeveld, Spijker, De Graaf, Nolen and Beekman21\n\nThe clinical relevance of cognitive symptoms, including disturbances in attention, memory, processing speed, and executive functioning, and their role in work-related disability is well documented in MDD.Reference Lee, Hermens, Porter and Redoblado-Hodge16, Reference Hasselbalch, Knorr and Kessing22–Reference Knight and Baune27 Compared with depression severity, cognitive symptoms have been reported to account for greater impairment in workplace functioning in patients with MDD.Reference McIntyre, Soczynska and Woldeyohannes28 Treatment of cognitive symptoms may hold the key to achieving functional recovery in MDD; however, the relationship between cognitive symptoms and functional impairment in MDD is not well understood.\n\nVortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant approved for the treatment of MDD in adults, which acts as an inhibitor of the serotonin transporter as well as modulating the activity of multiple serotonin receptor subtypes.Reference Garnock-Jones29, Reference Sanchez, Asin and Artigas30 Vortioxetine has been shown to be effective not only for the treatment of MDD,Reference Thase, Mahableshwarkar, Dragheim, Loft and Vieta31, Reference Vieta, Loft and Florea32 but also to improve cognitive symptoms in patients with depression.Reference McIntyre, Lophaven and Olsen33–Reference Baune, Sluth and Olsen38 A recent meta-analysis showed that vortioxetine also demonstrates efficacy in improving overall functioning and functional remission, as assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), in adults with MDD.Reference Florea, Loft and Danchenko39\n\nAssessment in Work productivity and the Relationship with Cognitive symptoms (AtWoRC) is an interventional, open-label, real-world study undertaken to examine the association between cognitive symptoms and workplace productivity in working Canadian patients with MDD treated with vortioxetine. The primary analysis of this study showed a statistically significant association between improvements in cognitive symptoms in patients with MDD and workplace productivity after 12 weeks of vortioxetine treatment.Reference Chokka, Bougie, Rampakakis and Proulx40 Patients with MDD generally require long-term treatment; current CANMAT guidelines recommend antidepressant treatment continuing for at least 6 months after achieving symptomatic remission and for 2 years or longer in patients with risk factors for recurrence.Reference Lam, McIntosh and Wang10 However, only limited data are available concerning the long-term real-world effectiveness of antidepressants. This article presents the analysis of the AtWoRC study after 52 weeks of vortioxetine treatment in clinical practice, together with structural equations model (SEM) analyses undertaken to further assess causal relationships between long-term changes in measures of cognition and functioning in working patients with MDD.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the long-term effects of antidepressant therapy on cognition and functioning in working patients with MDD in a real-world setting. Patient demographic and disease characteristics at baseline were as expected for the general population presenting with MDD likely to be treated with antidepressants, supporting generalization of the study findings. Gainfully employed patients with MDD receiving vortioxetine in a real-life setting demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in mood, cognitive, and functional outcomes after continuous long-term treatment for up to 52 weeks. Work productivity improved over the 52 weeks of treatment by 8.9 percentage points on the WLQ productivity loss score, which ranges from 0 to 25% and assesses 4 dimensions of work productivity (time-management, physical demands, mental-interpersonal demands, and output demands).Reference Lerner, Amick, Rogers, Malspeis, Bungay and Cynn44\n\nThe highly significant association between improvements in cognitive symptoms (assessed using the PDQ-D-20) and workplace productivity loss previously reported after 12 weeks of vortioxetine treatment persisted at 52 weeks.Reference Chokka, Bougie, Rampakakis and Proulx40 These findings are in keeping with the results of a study in South Korea, in which MDD patients with greater severity of cognitive symptoms assessed by the PDQ-D-20 reported worse functional and work-related productivity outcomes, irrespective of depression severity.Reference Kim, Chalem, di Nicola, Hong, Won and Milea45 In a European study in patients with MDD who were either initiating or undergoing their first switch of antidepressant monotherapy (PERFORM), patient-reported cognitive symptoms (assessed using the shorter 5-item Perceived Deficit Questionnaire) were found to be independently associated with functional impairment, reduced work productivity, and lower quality of life throughout 2 years of follow-up.Reference Hammer-Helmich, Haro and Jönsson46, Reference Saragoussi, Christensen, Hammer-Helmich, Rive, Touya and Haro47\n\nSEM analyses indicated that improvements in patient-rated cognitive symptoms preceded long-term improvements in functioning outcomes, and that cognitive symptoms at weeks 12 and 26 significantly predicted functioning at the subsequent visits, even when adjusting for improvement in depressive symptoms (QIDS-SR). In the European PERFORM study, similar SEM analyses showed patient-reported cognitive symptoms to be an important determinant of both subsequent functional impairment and depression severity throughout 2 years of follow-up in patients with MDD who were either initiating or undergoing their first switch of antidepressant monotherapy.Reference Larsen, Haro, Saragoussi and Hammer-Helmich43 The present study found subjectively rated cognitive symptoms (PDQ-D-20) to be a stronger predictor than objective cognitive performance (DSST) of subsequent functioning outcomes, suggesting that PDQ-D-20 and DSST provide distinct assessments of cognitive function. Other studies have also found discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of cognition in patients with MDD.Reference Lam, Iverson and Evans48–Reference Fava, Mahableshwarkar and Jacobson51 Collectively, such findings suggest that improvements in cognitive symptoms in patients with MDD may increase workplace productivity.\n\nThe significant improvements in both self-reported cognitive symptoms and cognitive performance assessed by the DSST seen in this study are consistent with results of previous studies of vortioxetine and reinforce these findings in a real-life setting.Reference McIntyre, Lophaven and Olsen33–Reference Baune, Sluth and Olsen38 The significant improvements in work productivity seen in the present study during treatment with vortioxetine are consistent with the findings of the Combined Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes (CO-MED) trial, which demonstrated that work productivity outcomes improve significantly with antidepressant treatment and that early changes in work productivity are significant predictors of long-term clinical course.Reference Jha, Minhajuddin, Greer, Carmody, Rush and Trivedi52\n\nIn contrast to the results of the European PERFORM study,Reference Larsen, Haro, Saragoussi and Hammer-Helmich43 patient-rated depression severity (QIDS-SR) scores were not found to significantly predict functioning outcomes (SDS or WLQ) when simultaneously adjusting for improvements in cognitive symptom severity (PDQ-D-20 score) at any subsequent timepoint in the current SEM analyses. A reason for this result may be difference in sample sizes between the 2 studies. In the present study, unadjusted Pearson correlation coefficients did show significant associations between changes from baseline to week 52 for QIDS-SR scores and functioning outcomes (SDS and WLQ) as well as cognitive symptom severity (PDQ-D-20 score).\n\nDepression and anxiety are frequently comorbid, with around 50% of patients with MDD also suffering from clinically significant levels of anxiety symptoms.Reference Fava, Rush and Alpert53 Anxiety has been shown to contribute to increased rates of suicide, poor response to treatment, and increased risk of chronicity and recurrence in patients with depression.Reference Seo, Jung and Kim54, Reference Gaspersz, Nawijn, Lamers and Penninx55 Significant improvement in the severity of anxiety symptoms was seen over the 52 weeks of vortioxetine treatment in the present study, from “severe” anxiety at baseline to “mild” at weeks 12 and 52. A highly significant correlation between anxiety symptoms and workplace productivity was also observed at weeks 12 and 52, highlighting a need for routine assessment and management of anxiety in patients with MDD for optimum outcomes.\n\nHigh rates of treatment response and remission were seen after 52 weeks of vortioxetine treatment in this study. Overall, 77% of patients responded to treatment, and 56% of patients achieved remission after 52 weeks of vortioxetine. These rates are in keeping with those reported in a recent pooled analysis of data from 5 long-term, open-label extension studies of vortioxetine in patients with MDD.Reference Vieta, Loft and Florea32 In that analysis, response (defined as ≥50% improvement in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score) was achieved in 75% of patients at week 52 and remission (defined as MADRS total score ≤10) in 61%. The high rate of remission achieved in switch patients in the present study is particularly noteworthy, as these patients had a statistically significantly longer duration of MDD than those receiving vortioxetine as first treatment for the current depressive episode (11.0 versus 5.6 years, respectively). The remission rate of 67% seen in switch patients after 52 weeks of vortioxetine treatment in this study is high when considered in context of the second-line remission rates reported by the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) studyReference Rush, Trivedi and Wisniewski56; in both real-world studies, remission was defined as QIDS-SR total score ≤5. However, the high response and remission rates seen in patients switching to vortioxetine after inadequate response to a previous antidepressant in this real-world study are similar to those reported in previous randomized controlled studies of vortioxetine.Reference Thase, Mahableshwarkar, Dragheim, Loft and Vieta31, Reference Montgomery, Nielsen, Poulsen and Häggström57\n\nVortioxetine was well tolerated in this patient population. Safety and tolerability were consistent with previous reports of the short- and long-term tolerability of vortioxetine, Reference Baldwin, Chrones and Florea58 and with the data reported in the Canadian product monograph for vortioxetine (Trintellix).59 Common AEs included nausea, headache, and insomnia, and few patients discontinued the study due to AEs. The overall discontinuation rate of 45% is not unexpected for a long-term study, and few patients discontinued due to AEs (7.3%). This is similar to the overall discontinuation rate of 43% and a discontinuation rate due to AEs of 7.8% reported after 52 weeks of treatment with vortioxetine in a recent pooled analysis of data from 5 long-term, open-label extension studies.Reference Vieta, Loft and Florea32 Almost half of all patients who discontinued the AtWoRC study withdrew consent; as patients in this study were gainfully employed, it seems reasonable to assume that the need for regular study assessments over the 52 weeks of follow-up may have become burdensome.\n\nA major strength of this study is that it was performed in a real-world setting with long-term follow-up. In addition, patient-reported outcome measures were used to assess disease severity and impact from the patient’s own perspective. Use of patient-reported outcomes is in keeping with the general move toward increased patient involvement in treatment decisions, and awareness of the limitations of clinical symptom-based measures in assessing recovery from mental illness in a way that is meaningful to patients.Reference Andresen, Caputi and Oades60–Reference Oliveira-Maia, Mendonça, Pessoa, Camacho and Gago63 Potential limitations include the open-label study design and the lack of a control group or active comparator; as such, the improvement observed was not controlled for any potential positive effect resulting from being included and assessed over time in the study. However, the AtWoRC study was undertaken primarily to assess the relationship between long-term changes in symptoms and workplace productivity in working patients with MDD treated with vortioxetine. The single-cohort study design was therefore appropriate, as the study was not designed to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of vortioxetine compared with other treatments."
