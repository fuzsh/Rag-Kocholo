Nayyar played Kalyan, a Nepalese student and roommate of the protagonist Ben, played by Eisenberg.[21] The production transferred to London's West End in 2016.\n\nNayyar published a book about his career journey, titled Yes, My Accent is Real: and Some Other Things I Haven’t Told You, in September 2015.[10]\n\nHe voiced another animated movie character named Guy Diamond in DreamWorks' Trolls, released in November 2016.\n\nIn 2020, Nayyar played a convicted serial killer named Sandeep on the Netflix UK production Criminal: UK.
