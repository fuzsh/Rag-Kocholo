        "text": "Liz Hurley and her husband Arun Nayar have separated, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe model and actress broke the news on Twitter in the wake of reports that she has been having an affair with Australian cricket legend Shane Warne.\n\nShe tweeted: \"Not a great day. For the record, my husband Arun & I separated a few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware of this.\"\n\nHurley, 45, who has an eight-year-old son, Damian, married Indian businessman Mr Nayar three years ago.\n\nMs Hurley and Mr Nayar married in a civil ceremony at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, in 2007 and held a blessing and party at the castle the following night. They then had traditional Indian wedding celebrations at the Mehrangarh fort in Jodhpur.\n\nThe News of the World said she spent two nights with Warne, 41, in his London hotel suite last week. She has been flirting with him for months via Twitter, it said.\n\nThe divorced former spin bowler flew into the UK on Wednesday to film interviews for his new TV show, Warnie. The pair were seen hugging and kissing passionately and spent Wednesday and Thursday night at his hotel in South Kensington, said the newspaper.\n\nUpon returning to Melbourne, Warne acknowledged on his website that his romance with ex-wife Simone Callahan, with whom he has three children, was off again after the failure of their latest attempted reconciliation."
