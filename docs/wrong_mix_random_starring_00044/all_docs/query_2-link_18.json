        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley married an Indian businessman in a private civil ceremony at a 15-century castle, and photographers and spectators descended Saturday on the quiet town of Winchcombe in western England to catch a glimpse of their lavish wedding party.\n\nGloucestershire County Council confirmed that Hurley and Arun Nayar married Friday at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London. The pair planned to hold a blessing and party at the castle later Saturday, with guests including Elton John, Kate Moss and Hurley's ex, Hugh Grant.\n\nPhotos: Elizabeth Hurley\n\nSecurity guards on Saturday patrolled the castle grounds, set amid the Cotswold hills of western England. A large tent had been erected in the grounds, and a covered walkway led from the gardens to the building.\n\nHurley, 41, and Nayar, 42, reportedly have signed a lucrative deal with Hello! magazine for exclusive rights to images of the event.\n\nSeveral shopfronts in the picturesque town were adorned with signs and notices wishing the couple good luck.\n\n\"Obviously, people are out celebrity spotting — I don't think they'll see any but they are out at the thought — and it's just a lot of excitement for the small town of Winchcombe,\" said butcher Colin Pilcher.\n\nAccording to reports, the couple will fly to India for celebrations in Mumbai and Rajasthan next week."
