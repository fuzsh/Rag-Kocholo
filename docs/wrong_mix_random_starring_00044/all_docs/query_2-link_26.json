        "text": "British model and actress Elizabeth Hurley and new Indian husband Arun Nayar set off a paparazzi frenzy yesterday as they arrived here for a week of festivities to end with a traditional wedding in a palace city.\n\nThe newlyweds walked hand-in-hand after landing at Mumbai's international airport for the second leg of celebrations.\n\nHurley and Nayar wed in a civil service Friday at Sudeley Castle in southwest England, followed by a lavish star-studded party at a country castle the next day.\n\nHurley in a laced white dress and Nayar, a businessman, sporting a blue shirt, jeans and a dark jacket, were accompanied by a bevy of bodyguards and airport security who struggled to keep frenzied news photographers at bay.\n\nThey drove off in a silver Bentley to Nayar's family home in south Mumbai.\n\nHurley, whose film credits include the first two Austin Powers movies and Bedazzled, will stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel.\n\nHurley, 41, and Nayar, 42, are set to fly off to the palace city of Jodhpur later this week for a traditional Indian wedding in the western desert state of Rajasthan."
