        "text": "Hurley, 45, submitted divorce papers at London's High Court as the Austin Powers actress carries on her high-profile romance with Aussie cricketer Shane Warne, London's Daily Mail reported.\n\nShe was first linked to the Aussie athlete in July and announced via Twitter in December that she had split from her husband.\n\n\"For the record, my husband Arun and I separated a few months ago. Our close family and friends were aware of this,\" she wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Nayar, 46, is reportedly romancing model Kim Johnson, who at 25 is 20 years younger than Hurley.\n\nIt was the first marriage for the actress, who recently returned to the UK after filming her role, of villainess Veronica Cale, for the upcoming reboot of the TV series Wonder Woman.\n\nShe was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Hugh Grant, and gained attention for standing by her man in 1995 when he was caught with a prostitute in Los Angeles. The two split in 2000 after 13 years together but remain friends.\n\nThe Estee Lauder spokeswoman also has a son, now aged nine, from her brief relationship with American financier Steve Bing."
