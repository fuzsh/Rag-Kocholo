        "text": "The model may now be seeing cricketer Shane Warne.\n\nExpress December 13, 2010\n\nForty five-year-old British model and actor Elizabeth Hurley announced on Twitter that she and her husband, Arun Nayar, have separated.\n\nThe news came after a report by the News of the World alleging an affair between Hurley and Australian cricketer Shane Warne. “Not a great day. For the record, my husband Arun and I separated a few months ago. Our close family and friends were aware of this,” Hurley posted on Twitter.\n\nWarne has also split up with his wife, Simone Callahan. “Sadly and unfortunately, Simone and I split up a while ago, our close friends and family were informed at that time. It is a private matter so we did not make it public. We remain friends and will continue to be good parents,” Warne said in a statement on his website.\n\nWarne and Callahan have three children together and had divorced some time ago but had rekindled their romance and shared a home together in his hometown of Melbourne.\n\nHurley and Warne reportedly met at an English race in July and last month the cricketer announced he would interview Hurley on his new Australian television chat show, called “Warnie”.\n\nHurley and her husband, Indian businessman Arun Nayar, began dating in 2003 and were wed in March 2007 with two lavish ceremonies set across the globe; with one taking place in a castle in England and the other, in a palace in Jodhpur where Nayar hails from.\n\nHurley and Nayar’s traditional Hindu ceremony featured Hurley wearing a pink sari and Nayar arriving astride a white horse.\n\nThe wedding celebrations were attended by Bollywood stars Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia, Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, musician Sivamani and even Nikolaos Pavlos, the crown prince of Greece.\n\nHowever, the wedding ceremony did have its share of problems with makeshift structures being torn down and a scuffle breaking out between journalists and a member of the couple’s security team.\n\nHurley had previously been involved with British actor Hugh Grant, who she dated for 13 years, and film producer Stephen Bing, with whom she has a son.\n\nFamous sporting couples\n\nImran Khan and Jemima Goldsmith\n\nMohsin Khan and Reena Roy\n\nDavid Beckham and Victoria Adams\n\nAshley Cole and Cheryl Tweedy\n\nTony Parker and Eva Longoria\n\nEric Johnson and Jessica Simpson\n\nMohammad Asif and Veena Malik\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, December 14th, 2010."
