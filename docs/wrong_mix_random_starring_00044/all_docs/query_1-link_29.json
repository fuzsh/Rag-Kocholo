        "text": "London: After British actress Elizabeth Hurley confirmed that she ended her marriage with Indian businessman Arun Nayar \"months ago\", her alleged new flame Australian cricketer Shane Warne too has clarified his relationship status.\n\nWhile both kept mum on their affair, Hurley and Warne used similar phrases to say that they are single. \"Not a great day. For the record, my husband Arun & I separated a few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware of this (sic),\" Hurley wrote on her twitter page on Sunday.\n\nThe cricket legend took to his official website today to clarify that he is no longer with wife Simone Callahan. \"Sadly and unfortunately, Simone and I split up a while ago, our close friends and family were informed at that time. It is a private matter so we did not make it public. We remain friends and will continue to be good parents.\" Their affair came to light after Hurley, 45, and Warne, 41, were photographed kissing and embracing at a hotel in London.\n\nNews of the World claimed to have a video and pictures of Hurley and Warne sharing a series of steamy clinches and claimed the actress had spent two nights with the cricketer, who is infamous for his womanising ways.\n\nWarne ended his marriage with Simone, with whom he has three children - Brooke, 13, Jackson, 11 and Summer, 8 - after a string of affairs. They divorced in 2007, but got back together in 2009 for a trial reunion, which did not work out.\n\nHurley, who has eight-year-old son Damion from a previous relationship, wed Nayar in an extravagant ceremony in India in 2007 and sold the pictures to magazines for millions. While gossip mills are abuzz with news of the new romance, their former spouses have refused to comment on the issue.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Nayar, 46, was spotted looking unhappy as he puffed a cigarette outside the couple's country home in Gloucestershire. Warne's ex-wife Simone said, \"I don't want to talk right now, thank you.\"\n\nTopics mentioned in this article\n\nCricket Shane Warne\n\nGet the Latest India tour of Sri Lanka, 2024 Updates, check out Paris Olympics 2024 News, Schedule and Results at NDTV Sports.
