        "text": "It was a blast from the past and a celebration of the future for Elizabeth Hurley and her son, Damian Hurley, on Wednesday night at the London screening of their film, Strictly Confidential.\n\nThe 58-year-old British actress stars in the drama, written and directed by her 22-year-old son. At the special screening, the mother-son duo were joined by several of Elizabeth's famous exes including Hugh Grant and ex-husband Arun Nayar.\n\nDamian posed with Hugh on the red carpet and the Notting Hill actor was later seen paling around with Elizabeth. Elizabeth snapped a pic with her former husband at the event and later shared photos and video from the screening, including footage of her exes.\n\n\"My favourite night of the year so far- the London screening of our movie Strictly Confidential, which was brimming over with family & friends,\" Elizabeth captioned the video on Instagram. \"Thank you to everyone who came and to the marvellous Everyman Chelsea for making the party go with a swing ü©∑ @strictlyconfidentialmovie coming to the UK on @primevideo @appletv @skytv on Monday May 13th ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑\"\n\nElizabeth and Hugh met on the set of the film Remando Al Viento in 1987. They split in 2000 after 13 years together. Hugh is also Damian's godfather.\n\nDamian's father is the late Steve Bing, who died in 2020.\n\nElizabeth began dating Arun in 2002 and they got married in 2007. Their divorce was finalized in 2011.\n\nDamian previously spoke with ET back in April about his personal inspiration for the film.\n\n\"I first came up with this idea when I was 17 after I lost a very close friend of mine to suicide, which was a really devastating time,\" Damian said. \"It was the first loss that me and most of my friends had ever known and the world fell apart and COVID happened and that idea got tucked into a little drawer. I made a short film over lockdown, which one of the head executives at Lionsgate saw and I got a call out of the blue saying that they wanted me to write and direct a feature for them, which is insane to hear.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nElizabeth Hurley Says She Used to Bicker With Ex Hugh Grant About Having Kids\n\nElizabeth Hurley Says She Bickered With Hugh Grant About Having Kids\n\nElizabeth Hurley Reacts to Theory She Took Prince Harry's Virginity"
