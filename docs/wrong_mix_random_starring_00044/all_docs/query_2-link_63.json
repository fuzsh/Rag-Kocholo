Her son Damian, 22, did however manage to grab a snap with the Love Actually star.\n\nHurley and Grant dated for 13 years, having met on the set of a Spanish production called Remando Al Viento in 1987.\n\nIn 1995, grant made headlines after being soliciting a sex worker, and five years later the pair split amicably. Despite their history, the ex-couple continue to be best friends, with Grant being Damian's godfather and Hurley being godmother to one of his daughters.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nEmma Stone and ex Kieran Culkin reunite in backstage moment\n\n\"We met on a movie 29 years ago, and he's still my best friend today and I still speak to him every day,\" she told Us Weekly in the past.\n\nGrant later went on to have five children – Tabitha Xiao Xi, 12, and Felix Chang Hong, 11, with ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong, and John Mungo, 11, as well as an 8-year-old and a 5-year-old whose names haven't been revealed, who he shares with wife Anna Eberstein.\n\nAfter her relationship with Grant, Hurley went on to meet American businessman Steve Bing in 2001, with whom she welcomed her son Damian. Bing denied paternity initially but it was later proved with DNA testing. He passed in 2020 at the age of 55.\n\nREAD MORE: The products a former beauty editor will buy again (and again)\n\nHurley then went on to meet UK businessman Nayar in 2002, wedding him in 2007. They lived together with her son on a farm in the UK countryside, before the star suddenly announced that they had been separated for months in a 2010 tweet, with the divorce being settled in 2011.\n\nThree months after that, she became engaged to Aussie cricketer Shane Warne , with the pair living together in Herefordshire. They split in December 2013, and Hurley later paid tribute to him after his death in 2022."
