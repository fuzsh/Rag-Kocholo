They followed up the private civil ceremony with a lavish and traditional Hindi wedding in Jodphur, India.\n\nHurley announced last December that the couple had separated. She has since been romantically linked to Australian cricket star Shane Warne.\n\nHurley, 46-years old, dated actor Hugh Grant for more than a decade and has a nine-year-old son, Damian, from a relationship with film producer Steve Bing."
