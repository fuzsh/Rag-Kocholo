        "text": "New Delhi | A Hindu religious activist has filed a complaint in a western Indian court saying that Elizabeth Hurley and Arun Nayar's Hindu wedding made a \"mockery of Hindu customs,\" a news report said Wednesday.\n\nThe 41-year-old British actress-model and Nayar, a 42-year-old Indian businessman, were married in a lavish Hindu ceremony at a palace-turned-hotel in the western Indian city of Jodhpur in March.\n\nThe couple first wed in a civil ceremony at a castle near London.\n\n\"This was a marriage for commercial purposes, but at the cost of religious feelings,\" Hasti Mal Saraswat, said in his complaint, The Times of India newspaper said.\n\nJasraj, a Hindu priest, also said that since the couple already had married before, they had no Hindu religious sanction to marry for a second time.\n\nThe complaint goes on to say that Hurley did not remove her footwear while walking around the sacred fire at the ceremony and wore revealing clothes.\n\nThe petition was filed under a section of the Indian Penal Code that makes it an offense to upset any religious feelings with \"deliberate and malicious intention.\""
