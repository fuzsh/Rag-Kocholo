        "text": "London: Elizabeth Hurley, who celebrated her 50th birthday this week, has perhaps received the most unpleasant present ever. The English actress’ ex-husband, Arun Nayar, has been engaged to a model who uncannily looks like Hurley in her younger days, The Daily Mail said. The textiles heir, 50, is to marry a 29-year-old Kim Johnson in two ceremonies, just as he did with Hurley in 2007.\n\nTo add salt to Liz’s wounds, the actress is expected not to be invited to either of the weddings, on the French Riviera and in Arun’s native India. ‘Arun has proposed to Kim and she’s over the moon,’ says Christophe Chalvet, an agent for the model, who has been courted by Nayar since his split from Hurley in 2010. Grammar school-educated Kim showed off her diamond ring at a party at London’s Somerset House this week."
