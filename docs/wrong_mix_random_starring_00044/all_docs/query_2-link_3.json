        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley and Arun Nayar kicked off their Indian wedding festivities with a private dinner party in the country’s financial capital Mumbai, news reports said Tuesday.\n\nThe Hindustan Times newspaper reported that 60 friends and relatives traveling with Hurley and Nayar from Britain attended the party in downtown Mumbai late Monday, and some guests were taken on a yacht ride around the city.\n\nHurley, 41, and Nayar, 42, were married Friday in a private civil ceremony at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London. They held a blessing and party at the castle Saturday evening, with guests including Elton John, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Hurley’s ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant.\n\nThe couple’s Indian friends hosting the parties in Mumbai were tightlipped about other events, but the Indian Express newspaper published details of planned festivities.\n\nThe newspaper quoted guests as saying a “haldi” ceremony followed by a black-tie dinner earlier scheduled for Monday was shifted to late Tuesday.\n\nIndian weddings include a traditional “haldi” (turmeric) ceremony, in which the bride and groom are covered in a paste of turmeric, milk and cream believed to cleanse and beautify them.\n\nThe British model-actress and Nayar, a businessman, arrived in Mumbai early Monday to begin six days of celebrations, which will end with a ceremony at Umaid Bhavan Palace, the Maharaja of Jodphur’s palace-turned-luxury resort in the state of Rajasthan in western India."
