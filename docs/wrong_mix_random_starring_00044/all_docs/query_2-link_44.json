        "text": "British actress Elizabeth Hurley has confirmed that she ended her marriage with√Ç Arun Nayar \"months ago\" amid allegations that she cheated on him with Australian cricketer Shane Warne.\n\nHer affair with Warne came to light after they were photographed kissing and embracing by a tabloid. \"Not a great day. For the record, my husband Arun & I separated a few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware of this (sic),\" Hurley wrote on her twitter page without making any reference to her affair with Warne.\n\nThe News of the World claimed to have a video and pictures of Hurley, 45 and Warne, 41, sharing a series of steamy clinches and claimed Hurley had spent two nights with the cricketer, who is infamous for his womanising ways. Hurley, who has eight-year-old son Damion from a previous relationship, wed Nayar in an extravagant ceremony in India in 2007 and sold the pictures to magazines for millions. From the onset their marriage faced trouble.\n\nThere were rumours last year that their marriage was in trouble which was denied by Hurley as she kept pretending that all was well in their three-year marriage with several public appearances together. Hurley and Nayar, an Oxford graduate, met in 2002.\n\nNayar struggled to divorce his first wife Italian model Valentina Pedroni, who accused the actress of \"stealing\" her husband, the Daily Mail reported. Hurley is still very close to her former boyfriend, actor Hugh Grant. They were one of the leading celebrity couples but ended their romance after Grant was arrested in 1995 with a prostitute.\n\nWhile Warne ended his marriage with Simone, the mother of his children Brooke, 13, Jackson, 11 and Summer, 8, after a string of affairs. They divorced in 2007, but got back together in 2009 for a trial reunion, which did not work out."
