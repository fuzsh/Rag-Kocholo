        "text": "ELIZABETH Hurley couldn't wipe the smile from her face as she partied with ex-husband Arun Nayar last night.\n\nThe former lovebirds, who have remained close since their split, looked in their element as they enjoyed a night out at London's Annabel's nightclub.\n\nLiz, 53, defied the years in a sexy all-black outfit that consisted of tight leather trousers and a see-through ruffled blouse.\n\nShe finished her sultry evening look with sky-high heels and a chic cardigan.\n\nProving himself to be the doting gentleman, businessman Arun even went to the trouble of picking Liz up from her home before their night out.\n\nAnd the laughs started as soon as the actress hopped into the taxi as the pair were pictured giggling as they drove off.\n\nDespite their amicable relationship, the couple were divorced in 2011.\n\nThe judge held that their four-year marriage had \"broken down irretrievably\" and would be dissolved within six weeks.\n\nThe Royals star confirmed their split in December 2010 after photos emerged of her kissing cricketer Shane Warne in a London hotel.\n\nBut the former spouses proved they are still on very good terms when Liz and son Damien were spotted holidaying with Arun and his younger girlfriend in Mykonos in July.\n\nArun isn't the first ex Liz has chosen to remain friends with.\n\nThe beauty is also incredibly close to her cheating ex Hugh Grant - so much so that she even made him Damien's godfather - and former fiancee Shane.\n\nEarlier this month Liz marked actor Hugh's birthday with a gushing post that read: \"Happy Birthday to one of my best friends #HughGrant. As my grandmother used to say: Make new friends but keep the old; one is silver, the other gold üêµüêµüêµ.\"\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220."
