        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley has been granted a divorce from Arun Nayar.\n\nNeither the actress or the textile heir were in the High Court's Family Division on London yesterday to hear District Judge Penny Cushing grant a decree nisi in a hearing which lasted just 92 seconds.\n\nThe judge ruled the four-year marriage could be dissolved because the marriage had broken down due to Arun's \"unreasonable behaviour\".\n\nCourt papers said the judge \"held that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot be reasonably expected to live with the respondent\".\n\nThe couple - who married in March 2007 - have agreed to share the costs of the divorce.\n\nElizabeth - who has a nine-year-old son, Damian, from a previous relationship - announced in December that she had split from Arun after pictures emerged of her kissing cricketer Shane Warne.\n\nShe then revealed the marriage had been over for some time, tweeting: \"Not a great day. For the record, my husband Arun & I separated a few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware of this.\n\n\"Painful, sad days. Arun & I separated for private reasons but FTR he has been a great father to our son Damian & will always be in his life. (sic)\"\n\n- BANG! Showbiz"
