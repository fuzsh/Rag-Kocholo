        "text": "7 pm\n\nThe plot of Bugambilia, set in Guanajuato in the 1800s, was inspired by Rodolfo Usigli’s poem “The Bugambilia,” dedicated by Usigli to Dolores del Río; the melodrama has been called the Mexican version of William Wyler’s Wuthering Heights. Amalia, the spoiled daughter of a wealthy miner, arouses the passions of all the men around her, but succumbs to an ill-starred romance with the poor but dashing Ricardo. The second of five films in this series, presented in partnership with the Mexican Consulate in Albuquerque.\n\n1945; Spanish with English subtitles; 105 minutes; not rated.\n\nFree ticketed event; tickets available one hour before show"
