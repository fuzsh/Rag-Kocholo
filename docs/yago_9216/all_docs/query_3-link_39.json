        "text": "Cinema Revival: A Festival of Film Restoration, an annual program of the Wexner Center for the Arts at The Ohio State University, celebrates the art and practice of film restoration through screenings and discussions with experts in the field.\n\nFebruary 28–March 4, the festival will commemorate its 10th anniversary with a lineup enhanced by two guest filmmakers, including Honorary Academy Award winner Charles Burnett. He’ll be on hand for the March 2 world premiere screening of the restoration of his 1999 comedy The Annihilation of Fish, starring James Earl Jones and Margot Kidder. The film was restored by UCLA Film & Television Archive and The Film Foundation with funding by the Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation, and in collaboration with Milestone Films.\n\nIn addition to Burnett, filmmaker Nancy Savoca will visit the center to present a new restoration of her 1993 film Household Saints, starring Vincent D’Onofrio, Michael Imperioli, Lili Taylor, and Tracy Ullman. It’ll screen March 1 along with a new documentary about the film, The Many Miracles of Household Saints.\n\nBurnett and Savoca will also participate in a March 2 panel discussion on Missing Movies, a nonprofit formed last year to support the rerelease of films that have become unavailable to the public. They’ll be joined by Missing Movies cofounders Dennis Doros and Amy Heller of Milestone Films, Household Saints’s writer-producer Richard Guay, and David Stenn, an accomplished author, screenwriter, and film preservation advocate.\n\nAnother highlight for 2024 is a visit by Aboubakar Sanogo, the North American Regional Secretary for the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), Africa’s most important filmmakers’ organization. He’ll introduce a screening of vintage Senegalese newsreels, one of several Cinema Revival programs presented in conjunction with the Wex’s spring exhibition, Sarah Maldoror: Tricontinental Cinema.\n\nRounding out the program are newly minted classic films from Iran, Italy, Mexico, pre-code-era Hollywood, and the UK, which will be represented by Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom. The response to the controversial thriller on its release in 1960 effectively killed the director’s career, but it’s since been recognized as a widely influential work of genius.\n\nSingle tickets range from free to $9. All-access festival passes are also available for $15–40, providing entry to all events and a passholder lounge with complimentary snacks and beverages. Details are available at wexarts.org/cinemarevival.\n\nWednesday, February 28\n\nCeddo\n\n(Ousmane Sembène, 1977)\n\n4 PM | Free with ticket\n\nCeddo explores the tensions between tradition, religion, colonization, and freedom through this tale of kidnapping, resistance, religious freedom, and an unlikely alliance. The film was banned in Sembène’s native Senegal for his depiction of the conflict between religion and traditional beliefs. (117 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nThursday, February 29\n\nSenegalese Newsreels 1966-1976\n\nIntroduced by Aboubakar Sanogo.\n\n4:30 PM | Free with ticket\n\nFound in Dakar in 2017 in the abandoned building of the former Ministry of Information, the films in this program were made by people who helped shape the future of Senegalese and African cinema. Together they serve as an important historical record of a then-newly independent nation. (79 mins, DCP)\n\nFriday, March 1\n\nYam Daabo\n\n(Idrissa Ouédraogo, 1986)\n\nIntroduced by Aboubakar Sanogo\n\n3 PM | Free with ticket\n\nIn this visually stunning first feature by Burkina Faso filmmaker Idrissa Ouédraogo, a young family from the Sahel region decides to forgo assistance from the international agency USAID and look to other regions where they can support themselves. (80 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nThe Many Miracles of Household Saints\n\n(Martina Savoca-Guay, 2023)\n\n5 PM | Free with ticket\n\nWhile she made Household Saints, director Nancy Savoca was pregnant with daughter Martina Savoca-Guay. Years later, Savoca-Guay offers a behind-the-scenes look at the 1993 indie film’s production through on-set footage and vintage interviews with the filmmakers, costar Lili Taylor, coproducer Jonathan Demme, and more. (58 mins, DCP)\n\nHousehold Saints\n\n(Nancy Savoca, 1993)\n\nDirector Nancy Savoca and Producer Richard Guay in person\n\n7 PM\n\nOne of the most beloved films from the indie filmmaking heyday of the early 1990s, Household Saints follows a young butcher (Vincent D’Onofrio) who “wins” the hand of his future wife (Tracey Ullman) in a pinochle game, and the devoutly religious daughter (Lili Taylor) born from their union. Taylor won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. A Q&A with Savoca and Guay follows the screening. (125 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nSaturday, March 2\n\nVictims of Sin\n\n(Emilio Fernández, 1951)\n\n12:30 PM\n\nMexican film icon Ninón Sevilla stars as a cabaret performer who adopts an infant boy abandoned by a sex worker and her pimp. Supported by the kindly cabaret owner, she abandons her career as a performer for motherhood—until the pimp seeks to reclaim his son. A blend of film noir, melodrama and traditional musical, the film showcases Sevilla’s talents across African, Cuban, and Caribbean dance styles (84 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nThe Letter\n\n(Jean di Lemur, 1929)\n\nPreceded by Accent on Girls (1935)\n\nand MGM Convention Reel (1937)\n\nIntroduced by David Stenn\n\n2:30 PM\n\nThis W. Somerset Maugham adaptation stars Jeanne Eagels as the bored wife of a rubber plantation owner who murders the lover who spurned her. She seems primed to get away with it, too, until an incriminating letter suddenly materializes. Though not as well-known as the 1940 remake with Bette Davis, this pre-code version of The Letter is daring in ways not possible at the time of the later version. (65 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nAccent on Girls is a short showcase for Ina Ray Hutton and her all-female big band MeloDears. MGM Convention Reel features stars such as Jean Harlow, Clark Gable, and Joan Crawford; scandal kept the short suppressed for years. (Each 10 mins, 35mm)\n\nDavid Stenn, a writer-producer for television, a biographer, and a prominent supporter of film preservation, will discuss the unique restoration story behind each of these films.\n\nMissing Movies Panel\n\n5 PM | Free with ticket\n\nMany films made in the last 50 years have become unavailable to the public due to lost elements, lost rights, or the indifference of a work’s legal owners. Missing Movies is dedicated to making these films available to watch again. Cofounders Dennis Doros and Amy Heller, also of Milestone Films, will discuss the related challenges with preservationist David Stenn and filmmakers Charles Burnett, Nancy Savoca, and Richard Guay. (Approx. 60 mins.)\n\nCinema Revival Reception\n\n6 PM\n\nAhead of the screening of Charles Burnett’s The Annihilation of Fish, mingle with the special guests participating in this year’s Cinema Revival and fellow movie lovers while enjoying light snacks and a cash bar.\n\nThe Annihilation of Fish\n\n(Charles Burnett, 1999)\n\n7 PM\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nDirector Charles Burnett in person\n\nIn a Los Angeles boarding house, a relationship grows between a former housewife having an imagined love affair with 19th century composer Giacomo Puccini (Lynne Redgrave) and a mentally ill Jamaican widower fighting unseen demons (James Earl Jones). Burnett’s singular, rarely seen romantic comedy also features Margot Kidder as the pair’s energetic landlady. (108 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nSunday, March 3\n\nThe Stranger and the Fog\n\n(Bahram Beyzale, 1974)\n\n11:30 AM\n\nPreviously considered impossible to see, this dreamlike, gorgeous work of the Iranian New Wave begins with a wounded man in a boat named Ayat who washes up on the shore of a small village, claiming to have no memory of who he is. After settling into community life with a young widow, Ayat’s newfound peace is threatened by the arrival of more strangers from the sea. (140 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nSmog\n\n(Franco Rossi, 1962)\n\n2:15 PM\n\nA true rarity before its recent restoration, the first Italian film shot entirely in Los Angeles follows a young Italian lawyer (played by Enrico Maria Salerno) on a 48-hour layover in L.A. on his way to Mexico City. He begins to encounter one Italian ex-pat after another, who lead him on a meandering trip around the city whose midcentury look and lifestyle was in sharp contrast to that in post-war Italy. (101 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nPeeping Tom\n\n(Michael Powell, 1960)\n\n4:15 PM\n\nOne of the most notorious films of its era, Michael Powell’s thriller follows mild-mannered photographer Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) who shoots cheesecake photos for under-the-counter sale while working on a film about fear…and he has a diabolical method for eliciting the emotion in his subjects. Peeping Tom is often compared to Hitchcock’s Psycho, which it beat to the screen by mere months. (102 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nMonday, March 4\n\nXala\n\n(Ousmane Sembène, 1975)\n\n4 PM | Free with ticket\n\nA hilarious satire about the patriarchal and corrupt post-independence ruling class in Senegal, Xala was a major hit in its home country, despite government censorship of the film. A successful businessman with two wives (one traditional, one Western) is appointed to the local Chamber of Commerce. He decides to take a third wife, but problems on his wedding night lead him to believe he has been cursed by one of his other wives. (123 mins, 4K DCP)\n\nCharles Burnett is the director of such films as Killer of Sheep (1978), My Brother’s Wedding (1983), To Sleep with Anger (1990), and The Glass Shield (1994). He is a key figure in the L.A. Rebellion film movement that began in the 1970s. In 2017 he received an Honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nDennis Doros and Amy Heller are cofounders of the film distribution label Milestone Films. They have stewarded the restorations of such films as The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), Portrait of Jason (1967), Killer of Sheep (1978), Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt (1989), and many more. They are Co-Presidents of Missing Movies, a nonprofit dedicated to making inaccessible films available for legal public viewing.\n\nRichard Guay is the producer of such films as True Love (1989), Dogfight (1991), Household Saints (1993), and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999). He is on the Board of Directors of Missing Movies, a nonprofit dedicated to making inaccessible films available for legal public viewing.\n\nAboubakar Sanogo is the North American Regional Secretary for the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), Africa’s most important filmmakers’ organization. He is currently working on the African Film Heritage Project (AFHP), a partnership between FEPACI, Martin Scorsese’s Film Foundation and UNESCO, which seeks to preserve and restore significant African films. He is Associate Professor in Film Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa.\n\nNancy Savoca is the director of such films as True Love (1989), Dogfight (1991), Household Saints (1993), and If These Walls Could Talk (1996). True Love received the Grand Jury Prize at the 1989 Sundance Film Festival. She is on the Board of Directors of Missing Movies, a nonprofit dedicated to making inaccessible films available for legal public viewing.\n\nDavid Stenn's writing and producing credits for television include Hill Street Blues; Boardwalk Empire; 21 Jump Street; Beverly Hills, 90210; and The L Word. He is the author of biographies Clara Bow: Runnin’ Wild and Bombshell: The Life and Death of Jean Harlow. “It Happened One Night…At M-G-M,” Stenn’s discovery for Vanity Fair of Hollywood’s best-suppressed scandal, brought vindication to rape survivor Patricia Douglas after 66 years in hiding. Stenn adapted this story into the documentary Girl 27. Stenn is a passionate supporter of film preservation. He serves on the Film Committee of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Board of Directors at the UCLA Film & Television Archive in Los Angeles."
