        "text": "While looking at the land that belonged to the Castro family until the end of porfirismo, Esperanza tells her cadet son her story. Years ago she secretly married José Luis, the owners son, who, contrary to his father's wishes, was involved in the revolutionary movement. Because of this he was thrown out of the house and persecuted. Doña Clara, José Luis's mother, wanted her to leave her husband who, when drunk, had even tried to kill his father. Following the positive outcome of the revolution, José Luis had returned to live happily with Esperanza, who was expecting a baby. But José Luis's brothers, false generals of the revolution, had killed their father and taken over his company. José Luis had taken his revenge by hanging one of the two while the other had captured Esperanza and the newborn baby, threatening to kill them both if José Luis did not give himself up to the authorities. In order to save the family, José Luis allowed himself to be shot dead in front of Esperanza, who was marked forever by the pain."
