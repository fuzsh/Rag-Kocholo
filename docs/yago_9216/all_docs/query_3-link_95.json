        "text": "In the final phase of what is known as the Golden Age of Mexican cinema (1933–1955), dramas with graver and grimmer subjects began to be shown more frequently in Mexican movie theatres. These films explored the darkest impulses of urban characters, in plots depicting crime, graphic violence, and the tragic loss of moral fiber. Their stories featured individuals from privileged backgrounds, the justice system, the world of education, or the rising working class. Integrating several of these elements, the two examples of Mexican film that I analyze here reflect some of the discourses of disenchantment and social criticism that were appearing frequently in newspaper articles and certain forms of entertainment and literature of the era. The loss of civic values and the active pursuit of self-centered passions, revenge, chauvinistic male hubris, and monetary interest serve as core motivations for the characters featured in La noche avanza (Gavaldón 1952) and Sensualidad (Gout 1951). Both films are examples of narratives of the era focused on the fall of “virtuous” male figures: successful men who are dragged into criminal behavior by circumstances or their own actions. I have specifically chosen these two films to illustrate the final phase in the dissemination of what Picatto (Reference Piccato2017) calls “criminal literacy,” as their images exemplify a certain transition in the delivery of crime narratives from textual to visual form. Furthermore, these films depict the tolerance for masculine aggression and the structural violence against women that rose as consequence of new economic and social conditions imposed by the Mexican political and justice system during the 1940s (Bailón Vásquez Reference Bailón Vásquez2016, 164). Finally, these films demonstrate how Mexican directors integrate visual and character allusions that converse with international and American film, and at the same time, they express local anxieties and misgivings regarding the social and political process of the postrevolutionary state in Mexico.\n\nThe rise to prominence of darker filmic spectacles in Mexico can be indirectly explained as the result of an increase in the production of films with urban settings, which by 1942 surpassed by two to one the output of those featuring rural images (García Riera Reference García Riera1998, 124). Furthermore, the Mexican academy’s gradual recognition of a few feature films with noir characteristics serves as additional evidence of the brewing changes in the field of cinematic production during the era. For instance, in 1949, the winner of the Ariel Award was a drama steeped in nationalist imagery and suffused with indigenista rhetoric.Footnote 1 Río Escondido (1948), directed by Emilio Fernández and starring María Félix, received ten nominations and won eight awards, including for best film and best director (García Riera Reference García Riera1998, 179–181). The story of a mestiza rural teacher who heroically defends her indigenous students against an arbitrary white cacique was also screened with great success at the Cannes Film Festival (Doetsch Reference Doetsch and Wehr2016; Tierney Reference Tierney2012).\n\nThree years later, by contrast, the Mexican academy granted its maximum recognition to one of the most prominent examples of Mexican film noir, En la palma de tu mano (1951), directed by Roberto Gavaldón, a film focused on urban misadventures and deception featuring an extraordinary con man, Professor Karín (played by Arturo de Córdova), who uses his powers of “divination” to manipulate and extort high society female victims (Mino García Reference Mino García2007, 108–112; Obscura Gutiérrez Reference Obscura Gutiérrez, Peredo and Narro2015, 205). In 1952, En la palma de tu mano received eleven nominations and walked away with eight Ariel trophies, including those for best picture and best director (García Riera Reference García Riera1998, 180). Such accolades make this film the most decorated in the noir cycle of Mexican cinema.\n\nA key clarification must be made here. Until the turn of the millennium, an important sector of Mexican film criticism concluded that the category of cine negro mexicano, or “Mexican film noir,” was in fact nonexistent or impossible given the conditions of production and exhibition during the classic era of Mexican cinematography (1933–1955), as well as a recurrent use of melodrama in that era, a supposed lack of a locally produced detective novel tradition, and the prevalence of censorship (Ayala Blanco Reference Ayala Blanco1993, 117; Bonfil Reference Bonfil2016, 53; Fernández Reference Fernández2007, 28; Monsiváis Reference Monsiváis2000, 74; Ortega and Faz Reference Ortega and Fernando Faz1992). Taking issue with this exclusion, and after reviewing a broad range of American film noir from the era of 1940–1959 for comparison purposes, my research confirms and extends the partial conclusions reached by other authors (Aviña Reference Aviña2017, 12–15; Mino García Reference Mino García2007, 26, 95, 118; Tuñón Reference Tuñón2003). The most important of these studies is Rafael Aviña’s Mex Noir, cine mexicano policiaco (Reference Aviña2017), which presents a definitive panorama of the core films in the cine negro category. However, Aviña’s (Reference Aviña2017, 14–15, 225) book does not offer a specific definition of noir and insists on locating most of the production of Mexican noir films during the Alemanista period (1946–1952), acknowledging only a sporadic yield during the rest of the 1950s and early 1960s. As a result, the study’s diffuse categorization and time frame yields a very limited list of titles, as well as mixes horror and wrestling films that clearly belong to different genres (Aviña Reference Aviña2017, 22, 226). My research stems from the need to specify the characteristics of Mexican noir and locate the dozens of films that are left out of Aviña’s study and previous studies. In this sense, my analysis confirms that there was indeed a solid production of dark films in Mexico from 1941 to 1959, as well as a significant audience for them. Moreover, the number, scope, relevance, and influence of these films were broader than previously established, which indicates that they should be studied by paying closer attention to their contemporary social and media contexts. Furthermore, I propose that the categories of melodrama negro, melonoir, and cine negro are equivalent and should be unified and studied together as “Mexican film noir.”\n\nFollowing classifications proposed by previous authors (Mayer and McDonnell Reference Mayer and McDonnell2007, 20–21; Miklitsch Reference Miklitsch2014, 4–10; Spicer Reference Spicer2010, xxxix–xl), I used a set of chronological, visual, narrative, and psychological characteristics in selecting 120 films to include in the category of Mexican film noir. The inclusion criteria were the following: (1) films produced or released between 1941 and 1959 featuring black and white cinematography, a variable number of night scenes, and a strategic use of high contrast light and pronounced shadows; (2) a central narrative tension that revolves around the facts, preparation, or accidental circumstances of a violent or criminal act committed by ordinary individuals who out of desperation or anxiety make bad decisions and are overwhelmed by the life-changing consequences of their actions; (3) a filmic atmosphere that tends to be (or becomes) dark and alienating, with characters immersed in psychological, emotional, or social circumstances leading to oppressive or violent situations; (4) realist plots featuring urban settings and following one or more of the eight narrative tropes present in American or international noir: the fall of the virtuous man or woman, the rise and fall of an exceptional con man or tragic woman, the unsolved crime awaiting investigation, the psychologically disturbed criminal, the heist gone wrong, the rogue cop or corrupt officer of the law, the jailbreak or prison riot, the failed expectations of youth or popular hero. Finally, the selection of the films includes a subgenre—notable in Mexican cinema—featuring the fictional lives of cabaret stars: the rumbera or cabaretera noir. Horror, sci-fi, wrestling, and Western films that borrow some elements of noir were excluded, insofar as they belong to specific and predefined genres. These four criteria, together with the two aforementioned selection factors, allowed for the inclusion of previously recognized features of the Mexican noir tradition as well as dozens of films ignored by previous studies.\n\nIt is certainly true that the Mexican filmography of this era has a characteristic melodramatic tone, stemming from plots focused on the sentimental and emotional reactions of characters and the presence of strained familial or amorous relations (Aviña Reference Aviña2004; Hernández Rodríguez Reference Hernández Rodríguez, Hershfield and Maciel1999; López Reference López, King, López and Alvarado1993, 149). However, a revision of American and international sources with regard to the definition and inclusion of specific works in the genre, style, or movement known as film noir yielded no reference to the rejection of films due to their use or integration of melodramatic elements. In fact, James Naremore (Reference Naremore2008, 41, 45, 48) refers to seminal noir works as “melodramas” and comments on the “melodramatic” relations among the main characters. As he and other authors clearly state, classic examples such as Double Indemnity (Wilder 1944), Out of the Past (Tourneur 1947), Secret beyond the Door (Lang 1947), The Third Man (Welles 1950), and most of the films centered on female figures, such as Phantom Lady (Siodmak 1944), Laura (Preminger 1944), Mildred Pierce (Curtiz 1945), and Gilda (Vidor 1946), include elements of melodrama or are considered both melodramas and fully fledged examples of film noir (Chinen Biesen Reference Chinen Biesen2005, 135, 137; Grossman Reference Grossman and Miklitsch2014, 39; Heredero and Santamarina Reference Heredero and Santamarina1996, 133; Miklitsch Reference Miklitsch2017, 28; Naremore Reference Naremore2008, 71, 89, 115, 122; Osteen Reference Osteen2013, 187)."
