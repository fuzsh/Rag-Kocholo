        "text": "Five parties announced the establishment of the ‘Democratic Alliance’ that will run in the upcoming municipal elections. The goal: a third party option to Fatah and Hamas.\n\n“Instead of harping on, denouncing and analyzing the boycott, we should channel our efforts into changing the policies which are destroying our country from within,” writes Melanie Takefman.\n\n“Just as racial justice in this country is unimaginable without a more profound reckoning of the legacy of slavery than we have been able as a nation to summon, the conflict in Israel and Palestine will never advance so long as Jews deny the cost of Zionism,” writes Daniel May.\n\n“It’s a war on the mind, hearing them building all the time and knowing that that is our land they are building on. We know now we will never get it back. Soon we will be completely surrounded by the wall and the settlements will be built right up on the edge of it.”\n\nGazan businessmen staged a protest at a crossing point Monday over what they said was the mass cancellation of travel permits by Israel, which they blamed for suffocating trade.\n\nThe Coalition for Accountability and Integrity – Aman is distributing awards to those reporting on all forms of corruption cases in Gaza, in an effort to fight this rampant phenomenon.\n\nAccording to a special report prepared to mark Tisha B’Av, which commemorates the destruction of the First and Second Temples, the most violent pages on Israeli social networking sites belong to politicians.\n\nJoint List MK Basel Ghattas should be sanctioned for calling for a boycott of Israel at a far-left conference in Montreal, Yisrael Beytenu MK Oded Forer said Monday, reacting to the lead story in The Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday hit back at Jordan’s allegations of Israeli misconduct at the Temple Mount, saying Jerusalem will not allow the holy site to become exclusive to Muslims like the Saudi Arabian cities of Mecca and Medina."
