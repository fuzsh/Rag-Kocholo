        "text": "Today, together with MK Hamed Amar, I visited the children from the Majdal Shams massacre, that are being hospitalised in ‘ZIV’ hospital in zefat. This disaster is a painful reminder of the shared fate with our Druze brothers. We took a picture with Riff, a 12-year-old kid, that just wanted to play soccer with his friends, and now he needs to be treated in a hospital. The smiling boy who enters the 6th grade, went to the soccer field near his home in Majdal Shams, last Saturday and found himself in the heart of a battle field , when Hezbollah fired a missile at Israel. We visited him, and the other kids that got injured, and we pray with their families that all the children will soon be released from the hospital, and get a full recovery."
