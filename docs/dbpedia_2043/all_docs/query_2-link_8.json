        "text": "In recent years we have witnessed a disturbing trend toward the erosion of democratic values in Israel and the promotion of anti-democratic initiatives. It is particularly alarming that democratic values are being undermined and the rules of the democratic process are being broken in the Knesset – Israel’s parliament and the heart and symbol of Israeli democracy. Statements and actions by senior political figures have far-reaching ramifications and influence on the attitudes of the Israeli public regarding democracy, human rights, and political, social and ethnic minorities.\n\nThe most basic rules of the democratic game have repeatedly been challenged. The foundations of the democratic system have been attacked, including the separation of powers and respect for the office and function of the different branches and institutions that exist in a democracy; the role of civil society; protection of human rights, for example the freedom of expression, the right to protest, and respect for the underlying value of equality. By using the “defensive democracy” approach, these areas have been subjected to systematic erosion through biased and distorted interpretations.\n\nWhat do we mean by anti-democratic actions? The attacks on democracy essentially seek to silence the positions, opinions, and criticism of social or political minorities; to delegitimize political rivals, human rights organizations, and minorities; to curtail the activities of those whose positions or actions are inconsistent with those of the political majority; and to present minorities in Israeli society in a generalized way, as enemies of the state, thereby legitimizing the violation of their civil and political rights.\n\nAnti-democratic initiatives have been manifested in various ways, including: bills that violate fundamental and underlying democratic rights, particularly the freedom of expression and political protest, and equality before the law; verbal assaults on those whose positions are currently in the minority in the Knesset; attempts to damage the legitimate and vital work of human rights and social change organizations; and attempts to restrict the freedom of expression in academic, artistic, and cultural activities.\n\nWhy are such actions problematic? What harm do they cause? The result of these initiatives is damage to the basic principles of Israel’s democratic system: Ongoing and cumulative damage to the freedom of expression and protest, human dignity, and equality; a weakening pluralism and a range of opinions, thoughts, and attitudes; damage to the freedom of association; and harm to the legitimacy of diverse attitudes and opinions. Conversely, these initiatives strengthen the tyranny of the majority towards social, political, and national minorities and legitimize the violation of the rights of these minorities.\n\nThese initiatives arise in the context of a social and political reality that, whilst not new, remains highly charged and on occasions extremely harsh. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of the mantra of “defensive democracy” whenever attempts are made to violate the rights of minorities (whether ethnic, social, or political) is misleading and does not render the process legitimate or just. This process that we are currently witnessing may ultimately lead to the decay of the entire democratic system. Defending the state and the safety of its citizens must be undertaken in a proportionate and proper manner, whereby basic rights are denied or restricted only in the most extreme instances, as already established in Israeli law.\n\nIt is important to note that even if these bills and initiatives do not progress to the stages of legislation and implementation, the attempt to advance them in and of itself has a considerable chilling effect on Israeli society as a whole. These initiatives seriously harm the Arab minority in Israel, human rights and civil society organizations, the Supreme Court and State Prosecutor’s Office, the media, academia, and the world of arts and culture – and therefore damage Israeli democracy. During the legislative process, bills and initiatives form part of the public agenda and influence the public mood and the perception of reality in Israeli society, creating a chilling effect on institutions and on society at large.\n\nThis overview details the anti-democratic initiatives discussed in the 20th Knesset organized by topic:\n\nFreedom of expression and pluralism\n\nFreedom of Cultural Expression\n\nEducation towards Pluralism\n\nFree Media in Israel\n\nActivities of NGOs\n\nRights of the Arab minority in Israel\n\nBills relating to Initiatives to Boycott Israel\n\nThese bills impose a “price tag” on legitimate political statements and impair public discussion on urgent and controversial issues. This violates the constitutional rights to freedom of expression, dignity, and equality. If these bills are adopted, the draconian sanctions they impose will deter in advance those who wish to express a political opinion by calling for a boycott; accordingly, their damage will be felt even before indictments have been served on the basis of the law. Boycott laws are laws intended to restrict the expression of opinions and their sole purpose is to silence legitimate criticism.\n\n-The Political Parties Funding Bill (Amendment – Denial of Funding to a Party Advocating a Boycott against the State of Israel), 2015, tabled by the Yisrael Beitenu faction (P/20/2220). See the Hebrew text of the bill: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/2220.rtf\n\n-Entry to Israel Bill (Amendment – Non-Granting of a Visa and Permit of Residence to a Person Advocating a Boycott against Israel), 2015 (P/1906/20)\n\nThe proposed amendment will prohibit persons who support a boycott against the State of Israel, or a boycott against the settlements, from entering the State of Israel and the Occupied Territories. This will be achieved by denying an entry visa to Israel (which is also required in order to enter the Occupied Territories) to foreign citizens, and by denying temporary residency or a permit for temporary residence from the military for Palestinian residents of the Territories).\n\nACRI and Adalah opposed the amendment, arguing that the law violates basic democratic principles by addressing a person’s political opinion as a consideration in denying foreigners entry to Israel and the Occupied Territories. Individuals wishing to enter Israel certainly do not need to toe the line adopted by the present government regarding the occupation. The law can be expected to cause particular injury to the rights of tens of thousands of Palestinian families in which one of the partners holds temporary residence or a permit for temporary residency in Israel. Such individuals will henceforth be subject to the denial of their rights for expressing a political opinion.\n\nStatus: The amendment was passed at its Second and Third Readings on 6 March 2017\n\nBills relating to Contempt of the Flag\n\nSeveral bills which have been proposed to impose stricter penalties for contempt or disrespect of the flag, harm the freedom of expression of the public and Members of Knesset.\n\nThe Flag, Emblem and Anthem of the State Law (Amendment 7) 2016\n\nThe amendment to the law proposes significantly stricter penalties on those who harm the flag of Israel: from one year in prison and a fine of 300 lirot as stipulated in the law previously, to here years in prison and a fine of 58,400 Shekel.\n\nTo access the bill in Hebrew: http://fs.knesset.gov.il/20/law/20_Isr_347822.pdf\n\nStatus: The bill was approved at the second and third readings on 18 July 2016.\n\nThe Flag, Emblem and the Anthem of the State Bill (Amendment – Displaying the flag at a public event) 2016\n\nThe bill seeks to obligate that the Israeli flag be displayed at every public event, and to impose a fine of 5,000 Shekel on event organizers who fail to comply. The bill also seeks to prohibit invited public officials from participating in public events convened by organizations who breached the law for a period of 6 months.\n\nTo access the bill in Hebrew: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/3323.rtf\n\nStatus: The bill was submitted but has not yet been advanced.\n\nLegislative Memorandum of the Arts and Culture Bill (Amendment No. …), 2016 – Regarding the culture budget\n\nThis bill, which is also known as the “Loyalty in Culture Bill,” is being promoted by the Minister of Culture Miri Regev. The bill seeks to empower the Ministry of Culture to deny funding cultural institutions on the basis of non-professional criteria. The original bill authorized the Ministry of Culture to deny budgets in advance for cultural institutions that negate the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, disrespect state emblems, mark the Nakba Day, and so forth. This is an improper and unconstitutional proposal that would grant the Minister of Culture and the officials in the Culture Ministry the power to interfere in the content of creative works. This would be a grave interference in the freedom of cultural expression.\n\nAfter ACRI wrote to the Attorney General, he issued an opinion stating that the Minister of Culture may not intervene in the content of cultural productions. The original bill was subsequently amended so that the denial of a budget to a cultural institution will only be possible retroactively. This amendment also damages the freedom of expression and culture, and will have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Israel, particularly with respect to sensitive issues that deserve special protection.\n\nStatus: A legislative memorandum has been submitted.\n\nProhibition of Expression of Sympathy or Identification with the Nazi Regime Law (Legislative Amendments), 2015, tabled by MK Mickey Levi (P/20/980)\n\nThis bill seeks to impose stringent and sweeping restrictions on public debate in the State of Israel, gravely damaging the constitutional right to the freedom of expression. The Holocaust is an exceptionally painful and difficult issue, and insensitive use of symbols relating to the Holocaust may indeed cause grave offense to many people. However, the freedom of expression includes the right to make difficult, forthright, and even offensive statements, including the rhetorical use of harsh and provocative imagery. The question of the social legitimacy of the use of symbols relating to the Holocaust in political and public discourse is a serious one that deserves open discussion in the “market of ideas.” It is not a question that should be addressed under criminal law.\n\nStatus: The bill was not promoted.\n\nSee the Hebrew text of the bill: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/980.rtf\n\nTo access the Legislative Memorandum in Hebrew: http://www.tazkirim.gov.il/Tazkirim_Attachments/42742_x_AttachFile.docx\n\nState Education Bill (Amendment – Preventing the Activities of Organizations that Oppose Educational Values and the IDF), 2017, tabled by MKs Shuli Moalem-Refaeli and others (P/3643)\n\nThe purpose of this bill is to deny the organization Breaking the Silence access to schools, but its ramifications are much broader. According to the bill, the education minister will enjoy exclusive discretion in determining which bodies can hold lectures in schools, and will determine what content, bodies, and organizations meet educational values and which do not. Since “educational values” are defined in a broad and general manner, the bill will effectively enable the minister to reject any content, body, or group if he dislikes their activities or beliefs or if these do not match his own political agenda and values.\n\nThe bill also has ramifications for the freedom of expression of teachers. It will have a significant chilling effect exacerbating the trend and mood of recent years.\n\nStatus: The bill was passed at its Preliminary Reading on 11 January 2017.\n\nProposed Law: Prevention of Harm to the State of Israel by Means of a Boycott (Amendment – Cessation of Funding of Institutions of Higher Education), 5777-2016, tabled by MK Oded Forer\n\nThe proposed law seeks to empower the Council for Higher Education to reduce the budget forwarded to a university if one of its lectures call for the boycotting of the settlements. The proposal will damage freedom of expression in general and academic freedom in particular – a right that enjoys special constitutional protection. An academic world without diverse views – even ones that are controversial – cannot meet its most basic purpose: to teach critical thought. Silencing academic on ideological grounds is extremely dangerous and disturbing and is tantamount to political persecution. Such action violates the basic principles of any democracy. As long as the position being presented is not illegal, and even if it is unpopular, its expression in the public domain should be permitted. In this case, a boycott is a legal and legitimate tool for protest, while the issue of the settlements is the subject of political debate in Israel. This type of proposed law threatens universities and their staff and lecturers, and can have a severe chilling effect whether or not they are ultimately enacted. From here on, it is clear to everyone what is considered a “legitimate” opinion and what is not, and what are the borders of “permitted” discourse.\n\nStatus: the proposed law has not yet been advanced.\n\nLegislative Memorandum: Jurisdiction of Rabbinical Courts (Adjudicative Authority by Consent), 5777-2017\n\nThis legislative memorandum presents a government bill intended to amend the Rabbinical Courts Adjudication Law in order to grant them parallel authority on civil matters when the parties consent thereto. The religious courts will be authorized to rule in accordance with religious law on these matters. This is a far-reaching proposal that is liable to change the character of Israeli law beyond recognition, establishing two parallel and clashing legal systems. The principle of the rule of law, which ensures a single legal system for all citizens of the state and equality before the law, will no longer be maintained. In some disputes, the parties will be subject to a different legal system and different policy, acting in accordance with a law that was not enacted by the legislature but has its origin in religious laws and rules.\n\nThe memorandum entails grave damage to the rights of litigants, including the right to equality, dignity, freedom of vocation, freedom of property, freedom of expression, and the right of access to the courts. It is liable to cause particular damage to women’s rights.\n\nStatus: at the legislative memorandum stage.\n\nThe Disclosure Obligations of Recipients of Support from Foreign Government Entities Bill (Amendment) (Increased Transparency by Recipients of Support, when the Majority of their Funding is from Donations from Foreign Government Entities), 2015\n\nThe original bill, popularly referred to as the “Transparency Law” or the “NGO Law,” was a government bill that sought to impose a series of obligations on NGOs that receive the majority of their funding from “foreign government entities” (foreign countries, the European Union, the United Nations, government foundations, etc.). Amongst other things, the bill sought to obligate NGOs to which the bill applies to state and/or declare this fact in any publication, in any discussion attended by public representatives or elected representatives, for representatives of NGOs to wear an identification tag and so forth.\n\nACRI was strongly opposed to the bill and claimed that the bill was improper anti-democratic, and that it undermined basic rights. The purpose of the bill was not to increase transparency but to enable the political persecution and stigmatization of specific organizations. In ACRI’s view the bill was unnecessary, since existing law already requires NGOs to act in a transparent manner, particularly if they receive funding from foreign countries. Moreover, the bill made no reference to donations from private sources, which constitute a significant source of funding for NGOs that promote a right-wing agenda. Accordingly, it is obvious that the sole purpose of the bill was to delegitimize and hinder the activities of NGOs associated with the political ‘left’ and with human rights. The implication that these organizations act on behalf of foreign countries is misleading and is another element of the campaign of vilification against civil society organizations.\n\nThis bill was mentioned in the coalition agreement between the Likud and the Jewish Home parties, signed at the start of the 20th Knesset.\n\nStatus: The bill was approved on 11 July 2016 following second and third readings. The bill that ultimately passed seems to be less severe than the original proposal, as the requirements to wear a tag and to disclose funding sources at the start of every meeting were removed. However the very existence of the law in which intends to harm a specific type of organization, and the disclosure requirements that are included in the legislation, will harm the operations and influence of organizations. It has recently been published that the Prime Minister believes that the law he passed is too weak, and that he is interested in promoting a law that will completely prohibit donations by foreign countries to Israeli non-profit organizations.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the bill and ACRI’s response, see: https://www.acri.org.il/en/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Position-Paper-NGO-Bill-Updated-Feb-2016.pdf\n\nFor a summary of the law in English: https://www.acri.org.il/en/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Summary-of-NGO-Law.pdf\n\nIn addition to the government bill mentioned above, a number of similar private bills were also tabled during the 20th Knesset:\n\nForeign NGOs Bill, 2015, tabled by MKs Magal, Smotrich, Yogev, and Slomiansky (P/20/1729); for the text of the bill (in Hebrew), see: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/1729.rtf\n\nForeign Agents Bill, 2015, tabled by most of the MKs of the Yisrael Beitenu faction (P/20/1730); for the text of the bill (in Hebrew), see: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/1730.rtf\n\nThe Disclosure Obligations of Recipients of Support from Foreign Government Entities Bill (Amendment – Transparency Rules), 2015, tabled by MKs Smotrich, Amsalem, Ilatov, and Moses (P/20/1761); for the text of the bill (in Hebrew), see: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/1761.rtf\n\nThe government approved the private bills, which passed the Preliminary Reading and were attached to the government bill.\n\nBill Declaring “Breaking the Silence” an Unlawful Association\n\nIn January 2016, the media reported that MK Shuli Moalem and other Members of Knesset were interested in initiating a bill to declare the NGO “Breaking the Silence” an unlawful association, thereby effectively outlawing the organization.\n\nStatus: Not yet promoted.\n\nThe Political Parties Funding Bill (Amendment No. 35), 5767 – 2017\n\nThis bill, also known as the “V15 Bill,” seeks to limit the activities of various non-party-political bodies that seek to influence the outcome of elections in Israel. To this end, the bill seeks to impose severe restrictions on institutional organizations and/or informal initiatives that are defined as bodies active in the elections. There is broad support for the goal of maintaining equality and preventing capital from influencing elections. However, the details of the proposed bill are extremely problematic and liable to damage freedom of expression, which is particularly important during an election campaign.\n\nThe bill specifies four actions that will be defined as activity in elections: 1) Maintaining databases containing information about individuals’ political attitudes; 2) Transporting voters to the polling station according to their political positions, including assumed positions on the basis of their place of residence; 3) Urging electors with particular positions to vote or not to vote for a specific candidate or party; 4) Publication intended to influence voters to vote for or against a specific candidate or party, even if no payment has been made for the publication (the so-called “Israel Today clause.”)\n\nBodies that undertake such actions at a total cost exceeding NIS 100,000 will be defined as “bodies active in the elections” and will face the following restrictions:\n\nFunding restrictions: An active body will be able to raise up to NIS 22,000 from an individual donor (and if the body is active on the scale of NIS 400,000 – up to NIS 11,000 from a single donor). Donors must be Israeli citizens only. The bodies will not be able to receive donations from corporations, as in the case of the funding restrictions on political parties.\n\nRestrictions on freedom of action in elections: Political parties will be able to sue bodies active in the elections (indeed, the proposed law almost invites them to do so) and to request injunctions against activities by bodies alleged to be bodies active in the elections. Accordingly, even if a particular body is not a body active in the elections, the possibility that it will face an injunction, with all the legal expenses this incurs, may seriously deter citizen participation in the elections. Moreover, bodies active in the elections at a scope greater than NIS 400,000 will be liable to administrative sanctions (fines), while those with a scope greater than NIS 500,000 will also be exposed to criminal sanctions.\n\nThus the bill seeks to establish extremely broad definitions for determining that a non-party-political body is connected to a Knesset faction, thereby significantly restricting the activities of such bodies. This is liable to impair freedom of expression and association, as well as the fundamental political freedom of citizens to exercise meaningful influence over the elections in Israel.\n\nStatus: The bill passed in its Second and Third Readings on March 20th, 2017.\n\nThe Amendment of the Income Tax Ordinance Bill (Institution Operating for the Good of the State of Israel), 2017, tabled by MK Bezalel Smotrich (P/3667)\n\nThis bill seeks to deny the tax exemption under section 46A of the Income Tax Ordinance to organizations that “act against the State of Israel.” This is defined in the bill as organizations that promote a boycott or accuse Israel overseas of war crimes. The bill also seeks to establish that bodies that receive tax exemption must act for the good of citizens in Israel or Jews in the Diaspora.\n\nThis bill forms part of the campaign of defamation and delegitimization led by the government in recent years against civil society organizations whose agenda differs from government policy. The organizations stigmatized by this bill (primarily ones active in the field of human rights in the Territories, refugee rights, and so forth) operate lawfully, under the protection of the basic rights of freedom of association and freedom of expression. The bill seeks to determine what is damaging to the state and what is not, and accordingly to grant or deny tax exemption on a selective basis, according to a political opinion. It does not propose egalitarian administrative criteria for the receipt of the benefit, and instead introduces selective and discriminatory criteria based on the political agenda of those promoting the bill (what one person perceives as promoting democracy will be perceived by another as damaging the state). This process is accompanied by the delegitimization of specific organizations.\n\nStatus: The bill was passed at its Preliminary Reading on 8 March 2017.\n\nSee the Hebrew text of the bill\n\nNational Service Bill, 5767 – 2017\n\nThis bill seeks to regulate the subject of national (civilian) service, which has not previously been formalized in law. The bill integrates amendments proposed in a bill table by MK Amir Ohana that seeks to prevent organizations that receive over 50 percent of the funding from a foreign entity from receiving national service volunteers.\n\nThe final version of the bill separates the possibility to receive a position for a national service volunteer from the possibility to receive government funding for the position. It was decided that organizations that provide care for individuals will be able to receive a national service position, provided that they act for the population in Israel or for Israeli residents in the fields of education, health, welfare, and encouraging and absorbing Jewish immigration. Organizations that are active in general for the population in Israel in the fields of culture, the environment, road safety, and internal security will also be able to receive positions for volunteers. The ramification is that organizations that are active solely on behalf of Palestinian residents of the Territories will not be eligible for national service positions.\n\nThe bill also establishes that when a public body considers funding a national service position, the appointed minister’s approval will be required in the case of an operating body funded primarily by foreign entities.\n\nThe purpose of this law is to damage selected and specific organizations whose position differs from that of the current political majority and, above all, to delegitimize these bodies in public discourse.\n\nStatus: The bill was passed in its second and third readings on March 22nd, 2017.\n\nFreedom of Information Bill (Amendment – Abolition of Exemption for Organizations Funded Primarily by Foreign State Entities), 2017, tabled by MK Shuli Moalem-Refaeli\n\nLike the “NGO Law” (see below), this bill also targets NGOs funded by foreign state entities. The bill seeks not only to deny these bodies the exemption from the levy on applications to state bodies in accordance with the Freedom of Information Law, but also to establish that they will be required to pay a double levy. The bill is based on the claim that these NGOs operate against the state with the information they obtain. This is another bill that seeks to silence critical voices and to delegitimize organizations that are unpopular with the majority.\n\nStatus: The bill has not yet been promoted.\n\nProposed Basic Law: Adjudication (Amendment – Restriction of Standing), tabled by MK Miki Zohar and others (P/4123)\n\nYears ago, the Supreme Court established in its rulings broad standing allowing public petitioners to present public or principled issues to the Court relating to human rights and proper government, even in the absence of a specific petitioner. This is very important in terms of the separation of powers and enables the Supreme Court to fulfill its vital role as a High Court of Justice: examining government actions, defending human rights and the rights of all types of minorities (national, economic, women, religious, political, and others); and ensuring proper administration, a fight against corruption, and administrative propriety.\n\nAccording to the proposed law, the Supreme Court will not be able to hear petitions in which the appellant is not personally injured, or in which the cause of the injury is common to the entire public or to a certain part thereof. In other words: public petitioners will not be able to petition the Supreme Court at all.\n\nThe purpose of the proposed law is to damage the activities of civil society organizations whose agenda is unpopular among the current political majority. Above all, and overtly, the intention is to curtail the work of organizations that represent Palestinians in the Territories, and to prevent them from presenting principles issues to the Court regarding human rights in the Territories. This will damage the rights of the residents of the Territories, for whom the Supreme Court functions as the last defender of their rights as a population under Israeli occupation. More broadly, the amendment will affect all residents and citizens of Israel, whose principled affairs will no longer come before the Court unless a suitable petitioner can be found.\n\nPublic petitioners are important because they present the Court with principled issues that have a broad impact, and do not depend on finding a specific suitable petitioner at a given point in time. It is important to recall that a specific petitioner may not always represent all the types of cases that a principled issue can entail. Moreover, petitioners are sometimes reluctant to present their personal case due to the power imbalance with the authorities and their fear that they will be penalized. In addition, when there is a specific petitioner, the authorities can easily resolve the individual problem without taking a principled decision that will affect all the similar cases.\n\nStatus: the proposed law has not yet been advanced.\n\nProposed Basic Law: The Knesset (amendment – Summons to the Knesset Committees)\n\nThe Knesset Committee is currently discussing the possibility of reforming the relationship between the Knesset and the government. Among various initiatives, it is proposed that the authority of the Knesset committees to summons a wide range of participants to their discussions should be expanded. This applies to office holders and officials in the civil service as well as to private bodies, including office holders and officials in NGOs, public benefit companies, public companies, and cooperative associations.\n\nIt is desirable, and indeed important, that the Knesset committees be empowered to summons office holders and officials from public bodies and from bodies covered by the State Ombudsman. These bodies are obliged to ensure transparency and accountability, and their appearance before the Knesset committees in order to provide information and updates on their policies and implementation is vital in order for the Knesset to play its role in scrutinizing all arms of government,\n\nHowever, ACRI’s position is that the committees should not be empowered to summons private individuals, since this deviates from the Knesset’s function. The Knesset is not empowered to inspect private bodies, except in the case of legislation for the regulation of all the private bodies to which it applies (companies, NGOs, etc.). Failure to meet the provisions of the law incurs administrative or criminal sanctions applied by the relevant enforcement bodies. The Knesset is not a judicial body and does not have the capacity to undertake investigations. If the Knesset believes that the actions of private bodies are harming the public, it can improve the regulation in their regard, including demanding greater transparency and accountability. Naturally, if their activities are illegal, the law enforcement agencies will attend to the matter. Granting authority to summons private bodies to the committees is liable to lead to the abuse of this authority and to the holding of “kangaroo courts” against private bodies in order to gain political or public benefit. In particular, there is reason to fear that this authority will be abused in order to attack NGOs and organizations that are unpopular among the political majority.\n\nProposed Basic Law: Israel – The Nation-State of the Jewish People (P/20/1989), tabled by MK Dichter and Others\n\nThe text of this proposed basic law was amended following extensive public criticism of the wording as initially proposed by MK Dichter, which subjugated Israel’s democratic essence to its definition as a Jewish state. The current bill explicitly declares that Israel will be a Jewish and democratic state. However, the general tone of the bill emphasizes and prioritizes Israel’s Jewish aspects over its democratic ones. There are grounds for concern that the bill (even with the amended wording) may damage the human rights of all Israeli citizens as it erodes the status of democracy in Israel. The bill includes numerous discriminatory provisions and opens the door to instances of racial discrimination in all areas of life.\n\nAn English translation of the bill is available at: https://www.acri.org.il/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/JewishDemocracyBill-English.pdf\n\nThis bill is mentioned in the coalition agreements for the 20th Knesset between the Likud and all the other coalition factions: Kulanu, United Torah Judaism, Shas, and the Jewish Home. The agreement with Kulanu notes that all the factions must agree to the promotion of this bill and to its content.\n\nSimilar bills were tabled in the previous Knessets, and additional private bills were tabled during the current Knesset on the same theme:\n\nProposed Basic Law: Israel – The Nation State of the Jewish People, tabled by the Yisrael Beitenu faction (P/20/1337): for the text of the bill (in Hebrew), see: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/1337.rtf\n\nProposed Basic Law: Israel – The Nation State of the Jewish People, tabled by MK Magal (P/20/1990): identical to the Yisrael Beitenu bill; see the Hebrew text of the bill: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/1337.rtf\n\nProposed Basic Law: The State of Israel, tabled by MK Begin (P/20/1587): See the Hebrew text of the bill: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/1587.rtf\n\nStatus: The Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved the bills, which were then forwarded to a special ministerial committee that will discuss the proposals and reach agreements in the coalition. The bills have not yet been promoted.\n\nACRI’s position: https://www.acri.org.il/en/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Basic-Law-Jewish-State-ACRI-position-ENG.pdf\n\nBills concerning the Disqualification of Members of Knesset\n\nSeveral bills were tabled in the previous Knesset with the goal of facilitating the process of disqualifying Members of Knesset. Although the bills are phrased in neutral language, it is obvious that they are directed primarily at Members of Knesset from the Arab minority.\n\nACRI’s position is that the disqualification or suspension of Members of Knesset violates the right to elect and to be elected, which is a fundamental constitutional right in a democratic system. Above all, this right allows individuals to express their views and ideas freely in accordance with the freedom of expression, and to associate freely in order to promote these views. Moreover, the suspension of Members of Knesset restricts the diversity of opinions, and may lead to the exclusion of entire groups – by restricting the presentation of their worldview, and in terms of their actual participation in the democratic process; as they may not wish to participate in if their position is not represented.\n\nSince disqualification harms fundamental rights and has far-reaching ramifications for democracy and individual rights, it should be employed only in extreme and unambiguous instances; and less extreme steps should be preferred whenever possible.\n\n1) Proposed Basic Law: The Knesset (Amendment – Burden of Proof of Support for an Armed Struggle against the State of Israel) (P/20/1407)\n\nThis bill, tabled by MKs Ilatov, Levi-Abekasis, Amar, and Gal, seeks to extend the grounds for the disqualification of Members of Knesset to include statements as well as actions. The bill also imposes the burden of proof on the candidate.\n\nSee the Hebrew text of the bill:\n\nhttp://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/1407.rtf\n\nStatus: The bill was rejected by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation and subsequently tabled again by the entire Yisrael Beitenu faction (P/20/2226).\n\n2) Proposed Basic Law: The Knesset (Amendment – Removing the Authority of the Supreme Court to Intervene in a Decision of the Central Elections Committee regarding the Approval or Disqualification of a Candidate or List for Participation in Elections) (P/20/2172)\n\nThis bill, tabled by the Yisrael Beitenu faction, seeks to grant the Central Elections Committee exclusive authority to disqualify candidates or lists for participation in the Knesset elections. The bill removes the Supreme Court’s authority to intervene, thereby preventing judicial review.\n\nSee the Hebrew text of the bill: http://knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/20/2172.rtf\n\nStatus: The Ministerial Committee for Legislation discussed the bill on 22 November 2015 and decided to forward it to the Coalition Executive for a decision. The bill has not been promoted yet.\n\n3) Basic Law: The Knesset (Amendment 44); Knesset Law (Amendment 43) 2016 – Impeachment of Members of Knesset\n\nThe bill, which was the initiative of the Prime Minister, sought to give Members of Knesset (MK) the authority to suspend other Members of Knesset. The final version of the law stipulates that 70 serving MKs (10 of whom must be from the Opposition) can commence proceedings to dismiss a Member of Knesset if that person encourages terrorism or incitement to violence, which is determined by the Knesset Committee. In accordance with the Committee’s decision, the Knesset can decide by a majority vote of 90 MKs to dismiss the MK. The MK can appeal to the Supreme Court. The law does not apply during election periods.\n\nACRI’s position is that the suspension of Members of Knesset by political bodies will lead to the exclusion of political rivals by illegitimate means. This is a clear instance of the tyranny of the majority, whereby the political majority exploits its strength against a political minority. In this context, it should be taken into account that in a country with a permanent Arab political minority, as well as many other rifts, the proposal is liable to cause the permanent exclusion of entire sectors from the political system.\n\nStatus: The bill was passed on 19 July 2016 following second and third readings in the Plenum.\n\nFor the Hebrew text of the Law: https://www.acri.org.il/he/37480\n\nFor ACRI’s position: https://www.acri.org.il/en/wp-content\n\n/uploads/2016/02/Suspension-of-MKs-0216.pdf\n\n“The Muezzin Law” – Prevention of Hazards Bill (Amendment – Prevention of Noise from a PA System in a House of Prayer), 2016, tabled by MKs Motti Yogev and David Bitan – P/3590/20; Prevention of Hazards Bill (Amendment – Prohibition on the Use of a PA System in Houses of Prayer), 2015, tabled by MKs Robert Elituv and Oded Forer – P/2316/20.\n\nThis bill seeks to restrict the use of loudspeakers by the muezzin in a mosque during the early morning hours. The original bill sought to prohibit completely the use of loudspeakers above a certain volume. However, ultra-Orthodox MKs opposed this proposal, fearing that it would include the sirens that announce the beginning of the Sabbath. Accordingly, the amended bill states that it will apply only between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Since the Prevention of Hazards Bill already addresses noise hazards, the sole purpose of the bill appears to be the desire to exclude and offend the Muslim population in Israel by attacking its religious and national symbols, thereby exacerbating the sense of discrimination and inequality. While ACRI recognizes the need to curtail noise hazards, it is important to show special sensitivity toward the sources of noise addressed in the bill. Dialogue should always be preferred to the enforcement of discriminatory and racist laws and to the imposition of laws that offend the religious sentiments of certain groups – particularly in the case of a religious or national minority.\n\nStatus: The bill was passed at its Preliminary Reading on 8 March 2017."
