        "text": "The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan has long been used as an opportunity for imperialistic intervention by the Zionist entity.\n\nFollowing the second Karabakh war in 2020, three districts of the breakaway Artsakh Republic, which is predominantly ethnically Armenian, were taken by Azerbaijan.\n\nEach borders the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Zionist entity has wasted no time in infiltrating these areas via agricultural companies active in the so-called smart villages project.\n\nThe potential for spying and surveillance this opens up is significant.\n\nZionist Agriculture Minister Oded Forer visited the first smart village in May 2022, reportedly the highest official to come that close to the Iranian border since the Revolution.\n\nSpying concerns are heightened by the cooperation between Zionist University Technion, and the Azerbaijani Ministry of Digital Development and Transport, to establish the Azerbaijani Cyber Security Center in Baku in March this year.\n\nThis is clearly intended to serve as a subversive lever to further Zionist foreign policy priorities. Trainees will be indoctrinated in Zionist subversion techniques and awarded a certificate by the Technion.\n\nDespite recruiting some 50,000 to 70,000 Azeri Jews to become colonists in Palestine, Azerbaijan continues to welcome significant arms supplies from the Zionist entity including drones and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn return, Azerbaijan also supplies some 40% of Israels oil imports. Recent Zionist overtures have included the visit of Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz to Baku in October 2022, the opening of the Azerbaijani embassy in Tel Aviv in April this year, and the visit of Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen to Baku in the same month.\n\nDuring a joint press conference with his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov at the opening ceremony for the Azerbaijani embassy in Israel, Cohen announced that he agreed with Bayramov in forming a united front against Iran.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned in response that Iran \"cannot remain indifferent\" to the \"conspiracy\" of Israel against it \"from the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan\".\n\nRecent tensions between Azerbaijan and Iran as a result of Zionist imperial meddling suggest the Zionist entity is preparing for a potential proxy war."
