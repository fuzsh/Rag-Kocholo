        "text": "On Wednesday, MK Ahmad Tibi (Hadash-Ta’al) took the Knesset podium to chastise his opponents who are in the process of collecting the necessary signatures to remove Tibi’s fellow faction member, MK Ofer Cassif, over his recent pro-Hamas and anti-Israel statements (Israel Beitenu Seeking 70 Signatures to Dismiss Hadash-Ta’al MK Ofer Cassif).\n\n“How quickly about 80 MKs signed a petition to impeach an MK without a legal foundation,” MK Tibi said, noting that “according to legal opinions, this is meaningless.”\n\n“You failed to get those MKs to sign off on forcing the government to immediately release the hostages as part of negotiations,” Tibi taunted the Jewish MKs in the plenum.\n\nTo which MK Oded Forer (Israel Beitenu), who initiated the petition, retorted: “Ask your friends in Hamas to release them.”\n\nAfter the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, Tibi was appointed adviser on Israeli affairs to Yasser Arafat, who was appointed chairman of the Palestinian Authority. In November 1996, Tibi described his relationship with Arafat: “All my moves are carried out according to his instructions. I believe he has confidence in me, and I hope I justify it.” In 1998, Tibi served as the spokesman for the PA delegation at Wye Plantation talks.\n\nThe 1951 MKs’ Immunity Law grants members of the Knesset immunity from prosecution on criminal acts or civil wrongs that were committed while performing their duties.
