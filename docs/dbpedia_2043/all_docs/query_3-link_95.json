        "text": "Israel of all people should understand what is going on here: Everyone in this cultural circle is familiar with the story of David and Goliath, as the troubles and commotions in this cultural circle has been documented since the beginning of time (Ad). The question of a two-state solution as suggested, even in its simplest form it is questionable wether it will have soothing effect on the public spirit. It is not likely. It is this sort of political fast food conceptual thinking that has led us to todays chaos. It is understandable that many officials in today's situations are caught on the wrong foot and therefore non-communicate on essential security issues. No matter how much one supports Israel's right to land or not, and in the complex of accords, charters and international agreements that can justify creating a new state like Israel - there are very few people who can stand behind Israel's decision to run a military bulldoze strategy across Gaza and demolish an area of land where more than half of the population is below 14 years of age. Surveys in Israel also show that even there every second citizen is against a ground offensive that jeopardizes the livelihood for civilians from humanitarian reasons. The announcements from both the EU, European states, the US and several presidents from are also setting the tone as an ordinary feed-back burger for Israel's leadership - two good messages in a bun: We support you, you have the right to self-protection - but it is not in order to kill a million children in the Gaza Strip. Down to earth - 224 people have been kidnapped and a few thousand have died over a period of a few days. The retaliatory attack has taken the rest of the calendar month and up to 1/3 of the territory leveled to the ground - we know and understand that both Jews and Arabs are bad losers and that since 1947 there has mostly or only been Jewish progress, and it is humiliating suddenly to get an ear fig. This strategy cannot be played successfully by Israel - which has received a reality call - and all allies have been busy constructing feed-back buns that both support Israel in general and hold the hand over millions of citizens in Gaza. The UN could structure the conditions for the population groups to live in harmony in the same union, but under the same cultural and political state society with a common president. The political structures are already grown on the Westbanks and Jerusalem has historically been a multiethnic society. Presumably a form of governmental administration after the Swiss blueprint would work fine, with cantons - Samaria, Judea, Jezreel, Golan etc. Independent city government and political autonomy for both groups in a conventional form - Jews and Palestinians - but under a common president and government with democratic joint elections - and a common domestic policy so that in the long run we can avoid society being repeatedly razed to the ground. #dejavue #destruction #ruin #idfhamas\n\n#analysis: Why China became more popular than US in Africa #excerpt May 07, 2024 China's economic engagement with Africa has been extensive and impactful. Unlike the US, which often links its assistance and investment to political conditions such as human rights or governance standards, China focuses solely on economic cooperation. https://lnkd.in/d-vQV-bt #perspective Collective West needs to ask themselves tough questions; as what they are doing in the Horn of Africa; If by sponsoring a hate campaign again Hebrew Israelites population has strengthen western hegemony or weakened US influence. During the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885; what today is Collective West resolved to hunt down scattered Israelites, eliminate and erase their clans from history. To maintain the lie of Isreal being White; Western agencies have a policy of 'profiling Luo groups as dangerous'; as a result the Luo body is denigrated by the state, stripped of its life, and has been at the receiving end of state brutality, time and time again. To maintain a chokehold around the neck of Luos, the West has designed a business around the dehuminization of Luo groups. There are 35,000 NGOs spread around Luo settlements, crippling the Luo with fear in the guise of health care support and promotion of democracy, all in the name of Supersessionism, also called replacement theology, a western doctrine that the Collective West has superseded Hebrew Israelites, assuming their role as God's covenanted people, thus asserting that the New Covenant through Western Hegemony has superseded or replaced the Mosaic covenant. The West has poured all malign activity in Kenya, through Elite capital and propaganda to maginalize the Luo; April 5, 2019 — Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) operating in Nyanza region received Sh45 billion from donors last year, a report has revealed. https://lnkd.in/dxfSd2XZ NGOs are tasked with spreading lies that the Luo spread diseases and a violent; it has been so bad for Luos, the Chinese and Iranians warned against targeting the Luo; who happen to be Persian Jews, and also royalty of Chinese Tartary. March 3, 2020 Worrying that Luo Nyanza tops HIV list 2 decades on Although there was reduction in new infections, statistics on HIV prevalence are significant. https://lnkd.in/dw-P336z 2018-03-07 The high HIV infection rates that have been reported in Nyanza region are exaggerated, fresh data presented at an international conference in Boston, US, shows. https://lnkd.in/dkyJydjT The West made the Luo afraid, Elders called for 'Liet', a Lifeboat ( Yahweh we are afraid...) Now they are Praying. The US and UK are 300 years old combined; they will see challenges they cannot put their hands on; the isolation they planned for Luos will happen to them. Zechariah 2:8 of His eye— KJV For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.\n\nFor far too many years, Jewish communities worldwide have endured the distressing surge of Anti-Semitic vilification, exacerbated by the recurring cycle of terrorism casting its ominous shadow over Israel. The attacks on October 7th swiftly transformed from a targeted assault against the Jewish population in the beautiful Kibbutzim on the Gaza border, to a broader assault on Jews throughout the Western world. The alarming reality of a 400%+ increase in Anti-Semitism within a span of 7 weeks is deeply unsettling. It heartens me to witness influential business leaders in our country recognising the gravity of this issue and committing to eradicate anti-Semitism. The Jewish community has consistently stood at the vanguard of innovation and business leadership on a global scale. By undertaking this pledge, you are not only denouncing hatred but also contributing to the flourishing of our economy, the sustainability of our ecosystem, and the overall betterment of our world. As an Australian Director of Israel's most active venture capital firm, the daily impact of the rising anti-Semitic rhetoric is palpable. This pledge, long overdue, brings a ray of hope and solidarity to our collective effort to combat intolerance and prejudice. Sign the pledge here: https://lnkd.in/gh5--tHE Dan Bennett, Jonathan Medved, Alon Tal, Josh Wolff, Geoff Levy AO, David Shein, Michelle Blum, Paul Israel, OurCrowd, Jerry S., Laurence Schwartz, Gilad Silverstein, Shir Dekel, Ph.D, Zachary Forrai\n\nI was surprised, at how a marginalized community like Jews are ruling the world with their intellect, especially in the tech world Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Dell, Michael Bloomberg, and Larry Page are all heads and founders who belong to the Jewish community This community suffered a lot during World War II and efforts were made by the whole world to save them After World War II, there was growing international support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland. The United Nations approved the partition plan for a territory which was governed by Britishers named Palestine in 1947, which called for the division of the territory into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem under international administration. Jewish immigrants began migrating to Palestine in increasing numbers in the years leading up to 1948. This Jewish immigration played a critical role in the establishment of Israel. Finally, on May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared the establishment of the State of Israel. The establishment of Israel, however, led to conflicts with the Arab populations in the region, resulting in a series of Arab-Israeli wars To date, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a deeply complex and contentious issue with no easy solution But economically and influentially Israel is far ahead of Palestine According to the IMF, Israel has a GDP of US$564 billion and its GDP per capita at US$58,270 in 2023. As per the world report, Israel is one of the 10 most powerful, politically influential, and 4th strongest militarily in the world behind Russia, the US, and China. Israel is the only Jewish nation in the world and a small country on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. For its relatively small size, the country has played a large role in global affairs. The country has a strong economy, landmarks of significance to several religions, and strained relationships with many of its Arab neighbours. In my latest video, ( https://lnkd.in/dUuvtePF) I will dive deep into the Israel-Palestine conflict\n\n2023-Nov-08 `An authentic democracy cannot be psychopathic because most people are not psychopaths. Most people would not vote to kill, wound and displace hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians for power, profit or territorial gain. Most people do not accept the great lie of ‘pragmatism’: that ‘the anarchical society’ of international relations mandates psychopathic violence: If ‘we’ don’t behave as psychopaths, somebody else will. Most people don’t believe the world can be divided between Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ‘children of light’ and ‘children of darkness’. You don’t need to be a mystic to know that love, kindness, compassion – ‘light’ – arise naturally in all human beings allowed to live in freedom and peace. We know from our own experience that we are wonderfully happy when overflowing with love and desperately miserable when overflowing with hate. We know, therefore, that love is suited to human nature and well-being in a way that hatred is certainly not. We know that when hate arises in large numbers of people it is born of suffering, not of some ‘evil’ disposition. We know that the real answer to hate is not violence but justice that alleviates suffering and hate. Because we are not psychopathic, it is deeply important for us to believe that we are not living in a psychopathic society. When this human need clashes with political reality, examples of cognitive dissonance abound – psychopathic circles have to be squared, 2 + 2 must make 5. This is the task of the propaganda system comprised of the ‘respectable’ political, media and religious institutions of our society... From satellite imagery, The Economist estimated (30 October) that ‘over a tenth of Gaza’s housing stock has been destroyed, leaving more than 280,000 people without homes to which they can return’. The magazine noted: ‘Even Russia, during its siege of Mariupol in Ukraine between February and May 2022, negotiated humanitarian pauses in which some civilians were permitted to leave. Israel has thus far rejected calls, by the European Union and others, for such pauses’... According to the World Health Organisation, there have been more than 100 strikes on health facilities. Since 7 October, more than 200 schools have been damaged in Gaza – around 40% of the total number – about forty of them very seriously, according to UNICEF data. By any standards, this is an awesome level of destruction. In its first 563 days, Russia’s war on Ukraine killed 9,614 Ukrainian civilians, 554 of them children. In its first 25 days, Israel’s war on Gaza killed 8,796 Palestinian civilians, 3,648 of them children. Since the 7 October attacks by Hamas, at least 1,400 Israelis have been killed, including 1,033 civilians and 31 children.` https://lnkd.in/duCk-sZW\n\n\"The #Palestinians have been dehumanised to such an extent that their executioners are deeply convinced that their violent acts are not just morally justified but also noble, and they must take pride in their “good work”.\" #violence and #war : And we thought #internet's access would democratise #information flow and #democracy itself. Replace \" Palestinians \" with any other country's citizens and one would recognise what's going on. Instead 1. New breed of #demagoguery is promoted by \"so called leaders\"of Democracies and ( of course ) autocracies. We would have to put a sign of reversibility between Democracy ⇆Autocracy . These so called leaders are definitely , 100% Older males of humanity. [ Sometimes I feel a deep sense of discomfort in being a male , knowing what #atrocities our Gender has done for centuries, specially on the other gender /s and children. 2. New breed of Young, Unread #hatemongers , who unlike previous generation never suffered any cruelty , famine , disrespect or / and any financial insufficiency, spewing hatred day in and day out against \" others \" ( defined as anyone disagreeing with them ). For example , young #Indians addicted to almost free internet ( also given to distract hugely #unemployed younger generation) hate \" others\" based on free #whatsapp [ It was invented to connect but single handedly bevo e the Vocano of hate ] 3. Deliver misinformation and twist facts. Huge penetrations of internet riding on cheap plans for mobiles have tusamied-in unnecessary and unconnected facts to usher and era of #alternativetruth or Lies. 4. Somewhere buried under this tsunami and ashes of the hate-volcano is the truth of that country, civilisation , history and people. So what can be done. Same internet can be used by real humaneness to spread i) Training for New Era jobs like #circulareconomy ii) Connect #industries & jobseekers iii) Make people aware of adverse effects of #climatechange and #mitigation and adjustment of general human living to the new natural fact iv) revolutonise #foodsystems #agriculture and the way we consume food itself, make all these #sustainable. If we use the internet to spread #equality in things and thinking and live with #mothernature in #equanimity , wars and violence will reduce ( Cannot go for utopian thought of humans without violence ). What do you think ?\n\nThe State of Israel is unsustainable. It was cracking apart prior to October 7 over a fundamental issue of identity - is it to be a liberal democracy that upholds the rule of law, or will it become a theocratic fundamentalist regime of the kind that is common throughout the Middle East. All the movement, prior to October 7, was towards the latter. Talk of large-scale emigration from Israel by its younger, more secular, often tech-skilled demographic, was widespread. Since October 7, this crack in Israeli society has become a chasm. This is a deeper question than whether a military response to Hamas was justified and what form it might take, it is now a question about whether the Israeli state project (#Zionism) can survive in the medium to long-term. The old #EastGermany with its walled and segregated city of #Berlin was a surveillance state, held together by vast internal resources devoted to surveillance and control, propped up financially and militarily by an external superpower (the USSR). It couldn't be sustained. #Israel is also a surveillance and control state. Vast military resources are devoted to monitoring its borders, policing its occupied populations, incarcerating detained Palestinians, sustaining global intelligence infrastructure and feeding an activist diaspora. It, too, is propped up financially and military by a patron superpower. It can't be sustained in this form. ___ In truth, the State of Israel was never going to be sustainable. Many Jewish and Palestinian voices warned in 1948 that peace and security would be elusive. The forced evacuation and resettlement of Palestinians from their ancestral homes was always going to sow deep seeds of resentment and hostility. But in the wake of the Nazi atrocities, the international community was driven by guilt over the 6m dead, and rushed headlong into establishing a State of Israel without considering what would happen to the Palestinians (Christians and Muslims), who had lived in villages and towns with Jewish people for centuries. This was a tragic mistake. If there had been no #Jewish and #Palestinian voices warning the world in 1948 that this would be a tragic mistake, then we might perhaps excuse the international community for its naivete, or, its blindness to the Palestinians. But the world had been warned. Traumatised people often react to their trauma by inflicting injury on others; abused children often grow up to become abusers themselves. Assigning a State of their own to an ethno-religious community with the Holocaust experience was always going to produce an intensely exclusivist outlook towards Others. The poor Palestinians just had the misfortune to be born in the wrong place at the wrong time. The result, 75 years on, is #genocide in Gaza. ___ There was an alternative in 1948 - a shared homeland for Jewish and Palestinian people, Christian and Muslim, in a multi-ethnic, multi-faith state with equal rights for all. That is still the only alternative in 2023."
