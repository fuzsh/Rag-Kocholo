        "text": "Criticism of Israel often intersects with antisemitic myths and symbols. You may come across hurtful, hateful cartoons depicting wealthy Jews or suggesting that Israel manipulates global politics from behind the scenes. The use of such images and symbols perpetuates the long history of antisemitism.\n\nOpposing the policies of the Israeli government or advocating for the rights of Palestinians is not inherently antisemitic. Nevertheless, engaging in conversation or critical debate about Israel has become increasingly challenging. Positions have hardened, and emotions run high, especially when tensions in the region rise.\n\nA line is undeniably crossed when Israel’s right to exist contested or when Israel is likened to Nazi Germany. Comments such as, “What Israel is doing to the Palestinians now is the same as the Nazis’ systematic extermination of Jews during the Second World War” are not only inappropriate and inaccurate but also antisemitic. Although the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has claimed many victims on both sides, it cannot be compared to systemic extermination.\n\nHolding Jews individually or collectively responsible for Israel’s policies and actions is also a form of antisemitism. No one is personally responsible for the deeds of their compatriots or fellow believers, or for governmental policies."
