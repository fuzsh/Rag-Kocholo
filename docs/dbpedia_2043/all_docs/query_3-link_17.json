        "text": "ISRAELI Knesset member Ofer Cassif of the Communist Party of Israel was today targeted for removal from office after signing a petition accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThis comes ahead of the case against Israel being spearheaded by the South African government at the International Court of Justice later this week.\n\nMr Cassif, the sole Jewish MK in the predominantly Arab Hadash-Ta’al coalition which includes the Communist Party, said on Sunday: “My constitutional duty is to Israeli society and all of its residents, not to a government whose members and its coalition are calling for ethnic cleansing and even actual genocide.\n\n“They are the ones who hurt the country and the people, they are the ones who led South Africa to turn to The Hague, not me and my friends.\n\n“I will not give up the fight for our existence as a moral society. This is true patriotism.”\n\nBut on Monday, Oded Forer, of the Yisrael Beytenu party, said Mr Cassif “chose, during wartime, to join one of the most destructive initiatives for the state of Israel’s security, thus supporting Hamas’s war against Israel.”\n\nHe said that he had begun to collect the necessary 70 signatures from members to remove Mr Cassif, saying: “It would be best if he were also outside the borders of the state of Israel.”"
