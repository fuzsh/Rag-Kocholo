        "text": "Members of the new coalition call it “fully right-wing”, “truly right-wing”, or simply “national government”. The coalition mem­bers consist of Likud (32 seats), the two parties of the Haredim, frequently de­scribed as “ultra-orthodox” – Shas (11) and United Torah Judaism (UTJ, 7) – as well as the radical party alliance Religious Zionism (14), which consists of the epony­mous party Otzma Yehudit and the micro-party Noam. All parties come from the right-wing, anti-liberal camp. In Israel, the party political classification into “left” and “right” takes place along the axes of op­posing views on the conflict with the Pales­tinians and the identity of the state; the socio-economic dimension is subordinate to this.\n\nThe aim of this coalition is to resolve in advance these central controversies that shape Israeli society. This applies both to the conflict with the Palestinians and to the – in their view too liberal – image of the state and its institutions. The anti-liberal impetus here is directed against the central features of liberal democracy (and not against economic liberalism), that is, against the normative anchoring of human rights and the associated control of parlia­ment by an independent judiciary. In con­trast, the new Israeli government aims to establish a majoritarian democracy and regards such restrictions as an illegitimate curtailment of the democratic process.\n\nThe new coalition is not an accident. Already with the first of the five elections since 2019, the possibility of a right-wing coalition that could fundamentally change Israel had emerged. This is the result of a political transformation in the country that began to gain momentum in 2015: A right-wing majority became entrenched in parlia­ment, the right-wing mainstream became radicalised, and it abolished all barriers to right-winged extremist parties, which in turn resulted in the legitimisation of the extreme fringe of the political spectrum.\n\nOutlook\n\nNetanyahu has expressed in various inter­views that there is no need to worry about the radicals in his cabinet because he has the decision-making power in the government. However, developments in recent weeks do not indicate that he is currently able or willing to exercise his moderating influence. Rather, this government seems willing to make the state of Israel much more illiberal and to set a decisive course to keep the West Bank permanently under Israeli control.\n\nFor German foreign policy, this Israeli government presents a challenge. Against the backdrop of its historical responsibility on the one hand, and its commitment to universal principles such as international and human rights on the other, Germany has so far advocated for a two-state solu­tion. However, the hope that Israeli viola­tions of international law could prospectively cease as a result of a solution to the conflict is completely unrealistic when con­sidering the current government, which is, after all, an expression of a longer-term trend. On the contrary, this government intends to make a two-state solution im­possible.\n\nIf Germany wants to play a meaningful and constructive part in the conflict be­tween Israelis and Palestinians, it must adapt to this situation. This includes work­ing preventively in concert with the United States and the European Union, and also with some Arab states, to avoid an escala­tion of violence. This also applies to con­crete settlement construction projects and the displacement of Palestinians from the part of the West Bank completely controlled by Israel (Area C) and Jerusalem. In general, German policy should be concerned with exploring how a negotiated conflict settle­ment can be maintained and what mea­sures should be considered for this.\n\nBut the profile of the new Israeli govern­ment raises even more fundamental ques­tions: What would the German position on the conflict be if it should become clear that a two-state solution is no longer pos­sible? The question of the extent to which an occupation – which by definition must be temporary – can still be legitimate under international law when it is clear that the occupiers do not want to leave the territory must also be discussed. Ultimately, a process of introspection is needed to deter­mine what a German-Israel policy could look like against this background – a pro­cess in which neither the responsibilities arising from the historical legacy nor the fundamental values of German foreign policy are abandoned."
