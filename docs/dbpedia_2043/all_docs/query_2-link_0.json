        "text": "This week I participated in the policy conference of the Elnet organization - The European leadership network. In recent years, the organization has become an important promoter of Israel's status in Europe. This year, following the new government's policy, the challenge has become more difficult. After I heard the words of high-tech entrepreneur, Eyal Waldman, I became more worried. Eyal described the challenges that the crisis in Israel creates for the industry. But, yet, I succeeded to find some hope in his words - if the state of Israel returns to a sane policy of a democratic and free country, invests in education for excellence, then we have a chance to continue to be the leaders of the world high-tech industry. There are wonderful entrepreneurs in Israel that need to know that Israel will remain a free country. We have a young generation that we are obligated to give them the tools for advanced world, therefore we must upgrade our education system. We must not give up on an entire generation that today is prevented from learning science, math and English. In 20 years, Israel will need them. Right now, we have a government that is working in the opposite direction, but we will change that. We will put Israel back on track and give hope to a young generation that will return to believe in Israel as the land of unlimited possibilities. ELNET (France) elnet Sani Sanilevich Eyal Waldman"
