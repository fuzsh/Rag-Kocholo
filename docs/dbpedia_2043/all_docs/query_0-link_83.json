        "text": "These profound words, articulated by Shimon Peres (former President of Israel), encapsulates the sentiment in this country right now. I had pleasure of seeing the legend, now a 92 year old, address an elated crowd at the TEDx White City event in Tel Aviv last month. It was extraordinary to witness his positive spirit and even more poignant now, during the current wave of violence that has been plaguing the region.\n\nThe past month or so in Israel has been challenging. Calls for a near intifada have circulated, and my personal level of safety was put at compromise. You may read this in Australia and ponder, why would one consciously choose to live in a reality like this? Fast forward a few weeks and I receive the news that my father living in a relatively quiet neighbourhood in Melbourne, was attacked by two young boys outside our family home. So I sit back, totally flabbergasted by what happened to my dad, whilst sipping a latte at my favourite coffee shop in Jaffa, and consider… is it really that much more dangerous to live in Israel?\n\nTo be an Israeli is to live with this feeling of ‘survivability’ and this is the key to understanding the utter success of this amazing start-up nation. Israel is testament to the proof of how throughout difficult times, one strives harder in order to survive. In the backdrop of a political quagmire, the care in the streets for one another is a feeling that cannot be expressed.\n\nFor example, I was riding my bike through the gushing rain a few weeks back, at night, a random girl standing next to me at the traffic light turned to me and said, “please come under the umbrella with me so you don’t get even more wet”. I walk home another night and see thousands of people running through the streets for the augural ‘Nike Tel Aviv Night Run’, during a time where they say it’s not so safe to be out. The positive attitude in Israel is is mind-blowing.\n\nPeople live on, try not to focus on the prevailing attacks and rather choose to revert their attention to create the next big ‘Waze’, to be bought out by Google.\n\nTEDX WHITE CITY TEL AVIV\n\nIsrael has also taken to the exciting movement known as ‘TED’. My first TED event was at Burning Man last year, so it I was pretty enthused to be attending another one in my beloved Tel Aviv! Along with some friends, I spent a full day on the Tel Aviv Port listening to numerous speakers pitch an idea for 20 minutes. From a freelance photographer, Middle Eastern Social Media expert, a talk about ‘making politics sexy’ an amazing initiative called TOM – Which Stands for Tikkun Olam (saving the world) Makers and so much more. It was an insightful day and everybody in the hall left with a feeling of hope for this country. Hope through innovation….\n\nWORKING AT THE AICC\n\nThe past month I have had the pleasure of working at the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, under the amazing Paul Israel. In preparation for the Young Entrepreneurs Innovation Mission, I had been manoeuvring from coffee shop to coffee shop, meeting to meeting, to assist in organising the best possible experience for the amazing delegation that were about the come. Little did I know what I was in for, or the opportunity that was presented to me…\n\nTHE MISSION\n\nPeople were arriving, meetings were prolific and the energy was rising in Tel Aviv.\n\nBefore the Mission had officially begun I had the honour of accompanying Tim Smith, member for Kew (in Victoria), to meetings in the Israeli Knesset (Parliament). It was an afternoon to remember. It turned out that MK Oded Forer’s father was from the same small village as my grandparents in Poland called Bendzin. Yoav Kischh, MK, had to run out of our meeting mid-way to vote alongside Bibi (Israeli Prime Minister). We also met 31 year old Sharren Hassel – impressive young lady, who had lived in Australia and felt a strong connection to our country and making a difference.\n\nDay one started shopping at Zara, putting on my ‘sales assistant hat’ and helping some of the delegates find appropriate clothes due to some ‘luggage problems’. We visited Pitango, one of Israel’s top Venture Capital (VC) fund, and attention was grabbed by Chemi Peres, Managing General Partner and Co-Founder, also the son of Simon Peres. “Be optimistic long term with technology not short term. ”he advised.\n\nWe had drinks that night at the Ambassador of Australia’s home in Hertzliya filled with interesting guests and a topical speaker. I had a fun night out with some of the gang, visiting a favourite bar of mine, Kuli Alma, and giving them of taste of this electric city.\n\nWe were up bright and early the next morning heading south for the commemoration of the 98th Battle of Be’er Sheva- the site where the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) gave their lives in 1917 for a ‘better world’. I had shivers standing here so many years later, and singing both the Australian and Israel anthem, back-to back, alongside delegates, diplomats, family members and other Australians & New Zealanders who had made the trip for this important occasion.\n\nFollowing the service, we then make our way to the golden city of Jerusalem, to grab some lunch and a quick tour before the Shabbat came in. We visited the Great Synagogue and have a beautiful dinner at our hotel, where the guests learned about the Jewish traditions and enjoyed a delicious Shabbat meal.\n\nBack on the bus the next morning, this time to visit the breathtaking Masada followed by the ever so enjoyable Dead Sea.\n\nIt was highly entertaining floating with 40 people on a gorgeous Autumn’s day. What was not so riveting was filling my face with mud and stupidly rinsing off in the salty water. Not recommended!\n\nReturning back to Jerusalem, we joined a rowdy gang of Aussies and Kiwis at the UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organization) to watch the Rugby World Cup. Whilst most were cheering enthusiastically, I got into some heated political conversations (perhaps it was Israeli beer talking).\n\nSunday morning was heavy at Yad Vashem (Holocaust Memorial), with an unforgettable ceremony at the Hall of Remembrance.\n\nWe then visited Hebrew University and had a sensational dinner at the Moroccan favourite Darna, where Saul Singer, author of the famous Start Up Nation gave us an address. A highly engaged crowd listened to him talk about how complimentary Australia is to Israel and conversations were brewing as a result.\n\nOther highlights of the week included; an exciting visit to Teva Pharmaceuticals, a visit to Technion, one of Israel’s most prestigious universities specialising in technology and science, and sitting at a board table listening to Avi Hason, Israel’s Chief Scientist,“Inventions don’t matter, entrepreneurship does”. His wise words got me thinking. Any of us can have an idea, but if you don’t implement it is just a concept,right? One thing Israelis know how to do too well is to deliver. The final reception at Bank Leumi was inspiring with lots of great networking for all. The night kicked on at a Georgian hot spot – Nanuchka, and if you have visited this spot, need I say more!\n\nThe final day, we listened to two entrepreneurs speak from WMN – a co-working space for women entrepreneurs, which exists to bridge the gender gap in the startup ecosystem. Totally inspiring!\n\nWe had a stimulating lunch at one of the top Israeli law firms, Yigal Arnon and left with a brief understanding of the tech industry from a legal perspective.\n\nWe ended off at South Tel Aviv’s coolest co-working space SOSA, and had the most meaningful end to the delegation on the rooftop, whereby each participant and staff member had their 2 minutes of fame to talk about their personal experience.\n\nWyatt Roy the Assistant Minister of Innovation in Australia and co-leader of the delegation alongside Marita Cheng (Robogals), conveyed in the in Times of Israel, “I think Australia and Israel are a more natural partnership than Australia and Silicon Valley. We both have strong anti-authoritarian streaks, ‘chutzpah’ and ‘rosh gadol’ (thinking big)”.\n\nUndoubtedly, a hugely successful mission for both Israel and Australia.\n\nWORK HARD, PLAY HARD\n\nWhilst it has been a crazy month or so of work with the chamber, I have also managed to have my own sort of fun too. Visits from friends, wining and dining, Shabbat with the diplomats from around the world, Brit Milla (circumcision) party, hosting meals on my rooftop and a sneaky night out here and there, because I am living in the city that never sleeps.\n\nOne weekend, my friends and I set up camp on the beach in Maayan Zvi, an hour north of Tel Aviv. It was sensational! We set up on the sand; lay in the still, cool sea as the sun went down; gathered wood for the campfire and welcomed in the Shabbat. Dinner was a traditional ‘Poike’ which is a stew cooked in a round cast iron over a hot flame. Ingredients include potatoes, vegetables, rice, chicken, wine, beer, coca cola, rice, almonds and more. The two-hour participation was well worth the wait.\n\nOn the way back to Tel Aviv we stopped off in Furedeis, an Arab village with mouth watering humus.\n\nFor yet another meaningful Shabbat, friends and I threw a feast for my friend’s birthday in Tel Aviv – giving Yotam Ottelenghi a sure run for his money. Research for the meal included a thrilling food shop, dancing in the puddles of rain in Carmel Market. We sung the welcomed in Shabbat with a makeshift service in the Kerem Hatermanim (Yemen Quarter) and stayed up matching wine with political debates until 4:30am, with the most diverse bunch of Melbournians.\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nAmanda’s Jerusalem (or shall I say Israel Journey) had ended for now, I will return very soon to continue working and living in this miraculous country. As the lady at the airport said to me upon attempting to get my V.A.T. back, “I am sorry, you are not a tourist”. I smile, thank her for the compliment and continue on my way.\n\nI have decided to end my series of blog posts here for now, with a few final thoughts..\n\nFirstly, I challenge each one of you who has a passion or idea to write a blog. It has enriched my experience and enabled me to connect to people on a level I would not have dreamed possible. I would like to thank my editors, Noah Picholtz and Natasha Gammell for guiding me; correcting my sentences, some of which simply didn’t make sense, and adding your extra touch to each piece. To my loyal readers, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for coming on this journey with me. For the comments, messages and conversations it has sparked, I am grateful. Please continue to send them through (or if you are in Melbourne hit me up for a coffee).\n\nIsrael is a country that just keeps giving. If you have learnt a thing or two from my posts, know not to be fooled by the often misleading comments in the media, instead focus on the astronomical success of this tiny country.\n\nMore than the holiness of this place, the rich history, the chutzpah in the streets and and the intensity that sometimes prevails – what makes the state of Israel so unique and special are the incredible people that fight every single day for its mere existence!\n\nI sign off to you now from Ben Gurion Airport. Filled with mixed emotions, I am about to surprise my family and friends in Melbourne who have no idea I am coming home (I have since learned that I cannot try and trick my mother as she is always one step ahead). My final week was magical, YES, another Shabbat on my rooftop, goodbye drinks with friends and visit to extended family members here who I adore.\n\nI encourage you to stop focusing on war and blame when you read about Israel, because as Steve Jobs so famously put it, “Innovation is the only way to win”.\n\nAJJ’s Tips of the week:\n\nHottest restaurant of the week: TYO – So delicious and a classy vibe there were dishes we ate were honestly on the comparable to Nobu.\n\nFunniest interaction: On the journey back from Jerusalem we asked the cab driver to stop for a takeaway beer. He laughs and says he has a surprise. Next thing we know we arrive at the famous Elvis Presley Inn. A shrine for the King himself in the outskirts of Jerusalem!\n\nNew discovery: A part of this amazing start-up success is the support from the Israel Government. One example is the Tnuf. A program which encourages individual entrepreneur in his initial efforts to build a prototype, register a patent, design a business plan, etc. Grants are up to 85% of the approved expenses for a maximum of $50,000 for each project.\n\nCoolest Bar: Sputnik bar – the newest, hidden hotspot on Allenby Street. Astro-turf, a charming interior, brilliant music selections and a very hipster vibe.\n\nStartup to be on the lookout for: Parkam – an app which is still in pilot mode ParKam will help you find the closest, available parking space in real time. Being tested now in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Watch out world, this could be huge!\n\nYou can take the girl out of Tel Aviv, but you can never take Tel Aviv out of the girl!\n\nA change is as good as a holiday, right? Like a blink of an eye, I pack up my belongings and return to Tel Aviv from Jerusalem. The contrast between these two cities has earned itself the running joke that you’ll even need a passport to move between the two! People tend to take sides – you are either a Jerusalemite or a Tel Avivi, but not both. Thankful for my time spent in the Holy City working at OurCrowd, I now can call myself a full-time floater appreciating what each destination has to offer.\n\nMy status as a ‘floater’ came to fruition last month (September), commuting to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv for work. You could coin it as a shlep (Yiddish for tedious journey), I say it’s been all part of the fun.\n\nSeptember was a month replete with Jewish festivals. Rosh Hashana into Yom Kippur leading into Sukkot! Arguably, the best month to be in Israel. However, before I write about my positive experiences over the Chaggim (festival) period, I must make mention of the Arab Israeli conflict which has erupted in a bout of violence in the last two weeks.\n\nThere isn’t a person in Israel that doesn’t feel the heaviness of lives lost to terror – and one doesn’t have to open the newspaper to know it, you just feel the energy here. It is amazing, however, to see how the people here continue to live on. Despite warped international media portrayal, I still feel safe walking the streets, and it’s times like these that I want to stay here more than ever.\n\nTel Aviv Ya Habibi Tel Aviv\n\nThe smell, the streets, the people and the vibe 24 hours a day: all too familiar. Slightly anxious to return to Tel Aviv after having a mild case of ‘Jerusalem Syndrome’, I return to the bubble and feel like I have just come home.\n\nLiving here at 22, it was a big ‘balagan’ (Israel term for chaos) – with parties taking priority and a summer that couldn’t get anymore fun. Whilst the nightlife hasn’t changed my mentality has: I am here to ‘talk business’. Seeing this city from a different angle has been exhilarating. Each day I connect with interesting personalities and intelligent professionals working within the startup nation.\n\nWhen I am not working, I spend long afternoons riding on my bike down the characteristically Tel Aviv boulevards and the ‘tayelet’ (beach-front boardwalk). Beach time comes with package – it’s October and the weather is still gloriously warm and I somehow find myself leaving with a great story every time I sand-off my towel to go home (like that time I was playing in the waves and I left the water with a new business contact and a new app called TimeFlash downloaded to my phone. Only in Israel!)\n\nNights are spent dining with friends, drinking wine, hosting a meal or going to a cool gig. One night I rode through the city from event to event with my French/Israeli friend. We soon became 6, somehow finding myself in a grungy shed in old Jaffa dancing to Latino music with French Jews.\n\nOverall, I feel pretty lucky to have been welcomed back to Tel Aviv with such open arms by friends old and new. The level of hospitality from (finding an apartment to lending me a bike) has blown me away.\n\nA Jewish New Year\n\nBeing a clear minority as a Jew in Australia, (or anywhere outside of Israel), to be in the Jewish homeland for a chag (festival) is wildly entrancing.\n\nI rush down to Shuk Ha Carmel (Carmel Market – Tel Aviv’s central marketplace) to do some very hasty, last minute shopping before the city shuts down for the Jewish New Year. As I decided to host day one Rosh Hashanah lunch at my place, I had to be prepared. Picture this, I am running around the market with a box full of meat, fish and vegetables, a backpack with a watermelon rubbing against my back and bags tied to the ends of it. It wasn’t a pretty sight and despite the humidity, somehow, I managed to get the job done.\n\nFor the first night of Rosh Hashana I go to my family in an inner Tel Aviv suburb called Hod Hasharon. The head of the table says a customary prayer over each element of the meal, apple in honey, pomegranate (Israeli addition), even over the Polish Gflita Fish (this one was rather humorous). I did miss my 91 year old grandmother’s chicken soup and was it was so fitting to see an article written about her this year in a Food Blog called Food is Love. Guess I am not the only blogger in the family!\n\nI frantically wake up the next morning and realise I have just invited 20 people to my house for a meal that I haven’t starting cooking for. I make three salads, pretty the place up, display the challot agulout (round Jewish sweet bread to represent a wholesome year) and I welcome my friends who really experienced my delegating skills at their best (or worst). With a gasp of apprehension I look at 20 starving faces and almost had a ‘freak out’ that there wouldn’t be enough food, and of course, there was leftovers for days. It couldn’t have been a more random mix of people but despite this, it was a lovely afternoon.\n\nYom Kippur\n\nThe Day of Atonement, in the Jewish religion, is a time to reflect on the year that has passed and in doing so, fast for 25 hours. Again, I pull together a last minute meal before the fast, rushing to the chicken shop just before the market was closing (with bike braking along the way). We light the candles and welcomed in one of the most meaningful days in the Jewish calendar.\n\nOn Yom Kippur, the city that doesn’t sleep entirely shuts down. A zero car policy means the once-bustling streets are now filled with bike riders young and old alongside the spiritual crowd walking the streets draped in white. The silence was magical. We walk to shul for the customary Kol Nidrei prayer, and are amazed to see nearly 15 Australians I know at the same synagogue.\n\nOne worth mentioning was a cousin of mine I was only recently reintroduced too, but who made me feel so at home (see photo above).\n\nCaught in a heatwave the next day (and no water for relief), I make my way to synagogue and on the way back, I walk past my friends house, screaming her name from the street and relieved to find her home. Falling asleep to pass the time, I then walk back to shul along the water, which in itself was special. Hearing the Shofar (Ram’s horn) and singing Ha Tikva (The Israeli national anthem) at the conclusion of the service with the uplifting choir, energetic Rabbi Ariel and Jews from all over the world at Beit El on Frishman st was simply breathtaking! I was lucky enough to join my French friend and her family at an American hosted ‘Bagel and Lox’ breaking-of-the-fast feast!\n\nSukkot\n\nFrom the solemn holiday to one of the most joyous, Sukkot adds colour and life to the country. Historically, the festival commemorates the forty-year period during which the children of Israel were ‘desert dwellers’, and in modern day times you build a temporary shelter and feast within the ‘two and a half walls’. Even in this ‘secular’ city, almost every bar and restaurant embraces this festival. You will find the outdoor area of most hotspots filled with palm fronds to cover the roof sekhakh (literally, covering), and lively decorations to participate in the festival.\n\nI make my way up North with my friends in the most beautiful space in nature to visit an ‘old’ Israeli favourite. We fill our glasses with wine and welcome the festival of Sukkot. That’s what I love about Israel, no matter your level of religious orientation, on each Jewish holiday the whole county adds their own personal ‘spice’ to the flavour of the chag. We laugh, catch up on the golden days, share travel stories and enjoy the beautiful surroundings that this country has to offer.\n\nGoodbye OurCrowd:\n\nWith the anticipated Sukkot event at OurCrowd it was only fitting to end my three-month stint with a bang!\n\nI have now delivered my Salesforce project to the Investor Relations team, so for the rest of the month I assisted with the preparation for the Sukkot event. On a beautiful Jerusalem night, 200 investors, portfolio companies and employees gathered at the gorgeous King David Hotel pool next to the sukkah for a fun night of learning and networking.\n\nAt the end of the night my team huddle together, bid me farewell and thank me for my hard work. They give me a stunning and very ‘Israeli’ necklace and leave me with such a warm feeling at the end.\n\nUpon leaving I have my usual chat with a workmate and after three months who finally admits “I don’t know what would be better, telling you that I just don’t listen to you when you speak or admitting that I don’t understand a word that comes out of your mouth.” Amazing that Israelis can understand my English yet Americans still struggle (sorry to generalise, but it’s true). I laugh and, in response, I say; “this is going straight to my blog!”\n\nI drive back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv (all buses ceased to ride at this hour), and I reflect on the amazing 3 months that have just passed at OurCrowd. The exposure I had, the knowledge on the start-up and VC world, the friends, and networks I gained – priceless. I truly thank all the people who made my journey at this amazing company so incredible. Okay Danielle, I will finally give you a mention – you made each day that much better! So thank you.\n\nSimchat Torah:\n\nAt the end of the festival of Sukkot the county once again shuts down for the final festival of the year Simchat Torah (which runs in conjunction with Shmim Atzeret). Simchat Torah means ‘Rejoicing in the Torah’ (bible). This holiday marks the completion of the annual cycle of weekly Torah readings. Again, being in Israel you don’t forget when it’s a Jewish Holiday. My friend and I decide to embrace the night by returning to synagogue for a joyous session of dancing with the Torah. Yes, we both had the honour of holding a mini Torah (a first for us both). It was a poignant moment standing on Frishman St when the Rabbi spoke about the recent attacks in Jerusalem and said, “We will not stop singing”.\n\nSo…what’s next?\n\nWell you will have to keep reading for that! Lots of exciting things in the pipeline. A new chapter begins and I’m not quite ready to finish the book quite yet… having way too much fun 🙂\n\nShabbat Shalom from Tel Aviv!\n\nAJJ xx\n\nAJJ’s tips of the week:\n\nHottest restaurant: Makom Shel Basar – (The Place for Meat). Arguably one of the best steak restaurants in Tel Aviv, no better place to eat the night before going into a fast.\n\nFunniest interaction: Sitting with some friends at my house after a heavy synagogue service and in walks all of my neighbours from downstairs like they walked into their own home. My friend with me at the time says, “Who are you Amanda!”\n\nNew discovery: Sitting in on a meeting about Cyber Security, one of the hottest areas to invest in at the moment here, I learn about the concept of a ‘Zero day exploit’ which is one of the most prevalent attacks on the web. Google it!\n\nCoolest Bar: Teder: A seasonal pop up bar / radio station in Tel Aviv which has now ended! Hipster, outdoor and great music\n\nStartup to be on the lookout for: Netello – I saw this app demonstrated at the amazing DLD Innovation conference in Tel Aviv. This app Captures and interacts your body in 3D.\n\nI sit here with a bowl Middle-Eastern flavoured chicken soup in one hand (yes a bit under the weather), a MacBook in the other, and reflect on the spectacular few weeks that have just passed.\n\nAugust has recently ended, which means I have just turned 28. For the first time in my life I am indifferent to becoming another year older, even slightly enthusiastic. If one’s age is indicative of how they feel, then I have never felt younger ☺\n\nJerusalem continues to shine through August – September, full of events where guests can enjoy the mostly improved weather that has come about. As the clock ticks, the highly anticipated chagim (Jewish festivals) are just around the corner, and I have chosen to stay in Israel this year for the duration.\n\nI pack up my apartment in Jerusalem as I figure out the remainder of my time here (even if it means commuting). Who am I kidding?! Tel Aviv is always a good idea!\n\nOurCrowd\n\nIt has been busy at OurCrowd despite the fact that August tends to be a month where most people are on holidays. We hosted two great events, one in Tel Aviv and one in Jerusalem, where we were enlightened about the powerful software behind the Iron Dome. We also heard from an OurCrowd General Partner about ‘Seed Funding’ in Israel. Did you know that whilst last year VC fund investment hit a new high, only 5% was invested in Seed Funds?\n\nLots of visitors come through the office, even some friends of mine from home. It is always fun showing people through OurCrowd, you can never predict their response. I am now deep into my own projects, with new initiatives on the horizon.\n\nIn parallel, I had been busy planning an exciting event back home (literally). Sadly, I had to postpone it (good news for my peeps). I’ll definitely reignite the flame soon, as there has been so much interest in Melbourne in regards to OurCrowd and how to join the party!\n\nSpeaking of party, I was sitting at my desk one afternoon and a work mate said to me, “Amanda, aren’t you coming to the Brit Milla (circumcision)?” I must have missed the memo. I spring up and an hour later find myself in Beit Shemesh at a lovely celebration of the birth of a friend from work’s newborn son. An abundance of food and a superfluity of interesting characters filled the room. I expected nothing less at a celebration in Israel.\n\nA night in the desert\n\nIn the thick of the wedding season, I am invited to a wedding in the desert near Masada. The location – Kfar Hanokdim. I bused to Be’er Sheva to meet my friend, then catch a taxi into the heat of the desert at 6:30pm, right in time for sunset. If you haven’t been to an Israeli wedding, it’s a must! At a typical Israel wedding you enter to a selection of hor d’oeuvres (appetizers). This time we are eating delicious mini-schwarmas, tuna sashimi cones and a plethora of Israeli salads in the desert while sipping mojitos. Pretty cool!\n\nUnder the nearly full moon, a French-Israeli friend married a gorgeous Israeli girl. It was so powerful to see the Rabbi pull out a guitar and start singing during chuppah (ceremony). We danced to an array of tunes in numerous languages until the sunrise like no one was watching. The sleeping situation was rather unique too, with huge tents and mattresses set up. However, the sound of camels in the early morning did not let me sleep a wink! Oh well…\n\nBirthday celebrations\n\nBeing in Israel for my birthday, I couldn’t resist planning a special day with my two best friends from home. As I tell everyone we meet, how many friends do you have since birth?\n\nThe three musketeers (and previous Think BIG team) spoil ourselves to a night at the Cramim hotel. ‘Spectacular’ wouldn’t do this hotel justice. Overlooking the breathtaking Judean Hills, this relatively new hotel boasts class and charm.\n\nWe meet together for the first time in months and eat at a local Arabic favourite call Neora in Abu Gosh (the town is famous for its humus). Our table is filled with falafel and nearly 20 salads and we had no room in our stomachs for even half of it. The lights dim and out comes a giant sparkler with the funniest ‘Happy Birthday’ tune I have heard yet! Going back to the room I am enveloped with presents from my friends and sweet family. Totally unexpected.\n\nWaking up to the unspoiled views , on our morning stroll we find ourselves in someone’s garden. We leave with a hand-full of fresh gapes as a ‘take-home present’. We relax by the pool in the afternoon, soak in the sun and have some much needed ‘girl time’.\n\nReturning to Jerusalem for sunset, I take my friends to my favourite rooftop, which is the top of the Mamilla hotel. It’s now night-time and we finally arrive at the much anticipated Machaneyuda! We were dancing on tables, banging plates, running around the preparation area with the chefs, and eating the most mouth-watering food I have yet sampled in Israel. For my cake, they roll out an entire roll of silver-foil and fill it with the most scrumptious selection of deserts. Of course my friends smash my face with cream and we end up having a dessert fight!The night was so unforgettable and the love I received on my birthday was truly overwhelming. I have only pure gratitude.\n\nSpicing up Shabbat\n\nBeing in a country without my family means that each Shabbat I have to find my own way. I mix it up from one week to the next. No matter where I am it seems to always be memorable.\n\nFirst Shabbat is in Tel Aviv. We attend a White City Shabbat – which started off in a synagogue (they say that when Ben Gurion was alive this was his chosen ‘synagogue’). I then join a nice prayer service and a dinner with expats and Olim (Jews who have moved to Israel from around the world). I spend the weekend visiting the beautiful Michmoret beach and hang out with my friends feeling ever so local!\n\nThe next Shabbat was spent in Jaffa (Yafo), an ancient port city where and one of the first settlements in Tel Aviv. I went for a pre-Shabbat dip in the beach and make a peaceful dinner in the old city of Jaffa with paper bag candles and lots of red wine. Lunch was in Jerusalem with a bunch of Aussie friends. We ended the Shabbat chilling out at Gan Sacher with the hippies of the town.\n\nThe last began with an ‘Indian Summer Fashion’ style Shabbat dinner, both cultured and colourful. A banquet of locally sourced Indian food under the banner of EatWith, a new concept I was unfamiliar with. In short, it’s a global community that lets you enjoy authentic and intimate dining experiences in people’s homes. My friend hosted this one and welcomed a mixed crowd of people of different ages and ethnicities into his home. I have the honour of doing the ha’moitze (prayer for the bread). Instead of challah, we had naan bread as a suitable substitute.\n\nI end Shabbat with a beautiful session at the Kotel (wailing wall) with dear friends from home. As Michael Ronnen Safdie so eloquently put it in his book, The Western Wall, “this place is the site of a huge reunion, it is a reunion with their history, and their past, even with their dead, And, with all reunions, many of them are personal”. It is a mystical city of, “God Seekers, hope seekers, peace seekers”. I am given a branch of mint, as it is customary to be sniff spices at the conclusion of the shabbat. Why? When the spiritual Sabbath leaves and another work-week arrives, it is necessary to resuscitate ourselves by smelling a pleasant fragrance.\n\nMagic in Cesaria\n\nIt’s now Sunday and my week begins with the most gorgeous chuppah facing the ocean for the wedding of two friends from home. It was Australia meets South Africa meets Israel this time. The Rabbi Menachem Wolf (from Spiritgrow a synagogue in Melbourne) stole the show with humour, equanimity and meaning. It was a ceremony to remember and a beautiful night on the water.\n\nIt’s now Sunday and my week begins with the most gorgeous chuppah facing the ocean for the wedding of two friends from home. It was Australia meets South Africa meets Israel this time. The Rabbi Menachem Wolf (from Spiritgrow a synagogue in Melbourne) stole the show with humour, equanimity and meaning. It was a ceremony to remember and a beautiful night on the water.\n\nAJJ’s Tips of the Week\n\nHottest restaurant of the week: Kadosh café: Established in 1967, This Middle-Eastern family own restaurant has a real Eastern European vibe. Hands down – the best breakfast I have had in Jerusalem\n\nFunniest interaction: Amongst my bag of Jewish goodies for my birthday was a Hologram of a Rabbi. When I asked my friends who this this, they honestly had no idea!\n\nNew discovery: Have you heard of a Gazoz? Internationally it is known special lemonade like soda drink. I tried my first Gazoz with a twist at a hidden treasure, Levinsky 41 in South Tel Aviv. It’s more like a special potion, and if you want to feel a natural high, go there!\n\nCoolest Bar: The summer bar at the American Colony Hotel in East Jerusalem. Had a thought-provoking night with some friends there\n\nStartup to be on the lookout: Pickcha – met these enthusatic guys who have just completed their accelerator program. They have developed a startup whereby handling a real photo that is developed on the spot straight from their own mobile phones. All through a QR code!\n\nShanah Tovah (Happy New Year) from Israel. May your New Year be as sweet as honey. While every year I bring the most creative version of apple and honey to my workplace, this year at OurCrowd they bring it to me.\n\nAJJ xx\n\nIt’s 10pm. I enter the lively Machane Yehuda (outdoor market) on a 25-degree night. I see a colourful crowd twirling to Middle Eastern beats. In front of the rusty shutter doors, a band called Sabir is performing. I experience peculiar instruments making unique sounds. I order a frozen limonana (lemonade with mint), with a touch of alcohol, and join my Israeli friend and Spanish friend. I watch the crowd beam. I am back in Jerusalem.\n\nUndeniably, it has been a ‘heated few weeks’ in this city, and I am not only referring to the weather. While it has been hard to swallow the unprecedented attacks here, it was rather pleasant to take a break for a weekend and come back to the prevailing summer energy. Jerusalem is alive in August and some would even term it ‘festival month’. Let me begin…\n\nSUMMER NIGHTS\n\nWhilst Tel Aviv thrives itself on the beach, Jerusalem (for those abroad) prides itself on the weather. The evening breeze is delightful and almost saves you in the summertime.\n\nOne night after work I attend the Jerusalem Summer party with colleagues, which is hosted at the JVP Media Quarter. Cocktails in branded milk bottles await us at the door and a band with English cover music is playing. Erel Margalit, a member of Knesset and a Israeli hi-tech and social entrepreneur, welcomes everybody. We gather to celebrate this growing startup community that Time Magazine recently coined as one as one out of ‘five emerging tech hubs around the world’.\n\nAnother night after dinner, en route to my home in Rehaviah, my friend and I stop at the beautiful Emek Hamazlevah (The valley of the cross). Hearing whispers about a gig, we walk past and in the middle of a graffiti tunnel, in a picturesque valley, 200 Israelis are there dancing to the techno beats. Such a lively scene, hidden in between a valley and a park.\n\nThe wine festival is pumping, next week the beer festival, and a plethora of other events put on by the Jerusalem Season of Culture. Not enough days in the week!\n\nA ‘MAGYAR’ AT HEART\n\nWhat is a Magyar you may ask? It is a Hungarian person. My late grandmother Judith (hence my middle name) was born in Budapest and migrated to Australia after the Second World War. Although I never met her, I feel intrinsically connected to her and my strong Hungarian roots.\n\nI visit Budapest on my weekend away. Pretty unique to still have family there, I pop in to my family’s antique chandelier shop and say hi to Tamás and Gabor (see below). Budapest blows me away and I feel a whimsical charm to the city. Ruin pubs are the norm, abandoned downtown buildings turned zingy bars and restaurants. Olden day Eastern Europe meets a modern and very hipster town!\n\nOnce a country with a thriving Jewish community and around 1,000,000 inhabitants, Budapest still possesses a sense of Jewishness. I stroll one early evening along the gorgeous Danube River, which separates Buda and Pest. Without any warning (or even signs) I see a myriad of steel shoes along the waters edge. I ask the American lady next to me what is the significance of the memorial; she explains how 30,000 Jews were taken to this very point in 1944. “They were forced to remove their shoes and belongings and paired up, with one of the two shot and thus both killing both of them.” I take a large gulp while standing in one of the most idyllic spots in Eastern Europe and find myself overwhelmed with sadness. How is this conceivable?\n\nWe visit the stunning Dohany Synagogue, the biggest shul (synagogue) in Europe. Tours in numerous languages fill this stunning space, which was built in the late 1800s and revamped after the Holocaust. New fact of the day: Theodor Herzl was born across the road from the shul. For those who don’t know, Herzl was the father of modern day secular Zionism (love of Israel). This ambitious Hungarian dreamt of a Jewish state and promoted Jewish migration to Palestine, and here I am visiting from that same country, Israel, 100+ years later. Typically, we find a bar called ‘Mazel Tov’ and neglecting our oath to only eat Hungarian food, once again we find ourselves eating pita and hummus in the middle of the 7th district. Mind you, there was hardly any shortage of gulyás (goulash), paprikáscsirke (chicken paprika) and Palacsinta (crepes) in our diet (or lack of thereof). My new theory: 1 dessert shop for every 2 people in Budapest; who needs that many cake shops? Overall, a fun-filled and invigorating ‘gals’ weekend away.\n\nYAD VASHEM\n\n“When I grow up and get to twenty I’ll travel and see this this world of plenty. In a bird with an engine I will sit myself down, Take off and fly into space, far above the ground. I’ll Fly, I’ll cruise and soar up high above a world so lovely, into the sky…..” Abramek Kopolowicz, murdered in Auschwitz at age 14.\n\nReturning from Hungary and feeling the inherent connection to my past, when the opportunity came to go with my non-Jewish Mexican friend and English guy and French girl to Yad Vashem (Holocaust Memorial), it was only natural to accept. Here I share stories passed down from my grandfather having survived Auschwitz, not once but twice. This time connecting more to my Polish roots (3/4 Polish grandparents), I am astonished to read that out of 3.25 million Polish Jews that lived in Poland before the war, only 325,000 survived. With a feeling of gloominess, I exit the museum and walk out to to the unrivalled views of Jerusalem. The contrast of backdrops, for me anyway, only bolsters my love of this country!\n\nCAN YOU EVER GET SICK OF HUMMUS?\n\nI believe not! After work one night I meet my friend for quick hummus stop in Rehaviah. The meal was quick and delicious. I return home, turn on the television to Israeli Masterchef and naturally, the two remaining contestants were having a ‘hummus off’. The challenge – who can prepare the most flavoursome dish of hummus. Only in Israel!\n\nEveryone in this country seems to ‘know’ the best hummus in town. I have to say on my ‘Shvil ha Hummus’ (hummus trail), to me the more local, the better. It’s now Friday afternoon and I finally visit ‘Azura’. A Jerusalem gem, which has been around for the past 25 years. Preparing a variety of Kurdish, Iraqi and Sephardic dishes, this family-run restaurant gives a new meaning to the word ‘authenticity’. Whilst the squash and goulash soup leaves me speechless, the hummus here was by far the best I have had in town! I look forward to returning on a cooler day to try their famous Kubbeh Soup (traditional Iraqi soup).\n\nGOOD SHABBOS\n\nThe sirens sound and after a busy Friday, I calmly welcome the Shabbat. Tucked away in the quaint alleyways of Nachalot, I join my friends for a ‘speed’ prayer service at a shul, which was overflowing with young single Israelis. Fun fact: Ohavei Zion, is referred to as ‘Banai Shul’, and was built in 1906 by the Banai family (famous Israeli family renowned for singing). It was originally established for Parsim (Persian) Immigrants, for the soul purpose of giving them a ‘home’ in Jerusalem.\n\nI spend this Shabbat with a friend who isn’t of the faith and love sharing with him customs and traditions of the Jewish ‘day of rest’. Excitedly, we are invited to a Moishe House for Friday night dinner. Moishe House is a pluralistic Jewish organisation that reaches out to young adults in their 20s. In we walk, near the happening market, where these three modern orthodox dudes live in an eclectic and grungy space. Part of living in this house is that they host a minimum of 4 events a month. We sing, pray, eat and continue to eat, drink Arak, and share stories and experiences from Israel and around the world!\n\nShabbat wouldn’t be fulfilled without more eating! Enter Saturday, and we peacefully walk to the Greek Colony into another great living space, this time an old Jerusalem building with a contemporary interior. Stimulating conversations, really lovely people, and delicious food, the highlight dish was the ground turkey, (of course with humus). What I appreciate about a Shabbat meal in addition to the oversupply of great food is everyone is entirely present, pun intended! With no phones and no technology, people actually listen. Why can’t every meal be like this?\n\nI visit a friend and sit on his rooftop to wind down from Shabbat over a cold beer. This story is too good not to write about. I sit with his roommate from Toronto and discuss the most random of topics. 20 minutes into the conversation he says, “I spoke to my mom a few hours ago and she told me her friend’s friend’s daughter is living in Jerusalem and I should take her out.” I respond agreeing how annoying it is when parents try to match you up thinking nothing of it. He tells his mother unfortunately he is seeing someone. He then laughs that the girl his mother is talking about is me!!!! My mother has ONE friend in the whole of Canada, what are the odds that that one friend is his mother’s best friend? The Jewish world, I tell you, is just too small, and it only gets smaller when you are living in Israel. Just for the record, no we did not go out! That’s about as much as I am giving away on my ‘social life’.\n\nA DAY IN THE OFFICE\n\nI often get asked what exactly it is I do at OurCrowd everyday? In short, the team I am working in, Investor Relations, connects investors to remarkable startups with huge growth potential. I also have the privilege of mingling with other teams, be it Business Development Team, Marketing, or Product Development. I am now in the process of becoming a Salesforce pro too, and currently writing technical guides. I talk events, attend events (I know not ‘up my alley’ at all), and try to plan cool events too. There has never been a time when Israel’s technology was more respected, and it’s so wonderful to be engrossed in it all day!\n\nSpontaneity enters my day too. I come to the office after an invigorating morning working in Tel Aviv, flowing in our hallway, is a presentation with a delegation of MBA students from Instead Business School, half of them studying in France and the other half Singapore. How about the South African group, a bunch of 20 or so young South African CEO’s from all different ethic backgrounds, who come for a few hours? Admittedly, I get extra enthusiastic when an Australian walks into the office, as a bit of Melbourne lingo is always refreshing! Just to top this off for the week, I am about to sit down to have a productive afternoon and a group of people are standing next to me asking “Amanda, aren’t you coming to the Brit Milla (circumcision)?” Just another day at OurCrowd!\n\nThe interns are slowly leaving and soon I will be the last one standing. So the questions start to flood! I have decided to stay on here through September as I am simply learning too much to leave at this point. In discussing my life in Australia compared to here, in the most typical Israeli fashion, an Israeli colleague passionately remarks, “Why do you need to bother here? You have a bright future in Australia, this Middle Eastern, olive eating country we call ‘ Modeldet’ (birth place). I know its fun, but seriously, don’t think of moving your life here.” You have to love Israeli’s – you don’t even need to ask what they think because they will tell you anyway. This vigorous level of honesty really rubs off on you!\n\nAJJ’s Tips of the Week\n\nHottest restaurant of the week: Mona – Tucked away in what used to be a historic museum in Jerusalem, the Tartare de Bouef and Crispy Salmon was worth returning for.\n\nFunniest interaction: During a presentation to a group of international delegates at work the presenter (a colleague), in talking about the revolution of mobile phones, puts up a photo of a guy playing with his phone in bathroom. Unintentionally he says, “Nokia was the first company who let us play with snake in the bathroom.” People in the room were literally crying of laughter! I think you had to be there\n\nNew discovery: Intel employs 10,000 people here in Israel and 80% of Intel’s chips make a visit to the Holy Land.\n\nCoolest Bar: Sorry to jump between two countries here, but Szmpla Kert, the oldest ruin pub in Budapest. Hands down, the best interior at a bar I have seen in my life. Too many tourists though.\n\nStartup to be on the lookout: OrCam – This company has created a technologically advanced device unique in its ability to provide visual aid through a discreet wearable platform.\n\nSo that’s it from me, off to humid Tel Aviv for a weekend of fun and sun (and hopefully some strong air-conditioning). Wishing you a Shabbat Shalom! I hope there is a bit of hummus or paprika on your table this weekend too 🙂\n\nAJJ x\n\nWhat makes for a good day? A good day, in my opinion, is if you go to bed with a smile. A great day is if, in addition to this, you learn something new. Be it good or bad, knowledge is power and this concept of acquiring new information and new experience is certainly one of the better addictions one can have.\n\nI routinely enter the same office now five days a week. Whoever says all desk jobs are boring, I challenge your thought process. After a month, I still often leave with my head bursting with new concepts. Even after a weekend away from the desk, I find I am craving the feeling of stimulation. By day, I learn investing 101; comprehensive details about new start-ups; trends in the industry; and useful business facts.\n\nBy night, the bustling streets engross me. You really never know what you will stumble across in Jerusalem. Both in and out of my job I find I am the ‘yes!’ woman. Being that ‘yes!’ type takes me on all sorts of adventures. Is it because I am essentially travelling? Or is there just that much more going on here?\n\nIn every situation here I am being challenged religiously and, in turn, gaining a deep insight into modern orthodoxy (and politics). The conversations in and out of the work place are riveting and force me to dig that bit deeper. Walking past the colourful ‘pride’ flags in the city center earlier this week has, however left me shaken with the death of 16 year old Shira Banky – a life cut short. I blame extremism on this and (for me at least) it’s the only way to even slightly comprehend the calamities. Whilst this inevitably dampens my enthusiasm for the ‘Holy City’, the unity of people from all religious backgrounds, rallying in the streets only hours after the news of her death went public, gives me hope.\n\nISRAELIS KNOW HOW TO LIVE:\n\nThere is a lot to learn from Israelis. Have you heard of the concept of a Sabra? No not the Hummus Company in the USA. A sabra refers to Jews born in Israel, and this term was coined around the time of the State of Israel was established. In actual fact, the term ‘Sabra’ alludes to a thorny desert plant, similar to a cactus, with thick skin and a soft interior.\n\nComparatively, an Israeli may seem as tough as nails on the outside. But once you crack them, there ain’t nothing sweeter.\n\nBelieve it or not, Israel is actually one of the happiest countries in the world, according to the 2015 Better Life Index Report by the OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). The best explanation I have heard so far for is due to the reality of living in the Middle East. For Israelis fighting in the army at 18 will do something to you – but to look at this in a positive light, it ostensibly causes Israelis to live in the now and revel the moment. Having done a bit of mindfulness meditation (practicing to be in a state of active, open attention on the present), happiness is unequivocally synonymous with living in the now!\n\nKibbutz Kfar Hanasi recently celebrated its 67th birthday and I had the privilege of spending the weekend there with my ‘Kibbutz family’ (a Kibbutz is a collective community founded around socialistic values). Situated in the Golan Heights, this Kibbutz was built by British Jewish immigrants and members of the Habonim Dror movement. Although the Kibbutz doesn’t live by the founding socialist values, it still boasts a sense of togetherness and community. I attend the Kibbutz mesiba (party) outside in the yard, surrounded by ducks, horses and other farm animals. All ages, dancing under vibrant umbrellas, in nature, to celebrate this amazing place they call home. It was admirable, with no frills at all, just ordinary people enjoying life and having a boogie. Something we can all take from this.\n\nINNOVATION IN JERUSALEM:\n\nBack in Jerusalem the sentiment of ‘happiness’ is not dissimilar. The rest of this country may have a certain perception about Jerusalem, the ‘religious’ city – but being in a place where people love where they are really rubs off on you. At least once a week (if not day) an Israeli friend from work looks at me and says, “I just love Jerusalem, Amanda”. Noteworthy, there is an impressive Not-For-Profit called MadeinJLM. Its aim is to connect and empower Jerusalem’s start-up and tech community. OurCrowd fits right into the mould. When I asked my boss why this company is in Jerusalem and not Tel Aviv? The answer is simple, “because we are passionate about this city and we want others to love it too!” So why not bring more of the start-up scene to Jerusalem?!\n\n‘Bezalel’ is the most distinguished college in Israel in terms of arts and design, so much so that when someone tells you they attend there, you know they are passionately creative. I joined some friends to the view the final year Industrial Design exhibition – inspiring, to say the least. From the spiralling speakers which solves the ‘back wave distortion’ issue in listening to music, to a jaw dropping machine like structure made by a friend out of wood – which essentially replicates an object – you feel like you are surrounded by people who will one day be ‘something’ (and if not they will create an epic structure at Burning Man!) I also attend the Haddasa College ‘IDEA’ exhibition for photography and loved the pun on the word ‘IKEA’. The renowned ‘arrows’ on the floor guide you through the exhibition and, undoubtedly, a lot less stressful then walking through IKEA on a Sunday.\n\nINDIVIDUALS WHO CHALLENGE MY THINKING:\n\nKibbutz Galutyot (ingathering of the exiles), is a saying (a bit old-school) used to describe the congregation of the Jews to Israel from around the world. I am, however, completely dumbfounded by the array of people who come to this country from a completely unbiased and unreligious standpoint. Either they meet a cheerful Israeli travelling, are interested in politics or simply hear along the grapevine that it is actually ‘safe’ and ‘fun’ to visit Israel.\n\nFlying from Dubai to London I spend 10 minutes explaining to the Qantas airhostess why I am en route to this contentious region. Of course, by the end of the conversation, I convince her that Israel has to be her next destination!\n\nI meet a 23-year-old girl up North on my weekend away from Jerusalem. Her nationality is German and she has been living in Poland the past 4 years, (interesting I think to myself). Being a loud, third generation Holocaust survivor – the combination is quite the jackpot! In the most polite manner, I ask her what brings her to Israel and she exclaims, “I am just fascinated by the country, and although everyone feared my safety, I wanted to visit”. Not only did she come alone, but she is couchsurfing her way through Israel. Talk about impressive! We keep conversing about our lives and the inevitable conversation about our families’ pasts is unravelled. I explain that all four of my grandparents were either in camps or hiding during World War II and she confidently admits her grandfather was part of the Nazi Youth. Comprehending the heavy information, I ask her if she doesn’t mind to tell me more and she explains, “he was six years old and had no choice”. Confronting yet so symbolic, 70 years after liberation we can sit on a beautiful kibbutz, in Israel, and share our family histories.\n\nI go out for drinks with a group of new friends one of whom is an American international correspondent for Fox News. Comfortably working in the United States, he is offered a contract in Jerusalem. When the idea was floated he asks, “Jerusalem in New York?” (If you didn’t know there is a small town in Yates Country called Jerusalem in New York with approx 4,500 people). He shares with us photos and stories from reporting in Gaza last year during ‘Operation Protective Edge’. Trying to play cool, we were completely gobsmacked by his stories from both sides! On the contrary, it is so nice to see how marvelled him and his girlfriend (a workmate) are by the energy of Israel and the Middle East.\n\nI am also connected with an Australian who is on secondment at the UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) from the Australian army.\n\nDuring lunch he takes a few ladies and myself from work on a tour of this magnificent building, which used to be the English Governors estate during the British Mandate pre 1948. UNTSO’s activities have been and still are spread over territory within five States, and therefore it has relations with five host countries; Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syrian Arab Republic. The perfectly manicured entrance, sinking gardens and irresistible rooftop (where you can see the separation between Israel and the West Bank) leave us all overwhelmed. After a fulfilled hour, we pick up our passports and return to the office. Just your average lunch break, right?\n\nI spend my first work day out of the office and have the pleasure of joining an Israeli colleague who works on Business Development for OurCrowd. We base ourselves in the Hertazliah area, for a full day of meetings and a delectable lunch at Sebastian (Yotam Otteleghi eat your heart out). I felt like we were Harvey Spector and Mike Ross from Suits’ female counterparts, running from meeting to meeting. I learn about strategic partnerships and thrive from watching her effortlessly connect with each person we meet.\n\nLAMA LO? (WHY NOT?)\n\nThis cheeky phrase thrown around here is a winning favourite of mine. After a month (more or less) in Jerusalem and a bit of time up North, I spend the weekend in Tel Aviv (my old stomping grounds). Staying with close friends from home, sunset on the beach, eating in style and Shabbat at my extended family – it was all ‘fun and games’, as per usual. Worth mentioning, is the Havana Block Party we attend at Diego San where a Cuban sensation belted out tunes in the alleyway like setting in South Tel Aviv. It was pretty special visiting my old workplace the in Florentine where I had a chaser (shot) with an old workmate and the amazing Ethiopian boss I used to work for! Irrefutably, an exciting weekend. I have to say, though, the humidity of August in Tel Aviv was slightly overwhelming (I know, cry me a river). Never thought I would admit this publicly but, take me back to Jerusalem 🙂\n\nNot Much cooler in this city, it hit a mammoth 40 degrees back in Jerusalem this week! Needing some relief from the heat, I am finding that with no beach (or air-conditioning), I am becoming a frequent visitor at hotel pools. Certainly, a benefit of a hot summers night, is being able to sit outside and enjoy a concert and for me this experience was climatic. Watching David Broza and the New Andalusian Orchestra, Ashkelon at the New Israel Museum is just one of those bucket list moments. How sentimental for him to sing in Jerusalem, during a week of turmoil, ‘Yihei Tov’ (it will all be good).\n\nAJJ’s TIPS OF THE WEEK:\n\nHottest restaurant: Sakora Sushi – Captivating the alleys of Jerusalem, finally a sushi bar with Melbourne standards in Jerusalem!\n\nFunniest interaction: I might as well speak another language in the office; nobody can understand my Aussie Accent. e.g. I say to a friend from work what a “rippa” photo and she replies, “a what?” (Australian slang for ‘excellent’)\n\nNew discovery: Did you know that thousands of Chassidic (ultra Orthodox) Jews go to the Ukrainian city of Uman for Rosh Hashana? Why? To pay respects to Rebbe Nachman, the founder of the Breslev sect, (1810) a Rabbi adored by his followers for his brilliant religious mind and holy demeanour. In doing this, they feel closer to G-d.\n\nCoolest Bar: Rooftop at Mamilla hotel, hands down! Breathtaking views looking onto the old city and of Jerusalem (one can never go to too many rooftop bars)\n\nStart-up to be on the lookout for: MUV – a one product company where a small wearable ‘bird’ can turn any space into a interactive playground. I went for a live demonstration at the office in Hertazliah. This company could be huge!\n\nI leave you with Puszi (kisses in Hungarian), as I visiting my maternal ‘motherland’ of Budapest for the weekend to eat lots of paprika and goulash with friends from Melbourne.\n\nAJJ\n\n31.046051 34.851612\n\nOn my routine walk to work, passing the gaping green vines, I stop to get a freshly squeezed orange juice (‘mitz tapuzim’) at a corner store. Coldplay’s chilling track, ‘Magic’, is playing in the background. Totally shvitzing (Yiddish for sweating) from the scorching Jerusalem sun, (sorry Aus, I know it’s been a cold winter), I think to myself that this city really is ‘magic.’\n\nIn my first few days here I felt like man landing on the moon. Now I can gladly say that said initial shock factor has dissipated and I am simply revelling in Jerusalem’s beauty.\n\nTHE JERUSALEM LOCALS\n\nHow would one define the Jerusalem folk? Let’s start with a night at the famous shuk (open-air market). One would find:\n\n– A Rabbi purchasing bread from an Arab vendor.\n\n– An American group of Birthright students chanting.\n\n– A ‘shanti’ Israeli student in fisherman pants chilling.\n\n– A few foreign tourists from Sweden having a drink.\n\nThe multifariousness of J-Town’s people really hit home when I walked into Abraham Hostel (kind of wish I was still backpacking) and saw the diversity of travellers interacting in the kitchen hall. Something that caught my eye was this colourful stencil splashed on the wall at the entrance to the hostel, ‘Abraham the first backpacker’.\n\nWhat a quirky spin on Abraham, the ‘First Forefather’, who plays a prominent role as the Patriarch in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\n\nB’kizur (in short), something that becomes instantaneously apparent is the sheer warmth and heimisheness of the people here. Whether you meet someone at a nail salon or sit next to them at a café – not only will they take your Facebook details; you’ll also have yourself an offer for Shabbat dinner or an invitation to an exhibition that night. Call it manifestation, I call it Jerusalem.\n\nA SMALL WORLD\n\nBeing in Israel, you almost can’t be surprised by the concept of a coincidence. Or can you?\n\nFriday night, I go to my first Shabbat service in Jerusalem at Ramban shul (synagogue) in the charming Greek Quarter. Excitedly, I make way to a friend’s house to join him for the service. As we walk in, he introduces me to a new face and exclaims; “Amanda, this young lady is also from Melbourne.” Of course, it is someone that I was supposed to call through a friend and we laugh at the situation.\n\nAnd, it gets much better…. I sit down during the service, turn to the girl next to me and ask her what page we are on in the siddur (prayer book). She politely says, “this may seem a tad weird, but did we do drama class together in year 6?” I look at her incredulously (as I very rarely find someone with a stranger memory than my own), laugh and reply, “of course!” I realise she is a daughter of an old teacher who I haven’t seen in 15 years! Sitting in between the two Melbournians in a random (or not so random) shul in the middle of Jerusalem, I hum to the calming Shabbat tunes and appreciate my first poignant shul experience.\n\nA FULL SHABBAT IN JERUSALEM\n\nThe Sabbath in the Jewish religion is the time of rest. It’s surreal to think that an entire city can close down for 25 hours every single week – but it does, and it is ever-so-wonderful.\n\nFrom the synagogue service to dinner at a work mate’s, followed by lunch the next day at another work friend’s home, I was lucky enough to be surrounded by young and interesting people. Homemade Vietnamese rice paper rolls, baked peaches and delicious Israeli Rosé wine, just to paint a bit of a picture. Both homes I visited were homes of young expats and it was truly fascinating to get a ‘taste’ of a different perspective of this enchanting city.\n\nTo top off a meaningful Shabbat, I meet my cousin at Gan Sacher, a lusciously green park not far from where I live. You name it; Acro yoga, musical instruments, frisbee and soccer games. As the sun sets and Shabbat comes to an end, the park transforms into a real spectacle and once again, magic!\n\nLIFE AS AN INTERN\n\nBeing nearly 28 and calling yourself an ‘intern’ often sounds a bit strange to people, but when you get to experience an OurCrowd ‘Intern Appreciation Day’, it’s not too shabby after all. We arrive at work, have lunch and a ‘L’Chaim’ (that’s how you say ‘cheers’ in Hebrew – it means ‘to life’) for our hard work before making our way to paintball. Having the combined Polish/Hungarian roots that I do, I guess my lightly coloured skin is more conducive to bruising than I’d like (thanks Karen) – so I can now say I have been paintball-ed (for the first and last time).\n\nWe then go by bus to Tel Aviv and arrive at a large office building on the outskirts of the city. Surprise – it’s Google, Israel! Each area within the office represents a different slice of Israel from the north, to the boulevards of the Tel Aviv. Whist we didn’t get to go down the famous slide, we certainly saw enough to make our mouths drop. Personally, the presentation at the end made by a few ‘Googlers’ was the most fascinating part for me. Not only were we able to ask lots of questions, but we learnt about some awesome initiatives that have come out of this office:\n\n– Shvil Yisrael is the Israel National Trail that is currently being tracked with the Google Street view camera\n\n– ‘Mind the Gap!’ is a program which encourages young girls in high school to chose High-tech as their career path.\n\nWhat a company! The day concluded with a delicious dinner at Blackout, an inspiring initiative whereby visually impaired waiters serve you food in the pitch black. Scary at first, but eating without being judged – my kind of meal!\n\nThere’s never a dull moment at OurCrowd. I walk into the office one morning and politely ask the guy who sits next to me what he got up to last night. He replies saying how tired he is from staying up all night to help a friend, a senior member of Knesset (National Assembly), to comprehend the Iranian Nuclear talks and prepares him for foreign media. No big deal! I also sat in on my first pitch thinking it would be interesting, yet I left with all this newfound knowledge on the Middle Eastern mobile phone app market – especially within the Arab world. Thanks to ANZ goMoney (the app I used to work on at ANZ Bank) I could actually keep up with the conversation.\n\nFUN AND GAMES\n\nCertainly one of the strangest experiences I have had so far in this city was at the renowned Jerusalem Film Festival. There I was selecting the ‘winning’ movie and after two hours of cringing, let’s just say the glass of red wine at the after party downstairs was rather warranted. The movie, ‘Tikkun’, is a stirring and overly graphic portrait of an Ultra-Orthodox man in Jerusalem grappling with questions of faith. The contrast between the disturbing movie and partying outside with breathtaking views of the Old City made it all the more exhilarating.\n\nI would love to end on a story that was told to me by a colleague. Stressing about a photo of myself that I didn’t want to put on Instagram as my “arm looked large”, he told me the story of Joseph Trumpeldor. One of the early Zionists’ who dreamt that there would be a Jewish State, this brave young man lost his arm and continued to fight, “True, I have now but one arm,” he said, “but it is the right one capable of handling a sword or rifle.” You may have walked down Trumpeldor st or through the cemetery (which my friends and I had a lovely apartment overlooking on my last trip in Tel Aviv). Quite a remarkable man and this certainly shut me up!\n\nLiving, laughing and learning every single day.\n\nAnd so the journey continues……\n\nAJJ’s Tips of the week:\n\nHottest restaurant: Touro – Kosher Mediterranean Cuisine with views of the golden city. We had an IR (Investment Relations) team dinner there\n\nFunniest interaction: Double my luck – I was kindly accompanied home by two Israeli brothers on Friday night in town as I felt a tad uneasy walking alone. One turns to me and says you know we are both gay! I said fabulous.\n\nNew discovery: JEST – Jerusalem Entrepreneurs Society and Technology was the first Arab Accelerator created in 2012 and is a thriving hub based in East Jerusalem\n\nCoolest Bar: Gatsby – Hidden behind an antique bookshelf is Jerusalem’s classy ‘Speak Easy’ bar. My Army and Navy cocktail was one to boast about; almond syrup, lemon, gin and egg white.\n\nStartup to be on the lookout for: Pocket Guide app – A guy I work with created this location based audio app. Download it next time you travel!\n\nShabbat Shalom from the Holy Land,\n\nAJJ 🙂\n\n31.766026 35.225366\n\nLike a little girl in a candy shop, I enter beautiful Jerusalem. It’s quite an amazing feeling to have visited a place so many times, and arrive feeling like it’s the very first time.\n\nDay one, I get dropped off in Rechavia, my new home for the next few months. My friend walks me through the old city to explore the four drastically different quarters. In the Armenian quarter, I buy a traditional craft piece; The Christian quarter pulls me down the Via Dolorosa to the site of Jesus’ tomb at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, I eat a delicious lunch in the Arabic Quarter and finally, I arrive at the Kotel (Western Wall) – the climactic site for Jewish prayer and pilgrimage. Jews from around the world pray in the direction of this wall often in tears hence the reason it is coined ‘Wailing Wall’. I say my Shmonei Esrei, (a meaningful Jewish prayer) and begin my journey in Jerusalem.\n\nJerusalem of Gold\n\nI walk through this city humming the words to the quintessential song, ‘Jerusalem of Gold’. Both in its literal and metaphorical senses, this city embodies soul, beauty and spirit. The whole city is built out of Jerusalem Stone and interestingly, has been built and rebuilt in this way for the past 3000 years. But there is something in the air in this city that I have not experienced anywhere else. People here have real purpose. They haven’t unconsciously chosen to settle in Jerusalem, they are here because their ancestors once lived here and no matter what religion or faith, they call this city home.\n\nSo, being a self proclaimed Australian ‘Tel Avivit’ – both in my free spirited nature and love of well a great party, how do I adapt to this religious and often ‘intense’ city? I have to be honest, quite easily. Call me an ignorant ‘tourist’, but staying in one of the most quaint areas of Jerusalem and working in a modern and hip office, the transition has been not only smooth but ironically rather ‘peaceful’ and heaps of fun too!\n\nOurCrowd\n\nWalking in my Herschel backpack and using my phone as navigation, I make my way to work. I stop this bike rider en route for help and he is in a Western Bulldogs jersey (Australian Football League team) with Israeli logos on it. He explains that he is playing for a mixed Arab – Jewish football team at Hebrew University and the Australians have been generous enough to donate to this cause. I smile proudly and make my way to day one of work…..\n\nFrom the minute I step into the offices at OurCrowd, I am blown-away (but in a good way). Having entered quite a few workplaces, never have I been welcomed like this. To sum it up; genuine and clever people, great work ethic and a real passion for the company and what it represents. I effervescently join the party!\n\nI spend my first week familiarising myself with the company, the many startups and well, essentially, the vivacious team. There is a palpable buzz the office with internationals visiting the office, new startups pitching their companies and locals from the area who work in similar industries. For example, I was sitting at my desk and a father and son from Columbia come to the office, so naturally I chat to them about business and life. I feel like I am sponge, thrust in the ocean absorbing all what is around me. #ILOVELEARNING\n\nA highlight of the week was attending ‘atobe’, an accelerator event at the Azrielli College of Engineering. Keynoting the night was the co-founder of Fiverr Shai Winiger, who discussed ‘The making of Fiverr ’. Like any great story his $5 idea was conceived in the shower, which made me contemplate, stop trying to force an idea, the best ones come when you are going about your normal day.\n\nAnother wonderful experience I had was a tour around Jerusalem Venture Partners Media Quarter. Situated next door to my office, this thriving startup hub mixes high-tech, creativity and social action all in the one building. I particularly enjoyed entering the Siftech office, a not-for-profit initiative for young entrepreneurs and early-stage startups to help promote Jerusalem as an attractive option post studies! Welcomed by a fellow Aussie living here for 30+ years, he straight out said to me “Caulfield, Scopus?”. Is the accent that distinct?!\n\nThe cool city I never knew existed\n\nFriday in the shuk (open air market), what a buzz! From the ‘Willy Wonka’ tahina factory, to the hundreds of challahs (and so many ‘healthier challah’ options), it was hustle and bustle through the market before the Shabbat. We had some arak (customary alcohol in this country), danced at a funky bar and welcomed the Shabbat, which in itself needs a whole blog post. In one word, magic!\n\nHad one of those pat on the back moments this weekend, sitting through my first full Hebrew movie (no subtitles) with a bit of help from a friend. The movie was called, ‘Apples from the Desert’, and is about a young girl who is brought up in Orthodox Jerusalem. She goes on a journey away from her family to a Kibbutz where she explores herself and a new way of life (Don’t worry mum, I am not moving to a kibbutz). To step out of the movie to the city where it all takes place – WOW!\n\nAJJ’s tips of the week:\n\nHottest restaurant: Rama’s Kitchen – a hidden, organic gem in the Jerusalem Hills! A shout out to the Aussie crew who I went with only mentioned this blog every dish that was served!\n\nFunniest interaction: Sitting at a small bar in the market and the guy from the bread stand next-door throws me a walnut muffin. It was delicious!\n\nNew discovery: The siren that goes off as the Shabbat enters Jerusalem.\n\nCoolest Bar: Shuka – Goa meets Berlin amongst the craziness of Machane Yehuda. Vibing!\n\nStartup to be on the lookout for: ____________ – A software driven smart irrigation system. Israel has already changed the world with irrigation systems. Watch this space……\n\nWith love from Jerusalem,\n\nAJJ"
