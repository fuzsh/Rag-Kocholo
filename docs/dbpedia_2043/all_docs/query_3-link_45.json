The same thought comes to my mind. What would happen to her democratic Constitution? Will she be able to maintain it or will she lose it again?‚Äù Dr. Ambedkar clearly articulated that #Democracy could not be taken for granted. It is, in fact, quite vulnerable. He, therefore, emphasised the need to understand the factors that may lead to democratic decline. In this episode, we explore how to identify and spot signs of democratic decline and prevent it. This is illustrated through 2 historical case studies. The cases of Ferdinand Marcos in the #Philippines and Adolf Hitler in #Germany offer valuable lessons. These case studies show how democratic institutions can be dismantled and how this impacts the lives of ordinary citizens. üìΩÔ∏è Learn about the impact of democratic decline on a country's social, economic, and political well-being through historical case studies. üìΩÔ∏è Understand the factors that lead to democratic decline. By studying these historical events, we can better recognize early warning signs and take proactive steps to preserve democracy. Join us for Part 2 of ‚ÄúLoktantra - Bade Dhoke Hai Iss Rah Mai,‚Äù where we will discuss how the public can leverage their collective power to ensure that democratic principles are upheld. We particularly encourage #education practitioners, teachers, companies and civil society organizations to use this video as an educational resource to build understanding and promote fraternity - in their schools, colleges, companies, organisations, unions. The aim is to foster inclusivity, empathy, and social cohesion in society. Let's work together to ensure fraternity is woven into the fabric of our collective consciousness.
