        "text": "This powerful collection from an international mix of respected academics, newer voices and political activists eplxores the place of Israel as a Jewish state in today's modern world - a world in which identities, citizenship and human rights are defined in increasingly cosmopolitan and inclusive ways. Offering compelling and comprehensive arguments as to why Israel falls into the category of an ethnocratic state, the contributors to this volume explore four central themes. They reveal the reality behind Israel's founding myths. They document the experience of some of those who have fallen victim to this ethnic state. Then, they draw comparisons with other ethnic states, notable South Africa, and finally, they point towards the radical hope of achieving a single nation, united, peaceful and just. Unpacking both Jewish and Palestinian nationalism, the nation state, and ethnic nationalism, this fascinating collection offers new insights into one of the world's most intractable conflicts. It will appeal not only to scholars and teachers, but to anyone interested in the history, politics, anthropology and legal standing of Palestine-Israel.\n\nFew thoughts on dogs that do not bark, the difference between Jerusalem and Philadelphia, and why Meir Ariel got it right while Yehonatan Geffen didn’t. Ah yes, and about the problems I find in the nation-state Basic Law. For a more formal abstract (written by the editors of Fathom): In this long read Dubnov writes as ‘a Jewish citizen of Israel, and by this virtue – a member of the fortunate, favored group that is privileged by the new legislation passed in summer 2018 – namely, the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People.’ Dubnov indicts the law because of what it lacks – ‘any promise of equality and democracy, a Bill of Rights of any kind, that takes into consideration the non-Jewish citizens of Israel’ – and because of the real-world political context in which it is being enacted and from which it derives its meaning: ‘populist campaigns against “politically correctness,” toleration of others and basic norms of civility, alongside increased attempts by state authorities to curtail the activities of NGOs and human rights activists, targeted as “radical” and the weakening commitment of the Israeli legislature to the democratic rules of the game.’ Dubnov identifies four reasons liberal democrats should be worried by the law: its treatment of ‘Jewish settlement’, Jerusalem, the Arabic language, and Israel-Diaspora relations. He also notes with alarm the place accorded to the Druze in the new law.\n\nThe Ethnic Democracy model hinges on a complex political principle that sanctions undisguised bias in favour of a specific ethnic group. Thus, it is a system whose hierarchical design must, by its very nature, ignore any notion of democratic equality. The organising principle of Ethnic Democracy holds that the dominating or majority ethnic group shall have exclusive access to power, self-determination, and will have superior status in the socio-political life of the nation. Over and above its moral shortcomings, the feasibility of this model for governing in deeply divided societies should be examined to understand how Ethnic Democracy variously affects different social groups and how its architects envision the state's commitments to its citizens. To that end, this paper has examined the case of Israel as example of this system. The social inequalities that separate Jews and Arabs are clear indication of an institutional bias that favours the Jewish ethnic group to the detriment of Israeli Arabs, despite Israel's reputation as an impartial parliamentary democracy. In order to develop a cogent line of reasoning with which to analyse Israel's ethno-democratic traits, this paper offers a parallel reading of Let It Be Morning, a novel written by the Arab Israeli writer Sayed Kashua, and the groundbreaking essay \"Ethnic Democracy: Israel as an Archetype\", written by the Israeli sociologist Sammy Smooha."
