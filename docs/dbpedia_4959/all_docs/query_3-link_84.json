Good luck,\" commented another.\n\n\"Wishing you all the best,\" added a third fan.\n\nUNEXPECTED PREGNANCY\n\nIn February, Peta revealed to fans she was expecting in a video that captured her surprising Maksim with the pregnancy news.\n\nDuring the video, the DWTS regular hinted that the pregnancy was unexpected.\n\nPeta broke the exciting news with an Instagram post.\n\n\"We Are Having A Baby,\" the caption began.\n\n\"Yes we knowâ€¦ we just had a babyâ€¦ haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are so happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!\" she continued at the time.\n\n\"Surprising [Maksim] on this FaceTime with my two friends secretly filming from different angles made it all the more hilarious,\" Peta explained.\n\n\"It took one hour for me to get the courage to call him and when he wasnâ€™t catching on we all couldnâ€™t stop laughing in the kitchen. I had the 'Iâ€™m so sick story' the pickle and 2 bottles HAHA! Oh Maks.\"\n\nThe dancing competition star concluded the pregnancy reveal by stating, \"Big thank you to [baby service Bobbie] for helping us shake things up and for being a part of this special announcement!\n\n\"After everything weâ€™ve been through with miscarriages and IVF weâ€™re beyond blessed and know we are uber lucky for this miracle to happen to us.\"\n\nIn a special message to fans, Peta added, \"Weâ€™re just so happy that we can finally tell you guys the good news.\"\n\nBIG REVEAL\n\nThe video showed Peta surprising Maksim with the pregnancy news during a FaceTime call.\n\nBefore making the call, Peta exclaimed, \"He is not gonna know what hit him.\"\n\n\"I just gave birth!\" she added.\n\nWhile on the call Peta played it cool as she told Maksim that she felt \"nauseous\" all day as he prepared for a dancing lesson.\n\nThe dancer teased, \"I did a test\" but then covered her tracks by stating that she doesn't have Covid.\n\nPeta then told her husband, \"I think we need to move out of Malibu and get a bigger place.\n\n\"I feel like we need another, extra bedroom,\" she continued.\n\nConfused, Maksim attempted to end the call but stopped when he noticed the star preparing two bottles of formula.\n\nHe asked, \"Why is there two bottles? What are you doing?\"\n\nPeta showed him the pregnancy test and admitted, \"This is what I'm trying to tell you.\"\n\nDumbfounded, Maksim stated, \"Babe, stop. No way,\" before asking, \"Babe, you're pregnant?\"\n\nPeta excitedly exclaimed, \"Yes! I'm pregnant!\"\n\nShe jokingly added, \"Babe, we're in trouble,\" as an emotional Maksim admitted, \"I'm so... I'm very happy.\"\n\nROUGH PREGNANCY\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The U.S. Sun, Maksim revealed that Peta was having a more difficult time with her third pregnancy than she did carrying their other kids as she neared her due date.\n\nDuring the sit-down, Maksim gushed over becoming a dad for the third time despite he and Peta not expecting to have another child so soon.\n\n\"We were told a long time ago when we started to have kids that it's easier when they're close in age because of schooling and clothing and stuff like that,\" The Traitors star said before explaining how the bonding time with his oldest son for so many years as an only child strengthened their relationship.\n\n\"To be honest with you, we had an incredible time with Shai, our firstborn, and we got, again, stuck in a pandemic with a 3-year-old... putting a lot of time into just that one person.\n\n\"So our relationship with Shai as a mom, dad and son is very, very tight because it was built on all attention to this one,\" Maks noted.\n\nThe Ukrainian dancer then shared that he hopes to create the same type of closeness with his two younger kiddos, even though his attention will be divided.\n\n\"I want to find the same way of establishing these connections and relationships with a tribe of people in the house. We'll figure it out. They're a lot of fun,\" the TV star added.\n\nHowever, as Maks and Peta got closer to delivering their baby boy, the Broadway star admitted that his former DWTS co-star isn't doing as well as she had in her previous pregnancies.\n\n\"Peta's having a tough time right now. She's [nearing the] finish line already, and [her belly is] very heavy for her body and for her frame. You know, this kid is a big one,\" Maks told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Shai was a certain weight and height. Our second baby, Rio, is bigger by all sorts of standard measurements and all that. This kid, this third one, is supposed to be the biggest. I feel bad for Peta,\" the reality star confessed.\n\nMaksim and Peta entered a relationship in 2012 - and called it quits numerous times before getting engaged.\n\nThe two announced their engagement on December 5, 2015, and tied the knot on July 8, 2017.\n\nShai Aleksander was born in January of 2017.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the two welcomed their son, Rio. In an Instagram post, the two wrote, \"Rio John Chmerkovskiy Born 6.18.2023 8.6 oz and thriving!\n\n\"We are overjoyed to share our baby boy with all of you.\""
