        "text": "Heavy fighting continues as Russian forces look to takeover Ukraine on the invasion's fifth day. Satellite images showed a miles-long convoy preparing to enter the capital city of Kyiv in what could present a major blow to the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nBeyond Kyiv, Russian heavy artillery continues to rain rockets down on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv.\n\nWhile an exact death toll remains hard to pinpoint, the United Nations is estimating significant casualties on both the Ukrainian and Russian sides. Additionally, over 500,000 Ukrainians have been forced to flee their country as refugees, and up to four million people could be displaced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe international response to the invasion continues to be prolonged, with countries enacting further sanctions against both Russian individuals and companies.\n\nU.S. and international intelligence communities have said that, despite the mounting pressure, Russian forces were likely unprepared for the significant defensive that has been mounted by Ukrainian freedom fighters.\n\nNewsweek's live coverage has now ended.\n\n11:47 PM EST\n\nAir raid sirens blare as invasion of Ukraine continues\n\nThree administrative regions in western Ukraine have been warned of air raids, according to a tweet from The Kyiv Independent.\n\nAs the Russian military continues its incursion into Ukraine, the regions of Volyn, Ternopil and Rivne have all been put on alert for air raids. Volyn shares a border with Poland, a member of NATO.\n\nRussian forces began launching air strikes in Ukraine as part of the invasion of the country. So far, there are indications that Russian airstrikes have been surgical and have damaged military facilities while keeping some assets, like airfields, in tact, according to a Newsweek analysis.\n\nEarlier on Monday, multiple European countries and the U.S. said they would provide military aid to Ukraine, including fighter jets.\n\n11:26 PM EST\n\nUnited Nations Planning For Up To 4M Ukrainian Refugees In Coming Weeks\n\nThe United Nations (U.N.) says that up to four million refugees could be forced out of Ukraine in the coming weeks if the invasion by Russia doesn't subside.\n\nAt least 520,000 people have already been forced to flee as a result of the fighting, said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. It does not appear that that number is going to slow down anytime soon, Grandi added.\n\nDespite the impending crisis, numerous countries surrounding Ukraine have pledged to let refugees cross their borders to safety. This includes Hungary, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Romania, all of whom have welcomed Ukrainian refugees with open arms.\n\nAdditionally, Ukrainian refugees do not currently require a visa to enter the European Union. This has caused some people to flee to nations that are situated farther towards the western edge of Europe, such as Germany - where at least 1,800 Ukrainians have already arrived.\n\nThe United States, along with a number of other NATO allies, has also pledged to take in as many refugees from the area as possible.\n\n11:23 PM EST\n\nTaiwan ships medical supplies in act of solidarity with Ukraine\n\nTaiwan has shipped 27 tons of medical supplies to Ukraine in a gesture it described as helping fight \"the expansion of authoritarianism.\"\n\nAnnouncing the donation on Twitter, foreign minister Joseph Wu referenced the close alliance between Russia and China, which has laid claim to Taiwan as a breakaway province.\n\n\"While #China sides with #Russia in an \"unlimited alliance,\" #Taiwan is with freedom & democracy fighting the expansion of authoritarianism,\" wrote Wu. \"I have faith: Democracy will prevail!\"\n\nChina has called for negotiations over Ukraine despite its increasingly close strategic relationship to Russia.\n\n10:57 PM EST\n\nUkraine Sets Up Hotline For Families of Russian Prisoners Of War\n\nUkrainian officials have set up a phone hotline that will help connect Russian families with prisoners of war in order to shed light on the conditions in Ukraine.\n\nThis hotline, according to the Army Times, is reportedly called Ishchi Svoikh or 'Look For Your Own' and is designed to show Russian citizens the true happenings in Ukraine following the invasion, as opposed to what is shown on Russian state television.\n\nAmong the services offered by the hotline will be a channel in which Russian mothers can call in to see if their sons have been killed in the fighting. This was reportedly done in an effort to drum up sympathy for the Ukrainian cause among Russians, many of whom have already expressed their opposition to war.\n\nAs the push to get factual information through Russian lines continues, varying reports over the weekend said that both Twitter and Facebook have been blocked in Russia in an attempt to downplay the violence in Ukraine.\n\n10:34 PM EST\n\nRussian invasion already spurring changes to Europe's energy infrastructure\n\nCalling the war against a Ukraine a \"watershed moment\" for Europe's energy system, a EU official outlined how the conflict is already reshaping how gas and electricity flow across the continent.\n\nEU energy commissioner Kadri Simson on Monday described the steps being taken by member states and Ukraine to reduce reliance on energy-rich Russia. Speaking to reporters following a meeting of the EU's energy council, Simson said the Russian military attacked Ukraine the same day the country was conducting tests that would pave the way for its synchronize its grid with the EU.\n\nUkraine's energy minister German Galushchenko said his nation will not reconnect its grid back to Russia and will instead seek and emergency synchronization with the EU, said Simson.\n\nIn the meantime, he said Ukraine needs \"our very practical, immediate help\" covering diesel, petrol, jet fuel, and generators.\n\nWhile the EU can get through the winter safely, he said it's looking for alternative gas supplies, increased storage and infrastructure upgrades to make sure it gets where it's most needed.\n\n\"Following the measures taken by the EU and the international community to sanction Russia, we cannot exclude that Russia will take retaliatory steps that will impact energy trade,\" he said. \"A full disruption would be a challenge for us, but we have tools in place to handle the implications.\"\n\n10:27 PM EST\n\nWarner Bros Follows Disney's Lead, Halts Release of 'The Batman' in Russia\n\nJust hours after The Walt Disney Company announced it would stop showing new theatrical films in Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, Warner Bros. Pictures says it will pause the release of the upcoming movie The Batman in Russia as well.\n\n\"In light of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, WarnerMedia is pausing the release of its feature film The Batman in Russia,\" Warner Bros. parent company WarnerMedia said in a statement. \"We will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves. We hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to this tragedy.\"\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated films of 2022, The Batman was slated to be released in Russia on March 3. Another large Warner Bros. production, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, is due to be released on Russian screens on April 14, and it remains to be seen if Warner Bros. will similarly pull the plug.\n\nThe decision follows Monday's announcement from Disney that the media conglomerate was halting the release of new theatrical films in Russia, dealing a major blow to one of the largest Hollywood markets outside of the United States. This includes films being produced or made by any subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association (MPA), the entertainment industry's main lobbying group, also released a statement on the Russian invasion, saying that the organization \"stands with the international community in upholding the rule of law and condemning Russia.\"\n\n10:15 PM EST\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation indefinitely bans Russian teams\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation issued a blanket suspension of all Russian and Belarusian teams in all of its competitions \"until further notice.\"\n\nThe federation's extraordinary move is the latest in the ongoing economic, cultural and diplomatic fallout Russia faces over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"The IIHF strongly condemns the use of military force and urges the use of diplomatic means to solve conflict,\" the federation said in a statement.\n\nThe federation's council made the decision follow a meeting on Monday where it evaluated \"the impact of the current war.\" The decision means teams from Russia and its ally Belarus won't be able to participate in multiple upcoming events.\n\nIn addition to banning participation by all clubs from the countries, the federation is also withdrawing 2023 IIHF World Junior Championship hosting rights from Russia over what the federation says is concern for the safety of players, officials and fans.\n\n\"The IIHF is not a political entity and cannot influence the decisions being taken over the war in Ukraine,\" said IIHF President Luc Tardif in a statement. \"We nevertheless have a duty of care to all of our members and participants and must therefore do all we can to ensure that we are able to operate our events in a safe environment for all teams taking part in the IIHF World Championship program.\"\n\n09:56 PM EST\n\nUkraine Asks U.S. For More Weaponry to Fight Russian Aggression\n\nWhile a number of countries have sent Ukraine additional resources in their fight against the Russian invasion, Ukrainian officials have asked the United States to procure additional weaponry.\n\nOksana Markarova, Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., said Monday following a meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill that her nation needs significantly higher numbers of weapons in order to push back against the Russian military. Following the meeting, news emerged that the U.S. is preparing additional funding to help Ukraine.\n\nSenator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) called the attack a \"David versus Goliath\" scenario.\n\n\"I think that any human being reading the reports coming out of there realize that this is dire,\" Risch said, adding that Congress was implementing an \"all of the above\" effort to help the Ukrainians.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.), who stressed that the Ukrainian soldiers were in desperate need of more guns.\n\nThe request for additional arms comes as other countries, many of which have often remained neutral during recent conflicts, have pledged to send weapons to Ukraine. This includes Finland, who sent a cache of military supplies and anti-tank armaments to the Ukrainian people.\n\nCanada has also pledged to provide similar military-based assistance to Ukraine while also banning oil imports from Russia.\n\nThe White House and President Joe Biden, meanwhile, are requesting a total of $6.4 billion in humanitarian aid for Ukraine.\n\n09:40 PM EST\n\nSecretary of State reinforces \"steadfast support\" to Ukraine following phone call\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the U.S. remains committed to \"holding Russia accountable for its brutal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nBlinken made the comment in a tweet following a conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. The two discussed what Blinken called America's \"steadfast support\" for the country's people.\n\n\"We stand with Ukraine,\" said Blinken.\n\nKuleba, in a corresponding tweet, said Blinken \"affirmed that the U.S. support for Ukraine remains unfaltering.\"\n\n\"I underscored that Ukraine craves for peace, but as long as we are under Russia's assault we need more sanctions and weapons,\" Kuleba said. \"Secretary assured me of both. We coordinated further steps.\"\n\nOn Friday, the White House approved $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n09:27 PM EST\n\nSenator Chris Murphy Says Russians \"Have Fallen Behind Their Timeline\" For Invasion\n\nSenator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) says that Russians have \"fallen behind their timeline\" for the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMurphy made the comments Monday following a classified intelligence briefing on the situation. The senator said on Twitter that: \"Ukrainian resistance has been fierce and there have been multiple Russian equipment and logistics failures.\"\n\nMurphy, Connecticut's junior senator, added in a string of tweets that U.S. government agencies were working to pass a federal budget in order to provide further aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"There is no way for our national security agencies to be nimble enough to support Ukraine if they are operating on the 2020/21 budget,\" Murphy said.\n\nIn terms of the logistics of the war, Murphy said that U.S. intelligence officers believe: \"The ability to keep supply lines running to Ukraine remains alive, but Russia will try to encircle and cut off Kiev in the next several weeks.\"\n\n\"The fight for Kiev will be long and bloody and Ukrainians are rapidly preparing for street to street combat,\" Murphy added. \"The U.S. and allies are coordinating to not only freeze the assets of Putin and his oligarch allies, but to seize those assets as well. This is likely a further step than Putin's inner circle anticipated.\"\n\nMurphy is one of a number of politicians who have called for harsher restrictions to be imposed on Russia as the invasion of Ukraine continues.\n\n09:00 PM EST\n\nFinland to Send 1,500 Anti-Tank Weapons to Assist Ukraine\n\nFinland says that it will send 1,500 anti-tank weapons, along with a number of other armaments, to Ukraine to assist them in defending against Russian invaders.\n\nThe anti-tank weapons are designed to stop the advancement of Russian tanks and artillery.\n\n\"The anti-tank weapons can be used to fight armoured vehicles,\" Finnish Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen told reporters Monday.\n\nIn addition to this weaponry, the Finnish military is also giving Ukraine numerous other tools to help supply their army. This includes 2,500 assault rifles, 1,500 charges for the anti-tank devices, 70,000 ration packs, and 150,000 ammunition cartridges.\n\nTwo large mobile field hospitals will also be provided for use by the Ukrainian military.\n\nThe assistance marks a change in Finnish foreign policy. Since 1956, the country has maintained a neutral or non-aligned stance with the Soviet Union - later Russia.\n\nFinland also had a policy of not supplying deadly weapons to other nations, which now appears to have been scrapped.\n\n08:38 PM EST\n\nStephen King posts rare selfie in support of Ukraine\n\nRenowned horror author Stephen King tweeted Monday he would throw his support behind Ukraine.\n\nKing, the author of It and The Shining, posted a photo of himself wearing a T-shirt with the slogan \"I stand with Ukraine\" against a backdrop of a bookcase. The shirt included an image of a raised fist, cast in Ukraine's national colors of yellow and blue.\n\n\"I don't usually post pictures of myself, but today is an exception,\" said King, in the tweet.\n\nA day earlier, King took a swipe at Russian President Vladimir Putin, writing on Twitter: \"For the first time in a long and infamous career, Putin looks stupid. It must come as a shock to him.\"\n\n08:34 PM EST\n\nEastern European allies sending over 70 aircraft to Ukraine\n\nThree NATO members in eastern Europe are donating fighter jets to Ukraine as it seeks to repel the better-armed Russian military.\n\nUkraine's parliament on Monday Tweeted that it would get the aircrafts from Bulgaria, Poland and Slovakia.\n\n\"+70 planes for the Ukrainian army!\" the tweet said. \"Our partners give us the MiG-29 and Su-25!\"\n\nThe tweet referenced two Soviet-designed aircrafts. The MiG-29, which was designed in response to the American F-15 and F-16. The Su-2 is a subsonic fighter jet.\n\nPoland will provide the most support with 28 MiG-29s, along with 12 from Slovakia and 16 from Bulgaria, along with 14 Su-25s from Bulgaria.\n\nEuropean Union security head Josep Borrell Fontelles said over the weekend that defense ministers had approved a package of support for Ukraine. He called the EU's support for Ukraine \"a turning point in history of European integration.\"\n\n08:32 PM EST\n\nUkrainian Woman Shows How To Operate Abandoned Russian Tank\n\nAs Ukrainians continue to fight back against the invasion of their country from Russia, some people are taking to social media to help people learn aspects of warfare. This includes one woman who posted a now-viral video on TikTok in which she describes how to operate and drive an abandoned Russian tank.\n\nIn the first frame of the video, the woman is seen climbing out of the tank before the footage transitions to the driver's cabin. At this point, the woman, who appears to be speaking in either Ukrainian or Russian, then walks through the different controls of the tank.\n\nThis includes showing off the different buttons, knobs and switches used to control the vehicle, as well as describing how to turn on the engines, operate the gas and brakes, and steer.\n\nIt is unclear where the video takes place, or the conditions in which the woman came across the abandoned tank.\n\nFollowing the Ukrainian invasion, videos of the Ukrainian people fighting against Russian soldiers continue to make the rounds on social media.\n\nOne such video showed people being handed weapons to use in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Another video showed a line of people donating used bottles in order to make molotov cocktails.\n\n08:21 PM EST\n\nFacebook blocking Russian state media in EU\n\nFacebook's parent company Meta says it's restricting Russian-backed state media RT and Sputnik in the European Union after authorities complained they were spreading misinformation.\n\nNick Clegg, the company's vice president for global affairs, said on Twitter Monday that it clamp down on the pair of Kremlin-funded and controlled media outlets \"given the exceptional nature of the current situation.\" He said the company made the move in response to requests from a \"number of governments\" and the European Union.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, announced in a statement Sunday that the union would take new measures to responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Those measures included the \"unprecedented step\" of banning \"the Kremlin's media machine.\"\n\n\"The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin's war and to sow division in our Union,\" she said. \"So we are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.\"\n\n08:01 PM EST\n\nTikTok Blocks Russian Networks RT, Sputnik in European Union\n\nThe social media company TikTok says that it has blocked access to RT and Sputnik, two Russian state-backed government news agencies, in the European Union.\n\nRT, in particular, has been named as one of the greatest sources of misinformation relating to the invasion. The channel has also broadcast American media such as Fox News' Tucker Carlson.\n\nAs Russia's invasion of Ukraine escalates, TikTok, along with a number of other social media platforms, is being used to disseminate misinformation about the attack, according to reports. Despite this, Russian authorities continue to deny that this is part of a coordinated effort to spread false information.\n\nFollowing the announcement from TikTok, the French digital affairs minister, Cédric O, urged other platforms to similarly block access to RT and Sputnik.\n\n\"I want to thank @tiktok_France for responsible decisions made today,\" O said in a tweet translated from French. \"Russian propaganda does not fall under freedom of information. We ask other social networks to apply the same decisions.\"\n\nDespite these actions, though, it was noted that access to these networks on TikTok is still available in both the United Kingdom as well as Ukraine itself.\n\n07:40 PM EST\n\nUkrainians Stand at Attention for National Anthem Inside Bomb Shelter\n\nA viral video shows Ukrainians standing at attention inside a makeshift bomb shelter as a man plays the Ukrainian national anthem on a trumpet.\n\nAs the man plays, numerous people can be seen surrounding him, many with their hands over their hearts. The performance took place in an underground subway tunnel that was being used to shield people from Russian bomb blasts.\n\nA number of people on Twitter noted that the title of the Ukrainian national anthem translated into English means: \"Glory and Freedom of Ukraine Has Not Yet Perished,\" and the song has been making its way across social media in the aftermath of the Russian attack.\n\nSubway stations, in particular, have become one of the main sources of makeshift bomb shelters as the Russians continue their invasion of Ukraine. Those who were unable to make it to a subway were encouraged to seek safety in a basement or other underground area.\n\n07:24 PM EST\n\nDisney To Stop Releasing Films In Russia\n\nThe Walt Disney Company says it will stop releasing theatrical films in Russia due to the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis, we are pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, including the upcoming Turning Red from Pixar,\" a spokesperson for Disney said. \"We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation. In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.\"\n\nDisney becomes one of the first major movie production studios to pause its film distribution amidst the Ukrainian invasion.\n\nIt was noted that Russia is one of the largest overseas markets for American studios. In 2021, Box Office Mojo listed box office returns in the country of $445 million.\n\nDeadline Hollywood noted that the Motion Picture Association is also expected to address the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.\n\n07:04 PM EST\n\n26 New Russians Have Been Added To European Union Blacklist\n\nThe European Union (EU) has slapped 26 more Russian individuals with sanctions, restricting them from conducting business within the EU. A total of 680 people and 53 organizations in Russia have now been sanctioned by the EU.\n\nThese 26 people include Russian \"oligarchs and businessmen active in the oil, banking and finance sectors, as well as government members, and high level military personalities, and propagandists,\" the EU said in a press release.\n\nThe restrictions on the 26 people include a variety of obstacles designed to put pressure on Russian businesses. This includes the freezing of assets within the EU, during which European funds will not be available to any of the sanctioned Russians.\n\nA travel ban on these Russians also prevents them from entering the EU, the press release said.\n\n\"With these additional sanctions, we are targeting all who are having a significant economic role in supporting Putin's regime, and benefit financially from the system,\" said Josep Borrell, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. \"These sanctions will expose the wealth of Putin's elite. Those who enable the invasion of Ukraine will pay a price for their action.\"\n\n06:38 PM EST\n\nRussia Used Deadly Vacuum Bomb, Says Ukrainian Ambassador\n\nAs the invasion of Ukraine continues, Russian forces have used a deadly vacuum bomb, according to Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova.\n\n\"They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva Convention,\" Markarova said. \"The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.\"\n\nA vacuum bomb, also called an aerosol bomb or thermobaric bomb, sucks in oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere to generate a longer and higher-temperature explosion. This makes vacuum bombs much deadlier than conventional explosives, with reports that the weapons can destroy entire city blocks and vaporize bodies.\n\nCNN reported over the weekend that a Russian vehicle used to launch vacuum bombs was seen crossing the Ukrainian border.\n\n\"[Russia] should pay a heavy price,\" Markarova told reporters Monday following a meeting with Congress. She added that Ukraine was working with President Joe Biden to implement additional sanctions against Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n06:23 PM EST\n\nCanada Prohibits Imports of Russian Crude Oil\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government is banning all imports of Russian crude oil in an effort to ratchet up economic pressure on the country for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrudeau made the announcement on Monday, saying on Twitter that the sector accounts for more than one-third of Russia's federal budget revenue. However, he said the measure is symbolic because Canada \"has barely imported any Russian oil and gas in recent years,\" adding, that \"this move sends a powerful message.\"\n\nIn addition to the ban on Russian crude oil, Trudeau announced other measures.\n\nHe said he will ask Canadian regulators to begin reviewing the presence of Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed television network commonly referred to as RT, in the country's airwaves.\n\n\"Because we cannot allow falsehoods, propaganda, and disinformation about Russia's war to continue spreading in Canada,\" said Trudeau.\n\nCanada will also supply Ukraine with anti-tank weapon systems and upgraded ammunition, following its previous shipments of military equipment.\n\n05:55 PM EST\n\nU.S., Allies Discuss Ongoing Response to Russia\n\nPresident Joe Biden hosted a call with U.S. Allies and partners Monday regarding the unified response against Russia's invasion into Ukraine.\n\nThe 11 leaders spoke on the \"secure\" call late Monday morning about continued support and consequences.\n\n\"The leaders recognized the bravery of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russian aggression and discussed their continued support to Ukraine, including security, economic, and humanitarian assistance,\" the White House said in a statement. \"They also discussed their coordinated efforts to impose severe costs and consequences to hold Russia accountable while working to maintain global economic stability, including with regard to energy prices.\"\n\nThe leaders who joined Biden on the call, included: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Polish President Andrzej Duda, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n05:36 PM EST\n\nU.S. Expels 12 Russian Diplomats Over 'Undiplomatic Activities'\n\nThe U.S. says it is expelling 12 U.N. Russian diplomats for engaging in activities that don't follow their responsibilities and obligations as diplomats.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Richard Mills confirmed the expulsions after Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the U.N. Security Council on Monday afternoon that he had just been informed of \"yet another hostile step undertaken by the host country\" against Russia.\n\nNebenzia told reporters that the diplomats had been asked to leave by March 7, adding, that Russia would respond to the move \"because it's diplomatic practice.\"\n\nHe also called the U.S. expulsions a \"gross violation\" of the U.N. agreement with the U.S. as it's the host of the U.N. and the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations.\n\n05:15 PM EST\n\nPsaki 'Thanks' Putin for Unifying NATO\n\nThe U.S. has not ruled out the possibility of imposing a policy to ban the purchase of Russian gas, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. Psaki, however, pointed to the private sector for choosing where products are acquired.\n\n\"The U.S. government doesn't dictate where the U.S. market sells our own oil and gas products nor where it acquires crude or refined products for domestic consumption,\" she said during Monday's briefing. \"This is all up to the private sector.\"\n\nPsaki explained further energy sanctions are being weighed to maximize the impact on Putin while minimizing the impact on the global markets and the American people.\n\n\"We have not taken some steps on energy sanctions in part because we weigh that,\" Psaki said, who also referenced the growing concern in Europe as gas prices there skyrocket.\n\n\"Sanctioning energy would affect Russia's income stream, certainly that would be a reason to do it, but it would also have extreme consequences on the world energy markets, particularly for our allies in Europe,\" she said.\n\nPsaki \"thanks\" Putin for unifying NATO:\n\nPsaki explained escalatory sanctions, including those announced over the weekend, have been made in coordination and alignment with the Europeans.\n\n\"President Putin has been one of the greatest unifiers of NATO in modern history,\" Psaki said. \"So I guess that is one thing we can thank him for.\"\n\nU.S. response to Zelensky's no-fly zone request:\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked President Joe Biden and NATO to impose a no-fly zone over \"significant parts\" of Ukraine. Psaki said Biden is against the move, as he's stated his intention to not send U.S. troops to fight Russia.\n\n\"The president has been very clear that he is not intending to send U.S. troops to fight a war with Russia,\" Psaki explained. \"That is essentially what this would be a step toward.\"\n\n\"A no-fly zone would require implementation, it would require deploying U.S. military to enforce which would be a potential direct conflict, potentially a war with Russia, which is something we are not planning to be a part of.\"\n\n05:00 PM EST\n\nICC Prosecutor Opens Investigation on Situation in Ukraine\n\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan QC, announced Monday in a statement that he has decided to open an investigation into the situation in Ukraine as quickly as possible.\n\n\"In particular, I am satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine in relation to the events already assessed during the preliminary examination by the Office. Given the expansion of the conflict in recent days, it is my intention that this investigation will also encompass any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my Office that are committed by any party to the conflict on any part of the territory of Ukraine,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHe added that he'd be asking for budgetary support for voluntary contributions.\n\n\"I will also be asking for the support of all States Parties and the international community as a whole as my Office sets about its investigations. I will be calling for additional budgetary support, for voluntary contributions to support all our situations, and for the loan of gratis personnel. The importance and urgency of our mission is too serious to be held hostage to lack of means.\"\n\nKhan said he would continue to closely follow developments on the ground in Ukraine, and call for restraint and strict adherence to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law.\n\n04:40 PM EST\n\nEconomic Impacts of U.S. Sanctions Against Russia\n\nThe U.S. sanctions against Russia are already impacting Russian financial institutions, the State Department said.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said the U.S. has seen the Russian financial system react as expected to the severity and scale of those measures.\n\nSome of those impacts include:\n\nThe ruble, Russia's currency, has fallen 20 percent and is currently at its \"weakest level ever,\" Price said.\n\nRussia's stock market was closed Monday and will remain closed tomorrow. Price said this was likely due to fear of capital flight if it were to open and added that keeping the stock market closed means Russia is in a \"precarious situation.\"\n\nThe Central Bank of Russia more than doubled its key interest rate to 20 percent. Price said this interest rate is the highest in almost 20 years and is \"not something a country can sustain.\"\n\nThe Central Bank also instituted capital control by ordering domestic brokers to reject foreign bids to sell Russian securities.\n\nRussian authorities are forcing exporters to sell at least 80 percent of their foreign currency that they receive to \"prop up the rapidly weakening [Russian] currency.\"\n\nThe S&P downgraded Russia's credit rating to \"junk status\" following the announcement of the U.S. sanctions.\n\nPrice said that the U.S. has \"cut off\" Putin's ability to weather the sanction storm from the West.\n\n04:17 PM EST\n\nPresident Biden Says Americans Shouldn't Fear Nuclear War\n\nPresident Joe Biden reassured Americans who may be concerned about a nuclear war.\n\nAs he was leaving a Black History Month event at the White House on Monday, the president was asked whether or not Americans should be worried about a nuclear war breaking out.\n\nHis response? \"No.\"\n\nLess than a week into the invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's nuclear forces to be put on high alert after the international community piled on sanctions and isolated the country.\n\nThough the U.S. and Russia have the largest nuclear arsenal globally, Russia has reportedly never used a nuclear weapon during war.\n\n03:59 PM EST\n\nU.S is Prepared to Escalate Sanctions Against Russia\n\nThe U.S. is ready to escalate sanctions against Russia if the invasion into Ukraine continues.\n\n\"If Russia continues to escalate, these measures will be calibrated accordingly. We are prepared to escalate further,\" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a press briefing Monday.\n\nHe said sanctions are a \"means to an end\" and the end the U.S. wants to achieve means an end to conflict, war and the loss of life in Ukraine.\n\n\"Economic measures will apply pressure on Russia to do the right thing, to bring end to [the] conflict,\" Price said, adding, that if Russia does engage in genuine deescalation, the U.S. is also prepared to scale back its sanctions.\n\n03:40 PM EST\n\nRussian Forces Attempt to Move Closer to Kyiv, Pentagon Says\n\nPentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Russian forces are trying to move closer to Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, but still are outside of the city center.\n\nUkrainians are resisting the Russian invasion \"quite effectively around Kyiv\" making it \"a tough slog for the Russians to move further south,\" he said Monday during a briefing at the Pentagon.\n\n\"You got to hand it to the Ukrainians, who have been fighting very hard for their country and making an impact and making a dent on Mr. Putin's abilities,\" Kirby said, adding that the Kremlin is dealing with \"stiff and determined resistance\" as well as \"logistics and sustainment problems\" of its own.\n\nKirby responded with an emphatic \"no\" when asked whether the U.S. considers instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\n\n03:22 PM EST\n\nNorway to Send Weapons to Ukraine\n\nNorway has joined a growing list of countries sending weapons to Ukraine to combat Russia's invasion.\n\nNorway will donate up to 2,000 M72 anti-tank weapons, the government announced Monday.\n\n\"The government decided this afternoon that Norway will offer arms support to enable Ukraine to defend itself against the military attack from Russia,\" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said.\n\n\"We are therefore aligning our actions with our close allies and the other Nordic countries. Norway has a restrictive policy with regard to exporting defence-related products, but Ukraine is now in a desperate and extraordinary situation.\"\n\nMonday's decision overturns the country's policy of not sending arms to non-NATO countries at war or at risk of armed conflict, Reuters reports. The policy has been in place since the 1950s.\n\n03:01 PM EST\n\nWATCH: White House Press Briefing\n\nThe White House daily press briefing is set to begin momentarily, as Russia's invasion into Ukraine continues for a fifth day.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki will hold Monday's briefing, set to begin at 3 p.m. ET.
