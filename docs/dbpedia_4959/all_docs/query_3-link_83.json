        "text": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy has been documenting his escape from his native Ukraine to Poland amid Russia's invasion of the Eastern European country.\n\nThe former Dancing With the Stars pro, 42, detailed in Instagram Story posts the \"traumatizing\" experience of traveling on a cramped train to the Polish border on Monday, following his arrest in Kyiv. He hasn't specified why he was arrested.\n\nIn an update on Tuesday, Chmerkovskiy revealed that he had made it to an unspecified location minutes away from the Polish border as the journey continued. His video can be viewed at the top of his article.\n\nDocumenting the start of his journey, the Odessa-born dancer wrote on Monday: \"We made it on the train. We're heading to Warsaw (hopefully). Train to Lviv was not an option.\n\n\"The situation at the train station is insane. AT first it feels manageable, but it gets A LOT worse when it comes time to actually board the train. Long story but all I can say now is that I'm a big man with nothing but a backpack it's TRAUMATIZING.\n\n\"Currently I'm in a cabin with 4 adults and 7 kids (ages 2-11) which usually is only occupied by maximum of 3 people. There's usually up to 30 people in this particular wagon. We were told we have to fit 135. Walkways are packed. People everywhere. It's sweaty and claustrophobic.\"\n\nHe added in a later post that \"what finally broke\" him was seeing a young boy \"hysterically crying and not wanting to let go of his father.\"\n\nU.S.-based Chmerkovskiy, who had traveled to his home country to work on a project titled World of Dance UA, quoted the child as saying: \"If you stay I want to stay too because if they kill you I won't be able to help.\"\n\nThe dancer's journey started after he was detained by law enforcement, though it was not immediately made clear why he was arrested.\n\n\"The streets are crazy,\" he said in an earlier update. \"At one point I got arrested but again all good, promise. That was probably the least traumatizing moment in this whole thing as far as Ukraine is concerned, but for me, it was just a reality check.\"\n\nHe added of his planned journey: \"I'm going to try and make my way out. I'm going to start making my way towards the border. I have options. Just a little nervous but I think it's going to be alright. I know it's going to be OK.\"\n\nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops close in on Kyiv, Chmerkovskiy has shared a constant flow of footage and photos of the ensuing destruction.\n\nFighting back tears in a clip shared on Sunday, he said: \"I'm in a very safe place but this is nuts and I think everybody is going through a lot of emotions and I think it's time I expose mine in a more personal manner.\"\n\n\"This is a war. This is a crazy situation. It's insane and I'm losing my final little things,\" Chmerkovskiy went on. \"This is not a cry for help. I'm a big boy. I can handle myself... but I'm starting to not be able to just sort of keep my head.\"\n\nAfter thanking the people who are spreading awareness about the war and those who are providing resources for refugees, he added: \"The reality is, I just want to go home. I'm just hoping for a safe ending to it all.\"\n\nAmid Chmerkovskiy's journey to Poland, his wife Peta Murgatroyd, who is in the U.S., took to her Instagram Story and wrote in response: \"YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!! Get back home! I am s f****** proud of you for helping those kids on board!\n\nNew Zealand-born dancer Murgatroyd had asked her Instagram followers to pray for her husband in a February 24 post, as she admitted that she was finding the situation \"extremely hard.\"\n\n\"My pain is overwhelming and I'm struggling, but you sending your positive light and love to him would mean the world to me,\" she wrote. \"Truly, I wish for nothing more. Many of you are asking for details and I don't have the answers, but yes, he is safe right now.\n\n\"Please pray that he comes home soon. Please pray that he has a swift, safe exit. I have FAITH. I have HOPE and I have PRAYED so hard. Please pray for Ukraine and the innocent civilians [whose] lives are being greatly uprooted. I grew to love this country the couple of times I visited and they're in an unfathomable situation.\"\n\nIn a February 27 Instagram post, Murgatroyd admitted that she was \"going through hell right now and I want it all to end,\" as she also shared that strangers had given her fresh cookies they had baked in light of her husband being in Ukraine.\n\n\"Thank to you EVERYONE who has reached out, whether it be by text/calls/DM's/email/comments/street/post office,\" she said. [People] I haven't spoken to in 15 years have found me on social just to pray for me. It's beyond and it means the world to me.\"\n\nResponding to her post, Chmerkovskiy, who shares five-year-old son Shai with Murgatroyd, commented: \"I love you and I'll see you soon! Save me a cookie.\""
