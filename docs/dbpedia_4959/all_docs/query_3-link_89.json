        "text": "Dancing With the Stars’ Peta Murgatroyd and Maks Chmerkovskiy are officially a family of five! The couple welcomed their third son, Milan Maksim Chmerkovskiy, on July 12.\n\nChmerkovskiy announced the news on Instagram, sharing a photo of himself and Murgatroyd holding the baby boy in the hospital. “He is officially evicted from his mom and he is sooooo cute!!!!” the So You Think You Can Dance judge wrote in the caption. “Birth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push.” He added: “Also thank you all for the beautiful messages we have been receiving. Means a lot and very much appreciated.”\n\nSeveral Dancing With the Stars pros commented on the post and offered their congratulations. “THREE PEATTTTTT 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵,” Koko Iwasaki wrote. “Ahhhhhh!!!!! 🩵🍾 finally he’s here! I love you guys so much x,” former pro Sharna Burgess added. Emma Slater chimed in and wrote: “Yay!!!! Congratulations you guys so thrilled!! ❤️.” Chmerkovskiy’s sister-in-law, Jenna Johnson, also commented on the post, leaving three blue heart emojis.\n\nMore: Meet the Dancing With the Stars Pros’ Partners in Real Life\n\nChmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd, who have been married since 2017, are already parents to sons Shai, 7, and Rio, 1. Murgatroyd found out she was pregnant for the third time just four months after she had given birth to Rio. “We Are Having A Baby 🎉🙈🙏🏻Yes we know…we just had a baby… haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!” Murgatroyd wrote on Instagram.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the couple revealed that they would be welcoming another boy to their growing “wolf pack.” Murgatroyd shared a video set to The Supreme’s “Baby Love,” which showed Shai sitting behind a white cake with a fondant sign that read “We’re here for the sex!” The video then cut to several clips of the entire Chmerkovskiy-Murgatroyd clan, including the dancers’ parents, participating in a maternity shoot.\n\nAfter taking photos with giant blue and pink balloons, the family headed outside and watched as Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd released confetti poppers into the sky. Blue confetti exploded from them, signaling that the couple were having another boy. They kissed and embraced, as Shai ran around the yard holding blue balloons.\n\n“It’s a …….BOY! 🩵🩵🩵 I’ve been quietly preparing myself to be a real-life wolf pack Mumma with our THIRD baby boy on the way 🙏🏻🤣💙,” Murgatroyd captioned the post. She continued: “I CANNOT BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE 3 BOYS!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Maks and I are beyond happy to have another buddy for Shai and Rio…we want them to be the best of friends and thinking about family dinners already makes us laugh! Not to mention when Rio turns 1 , I will give birth to this bundle of joy a couple of weeks later 💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼 LET THE GAMES BEGIN ….”"
