        "text": "After narrowly escaping the country himself a little less than three weeks ago, Dancing With the Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy has returned to Poland to help his fellow Ukrainian refugees.\n\nThe dancer posted a lengthy video to his Instagram account on Sunday from Warsaw, revealing that after spending a few weeks at home with his wife Peta Murgatroyd and their son, he began to experience “survivor's remorse” after having made it out of the war-torn country unscathed. “I enjoyed some of that Los Angeles weather, saw my family, saw my friends, you know, obviously, spent some time, and we’ve been working on tangible opportunities to help,” he explained. Chmerkovskiy and his family have also started a new charitable initiative called Baranova 27, named after the street he grew up on in Odessa, Ukraine. The organization has been collecting clothing, medical supplies, and hygienic equipment donations to ship to refugees, as well as fundraising via their GoFundMe page. Chmerkovskiy promised to keep his supporters updated on Instagram about how all of those donations and funds are being distributed amongst refugees.\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars coach added that he wants to continue to find new ways to use his voice to speak out against the war Russia is currently waging against Ukraine. He pointed out that since he left, “It didn’t end or slow down; it got worse in Ukraine. I want everybody to understand what that means because everything happened fast, and it was traumatic and worldwide. But right now it's getting worse, the humanitarian crisis is getting worse, people are getting hurt worse, there are more people hurt, and there are more people affected.” He also said that he plans on visiting his friend Bethenny Frankel, who has set up a couple of refugee centers on the Ukrainian border through her charity BStrong, to see if he can be of service there.\n\nChmerkovskiy was filming a new World of Dance show in his home country when the war first broke out last month and he began documenting every part of his experience on social media, from the bombs going off in Kyiv to his decision to leave Ukraine after being arrested and his “traumatizing” journey to the border.\n\nWhen he first returned to America, Chmerkovskiy confessed to Good Morning America that he feels ashamed over how privileged he was to be able to flee Ukraine so quickly. “I feel guilty. I feel bad. I feel shamed. I feel upset,” he explained. He later added in an interview with CNN, “I felt really bad going. When I got to the train station, I realized it was all women and children, and then I’m literally too big and I’m taking up space. I spent a couple of the last days with survivor’s remorse, I believe that’s what it’s called, and currently working on an opportunity to go back, so hopefully sometime next week I’ll go back to Poland and join efforts on the ground, and sort of justify my safe out that way.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
