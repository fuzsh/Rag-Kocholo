        "text": "Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd's relationship goes back way before the ballroom.\n\nThe couple, known for their professional status on Dancing with the Stars, first met on Broadway in 2009. However, their relationship didn't turn romantic until 2012 — a year after they'd reunited on ABC's hit reality dance competition.\n\nFollowing a brief breakup, Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd tied the knot in July 2017 and have started a family. They welcomed their first child, son Shai Aleksander, in January 2017, their second son, Rio John, in June 2023 and their third son, Milan Maksim, in July 2024.\n\nFrom their time on Broadway together to starting a family, here's a breakdown of Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd's lengthy love story.\n\nJuly 2009: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd meet on Broadway\n\nPrior to stepping into the Dancing with the Stars spotlight, Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd both landed gigs in the Broadway production of Burn the Floor in 2009 — and interestingly, it wasn't love at first sight for the now-married couple.\n\n\"I thought he was arrogant,\" Murgatroyd told PEOPLE in a 2015 interview of meeting the Ukrainian dancer.\n\n\"Okay, that's a defense mechanism. I think she was in love with me at first sight and just doesn't want to admit it,\" Chmerkovskiy retorted. \"No, I walked in the way I walk in and … it's just a lot of presence.\"\n\n\"I learned to like him because I found out he wasn't that arrogant,\" admitted Murgatroyd. \"He was really generous to the entire cast, and our friendship grew and grew.\"\n\nMay 2011: Peta Murgatroyd joins Maks Chmerkovskiy on Dancing with the Stars\n\nWhile Chmerkovskiy joined DWTS as a pro dancer in 2006, Murgatroyd joined the DWTS cast in 2011. She started as a troupe dancer in season 12 and was then promoted to the professional cast the following season.\n\nMurgatroyd told PEOPLE in 2017, \"there was always an attraction\" between the two dancers, but because he was engaged to his fellow DWTS pro dancer Karina Smirnoff and she was dating her future DWTS costar Damian Whitewood at the time, \"there was nothing ever done about it.\"\n\nJune 16, 2012: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd go Instagram official\n\nBefore their relationship budded into something more, Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy built a solid friendship. When the two were both single in 2012, they began going on \"friendship dates,\" according to Murgatroyd.\n\nMurgatroyd made their relationship Instagram official that year as she posted a photo of her beau kissing her on the cheek.\n\nJan. 1, 2013: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd ring in the New Year together\n\nThe couple celebrated New Year's Eve together as they rang in 2013. Murgatroyd posted a photo alongside Chmerkovskiy and friends as they celebrated the occasion.\n\n\"Celebrating NYE with amazing people!\" she captioned the photo.\n\nNovember 2013: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd break up\n\nThings were going strong for the pair until, as Murgatroyd put it, \"out of nowhere,\" Chmerkovskiy called it quits after less than a year of dating.\n\n\"My heart was broken,\" Murgatroyd told PEOPLE in 2017. \"But when we were driving to the airport after the breakup talk, he literally asked me why I was taking all my bags and clothes back. I was like, 'We just broke up. Why would I leave anything behind?' That's when I knew it wasn't really over for forever.\"\n\n\"I realized right away that I'd made a mistake,\" said Chmerkovskiy. \"So I would take every opportunity to hover around.\"\n\nOctober 2014: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd get back together\n\nWhile Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd both dated other people during their brief time apart, the two rekindled their relationship in October 2014.\n\n\"They've never really 'broken up,' \" a DWTS source told PEOPLE in 2015 about the professional dancers. \"They're with each other a lot and have been for quite some time, including all last season. Tommy [Chong] would tease her about it.\"\n\nApril 22, 2015: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd publicly confirm they are back together\n\nThe couple appeared happier than ever when they posed for a selfie together in celebration of DWTS' 10th anniversary in 2015. Murgatroyd shared the picture on her Instagram featuring the two cheek to cheek with her arm wrapped around Chmerkovskiy.\n\nDec. 5, 2015: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd get engaged\n\nChmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd got engaged during an episode of DWTS on Dec. 5, 2015.\n\nNaturally, the proposal happened on the dance floor during a performance of Sway at the Olympia Theater in Miami, in front of a joyous audience and a line of other dancers.\n\nChmerkovskiy told her, \"I'm in love with you, and I will be in love with you for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"She said 'yes,' \" he wrote in another Instagram post later that night.\n\nJan. 4, 2017: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd welcome their first baby\n\nAfter months of posting beautiful maternity pictures to her Instagram and documenting her pregnancy journey, Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy welcomed son Shai Aleksander on Jan. 4, 2017.\n\n\"This is, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to us!\" the couple said of their firstborn in a statement at the time.\n\nJuly 8, 2017: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd get married\n\nPrior to lavishly celebrating their wedding with family and friends, Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy secretly tied the knot during a small city hall ceremony in New York City on July 8, 2017. It wasn't until the couple was celebrating their one-year wedding anniversary that the Ukrainian dancer revealed their little secret on Instagram.\n\n\"This was one of the most exciting days of my life!\" the DWTS pro wrote alongside two videos documenting the intimate ceremony. \"Everything felt very festive, I couldn't take my eyes off my future wife the whole ride to the City Hall and it was as if New York City herself was marrying us.\"\n\nJuly 8, 2017: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd have a wedding ceremony\n\nOn July 8, the dancing duo tied the knot (again) at Oheka Castle in Long Island, New York.\n\n\"Maks has loved this place for years and I took on the suggestion and I fell in love with it immediately,\" Murgatroyd told PEOPLE in May of choosing Oheka Castle.\n\nMurgatroyd walked down the aisle on the arm of her father in a fairytale ball gown with an off-the-shoulder fitted bodice and multi-tiered, full gathered skirt.\n\nChmerkovskiy's brother and fellow DWTS pro, Val Chmerkovskiy, served as best man.

This will always be home now,\" she added.\n\nJuly 8, 2020: Maks Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd celebrate their wedding anniversary\n\nIn honor of their seventh dating anniversary, Murgatroyd posted a beautiful tribute to remember the day.\n\n\"It's been over 7 years and I'm still head over heels for you @maksimc ✨ Happy Anniversary my love,\" she captioned a series of wedding photos.\n\nChmerkovskiy displayed his love for his wife as well by posting romantic note cards he penned to Murgatroyd. The carousel ended with a toast shared between the loved-up couple.\n\nJan. 2, 2021: Peta Murgatroyd shares her appreciation for Maks Chmerkovskiy\n\nAt the start of 2021, Murgatroyd took the time to write a heartfelt note to Chmerkovskiy in a \"husband appreciation post\" on Instagram.\n\n\"My love...may we always be able to work through every challenge that's given to us,\" she wrote. \"I love how we communicate and convey our feelings, connect when we feel a disconnect, instinctually know when each other is upset and reason with each other and come out more in love on the other side.\"\n\nShe added, \"I woke up more obsessed with you than last year and for that I'm grateful 🤗 May we continue to put each other first and continue to grow and learn from one another.

It felt final, it felt like this was it,\" she said. \"I got a little preview of them at the earliest stage of their life. It felt otherworldly special, I felt privileged. I really did think this was going to work.\"\n\nShe concluded the post with, \"I will get my baby, just not right now,\" adding, \"And to all the women who have gone through this multiple times over, I bow down.
