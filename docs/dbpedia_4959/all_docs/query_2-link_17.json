        "text": "DANCING with the Stars alum Maksim Chmerkovskiy was caught in the mayhem in Ukraine.\n\nThe professional dancer is a Ukrainian-American who grew up studying dance in both countries.\n\nWhere is Maksim Chmerkovskiy from?\n\nMaksim was born in Odessa, Ukraine.\n\nMaksim immigrated from Ukraine to the United States with his family in the 1990s.\n\nThe family moved from Ukraine to New York City when Maksim was 14 years old.\n\nMaksim studied dance as a young child in his home country and pursued it as a way to make money in New York City.\n\nThe Ukrainian-American dancer told the Morning Call in an interview that he believed winning competitions would lead to more money at the small performances he held at a Russian restaurant.\n\n\"I figured in my 15-year-old mind that if I win a trophy, then I can come back and say, 'Look, I'm better now then I was before,' and then I can get a bump to $30 a show,\" Maksim said.\n\n\"That's how I got more seriously into competing,\" he continued.\n\nIs Maksim Chmerkovskiy a US citizen?\n\nMaksim has dual citizenship in America and Ukraine.\n\nHe acknowledged in an Instagram post that he is thankful to have an American passport.\n\nMaksim is married to Peta Murgatroyd and they have one daughter named Shai.\n\nWhy was Maksim Chmerkovskiy in Ukraine?\n\nAccording to Maksim's representative, the dancer was in his home country working on the reality competition series, World of Dance UA.\n\nThis is a renowned dance competition that features dance crews from around the world.\n\nMaksim is still a pro dancer who appears on Dancing with the Stars.\n\nHe announced on his Instagram on Monday, February 28 that he was on a train from Ukraine to Poland. He has since arrived in Poland."
