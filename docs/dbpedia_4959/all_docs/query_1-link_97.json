        "text": "Peta Murgatroyd and Maks Chmerkovskiy are now proud parents of three, with the couple chronicling the exciting news on Instagram, sharing every detail with fans along the way.\n\nThe Dancing with the Stars pros first announced they were expecting baby number three back in February, seven months after welcoming their son Rio in June 2023. On July 12, Murgatroyd shared the sweetest shot of Chmerkovskiy planting a smooch on her from her hospital bed, captioning the post, “Here we go again….again! Wish us luck! #number3cominginhot #madeinPeta.”\n\nJust hours later, the Australian native shared a smiley selfie with her husband and their brand new baby boy, giving fans some updates about their newest addition. “He is officially evicted from his mom and he is sooooo cute!!!!” she wrote. “Birth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push!” She concluded by thanking fans for “all the beautiful messages,” adding, “Means a lot and very much appreciated. #madeinPeta #threepeat.”\n\nLater on, the couple shared a close-up shot of their adorable little one, including his name and other birth details. “Milan Maksim Chmerkovskiy,” she wrote. “Born 8.48am 〰️ 7/12/24 〰️ 8 pounds. The fam is complete.”\n\nIn yet another follow-up post, the couple shared a video of themselves doing a pre-baby dance, proving that little Milan was ready to Electric Slide right into this world. “We filmed this in the morning and he was probably sick and tired of being thrown around in my belly haha,” Murgatroyd joked.\n\nJust two days after welcoming baby Milan, Murgatroyd rang in her 38th birthday, sharing a hilarious clip of herself cradling him in the hospital, sneezing with gushing water sounds that anyone who has ever given birth will instantly relate to. “Happy Birthday to Meeeeeeeeee …and I wouldn’t have it any other way!!” she captioned the sweet and silly post.\n\nAlong with Milan and Rio, the couple are also parents to son Shai, 7. Congratulations to the family on their adorable new addition—we have a feeling there will be lots of happy dances for years to come in the Murgatroyd-Chmerkovskiy household."
