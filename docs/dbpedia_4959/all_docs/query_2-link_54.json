        "text": "Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy are the latest celebrity parents in town and have done it in record time!\n\nAccording to the announcement on their Instagram page, the couple's new bundle of joy has arrived safely and quite swiftly, and the baby and family look healthy.\n\nPeta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who welcomed their second baby last year, have kept the world in the loop about the possibility of a third, and now it is here.\n\nIt Is Son Number 3 For Peta Murgatroyd & Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nThe pair welcomed the new addition to their beautiful family about hours ago, and the proud parents shared the joyful news on their Instagram with a picture of the newborn wrapped in a shawl. The post's caption partly read:\n\nThey went on to appreciate their fans, friends, and family for their \"beautiful messages\" and well wishes.\n\nIt is not hard to believe the \"47-seconds\" claim because just a little over 6 hours ago, Chmerkovskiy gave a quick update about their situation and shared a picture of his wife ready for labor on the hospital bed.\n\n\"Here we go again….again! Wish us luck,\" he wrote. Fans quickly gathered in the comment sections, sending words of encouragement and prayers to the couple.\n\nFans Go Wild Over Murgatroyd's '47 Seconds' Labor\n\nThe birth announcement picture has gained over 100k likes, with fans commending the new mom for her impressive feat as this user wrote, \"One push????? Girl you just sneezed him out lol,\" while another declared, \"Ok seriously…who looks that gorgeous after giving birth? Peta… that's who!\"\n\nThe streets of Instagram certainly can not get enough of the dancer's post-labor glow as this user declared: \"That woman is stunning even after giving birth to her 3rd baby (the second in just over a year). She is a gorgeous warrior! CONGRATULATIONS!!.\"\n\n\"That's so fantastic! Makes me cry and so happy for Peta. Congrats to you both!!!\" wrote another well-wisher, as one more user declared that the new mom deserved a shirt made in her honor for pushing out a baby in less than 1 minute.\n\nWe can't help but agree with this fan, who wrote, \"That little chaos warrior. Took his sweet time getting ready, and then ran out as if his feet were on fire.\" This user also encouraged the baby daddy to get that new mama an extra push gift for acing the delivery.\n\nDid Peta Murgatroyd Have It On Her Bingo Card The Whole Time?\n\nThe pro dancer was definitely prepared for the birth of her third child and did not hold back on that fact after she welcomed her second baby last June amid infertility struggles.\n\nMurgatroyd disclosed this when she hopped on an Instagram Q&A session. A fan asked if she was willing to try for another baby, which she answered in the affirmative, adding:\n\nThe Blast shared that the couple tried to conceive naturally for two years but had three miscarriages and a failed IVF process despite thinking IVF was going to do the trick. Luck, however smiled on them a month after they stopped IVF, and she got pregnant naturally.\n\nThe 37-year-old definitely has a thing for a big family. Back in 2022, she and her husband joked about having a baby, and a few months later, they showed up in the labor room ready to welcome their little one.\n\nThe Power Couple Celebrated Six Years As Life Partners Last Year\n\nMurgatroyd and her husband took time out of their baby-planning scheme last year to reassure each other of their undying love as they marked their six-year wedding anniversary in grand style.\n\nChmerkovskiy led the pack by sharing a heartwarming image of them on their wedding day, in which he held his bride's face delicately and wrote that marrying her was the best decision he had made and that he would do it again.\n\nHis wife also shared his sentiments by posting a portrait of them on their big day. She described her husband as her best friend on planet Earth and reiterated that her love for him is infinite.\n\nA Diamond Push Gift\n\nThe dancer received a very lavish gift after the arrival of baby number 2. Chmerkovskiy explained in an Instagram video that he wanted to make his wife's push present very special, and he got her a customized ring from Jamesallen.com.\n\nThe Blast reported that at the time, the doting dad thanked his wife for being a great mom as he wore the ring on his excited wife's finger, who disclosed that she had received two diamond rings from him so far.\n\nWhen he is not spoiling his wife silly, the ballroom dancer is an amazing dad to his two kids, and he shares pictures regularly as proof of our claim.\n\nWe are so excited for the couple on their new little one and cannot wait to see Murgatroyd's new push present in the coming days!"
