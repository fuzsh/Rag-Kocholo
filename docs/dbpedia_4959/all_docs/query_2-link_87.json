        "text": "By Movieguide¬Æ Contributor\n\nDANCING WITH THE STARS pros Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy are expecting Baby No. 3!\n\n‚ÄúWe Are Having A Baby!‚Äù the couple wrote in a joint post on Instagram. ‚ÄúYes we know‚Ä¶we just had a baby‚Ä¶ haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!‚Äù\n\nThe post featured a video of Murgatroyd FaceTiming her husband to tell him the news, saying, ‚ÄúHe is not going to know what hit him!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSurpising @maksimc on this FaceTime with my two friends secretly filming from different angles made it all the more hilarious,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúIt took one hour for me to get the courage to call him üòÇ and when he wasn‚Äôt catching on we all couldn‚Äôt stop laughing in the kitchen. I had the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sick story‚Äô the pickle and 2 bottles HAHA! Oh Maks.‚Äù\n\nThe post continued, ‚ÄúAfter everything we‚Äôve been through with miscarriages and IVF we‚Äôre beyond blessed and know we are uber lucky for this miracle to happen to us. We‚Äôre just so happy that we can finally tell you guys the good news.‚Äù\n\nThe couple are also parents to Rio, 7 months, and Shai, 7, and have been open about their fertility struggles.\n\nMurgatroyd experienced three miscarriages, which she called ‚Äúsomething that will probably live with me for the rest of my life, being on that toilet by myself, knowing what was happening and not being able to stop it.‚Äù\n\nShe started undergoing IVF treatments, but, to the couple‚Äôs surprise, she naturally conceived in 2023 with Rio.\n\n‚ÄúAll natural, it happened,‚Äù she told PEOPLE. ‚ÄúI think it was the fastest positive I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. It just came up super quick and I was just shocked.‚Äù\n\nMovieguide¬Æ previously reported on Rio‚Äôs birth:\n\nDANCING WITH THE STARS pros Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy have just welcomed Baby No. 2!\n\nMurgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy have been married since 2017. They welcomed son Shai that same year.\n\nThe couple have kept most details about their second child‚Äôs birth under wraps, but Chmerkovskiy shared a photo of himself and the newborn in honor of his first Father‚Äôs Day as a dad of two.\n\n‚ÄúHappy Father‚Äôs Day to me!,‚Äù the DWTS pro wrote. ‚Äú#MadeInPeta.‚Äù"
