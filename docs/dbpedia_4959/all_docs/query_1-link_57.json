        "text": "Ukrainian-American dancer\n\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is Aleksandrovich and the family name is Chmerkovskiy.\n\nValentin Aleksandrovich \"Val\" Chmerkovskiy (Ukrainian: Валентин Олександрович \"Вал\" Чмерковський; born March 24, 1986)[2] is a Ukrainian-American professional dancer, best known for his appearances on the U.S. version of Dancing with the Stars, which he won three times. Chmerkovskiy is a two-time World Latin Dance Champion (Junior and Youth) and a 14-time U.S. National Latin Dance champion.\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nChmerkovskiy was born in the Ukrainian city of Odesa, in what was then the Soviet Union.[2] His parents are Aleksandr \"Sasha\" Chmerkovskiy and Larisa Chmerkovskaya.[3] His older brother, Maksim Chmerkovskiy (born 1980), is also a professional dancer who appears on Dancing with the Stars.[4] His father is Jewish, and his mother is Christian.[5][6]\n\nThe family moved to the United States in 1994. In 1996, Maksim and Sasha opened a youth-oriented dance studio in New Jersey, and Valentin was one of the students. In 2001, Valentin and partner Diana Olonetskaya, 15, became the first American dance team to win a world junior championship title.[7]\n\nChmerkovskiy is a co-owner of nine social dance studios under the brand \"Dance With Me\".[8] Six are in the New York metropolitan area (Glen Rock and Fort Lee in New Jersey; Glen Cove, Long Island; SoHo, Manhattan; Midtown Manhattan; and Stamford, Connecticut). The three other studios are located in Southlake, Texas, The Woodlands, Texas, and Summerlin, Nevada. Previously one was in Sherman Oaks, California, but has since changed ownership.[3][9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Chmerkovskiy began an on and off relationship with fellow DWTS dancer Jenna Johnson.

The students were: Valentin & Valeriya Kozharinova, Sergei Onik & Michelle Glazarov and Boris Leokumovich & Nicole Volynets.
