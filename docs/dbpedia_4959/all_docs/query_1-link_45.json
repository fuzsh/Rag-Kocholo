On July 12, Peta, 37, and Maks, 44, announced the birth of their new addition, Milan Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who joins their older sons Shai, 7, and Rio, 12 months.\n\n\"He is officially evicted from his mom and he is sooooo cute!!!!\" Peta and Maks wrote in a joint Instagram post, alongside a photo of the three in a hospital room. \"Birth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push!\"\n\nPeta, who had battled infertility and pregnancy losses in the past, announced in February that she was expecting again and that her pregnancy was a surprise.\n\n\"We Are Having A Baby,\" the two-time Mirrorball trophy winner wrote on Instagram at the time. \"Yes we know…we just had a baby… haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!\""
