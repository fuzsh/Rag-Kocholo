        "text": "By Pretty Honore\n\nPublished Jan. 20 2023, 3:43 p.m. ET\n\nThough he is most known for his choreography on ABC's hit reality dance competition series Dancing With the Stars, Maksim Chmerkovskiy has turned his attention to focus on worldwide issues.\n\nFans initially fell in love with Maks during his nearly two-decade run on DWTS, before he announced his exit from the show. During those formative years, he met his now-wife, professional dancer Peta Murgatroyd, and took home a Mirrorball trophy alongside Olympic ice dancer Meryl Davis.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nYears after leaving the show, fans are curious to know what the professional dancer has been up to. In an exclusive interview with Distractify, he’s taken his talents from the dancefloor to the frontlines of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Read on to learn more!\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhere is Maksim Chmerkovskiy now?\n\nBetween the birth of his nephew and the news that his wife is expecting baby number two, Maks has a lot to look forward to. However, amid the happy times in his life, Maks's home country of Ukraine is under attack by Russian forces.\n\nIn 2022, he was in Ukraine to witness the travesty firsthand. Maks was in the nation’s capital filming for World of Dance when Russian troops entered the country. He shocked fans with an Instagram video where he extended a passionate plea on behalf of the Ukrainian people.\n\nSince posting the now-viral Instagram video, Maks has returned to the U.S. Still, Maks has been persistent in his efforts to lend his support and voice. “Maybe up until like, three [or] four years ago, all I watched was cartoons,” Maks told us. “People don't know [this] about me — I despise violence. I hate bullying.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIn the past, the pro dancer was content with living an off-the-grid lifestyle. Though, after Ukraine’s invasion, he found it increasingly difficult to bite his tongue. “I understand the fundamentals of this war,” he explained.\n\n“For everybody who's trying to talk me out of trying to help Ukraine because apparently, it’s just the way things are,” the DWTS pro continued. “Well, maybe that history needs to stop happening and repeating itself.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe dust hasn’t settled in Ukraine, but the media coverage about what’s happening there certainly has. In partnership with Unify Ukraine, Maks and his longtime friend Bethenny Frankel hope to change that this January.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMaks Chmerkovskiy talks Ukraine’s Day of Unity: “All the headlines have faded.”\n\nUkraine’s Day of Unity will take place on Sunday, Jan. 22, but Maks is spreading awareness all week.\n\nFrom Thursday, Jan. 19 until Sunday, Jan. 22, the Flatiron Plaza in Manhattan, N.Y., is set to host a massive installation featuring 335 sunflowers — one for each day that Russia has occupied Ukraine.\n\n“Sunflowers — Ukrainian’s national flower — represent peace, love, prosperity, all the beautiful things,\" Maks said.\n\nMaks also shared how non-New Yorkers can pay tribute to the thousands of lives that have been impacted as a result of recent events. In his interview with Distractify, He asked social media users to post a single sunflower on their Instagram feed on Sunday with the hashtag #UnifyUkraine.\n\n“All the headlines have faded,” he said, adding that he hopes that the mass humanitarian effort will put Ukraine “back at the forefront.”\n\nCheck out UnifyUkraineCampaign.org to learn more and get your own sunflower meme."
