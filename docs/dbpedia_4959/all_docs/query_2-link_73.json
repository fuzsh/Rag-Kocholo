        "text": "To fans worldwide, Maksim Chmerkovskiy is a Latin-ballroom dance champion, choreographer and instructor who competed to fame on 17 seasons of \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nIn New Jersey, he is known as the founder of Dance With Me Studio in Fort Lee, and as a former resident of Fort Lee and Garfield.\n\nBut before all of that, Chmerkovskiy was a native of Odessa, Ukraine, where he lived with his parents and younger brother Valentin. When Maksim was 14, the family moved to Brooklyn, and in 2019, he became a citizen of both the US and Ukraine.\n\nChmerkovskiy was in his homeland on February 24 to judge the Ukrainian version of \"World of Dance\" when Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion and military airstrikes of the country. The \"DWTS\" alum says he was arrested on the street and let go before setting out on a harrowing escape from the capital city of Kyiv. In a series of Instagram videos, Chmerkovskiy records each leg of his journey.\n\nA post from Kyiv describes how his arrest was a \"reality check,\" and he is going to try to make his way out, though a friend has been on a bus from Lviv to the Polish border for two days; in every direction, he says, she saw volunteers feeding civilians. He asks viewers not to panic if he \"disappears for a little bit.\"\n\nLocal: New Jersey restaurants rally around Ukraine by boycotting Russian vodka, donating\n\nIn another, he walks and talks as the train from Kyiv is halted 30 minutes from the Polish border to \"change wheels.\" He says there are five cars on the train with about 130 people in each.\n\nThe trip from Kyiv to Warsaw took 23 hours, he says in a heartbreaking, nearly half-hour message Instagram video recorded in Poland, in which he thanks friends who helped him along the way, and, sleep-deprived and shaken, relays his thoughts on the situation in Ukraine.\n\nAfter mentioning that he took a video of a rocket incinerating a family of four, he says, \"I feel like I'm in Brooklyn in a high school hallway watching a little kid get beat up by a big kid, and all of us are passing by and think it's wrong, but we can't jump in... We're terrified of this big kid. So we stand and we watch and see the little kid get a bloody nose and black eye, and get punched repeatedly. And then something happens, and the little kid does something and the big kid falls down. Or we see there's a change, and everyone joins in. When you feel ready, you have to join in.\"\n\nUkraine war: New Jersey officials react to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nAt the end of that video, Chmerkovskiy shares the feeling that he was \"adopted\" by the United States, but that when he returned to Ukraine, he reconnected with his country and fell in love with his \"birth parents.\"\n\n\"I never fell out of love with the U.S.,\" he says. Describing how different factions in America are at odds with each other, he says that his message is, \"We fight, but we'll defend ourselves just like Ukraine.\"\n\nChmerkovskiy returned to his adoptive country on March 2, landing in LAX Airport to an emotional reunion with his wife, Peta Murgatroyd, whom he met on \"DWTS\" in 2012. They have a 5-year-old son, Shai, and live in Los Angeles.\n\nNorth Jersey Media Group has covered Chmerkoskiy numerous times, as the dancer-choreographer's career evolved and he made big local news. In its December 2011 issue, (201) Magazine reported how he opened his first studio, Rising Stars Dance Academy, in Ridgewood at age 16. The studio moved to a few different locations before landing in Saddle Brook.\n\nIn a June 2013 update, (201) told readers about Dance with Me Studio opening in Ridgefield. Now in Fort Lee, Dance with Me also has locations in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, New York and Texas). Chmerkovskiy said of Fort Lee, \"It's like the sixth borough of New York, but it still has a real New Jersey flair.\"\n\nRead next: For many in NJ, watching bombs drop on Kyiv stirs feelings of dread for Taiwan\n\nCindy Schweich Handler is the editor of Montclair and Wayne Magazines, and a writer for The Record and Northjersey.com who frequently covers health issues.
