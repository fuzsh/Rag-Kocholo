        "text": "Peta Murgatroyd is officially a boy mom times three!\n\nShe and fellow Dancing With the Stars alum Maksim Chmerkovskiy welcomed their third son, the couple confirmed on Friday, July 12. The newborn baby boy joins older brothers Shai, 7, and Rio, 1.\n\n\"He is officially evicted from his mom and he is sooooo cute!!!!,\" the couple shared on Instagram. \"Birth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push! Also thank you all for the beautiful messages we have been receiving. Means a lot and very much appreciated.\"\n\nMere hours before the couple's third son arrived, ET spoke with Chmerkovskiy at the 2024 ESPY Awards, where he said he was \"on call.\"\n\nHe explained they established a system that if Murgatroyd called him twice in a row, he would leave the ceremony and call her from the car because that meant she was in labor. Early Friday, the couple posted a photo on Instagram of them in the hospital, confirming their baby was on his way.\n\n\"Here we go again‚Ä¶.again! Wish us luck ü§ûüèº,\" the photo was captioned. \"#number3cominginhot #madeinPeta.\"\n\nIn February, the couple -- who rose to fame as pro ballroom dancers on the hit ABC competition series -- announced the news that they were expecting again, less than eight months after the birth of Rio.\n\n\"We Are Having A Baby üéâüôàüôèüèª,\" the new mom of three captioned her pregnancy announcement video on Instagram. \"Yes we know‚Ä¶we just had a baby‚Ä¶ haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!\"\n\nShe concluded her post, \"After everything we‚Äôve been through with miscarriages and IVF we‚Äôre beyond blessed and know we are uber lucky for this miracle to happen to us. We‚Äôre just so happy that we can finally tell you guys the good news.\"\n\nSpeaking with ET, the 44-year-old dad of three and So You Think You Can Dance judge recognized his family as a great accomplishment at this stage of his life. \"You transition and you change as a person, and when that change happens, you get upset and depressed about missing things in life. And for me, I think... there are some things that you have to go through to feel accomplished,\" he explained. \"For me, it's not the Dancing With the Stars trophies. It's not dance trophies in general. It's the fact that I got a wife and kids and a house and I have a puppy that I miss, you know, and the time that we get to spend together is my time, period.\"\n\nAs he told ET on the red carpet Thursday, \"I had a period of time when I was young and single. Now I have a period of time when it's Peta and I just multiplying. Peta and I never really had our own time, you know. We kind of ran right at it, but we're not upset. Our life is incredible and we feel like this is now the work.\""
