        "text": "They carried 129 overstuffed duffel bags.\n\nEach came packed with 70 pounds of diapers, socks, medicine – and a lot of love from North Jersey to Ukraine.\n\nWhen a group of Bergen County volunteers dragged the donations into Newark Liberty Airport in March and explained they were on a goodwill mission to the Ukrainian border, the befuddled ticket agent blinked back tears.\n\nNeedless to say, they didn't have to pay baggage fees, said Rabbi David-Seth Kirshner of Temple Emanu-El in Closter, who accompanied the relief mission along with 10 other people. Along with Kirshner's synagogue, the group represented the Tenafly-based Kaplen JCC on the Palisades, Congregation Ahavath Torah of Englewood and the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey, based in Paramus.\n\nMembers of the delegation returned from the Polish border overwhelmed by the suffering they witnessed as a result of Russia's invasion – but also moved by the charity of myriad volunteers from around the globe.\n\n\"At a border crossing in Medyka, we saw what seemed like a mini-United Nations,\" Kirshner said. \"There was an Israel flag and station with a field hospital, free food offered by the Sikh community food truck, an Egyptian triage tent and Italian paramedics.\"\n\n\"Putin created the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II but he also galvanized the greatest international response and collective humanitarian effort in modern history – the bitter and the sweet,\" the rabbi added, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that almost 4 million people, mainly women, children and the elderly, have fled war-torn Ukraine. It is believed to be the largest forced migration in Europe since the Second World War. More than half of all Ukrainian children are now displaced, the UN says.\n\nMany refugees have gone to border countries like Poland and Moldova, and space and medical supplies have become increasingly scarce.\n\nThat's inspired people around the world, including several recent missions from New Jersey, to travel to the edge of the warzone to deliver the aid.\n\nAleksandr “Sasha” Chmerkovskiy, the father of \"Dancing with the Stars\" pros Maksim and Valentin Chmerkovskiy, launched a massive donation effort in March from Fort Lee. The campaign gathered more than 130,000 pounds of medical, hygiene and baby supplies to the border.\n\nMaksim said on Instagram that through personal connections, he's arranging for the donations to be delivered to major cities and distributed. \"People are getting tired but nothing has ended or slowed down,\" he said on social media. \"The humanitarian crisis is getting worse. More people are getting hurt and affected.\"\n\nRelief hub: How is aid getting to Ukrainians? Sometimes it starts at Clifton shipping office\n\nHow to help: Here's how you can aid Ukraine from New Jersey and which groups to support\n\nTrip inspires Jersey Shore concert\n\nIn early March, Point Pleasant Beach Mayor Paul Kanitra traveled to Poland, with suitcases full of local donations. When that was depleted, Kanitra spent thousands of dollars to buy and distribute local supplies.\n\nThe mayor, who comes from Polish and Slovakian heritage, said he was inspired to make the journey because of the numerous summer workers from the Ukraine region who work at the Jersey Shore and are like family to his community.\n\nKanitra estimates he helped more than 1,000 people on the trip. After returning home, he felt it still wasn't enough.\n\nMore than anything, he said, the evacuees need money to buy clothes, medicine and other essentials. He got in touch with friends with contacts in the music industry and an idea was born.\n\nKanitra has organized a charity concert called \"Point Beach Cares: Concert for Ukraine\" with a lineup of bands planned for April 10. He aims to raise about $250,000 for groups active at the border including World Central Kitchen, Polish Red Cross and Caritas Poland. \"We saw them everywhere during our trip,\" he said, adding that it's important to donate to reputable groups.\n\nMore: Bon Jovi song inspires Ukrainians defending Odessa: 'For the ones who stood their ground'\n\nJenkinson's Boardwalk in Point Pleasant will host the event for free, and it's already signed up several corporate sponsors, the mayor said.\n\n\"It feels good to see our community embrace this and give of themselves,\" Kanitra said. \"Every day people are calling and asking how they can help.\"\n\nTickets are available at www.axs.com/events/429254/point-beach-cares-concert-for-ukraine-tickets.

In our broken Russian and their broken English, we exchanged names and smiles and let them know we are praying for them,\" said Kirshner.\n\nPoland is bursting at the seams, said Steve Rogers, CEO of the Kaplen JCC. \"Hotels are packed and there are tent cities everywhere. The mayor of Krakow said he doesn't know where he can put more refugees at this point.\"\n\nThe group crossed the border into Ukraine and visited a hospital treating people wounded during the invasion. Kirshner likened the hospital to something from the \"Cold War,\" with aging equipment and crumbling facilities. Tourniquets were running out. The medicines that the group brought were put to immediate use, he said.\n\nIn Warsaw, 'heartwarming' charity\n\nJason Shames, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey, went on another humanitarian mission to the Polish border with 20 volunteers from around the U.S. It was a particularly emotional journey, Shames said, because his own grandmother had escaped from Warsaw at the start of World War II. He grew up thinking the Polish capital was an awful place.\n\n\"In 1939 she ran for her life, leaving a family of 12 behind in the middle of the night, and she never saw them again,\" Shames said by telephone from his hotel room in Warsaw. \"To be back here, watching refugees cross the border into Warsaw to find support, love and care is so heartwarming.\"\n\nShames' organization has raised more than $700,000 from Northern New Jersey donors for Ukrainian relief. \"They need money to pay for rent, food, medical supplies, diapers, personal hygiene products and much more,\" he said. \"The needs change daily with the constant movement of people leaving Ukraine.\"\n\nBombs, bandits and a frozen border: NJ native recounts harrowing escape from invasion\n\n“This visit cut right to my core,\" Shames said. \"Seeing the desperation in the faces of so many women and children of all ages was gut-wrenching.\"\n\nRefugees need help with mental and physical health, social welfare and food. Many need help deciding where to live, he said. He called the trip galvanizing.\n\n\"There is the best of humanity that comes out, watching everyone take care of these refugees as if they were their own families.\"\n\nTeaneck student bonds in Vienna\n\nNearly 30 students from Yeshiva University in New York returned from a humanitarian mission from the region last week. The students, who had raised more than $100,000 to support Jewish refugee families in Vienna. They brought food and money and provided programming for the children.\n\nAmong the volunteers was Rachel Piontnica of Teaneck, a junior majoring in biology. \"I spoke with so many individuals who left their homes, families and belongings,\" she said. \"I never imagined I would ever see something like this in my lifetime.\"\n\nAmong the highlights was a party to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim with the refugees, as well as time spent with Ukrainian children at a local hotel. Piontnica recalled Alice, a young girl who enjoyed coloring.\n\n\"We drew pictures together,\" she said. \"Her signature on all of her pictures was 'I heart U.' It was her way to show her appreciation. When we gave her lunch, she kept giggling and offering us her food. Seeing her smiling and being so appreciative during such a difficult time for her family was really moving for me.\"\n\nDeena Yellin covers religion for NorthJersey.com.
