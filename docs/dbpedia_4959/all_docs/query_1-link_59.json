        "text": "Professional dancers Peta Murgatroyd and Maks Chmerkovskiy have added another bundle of joy to their family! The Dancing with the Stars pros have announced the birth of their third baby. “Mom and baby are doing perfect.”\n\nMaks shared a quick post following the birth of the couple’s third baby, which came just a few hours after they revealed Peta was getting ready to give birth. The couple welcomed a baby boy, news they revealed in March. “He is officially evicted from his mom and he is sooooo cute!!!!,” Maks began in the caption. He went on to give a bit of insight into Peta’s birth sharing, “Birth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push!” Earlier in the day, the couple shared a post after arriving at the hospital, writing on Instagram, “Here we go again….again! Wish us luck.”\n\nIn a follow up post, Peta shared the first image of her baby and revealed his name: Milan Maksim Chmerkovskiy. Milan arrived on July 12th at 8:48 AM and weighed 8 lbs at birth. At the end of her post, the dancer shared, “The fam is complete 🥹,” signifying that Milan is likely the couple’s last baby. The couple announced in February that they were pregnant again. The news came 7 months after they welcomed their son Rio John in June 2023. Peta shared that shelearned she was pregnant 4 months post-partum. The DWTS pros also have a 7-year-old son named Shai Aleksander.\n\nEarlier this month, the couple celebrated their 7-year wedding anniversary. They tied the knot in July 2017. Peta shared a funny and heartfelt post on Instagram to commemorate the occasion writing, “I guess the 7th year itch didn’t happen?? 🤷🏼‍♀️ haha! I ❤️you @maksimc …7 years married & 10 years together 🤯 Thank you for flirting with me way back in 2012 and putting the moves on me to get us 3 children, a dog and a beautiful life.”\n\nCongratulations to Peta and Maks on the birth of their third son!"
