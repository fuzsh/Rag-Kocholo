        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Ryan Crocker interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. Thank you for coming to Charlottesville. We talked beforehand about the ground rules, and I’ll repeat the most fundamental one is that this is being conducted under a veil of confidentiality. We’re not allowed to repeat anything that occurs during the course of the interview. Ambassador Crocker will have the right to review the transcript and to place any stipulations or redactions that he wishes to make, and that will become the authoritative record of the interview.\n\nThe other thing we normally do at the beginning is go around the table and identify ourselves, so the transcriber will know which voice belongs to whom. I’m Russell Riley. I head the Presidential Oral History Program here.\n\nCrocker\n\nRyan Crocker. Former Ambassador to Iraq.\n\nPerry\n\nI’m Barbara Perry. I’m a senior fellow here at the Miller Center.\n\nBakich\n\nI’m Spencer Bakich, an assistant professor at Sweet Briar College.\n\nRiley\n\nOne of the real challenges in figuring out how to start the interview is that we could easily spend a day and a half talking about your experience before the second President Bush comes into office. Obviously, we can’t do that. What I’d like to get you to do is to talk a little bit about the relevant experiences or the kinds of lessons you were picking up when you were serving in ambassadorial posts from 1990 on. And tell us a bit about your relationship with Presidents. The first President Bush, 41, and President [William] Clinton, to the extent that you had any direct interaction with them or their White Houses.\n\nCrocker\n\nBush 41 was the last American President to receive his ambassadors before they went out to post.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nCrocker\n\nPresident Clinton discontinued that practice and successive Presidents have not picked it up. I did meet President [George H. W.] Bush, actually not before I went to Lebanon. I went out in a hurry because there was a brief window to reopen the post in late 1990. It had been closed for a year and a half for security reasons. So we grabbed it. It was subsequently evacuated in January 1991 when Desert Storm commenced. And it was during that interval, before I returned to Beirut, that I met with President Bush. In my view, it’s a very good investment of 15 minutes of Presidential time. It connects the Ambassador directly with the Commander in Chief. It gives the Commander in Chief the opportunity to say, “Here are the two or three things that are important to me and my administration,” and it just shapes and sets the new Ambassador going out.\n\nI did not have further direct interaction with President Bush. I did with Secretary [James] Baker, who came to visit, the first secretarial visit to Beirut in a decade. I was also there for the previous secretarial visit with George Shultz.\n\nI was President Clinton’s Ambassador twice, to Kuwait and to Syria. I did have direct interaction with him on both occasions. He visited Kuwait, the first visit ever to Kuwait by a sitting President. This was late October 1994, following an effort by Saddam Hussein to reinvade the country. I had the chance to brief the President. I subsequently briefed him in the Oval Office in Washington prior to a visit by the Emir of Kuwait.\n\nI was struck by his detailed grasp of issues. He seemed to me a person of extraordinary intellect. The ability, as he was running the rest of the world, to actually know what happened in Kuwait and to have questions that seemed to be prompted by his own mind, not something a staffer had put in front of him.\n\nI moved on to Syria, and as we began to develop some momentum on a Syrian-Israeli negotiation, I spent ten days in January of 2000 in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, and saw a lot of the President at that time. Again, I was impressed by his grasp of detail at the tactical level but also a broad strategic picture of where we were trying to get.\n\nThe last time I saw President Clinton was in Geneva at the end of March 2000. A summit between the President and Hafez al-Assad. That basically put an end to our hope for a Syrian-Israeli peace. Extremely disappointing to all of us. The President impressed me in that instance by recognizing this wasn’t going to work. There was no point in flogging an all-too-dead horse. You move on. No point in recriminations or “we should have done this, that, the other.” We gave it our best shot. Didn’t work. We move on.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd this was in early 2000?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes. The Shepherdstown negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister [Ehud] Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were January 2000. The Assad-Clinton summit was late March of 2000.\n\nRiley\n\nIf the President did continue to hold some hopes later that year that they might be able to develop a—\n\nCrocker\n\nThat was on the Palestinians, I think. Because if you recall, Hafez al-Assad died in June of 2000. His son succeeded, and it was certainly my recommendation right after the transition that there was no point in revisiting negotiations with Israel with this brand-new, very insecure President. The track was effectively cold after that for the duration of the Clinton Presidency.\n\nIn July of 2000 there was Camp David II, the effort with [Yasser] Arafat, but that was on the Palestinian side.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you say anything about the chemistry between President Clinton and the regional leaders you were dealing with? Assad in particular, but to the extent that you were witnessing this with others in Shepherdstown.\n\nCrocker\n\nIn the case of the Kuwaitis, it was a very positive chemistry because in Kuwaiti eyes he had made good on Bush 41’s commitment to the defense and security of Kuwait. As Saddam moved south, President Clinton immediately moved to deploy U.S. troops into Kuwait, and that caused Saddam to say it was all an exercise, which it wasn’t. But the Kuwaitis were hugely grateful, so it was quite a celebration, both in Kuwait and then subsequently when the Emir visited Washington.\n\nVery different with Hafez al-Assad. Assad had, by the time of the Geneva summit, decided that he knew his own health was failing and although we didn’t know it at the time, he had made the decision that his succession was best managed by focusing on an internal agenda and not risking a bold step on peace with Israel.\n\nHe arrived in Geneva with his mind made up. I remember there was some initial, fairly cordial banter between the two, they seemed to enjoy each other, but very quickly the discussion shifted into substance and very quickly it became clear that there was not going to be an agreement.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd that wasn’t knowable beforehand? If you’re staffing Presidential time, you don’t want a President to spend his time on something that looks to be a dead end, right?\n\nCrocker\n\nWe had, by that time, invested a great deal in this process and come very close at Shepherdstown.\n\nRiley\n\nI see.\n\nCrocker\n\nI had a concern going into Geneva because it had proven difficult to schedule the meeting. The Syrians did not come right back and say, “Yes, we can be there.” They said, “Well, this date isn’t good, maybe later.” And I was doing the discussions with the Foreign Minister at the time and sensed that this was not a good thing.\n\nRiley\n\nThe President was already abroad at that time? I’m trying to recall my Clinton history here, and I have some vague recollection that he was already in the area for something else and this was an add-on.\n\nCrocker\n\nHe was. He was coming back from South Asia at the time, and it was something of a stretch for him to be able to do this. I remember he came in very late to Geneva the night before the talks.\n\nRiley\n\nWas it conventional in the Clinton administration to have career diplomats in these sensitive posts in the Middle East and South Asia, or were there political appointees in some of these positions?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt was pretty much the established pattern. Both Republican and Democratic administrations in recent times have tended to have career officers in Arab posts with a couple of exceptions. Morocco. Saudi Arabia. And perhaps one other smaller Gulf state, normally Qatar. And that doesn’t change much from administration to administration. Democrats and Republicans tend to approach it the same.\n\nBakich\n\nYou made a comment that you quickly realized with the transition on the Syrian side any possible negotiations would be fruitless. I’m curious to hear what was the State Department’s task in front of it, knowing that the transition is going to be coming, knowing that the new President is Western educated and such. Was there any sense that there might be some opening or was it simply the fact that watching Assad go through the motions, turning inward, that that was the direction it was going?\n\nCrocker\n\nKnowledge is an iterative process and hindsight is great, that’s how you piece things together. We did not know that Assad was near death in March. We knew he’d had a heart condition for years. He died suddenly about two and a half months after the Geneva summit. It was a heart attack and it killed him instantly.\n\nPrior to that, I had the opportunity to meet with Bashar [al-Assad] on several occasions. The ten months or so prior to his assumption of the Presidency. These were long meetings, just the two of us. And although he had done his postdoctoral ophthalmologic studies in London, we spoke in Arabic. He was not comfortable discussing complicated political issues in English. What I learned from that was that the West was making too much of his Western connections. He had spent about a year in London, and all he did was study the human eye. He did not have other interactions. He was not broadly engaged in British society. He could speak of eye diseases in English, I’m sure, at a level where I couldn’t follow him. But he was not comfortable in English. He is now.\n\nI also learned, talking to him, that he was actually more doctrinaire, rigid, and narrow than his father. His father, after all, had grown up in the days of the Syrian Republic, was educated at what was then the best secondary school in northern Syria, run by the French. He had a liberal education.\n\nBashar grew up in the Ba’ath system. Did not travel abroad at all until he already had his medical degree. So our assessment from the Embassy at the time of the transition first—and this again with the advantage of hindsight—was that Hafez al-Assad had in late ’99, early 2000 been prepared to bet on a Syrian-Israeli peace that he concluded as the way of solidifying his son’s assumption of power. When Shepherdstown didn’t go the way he wanted, he switched to focus on a domestic agenda as preparation for Bashar, a Ba’ath Party Congress in the spring and so forth.\n\nBy June that was how we assessed it. So there were two points in what we sent back to Washington. First, that Hafez himself had decided against a peace with Israel on his watch, so Bashar certainly wasn’t going to go there. And second, Bashar was more doctrinaire and more rigid than his father, not less.\n\nSo we told Washington, “Don’t even bother.”\n\nRiley\n\nThe negotiations at Shepherdstown didn’t actually constitute a summit, but you had Presidential engagement. Did you reach any conclusions about the desirability of having that kind of Presidential engagement in an issue as a result of Shepherdstown?\n\nCrocker\n\nI think it was key. In retrospect, with Ehud Barak, not an experienced politician or statesman, a career military officer, and he had perspectives that surprised us that we found not hugely helpful to the overall process. I think the President was effective in shaping, persuading, and managing him. Since he was Prime Minister, I don’t think a Secretary of State or National Security Advisor could necessarily have done that. My analysis is that it was all a question of timing. Had Barak made the offer in Shepherdstown that he was prepared to have Clinton offer on Israel’s behalf in Geneva, we might have had a deal.\n\nBut Farouk al-Sharaa reported back to Assad that the Israelis were playing games, stringing us out here, and Assad, in my judgment, concluded it was too dangerous, not enough time.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there any other missed opportunities you can recall from the era when, perhaps for domestic political reasons, Clinton was weakened on a couple of occasions, like in ’94 after the midterms and then again with the impeachment? Or were there other places where domestic politics intruded in ways that complicated your business?\n\nCrocker\n\nI don’t think so. It was interesting on the impeachment. We had and have, of course, a very complex and difficult relationship with Syria, but Syrians to a marked degree rallied to Clinton on the impeachment thing. They said, “How can you treat your President this way?”\n\nI would hear this from ordinary citizens. I would hear it from government officials. “This is an outrage. You can’t run a country this way.” He may have had the sympathy vote in Damascus.\n\nI think there were missed opportunities with Syria, but they preceded that by a good bit. I think Bush 41 and Baker, after Desert Storm, after the Madrid Conference, were establishing relations with the Syrians that had there been a second Bush term might have further progressed. But with the change of administration, a new team, something of a shift in emphasis, that wasn’t built on until fairly late in the second term.\n\nRiley\n\nOf your three assignments during this interval in the ’90s, did you have a preference? Is there an order of ranking where you think, I enjoyed this assignment more. I felt like I accomplished more in this assignment, relative to the others?\n\nCrocker\n\nEach one was hugely challenging and unique in its challenges.\n\nIn Lebanon, it was the challenge of opening and maintaining an Embassy that had been closed for a year and a half because of the security threat. I was involved in the mediation that effectively ended the Lebanese civil war and, of course, it was the time when we got the hostages back.\n\nIn Kuwait, early in my tenure when we had the threat from Saddam, the architecture we had in place with pre-positioned equipment allowed us to simply charter commercial aircraft and have a brigade of troops on the ground within 48 hours. It was great to be part of that. It was in Kuwait in late 1994 that I was part of the process that restructured the United States Air Force, that created the Air Expeditionary Forces of combat units that would be assigned on 60- to 90-day rotations in very Spartan conditions. That, in turn, shaped our ability to respond to 9/11 and Afghanistan. Being part of that evolving national security architecture was an extraordinary experience.\n\nAnd in Syria, too, to get that close to a Syrian-Israeli peace was to be a part of history and also to learn how to deal with massive disappointment. [laughter]\n\nBakich\n\nSpeaking of massive disappointment, in the immediate aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, there were numerous potential opportunities that it seems from our perspective the President and the Secretary of State were intent on capitalizing. International public opinion seemed to be with the United States for a great number of months. And the new world order, for lack of a better term, came to naught. You’ve referenced timing on a number of occasions. Was the point at which the United States wasn’t going to get everything it desired in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War in terms of post–Cold War international era, was this a matter of timing? Or was it a matter of incomplete strategy?\n\nCrocker\n\nThat’s kind of a cosmic question.\n\nBakich\n\nMy apologies.\n\nCrocker\n\nI think it was only over time that we came to see that the end of the Cold War and the bipolar system did not in fact raise the curtain on a new world order with the United States as a very dominant but benevolent power. It instead was a multipolar or nonpolar world that we had and still have to deal with.\n\nThe first shots literally of the post–Cold War era were August 1990 when Saddam invaded Kuwait. I don’t think he would have done that if the Soviet Union was still at full power. So the world we inherited after we won the Cold War was a world in which regional powers could drive international-security agendas in a way they couldn’t before. And that also, as we saw with al-Qaeda in particular, but also Hezbollah and Hamas, opened up opportunities for nonstate actors.\n\nI don’t think I see a strategic failure on the part of the 41 [George H. W. Bush] administration. Even with 20 years’ worth of hindsight, I’m not sure I can see how they could have better ordered their approach. There was a failure of analysis, if you will—What was the nature of this world we were dealing with?—but even that would be a reach, because the world still had to show us what the range of disorder was going to be.\n\nPerry\n\nYou’ve talked about the impact of transitioning from one leader to another in Syria. Could you talk about the impact on your work of transitions from one President to another in this country and particularly the 2000 election? The aftermath of the 2000 election and how that had an influence and impact on what you were doing.\n\nCrocker\n\nFor all the spirit and tradition of change that our Presidential elections represent, there is far more continuity than change in foreign policy, as we all know, and I think particularly in the Middle East. The Syrians were pleased with the outcome of the 2000 election. Fascinated by the process. Absolutely fascinated as an authoritarian state where elections were not even a bad joke, to have the Florida recount. The Syrian view was, “Just send in the troops.” [laughter] “What are you messing around with?”\n\nRiley\n\nThat may have been contemplated. [laughter]\n\nCrocker\n\nI think Syrian officials were relieved that it was not [Albert, Jr.] Gore-[Joseph] Lieberman for the totally unworthy reason that Lieberman was Jewish, and they thought that they would then get a better shake from the Bush administration. I remember telling the Deputy Foreign Minister, “Don’t be too sure.” And, indeed, as things played out that was very much the case.\n\nSecretary of State [Colin] Powell came out to Damascus the first month of the administration, late February, to see what the prospects were with two new administrations, one in Damascus and one in Washington. Very much continuity in terms of how the new team approached Syria initially. As we saw, that quickly moved away from any effort at cooperation into a fairly confrontational relationship that reached its current depths after the assassination of Rafic Hariri in Lebanon in 2005.\n\nRiley\n\nDuring the decade of the ’90s, how much of your attention was occupied by the question of terrorism? You mentioned nonstate actors in answer to Spencer’s question. We are trying to get a portrait of how things are before 9/11, and I don’t think we’ve got a very good picture yet about the extent to which this was an occupying issue for people who were in the foreign-policy community before 9/11. I hope you can help us understand that a little better.\n\nCrocker\n\nI have said previously the War on Terror for me did not start on 9/11. It started on April 18, 1983, when the Embassy in Beirut was blown up and I was in it. Of course, six months later was the attack on the Marine barracks. So I was very conscious, very focused, on this new dimension in international terror. Terror in the Middle East was not new then. A wave of secular Palestinian terror had begun in the beginning of the ’70s, but what we saw in Lebanon in the early ’80s was a qualitative and quantitative difference. I was focused on this new phenomenon of state-organized, religion-motivated terror.\n\nWe hadn’t seen that before. And coming at us. And had time to reflect on unintended consequences. How you need to be careful what you get into. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which we supported tacitly, set in motion a chain of unforeseen and I would say unforeseeable events that included the rise of Hezbollah. So from Lebanon forward I had that very much in mind.\n\nI went back to Lebanon to reopen the Embassy in a pretty eye-watering environment. We had been shut down because of the threat of terror, of a Tehran-style takeover of the compound. I spent a lot of my time figuring out how we wouldn’t be taken over. Where you put the 50 calibers, how you lay your wire, how you arm and order your guards. All that sort of thing. How you drive around Beirut without getting blown up. I think as much as anybody in the business, terror has been a part of my life from the early ’80s going forward.\n\nIt was during my time in Kuwait that we had the Khobar Towers bombing, just down the street. We had worked very hard to ensure the Embassy and our military installations were not vulnerable to that kind of attack, but it took a considerable amount of effort, planning, thinking, and resources to keep us safe.\n\nSyria is a net exporter of terror, not an importer. Relatively few terror attacks, but while I was in Damascus, the Embassy was attacked twice by government-organized Syrian mobs. My house was overrun. On the grand scale of things a fairly benign manifestation of terror unless you happen to be the person terrorized at the moment. [laughter]\n\nRiley\n\nYour living room.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd your wife.\n\nCrocker\n\nAnd my wife was the one who had to ride it out inside. So that’s been part of my career and very much on my mind as I move through my assignments, really starting in ’83 and, of course, Pakistan and Iraq also terrorism central in so many ways.\n\nRiley\n\nGetting down to the specific case of [Osama] bin Laden and al-Qaeda, can you recall when that first started showing up on your radar screen?\n\nCrocker\n\nThat was in the ’90s. Of course, the east Africa bombings in the summer of ’98 were what really brought it home, but I recall seeing the reports of bin Laden and the name of al-Qaeda beginning some years before that when he was active in the Sudan.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd you’ve already suggested that because of your personal proximity, this was a live issue for you. Did you find that the people you are reporting to in Washington are interested in these issues? And to what extent are you picking up signals in the ’90s that the United States homeland is vulnerable to the same kinds of things you’re experiencing?\n\nCrocker\n\nI was focused on the peculiarities and particularities of my own situation. What’s happening in the country to which I’m accredited? How does it play in the region? What’s likely to come across its borders? I spent a fair amount of time on that.\n\nI have to say, in all honesty, I never imagined a 9/11-type attack. One of the great questions of crisis management is, what would it take to change your assumptions? I think many American officials, including myself, were trapped in the assumption that terrorism is a threat to America, but it’s a threat to America overseas.\n\nAnd it is interesting because if you recall, the Oklahoma City bombing happened the day before the anniversary of the Beirut Embassy bombing. And there was an initial assumption that this had come at us from the Middle East. When it was proven that it didn’t, I think we all just dropped the notion, rather than saying, “But could it have? And who would do it and why?” Or “Who might look at Oklahoma City and say, ‘Not a bad idea’?”\n\nEven when we had the first World Trade Center attempt. I’d say again a collective failure of imagination that, yes, it was fairly amateurish but still pretty scary and what if you got something larger and smarter out there that says, “This is the way we’re going to go, we’re just going to do it right next time”?\n\nRiley\n\nIn your ambassadorial assignments, are you effectively the orchestrator of all American efforts within your country? Is there a CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] station chief you have responsibility for or are coordinating your activities with? Are there military presences in the countries you coordinate with or are responsible for? How organizationally does the multifaceted presence of American interest within your countries get managed by an ambassador?\n\nCrocker\n\nManagement is the operative word. an ambassador is not the representative of the Department of State. He or she is the President’s personal representative, charged with managing all aspects of policy and all executive branch personnel except those under the authority of a combatant commander. And particularly in the post-Cold War world, with a multiplicity of agencies now involved in the foreign arena, that management capacity is absolutely critical. an ambassador has to not so much assert authority, because the authority is there, but assert an active interest in particularly the non–State Department agencies. What are their goals? What are their resources? What are their personnel? How do given agencies’ goals fit into the broader set of U.S. strategic interests in that country? It requires a particularly active engagement with U.S. military. I had the good fortune of coming out of a military background, my father was a career Air Force officer, so I grew up in that, was very familiar with and appreciative of military culture. I understood it.\n\nAnd in Kuwait that in particular was important. My most important senior relationship during my three and a half years in Kuwait wasn’t with the Assistant Secretary or the Secretary of State, it was with Commander, Central Command. First [J. H. Binford] Binny Peay and later Tony Zinni. And I had started on that before I ever got out there. Went out to Central Command in Florida before I deployed, had gotten to know General Peay, and when Saddam started south, we were instantly on the phone together. What were we going to do?\n\nHe sent out his deputy commander, a two-star Reserve general, and he told me when he’d arrived, and this is when it looked like it could be a war, he said, “What you’ve got to do for me is don’t let him get decisively engaged until we have the backup there. If he wants to move forward with two platoons of tanks against all of Saddam’s armor, don’t let him do it. You’ve got to make him pull back.”\n\nAnd I thought, That’s kind of an interesting goal for an ambassador. [laughter] Again, I had no authority over—these were combatant forces, but I had a relationship with the combatant commander. If I were to call him up and say, “I’m standing here with General So-and-So. He wants to engage the enemy and I really think that’s a bad idea,” I think he’d just hang up the phone. [laughter] But I think that also served well in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course. You have those relevant experiences before you come in. And, broadly, the relationship with the intelligence community within the country if you’re an ambassador?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt’s the same thing. The Chief of Station [COS] is not an independent actor. He is under Chief of Mission Authority. He is part of the Embassy. And this really isn’t very hard, given some of the major intelligence flaps we’ve had over the years, particularly in Latin America some decades ago, the culture in the CIA is—The last thing you want to do is be a COS out there and something happens that comes into the public domain and your Ambassador doesn’t know about it. That is the worst possible thing that can happen to a station chief. So they’re inclined to be sure that the Ambassador knows everything they’re doing because then if it goes really bad, they can just say—\n\nRiley\n\nFor the tape record they can point their finger—\n\nCrocker\n\nThey point their finger at the Ambassador, and that’s the way it should be. I don’t find this at all difficult because in my own sense of it, the heart of the American Foreign Service is, of course, the Foreign Service of the Department of State and it’s the CIA’s Directorate of Operations. Because we have been together everywhere in the world since the end of World War II. We live the same kinds of lives. Our kids grow up together. We run the same kinds of risks. We understand each other. In terms of cultural affinities, I think we’re very close.\n\nBakich\n\nAre those cultural affinities shared with the combatant commanders?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt’s a newer process, but there is a tremendous openness on the part of combatant commanders in a theater of operations like Central Command. And each combatant command has its own culture. European Command is very different from Central Command is very different from Pacific Command. They have different histories, different relationships, different ways of looking at the world, but Central Command as a new command, relatively speaking, in a tremendously complex, volatile part of the world, has since its inception put a very high premium on the command’s relationship with individual ambassadors.\n\nEvery commander at Central Command I’ve known, upon assuming command, and General [James N.] Mattis has just done the same thing, gets on a plane and jets around and visits all the countries in his AOR [area of responsibility] and gets to know the ambassadors because that’s where he turns for policy advice. “What on earth are those Kazakhs up to and why?” He’s not going to know that from Tampa, but he’s got an ambassador out there who he expects will have the answers. So of all the combatant commands, the best, deepest, and most intense civil-military relations are in Central Command.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that at all a function of having professional Foreign Service officers in those positions in those countries? At least theoretically, I can make an argument that if you got political on it, people who were political appointees and other ambassadorial posts, then maybe that relationship would be complicated by the fact that you don’t have the high level of professionalism, the inbred culture of the Foreign Service represented in those communities.\n\nCrocker\n\nThat, I think, has been true. Still is sporadically but largely in my experience not. Over time I have seen the process of selecting noncareer ambassadors, certainly in the broader Middle East, to be a very carefully managed process. No President wants to have somebody out there who is from the party make a mess out of it. And this is where Congressional oversight is important. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, particularly the minority members, are just hoping that some President will give them the gift of a clearly unqualified nominee they can just rip apart in committee hearings.\n\nThis is all a good thing because over time it has dramatically improved the caliber of noncareer ambassadors. Certainly the ones I have known in the Middle East have been top-notch individuals. And Saudi Arabia, because the Saudis insist on it, is always a noncareer Ambassador. That’s not our demand. The Saudis want someone whom they believe can pick up the phone and talk directly to the President.\n\nSuccessive Central Command commanders have had very productive relationships with successive noncareer ambassadors in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBakich\n\nCan I ask the question from the reverse angle? Has it been your experience that leaders in foreign countries attempt to play ambassadors and combatant commanders off each other?\n\nCrocker\n\nOnly if you’re dumb enough to give them the opportunity and I think, by and large, we’re not that dumb.\n\nRiley\n\nVery good. Barbara had asked the question about the transition abroad, and you told us about the Syrian reaction to what was going on in Florida. Was it part of your job as the Ambassador during an election year to help figure out what’s going on in the country as a way of preparing the leadership of your country for what’s going to happen after an election takes place?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt’s part of the transition process. Ambassadors will prepare a paper. “Here are the key issues in this country. Here’s why they’re key. Here’s how I would suggest the new administration approach them.” And then that goes back to State and it’s incorporated into the State transition process.\n\nRiley\n\nCandidate briefing material.\n\nCrocker\n\nYes. That starts immediately after an election.\n\nRiley\n\nMy question was more about what’s going on in the United States and whether you are in any way trying to serve as an interpreter for the realities of domestic politics to the Syrians or to the Lebanese or the Kuwaitis if you happen to be there.\n\nCrocker\n\nAmbassadors have a lot of responsibilities. Two of the most fundamental are explaining the country of one’s accreditation to Washington and explaining America to the country of one’s accreditation. That if you Syrians proceed with this really dumb plan you’ve got, here is the kind of reaction you’re going to get out of the U.S. and here’s why. That’s part of the job.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right. How do you end up in a central State Department position under President [George W.] Bush 43?\n\nCrocker\n\nI was finishing up my time in Damascus in 2001. I’d had three successive ambassadorial assignments in three fairly challenging places. I wanted to go off and spend a year as a diplomat-in-residence in some nice cushy place like the University of Virginia. [laughter]\n\nI was approached with the idea that I really should be Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs and reminded that I had not paid my dues in Washington at all. At all.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were approached by?\n\nCrocker\n\nBill Burns, the Assistant Secretary designate. He was coordinating, of course, with Deputy Secretary [Richard] Armitage and Secretary Powell. With not inconsiderable reluctance I agreed to do it and arrived back in main State about two and a half weeks before 9/11.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat did you find when you came back? Did you have conversations with Burns or others about the nature of the portfolio, or was it just an assumption that this was an ongoing bureaucratic post that had its own momentum and there weren’t any real initiatives you would have to undertake as a piece of the action?\n\nCrocker\n\nI think by late summer 2001, there was a certain sense around Washington that this still-new administration was going to have a pretty intense focus on Iraq and that was part of my portfolio.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay. But this was only a kind of generic, it’s in the air, rather than any specific conversations you had.\n\nCrocker\n\nThere were conversations. The administration arrived in office with the view that we weren’t winning with Iraq. That international consensus was fraying, sanctions were crumbling, and we had a significant problem on our hands. I got there six months into the administration. So that was all percolating around.\n\nNo one at that time was talking about war plans or anything else. It was clear I was going to be pretty busy with Iraq because the administration was bringing a new focus on it. And indeed, on 9/11 I was on a plane up to New York, going to La Guardia, for consultations at the UN [United Nations] with our team with Security Council members on “What are we going to do about this?”\n\nRiley\n\nI want to come back to that in just a second and pick up the story, but were there other pieces of the portfolio that you thought would be important for your labors there? This would also be a two-year commitment basically?\n\nCrocker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nOr were you anticipating that Iraq was going to dominate your agenda?\n\nCrocker\n\nI basically had three components: Iraq, Iran, and the Arabian Peninsula states. And I saw the priorities to be in that order.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have any personnel responsibilities beyond that? Beyond just staffing your particular operation? Were there other key positions that you would fill yourself as a piece of this?\n\nCrocker\n\nI had the offices in those areas as part of my responsibility and an indirect responsibility for recruiting and staffing the embassies under my supervision.\n\nRiley\n\nBelow the ambassadorial level?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nOr including the ambassadorial level?\n\nCrocker\n\nWe would talk informally about possible candidates for ambassadorial postings, but we have a fairly structured process for that in State. Something called a Deputies Committee will meet, consider various candidates, then recommend a short list to the Secretary and so forth.\n\nBakich\n\nTo what extent was there any particular State Department policy preference with respect to Iraq prior to 9/11? Much talk of smart sanctions replacing a comprehensive sanction regime? Was it that level of detail?\n\nCrocker\n\nThere was a broad sense in government, White House, NSC [National Security Council], DoD [Department of Defense], State, that we were not on a good trajectory. Our initial focus was on what we could do to shore up international support for sanctions. That’s why, in the period just before 9/11, the focus was on, how do you engage the Russians? How do you engage the Chinese? How do you stop the Europeans from being squishy? How do we get the international community to say, “This is dangerous”?\n\nThe other element of it was WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and what could we do to enable UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission on Iraq] to more effectively carry out its mission. And this is a question of difference in degree, not in essence. It’s not as though the Clinton administration had just ignored Iraq. The new Bush administration clearly wanted to know how we could reverse the momentum on this.\n\nRiley\n\nTo what extent was Iraq a sore point regionally in the ’90s? I’m thinking about before 9/11, but was it something the countries in the region were focused on? Or is it secondary to everything that’s going on internal to them and secondary to maybe Israeli-Palestinian issues?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt depended on the country. The Kuwaitis were obsessed with Iraq for good and obvious reasons. The other Gulf states tended to say that it’s the other four-letter country that begins with an I that’s the real problem. Iran. The Saudis, I think, felt that what we had done in Desert Storm and the clear readiness that the Clinton administration had shown to respond to a new Saddam threat meant that Iraq was going to be a pain, but it wasn’t any longer a strategic threat. The United States had severely weakened its military, shown a readiness to step forward again, and Saudi Arabia didn’t really need to be deeply concerned.\n\nJordan had economic interests with Iraq through the oil trade. Syria also felt that Desert Storm had weakened a strategic enemy, and in fact, now allowed Syria to derive some economic benefit from dealing with that enemy.\n\nSo with the exception of Kuwait, the region was not overly concerned about Iraq, and that was part of our problem. They were dismissive of the WMD issue. “Maybe he’s got them, but he’s not going to use them on us. He knows if he does that, you’ll be all over him. He’s not going to do it.” We obviously took a different view.\n\nRiley\n\nBut with Iran there was a different sense on this? Was there a greater sense of vulnerability in Iran at the time?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, yes. The Iranians had laid claim to Bahrain. There were riots in Bahrain in ’94, ’95 that the Bahrainis believed were instigated by the Iranians. Bahrain is a Shi’a majority state ruled by the Sunnis. The United Arab Emirates had three of its islands seized by Iran under the Shah, but Iran is Iran no matter who rules in Tehran.\n\nThey felt an existential threat emanating from Iran. Oman wouldn’t allow Iranians into the country. Didn’t have an Iranian problem, didn’t want one. And the Saudis, with their Shi’a-dominated eastern province, which is where, of course, the oil fields are, constantly worried about Iranian subversion. And then there was the Sunni-Shi’a split in Islam. So sectarianism was part of this.\n\nI think with the exception of the Kuwaitis, all of the Arabian Peninsula states would have said Iran after Desert Storm was a greater threat than Iraq.\n\nRiley\n\nIn your return to central State, did Iran—I’m assuming based on what you said before that Iran was not as high a level of priority within the American government as is Iraq. That the focus was principally on Iraq.\n\nCrocker\n\nI think that’s correct. We had learned to live with the Islamic republic, obviously not happily, but in mid-2001 we had not seen the Iranians engaged in new or enhanced activities that seemed to dramatically threaten our interests.\n\nPerry\n\nYou’ve talked of the reasons the Bush administration made Iraq a priority in terms of strategic views. Any talk about what was left undone from the Gulf War?\n\nCrocker\n\nThere were some voices at that time, political appointees in the new administration who were saying we should have just gotten it all done in 1991. Those of us on the career side, I think, virtually to a man and a woman, believed that the Bush 41 administration had handled it just right.\n\nRiley\n\nIn the two-and-a-half-week interval between, did you have a sense about the working relationship and structure within the foreign-policy apparatus of the Bush administration? You’re coming into a State Department but you’ve got CIA, you’ve got the National Security Council, Defense Department, are you getting a reading in the pre-9/11 interval about how well those organs are functioning with one another? Are there any unusual rivalries coming up? Assess that the center of gravity is maybe in a place where State was uncomfortable?\n\nCrocker\n\nI had just arrived there. I was a stranger to Washington and to the State Department and could barely find my way to the office. There were rivalries, not unusual ones. The classic pattern in Washington is that the State Department and CIA’s Directorate of Operations line up pretty closely. And the Joint Staff is normally also pretty much in that alignment as well. The Office of the Secretary of Defense [OSD] normally is not. This isn’t particular to any given administration. That’s just normally how it works. State, CIA, Joint Staff have a field perspective. OSD has a Washington policy perspective. NSC is, of course by statute, supposed to be the neutral coordinator. Sometimes they are, sometimes they aren’t.\n\nI can’t ascertain a pattern that varies from administration to administration. But that’s the normal bureaucratic political lineup, and it was certainly there during the Bush administration.\n\nRiley\n\nSo nothing unusual there?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay. You said you were on an airplane headed to La Guardia on 9/11. What happens from there?\n\nCrocker\n\nThis was the 8 a.m. USAir shuttle out of Reagan. And as we were beginning our descent into La Guardia, we could see smoke coming out of the first tower. People got on cell phones, and we were still in the air when the word was passing around the plane that an aircraft had hit the tower.\n\nJust as we landed, the second tower was hit. We were one of the last flights to get into La Guardia. My mission was to get to the United Nations and that’s what I was going to do, so my colleague and I got a cab and were stuck in traffic on the Queensboro Bridge and watched both towers go down and never could get into Manhattan.\n\nRented a car back on Long Island. Found a hotel in central Long Island and basically stole the car. They said we couldn’t take it off the island, and we headed for Orient Point and the Connecticut ferry and the next day made the long drive back to D.C. Like other Americans we figured it out in the car that it was no coincidence the Northern Alliance commander, Ahmad Shah Massoud, had been assassinated just a few days before.\n\nSo on 9/12 we were saying to each other, “This was al-Qaeda.”\n\nRiley\n\nSo you head back to Washington. What’s happening in the days after that? What are you occupied with and what are you seeing within the department?\n\nCrocker\n\nOf course, 9/11 changed and still changes the country and the world, so whatever we were doing on the 10th of September, we weren’t doing that anymore.\n\nIt’s all pretty much a blur, but the judgment that this came to us from al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan was an assumption very early on. My responsibility was working with all of the Gulf states, sharing assessments, reviewing our mil-to-mil agreements and, starting in September, ensuring that we had overflight, refueling, staging arrangements in all the key Gulf states. And working with the ambassadors in Washington, our ambassadors out there, where we needed new architecture to be sure we got it.\n\nThe other thing I became involved in right after 9/11 was something called the Geneva Initiative with Iran. This was a preexisting mechanism involving Iran, the United States, Germany, and Italy, under the United Nations as a convener, to discuss Afghanistan. It was basically a way of putting the U.S. and Iran in the same room on an issue of common concern. The Germans and Italians were there for not particularly good reasons except to give us cover. The Italians because they had a significant section of the Afghan, not government in exile but government in waiting, the King and so forth, and the Germans because of the significant refugee population.\n\nWe had paid it little attention until 9/11. Our South Asia Bureau handled it. But when 9/11 happened, we got very interested. I was on one of the first flights out of Dulles to Geneva when the airport reopened, to sit down with the Iranians and start a serious discussion on the what-ifs in Afghanistan.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you participating in any leadership meetings within the State Department about the overall American response to this, or are your operational responsibilities so severe at that point that you’re out and about more than dealing with crafting of national policy?\n\nCrocker\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretaries, really—it’s either the top of the working level or the very bottom of the policy process. Deputy Assistant Secretaries normally aren’t policy shapers, and I certainly wasn’t in this. My sense was that the policy was shaped very early on. We were going to go into Afghanistan. I think the leadership worked that out when I was still in the car coming back from New York. Because the whole thrust of everything I was working on was to get us ready for that.\n\nPerry\n\nCan you talk about the meetings in Geneva?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt was a fairly productive process. The Iranians had three very experienced diplomats who established in our first meeting that they viewed the United States as a strategic partner for Iran, not an adversary. We needed to work our way through our multiplicity of differences, and let’s start with Afghanistan. It was always very cordial.\n\nIt was a process chaired by the UN. The Secretary General’s representative in Kabul, Francesc Vendrell, the Spanish diplomat, had it at the time. But very quickly, I think in our first meeting, I and the Iranians decided to go off and have coffee. Just us. And these were not clandestine or covert meetings at all. We never denied them. Neither did we call attention to them. We didn’t hold press conferences. Some of the media knew about it, never paid much attention, which was great.\n\nBut we developed a pattern as soon as I got on the scene that we would have our little plenary talks, but the main reason for them to be there and for me to be there was for informal bilateral talks that increasingly came to dominate the agenda as we moved through September and into October. Particularly once the military campaign started in early October. We spent very little time with the Germans and the Italians and a whole lot of time together. Lakhdar Brahimi then came in and took this over, and by the last couple of months of 2001 I think we had pretty much forgotten to invite the Italians and the Germans.\n\nRiley\n\nWho were the Iranian representatives? What was their background or experience? And are you speaking with them in English?\n\nCrocker\n\nIn English, yes. Their Director of International Organizations Affairs, the UN connection. Their Ambassador to Tajikistan, who was really their Ambassador to the Northern Alliance. He was the main figure. He had been their Ambassador to Bosnia in the ’90s. He had very close Revolutionary Guard connections. He was the one who engineered the breaking of the arms embargo and got Iranian arms in the hands of the Bosnian Muslims in the ’90s. We, of course, were “outraged and shocked,” but that’s exactly what we wanted to happen.\n\nRiley\n\nAir quotes around your—\n\nCrocker\n\nYes. “I’m shocked, Senator. Shocked.” [laughter] So a very effective operator. And then the third was the head of their international economics department. Not there because of his portfolio but simply because he was a senior and respected figure in Tehran.\n\nRiley\n\nWere these Western-educated people?\n\nCrocker\n\nTo greater or lesser degrees, yes. One of them had actually, as he later told me over a cup of coffee, had—we met in Geneva. We met in Paris at Brahimi’s house. We were arranging to meet in New York at the UN headquarters, and the International Organizations Director said, “I can’t be there.” I said, “Why not?” He said, “You won’t give me a visa.” I said, “We give Iranian diplomats visas all the time to go to New York for UN business.” He said, “You’re not going to give me one because I was part of the Embassy takeover in 1979.”\n\nPerry\n\nSo the discussion then was centering on Afghanistan? And how about Iraq?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt depends on the time. The initial meetings were all Afghanistan, all the time. About five days before we launched the war, they brought in maps and said, “Okay, here’s our info on Taliban strong points. They’ve got this much of that here and this much of that there. Here’s what our agents believe they think you’re going to do. So here are the maps.” And with a great deal of impatience, “Would you please get on with the war.”\n\nOnce we were decisively engaged, one of the things I tried to do was hook up our CIA guys in northern Afghanistan with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in northern Afghanistan. Because I said, “Look, Northern Alliance is going to play us off against each other.” And they took that back to Tehran where it just went into a black hole. That was a bridge too far. But we were up for it, it was just having direct CIA-Rev Guard liaison in the north to coordinate the fight.\n\nBakich\n\nTo what extent was that actually thrown down the black hole? Was there any communication between the CIA and Revolutionary Guard?\n\nCrocker\n\nAccording to the CIA, no. They were ready but it— I don’t know if it would have worked or not. It would have been very hard to do without doing it through the Northern Alliance. But it was fun to play around with.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat did you do with the maps?\n\nCrocker\n\nWe got those back to Washington.\n\nBakich\n\nTo what extent was the Iranians’ perception of Northern Alliance after Massoud’s assassination? It’s dramatically weakened?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo. I think the Iranians played a significant role in helping the Northern Alliance to rally through Massoud’s assassination. We never broke contact with the Northern Alliance, but we were very much a lesser player with them than the Iranians were. I think the Iranians probably should be credited with doing a lot to keep the Northern Alliance steady in those first— They were worried—and that’s why they wanted us to move quickly—about a Taliban push into the north after the Massoud assassination.\n\nPerry\n\nSo your discussions with the Iranians lasted throughout your time at State?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes, off and on. We moved from Geneva to Paris, back to Geneva, to New York, all in the fall of ’01. I had to go to northern Iraq in December. I came back from that and I was asked to go to Afghanistan.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd that was to reopen the Embassy.\n\nCrocker\n\nReopen the Embassy. We called a Geneva meeting. Us, the Iranians, and [Jonathan] Mendel, on my way in to Kabul, and that’s where we agreed that we would continue our talks in Kabul because one of the Iranian representatives then moved from Tajikistan to be the Iranian Ambassador in Kabul. So then we shifted it to Kabul under Brahimi.\n\nRiley\n\nI’m presuming you’re reporting this back up through channels. Are you discovering things about the Iranians that are surprising you?\n\nCrocker\n\nYou historians are going to hate this. Something I’m sure you’re aware of but us good diplomats figured it out a long time ago. You will find nothing in writing on this.\n\nRiley\n\nYes, of course. That’s why we do this. [laughter]\n\nCrocker\n\nAll my reporting was by secure phone from Geneva or wherever I happened to be. I’d just go into the Embassy and get on a secure phone and do an oral brief back.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is a constant refrain with the White House people we talked to, that they long ago learned anything you put in writing either will show up on the front page of the New York Times or will be subject to subpoena. So one of the principal purposes of this project is to try to reconstruct as much as we can.\n\nCrocker\n\nAnd even worse from your point of view, very few senior diplomats keep personal journals anymore. When I first became Ambassador back in 1990, I had advice from a senior colleague, “Don’t do it because it can be subpoenaed.”\n\nRiley\n\nI had no idea it was that widespread. Because most of our projects have been focused on the White House and expanding a bit beyond that. We’re very aware of it there.\n\nCrocker\n\nIt’s pervasive.\n\nRiley\n\nWow. Well, let me return to the question. What are the kinds of things you’re finding out about Iran that are important? As something more than a casual observer from the outside, I had no idea these contacts were taking place. And you get the impression that there are these walls drawn between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nCrocker\n\nNo, it’s one of these anomalies. Media normally all over, “secret talks.” They knew it and you’ll find little references, every now and then, little snippets that this is—but nobody ever really drilled down on it. It was kind of fascinating.\n\nIran is a hugely complex society. Iranians are a hugely complex people. And we know very little about them, having been disengaged in Iran since ’79. So I was pretty modest in the sweep of my conclusions and observations from talking to three guys in a series of hotel rooms on different continents.\n\nThey were projecting their sense of long-term strategic interests between Iran and the United States, of which this period since ’79 was an anomaly. We would overcome and we needed to start talking about these issues face-to-face, and we should take advantage of this dialogue to range into some of these other issues. The constant refrain was that they were all strong revolutionaries who don’t regret that a bit. The Shah’s was a hateful and destructive regime. The United States had erred in giving it so much support, although they understood why, because of our Vietnam experience, we wanted proxies rather than direct involvement. They displayed a fairly impressive understanding of our own political history. Disappointed in the evolution of the revolution in Iran, that what they had fought for had largely been betrayed by these rigid and narrow clerics. Thought that Iran would evolve. Would not go through another revolution but would evolve into a less religiously focused society and polity that would then begin to reknit its ties with the U.S.\n\nSo we talked about Hezbollah. We talked about al-Qaeda operatives in Iran. We talked about spare parts for U.S.-manufactured aircraft. None of us had any authority, we made clear to each other, to talk about any of these things, but why not?\n\nOver time, though, the nature of the discourse and the parties to the discourse changed. The “axis-of-evil” speech, the State of the Union January 2002, had a chilling effect on the discussion. I was in Kabul. My Iranian interlocutor was in Kabul, and he was not a happy camper in the wake of the State of the Union address. He and I kept contact there, I think he was doing it without the authority or even the knowledge of his government. Formal discussions were suspended for several months.\n\nPerry\n\nThat was following the axis-of-evil reference?\n\nCrocker\n\nRight. We had been in discussions with the Iranians on rendition of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to the [Hamid] Karzai government. I put out there that he was under house arrest in Tehran, would they give him to Karzai?\n\nAnd they were discussing that. Then came axis of evil, and they sent Hekmatyar back into Afghanistan, where he still is, of course, to our bedevilment.\n\nBakich\n\nAn interesting move on the Iranians’ part. They had him under house arrest for X number of years, ostensibly to keep tabs on him, and then he is reinserted into Afghanistan. It’s a puzzling move on their part, isn’t it?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt was a reaction to axis of evil. I had no idea of the validity of anything they would say, but my interlocutors said that what this did was tip the whole debate in Tehran in favor of the anti-U.S. hardliners. So there were three options. Give Hekmatyar to Karzai, who would give him to us, keep him where he was, or insert him into the fight against us. And after axis of evil, the third course was the one that dominated.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said you talked about Hezbollah? What are the kinds of things you’re picking up from them?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt was all happy talk. From individuals both American and Iranian who had not even authority to discuss these issues, let alone make anything happen about them.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nCrocker\n\nBut their approach was that support for Hezbollah was not a vital Iranian national security imperative. That it was a negotiable. That Iran had deep historic ties to the Shi’a community of Lebanon, which is true, it goes back to the sixteenth century, and would want to maintain those ties but need not necessarily do so through an armed militia.\n\nThat’s when we talked a bit about if we could structure a package deal where the arms from Iran to Hezbollah cease but another shipment goes another way, which is badly needed spare parts for their old 727s and 737s. Could we put something like that together?\n\nBut this never got anywhere because you had axis of evil. You had several suspended talks. And then you had a change of players. [Mohammad] Javad Zarif, their United Nations Ambassador, moved in, the individuals with whom I was speaking moved out, and that was effectively a severe downgrading on the part of the Iranians of the dialogue because at least one of my interlocutors was directly connected to the Revolutionary Guard and may have been a Revolutionary Guardsman and could deliver. They did deliver several al-Qaeda facilitators to Karzai, even after axis of evil. And he arranged it.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that through your own personal engagement?\n\nCrocker\n\nRight. Zarif, a very polished diplomat, was in New York because he was connected to nothing. Reaction to axis of evil, you’ll have the poster boy for Iranian diplomacy vis-à-vis the West in place, but the substance of the dialogue is cut off.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd did you report that in turn back to Washington? What you saw in the aftermath?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, yes.\n\nPerry\n\nSo you reported that back.\n\nCrocker\n\nYes, I did.\n\nPerry\n\nIn very specific terms about where the talks were going and what things might have come out of them?\n\nCrocker\n\nThey knew the things. I reported by telephone. There weren’t going to be my fingerprints on anything.\n\nRiley\n\nWho are you reporting to?\n\nCrocker\n\nColleagues in the Bureau.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay.\n\nCrocker\n\nAnd I gave it as my assessment that the departure of the team I started with was not a good sign in terms of Iranian attitudes on the efficacy of the dialogue any longer.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat you just painted for us is a picture of bureaucratic infighting in Iran that has an effect. Any of that on our side? Are you getting pushback from people in Defense or whatever?\n\nCrocker\n\nWith the picture of extreme polarization that is painted, not without validity, of the bureaucratic politics of Washington, it was interesting to me that while there were certainly those in the White House and in OSD who did not think this dialogue was a good idea at all, no one tried to block it, shut it off, constrain it, constrain me in any way.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay.\n\nCrocker\n\nBut neither did anybody tell me that “axis of evil” was going to be in the speech.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you know if anybody at State was circulated on this?\n\nCrocker\n\nI was sitting in Kabul, I have no idea.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right, why don’t we take a five-minute break?\n\nR. Crocker, 9/9–10/2010 2\n\n[BREAK]\n\nBakich\n\nYou mentioned some of the negative consequences from the axis-of-evil speech. We’re familiar with a number of the criticisms, but were there, from your operational and detail-work perspective, any opportunities, positives that emerged from the framing of the American threat complex construct in that way?\n\nCrocker\n\nNot that I could see, but I was narrowly focused and I was in theater. We knew and know so little about Iranian internal-power dynamics. Very hard for any of us to gauge. And I have no idea if my interlocutor was ever telling me the truth. His assertion was that, at a time of vigorous debate in Iran over whether to cooperate with or confront the United States, beginning with Afghanistan, this tipped it into confrontation. I suppose one aspect of this is to say that’s where it would have gone anyway and better to get it there sooner rather than later. I just don’t know.\n\nRiley\n\nWas anybody else going with you to these meetings?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes. I was accompanied in early meetings by a representative from the South Asia Bureau. As these talks became more substantive and as we moved into operations in Afghanistan my secondment was somebody at the NSC.\n\nRiley\n\nBut nobody from Defense or from the intelligence community was involved in these discussions?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nWas Iraq on the agenda for these discussions?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt was. As I noted, there was an increasing concern and focus on Iraq in view of the fact that we had had some effective cooperation on a common enemy in the form of the Taliban and al-Qaeda to Iran’s east, and there might be scope to talk about cooperation on an Iranian and American enemy to Iran’s west.\n\nBut the dialogue really went through the transition into Zarif’s leadership before that, went beyond, “Here’s something we could talk about.”\n\nRiley\n\nAnd if you go back and read the secondary accounts now, the question of Iraq is already blossoming within the halls of American government. Were they hearing this? Were they or were they not concerned that this was the next step?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, they were very much aware of it. But the free-flowing nature of the exchange had really evaporated with the change of personalities. The dialogue ceased in May 2003. Zal Khalilzad had moved in for the last few sessions, and these were pretty stiff affairs. Right before the commencement of hostilities in Iraq, we kind of laid down markers with the Iranians on their nonintervention. But by this point, these had become very formalized and pretty stilted affairs.\n\nAnd there was an interesting subtext to all of this, which is that we were working very closely in the run up to and the immediate aftermath of Operation Iraqi Freedom with an Iraqi exile group with extremely close ties to the Iranians. So it was a multiple-layered dialogue, and I was involved in different aspects of it.\n\nRiley\n\nI’m sure we’ll want to dig into that later. You mentioned that you were in northern Iraq in December of 2001, which did show up in the briefing book. Could you tell us a bit about the purpose of that visit and what transpired?\n\nCrocker\n\nAs you know we have a long and checkered relationship with Iraq’s Kurds. The Kurdish rising of 1991 was a chapter very much on our minds. But it goes back well before that. The Algiers Accords in 1976 basically was seen as an Iraq-Iran accord backed by the U.S. that gave both Iraq and Iran a free hand against their Kurds. Seen by Kurds as a U.S. betrayal, ’91 was another U.S. betrayal, and so forth.\n\nRiley\n\nSeventy-six, you said?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes. A long, tangled history that needn’t concern us here in depth except to say we knew it and they knew it. So my mission in 2001 was to establish contact with the two primary Kurdish groups and their leaders and say, “Hey, you know what? Let’s not do dumb stuff. We take the Iraqi threat seriously. We are cognizant of your tragic history with this regime. We have not yet made decisions, but we will consult with you closely as friends and partners. In return we ask that you do nothing to surprise us or to try to force our hands or events.” Meaning don’t start a war we’re not ready for. So I spent a week or so up there moving around between Erbil and Sulaymaniyah, [Masoud] Barzani, [Jalal] Talabani.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd how did they respond to the concepts you were presenting to them?\n\nCrocker\n\nThis is motherhood and apple pie, and given our history we all agreed that made eminent good sense. They so committed themselves. It was a mutual nonsurprise pact. Important to do because they were aware of everything that was swirling around by late 2001.\n\nRiley\n\nIs there a lot of U.S. traffic into this Kurdish area at this interval?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo, I was it.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were it.\n\nCrocker\n\nIt was a very interesting mini mission because State’s diplomatic securities said, “We can’t possibly support this. It’s an insane idea. We don’t have the assets, and you just shouldn’t go.”\n\nWe had an important policy reason for me to go, so diplomatic security took me to the Turkish-Iraqi border and handed me off to the Peshmerga. Who took very good care of me as you can see.\n\nBakich\n\nUnderstanding the checkered past between the United States and the Kurds, the northern no-fly zone certainly was a benefit to them over the period—\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, yes. The Kurds felt they had been actively encouraged to take up arms against the regime in the spring of ’91 and did so and then caught it in the neck. But they felt we had responded significantly, Operation Provide Comfort, the relief operation in the northern no-fly zone. You may recall, because everything was complicated in the Middle East, a Kurdish civil war broke out in the mid-1990s, ’95-’96, between Talabani and Barzani, in which we played a very active mediation role in bringing an end to hostilities.\n\nBy the time I showed up on the scene, we were in a much better place with both groups than we had been in ’91. But still both of us cautious because of the past.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd how about the Turks at this point?\n\nCrocker\n\nThis is all highly intricate. One member of my delegation was a Turkish diplomat. That was a requirement. The only way we could get in was through Turkey, and the price of passage was to include a Turkish diplomat as part of the team. And I was very careful to brief the senior levels of the Turkish Foreign Ministry going in and coming out and to brief the Chief of Operations of the Turkish General Staff as well because of the acute Turkish sensitivities.\n\nRiley\n\nYou didn’t have a Defense Department companion on this trip?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo. OSD actively wanted to be involved, and we thought it was better to make this a State initiative.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that litigated out or—\n\nCrocker\n\nWe prevailed.\n\nRiley\n\nWas it litigated out?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo lawyers were involved.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay. There are people like Paul Wolfowitz, for example, who have had a long-standing interest in this area. Are you having conversations with Wolfowitz at all about what you’re doing?\n\nCrocker\n\nI’m having conversations with his staff.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay.\n\nCrocker\n\nBut given the attitudes and orientations and personalities, it was our sense at State that you want to be very careful. You want to avoid signals that could be misinterpreted. The Kurds have a history of—it was like General Peay’s two-star: don’t get decisively engaged with two platoons. The Kurds have a tendency in that direction, and we were frankly concerned that OSD representatives might be getting too far out in front of the headlights for where we wanted to be.\n\nRiley\n\nOn something like this then are you at liberty to make a final decision yourself? You said you prevailed and my question is, who ultimately makes the decision about who the U.S. representative is going to be?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt would have been at the level probably of the Deputy Secretary and the Secretary of State.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay. So Armitage and Powell. The next stage of things seems to have you more in Kabul than in Iraq, but I don’t want to surmise that without asking the question. Did you have any other engagements before the Kabul engagements on Iraq or with the Kurds?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo. I came back from Kurdistan in mid-December ’01 and ten days later was asked to go to Kabul.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd what was your portfolio to be in Kabul?\n\nCrocker\n\nEstablish the Embassy and initiate a relationship with the Karzai administration. He arrived in Kabul as Interim Chairman just ten days before I got there myself.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd was that an open-ended deployment?\n\nCrocker\n\nUntil they could get an ambassador confirmed.\n\nRiley\n\nSo tell us about going to Afghanistan.\n\nCrocker\n\nFrom the time I was told to the time I arrived about 96 hours elapsed. And 24 of them were in Geneva with the Iranians. It was all moving very fast. A huge logistics effort to simply get the wherewithal out there for a minimally functioning Embassy. The State folks did a heroic job of basically going out to the world saying, “We need a couple of Antonovs,” the superlarge Russian cargo planes. “We need them now.” And they hired one from Uzbekistan and another, I think, from Tajikistan, aircraft that had never seen an air-worthiness certificate. [laughter] And got these things to Germany, cross-loaded supplies, and then literally went in in the back of these Antonovs, riding on the pallets into Bagram Air Base. And this was end of December 2001, it was pretty wild out there. So that’s what I landed on.\n\nA huge effort in a shattered Embassy building. It had been rocketed there at the end by the Taliban, so we had walls broken in, no glass in the windows. A Kabul January is significantly cold. Just trying to stay alive and then function and establish a relationship with Karzai. We met every morning. We were both in town for breakfast.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat’s an Afghan breakfast?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt’s actually very good. It’s freshly baked bread, cheese, honey, olives. It was my one hot meal of the day because we were living on meals ready to eat [MREs] otherwise. Then coordinating with CIA and particularly with the military. And the military had a totally fragmented command at the time. This was liberation on the cheap. Total economy-of-force operation. There was no overall military commander when I got there. So just trying to make a coherent, whole-of-government approach to Afghanistan. My primary military interlocutor, the officer with whom I worked far and away most closely, wasn’t an American. He was a British two-star who was the first commander of the International Security Assistance Force.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd his name was?\n\nCrocker\n\nJohn McColl. He’s now a four-star Deputy Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.\n\nRiley\n\nHow was your feel for Afghanistan before you went in? This is a bit tangential to your core professional training and preparation, right?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes, absolutely it was. I was chosen, presumably, for my inherent expendability. [laughter] Not, obviously, for an area of knowledge I didn’t have. But also because I had had experience in coordinating whole-of-government approaches in crisis areas. And my job was to get the stage set for a permanent Ambassador to come in and run the show.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd do you know who made the choice to send you?\n\nCrocker\n\nArmitage was the one who communicated it. And in those circumstances, you don’t ask whose dumb idea it was. You just salute and start packing.\n\nBakich\n\nThe American military side, is it still at this point CIA paramilitaries that are taking the lead or is this after Special Operations Forces have entered the field in sizable numbers?\n\nCrocker\n\nEverybody is in, and that’s why it was so challenging. CIA had a major role. Special Forces were actively engaged, and you had a Marine amphibious unit down in Kandahar. So you had regular U.S. forces, irregular U.S. forces, and irregular U.S. nonmilitary. And there was no overarching command or even coordination structure at that point. I was on the phone very early on with the three-star commander of Coalition Land Forces based in Kuwait. He had been my Chief of Military Cooperation when I was Ambassador to Kuwait as a one-star. So here’s somebody I know and I said, “We have some issues.” He flew out immediately, and we put together a command and coordination structure that made sense to both of us.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd who was that?\n\nCrocker\n\nThat was General [Paul T.] Mikolashek.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you in a pacified situation at that point or is this still hot?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, it was pretty exciting around Kabul, yes. We had a rocket attack on the Embassy when I was there. Yes, it was still pretty lively.\n\nBakich\n\nAt the point in which this coordination effort reached minimal satisfaction to you, did chain of command stop in Kabul or did it extend to Washington?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, it always extends to Washington. But what I got was a flag officer, a one-star general attached to my staff, assigned by General Mikolashek, who had the authority and the responsibility to have coordinating authority with all military echelons in Afghanistan. So he could call up the Marines, he could call up the Special Forces, he could call up other regular Army and say, “What’s going on? The Ambassador needs to know.”\n\nHe could not communicate orders to them but at General Mikolashek’s order they had to say, “Here is what we’re doing and here’s what we’re going to do.” And then I could handle through him with the COS, the necessary military agency liaison.\n\nRiley\n\nRyan, you may have already answered this question, but I want to go back and ask it specifically. You said you stopped over in Geneva and had another meeting with the Iranians on your way to Kabul. Were there any specific consequences to that meeting? Was that a planned meeting with the Iranians that you were supposed to do anyway?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo, that was one laid on—\n\nRiley\n\nThat was laid on because you were going to be going over. And what was the purpose of consulting with them at that point?\n\nCrocker\n\nThe main purpose was to work out our structure for future meetings and to agree as we did that the dialogue would now move to Kabul, with my counterpart, the Iranian Ambassador, under the UN flag.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd that’s where that picked up until the axis-of-evil speech.\n\nCrocker\n\nAnd it carried on after that.\n\nRiley\n\nBut without much informal—\n\nCrocker\n\nNo, because as long as I was in Afghanistan up until March, I regularly saw my Iranian counterpart. We had developed a relationship, and his government was severely unhappy with us but he saw value in continuing our dialogue.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd did you also find value in it? At one point you said you had maps. Are you getting intelligence from them that’s proving useful?\n\nCrocker\n\nREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXT\n\nREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXTREDACTEDTEXT\n\nRiley\n\nSo you’ve got ample justification to believe you’re getting solid communications from these folks.\n\nCrocker\n\nNow, to build up his credibility with me, he may have told me that, knowing that by the time we could get there Hekmatyar would be gone. You have no way of knowing.\n\nBakich\n\nDo you know where Hekmatyar went?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo. We never got a solid lead on him after that.\n\nRiley\n\nCould you talk about your breakfast meetings with Karzai? I presume this was the first time you had met him. What were your impressions of him and what were you reporting back to Washington about him?\n\nCrocker\n\nA man with a mission impossible. The devastation in Afghanistan at the end of ’01, beginning of ’02, was almost absolute. Just driving in from Bagram to Kabul, not a building standing, bridges out, we had to ford a river, whole city blocks of Kabul were gone. It looked like pictures of Berlin in 1945.\n\nThis was not because of us. It wasn’t because of the Taliban. It was a result of the Afghan civil war in the 1990s. But it meant that Karzai had nothing. No infrastructure, no bureaucracy, no security forces. Just a cold, drafty palace to try and preside over.\n\nAnd it was working with him trying to identify people who could help him. Afghan-Europeans, Afghan-Americans, the experience there is what gave rise to the Future of Iraq project. How much nicer it would have been if we had a cadre of Afghan expatriates already identified, who could have been brought in after the fall of the Taliban.\n\nThere were a few people like Ashraf Ghani, who is still on the scene, there at the time.\n\nBakich\n\nAbdullah Abdullah?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, Abdullah Abdullah was, of course, Foreign Minister. And also a facilitator of our dialogue with the Iranians because he had relations with both of us.\n\nAt one breakfast meeting Karzai said, “What do you think the new Afghan flag should look like?” And we started to sketch that out on a little piece of paper.\n\nBakich\n\nEverything needed to be done.\n\nCrocker\n\nYes. Everything had to be done.\n\nBakich\n\nKarzai’s authority is derived from something hastily arranged previously?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo. This was the Bonn Conference. Where we and the Iranians coordinated very closely.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat else are you finding out about Karzai? You’re having to develop a quick sense of his own skills and weaknesses and strengths.\n\nCrocker\n\nA person of great personal courage and commitment. An Afghan nationalist—and they were, and are, in very short supply. He thought of Afghanistan as a nation, a Pashtun, but very open to the non-Pashtun communities.\n\nBut I also found that his political instincts and knowledge within Afghanistan were, not surprisingly, somewhat limited. For example, among the thousands of other things he had to do, he needed to make choices on provincial Governors. And he would ask me, “Who should be Governor of Ghazni?” Like I had a clue. And he made some really bad choices.\n\nIn one key eastern province his choice was barred physically from entering the provincial capital by outraged city elders. Karzai hadn’t gone through the process of consultation, didn’t know enough about the political landscape to realize this guy was absolutely toxic. I don’t fault Karzai for this. He was an elder in a pretty small southern tribe, who had been in exile for a number of years. He just didn’t have the threads and equipages to—\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nCrocker\n\nAnd we tried to help there. I worked with former Afghan President [Burhānuddīn] Rabbānī. I worked with other Afghan leaders, [Abdul Rasul] Sayyaf. The diplomatic security guys said, “You’re going to go see Sayyaf?” You may have heard of the other Sayyaf group in the Philippines, who have some associations with him, but he was on the scene and an influential figure. We would talk to anybody who would talk to us to try to say, “Afghans’ future now lies with the success of this new interim administration. You’ve got to put your past differences aside. They can be sorted out later, but we all have to rally together.”\n\nAnd then I got out around the country as much as I could.\n\nRiley\n\nWho on the American side did you take? Did anybody go with you? Are there people who are knowledgeable about the country who are members of an inner circle that you’re working with on the U.S. side?\n\nCrocker\n\nAfghan experts ten years ago weren’t in short supply, they were nonexistent. What I was able to do was pull in a couple of Farsi-speaking Foreign Service officers who had the direct language skill—we didn’t have to rely on Afghan interpreters—and had some knowledge of that broad area. More Iran than Afghanistan, but still it was a help.\n\nRiley\n\nYou’re coming into an experience that, in the most literal sense, must be unique and you’re having to build something from nothing. And there will be some threads of your previous experience that help inform this. Are there historical analogies that help you in this sense? Are there things you’ve read or immersed yourself in before this time? Are you just relying on personal instincts and your diplomatic training to get you through this?\n\nCrocker\n\nI’ve always been a big fan of history. My graduate work was in Near Eastern history, and I certainly was aware of both British and Soviet experiences in Afghanistan. So a clear imperative was asserting right from the beginning, “We are not an occupying power.” That was the importance of the Bonn Conferences, the UN-brokered formation of the Afghan Interim Authority, a fully sovereign authority at least in name.\n\nAvoiding the appearance and the reality of unilateralism. Not the Americans calling the shots. It all goes through Karzai. And to ensure we were all sending that signal, hence the importance of the relationship with General McColl. He and I, it’s kind of interesting because it’s what [David] Petraeus and I did later in Iraq. We would normally go see—my breakfasts were separate but McColl and I, a couple of times a week, would go together to see Karzai. Military-civilian, American and international, in support of an Afghan authority. Trying to avoid the narrative of another Western occupation of Afghanistan from taking hold.\n\nAnd, in an ironic way, the very small force footprint we had at that time actually assisted in that, because you didn’t have American soldiers on every street corner. It was this careful balance. We could not be styled as occupiers, yet we had to have enough leverage to prevent really bad things from happening. And we saw that contradiction play out fairly early on.\n\nWhat was the operation at the beginning of March? It was our first big effort to eradicate—\n\nPerry\n\nThat would be Anaconda?\n\nCrocker\n\nAnaconda. Right. That was an economy-of-force operation, and it did not go particularly well. A bigger, stronger enemy than we had anticipated. And that was when we had everybody in it. The 10th Mountain Division commander had overall command, but he had Special Forces, CIA paramilitaries and then, as we got bogged down, we had no armor. None. The mostly Tajik Norther Alliance did have T-54s and T-55s, and, if we were not going to have this be a stalemate, we had to get that armor to Anaconda. But that was into a Pashtun area, and the Pashtuns said, “Over our dead bodies. If they try to come through here, we’re going to kill them.”\n\nMy job was to negotiate with the Pashtuns the transit of that armor into the fight. And that’s what we were reduced to. We weren’t going to win in Anaconda if we didn’t get some ragtag T-54s, crewed by Tajiks and Uzbeks, in there through hostile Pashtun territory to do it. Those were the kinds of things we worked on.\n\nBakich\n\nWhat is the price for that? What do you, the Americans, have to give up? What did the Northern Alliance have to—\n\nCrocker\n\nThe Northern Alliance had to give us an ironclad commitment that they would execute the mission and then withdraw. They will make no effort to extend their area of influence into this Pashtun area. They did make that pledge and they did deliver on it. With the Pashtuns it was very interesting. The Pashtun leader was a wild man named Pacha Khan Zadran, who was later killed.\n\nI negotiated with his brother, who was the Minister for Tribal Affairs in Karzai’s interim administration, and we went through this ballet on a freezing night with kerosene lanterns over why we needed to do it and, from his side, why it was impossible for us to do it. With the authority of the military, when this was clearly at an impasse, I said, “This is vital to our success. It is vital to Afghanistan’s future. That armor will move through, and if necessary, we will kill your brother.”\n\nHe’s a giant bearded Pashtun and he said, “Ooooh.” [laughter] “Why didn’t you say so?” So they went through without incident. We did not prevail in Anaconda. At best it was kind of a messy draw, but it wouldn’t have been that if we hadn’t gotten the armor in there. The DoD was adamant. We were not going to plus-up our forces. Absolutely were not. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut then again, had we plussed-up our forces we might have been on the wrong side of the imperial occupation argument. With even worse consequences.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you’re arguing this is not a two-sided conflict. How many sides are there in this conflict?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, if we had had only a half a dozen sides it would have been a piece of cake. I’m not an expert on this stuff. I’m not even knowledgeable. So trying to figure that out on the fly when you’ve got a hot conflict going on is—\n\nRiley\n\nWho are you reporting to back in Washington?\n\nCrocker\n\nThe Assistant Secretary for South Asia Affairs was Christina Rocca, but I really didn’t have much interaction with her. It was as close as you can get to an almost autonomous command. I had occasional contact with Armitage. But by and large the guidance I had was, “Go out there and do what you have to do.”\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s surprising to me. I would have thought that given the centrality of this to the American effort there would have been a very high-level minder, whether it was Condi [Rice] or—you’re shaking your head no.\n\nCrocker\n\nThere wasn’t. Again, you’d need to talk to others more senior in Washington, because I didn’t do Afghanistan until I was in Afghanistan.\n\nRiley\n\nYes.\n\nCrocker\n\nSo I wasn’t part of the discussions or anything else. My strong sense, based on my experience there, was that there wasn’t a great deal of high-level interest anywhere in Washington as to what happened next in Afghanistan. We had gotten rid of the Taliban. We had answered 9/11. DoD in particular absolutely did not want to see us get involved in nation building, hence the total economy-of-force effort. We had knocked off the bad guys. We had paid back for 9/11. Our work there basically was done.\n\nThat is why I think we were, at least on the civilian side, pretty well left to our own initiatives, which was fine. The resources I did need I could get. Zal Khalilzad was involved as Envoy, although he came out only once during my three months. The military really was not well organized on this. General [Franklin] Hagenbeck, the 10th Mountain commander who had overall authority for Anaconda, had more advice than you could imagine was possible, with a rear area echelon’s commander senior to him telling him what they thought—from Kuwait or Tampa or Stuttgart—he really ought to be doing, without giving him the means to do it.\n\nI didn’t have much guidance at all, which was okay. He had too much. The CIA had it right. They carried an awful lot of the effort there, including support for Karzai. And had the right kind of Washington support without too much interference.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd who’s leading that in country? Is it possible for you to say?\n\nCrocker\n\nI’d rather not mention names. He’s still in active service.\n\nRiley\n\nUnderstood. But there was a direct line of communication from Washington to Kabul then on that line?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nWould it have been helpful to you? I think you suggested earlier that you actually felt comfortable not having any sort of direct oversight, but there are also costs to not having that kind of support on certain occasions.\n\nCrocker\n\nI wanted more from USAID [United States Agency for International Development] than USAID was willing or able to give me. I argued from the beginning that we had to get back in the infrastructure business because there wasn’t any. AID wanted to spend its resources on agricultural development—seeds, fertilizers, pesticides—because Afghanistan is an agrarian economy. And having been out there on the ground, I said, “It’s not going to help if you can’t get the seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides to the farmers and even if you could, the farmers can’t get their crops to market because there aren’t any roads.”\n\nAnd this ran against USAID’s philosophy. So that was a bit frustrating. The AID administrator did come out, and that helped. But it took way too long, and the lack of someone saying, “Afghanistan is really important” did leave it to me and I had limited clout.\n\nBakich\n\nAnd the USAID administrator at this time was?\n\nCrocker\n\nAndrew Natsios.\n\nBakich\n\nDid you sense any direct influence by Pakistan while you were in Kabul?\n\nCrocker\n\nI went through Islamabad and met with the Deputy Foreign Minister. [Pervez] Musharraf had already done his famous strategic switch, so Pakistan was now our ally. I took the opportunity of going into Afghanistan saying, “This is a new chapter. Pakistan should be engaged and should signal to the Afghans it is engaged in a totally different way than you were engaged before.” The Deputy Foreign Minister said, “You know, you’re right. We should send our Ambassador back.” And I said, “I think what you need is a new Ambassador. I think sending your Ambassador to the Taliban back to Kabul is not the signal we’re really looking for here.”\n\nThe Pakistanis at that initial time were off balance and very unsure of what they wanted to do diplomatically for obvious reasons.\n\nRiley\n\nWas there anybody in country who was valuable to you?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, yes. We had a couple of journalists. Kathy Gannon, longtime South Asia AP [Associated Press] correspondent, who was just great. We had a tiny handful of journalists—she was probably the best—who really did understand these things. She was great in just giving me Afghanistan 101.\n\nPerry\n\nShe was in Kabul?\n\nCrocker\n\nIn and out, yes. Between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there any natives?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, certainly, yes. Abdullah Abdullah was my key Northern Alliance interlocutor. Karim Khalili, the senior Hazara leader—again, they’re educating you, and they are also spinning you.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nCrocker\n\nAnd that’s why you had to talk to everybody. Amalgamate all the stories. See what cancels out what and you may get something not too far off from ground truth. He was helpful. Ashraf Ghani, although many, many years outside of Afghanistan, was great because he had the international connections, understood how economies work, and knew people he could try and pull into this.\n\nThose were the key figures.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd did your experience in an Arab culture prove to be particularly helpful to you in this instance, or did it in some ways miscue you?\n\nCrocker\n\nMy experience in fractured societies, particularly Lebanon, was helpful. Countries that are emerging from years-long conflict, weak central governments, different armed factions, so Lebanon was somewhat instructive.\n\nRiley\n\nThere was back-and-forth with the al-Qaeda connection between Afghanistan and Arab countries. Did you stumble across things that—you were hearing Arabic spoken or you would see something in Arabic that you were detecting, “My gosh, here is a piece of a connection that goes to Saudi Arabia or someplace else”?\n\nCrocker\n\nNot really. The hunt for al-Qaeda was, of course, a huge focus and primarily carried out by the CIA. But that was an intelligence and operational matter. There weren’t any billboards up or files lying on the street.\n\nRiley\n\nI thought I would ask. You never know. And is bin Laden on your radar or your list of things to deal with there?\n\nCrocker\n\nHe really wasn’t. He was on the CIA’s list, but at that time the belief was that he had gone to ground, probably on the Pakistani side of the border.\n\nRiley\n\nWas there ever any thought so far as you know to having Ryan Crocker confirmed as the ongoing Ambassador?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, no. Absolutely not. It was clear this was for a limited period of time, and my bureau was getting increasingly antsy because Iraq was looming.\n\nRiley\n\nOrganizationally how did that work on the home front?\n\nCrocker\n\nMy position was vacant.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd presumably the people who were reporting to you then are without supervision.\n\nCrocker\n\nSomeone else in the front office stepped in, but it’s just not a sustainable process given everything that’s going on.\n\nRiley\n\nSo the chronology is that you head back to Washington in—?\n\nCrocker\n\nI went back to Washington at the end of March and almost immediately headed for Kurdistan again because all of that had been in abeyance while I was in Afghanistan.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd what do you find when you get back?\n\nCrocker\n\nThere was Kurdish concern that I had made that first trip, immediately went to Afghanistan and the Kurds were going to be left high and dry again. They were reassured I was back on the scene. This was about relationship building, trust and confidence, more than it was anything operational. We did not want anything operational out of them. Quite the opposite.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd do you know whether there were other Americans going into the Kurdish areas in the interval between when you were there?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nNobody had.\n\nCrocker\n\nThere was a small CIA presence, but they were being very careful, for historical reasons and for the Agency’s past experience. They wanted absolutely no political role at all, and did not engage the Kurds at all on anything remotely policy related. And that was exactly as it needed to be.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd people out of the Office of the Secretary of Defense are also staying out at this point?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes. They agreed with obvious reluctance that they would not be engaged there. But, again, the Kurds are very savvy in Washington, have representatives there. Lots of private Americans were cruising around speaking in the name of official Americans. With what authority, who knows? It’s the way we do business.\n\nBakich\n\nThere’s clearly a Bureau of South Asian Affairs, Bureau of Near East Affairs. At this point was it odd for someone to essentially go in and represent an area that isn’t officially on the letterhead, or does that happen far more frequently than we would expect?\n\nCrocker\n\nIt was a unique situation. I did have experience, primarily in Lebanon, but also in Kuwait, of civil-military stuff. And I wasn’t the policy guy or the area guy, I was the operations guy.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you get debriefed by Congress when you came back from Kabul?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo, I didn’t. I had some contacts, particularly on the House Appropriations side, conveying my impression that this was going to need to be a major U.S. investment and that I wasn’t sure the administration was making the requests, so the appropriators might want to be asking some hard questions of where we go from here.\n\nRiley\n\nI’m assuming you had no codels [Congressional delegations] in Afghanistan?\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, no. We did.\n\nRiley\n\nYou did. Okay, we need to hear about that then. Do you have any recollections of those?\n\nCrocker\n\nWe had numerous codels. The first codel on my watch was then-Senator [Joseph] Biden, who spent a couple of days sleeping with us in the Embassy, eating our MREs. There was an effort in Washington to limit codels because of our ability to support them. I said, “Let them come.” The more Congressional interest we have, the better our chances of sustaining the resources for engagement. Codels were us, and it was a gamble because you lose a codel out there, it really isn’t good for your policy.\n\nWhat they did was bunch them. Biden came out alone, but the rest generally came in groups. We tried to get them in in the morning and out in the evening so we didn’t have to deal with the logistics of an overnight.\n\nRiley\n\nBut in Biden’s case you did.\n\nCrocker\n\nIn Biden’s case we did. Given his seniority on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay, but beyond that they were—\n\nCrocker\n\nThey came out in groups.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd where would they go from there if they weren’t overnighting? Where would they go to sleep?\n\nCrocker\n\nNormally they came in and out from Pakistan. Sometimes from Uzbekistan.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right. Did you have as a part of your portfolio once you went back to Washington the Iraqi government in exile? The groups that are beginning to form looking at—\n\nCrocker\n\nOh, sure. That had started before I went out. We had the Iraq Liberation Act from the Clinton years, so we were in touch with all of the exile groups, some of which we were supporting financially.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat is your role in that? Do you have any specific recollections of meeting with them at various places?\n\nCrocker\n\nAbsolutely. We were in touch with most of the groups. I initiated senior-level dialogue with the Dawa Party. We had been very unsure of them since the early ’80s. Believed they were involved in the bombing of our Embassy in Kuwait in December of ’83. In 1990, with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when the jail was liberated so to speak, they fled to Iran. That’s when we thought, Ah, these were Iranian agents, not Dawa mainstream, but still there were question marks. I made the recommendation, which was approved at senior levels, that if we were going to seriously engage with Iraq, we had to deal with its oldest, established, non-Ba’ath political party, which was Dawa. And had a meeting in Washington with Ibrahim al-Jaafari who, several years later, went on to become Prime Minister.\n\nRiley\n\nHas the equation shifted at all by the time you come back to Washington, in terms of the certitude?\n\nCrocker\n\nThe momentum was clearly developing.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that a surprise to you?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nYou figured it was going to happen at some point?\n\nCrocker\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nSo what is occupying most of your time then? You go back to State and you’ve got—\n\nPerry\n\nIs it the Future of Iraq?\n\nCrocker\n\nThat’s when we cranked up Future of Iraq.\n\nPerry\n\nSo this is what you’re working on at this point.\n\nCrocker\n\nThat was in part driven by the Afghan experience, where, for obvious reasons, we had not thought through postliberation issues in Afghanistan, and we had not identified a cadre of the willing and the able who could deploy to help address those issues.\n\nBakich\n\nWould you mind clarifying the date of the conception of the Future of Iraq project? There is a range.\n\nCrocker\n\nMy bureau had done some preliminary work while I was in Afghanistan. We had our first formal meetings on it in April ’02 after I came back.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd can you tell us a bit about the nature of the project and how you’re going about organizing the effort and who within the government and outside you’re relying on to develop it?\n\nCrocker\n\nWe picked a number of areas of governance. Education, infrastructure, services, economy, security, and so forth and worked to establish working groups that would include at least one, normally more, U.S. government officials. American experts in the field. And then Iraqi-origin individuals with some particular background. We got funding for this to convene working groups in each area that would develop an agenda.\n\nIt was all totally theoretical and hypothetical. If the Saddam regime were to end, and one day it will, what would be a sensible approach in these various areas? It started with an assessment. What do we think conditions are? How would this be addressed both as a technical matter and in a political context?\n\nSo presentations were made. Papers were generated. But for me the key issue wasn’t the planning work, it was identifying the individuals and getting to know them so that if a decision was made to remove the regime you would have people who are in the blocks and ready to go out and address these things, which we totally didn’t have in Afghanistan.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd is the predicate for this a forceful removal of Saddam or not?\n\nCrocker\n\nNo. We were very careful simply to say, “Saddam is not going to last forever. Iraq has a history of regime change, often violent. It would be prudent for the U.S. and the West to begin thinking about the problems, challenges, and opportunities that will be faced in that context.”\n\nThe subtext obviously was, “And maybe we’ll do it ourselves,” but that was never spoken.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay. The conditions on the ground would be very different if it were a relatively peaceful transition to a post-Saddam era and a forceful removal?\n\nCrocker\n\nAs I said, the unspoken assumption was that it was going to be a forceful rem"
