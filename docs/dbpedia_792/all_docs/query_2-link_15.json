        "text": "The Lebanese never run short of their own reasons to keep up the intricate killing and dealing that is their 14-year-old civil war. But once again outside events have brought on hellish bombardments of civilians.\n\nOnly six weeks ago, agreements were made that looked like a breakthrough. They collapsed in a tragic series of ambitions, insults and international politics. Roger Edde, a tireless candidate for the presidency who manages to keep lines open to all sides - the Syrians, the French, the Soviets and the U.S., as well as the Lebanese factions in hopes of unifying his country - gives a revealing account.\n\nAfter deadlocked presidential elections, Syria decided to accept the status quo of rival Muslim and Christian Governments for awhile, waiting to see what the Bush Administration would do about the Middle East. Damascus worries that negotiations will advance on the Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian front, leaving Syria out as Camp David did. But it was relying on Soviets and Europeans to insist on a broad international conference.\n\nTo cool things meanwhile, Syria rearranged positions of rival Amal and Hezbollah Shiite factions in one area, Amal and P.L.O. in another, after brief fights. An Arab League mission met in Tunis on Lebanese problems, which didn't please Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, but he decided not to balk.\n\nThere league members told the elected Christian Government head, Michel Aoun, to assert his authority over Samir Geagea, head of the private Christian militia. Dr. Geagea has no official position, but he said on TV that he was the state, that his militia would absorb the Lebanese Army, and that he had the money and power to do it.\n\nIn a sense he does. Control of illegal ports, smuggling, drug traffic, ''protection'' money from businesses have built a militia war chest of $800 million, well invested around the world, according to Mr. Edde. Cut off from the Central Bank in Muslim East Beirut, General Aoun disposes of only $20 million. But as legitimate leader, he has overwhelming support of the Christian population, which wants restoration of the integrated army and the state.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
