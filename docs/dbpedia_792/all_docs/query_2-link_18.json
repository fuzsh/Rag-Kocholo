        "text": "President Clinton's attempt to broker a Syrian-Israeli peace deal got off to a shaky start yesterday as the Syrian foreign minister soured a White House ceremony to launch a new round of talks with a bitter condemnation of Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights.\n\nLaunching the first official talks between the two countries for four years, Mr Clinton declared: \"What we are witnessing today is not yet peace, and getting there will require bold thinking and hard choices. But today is a big step along the path.\"\n\nThe president, for whom Middle East peace has become a policy priority in the last year of his term, had been due to make a short statement alone, but he persuaded the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, to accompany him into the White House rose garden to face the press.\n\nMr Clinton pointed out that the talks between the two men represented the \"highest-level meeting ever between their two countries\", but he was unable to squeeze any further hopeful symbolism out of the event. Despite US and Israeli entreaties, Syrian officials in sisted that Mr Sharaa would not shake hands with the Israeli leader.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Sharaa followed Mr Clinton's hopeful address with an acrimonious polemic about the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights, a border area captured from Syria in 1967. He accused Israel of trying to rally sympathy for the 17,000 Jews who have settled in the Golan region in recent decades, pointing out that half a million Syrians were uprooted from their villages by the war.\n\n\"We are approaching the moment of truth,\" the Syrian minister said, but he sounded an intransigent note. \"It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return of all its occupied land, while for Israel, peace means the end of the psychological fear which the Israelis have been living in as a result of the existence of occupation which is undoubtedly the source of all adversity and wars.\"\n\nSpeaking after Mr Sharaa, Mr Barak said tersely: \"We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step forward to peace.\"\n\nAfter a three way meeting with President Clinton, both men were due to meet again face-to-face in Blair House, a presidential building next to the White House, to begin discussions aimed at drawing up a roadmap for future, more detailed peace talks.\n\nUS secretary of state Madeleine Albright and her main Middle East negotiator, Dennis Ross, were expected to be nearby. US officials said they would enter the talks only if both sides requested assistance.\n\nNegotiations between the countries came close to clinching a deal in 1995, on the basis of a land-for-peace exchange. Israel would withdraw from Syrian territory it captured in 1967, and in return Syria would guarantee Israel's security from attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas along the border with Lebanon, generally regarded as a Syrian client.\n\nThose talks broke down after the assassination of the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, in November 1995, and an outbreak of Palestinian bomb attacks on Israeli targets in 1996.\n\nThe sticking point now, as it was four years ago, is the question of territory. Syria's president, Hafez Assad, wants Syria's border restored to where it was immediately before the outbreak of war in June 1967, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The Israelis propose instead that the frontier be defined according to lines drawn in 1923, a few miles east of Galilee.\n\nItamar Rabinovich, the chief Israeli negotiator in 1995, said: \"The difference is a few miles, and for Americans with their expansive continent, it seems pathetic. But this is the proverbial olive tree. For the Syrians, to be or not to be on the water's edge is critical.\""
