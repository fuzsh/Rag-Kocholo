        "text": "(AP) AMMAN, Jordan - Syrian Vice President Farouk Al-Sharaa has made his first public appearance in several weeks, ending rumors that he defected.\n\nAl-Sharaa was last seen at the funeral of four top Syrian government officials who were killed in a blast in Damascus on July 18.\n\nSince then, speculation has circulated that he defected to Jordan in what would have been a blow to Bashar Assad's regime.\n\nJordan and Al-Sharaa's office repeatedly denied he defected.\n\nOn Sunday, reporters saw Al-Sharaa exit his car and walk to his office for a meeting with Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of Iran's powerful parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter at the scene said Al-Sharaa looked serious and steered away from reporters covering the meeting. He did not make a statement."
