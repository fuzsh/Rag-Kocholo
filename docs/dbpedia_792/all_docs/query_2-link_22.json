        "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 3 - A United Nations envoy said Sunday that Syria's leaders had promised to pull out all of their military and intelligence forces from Lebanon by the end of the month, before the nationwide elections scheduled for late May.\n\nIn a statement, Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations envoy to Lebanon, said the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, had assured him that \"all Syrian troops, military assets and the intelligence apparatus will have been withdrawn fully and completely\" by April 30. Mr. Roed-Larsen issued the statement after meeting with Mr. Sharaa and President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe withdrawal of Syrian forces, which have occupied parts of Lebanon since 1976, is one of the central demands of the Lebanese opposition, whose supporters have staged huge rallies over the past six weeks demanding that Syria withdraw.\n\nThose demonstrations were set off by the assassination of the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri, on Feb. 14. The protests set in motion a series of events here that have been transforming Lebanese politics. Many Lebanese blame the Syrian government, and its clients in the Lebanese government, for the killing.\n\nStill, the announcement on Sunday was overshadowed by the continuing political deadlock here in the Lebanese capital, which seemed increasingly likely to result in a delay in the nationwide elections, Lebanese opposition leaders said.\n\nMany Lebanese accuse the Syrian leadership of causing the deadlock to prolong the reign of the current Lebanese government, which has supported the Syrian occupation. The popularity of the sitting government leaders has declined sharply since Mr. Hariri's death.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
