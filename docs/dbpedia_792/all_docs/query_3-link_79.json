        "text": "SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. — President Clinton today moved again into peacemaking between Israel and Syria. \"This is difficult stuff, this is very hard\" he said of the nearly weeklong drive for a land-for-peace accord.\n\nClinton returned to the site and began a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa after consulting with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and members of the negotiating team.\n\nOfficials said they had no idea how long talks between the three leaders would last.\n\nThere is no schedule for Clinton to return to the talks over the weekend, although White House spokesman Joe Lockhart did not rule out another visit, possibly late Saturday after the close of the Jewish Sabbath or Sunday.\n\nBefore leaving Washington for Shepherdstown for the fourth time this week, Clinton said the two sides \"are working very hard in trying to find ways to resolve their differences.\"\n\nHis own role, he said, is to bring Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa together and to urge them \"to keep in mind the big picture in the end.\"\n\nClinton said he was satisfied everyone was making a good-faith effort.\n\nBut, even with his intervening, Israel and Syria remained apart after four days of lagging peace talks, their face-to-face negotiations at a standstill.\n\nClinton, who has made Mideast peace a top priority for the final year of his term, was returning to Shepherdstown in hopes of quickening the pace of the talks.\n\nThe president met separately Thursday with Barak and al-Sharaa but did not try to bring the two leaders together for a second three-way meeting, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.\n\nClinton left after spending six hours at the semi-secluded conference center where the delegates are sequestered. Lockhart called the meetings constructive and \"obviously substantive\" but did not say whether the president made any headway.\n\n\"Both the prime minister and the foreign minister are quite engaged,\" Lockhart said. \"There are a lot of issues on the table. There are a lot of things that have to be worked through, and it's going to take more than one afternoon to work on these issues.\"\n\nA source close to the Syrian delegation said Clinton, al-Sharaa and Barak would hold a three-way meeting today, but there was no confirmation of that from Israeli or U.S. officials.\n\nTensions surfaced early Thursday when the four committees charged with handling contentious issues failed to convene.\n\nSyria is insisting on a meeting of the working group handling its key demand for a timetable for Israel to relinquish the Golan Heights, which Syria lost in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe Israelis appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace terms and security measures, such as installing an early warning system at the border and clearing it of troops.\n\nThe Syrians have said they were not ready to return home and tell their people they had disregarded their most important concern — the land issue — and addressed only security issues.\n\nToday, Syria expressed concern over the lack of tangible progress in the peace talks, saying the Jewish state stands responsible for any deadlock in negotiations.\n\n\"When Israel obstructs the work of the border demarcation committee ... it means that (Israel) wishes to revert to its maneuvering ways, which means it is not serious in achieving peace,\" asserted Al-Thawra newspaper, which, like the rest of the Syrian media, reflects government thinking.\n\n\"The Israeli side must let go of its security obsessions and realize that Israel itself constitutes a threat to the security and stability of others and is the source of tension in the region, not the other way around,\" added the paper.\n\nState Department spokesman James P. Rubin said that even though there was no committee activity Thursday, some of the issues that the committees would address were taken up substantively in bilateral meetings between the United States and the two parties.\n\n\"The feeling is that those meetings have been sufficiently good and constructive that they have ... superseded committee meetings,\" said Rubin.\n\nClinton has assured Israel and Syria he was willing to play a helpful and consistent role in trying to iron out their differences.\n\nAlthough two trips are on his schedule for next week — to Arizona and Texas on Monday and Tuesday and to New York on Thursday — Lockhart said the peace talks would take precedence.\n\nThe U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the strategic Golan Heights for diplomatic and economic relations with Syria.\n\nMarking the end of Ramadan, Islam's holiest month, the White House issued a presidential message with a prayer for peace.\n\n\"We pray that the new moon will bring a new era of peace between nations — in the Middle East and all across the world — so people can emerge from the shadows of violence and make better lives for their children,\" Clinton said."
