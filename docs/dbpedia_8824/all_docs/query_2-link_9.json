        "text": "Come experience the magic of Upper Shirley Vineyards, a one-of-a-kind estate, winery, restaurant and wedding venue perched above one of the most scenic bends on the James River. Here in Tidewater Virginia the hours unspool at a more gracious pace. Senses awaken, and stress melts away, leaving you space for more meaningful connections with friends and family.\n\nLocated just off Route 5 and the Capital Bike Trail, Upper Shirley Vineyards is ensconced in a rural wonderland. The estate boasts history and scenic beauty on an epic scale and an embarrassment of culinary riches—bottomland produce, fresh-caught seafood—and world-class wines made from our own estate-grown grapes."
