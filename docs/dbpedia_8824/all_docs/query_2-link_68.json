        "text": "Upper Shirley Vineyards is an estate and winery neighboring the historic Shirley Plantation circa 1613 in Charles City, VA, about thirty minutes from Richmond. Yesterday was my first ever visit and I'm telling you all right now, if you've never stepped foot on the gorgeous grounds of Shirley Plantation and/or Upper Shirley Vineyards add it to your summer bucket list.\n\nThis amazing estate's location is just breathtakingly beautiful, situated on picturesque James River frontage. The main building houses a full restaurant, wine tasting bar and wedding venue and is so charmingly southern that it takes you to back to the days of mint juleps on the porch and Scarlett O'Hara. I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere and the generosity of the staff here. Everyone is extremely accommodating and welcoming.\n\nI even had the opportunity to chat with the owner, Tayloe Dameron, and could tell immediately how passionate he is about his historic home, vineyards, and winery and the work that he does here. His vision for this winery, and the reason it's not set among any others, is that he wanted somewhere that was a destination. He said that his is among only nine wineries in the state of Virginia that have their own restaurant to offer its patrons. He wants his guests to have an experience and feel completely at home so that they want to spend a full day or afternoon at Upper Shirley.\n\nWell, during my visit I did just that, and it was very easy. I started with a full wine tasting that includes their full selection of 15 varieties of dry French wines. It's not often that I find a wine list where I enjoy each and every wine, but I can truly say that I did here. I tend to stay away from sweet wines, which Virginia does have a lot of, so the fact that there were none appealed to my palette. They do offer two wines, the #2 White and #1 Red, that have subtle sweetness (although still on the dry side), and would be what I'd choose if you prefer a sweeter option. My friends and I actually ended up buying a bottle of the #1 Red to have with dinner because they enjoyed it so much.\n\nMy favorites from the bunch were their Viognier, which is the state grape of Virginia, and was excellent. The 2014 Petit Verdot was incredible in the red category, but the winner for me, and the wine I chose to take home, was their award winning 2015 Zachariah. It's is a red blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Tannat. An interest fact about this one though, Tayloe said, is that it's one of those wines that just gets better and better with age. He said, and I quote, \"In the beginning, I was apologizing for this wine, now it's winning awards, and next year it'll make you cry it's so good.\" So I won't be opening this baby quite yet.\n\nAfter our tasting, and eyeing everyone else's meals, we decided to get a table on their back deck for dinner and really take in the view that brought us here in the first place. We ordered the Truffle Frites as an appetizer and a bottle of the #1 Red to sip and enjoyed a beautiful day and great conversation with the lush estate grounds and unobstructed view of the James River ahead of us. For dinner I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, which were incredible. The seafood at Upper Shirley is extremely fresh because of its Tidewater location. And if you have a sweet tooth after dinner, they have a fabulous dessert menu with options like Glazed Donut Bread Pudding and Key Lime Pie. I was way too full from dinner and all the wine...next time for sure.\n\nAfter dinner we made our way off the deck and onto their huge patio set up with umbrellas, comfy couches and chairs and just talked and enjoyed the weather. Also on the patio was the cutest camper that they had converted into a food truck that had small plate options and snacks for guests that wanted to have a picnic on the lawn and for when the restaurant closed up for the day.\n\nBefore we left we walked to the edge of the property by the river and got a closer look at the view of the James, went to see the horses that call Upper Shirley home, and peek at the grape vines. Tayloe was absolutely right when he called this place a destination. It was the most relaxing and wonderful day spent at Upper Shirley Vineyards. I'll be back many, many times to enjoy the wine, food, southern charm, and scenery at this historic Virginia estate."
