        "text": "This post is sponsored by the Virginia Tourism Corporation, whom we teamed up with to explore some of the best vineyards Virginia has to offer. All opinions are our own.\n\nAutumn is unequivocally our favorite season. Is there a better feeling than crisp air, crunchy leaves and cozy sweaters? While some people love to pick apples or frolic through corn fields, our favorite fall pastime is visiting vineyards. Over the past few years, trips like Sonoma, Bordeaux, Reims and Stellenbosch have taught us so much about the harvest. It’s amazing how a year’s worth of blood, sweat and tears culminates in a bottle of wine, enjoyed by so many. To be able to see it firsthand is truly something special.\n\nWhat’s even more special is that the vineyards are actually much closer to home than you might think. In fact, we were surprised to learn that the state of Virginia is home to almost 300 vineyards. And with a such a short flight (1.5 hours from Boston, direct to Richmond), we couldn’t resist squeezing in a VA wine tour weekend during Virginia Wine Month.\n\nCurious about the ideal itinerary for a perfect visit? We’ve got you covered!\n\nNow, onto the food. Trust us when we say Heritage is not a place you want to miss on your trip to VA. We tried almost everything on the menu and there was not one thing that didn’t nail it. Our favorites included fried broccoli with yuzu and Japanese mayo, pimento croquettes, house cured Szechuan coppa, heirloom tomato salad with goat feta AND burrata, house made pasta with seasonal veggies (and more buratta), and an innovative Thai spin on hangar steak with peanut miso and sticky rice. We ended on a sweet note with a unique take on a chocolate candy bar, as well as the sweet corn panna cotta. Although we had to be wheeled out of Heritage, it was so worth it.\n\nYou would think that after such a feast, we’d head straight home. Instead, we decided on drinks at Blue Bee Cider, because you can never have too much of a good thing. Upon arrival, we were welcomed by ruff-ly 25 dogs, accompanied by their owners. Apparently, the cidery periodically puts on dog-friendly events to benefit the local ASPCA chapter. We happened to come on portrait night! We tried a few different ciders, but the Firecracker was a fan favorite!\n\nWe tasted 10 wines at Delfosse, with some of our favorites inspired by the French and named after the Delfosse children. The Grand Cru Olivier, a Bordeaux-style blend was our absolute favorite. It paired perfectly with the pepper salami and cheese we noshed on.\n\nAfter imbibing the afternoon away, our driver took us back to Charlottesville, where we checked into the Townsman Hotel. This hotel has a certain je ne sais quoi about it. It’s not quite a hotel, but it’s also not an AirBnb. You have a code to the main entrance and a code to your room. You come and go as you please, with no interaction with staff, since you’re likely to never see one. It was a really unique concept and allowed us to stay directly on the main pedestrian mall.\n\nFirst things first: Mallorca or Majorca? Given every Spaniard under the sun pronounces it \"Mallorca\", we're going to have to with the former. As for the latter, you can thank the Brits, who can't roll their R's or pronounce their AYs. You're welcome.\n\nNow, getting down to business: Memorial Day Weekend is one of our favorite times to travel. Not only is it the unofficial start of summer, but it's also our wedding anniversary. What better excuse to get away?\n\nWith ticket prices the lowest we've seen them, we scooped up two seats on an Iberia BOS to MAD flight Wednesday after work. The flight itself was super short, but Mallorca requires a connection. Pro tip: give yourself at least two hours for the connection. We did not and regretted it. Not only did Customs not show up for 25 minutes, but we ended up sprinting barefoot through the terminals only to be the last to board. We also had to cut some people in line. Not our finest hour but I digress.\n\nAlthough mildly more chill than Ibiza, Mallorca is still a party island. Especially in and around Palma. When we arrived at the airport, we were welcomed by the smell of salt water and a slew of hen parties in matching t-shirts. Nothing against bachelorettes, but we were in the market for a more relaxed weekend.\n\nAlthough we had every intention of going back into town to explore Palma, we never got around to it. And to be honest, we didn't miss it one bit. Instead, we explored some of the smaller towns and enjoyed every minute.\n\nWhere my beaches at?\n\nOur first day was spent lounging by the pool, warding off jetlag.\n\nOn day two, we were ready for some adventure. We drove south to the town of Santanyí to explore. Luckily, we stumbled upon Cala Santanyí, from which we hiked over to the Es Pontas arch. The town of Santanyí is also very cute. We explored a bit before ducking in for some lunch. Our waiter recommended the beach at the Mondragó Natural Park, which is where we spent the rest of the lazy afternoon. Surprisingly, neither of us took a picture, but trust us when we say it was one of the prettiest beaches we’ve ever seen. Think inlets surrounded by cliffs, with the most pristine water you’ve ever seen.\n\nThe logistics\n\nIf you’re heading to the Park Hyatt, make sure you rent a car. As I mentioned, it’s about an hour from the Palma Airport. It’s also great for getting around to the lesser known towns and beaches.\n\nWe rented an automatic from Enterprise for about €55 a day, including GPS. Although we had to wait an hour for our car to be ready, it was smooth sailing from there. The GPS came in handy many times and the Euro cross-over met our needs.\n\nWhen connecting in Madrid, make sure to give yourself ample time to get to the terminal. Keep in mind you’ll need to not only go through customs, but also through security. Plus, the airport is massive. We made the mistake of giving ourselves an hour. It was the most stressful connection we’ve ever had, but luckily it worked out. I did lose a bracelet in the process, which was super sad.\n\nWe ended up doing four nights in Mallorca, which may seem insane. However, it was surprisingly relaxing! Plus, we used the points and cash rate at the Park Hyatt to score a great room deal. That, with the cheap rates to Spain made for a worthwhile getaway!\n\nAs you've probably gathered, we are no strangers to Europe. It's one of the easiest destinations to travel to from Boston - both in terms of direct flights and award availability. It also happens to be full of our favorite cities. Spain reigns supreme in terms of our top list.\n\nThere's something about the Spanish lifestyle that we identify with. Spaniards are super laid back and extremely welcoming. They know their country is a draw for tourism and they embrace their visitors with open arms. We always feel welcome here - even with our broken Spanish. That's why we're so excited to recap our trip the way we intended it: starting and ending with Madrid.\n\nStay\n\nOn the first leg of our trip, we stayed at the Radisson Blu hotel in the El Barrio de las Lestras. The location was perfect for everything we wanted to see and within walking distance. We arrived on a red eye, completely exhausted, hours before check in. Luckily, the front desk was able to offer us a room upgrade for a room that was available. We seized the opportunity to nap! The upgrade came with breakfast, which was perfect. Not to mention, came with ample Nespresso coffee. Overall a very good value.\n\nOn our return to Madrid, we stayed at the the Principal Madrid. Although much pricer than our first hotel, the Principal was pure perfection. Comfortable, sprawling rooms are well tended to and the decor is very well done. Although the layout of the hotel is odd, the bonus is that this boutique hotel has a rooftop terrace overlooking bustling Gran Via.\n\nSee\n\nThere's so much to do and see in Madrid. First things first, you'll want to check out an art museum. Given our timing, we decided to forgo the Prado in favor of the Reina Sofia Museum, which seemed very manageable than the Prado. Plus, we were more interested in Picasso and Dalí than the Renaissance paintings (although Prado has a much wider range than that).\n\nIf you are lucky enough to be in Madrid on a Sunday, you absolutely must head to La Latina. Madridleanos flock here on Sundays to spend time with friends and family, watching futbol and enjoying a pint or two. It’s such a festive environment, with locals and visitors alike. It really felt like we lived here for the afternoon. But Spain has a way of making you feel right at home.\n\nTim and I stumbled upon Bodega Lucio, where we enjoyed several glasses of the best damn Alberino we’ve ever tasted, with some complimentary tapas (yes, some places still do this!!!). Fresh octopus salad followed crispy pork bites that were out of this world. We also had some Jamon Iberico and manchego to round out our meal. Tim still dreams of this lunch and I can’t deny I do too! This is the type of simplicity and quality that draws us back for more.\n\nLate and relaxed, dinner in Spain is an event – and one to be celebrated at that. Most restaurants open at 9 and many places take reservations either through The Fork or TripAdvisor.\n\nIt's been unseasonably warm in Boston the past couple of weeks. 65 degrees in February is virtually unheard of! And although we've been taking advantage of the good weather, we also had a chance to go on our annual ski trip to Jay, VT by way of Burlington for the Presidents' Day long weekend.\n\nIt's safe to say Vermont is a great destination year-round for the outdoorsy set or for those who just want to get away from the city. Vermont is full of quaint towns, hiking trails, B&Bs and excellent restaurants, but winter is especially fun for us as we go up with our niece and nephew.\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nOur first day was spent in Burlington. We normally spend at least a full day in town, but, due to some other vacations planned for the year, we had to cut it short since we were coming straight from work. Luckily, we were able to get in our (okay, my) two favorite activities: dinner at Hen of the Wood and Whim boutique on Church St.\n\nHen is hands down the best restaurant in Burlington. The menu changes constantly, but some highlights from our past trip included truffle hangar steak, mushroom toast, local cheese and the best damn Brussel sprouts in town. Service is nothing short of fantastic and well-timed. TIP: if you forget to make a reservation in advance, bar seating is first come, first served, including the lounge tables next to the cozy little fireplace. American Flatbread is also fantastic if you're looking for something more casual.\n\nWhim, as you may have figured, is a women's clothing boutique with a great collection of designer jeans and cashmere sweaters. Their winter sale lasts from January to February and you can score some great deals. Plus, the staff is incredibly helpful and sweet.\n\nJay, Vermont\n\nAfter a night in BVT, it's time to hit the slopes! We've been coming to Jay for a few years now. The mountain is primarily geared towards the advanced skier, but there are a few good green runs. Our niece and nephew, who are 8 and 5, can out-ski us but were kind enough to do some easier trails with us. As you can imagine, these two are fearless when it comes to the mountain.\n\nA common misconception people have regarding travel is that you need to travel A LOT to earn enough miles & points for a \"free\" trip. Julie and I both have jobs that only require occasional travel, yet we travel multiple times per year using points, sometimes bringing our out of pocket cost down to almost $0. The secret: we maximize the points we collect through every day credit card spend.\n\nBefore I go any further, there are many great credit cards out there offering cash back on your purchases - 1%, 1.5% 2%, etc. If you are happy to simply use the cashback you earn and apply it towards flight and hotel purchases, that is a fine way to limit your travel costs. But, if you want to take your hobby to the next level, you need credit cards that allow you to transfer the \"points\" you earn directly to your airline and hotel loyalty accounts (which are free to set up). Chase, American Express and Citi all offer cards with this capability.\n\nHere's a brief example: Julie and I use two primary credit cards: Chase Sapphire Reserve and Amex EveryDay Preferred. Note: both of these cards carry annual fees, but I'd argue the fees pay for themselves pretty quickly if you are passionate about travel. I'll save the details for another day.\n\nEach card has its comparative advantages:\n\nAmex EveryDay preferred offers 3 points per dollar spent at grocery stores, 2 points at gas stations and 1 point on everything else (with a 50% point bonus if you make 30 purchases in that month - think coffee, drugstore purchases, etc.)\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve offers 3 points per dollar spent on travel & restaurants and 1 point on everything else. Not to mention there's the 100k point sign up bonus which expires January 11th (in lieu of a 50k bonus).\n\nLet's look at some hypothetical monthly expenses:\n\nGroceries: $500 per month (2,250 points)\n\nRestaurants and Bars: $400 per month (1,200 points)\n\nGas Stations: $100 per month (300 points)\n\nAll other spend: $1,500 per month (2,250 points)\n\nIn the above scenario, you'd earn 6,000 points each month and 72,000 in a year. This is more than enough for two round trip flights from Boston to Spain, which Julie and I visited last year on points (the flight cost otherwise was $1,500 per ticket).\n\nIn our travels, we've encountered so many wonderful people, from different cultures and places. While we're always excited to learn from these interactions, we've noticed that most of the people we meet fall into one of two categories: the travelers and the tourists. At first blush, you may wonder what the difference is. Well, we have one word for you: empathy.\n\nBelow are top 5 rules for being a traveler not a tourist:\n\n1. Learn the language. Even a few words will make your hosts happy and more warm towards you. The words that will get you the most places include ordering good and drink, along with the usual pleasantries, like “please” and “hello”. Our best advice is to point to things and ask \"how do you say X in Y language? For example, Tim asked a couple sitting next to us at dinner in Seville what they were eating, and alas, our love affair with boquerones began. In case you’re wondering, Spanish anchovies are nothing like the ones Americans put on Cesar salads.\n\nWhen we were choosing our honeymoon destination, our only criteria was that it had to be far away destination neither of us had ever been. When else can you take two full weeks off without getting the stink eye from your boss? We perused Pinterest and Barnes and Noble to get inspired. Should we sail around Croatia? Safari in South Africa? Flop around on beaches of Tahiti? After months of indecision, we finally decided on Thailand. A perfect blend of culture and beach-side relaxation. And boy was it perfect.\n\nIn all fairness, getting to Asia is a long and expensive journey. We flew out of Boston and connected in Dubai. With the layover, our travel time was 21 hours. Luckily for us, the supervisor at the Emirates check in was kind enough to offer us a honeymoon special on a business class upgrade. That made the first leg of our trip much more enjoyable. TIP: If you're travelling for a special occasion, be sure to let agents know. It never hurts to ask for an upgrade and people usually willing to do something nice for you to make your experience more memorable.\n\nIn Bangkok, we stayed at the W Hotel in the bustling Silom neighborhood – full of skyscrapers and luxury hotels. It was a 45-minute taxi ride from Suvarnabhumi Airport. TIP: Print out your hotel names in both English and Thai. Many Thai speak excellent English, but it never hurts to be prepared.\n\nWe spent our first day relaxing. After all, we just had a really big weekend so we needed to ease into the trip. The W has a pool overlooking the city on the 6th floor. It’s an urban oasis with W-class drinks and bites, with a modern flair. Bangkok in May is extremely hot and humid, so we could only spend a few hours sun bathing. After a luxuriously long nap, we ventured out to our first night market.\n\nAsiatique is large open-air, modern market on the Chao Phraya River. After indulging in some Thai food at one of the stalls, we headed straight for the Ferris wheel to take in views of the city.\n\nThe second day was dedicated to exploring historic Bangkok. We took a cab to Wat Pho and walked to Grand Palace, the amulet market and even ferried over to Wat Arun from there. TIP: Pack flip flops, light pants and t-shirts for visiting temples. Ankles and shoulders must be covered, and shoes are not allowed in homes or sacred places."
