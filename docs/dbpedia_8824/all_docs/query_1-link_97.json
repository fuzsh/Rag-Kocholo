Canal opening surgery, a type of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) applied in cases of mild to moderate glaucoma, has gained increasing popularity in recent years due to its efficacy in reducing the intraocular pressure, its safety profile, the simplicity of its technique, and the reduced likelihood of compromised vision. Nevertheless, the existing body of histopathological studies remains insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of post-surgical wound healing. Consequently, debates persist among researchers regarding the mechanism through which Schlemm’s canal opening surgery reduces the intraocular pressure, as well as the surgical techniques that may impact the outcomes and the factors influencing surgical success. As the history of MIGS is relatively short and lacks sufficient systemic reviews or meta-analyses evaluating the influence of individual factors, this review was conducted to illuminate the disparities in researchers’ opinions at the current stage of research.

The key features of the proposed algorithm are as follows: (i) It only requires that nonlinear equations have continuous and monotone properties; (ii) The designed search direction inherently ensures sufficient descent and trust-region properties, eliminating the need for line search formulas; (iii) Global convergence is established without the necessity of the Lipschitz continuity condition. Benchmark problem numerical results illustrate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness and competitiveness relative to other three-term algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm is extended to effectively address the image denoising problem.

Initially, the crushing value test confirmed the oil shale residue’s value at 16.7%, meeting the load-bearing standards for fine aggregates, thus proving its viability as a complete substitute. Further, the oil shale residue was treated with a 60 mg/L concentration of Tween 80 and other surfactants for oil removal. The treated concrete specimens demonstrated excellent compressive performance and a dense internal structure. Building on this, the mechanical properties of the oil shale residue concrete were explored across different replacement ratios (from 40% to 100%), revealing an increase in compressive strength with higher replacement ratios. In the durability tests, compared to the JZ group, the oil shale residue concrete modified with desulfurization gypsum exhibited a 0.03% reduction in mass loss rate and a 10.13% reduction in relative moving elasticity modulus loss rate, particularly noticeable after 175 freeze–thaw cycles where specimens B1 to B4 exhibited no significant damage, highlighting its remarkable durability. Overall analysis indicated that using oil-removed oil shale residue as a substitute for fine aggregate in concrete, combined with desulfurization gypsum modification, not only enhances concrete performance but also significantly reduces the consumption of natural aggregates and environmental pollution, promoting resource utilization and sustainable development.

The ZnO powders underwent characterization using diverse analytical tools, including XRD, FTIR, Raman, BET, SEM, TEM with EDS/elemental mapping and UV-vis absorption/emission spectroscopic analyses. Accordingly, precursors have proved to affect crystallinity, morphology, surface characteristics, optical properties and the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) model pollutant. It was observed that ZnO derived from zinc acetate precursor (Z-AC NPs) exhibits very fast photocatalytic degradation of MB at pH 11 with superior kinetic estimates of 0.314 min−1 and t1/2 = 2.2 min over many of recent reports. In contrast, the chloride precursor is not recommended along with the employed biogenic route. The intriguing findings could be directly correlated to the decreased crystal size, augmented surface area, the hexagonal morphology of the crystals, high potency in absorbing visible photons, high efficacy in separating photogenerated charge carriers and producing high amounts of •OH radicals. Further testing of Z-AC NPs in photocatalytic remediation of water samples from Dumat Aljandal Lake in Aljouf, Saudi Arabia, contaminated with MB and pyronine Y (PY) dyestuffs, showed high dye photodegradation. Therefore, this work could lead to an extremely fast avenue for decontaminating wastewater from hazmat dyestuff.

This study assessed the potential associations between serum concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and lung cancer risk at the population level. Odds ratios (ORs) for lung cancer across serum 6:2 Cl-PFESA quartiles were assessed using conditional logistic regression. Additionally, we investigated potential effect modification by various confounding factors. Elevated serum levels of 6:2 Cl-PFESA were consistently associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in both the crude model (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.08–2.42, p = 0.018) and the adjusted model (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.06–2.39, p = 0.026). Stratified analyses revealed that elevated serum levels of 6:2 Cl-PFESA were associated with increased risk estimates of lung cancer among males (adjusted OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.19–3.51, p = 0.006), smokers (adjusted OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.25–4.89, p = 0.003), and drinkers (adjusted OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 0.94–5.16, p = 0.049). The results of this study imply that exposure to 6:2 Cl-PFESA at levels considered environmentally relevant may be linked to an elevated risk of developing lung cancer.

Defining evolutionary escape paths and their impact on viral fitness allows for the development of drugs that are resistant to escape. In the case of HIV, combination antiretroviral therapy can successfully prevent or treat infection, but it relies on strict adherence to prevent escape. Here, we present a method termed QuickFit that enables the quantification of viral fitness by employing large numbers of parallel viral cultures to measure growth rates accurately. QuickFit consistently recapitulated HIV growth measurements obtained by traditional approaches, but with significantly higher throughput and lower rates of error. This method represents a promising tool for rapid and consistent evaluation of viral fitness.

It is receiving a large amount of attention from governments and energy companies worldwide as it plays a significant role as an alternative source of energy in reducing carbon emissions. However, due to long-term operation in reduced and difficult weather conditions, wind turbine blades are always seriously damaged. Hence, damage detection in blade structure is essential to evaluate its operational condition and ensure its structural integrity and safety. We aim to use fractal, entropy, and chaos concepts as descriptors for the diagnosis of wind turbine blade condition. They are, respectively, estimated by the correlation dimension, approximate entropy, and the Lyapunov exponent. Formal statistical tests are performed to check how they are different across wind turbine blade conditions. The experimental results follow. First, the correlation dimension is not able to distinguish between all conditions of wind turbine blades. Second, approximate entropy is suitable to distinguish between healthy and erosion conditions and between healthy and mass imbalance conditions. Third, chaos is not a discriminative feature to distinguish between wind turbine blade conditions. Fourth, wind turbine blades with either erosion or mass imbalance exhibit less irregularity in their respective signals than healthy wind turbine blades.

It records both the spectrum and the swath perpendicular to the flight direction, offering a wide 112° swath. This configuration enables global daily ground coverage with high spatial resolution. The absolute values of in-orbit solar irradiance can be evaluated using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), with the measurement accuracy directly affecting the accuracy of constituent inversion. This paper outlines the calibration process for the BRDF of the UVS, detailing the calibration methods and equipment used. It also proposes a BRDF model and discusses key coefficients.

It is widely diffused in the population and responsible for a wide range of diseases, diverse in pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical course, and severity. B19V infects and replicates in erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) in the bone marrow leading to their apoptosis. Moreover, it can also infect, in an abortive manner, a wide set of different cell types, normally non-permissive, and modify their normal physiology. Differences in the characteristics of virus–cell interaction may translate into different pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Joint involvement is a typical manifestation of B19V infection in adults. Moreover, several reports suggest, that B19V could be involved in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or vasculitis. This review provides basic information on the B19 virus, highlights characteristics of viral infection in permissive and non-permissive systems, and focuses on recent findings concerning the pathogenic role of B19V in rheumatologic diseases.

Our research has shown that the FCV LC protein forms disulfide bond-dependent homo-oligomers and exhibits intrinsic toxicity; however, it lacked a polybasic region and a transmembrane domain (TMD); thus, it was initially classified as a non-classical viroporin. The unique nature of the FCV LC protein, with no similarity to other proteins beyond the Vesivirus genus, has posed challenges for bioinformatic analysis reliant on sequence similarity. In this study, we continued characterizing the LC protein using the AlphaFold 2 and the recently released AlphaFold 3 artificial intelligence tools to predict the LC protein tertiary structure. We compared it to other molecular modeling algorithms, such as I-Tasser’s QUARK, offering new insights into its putative TMD. Through exogenous interaction, we found that the recombinant LC protein associates with the CrFK plasmatic membrane and can permeate cell membranes in a disulfide bond-independent manner, suggesting that this interaction might occur through a TMD. Additionally, we examined its potential to activate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in murine and human ovarian cancer cell lines, overexpressing survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein. All these results enhance our understanding of the LC protein’s mechanism of action and suggest its role as a class-I viroporin.

Dialytic (DSR) and urinary sodium removal (USR) are potential indicators of sodium intake. In this single-center cross-sectional study with 60 prevalent PD patients, we analyze the correlation of DPI with sodium intake and the association between residual renal function (RRF) and comorbidity grade, expressed as the Davies score with sodium removal and protein metabolism indices such as normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) and lean body mass (LBM). The value of RRF < 2 mL/min/1.73 m2 is significantly associated with lower USR (p = 0.000) and lower %LBM (p < 0.001). The greatest USR is detected in patients with low Davies comorbidity grade (p = 0.018). Compared to patients with DPI < 0.8 g/kg/day, patients with DPI > 0.8 g/kg/day have a greater sodium intake (3.69 ± 0.71 vs. 2.94 ± 0.86; p < 0.018) and a greater nPCR (p < 0.001). Protein intake is significantly correlated with sodium intake (p = 0.041), but not with total sodium removal (TSR). A strong correlation is observed between sodium intake and TSR (p = 0.000), although single TSR values are not the same as the corresponding sodium intake values. An increasing protein intake implies the necessity to determine both sodium intake and sodium removal. Preservation of RRF has a beneficial role not just in sodium removal, but also in the increase of LBM.

To meet the requirement of green electronics, biodegradable materials are advocated to be used to develop vibration sensors. Herein, a vibration sensor is reported based on a strategy of pencil-drawing graphite on paper. Specifically, a repeated pencil-drawing process is carried out on paper with a zigzag-shaped framework and parallel microgrooves, to form a graphite coating, thus serving as a functional conductive layer for electromechanical signal conversion. To enhance the sensor’s sensitivity to vibration, a mass is loaded in the center of the paper, so that higher oscillation amplitude could happen under vibrational excitation. In so doing, the paper-based sensor can respond to vibrations with a wide frequency range from 5 Hz to 1 kHz, and vibrations with a maximum acceleration of 10 g. The results demonstrate that the sensor can not only be utilized for monitoring vibrations generated by the knuckle-knocking of plastic plates or objects falling down but also can be used to detect vibration in areas such as the shield cut head to assess the working conditions of machinery. The paper-based MEMS vibration sensor exhibits merits like easy fabrication, low cost, and being environmentally friendly, which indicates its great application potential in vibration monitoring fields.

Recent attention has been directed toward EV-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-191-5p, particularly in the context of inflammation. Here, we investigated the impact of miR-191-5p-enriched EVs on the activation of NF-κB and the expression of molecules associated with inflammation such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). To this aim, cells of bronchial epithelial origin, 16HBE, were transfected with miR-191-5p mimic and inhibitor and subsequently subjected to stimulations to generate EVs. Then, bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to the obtained EVs to evaluate the activation of NF-κB and IL-8 levels. Additionally, we conducted a preliminary investigation to analyze the expression profiles of miR-191-5p in EVs isolated from the plasma of patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our initial findings revealed two significant observations. First, the exposure of bronchial epithelial cells to miR-191-5p-enriched EVs activated the NF-kB signaling and increased the synthesis of IL-8. Second, we discovered the presence of miR-191-5p in peripheral blood-derived EVs from COPD patients and noted a correlation between miR-191-5p levels and inflammatory and functional parameters. Collectively, these data corroborate and further expand the proinflammatory role of EVs, with a specific emphasis on miR-191-5p as a key cargo involved in this process. Consequently, we propose a model in which miR-191-5p, carried by EVs, plays a role in airway inflammation and may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD.

To explore the relationship between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and inflammatory markers in overweight or obese women, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving a healthy group (n = 20) and an overweight or obese group (n = 75). We collected data, including clinical, anthropometric, and dietary assessments, and carried out a blood biochemical analysis, the measurement of inflammatory biomarkers (hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α), and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. The gut microbiota analysis revealed notable differences in alpha and beta diversity between the two groups. Moreover, the abundance of gut microbiota in the overweight or obese group correlated positively with adiposity markers, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and inflammatory markers. These findings highlight significant changes in gut microbiota associated with obesity, potentially implicating pathways such as lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Understanding the role of the gut microbiome in obesity could reveal specific avenues for intervention.

In the paper, I examine the interactions of firm characteristics with the value of takeover defenses. The results show that the relationship between firm value and takeover defenses differs in firm age, monitoring costs, advising needs, and their interactions. Takeover defenses are not necessarily more detrimental for older firms. Instead, takeover defenses are more harmful for older firms with higher monitoring costs, but the adverse impact is positively moderated for older firms with higher advising needs. Thus, the influence of firm age on the value of takeover defenses depends on a firm’s monitoring costs and advising needs. The findings of the paper present consistent evidence that takeover defenses have a heterogeneous impact for firms with different firm characteristics.

However, as the number of EVs increases, EV charging networks are confronted with considerable obstacles pertaining to accessibility, charging time, and the equilibrium between electricity demand and supply. In this paper, we present a techno-economic analysis of EV charging stations (EVCSs) by building type. This analysis is based on public EVCS data and considers both standalone local grid operation and integrated operation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the local grid. The analysis has significant implications for the management of the electricity grid and the utilization of sustainable energy, and can result in economic benefits for both residential, commercial, and public buildings. The analysis indicates that integrating DERs with the local grid at EV charging stations can reduce local grid usage relative to EV demand. Nevertheless, there are also complexities, such as initial investment and maintenance costs, especially the weather-dependent performance variability of solar, which require financial support mechanisms, such as subsidies or tax incentives. Future research should focus on different DER integrations, regional and seasonal variability, user behavior, installation location, policy and regulatory impacts, and detailed capital expenditure analysis. Such research will advance DER and EVCS integration and contribute to increasing the efficiency and sustainability of urban energy systems.

This is especially challenging for lower battery temperatures, as this exacerbates the risk of accelerated battery degradation due to lithium plating. Therefore, active battery heating is utilized in state-of-the-art electric vehicles. To evaluate the impact of such heating strategies at vehicle level, we deployed an electrochemical battery model coupled with a longitudinal vehicle dynamics model. Using anode potential control to prevent lithium plating, we assess the time-saving potential versus the energy cost of different preconditioning and fast-charging strategies. The results reveal substantial energy saving and charge speed increase potential through optimal charge-stop planning, preconditioning timing, cost-adjusted thermal management thresholds, and considering driving behavior. This emphasizes the need for advanced operation strategies, taking into account both battery-level electrical and thermal restrictions, as well as vehicle integration and route planning.

Due to the limited availability of anti-fibrotic drugs, the research on therapeutic agents continues. Here we have investigated Moringa oleifera Lam. (MO), known for its various bioactive properties, for anti-fibrotic effects. This study has focused on 1-phenyl-2-pentanol (1-PHE), a compound derived from MO leaves, and its effects on LX-2 human hepatic stellate cell activation. TGF-β1-stimulated LX-2 cells were treated with MO extract or 1-PHE, and the changes in liver fibrosis markers were assessed at both gene and protein levels. Proteomic analysis and molecular docking were employed to identify potential protein targets and signaling pathways affected by 1-PHE. Treatment with 1-PHE downregulated fibrosis markers, including collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), collagen type IV alpha 1 chain (COL4A1), mothers against decapentaplegic homologs 2 and 3 (SMAD2/3), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and reduced the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Proteomic analysis data showed that 1-PHE modulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, providing a possible mechanism for its effects. Our results suggest that 1-PHE inhibits the TGF-β1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and HSC activation, indicating its potential as an anti-liver-fibrosis agent.

The antisolvent can be adsorbed in the c-axis direction of the crystal and further inhibit the growth rate in this direction, resulting in a change in the morphology of the crystal. By adjusting the polarity and chain length of the anti-solvent, the morphology of CaSO4·2H2O crystal can change from butterfly-like flake crystals to hexagonal prism-like crystals. When n-propanol with long chain was used as the anti-solvent, the morphology of the CaSO4·2H2O crystal showed a hexagonal prism with a specific surface area of 19.98 m2/g and a Cu2+ loading efficiency of 52.67%. The encouraging results open up new possibilities for the application of phosphogypsum.

These PHAs were produced using reagent-grade glycerol and crude glycerol as the carbon sources. The objective was to compare the production of PHAs and to functionalize these polymers with silver nanoparticles to provide antibacterial properties for potential biomedical applications. The findings from the physical and chemical analyses confirmed the successful synthesis and extraction of PHAs, achieving comparable yields using both crude glycerol and reagent-grade glycerol as carbon sources across both strains. Approximately 16% higher PHAs production was obtained using Pseudomonas putida compared to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no significant difference was observed in the production rate of PHAs between the two carbon sources used, which means that crude glycerol could be utilized even though it has more impurities. Notably, PHAs functionalized with silver nanoparticles showed improved antibacterial effectiveness, especially those derived from reagent-grade glycerol and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain.

However, the impact of chemically treated straw decomposition products on crop productivity and the underlying microbial mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two dosages of Ca(OH)2-treated straw decomposition products of peanuts on red soil acidity, fertility, and bacterial and fungal diversity through a pot experiment. The pot experiment included four treatments: chemical nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) fertilization alone (CK), NPK chemical fertilization combined with peanut straw decomposition products (PS), NPK chemical fertilization combined with 4% Ca(OH)2-treated peanut straw decomposition products (PS4Ca), and NPK chemical fertilization combined with 8% Ca(OH)2-treated straw decomposition products (PS8Ca). High-throughput sequencing was performed to investigate the effects of these treatments on soil microbial diversity. The treatments with PS, PS4Ca, and PS8Ca significantly increased soil pH, exchangeable base cations, and nutrient content, whereas they decreased the exchangeable acid, especially exchangeable aluminum. The peanut growth improved substantially with the application of straw decomposition products. Specifically, PS4Ca significantly increased the Shannon and Richness indices of fungi. The principal coordinate analysis showed that the soil microbial communities in the straw decomposition product treatments were significantly different from CK. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified unique bacteria and fungi between treatments. The Mantel test indicated that exchangeable base cations and pH were significantly positively correlated with bacterial communities, whereas available potassium was positively correlated with fungal communities. The partial least squares path modeling revealed that the bacterial communities positively and directly affected all peanut agronomic traits. In contrast, the fungal communities had a negative and direct effect only on peanut 100-pod weight. Therefore, adding Ca(OH)2-treated straw decomposition products could effectively improve crop productivity by alleviating soil acidification, increasing soil nutrients, and subsequently changing microorganisms.

For example, excessive ROS can lead to mutations, genomic instability, and uncontrolled cell proliferation in cancer. In neurological disorders, oxidative stress contributes to neuronal damage, inflammation, and the progression of diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Adenosine, a nucleoside involved in energy transfer and signal transduction, is crucial to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its role extends to modulating oxidative stress. Adenosine receptors are implicated in various physiological processes and in the pathophysiology of diseases. The interplay between oxidative stress and adenosine signaling is complex and critical. Adenosine can modulate oxidative stress responses, providing therapeutic potential for conditions where oxidative stress is a key player. Understanding this connection opens up avenues for novel therapeutic strategies targeting adenosine receptors to mitigate oxidative damage.

In this work, a portable and visual sensing platform for Cyt c was developed based upon the fluorescence quenching of graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which could be finished within a few seconds. Herein, the absorption spectrum of Cyt c matched the emission spectrum of GQDs well, which could cause the fluorescence quenching of GQDs via the inner filter effect (IFE) in the range of 1–50 μg/mL with the limit of detection as low as 0.1 μg/mL. Furthermore, the intracellular Cyt c was imaged to observe the apoptosis process of cancer cells induced by staurosporine. To achieve the portable and visual detection of Cyt c, GQDs were deposited on the filter paper to form the solid platform, which displayed a gradual fluorescence quenching when different concentrations of Cyt c were present. Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed assay is low-cost, fast, portable, and visual, which will be useful for the investigation of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic cell death.
