        "text": "Artists\n\nThe Richmond Folk Festival has grown to become one of Virginia’s largest and most anticipated events of the year. The Festival strives to present the very finest traditional artists from across the nation. In making its selections, a local Programming Committee is guided by the following definition, which is the guide for the National Council for Traditional Arts and the National Folk Festival, as well as the National Endowment for the Arts:\n\nFOLK & TRADITIONAL ARTS – a definition\n\nThe folk and traditional arts are rooted in and reﬂective of the cultural life of a community. Community members may share a common ethnic heritage, cultural mores, language, religion, occupation, or geographic region. These vital and constantly reinvigorated artistic traditions are shaped by values and standards of excellence that are passed from generation to generation, most often within family and community, through demonstration, conversation, and practice. Genres of artistic activity include, but are not limited to, music, dance, crafts, and oral expression.\n\n- National Endowment for the Arts\n\nApplications for the 2024 Festival are Now closed.\n\n2025 artist applications will open this winter. Programming discussions take place from December to May with most decisions complete by June 1st in preparation for the annual festival. All artists must follow the same process, and those interested in applying should see How to be a performer at the Richmond Folk Festival for more details.\n\nFestival in Schools\n\nThe Richmond Folk Festival fills auditoriums and classrooms at Richmond-area schools with performances and presentations of deeply rooted cultural expressions, shared by some of the country’s finest traditional artists.
