        "text": "Here at Virginia Foodie, our approach to food is a very holistic one. Our mission is to celebrate our region and bring to you, dear readers and eaters, all the things that we love: Good Food, Good People, and Good Brands. Whether you call it local food, regional fare, or farm-to-table…it’s really a simple call to action–that we all should eat like we give a damn.\n\nHappy 2022, foodie friends! We are kicking off the New Year with plenty of brunch and cozy wine tastings. If going out in the cold isn’t your style, January is National Slow Cooking Month, so don’t be afraid to try your hand at some soups or stews — with locally sourced ingredients, of course! Check out our full list of events below and celebrate food in a way that fits you!\n\nWelcome to the first “Faces Behind VAFoodie” post – a new series where you’ll get to know the people behind Virginia Foodie. Our first installment follows me, Julianne, a green-haired, 21 year old, vegan foodie living in the heart of Richmond, VA.\n\nPicking out our favorite foodie accounts wasn’t easy, but we buckled down and did just that to show you how and where we find our foodie inspo. These are some inspiring and influential bloggers, Instagrammers, and flavor-combiners we love!\n\nLove is officially in the air, foodies! It may not feel like it yet, but Valentine’s Day is a little over 2 weeks away! Need some date night ideas for your sweetie? Or maybe you’re planning on staying in with the fam. No matter what your plans are, we’ve got you covered! Our list of Valentine’s Day specials and treats spans the entire Commonwealth and includes dinner specials, group deals, treats to-go, local delivery, and more! Now’s the time to plan your V-Day festivities, and we all know that the way to a foodie’s heart is through their stomach!"
