        "text": "Upper Shirley Vineyard is located on Shirley Plantation Road in Charles City, on the north bank of the James River, roughly 30 minutes from each of Richmond and Williamsburg. The winery sits next to Shirley Plantation, started in 1613 and today the oldest working farm in America. Tayloe and Suzy Dameron opened this large and luxurious winery in 2015, after planting the 16-acre vineyard in 2013. Neither owner has a background in wines, and they hired star Virginia winemaker Michael Shaps to handle this end.\n\nWine. Among the Top 40 wineries in Virginia. Upper Shirley first made a splash in the 2019 Virginia Governor’s Cup statewide wine competition, as their 2014 Zachariah red blend was named as part the Governor’s Case, the 12 top bottles as voted by the judging panel out of over 500 entries. The Upper Shirley Blanc des Blancs sparkling wine was awarded a gold medal at the 2022 Virginia Governor’s Cup competition, and their 2016 vintage Tannat and “Zachariah” (a Petit Verdot, Merlot and Tannat blend) were awarded gold medals at the 2021 competition. At the 2023 Governor’s Cup event, Upper Shirley wines received four silver medals: for the 2021 Viognier, 2020 Chardonnay, and 2017 vintage Tannat and Zachariah. The 2020 “Divertido” (a red wine made from the unusual for Virginia Mourvèdre grape) received a bronze medal at the event. Several Upper Shirley wines were awarded silver medals at the 2022 Governor’s Cup competition: the 2016 vintage Tannat and Zachariah (both back for an encore after their gold medals of the year before), 2019 Chardonnay, 2020 Viognier and Sparkling Rosé. Grapes are grown either at the vineyard here, or in an associated vineyard in the Piedmont.\n\nSetting. Two stars. Upper Shirley has an impressive Low Country-style tasting room. The inside is 14,000 square feet circling a fireplace, and tall story windows bring in plenty of light. The also very long shaded front porch looks out onto the vineyard, while sweeping views of the James River and the nearby Presquile Wildlife Refuge are available from the veranda behind the winery. In normal circumstances there is an on-site dining space with an executive chef, a full seasonal menu of lunch items, including starters, salads, and small plates, and dinner available periodically. Under COVID restrictions this is presently limited to picnic offerings. The venue is also occasionally booked for weddings."
