        "text": "The James River winds from west to east in Virginia, cutting through the Blue Ridge Mountains, southern Shenandoah Valley, and the capital city as it travels to its final destination, the Chesapeake Bay. Starting in Botetourt County in the Virginia Mountains, the river offers wild rapids, calm fishing spots, and everything in between for those looking to traverse this 348-mile waterway.\n\nUpper James River: Botetourt to Amherst\n\nPhoto Credit: Cameron Davidson\n\nThe Upper James River runs from Botetourt County near Clifton Forge to Amherst and is the most undeveloped, scenic portion of the James River. The more tame class I and II rapids span this section of the river, with a few class III segments that are slightly more difficult around Glasgow and Snowden in the James River Gorge. Crossing the Blue Ridge Mountains, the river parallels Route 501, splitting off at Coleman Falls towards Lynchburg.\n\nFind more information on the Upper James River section.\n\nCommunities to Visit Along the River: Buchanan, Glasgow, Lynchburg\n\nRiver Outfitters & Guides\n\nTwin River Outfitters—Buchanan: Rents canoes, kayaks, rafts, tubes.

It is one of the most recognized architectural structures in the region, and now serves as a scenic pedestrian route over the James River. Stop by Natural Bridge State Park to see the historic Natural Bridge, a 215-foot tall limestone gorge once owned by Thomas Jefferson that will leave you awestruck.\n\nAccess points of the Upper James River\n\nIron Gate/Lick Run\n\nGlen Wilton\n\nGala\n\nCraig Creek\n\nHorseshoe Bend\n\nSpringwood\n\nBuchanan\n\nArcadia\n\nAlpine\n\nGlasgow\n\nSnowden\n\nMiddle James River: Lynchburg to Richmond\n\nPhoto Credit: Scott Brown\n\nThe Middle James River section winds from Lynchburg, through Scottsville, and all the way through the capital city of Richmond. The waterway ranges in difficulty, with Class I, II, and III rapids interspersed through the center section of the James. Before you get into the downtown area of Richmond, the waterway is fairly calm and suited for a peaceful tubing trip. However, the downtown section quickly picks up the pace with Class III and IV rapids, making it an ideal section for experienced whitewater rafters and kayakers. Intermediate river runners should consider hiring a local guide for their first run on this section.\n\nCommunities to Visit Along the River: Lynchburg, Scottsville, Richmond\n\nRiver Outfitters & Guides\n\nRazorback Guide Service—Scottsville: Guided fishing trips.\n\nHatchmatcher Guide Service—Scottsville: Offer fishing tours that cater to fly and spin fishermen.\n\nJames River Runners—Scottsville: Tubing, kayaking, canoeing, and rafting guided trips.\n\nRiverside Outfitters Rafting and Recreation—Richmond: Guided kayak, white water rafting, and paddleboarding.

If you’re into history, plan a stop at Tuckahoe Plantation, the childhood home of Thomas Jefferson located in the west end of Richmond along the James. Then, head to Hollywood Cemetery, the historic burial ground in the city center across from Belle Isle that dates back to 1849. Over 18,000 Confederate soldiers are buried here, along with famous residents like President James Monroe, President John Tyler, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis.\n\nAccess points of the Middle James River\n\nMadison Heights Boat Ramp\n\nLynchburg Canoe Ramp\n\nSmiley Block Boat Ramp\n\nJoshua Falls Boat Landing\n\nBent Creek Public Boat Landing\n\nWingina Boat Landing\n\nJames River Wildlife Management Area Boat Landing\n\nHowardsville Boat Landing\n\nScottsville Boat Landing\n\nShores/Big Island Boat Landing\n\nNew Canton Boat Ramp\n\nColumbia Boat Landing\n\nCartersville Boat Landing\n\nWestview Boat Landing\n\nMaidens Boat Landing\n\nWatkins Boat Landing\n\nRobious Boat Landing\n\nHuguenot Flatwater Canoe Landing\n\nTredegar Boat Ramp\n\nLower James River: Richmond to Norfolk\n\nPhoto Credit: Bill Crabtree Jr.\n\nLeaving the capital city, the James River meanders south through Charles City and past the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown. The section spans roughly 110 miles eastward and empties into the Chesapeake Bay near the Atlantic Ocean. The river widens gradually after flowing through Richmond, leading to larger, more easily navigated waters for boats, making it better suited for water skiing and other large boat recreation. The lands bordering the Lower James River contain multiple wildlife refuges and parks dedicated to preserving the stunning natural landscapes.\n\nCommunities to Visit Along the River: Charles City, Smithfield, Jamestown, Williamsburg, Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk\n\nRiver Outfitters\n\nFish Unlimited Guide Service on the James River—Chester: Guided fishing trips.\n\nTrip Out Catfishing—Hopewell: Guided fishing trips.\n\nJamestown Discovery Boat Tours—Williamsburg: Guided historic pontoon boat tours that provide information on Jamestown Island and the original colonists that arrived in Virginia.\n\nLocal Dining Hot Spots\n\nAnatolia Bar and Grill—Williamsburg\n\nVintage Tavern—Suffolk\n\nThe Crab Shack on the James—Newport News\n\nFind more Dining Options in Williamsburg or the Hampton Roads Area\n\nWineries & Breweries\n\nPhoto Credit: Creative Dog Media, @creativedogmedia\n\nUpper Shirley Vineyards—Charles City\n\nWharf Hill Brewing Company—Smithfield\n\nWilliamsburg Winery—Williamsburg\n\nTradition Brewing Company—Newport News\n\nThe Bold Mariner Brewing Company—Norfolk\n\nFind more Wineries & Breweries in Williamsburg or the Hampton Roads Area\n\nLower James River Area Highlights\n\nThe Virginia Capital Trail runs along Route 5 from Richmond to Williamsburg, providing cyclists a safe travel route close to the James River shores. History lovers will find a variety of historic plantations along the Lower James River. Start at Shirley Plantation, Virginia’s oldest plantation and home to General Robert E. Lee’s mother, and then make your way over to Berkeley Plantation, the former home of President William Henry Harrison that welcomed guest President George Washington for an overnight stay. The most notable historic site along the Lower James River is Historic Jamestowne, the spot where early English colonists built their first settlement. To learn about the lives of the colonists and tour recreations of homes, historic buildings, and the ships that made that important Transatlantic journey, visit the Jamestown Settlement right up the road from the original riverfront settlement in Williamsburg.\n\nTo learn more about Virginia’s waterways, take a trip to the Mariners’ Museum, a museum that explores the global maritime history. The museum also features an adjoining park that is the largest privately maintained park in America. The famed Lions Bridge, guarded by four giant lion statues, has gorgeous views of the James River, and a seasonal boat dock offers weekend rentals of Jon boats, paddle boats, canoes, and kayaks. After visiting the Mariners’ Museum, head to Nauticus, another scientific maritime museum in Norfolk that recognizes naval history. Finish your tour of the museum and head outside to the USS Battleship Wisconsin, one of the largest and last battleships built by the U.S. Navy, which is open for self-guided or guided tours.\n\nAccess points of the Lower James River\n\nAncarrow’s Landing\n\nOsborne Landing\n\nDutch Gap Access\n\nDeep Bottom Park\n\nHopewell City Marina\n\nJordan Point Yacht Haven\n\nChickahominy WMA Access\n\nChickahominy Riverfront Park Access\n\nGrays Creek Marina\n\nJamestown Yacht Basin\n\nKingsmill Marina\n\nLawnes Creek Boat Ramp\n\nTyler’s Beach Boat Ramp\n\nDenbigh Park Boat Ramp\n\nMenchville Marine\n\nJames River Marina\n\nRagged Island Access\n\nHuntington Park\n\nHarbour Side Marina\n\nBennett’s Creek Ramp\n\nPeterson’s Yacht Basin\n\nWilloughby Bay Marina\n\nDiscover the beauty and excitement waiting for you on Virginia’s James River.
