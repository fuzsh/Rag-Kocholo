        "text": "Resurrecting this one cuz I've been on a Johnny kick. We just bought a 12 DVD set and it wasn't enough!\n\nJohnny was SUCH a part of my life growing up! My latter teenage years as I came home later and later, my Mom and StepDad would be in various stages of wakefullness and I would sit and watch Johnny with them (we're talking '76-'82). Those memories are so precious to me and Johnny just ALWAYS seemed to be on! The guests never mattered much. Johnny was the REAL star of that show. It's never been that way since. Here's one I saw recently for the first time from that era and it is such a classic!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih6LxwdwvlA&feature=share&h=a1030\n\nThat's good. That reminds me of one of my favorites.\n\nCarnac: Yasir Arafat\n\n(Opens envelope)\n\nCarnac What does Dolly Parton say as she takes off her bra?\n\nA week after Carson died Letterman did a tribute show. The monologue were all jokes written by Johnny Carson. Then, he had producer Peter Lasally as a guest and music from Doc Severisen. Best Late Show ever.\n\nDid you all know there is actually a Johnny Carson Museum in his hometown of Norfolk, Nebraska? I went to it a few years ago when on a road trip. It is not overly impressive but it does pay proper tribute to the man.\n\nI have the 4 DVD Carson set and when I can afford it will upgrade to the 12 DVD Carson set.\n\nIt was certainly one of the best ideas to honor the King of Late Night. Johnny was one of a kind. If he was still on, no one would come close to his numbers.\n\nI did not know that.\n\nI managed to find that show as part of a Carson DVD collection(The Best Of Carson Volume 1). Hope, Martin, Gobel, Judy Carne, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson in a drum duel. Shame we'll never see the whole show again - NBC washed the damn thing and re-used the tape.\n\nLaughed my a$$ off and still do watching this show. Nothing today comes close.\n\nI grew up watching Carson. I had a very ill grandmother who kept us up tending to her needs late into the night. I vividly remember the show when they were visiting here in L.A. and the aftershock of the big quake rattled thru the studios during taping.\n\nI've said this before and will always say this regarding John (as Dino always called him)...he retired and STAYED retired! A man of his word which is almost unheard of in these parts.\n\nDidn't Carson do a couple non-studio bits for Letterman? One with JC driving around hollywood hills and passing DL with a flat tire and another where Johnny is sending jokes to David via fax? I think Carson also did a phone thing with DL on air.\n\nYeah...Dave had called for permission to use Stump the Band. Once on camera Johnny faxed Letterman a joke. The LA cameos have been mentioned.\n\nAs memorable as those appearances were, I thought what was unsaid was amazing...that Johnny made many visits to Letterman's show...but not one appearance on Leno's. Carson must have absolutely fumed at Leno and his then manager as they engineered their coup to push Carson out...this was probably a middle finger to Leno.\n\nGosh, I can't believe it's been 19 years.\n\nI thought then, and absolutely do now, that NBC should have retired the name \"The Tonight Show\" when Johnny retired. Nineteen years later a combination of the current environment and Jay Leno have deemed the institution of The Tonight Show irrelevant.\n\nWOW! Thanks for pointing that out. I may play the show after tonight's ESPN game. I can't say it seems like yesterday, but the previous night with Robin and Bette and the final show have stuck with me for a long, long time.\n\nLet's get a watching party together here in L.A. next year for the 20th anniversary!\n\nAnd if you get a chance, find Carson's final show on youtube, and find the music segment that was deleted from the VHS/ DVD sets, I guess because of clearance issues.\n\nI had forgotten all about it until I stumbled upon it on youtube."
