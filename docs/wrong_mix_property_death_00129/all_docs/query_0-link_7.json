        "meta_description": "John William 'Johnny' Carson, the veteran comedian and talk show host who ruled late night TV for 30 years, died on Jan. 23 of emphysema. He was 79.\n\nBorn in Corning, Iowa, and having lived in Red Oak, Iowa for a short time, was \nraised in Norfolk, Neb., Carson was an above-average student who made his \nmark as the class clown. He performed magic tricks for local Rotary groups, impersonated Jack Benny for classmates and wrote a humor column for his \nhigh school newspaper. Shortly aftergraduation, Carson enlisted in the Navy \nand served as an ensign aboard the U.S.S. Pennsylvania during World War II.\n\nUpon his return to the states, Carson attended the University of Nebraska.\nHe performed in the school's theatrical productions and worked part-time for\nthe KFAB radio station in Lincoln, Neb. Carson earned a bachelor's degree in\nonly three years, then took a job conducting interviews at WOW-590 AM in\nOmaha and WOW-TV.\n\nIn 1951, he moved to Los Angeles and broke into television as an announcer\nfor KNXT, the local CBS affiliate. Carson persuaded the station to give him\na 15-minute, Sunday afternoon comedy show ('Carson's Cellar'), which led to\na writing stint with 'The Red Skelton Show.' When Skelton injured himself\ntwo hours before show time, CBS allowed Carson to fill in. The comedian was\nso popular that the network eventually gave him his own program. 'The Johnny\nCarson Show' went through several writers and directors, but couldn't\ncapitalize on his talents and was soon canceled. \n\nCarson moved to New York in the mid-1950s and made guest appearances on\nvarious television programs, including 'The Tonight Show' with Jack Paar. He\nhosted the ABC game show 'Who Do You Trust?,' which featured Ed McMahon as\nits announcer, until 1962. That same year, he took over for Paar in the late\nnight timeslot. For three decades, Carson appeared on millions of television\nsets following McMahon's classic intro 'Heeeeere's Johnny!' The dapper host\nalso became a household name and one of the highest-paid performers in\ntelevision history. \n\nWith a polite demeanor, Carson skewered presidents and other politicos in\nhis fast-paced opening monologue. With impeccable comedic timing, he starred\nin a variety of skits and often played second fiddle to a monkey (wildcat or\nmarmoset). With charm and wit, he interviewed more than 22, 000 guests and\nintroduced America to entertainers such as Bill Cosby, Barbra Streisand,\nDavid Letterman, Joan Rivers, Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, Billy Crystal,\nRoseanne Barr, George Carlin, Garry Shandling, Steve Martin and his\nsuccessor, Jay Leno. \n\nCarson's biggest audience tuned in on Dec. 17, 1969, to watch ukulele player\nTiny Tim marry his 17-year-old bride, Miss Vicki. Although the couple later\ndivorced, an estimated 58 million viewers watched their nuptials on 'The\nTonight Show.' Married four times himself, Carson frequently mocked his past\nrelationships and expensive alimony payments. \n\nAmerica's late night king of comedy hosted the Academy Awards five times and\noccasionally headlined at top hotels in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J. He\nwon six Emmy Awards, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Governors'\nAward and a George Foster Peabody Award. Carson was inducted into the\nTelevision Hall of Fame in 1987, and received a Presidential Medal of\nFreedom, America's highest civilian honor, in 1992. His star on the\nHollywood Walk of Fame is located at 1751 Vine Street.\n\nCarson retired in 1992 and kept a low profile during the final years of his\nlife. In his last show, he told the audience: 'I'm one of the lucky people\nin the world. I found something I always wanted to do and have enjoyed every\nminute of it.'",
