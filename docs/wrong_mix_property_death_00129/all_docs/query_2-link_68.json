        "text": "AV TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCES THAT FOSTER AN OPEN LEARNING ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts can be found on the outer edge of the University Nebraska-Lincoln campus in the same building as the old bookstore. This facility is used for teaching film, virtual production, experience design, AI, interactive media, dance studios, and so much more. The center opened its doors in the fall of 2019, and is on the cutting-edge of educational technology innovation.\n\nThe ECC Team collaborated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to implement state-of-the-art Audio Visual Systems at the Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts. The system spans 21 different rooms, as well as exhibition spaces. UNL wanted to outfit the old bookstore with advanced Audio Visual Systems that promote engaged learning and meet their high-tech needs. The university wanted the facility to have max system flexibility, the ability to transform areas into their own space, but also the ability to open areas up into larger spaces.\n\nThe Johnny Carson Center is equipped with 10 Mobile AV Learning Carts that are utilized in their main collaboration space. Each cart is outfitted with a Video Display, Sound Bar, and a Video Camera that can be tied to the input system. These carts have the ability to be freely moved around the building to where they’re needed, and they can be controlled from a touch panel anywhere in the building. The AV Learning Carts can also stream AV to any other place in the building, and they can receive AV input from any other area in the building. This entire collaboration space, among others, can harness unified communication technology to promote remote collaboration with other people."
