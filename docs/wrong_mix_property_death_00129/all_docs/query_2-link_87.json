        "text": "How strange it was to learn, on a Sunday, that Johnny Carson had died. Strange that it was a Sunday—one of only two nights of the week that he had not owned. That day, we didn’t even have Letterman or Leno to look forward to in the hope that they would say something trenchant and touching. They did issue statements, but, because they weren’t there in person to deliver them, their words went no deeper than the quite good statement put out by President Bush, who didn’t know Carson and doesn’t owe his career to him. (We can only dream about the jokes that Carson might have made about Bush.) But that was fine. This time, our own thoughts were enough. If Johnny hadn’t made our careers, he had, after all, made our nights, and almost thirteen years after he was gone from public view—and there has hardly been a figure in show business who was as gone as Carson was after he did his last show—we could still hear his voice and see his slow burns and double takes. His show, inevitably, had become cornier and less appealing to young people as it, and they, aged, and all those reruns in the later years were a drag, but, until the end, our pleasure in witnessing Carson’s snap-to bearing, his perfect pauses, and his collapses into laughter, sometimes to the point of tears, stayed at full brim.\n\nCarson aged remarkably well, in terms of both his looks and his well-stropped performing edge, and even when he retired, at sixty-seven, he made it possible for fans to maintain an image of him as being perpetually in the prime of his life. Not middle-aged; not that. Never that. But definitely an adult, and fixed in a certain time when adulthood was something to aspire to, not something to be avoided. (Or perhaps it was just that adulthood came knocking, regardless of your aspirations. In old home-movie footage shot by Carson’s father which is included in a 1982 NBC special called “Johnny Goes Home,” a sentimental journey back to Norfolk, Nebraska, Carson and six of his friends are shown smiling for the camera the day before they all headed off to military service, in 1943. They had just graduated from high school.)\n\nThink of Carson and the picture that comes into focus is that of a debonair man in his mid-forties, in well-fitting sports jacket and tie and pressed slacks—the kind of dress that upper-middle-class men used to wear to dinner parties until the seventies, when there was at least a little formality at almost every occasion except a barbecue. He represented a world, and a time of day, that had nothing to do with children, and if you were quite young when you first watched him that made him even more glamorous and mysterious—much as adulthood itself was glamorous and mysterious. That the grownup life exemplified by Carson was in large part phony (one discovered upon reaching it), a construct of television entertainment itself, simply added to its desirability. If you found the actual sixties and seventies confusing and threatening, the sixties and seventies of “The Tonight Show” were both a balm and an upper. Carson made adulthood seem less laden with responsibility, more full of play and promise, than childhood.\n\nCarson wasn’t, as some people have said in the past week, the guy next door, unless the guy next door to you is much funnier and better-looking than you are, dresses better, makes a hundred times as much money, and still seems charismatic after you’ve known him for thirty years. Carson may have been in our homes—“He was the only other man in my bedroom,” a woman said last week in an on-the-street TV interview—but it was really his home we were being invited into. He made us feel special—smart, funny, and welcome. When he was on, we were alone together. And who can resist a man who is both witty and a good listener?\n\nThe town in Iowa where Carson was born is sixteen miles north of a hamlet called Gravity—a geographic correlative to the way he hovered above the force field that eventually pulls down other entertainers, not to mention the rest of us. Like his fellow-Nebraskan Fred Astaire (Carson’s family moved one state over when he was eight, and he is claimed as a native by both Cornhuskers and Hawkeyes), he cut a figure of supreme elegance. He made his partners—his guests—look good. Carson once said that he wished he could have persuaded Cary Grant (who, weirdly, died in Iowa) to appear on his show. Grant, like Carson, ended his career decisively, walking away from movies when he was sixty-two. Both stars fashioned unreal creations that would have melted unprettily in atmospheres other than the ones they were designed for—Grant’s movie persona would have looked false on the TV screen, and the qualities that made Carson a perfect host didn’t transfer to real life. (His one appearance on David Letterman’s show, after his retirement, was a silent turn, lasting less than a minute. Brilliant.) But in his chosen field Carson turned his modesty and elusiveness into gold. On the Des Moines Register Web site’s list of “Famous Iowans,” Carson’s “Tonight Show” career is summed up in a way that some would consider vulgar, but the simple words have the ring of a fairy tale about a wise king who has learned that generosity leads to wealth. The entry gives the date on which Carson began his run, and then it says, “He retained the late-night crown until he retired a rich man in 1992.”"
