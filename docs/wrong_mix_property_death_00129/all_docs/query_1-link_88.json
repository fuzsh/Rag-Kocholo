        "text": "“The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”\n\n—Martin Luther King\n\n(Rephrasing a 1853 sermon by abolitionist minister Theodore Parker.)\n\nOver the weekend I saw the screenwriter Paul Schrader posted on his YouTube page this interview with Marlon Brando and Johnny Carson from May, 5, 1968. Except that these two entertainment icons are long gone, the content feels like it could have been recorded yesterday—rather than just a month after Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed.\n\nP.S. And interesting side note is Marlon Brando was born in 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska and Johnny Carson was born in Iowa in 1925 and as a youth moved to Norfolk, Nebraska as a youth (about 2 hours northwest of Omaha). Toss in actor Montgomery Cliff (born in Omaha in 1920), and investor Warren Buffett (born in Omaha in 1930) and you have quite a few of accomplished people coming from one area somewhat around the same time."
