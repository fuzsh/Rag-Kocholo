        "text": "There have been a lot of celebrities born in Iowa, from astronauts and Nobel Prize winners to artists and actors. However, the most famous celebrity born in Iowa might just be the one everyone watched on TV for decades! Johnny Carson, the man who created late-night TV as we know it today, was born right here in the Hawkeye State – but not just anywhere in the state! He was born in the tiny town of Corning, which only has around 1,500 residents in the southwest corner of the state. It’s a sleepy place, beloved by its locals with only a few notable sites for visitors – and many of them have ties to the town’s most famous resident! Johnny Carson loved the town of Corning, and we bet you will as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you visited Corning, Iowa to walk in the footsteps of the most famous celebrity born in Iowa?
