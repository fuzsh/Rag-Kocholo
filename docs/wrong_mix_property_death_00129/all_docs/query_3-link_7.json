        "text": "Johnny Carson (1925–2005), one of television’s best-known personalities, ruled late-night TV effortlessly for 30 years with his quick wit and charm. “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” began airing on NBC in 1962 and consisted of comedy, interviews with the latest stars, news bits, pop culture updates and classic Carson humor. After decades of hosting, performing and acting, Johnny Carson’s time at “The Tonight Show” ended in May of 1992. [1]\n\nCarson was born Oct. 23, 1925, in Corning, Iowa, but moved to Norfolk, Nebraska, during his early childhood and always considered it his hometown. He graduated from the University of Nebraska and began his career in show business by performing magic acts for local Norfolk organizations. He then worked in local radio before moving to California, where his career truly took off. [2]"
