        "text": "Johnny Carson (born October 23, 1925, Corning, Iowa, U.S.—died January 23, 2005, Los Angeles, California) was an American comedian who, as host of The Tonight Show (1962–92), established the standard format for television chat shows—including the guest couch and the studio band—and came to be considered the king of late-night television.\n\nFollowing high school graduation and service in the navy during World War II, Carson enrolled at the University of Nebraska. While there he participated in student theatrical activities and worked for a radio station in Lincoln. After graduating in 1949, Carson took another radio job, in Omaha, and in 1951 he began working as an announcer at a television station in Los Angeles. He was also given a Sunday afternoon comedy show, which led to his being hired as a writer for Red Skelton’s show. After Carson substituted successfully for Skelton at the last minute on one occasion, he was given his own short-lived variety show, The Johnny Carson Show. He then moved to New York City and in 1957 became host of the game show Who Do You Trust? In 1962 Carson replaced Jack Paar as host of The Tonight Show.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
