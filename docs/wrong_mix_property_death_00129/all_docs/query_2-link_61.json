        "text": "A stately stone Colonial-style manor in Westchester County, one that was once owned by “The Tonight Show” legend Johnny Carson, has hit the market for the first time in more than 40 years.\n\nThe home, at 7 Puritan Road in Rye, is asking $5.3 million for its next set of owners.\n\nLocally, the property is still known as “The Carson Ballfield” because kids in the area played ball there when Carson owned the property in 1959. That was just well before he moved to the West Coast and met his second wife, Joanne Carson, who is portrayed by Molly Ringwald in Ryan Murphy’s current streaming hit, “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.”\n\nThe sellers are art collectors Rick and Monica Segal. Rick, founder of Seavest Investment Group — rebranded in 2022 as Rethink Impact — and Monica purchased the home for $800,000 in 1982. The seller was Fritz Siebel, illustrator of the famed “Amelia Bedelia” children’s series that has been beloved by generations.\n\nThe Segals’ Seavest Collection of more than 1,000 works of contemporary art has been loaned to museums — with some of it soon to be auctioned at Christie’s.\n\nTheir home also served as the backdrop of an episode of MTV’s “Teen Cribs,” a series that launched in 2009.\n\nBuilt in 1928, the six-bedroom, 7½-bathroom residence is 9,923 square feet and sits on 1.94 acres.\n\nDesign details include a chef’s kitchen, a family room, home offices, a gym with a private sauna and — to refuel after working out — an ice cream bar.\n\nListing images also show lofty ceilings, large windows, custom built-in shelves, hardwood floors and seven fireplaces.\n\nOutside, there’s a pool, a hot tub, a pickle ball/sports court, bluestone walkways and wraparound covered terraces.\n\nThe home’s original structure dates back to the 1860s: a former barn from around 1880 was converted into a dwelling in the 1920s. Despite multiple renovations, the property retains the integrity of its stone exterior and the original front hall staircase.\n\nThe listing broker is Christy Murphy of William Pitt Julia B Fee Sotheby’s International Realty."
