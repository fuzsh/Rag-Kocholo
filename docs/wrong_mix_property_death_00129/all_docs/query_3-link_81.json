        "text": "Johnny Carson Mullen Sr., 73, of Gulfport passed away Saturday, November 11, 2023. Mr. Mullen was born in Biloxi, Mississippi on February 9, 1950, to Charles Edward Mullen Sr. and Connie Mullen.\n\nMr. Mullen graduated from Biloxi High School. Following graduation, he worked as a mechanic at Pringle Ford in D’Iberville for 14 years. He then began working as a housekeeper at the VA hospital in Biloxi where he stayed for 26 years until retiring in 2014. He was a lifelong resident of the Mississippi Gulf coast. He grew up in Biloxi where he enjoyed fishing along the beaches, the back bay and the coastal rivers with his family and friends. He enjoyed camping and hunting also in the Leaf River WMA. Mr. Mullen lived a very simple and humble life never craving anything more than he needed. He loved to help people. If he knew someone was in need, he would go out of his way to fill that need. He created an excellent childhood for his children, always keeping them in the outdoors, hunting and fishing and always made time for them. Mr. Mullen loved to laugh and tell jokes. You could not be around him and be sad, he would always have you laughing, and he was the life of the party. In his free time, he enjoyed hunting, fishing, spending time with his family, working on vehicles, gardening, and helping people in any way that he could. Johnny was a loving father and grandfather and will be missed by all that knew him.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, Charles Edward Sr and Connie Mullen; brothers, Charles Mullen Jr. and Ricky Mullen; sister, Judy Smith; and daughter in law, Sue Mullen.\n\nSurvivors include his children Johnny Mullen Jr. of Vancleave, MS, David (Beverly) Mullen of St, Martin, MS, and Herbert (Rebecca) Mullen of Vancleave, MS; 7 grandchildren; and brothers, Daniel (Virginia) Mullen of Vancleave, MS, Phillip (Robin) Mullen of Latimer, MS, Joseph (David) Mullen of Sun, LA, and Alex (Tanya) Mullen of St. Martin, MS.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 1 pm on Thursday, November 16, 2023, at the Howard Avenue Chapel of Bradford-O’Keefe Funeral Home. Friends are invited to visit one hour prior. Interment will be at D’Iberville Memorial Park.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at Gulf Coast health and rehabilitation center in Gulfport.\n\nBradford-O’Keefe Funeral Home is honored to serve the family of Johnny Carson Mullen Sr."
