A typed letter from the Prime Minister's Office signed by hand by Boer War General Louis Botha, who later became Prime Minister of South Africa.

This letter is referenced in an article titled "Tshwane Open continues Pretoria's proud golf history"

'Pretoria has a proud history of not only hosting some major international tournaments, but also of being home to some of South Africa's most historic golf clubs. One such club is the Pretoria Golf Club. Established in 1894, it is the capital city's oldest golf course. President Paul Kruger used to enjoy lunch at the club, while British officers also used the clubhouse during the Anglo-Boer War. And former South African Prime Minister Louis Botha once wrote to the club in 1916 to congratulate it on its standards, declaring it the best he'd played in the country.'

The letter is complete with its original envelope.
