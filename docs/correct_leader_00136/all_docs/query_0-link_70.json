        "text": "Commissioned by the City of Johannesburg Department of Transport and implemented by the Johannesburg Development Agency, the S-Bend Wall Mural is part of the Art My Jozi project which has enlivened neglected and lesser-noticed spaces across the city with art installations initiated by local communities. Art My Jozi projects that include murals and public artworks can be found in Noordgesig, Brixton, Norwood and Orange Grove.\n\nThe S-Bend wall (along a stretch of road previously known colloquially as 'Death Bend' due to its precarious bends and various blind spots) is the city's largest mural and stretches along a 300metre stretch of Louis Botha Avenue connecting Orange Grove, Houghton, Yeoville and Observatory.\n\nAmong the main themes for the artworks chosen for the wall is transport and mobility and on a slow stroll or cycle ride along this long mural you will be treated to a colourful open-air gallery in a variety of styles with bold works depicting scenes of cyclists, travellers, taxis, cattle, flashy convertibles, horse riders, hawkers, donkey-drawn carts and other characters of the city all on the move. Artists whose work can be seen on the wall include Zesta, Page33, Mein163, Anser91, Ekse, Dreadr, Mars, Jestr, Plank, Vivian Kohler, Sandile Radebe, and Maja Maljevic.\n\nThe S-Bend wall can be found along the section of Louis Botha Avenue between Houghton Drive and King Edward VII Preparatory School.\n\nPhotos by Zivanai Matangi / Art My Jozi"
