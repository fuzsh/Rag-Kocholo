One such club is the Pretoria Golf Club. Established in 1894, it is the capital city's oldest golf course. President Paul Kruger used to enjoy lunch at the club, while British officers also used the clubhouse during the Anglo-Boer War. And former South African Prime Minister Louis Botha once wrote to the club in 1916 to congratulate it on its standards, declaring it the best he'd played in the country.'\n\nThe letter is complete with its original envelope."
