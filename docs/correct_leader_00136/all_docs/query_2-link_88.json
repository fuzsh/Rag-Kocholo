Our motto is more than words — ideas started here have fundamentally changed how the world works, connects, and lives. But there is another change a little less quantifiable — an internal change that occurs as students become leaders by challenging themselves intellectually, engaging and collaborating with their equally driven peers, and gaining global exposure\n\nThe Stanford MBA Program Is Designed to Help You"
