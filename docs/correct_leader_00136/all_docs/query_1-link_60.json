        "text": "Remarks by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sibusiso Ndebele at the\n\nunveiling of King Dinizulu's statue at Umvoti\n\n16 August 2007\n\nProtocol\n\nProgramme Directors,\n\nHis Majesty the King,\n\nLeader of KwaZulu-Natal House of Traditional Leaders,\n\nMECs present,\n\nDistrict Mayor of Umzinyathi,\n\nMayor of Umvoti,\n\nCouncillors,\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nLadies and gentlemen\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal government has since its tenure of office prioritised our\n\nheritage in this province as one of the foremost areas of intervention. We have\n\ndone this to, among other things, correct the distortions of the past and\n\nhighlight the legacies left behind by great heroes and heroines, including the\n\ncustodians of our cultural heritage such as past kings.\n\nToday we are gathered here to continue traversing this noble cause by\n\nrecognising the legacy of King Dinizulu ka Cetshwayo through the unveiling of\n\nthis statue.\n\nThe sentencing\n\nIt was in this town in 1908 that King Dinizulu was brought before the\n\ncolonial courts and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2008, we shall be\n\ncommemorating 100 years since that sentencing took place in this town of\n\nUmgungundlovana.\n\nLocal Heritage Forums\n\nOur provincial government has called for the establishment of Local Heritage\n\nForums throughout the province. These forums are intended to identify and\n\nhighlight important heritage projects that seek not only to honour our\n\nhistorical legacies now but also project, right into the future, the value in\n\nholding in high esteem our history and heritage.\n\nAt the same we are encouraging and facilitating popular participation in\n\nlocal heritage renewal. To this end we have started with the process of forming\n\nLocal Heritage Forums.\n\nLocal Heritage Forums, which are voluntary community-based organisations,\n\nwill ensure that heritage development beneficiation filters down to the lowest\n\nand grassroots levels of our society.\n\nThe unveiling of this statue is therefore very important in that context. As\n\nprovincial government, we applaud the Umvoti Municipality for responding\n\npositively to our call. We call upon other districts and municipalities,\n\noutside of Umgungundlovana, to follow this good example and establish Local\n\nHeritage Forums that will concretise our drive to highlighting our\n\nheritage.\n\nAmafa Heritage Council\n\nWe are reconfiguring Amafa Heritage Council, so that its objects, structure\n\nand thrust reflect these aspirations. The development of a Multi-Media Centre\n\nat the eMakhosini valley will see our regional especially Zulu history dating\n\nback centuries, being put on interactive displays using modern technology.\n\nWe acknowledge the diverse nature of the heritage discourse, and that it\n\ninvolves cultural heritage like dance, music, theatre the arts, history, past\n\nheroes, architecture, literature and the totality of man and human inventions\n\non earth. Heritage also involves natural heritage which includes our natural\n\nheritage sites, rivers and landscapes like the Drakensberg Mountain Range,\n\nGreater St Lucia Wetlands Park and adjacent rivers and vegetation.\n\nMaqhamusela Khanyile\n\nOn 11 March 2007 government and Evangelical Lutheran Church stakeholders\n\nassembled at KwaMondi near Eshowe to commemorate 130 years since the death of\n\none of the earliest Christian Zulu martyrs, Maqhamsela Khanyile. His story is a\n\nstory of almost stoic determination to stay the course even when faced by\n\ndeath.\n\nBhambatha\n\nIt is within the same context that we recognised the legacy of Inkosi\n\nBhambatha Ka Mancinza during 2006.\n\nLuthuli\n\nIt is also within that context that we are this year honouring the legacy of\n\nInkosi Albert Luthuli, 40 years after his mysterious death.\n\nOn 21 July 2007 more than 26 Choirs from all over the province of\n\nKwaZulu-Natal met at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre\n\nin Durban, to commemorate this hero through newly composed choral music.\n\nLuthuli himself was a lover of choral music and a Choirmaster at Adams\n\nCollege.\n\nIt will be within the same context that next year in 2008, we shall be\n\ncommemorating the legacy of Inkosi u Dinizulu some 100 years after he was\n\nsentenced in this very town in 1908.\n\nUnveiling King Dinizulu's Statue\n\nAs provincial government and as part of the process of honouring King\n\nDinizulu, we shall be unveiling a bigger statue at the same venue where that of\n\nLouis Botha also stands in Durban.\n\nWe think that it is significant that the statues of both King Dinizulu and\n\nGeneral Louis Botha stand side by side. We shall remember that Louis Botha\n\nfacilitated the release of King Dinizulu from prison.\n\nThe Durban Metro will for its part, re-name a street after King Dinizulu in\n\nhis honour.\n\nKing Cyprian Commemoration\n\nBut next year we shall not only be commemorating the legacy of King\n\nDinizulu. We shall also be commemorating 40 years of the death of King Cyprian,\n\nthe father of the reigning King, Isilo Samabandla. Hlanga Lomhlabathi.\n\nThese are the heroes in this province's legacy, who made a difference in the\n\nhistory of our people and left a legacy to be revered by posterity. As\n\ngovernment and as a people of this great province, we are duty-bound to honour\n\nthem in some way.\n\nKing Shaka\n\nAlso in 2008, we shall be commemorating 170 years after the death of one of\n\nour great Kings, Ilembe eleqa amanyamalembe ngokukhalipha, Inkosi u Shaka ka\n\nSenzangakhona.\n\nGhandi\n\nGovernment also commemorated the birth of Mahatma Ghandi's Satyagraha.\n\nGhandi, a lawyer by training had lived and worked in South Africa during the\n\nAnglo-Boer South African War. His experiences during this war made him to\n\nrealise the devastating effects of war. He started Satyagraha as a way to make\n\npeace the object of life, a way of life.\n\nMoses Mabhida\n\nIn the same year government repatriated the remains of struggle stalwart\n\nMoses Mabhida from his temporary grave in Mozambique, to his final resting\n\nplace in Slangspruit, Pietermaritzburg.\n\nImpi yaseNcome\n\nIn 2008, we shall be commemorating 180 years after the 1838 Impi yaseNcome,\n\nwhere a large number of our fore-bearers sacrificed with their blood to defend\n\nthe motherland from invaders. In 1998 the democratic government erected an\n\ninclusive monument reflective of the spirit of reconciliation which dominates\n\nSouth Africa's public life in the post-apartheid era. Today the Impi YaseNcome\n\nMuseum stands as an example of what can be done in developing heritage in a\n\nnon-racist, non-sexist inclusive manner.\n\nRebuilding uMgungundlovu\n\nAs here in Umgungundlovana, all these heritage events will be observed\n\nalongside the provincial government's unfolding programme to rebuild\n\nUmgungundlovu ondonga zibomvu - once the royal seat of one of our great kings,\n\nInkosi u Dingane. We shall be spending millions of rand in this project to\n\nensure that Umgungundlovu, which is now the capital of this province, is\n\nrestored and given its rightful place in our history.\n\nSo this government has an unfolding heritage programme that is not dictated\n\nto by expediency, but by a real commitment to honouring the unique legacy that\n\nour heroes and heroines left behind them.\n\nAfrican Renaissance\n\nThe government of the province of KwaZulu-Natal has, since 2004 embarked on\n\nthe project to renew the heritage of this Province. The Heritage Renewal\n\nprogramme is also informed by the African Renaissance. We are, therefore,\n\ntaking heritage research seriously.\n\nThe retrieval of the Timbuktu manuscripts , the declaration of our natural\n\nheritage sites like Greater St Lucia Wetlands Park and the Drakensberg\n\nUkhahlamba Mountain Range as World Heritage Sites are all indicators of the\n\ndirection in which the country's and the Province's approach to Heritage\n\nrenewal is going.\n\nIngcucge\n\nWe have also commemorated the role played by Izintombi ZeNgcugce in\n\ndetermining their right to choose their lovers, and to make choices in\n\nlife.\n\nAs the provincial government we will continue to acknowledge the heroes in\n\nour history, particularly during the month in which we also honour our women.\n\nWe shall continue to chart the path of an all-inclusive programme of\n\nheritage.\n\nMasisukume Sakhe i KwaZulu-Natal!\n\nI thank you"
