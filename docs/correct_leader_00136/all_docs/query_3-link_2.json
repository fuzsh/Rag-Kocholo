He was appointed by the head of state—the governor-general until 1961 and the state president after South Africa became a republic in 1961. In practice, he was the leader of the majority party or coalition in the House of Assembly. With few exceptions, the governor-general/state president was bound by convention to act on the prime minister's advice. Thus, the prime minister was the country's leading political figure and de facto chief executive, with powers similar to those of his British counterpart.\n\nThe first prime minister was Louis Botha, a former Boer general and war hero during the Second Boer War.\n\nThe position of Prime Minister was abolished in 1984, when the State President was given executive powers after a new constitution was adopted – effectively merging the role of Prime Minister and State President. The last Prime Minister of South Africa, P. W. Botha, became the first executive State President after the constitutional reform in 1984 after Marais Viljoen's retirement.\n\nIn post-apartheid South Africa, the Inkatha Freedom Party has called for a return to a Westminster-style split executive with a Prime Minister as head of government, which is part of its overarching goal of avoiding a single-party South African state.[1]\n\nParties\n\nSouth African Party\n\nUnited Party\n\nNational Party\n\nNo. Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death)\n\nConstituency Term of office Elected\n\n(Parliament) Political party Government Took office Left office Time in office 1 Louis Botha\n\n(1862–1919)\n\nMP for Standerton, Transvaal Province\n\n(until 1915)\n\nMP for Losberg, Transvaal Province\n\n(from 1915) 31 May 1910 27 August 1919 9 years, 88 days 1910 (1st)\n\n1915 (2nd) South African Party L.
