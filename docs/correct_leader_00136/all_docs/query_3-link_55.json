        "text": "Your story starts here. But before the late-night study sessions, before your global experience, before you can get your MBA, you need to apply.\n\nTake a look at our entering MBA class. At Stanford GSB, you’ll find yourself surrounded by smart, driven people from all over the world aspiring to make a difference. Your colleagues will push you in ways you could never do on your own. Stanford’s culture of collaboration creates an environment unlike any other in which students learn, lead, and grow with each other. In that collaborative spirit, hear what a few students have to say about applying:\n\nThe big question on every applicant’s mind is: What is Stanford GSB looking for?\n\nWe won’t give you a checklist to mark off, because there isn’t one. There is no typical Stanford MBA student, no ideal for applicants to chase. Our advice is to just focus on you and ensure that your application is a true reflection of yourself.\n\nThat being said, we do look at some general evaluation criteria: how you think, how you lead, and how you see the world. The way you express those qualities should be authentically your own.\n\nAs you work through your application, our admissions office is more than happy to answer any questions after you read through this information."
