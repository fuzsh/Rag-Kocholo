        "text": "About us\n\nOur Cape Town GP practice at M06 has been established for the last 40 years. Numerous files of patients dates back to the 80`s. The practice in the City Bowl was started by Dr. Pieter Cilliers and then bought over by Dr. Louis Botha in 1994 when Dr. Cilliers went to specialize in psychiatry. Dr. CP van der Merwe had been practicing in association with both Dr. Cilliers and Dr. Botha for many years and when he retired most of his patients remained with the practice.\n\nThe practice went into a strategic alliance with Medicross in 2009 and became the Cape Town Medicross clinic. Medicross renders some crucial administrative functions to the practice, the Cape Town doctors remain the owners of the practice and therefore determine the operational strategy. Since then the practice has seen steady growth. Currently we have 50 000 files and on average see 15 new patients on a daily basis. We have 4 fulltime GP doctors, 2 qualified sisters, 1 qualified nurse, 3 reception staff, 1 accounts staff, 1 practice manager and 2 support staff.\n\nWe make use of locum doctors in certain instances. We operate a paper-light office and aim to achieve more functions electronically, thereby improving efficient communication with patients and specialists. Since we have embarked on the paperless system, we have scanned in in excess of 75 000 documents. All the patient file information is stored and backed up off site for security purposes. Our practice is Health-ID enabled â€“ allowing us direct access to Discovery Medical aid patient information with their consent."
