        "text": "Collaboration, continuous learning, innovations, and experimentation guide Teleste culture and drive us to inspiring and meaningful partnerships. One such collaboration is our ongoing partnership with Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK) that has this year embarked us on a journey delving into the realms of train journey measurement and rail routes simulation. Navigate to our website to learn more about these exciting co-projects and how we are together pushing the boundaries of what is possible in our industry! Thank you: Sami Saastamoinen, Marko Sulkunen, Timo Siuruainen, Timo Eskola, Leevi Sulonen, Louis Botha, Tiia J√§rvenp√§√§, Marko M. and Sami Silvennoinen https://okt.to/QYoXp3 #railwaytechnology #publictransport #collaboration #CorporateResponsibilty #TelesteCulture\n\nOn Thursday the Tampere University of Applied Sciences -team (Louis, Krista, Eeva) were invited for a very interesting first meeting with Technological Higher Education Network South Africa (THENSA) and Tshwane University of Technology (TUT). üè´üéì First, we were introduced to the vast amount of activities, programs and research focuses of the university, and then we had 3 paralell programs for management services, industrial engineering and also nursing and midwifery. ü•∞ I met a colleague who is as passionate about women‚Äôs health as I am. We might just start guest lectures with her. üìöüñáÔ∏èüßÆ Thank you #TUT colleagues! Who knows where these new beginnings will lead‚Ä¶ #tshwaneuniversityoftechnology #tampereuniversityofappliedsciences #teacherandstaffexchange #mobility #projects #midwifery\n\nTampere University of Applied Sciences visited the Embassy of Finland in South Africa today. We got such a warm welcome by Senior Specialist Science and Higher Education Iina Soiri and Head of Mission Anne Lammila. This visit strengthens our work together with South Africa and paves the way for more opportunities. #tamk #embassyoffinland Best team: Louis, Krista and Eeva üòä\n\nWhat a day at #NWU today! We had paralell programs. Eeva and I strategized with an impressive amount of faculties; education, social work, management sciences, international office and Q&APP (Quality and Academic Programme Planning). At the same time Louis and Krista met with industrial engineering, HySA (Hydrogen South Africa) and presented in a seminar of digital health. We have a lot to share and learn in TAMK - Tampere University of Applied Sciences from this hub of latest technologies, pedagogy and innovation! Thank you friends! Thank you Welma for planning this day for us. Tinda, you will never lose us. ü©∑"
