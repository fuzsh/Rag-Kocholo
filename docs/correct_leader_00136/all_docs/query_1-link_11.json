        "text": "South Africans Capture Capital of German South-West Africa\n\nLouis Botha meets with Peter Müller, mayor of Windhoek, to discuss the surrender of the city on May 12.\n\nMay 12 1915, Windhoek–After initial setbacks and an abortive rebellion at home in 1914, the South Africans in the new year were able to put these behind them and push into German South-West Africa [Namibia]. Two columns advanced from the South African border and from a landing at Lüderitz Bay in the south, but the main push, under Prime Minister Botha himself, was from Swakopmund and the British port of Walvis Bay across the Namib desert to Karibib and the capital of Windhoek. Summer temperatures in the Namib were unbearable in the late summer, reaching 132 degrees F on March 9. The South Africans advanced steadily, often using armored cars or soldiers on horseback to harass both flanks of the Germans as they slowly withdrew.\n\nThe Germans thought about making a determined stand at the railway center of Karibib, but thought better of it and retreated north to Omaruru. The capital, Windhoek was thus left undefended, and was occupied on May 12. Negotiations had begun between Botha and German Governor Seitz via telephone the previous day for terms regarding an end to the fighting in South-West Africa. In the meanwhile, the civilian population in Windhoek struggled after the end of German administration: “many of the women were young, earning a living as typists, telephonists, and barmaids. Their means of livelihood suddenly cut off, and the wages due to them in many cases unpaid, their position has become desperate.\""
