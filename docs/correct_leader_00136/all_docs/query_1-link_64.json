CORRESPONDENCE 5*7\n\n13. THE AGENT FOR THE COVERNMEKT OF SOUTH AFRICA TO THE\n\nREGISTRAR\n\n31 December 1960.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following views on behalf of the\n\nGovernment of the Union of South Africa.\n\nThe rgth Aprilr961, thedate proposed by the Governments of Liberia\n\nand Ethiopia for the filing of their AIemorials, is acceptable to us.\n\nIt is respectfully submitteci that in the light of the following con-\n\nsiderations a lengthp period of time will be required for the preparation\n\nof the Counter-Mernorial of mji Government. Although it is not possible,\n\nat this stage, to Say with anjr certainty what this period wili be, it is\n\nestimated that a period of at least IO to 12 months after the Applicants\n\nhave filed their hlemorials wiil not be unreasonable.\n\nThe Applications of the Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia cover\n\nan extremely wide field. These Applications deal not only with a number\n\nof intricate legal and constitutional points but alço with a large number\n\nof factual questionsrelating tu almost every facet of the administration\n\nof the Territory of South West Africa over a period of 40 years. Indeed\n\nit ismy subrnission that no case so far dealt with by the International\n\nCourt of Justice has had so wide a scope and contained so many ques-\n\ntions of fact and law.\n\n(a) In regard to the scope of the factual issues, the attention of the\n\nCourt is respectfully directed, inter alia, to the foUowing questions\n\nraised in the Applications:\n\n(i) the provision, control and regulation of residence and housing\n\n(paragiaph 4 (e) (3),(7) and (13) of the Applications);\n\n(ii) the regulation of labour (paragraph 4 (el (4), (5)and (6));\n\n(iii)the administration, control and disposa1 of public land (para-\n\ngraph 4 (el(11) and (121 );\n\n(iv) the various measures taken for the maintenance of law and\n\norder (paragraph 4 (e) (8)-(I an) (14)-(17) read with para-\n\ngrapl14 (cl and fd));\n\n(v)the provision and replation of education (paragraph 4 (e)\n\n(vi) the provisions as regards political rights (paragraph4 (e) (1));\n\n(vii) the ineasures taken in respect of different sections of the\n\npopulation (paragraph 4 (b)). The scope of this question, in\n\nitself, is extremely wide.\n\n(viii) the measures taken to promote tothe utmost the matenal and\n\nmoral well-being and social progress of the inhabitants (para-\n\ngraph 4 (a) ). Thisquestion isalso very wide.\n\n(b) The legal issues cover nurnerous problems which have evolved over\n\nat least 40 years. Some of these problems are unique in ttiat no\n\njudicial pronouncements exist in connection therewith.\n\n(c) The very nature of the issues raised in the Applications, their far-\n\nreaching and complex character which expands their scopc, will\n\nnecessarily rcquire extensive research into historical and legal\n\nrecords extending over a period of more than 40 years. Furthemore518 SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\nmany of the documents which will be required, particularly those\n\nrelating to the League of Nations, are no longer readily available.\n\n(d) A plcading which covers al1the questions raised will no doubt bc a\n\nIengthy one and willmost IikeIy be accompanied by many annexures.\n\nThe printing of such a document will doubtless take çome time.\n\n{e) In considering the question of tlie time now to be allowed to my\n\nGovernrnent for filing its Counter-hfemorial it is subrnitted that the\n\nfact that the Applicants have had a long time to prepnre their case\n\nshould be borne in mind. On the other hand the first official intiina-\n\ntion to my Government of the Applicants' intention to institute\n\nlegaï proceedi~igs was only received at the same time when the\n\napplications were transrnitted toit, viz.on the 4th November 1960.\n\nIn this regard, itrnust be pointed out that the responsible Min-\n\nister and most of the officials concerned with this mattcr were at\n\nthat tirne abroad attending the General Asçemblp of the United\n\nNations.\n\nIn conclusion, 1 respectfully wish to statethat my Government con-\n\nsiders the allegations made against it in a very serious light. For this\n\nreason, also, iisdr:sirous of ohtaining sufficient time to enable it to den1\n\nproperly and satisfactorily with the issues raised.\n\nIVherefore I pray that the date which it may please the Honourable\n\nCourt to determine for the filing of the Counter-Mernorial of thGovern-\n\nment of the Union ofSouth Africa shall not be before the 15th February\n\n1962.\n\nPleasc accept, etc.,\n\n14. THE AGENT FOI*THE GOVERXMENTS OF ETHIOPIA AND LIBERIA TO THE\n\nREGTSTRAR\n\n(telegram)\n\n6 January 1961.\n\n.Have received your letter 3 January enclosing request of Agent of\n\nSouth Africa for leave to file Counter-hlemoriai South West Africa case\n\n\"not before 15 Febmary 1962\" n view of Respondent's desire for so\n\nlong a delay we respectfully request opportunity for a meeting pursuant\n\nArticle 37,Rilles ofCourt. ive wish toCO-operatewith Court in assisting\n\nfind bala~icebet~veeninterest ofApplicants in expeditiouç determination\n\ngrave issues presented and nght of Respondent to have adequate oppor-\n\ntunity to rnet:t allegations.

The competent South African\n\nauthorities were therefore note~iabled to submit their views before the\n\nOrder was made, as they were entitled to do in terms of Article 3 (1)\n\nof the Rules.\n\nFurthermore, it wouid appear that the purview of Article 3 of the\n\nRules was exceedetl in that, whereas the said Article requires the Appli-\n\ncants to decide prior to the time-limit fixed for the filing of the mernorial\n\nwhether they will (:hoosan ad hoc judge, the effect of their request of\n\n28 March and the Order made pursuant thereto isto enable them todefer\n\ntheir decision until sorne seven months later.\n\nAs the Govemment of the Kepublic of South Africa is now faced with\n\na fait accompli,I am directed to draw your attention to the foregoing\n\nand to enquire whether there were any special circumstances which led\n\nto these apparent departures from the Rules. It is not Our intention to\n\nraiçeany forma1objection to the Order, but my Government is naturally\n\nansious to ensure that it will be informed timeously of any procedural\n\nmatters whereby its interestsmay be affected.\n\n1also note that both Orders, of13January and 20 May 1961 ,efer to\n\na \"dispute concerning the interpretation and application of the Mandate\n\nof South West Africa\". 1assume that these words are employed merelv\n\nby way of descriptive reference tothe allegationinthe Applications and\n\nMernorials of the Governments of Ethiopiaand Liberia and not as signi-\n\nfying that the question whether such dispute esists could not be in\n\nissue in the proceedings.\n\nIhave, etc., CORRESPONDENCE 523\n\n22. THE ACTING REGISTRAR TO THE AGENT FOR THE GOVERYMENT OF .\n\nZOUTH AFRICA\n\n15June 1961.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the Iionour to acknowledge receipt of the letter of g June 1961\n\nin which $ou refcr tothe Order made by the Court on zo May 1961 in the\n\nSouth TVes,A!fricacases (Ethicipia v. liepublic of Soiith Africa; Liberiv.\n\nRepublic of South Africa).\n\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the liules, the Court in that Order\n\nfixed a time-limit within which the Government of Ethiopia and the\n\nGovernment of Liberia, acting in concert may choosc a single Judge ad\n\nhoc. In so doing it intendcd neither to depnve the Government of the\n\nRepublic of South Africaof its rights under the Rulcs nor to prejudice in\n\nany way tlie exercisc of such rights.\n\nItis noted that it isnot your intention to raise any formal objection to\n\nthe Order of the Court. The Government of the Republic of South Africa\n\nwill in due course have ample opportunity to submit its views on any\n\nchoice made by the applicant Governrnents, acting in concert, within the\n\ntime-limit laid down in the Oriier. Thcse views will not be limited to the\n\nidentity of any person so chosen but will be cntirely at Iarge.Tt is the\n\nintention of the President, if such a choice be made by the Applicants,\n\nto fisa time-lirnit within which the Government of the Republic of\n\nSouth Airica may submit its views in accordance with paragrapli I of\n\nArticle 3.\n\nYou statc that the competent Soutli African autlioritieswere prevented\n\nfrom suhmitting their views brfore the Order was made on 20 May 1961,\n\nand indicate that this constituted a departure from the Rutes, in parti-\n\ncular from Article 3, paragraph 1, tliereof, any011 ask whether this was\n\nthe result of any special circumstances. 1 would point out in the firçt\n\nplace that the provision to which you refer in no way requires that the\n\nfixing of tlic time-limit first meiitionccl therein should be delayed urltil the\n\nother party should have submitted its views.\n\nIn the second place, 1 would draw your attention to the fact tliat in\n\nmaking its Order of 20 blny 1961 the Court was concerned ~4th the appli-\n\ncation of paragraph 2of Article 3 and in fact fixed a time-limit for the\n\nchoice of a single Judge ad hocby the two Governments. Tliere would\n\nappearto be evident advantages in giving you an opportunity to espress\n\nyour views after, rattier than before, tiiat decision had beentakcn. Itis\n\nclear that if no choice be made by the applicant Governments, acting in\n\nconcert, the Republic of South Africa cannot in any \\ilay be prejudiced.\n\nIn the event of such a choice being made, it will be irnmediately com-\n\nmunicated to you. If, after pou have submitted yorir views, any doiibt or\n\nobjection should ürisc, tlie decision, in accordance witli the last seiltence\n\nof paragraph I of Article 3,shall rest with the Court, ifnecessary after\n\nhearing the Parties.\n\nIn conclusion on tliis point, I am directed by tlie President to assure\n\nyou that the Court's chief concern is that in al1matters there should be\n\ncomplete ccluality between the Parties. When the time comcs for the\n\nGovernment of the Republic of South Africa to reach a decisioii con-\n\ncerning the choice of a Judge ad hoc, anp wishes it may express as to\n\ntirne-limits to be fixer1will be fully taken into consideration.524 SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\n......... ......a .............\n\nFinalIy, 1 would inform you that your assumption, expressed in the\n\nlast paragraph of your letter, with reference to the words there clted, is\n\nentirely correct. In accordance with the common practice of the Court,\n\nthe general words used to describe the nature of the case referred to it\n\nare taken from the letters of transmittal of the Applications refemng\n\nthe case to the Court.

THE AGENT FOR THE GOVERNMENTS OF ETHIOPIA AND LIBERIA TO\n\nTHE KEGlSTRAR\n\nII October 1961.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honoirr to refer to the Order of the International Court of\n\nJustice, dated 20 May 1961i, n which the Court fixed 15 November 1961\n\nas the date within which the Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia,\n\nacting in concert, exercise their right to choose a single ad hoc Judge to sit\n\nin the South West Africa cases. CORRESPONDENCE 525\n\nThis isto advise the Registry that Ethio ia and Liberia are prepared\n\nto waive their right to appoint a Judge a a hoc to sit in the SoutWest\n\nAfrica cases, provided, however, that the Union of South Africa make a\n\nsimilar waiver. In the event t:hat the Union of South Africa chooses a\n\nJudge ad hoc, or signifies its intention to do so, Ethiopia and Liberia\n\nhereby advise the Court of their intention to do likewise and hereby\n\nrespectfully request the Court to grant them permission to do sowithin\n\nsuitable time-limits to be prescribed by the CouIn.making this request,\n\nit isthe intention of Ethiopia and Liberia to assure that a situation will\n\nnot arise in which the Court would be sitting with a Judge ad hoc from\n\none of the Parties only.\n\nWe request you to transmit this communication to the Members of\n\nthe Court and to the other Party.\n\nConfirmation that the foregoing procedure is acceptable tothe Court\n\nwould be appreciated.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Signed) Emest A. GROSS.\n\n12 October 1961.\n\nSir,\n\n1have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, da4eOctober\n\n1961 and received in the Registry onII October 1961, in which you refer\n\nto the Order made by the Court in the SouthWest Africa caseson 20 May\n\n1961, which fixed 15 Novcrnber 1961 as the time-liniit withiwIiiçhthe\n\nGovernment of Ethiopia and the Government of Liberia, acting in\n\nconcert, may choose a single Judgead hoc.\n\nYou ask, in the first place, on the assumption that the applicant\n\nCovernments may nominate a Judge ad hoc within that tirne-limit,\n\nwhether your Government will have to nominate a Judge ad hoc on or\n\nbefore the date that its first yleadings are filed or whether your Govern-\n\nment need only reserve a right to do so and give its final decision on the\n\nmatter and the name of the person chosen rvithin a time-limit to be\n\nfixed by the President in ierms of Article 3 of the Rules.\n\nIn re ly to this question, 1have the honour to point out that Artic3e\n\nof the 8ules does not require that the name of a person chosen to sit as\n\nJudge shall be communicated within the time-limit fixed for the filing of\n\nthe first pleading. That date, under the Article, is relevant to the state-\n\nment of theParty's intention. Since the Court was ready to accept the\n\nreservation of the right by the applicant Covernments as sufficient\n\ncornpliance rvith the requirements ofthe Rules and fixed the time-limit\n\nwithin which a Judge ad hoc may be chosen, it may be concluded that,\n\nshould your Governrnent wish to adopt a similar course, it wibe per-\n\nmitted to do so. In this connection, 1 have the honour to refer to my\n\nletter of15 June 1961, in which I informed you that the President had5z6 SOUTH it7EST AFRlCA\n\ndirected me to assure you that the Court's chief concerii was that in al1\n\nmatters there should be complete equality bctween the Parties.\n\nYou ask, in the second place, to be informed up to ivhat time Sour\n\nGovernmcnt nlay exercise the right to choose a Judge under Article 31\n\nof the Statute should the Government of Ethiopia and the Governrnent of\n\nLiberia, acting in concert, not choose a Judge ad hoc ~vithin the time-\n\nlimit fised by the Court.\n\nIhave the honour, in reply to this question, to state that the failure of\n\nthe applicant Governments to choose a Judge ad hoc within the time-\n\nlimit fixed by the Order of 20 May 1961 would not affect the time-\n\nlimits applicable to thc Government of the liepublic of South Africa.\n\nFinally, yoiiask whether, in the eventuality conternplated in ).Our\n\nsecond question, tlie Government of Liberia and the Government of\n\nEthiopia ~ould again be accorded the right to choose a Judge ad hoc\n\nwithin a furtlier tirne-limitu be fised.\n\nIn reply to this question, 1 have the horiour to refer you to the\n\nNottebohm case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) in the second phase of\n\nwhich a situation arose similar to that which )'ou envisage; no action\n\nwith reference tothe choice of a Judge ad hoc was taken by the Applicant\n\nat the time of the filing of the Mernorial (3 June 1952). The Kespondent\n\nhaving, within the tirne-limitfixed for the filing of the Counter-hlemorial\n\n(20 April 1954). designated a person to sitas Judge ad hoc,the Agent for\n\nthe Government of Liechtenstein informed the Kegistrar that this\n\nnomination left the Governrnent of Liechtenstein with no alternative\n\nbut to esercise, in their turn, their right to nominate a Judge ad hoc\n\nand tliat a name ~rrouldshortly be submitted to the Court in this con-\n\nnection. .4t the same time the Agent indicated that it had not been the\n\noriginal intention of the Governrnent of Liechtenstein to nominate a\n\nJudge ad hoc and tliat that Government was willing to refrain from\n\nnotninating a Judge on tlie condition that the Government of Guatemala\n\nwithdrem tlieir riornination and made no other. The latter Government,\n\nnot having acted upon this proposal, the Government of Liechtenstein on\n\n26 July 1954 notified its choice of a Judgad hocwho in due course sat to\n\nconsider the case.\n\nTlieright conferred by Article31 of the Statute is an absolute one\n\nwliich affects the composition of the Court and the equality of the Parties.\n\nAccordingly the provisions of Article 3 of the Rules could never be\n\ninterpreted by the Court in sucli a way as ta frustrate tlieobject of the\n\nStatute by introducing inequality as between tlie Parties. The Nottebohm\n\ncase serves to illustrate the principle in accordance with which the Rule is\n\napplied.\n\nIn these circumstances it will be clear that the yossibility can be\n\nevcluded of tlie Court's sitting with a Judge ad hocchosen by one Party\n\nonly while tht: other Party was desirous of choosing a Judge ad hoc and\n\nready to do so.\n\nCopies of your letter and of the present reply are being sent to the\n\nAgents for the Governmerits of Ethiopia and Liberia.\n\n1 have, etc., 26.

The Applicaiits' accusations agriinst Resyorident, with rcference to\n\nthe vanous subjects listed above, are concerned in part with standards of\n\ndevelopment that have or have not been achieved, and in part with\n\nallegcd motives involved in the policies adopted by Respondent in the\n\nAdministration of South West Africa.\n\nThese featureç of the accusation necessitate a broad and full responçe\n\nextending beyond the confines of the specific matters raiscd by the\n\n~pplican'ts. -\n\nAs at present ndvised Respondent should consequently include inthe\n\nCounter-Memorial (in addition to, or as part of the foundatian for,\n\naiiswering of the specific a1Iegations)-\n\n(i) a geographicnl survey of the Territory;\n\n(ii) an ethnological survey covering each of the numerous population\n\ngroups ;\n\n(iii) an economic survey ;\n\n(iv) general progress made in tlie developrnent of the Territorjr and the\n\nadvancement of the welt-bcing of the inhabitants;\n\nIV) reasons for applying differing measures to the various population\n\ngroups ;\n\n(vi) standards in comparable territones and States.\n\n3. A certain measure of researcli and preliminary compilation wark has\n\nbeen done over a period of nearly two years by a team of experts, of-\n\nficials and lawyers.\n\nA survey basecl on such work inclicates thatthe Counter-Mernorial may\n\nrun into 2,500 printed pages OFthe standard size of publications at the\n\nCourt, and perhaps even more.\n\nIn addition there will have to be extensive copying of documents.\n\n4. According to an estimate made by Sijthoffs Publishing Company, the\n\nCourt's officia1printers in Leyden, at least 15 weeks will be taken for\n\nprinting of a Couiiter-h'lemorial ofI,500 pages.\n\n5. In view of the above considerations, Respondent's represent at'lves\n\nca~inot see how their task can properly and adequately be performed in\n\nless than 12 months.\n\nThis estimate takes due account of the facl that Respondent's lega1\n\ntearn is now being substantially iricreased in numbers.\n\n6.

THE AGEXT FOR THE GOVERNMEKTS OF ETHIOPIA AND LIBERIA TO THE\n\nREGISTRAR\n\n30 January 1963.\n\nSir,\n\nAs Agent for the Governments of Ethiopia and Liberia 1 have the\n\nhonour to refer to your communication No. 37249 dated 21 January 1963,\n\nenclosing a copy of a Memorandum dated 19 January 1963, addressed\n\nto the Court by the Agent for the Republic of South Africa, Respondent\n\nin the Sotrlh West Africa cases. Respondent requests the Court to fixa\n\ntime limit of 12 rnonths in which Respondent may file its Counter-\n\nBfemorial and requests the opportunity to be present at prospective\n\ndiscussions with the President in tems of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy cable datetl 23 January 1963 the undersigned, as Agent for\n\nEthiopia and Liberia (the \"Applicants\"), notified the Court of their\n\nobjection to the request of Respondent, and stated that Applicants\n\nwould convey their views in support of their objection as soon as pos-\n\nsible. Applicants,inaccordance with Article 37of the RuIes ofProcedure,\n\nrespectfully submit their views and reasons for urging the Court to\n\nreduce the length of time requested by Respondent for prepanng and\n\nfiling its Counter-Mernorial.\n\nI.The practice of this Honourable Court makes it clear that Respon-\n\ndent's right to have reasonably adequate opportunity to present its\n\ncase is to be balaiiced against Applicants' right to obtain a reasonably\n\nexpeditious determination ofthe issues.\n\nThe rnatters complained of by Applicants in the pending cases are\n\nof a nature justifying and requiring reasonably expeditious resolution.\n\nApplicants allege that rights have been unlawfully denied to the in-\n\nhabitants of the 'Territory of South iirest Africa by Respondent. The\n\ninhabitants of the Temtory, as well as interested States, seek judicial\n\nl La méme communicstioiaikt6 adressée a tous les autres Etrits 3Iembres des\n\nxations Unies etaux Etats no6 membres des riations Unies qui sontparties au\n\nStatut de la Courou auxquellsaCour estouverte aux termes de l'ar35, par.2,\n\ndu Statut. CORRESPONDENCE 541\n\nremedies adequate to assure the safe-guards of the Mandate respecting\n\nrights which-if Applicants' contentions are sustained by the Court-\n\nhave been deniecl by Respondent for a nurnber of years.\n\n2. The considerations adduced by Respondeiit in its request for\n\n12 ~nonths' delay in filing its Counter-Mernorial are that the issues are\n\ncornplex and numerous, and that they cover a period of more than\n\n40 years. Respondent cites the ~~ossiblelength of its Counter-hlemorial\n\nand urges that at least 15 weeks will be required for printing.\n\n3. In December 1960, Respondent was called upon to submit its\n\nvieivs as to the tirne-limit in which it should file its Counter-Mernorial,\n\nBy letter dated JI December ~gGo,addressed to the Registrar of the\n\nCourt, Respondent requested a period of \"at leastIO to 12 months\". In\n\nsupport of its request, Respondent set forth basically the same con-\n\nsiderationsit now repeats, including then,as itdoes now, a summary of\n\nfactual issues raised. In addition, Respondent, in 1960, contended that\n\nalthough Applicants had had a long time in which to prepare their case,\n\nRespondent's \"first officia1intimation\" that there would be legal pro-\n\nceerlings directed against it occurred when it received the Applications\n\non 4 November 1960.\n\n4. In its letter o19 January 1963, Respondent acknowledges that \"a\n\ncertain measure of research and preliminary compilation work has been\n\ndone ovet a period of nearly two years by a team of experts, officials and\n\nlawyers\". In the light of the long history of controversy regarding the\n\nmatters comp1aint:d of in the Applications, and the fact that Kespoiident\n\nlias had oficial and explicit knowledge of them since at lea4tNovember\n\n1960, it would have indeed been surprising had Respondent not acknow-\n\nledged that it hasalready done much of the work required for its Coun-\n\nter-8Iemarial.\n\nIII\n\nRespondent, more than 2 ycars ago thus requested \"at least IO to\n\n12 months\" in whicli to fileits Counter-Memorial. It was, by order of the\n\nCourt dated 13 January 1961, given 8 months in which to do so. Appli-\n\ncants strongly urge that Respondent has advanced no adequate reason\n\nfor ~towextending the length of time previously determined by the Court\n\nto be adequate. 011the contrary, it is respectfully submitted that a period\n\nshorter than 8 months would now be fair and adequate.\n\n(1)The reasons adduced by Respondent in 1960 for an unduly long\n\ntime limit were basically the same reasons adduced now.\n\n(2)IVhereas Respondent asserted in 1960 that it had had no time\n\npreviously in which to prepare, it now admittedly has had 2 years, and\n\nRespondent acknowledges, as must reasonably be assumed, that it has\n\nengnged in research and compilation work during the 2-year period.\n\n(3)The issues requiring preparation by Respondent now are signifi-\n\ncantly less than those considered at the time the previous time Limit\n\nwas fised. During the course of the Preliminary Objections certain ofthe\n\nkey legal issues were resolved.\n\n(4)Since 21 December 1962, when the Court handed down its Judg-\n\nment on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, Respondent has had more\n\nthan one month in which to continue work on its Counter-Mernorial.\n\n(5)Not a11of the 15 weeks envisaged by Respondent for pRnting\n\nwould have to be devoted solely to that purpose, even ifRespondent's\n\nCounter-liernorial were to reach the length forecast by Respondent.542 SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\nClearly, manuscript could be transmitted for printing in stages of com-\n\npletion.\n\n(6) The issues of fact involved in thSottfh 1,Vest jrica caseshave not\n\nbeen newly raised. They have for many years been the subject of pub-\n\nlished reports by the United Nations Committee on South West Africa,\n\nand have been dehated in the General Assembly and in Committees of\n\nthe General Assembly. hloreover, information relating to the factual\n\nissues is peculiarly within the knowledge and control of Respondent as\n\nMandatory for the Territory of South West Africa. liespondent has had\n\nready, and in somc:cases, unique access to relevant documentation and\n\nsource rnatenal. Indeed, for many years information concerning the\n\nsubject-matter of most of the factual issues was regularly compiled by\n\nRespondent and submitted by jtto the Permanent Mandates Comnlission\n\nof thc League of Nations. It is reasonable to presume that current in-\n\nformation of a like nature has also been compilecl and rnaintaincd by\n\nRespondent.\n\nApplicants have researched the cases before the Court as reported for\n\nthe years 1947 to July 1961 (excluding the cases :it bar). To Appli-\n\ncants' knowledge, never has a party been given a period as long as\n\n12 months in which to file a Counter-Mernorial, even taking into account\n\nextensions of time-limits. The longest period accordcd to any party in\n\nany case, so far as Applicants have found, was 9 months, and including\n\nextensions, II months, $rior to the filing of Prelirninary Objections.The\n\naverage amount of time, including extensions, appears to have been 3 to\n\n6 months. The lowgest Period any Party has been accordedfor fililtg its\n\nCoutater-Mernorial,afler filingPrelinzinary Objectio~zs,and including ex-\n\ntefhsiom, was 4 months.\n\nThe closest analogy to the case at bar appears to be ZiightsofPassage\n\nover Ilzdiafi Territory (PortugaW. india). At the initial stages othe pro-\n\nceedings India was accorded 6 months in which to file its Counter-\n\nMernorial, and thei-eafter was granted an additional 4 rnonths. India then\n\nfiied Preliminary Objections. After the Judgment disrnissing the Objec-\n\ntions,lndia was accorded 3 months in which to file its Counter-Nernorial.\n\nIt thereafter received a 1-rnonth postponement, during which time it\n\nfiled itsCounter-R,iemoriaI.\n\nInthe case at bar, Respondent was accorded 8 months in tvhich to file\n\nits Counter-hfemorial (the second longest period accorded to a party) on\n\nits representation that it required such a lengthy period prirnarily be-\n\ncause of the large nunrber of factual issues raised concerning the merits.\n\nRespondent thereitfter ernployed al1 but z ~veeks of the S months iii\n\npreparing its Preliminnry Objections.\n\nThe Right of Passage Case, noted above, is apt precedent for the\n\nproposition that when a party is originally accorded a lengthy time-limit\n\n(in that case more than 6 months) for filing its Counter-Mernorial, and\n\nthereafter files Prdiminary Objeclionsnear the expiration of that lirnit,\n\nit should not thereafter be granted an equal-to sap nothing of a Ionger-\n\nperiod to cornplete its pleading.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing views and reasons, the Governments of COKKESPONDENCE 543\n\nEtliiopia and Liberia urge that the request of the Republic of South\n\nAfrica be denied, and that the Court determine that Respondent should\n\nhave 6 months in ahich to file its Counter-Mernorial. If discussions are\n\nheld in the terms of Article 37 of the Rules ofCourt, Applicants request\n\nthe privilege of attendance.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Signed) Ernest A. CROSS.\n\n55.

THE AGENT FOR THE GOVBRNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA TO THE\n\nREGIÇTRAR\n\nzx August 1963.\n\nSir,\n\nI.You are respectfully referred to the Order of 5 February 1963,\n\nfixing30 September 1963, as the tirne-limit for the filing of Respondent's\n\nCounter-Mernorial in the Soitlh WestAfrica cases.\n\nz. Despite utmost endeavours to expedite preparation, it has been\n\nfound impossible to complete the Counter-Memonal in time for filing\n\non 30 September 1963. My Govcrnment isaccordingly regretfully obliged\n\nto apply, as it hereby does, for an extension othe time-limitin terms of\n\nRule of Court No. 37.4.\n\n3. In previous communications, 1 have had occasion to refer to the\n\nmultiplicity and complexity ofthe issues raised in thSouth WestAfrica\n\ncases, resulting in a situation whereby they in effect amount to a large\n\nnurnber of cases rolled into one. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition\n\nin this regard, 1respectfully wish to draw attention in particular to the\n\ndocument dated 19 January 1963, submitting Respondent's views re-\n\ngarding the time-lirnit for filing of the Counter-Memorial.In that docu-\n\nment, the matters specifically dealt with in Chapters V toIX of Appli-\n\ncants' Mernorials are tabulated and a Iist is given of subjects with cach\n\nof which Respondent will have to deal systernatically,as a necessary\n\nfoundation for, ancl thiis in addition to, chapters answering the specificallegations.On the basis of that analysis and of an estimated Ij weeks\n\nrequired for printing, 1then çtatcd that-\n\n\"Respondent's representatives cannot see how their task can\n\nproperly and adequately be perfonned in less than 12 montl-is.\"\n\n4. Events since January 1963 have shown thnt the period of 12 months\n\nin the above statement was a considerablc u~iderestirnate on the part of\n\nRespondent's representatives, for which 1 mish to convey our sincere\n\napologies.\n\n5. ASwas intimated in the document of 19 January x963 , team of\n\nexperts, officials and lawyers had been engaged on research and pre-\n\nlirninnry compilation work relative to the Counter-Memorial for a period\n\nof nearly two years, i.e., cornmencing shortly after the filing of the\n\nApplications in these cases and concurrently with the preparation and\n\npresentation of Respondent's case on the Preliminary Objections.\n\n6. Upon dismissal of the Preliminary Objections and the fixing of\n\n30 September 1963,as the time-limit for filinofthe Counter-Memorial,\n\nthe preparatory work had to be CO-ordinated and re-written in a form\n\nsuitable for presentation ta the Wonourable Court. In order to expedite\n\nmatters in this regard as mucfi as possible, the following steps were,\n\ninter dia, taken :\n\n(a) The team of legal represcritatives, experts and officials was con-\n\nsiderably enlarged.\n\n(bj Every effort was made by thc drafting tcam to teduce the length of\n\nthe Counter-hlemorial to the minimum reasonably required for\n\nadequate presentation.\n\n(c) Hegotiations rvith printers, in the Netherlands and in South Africa,\n\nresulted in a considerable reduction of the original estimates of\n\nprinting time, the assessnient (in both countries) now being six\n\nweeks, subject to a very fast fate of proof-reading and supyly of\n\nCOPY.\n\n7..In practice, however, it has been found, as \\vil1 be readily ap-\n\npreciated, that there is a limitto the timc savings that can be accom-\n\nplished even by means such asthe above. In view ofthe need for accuracy,\n\nCO-ordination and unity in the end product, al1 the work must in its\n\nfinalstages necessariiy pass through the hands of relatively few persons-\n\nwho must also assist in the planning and CO-ordination of earlier stages\n\nof production. The volume of the work involvcd is enormous. Preliminary\n\ndrafts (which are of necessity unco-ordinated and overlapping) run into\n\nthousands of typed pages, with the result that critical rending alone\n\ntakes up considerable time. Onc of thc objects at the final stages is to\n\nreduce the volunie of reading matter to sizeable proportions, for the\n\nconvenience of tht:HonourahIe Mcmbers of the Court, without thereby\n\ndoing injustice tothe case that requires to be presented on Rcsponclent's\n\nbehalf.\n\n8. Respondent cxpects to have availabIe inprint, before 30September\n\n1963, one self-contained portion of the Countcr-Memonal, dealing 115th\n\nbasic legal issues whicl-iwill requirc consideration at this stage of the\n\nproceedings, asweII as with the historical background relative thereto.\n\nRespondent will gladly make this volume available to Applicants as soon\n\nas it iscompleted,in order to enablc them to proceed ~4th the preparation\n\nof their answer and thus expedite the filing of their Reply. If the Court\n\nor the Honourablc President should so desire, Respondent would also546 SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\ngladly file this portion of the Counter-Mernorial immediately upon its\n\ncompletion.\n\ng. In order to complete the rest of the Counter-Mernorial, however,\n\nRespondent will, for the reasons indicated above, require time beyond\n\n30 September 1963. But here also, if it should be so desired by Appli-\n\ncants, Respondent is prepared to CO-operate in the adoption of special\n\nmethods with a view to reducing the period which Applicants rnay need\n\nto file their Reply.Thus, as and whcn further portions of the Counter-\n\nlllemorialrnay become availablein final roneoed form pnor to printing,\n\nRespondent would be prepared to render them available to Applicants.\n\nAlthough Respondent would in such event reserve the right to effect\n\nalterations at the printing stage, such alterations, if any, would inal1\n\nprobability be of minor irnport only.\n\nIO. The possible special steps referred to in paragraph8 and g hereof,\n\nare respectfully submitted merely as suggestions with a view to mini-\n\nmizing the delay and inconvenience that might arise from the extension\n\nnow applied for. They need not be taken ifnot favoured by the Honour-\n\nable President or t.he Court. Respondent would also gladly consider any\n\nreasonable alternative suggestions having the same purpose in view.\n\nIr. Having regard to al1 the relevant factors, Respondent's repre-\n\nsentatives, to the best of their ability. estimate thatfurther seven and\n\na half months will be required for completion of the Counter-Mernorial.\n\n1thereforerespectfully apply on Respondent's behaIf, for extension of\n\nthe time-limit for the filingof the Counter-Memorial in the South West\n\nAfrica cases until15 hlay 1964.\n\n1 have, etc.,\n\n59. THE AGENT FOR THE GOVERNXIBNTS OF ETHIOPIA AND LIBERIA\n\nTO THE REGIÇTRAR\n\n6 September 1963.\n\nSir,\n\nReference is made to Communication No. 38386 dated 30 August 1963,\n\nfrom the Deputjr-Registrar, transmitting a copy of a letter dated\n\n21 August 1963, atldressed to the Registrarby the Agent for the Govern-\n\nment of the Repiiblic of South Africa, Respondent in the South West\n\nAfvica cases. Respondent has requested a seven and a half months\n\nextension of the time-limit fixed for thefilingof its Counter-Memorial in\n\nthese cases, the said request having been received anfilein the Registry\n\nof theCourt on 29 August 1963, one month prior to the expiration of the\n\ntime-limit of30 September 1963.\n\nPrornptly upon receipt of telegraphic advice from the Registry of the\n\naforesaid letter, the Applicants, through the underçigned Agent, dis-\n\npatched a cable dated 30 August 1963, opposing any extension of time CORRESPONDEXCE 547\n\nfor filing the Counter-Mernorial, and reserving the right to submit a\n\nMemorandum upon receipt of the copy of Respondent's letter. Having\n\nnow received said copy, Applicants respectfully renew their vigorous\n\nobjection to granting of Respi~ndent's request, and in support of such\n\nobjection cal1 to the Court's attention the considerations enumerated\n\nbelow.\n\nKespondent's request for an extension of time follows its consistent\n\npattern of requesting unreasonably long periods to prepare its pleadings,\n\nwhile, on the contrary, Applicants have at al1 times sought to proceed\n\nwith expedition, at no stage having requested longer than five months to\n\nsubmit ripleading herein.\n\n1.The Applications were fileon 4 November 1960.\n\n2.AppLicants requested and received a 5 months' time-limit for filing\n\ntheir Memorials, which were tluly filed 15 Apnl 1961. Respondent by\n\nletter of31 December 1960, requested until 15 February 1962 to file its\n\nCounter-Memorial, a period ofmore than 15 months from the date of the\n\nApplications and ten months f'romthe date of the Mcmorials. Respon-\n\ndent sought to justify its request for so lengtayperiod primarily on the\n\nground that the Applications dealt \"not only with a number of intricate\n\nlegal and constitutional poi~itsbut also with a large number of factual\n\nquestions relating to almost everp facet of the administration of the\n\nTerritory of South West Afriça. over a period of40 years\".\n\n3. Objection to the request having been made by Applicants, th<\n\nAgents for the respective Parties met on 13 January 1961 with the\n\nPresident of this Honourable Court, in terms of Ai 'icl37 of the Rulesof\n\nCourt, and both Parties submitted Blemoranda in support of their\n\nrespective views l.Having heard the Parties and haiijng considered the\n\nviews set forth in their written submissions, this Honourable Court by\n\nOrder dated 13 January 1g61, fised15 December 1961 as the time-limit\n\nfor the filing of the Counter-BIcmorial.\n\nAccordingly, Respondent had virtually the entire year of 1961 to\n\ngatlier al1documents and source material relevant to the issues raised in\n\nthe Applications,to engage in requisite resenrch and to prepare argument\n\nupon the legal issues raised thercin, with al1of ïvhich Respondent had a\n\nunique familiarity and access, arising from over 40 years' administration\n\nof South IlTest Africa.\n\nShortly prior to the expiral.ion of the aforesaid tirne-limit, viz. on\n\n30 November 1961, Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections and\n\nApplicants thereupon requested and received a period of 3 months in\n\nwhich to file their Observations.\n\n4. Following the Judgment of 21 December 1962 on the Preliminary\n\nObjections, Respondent requested and received a period of I month for\n\nformulating its views concerning the tirne-limit required for Counter-\n\nMernorial.\n\n5. By memorandum dated 19 January 1963, Respondent requested a\n\nperiod of 12 months in which to file its Counter-Rfcmorial. Such request\n\nwas for a period more than twice that accorded to any party in any case\n\nl Not filcd withe Registry.54& SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\npreviously before this Court for filing a Counter-Mernorial, inclzrding\n\nextensions,following a Judgment on Prelirninary Objections. Respon-\n\ndent's supporting arguments for so lengthy a period were basically the\n\nsame aç those adduced in its initial request of 31 December 1960.\n\n6. Bp Memorandum dated 30 January 1963,Applicants opposed the\n\nrequest for 12 months as dilatory. The Court allowed Respondent\n\ng months.\n\n7. Respondent, repeating for'the third tirne in two years the same\n\nbasic contentions as to the necessity for compilation of material and\n\nextensive research, now seeks an additional seven and a half months.\n\nRespondent now concedes, however, that printing can be completed\n\nin 6 weeks rather than the 15 weeks it previously represented, but con-\n\ntends that it underestimated by what is, in effect, more than half a\n\nyear the time required to prepare its Counter-Mernorial.\n\nIII\n\nApplicants refer the Court to their blemorandum of 30January 1963\n\nsetting forth the grounds for opposing as dilatory Respondent's earlier\n\nrequest for 12 months in which to fileits Counter-Memorial. Conceding\n\nRespondent's right to have reasonably adequate opportunity to present\n\nits case, Applicants then submitted and now reiterate their equally valid\n\ninternational accountabilityioand legal protection of human rights in-\n\nvoIved in these cases.\n\nof the respective interests of the Parties called that a fair balancing\n\ntember 1963 as the time-limit for filing the Counter-Mernorial is now\n\nconfronted, at virtiially the last minute. with a mere repetition of argu-\n\nments, already twice made, for unreasonably long periods. Nothing\n\nis added by Respondent by way of justification except the contention\n\nthat Respondent fiiids it \"impossible\" to complete the Counter-Rlemorial\n\nin time.\n\nA plea of\"irnpossibility\", concerning a matter in which discretion and\n\ndiligence play so decisive a part, and which iiivolves collection and\n\npreparation of material within Respondent's unique knowledge and\n\ncontrol, should, it is submitted, be appraised against the history of the\n\npleadings in these caçeç.\n\nI. Applications were filed 4 November 1960.\n\n2.Applicants requested and received 5 months for filing Memorials.\n\n3, Respondent rcquested 15moiiths from thedate of the Applications\n\nfor filing its Counter-Mernorial largely on the grounds that such a period\n\nis required to deal with the factual issues concerning its administration\n\nof South West Afnca; received 13 rnonths; filed Preliminary Objections\n\nz weeks before expiration of time-limit for the Counter-Mernorial, which\n\nobjections, of course, do notdeal with the aforesaid factual issues at all.\n\n4. -4pplicants requested and receivcd 3 months for filingObservations.\n\n5. After a lapseof I month following the Court's Judgment of 21 De-\n\ncember 1962, Respondent requested 12 months for filing its Counter-\n\nMernorial; the Court granted until 30 September 1963, a period of ap-\n\nproximately g months from the date of Judgment and of almost 3 years\n\nfrom the date of the filing of the Applications. CORRESPONDENCE 549\n\nIn its appraisal of Respondent's plea of \"impossibility\" of completing\n\nits Counter-Mernorial, Applicants respectfully urge upon the Court the\n\nconsideration that pursuant to Article 41 of the Rules of Court, the\n\nParties herein will have the opportunity to file further pleadings. Ilrfiile\n\ncalling attention to the danger that Respondent may seek to continue its\n\ndilatory procedures in connection with the exercise of its right of\n\nRejoinder, Applicants submit that any residual rnatters which Respon-\n\ndent rnay feel it lias overlooked or has been unable to analyse during the\n\nalmost 3-year period which h:is elapsed since the filing of the Applica-\n\ntions herein, may be included in its Rejoinder and, if necessary, in the\n\nOral Hearings as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Applicants respectfully reaffirm the reasons set forth in\n\ntheir Memoranda of 12 January 1961 and 30 January 1963, and oppose\n\nthe granting of any extension of time for fiiing the Counter-Mernorial.\n\nApplicants respectfully request the opportunity to be heard at the\n\nearliest possible time,ursuant to Article 37 of the Rules of Court, in the\n\nevent the Court does not see fit in the absence of such a hearing to deny\n\nany extension of the time-lirnit presently fixed for the fiIing of the\n\nCounter-Memorial herein.\n\n(Signed) Ernest A.

THE AGENT FOR THE GOVERNMENTS OF ETHIOPIA AND LIBERIA TO\n\nTHE REGISTRAR\n\n25 February 1964.\n\nSir,\n\n1 have the honour to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter düted\n\n18 February 1964, transmitting a copy of a letter dated 12 February\n\n1964, addressed to you by the Agent for the Respondeiit in the Sozltk\n\nWest Africa cases. Pursuant to your request to be informed promptly\n\nwhether the Agents for the Applicants desired to make any observations\n\nin connection with the aforesaid correspondence, a cablegram was\n\ndispatched to you by the undersigned as prornptly as possible followiiig\n\nthe receipt of your letter, advising you of our intention to do so.\n\nThe Agents for the Applicants gratefully accept the invitation to\n\nexpress their views concerning matters raised in the letter dated12 Feb-\n\nruary 1964 from the Agent for the Respondent, and respectfully submit\n\nherewith observations which thcy regard to be both relevant and\n\nsignificantto the proper course and conduct of the pending litigation.\n\nInhis letter o12 Febmary 1964, the Agent for the Respondent advises\n\nthe Rcgistrar of his intention to include among the documentation\n\nsubmitted with Respondent's Counter-Mernorial, two copies of a certain\n\n\"Report of a Commission on South West Africa\". The addition of this\n\nReport to the documentation previousIy submitted with the Counter-\n\nhlemorial, is asscrted in the letter of12 February 1964 to be designed\n\n\"for the convenience of the Court\". The Ictter does not, however, make\n\nclear how or to what end the \"convenience of the Court\" isserved by the\n\ninclusion of thisReport among tlie documentation. The averment in the\n\nletter that \"the said Report hns nothing to dowith the Counter-Mernorial\n\nas such\" appears inconsistent with the Agent's comment that \"Members\n\nof the Court may find it convenient tohave copies thereof constantly ai\n\ntheir disposa1 forrcference purposes\".\n\nThe Report in question was, as the Agent for the Respondent points\n\nout, referred to in paragraph 3j of Chapter VI1 of Book IV (II, pp. 476-\n\n477) of the Counter-Mernorial. In this paragraph, Respondent set forth\n\nthe objective with which the Respondent had appointed the Commission,\n\nthe composition of the Commission, itsterms of reference, and the advice CORRESPONDENCE 553\n\nto the Court that the Report of the Commission was \"expected to be\n\npublished in the very near future\".\n\n\\Vithout in any way commenting upon the merits at issueinthe pcnding\n\nlitigation, it seems highIy relevant to question how, under the foregoing\n\ncircumstanccs, it can be said that the Report \"has nothing to do with\n\nthe Counter-hlemonal as such\". The most cursory examination of the\n\nRecommendatjons ofthe Report reveals a direct and decisively important\n\nrelationship to the merits of principal issues at bar.\n\nIt would be inappropriate to comment herein concerning the merits\n\nof issues joined in the Pleadings previously filed by the Parties. It does\n\nnot, however, in any sense trench upon the merits to point out that\n\nimplementation of numerous key Recommendations of the Comniission\n\nwould be inconsistent with, and inderogation of, contentions made by\n\nthe Applicants and relief sought by them in the Applications aiid Sub-\n\nmissions. Accordingly, Applicants respectfully reserve their rights under\n\nArticle 41 of the Statute of the Court and Article 61of the lirileç of\n\nProcedure in the event Respondent should proceed with measures of\n\nirnplementation of the lieport of the Commission.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the statement in the letter of12 February\n\n1964. that the Report \"has nothing to do with the Counter-hlemonal as\n\nsuch\", must be understood to constitutc an assurance to the Court that\n\nimptementation of Recommendations of the Commission inconsistent\n\nwith contentions at issue inthe pending litigation, will be deferred in any\n\nevent until after the final Judgment of this Honourable Court, and upon\n\n.this understanding, Applicants perceive no objection to the inclusion of\n\ncopiesof theReport amongthe documentation submitted with theCounter-\n\nMemorial, in such quantities as the Court may find useful. Applicants,\n\nin any event, resl~ectfullyreserve the right in their Keply and subscquent\n\nstages to bring to the attention of the Court such considerations as\n\nApplicants deem relevant, concerning objectives of Respondent in\n\nappointing the Commission, its terms of reference, its Arguments,\n\nFindings and Recommend at'ions.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\n(Signe4 Ernest A.

In its Counter-Mernorial in the South West Africa cases (II, p476),\n\nthe Government of the Kepublic of South Africa made mention of the\n\nfact that the aforenientioned Commission had been appointed, set forth\n\nthe composition of the Commission and its terms of reference andstated\n\nfurther :\n\n\"The report of this Commission has becn due for some months\n\nnow, and is expected to be published in the very near future.\n\nUnfortunately it has not become available at an early enough stage\n\nto be dealt with in thisCozlnter-Mernorial .n so far as its recornmen-\n\ndations, and the Respondent Governrnent's reactians thereto, will\n\nbe relevant to the matters concerned in this case,Respondent will at\n\na subsequent stage take the necessary steps, with the leave of the\n\nCourt in so far as neccssary, to present such information to the\n\nCourt for its consideration.\"\n\n4, When the lettcr of 12 February 1964, was written, the Commission's\n\nreport had been pirblished and made available to the public but the\n\nGovernment's reactions to the recommendations of the commission had\n\nnot been announced as is still the position to date.\n\n5.
