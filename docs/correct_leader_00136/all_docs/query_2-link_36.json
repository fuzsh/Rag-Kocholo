        "text": "See Powell River beautifully.\n\nProudly serving the community since 2016.\n\n​\n\nAs a Comprehensive Surgical Ophthalmologist, our clinic is covered by MSP and we accept referrals for new patients from Family Doctors, Nurse Practitioners, Specialists, Optometrists and ER Physicians.\n\n​\n\nCOVID19 Update: Our clinic is open for patient consultations with various precautionary measures in place as per Government regulations. We also offer Telehealth services to patients as a temporary measure during the pandemic. We look forward to serving you.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThank you\n\nBased on your symptoms, you and Dr Botha will decide together when surgery is appropriate. Following the consultation, your eyes will be measured so that Dr Botha can help you choose the appropriate focusing power of your Intraocular Lens (IOL). Dr Botha works with three types of IOL's and the strengths and limitations of each lens will be discussed in detail. Surgery is performed at the Powell River General Hospital."
