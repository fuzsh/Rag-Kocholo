        "text": "When we joined The Geneva School 8 years ago, we were drawn in to the community immediately. In countless ways, Geneva has provided an exceptional education, opportunities to grow in faith, and life-giving relationships. Our oldest two (class of 2019 and class of 2021) have both stayed very close to their classmates. Our youngest (class of 2026) has expressed a desire to return to Geneva to teach in the future. I am so grateful for the support our kids have received over the years from teachers who have wanted the best for them. No school is perfect, but Geneva strives to nurture students with the goal of sending graduates into the world who love the Lord, serve their neighbors, and seek goodness, truth, and beauty.\n\nThis school is terrible. They are stuck up and pretentious. They do not care about the The children. I was shocked at how we were treated when inquiring about transferring our son to school. I spoke to several different people at the school and they were more interested in asking me questions then telling me about the school then when I had questions they danced around the answers, they also made it very clear to say that if our child didn’t score in the top 10% of their testing, they might not be a good fit for the school and we might need to look other places ,\n\nBuilding on a positive experience at another local school, our children joined Geneva in the 9th grade. We are pleased with the integrated Christian classical-school approach and emphasis on teaching our children how to think and solve problems, not what to think. Courses do not shy away from secular topics but teach them within a Christ-centered framework. 9th grade biology is almost worth the tuition on its own. As with any school, faculty quality varies. But most have extensive experience. There is a transition period coming from other education models, but faculty and administration were helpful and our children thrived within a semester of their transfer.\n\nThe Geneva School is truly an incredible place. I am so thankful I found this school. I don’t feel like I work here, rather I feel like I’m part of a community, using my God given talents for the community. The staff, parents, and kids that attend Geneva are my favorite part. I love partnering with parents to have their kids grow in their love of learning, sports, reading and most importantly God. I hope everyone can find a place to be apart of like The Geneva School!\n\nThe school is clearly focused on nurturing the student to become a leader. Academics, Arts, Sports are all required to help create well-rounded students and citizens. While being a large k-12 institution, the feeling is still personal and tailored. I appreciate the classical approach to learning, and the Christian worldview is key in understanding the chaos all around. I think my daughter will be well-equipped to navigate the world upon graduating.\n\nThe Geneva School teaching staff are very friendly and willing to go steps further to help students. My child was enrolled in the school on the rising sophomore year and made friends. We are grateful to join the Geneva School family.\n\nThe students do not need to be super athletic to join the school sport teams. The coach will figure out a spot for your child. Same concept to the school music program. I enjoy to see students improve their skills with the years of practice more than they are the state champ.\n\nI cannot think of bad experience in the past two years with the Geneva School.\n\nIt is a great community at The Geneva School. We love the families. We live the curriculum. We love how it teaches our child about God and social skills.\n\nWhat we would like to see changed is diversity. We need diverse teachers and more diverse students to make everyone feel welcome and also to truly show the love of Christ. We sadly do not show this quality at this time. Also, there is a lot of busy daily homework that can get quite repetitive. After a long school day, I’ve seen and heard a lot of students break down after school and show signs of anxiety (seen this as a former teacher at this school and in my own child).\n\nIt was pretty great! I just finished freshman year and I'm going to be a sophomore in August. I think the best part of Geneva is the teachers. They are so nice and you can tell that they really care and love their job! The worst part has to be the heavy homework load. On a regular day we're looking at 4 hours a night. I'd just like more compassion from the teachers when it comes to homework.\n\nGeneva is a wonderful tight knit community of teachers and students who truly care for each other. The best part is they are focused on providing children a Christ centered education without social agendas. I have yet to see a bad thing about Geneva. I wouldn’t change a thing.\n\nWe have loved our experience with Christian Classical Education at The Geneva School. The kids are immersed in their subjects, versus dull worksheets and memorization, which results in profound learning. For instance, in 2nd grade's studies of Egypt students create hieroglyphics in art, make a salt map in geography, mummify a chicken leg in science, perform the story of Exodus in theatre and so much more! It's a one-of-a-kind magical space where learning is just what you'd hope it could be."
