        "text": "I found so many different and sometimes contradicting information about Swiss school system. I guess depending on canton, it varies a lot. So, I will try to make sense of Geneva school system .\n\nNow, my kid is on 6th grade at local public school. He is now 9, will be 10 in few months. Then I am hearing from different people different stories, that at 12 they go to another school (secondary school?) or gymnasium (is the the same?) and there they will need to choose the path. Technical, humanities or vocational if he doesn't want to continue at university level education. Is this how it works? Who decides which path he goes?\n\nSo, my question is is there any up to date resource that explains all this?\n\nSomeone from Geneva is bound to help soon but here in Zurich it works like this:\n\n6 years of primary school.\n\nAfter that 2 options:\n\n-long gymnasiums (2+4 years - the 2 years the same everywhere and the 4 years are specific to the profile i.e. schientific, language etc)\n\n-secondary school (SEK) for 2 or 3 years after which children can swap to \"short\" gymnasium (i.e. go directly in the \"4 years\" or go to vocational school.\n\nWho chooses? There are tests to enter the gymanisum that can be done either in 6th grade for the \"long\" one or in 8th or 9th grade for th \"short\" one.\n\nAs for the content - for the gymnasium you can find typically the subject taught in each year but only the number of hours - I have not found more details than that but have not looked too much.\n\nThis link provides info and a diagram. Hope it helps!\n\nhttps://www.educationsuisse.ch/en/ed...ational-system\n\nI’m not in Geneva so can’t help with specifics but the system varies enormously depending on canton.\n\nI’m in Neuchâtel which I suspect is very similar to Geneva and it is totally different from the system in Zurich as posted by Kri above.\n\nWe have no long gymnasium here and it is a combination of marks achieved in tests and the teacher’s evaluation which decide which stream the children go into after grade 8. Otis always possible to move up or down throughout the course of secondary education (sometimes called middle school).\n\nHere are a couple of links for Geneva which might be helpful\n\nhttp://www.cagi.ch/uploads/pdf/Genev...ing_system.pdf\n\nhttps://www.unige.ch/egalite/parents/en/work/schooling/\n\nHi, my sister's children went through the Geneva school system until university.I'm copy/pasting her answer:\n\n\"The primary school is until 12 and then Cycle until 17-18 ( could be 16-18) and then College( which is not college\"university\" as in the States but 11th and 12th grade (US)or lower and upper sixth form ( UK) : you have to have good grades to get into College /4 and above ! Good in French & Math !\n\n\"When you are in this region, Arve et Lac , it’s always near where you live , so either Calvin or Candolle( which is near where she lived) ! But Calvin takes students who will do Latin\" .\n\nhttp://www.cagi.ch/uploads/pdf/Le_sy...e_Genevois.pdf\n\nI'm going to assume that as you're in Geneva you have at least basic french, the link above explains things clearly.\n\nQuick resume;\n\n4-12 the child is in Primary (depending on the size of the school buildings they may be moved to a different school nearby at 8).\n\n12-15 the child moves to a Cycle d'orientation where they are 'streamed' for certain lessons depending on their chosen career path.\n\n15-19 the child has a choice of three paths, Collège.... sometimes in preparation for university. Culture Générale..... pupils wishing to go into social services, some teaching subjects, nursing, and apprenticeships that require a higher level of general education than the more 'physical' apprenticeships.\n\nApprenticeships.\n\n19+ University or apprenticeship after Culture Générale (CG).\n\nNB; college involves entrance exams and many pupils drop out within the first year, usually transferring to CG or starting an apprenticeship* instead.\n\n*There is no stigma attached to anyone doing an apprenticeship, here it is not considered a sign of 'academic failure', nor are apprentices looked down upon by their peers.\n\nIt is also quite normal for someone to change direction and re-train for a different career in their twenties or thirties, the fees involved in returning to college/university or doing an apprenticeship in these cases are covered by the taxes paid during their previous working life. And there are some grants, etc. to cover living costs, unemployment benefits can also occasionally be extended to cover the re-education period."
