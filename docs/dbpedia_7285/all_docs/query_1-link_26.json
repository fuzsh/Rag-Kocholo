        "text": "Welcome to Geneva\n\nGreetings from The Geneva School!\n\nWe are honored that you chose to explore a Geneva education. It is a privilege and joy for me to show you what a Christian classical education looks like at Geneva and explain why this model works.\n\nOne goal of Geneva’s admission process is to create a community of families who are unified around the kind of educational experience they desire for their children. We believe this creates a vibrant environment where lasting relationships are formed and meaningful learning occurs.\n\nGeneva is seeking families who …\n\nshare beliefs and goals similar to those identified in the school’s statement of faith and philosophy of education.\n\nseek to be part of a positive and intentional community of faith and learning, where relationships with faculty, staff, students, and other parents are valued.\n\ndesire unity in the kind of education they want for their child(ren), but who are also diverse in background, talents, and interests.\n\nguide their child(ren) to Christ at home and through active involvement in a local church.\n\nvalue excellence and whose child(ren) are able to flourish academically at The Geneva School, while actively participating in community life.\n\nInspiring students to love beauty, think deeply, and pursue Christ’s calling will grow a generation of students who are confident to face challenges with grace, determination, and hope, reflecting the kind of community that Geneva has been to them.\n\nBeginning November 1, we accept and process applications for the following school year. If you would like to visit our campus, please submit this form to share your information with me. In the meantime, please explore our website to help you discover more about Geneva.\n\nWarmly,\n\nTam Costar\n\nDirector of Admission\n\nSchedule tour\n\nPhoto galleries of lower and upper school buildings\n\nUpper school profile\n\nFollow us on Social Media:\n\nFacebook / Instagram / Twitter\n\nHave Questions?
