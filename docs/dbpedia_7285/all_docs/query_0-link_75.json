        "text": "From the Head of School\n\nI have the privilege of serving as Geneva’s head of school. It is an honor to be at the helm of an institution that has such a proud and well-deserved legacy formed by a faculty, staff, and board committed to fulfilling the school’s mission with excellence. The Geneva School is the third Christian classical school I have been blessed to serve.\n\nIn my twenty-five years in education, I have served as a teacher, program director, and head of school. I love being in schools like ours where students are transformed through engagement with classical texts and timeless discussions. And, through the influence of their teachers and coaches, students here are encouraged to be women and men of virtue.\n\nThe Christian classical approach to education seeks to develop the mind, body, and soul of each student. Education that focuses on skills or intelligence without consideration to virtue are prone to producing, as C.S. Lewis famously stated, “Men without Chests.” These are people who give the impression of being smart but in reality “their heads are no bigger than the ordinary; it is the atrophy of the chest beneath that makes them seem so.”\n\nChurches, communities, and countries need graduates from schools like ours more than ever. Imagine, if you will, what each of these entities will be like when we have a significant number of members and leaders who have\n\nThe ability to think and reason well\n\nSkills to communicate ideas effectively and winsomely\n\nAn infectious love for learning\n\nA desire to serve others\n\nGod is using this place to prepare future generations to lead for Christ’s cause wherever they may find themselves.\n\nIn addition to serving as a school administrator, I am also the father of three graduates of a Christian classical school. Like most parents of such graduates, I am pleased to see how this education has shaped each to be women and men marked by thoughtfulness, hard work, and humility.\n\nI hope you will get to know Geneva through this site. However, the best way to learn about our school and the wonders of Christian classical education is to see us in action. We invite all who are interested to visit our campus.\n\nBrad Ryden, Head of School"
