        "text": "Why study in Geneva?\n\nAs one of Switzerland’s largest cities, Geneva attracts thousands of foreign students every year. What is it about this city that attracts so many foreign students?\n\nGeneva is very well served in terms of higher education establishments. The city boasts no fewer than ten universities , the majority of which are internationally renowned. These establishments offer prestigious university courses and enable students to obtain diplomas recognized the world over.\n\nGeneva also stands out from other European student cities for its multilingualism. The official language used in the city is French. However, as part of the Swiss Confederation, German, Italian and Romansh are also widely spoken in Geneva.\n\nWhat studies to do in Geneva?\n\nThroughout Switzerland, higher education is divided into two types of institution.\n\nFirst, there are the universities of applied sciences , which specialize in :\n\nmanagement ;\n\nnatural sciences;\n\nengineering ;\n\narchitecture;\n\nthe law ;\n\ninternational relations.\n\nThen there are the private schools, which provide training in much more practical areas. The courses offered by these establishments include hotel management.\n\nWhere to stay in Geneva during your studies?\n\nGeneva is a student city. As a result, the city has a wide range of facilities to accommodate students.\n\nIn Geneva, students have the option of staying in university residences or on the city’s campuses. The OMNES Education Group also has a campus in Geneva.\n\nHowever, you should be aware that places are quite expensive in the city’s halls of residence and campuses. Rent is around 470 euros per month.\n\nAnd when it comes to renting a studio or apartment in the city, prices are even higher. Generally, the rates are between 500 and 1400 euros.\n\nDo I need a visa to study in Geneva?\n\nValidation of the application by a Geneva university automatically grants student status. However, to enter Switzerland, you need a student visa.\n\nThe student visa serves not only as a ticket to enter the country, but also as a residence permit. Thanks to this, foreign students will be able to stay in the country during their studies, and even work legally.\n\nHow do I enroll in a top school in Geneva?\n\nThe procedure for enrolling in a Geneva school is relatively straightforward, even for foreign students.\n\nFirst, you need to find out about the various admission criteria on the schools’ websites, then submit an application to the school of your choice. Applications can be submitted either by post or online via the school’s website.\n\nHowever, admission to Geneva ‘s establishments has its own particularities. Some establishments may require a “maturité fédérale” diploma to determine eligibility for training.\n\nWhat are the specific criteria for studying in Geneva?\n\nFirst of all, in order to enter the training programs offered by universities in Geneva, you need to meet the admission requirements.\n\nSecondly, you need to be fluent in the city’s official language, French. However, it’s a good idea to master the other languages used in Switzerland (Italian and German) if you want to be able to communicate easily with the local population.\n\nThe cost of living is very high in Switzerland. In Geneva , as in the country’s other major cities, almost everything is expensive. You must therefore have sufficient financial resources to live and study in the city."
