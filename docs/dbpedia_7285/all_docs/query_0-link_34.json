        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Clancy & Theys Florida Division is proud to announce its partnership with The Geneva School to add a new K-8 coeducational classroom building that will serve lower-level learning on the beautifully existing Geneva School campus located in Casselberry, FL.\n\nThe Geneva School is a private, college-preparatory school that provides a Classical Christian education to its students. In 2019, Clancy & Theys completed construction on the upper-class campus. The exterior design incorporates classical architectural details and proportions found in European colleges to reflect the Geneva Schoolâ€™s academic solid philosophy. The school was designed and constructed to be a modern, 21st-century learning environment with flexible learning labs that promote project-based learning.\n\nPhase III of construction will include a new 53,510 SF flexible academic building designed for lower grades and a 28,360 SF competitive gymnasium. The campus will undergo an extensive update to the main entrance and a parking lot expansion.\n\nClancy & Theys is honored to help The Geneva School build an environment that will inspire students to learn for life."
