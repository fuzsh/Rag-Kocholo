When we stepped through the doors of Geneva several years ago, we were thrilled to find a rare gem -- a place where \"old school\" academics (writing in cursive, practicing violin, memorizing Bible verses, etc.) and values intermingle with the exciting opportunities and activities the new school campus provides. Look beyond the gorgeous new facility, however, and you'll find a raw, real, authentic community. Moms form Bible studies and have dinner get-togethers, book clubs, and more. Tons of school dads participate in field trips and in-class events. Grandparents are invited onto the campus. Teachers truly care for their students -- their hearts, not just their minds. When a need within the school arises however small as an ask for prayer, or a bit like a rental home because a hurricane took yours, the community rallies and responds without hesitation. Simply put, Geneva is a family! Students at Geneva do not blend in or are treated like just a number. They are valued, loved, encouraged, instructed with the highest quality education, and instilled with character traits that will take them far! We are so thankful.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Geneva Parent\n\n5\n\nOur family has been a part of the Geneva community for the past 13 years. We were looking for a rigorous academic with a loving environment for our children when we first started Geneva-we found that and so much more here. We have had first-hand experience with amazing teachers that treat our children like their own. They desire the best for our children. They have a passion for education and for teaching children about Christ. Geneva is growing with new buildings and more athletics but I love that the administration truly values keeping a strong Christian Classical education. This type of education has been instrumental in giving my children a love of learning and seeking truth. We could not be happier with the education our children are receiving. Thank you Geneva for pouring into our children every day.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Joe J.\n\n5\n\nWe really can not say enough about The Geneva School. Our three children have each attended since PreK. The faculty and staff truly walk the walk and talk the talk of living a life for Christ. They are kind and loving and guide my children in a tender loving way. They have instilled a love of learning and exploration in all things. The community of families is one you will not find anywhere. It has been such a blessing to be around other families for the past 9 years that are committed to raising children that love Jesus. The academics are challenging and my children have each been raised up by the challenge. I am grateful everyday for this incredible education that my children are receiving.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Christine\n\n5\n\nI have been a part of the Geneva School Community for eight years. The school offers a top-quality Classical Christian curriculum alongside faculty and administration who have a passion for guiding and teaching children to be gracious, articulate speakers and leaders. The school is intentional in all of its educational and character-building pursuits. Geneva is not only a loving and nurturing \"place of grace\", but also excels at preparing our children for success in the real world.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Austin\n\n5\n\nWe found The Geneva School when one of their students came to our youth group. When I heard of all the wonderful things they offer for their students we had to tour the school! In that small tour I was hooked. I saw students engaged, teachers who visibly loved their jobs and a staff of friendly, smiling faces. We are now 4 years in, 2 kids and a third will start K4 in the fall ,and still as (actually more) in love with the school as we were during the first tour. My kids are learning to \"love learning\". They come home excited from school everyday. They are sad if they are sick and can`t go. They are experiencing their school journey with joy,love,kindness patience and so much more from the teachers,staff and administration at Geneva. Call, take a tour, I know you`ll fall in love as well!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Erin G\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School is truly a unique learning environment! The classical education model is far superior to anything I've personally experienced and the people God has called to teach at this school have all exceeded my expectations. My children's love of learning just seems to be strengthened year after year. Fostering community within the school has always been a priority and it shows in the friendships between the kids as well as the parents. You don't just attend The Geneva School, you belong at The Geneva School.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Geneva School Parent\n\n5\n\nWe're in our 3rd year at Geneva and absolutely love this school and love the people here. My 6th grader and my 3rd grader both love their teachers and feel loved in returned. Geneva teaches my children how to think independently and how to work through problems rather than get discouraged and shut-down. It also teaches them that it's OK to be an individual and to have their own ideas and perspectives. This is not a school that produces robots. I have seen my children ask questions that adults don't ask. I love the relationship between student and teacher. The teachers are loving but firm, and the children respect them for it. They also have a healthy understanding that children are still children. Play-time is needed for children to function at their very best potential. We love Geneva and have no intention of sending our children anywhere else!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Erin R.\n\n5\n\nWe transitioned to The Geneva School from public school and have never looked back! The Geneva School has been wonderful for both of our daughters (grades 4 and 6). The curriculum is engaging and rigorous- the perfect balance of challenging but not stressful. The teachers are loving and caring about each individual student. The leadership is outstanding and each decision is intentional and purposeful. We have been so blessed by The Geneva School and we HIGHLY recommend it!!\n\n- Posted by Parent - A happy parent\n\n5\n\nI have twin senior boys and a freshman daughter at the Geneva school. They are all incredibly different and yet Geneva has been the perfect school for all of them. The deep discussions they have at school often spill over into our dinner table. In addition , each of my kids has played on athletic teams that have gone to state or regionals. If they went to a larger school, they may not have had that opportunity. While my mama heart breaks that my twins will be leaving Geneva after this year, they are so well equipped for college. Choosing The Geneva School was one of the best parenting decisions we have made.\n\n- Posted by Parent - trishad\n\n5\n\nAfter homeschooling for 3 years, I knew my children needed and deserved more. Although I have a masters in education, my children needed more in math and science. We have been at The Geneva School for almost 7 years. I have made a lot of mistakes in parenting, but making the decision to send our kids to TGS has been one of the best decisions my husband and I could have ever made - both for their academic futures and more importantly, for their growth and development in their walk with Jesus Christ. Finding The Geneva School was a dream come true!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Jeannie G\n\n5\n\nI have been a Geneva Parent for 14 years and counting. Throughout those 14 years I have been continually amazed by the teachers, faculty, staff, students and TGS community. They all pour into our children, developing not only their minds, but their hearts. Teaching them not what to think, but how to think. Geneva's mission statement is to provide an extraordinary education, that pursues goodness and truth in all spheres of life. Geneva not only meets but exceeds it's mission statement. Our family has been so blessed by the TGS community. If you are thinking of checking out a Classical Christian School, please take a tour of The Geneva School. It is an amazing place.\n\n- Posted by Parent - chere\n\n5\n\nA unique school that teaches from the classical christian model. They develop the whole child (mind, body and spirit). Arts are excellent, athletics are competitive. Academics are outstanding and staff is extraordinary. They immerse children in learning and challenge them to think and live on a higher level. We tried every available method (homeschool, charter, public, private) over 15 years and 4 children. We came back to Geneva thoroughly convinced they are head and shoulders above anything else in Central Florida. Take a tour of our hidden gem and see how school should be done!\n\n- Posted by Parent - pkeep\n\n5\n\nWe started out with our child in an A rated public school. We had a terrible experience. She would cry every day because she did not want to go to school. Her teacher yelled at them and they rarely received recess because the class was so bad. They had to sit inside with their heads down for playtime. They were doing standardized testing 6 weeks in. They were not doing phonics, only 100 plus sight words to memorize. She hated school and learning. We are so thankful that we found The Geneva School. I fell in love the day I took a tour of the facility. We pulled our daughter out after 3 months in public school and enrolled her at The Geneva School. We immediately saw a change and improvement in her. After her very first day, she said it was her favorite place and she never wanted to go back to her old school. And they were even able to play outside, twice in one day! The teachers and staff are beyond amazing! They care so much about each child. My daughter is now reading and learning Spanish! She cries when she doesn't go to school. The Geneva School has dramatically changed our lives for the better. It is worth every penny.\n\n- Posted by Parent - sbald\n\n5\n\nWhen we started at the Geneva School, we were going through a difficult family transition. Although I knew that the school had a strong academic program, my primary concern was leaving my young children in the hands of loving, nurturing teachers. We are now in our seventh year at the school. It is a beautiful and unique experience that I believe is hard to find at any other school in the area. My children have been taught to love learning, love their neighbor, and love God. They come alive in the back seat telling me about what they are learning. The teachers pour into their students in a way that will leave you forever grateful. I felt compelled to leave a review for our wonderful school! In my eyes, a Geneva School education is the best gift I can give my children.\n\n- Posted by Parent - tmuff\n\n5\n\nOur two boys have been attending The Geneva School for over two years now, and we are very happy with the education they are receiving. Three things stand out about The Geneva School: First, the teachers are well educated and completely dedicated to providing the best education they can. Second, the curriculum is organized around a principled approach that ties together history, science, and the humanities in a way that allows the students to see connections that they normally would not see at this age. Third, and finally, being smart and loving to learn is \"cool\" at The Geneva School, without, however, creating a \"pressure cooker\" atmosphere. Instead, everyone's strengths are acknowledged, and any weakness addressed in a kind and supportive manner by everyone, from the Principal and the Dean of Students, through the teachers and staff, and ultimately by the fellow students. I couldn't imagine a better environment for learning! I went to an excellent school, and I often wish that I could have gone to the Geneva School instead!\n\n- Posted by Parent - flori\n\n5\n\nMy children are attending Geneva this year for the first time. We are new to Florida and didn't have a great experience with the public schools. Upon entering the doors of Geneva I knew God had led us there. The staff is unbelievable and available always! From the first day my children were welcomed and loved as if they''d been there all along. The classical education integrated with the bible that then crosses all subjects is just amazing. My children love The Geneva school and we do too. We know that here they can truly become the amazing people that God made them to be.\n\n- Posted by Parent - amand\n\n5\n\nMy daughters have been going to Geneva for almost 6 years. The caliber of teachers and the substance of the school curriculum have kept us coming back. We also love the size of the school with regard to the number of children. It has enabled us to get to know the parents of other children in my daughters'' classes. Their emphasis on the Bible as well as historical happenings of both the world and our country will enable my children to have a much broader perspective about life than just their own experiences. We love The Geneva School.\n\n- Posted by Parent - TCost\n\n5\n\nThe best education in Central FL (and beyond) for sure. From K-4 to 12th grade, Geneva surrounds its students with impeccable faculty and staff. With its integrated curriculum, we are thrilled with what our children are learning and how they are learning. As for sports, we are ranked 12th overall in the state in our division. Out of 120+ schools, we have some talent!\n\n- Posted by Parent - shell\n\nEndorse The Geneva School. Endorsements should be a few sentences in length. Please include any comments on:\n\nQuality of academic programs, teachers, and facilities\n\nAvailability of music, art, sports and other extracurricular activities\n\nAcademic or athletic awards"
