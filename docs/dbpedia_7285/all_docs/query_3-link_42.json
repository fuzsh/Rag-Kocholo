        "text": "Sending your child to school can be difficult when considering the varying school types and curriculum models. As it may be clearer to distinguish a public school from a private or charter school, have you wondered what makes a private school private? Do you want to better distinguish a private school from the Montessori method of education ? We explore the main components of a private school and discuss if Montessori schools are considered private.\n\nWhat Makes a Private School Private?\n\nPrivate Funding through Tuition\n\nNotorious for high costs and fees , private school tuition costs can sometimes feel equal to college tuition compared to public schools .\n\nWhile parents may feel as though the costs are unnecessarily high, it is essential to know that private schools do not receive the government funding that public schools are entitled to. Furthermore, some private schools will offer generous financial aid packages, making it more affordable for families experiencing various financial burdens.\n\nExtended Extracurricular Activities\n\nAs private school funding derives from the parents and occasional grants, this can cause fewer budgeting issues that result in department cuts like arts and music and allow better elective programs. As a result, private schools can offer a greater variety of extracurricular activities and after-school clubs to stimulate student involvement.\n\nTailored Curriculums\n\nAs private schools are not federally funded, they have greater flexibility in tailoring their curriculums to their preferences, so long as they adhere to some state guidelines imposed by the U.S. Department of Education .\n\nDedicated Teachers and Lower Student-to-Teacher Ratios\n\nIn 2007, the Fraser Institute completed a survey to inquire why parents enrolled their children in private schools . An overwhelming 91% of parents who partook in the survey answered that the teachers' dedication was their main reason for opting for private school over public school.\n\nInstructors at private schools are both qualified and passionate about their subjects, often holding advanced degrees in their field. Furthermore, in tandem with a lower student-to-teacher ratio, class instructors can better tailor each student's curriculum to excel and understand the materials presented. Doing so establishes additional opportunities for private schools to specialize in different fields and prepare students for college.\n\nIs Montessori a Private School?\n\nIn short, yes, Montessori schools are commonly classified as private schools. However, Montessori schools can be independent, funded by tuition, or the public, funded by public money. Furthermore, some tuition-based schools use philanthropic support and public subsidies to serve low-income populations.\n\nIf you want to ensure that a private school prepares your child with fundamental and environmental knowledge, Montessori schools are a profitable learning method. One distinguishing component between Montessori learning and other private schools is that they differ from traditional school methods by focusing on philosophical, environmental, and purpose-driven activities that further your childâ€™s educational experience .\n\nTrust Mansio Montessori: Keeping your Children Safe and Healthy as They Learn\n\nOur staff understands the importance of keeping your children healthy and safe as they learn and develop their social skills.
