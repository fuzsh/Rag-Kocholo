        "text": "Webster Geneva Campus has been a Swiss nonprofit educational foundation, Fondation Webster, since 1978. It was established by Webster University, a private, nonprofit, student-focused university founded in the U.S. in 1915. Webster Geneva Campus provides teaching, research and service in several disciplines at the Undergraduate (bachelor) and Graduate (master) levels at our campus in Bellevue, Geneva.\n\nWebster Geneva Campus’s vision, to become a premier international university, setting a distinct standard for global education opportunities, is built on a foundation of excellence in teaching, enhanced by international perspectives to foster dialogue, respect and understanding across boundaries and between peoples. The institution is committed to offering students a distinct personal experience and providing the resources required to allow them to be transformed for global citizenship and individual excellence.\n\nIn the American liberal arts tradition, all of Webster Geneva Campus’s undergraduate degree programs include a liberal arts core of courses (developing a set of knowledge, competencies and skills across all bachelor degree programs) called the Global Citizenship Program (GCP), which represents about 25% of the student's total credits in the bachelor degree. The GCP introduces all undergraduate students to modes of scientific inquiry and academic research and educates them on issues of ethics, diversity and sustainability, so that they emerge as individuals who are critically aware of the role they play in shaping the world around them.\n\nResearch and creativity are essential activities at Webster Geneva Campus for faculty and students. Our scholarly and creative work contributes to building knowledge, enhances our understanding of the world and human experience, and increases the institutional visibility and academic reputation of Webster Geneva Campus. Research and creative projects are published in books or recognized peer-reviewed journals, presented at academic conferences, and submitted to juried competitions. Our faculty guide students in their research projects, including a Scholars Program which fosters a culture of research among bachelor students.\n\nWebster Geneva Campus also opens its doors to the Geneva and Swiss communities through dozens of free public events each year — from academic conferences to panels of expert speakers and workshops — on a range of topics across business and technology, international affairs, psychology, media communications and the arts. Our campus connects further with the local Swiss community and with the organizations and actors that comprise Genève Internationale, through various co-sponsored events, research projects and student volunteer activities.\n\nWebster University (worldwide) comprises an global network of faculty, staff, students and alumni, with 13,000 students studying on campuses in countries (in North America, Europe and Asia) as well as through online courses and degree programs. As part of the global network Webster Geneva Campus also hosts dozens of Study Abroad students for a term or semester from across the Webster University network of campuses and other university partners.\n\nWebster Mission\n\n“At Webster Geneva Campus, we provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in a globally interconnected world: to evaluate different perspectives, interact with diverse communities, and act responsibly.”\n\nRyan Guffey, PhD\n\nDirector, Webster Geneva Campus\n\nMission\n\nWebster University, a worldwide institution, ensures high-quality learning experiences that transform students for global citizenship and individual excellence.\n\nVision\n\nWebster Geneva Campus' vision sets a distinct standard for global education, built on a foundation of excellence in teaching and enhanced by an international perspective that fosters dialogue, respect and understanding across boundaries and between peoples. The institution is committed to offering students a distinct personal experience and providing the resources required to allow them to be transformed for global citizenship and individual excellence.\n\nWebster University Core Values\n\nStudents\n\nBy sustaining a personalized approach to global, student-centered education through small classes, close relationships with faculty and staff, and attention to student life.\n\nAt Webster Geneva Campus, we support each individual student in their aspiration to excel. This includes various academic resources, from a Scholars' Program designed to inspire, mentor motivate the school's highest academic performers to programs and services that enhance academic achievement of students at every level. Excellence is also encouraged in character development through participation in co-curricular activities, including an optional Webster LEADS program, which earns a Leadership Certificate upon successful completion.\n\nOn Webster Geneva Campus' residential campus, students are surrounded by a supportive and collegial community that provides individual attention through small class sizes. Students build close relationships with faculty and staff, and the campus provides aspects of student life that encourages community engagement from each student.\n\nLearning\n\nBy developing educational programs that join theory and practice, provide an international perspective, encourage creativity and scholarship, and foster a lifelong desire to learn and actively serve communities and the world.\n\nAt Webster Geneva Campus, students learn in a global context. We have students representing up to 90 distinct nationalities and a faculty whose citizenship (and/or origins) span about 25 countries. Students studying at Webster in Switzerland benefit from a worldwide network of Webster campuses that allows for exciting study abroad opportunities, while offering a unified academic experience, firmly grounded in Webster’s educational philosophy.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nBy creating an environment accessible to individuals of diverse cultures, ages, and socioeconomic backgrounds and instilling in students a respect for diversity and an understanding of their own and others' values.\n\nWebster Geneva Campus is a learning environment that welcomes individuals from diverse cultures, ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. As a diverse, gender-inclusive campus, we support critical conversations about how a spirit of inclusion is embedded in the concept of global citizenship. We aim to instill in students a respect for diversity and an understanding of their own and others' values, where:\n\nDiversity embraces all human differences while building on the commonalities. It serves to eliminate discrimination and exclusion based on race, color, creed, national origin, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, disability, religion or military status; and\n\nInclusion affords faculty, staff, students and community partners the opportunity to participate, regardless of differences. It is being included in activities and the chance to participate using one's abilities in day-to-day activities as a member of the community.\n\nGlobal Citizenship\n\nBy educating a diverse population locally, nationally and internationally, acting responsibly toward the environment to foster a sustainable future, and strengthening the communities where we serve.\n\nWebster's core curriculum, called the Global Citizenship Program, is required of all bachelor students at Webster Geneva Campus, and is designed to support the development of global citizenship.\n\nCreativity and Innovation\n\nBy investing in innovative scholarly and creative projects that advance the intellectual and social impact of basic and applied research or creative activity.\n\nEngaging in innovative research and creative works to make a positive impact on the world around us is an important tenet of the culture of Webster Geneva Campus and the output of our faculty. The practical application of theoretical knowledge is not only a central practice of our teaching faculty, but an important aspect of our scholarly productivity.\n\nOver the years, our proximity to international organizations has allowed us to develop practical expertise and to contribute to knowledge regarding the real world and major global challenges and issues, such as sustainability, conflicts, migration, geopolitical dynamics, and global economic development. Research also provides the base for collaborative work with local and international communities in the areas of psychology and counseling, health care, human rights, refugee and migration studies, and international affairs.\n\nA detailed accreditation statement for can be found on the main Webster University news website.\n\nQuality Assurance\n\nIn addition to the accreditations listed below, each of which conducts an external and independent audit and assessment of the quality of our university and/or specific programs, Webster Geneva Campus has a comprehensive, campus-wide system that covers all aspects of our academic activities and operations, including teaching, research and service.\n\nSee our Quality Assurance page for further details.\n\nInstitutional Accreditation\n\nWebster University carries full institutional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The HLC is the highest-level accrediting agency for universities based in the north-central region of the United States. Webster University has maintained this accreditation since 1925, and this institutional accreditation applies for all locations where the University offers programs, worldwide. Students at Webster Geneva Campus therefore earn the same degree that is awarded in the United States.\n\nWebster University is pleased to announce that in 2018 it has earned its re-accreditation from the HLC. This process included a site visit to the Geneva campus by a member of the HLC review team.\n\nThe next Reaffirmation of Accreditation will take place in 2027-28.\n\nLink to Webster's HLC accreditation (scroll for international campus locations) >>\n\nLearn more about the HLC and how US accreditation works >>\n\nProgram Accreditations\n\nOur Business and Management programs offered by the Walker School of Business and Technology at Webster Geneva Campus are accredited by ACBSP (Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs). This accreditation supports our efforts in assuring quality standards and assurance of learning.\n\nOur Master of Arts in Counselling is fully accredited by the Swiss Association for Counselling (referred to as Association Suisse de Conseil, in French and Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Beratung, SGfB, in Swiss German).
