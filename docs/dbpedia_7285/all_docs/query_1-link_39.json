        "text": "Inspiring students in K4–12th grade to love beauty, think deeply, and pursue Christ’s calling.\n\nEducation is always about formation. It shapes the mind and affections of students, teaching them what is worth thinking and loving. Not all educational models aspire to these same ends of faith and character development in addition to academic excellence. The model at The Geneva School is built on the bedrock of historic Christianity.\n\nOur teachers seek to embody the truths that they present not only through teaching that engages all the senses but also through lives that demonstrate their own commitment to and love for their students, each other, and the God they seek to serve. Subjects are integrated historically, thematically, and developmentally, while always flowing from or leading to the truths of Scripture. The curriculum from K4–12 is vibrant and life-affirming, fostering dialogue between and among the students, teachers, and administrators. The aim of this curriculum is to cultivate a love of learning.\n\nA goal of The Geneva School is to educate the whole child: mind, body, and soul. We recognize there is a great kingdom calling on every life, and we take seriously the opportunity to shape a child for his or her calling. The Geneva School not only aims to equip students for college but also to instill in them a lifelong love of learning and delight in God’s truth that will enable them to flourish in life and their chosen vocation.\n\nThe admission office welcomes the opportunity to guide you on your journey to learn about our school and the distinctives of Christian classical education! Please peruse our website, watch our videos, and come take a tour: this will give you a glimpse into the many unique aspects of our community of faith and learning.\n\nIt would be our pleasure to share more with you about the gift of a Geneva education.\n\nHave Questions?
