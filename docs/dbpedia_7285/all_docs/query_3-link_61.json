        "text": "You’ll need: slippers, basanes, painting apron, a change of clothes. Also in some school: a box of tissues\n\nYou don’t need to buy any books, notebooks, crayons, glue, scissors etc. – such equipment is provided by the schools.\n\nDoes your child need a backpack?\n\nYes. But not a big backapack for heavy contents. Any light backpack that can easily hold an a4 folder will do!\n\nThings that they will carry in the backpack are:\n\na snack-box,\n\na water bottle aka “la gourde”,\n\nand the a4 sized folder aka “la fourre”.\n\na communication notebook (carnet de l’élève)\n\nAll books, notebooks, crayons etc. stay at school.\n\nYou will get a teacher-parent communication book also called a students book (carnet de l’élève) with all necessary explanations, addresses, and phone numbers. Further pages constitute an agenda. Each day of the school year has its place, where teachers and parents can put important information. At the bottom of the page you’ll find space to request a meeting with the teacher (or teacher’s request to meet with you). You’ll need to sign the book every week. I promise, It will become clear once you get it in your hands.\n\nIn the first weeks of the school year you will also receive some forms to fill (mainly asking about address, phone numbers, special health issues, languages spoken etc). Nothing complicated.\n\nDon’t be afraid if your child doesn’t speak French.\n\nMost probably, he/she won’t be the only one in the classroom. Teachers in Geneva are experienced and used to working with allophone children (allophone is french for not speaking French).\n\nGrades 1-3P are very playful year, perfect to learn the language! Those joining later will be for half a day in their regular class, and half a day at a French-for-foreigners class.\n\nIf you do think your child will do better with some additional help, you can try a kids’ French course in one of the language schools, for example playful Spell Languages (offering both group and private lessons, as well as full weeks during school holidays)."
