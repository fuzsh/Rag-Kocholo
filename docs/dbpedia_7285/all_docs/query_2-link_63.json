        "text": "Research CentRE\n\nNetwork for International Policies and Cooperation in Education and Training (NORRAG)\n\nNORRAG is a global network of over 5,000 members for international policies and cooperation in education and training. NORRAG is an offshoot of the Research, Review, and Advisory Group (RRAG) established in 1977 and at the time funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and Swedish International Development Authority (Sida). It was charged with critically reviewing and disseminating education research related to the developing world. The current name was adopted in 1986 and NORRAG is now mainly supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). NORRAG is a research centre of the Geneva Graduate Institute.\n\nNORRAG’s strength lies in addressing under-researched questions of quality and equity in key issues in education and development, and in amplifying under-represented expertise particularly from the South. NORRAG’s core mandate is to produce, disseminate and broker critical knowledge, and to build capacity for and with the wide range of stakeholders who constitute it. Its stakeholders from academia, governments, NGOs, international organisations, foundations and the private sector inform and shape education policies and practice at national and international levels. Through its work, NORRAG contributes to creating the conditions for more participatory, evidence-informed decisions that improve equal access to and quality of education and training.\n\nNORRAG seeks to actively participate in the creation of the conditions for more participatory, evidence-informed policy decisions that improve equal access to quality education. NORRAG supports public, private and voluntary sectors and academia worldwide in its common goal to improve equitable and quality education and learning outcomes for the learners and societies that are at the centre of all education policy and practice.\n\nNORRAG undertakes projects in four thematic priority areas which need more and better contextualised research and knowledge, policy dialogue and capacity building. A fifth set of transversal activities relates to ensuring NORRAG’s institutional sustainability.\n\nHow candata and evidence support the inclusion of marginalised groups?\n\nHow canquality, equitable education overlay and intersect with other SDGs?\n\nHow caninnovations and disruptions improve access, equity and quality in education?\n\nHow canprivate sector approaches improve equitable access to quality education?\n\nNORRAG co-produces, mobilises and disseminates quality research and evidence on education and development in order to help reduce uncertainty for policy makers, planners, practitioners and researchers. Surfacing and amplifying under-represented expertise, particularly from the South, helps to generate relevant and contextualised global, regional and national public goods and policy debate. Recognising that evidence use is essentially a relational process underpins our facilitation of policy dialogue in Geneva and worldwide. Building capacityto collect, interpret and use data and evidence helps to improve educational planning, policymaking and practice (see How does NORRAG work).\n\nproject\n\nGlobal Partnership for Education Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (KIX)\n\nThis joint endeavour between NORRAG and the International Development Research Centre aims to connect expertise, innovation and knowledge to support GPE partner countries in building stronger education systems and accelerating progress toward SDG 4. KIX is the largest fund solely dedicated to meet global public good gaps in education. A KIX Peer Learning and Exchange Portal was launched in 2021 to support the initiative.\n\nA few publications\n\nEducation in Times of Climate Change\n\nThis NORRAG Special Issue (NSI 07) addresses the question of how education is to equip learners to participate in climate action that would fundamentally disrupt existing problematic systems. NSI 07 showcases what is currently being done to close the gap between the potential of education to contribute to more a sustainable and just world and the experiences of those in education.\n\nStates of Emergency: Education in the Time of COVID-19\n\nThe sixth edition of NORRAG Special Issue, published in October 2021, seeks to conceptualise the multiple emergencies brought about by COVID-19 as it presents the world not only with a biological and health emergency, but also a political, economic and social emergency intertwined. Read in its entirety, this NORRAG Special Issue highlights the ways in which these emergencies in education are interconnected.\n\nResults-based Financing in Education for Sub-National Government and School Administrators: A Conceptual Framework and Practical Recommendations\n\nThis review (WP no 12, 2021) applies principal-agent theory to explain the causal mechanisms at work in the use of results-based financing (RBF) to improve education service delivery. It uses this theoretical framework to examine RBF interventions to incentivise meso-level actors. For the purpose of this study, meso-level is defined as actors and/or institutions who are in charge of education system management and administration at local government (e.g., province, region, district) or school level, such as district education officers, school management committees and school directors. Research for this review was based on published literature and project documents on meso-level RBF interventions in education systems of low-and middle-income countries.\n\nNew Philanthropy and the Disruption of Global Education\n\nIn this fourth edition of NORRAG Special Issue, 31 articles aim to highlight global and national experiences, as well as diverse perspectives on the role and function of new philanthropy in education. The aim is to expand the debate and foster dialogue, bridge the gap between theory and practice, as well as stimulate new research, advocacy and policy innovation in international education development.\n\nPublic Private Partnerships in Education: A Brief Overview of the Literature\n\nAddressing the education system in South Africa, this paper aims to offer a brief overview of public private philanthropic partnerships in education as described in current academic literature. It further aims to begin the process of deriving principles from this literature to stimulate discussion on how these collaborations might best mitigate social inequalities in education and operate to the advantage of all stakeholders."
