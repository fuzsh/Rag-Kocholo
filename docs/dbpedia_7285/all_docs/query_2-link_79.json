Educational Institutions, be they parochial schools or private colleges usually seek accreditation because they hope that the accreditation will catapult them immediately into the good favor of potential",

        "text": "College accreditation is popularly viewed as a process through which students are ensured a quality education. Acquiring an accreditation status recognized by the federal government is voluntarily chosen by many colleges because they and their students want access to certain government and private funding sources. Research into the value of accreditation has demonstrated conclusively from research and experience that accreditation does not ensure quality (George Leef, Can College Accreditation Live Up to Its Promise?, American Council of Trustees and Alumni, Director of the Pope Center for Higher Education Policy, previous Vice President of the Locke Foundation).\n\nFor the past 25 years, home educating families have ensured the quality education of their children through their personal involvement and free market decisions. New Geneva is encouraging and enabling this same level of quality, which has been demonstrated through achievement testing to be 30 percentage points better than accredited schools.\n\nDuring the last 100 years, institutions of higher education have collaborated with federal and state agencies to limit the awarding of degrees to accredited institutions to protect their market share with the effect of charging a high tuition for a low-quality product. Honest reflection by most college graduates and employers will confirm this. In the pursuit of employment, they can be asked to look beyond the paper degree to learn of the genuine character and ability of the person applying for employment.\n\nThe fact that accreditation gives rise to the secularization and homogenization of even Christian college curricula, is of even more concern to Christian families. Therefore, New Geneva encourages and enables families to accredit the specific programs of their own children. Where accreditation is desired for a program, families can form a review board for each student consisting of the student’s parent(s), pastor(s), academic advisor(s), and professional advisor(s). This essentially combines the value of a graduate school committee, accreditation team, and church leadership under the authority of the parents. Acknowledging the authority of the family and church are key to the highest quality and most effective accreditation.\n\nThe student may invite desirable employers to participate on their review board and choose to pursue apprenticeships, internships, coops, summer employment or entrepreneurship opportunities with their desired employers at any time."
