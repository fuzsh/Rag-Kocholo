        "text": "Hi, we are thinking about a move to Geneva and would welcome some feedback particularly from English speakers as our two children only speak English (currently!). They are 4 and 2 yrs of age.\n\nThe English Geneva School is full at present. I've identified Collegue Du Leman and the International Geneva School as having English language programmes.\n\nAre there any others, perhaps smaller, preschool type of places in or around Geneva?\n\nAlso does anyone have any feedback about the schools I mentioned?\n\nWith regard to accomodation, I suspect it probably depends on which school we pick or perhaps vice versa but are there any areas which are particularly popular with the English speaking community? We are keen to meet people of all nationalities but to help settle the kids it would be good to be near people with whom they could play and talk to etc as the whole move will be very unsettling for them.\n\nIn terms of rent, what should we allow for a 4 bedroom place, difficult to put a figure on it but an approx range would be helpful.\n\nMany thanks!\n\nHello,\n\nI moved here with my daughter a year and a half ago and would like to share my opinions and experiences with you to give you a firsthand perspective. If you want to integrate into this society then you should first find a place to live and you'll then be required to enroll your child in the local public school within that district. Things are very different here, not like what you're accustomed to. My daughter has been here, going to a public school for 8 months, and is now tri-lingual and has many friends. The schools are very small and all about equal (within reason) in providing a quality education and environment. They have a two hour lunch break in which many children walk home for lunch. (and yes, this area is very safe as all children walk to and from to school) Those who do stay at school for lunch get a gourmet meal for 3chf/day. They have a 4 day school week and after school programs. They all learn to swim, ski, and go camping and such. Wedensdays they have no school as this time is used for Dr.'s appointments but this may be changed soon, there is a vote planned. The early years are focused on languages (3 required) and social skills (my daughter's class goes to a restaurant for lunch to practice for the real world). It's not uncommon to see kids on the tram or buses getting around.\n\nSo, don't worry so much about the kids fitting in, work on integrating yourself and they will follow. The housing issue is quite a problem but if you throw enough money at it then you'll find something fairly quickly. Expect to pay twice as much as you want for half the space you need. I live in the Old City and am quite happy here as I hardly use my car. The city is very easy to get around: my door to the airport in 11 min. by tram/ train if you time it right!!!\n\nAll in all, Geneva is a great palce to live and raise a family.(but I'm sure you knew that)\n\nAbout Geneva, Switzerland\n\nSet along the River Rhone with the majestic Alps towering in the background, Geneva commands attention. As the home of the International Red Cross and former home of the League of Nations, the city also possesses a multicultural flair. Indeed, French culture and language are still predominating aspects of Geneva today. Geneva has always exuded a chic superiority. The beautifully manicured city abounds with graceful mansions, gull-laden lakes, cosmopolitan stores, and elite restaurants. The heart of the city is called the rive gauche, which includes the charming old town area. Visitors should take time to stroll the quaint boutiques and galleries along the cobblestone Grand Rue. Also check out the Cathedrale St. Pierre, where John Calvin preached; the Reformation Monument, dedicated to leaders of the Protestant Reformation; and the Jet d'Eau, the highest fountain in Europe.\n\nCall me if you need me...\n\nHello, new to this thread and I think there are a few things which haven't been covered.\n\nFirstly I don't live in Geneva and each area does have a slightly different system.\n\nIn Vaud premiere and second enfantine is not obligatory (this may have changed) which means that the state can not begin to teach children until the first primary when all the towns children will be there so non will be left out. my point is if in your area the first year is not obligatory then your child will be going to school to learn social skills (how to sit down still) how to hold a pencil and other things he/she probably knows already.\n\nLater on when they are about 11 (i think) children are streamed, from what I have managed to gather as information, it is the teachers who decide which school your child will go into. NB. university path is one school, there are two other forms of schools which is where your child is sent according to how they believe they are gifted. if your child fails to shine at 11/12 then thier fate may be sealed. I have known incredibly gifted swiss youths who did not perform at the correct age and when i suggested they go to University they explained that they couldn't because they hadn't attended the right school. if you are only here for a few years then this may not be an issue for you.\n\nI have 5 1/2 year old born here and I chose a private school which is bilingual French/German and he has English at home. His school offers the university path, he goes from 9-4 pm giving me a full day at work 4 1/2 days a week. There are children who have no french and are in his class and have adapted in no time. My son has friends in our community who go to the local school and already I see the difference in the education.\n\nif you are here for a long period.... do your research well. I went to school in the UK and am not fond of private schools but when I saw the level of education offered at the state school for my sons first year, I made my decision.\n\ngood luck"
