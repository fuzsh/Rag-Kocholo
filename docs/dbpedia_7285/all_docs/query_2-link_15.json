        "text": "The classical approach is called, \"classical\" because it dates back to Aristotle and was formalized in the Middle Ages. It is characterized by a whole-child approach to learning, using an integrated curriculum, classical books, art, music, and a formal study of Latin and Logic. In other words, classical education is a rigorous liberal arts education immersed in a Christian worldview.\n\nThe Geneva School seeks to provide a time-proven, exceptional education within a Christian worldview. Our purpose is to glorify Christ by cultivating a love of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Virtue."
