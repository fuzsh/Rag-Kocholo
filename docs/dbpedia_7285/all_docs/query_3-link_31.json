        "text": "When I was a child ,I thought teachers chose writing lines because it was meant to cause physical PAIN. I was an adult by the time I realised writing wasn’t painful for other PEOPle. It something to do with HYPERMOBILITy I GUESS. Neither my sons NOR I can hold a pencil correctly without pain, and my sons have the right to use a keyboard in CLASs because of it. They can type all day.\n\nSo when my son was assigned pages of lines because the whole class was punished I was FURIOus. I asked him to type one line, cut and PASTe and print it, but the teacher specifically said it had to be written by hand .\n\nI said fine, refuse the assignment, I will speak to the head , and they can suspend you if they wish, you will be forced to sit home and play video games and eat pizza instead of attending school for a few days. Sadly He refused, and SAt up for nights in pain working on it. He doesn’t like to be different .\n\nShould the same happen with my youngest son, I can assure you he would most happily take SUSPENSION, as well as a consultation with the children’s law centre to see if he HAd a case against the school. Except that his head of year would stand up for him, she is too kind to do otherwise so it thankfully can’t happen with him.\n\nOverall, their school is brilliant and they have some truly wonderful teachers who have left both boys considering teaching as future careers. So many teachers HAVE truly inspired THEm.\n\nIn addition , while I had a few abusive teachers as a child , the vast majority served as a lifeline for me. I remember one sharing a lunch with me when I had None, so many just trying to get to me to open up, and maybe I should have. Teachers would bring home books from their own homes, one even brought me books. They would sit at lunch or after school and JUST talk to me. A student teacher even took me home for meals, not directly from school as that wasn’t allowed, but I would run home and wait for her at my door. One even bought me SHOES, because mine were ripped and falling apart. There are more wonderful teachers than bad ones. I wouldn’t want to collectively blame them all.\n\nAnd I do realise children can do wicked things too. I know some children torment other children and teachers. BUT the system as it stands is open to abuse. Even as a child, I knew some teachers hated boys , others were what we called creepy, but would be labelled as sexually abusive TODAy. Not many, and the lovely gYM teacher offered to break MR CREEPy’s Arms. After that he was better at keeping his hands where they belonged. And while I OPPOSE collective blame, may I issue a collective thank you to all the teachers like the gym teacher who stood up for students , even against other teachers.\n\nWe can’t change the world. As individual parents we can’t change the system either. But we can make sure our own children have an advocate. We an can and should make sure they know THey can say no to an adult. That they have rights and that we will defend those rights.\n\nFor those who have tried DESperately, and found the school unwilling or unable to safeguard their children, I would strongly recommend reaching out first to head of year, then HeadMistress, or headmaster of there are any of those left, and if all else FAIls contact the education authority and ask for an education welfare officer.\n\nBut I wish we also had something in place for those children whose parents won’t stand up for THEM. For those who parents don’t care."
