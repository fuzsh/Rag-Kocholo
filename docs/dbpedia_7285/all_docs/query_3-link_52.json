        "text": "– By Logan Baker\n\nThe Geneva Watchmaking School, or l’École d'Horlogerie de Genève if tu parles français, is one of the most important institutions dedicated to horological education in the world. Founded in 1824, the Geneva academy is the oldest watchmaking school in all of Switzerland, boasting a list of graduates – Christophe Claret, Roger Dubuis, Franck Muller, and Rexhep Rexhepi are a select few – that reads like a Who’s Who of influential independent watchmakers.\n\nThings are busier than ever at l’École d'Horlogerie de Genève these days. The school currently has more than 300 students and offers training in eight different sectors, including watchmaking, production watchmaking, watchmaking operations, exterior finishing, polishing, micromechanics, quality control, and microtechnology, with degrees taking from two years to six years, depending on the degree path.\n\nStudents take on projects outside the classroom, too. A group of current and retired teachers are currently working alongside some of the students to repair the clock at the Church of the Holy Trinity on Place du Mont-Blanc, in Geneva.\n\nThings are so hectic these days that the Geneva Watchmaking School is currently in the process of moving its campus, based in the Lancy neighborhood of Geneva, to a more modern building in Plan-les-Ouates, the same district that houses operations for prestigious watchmakers such as Patek Philippe, Rolex, Vacheron Constantin, Laurent Ferrier, and Piaget.\n\n“The move aims to provide more training places in an ideally designed learning environment,” Pierre Amstutz, the school’s director, says. “In addition, the school will now be more integrated into the watchmaking ecosystem, which will be very beneficial for our students.”\n\nTo help raise funds to support l’École d'Horlogerie de Genève in all its upcoming endeavors, Phillips in Association with Bacs & Russo is hosted a charity auction later today, Wednesday, August 30, as part of the Geneva Watch Days exhibition, with all proceeds of the sale going toward the educational institution. The auction includes 15 lots, each a unique object or experience that has been donated by one of the brands participating in Geneva Watch Days. It will be hosted and auctioneered by our own Aurel Bacs. You can learn more about the auction here.\n\nThe Geneva Watchmaking School will celebrate its bicentennial next year, during the 2024-2025 school year, with three special events in October 2024 and January and June 2025.\n\n“The history of the Geneva School of Watchmaking is a heritage that we honor, respect, and pass on through our traditions,” Amstutz says. “This heritage drives us to train excellent watchmakers as well as future entrepreneurs.”\n\nIf all the above has you itching to apply, you’ll first need to brush up on your French – all classes are taught in the local tongue – and then you’ll need to pass an entrance examination. Tuition fees are paid by the State, so it helps if you already live or work in the Geneva canton when you apply, as the State Councilor has given priority to Genevan taxpayers, regardless of their nationality or their place of residence in Switzerland or France.\n\nBut once you’re accepted, only the sky is the limit.\n\n“Graduates of l’École d'Horlogerie de Genève benefit from excellent job prospects, always linked to the economic health of the sector,” Amstutz says. “Those who wish to enter the labor market quickly achieve this mainly without difficulty.”\n\nBefore you graduate, you’ll compete with your own school watch, or pièce école, which is a watch that is entirely designed, manufactured, and assembled, by each student while attending the school. Although it’s considered a traditional part of a quality horological education, only a few schools continue the practice. You’ll also benefit from the school’s strong alumni network, with graduates frequently acting as mentors for current students.\n\nStill interested in taking the plunge? Candidates can learn more by visiting l’École d'Horlogerie de Genève online or by email. Just interested in supporting the next generation of watchmakers? You can learn more about the Geneva Watch Days Charity Auction, in support of the Geneva Watchmaking School and auctioneered by Aurel Bacs, right here.\n\nThe Geneva Watch Days Charity Auction will take place at 8:30 PM CET, on Wednesday, August 30, 2023. Doors will open exactly one hour before the auction begins. A printed complete catalog will be available during the auction, in addition to via PDF. The auction will be livestreamed for those unable to attend.\n\nLead image, credit: L’École d'Horlogerie de Genève\n\nAbout Geneva Watch Days 2023\n\nGeneva Watch Days is an industry salon founded in September 2020 by eight prestigious watch brands: Breitling, Bulgari, De Bethune, Girard-Perregaux, H. Moser & Cie., MB&F, Ulysse Nardin and Urwerk. The event is based on a modern and unconventional philosophy that emphasizes cooperation while avoiding complexity. It is an independent and collaborative organization that is self-managed, light, flexible, and agile, providing a common space to showcase the latest in watchmaking, while giving participating brands the opportunity to host decentralized activities. Held in partnership with the Canton and the City of Geneva, with the support of the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, Industry and services (CCIG), the show caters to retailers and media, while being completely open to the public.\n\nThe fourth unforgettable installment of Geneva Watch Days will take place from August 29 to September 2, 2023. This year’s exhibition will be the biggest yet, with nearly 40 watch brands showcasing their latest releases at the Rotonde du Mont-Blanc pavilion on Lake Geneva, as well as at boutiques and venues throughout the city.\n\nAbout Phillips In Association With Bacs & Russo\n\nThe team of specialists at PHILLIPS Watches is dedicated to an uncompromised approach to quality, transparency, and client service.
