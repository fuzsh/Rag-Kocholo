        "text": "My son is currently a kindergartener and has been attending Geneva for the past 4 years. We can’t rave enough about how wonderful of a school Geneva is. All the faculty members and staff care a lot about the students. Geneva cultivates an amazing learning environment and the students there are passionate about school. The small teacher to student ratio also allows the teachers to get to know each student extremely well. The Classical Christian Education at Geneva is unique and it really cultivates a heart of loving God and learning. The students at Geneva uphold moral values and good judgment, which is an important foundation to cope with today’s world. Finally, I also want to mention the Geneva Conservatory of Music. The GCM faculty members are world-class musicians and are another source of caring teachers for the students. We are very grateful for the whole experience at Geneva. Each time others ask us about Geneva, we always highly recommend the school without any reservations."
