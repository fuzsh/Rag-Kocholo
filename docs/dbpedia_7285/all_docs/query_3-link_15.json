        "text": "We teach using the classical method in all subjects. This approach is called, “classical,” because it dates back to Aristotle and was formalized in the Middle Ages. It is characterized by a whole child approach to learning, using an integrated curriculum, classical books, art, and music, and a formal study of Latin and Logic. In other words, classical education is a liberal arts education.\n\nWe teach using the classical method because it is a proven form of education. It is the highest standard of education and has produced many of the world’s greatest thinkers, authors, scientist, inventors and politicians, such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Galileo, Copernicus, Johann Gutenberg, Martin Luther, William Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the rest of our country’s Founding Fathers. Classical education’s developmental wisdom has stood the test of time; it not only creates lifelong learners, but empowers these learners to apply their knowledge in meaningful ways.\n\nPurpose\n\nWe teach to cultivate wisdom and virtue through the classical method. The classically educated Christian does not ask, “What can I do with this learning?” but “What will this learning do to me?” The ultimate end of classical Christian education is to enable the student (disciple) to better know, glorify, and enjoy God. Our enjoyment of God is derived from our ability to see Him and to see His handiwork.\n\nWe teach to nurture our student’s souls. At The Geneva School, learning is not an end in itself. Instead, our teachers ask God to use their knowledge, character, and deeds as instruments in His hand to cultivate the students’ souls toward holiness."
