        "text": "A comprehensive Christian college of the arts, sciences, and professional studies. Teaching from a Reformed perspective, Geneva prepares students to serve Christ in all areas of society.\n\nGeneva College invites students to step forward and leap ahead with an academically excellent, Christ-centered and affordable education. Offering nearly 40 undergraduate majors, Adult Degree Programs with fully online and campus-based options, and high-demand advanced graduate degrees, Geneva's programs are recognized for their high quality. U.S. News & World Report ranks Geneva as a Top 10 Best Value with one of the Top 100 engineering programs in the nation. Adhering to the inerrancy of Scripture, a Geneva education is grounded in God’s word as well as in a core curriculum designed to prepare students vocationally to think, write and communicate well in today’s world.\n\nFounded in the tradition of the Reformed Christian faith, Geneva prepares students to serve Christ in all areas of society: work, family and the church. Geneva is a founding member of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU).\n\nMission and history\n\nGeneva College is a Christ-centered academic community that provides a comprehensive education to equip students for faithful and fruitful service to God and neighbor\n\nFor more than 165 years, Geneva College has shaped the lives and careers of generations of students. On April 20, 1848, Geneva Hall opened in Northwood, Ohio. The school was named in honor of Geneva, Switzerland, center of the Reformed faith movement. Under the sponsorship of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, Geneva moved in 1880 to Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, to a parcel of land donated by the Harmony Society, a German religious group\n\nLocation and facilities\n\nGeneva's beautiful 55-acre campus is located about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. The college’s low student-to-faculty ratio of 13:1 means that its students have access to a wide range of educational resources while still receiving individual attention.\n\nAcademics and activities\n\nAcademics at Geneva are based on a simple assumption: that the world belongs to God. This means that each course at Geneva is an exploration of a particular aspect of life in a world that resounds with God’s grace in Jesus Christ, but which is also affected by human sinfulness. It means that each field of study is an opportunity to pursue God’s calling in learning how to serve wisely and faithfully in God’s world. And, it means that we challenge students every day, in and out of the classroom, to develop keen insight in discerning how life in God’s world is best lived. But academics are just a part of the Geneva College experience. There are also plenty of student organizations and opportunities for spiritual growth, including a student senate, Athletes in Action, the campus newspaper, a marching band, a touring choir, and community service projects. In addition, Geneva is proud of its many recreational programs, as well as the nationally ranked Golden Tornado NCAA Division III varsity teams in football, basketball, volleyball, soccer, baseball, softball, cross country, track and field, and tennis.\n\nFaculty\n\nThe members of the faculty are the heart of Geneva College. Geneva professors are committed to excellence in learning and the development of their students. Plus, all members of the faculty are active Christians who produce integration papers demonstrating how their areas of scholarship are impacted by a Christian worldview. In addition to their superb educational preparation, Geneva professors have real-world experience in their fields—education professors who have been teachers, chemistry professors who have been chemists, and business faculty who have been accountants or have held executive posts. And you will find many faculty members who are actively engaging the culture through research and writing. Professors share this broad range of education and experience with their students to engage them in their fields and to prepare them for life beyond the classroom.\n\nAccreditation and memberships\n\nGeneva College is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, and maintains institutional membership in these organizations:\n\nAmerican Association of Colleges for Teacher Education\n\nAmerican Council on Education\n\nAssociation of Reformed Institutions of Higher Education\n\nBeaver County Council of Higher Learning\n\nCouncil of Christian Colleges and Universities\n\nCollege Entrance Examination Board\n\nCouncil of Independent Colleges\n\nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities\n\nPennsylvania Association of Colleges and Universities\n\nThe Business program is accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).\n\nThe Chemistry program is approved by the American Chemical Society for professional training in chemistry.\n\nThe general Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.\n\nThe M.A. in counseling program is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP).\n\nThe teacher certification program is approved by the education departments of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, and other states.\n\nContacting Geneva"
