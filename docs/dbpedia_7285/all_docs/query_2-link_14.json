We have loved watching our children grow under the guidance of The Geneva School's teachers and staff! Watching them thrive as they are encouraged, challenged, and shaped by their wonderful teachers has been a joy. Knowing that we are supported as we seek to raise them well and that their teachers care so deeply for them is a great comfort. They both love learning and have been trained over the years in study skills so that they are able to truly enjoy the learning process. The breadth and depth of the education they are receiving here, along with the character being inculcated in them will serve them well throughout life. We couldn't be happier.\n\n- Posted by Parent - M Hahne\n\n5\n\nWe absolutely love the Geneva school. Choosing this school was one of the best decisions we made for our family. The quality curriculum, high standard for character, support system, are second to none. We highly recommend parents check this school out for their children.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Katie\n\n5\n\nOur child has gone to Geneva School since kindergarten, and we are so thankful and impressed with the classical education and how the lessons are taught. The teachers are all excellent, creative, caring and fosters a wonderful learning environment. TGS is not only strong in academics but also well rounded in different activities and sound biblical teaching. We love TGS and we hope that the school will be able to extend the grades all to 12th grade!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Parent of 4th grader\n\n5\n\nI have been a fan of classical Christian education for a long time, but The Geneva School exceeds the inherent goods in classical Christian education. My daughters have received models of Christian love and excellence in their teachers and administrators that brings to life all they're learning!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Parent of kindergartener and second grader\n\n5\n\nWe have 2 daughters that attend The Geneva School and they both love it there. We love that it is a safe Christian environment with excellent teachers and staff. Class sizes small and students are given a great education.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Estela Atef\n\n5\n\nWe have been attending the Geneva school for two years now. We are very grateful to have found this school! We really enjoy the smaller classroom sizes, the academic rigor, and the Christian principles reinforced by the teachers. My kids fee challenged but very supported.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Kinder and 2nd grade parenr\n\n5\n\nThis is our second year attending Geneva. We are very grateful for the school! We enjoy the smaller classroom sizes, the academic rigor, and the Christian principles taught and reinforced by the teachers.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Kinder and 2nd\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School not only provides top-notch education but also builds character. I was not familiar with classical education before, but I am now a huge proponent of it. Both of my kids love going to school and the staff is amazing.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Jim\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School has been life-changing for our entire family. This may seem like hyperbole, but we've noticed its excellence in multiple facets.1) Education. Classical teaching is a rarity these days. But its principles have certainly helped our children learn most fully. We came from another private religious school with a fancy curriculum. But despite that, I would hear from my gifted child how bored he was. Because of the school's large class size and varied abilities of the students, they had to be taught to the mean. This isn't a fault of the school and they certainly were trying their best for everyone. But what a difference it's been to be at TGS. He is excited about what they're learning, he's challenged, and I haven't heard that B-word since he's been here. I love that they teach the kids not just what to learn but how to do it, too. He is an independent studier now and is able to memorize and recite not only multiple verses but all the countries in Africa (I\"m still working on this many decades later!). My younger son was able to recognize multiple different artists, composers, and grammatical rules by the end of kindergarten. And his cursive is hard to differentiate from a computer's :). It was astounding how much they are taught, how they rise to TGS' expectations, and how advanced their education is. We rave about this school to everyone we meet.2) Love. This isn't in their motto, but it should be. Love permeates all that is done at TGS. It's palpable, be it in the staff's interactions with the kids, in the faith that is shared, or in the concern that is shown for the school's families. Part of love is sacrifice and discipline and I think this is modeled well for the kids, in a way dedicated to their growth. The teachers are respected and admired.3) Logistics. I appreciate the small class sizes, which allows the teacher the ability to work individually with each student. The reading is challenging but free from themes that may be problematic (unlike other schools). Even PE / recess is innocent -- they love to pogo stick at lunch! It's easy to communicate with the staff and they were very motivated to open in person but to do so in the safest way possible. They have updated their facilities to address best sanitation practices.Clearly, we are acolytes. I was waffling for so long because change is hard, and we wanted to ensure that a new school would be a good fit (plus the unknown is always slightly terrifying, especially with pulling kids out of a place they're comfortable in). But we feel without reservation that this was the BEST decision we've made for our kids and family, and it's changed the trajectory of our lives (truly!). I can't recommend it more highly.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Lauren\n\n5\n\nWe started the Geneva School this year in Mrs Lee's Kindergarten class and we love it. The classical approach to education has really given her a head start to an education. She has already started reading!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Carroll\n\n5\n\nStrong academic curriculum, Christ-centered environment, and incomparable faculty and staff-from the head of school and principal, to all the teachers. There`s a genuine commitment to each student`s education and spiritual development at Geneva. Small classroom sizes are notable, as teachers are able to quickly realize every student`s ability and give individualized attention. Highly recommend this school and would encourage interested parents to have their child shadow for a day.\n\n- Posted by Parent - 4th grade parent\n\n5\n\nIn addition to honoring God, the Geneva School has amazing teachers and a desirable education. The Geneva School would be a good place to consider supporting. New students from all grades come here will get the best support and most kindly care, I have 3 kids here and they love to school every day! We are so lucky to find the Geneva school!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Kyra\n\n5\n\nOver the past 15 years, our family has experienced private schools, public schools, homeschooling, and homeschooling hybrids. This is our third year at The Geneva School, and we couldn't be more grateful for the education our three youngest children are receiving. My sons are engaged and excited by the rich and superior curriculum, that helps them to make connections across subjects, and if hard to find. The small class sizes mean that no student gets lost in the shuffle and each student becomes an active participant in class learning. All work is graded so students are able to quickly see their mistakes and can correct their work. Since coming to The Geneva School, we have seen our sons improve in all subjects and regain their enthusiasm for learning. All of the teachers we've had have been superb!!! They are faith-filled and nurturing, while simultaneously setting a high bar that the students want to aspire towards. The classroom environment is both competitive and supportive. There are strong ties among students across grade levels, that give the campus a beautiful family ethos.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Mother of 5 sons\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School has been amazing in so many areas! We believe investing in our children`s education at the Geneva School is critical in these younger formative years. We have personally seen the benefits of being at the school for 2 years and look forward to many more. The teachers are amazing, and it is evident that their teaching is making a difference. If you are looking for a school that teaches your children how to think instead of what to think then The Geneva School is the place for you!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Deb\n\n5\n\nMy daughter started attending The Geneva School in the Fall of 2020. Our experience has been one of a kind. I was most drawn to the school because of the curriculum, small class sizes, and the Christian education. The environment is also something that matters a lot to our family, especially during these times in the world. I can definitely say all of our expectations have been exceeded!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Briana\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School is a great school with kind students and teachers and excellent learning opportunities. My favorite subject is math and I love the way I have been taught it throughout my years at Geneva. I have also been encouraged by my teachers during my time here. I have made very good friends here as well. I am very thankful for the Geneva School,\n\n- Posted by Student/Alumni - 6th grade student\n\n5\n\nOur daughter attends The Geneva School and we are beyond happy with our choice. All of the teachers and administration go out of their way to accommodate the needs of each student. The teachers make it a priority to address all parent concerns and they are prompt in responding to us. This school operates like a close nit family. Everyone works together for the betterment of the students. This school is definitely a good choice if you want your child to be in a school that cares about your children.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Moses\n\n5\n\nOur experience at the Geneva School has been nothing but amazing. We have two children at this school and we are constantly amazed at how much they are learning. They come home singing songs, reciting scripture, and teaching us about things that happened in history that I never learned in elementary school! This school has a rigorous and well-rounded curriculum that expertly incorporates and intertwines math, literature, history, science, art, and music for a rich learning experience for our kids. Not only does this school care about how my child is doing academically, but they are equally, if not more, invested in my child's spiritual well-being and growth as a loving and truth-seeking Christian. This school is teaching solid Biblical truth, which is rare to find at many Christian schools these days.\n\n- Posted by Parent - VL\n\n5\n\nIn first grade, we are studying the mysterious owl. Our inspiration began with admiring the watercolor by Albrecht Durer of \"The Little Owl\". We read books about the places they choose to nest, the prey they hunt, and how they attract their mate. We sketched the owl life cycle as well as learned interesting facts about the owl. We drew barn owls with oil pastels as well as created a great horned owl from a recycled milk jug. Mrs. Holt came to class to tell about her barn owl \"Barney\" from her childhood. We dissected an owl pellet. An owl pellet is undigested parts of their meal that are regurgitated. We dissected these and found multiple skulls within each pellet. As you can imagine our room was filled with excited students. The squeals of delight as they found bone after bone was great. Our first grade class is simply in awe of God`s creation. We are in awe of the beauty of His world and love to read, talk, sketch and yes, dissect. It has been a wonderful experience for us all!\n\n- Posted by Teacher - Lil\n\n5\n\nThere is no other school in Orange County like Geneva. Geneva is truly a special, unique school that has been a true blessing for the kids and families who attend. The focus at Geneva is to educate their students in God`s truth, beauty, virtue and wisdom. The school`s motto, \"Light and Truth\", reflects a purpose that is needed more now than ever. While the trend in American education is one of dumbing down kids to the lowest common denominator, erasing our county`s history and abandoning proven educational interventions or techniques that teach children how to learn and critically think, Geneva is committed to time tested strategies such as practicing memorization, listening comprehension, learning spelling and grammar rules, writing cursive, oral presentation and most importantly, introducing these children to the great books and texts of our Western history. Geneva believes every student is unique and special and the teachers go out of their way to bring out the best in each and every student. Aside from all of these wonderful advantages Geneva also offers small class sizes. We LOVE Geneva! Our only regret is that our oldest was never able to experience the Geneva way.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Courtney\n\n5\n\nWe are so grateful to have found The Geneva School. Not only is the quality and content of the education unique and unmatched, but we love being part of a group of families who all similarly hold classical education in such high regard. Our interactions with children from non-classical schools are a regular reminder of just how special TGS is.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Matthew P\n\n5\n\nWe are grateful to have our children enrolled at The Geneva School . The school is filled with caring teachers and faculty who ensure that each of our 3 children are supported in unique ways to meet their high academic standards. TGS`s care extends beyond academics, supporting our children`s growth in character and faith. Our whole family enjoys the classical school model of education.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Valerie\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School is a truly AMAZING place. Their classical education is unique and very thoughtfully curated to ensure that children are able to learn and progress to the fullest of their abilities. This is our first year there but are beyond impressed with how caring the teachers are, how involved the entire administration is with each students learning journey and the progress that our daughter has made. This school is a blessing to our community (we drive all the way to Laguna from San Clemente to attend). If you have the opportunity to send your child here don't hesitate - you will not regret it.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Jenn\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School \"trains up our kids\" in the classical Christian education system, which emphasizes writing, reading, logic, and speaking across all subjects. The goal is not simply to learn academic grammar and writing mechanics, but rather to approach every subject with clear thinking and eloquence. Writing and speaking are taught alongside research, facts, and logical thinking. Our kids are conditioned to look for the Truth in every aspect of their education; not create their own personal truth, which is meaningless and wavers with emotion and the passage of time. The Geneva School cultivates skills to equip our kids to be life-long learners by teaching them that every subject is comprised of certain defining facts with an orderly organization of the information, and a concise and persuasive way in which to present the material. This method of instruction has been in use for hundreds of years and is the means which produced most of history`s great thinkers. It is the new \"old-way\" of educating students with a long history of success. Upon graduation from The Geneva School, I am confident that our sons will be familiar with the Bible, reading, writing, Latin, logic, math, science, rhetoric, and the fine arts - resulting in them becoming considerate, knowledgeable, principled, and thoughtful young men. The Geneva School possesses a community of parents and teachers who share a commitment for teaching our kids to love learning and growing in godliness. The smaller class sizes ensure that teachers really know their students very well and are better able to serve them individually. Students know they are safe and loved and not just another child passing through, while openly manifesting deep appreciation and respect for their parents and teachers. By the end of 2nd grade, our 7-year-old was able to casually and correctly identify and name all of the countries and territories in Africa; and follow that up with an error-free 2-minute rattling off memorization of Exodus 20:1-17. The Geneva School uses methods and content aimed toward the development of critical thinking, articulate, and well-rounded young men and women. They aim to provide the best possible education to help every child reach their God-given potential. The Geneva School makes sure that students are being asked the big questions: What is true, beautiful, and good?\n\n- Posted by Parent - Jeff\n\n5\n\nWe have had our children at Geneva for years. We are overwhelmed by their development, both spiritually and mentally. Each time I watch my children among children their age, they are self-confident, intelligent, humble, and spiritually advanced. There is no doubt that this is the best, most rigorous education in Orange County.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Allison H\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School is a unique classical Christian education. My children have thrived in the small classroom environments where they have been instructed in ways that create a love of learning. The curriculum is rigorous, but the teachers genuine and devoted to the success of each student. I am most pleased by the way day-to-day interactions are governed by the molding of a child`s character, not just head knowledge. An excellent school to prepare students for all they need to thrive in other rigorous academic venues.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Jennifer\n\n5\n\nWe have been so impressed with the Geneva School! My older children attended a classical school, and when our youngest entered Kindergarten, we really want her to experience the same level of education. We have not been disappointed! She is reading, and LOVING it! (and the same goes for geography, history, math, art....) There is no frustration or annoyance with learning. This is giving her the proper attitude regarding higher learning that I saw in my older kids. But the best part about Kindergarten has definitely been Mrs Lee. She is amazing! she encourages and builds my daughter up, she is patient and kind, and expects them to give their best! My daughter has thrived under her leadership. I know the rest of the staff will continue to mold and shape her in the same way! Also, the way the school dealt with the craziness of this 2020-2021 school year has been nothing short of miraculous. We only had one week of online learning- the rest of the year has been in person! Excellence is the goal, and they've done it. Thank you Geneva!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Kristin\n\n5\n\nThe Geneva School has been such a blessing to our family. After feeling so much unease about their education and sending them off everyday. I can say this Mamma heart finally feels at peace. The staff goes above and beyond. They truly care about each student as a whole person. It has been incredible as a parent to see what they are capable of learning everyday and with such ease and confidence. So grateful for this school and staff.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Stephanie\n\n5\n\nThis school is absolutely AMAZING! We live in Costa Mesa and the drive to Laguna Woods is worth it (although I did dread the drive for the first 2 weeks). We were happy with our past public school and weren't shopping for a new school until COVID-19 closed in-person learning. Our kids now write in cursive and public speak. They read classic books and study art history! We are truly blown away every week with the information our kids are learning and retaining, not to mention what we are learning as parents...How many of you know how many countries are in Africa and their location?!? That would be my 2nd grader. States in Australia anyone?? Just my 4th grader! I can brag on and on about the curriculum and all the knowledge my kids have, but you`re probably thinking, \"that`s great lady, but how long are your kids studying to achieve such greatness?\". The answer is simple, give or take an hour a day. Right?!? shocking! With our 20 min drive home, the kids will start their homework in the car and will even quiz each other! #winning.I have no concerns about new math being taught or a Sexx Ed curriculum creeping in a book or a discussion. I appreciate the open communication I have with our teachers and the staff. I appreciate a progress report when our kids are having a challenging time on a concept, a playground spat, or praise. If you are reading this review then you are shopping around for a school...I highly encourage a tour! My husband and I said, \"only one year of private school\". Three weeks in and my husband and I agreed we would continue another year and by mid October our kids asked if they could continue to attend Geneva till eight grade. Check it out yourself, I promise you won`t be disappointed. FYI both our kids learning abilities were very different at public school and we were well aware of the strengths/weaknesses with both children. Since the Geneva School both our kids are thriving.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Briana H.\n\n5\n\nWe love The Geneva School! It is our first year here, but we have had an amazing experience. Our daughter has grown so much attending here and there aren`t enough words to describe our appreciation for all the staff. Everyone is so inviting and they truly practice what they preach.\n\n- Posted by Parent - KJGrider\n\n5\n\nThis school has been such a blessing this last year. Smaller class sizes and individual attention. If they're not understanding a concept. My child's academic needs are over the top being met and in addition to that, they're emotional needs are met at this school because of the smaller size. Will be sending my kindergartener here next year.\n\n- Posted by Parent - 1st grader parent\n\n5\n\nLove, Love this school. So impressed with my child's results and test scores.\n\n- Posted by Parent - 6th grade\n\n5\n\nExcellent and biblically centered school. Very organized and creative teachers who teach subjects with depth. Low student to teacher ratio means each child receives the guidance he or she needs. I have visited many public and private schools in Southern Orange County and The Geneva School has impressed me the most by far.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Heather A.P.\n\n5\n\nI can't say more about this school. My 3 kids go to the Geneva School, and it's been such a delight to see them grow in the knowledge of God's Word and advance in their academics far more than I imagined. Not only they learn information, but they are learning to critically think and discuss deeply subjects. The curriculum challenges my kids to work hard, but teachers and other students are there to encourage and help if there is any need. I'm thankful that they are getting an excellent education, but more so, I'm so thankful that the school facilitates in helping my kids to be grounded in a strong biblical foundation in these early years.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Kaitlyn\n\n5\n\nWe love the Geneva School! Couldn't be happier. The academic standards are second to none. My children love learning thanks to the Classical curriculum and their engaged, amazing teachers. The faculty, teachers, and students truly love and care for each other, spurring each other on to greater and greater heights.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Michelle\n\nEndorse The Geneva School. Endorsements should be a few sentences in length. Please include any comments on:\n\nQuality of academic programs, teachers, and facilities\n\nAvailability of music, art, sports and other extracurricular activities\n\nAcademic or athletic awards"
