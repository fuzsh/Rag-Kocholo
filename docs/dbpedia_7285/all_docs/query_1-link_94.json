Renowned for the quality of its bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Arts, Cinema, Interior Architecture, Space and Communication, Visual Communication as well as Fashion and Accessory Design, it has established itself as one of the leading schools of art and design in Europe.\n\nAs an academic and cultural institution, HEAD – Genève has forged close links with the local artistic community and economy. The decision to create a campus in the heart of the city underscores the school's commitment to establishing a centre of excellence for art and design in Geneva. Promoting international exchanges and interdisciplinary collaboration, this new creative hub has also expanded its Institute for Research in Art and Design.\n\nWelcoming renowned speakers and lecturers, the school's teaching philosophy emphasises freedom as well as personal and social responsibility. Encouraging the individuality of each student, the education provided at HEAD – Genève is based on dialogue between teachers and students, allowing the latter to shape their own artistic path. Students develop projects through workshops and seminars as well as collaboration with private and public professional partners.\n\nTheoretical teaching focuses on diverse aesthetic practices based on research and experimentation. It aims to build knowledge and exercise pluralist thinking. Know-how and critical thinking are the pillars of an educational approach that refuses all dogmatismand provides essential tools for understanding the contemporary world.\n\nAlumni of HEAD – Genève regularly participate in international events and exhibitions within the fashion, design, art and cinema industries."
