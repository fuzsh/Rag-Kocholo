        "text": "The Federation for EDucation in Europe (FEDE)\n\nThe Federation for EDucation in Europe (FEDE) is a network of nearly 500 higher educational and vocational institutions sharing a vision of quality, innovation, and ambition: at FEDE, students are at the heart of education.\n\nWith an important network of member institutions and alumni, FEDE institutions are able to anticipate tomorrow’s business requirements, adopting the latest teaching techniques and meeting European standards, as recognized by professionals and recruiters.\n\nFEDE Membership\n\nTo elaborate further, Swiss public universities are managed by the state and the degrees are equally issued by the state or a state-run governing entity.\n\nStudents often opt for public universities if they wish to study in an environment with a large array of permanent faculty members and large classes as government-subsidized tuition fees allow more students to apply.\n\nThe teaching approach is wholly theoretical and often taught by professors who have carried out research and long been associated with the academic world but rarely with the professional world of private companies and employment.\n\nPrivate business schools, on the other hand, offer small classes and are not government-subsidized. They can achieve accreditation for their programs from international bodies such as IACBE, EDUQUA, and AASBI.\n\nFaculty at private business schools usually work on a part-time basis, combining teaching with industry work. They are fully aware of the latest trends in their sector and teach it both in theory and in practice.\n\nThe teaching methodology is much more hands-on, interactive, and practical. This category of professors ultimately train students to be better prepared and offer insight into real-world markets. As a result, credible private schools venture overseas to gain programmatic accreditation and look for external supervision and global benchmarking.\n\nAs part of its mission, Geneva Business School is proud to be a private business school, offering practical education and unique access to the networks of our faculty. This approach means our students graduate prepared for today’s world of business, with a high level of employability.\n\nOur organization is classed as a Business School, distinguishing its status from that of a standard university. As such, Geneva Business School is not beholden to regulations imposed by the Swiss Higher Education Act (HEdA) and the School is free to provide higher education and confer private degrees, from bachelor’s to doctorate levels as it sees fit."
