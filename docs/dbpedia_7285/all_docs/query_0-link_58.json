        "text": "About Us\n\nOur educators are dedicated to a Christ-centered worldview and to the Geneva mission, locking arms with parents to provide a rigorous and time-tested education. Our award-winning and accredited academics, athletics and arts programs uphold the classical ideal by teaching students to recognize what is good, true and beautiful in every endeavor. We teach from a Christ-centered worldview—everything students learn and do is evaluated according to the standard of God’s word. Geneva graduates enter the world well-spoken and uniquely equipped to lead as servants, scholars, athletes and artists.\n\nLocated on 61 beautiful acres in Boerne, just north of San Antonio in the Texas Hill Country, Geneva is known for three distinctives—we offer a classical and Christian curriculum with deeply invested educators in a faithful, supportive community.\n\nThe school was formed in 1998 and began offering classes in 1999 to 13 students in kindergarten, first and third grade. The first senior class of 19 students graduated in May 2011. Geneva serves 715 students in grades K-12 this year and celebrated its 12th graduating senior class in May 2022. We seek to graduate classically trained servant leaders equipped to do hard things to the glory of Jesus Christ."
