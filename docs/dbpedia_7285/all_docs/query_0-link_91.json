        "text": "The “Geneva School” in this article refers to the history of literary criticism. It began to rise in the 1960s and 1970s, and then spread to Europe. It was once prosperous. The group represented by George Bligh has some kind of relationship with Geneva. A school of literary criticism composed of relational critics. The main members of the “Geneva School” include: George Bly, Jean Starobinski, Jean-Pierre Richard and Jean Luce. Although their research methods have their own characteristics, they maintain a consistent view of the aesthetic interpretation of the text, that is, a sense of criticism. In this article, the author further studies and interprets the Geneva School and its critical theory by tracing the origin of the Geneva School theory."
