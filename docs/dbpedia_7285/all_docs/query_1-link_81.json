        "text": "OUR VISION & MISSION\n\nThe Geneva School of Diplomacy (GSD) is a distinguished premium institution specialising in the teaching and practice of International Relations & Diplomacy.\n\nOur vision is to rank among the top International Relations & Diplomacy schools in the world and to produce world-class professionals by seamlessly blending academic rigour with vocational excellence.\n\nOur mission is to deliver an exceptional education to ambitious students committed to the theoretical foundations and practical applications of International Relations and Diplomacy. Through a curriculum characterised by academic excellence and enriched by hands-on experience, we aim to empower students to emerge as global leaders, set to play pivotal roles on the world stage, actively advancing development, peace, and human rights.\n\nWe offer high-quality and praxis-oriented academic degree programmes from the bachelor to master level, including executive education focused on both theory and the development of essential diplomatic skills. GSD also provides tailor-made programmes to meet the specific needs of corporations, diplomatic missions, and schools.\n\nIn addition to our cutting-edge courses, we offer a series of engaging lectures as part of the Emerging Issues & Persistent Challenges seminar series, in which real-life cases and experiences are discussed by top experts. All programmes are taught in English by highly distinguished faculty members, including world-renowned professors, state officials, current field experts, practitioners, and (serving) ambassadors.\n\nOur students are able to create a network that can be life-long and life-changing through our close partnerships with the surrounding international organisations, diplomatic missions and NGOs. They can also benefit from our small, interactive classes taught by highly distinguished faculty members and the many lectures led by high-profile guest speakers.\n\nRecognising the dynamic landscape of the diplomatic world, we regularly update our curriculum to align with current labour developments and needs. Graduates of GSD emerge equipped with the academic, vocational and practical diplomatic skills needed to excel in their chosen profession.\n\nOUR ORIGINS\n\nGSD was founded in 2003 by President Dr. Colum de Sales Murphy, a specialist in the study of the roots of war and conflict. He has dedicated his life to the cause of peace, serving the United Nations for more than 3 decades. His wartime experience and contribution to peace negotiations in several conflicts inspired him to create a platform to prepare future leaders for their roles on the world stage, advancing development, peace, and human rights. Thus the Geneva School of Diplomacy & International Relations was established.\n\nOUR CORE VALUES\n\nGSD abides by its motto: “Serviendo Guberno – To Govern is to Serve.”\n\nAcademic & Vocational Excellence\n\nA commitment to Diplomatic & International Relations knowledge\n\nUpholding academic freedom, independence, creativity, and innovation\n\nIntegrity\n\nFostering a diplomatic community grounded in responsible citizenship.\n\nCultivating mutual respect through openness, honesty and transparency.\n\nEmbracing diversity, providing equal opportunity, and ensuring accessibility.\n\nProfessionalism\n\nDelivering effective and efficient customer-focused services across all aspects of our work both internally and externally.\n\nPracticing collegiality and teamwork.\n\nGSD is dedicated to integrating social and environmental sustainability principles into both its teaching and actions. We prioritise inclusivity in our recruitment of staff and faculty, striving to maintain equal representation in terms of gender and nationality. This commitment extends to our student admission process where diversity is actively promoted."
