        "text": "Our child has been at Geneva for three years now. I have been so impressed over the years of how strong the academics are. But Geneva really emphasizes and recognizes children with different talents by having such a wide variety of high quality programing and opportunities for children to shine in different ways. We have really loved the community of families at this school and have built a great community of friends. As a parent to an energetic child, I also love the regular outdoor play time and 4 day a week gym. The teachers seem to have good morale and take the time to get to know each student. We feel like our child is seen and understood by his teachers.\n\nPosted by a parent on 4/22/2024\n\nWe currently have a fourth and first grader enrolled in the school, and it is our fifth year at the school. It is a wonderful Christian school with loving staff and faculty, a rich curriculum, small class sizes, and one of the only Classical schools in the area. We live in Westchester, but still have our children enrolled at The Geneva School because we strongly believe in their mission and have not found a comparable school in our area.\n\nPosted by a parent on 11/6/2022\n\nGeneva School lives up to its mission \"Love God, Love Learning\" - this is our second year at the school and we can truly say that both of our kids have grown in their love for God and learning! It is such a blessing to see them excited to go to school and eager to share what they learned each day. The leadership at Geneva School have a genuine heart for what they are doing and it shows through their consistency - from greeting students every morning to being present and engaged with students and families throughout the school year. We have found the teachers to be excellent - always taking time to make sure that the students are understanding what they are learning rather than only focusing on grades. The teachers will take time to sit and review material with students until mastery is obtained. We really value the emphasis on learning rather than test taking and grades - it instills a growth mindset in our kids that aligns with our mission at home to raise kids who aren't afraid to make mistakes, but rather see them as an opportunity to learn and grow. If you are considering Geneva School you won't be disappointed!\n\nPosted by a parent on 10/13/2022\n\nGeneva School is an incredible community in NYC and has been a true anchor to the city for us the past few years. Our child started in the first year of preschool and has been thriving each year since. Constantly we get the question “Is school today? When do I get to go to school?!” We are continually impressed by the welcoming community of parents, the dedicated administration, and the impressive teachers who manage to nurture our children and also deliver high caliber academics. The classical nature of the education is a true asset, helping equip kids to approach the world with curiosity, be able to articulate their viewpoint, and learn responsibility throughout. And the school is authentically God-centered, giving a great foundation for our child and the community. We absolutely love Geneva School!\n\nPosted by a parent on 10/6/2022"
