        "text": "The following are some of the most frequently asked questions from prospective parents to The Geneva School.\n\nBe sure to also check out FAST FACTS.\n\nWhat is the significance of the name The Geneva School?\n\nThe Geneva School is named for the city of Geneva, Switzerland, which played a pivotal role in the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s. The transforming effect of the Reformation was felt throughout the city of Geneva, which in turn wielded cultural, social, religious, educational, and political influence over its region and over other parts of Europe. Christian classical education flourished there and contributed to the changes brought about by the Reformation. The city of Geneva adopted as its official motto the expression post tenebras lux (“after darkness, light”) as a testimony to the transformation that God had brought about.\n\nAt its founding, the board of The Geneva School adopted the name Geneva and post tenebras lux as the motto of our official crest. It is our goal to foster the growth of the Christian classical movement, so that its transformative effects will be as enduring and widespread as was the city of Geneva.\n\nIs Geneva affiliated with a particular denomination?\n\nNo, Geneva is an independent school, not affiliated with any church or denomination.\n\nDo you have to be Christian to attend Geneva?\n\nWhile being a Christian is not a requirement for entrance to Geneva, about 90% of our students attend a Christian church regularly.\n\nWhat colleges or universities have The Geneva School students chosen to attend following graduation?\n\nAt what age can my child begin attending Geneva?\n\nWhat are the school hours?\n\nInformation on school hours, drop-of and pick up times, early dismissal, lunch schedules, and the upper school bell schedule can be found on the School Hours/Schedules page.\n\nDoes Geneva require students to wear uniforms?\n\nDoes Geneva have a lunch program?\n\nDoes Geneva offer summer programs?\n\nDoes Geneva have programs for children with special needs/learning differences?\n\nGeneva does not currently have programs in place to accommodate children with significant special needs/learning differences. However, if a child’s condition is mild in nature, it may be possible for them to succeed at Geneva. The school employs a learning specialist and has a student services office to assist students and families. Please contact Candace Houk in the admission department to discuss your child’s individual needs.\n\nWhat kinds of field trips do your students go on?\n\nWhat is your philosophy regarding homework?\n\nThe majority of learning takes place in the classroom. Our teachers assign homework to reinforce classroom lessons. The amount of time a student needs to complete homework varies from day to day, from grade to grade, and from student to student. A general daily guideline is about 10 minutes for each accumulated grade level in the grammar school (i.e., 10 minutes per day for a first grade student and 1 hour per day for a sixth grade student) and 10–15 minutes a day for each accumulated grade level in the dialectic and rhetoric (i.e., 70–105 minutes a day for a seventh grade student and 120–180 minutes for a senior).\n\nWhat textbooks or curriculum does Geneva use?\n\nTo which grades do you teach Latin?\n\nLatin studies begin in third grade and continue as a required course through the eighth grade. Latin in grades 3–6 emphasizes acquisition of vocabulary and an introduction to the case system and verb conjugations. Graded Latin readings are also undertaken in order to develop reading fluency. Grades 7 and 8 (Latin Ia and Ib, respectively) refine the student’s understanding of Latin even more, through an extensive graded reading, further expanding the student’s vocabulary and giving the opportunity to discuss in more depth various important aspects of Latin syntax.\n\nLatin electives through AP Latin (Latin II–V/AP) are taught in the rhetoric school. These electives focus on an in-depth reading of various Latin authors from a variety of genres.\n\nWhat elective courses do you offer to high school students?\n\nDo you offer Honors and AP courses?\n\nWhat standardized tests do students take?\n\nMy child is an incoming seventh or eighth grader but has never studied Latin. What, if anything, should (s)he do to catch up?\n\nLatin is taught at Geneva using a unified curriculum that begins in third grade and continues through seventh and eighth grade respectively, and, if a student elects to continue in their study of Latin, culminates with AP Latin in twelfth grade.\n\nStudents who enter The Geneva School in seventh grade will take Latin Ia. Students who begin in eighth grade with no prior Latin instruction will not take Latin and will instead have a study hall period.\n\nMy high school child is looking to transfer to Geneva. Will (s)he be able to meet Geneva’s graduation requirements?\n\nIn many instances, if a student comes in from an academically rigorous college preparatory and/or a liberal arts preparatory curriculum, the answer is generally “yes.” Over the last number of years, we have done our best to accommodate students who are transferring from other schools or homeschool but which do not conform to our “classical distinctive requirements”—especially with regard to the teaching of logic, Latin, philosophy, theology, and rhetoric—thus still allowing them to graduate from The Geneva School. The closer a student is to graduation, the more difficult it is to make accommodation. All of our graduates, however, need to meet or exceed the requirements for Florida Bright Futures Scholarship, which we believe to be the bare minimum.\n\nHow is technology utilized at Geneva?\n\nAt The Geneva School, we introduce students to technological tools and resources beginning in the grammar school seeking to employ them where it helps us meet our overarching educational goals.\n\nWe understand technology to be tools used by man to accomplish tasks. However, these tools are not inert or neutral—much to the contrary. As a tool, technology is a fundamental way that humans shape, come to know, and seek to understand the world in which they live. These two principles—the notion that technology is a tool and the recognition of the limits and possibilities—form the basis of how we employ technology.\n\nIn a child’s most formative years, the most important interactions are with parents, teachers, and other children, not devices or media. Faculty members use technology to present and demonstrate concepts and skills already presented in the classroom to reinforce student discovery when appropriate. By design, student use of computers will not be required in the early grammar school years; however, some optional activities are computer-based. The importance of the classroom teacher during these years cannot be overstated.\n\nIn fifth and sixth grade, students begin to use computers at home for web-based sources to supplement the books they are provided with in class for various research projects. The science teacher also provides students with specific websites to explore for monthly “Science Internet Projects” that are completed for homework.\n\nStudents in 7th and 8th grade are given a Google Apps for Education account and are expected to have access to a computer with internet capabilities and a printer at home. They are not required or allowed to bring a device to school since a school-provided and managed Chromebook will be used in 7th and 8th grade classes when needed for classroom assignments.\n\nStudents in ninth through twelfth grade are given a Google Apps for Education account. For general classroom use, students in 9th grade may bring a device to school if they wish but are not required to do so. Students in 10th–12th grade are required to bring a device to school for general classroom use. A low-cost Chromebook (11-inch screen recommended) is an excellent device for general classroom use. Please note that 9th–12th grade students in some rhetoric elective classes (Journalism/Yearbook, Photography, Student Magazine, Introduction to Computer Science, Audio Visual Arts & Sciences) are required to bring a Windows or Mac laptop. In addition, students should have access to the internet and a printer at home.\n\nHave Questions? Want to Learn More?"
