        "text": "School Reviews\n\n5.00 out of 5 (8 reviews)\n\n5\n\nWe have been at Geneva School for three years now. Our son is thriving here. The academics are very strong. But the school has a very holistic view of their students. They have time to move in PE four days a week and daily recess. The school has a very strong musical culture, allowing the students to perform with their friends for their community. Our son can now beat us in chess, asks us math problems for fun, and is constantly singing his school songs. He is really joyful and excited about what he is learning. The community of parents and families has also been such a blessing. Every time I go to a school event I come away so impressed by the passion and joy that the faculty put into everything. I would highly recommend the Geneva School, we are so happy to be here.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Current Parent\n\n5\n\nThis is my freshman year of high school and my first year at Geneva school. Although it has been only a single trimester, I already feel completely integrated and accepted into this wonderful community of incredible people. The community is tight knit and everybody knows each other, guaranteeing that every day I come to school I know that I am arriving to a group of friends. My classmates and teachers are not only incredibly kind, but also extremely smart and hardworking, which is an incredible and I believe, necessary thing that I didn't find at my previous schools. The academics feature many classes, a diversity that keeps me always engaged. We learn other languages, ancient history, read great books and conduct complex experiments in chemistry to name a few. The teachers are very evidently experienced in everything they teach and are passionate about ensuring our success. Another thing I should mention is the athletic program featuring volleyball, basketball, soccer and cross country. I am a player on the varsity basketball team and am massively impressed by my fellow teammates who are very skilled but also, crucially, not toxically competitive. We won our first game of the basketball season on Dec.14, increasing our across-sport record to 26 wins so far this year! I already see myself growing through the teachers' belief in me and the support of my classmates. Choosing Geneva school has been one of the best decisions of my life, I have found the perfect community for growth here and I highly recommend this school for everyone!\n\n- Posted by Student/Alumni - NT\n\n5\n\nWe moved internationally to NY & were recommended Geneva because of its Classical Christian Model of education. We have been at the school for just over a year and our kids love it. We are so happy with the teachers - their enthusiasm, passion and personal attention to each child and their needs are exceptional. We have 4 kids at this school and whether it`s the way the little ones are encouraged to learn through methods that incorporate classical literature or art or whether it`s the amazing leadership opportunities that our older kids are exposed to - we love this school so much. Each of our kids has improved academically, and when any of them have struggled, the teachers have been more than willing to help where needed. The kids do all the normal subjects but I also love that they do logic and learn chess - helping them to think out of the box. We also LOVE the school community. It is so embracing of new parents & there are so many opportunities for parents to be involved.\n\n- Posted by Parent - D\n\n5\n\nThis is our second year in The Geneva School and we couldn't be happier (joined in 2nd grade). We transferred from another private school in Manhattan and what struck me most is how authentic and genuine everyone is - from the teachers to the administration and parent community. You truly feel like you're part of a family. As well, the curriculum is the first rate - my child is thriving here, learning things that I certainly didn't when I was in the same grade. Their approach to learning is such that my child comes home excited about what they learned and I can actively see them grow and develop. I could not recommend Geneva more highly - it exceeds on every level.\n\n- Posted by Parent - TB\n\n5\n\nI have boys in both the lower and upper schools at Geneva and I'm thrilled with the quality of the education they are receiving. They are academically challenged and are developing a deep love of learning as well as a spiritual maturity that is wonderful to see. Each of my boys has different personalities and learning styles and they all are thriving at Geneva. Their teachers have a passion for what they do and inspire the students. They genuinely care about the students and are accessible and dedicated. The community at Geneva is so warm and welcoming. My boys also study violin at the Geneva Conservatory of Music which is phenomenal. I highly recommend Geneva.\n\n- Posted by Parent - IF\n\n5\n\nAlthough my children benefited from many facets of the school during their years at Geneva School, by far the BEST thing about the school is the teachers. They love their students, they delight in imparting lessons, and they embody their own lifelong quest for learning. I could not be more excited that the school is starting a high school. This is great news for NYC families!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Alumni Parent\n\n5\n\nAs a parent of two young students (Lower School) at Geneva School, I cannot say enough about the quality of education they are receiving. Daily, I am in awe of the new things they learn and discover, and experience at school. They are already challenging ME with their math facts, chess skills, French language skills, and knowledge of grammar, music, art, and the Bible. They are clearly growing academically, socially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Our kids have wildly different personalities and strengths and this has been an excellent fit for both of them. The support and partnership we have felt from the faculty, staff, administration, and other parents have been an integral part of our experience at the School. The School has successfully and safely provided an in-person learning environment during the pandemic that has made all the difference for our children's development. We are so grateful and highly recommend Geneva School!\n\n- Posted by Parent - Parent\n\n5\n\nOur family has been mightily blessed at Geneva School! Our son started Kindergarten this fall and absolutely LOVES his teacher and his classmates. He is very excited to go to school every day! In fact, he thinks Ms. Kang is the best teacher he has ever had! She is smart, kind, makes his class incredibly fun, and he always feels safe at school. As a parent and health care provider, this has given me the peace of mind to go to work every day and fight for my patients. We love the small class size and supportive school community. I am so impressed by Geneva's staff and faculty, they genuinely care about their students and are always available to help. We are so grateful that Geneva has worked so hard to keep our kids in school during this pandemic. At my son's age, having in-person school is vital to his social, emotional, mental, and educational development. You will not go wrong by sending your child to Geneva! It has been a small beacon of hope in the challenging times we live in.\n\n- Posted by Parent - JE\n\nEndorse The Geneva School of Manhattan. Endorsements should be a few sentences in length. Please include any comments on:\n\nQuality of academic programs, teachers, and facilities\n\nAvailability of music, art, sports and other extracurricular activities\n\nAcademic or athletic awards"
