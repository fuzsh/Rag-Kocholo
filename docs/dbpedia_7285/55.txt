The Geneva School offers a distinctly classical Christian K-8 education, teaching all subjects from a Christian worldview. All knowledge comes from God and therefore a Christian education should be imbued with academic rigor. The Geneva School curriculum consists of analytical phonics and reading; rich literature and writing; chronological history; Latin; formal and informal logic; advanced science, including Biology, Earth Science, Chemistry, and Physics; art; music; and PE. Throughout each subject, students are equipped with the foundational tools of learning, preparing today’s students to be tomorrow’s leaders.
