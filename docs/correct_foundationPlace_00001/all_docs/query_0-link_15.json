        "text": "People always ask us, “How do you measure impact?” It’s actually the easiest question to answer because we measure through the only lens that matters — lives impacted. Our 2023 Annual Report tells a powerful story of what is possible when people lean into problems, not away from them, and when passion, empathy, and belief in something better drive human focus.\n\nIn 2023, Google.org contributed over $4 million to three DRK portfolio organizations using AI to address major global challenges. Learn how Jacaranda Health, Tarjimly, and Rocket Learning are building a better, more sustainable future for all.\n\nLiving under the constant threat of violence has a lasting effect — even after you escape from danger. Zarlasht Halaimzai, founder of DRK portfolio organization Amna, delivers a vital Ted Talk to share how belonging and feeling valued can bring back a sense of safety for refugees."
