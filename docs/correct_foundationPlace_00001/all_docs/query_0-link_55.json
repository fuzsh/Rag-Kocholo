        "text": "Why is the study needed?\n\nOver the last two decades, the City of Menlo Park and County of San Mateo have conducted a series of studies that described walking, biking, and safety needs on Coleman Avenue and Ringwood Avenue. These included the 2021 Unincorporated San Mateo Active Transportation Plan, the Menlo Park Transportation Master Plan, and the Menlo Atherton High School Expansion Study.\n\nThe 2021 Unincorporated San Mateo Active Transportation Plan designated bicycle facilities on both streets and both were listed as priority pedestrian destination areas. Similarly, the Menlo Park Transportation Plan recommended bicycle lanes on Coleman Avenue.\n\nThis earlier work demonstrated that people often choose to walk, bicycle, and drive along both streets, and that both serve as important connections to community destinations. This study will build on previous efforts and conduct a detailed review how both streets can meet and balance the transportation needs of all corridor users, with a focus on the safety and comfort of all community members, no matter which mode they choose. Both streets present a variety of travel challenges and opportunities, and this study will address them in detail.\n\nThere are several schools located within the study area that will benefit directly from improvements to Coleman and Ringwood Avenues. Both streets are key connections for students traveling to and from school. For students, walking and bicycling to school can:\n\nHelp improve health and fitness, which can be a factor in boosting academic performance\n\nCreate opportunities to mitigate the impacts of climate change\n\nHelp address historical inequities in transportation infrastructure and policy.\n\nHow is the study funded?\n\nThis study is jointly funded by the County of San Mateo and the City of Menlo Park.\n\nStudy Timeline\n\nThis study will take about 24 months, kicking off in Winter 2021/2022 and concluding in Winter 2024. Community engagement will inform the technical analysis and recommendations in each stage of the study."
