        "text": "Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.\n\nUnity's AR Foundation is a cross-platform framework that allows you to write augmented reality experiences once, then build for either Android or iOS devices without making any additional changes. The framework is available via Unity's AR Foundation package.\n\nARCore's optional ARCore Extensions for AR Foundation package adds additional functionality, enabling you to use features such as Cloud Anchors, Camera configuration filters, and Recording and Playback to your app.\n\nMigrate or upgrade existing projects\n\nTo migrate an existing project from the (deprecated) ARCore SDK for Unity to Unity's AR Foundation and optionally ARCore Extensions, see the migration guide.\n\nTo upgrade an existing project from an earlier version of AR Foundation, see Unity's upgrade and migration guides.\n\nRequirements\n\nDepending on your target platform, the AR Foundation package requires the following:\n\nAndroid\n\nHardware\n\nAn ARCore supported Android device or emulator\n\nA USB cable for connecting your device to your development machine\n\nSoftware\n\nUnity 2019.4.3f1 or later with Android Build Support\n\niOS\n\nHardware\n\nAn ARCore supported iOS device\n\nA USB cable for connecting your device to your development machine\n\nSoftware\n\nUnity 2019.4.3f1 or later with iOS Build Support\n\nXcode 11.0 or later\n\nInstall AR Foundation\n\nFollow these steps to install the AR Foundation Unity package.\n\nOpen an existing Unity project, or create a new 3D project.\n\nNavigate to Window > Package Manager.\n\nNext to Packages, select Unity Registry.\n\nIn the search bar, type \"AR Foundation\".\n\nClick Install.\n\nInstall and enable platform-specific plugin packages\n\nThe AR Foundation package presents an interface for Unity developers to use, but doesn't implement any AR features itself. To use AR Foundation on a target device, you'll also need to install separate packages and enable the corresponding plugin for each respective platform.\n\nAndroid\n\nThe ARCore XR Plugin package allows you to build augmented reality apps for Android devices. Follow these steps to install it in your Unity project if your application targets Android devices. Use the same version as the AR Foundation package to avoid any compatibility issues.\n\nIn your project, navigate to Window > Package Manager.\n\nNext to Packages, select Unity Registry.\n\nIn the search bar, type \"ARCore XR plugin\".\n\nClick Install.\n\nNavigate to Edit > Project Settings. In XR Plug-in Management, open the Android tab and enable ARCore.\n\niOS\n\nThe ARKit XR Plugin allows you to build augmented reality apps for iOS devices. Follow these steps to install it in your Unity project if your application targets iOS devices. Use the same version as the AR Foundation package to avoid any compatibility issues.\n\nIn your project, navigate to Window > Package Manager.\n\nNext to Packages, select Unity Registry.\n\nIn the search bar, type \"ARKit XR plugin\".\n\nClick Install.\n\nNavigate to Edit > Project Settings. In XR Plug-in Management, open the iOS tab and enable ARKit.\n\nConfigure an AR Session and add AR Foundation components to your scene\n\nA scene needs an AR session to enable AR processes, such as motion tracking, environmental understanding, and lighting estimation. You will need the following game objects to support an AR session:\n\nAR Foundation 4.x\n\nAR Session: Controls the lifecycle of an AR experience.\n\nAR Session Origin: Transforms AR coordinates into Unity world coordinates.\n\nBefore adding the new game objects, delete the default Main Camera. It will be replaced by a new AR Camera in the AR Session Origin.\n\nAdd the new AR game objects to your scene: right-click the Hierarchy pane and select XR. Add a new AR Session and a new AR Session Origin game object.\n\nAR Foundation 5.x\n\nAR Session: Controls the lifecycle of an AR experience.\n\nXR Origin: Transforms AR coordinates into Unity world coordinates.\n\nBefore adding the new game objects, delete the default Main Camera. It will be replaced by a new AR Camera in the XR Origin.\n\nAdd the new AR game objects to your scene: right-click the Hierarchy pane and select XR. Add a new AR Session and a new XR Origin game object.\n\nConfigure Player Settings\n\nAndroid\n\nNavigate to File > Build Settings to open the Build Settings window.\n\nUnder Platform, choose Android and click Switch Platform.\n\nClick Player Settings.\n\nApply the following changes:\n\nPlayer Settings > … Value Other Settings > Rendering Uncheck Auto Graphics API.\n\nIf Vulkan is listed under Graphics APIs, remove it as Vulkan is not yet supported by ARCore. Other Settings > Package Name Create a unique app ID using a Java package name format.\n\nFor example, use com.example.helloAR. Other Settings > Minimum API Level If you are building an AR Required app, specify Android 7.0 'Nougat' (API Level 24) or higher.\n\nIf you are building an AR Optional app, specify Android API Level 19 or higher. Other Settings > Scripting Backend Select IL2CPP instead of Mono to allow ARM64 support to be enabled in the next step.\n\nDuring development:\n\nUse Mono + 32-bit (ARMv7)\n\nInstall a FAT (32-bit + 64-bit) ARCore APK\n\nWhen shipping to the Play Store:\n\nUse IL2CPP\n\nEnable both 32-bit (ARMv7) and 64-bit (ARM64) to meet Play Store 64-bit requirements\n\nOptional (supported in 2018.3+): In Build Settings, enable Android App Bundles\n\nOther Settings > Target Architectures To meet the Google Play 64-bit requirement, enable ARM64 (64-bit ARM). Leave ARMv7 (32-bit ARM) enabled to support 32-bit devices.\n\niOS\n\nNavigate to File > Build Settings to open the Build Settings window.\n\nUnder Platform, choose iOS and click Switch Platform.\n\nClick Player Settings.\n\nConfigure the following settings:\n\nPlayer Settings > … Value Other Settings > Bundle Identifier Add your app's name in a reverse DNS format.\n\nFor example, use com.mycompany.myapp. Other Settings > Camera usage description Enter a description to explain your use of AR (for example, ARKit). Other Settings > Target minimum iOS version 11.0 or higher Other Settings > Architecture ARM64\n\nWhat's next\n\nGet started with the optional ARCore Extensions package, which provides additional ARCore functionality for the AR Foundation framework.\n\nCreate an AR game using Unity's AR Foundation (codelab)."
