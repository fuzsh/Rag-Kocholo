        "text": "Chrome supports a number of different release channels. We use these channels to slowly roll out updates to users, starting with our close to daily Canary channel builds, all the way up to our Stable channel releases that happen every 6 weeks roughly.\n\nChannels\n\nWindows 64-bit\n\nAll channels may be run in parallel -- they install into distinct directories and use dedicated User Data directories.\n\nStable channel for Windows (64-bit)\n\nBeta channel for Windows (64-bit)\n\nDev channel for Windows (64-bit)\n\nCanary build for Windows (64-bit)\n\nWindows 32-bit\n\nAll channels may be run in parallel -- they install into distinct directories and use dedicated User Data directories.\n\nStable channel for Windows (32-bit)\n\nBeta channel for Windows (32-bit)\n\nDev channel for Windows (32-bit)\n\nCanary build for Windows (32-bit)\n\nMac\n\nAll channels may be run in parallel -- they install into distinct directories and use dedicated User Data directories.\n\nStable channel for Mac\n\nBeta channel for Mac\n\nDev channel for Mac\n\nCanary build for Mac\n\nAndroid\n\nStable channel for Android\n\nBeta channel for Android\n\nDev channel for Android\n\nCanary channel for Android\n\niOS\n\nStable channel for iOS\n\nBeta channel for iOS\n\nLinux\n\nStable channel\n\nBeta channel\n\nDev channel\n\nHow do I choose which channel to use?\n\nThe release channels for chrome range from the most stable and tested (Stable channel) to completely untested and likely least stable (Canary channel). You can run all channels alongside all others, as they do not share profiles with one another. This allows you to play with our latest code, while still keeping a tested version of Chrome around.\n\nStable channel: This channel has gotten the full testing and blessing of the Chrome test team, and is the best bet to avoid crashes and other issues. It's updated roughly every two-three weeks for minor releases, and every 6 weeks for major releases.\n\nBeta channel: If you are interested in seeing what's next, with minimal risk, Beta channel is the place to be. It's updated every week roughly, with major updates coming every six weeks, more than a month before the Stable channel will get them.\n\nDev channel: If you want to see what's happening quickly, then you want the Dev channel. The Dev channel gets updated once or twice weekly, and it shows what we're working on right now. There's no lag between major versions, whatever code we've got, you will get. While this build does get tested, it is still subject to bugs, as we want people to see what's new as soon as possible.\n\nCanary build: Canary builds are the bleeding edge. Released daily, this build has not been tested or used, it's released as soon as it's built.\n\nOther builds: If you're extra brave, you can download the latest working (and that's a very loose definition of working) build from download-chromium.appspot.com. You can also look for a more specific recent build by going to the Chromium continuous build waterfall, looking at the number near the top under \"LKGR\", and then going to this Google Storage bucket and downloading the corresponding build.\n\nNote: Early access releases (Canary builds and Dev and Beta channels) will be only partly translated into languages other than English. Text related to new features may not get translated into all languages until the feature is released in the Stable channel.\n\nWhat should I do before I change my channel?\n\nBack up your data!\n\nBefore you switch, you should make a backup of your profile (bookmarks, most visited pages, history, cookies, etc). If you ever want to switch back to a more stable channel, your updated profile data might not be compatible with the older version. Make a copy of the User Data\\Default directory (for example, copy it to 'Default Backup' in the same location). The location depends on your operating system:\n\nWindows XP:\n\nStable, beta, and dev channels: \\Documents and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\n\nCanary builds: \\Documents and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Google\\Chrome SxS\\User Data\\Default\n\nWindows Vista, 7, 8 or 10:\n\nStable channel: \\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\n\nBeta channel: \\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome Beta\\User Data\\Default\n\nDev channel: \\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome Dev\\User Data\\Default\n\nCanary builds: \\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome SxS\\User Data\\Default\n\nMac OS X:\n\nStable channels, as well as older beta and dev channels: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default\n\nBeta channel: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome Beta/Default\n\nDev channel: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome Dev/Default\n\nCanary builds: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome Canary/Default\n\nLinux:\n\n~/.config/google-chrome/Default\n\nNote:If you're using Explorer to find the folder, you might need to set Show hidden files and folders in Tools > Folder Options... > View.\n\nReporting Dev channel and Canary build problems\n\nRemember, Dev channel browsers and Canary builds may still crash frequently. Before reporting bugs, consult the following pages:\n\nBug Life Cycle and Reporting Guidelines\n\nSee bug-reporting-guidlines-for-the-mac-linux-builds before reporting problems in Mac or Linux Dev channel builds\n\nhttps://crbug.com/new If after reading the above, you think you have a real bug, file it -\n\nGoing back to a more stable channel"
