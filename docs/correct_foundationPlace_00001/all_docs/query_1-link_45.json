        "text": "Permanent Courses\n\nBAOC has a few \"trim\" orienteering courses—practice courses that have permanent markers. This means you can print or purchase a map, and do the course on your own at any time.\n\nIf you print a map yourself, keep in mind that you might end up with a map scale that is different than what is stated on the map.\n\nAfter you have the map and are at the start location, these Seven Easy Steps (PDF/53KB) will get you going.\n\nBAOC has permanent courses in the following locations:\n\nBedwell Bayfront Park in Menlo Park. You can print the PDF files¹ linked below.\n\nWhite Course (beginner): Map (3.4MB)\n\nYellow Course (advanced beginner): Map (3.5MB)\n\nOrange Course (intermediate): Map (3.5MB)\n\nIn addition, there's a master map (3.7MB) that shows all the controls without a prescribed course. You can use this map to create your own course, or perhaps to practice doing a Score-O.\n\nThese permanent courses were created in 2010 by Philipp Kopisch as an Eagle Scout Project for Boy Scout Troop 109. A note from Philipp is here. The courses were made possible with support from the Bay Area Orienteering Club, the City of Menlo Park, the Friends of Bedwell Bayfront Park, and many members of Troop 109.\n\nThe park map and the physical course markers were updated and repaired, respectively, in 2022 by Hannah Walker (Girl Scout Troop 62415) and Sarah Meyer (Girl Scout Troop 61753) as a Silver Award Project.\n\nBriones Regional Park in Martinez. You can print the PDF files¹ linked below. The course instructions are available only from the links below.\n\nWhite Course (beginner): Map (1MB) (http://baoc.org/maps/briones/PermWhiteMap.pdf), Instructions (71KB) (http://baoc.org/maps/briones/PermWhiteInstructions.pdf)\n\nYellow Course (advanced beginner): Map (1MB) (http://baoc.org/maps/briones/PermYellowMap.pdf), Instructions (72KB) (http://baoc.org/maps/briones/PermYellowInstructions.pdf)\n\nOrange Course (intermediate): Map (1MB) (http://baoc.org/maps/briones/PermOrangeMap.pdf), Instructions (66KB) (http://baoc.org/maps/briones/PermOrangeInstructions.pdf)\n\nBrown and Green Course (advanced, streamers only, temporary): Map (1.3MB)\n\nNote: The courses start at the Alhambra Creek Valley Entrance on the northeast side of the park.\n\nComments on the courses are available here.\n\nShell Ridge Open Space in Walnut Creek. You can print the PDF files¹ linked below. (Note: The courses start at the entrance on Sutherland Drive on the south side of the park, not from the location of regular BAOC events.)\n\nWhite Course (beginner): Map (396KB) (http://baoc.org/maps/shellridge/PermWhiteMap.pdf)\n\nYellow Course (advanced beginner): Map (387KB) (http://baoc.org/maps/shellridge/PermYellowMap.pdf)\n\nNote: The courses start at the Sutherland Dr entrance on the southwest side of the park.\n\nComments on the courses are available here.\n\nBurton Creek State Park in Tahoe City (Lake Tahoe). Our Mapping Director has the maps; please see the map purchases (http://baoc.org/maps/purchase.php) page for details.\n\nComments on the courses are available here.\n\nJoaquin Miller Park in Oakland. You can print the PDF files¹ linked below.\n\nWhite Course (beginner): Map (1MB)\n\nYellow Course (advanced beginner): Map (1MB)\n\nOrange Course (intermediate): Map (1MB)\n\nIn addition, there's an All Controls file (1.5MB) that contains three maps that show all the controls without a prescribed course. You can use these maps to create your own course, or perhaps to practice doing a Score-O.\n\nInstructions for preparing for one of the courses are available here (PDF/76KB).\n\nComments on the courses are available here.\n\nVasona Lake County Park in Los Gatos. You can print the PDF files¹ linked below.\n\nWhite Course (beginner): Map (1.4MB PDF) (http://baoc.org/maps/vasona/PermWhiteMap.pdf)\n\nYellow Course (advanced beginner): Map (1.4MB PDF) (http://baoc.org/maps/vasona/PermYellowMap.pdf)\n\nOrange Course (intermediate): Map (1.4MB PDF) (http://baoc.org/maps/vasona/PermOrangeMap.pdf)\n\nThese Vasona Park permanent courses were originally created in 2012 by Mark Sinks as an Eagle Scout Project for Boy Scout Troop 37. The maps and course markers were updated in 2021 for a Silver Award project by Meaghan Kelleher, Lorien Bower, and Chryssa Karakekes of Girl Scout Troop 62971. Both editions of the courses were made possible with support from the Bay Area Orienteering Club and the Santa Clara County Parks Department.\n\nThere is also a beginner permanent course at Newell Open Space (https://www.cityofamericancanyon.org/city-departments/parks-recreation/parks-trails-and-open-space/newell-open-space) in American Canyon. Information about the course is available here (http://www.cityofamericancanyon.org/city-departments/parks-recreation/parks-trails-and-open-space/newell-open-space/orienteering). There is a nice two-page brochure (39MB PDF) (http://www.cityofamericancanyon.org/home/showdocument?id=15840) for the course, and a separate map file (290KB PDF) (http://www.cityofamericancanyon.org/home/showdocument?id=15830). Please note that you must stay on trail throughout the course \"to avoid impacts to habitat and wildlife\". Also note that dogs are not allowed \"at this time\" (as of October 2018).\n\nYou can find permanent courses across the country by looking here (http://www.us.orienteering.org/new-o/resources/permanent-courses) on the Orienteering USA website.\n\n_______________"
