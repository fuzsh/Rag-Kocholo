        "text": "MPCSD's facilities are available to use by community organizations. On this page, you will find the process for outside user groups to reserve our spaces, along with other helpful information. The first step to reserving space is to create an account using our online system. If you are a part of a larger organization, please ensure that an account does not already exist within our system. You can request to be added as a new user to an existing account using the same link above.\n\nSteps for Reserving Space\n\nSTEP 1- CREATING AN ACCOUNT AND OBTANING INSURANCE\n\nClassification Information: Please read below and choose the following group that would apply before creating an account. Once your account is created you will need to upload your insurance. Please review the instructions on how to upload insurance. If you like, you may request insurance from your provider before creating your account. It could take a week or more to obtain, so please allow time for this. Having your insurance ready when you request the account will speed up the approval process. Once your organization's request is approved, you will be able to reserve space.\n\nCLASS\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nGroup 1\n\nDistrict Groups & Staff. School Related Groups (MPCSD PTO & MPAEF)\n\nGroup 2\n\nPublic or Government Organization (City use or use by other school districts) Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire USA, YMCA, parent-teacher associations. School-community advisory councils, and recreational youth sports leagues that charge participants no more than an average of $60 per month.\n\nInsurance Requirements: A Certificate of Insurance naming the Menlo Park City School District (limit no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence). We request that your insurance list the Menlo Park City School District as the certificate holder, and additional insured with the endorsement page with the address of 181 Encinal Avenue, Atherton, CA 94027.\n\nFor more information please read our MPCSD Facility Use Terms and Conditions. Once you have submitted insurance and your account has been approved, you will be notified by the ML Schedule system.\n\nStep 2- Reserving Space\n\nIf you know what school site you would like to reserve, please contact the Office Manager at that site for information on room availability and directions. After that, you can log in to ML Schedules to request the space. Once logged in, follow these instructions to complete your reservation. Please include any important setup information to help us coordinate with our facilities and technology teams, as additional charges may apply.\n\nStep 3- Awaiting Approval\n\nYour request will be approved in two stages. The first approval comes from the Office Manager or Assistant Principal., who will check for scheduling conflicts and space availability. The second approval came from our District Office, which will review organization information, verify insurance and finalize invoicing. You will receive an email confirmation for the final approval that will include your invoice.\n\nAllow a two or three days for these approvals. If you do not receive approval from our automated system or you feel your request is awaiting the second approval, please reach out to us at booking@mpcsd.org to let us know.\n\nStep 4- Problems Reserving Space and Cancellations\n\nOccasionally, issues can arise when reserving a space. You might have reserved the wrong day, time, room, or you might need to omit certain dates. You may also need to cancel dates after your request has been approved. If any of these situations occur, please contact us promptly. All facility requests and changes must be submitted at least 5 business days before the event.\n\nWeâ€™re happy to help. You may reach out to booking@mpcsd.org or call 650-321-7140, Ext: 5633.\n\nIf you fail to notify our District Office of a cancellation, additional fees may apply.\n\nSummer Rentals\n\nAs with other rental requests, summer rentals must be requested through ML Schedules. The District typically begins considering requests for summer rentals around mid-spring. This is because the availability of District facilities for summer rentals is determined by several factors:\n\nThe instructional calendar for the upcoming year is typically not finalized until mid-spring.\n\nDeep cleaning schedule for all school sites during June-August.\n\nSpace needs for the District's own summer programming.\n\nExisting joint use agreements with the City of Menlo Park for the field usage at Oak Knoll Elementary and Hillview Middle School.\n\nForms & Information on Facility Usage"
