He pointed out that in the current market, where conditions are soft, pushing the envelope on this dynamic helps differentiate projects. The success of Springline, designed to resemble a large resort, relied on symbiotic relationships between the landlord, residents, office tenants, and restaurant partners.\n\nVIEW ARTICLE +\n\n08 December 01, 2023 Springline’s Holiday Extravaganza set for December 2\n\nThe 2023 Holiday Extravaganza — featuring real snow to go sledding and build a snowman — will take place at the Plaza at Springline on Saturday, December 2, from 4:00 to 9:00 pm.

Mainly that we view our relationships with tenants as true partnerships as opposed to just a landlord thinking about rents and projected revenue. In this day and age, where the market is soft, you need to be pushing the envelope on that dynamic in order to differentiate yourself. We wanted Springline to feel like being in a large resort without being at an actual resort. In order for that to work, the relationships between landlord, the residents, office tenants and restaurant partners has to be symbiotic.\n\nVIEW ARTICLE +\n\n10 November 16, 2023 What's coming to town this holiday season\n\nSpringline Holiday Extravaganza An event with live music from The School of Rock and The Freshmakers, food, festive cocktails and hot chocolate, a snow playground with real snow, outdoor screening of “Elf” and fresh wreaths and garlands for sale, to raise funds for at-risk youth.
