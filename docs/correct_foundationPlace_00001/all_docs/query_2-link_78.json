        "text": "Picture Farm also played the role of art buyer, bringing in a regular collaborator, filmmaker Francesca Consarino, to head up the motion capture and editing.\n\nThe film productions varied from on-site shoots to carefully managed remote directing, using local talent.\n\nThe stills capture was coordinated with Magnum Photos, using their global network of talented artists.\n\nPost produced out of Picture Farm’s Brooklyn Navy Yard studio.\n\n“The Google.org Impact Challenge for Women and Girls commits $25 million to fund organizations creating pathways to prosperity for women and girls. This is an open call for applications, and selected charitable initiatives will receive up to $2 million, as well as opportunities for mentorship and additional support from Google.\"\n\nGender inequity is one of the most urgent challenges we face as a society, and COVID-19 has put the economic future of women and girls at even greater risk. At Google.org, we believe that solving big problems requires collective action, and the people closest to the challenges are often those closest to the solution.\n\nWe want to support organizations helping women and girls turn their economic potential into power: from programs addressing systemic barriers to economic equality, to those cultivating entrepreneurship, developing financial independence, and more.”"
