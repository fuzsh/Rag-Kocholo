        "text": "Description\n\nThe Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for oneâ€™s own analysis. The database covers approximately 35,000 power plants from 167 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type. It will be continuously updated as data becomes available.\n\nThe methodology for the dataset creation is given in the World Resources Institute publication \"A Global Database of Power Plants\". Data updates may occur without associated updates to this manuscript.\n\nThe database can be visualized on Resource Watch together with hundreds of other datasets.\n\nThe database is available for immediate download and use through the WRI Open Data Portal.\n\nAssociated code for the creation of the dataset can be found on GitHub. The bleeding-edge version of the database (which may contain substantial differences from the release you are viewing) is available on GitHub as well."
