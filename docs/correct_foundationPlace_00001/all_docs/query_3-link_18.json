Google can make use of this markup in knowledge panels and other visual elements (such as attribution), which helps users to find your organization's details on Google Search.\n\nHow to add structured data\n\nStructured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.\n\nHere's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.\n\nAdd as many recommended properties that apply to your web page. There are no required properties; instead, add the properties that apply to your content. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.\n\nFollow the guidelines.\n\nValidate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).\n\nDeploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.\n\nTo keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.\n\nExamples\n\nOrganization\n\nHere's an example of organization information in JSON-LD code.\n\n<html> <head> <title>About Us</title> <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"image\": \"https://www.example.com/example_image.jpg\", \"url\": \"https://www.example.com\", \"sameAs\": [\"https://example.net/profile/example1234\", \"https://example.org/example1234\"], \"logo\": \"https://www.example.com/images/logo.png\", \"name\": \"Example Corporation\", \"description\": \"The example corporation is well-known for producing high-quality widgets\", \"email\": \"contact@example.com\", \"telephone\": \"+47-99-999-9999\", \"address\": { \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\", \"streetAddress\": \"Rue Improbable 99\", \"addressLocality\": \"Paris\", \"addressCountry\": \"FR\", \"addressRegion\": \"Ile-de-France\", \"postalCode\": \"75001\" }, \"vatID\": \"FR12345678901\", \"iso6523Code\": \"0199:724500PMK2A2M1SQQ228\" } </script> </head> <body> </body> </html>\n\nOnlineStore with return policy (example subtype of Organization)\n\nHere's an example of online store information in JSON-LD code.\n\n<html> <head> <title>About Us</title> <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"OnlineStore\", \"name\": \"Example Online Store\", \"url\": \"https://www.example.com\", \"sameAs\": [\"https://example.net/profile/example12\", \"https://example.org/@example34\"], \"logo\": \"https://www.example.com/assets/images/logo.png\", \"contactPoint\": { \"contactType\": \"Customer Service\", \"email\": \"support@example.com\", \"telephone\": \"+47-99-999-9900\" }, \"vatID\": \"FR12345678901\", \"iso6523Code\": \"0199:724500PMK2A2M1SQQ228\", \"hasMerchantReturnPolicy\": { \"@type\": \"MerchantReturnPolicy\", \"applicableCountry\": [\"FR\", \"CH\"], \"returnPolicyCountry\": \"FR\", \"returnPolicyCategory\": \"https://schema.org/MerchantReturnFiniteReturnWindow\", \"merchantReturnDays\": 60, \"returnMethod\": \"https://schema.org/ReturnByMail\", \"returnFees\": \"https://schema.org/FreeReturn\", \"refundType\": \"https://schema.org/FullRefund\" } ... // Other Organization-level properties } </script> </head> <body> </body> </html>\n\nGuidelines\n\nYou must follow these guidelines to enable structured data to be eligible for inclusion in Google Search results.\n\nTechnical guidelines\n\nSearch Essentials\n\nGeneral structured data guidelines\n\nTechnical guidelines\n\nWe recommend placing this information on your home page, or a single page that describes your organization, for example the about us page. You don't need to include it on every page of your site.\n\nWe recommend using the most specific schema.org subtype of Organization that matches your organization. For example, if you have an ecommerce site, then we recommend using the OnlineStore subtype instead of OnlineBusiness. And if your site is about a local business, for example a restaurant or a physical store, then we recommend providing your administrative details using the most specific subtype(s) of LocalBusiness and following the required and recommended fields for Local business in addition to the fields recommended in this guide.\n\nStructured data type definitions\n\nGoogle recognizes the following properties of an Organization. To help Google better understand your page, include as many recommended properties that apply to your web page. There are no required properties; instead, add the properties that apply to your organization.\n\nRecommended properties address\n\nPostalAddress\n\nThe address (physical or mailing) of your organization, if applicable. Include all properties that apply to your country. The more properties you provide, the higher quality the result is for users.

If the return is free, returnFees must be set to https://schema.org/FreeReturn. If the consumer needs to handle and pay for the return shipping cost, returnFees must be set to https://schema.org/ReturnFeesCustomerResponsibility.\n\nAlternative approach to configuring return settings with Google\n\nRetailer return policies can get complicated and may change frequently. If you're having trouble indicating and keeping your return details up-to-date with markup and have a Google Merchant Center account, consider configuring your return policies in Google Merchant Center Help. You can alternatively configure account-level return policies in Search Console, which get automatically added to Merchant Center.\n\nCombining multiple shipping and return configurations\n\nIf you're combining various shipping and return configurations, keep in mind how you can override your policy information based on the order of precedence. For example, if you provide both organization-level markup on your site and return policy settings in Search Console, Google will only use the information provided in Search Console. If you submit a product feed in Merchant Center and configure shipping settings in Search Console, your Merchent Center feed information overrides your Search Console settings.\n\nHere's what takes precedence for shipping and return policy information (ordered by strength, with feeds being the strongest):\n\nProduct-level feeds submitted in Merchant Center\n\nContent API for Shopping (shipping or return settings\n\nSettings in Merchant Center or Search Console\n\nProduct-level merchant listing markup\n\nOrganization-level markup\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.\n\nIf you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.\n\nGoogle does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the General Structured Data Guidelines.\n\nYou might have an error in your structured data. Check the list of structured data errors and the Unparsable structured data report.\n\nIf you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.\n\nReview the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.\n\nTroubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results.\n\nAllow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.\n\nPost a question in the Google Search Central forum."
