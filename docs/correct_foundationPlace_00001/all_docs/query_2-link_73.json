        "text": "We are very happy to share that Abstract Wikipedia and Wikifunctions will be supported by a Google.org Fellowship. Let’s first introduce Google.org and the Fellowship program in their own words:\n\nAbout Google.org\n\nGoogle.org, Google’s philanthropic arm, supports nonprofits that address humanitarian issues and apply scalable, data-driven innovation to solving the world’s biggest challenges. They accelerate progress by connecting nonprofits with a unique blend of support that includes funding, products, and technical expertise from Google volunteers. They engage with these believers-turned-doers who make a significant impact on the communities they represent, and whose work has the potential to produce meaningful change. Google.org wants a world that works for everyone—and they believe technology and innovation can move the needle.\n\nGoogle.org Fellowship\n\nThe Google.org Fellowship enables Googlers to complete up to 6 months of full-time pro bono technical work to accelerate the social impact of nonprofits and civic entities. Fellows, including engineers, product managers, UX researchers, and designers, roll up their sleeves alongside the organization’s staff to help build open-source solutions and equip the organization to maintain and implement these solutions long after the Fellowship ends. Each year, 50+ Googlers provide 50,000+ hours of pro bono services assisting organizations to build solutions for some of the world’s toughest challenges.\n\nFor nine months, up to 10 Google.org Fellows will be supporting the Abstract Wikipedia and Wikifunctions team. Most of their focus will be on the backend of Wikifunctions: in other words, they will work towards making the evaluation of functions far more efficient. This will enable Wikifunctions to grow without immediately overwhelming the computing resources we have available at the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\nThe Fellows will also work on a few other projects about which we will share updates in the weeks and months to come. We will also publish a detailed report in the end about the impact and the results of the work. Several Fellows will start their work in April this month, and we’ll bring on others to begin work in July.\n\nAs with all of our work, the work of the Fellows will be open source and developed in the open, using our usual workflows and tools. The Fellows will work under the direction of the Wikimedia Foundation, and will, during the time of the Fellowship, interact with the community and others just like every other employee or contractor.\n\nThe contributions of the Fellows are expected to allow us to launch sooner and scale Wikifunctions much faster than we would otherwise be able to. This also will allow us to focus on Abstract Wikipedia sooner than we had expected over the last year, and thus ultimately speed up to deliver on our mission of allowing more people to share knowledge in more languages.\n\nIn the following, we let the Fellows introduce themselves in their own words.\n\nIf you have further questions or comments, feel free to ask on wiki or on the Abstract Wikipedia mailing list. We are very thankful to Google.org for offering us this co-operative program.\n\nThis relationship is not exclusive to them; if other companies, universities, or other groups would be interested in making similar donations in kind towards the Wikimedia movement, we would be delighted to work with them, too. You can reach out to us at partnerships@wikimedia.org.\n\nOur work with the Fellows is part of an ongoing relationship between the Foundation, Google, and Google.org. We’re happy to continue our work with both entities to support a healthy web ecosystem, making knowledge more accessible and representative of the diversity of the web’s users.\n\nOriginally published by Denny Vrandečić on April 12, 2022 on Media-wiki"
