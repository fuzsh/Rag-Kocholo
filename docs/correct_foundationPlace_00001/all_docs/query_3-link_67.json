        "text": "Service Updates\n\nPIERCE TRANSIT ADJUSTS SERVICE ON JUNE 9 AND JULY 6, 2024\n\nBelow, you’ll find an overview of the improvements you’ll see this summer. For trip planning or real-time arrival information, try our Trip Planner, use Transit app, check transit center monitors, or call Customer Service at 253.581.8000, option 2.\n\nRoute 400: Effective June 9, the Weekday schedule has one morning trip adjustment, northbound toward Commerce Street Station, to improve connections with Sounder trains.\n\nRoute 497: Effective June 9, the Weekday schedule has one evening trip adjustment, southbound toward Lakeland Hills, to improve connections with Sounder trains. After Sounder train riders have boarded the bus, Route 497 buses depart promptly.\n\nRoute 101: Effective July 6 through August 31, 2024, the Gig Harbor Trolley returns with service on Thursdays and Saturdays. Trolley fares are the same as Pierce Transit bus fares.\n\nUpcoming Holiday Services\n\nPierce Transit modifies some service to more closely match ridership levels on holidays and days around those holidays. For example, Independence Day 2024 falls on a Thursday, but Pierce Transit buses will be following Sunday schedules that day, and the Customer Service Center (Bus Shop) will be closed. Visit our Holiday Service page for more information .\n\nACCURATE INFORMATION AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nPierce Transit is committed to providing you with the most current bus schedule and arrival information that is available.\n\nPierce Transit provides free Wi-Fi on buses, and has invested in other technology to help riders access bus information “live,” in real-time. The agency delivers accurate bus information to our riders through multiple channels:\n\nPublic website PierceTransit.org, for complete schedules (to view, download, or print), maps, trip planning, service alerts, and real-time information. See how to print a bus schedule and map here. Learn more about our Trip Planner here.\n\nMonitors at major boarding hubs, showing real-time arrival information.\n\nTransit app: for trip planning and real-time information.\n\nRoute alerts by subscription: sign up at PierceTransit.org/StayConnected.\n\nCall (from any phone), or text (from a smart phone) your bus stop number to 253.533.7084 for real-time arrival information.\n\nCall Customer Service for assistance at 253.581.8000, option 2, then option 2 again. You may also request free printed schedules from our Customer Service department.\n\nPierce Transit continues to look for new resources to help make transit more convenient. For example, using Transit app, you can plan a trip that combines a bus and on-demand Runner service, and buy a ticket too! As well, we know that not all customers have access to smart phones and data plans. However, we have found the following programs that assist low- and moderate-income persons with free or reduced phones and service. You probably qualify if:\n\n(1) You already participate in another state or federal assistance program such as the EBT program, food stamps, public housing, or Medicaid (and others).\n\nOR\n\n(2) Your household income is at or below 135% to 150% of the poverty level according to your state and/or the Federal Poverty Guidelines.\n\nAssurance wireless - https://www.assurancewireless.com\n\nEmergency Broadband Benefit: https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit\n\nenTouch wireless - http://entouchwireless.com\n\nLifeLine Support for Affordable Communications Application: https://www.lifelinesupport.org\n\nLifeLine Support for Affordable Communications Information: https://www.fcc.gov/lifeline-consumers\n\nQ Link Wireless -https://qlinkwireless.com\n\nSafe Link Wireless - https://www.safelinkwireless.com\n\nTerracom wireless - https://www.terracomwireless.com\n\nTru Connect- https://www.truconnect.com\n\nThe list above is not all-inclusive, but this is a good starting point. Please contact these organizations directly for assistance if you are interested."
