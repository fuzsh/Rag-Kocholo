        "text": "Its name is synonymous with searching for information online, but Google has so much more going on.\n\nThe tech giant was founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The company’s humble beginning in a garage in Menlo Park, California seems like a distant memory as it now has offices around the world including its main campus in Silicon Valley.\n\nIn 2015, Google restructured itself to create a holding company called Alphabet to simplify its structure, promote accountability, and give its business units more autonomy.\n\nOver the years Alphabet and Google have entered into new markets and strengthened its position in existing ones through a variety of acquisitions. This tactic, which allows the titan to plug knowledge gaps and stay ahead of competitors, has led it to make hundreds of acquisitions, some of which you have heard of, and many of which you haven’t.\n\nIn addition to its host of acquired companies, Google has a roster of successful internal ventures that have been spun out of its moonshot factory, called X.\n\nSo what are these companies that are housed under Alphabet and Google’s corporate umbrella? We’ve pulled together a list of some of the largest and most innovative ventures owned by the tech giant."
