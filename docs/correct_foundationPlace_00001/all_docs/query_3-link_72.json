        "text": "Hi @Thijs,\n\nI'm assuming that you have addresses @somedomain.com, and not @gmail.com.\n\nWhen I reffer to \"shared drives\" I mean real shared drives (https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/7212025), not folders that are shared.\n\nIf that's the case, you can upgrade the account of that single user to a Google Workspace Business Standard account.\n\nIf you had a team account, you'll also have to verify domain ownership to upgrade to a \"real\" Google Workspace account.\n\nThen, that user can create a shared drive, and move the files there. Depending on who owns the rest of the data, that user might even be able to move folders. If not, you'll need to recreate the folder structure and move files, folder by folder.\n\nWhen the files are in the shared drive (or before moving them), that user can add the other users as members, if needed, to keep their access active.\n\nAfter having all the data in a shared drive, that user or another user with the right permissions for that shared drive will be able to drag everything out, to their \"My Drive\". Once that's done, you can downgrade to Business Starter and, if that's the plan, add the rest of the users (or \"transfer the unmanaged user with addresses @thesamedomain).\n\nNote: there may be some limitations, depending on how the rest of users are created (like, if they are in the same unverified domain, or all in a different domain, or each in a separate domain, or some have @gmail accounts... etc.)\n\nIf you find this confusing and need help, let me know. You can also send me a direct email to thijs.drive@cloudguardians.com (this is a temporary email address, valid for 7 days).\n\nRegards,\n\nNuno"
