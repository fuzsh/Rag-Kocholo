        "text": "Our work is dedicated to giving every child a quality education. We believe this can only be achieved if education policy and practice are supported by evidence of what works best for children.\n\nWe therefore invest in the worldâ€™s premier research to discover how children learn, promote the use of evidence by schools and EdTech, and support countries to shape and implement education policies based on evidence.\n\nOur support goes beyond simply making funding available. We are an active and engaged funder and seek to apply our knowledge and competences in all our work.\n\nWe work with leading researchers, school practitioners, EdTech companies, investors, and education policymakers to catalyze new research, financing mechanisms, and policy collaborations that would not otherwise be possible.\n\nOur learning and evaluation approach is designed to empower us to make better decisions and work more effectively so that more children can experience quality education.\n\nWe want to learn rapidly and iteratively so we can provide support in areas that show the greatest promise for long-lasting, systemic impact. We share our learning openly, to enable its widest possible application and to achieve long-lasting impact for education systems around the world."
