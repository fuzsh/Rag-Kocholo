About

My name is Jason Toff and I'm a product guy with a relentless desire to help people express themselves creatively. Iâ€™m currently a Director of Product Management at Facebook in Menlo Park, California. Previously, I was a Partner at Area 120, PM Director at Twitter, GM at Vine, PM at YouTube, and marketing lead for Gmail.

Outside of work, sit on the board for PALS Programs, a non-profit I co-founded in 2004 that creates summer camps and programs for young adults with Down syndrome. In general, I love creating things, working with nice people, and spending time with my family.
