Indie Week has existed for 18 years and successfully produced

a 5-day conference with resounding positive feedback.

"I had an absolute blast, and it really felt like I was attending a conference all week, it was great...that was the best virtual conference I've attended."

Dave Cool

“I've been involved in quite a few "online" conferences this year, most of

them disappointing to say the least. Then there is Indie Week. Probably the

most organized and professional event I've seen so far this year.”

Bob Bender

(The Business Side of Music)
