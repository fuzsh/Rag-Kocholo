        "text": "Now over 75 years old, the annual Indiana University Writers’ Conference enjoys a national reputation as an immersive event featuring workshops and craft classes in poetry and fiction, as well as readings and panels for poets, fiction writers, and nonfiction writers.\n\nParticipants in the conference’s early years included Katherine Anne Porter, James T. Farrell, Lillian Hellman, Nelson Algren, John Berryman, Randall Jarrell, Stephen Spender, Gwendolyn Brooks, Karl Shapiro, and Allen Tate.\n\nMore recently, the conference has involved Mark Doty, Robert Olen Butler, Marilyn Chin, Aimee Bender, Reginald McKnight, Gerald Stern, Charles Baxter, Jean Thompson, Galway Kinnell, Richard Wilbur, Kevin Young, Li-Young Lee, Michael Martone, Howard Nemerov, John Keene, Lisel Mueller, Stanley Plumly, Ishmael Reed, Al Young, Cleopatra Mathis, Mary Robison, David Bradley, Grace Paley, Lynda Barry, Dan Chaon, Adrian Matejka, Alissa Nutting, Gabrielle Calvocoressi, Lou Berney, and John-Paul Zaccarini.\n\nBeyond the inspiration provided by the presence of such well-known and accomplished writers, the conference offers camaraderie, exposure to startling and extraordinary language, and a chance to hone your own craft. It’s a place where the writers of tomorrow gather and connect.\n\nAcademic credit (both undergraduate and graduate) is available for writing workshops at this summer conference."
