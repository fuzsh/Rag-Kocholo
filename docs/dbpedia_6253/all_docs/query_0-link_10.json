        "text": "WOOD RIVER, Ill. -- Blake Bender carded a team-best 76 in the final round to place fourth and lead the Simpson men's golf team to a second-place finish at the Blackburn Invitational from Lockhaven Golf Course.\n\nSimpson shot 648 in the two-round tournament to open the spring season, turning in a 326 Saturday and closing with a 322 Sunday. The Storm finished behind tournament champion Knox, which won the tournament with a 36-hold total of 615.\n\nBender's 4-over 76 represented the lowest round of the weekend for the Storm. He opened the tournament with a 78, closing the weekend at 154, just four strokes back of tournament medalist Duncan Wheeler of Knox.\n\nNathan Eaton fired back-to-back rounds of 79 to finish with 158, good for eighth in the individual standings. Austin Hronich shaved seven strokes from Saturday's opening round, carding a 79 to finish in 17th place.\n\nZach Kreider (24th) and Lucas Hemphill (38th) rounded out Simpson's finishers in the field of 42 golfers.\n\nUp Next\n\nSimpson will compete in the Jim Weatherbee Invite in Galesburg, Ill. on Friday and Saturday, March 29-30."
