Participants’ perceptions of the action research conferences were positive. The framework illustrated factors related to the core principle of getting the “whole system” in the room that were linked to post-conference outcomes and challenges. Systemic relationships between organizers and stakeholders can affect the achievement of the conditions for success and illustrate how interventions with very similar topics and methods can represent entirely different system level tasks. My study supports the importance of the conditions for success framework.",
