        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas - Washington coach Bob Bender has emerged as the front-runner for the basketball coaching job at Texas, according to a high-ranking university source.\n\nBender, 40, met with Texas officials in Dallas on Tuesday on his way back from vacationing in Florida.\n\nThe source, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the job hadn't been offered to anyone as of late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBut the source added that Bender had moved to the top of Texas' short list after school officials became concerned about what it would cost to land Utah's Rick Majerus, who last week turned down a reported annual salary of just more than $1 million at Arizona State.\n\nOklahoma basketball coach Kelvin Sampson, who interviewed Monday night in Dallas with Texas officials, had the telephone number at his home changed Tuesday and was unavailable for comment.\n\nSeveral Oklahoma City television stations reported Tuesday night that Sampson planned to stay at OU and did not consider the meeting with UT officials to be an interview.\n\nSources told The Oklahoman that Sampson talked to OU interim athletic director Larry Naifeh late Tuesday afternoon. In their discussion, Sampson did not indicate to Naifeh that Texas had made any job offer. Sampson, however, also did not tell Naifeh that he was definitely staying at OU.\n\nNaifeh was in Dallas on Monday and Tuesday for Big 12 Conference meetings and unavailable for comment.\n\nTexas athletic director DeLoss Dodds has said the basketball coach won't be paid more than football coach Mack Brown, who makes $750,000 annually.\n\n\"You have to consider the guy (Majerus) just because of what he's done at Utah,\" the source said, referring to the Utes' appearance in this year's national title game.\n\nBut Bender's ability to turn programs around at Illinois State and Washington, his pedigree as a former assistant to Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski and an engaging, easygoing personality appear to have won Texas officials over.\n\nUnlike former Texas coach Tom Penders and Majerus, who have reputations for speaking their minds, regardless of what university administrators may think, Bender fits Texas' buttoned-down image as a company man. He also fits the UT budget, making around $350,000 at Washington. BIOG: NAME: UPD:\n\nArchive ID: 718205"
