The Red Storm held a 61-51 lead with 8:34 remaining before Cook hit a 3-pointer to give Duke a 63-61 lead inside six minutes.\n\nBox Score\n\nMOST WINS, DIVISION I MEN'S COACHES Rank Coach Wins Losses 1 Mike Krzyzewski 1,000 308 2 Jim Boeheim 961 325 3 Bob Knight 902 371 4 Dean Smith 879 254 5 Adolph Rupp 876 190\n\n\"Coach Krzyzewski has spent his career equipping young men for success on the court and in life,\" NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement. \"Congratulations to Coach K on his 1,000th win, which is an historic achievement and important milestone in his remarkable career as a coach, educator and mentor.\"\n\nKrzyzewski's coaching career began as an assistant on Bobby Knight's staff with the Indiana Hoosiers in 1974. Coach K was named the head coach at Army in 1975, and was 73-59 in five season before accepting the Duke position in 1980.\n\nHe won his 900th game on March 20, 2011, and on Nov. 15, 2011, earned No. 903 to eclipse Knight's record for the most Division I victories.\n\nKrzyzewski's tenure at Duke has included four national championships (1991, 1992, 2001 and 2010) among 11 Final Four appearances in 29 tournament trips -- including 19 consecutive (1996 to 2014), the second-longest current streak behind Kansas (25). Coach K has the most tournament wins among active coaches (82-25).\n\nCoach K is the second DI coach to reach the milestone. Tennessee women's coach Pat Summitt finished with 1,098 wins.\n\nCoach K's coaching tree includes 12 players and assistant coaches who have become head coaches:\n\n• Tommy Amaker: Seton Hall (1997-2001), Michigan (2001-07), Harvard (2007-present)\n\n• Bob Bender: Illinois State (1989-92) Washington (1993-2002)\n\n• Mike Brey: Delaware (1995-2000), Notre Dame (2000-present)\n\n• Jeff Capel: VCU (2002-06), Oklahoma (2006-11)\n\n• Chris Collins: Northwestern (2013-present)\n\n• Johnny Dawkins: Stanford (2008-present)\n\n• Mike Dement: UNC Greensboro (1991-95, 2005-11), SMU (1995-2004)\n\n• David Henderson: Delaware (2000-06)\n\n• Bobby Hurley: Buffalo (2013-present)\n\n• Tim O'Toole: Fairfield (1998-2006)\n\n• Quin Snyder: Missouri (1999-2006)\n\n• Chuck Swenson: William & Mary (1987-94)\n\n• Steve Wojciechowski: Marquette (2014-present)\n\nTwo former players -- Jeff Capel and Nate James -- are assistants at Duke, and Jon Scheyer, another former player, is a special assistant for Coach K.\n\nAtlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry and Brooklyn Nets GM Billy King are former players for Krzyzewski.\n\nOther former players who are professional-league assistants include Bob Bender (NBA's Atlanta Hawks) and Chip Engelland (NBA's San Antonio Spurs) as well as Chris Carrawell NBDL's Springfield Armor).\n\nOf note, Brey was the first former assistant coach to defeat Coach K, when Notre Dame nipped Duke 79-77 during the 2013-14 season.\n\nThe floor at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium is named Coach K Court in Krzyzewski's honor, and the basketball practice facility is the Michael W. Krzyzewski Center.\n\nArmy inducted Krzyzewski into its sports hall of fame on Sept. 11, 2009. West Point also annually awards the Coach K Teaching Character Through Sports honor each spring to cadets and coaches who display superior ethics and character through sport.\n\nCoach K was the 1989 Naismith national coach of the year and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2001. Krzyzewski has been the ACC coach of the year five times (1984, 1986, 1997, 1999 and 2000).\n\nAs well as Coach K gameplans, he also works throughout the game with his players -- and on the officials.\n\nKrzyzewski's preparation has resulted in 1,000 wins (and counting) as well as 28 first-round NBA draft choices, the first being forward Mark Alarie by Denver in 1986.\n\nCoach K has been mentoring players for so long that the first player drafted from his tenure at Duke was Kenny Dennard, chosen by the Kansas City Kings in '81 (the team moved to Sacramento for the 1985-86 season).\n\nTwo Blue Devils have been the No. 1 overall pick: forward Elton Brand in 1999 (Chicago) and Kyrie Irving in 2011 (Cleveland).\n\nMike Krzyzewski’s Career Record Season School Record Postseason 1975-76 Army Black Knights 11-14 1976-77 Army Black Knights 20-8 1977-78 Army Black Knights 19-9 NIT First Round 1978-79 Army Black Knights 14-11 1979-80 Army Black Knights 9-17 1980-81 Duke Blue Devils 17-13 NIT Third Round 1981-82 Duke Blue Devils 10-17 1982-83 Duke Blue Devils 11-17 1983-84 Duke Blue Devils 24-10 NCAA Round of 32 1984-85 Duke Blue Devils 23-8 NCAA Round of 32 1985-86 Duke Blue Devils 37-3 NCAA Runner-up 1986-87 Duke Blue Devils 24-9 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 1987-88 Duke Blue Devils 28-7 NCAA Final Four 1988-89 Duke Blue Devils 28-8 NCAA Final Four 1989-90 Duke Blue Devils 29-9 NCAA Runner-up 1990-91 Duke Blue Devils 32-7 NCAA Champions 1991-92 Duke Blue Devils 34-2 NCAA Champions 1992-93 Duke Blue Devils 24-8 NCAA Round of 32 1993-94 Duke Blue Devils 28-6 NCAA Runner-up 1994-95 * Duke Blue Devils 9-3 1995-96 Duke Blue Devils 18-13 NCAA Round of 64 1996-97 Duke Blue Devils 24-9 NCAA Round of 32 1997-98 Duke Blue Devils 32-4 NCAA Elite Eight 1998-99 Duke Blue Devils 37-2 NCAA Runner-up 1999-00 Duke Blue Devils 29-5 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 2000-01 Duke Blue Devils 35-4 NCAA Champions 2001-02 Duke Blue Devils 31-4 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 2002-03 Duke Blue Devils 26-7 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 2003-04 Duke Blue Devils 31-6 NCAA Final Four 2004-05 Duke Blue Devils 27-6 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 2005-06 Duke Blue Devils 32-4 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 2006-07 Duke Blue Devils 22-11 NCAA Round of 64 2007-08 Duke Blue Devils 28-6 NCAA Round of 32 2008-09 Duke Blue Devils 30-7 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 2009-10 Duke Blue Devils 35-5 NCAA Champions 2010-11 Duke Blue Devils 32-5 NCAA Sweet Sixteen 2011-12 Duke Blue Devils 27-7 NCAA Round of 64 2012-13 Duke Blue Devils 30-6 NCAA Elite Eight 2013-14 Duke Blue Devils 26-9 NCAA Round of 64 2014-15 Duke Blue Devils 17-2 TOTALS 1,000-308 * -- Krzyzewski coached the first 12 games of season before leaving the team for back surgery and to recover from exhaustion.\n\nDuke Players Selected in the NBA Draft During Coach K’s Tenure (1980-81 to present) Year Round Pick Player Pos.
