        "text": "Expert Treatment for Varicose Veins\n\nVaricose veins are enlarged and twisted rope-like veins that you can see just under the surface of the skin, usually in the legs. For many people, varicose veins and spider veins (a milder form of varicose veins) are mainly a cosmetic issue.\n\nBut when varicose veins cause symptoms such as swelling, leg fatigue and heaviness, itching, burning or pain, they are a medical concern. That’s because the symptoms indicate a problem with your circulation (how blood travels throughout your body) called venous insufficiency or venous reflux.\n\nOur Board certified interventional cardiologists are experts at treating conditions that affect your circulation, and we’ve been treating varicose veins for many years with a high success rate.\n\nUsing state-of-the-art laser technology, we provide highly effective, relatively painless treatments that don’t require any surgery. Therefore, recovery is quick and you can get back to your life right away. Plus, our approach is scientifically proven to give the best long-term results compared to other treatment options. Importantly, treatment is covered by most insurance plans, including Medicare.\n\nIf you need relief from leg pain or other health issues caused by varicose veins, call us today at (207) 885-9905 to schedule an appointment with one of our varicose vein experts.\n\nVascular Ultrasound Imaging\n\nWith vascular ultrasound imaging, a specialist moves a small instrument known as a transducer gently across your body. The transducer produces high-frequency sound waves that “bounce” off your blood vessels (vasculature) and are used to create images of the two big arteries of your neck (carotid) that carry blood to the brain, arteries of the abdomen, and more.\n\nThis test helps doctors look for narrowing of your arteries (stenosis), which can lead to a stroke or leg pain. It also helps doctors evaluate neurologic symptoms and other disease risk, assess patients at risk for blockages, and follow the progress of known arterial ailments. They also use it to check for:\n\nArterial wall damage\n\nBlood flow after surgery\n\nPeripheral artery disease\n\nBlood clots and other blockages\n\nTumors, aneurysms, and malformations\n\nVascular ultrasound is safe, effective, and painless. (It's the same technology used to image babies in the wombs of pregnant women.)"
