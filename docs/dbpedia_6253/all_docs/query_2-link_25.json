        "text": "The Florida Association of Counties (FAC) presented Escambia County Chairman and District 4 Commissioner Robert Bender with the Presidential Advocacy Award for his work during the 2021 Legislative Session at its recent Annual Conference in Orange County, Fla.\n\n“I am proud to make a positive impact on issues related to our community,” said Chairman and District 4 Commissioner Robert Bender. “Escambia County is well-represented on the Florida Association of Counties committees and the Florida Counties Foundation Board focusing on many of the key components that make Escambia County a great place to live, play and work.”\n\nThe FAC Presidential Advocacy Award recognizes county commissioners who have shown exceptional leadership in advocating with FAC during the 2021 session to advance counties’ legislative agenda and preserve home rule.\n\n“Every day, our Commissioners work hard to tackle complex challenges and respond to the unique needs of their local area,” said FAC President and Palm Beach County Commissioner, Melissa McKinlay. “Their consistent drive and dedication for their constituents is the reason we’re able to sustain our communities, and those that take the extra mile to advance the counties’ legislative agenda play a leading role in improving quality of life for all Floridians.”\n\nEscambia County is proud to announce Bender has been reappointed to the District 1 seat to the FAC Board of Directors. He was also appointed by new FAC President Ralph Thomas, Commissioner for Wakulla County to serve as Vice Chair on the Finance, Tax and Administration committee. Finally, the the Institute for County Government recognized Bender for completing the Advanced County Commissioner training in 2020, and he is currently working on completing ACC II training.\n\nFor more than 85 years, the Florida Association of Counties has represented the diverse interests of Florida’s counties, emphasizing the importance of protecting home rule – the concept that government closest to the people governs best. The Florida Association of Counties helps counties effectively serve and represent Floridians by strengthening and preserving county home rule through advocacy, education and collaboration."
