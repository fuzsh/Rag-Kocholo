        "text": "Dear members of the Marist College community,\n\nWe are pleased to provide a summary of the spring meeting of the Board of Trustees, which took place on May 3-4, 2024.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 3 COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND EVENTS\n\nFollowing a series of Friday standing committee meetings, members of the Board’s Academic Affairs Committee engaged in a constructive dialogue with members of the Faculty's Academic Affairs (AAC) and Faculty Affairs Committees (FAC) on several factors of interest brought forward by the faculty. The meeting included a broad-ranging discussion on challenges to colleges’ Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives nationwide and what Marist can do to help, prepare, and protect its faculty in the classroom. In addition, there was discussion regarding the pros and cons of a potential transition from a college to a university.\n\nBoard members participated in an interactive workshop with DLR Group, focusing on the Campus Master Plan, similar to those that occurred on campus for staff and faculty that same week. Additionally, Daryl Richard ’97, Vice President of Communications and Marketing, offered an update on the Marist Brand Study that also included information sharing and discussion about the “college vs. university” question, a matter left for further review/discussion in the Fall after additional forms of surveying, socializing, and consideration are completed.\n\nFollowing the day of committee meetings, many Trustees enjoyed dinner provided by Marist College Dining Services in the Cabaret with leaders from the Student Government Association (SGA) and faculty from the AAC and FAC. After dinner, many trustees attended the 38th Annual Silver Needle Runway (SNR) titled Interlinked at the McCann Arena. On behalf of the entire Board, we extend our heartfelt congratulations to the senior Fashion Design students for showcasing their creations; the student directors for producing the show; and all the students, faculty, and staff whose dedication and expertise contributed to an exceptional evening. Special congratulations to Deanna McNally for winning the 2024 Designer of the Year award!\n\nSATURDAY, MAY 4 BOARD MEETING\n\nThe Saturday full Board meeting began with the recognition of four transitions. The Board expressed its appreciation to Dr. Nicholas Marshall, Associate Professor of History, as his term as the Faculty Representative to the Board concluded. Additionally, the Board acknowledged the service of Amanda DeFalco ’24, President of SGA, during her tenure as the 2023-2024 Student Representative to the Board of Trustees. The Board welcomed Sheridan Speight ’25, the incoming SGA President, who will participate in next year’s meetings. Lastly, the Board honored Bro. John W. Klein, FMS ’70, for his 15 years of service on the Board of Trustees, noting his wisdom and embodiment of the school’s values.\n\nAcademic updates\n\nThe Board has reviewed and unanimously approved 10 faculty tenure and/or promotion cases. We appreciate all faculty members who participated in the tenure and promotion review process, particularly those who served on peer-review committees or the Rank and Tenure Committee. We congratulate the following faculty members on their tenure and/or promotion:\n\nCatherine (Kate) Chaterdon - Tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of English\n\nDooRi Chung - Promotion to Senior Professional Lecturer of Fashion Design\n\nStephanie Conover - Promotion to Senior Professional Lecturer of Fashion Merchandising\n\nAmanda Damiano - Tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Communication\n\nKristen Dovgan - Tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Psychology\n\nChristina Wright Fields - Tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Education\n\nBrian Loh - Promotion to Senior Lecturer of Religious Studies\n\nKristin Mende - Promotion to Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy\n\nJeffrey (Jeff) Midgley - Promotion to Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy\n\nJamie Perillo - Promotion to Distinguished Professional Lecturer of Fashion Design\n\nFollowing the recommendation of AAC, the full Board unanimously approved six revisions to the Faculty Handbook. These revisions, endorsed by the full faculty during a recent plenary session, included modifications to sections referencing Teaching Associates, sabbaticals, the Technology Committee (Online Distance Education Committee), the Graduate Council, Emeritus/a faculty, and Clinical faculty ranks.\n\nHighlights from other standing committee reports\n\nThe Board received a report on fall 2024 admissions activities, detailing the applications, acceptances, and deposits for the Class of 2028. Despite the fact that applications were up over 10% this year, the Admissions & Enrollment Committee noted challenges in the higher education market, such as issues with the FAFSA form rollout and delays in financial aid decisions by public institutions. Nevertheless, the College anticipates meeting its budgeted enrollment goal for new students with an incoming class that exhibits strong academic quality and diversity.\n\nThe administration presented a balanced operating budget proposal for the fiscal year 2025. This budget was considered alongside a memo authored by the Priorities and Resources Committee. After deliberation, the Finance Committee endorsed the proposal, which was subsequently unanimously approved by the full Board. As in recent years, the administration will soon communicate additional information about next year’s budget to the campus community.\n\nThe Audit Committee also reported on its review and acceptance of the 990 and 990T forms.\n\nThe Buildings and Grounds Committee provided an update on the Dyson Center, confirming that the construction project remains on schedule and within budget. The building’s occupants will move in over the summer, ahead of the fall 2024 semester. Members of the full Board participated in a hard-hat tour with Pike Construction and the Director of Physical Plant, Justin Butwell. The Committee also discussed that the track and turf field and the Sammon House renovation remain on time and budget as well.\n\nThe College Advancement Committee provided an update on its year-to-date fundraising efforts, focusing on the College’s inaugural Day of Giving in March, which attracted support from over 2,900 donors, raising $562,554. The Committee also reported on plans underway to support the College’s upcoming comprehensive campaign, and on the recent announcement of Kevin and Beth Weinman’s $500,000 gift to the Presidential Fund for Equity in the Marist Experience (the “Presidential Equity Fund”), adding to their initial gift of $250,000 in December 2021.\n\nPresident’s Report\n\nKevin Weinman began his report by summarizing various year-end events and activities that bring excitement to the academic year's conclusion for students, faculty, and staff. He highlighted his participation in a variety of theatre, dance, and musical performances; Senior Days at athletic events; the SGA transition ceremony; Honors thesis presentations; and the Riverside Ride Fest—a student-led cycling event raising funds for the Presidential Equity Fund.\n\nHe informed the Board that, following Commencement, he plans to travel to the Florence branch campus for their Commencement exercises and participate in several short-term attachment courses abroad. He addressed unrest related to the violence in the Middle East on college campuses across the country. He noted that Marist has prioritized and fostered opportunities for dialogue since October 7 and maintained “open door” policies for meetings with students and faculty on this topic, but that he remains mindful that many in the Marist community are suffering and struggling with this ongoing global conflict. Finally, he updated the Board on the plans to launch work on a comprehensive Sustainability Action Plan, as promised in Marist 100, and discussed the rapidly shifting landscape for college athletics.\n\nThe next Open Session meeting of the Board of Trustees is scheduled to take place in November. We will look forward to updating members of the campus community on the major outcomes of that meeting. Congratulations to all on a successful conclusion to the spring 2024 semester, including several joyous Commencement ceremonies.\n\nRoss A. Mauri '80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees\n\nKevin C. Weinman\n\nPresident\n\nDear members of the Marist College community,\n\nEarlier this month (February 2-3) the Marist College Board of Trustees held its winter meeting. Below please find a summary of the weekend’s events and outcomes.\n\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 2: COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND EVENTS\n\nFriday's program began with an orientation for the four new members of the Board of Trustees, who were participating in their first set of meetings: Rajesh K. Kothapalli '92M, Thomas M. Murray '02, C. James Taylor III, and Elizabeth K. Venuti, PhD P'15/'17.\n\nFollowing a series of Friday standing committee meetings, trustees participated in a working session on strategic plan implementation. This session built on conversations begun at the December 2023 meeting about establishing a board-level dashboard with key performance indicators related to each of the strategic plan’s pillars and measurable goals developed based on benchmarking against peer and aspirant institutions. The board also received an update on efforts underway through the Communications & Marketing department to elevate the Marist brand.\n\nMembers of the Board continued these discussions over dinner, where we were also pleased to re-present the Board of Trustees Faculty Award for Distinguished Teaching to the 2023 recipient, Tony Carrizales. We extend our congratulations once again to Tony, for the exceptional record of teaching, scholarship, and service that led his peers to select him for this honor. Following dinner, many trustees headed down to the McCann Arena to cheer on the men’s basketball team as they took on Mount St. Mary's.\n\nSATURDAY, FEBRUARY 3: BOARD MEETING\n\nOn Saturday the Board reconvened, this time joined by members of the administration and the 2023-2024 Faculty and Student Representatives to the Board of Trustees. Our thanks to Vernon Murray (who attended in place of Faculty Affairs Committee Chair Nicholas Marshall) and Student Government Association President Amanda DeFalco '24 for their contributions to the meeting and participation in shared governance.\n\nThe meeting began with a moment of silence in honor of Brendan T. Burke '68, former president of the Alumni Executive Board and a member of the Board of Trustees for 26 years. Members of the Board offered their personal reflections on Brendan’s impact on their lives and his many contributions to the Marist College community. We also extended our gratitude to trustee Neil Bender P'18 as he concluded his term of service on the Board.\n\nStanding committee updates\n\nWe’re pleased to report that, acting on the recommendation of the Board's Academic Affairs Committee, the full Board reviewed and unanimously approved three faculty promotions. Please join us in thanking those who served on peer-review committees or the Rank & Tenure Committee for the role they played in the promotion process, and join us in congratulating the following faculty members on their accomplishments:\n\nTony Carrizales, Professor of Public Administration\n\nYvonne Egitto, Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy\n\nKaren \"Kat\" Schrier, Professor of Games and Interactive Media\n\nThe Buildings and Grounds Committee reported on the progress of a number of projects, including the Dyson Center, which remains on time and on budget, and the track-and-turf field facility under development on the north end of campus. Trustees also received information about plans to renovate the historic St. Ann’s building to serve a dual purpose: a second-floor apartment to be occupied by the College’s president and family, and first-floor event space to host community meetings, lectures, and events. The Board unanimously endorsed a fundraising effort to name the new facility Sammon House, in honor of the late Brother Seán Sammon FMS '70, a longtime Marist Trustee, Scholar in Residence, and former Superior General of the Marist Brothers. Additional information about this project can be found here.\n\nThe Board received a report from the Admission & Enrollment Committee on fall 2024 undergraduate admissions, including the Early Action, Early Decision, and Regular Decision pools, which were up nearly 11% over the prior year. The Committee reported on ongoing application review and yield activities planned for the Class of 2028, with significant time spent in discussion about the disruptions to financial aid packages caused by delays in the rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College's strategies to assist families through additional outreach and communication.\n\nAs the Board's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee evolves from an ad hoc to a standing committee of the Board, the Committee reviewed a proposed charter further defining the mission, purpose, and areas of responsibility that will guide its work in the years ahead. The Committee also discussed a recent New York Times article outlining efforts underway in multiple states to pass legislation designed to limit or even ban DEI offices and initiatives on college campuses. As part of its analysis, the Committee reviewed a copy of Marist 100 that had been annotated to show how comprehensive and extensive various DEI-related concepts and language are throughout the plan, as an illustration of the strategic importance of this work to the College’s future success.\n\nAs always, the meeting concluded with a Report from the President. Among other comments, Kevin reflected at length on the troubling escalation of attacks on institutional efforts to become more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. He suggested that, while much criticism of DEI was misguided and either misinformed or based on willful mischaracterizations, colleges must take them seriously and be clearer about what these efforts are (and are not), and about the public benefits and essential nature of this work. He reaffirmed, in strong terms, his personal commitment and that of Marist’s leadership to making the College an even more inclusive and welcoming community with a deep sense of belonging. He characterized these efforts as squarely within the institution’s long-held mission and values as originally espoused by the Marist Brothers, and in deep alignment with the College's strategic interests as outlined in Marist 100. He stated that we must \"bring Marist to the world and the world to Marist\" by attracting the most talented students, faculty, and staff from a variety of different geographies, backgrounds, and identities, and preparing them for a lifetime of success in a complex world. He noted that Marist had been meeting the disparate needs of a diverse population for decades, and without controversy, through a wide and individually tailored range of support mechanisms: academic, health, social, and financial, among others. Only in this manner would Marist deliver the most impactful learning experience to all its students, faculty, and staff as the College moves forward.\n\nThe Board's next meeting will take place in May on the Marist campus, and we look forward to updating members of the campus community on the major outcomes of that meeting. Our thanks again to those who contributed to the success of the February meetings and events.\n\nRoss A. Mauri '80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees\n\nKevin C. Weinman\n\nPresident\n\nDear members of the Marist College community,\n\nWe’re pleased to share with you this summary of the December 8-9, 2023, annual meeting of the Board of Trustees.\n\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 8: COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND EVENTS\n\nFollowing a series of Friday standing committee meetings, trustees dedicated time to a working session on strategic plan implementation. The Board discussed its responsibility to monitor progress toward the ambitious goals articulated in Marist 100 and reviewed plans to develop a dashboard with key performance indicators related to each of the strategic plan’s pillars. That evening members of the Board joined advisory board members, alumni, and other friends of the College on the final Poughkeepsie stop of the 100-day, seven-city, four-country world tour to introduce the plan to the Marist community.\n\nSATURDAY, DECEMBER 9: BOARD MEETING\n\nSaturday’s meetings began with a number of welcomes and farewells, including a breakfast celebration of Tim Brier ’69, who stepped down from the Board last February following 22 years of dedicated service as a trustee. The Board also enthusiastically welcomed the incoming 2023-2024 Faculty and Student Representatives to the Board of Trustees, Faculty Affairs Committee (FAC) Chair Nicholas Marshall and Student Government Association President Amanda DeFalco ’24.\n\nGovernance updates\n\nAs this was the Board’s annual meeting, members took up the question of trusteeship and nominations, voting unanimously to re-elect seven current trustees to additional three-year terms, and to elect four trustees to their first terms. The Board welcomes the following new members:\n\nRajesh K. Kothapalli ’92M\n\nThomas M. Murray ’02\n\nC. James Taylor III\n\nElizabeth K. Venuti, PhD P’15/’17\n\nThe Board also elected several new officers. Genine McCormick ’88/P’15 and Dirk McMahon ’82 were elected to initial three-year terms as Vice Chairs of the Board. Our sincere thanks to trustees Tim Tenney and Chris McCann ’83 for their service as Vice Chairs over the past five years, and for their continued service as members of the Board’s Executive Committee.\n\nBoard also reviewed and revised the bylaws, passing amendments to sections involving term limits and life trusteeship.\n\nAcademic updates\n\nTrustees considered and unanimously approved 13 semester- or year-long sabbaticals for the 2024-2025 academic year. Sincere thanks to those who served on the faculty Sabbaticals & Research Grants committee for their work in making these recommendations. Sabbaticals play an important role in the ability of our faculty to grow and develop as scholars and educators, and the Board therefore congratulates the following individuals and wishes them well with their planned research and creative activities:\n\nKate Chaterdon, Assistant Professor of English\n\nKatharine Dill, Associate Professor of Social Work and Field Education Coordinator\n\nRichard Feldman, Chair & Associate Professor of Environmental Science\n\nVictoria Ingalls, Professor of Biology\n\nByunghoon Jin, Associate Professor of Accounting\n\nEitel J. M. Lauría, Professor of Data Science & Information Systems\n\nJason Lee, Associate Professor of Operations Management\n\nGregory Machacek, Professor of English\n\nTracey McGrail, Associate Professor of Mathematics\n\nM. Marina Melita, Senior Lecturer of Italian\n\nVernon Murray, Assistant Professor of Marketing\n\nElizabeth Reid, Associate Professor of Mathematics\n\nFrancine Sage-King, Clinical Associate Professor Department of Physical Therapy\n\nOther standing committee updates\n\nThe Finance Committee reported on a meeting it conducted with the College’s investment manager, Cambridge Associates, and also received a report on the financial results for the year ended June 30, 2023. The College finished the fiscal year in a strong financial position despite headwinds stemming from broader economic conditions, including continued inflationary pressures, a tight labor market, and turbulent investment markets. Total assets grew to surpass $1 billion, driven by market returns on long-term investments, contributions to cash balances from operations, and investment in physical plant assets. Operating activities generated a nearly $14 million increase in net assets, which exceeded budget expectations. After adjustments to account for non-cash expenses (such as depreciation), purpose-restricted funds, debt service, and routine capital expenditures, this represented approximately $17 million of cash generated by operations, which exceeded budget by more than $15 million. Fitch Ratings upgraded the College’s debt rating to AA- with a stable outlook, while Moody’s affirmed the College’s rating at A2 with a stable outlook.\n\nThe Audit Committee reported that the College’s independent auditors at Grant Thornton had presented the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, and had issued an unqualified (“clean”) opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the College. We’re pleased to report that there were no material weaknesses, deficiencies, or audit adjustments found during this audit.\n\nThe Buildings and Grounds Committee reported on the progress of a number of projects, including the Dyson Center, which remains on time and on budget. Trustees also approved a fundraising campaign to support the construction of a state-of-the-art track and turf field facility on the North End of campus. Members expressed their gratitude to Tim Tenney for his $1 million lead commitment, established as a dollar-for-dollar matching challenge to encourage participation in the campaign.\n\nFinally, the Board received a President’s Report from Kevin Weinman on some of his recent on- and off-campus engagements to promote Marist; engage with alumni, students, parents, and friends; and introduce both the College and Marist 100 to new audiences. He shared his observations about the energy and enthusiasm on display at the six Admissions Open Houses Marist hosted this fall, and how this momentum had carried through early admissions applications, which were up significantly over last year.\n\nThe Board is planning to reconvene on the Marist campus February 2-3, and we will look forward to updating members of the campus community on the meeting’s major discussions and decisions. Our thanks again to those who contributed to the success of the December weekend’s meetings and events. Best wishes to all for a successful start to the spring 2024 semester.\n\nRoss A. Mauri ’80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees\n\nKevin C. Weinman\n\nPresident\n\nDear members of the Marist College community,\n\nWe’re pleased to share with you this summary of the May 5-6 Board of Trustees spring meeting.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 5 COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND EVENTS\n\nFollowing a series of Friday standing committee meetings, the Board continued its annual tradition of hosting a conversation between members of the Board’s Academic Affairs Committee and members of the faculty’s Academic Affairs Committee and Faculty Affairs Committee (FAC). Discussion topics included faculty retention and recruitment, as well as the balance between full- and part-time faculty. The discussion was lively and productive, and we thank members of faculty leadership for their candor, collegiality, and commitment to shared governance. Special thanks to FAC Chair Nicholas Marshall for his service as the 2022-2023 Faculty Representative to the Board of Trustees, a role he will continue next year.\n\nMembers of the Board continued their discussions with faculty over dinner and we were also pleased to re-present the Board of Trustees Faculty Award for Distinguished Teaching to the past three years’ recipients, as this was the first year we’ve resumed in-person Board dinners since 2019, due to COVID. Our congratulations again to Addrain Conyers (2020), Elisa Woolridge (2021), and Matt Glomski (2022) on being recognized by your peers for your outstanding teaching and many other contributions to the Marist community through your scholarship, service, and engagement in the life of the College.\n\nFollowing dinner, many Trustees attended the Silver Needle Runway at the McCann Arena. On behalf of the full Board, we offer our congratulations to the 35 talented senior Fashion Design students who displayed their work, the nine student directors who ran the show, and all the students, faculty, and staff who lent their time and talents to the event’s success.\n\nSATURDAY, MAY 6 BOARD MEETING\n\nSaturday’s full Board meeting began with several welcomes and farewells, including a breakfast celebration in honor of Jim Cannavino, who stepped down from the Board after 38 years of service. Trustees also expressed their sincere appreciation to Alumni Executive Board Chair Eileen Gilfedder Altobelli ’82, who will conclude her term as an ex officio Trustee in June. The Board acknowledged Student Government Association (SGA) President Gabriel Borbon ’23 for his excellent service as the 2022-2023 Student Representative to the Board of Trustees and welcomed incoming SGA President Amanda DeFalco ’24, who will participate in next year’s meetings. We also offered a warm welcome to Provost and Dean of Faculty Katie Gunther Kodat and recognized several upcoming retirements within the academic administration.\n\nStrategic planning update\n\nWe’re pleased to report that the Board has unanimously adopted Marist 100, an ambitious strategic plan that will guide the work of the College for the next seven years (2023-2030), carrying us up to and beyond the College’s centennial in 2029. Final revisions and enhancements will occur over the summer, along with planning for a major rollout timed to coincide with the start of the 2023-2024 academic year. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, let us express our sincere appreciation to the entire campus community for your yearlong engagement with this work, with particular thanks due to members of the Strategic Plan Steering Committee and various working groups, for their special contributions to the planning process.\n\nAcademic updates\n\nWe’re pleased to report that the Board reviewed and unanimously approved 11 faculty tenure and/or promotion cases. Please join us in thanking the many faculty members who played a part in the tenure and promotion review process (particularly those who served on peer-review committees or the Rank and Tenure Committee), and in congratulating the following faculty members on their accomplishments:\n\nJuan Arias – promotion to Senior Professional Lecturer of Computing Technology\n\nDan Amernick – promotion to Senior Professional Lecturer of Media Arts\n\nAnne Bertrand-Dewsnap – promotion to Senior Lecturer of Art\n\nRebecca Brown – promotion to Senior Professional Lecturer of Fashion Merchandising\n\nAlexander Henderson – tenure at the rank of Associate Professor of Public Administration\n\nQihao Ji – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Communication\n\nByunghoon Jin – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Accounting\n\nZion Klos – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Environmental Science\n\nThomas Madden – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Business Law\n\nElizabeth Reid – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Mathematics\n\nLeander Shaerlaeckens – promotion to Senior Professional Lecturer of Sports Communication\n\nActing upon the recommendation of its Academic Affairs Committee, the full Board unanimously approved the proposal for a new B.A. in Environmental Studies, which was also approved by the full faculty acting in plenary session. It also unanimously approved a proposal from the School of Management to create a standalone Department of Accounting. Congratulations to all those who contributed to the development and success of these proposals.\n\nHighlights from other standing committee reports\n\nThe Board received a report on fall 2023 admissions activities, including the number of applications, acceptances, and deposits received for the Class of 2027. The Admissions & Enrollment Committee reported that, despite the many challenges present in the higher education market, the College again expects to meet its budgeted goal for new student enrollment, with an exceedingly strong overall profile of the incoming class, including markers of academic quality and diversity.\n\nIn light of the challenging market conditions, the administration was pleased to present a balanced operating budget for fiscal year 2024, which was unanimously endorsed by the Finance Committee and subsequently approved by the full Board. Members of the administration are in the process of making final allocations and will communicate additional information about next year’s budget to the campus community in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Buildings and Grounds Committee reported that the Dyson Center project remains on time and on budget, with structural steel work substantially finished. Concrete slab work is currently underway and expected to be complete within a few weeks. Architectural precast panel installation will begin in June with roofing work to follow in July. The anticipated completion of this transformative project remains late spring 2024.\n\nThe College Advancement Committee reported on year-to-date fundraising efforts, a number of new gifts and pledges, as well as continued planning for the College’s next comprehensive campaign, which will be informed, and tightly connected to, the compelling ideas and needs surfaced during the strategic planning process.\n\nThe DEI Committee reported on a DEI communications plan currently being developed by the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, as well as plans for additional learning and development to be undertaken by both the President’s Cabinet and Trustees.\n\nPresident’s Report\n\nFinally, the Board received a President’s Report from Kevin Weinman, in which he expressed his enthusiasm for the strategic plan, noting that it would position Marist to compete and succeed in its existing markets and expand into new ones. He relayed his sincere thanks to members of the Board of Trustees and all those who worked to shape the plan, particularly James Snyder and Emily Saland, who co-chaired the Steering Committee, and Katie Kodat, who dedicated time to the process prior to her formal arrival. He also updated the Board on recent travel to raise Marist’s profile, connect with alumni and parents, and participate with other colleges and universities in important collaborations such as the American Talent Initiative.\n\nThe Board is planning to reconvene on the Marist campus in September for a retreat and then again in November for its annual meeting. We will look forward to updating members of the campus community on the major outcomes of that meeting. Our thanks again to those who contributed to the success of last weekend’s meetings and events. Best wishes to all for a successful conclusion of the spring 2023 semester – we look forward to seeing many of you at next weekend’s Commencement exercises.\n\nRoss A. Mauri ’80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees\n\nKevin C. Weinman\n\nPresident\n\nDear members of the Marist College community,\n\nWe are pleased to share with you this summary of the February 3-4 Marist College Board of Trustees winter meeting.\n\nSTRATEGIC PLANNING:\n\nOn Friday, Trustees gathered for a five-hour strategic planning session. This session built on two previous half-day retreats facilitated by Professor of Public Administration James Melitski (in September) and Professor of Strategy Helen Rothberg (in November). In this session, Strategic Plan Steering Committee co-chairs Emily Saland and James Snyder provided an update on the identification of six themes that had emerged from a robust community engagement process, and Trustees heard presentations from the co-chairs leading each of the six associated working groups, on their preliminary assessments and recommendations.

Trustees also received an informational update on the work undertaken by Marist’s Fashion Faculty, along with their counterparts at Lorenzo de’ Medici Institute, to make a BS in Fashion Merchandising available at Marist’s branch campus in Florence, Italy. Congratulations to those who contributed to the development of these exciting programs.\n\nThe Board also considered and unanimously approved eight faculty promotions. Please join us in thanking those who served on peer-review committees or the Rank & Tenure Committee for the role they played in the promotion process, and in congratulating the following faculty members on their accomplishments:\n\nEileen Curley, Professor of English\n\nLynn Eckert, Professor of Professor of Political Science\n\nJulie Fineman, Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy\n\nBrian Gormanly, Senior Professional Lecturer of Computing Technology\n\nAlan Labouseur, Professor of Computer Science\n\nFrancine Sage-King, Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy\n\nBrigid Shanley, Senior Professional Lecturer of Medical Technology\n\nMarilyn Zeppetelli, Senior Professional Lecturer of Computing Technology\n\nTrustees considered and unanimously approved 11 semester- or year-long sabbaticals for the 2023-2024 academic year.

The anticipated completion of this transformative project remains late spring 2024.\n\nThe Board received a report from the Admissions & Enrollment Committee on fall 2023 undergraduate admissions, including the Early Action and Early Decision pools, which were roughly consistent with last year’s. The committee also reported on the Regular Decision pool, ongoing application review, and yield activities planned for the Class of 2027.\n\nThe College Advancement Committee reported on continued planning for the College’s next comprehensive campaign and its relationship to the College-wide strategic planning process.

The Committee also received an SGA report from Gabriel Borbon '23 about his administration’s priorities for the spring semester.\n\nPRESIDENT’S REPORT:\n\nFinally, the Board received a President’s Report from Kevin Weinman on some of his recent on- and off-campus engagements to celebrate the College; engage with alumni, students, and parents; and bring Marist stories to new audiences. He joined the men’s and women’s basketball teams in London and Dublin; spent two days visiting the Freshman Dublin Experience students, faculty, and staff, including tours of classrooms and the residence hall; and attended events on Long Island for alumni and friends as well as prospective students. President Weinman also reported on his participation in the American Talent Initiative (ATI)’s new president’s cohort. ATI, which Marist first joined in 2017, is a consortium seeking to expand access and opportunity for talented, low- and moderate-income students at institutions with high graduation rates.\n\nPresident Weinman also previewed some upcoming engagements, including a trip to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities annual conference to introduce Lee Miringoff’s plenary session on the mid-term elections, several alumni and friends events in North Carolina, and the Florence branch campus’s May Commencement.

Our thanks again to those who contributed to the success of last weekend’s meetings and events.\n\nRoss A. Mauri '80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees\n\nKevin C. Weinman\n\nPresident\n\nDear members of the Marist College community,\n\nThis past weekend (November 4-5) the Marist College Board of Trustees held its annual fall meeting. Consistent with our commitment to keeping faculty, students, staff, and alumni informed about key issues brought before the Board for discussion and decision, below please find a summary of the meeting’s outcomes.\n\nTrustees dedicated five hours on Friday to a strategic planning session, facilitated by Professor of Strategy Helen Rothberg. This session built on a previous half-day strategic visioning session conducted on September 24 and facilitated by Professor of Public Administration James Melitski. The Board also received an update from Strategic Plan Steering Committee (SPSC) co-chairs Emily Saland and James Snyder on stakeholder engagement efforts taking place across campus, as well as the process and timeline that would allow the committee to present the Board with a draft plan for consideration and adoption in May of 2023. We extend our sincere appreciation to Helen Rothberg and James Melitski for their partnership in designing and facilitating these discussions, and our thanks to the members of the SPSC for their continued dedication to this important process.\n\nSaturday’s full Board meeting began with several welcomes and farewells, including a moment of silence for Trustee and Marist Scholar in Residence Bro. Seán Sammon, FMS ’70, who passed away in September. The Board also enthusiastically welcomed the incoming 2022-2023 Faculty and Student Representatives to the Board of Trustees, Faculty Affairs Committee (FAC) Chair Nicholas Marshall and Student Government Association President Gabriel Borbon ’23.\n\nWe’re pleased to report that, on the recommendation of the Board’s Academic Affairs Committee, the full Board reviewed and unanimously approved the creation of the new Priorities and Resources Committee, adopting the same Faculty Handbook revisions recently approved by the faculty at the November 2, 2022 Plenary. President Weinman thanked Nicholas Marshall and members of the FAC for their commitment to shared governance, and their partnership in designing a committee that would provide faculty with a meaningful voice in the identification and shaping of institutional budget priorities.\n\nThe Board also considered and unanimously approved Professor Emeritus/a status for three members of the Marist faculty, in recognition of their many years of service and contributions to the intellectual and cultural life of the College. They are:\n\nJames M. Johnson – Professor Emeritus of History\n\nRichard Lewis – Professor Emeritus of Art\n\nDonise English – Professor Emerita of Art\n\nTrustees received an update on the Middle States reaccreditation process, including a summary of the October 25 site visit made by evaluation team chair President Kathy Harring of Muhlenberg College. President Harring met with various constituencies during this visit, including eight Trustees: Eileen Gilfedder Altobelli ’82, Susan Cohen, Donna Dillenberger, Steve Effron, Stan Harris ’68, Bro. John Klein ’70 FMS, Alvin Patrick ’86, and Robert Shanahan ’83. Members of the Board also received a report on the planned finalization of the self-study report in late January/early February, and the four-day visit by the full evaluation team, scheduled for March 19-22, 2023.\n\nThe Finance Committee reported on a meeting it conducted with the College’s investment manager, Cambridge Associates. Fiscal year 2022 was challenging for public market investments, and the return on the investment pool at June 30, 2022 was -9.3%, a $38.4 million decrease from the prior year’s ending balance.\n\nThe Board also received a report on the financial results for the year ended June 30, 2022. The College’s total assets stood at $998.8 million, although the return on net assets was -3.2%, driven down primarily by investment market performance. Long-term debt increased $51 million, due to the issuance of bonds to finance the Dyson Center project. Operating activities generated a 9.3% margin, or $21 million, which exceeded budget expectations. The outperformance to budget was unusually high in 2022 as the College emerged from the crisis stage of the COVID pandemic. Marist budgeted conservatively for enrollment given continued uncertainties in the market, but was able to exceed budget targets both for new and returning students. Also, the College had planned for a faster pace to fill vacant positions, but labor market challenges slowed new hiring activity relative to expectations, resulting in unplanned expense savings. It is also important to note that the surplus includes $4.6 million of federal institutional support from the Higher Education Emergency Relief (HEERF) program, which does not have an offsetting expense in fiscal year 2022, and which will not be available in future years. HEERF funds reimburse the College for COVID-related expenses in spring 2020 and the 2020-2021 fiscal year.\n\nTrustees then received an update on the current year’s operating projection compared to budget. The operating surplus is projected to be $7.8 million, a 3.3% margin, which exceeds budget targets due to higher freshman and transfer enrollment, as well as persistent position vacancies despite renewed hiring activity.\n\nThe Audit Committee reported that the College’s independent auditors at Grant Thornton had presented the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022 and would issue an unmodified (“clean”) opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the College. We’re pleased to report that there were no material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, or audit adjustments found during this audit.\n\nFinally, the Governance Committee brought a number of items before the Board in closed session. We’re pleased to report that the full Board voted unanimously to make the ad hoc D&I Committee a standing committee of the Board, now renamed the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee.\n\nThe Board also adopted standing committee assignments for the coming year. Six of the Board’s 11 committees have new chairs:\n\nAcademic Affairs – Maureen O’Rourke ’85, Associate Provost for Academic Affairs, Boston University\n\nAdmission & Enrollment – Alvin Patrick ’86, Executive Producer, CBS News\n\nFinance – Robert Shanahan ’83, former President and CEO, Lightower Fiber Networks\n\nGovernance – Jerome Pickett ’98, Founder & CEO, Synth Advisory Services LLC\n\nStudent Life – Steve Effron, President and CEO, EFCO Products, Inc.\n\nTechnology – Chris McCann ’83, President, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM\n\nCommittees with continuing chairs include:\n\nAudit – Genine McCormick ’88/P’16, Certified Public Accountant\n\nBuildings & Grounds – Gregory Gartland, Partner, Winston & Strawn LLP\n\nCollege Advancement – Patrick Lavelle ’73/P’02, President and CEO, Voxx International Corporation\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion – Stan Harris ’68, Senior Medical Director (ret.), Horizon Blue Cross/Blue Shield of NJ\n\nExecutive – Ross Mauri ’80/P’15, General Manager, IBM Z\n\nThe Board welcomed incoming committee chairs, and also thanked outgoing chairs for their service. Trustees also acknowledged Suresh Kothapalli ’91M as he concluded his term of service on the Board, and acted on the reappointment of several other members whose terms were up for renewal.\n\nThe Board’s annual meeting will take place in February on the Marist campus, and we look forward to updating members of the campus community on the major outcomes of that meeting. Our thanks again to those who contributed to the success of last weekend’s meetings and events, and best wishes to all for a successful conclusion to the fall 2022 term.\n\nRoss A. Mauri ’80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees\n\nKevin C. Weinman\n\nPresident\n\nDear members of the Marist College community,\n\nThis past weekend (May 6-7) the Marist College Board of Trustees held its spring meeting, which, for the first time in more than two years, included a full set of campus-based events. In keeping with our commitment to inform the campus community about the work of the Board, below is a summary of some of the weekend’s activities and key outcomes.\n\nParticularly gratifying to Trustees was the opportunity to re-engage in meaningful discussions with faculty, students, and staff, and to experience the intellectual and cultural vibrancy of the Marist College campus. Following a series of Friday standing committee meetings, the Board continued its annual tradition of hosting a discussion between members of the Board’s Academic Affairs Committee and members of the faculty’s Academic Affairs and Faculty Affairs Committees. Discussion topics included opportunities and barriers related to academic excellence, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion. The conversation was both honest and robust; Trustees found the discussion to be enjoyable and productive, and we thank members of faculty leadership for their candor and commitment to shared governance.\n\nMembers of the Board continued their discussions with faculty over dinner, and many attended the Silver Needle Runway Show at the McCann Arena. On behalf of the full Board, we offer our congratulations to the talented senior Fashion Design students whose work was displayed, and to all those students, faculty, and staff who contributed their expertise and creativity to the event’s production.\n\nSaturday’s full Board meeting began with several welcomes and farewells, including a moment of silence in honor of the Board’s Immediate Past Chair, Ellen Hancock. Trustees also expressed their sincere appreciation to Faculty Affairs Committee (FAC) Chair Julie Raines and Student Government Association (SGA) President Tenzin Tsundu ’22, for their extraordinary service as the 2021-2022 Faculty and Student Representatives to the Board of Trustees. We welcome incoming FAC Chair Nick Marshall and SGA President Gabriel Borbon ’23 as the Board’s 2022-2023 Faculty and Student Representatives, respectively, and look forward to their active participation in the coming year’s meetings.\n\nWe’re pleased to report that the Board reviewed and unanimously approved eight tenure and/or promotion cases. Please join us in thanking the many faculty members who played a part in the tenure and promotion review process (particularly those who served on peer-review committees or the Rank and Tenure Committee), and in congratulating the following faculty members on their accomplishments:\n\nKuangnen (Hans) Cheng – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Operations & Management Sciences\n\nMegan Dennis – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Biology\n\nKatharine Dill – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Social Work\n\nMarina Melita – promotion to Senior Lecturer of Italian\n\nKathleen McNulty – promotion to Senior Professional Lecturer of Communication\n\nDuy Nguyen – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Mathematics\n\nJennifer Robinette – promotion to Senior Lecturer of Communication\n\nPhilip Skepanski – tenure and promotion to Associate Professor of Media Arts\n\nTrustees also reviewed a number of academic programs. Acting upon the recommendation of its Academic Affairs Committee, the full Board unanimously approved the following proposals, all of which were also approved by the full faculty acting in plenary session: a new Master of Social Work degree, a new Master of Science in Athletic Training degree, a new BS in Biology/MS in Athletic Training dual-degree program, and new minor in Social Justice. Congratulations to all those who contributed to the development and success of these program proposals.\n\nThe Board received a report on fall 2022 admissions activities, including the number of applications, acceptances, and deposits received for the Class of 2026. The Admissions & Enrollment committee reported that, despite the many challenges present in the higher education market and intense competition for prospective students, the College expects to meet its budgeted goal for new student enrollment, with the overall profile of the incoming freshman class – including markers of academic quality and diversity – exceeding that of last year’s. In light of the challenging market conditions, the administration was pleased to present a balanced operating budget for fiscal year 2023, which the Board unanimously approved. Members of the administration are in the process of making final allocations, and will communicate additional information about next year’s budget to the campus community within the next few weeks.\n\nThe Board’s Audit Committee reported on their review and acceptance of the 990 and 990T forms, as well as their review of the audit plan and scope for the coming year. The Technology Committee invited Emily Harris, Director of Cybersecurity, to present the findings of a cybersecurity assessment and roadmap, undertaken in partnership with IBM.\n\nTrustees also received an update on the status of the Dyson Center expansion and enhancement, including the finalization of the building’s design documents, the successful execution of the $60 million bond issuance that was authorized by the Board at its February meeting, and the plan to begin the project in June. In order to commence construction on the new building, the Dyson Center’s current occupants and activities will relocate to other areas on campus until the building is complete in Spring 2024.\n\nTrustees and other meeting participants also received a President’s Report from Kevin Weinman. Among the items covered in that report was an update on the many year-end events and activities that make the culmination of the year so exciting for students, faculty, and staff, including Honors thesis presentations, business plan presentations, poetry slams, music and theater performances, and the return of Mon Afrique after a several-year absence. Kevin also shared observations from the week he spent engaged with the College’s branch campus in Florence, Italy, and described his intent to participate in their upcoming commencement ceremony. He also provided an update on the structures being put in place to support the $250,000 pledge that he and his wife Beth made in support of access and equity-related initiatives at the College. Finally, Kevin discussed early efforts related to the planning of a September 23, 2022 presidential inauguration, with additional information to follow. The next day, the Board will remain in Poughkeepsie to engage in a strategic visioning exercise as part of the recently-announced strategic plan.\n\nThe Board’s annual meeting will take place in November on the Marist campus, and we look forward to updating members of the campus community on the major outcomes of that meeting. Our thanks again to those who contributed to the success of last weekend’s meetings and events. Congratulations to all on the upcoming conclusion of the spring 2022 semester – we look forward to seeing many of you at the Commencement exercises for the Classes of 2020 and 2022.\n\nRoss A. Mauri ’80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees\n\nKevin C. Weinman\n\nPresident\n\nDear members of the Marist College community,\n\nThis past weekend (February 4-5) the Marist College Board of Trustees held its winter meeting. While Friday’s sessions had to be conducted via Zoom because of the inclement weather, on Saturday the Board convened in person for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The Board would like to express its gratitude to Faculty Affairs Committee Chair Julie Raines, Student Government Association (SGA) President Tenzin Tsundu ’22, and members of the administration for their participation in the meeting and commitment to shared governance. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance communication and transparency around institutional decision-making and the work of the Board, we would like to share some of the meeting’s outcomes with you.\n\nWe’re pleased to report that the Board voted unanimously to authorize the long-anticipated Dyson Center expansion and enhancement as well as the associated funding plan. Construction on this transformational project, which you can read about in greater detail here, is set to begin at the conclusion of the spring 2022 term, with an anticipated completion in early 2024. The building will partially be funded by a gift from the Dyson Foundation with the remainder to come from a $60 million bond issuance, which the administration will execute in the coming months.\n\nTrustees unanimously approved the promotion of two full-time faculty members, both of whom had the support of their peer-review committees, deans, the Rank and Tenure Committee, the Vice President for Academic Affairs, and the President. Dr. Carolyn Matheus was promoted to Professor of Information Systems and Dr. Carol Rinke was promoted to Professor of Education. We extend our congratulations to Professors Matheus and Rinke, and our thanks to the many faculty members who played a part in the promotion review process, including those who serve on peer-review committees and on the Rank and Tenure Committee.\n\nThe Board unanimously approved 11 semester- or year-long sabbatical requests for the 2022-2023 academic year. Acknowledging that sabbaticals are an important opportunity for members of the Marist community to grow as scholars and educators, the Board congratulates the following faculty members and wishes them well in their academic pursuits: Andrei Buckareff, Lynn Eckert, Jen Eden, Matt Frieburghaus, David Gavin, Joanne Gavin, Leigh (Lea) Graham, Frank Merenda, Mary Stone, David Woolner, and Bowu Zhang.\n\nThe Board received a report on fall 2022 undergraduate admissions, including the number of applications, number of acceptances, and yield activities planned for the Class of 2026. The Admissions & Enrollment committee reported that the College had completed its early decision and early action acceptances, as well as some regular decision acceptances, and that the Office of Student Financial Services was working to package financial aid awards. While the number of applications for admission to next year’s freshman class is down slightly from the number received at this same point last year, the current pool of accepted students is stronger academically and more diverse (in terms of race/ethnicity and geography).\n\nThe Board’s Student Life Committee heard from Crystal Purfield, Director of Marist’s Liberty Partnerships Program (LPP), about the program’s mission of serving at-risk youth from grades 5-12 with drop-out prevention, college preparation, and vocational readiness programs. LPP currently serves 341 students in the Poughkeepsie City School District. Mario Johnson ’91M, Director of Marist’s Upward Bound (UB) program, discussed the program’s mission of providing college preparation to low-income, first-generation, homeless, and foster care high school students. UB currently serves 100 students at Poughkeepsie High School and 47 students at Newburgh Free Academy. Trustees also heard a report from Tenzin Tsundu ’22 on recent SGA activities, including support for Black History Month programming and mental health awareness events.\n\nTrustees also participated in a listening session for the College’s Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (VP DEI) search. This session was co-facilitated by Addrain Conyers, Director of Academic Diversity & Inclusion and chair of the search committee, and Kim Brettschneider of executive search firm WittKeiffer. Similar to other sessions held with faculty, staff, and students, trustees were solicited for their feedback on the qualities, characteristics, and experiences that Marist should seek in the VP DEI and their observations about the challenges and opportunities associated with this inaugural role. The outcomes of all campus listening sessions will inform the recruitment and hiring strategy for this critically important Cabinet-level position.\n\nTrustees and other meeting participants also received a President’s Report from Kevin Weinman. Among the items covered in that report was an update on the spring semester, including the health and safety protocols that allowed for an in-person and on-time opening. Kevin also described his motivations for the $250,000 pledge that he and his wife Beth recently made in support of access and equity-related initiatives at the College. He expressed his hope that both the Weinman pledge and the recently announced Mauri family gift pledge would help to inspire others, and to enhance the culture of philanthropy already in place at the institution. Kevin also discussed his plans to launch a broadly inclusive strategic planning process in the coming months that will establish a vision and key priorities for the future leading up to the College’s centennial celebration in 2029.\n\nThe Board’s next meeting will take place on the Marist campus May 6-7, 2022. Barring any pandemic-related issues, trustees will look forward to additional opportunities to engage with members of the Marist College community during those meetings and events. Our thanks again to those who participated in last weekend’s meeting, and all those whose efforts contribute to the ongoing success of the College.\n\nRoss A. Mauri ’80\n\nChair of the Board of Trustees"
