        "text": "DENVER, Colo. – Quinnipiac baseball catcher Colton Bender (Lebanon, Connecticut) was drafted in the 10th Round with the 310th pick of the 2021 MLB Draft by the San Diego Padres, as announced Monday night.\n\nWith his 10th round selection to the Padres, Bender becomes the highest draft pick for the Bobcats since the 2005 MLB Draft when Bryan Sabatella '05 was selected in the ninth round by the Seattle Mariners. Bender is the third highest draft pick in program history.\n\n\"I am so excited for Colton on getting a chance to live out his dream,\" head coach John Delaney said. \"He worked constantly for this program over his four years and developed into a true professional. He deserves this opportunity and I can't wait to see what is in store for him.\"\n\nBender is the fifth Quinnipiac player to be drafted since John Delaney took over as the head coach of the Quinnipiac baseball program. He joins Matthew Batten '17 in the San Diego Padres organization after Bender was drafted in the 32nd Round of the 2017 MLB Draft.\n\nIn addition to Bender and Batten in 2017, Quinnipiac also has seen Thomas Jankins go to the Milwaukee Brewers in the 13th Round of the 2016 MLB Draft, Robbie Hitt to the Milwaukee Brewers in the 24th Round of the 2017 MLB Draft and Tyler Poulin to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 29th Round of the 2019 MLB Draft.\n\nBender batted .266 for the Bobcats in the 2021. He led the Bobcats with seven doubles as a senior, finished second on the team with 25 hits and third with 19 RBIs. He posted a .349 on base percentage after drawing 11 walks.\n\nIn his four seasons as a member of the Bobcats, Bender recorded a .295 batting average with a .350 on base percentage. He had 132 hits in 447 at bats over 126 games. Bender had 24 doubles and seven home runs along with 70 RBIs.\n\nBender was a 2019 All-MAAC Second Team Selection and was a three-time MAAC All-Academic Team selection.\n\nQUINNIPIAC BASEBALL ALL-TIME DRAFT SELECTIONS\n\nYear Name Position Team Round Overall 2021 Colton Bender C San Diego Padres 10 310 2019 Tyler Poulin RHP Arizona Diamondbacks 29 872 2017 Matthew Batten SS San Diego Padres 32 948 2017 Robbie Hitt RHP Milwaukee Brewers 24 714 2016 Thomas Jankins RHP Milwaukee Brewers 13 381 2009 Chris Gloor LHP San Francisco Giants 17 507 2008 John Delaney INF Milwaukee Brewers 25 758 2008 Chris Gloor LHP Detroit Tigers 39 1183 2007 Randy Gress SS Atlanta Braves 18 558 2006 Pat Egan RHP Baltimore Orioles 36 1075 2005 Bryan Sabatella 3B Seattle Mariners 9 263 2005 Ari Kafka RHP Seattle Mariners 26 773 2005 Pat Egan RHP Baltimore Orioles 35 1053 1998 Jeff Carlson RHP New York Yankees 46 1368 1993 Steve Kulpa SS Chicago Cubs 55 1477 1988 Turk Wendell RHP Atlanta Braves 5 112 1988 Doug Bond 1B Cincinnati Reds 22 566 1988 Dominick Rovasio RHP Minnesota Twins 32 831 1988 Brian Landy LHP Cincinnati Reds 42 1082 1984 Francesco Trasacco LHP Cincinnati Reds 14 345 1983 Bob Bruzik SS Seattle Mariners 15 373 1979 Gregory Burtt * OF Baltimore Orioles 5 122 1979 William Martin RHP Seattle Mariners 28 690 1974 Ralph Russo * 1B Boston Red Sox 2 42 1968 Dan Ford RHP St. Louis Cardinals 35 76\n\n* Selected in the January Draft"
