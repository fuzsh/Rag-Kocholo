He’s been with that organization since 2007, helping develop 90 boys and girls players to become collegiate players, including 26 at the NCAA Division I level. He also trained and directed 12 coaches per season – a total of 48 coaches in a 14-year span.\n\nOne of his players was his son Rylan Bergersen, who is now at Eastern after previously playing at BYU and Central Arkansas. A 6-6 guard who played at Borah High School in Boise, he was twice honored as a third team All-Southland Conference selection. Rylan’s former high school teammate is current Eastern point guard Ellis Magnuson, who also played for Hoop Dreams.\n\nRoberto also spent the 2017-18 season as head coach of Kanakuk Link Year, a prep school in Branson, Mo. The Lions finished the season as national champions in its classification, and produced 12 scholarship athletes. One of his players was Angelo Allegri, who now plays at Eastern after playing at UNC Greensboro.\n\nRoberto was a standout at Boise State University and was a second round NBA draft pick (52nd overall) in 1999 by the Atlanta Hawks. He played much of his 11-year professional career in the Continental Basketball Association/NBA D-League for the Idaho Stampede based in Boise. Playing in a total of seven countries, he also played professionally overseas in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain and Turkey.\n\nIn 2004, Bergersen was a CBA All-Star and the All-Star Game MVP, and in 2008 helped lead his team to the NBA D-League championship. In addition, he was MVP of the CBA’s rookie game in 2000 and in 2006 was an all-star in the Turkish Basketball League.\n\nRoberto starred at Decatur High School in Federal Way, Wash., then accepted a scholarship from Washington and its new coach Bob Bender. He started for half a season, but then attended Highline Junior College in the Seattle area where he earned his associate’s degree before ending up at BSU.\n\nAs a senior All-American, he averaged 20 points a game for the Broncos and was named 1999 Big West Conference Player of the Year. He was first team All-West in both 1998 and 1999, earned All-District honors in 1999 and was a national finalist for the Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award.\n\nHe earned his bachelor’s degree at Boise State in social science in 1999. He was inducted into the BSU Hall of Fame in 2007, and the Idaho Stampede retired his No. 11 jersey in 2014.\n\nRoberto was born Jan. 6, 1976. His father, Jack Bergersen was a legendary 6-8 player at Roosevelt High School in Seattle, and then played at Washington State. He passed away in February of 2020 at the age of 71, and named Roberto after his favorite baseball player, Roberto Clemente.\n\nBesides Rylan, Roberto also has two other sons -- Ryzin \"Biggie\" Bergersen now plays at Northwest Nazarene in Nampa, Idaho. Another son, Rayzhon \"Ray Ray\" Bergersen, played as a junior at Borah High School in the 2020-21 season.\n\nHis wife, Rhonda Bergersen, was a college soccer player at the University of Washington where they met in the 1990’s when Roberto began his collegiate career at UW."
