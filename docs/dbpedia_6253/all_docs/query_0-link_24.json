        "text": "RECAP | BOX SCORE\n\nSEATTLE (AP) -- Loren Woods beat the Washington Huskies with his reputation and his talent.\n\nLooking like the best player in the Pacific-10 Conference, the 7-foot-1 center blocked five shots in the first half as the No. 7 Arizona Wildcats grabbed a 16-1 lead. He finished with career highs of 29 points and 13 rebounds in a 65-56 victory. Woods' big game Thursday night came a week after he tied an NCAA record with 14 blocked shots against visiting Oregon. The undersized Huskies didn't have an answer for the junior transfer from Wake Forest, who finished with six blocked shots for a total of 97 in 24 games this season. They admitted he terrorized them in the first half, when they missed their first 10 shots and committed nine turnovers in the first nine minutes. They were afraid to attack the basket with Woods underneath. \"Who doesn't know about Loren Woods?\" asked Deon Luton, who led the Huskies with 19 points. \"But that's no excuse for us not to be aggressive, including myself.\" In the first half, Washington didn't get a basket before David Dixon's dunk with 9:15 gone. The Wildcats were up by 20 points twice and led 34-17 at the half. Arizona (9-1, 20-4) lost its intensity in the second half. Michael Johnson's 12-footer with 4:50 to go cut the Wildcats' lead to 56-51. That's when Woods reappeared, scoring seven points down the stretch, including a three-point play with 1:40 to go to put Arizona on top 65-53. While Arizona remained tied for the Pac-10 lead with No. 2 Stanford, which beat Oregon 76-61 on Thursday night, the Huskies (3-7, 8-14) watched their season grow even more dismal. \"You can't dig yourself out of that kind of hole against Arizona,\" Washington coach Bob Bender said. Woods was proud of being at his best when it counted. \"I knew somebody would step up,\" he said. \"It happened to be me.\" Said Wildcats coach Lute Olson: \"Loren was the guy at the end who put the team on his back and carried us.\" Gilbert Arenas had 14 points and Wright 12 for Arizona, which beat Washington for the second time this season. If Arizona has any shortcomings, it's lack of depth. On Thursday night, it was their lack of second-half intensity and freshman point guard Jason Gardner's 1-for-10 shooting. \"I told them at halftime that they needed to play like they were 10 points down,\" Olson said. \"I've found out that you can tell juniors and seniors that and expect them to put the game away. Freshmen don't seem to have the same attitude.\" \"We didn't have the same focus as we did in the first half,\" Woods said.\n\nALSO SEE\n\nMens College Basketball Scoreboard\n\nArizona Clubhouse\n\nWashington Clubhouse"
