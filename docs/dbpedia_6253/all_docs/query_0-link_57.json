His goal is to develop every player to their fullest potential on the field, in the classroom, and in the community as leaders. He has a 12-month comprehensive football program, where players are able to develop every aspect of the student-athlete. The last five years, Peeples has worked at Frederick High School as their Head Football Coach and Weight Training Teacher. Under his leadership, the varsity team had a 35-16 record. They were 2019 CHSAA semifinaliasts, 2021 CHSAA quarterfinalists, 2021 Conference Champions, and Channel 9 Game of the Week four times. He was named Conference Coach of the year and Denver Broncos Coach of the Week. In his five years at FHS, 18 players signed with colleges for football (Juco to D1).\n\nCoach Peeples started his coaching career at Miami Killian and spent 12 years at Pine Ridge High in central Florida. He spent time at Greeley West and Cheyenne South, helping to lead both programs to CHSAA Playoffs. He was the head coach at Aurora Central (8-3) and led the program to their first playoff appearance in 25 years.\n\nPeeples was born and raised in Miami, Florida. In 1989, he graduated from Miami Columbus HS, where he was the varsity quarterback earning All-City recognition, and his team was Conference Champions. He played in the early 1990s at University of Central Florida on a full scholarship. He was a member of the 1990 semifinalist team and a UCF letterman.

We know that Coach Peeples will be an integral part of building great things at Wellington Middle High School!\n\nHead Boy's & Girl's Soccer Coach: Julio Martinez\n\n\"My coaching career was ignited in 2018. I started off coaching rec sports like basketball to football, starting from grades 4th to 12th grade seniors. For the past two seasons now I have made the transition to a passion sport of mine, the wonderful world of soccer. I come from a Head JV coach/Varsity assistant coach from Northridge High School out of Greeley. Where I managed to end last season with an undefeated record and the title of Coach of the Year voted by my peers. I also was part of the coaching organization which took the Varsity squad to the State qualifying competition.\n\nI played soccer in all of my four years of school at Greeley West High School. My team was unfortunate to reach state contention during that time but have always cherished the memories. Soccer has always taught me about discipline, dedication and the drive to push myself to be better, not only out on the field but in life. My goal is to instill these principles into student-athletes.\n\nI am a born and raised native here from Northern Colorado. I have lived most of my adult life in Fort Collins with my wife Amelia and our three children Aiden, Sophia and Noah but just last year we made the move to Wellington. Our plan is to make this place our home. I am excited to meet with the faculty and team of the school. Eager and ecstatic to start building this program from the ground up.

This past season I was the Girls Varsity Assistant and have been coaching at Fort Collins High School for the past 5 years.\n\nMy goal is to create a competitive program at the new Wellington Middle-High School that is built on character, work ethic and love for the game of basketball. I'm really looking forward to building new Eagle traditions!\n\nOutside of coaching basketball, I'm a mother of three and I live in Severance. My husband is a teacher and unified soccer coach in PSD.

She has learned a lot along the way and will continue to grow as long as possible.\n\nHead Boy's Golf Coach: Brian Fox & Varsity Football Assistant Coach\n\nI am thrilled to be named Head Coach for this upcoming golf season.

I was born in Northern California but moved to Red Feather Lakes, Colorado when I was 10 years old and have been part of the PSD community basically ever since. When I was in 9th grade I became the target of bullying and in defending myself was given the choice of wrestling or detention, I chose wrestling not knowing that it would forever change my life. I wrestled at Poudre High School where I became district champion and won 3rd in state. After high school, I went on to wrestle at the University of Southern Colorado (CSU Pueblo) where I was selected outstanding male athlete of the year, RMAC champion and earned an All American title in wrestling. Following college I returned to the Fort Collins area where I raised my 3 daughters, taught at Lopez Elementary School for 30 years and coached both as an assistant and head coach at Poudre High School.\n\nI am passionate about wrestling for many reasons, not only the athleticism and discipline it teaches but also for the strong character it develops in young people. In my time here at WMHS I am looking forward to helping build the individual as a whole by teaching lessons of fortitude, determination, grit and integrity both on and off the mat.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy fishing, camping, traveling and spending time with my kids (all former Wellington Eagles!) and grandkids.\n\nHead Track & Field Coach: Nick Wilkins\n\nI am eagerly stepping into the role of Head Coach for the Wellington High School Track and Field team.

I graduated from UND with a degree in Physical Education, Exercise Science, and Wellness.\n\nThroughout my coaching career I have coached a wide variety of events, as well as served as the head coach of a program for several years. Since starting coaching in Colorado, I have supported several students to become state placers and state champions. My favorite aspect of coaching is watching athletes progress in ways they never thought possible. Our goal for this year is to grow our team, be competitive, and have as many athletes compete at State as possible. In order for our team to find this success, we’ll need to be good teammates and push one another through our mental and physical hurdles.\n\nBarb Andrews, Athletic Trainer\n\nBarb is a Certified Athletic Trainer and allied health care professional that specializes in the prevention, examination, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of emergent, acute or chronic injuries and medical conditions.\n\nBarb received her degree from Northern Illinois University and recently has been working in Northern Colorado as a concussion management specialist with Orthopedic & Spine Center of the Rockies.

And right out of high school I got the opportunity to coach at Poudre. I coached there for 2 years at the C and JV level. I am so excited to be apart of Wellington Middle High School coaching staff. Can't wait to be apart of a up and coming program!\n\nAndy Altschwager, Assistant Wrestling Coach\n\nBorn & raised in Wisconsin, Andy has since been a resident of Northern Colorado for the past 20 years.

In college I was a relief pitcher for four years with Colorado State University. During my time there we made appearances in four regional tournaments on the road to being two time Mid America Champions with two World Series appearances. In those four years, I was named an all conference reliever during my third year of play.\n\nI first started coaching while in college, my first experience being with little league as an assistant for a 14 and under team in 2012. From there I went on to coach fundamental baseball and softball skills with Colorado State University’s Youth Sport Camps (ages 5-13) in the summer of 2014. After graduating, I began pursuing my masters degree and while student teaching, I was a JV pitching coach for Windsor high school during the spring 2017 season. After coaching with Windsor I began teaching and coaching at Highland High School in Ault Colorado. During my three years with Highland I spent time each season as both a Varsity and JV assistant.\n\nCurrently I am coaching at the College level as a pitching coach for the Fort Collins Force Collegiate summer team. The program is geared towards helping players get more reps and reach their goals that they have for their current college, while also helping recent high school graduates get experience before entering the college baseball world or get on with a college somewhere.\n\nI am looking forward to working with the baseball program and teaching with Wellington this upcoming school year."
