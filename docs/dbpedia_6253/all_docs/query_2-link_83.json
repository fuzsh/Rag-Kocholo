        "text": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. — After months of video calls and group emails, Robert Druger and Robert Bender agreed to meet for the first time on Memorial Day and revisit the places that had caused so much parallel anguish, four decades ago.\n\nHere, Druger said, was the loading dock at the rear of a Syracuse University residence hall. This was where a charming graduate student who happened to be a former Olympic hurdler had sneaked high school athletes like Druger into his suite, only to groom and molest them later.\n\nThere, Bender pointed, behind the glass doors, was the elevator that he rode up to his room, the day he arrived on campus in 1980. This was where that same Olympian, upon learning Bender was a gymnast, had promised elite training, only to molest him later, as well.\n\nWhile both men were born in 1962, a mere 230 days apart, Bender had just turned 18 when the abuse started, and Druger was still 17. So under New York’s Child Victims Act, Druger has been able to sue Syracuse and other institutions, but Bender has not — even though they accused the same predator of abusing them in similar locations, starting at the same time.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
