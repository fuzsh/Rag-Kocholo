        "text": "Biography\n\nFor many years, Robert Bender taught accounting to students enrolled at various tertiary education institutions around Melbourne, Australia. He has also written textbooks on a variety of business subjects.\n\nRobert was adopted as a baby. His situation prompted him, in his 30s, to lead the adoptee-rights self-help and lobby group, Jigsaw Victoria, for a period of five years. His leadership culminated in a major revision of adoption law around Australia.\n\nRobert has been an active member of the Humanist Society of Victoria for over 30 years. He has served previously as Treasurer and currently fulfills the role of Auditor. Robert has also addressed the Atheist Society in Melbourne annually on a diverse range of topics and challenges himself intellectually with his Graduate studies in criminology and archaeology.\n\nFor over 30 years, Robert's main recreational interest has been in the natural world. His activities include conservation volunteering and bush land restoration at a national park. Robert's current work involves managing two bat-box monitoring projects at a Council-owned reserve, for which he delivers progress papers at the biennial bat conferences.\n\nHe is also currently surveying frogs, skinks and fungi, and partaking in a variety of Earthwatch field biology projects. Never one to rest, Robert acts as Treasurer for every group he joins. He is currently acting in this role for the Australasian Bat Society. For pleasure, Robert also loves to play Irish music on his descant recorder.\n\nPublications\n\nPhilosophy\n\nVashti McCollum's Fight for Churchâ€“State Separation in Schools\n\nBook Review: Blasphemy: A Memoir: Sentenced to Death Over a Cup of Water by Asia Bibi and Anne-Isabelle Tollet\n\nBook Review: Degrees of Liberation: A Short History of Women in the University of Melbourne by Farley Kelly\n\nBook Review: Women in Cambridge: A Men's University - Though of a Mixed Type by Rita McWilliams\n\nBook Review: Ether Day: the Strange Tale of America's Greatest Medical Discovery and the Haunted Men Who Made It by Julie M.
