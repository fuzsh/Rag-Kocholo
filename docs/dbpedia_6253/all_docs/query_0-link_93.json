        "text": "The Carroll boys’ basketball team continued its winning ways with two impressive wins last week.\n\nThe Frankfort Hot Dogs visited Carroll Memorial Gymnasium last Tuesday, and the matchup was a battle for 32 minutes. Carroll won each of the four quarters on the way to a 76-63 victory, breaking a string of nine straight losses in the series.\n\nFriday’s scheduled trip to Taylor was postponed to Saturday, and the Cougars came from behind in the fourth quarter to wrap up the Hoosier Heartland Conference (HHC) title with a 52-43 victory. This was Carroll’s second straight win over the Titans.\n\nCarroll’s season record improved to 18-1 with the two wins, and with one HHC game to play, the Cougars have a two-game lead over second-place Clinton Prairie in the conference standings. That translates to Conference Champs!\n\nLast season Carroll shared the HHC title with Eastern, but this year the Cougars are outright champions. This is the first time that Carroll has earned back-to-back conference titles since 1977-78 and 1978-79.\n\nVs. Frankfort\n\nThe class 3A Hot Dogs entered Tuesday’s game with a 7-9 record and an offense that relies on the three-point shot and the post moves of 6’6” sophomore Jayce Strode. Frankfort would present a challenge for the Cougars’ defense in many ways. In the game’s opening minutes, Chris Huerta and Jake Skinner traded baskets with Frankfort until the score was tied 9-9. The Cougars opened up a lead of 15-9, but longrange shooting and strong post play brought the Hot Dogs into a tie at 17-17.\n\nSkinner had a hot start with 14 points in the first quarter, scoring from behind the arc and at the rim. Frankfort made good on six of seven two-point shots in the opening period, and Strode had nine points to keep his team close. The first quarter ended with Carroll leading 22-19.\n\nCarroll head coach Bodie Bender commented about the start of the game, “Our offense was connecting on all cylinders. It was nice to see Jake back to his old form. I think his intensity on the defensive end allowed him to really get in a groove offensively.”\n\nFrankfort took its only lead of the game early in the second quarter at 23-22. Then scores by Skinner and Huerta, along with a basket and two 3-pointers by Owen Duff, put Carroll on top 34-26. The first half ended with the Cougars up 35-30.\n\nStrode had 11 points before halftime, and Frankfort senior guard Deacon Spencer had three baskets from distance. The Cougars’ defense on the pair would need to stay focused in the second half.\n\nCarroll’s third-quarter lead ranged between three and seven points for most of the period, as neither team could put together a scoring run. Then the Cougars used two free throws and a put-back by Duff and a basket-and-one by Skinner to boost the lead to 54-41. Griff Viney closed out the period with a basket to make the score 56-45 after three.\n\nCarroll’s defense was more effective on Strode and Spencer in the second half, but Frankfort senior Riley Goodnight was having success in the paint. Said Bender, “Chris was doing a good job causing Spencer problems by picking him up full-court, even frustrating him into a tech. But we had problems with Goodnight backing us down and scoring over the top of us.”\n\nFacing Frankfort’s many offensive weapons, an 11-point lead wasn’t safe with eight minutes to play. But when Carroll’s fourth-quarter lead was threatened, either Duff or Skinner stepped up.\n\nFrankfort scored the first four points of the period, but then Duff hit a three, a two, and one of two free throws to extend the lead to 13.\n\nWhen the Hot Dogs again closed within seven, Skinner scored twice. When Frankfort later closed the deficit to six, Skinner had a steal which led to one of two at the line. And the biggest play down the stretch was a Skinner block which he pushed up-court into a basket-and-one… Cougars back up by 10.\n\nThe 10-point lead grew to 16 with scores by Will Eldridge and Huerta, followed by two free throws from Viney. Frankfort hit a triple in the last few seconds to make the final score 76-63.\n\nSuccess usually comes to a team that limits turnovers and wins the rebounding battle. Carroll had only six turnovers for the game and out-rebounded Frankfort by 10.\n\nSkinner led the Cougars in scoring with a career-high 31 points, and Duff had 23. Both players had double-doubles in the game with 10 rebounds apiece. Huerta had 12 points and led the team with seven assists and four steals.\n\nCoach Bender’s post-game comments: “We haven’t beaten Frankfort in a long time, so it was a great win for our program. Jake and Owen obviously led us offensively tonight. Jake had 31 and Owen 23 – that’s a combined 54 points on 20 of 33 shooting. And they had 10 rebounds apiece – a great night for both of them.” Vs. Taylor\n\nCarroll entered Saturday’s game against the Titans with a two-game lead in the con- ference standings, guaranteeing no worse than a tie for the 2021-22 conference crown. A victory over Taylor would wrap up an outright title.\n\nTaylor’s offense relies heavily on senior point guard Bobby Wonnell, the head coach’s son, who averages 22 points per game and shoots 47% from behind the arc. Duff was given the defensive challenge of staying with Wonnell, with limited switching on screens designed to keep Duff on his target.\n\nThe Titans missed some early shots in the paint, letting the Cougars stay close in the opening minutes. Duff scored twice from distance to put Carroll ahead 6-4, but Taylor responded to lead at the end of the first period 11-8.\n\nTaylor is an athletic team with players who like to get to the basket, and Bender didn’t think his team was following the scouting report early. “Except for Wonnell, we didn’t think they would hurt us by shooting outside. But we were guarding their drivers 20 feet from the basket and allowing them to get to the rim. And on the offensive end, we were trying to drive the ball when there were no open lanes.”\n\nAnother 3-pointer from Duff and a basket by Huerta tied the game at 13-13 at the 6:40 mark of the second quarter. The score was even again at 15 and 17 as the intensity on both sides continued. Baskets by Duff and Viney and a 3-pointer from Huerta closed out the first half with Carroll up 24-23.\n\nEldridge scored twice in the first three minutes of the second half, which accounted for the only Carroll points while Taylor was opening its biggest lead of the game at 34-28. Four free throws by Duff and a Skinner basket brought the Cougars within 35-34 at the end of three.\n\nFourth quarter … conference crown available … time to step up.\n\nA nice assist from Huerta to Eldridge resulted in a basket and-one, and a Viney assist to Eldridge led to another score. Duff’s trey opened up a 42-35 lead, and Skinner’s three-point play and a bucket by Viney gave the Cougars a 10-point margin at 47-37 with 2:50 to play.\n\nTaylor had grabbed five offensive rebounds in the first quarter, but Carroll limited the Titans to only one over the final three periods. The Cougars were defending without fouling and were limiting Taylor to one contested shot per possession.\n\nViney scored again at the rim to give the Cougars their largest lead of the game at 49-37. Some carelessness against the press allowed Taylor to score the next six points, but Carroll recovered and forced the Titans to foul. Viney stepped to the line and hit both ends of a one-andone, followed by an Eldridge free throw, to bring the final score to 52-43. Conference champs!\n\nDouble-digit scorers for Carroll were Duff with 18 and Eldridge with 10. Skinner led the rebounding effort with 11, while Duff grabbed seven and Eli Harshbarger six. Duff and Huerta had four assists apiece, and Eldridge and Skinner each recorded two steals.\n\nCoach Bender passed out praise after the game: “Harshbarger and Viney provided a spark off of the bench, Eli on the boards in the first half and Griff with timely scoring down the stretch, including some big free throws. Another big performance was Will’s 10 points. He was strong with the ball and able to score when we drove the ball and found him underneath.\n\n“Owen did a terrific job on Wonnell, holding him to one 3-pointer and 12 total points. Our help-side defense got better, and when we backed off of their drivers, we were able to shut them down better. And our rebounding in the second half was terrific – it was one-and-done for them.\n\n“This game was a real battle, and it was a great win for the Cougars … and great to repeat as conference champs!”\n\nThe final week of the regular season is here. The Cougars hosted the 3A Western Panthers last night (Feb. 22) and will close out the season when HHC foe Eastern visits on Thursday, February 24.\n\nWhile Carroll’s focus is on the final two games, the matchup facing the Cougars in the postseason was determined on Sunday. In the class 2A Sectional 38 at Western Boone, Carroll drew the bye to Friday and will play the winner of Tuesday’s Seeger vs. Fountain Central game. Rossville drew the other bye to Friday and will play the winner of Tuesday’s Western Boone vs Clinton Prairie matchup.\n\nJV\n\nCarroll’s junior varsity squad found itself in a battle against Frankfort and used a strong second and fourth quarter effort to defeat the Hot Dogs 55-39. The Falkenberg brothers led the way in scoring – Eli had 13 and Noah 12. Mason Ray paced the rebounding effort with seven, and Trent Metzger had five boards and led the team with five assists and three steals.\n\nThe outcome of Saturday’s contest at Taylor was decided early. Carroll led 26-7 after one quarter and 46-9 at halftime on its way to a 79-18 win. Metzger led Cougar scoring with 22 points, 14 of them coming in the first quarter. E. Falkenberg had 12 points and N. Falkenberg 11. Ray was the top rebounder with seven, followed by Carter Mullens and E. Falkenberg with five each. N. Falkenberg, Ray, and Owen Zinn each handed out three assists, and Ray and N. Falkenberg had four steals apiece."
