        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nHussein M Adam, Robert D Bullard, and Elizabeth Bell. 2001.

When n ...\n\nAutomatic stochastic tagging of natural language texts\n\nFive language and tagset independent stochastic taggers, handling morphological and contextual information, are presented and tested in corpora of seven European languages (Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish), using two sets of ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\n899 pages\n\nISBN:9781450383097\n\nDOI:10.1145/3442188\n\nCopyright © 2021 Owner/Author.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0 License.\n\nPublisher\n\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\n\nNew York, NY, United States\n\nPublication History\n\nPublished: 01 March 2021\n\nCheck for updates\n\nQualifiers\n\nArticle\n\nResearch\n\nRefereed limited\n\nConference\n\nFAccT '21\n\nContributors\n\nOther Metrics\n\nBibliometrics & Citations\n\nBibliometrics\n\nArticle Metrics\n\n271\n\nTotal Citations\n\nView Citations\n\n339,263\n\nTotal Downloads\n\nDownloads (Last 12 months)115,866\n\nDownloads (Last 6 weeks)8,885\n\nOther Metrics\n\nCitations\n\nCited By\n\nView all\n\nSeyedAlinaghi SHabibi PMehraeen EEthical Considerations for AI Use in Healthcare ResearchHealthcare Informatics Research10.4258/hir.2024.30.3.28630:3(286-289)\n\nKritika Generative AI for CybersecurityGenerative AI and Implications for Ethics, Security, and Data Management10.4018/979-8-3693-8557-9.ch009(262-288)\n\nMore AGenerative AIGenerative AI and Implications for Ethics, Security, and Data Management10.4018/979-8-3693-8557-9.ch002(17-46)\n\nDas SPatro UPanda TPani DBadawy HInsights and Future Prospects for ChatGPTApplications, Challenges, and the Future of ChatGPT10.4018/979-8-3693-6824-4.ch005(91-125)\n\nPatil PKulkarni KSharma PAlgorithmic Issues, Challenges, and Theoretical Concerns of ChatGPTApplications, Challenges, and the Future of ChatGPT10.4018/979-8-3693-6824-4.ch003(56-74)\n\nBabu CAnniyappa CSastha B.
