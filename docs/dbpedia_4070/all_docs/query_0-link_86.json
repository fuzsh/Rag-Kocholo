        "text": "Sfakia, which is considered the most authentic region of Crete, is located in the southern part of the prefecture of Chania in an area dominated by mountainous element with an inaccessible land, rocky and steep at a distance of about 71 km from the capital of the prefecture of Chania. The time you will need to reach is around 1.5 hours on a good road but in many places there are many turns, however, you will enjoy yourselves with the beautiful and impressive journey.\n\nThe town of Sfakia is washed by the Libyan Sea and its beautiful picturesque harbor with the small beach and the food shops that surround it, are giving to it a special picturesqueness.\n\nThe village, we can say that, is divided into 2 parts with the first around the old port, with the most tourist companies, hotels, inns and restaurants, while the other, on the east, is where the most of local people have their homes.\n\nAt the area of the old port there are small roads with several shops, where you can go and buy all the necessities.\n\nWith the sun to shine all year round, Sfakia is the sunniest region and the southernmost tip of Europe. The fact that there are virtually no industries, it makes the sea of Sfakia one of the cleanest you can find.\n\nThe drinking water comes from wells or from the mountains' springs, which end in the sea.\n\nThe food is very good with many traditional dishes and, of course, with fresh fish and many local flavors.\n\nThe Sfakians are very friendly and generous and Sfakia is offered to those seeking peaceful traditional holidays, a nice and quiet beach, or those who intend to try mountain climbing, diving and fishing.\n\nOn the east, in a short distance, is the new port that serves the coastal shipping and the vessel's visits.\n\nOn the west, after the end of the village and within a walking distance, you will find a small sand and pebbled beach, well organized with sun beds and umbrellas where you can swim in the crystal clear sea.\n\nThe tourist infrastructure of Sfakia is quite good with many choices for your food, taverns, cafes as well as several rooms that will make your stay pleasant, highlighting the traditional Cretan hospitality.\n\nSfakia can become the headquarters for your sightseeing to the surrounding areas. From here, you can catch one of the boats and to travel to beautiful places, at a short distance, like Loutro, St. Roumeli, Paleochora or to take the ferry to the island of Gavdos.\n\nThe Name\n\nThe name of Sfakia derives probably from \"Sfax\", which means earthy gap and it fits to it because of the many deep canyons of the region, without excluding the version that says that the Town of Sfakia was once called Sfikia and by a word corruption it became Sfakia..\n\nThere is also another version that claims that the name comes from a flower named Sfaka, which means very bitter.\n\nTransportations\n\nIt has a regular ferry link with Agia Roumeli, from where the visitors of the gorge of Samaria come, to Sougia, Loutro, Paleochora and Gavdos island.\n\nSfakian diet\n\nThe Sfakian diet is based on meat and the dairy products, in unique combinations, such as lamb with yoghurt or lamb with butter etc.\n\nIt also includes the other products of the Mediterranean - Cretan diet, such as vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, wine, etc. and sweets in small quantities.\n\nIt holds one of the most important positions in the general Cretan diet because of the peculiarities of the region such as the climate, the isolation and the ground, so has itself all the features of a full diet.\n\nThe tradition of Sfakian is great in cheese production because the main occupation of the inhabitants of the area is the animal farming, with excellent products like cheese, Gruyere, malaka (which is a non-seasoned cheese), Anthotyros fresh and dried, Myzithra, Xynomizithra, yoghurt, Stacka, etc.\n\nSfakians\n\nSfakians, the residents of Chora of Sfakia and of the surrounding area, boast that they are descendants of the Dorians who came in Crete 2000 years ago. Perhaps due to this there is the difference in appearance from the other Cretans. Here, you will see, much more than the rest of Crete, tall, strong, blond men and women with light colored eyes and skin.\n\nGreat sailors and great warriors, took the lead in all the struggles for freedom. The Great Cretan Revolutions against the Venetians and later against the Turks began in Sfakia, although the occupiers had never lived there.\n\nSo far, Sfakians remain authentic strong Cretans, hospitable and friendly enough, but you must be careful not to insult their honor, their wife, their pride and the country. Their excessive sense of honor was one of the reasons the feud (the take of the law into one's hand and the retaliation) had marked Sfakia more than any other area in Crete and plunged into mourning entire families.\n\nIn almost all homes there are weapons, which appear in weddings, baptisms and to each kind of party. The gunshot event is a show of joy.\n\nToday, in Sfakia, the most residents are engaged in animal farming and less on agriculture and in recent years in tourism.\n\nAccommodation in Chania"
