        "text": "This page may contain affiliate links, see our disclaimer here.\n\nSfakia\n\nWild Crete\n\nThe mountainous region Sfakia of in the south-east of the island of Crete in Greece., located in the Chania region. Known for its proud and fiercely independent people, this is a heartland of Crete, with a tremendous history.\n\nAbout Sfakia\n\nThe area is made up of rugged rocky mountains and gorges, steep hills and valleys and a steep, cragged coastline to the south. Away from mass tourism, the transport here is by ferry.\n\nTo get to Χώρα Σφακίων, travel from Chania town to the leafy village of Vryses, then to the high Plateau of Askifou ringed by the White Mountains, then on through spectacular mountain and gorge landscapes as the road travels along the Imbros Gorge, then south to the town. The total journey is 70 km but it can take as long as you like, with plenty of stops to admire the views and take in the fresh mountain air.\n\nThis region is for sure-footed sheep, mountain goats and shepherds, it is very rugged, inhospitable and sparsely populated, the beaches in the south are inaccessible, the steep mountains plunge straight down into the sea.\n\nBecause of its fierce and impenetrable landscape, throughout history the region has been the sanctuary for rebel fighters and allied armies alike.\n\nHistory\n\nFor four hundred years Crete was occupied by the Ottomans, however if you speak to a local they will remind you, that these people never capitulated to either the Venetian or Ottoman rulers, and mounted many rebel armies to fight for their independence during countless campaigns against them.\n\nDuring the second world war, many British and Australian troops owed their lives to the Sfakians, who helped them through the mountains, away from the fighting and to the southern beaches where they were evacuated by ship to Egypt.\n\nHiking, Local Customs & Ghosts\n\nIn today's more peaceful times, the fierce independence still lingers, however visitors will be safe to visit the Σφακιά region, and especially enjoy the peace and quiet of the mountains and the remoteness of the beaches. Just don't insult anybody's mother in a hurry! Keep your respect for these mountain people and they will keep theirs for you.\n\nHikers love the vast and expansive scenery, whilst enjoying the many different ecosystems in the island of Crete, perhaps taking the 320 km trek along the European Walking Path E4, which passes through the White Mountains and this region.\n\nPeter Trudgill is a long time visitor and lover of Sfakia who has written a book about his experiences, named \"In Σφακιά – Passing Time in the Wilds of Crete\".\n\nFrangokastello, now a sleepy beach side village, was once a strategic defense location for the Venetians, who constructed a fort on its low lying peninsula. The fort was taken into many hands throughout the history of Crete, and now lies in ruins; a fascinating reminder of times past.\n\nThe intrigue of the castle at Frangokastello is deepened by the local stories of ghost sightings at a certain time of year.\n\nLoutro Village, (above) is a tiny seaside village of Sfakia accessible only by hiking or by boat.\n\nSamaria Gorge\n\nSamaria Gorge is within the Sfakia region; on the mountainous and gorge areas can be seen extraordinary wildlife such as vultures, eagles and the native Kri Kri goats, see more on our nature pages.\n\nMore on the Samaria Gorge Walk here.\n\nThe walk is open from May to October only and can be closed if there is heavy rain.\n\nThe gorge walk can end or start at the small village of Agia Roumeli.\n\nTake an organised Samaria tour - more info here.\n\nYou can walk the gorge independently, if you have a bit more time. To take the bus to this region from Chania, you need to change at Vryses. At certain times of the year, there are only a few local buses to Chora Sfakion so check the timetable carefully.\n\nMore day trips to Samaria below - with all the transport and logistics taken care of:\n\nImbros Gorge\n\nA shorter walk than Samaria, this lesser known canyon is just as beautiful. Take a hike downhill over rocks and between steep cliffs. Imbros Gorge walk is 8 km and runs from the village of Imbros, south of the Askifou Plateau, to the village of Komitades, near the south coast.\n\nMake the trek independently or choose a local guided experience, below.\n\nFerry\n\nMany visitors come to Sfakia to take the south coast ferry to the small inaccessible beaches and villages that dot the coastline, or to take the ferry to the island of Gavdos.\n\nThe south coast ferry is run by Anendyk SA - see timetable information below.\n\nAccommodation\n\nBelow we suggest some accommodation in the Sfakia area:\n\nChora Sfakion\n\nFrangokastello\n\nLoutro\n\nAgia Roumeli\n\nLocal Food\n\nOnce you are in Sfakia, try the local 'pies', delicious thin pancakes, with local cheese and mountain honey.\n\nAt the Dourountakis Bakery in Chora Sfakion you will find these local specialties and those who are crazy about them. Warning they can be addictive.\n\nTry 'Sfakiano lamb' local lamb, mizithra cheese, fresh caught seafood and 'Cretan salad' or dakos. Get ready to taste local olive oil. Try mezedes or little plates - of everything! Try the local wild greens - horta - including stamnagathi. Ask for 'dopio fagito' or local food.\n\nA very proud local speciality for food lovers is the Sfakiano giahni Σφακιανό Γιαχνί - slow cooked kid.\n\nDon't forget to try one of the local delicacies - Snails in Rosemary - here called Chochlious boubouristous Xοχλιούς μπουμπουριστούς.\n\nVideos of Sfakia\n\nBelow is a beautiful video of the region...including the Lefka Ori, much of the beautiful scenery and wildlife of the region, such as the gorges, caves, wildflowers, the Omalos Plateau and more.\n\nHere you will see the cooking of Snails in Rosemary\n\nEftikis the Happy Traveller shows us around Sfakia\n\nExploring Sfakia\n\nLoutro Village\n\nChapel on Agios Pavlos beach\n\nSamaria Gorge\n\nImbros Gorge\n\nAskifou Plateau\n\nGetting Here\n\nTake a 1 hour flight from Athens to Heraklion with Aegean Airlines or Olympic Air, with many flights available per day.\n\nOr take a 9.5 hour overnight ferry from Pireaus port of Athens to Heraklion port.\n\nMore on flights and ferries below.\n\nCar hire in Crete is a really good idea as it is a large island 60 km by 260 km. There is so much to explore.\n\nWhen you book with our car rental partners - Rental Centre Crete - you are supporting a local company with excellent service and easy online booking. We are sure you will be well looked after by the team. Choose from hybrid, electric or regular vehicles."
