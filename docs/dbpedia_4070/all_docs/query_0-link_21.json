        "text": "When I started this blog, the whole point was to search for iconic foods from New York. Mostly because that is what I do when I travel, so I figured I should have a sense of the most traditional dishes from my own town.\n\nI have strayed a bit. In addition to reviewing bagels and pizza, I also find a dish of the week, produce funny videos from time to time, and find myself cooking at home with a six year old child!\n\nAnd while I still seek out the iconic New York dishes, I definitely still do this when I travel, especially on my recent trip to Crete.\n\nOne day on our trip, we headed south of the city of Chania to the beach town of Loutro, making a stop in a little town known as Hora Sfakion, which is the capital of the mountainous region of Sfakia. After lounging on the beach, we rewarded ourselves with one of the most famous and well-loved pies in all of Crete.\n\nThe adorable little dessert-coffee bar Cafe Despina features beautiful cakes and standard gelato, but also highlights the famous Sfakian Pie.\n\nCrete is known for their pies (or pitas) stuffed with lots of wild greens, cheese and fresh herbs. But the one from Sfakia is on another level.\n\nThis flaky yeasty pancake is blistered and crisped throughout and features a thin delicate layer of local white cheese known as xynomizithra. The cheese is soft with a bit of a tangy salty note.\n\nAnd in case this cheese pie was not delicious enough, it is served with a side of local honey for spreading on top.\n\nThey don’t do pancakes and maple syrup in Chora Sfakion, but what they do may be even better. Just one more reason you’ve got to try the local iconic specialities."
