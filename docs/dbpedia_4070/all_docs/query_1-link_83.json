        "text": "What's New!\n\nDetailed Sitemap\n\nAll images Â© by Roberto Piperno, owner of the domain. Write to romapip@quipo.it. Text edited by Rosamie Moore.\n\nPage revised in February 2012.\n\n- An Excursion to Moni Arkadi\n\nOn Crete memories of the Venetian past of the island can be found also outside the coastal towns. They mainly date from 1550 to 1650 the last century of Venetian rule, when the Republic implemented policies aimed at gaining, if not the support, at least the non-hostility of its Greek subjects.\n\nVeli Pacha (a governor of the island in 1850-58) Tekke and detail of its minaret\n\nBecause this page is based on an excursion from Rettimo (Rethymno) it is worth mentioning a tekke, a sort of monastery outside the walls of that town along the road to Moni Arkadi; usually tekke were associated with the brotherhood of the Whirling Dervishes (you may wish to see the mausoleum of the founder of the order at Konya). The building, which currently houses a Natural History Museum, replaced a Catholic monastery dedicated to St. Onuphrius. Because the saint was a hermit, churches or monasteries dedicated to him were usually located out of town (this can be observed also at S. Onofrio in Rome).\n\nPortal of the Sanguinazzo Venetian House at Amnatos\n\nRettimo is known for the portals which were built when the town was reconstructed after having been raided by the Ottomans in 1571. A similar portal can be found in the village of Amnatos, two miles before Moni Arkadi. The inscription is almost identical to that placed by Pope Sixtus V above the entrance to Archiginnasio della Sapienza in Rome: Initium Sapientiae Timor Domini (The Psalms 111, 10 - The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom).\n\nMoni Arkadi\n\nThe first image of the monastery is that of a fortified site with all the buildings arranged around a large square courtyard; the white portal which gives access to the interior was built in the late XIXth century after the 1866 events which greatly damaged some parts of the complex.\n\n(left) Eastern walls; (right) Candia (Iraklion) door\n\nWhen in 1821 the Greeks of Peloponnese rose against the Ottomans from Patras and Kalamata, and also the Sfakians, the inhabitants of south-western Crete, who had maintained their Greek Orthodox beliefs, rebelled. Their revolt was quelled by the intervention of Egyptian troops and the whole island was ruled by the Egyptians until 1840.\n\nIn 1866 Moni Arkadi became the centre of a rebellion of the Rethymno district. Nearly 1,000 people gathered in the monastery, which was soon surrounded by Ottoman troops. Three messengers escaped from the rear door to search in vain for help.\n\n(left) The powder magazine; (right) monument to Kostas Giaboudakis in Rethimno\n\nThe defenders withstood assaults for two days, but in the end they were unable to prevent the Ottomans from entering through a large breach in the western walls. Women and children sought refuge inside a cellar which had been turned into a powder magazine. When the first Ottoman soldiers were about to enter the building, Kostas Giaboudakis, one of the leaders of the revolt, ignited the barrels of powder causing the death of many soldiers and about all the Greek civilians.\n\nIn 1898 Crete acquired a semi-independent status and in 1913 it was annexed to Greece. Moni Arkadi became a memorial of the Cretan fight for freedom.\n\nThe church\n\nIn 1828 J. A. Cramer described Moni Arkadi as the most beautiful and the richest convent of the island, but he was probably relying on second hand information about the economic situation of the monastery which instead was very prosperous in 1587 when a new church was built at the site of a smaller one. At that time the monastery was benefitting from the large revenue deriving from the production of Malvasia di Candia, a sweet wine which was highly praised in western Europe. The name Malvasia derived from the Venetian port by the same name from which a sweet wine of the Peloponnese was shipped. After the Venetians lost Malvasia in the early XVIth century it was applied to other similar wines. The trade of Malvasia di Candia declined during the period of Ottoman rule.\n\nThe faÃ§ade seen from the upper portico of the courtyard\n\nThe elaborate faÃ§ade of the church was designed by someone familiar with Italian Renaissance developments in the second half of the XVIth century. The faÃ§ade does not correspond to the interior of the church which is made up of two identical prayer halls. The walled central door was designed in order to enhance the symmetry of the faÃ§ade whereas the central bell tower made it more imposing.\n\nDetails of the faÃ§ade\n\nAll the main churches of Rethymno were largely modified by the Ottomans after they conquered the town. We can assume that their faÃ§ades had an elaborate design, as they were built at the same time as that of Moni Arkadi.\n\nThe twin apses\n\nOne altar of the church is dedicated to the Transfiguration of Jesus, whereas the other one is dedicated to St. Helena and her son Emperor Constantine, who is revered as a saint by the Greek Orthodox Church.\n\nChurches having twin prayer halls where not uncommon in some Venetian possessions such as Nasso; they were built to bring together Catholic and Orthodox subjects.\n\nViews of the courtyard\n\nIntroductory page on the Venetian fortresses in Crete\n\nGrambusa (Granvousa) and Castello (Kasteli/Kissamos)\n\nCandia (Iraklion)\n\nLa Canea (Xania) and Souda\n\nRettimo (Rethymno)\n\nSpinalonga and Castel Mirabello\n\nAn Excursion to Kritsa\n\nSittia and Paleocastro\n\nCastelfranco (Frangokastelo) and other castles on the southern coast\n\nIntroductory page on the Venetian fortresses\n\nYou may refresh your knowledge of the history of Venice in the Levant by reading an abstract from the History of Venice by Thomas Salmon, published in 1754.
