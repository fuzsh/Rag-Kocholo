They are spread throughout the island, so take your pick!\n\nLassithi Plateau – East Crete\n\nLassithi Plateau is a municipality and a picturesque plain surrounded by mountains. It is in the prefecture of Lassithi about 70km east of Heraklion. The plateau is also known for its picturesque windmills. In the 1950s and 1960s, the plateau was one of the first wind farms in Europe. There were about 10-13 thousand windmills that pumped groundwater, with which its inhabitants irrigated their crops.\n\nArchaeological Research\n\nIn the wider area of ​​the plateau, there are antiquities of the Minoan era. The Minoans, in 1100 BC, had problems with the Dorians who arrived in the area, where according to historical data they created a settlement. In later years they moved to neighboring areas of the plateau. In fact, in the village of Plati, there is a Minoan style settlement. Furthermore, on the hill “Karfi” north of Lassithi, they built temples and even a sanctuary of Asclepius, in a city which was the fourth largest in Crete at that time.\n\nThe Windmills\n\nThe most remarkable complex of windmills that survives in Crete is in Seli Ampelou on the Lassithi Plateau. Built at the northern entrance of the plain, it characterizes the whole area. These are the 24 surviving windmills today (of the 26 original), of which 7 extend south of the entrance road to the plateau and the rest on its north side. The people of Lassithi used these windmills were used to grind wheat. Their existence is mentioned from the time of Venetian rule. In particular, the mills of Ampelos were moved from Zaroma to this location from the end of the 19th century.\n\nLassithi Plateau and Diktaion Andron – Experience by Elissos Travelling Philosophy\n\nA unique experience that offers you and your loved ones the opportunity to visit the east side of Crete participating in a wide range of nature and traditional activities. On the mountains of Dikti and at an altitude of 850 meters, you will reach the fertile Lassithi plateau. Do not forget to charge your camera as you will have the urge to capture the exquisite scenery and the authentic Cretan villages. A little higher up, at an altitude of 900 meters, visit the Cave of Zeus. According to Homer, the impressive temple was the birthplace of the Father of all Gods and Immortals, Zeus. After you have authentic Cretan mountain cuisine for lunch, take part in one of the two fun and interactive activities we have in store. Choose between a pottery workshop for the more artistic ones and a Greek circular dance course for the more active ones!\n\nAskifou Plateau – West Crete\n\nAskifou Plateau is about 50 km away from Chania, located at an altitude of 730 meters. The plateau is surrounded by the White Mountains and looks like a giant cup, which in ancient Greek is called skyphos (skyphos = Askifou). The Plateau of Askifos was probably a lake in Prehistoric times. Today as a fertile field it grows wheat and potatoes. Here, in 1821, a great battle took place between the Turks and the Sfakians, which ended in a victory for the locals. The vigorousness of the battle and the heroism of the locals are still praised in local songs. Above Askifou in Tavri near the Niatos Plateau is a mountain refuge. The area is ideal for beautiful nature walks. In the village of Askifos and Amoudari, you can try the local Sfakiani pie, the delicious Kefalotyri, and the local thyme honey, in the pleasant square of the village.\n\nChania Nature Experience – by Elissos Travelling Philosophy\n\nAn amazing nature experience that will take you from an imposing gorge to an impressive plateau. Hike the Imbros gorge that is in the south of the Chania region and discover the incredible fauna and flora. The ancient Askifou plateau that you will visit used to be a lake and has been around for over a thousand years. Walk on the remarkable soil and you will learn about the important battles for independence that took place there. Finally, you will enjoy a Cretan lunch with local delicacies overlooking the Libyan Sea.\n\nNida Plateau – Central Crete\n\nNida plateau is at an altitude of 1450 meters between the eastern and western mountains of Psiloritis. Psiloritis is a bare mysterious mountain with streaks and a lunar face. Everything there is primitive, only the cool north wind, the bells of the sheep can be heard. Maybe even from the time of Zeus. In mythology, the Kurites, the guardians of Zeus, struck their shields hard on the beautiful plateau of Nida to protect the divine infant from the fury of Cronus. West of the Nida plateau is the Ida Cave, a great archaeological site.\n\nHistory\n\nFrom 1940 onwards it was almost certain that because the Germans would undoubtedly have air superiority over Crete, their main targets would be the major airports. Moreover, they would also try to land forces elsewhere inland of the island. The great Plateau of Nida was an ideal location. John Pendlebury was one of those who organized local groups to fight the invaders and prevent their planning. The groups he organized consisted of the remaining elderly people from the surrounding villages of Psiloritis, as well as the wounded who had returned from the Albanian war and could carry weapons.\n\nAlthough Pendlebury was not a trained soldier, he was chosen for this purpose because of his comprehensive knowledge of Crete, its people, and their language, knowledge gained through his years of archaeological experience on the island. Pendlebury’s idea was to equip the Cretans and had repeatedly asked for about ten thousand rifles to be sent to Crete. His demands seemed to fall through the cracks as the factories where the rifles were made, had suffered serious damages. Even though about three thousand rifles were sent to Crete from America, they did not reach John.\n\nMysteries of the Cretan Born Zeus – Experience by Elissos Travelling Philosophy\n\nA sacred experience that will introduce you and your family to traditional villages with breathtaking views in Central Crete where you will enjoy local food and music. Arolithos village has numerous old houses, a Folk-Art Museum, and a central square where you can enjoy your Greek coffee. Participate in traditional workshops, such as weaving, mosaics making, kneading, and cooking. However, perhaps the most exciting part of your activity will be your hike to a holy cave where according to the myth, is connected to the worshipping of Zeus. You will reach the beautiful plateau of Nida and you will hike for 20 minutes until you come across the second biggest Cave in Crete, Ida Cave. After this impressive tour, lunch in a “mitato”, a stone-built shepherd’s hut on the top of the mountains. There, you will enjoy the astonishing views as well as Cretan specialties such as antikristo!\n\nOmalos Plateau – West Crete\n\nThe plateau of Omalos is 38 km from Chania and at an altitude of 1080 meters in the White Mountains. During the Turkish occupation, it was a den of revolutionaries. Only twice did the Turks manage to get there for a few days, during the failed revolution of the years 1886 – 1888. The plateau of Omalos has been associated with many historical events and is an integral point of reference in the narrative of the course of Chania. Seven mountain peaks of the White Mountains surround the plateau. Another feature of the plateau is that it borders three provinces which connect you with three respective passages that constitute the entrances and exits of the plateau.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nThe plateau of Omalos is a place where unique animals live, such as the Cretan Kri-Kri. Kri-Kri goats live in small groups of two to five. They live only in Crete and belong to the endangered species. A major problem is the mixing of the population with goats, resulting in the alteration of the species. In addition, researchers from the Museum of Natural History of Crete recently found the Cretan wildcat in the White Mountains. They were thought of as extinct. Also, Omalos has vultures and golden eagles.\n\nIt is worth talking about the rich fauna of the area. In the wider area of ​​the White Mountains grow 100 species of endemic plants out of the 180 that are throughout Crete. The rich vegetation of Omalos is attributed to its geographical location. However, apart from the rare species of plants that grow on its slopes, it has centuries-old huge trees. The land on the plateau is fertile in an area of ​​about 6000 acres. The main products it produces being wheat and potatoes.\n\nSamaria Gorge Trekking – Experience by Elissos Travelling Philosophy\n\nThe gorge of Samaria is situated in the National park of Samaria, in the White Mountains in West Crete, and it is said to be one of the longest, narrowest, and steepest gorges of Europe. The gorge of Samaria is 16 km long starting at an altitude of 1230m and taking you all the way down to the shores of the Libyan Sea in Agia Roumeli village. The hike through the National Park of Samaria is unique. Admire pine trees of thousands of years growing along its length and on both sides of an ancient river going all the way down and exiting at the Libyan see.\n\nRare and ancient endemic flowers and herbs grow in the gorge. The gorge being also the refuge of the famous “kri-kri” goats of Crete, a pre-historic species. The village of Samaria lies just inside the gorge. It was finally abandoned by the last remaining inhabitants in 1962 to make way for the park. The village and the gorge take their names from the village’s ancient church dedicated to virgin Mary."
