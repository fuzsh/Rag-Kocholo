        "text": "Sfakianes Pites come from the region of Crete known as Sfakia (hence the name) and are the perfect example of delicious simplicity. They‚Äôre filled with local xynomizithra cheese, pan-fried (without oil or butter) and then, served with a generous drizzle of Cretan honey. Such a treat!\n\nMy mom grew up in the village of Anopolis, Sfakia. We spent loads of time there on our summertime visits to Crete to see family. My yiayia (Greek word for grandma) had stacks of Sfakianes Pites ready for us in her freezer, along with so many other goodies. Just like most traditional recipes from Crete, these pies are made using the most simple, local ingredients yet, their flavor is so complex. The exterior of the pita is slightly crisp while still soft on the inside. It is filled with a tangy ricotta-type cheese known as xynomizithra and then, drizzled with local thyme honey. Absolutely divine! Oh, how I wish I could turn back time and eat one of these delicacies from my grandma‚Äôs hands. Such sweet memories.\n\nIngredients for Sfakianes Pites:\n\nall-purpose flour\n\nsalt\n\nolive oil\n\nvinegar or lemon juice\n\nmyzithra cheese\n\nGreek thyme honey\n\nWhat is a good substitute for myzithra cheese?\n\nIf you are lucky enough to live by a Greek specialty food store, then try some myzithra cheese. It is creamy, tangy, and very complex in flavor. However, not all of us can easily buy this delicacy (me too!!) so luckily, there are some good substitutes.\n\nThe closest substitute is a combination of drained ricotta cheese (if you can find ricotta salata from an Italian market then, you won‚Äôt have to drain regular ricotta overnight) combined with sheep‚Äôs milk feta cheese. For this batch (makes 4 pies) you will need 5 ounces of ricotta and 3 ounces of feta cheese. The sheep‚Äôs milk feta works much better than cow‚Äôs milk and makes this combination taste more like actual myzithra.\n\nIf you prefer a milder filling then, just use ricotta cheese.\n\nHow to drain ricotta cheese:\n\nLike I mentioned before, if you can get some ricotta salata that is sold in Italian markets, it is very close in texture to myzithra cheese and does not need to be drained. However, the ricotta cheese that is sold in the supermarket holds a lot of moisture and will ruin your pies if it is not properly drained. This is very simple to do.\n\nLine a strainer with a kitchen towel (or cheesecloth) and set it over a deeper bowl so that it is suspended over it and not touching the liquid that will drop to the bottom of the bowl.\n\nPlace the ricotta cheese in the strainer.\n\nPlace a few pieces of thick paper towel over the ricotta and place some weight on top. A jar, smaller bowl, or a bag of beans will work. This is to compress the ricotta and to help release the moisture.\n\nSet it in the refrigerator overnight.\n\nIn the morning, the ricotta will be thicker and ready to use.\n\nTo quickly remove the moisture you can place the ricotta onto a plate that has been lined with paper towels and flatten it out. Cover it with more paper towels and keep changing the towels once they are wet with the moisture that is released. In an hour or two, the ricotta will be ready to use. I‚Äôve drained ricotta cheese this way several times when I wanted to make these pies last minute and didn‚Äôt want to wait for the ricotta to drain overnight. üòÅ\n\nImportant Tips:\n\nOnce the dough is prepared, it needs to rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. This helps the dough stay soft and supple. So, don‚Äôt skip this step.\n\nPan fry them over medium heat without any butter or oil.\n\nRoll the dough out as thin as possible without tearing it. This will help the pie cook evenly.\n\nCan the Sfakianes Pites be frozen?\n\nYes! That‚Äôs the second-best part. First, is obviously, how delicious they are.üòä\n\nAssemble the pies and place parchment paper between them. Transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container and store in the freezer for up to 3 months. You can then cook them frozen over low heat and raise the heat to medium for the final 2-3 minutes.\n\nWhere is Cretan Honey sold?\n\nHoney from Crete is hands down my favorite. The texture is almost like caramel and there are hints of thyme and oregano somewhere in there that give this honey such a unique flavor.\n\nThis honey is sold in Mediterranean markets and online. Here are some of my favorite brands from my Amazon affiliate:\n\nI hope that you give these pites a try and that you enjoy them with loved ones. If you do, share pics with me on Facebook & Instagram.\n\nDo you have any recipe requests? Post them in the comments section and will share them with you as soon as I can.\n\nKali Orexi and I will be back soon with a new recipe for you.\n\nWatch the Video Tutorial:"
