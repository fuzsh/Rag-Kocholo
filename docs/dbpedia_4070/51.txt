The Sfakian pie, also known as Sfakianopita or sfakiani pie in Crete, is a traditional dish from the region of Sfakia in Crete.

The pie is made with myzithra and a thin delicious dough, served warm with honey.

The roots of the sfakian pie can be traced back to the 17th century, when the inhabitants of Sfakia were forced to take refuge in the mountains to escape the Ottoman Empire. They had to make do with what they had, and so the σφαkienopita was born. The dish was made with local ingredients such as wild greens and herbs, as well as the famous Cretan cheeses such as mizithra and graviera.

There are many variations of the sfakian pie, each with its own unique taste. Some include the addition of eggs, while others include minced meat or greens. However, regardless of the variations, the dish remains a staple of Cretan cuisine.
