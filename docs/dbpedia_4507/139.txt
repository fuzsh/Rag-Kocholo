What is a mental image?

A collection (set) of sensory inputs (non-visual or with low vision) that create a gestalt (holistic) image of a specific location in space. They are about layout and perceived routes.

How do you create mental images?

1. Establish a reference point.

2. Establish a set (frozen) body position at the reference point

3. Localize (determine) auditory (and tactual) input in relationship to your body.

4. Have a sighted friend (or a mobility specialist) "paint" a mental picture of objects in the room relative to your location

5. Verbally describe the setting based on all the feedback

6. To build a greater understanding of small spaces, exploration (going and coming from the reference point) is needed.
