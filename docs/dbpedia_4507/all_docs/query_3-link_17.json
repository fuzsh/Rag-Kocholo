        "text": "I have just started having issues with the orientation of some of my images on my posts. I noticed today that several of my old posts had the portrait images flipping 90 degrees even though they had been fine previously. Also, I am now trying to upload a new post but again some of my images are doing the same. On the draft they show up the correct way, but as soon as I preview the page the flip to incorrect orientation.\n\nThe blog I need help with is: (visible only to logged in users)\n\nThanks galois!\n\nI looked at http://b-s-oztour.com/week-4-cairns-back-to-airlie-beach-athertons-tablelands/\n\nAnd this is a direct link to the first image that appears in that post that looks like it has the wrong image orientation: http://b-s-oztour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160716_114444-e1472295017926.jpg\n\nI checked the meta data for the 20160716_114444-e1472295017926.jpg image with exiftool and it says Orientation : Rotate 90 CW and that seems correct but when I download and view the image on my computer (which should also honor orientation data), it still appears turned to the side.\n\nThe description of images flipping 90 degrees even though they had been fine previously is the part that sounds odd, and that doesn’t seem like it should happen in either a WordPress.com or a WordPress.org setup.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that something is off with the images themselves in this case. I would be curious to know if the problem continues to happen and if it only happens with photos taken with the same device, which appears to be a Samsung (camera model SM-G900I) in this case. Also, if more people are having this problem, it would be good to collect more information about it. Since I haven’t seen widespread complaints about it, that leads me to believe it’s a more isolated problem related to the device or device type or something with how the images are being saved/transferred/modified before they are uploaded.\n\nThanks for checking into this.\n\nThe problem is still ongoing and I have tried several plugins to correct without any luck. The issue only occurs with portrait and does seem to be related to the samsung device. The only way I have found to avoid the issue is to upload the images to my computer, make an edit of the image on the computer and save before uploading to the image library.\n\nThe problem started to occur following a wordpress update. Strangely the image will appear correctly in the draft, but flips on publishing. But I feel it is related to the last update as all posts that I had published prior to the update were fine until then.\n\nThe issue only occurs with portrait and does seem to be related to the samsung device.\n\nCan you tell me a little more about the device? What kind of Samsung is it and what version of Android it is running?\n\nI noticed your latest post http://b-s-oztour.com/chillagoe-to-devils-marbles/ has portrait images that appear to have the correct orientation, did you manually fix those the way you described earlier (upload the images to my computer, make an edit of the image on the computer and save before uploading)?"
