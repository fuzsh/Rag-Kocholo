        "text": "An interactive image is a digital photo, illustration or picture containing clickable buttons, links, and audiovisual content. When you hover or click on an interactive image hotspot, it triggers something to happen or appear on the screen. Think popup windows, music, text, images, sound effects, or cool animations and games that get your audience actively involved in the content.Â\n\nÂ\n\nWith Genially, you can make any type of image interactive: screenshots, selfies, photos, maps, diagrams, floor plans, product specifications, graphic designs and more. Youâre not limited to static pictures: try creating an interactive GIF or animated GIF.\n\nÂ\n\nGenially is a free alternative to ThingLink, allowing anyone to make images interactive and animated in a couple of clicks. Build your own design on a blank canvas, or browse the Template Gallery for ideas and inspiration.\n\nItâs easy to make an image interactive or make a photo clickable by adding hotspots. Just upload your image to Genially, choose where you want to place the hotspots, then add interactions, links, or embedded content.\n\nÂ\n\nFor a great user experience, use animated hotspot markers to show people what to click on. If you want to hide clues or games in your image, add an invisible Interactive Area.\n\nWith Genially, itâs easy to embed interactive images in WordPress, your CMS, publishing platform or website builder. Design your image in Genially and click Publish; this gives you a unique url for the image.Â\n\nÂ\n\nCopy and paste this link into the Visual tab in WordPress and your interactive image will appear directly on your web page or blog. To speed up your workflow, try the Genially plug-in for WordPress.\n\nGenially offers you multiple ways to add a link to an image, or make an image into a link! First up, choose which part of the image you want to add a hyperlink to. To highlight where the link is located, add an animated button, marker, icon or CTA.Â\n\nÂ\n\nNow paste in the url or web address you want to link to. Choose whether you want the link to open inside the interactive image or in a new window in the web browser. VoilÃ !\n\nGood news - you donât need to use HTML or CSS to create a clickable image. Genially is a free no-code tool for creating image maps in seconds.Â\n\nIn a couple of clicks, you can add interactive hotspots and rich media to photos, illustrations, diagrams, GIFs and other visuals. No need to calculate coordinates, define area tags, img elements or img src - just point, click, and done. Itâs fast, intuitive, and easy to update content at any time.\n\nWant to put a video inside a static image? Trying to embed a video inside a photo? You can do it for free in Genially, without writing a single line of code.Â\n\nJust add an image to the canvas then select an interactive pop-up window. Insert a video in the image by pasting in the video. Genially is compatible with YouTube, Vimeo and other video streaming platforms.Â\n\nWhen people click on the image, the video will appear in the pop-up box. Ready to play, right inside the image. Magic!\n\nThe best way to add audio to images, photos, maps, diagrams and illustrations is to use Geniallyâs free interactive image maker. In a couple of clicks, you can insert MP3 files, music, click-to-play audio descriptions, voice notes or sound effects into any image.Â\n\nÂ\n\nTo add a sound file to a JPG,GIF, SVG or PNG, just upload the image to Genially. Set the audio to play on loop in the background, or add an interactive hotspot with a click trigger. Add a play button to the image to show your audience what to click on.Â Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nGenially offers you multiple ways to add audio to image files. Upload an MP3 from your device, record your own voiceover, or embed music directly into your image from Spotify, SoundCloud and other streaming platforms."
