        "text": "Russound's XTS in-wall touchscreen doesn't take its job lying down, unless that is what the job calls for.\n\nThanks to a recent update, our popular XTS touchscreen -- an advanced, intuitive touchscreen control for Russound's XStream systems and MCA-Series Controllers -- nowfeatures a Landscape mode that allows it to be mounted horizontally in order to better accommodate a two-gang opening in any installation, especially those where the XTS is replacing a two-gang device.\n\nIn addition to Landscape mode, the control now includes a redesigned Settings Menu that simplifies access to audio controls and display options, a convenient new Room List button for intuitive room selection, and an updated Streaming Source Menu button that is a direct pathway to the menu for the streaming source currently selected.\n\nWhat may be most important to consumers is how easy it is to use the XTS touchscreen, since it replicates the MyRussound app for full control of any zone in the system. Its elegant exterior is backed up by a powerful Cortex-A9 processor, which supports both gestures and multi-touch operation, with easy firmware upgrades as needed."
