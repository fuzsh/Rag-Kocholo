        "text": "We all know the saying: a picture speaks a thousand words. And this is never more true than when it comes to ecommerce and selling on marketplaces like Etsy. In fact, according to Etsy, quality product photography is the most influential factor in consumersâ purchase decision, surpassing product cost, shipping cost, and reviews.\n\nTo stand out from the noise, and make your voice heard, your product images are of utmost importance.Â\n\nWith nearly 7.5 million active sellers on Etsy, getting customers to stop scrolling is key. And even if you have the most amazing product photos to post on your listings, if theyâre not compatible with Etsy photo size requirements, no one will get a chance to see them.Â\n\nIn this post, get a comprehensive guide to Etsy listing photo size and other image requirements.Â\n\nEtsy photo basics\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nSize: 2000 pixels for the shortest side\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nBefore we jump into the juicy stuff, letâs quickly cover some of the basics. As far as universal truths go, Etsy only accepts .jpg, .gif, and .png files, so ensure your product photos are in one of these formats. Animated .gif and transparent .png files arenât accepted. It will also automatically convert all files to sRGB color mode, so youâll want to adjust on your end first for best results.\n\nEtsy image size guidelines for 2024\n\nIt's important to note that each type of image has its own specific size requirements. So, to make it easier for you to find the info you need, hereâs a handy chart and then weâll go through each size requirement for Etsy product listings down below.Â\n\n{{etsy-table-1=\"/background-videos\"}}\n\nDetailed specs for each type of Etsy image are as follows:Â\n\nListing images\n\nSize: at least 1000 pixels wide; 3000 x 2250 pixels recommended\n\nNumber of images: up to 10; at least 5 recommended\n\nAspect ratio: 4:3 recommended\n\nOrientation: landscape or square for the first image; recommend using the same orientation for all listing images\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\n{{resizer-upload=\"/external-components\"}}\n\nYour listing images are extremely important. To ensure a clear, up-close look, use a listing photo thatâs at least 1000 pixels wide. This way, when shoppers click the zoom button, the enlarged image will be crystal clear.\n\nRemember, first impressions matter! To set the tone for your product listing, use a photo at least 3000 pixels wide and 2250 pixels tall, in landscape or square orientation. This is the photo shoppers will see when they search for products. Itâs also best practice to choose an image that showcases as much as the product or its best feature as much as possible.\n\nUsing a landscape or square format will help create a nice cropped thumbnail image that appears in the search results, making it easier to spot. Etsy recommends using the same size and orientation photos for all your listings for a smooth shopping experience.Â\n\nYou can upload up to 10 listing images. Many successful listings have at least five photos, each providing shoppers with additional information about the product. Try photographing the product at different angles, or showcasing features that might not be captured all in one shot, such as the inside of a bag or the bottom of a shoe.\n\nShop icon\n\nRecommended size: 500 x 500 pixels\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nYour shop icon is essentially a logo for your Etsy store. Itâs a small graphic thatâs used across different areas of your shop to help build brand awareness and offer an instant way for shoppers to visually identify the merchant.Â\n\nUse a shop icon that reflects your brand and looks good whether rendering large or small. That means keep backgrounds clean, graphics and illustrations simple, and text short and easy to read.Â\n\nBio and profile photo\n\nMin size: 400 x 400 pixels; 500 x 500 pixels recommended\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nOrientation: square\n\nYour Etsy profile photo is essentially an image of yourself, the shop owner. Etsy is a more personal marketplace, and many shoppers like to know who theyâre supporting, and who is physically making the products.Â\n\nYou canât actually delete your Etsy profile photo, but you can replace it with a new one at any time. Choose a clear, well-lit headshot or close-up of your faceânothing shot at a distance.Â\n\nTeam logo\n\nRecommended size: 170 x 100 pixels\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nOrientation: square\n\nOrder receipt banner\n\nMin size: 760 x 100 pixels\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nThe order receipt banner appearsâyou guessed it!âat the top of order receipts. Itâs a great place to reinforce your brandâs visual identity.Â\n\nShop banner\n\nThe minimum required size for mini shop banners isÂ\n\nMini shop banner min size: 1200 x 160 pixels; 1600 x 213 pixels recommendedÂ\n\nBig shop banner min size: 1200 x 300 pixels; 1600 x 400 pixels recommendedÂ\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nYou can choose from one of two types of shop banners: a mini shop banner or a big shop banner. Mini shop banners work if you want to prioritize the focus on your shop icon and listings. Big shop banners are great for big, bold visuals or timely promotions.Â\n\nCarousel banner\n\nRecommended size: 1200 x 300 pixels\n\nNumber of images: up to 4\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nCarousel banners are only available to Etsy Plus subscribers. They cycle through up to four different images. This is great if you want to feature a range of products or promotions, especially because you can link each one to a unique URL.Â\n\nCollage banner\n\nNumber of images: up to 4\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nCollage banners are only available to sellers subscribed to Etsy Plus. The minimum required image size for Etsy collage banners changes depending on how many images you feature in the collage:Â\n\n2 images: 600 x 300 pixels\n\n3 images: 400 x 300 pixels\n\n4 images: 300 x 300 pixels\n\nThumbnails\n\nRecommended size: 570 x 456 pixels\n\nFile type: JPG, GIF, or PNG\n\nColor mode: sRGB\n\nResolution: 72PPI\n\nFile size: less than 1 MB for faster uploading\n\nNo matter how incredible your image gallery is, if your thumbnail image isnât up to scratch, you wonât get the clicks you need to make the sale. So itâs super important you get the thumbnail just right!\n\nWhen your listings first appear, they show as small thumbnails, only made into a larger gallery once clicked. The first photo in your listing becomes the thumbnail for that particular listing. Itâs the image potential buyers will see when they come across your shop's homepage, search results, and other sections of Etsy.Â\n\nWhen you upload a photo to your listings, ensure you have enough room to crop. The recommended Etsy thumbnail size is 570 x 456 pixels, so you might need to adjust your photo accordingly.\n\nVideos\n\nLength: 5â15 seconds\n\nResolution: at least 1080 pixels\n\nNumber of videos: 1 per listing\n\nEtsy also allows for the use of video. Product videos can complement the story your photos tell. Videos are a great way to add some action to capture shoppersâ attention!Â\n\nYou can include audio in your video but Etsy will remove it before publishing it live. So donât worry if you donât like the sound of your own voice or the dog started barking during the shoot.Â\n\nResizing your images for Etsy\n\nOnce you know what Etsy image sizes you need, you can repurpose and resize the photos you already have and upload them accordingly. Donât panic just yetâthereâs no need for design experience here! To resize your images for your Etsy listings, there are many online sites you can use, ranging from drag-and-drop user-friendly platforms such as Canva, to advanced programs like Adobe Photoshop for the pros. Or you can take advantage of a free tool like our soona image resizer ð.Â\n\nSure, weâre biased, but we love our image resizer because it already knows all the specs for Etsy. And most other marketplaces and channels youâd want to sell, including Amazon, Facebook, and eBay.Â\n\nKeep in mind that decreasing the size of an image won't affect its resolution, but if you increase the size, the resolution may decrease, causing pixelation. Also note that uploaded images may appear less clear from file compression.\n\nHow to take a perfect Etsy listing image photo\n\nNow itâs time for the fun part! Taking photos for your Etsy listing doesnât have to be complicated, but there are a few tips and tricks that you can follow to get the perfect shot, every time.\n\nQuick tips:\n\nThe first photo in your Etsy listing should be horizontal or square, so the main focus of the image is visible in the thumbnail. Using the same shape for all your listing photos will make your store look more consistent.\n\nEtsy automatically rotates photos, but if your images are still sideways, try rotating them using a photo editor or by retaking the photo from a different angle.Â\n\nCrop your images accurately using Etsyâs crop tool.\n\nTake pictures of your item from further away than you think youâll need.\n\nUse the placement tool to make fine-tuning adjustments to your thumbnail.\n\nYour final image will be cropped from the original, so make sure it was created at the highest resolution possible to meet the suggested minimum size for listing images.\n\nAdd the wow factor to your Etsy listing pictures with soona\n\nLooking to take your Etsy shop to the next level?
