        "text": "I know this is not optimal to see at the size of the posted images, but thought it might be useful.\n\nI’m sure many of you have seen all the buzz about DXO Pure Raw in the past couple of weeks. I decided to download the trial and see what all the buzz was about. I won’t go into all the workflow as you can easily find that on the web, but suffice it to say as a LightRoom user, it could not be easier.\n\nThis is an image from 2017 taken at ISO 12800 on a Canon 5D Mark IV. Moon was at about 1/4 full so the entire scene is lit by the moon. Had to push the ISO that high to try to keep the shutter speed fast enough to avoid star trails and I had to stop down to f/5.6 to get enough DOF to keep the foreground rocks sharp and the distant mountains. The scene was quite dark even with the moon as it was pretty low in the sky.\n\nMinimal processing after using DXO Pure RAW. I applied minor adjustments in LR. I then copied those adjustments from the DXO file and applied them to original RAW. I open both of them in Photoshop, then applied Topaz Denoise AI to the original RAW file with the default settings. The comparison image shows the top part of the image with the two images side by side at 100%. The difference in the luminance is solely from the demosaicing process between DXO and LR. Yes, I could brighten the image to get them closer, but wanted to show the result without any further processing.\n\nThis is just one example. I have no affiliation with DXO, just wanted to share my early experiences seeing what all the buzz was about.\n\nI believe that is correct. They use the term “Lifetime License” with this description. Doesn’t say it is a one time purchase forever, but these are the words:\n\n“A lifetime license means that the license that you own is not automatically charged to be upgraded. This license will continue to work only on the listed, supported OS versions and with the listed, supported third party program versions as well.”\n\nWhen I purchased Topaz Denoise it was called Denoise 6. In the End User Agreement it clearly stated that ALL upgrades were free of charge for life. Denoise AI came along and sure enough I got an upgrade for free. Then a few more minor upgrades, then Topaz decided to change their policy despite their promise in their End User License Agreement and charge for upgrades. I’ve been looking for a good solution ever since.\n\nI have been a DxO photo lab user for at least three years. I have always found their de-noise engine to be superior to Topaz although there are times when I will use both DxO and Topaz Denoise on the same image.\n\nIf you own DxO photo lab, it is exactly the same Denoising engine that is used in DxO Pure Raw. As such, there is no need to own or install DxO Pure Raw if you already have photo lab on your machine.\n\nWith respect to the lifetime license with DxO. I started out with their original product when it was version 2. I had to pay a partial amount to upgrade to version 3 and to version 4. At the time when I purchased DxO photo lab, the cost was $200 but it could be found for $150. Upgrades have been in the neighborhood of $80 from version 2 to version 3 and from version 3 to version 4. They do reward loyalty from the standpoint of not charging full price.\n\nMy main issue with DxO has been how slow they are to include new cameras. As an example, my new Sony will not be supported until early June. It took them about three months from the introduction of the Sony A7r4 until it was supported.\n\nThere are some workarounds. They are just time consuming. If you have a new Sony or other camera camera that is not supported, contact me and I will tell you how to possibly find a workaround."
