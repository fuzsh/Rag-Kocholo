Understanding these ratios will help you optimize your videos for maximum impact and engagement on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn.\n\nInstagram offers a bit more flexibility with video aspect ratios. The Instagram Feed supports three different options:\n\n16:9 (landscape)\n\n4:5 (portrait)\n\n1:1 (square)\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that Instagram has combined all videos into one video tab. This means that when your feed videos are viewed on that tab, they will be played in a 9:16 format, with borders automatically added to the top and bottom of the video.\n\nInstagram Stories and Reels maintain a consistent aspect ratio of 9:16.\n\nTikTok, known for its short and snappy videos, primarily supports full portrait videos in a 9:16 aspect ratio.\n\nIf you upload content in a different aspect ratio, such as square or landscape, the platform will automatically center the video on the canvas and add borders to fill the empty space."
