        "text": "Today, our social media feeds are filled with videos, moving pictures, and GIF reactions. People are scrolling mindlessly through TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter, not remembering the name of the content creator, how long the video was, or even how to get to their other ventures like podcasts, their second YouTube channel, and more.\n\nSnap your followers out of their mindless scrolling and capture their attention when you add audio to pictures. This catches your viewers off-guard, as theyâre used to watching moving content. But, thereâs something refreshing about an image with audio. Itâs a pauseâ a breath of fresh air so we can stop and read your postâs caption, any text on your image, or immerse ourselves in the picture youâre showing us.\n\nCapture your followers and viewersâ attention by adding audio to an image or adding an image to an audio. Creating an Instagram story or reel with a still image and a song has become so popular, since we all love to share our music taste with others. But, what if Instagram doesnât have the song you want to use? What if you just had a podcast with a special guest and want to create a video podcast preview to share on Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn?\n\nKapwingâs online video editor provides you with a vast copyright-free library of music, sound effects, and other audio tracks for you to add to any picture. You can also upload your own audio and image, resize it perfectly for social media, and post directly to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok all in one place. You can also add music to image by uploading your picture and loading the song into Kapwing. Kapwing is purely browser-based, so you donât have to download an app or install hefty software. They support most media file types including MP3, MPEG, MP4, MOV, JPEG, PNG, and many more. Now, itâs time to turn your social media posts and videos into listening parties."
