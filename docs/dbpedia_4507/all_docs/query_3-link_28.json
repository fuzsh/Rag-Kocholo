        "text": "Hello,\n\nI’m controlling a Zeiss microscope with an AxioCam camera via M-M and struggle with the orientation of the camera image to be able to do tiling. The stage moves in the correct direction according to M-M coordinates, but the camera image is not correctly oriented. When I use e.g. slide explorer plugin, the image in each tile is flipped, so it doesn’t connect together well. I’ve tried the image transposition settings in Device property browsers (setting to either 1s or 0s), but orientation of the camera image doesn’t change. I’ve also tried image flipper in online processing- that works for the live image, but there’s no difference when I use slide explorer.\n\nAny suggestions what to try are welcome.\n\nThanks,\n\nRadek\n\nTry the pixel calibrator. The automated pixel calibration will generate an affine transform matrix that describes the spatial relation between the stage and camera. Regretfully, Slide explorer does not use that, but the much newer MicroMagellan plugin does. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes.\n\nThanks Nico, sounds like a good direction to probe.\n\nI see, I thought Slide Explorer would be a good tool to test the orientation, but from what you say it’s not. I’ve actually tried Micro Magellan first, but failed as it didn’t open the shutter when taking images, so got just random noise. I went to our other site today and tested Micro Magellan with a Leica microscope and it worked perfectly fine, so I’m sure I’m not using it in a wrong way. I’ll try again tomorrow with the Zeiss microscope.\n\nHi Radek,\n\nAlthough not related to your question, I’m wondering if you’d be able to share the .cfg file that you use to control AxioCam via MicroManager? I just got an AxioCam 820 and am trying to figure out how to get it to work with MM.\n\nBest regards,\n\nWojciech"
