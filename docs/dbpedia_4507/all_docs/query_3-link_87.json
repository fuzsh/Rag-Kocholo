        "meta_description": "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 covers a wide range of recommendations\n            for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content\n            more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations\n            for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech\n            disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation\n            for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user\n            need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of\n            web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines\n            will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.",

        "text": "abbreviation\n\nshortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the abbreviation has not become part of the language\n\nNote 1\n\nThis includes initialisms and acronyms where:\n\ninitialisms are shortened forms of a name or phrase made from the initial letters of words or syllables contained in that name or phrase\n\nNote 2\n\nNot defined in all languages.\n\nacronyms are abbreviated forms made from the initial letters or parts of other words (in a name or phrase) which may be pronounced as a word\n\nNote 3\n\nSome companies have adopted what used to be an initialism as their company name. In these cases, the new name of the company is the letters (for example, Ecma) and the word is no longer considered an abbreviation.\n\naccessibility supported\n\nsupported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents\n\nTo qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a Web content technology (or feature of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a Web content technology (or feature):\n\nThe way that the Web content technology is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT). This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users' assistive technology in the human language(s) of the content,\n\nAND\n\nThe Web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are available to users. This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:\n\nThe technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);\n\nOR\n\nThe technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility supported;\n\nOR\n\nThe content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization is also accessibility supported;\n\nOR\n\nThe user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are available for download or purchase in a way that:\n\ndoes not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability and\n\nis as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person without disabilities.\n\nNote 1\n\nThe Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive technologies there must be for a particular use of a Web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. (See Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for \"Accessibility Support\".)\n\nNote 2\n\nWeb technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long as they are not relied upon and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including Conformance Requirement 4 and Conformance Requirement 5.\n\nNote 3\n\nWhen a Web Technology is used in a way that is \"accessibility supported,\" it does not imply that the entire technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to meet WCAG requirements.\n\nNote 4\n\nWhen citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported should be specified.\n\nNote 5\n\nOne way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported. (See Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses.) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web content technologies above.\n\nalternative for time-based media\n\ndocument including correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and auditory information and providing a means for achieving the outcomes of any time-based interaction\n\nNote\n\nA screenplay used to create the synchronized media content would meet this definition only if it was corrected to accurately represent the final synchronized media after editing.\n\nambiguous to users in general\n\nthe purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the Web page presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities would not know what a link would do until they activated it)\n\nASCII art\n\npicture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII)\n\nassistive technology (as used in this document)\n\nhardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents\n\nNote 1\n\nFunctionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).\n\nNote 2\n\nAssistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.\n\nNote 3\n\nThe distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.\n\naudio\n\nthe technology of sound reproduction\n\nNote\n\nAudio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real world sounds, or both.\n\naudio description\n\nnarration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone\n\nNote 1\n\nAudio description of video provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content.\n\nNote 2\n\nIn standard audio description, narration is added during existing pauses in dialogue. (See also extended audio description.)\n\nNote 3\n\nWhere all of the video information is already provided in existing audio, no additional audio description is necessary.\n\nNote 4\n\nAlso called \"video description\" and \"descriptive narration.\"\n\naudio-only\n\na time-based presentation that contains only audio (no video and no interaction)\n\nblinking\n\nswitch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention\n\nNote\n\nSee also flash. It is possible for something to be large enough and blink brightly enough at the right frequency to be also classified as a flash.\n\nblocks of text\n\nmore than one sentence of text\n\nCAPTCHA\n\ninitialism for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\"\n\nNote 1\n\nCAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image or audio file.\n\nNote 2\n\nA Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer. It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\ncaptions\n\nsynchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content\n\nNote 1\n\nCaptions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location.\n\nNote 2\n\nClosed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.\n\nNote 3\n\nOpen Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions are visual equivalent images of text embedded in video.\n\nNote 4\n\nCaptions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.\n\nNote 5\n\nIn some countries, captions are called subtitles.\n\nNote 6\n\nAudio descriptions can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information that is already presented visually.\n\nchanges of context\n\nmajor changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneously\n\nChanges in context include changes of:\n\nuser agent;\n\nviewport;\n\nfocus;\n\ncontent that changes the meaning of the Web page\n\nNote\n\nA change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).\n\nCognitive function test\n\n[New]\n\nA task that requires the user to remember, manipulate, or transcribe information. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nmemorization, such as remembering a username, password, set of characters, images, or patterns. The common identifiers name, e-mail, and phone number are not considered cognitive function tests as they are personal to the user and consistent across Web sites;\n\ntranscription, such as typing in characters;\n\nuse of correct spelling;\n\nperformance of calculations;\n\nsolving of puzzles.\n\nconformance\n\nsatisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification\n\nconforming alternate version\n\nversion that\n\nconforms at the designated level, and\n\nprovides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language, and\n\nis as up to date as the non-conforming content, and\n\nfor which at least one of the following is true:\n\nthe conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an accessibility-supported mechanism, or\n\nthe non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or\n\nthe non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides a mechanism to reach the conforming version\n\nNote 1\n\nIn this definition, \"can only be reached\" means that there is some mechanism, such as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from \"reaching\" (loading) the non-conforming page unless the user had just come from the conforming version.\n\nNote 2\n\nThe alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages).\n\nNote 3\n\nIf multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are required for each language offered.\n\nNote 4\n\nAlternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would need to be fully conformant in order to meet conformance requirement 1.\n\nNote 5\n\nThe conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance, or even on the same Web site, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming version.\n\nNote 6\n\nAlternate versions should not be confused with supplementary content, which support the original page and enhance comprehension.\n\nNote 7\n\nSetting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set the preferences is accessibility supported.\n\nSee Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions\n\ncontent (Web content)\n\ninformation and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions\n\ncontext-sensitive help\n\nhelp text that provides information related to the function currently being performed\n\nNote\n\nClear labels can act as context-sensitive help.\n\ncontrast ratio\n\n(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where\n\nL1 is the relative luminance of the lighter of the colors, and\n\nL2 is the relative luminance of the darker of the colors.\n\nNote 1\n\nContrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).\n\nNote 2\n\nBecause authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.\n\nNote 3\n\nFor the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no background color is specified, then white is assumed.\n\nNote 4\n\nBackground color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text color is specified when a background color is specified.\n\nNote 5\n\nWhen there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.\n\nNote 6\n\nWCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except where caused by authors' code.\n\ncorrect reading sequence\n\nany sequence where words and paragraphs are presented in an order that does not change the meaning of the content\n\nCSS pixel\n\nvisual angle of about 0.0213 degrees\n\nA CSS pixel is the canonical unit of measure for all lengths and measurements in CSS. This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is set as closely as possible to the CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel [css3-values], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors).\n\ndown-event\n\nplatform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is depressed\n\nThe down-event may have different names on different platforms, such as \"touchstart\" or \"mousedown\".\n\ndragging movement\n\n[New]\n\nan operation where the pointer engages with an element on the down-event and the element (or a representation of its position) follows the pointer until an up-event\n\nNote\n\nExamples of draggable elements include list items, text elements, and images.\n\nemergency\n\na sudden, unexpected situation or occurrence that requires immediate action to preserve health, safety, or property\n\nencloses\n\n[New]\n\nsolidly bounds or surrounds\n\nessential\n\nif removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform\n\nextended audio description\n\naudio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the video so that there is time to add additional description\n\nNote\n\nThis technique is only used when the sense of the video would be lost without the additional audio description and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short.\n\nflash\n\na pair of opposing changes in relative luminance that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency range\n\nNote 1\n\nSee general flash and red flash thresholds for information about types of flash that are not allowed.\n\nNote 2\n\nSee also blinking.\n\nfocus indicator\n\n[New]\n\npixels that are changed to visually indicate when a user interface component is in a focused state\n\nfunctionality\n\nprocesses and outcomes achievable through user action\n\ngeneral flash and red flash thresholds\n\na flash or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content passes) if any of the following are true:\n\nthere are no more than three general flashes and / or no more than three red flashes within any one-second period; or\n\nthe combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10 degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance\n\nwhere:\n\nA general flash is defined as a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance (1.0) where the relative luminance of the darker image is below 0.80; and where \"a pair of opposing changes\" is an increase followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and\n\nA red flash is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red\n\nException: Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating checkerboard pattern with \"squares\" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.\n\nNote 1\n\nFor general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). This resolution of 75 - 85 ppi is known to be lower, and thus more conservative than the nominal CSS pixel resolution of 96 ppi in CSS specifications. Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.\n\nNote 2\n\nA transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists of two opposing transitions.\n\nNote 3\n\nThe new working definition in the field for \"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red\" (from WCAG 2.2) is a pair of opposing transitions where, one transition is either to or from a state with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or equal to 0.8, and the difference between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram. [ISO_9241-391]\n\nNote 4\n\nTools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However, no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).\n\nhuman language\n\nlanguage that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans\n\nNote\n\nSee also sign language.\n\nidiom\n\nphrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of the individual words and the specific words cannot be changed without losing the meaning\n\nNote\n\nIdioms cannot be translated directly, word for word, without losing their (cultural or language-dependent) meaning.\n\nimage of text\n\ntext that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve a particular visual effect\n\nNote\n\nThis does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content.\n\ninformative\n\nfor information purposes and not required for conformance\n\nNote\n\nContent required for conformance is referred to as \"normative.\"\n\ninput error\n\ninformation provided by the user that is not accepted\n\nNote\n\nThis includes:\n\nInformation that is required by the Web page but omitted by the user\n\nInformation that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or values\n\njargon\n\nwords used in a particular way by people in a particular field\n\nkeyboard interface\n\ninterface used by software to obtain keystroke input\n\nNote 1\n\nA keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the native technology does not contain a keyboard.\n\nNote 2\n\nOperation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface, not through its keyboard interface.\n\nkeyboard shortcut\n\nlabel\n\nlarge scale (text)\n\nwith at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts\n\nNote 1\n\nFonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower contrast levels.\n\nNote 2\n\nFont size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing that may be done by a user.\n\nNote 3\n\nThe actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined size and the user's display or user agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.\n\nNote 4\n\nWhen using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from the default sizes in a similar fashion.\n\nNote 5\n\nThe 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK languages, the \"equivalent\" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next larger standard large print size.\n\nlegal commitments\n\ntransactions where the person incurs a legally binding obligation or benefit\n\nlink purpose\n\nnature of the result obtained by activating a hyperlink\n\nlive\n\ninformation captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with no more than a broadcast delay\n\nNote 1\n\nA broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient to allow significant editing.\n\nNote 2\n\nIf information is completely computer generated, it is not live.\n\nlower secondary education level\n\nthe two or three year period of education that begins after completion of six years of school and ends nine years after the beginning of primary education\n\nNote\n\nThis definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education [UNESCO].\n\nmechanism\n\nprocess or technique for achieving a result\n\nNote 1\n\nThe mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be relied upon to be provided by either the platform or by user agents, including assistive technologies.\n\nNote 2\n\nThe mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.\n\nmedia alternative for text\n\nmedia that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives)\n\nNote\n\nA media alternative for text is provided for those who benefit from alternate representations of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language video), or audio-video.\n\nmotion animation\n\naddition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition\n\nminimum bounding box\n\n[New]\n\nthe smallest enclosing rectangle aligned to the horizontal axis within which all the points of a shape lie. For components which wrap onto multiple lines as part of a sentence or block of text (such as hypertext links), the bounding box is based on how the component would appear on a single line.\n\nname\n\ntext by which software can identify a component within Web content to the user\n\nNote 1\n\nThe name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a label is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.\n\nNote 2\n\nThis is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.\n\nnavigated sequentially\n\nnavigated in the order defined for advancing focus (from one element to the next) using a keyboard interface\n\nnon-text content\n\nany content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language\n\nNote\n\nThis includes ASCII Art (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which uses character substitution), and images representing text\n\nnormative\n\nrequired for conformance\n\nNote 1\n\nOne may conform in a variety of well-defined ways to this document.\n\nNote 2\n\nContent identified as \"informative\" or \"non-normative\" is never required for conformance.\n\non a full-screen window\n\non the most common sized desktop/laptop display with the viewport maximized\n\nNote\n\nSince people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation.\n\npaused\n\nstopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user\n\nperimeter\n\n[New]\n\ncontinuous line forming the boundary of a shape not including shared pixels, or the minimum bounding box, whichever is shortest.\n\npointer input\n\ninput from a device that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact\n\nNote\n\nSee the Pointer Events definition for \"pointer\" [pointerevents].\n\nprerecorded\n\ninformation that is not live\n\npresentation\n\nrendering of the content in a form to be perceived by users\n\nprimary education level\n\nsix year time period that begins between the ages of five and seven, possibly without any previous education\n\nNote\n\nThis definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education [UNESCO].\n\nprocess\n\nseries of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity\n\nprogrammatically determined (programmatically determinable)\n\ndetermined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities\n\nprogrammatically determined link context\n\nadditional information that can be programmatically determined from relationships with a link, combined with the link text, and presented to users in different modalities\n\nNote\n\nSince screen readers interpret punctuation, they can also provide the context from the current sentence, when the focus is on a link in that sentence.\n\nprogrammatically set\n\nset by software using methods that are supported by user agents, including assistive technologies\n\npure decoration\n\nserving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality\n\nNote\n\nText is only purely decorative if the words can be rearranged or substituted without changing their purpose.\n\nreal-time event\n\nevent that a) occurs at the same time as the viewing and b) is not completely generated by the content\n\nregion\n\nperceivable, programmatically determined section of content\n\nNote\n\nIn HTML, any area designated with a landmark role would be a region.\n\nrelationships\n\nmeaningful associations between distinct pieces of content\n\nrelative luminance\n\nthe relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white\n\nNote 1\n\nFor the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B where R, G and B are defined as:\n\nif RsRGB <= 0.04045 then R = RsRGB/12.92 else R = ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4\n\nif GsRGB <= 0.04045 then G = GsRGB/12.92 else G = ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4\n\nif BsRGB <= 0.04045 then B = BsRGB/12.92 else B = ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4\n\nand RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:\n\nRsRGB = R8bit/255\n\nGsRGB = G8bit/255\n\nBsRGB = B8bit/255\n\nThe \"^\" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from [SRGB].)\n\nNote 2\n\nBefore May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.\n\nNote 3\n\nAlmost all systems used today to view Web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content, authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3.\n\nNote 4\n\nIf dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and average B).\n\nNote 5\n\nTools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and flash.\n\nNote 6\n\nA separate page giving the relative luminance definition using MathML to display the formulas is available.\n\nrelied upon (technologies that are)\n\nthe content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported\n\nrole\n\ntext or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web content\n\nsame functionality\n\nsame result when used\n\nsame relative order\n\nsame position relative to other items\n\nNote\n\nItems are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into the reading order.\n\nsatisfies a success criterion\n\nthe success criterion does not evaluate to 'false' when applied to the page\n\nsection\n\na self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics or thoughts\n\nNote\n\nA section may consist of one or more paragraphs and include graphics, tables, lists and sub-sections.\n\nset of web pages\n\ncollection of web pages that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization\n\nNote\n\nDifferent language versions would be considered different sets of Web pages.\n\nsign language\n\na language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning\n\nsign language interpretation\n\ntranslation of one language, generally a spoken language, into a sign language\n\nNote\n\nTrue sign languages are independent languages that are unrelated to the spoken language(s) of the same country or region.\n\nsingle pointer\n\npointer input that operates with one point of contact with the screen, including single taps and clicks, double-taps and clicks, long presses, and path-based gestures\n\nspecific sensory experience\n\na sensory experience that is not purely decorative and does not primarily convey important information or perform a function\n\nstate\n\ndynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes\n\nStates do not affect the nature of the component, but represent data associated with the component or user interaction possibilities. Examples include focus, hover, select, press, check, visited/unvisited, and expand/collapse.\n\nstatus message\n\nchange in content that is not a change of context, and that provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a process, or on the existence of errors\n\nstructure\n\nThe way the parts of a Web page are organized in relation to each other; and\n\nThe way a collection of Web pages is organized\n\nstyle property\n\nproperty whose value determines the presentation (e.g. font, color, size, location, padding, volume, synthesized speech prosody) of content elements as they are rendered (e.g. onscreen, via loudspeaker, via braille display) by user agents\n\nStyle properties can have several origins:\n\nUser agent default styles: The default style property values applied in the absence of any author or user styles. Some web content technologies specify a default rendering, others do not;\n\nAuthor styles: Style property values that are set by the author as part of the content (e.g. in-line styles, author style sheets);\n\nUser styles: Style property values that are set by the user (e.g. via user agent interface settings, user style sheets)\n\nsupplemental content\n\nadditional content that illustrates or clarifies the primary content\n\nsynchronized media\n\naudio or video synchronized with another format for presenting information and/or with time-based interactive components, unless the media is a media alternative for text that is clearly labeled as such\n\ntarget\n\nregion of the display that will accept a pointer action, such as the interactive area of a user interface component\n\nNote\n\nIf two or more targets are overlapping, the overlapping area should not be included in the measurement of the target size, except when the overlapping targets perform the same action or open the same page.\n\ntechnology (Web content)\n\nmechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents\n\nNote 1\n\nAs used in these guidelines \"Web Technology\" and the word \"technology\" (when used alone) both refer to Web Content Technologies.\n\nNote 2\n\nWeb content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end-user experiences that range from static Web pages to synchronized media presentations to dynamic Web applications.\n\ntext\n\nsequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language\n\ntext alternative\n\nText that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.\n\nNote\n\nRefer to Understanding Text Alternatives for more information.\n\nup-event\n\nplatform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is released\n\nThe up-event may have different names on different platforms, such as \"touchend\" or \"mouseup\".\n\nused in an unusual or restricted way\n\nwords used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply in order to understand the content correctly\n\nuser agent\n\nany software that retrieves and presents Web content for users\n\nuser-controllable\n\ndata that is intended to be accessed by users\n\nNote\n\nThis does not refer to such things as Internet logs and search engine monitoring data.\n\nuser interface component\n\na part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function\n\nNote 1\n\nMultiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. \"Components\" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.\n\nNote 2\n\nUser interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.\n\nNote 3\n\nWhat is meant by \"component\" or \"user interface component\" here is also sometimes called \"user interface element\".\n\nuser inactivity\n\nany continuous period of time where no user actions occur\n\nThe method of tracking will be determined by the web site or application.\n\nvideo\n\nthe technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images\n\nNote\n\nVideo can be made up of animated or photographic images, or both.\n\nvideo-only\n\na time-based presentation that contains only video (no audio and no interaction)\n\nviewport\n\nobject in which the user agent presents content\n\nNote 1\n\nThe user agent presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts, menus, and alerts are not viewports.\n\nNote 2\n\nThis definition is based on User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary [UAAG10].\n\nvisually customized\n\nthe font, size, color, and background can be set\n\nWeb page\n\na non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent\n\nNote 1\n\nAlthough any \"other resources\" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.\n\nNote 2\n\nFor the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be \"non-embedded\" within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page."
