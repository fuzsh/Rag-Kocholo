        "text": "Question number 1: “Resolution matters? Should I upgrade from my X-T4?”\n\nOkay, this is where most of the noise lies around the X-T5 versus the previous models.\n\nThe X-T5 sports a new 40-megapixel CMOS sensor paired with the new X-Processor 5. This gives you faster readout times and the ability to process data much quicker than the X-T4 and X-T3's 26-megapixel sensor, as well as a faster Autofocus we will see in a few.\n\nSo, I’ve got a bunch of images here that I took with the X-T5 and X-T4 on the tripod and image stabilization turned off. Same settings. Same lens, the fuji 50-140. This should give us the detail we need to compare the resolution in both these cameras. These are all raw files straight out of the camera.\n\n- Update 13/12/2023 -\n\nMany people compare the two files by zooming in to 100%. However, this is not a fair comparison, especially when the images have different resolutions. For example, an XT-4 image has 26MP, while an X-T5 image has 40MP.\n\nAs you can see in the image below, if you zoom in to 100% on both images, the X-T5 image will look like it has less detail. This is because you are seeing a smaller fraction of the whole image. The X-T5 image actually has more detail (or possibly the same amount) as the XT-4 image, but you need to zoom out to see it.\n\nTo compare the detail of whole images, you should look at them at the same scale, not at 100% zoom. If you zoom in to 100% on a 26MP image, you are seeing about 7.7% of the image. If you zoom in to 100% on a 40MP image, you are seeing only 5.0% of the image.\n\nThis means you are seeing the 40MP image more closely, and therefore seeing more noise and less detail. Zooming in does not change the actual amount of noise and detail in the image, it just makes them more noticeable.\n\nAfter resizing the X-T5 file to match the resolution of the X-T4, there isn't any noticeable difference between the two. (see image below)\n\nHere on the left-hand side, we have the X-T5 version, and on the right, the same image captured with X-T4.\n\nThey both look super clean at the base ISO as expected. Both images look beautiful. Lovely details from corner to corner. The contrast and colors are absolutely great. Of course, the resolution bump of an extra 14 megapixels on the X-T5 provides a bit more fine details and a bit more latitude on cropping, but I must say the difference is not so huge.\n\nAs you can see, the edges are smoother and a tad more precise on the X-T5.\n\nQuestion number 2: “Noise concerns versus previous generation sensor?”\n\nThe X-T5 has a different ISO range than the previous two models, with a base ISO of 125 that goes up to 12.800, so we now have a bit more flexibility. (X-T4 & X-T3 base ISO of 160 up to 12.800)\n\nBefore making a comparison with the X-T4, let’s have a look at this shot.\n\nThere is a more noticeable difference when we jump to 1600. Definitely more grainy, but still very usable. So, that’s really good.\n\nWe can see a much bigger difference when we go up to 3200. I wouldn't say it's unusable but it's definitely starting to get closer to that point.\n\nAt 6400 the noise is much more pronounced. A noticeable increase can also be seen in purple color noise. We obviously reached the limit with the ISO value of 12800. As expected, the shot is extremely noisy. In my opinion, these last two values should only be used if absolutely necessary.\n\nLet’s go ahead. We’ll look at some comparison shots between the X-T5 and the X-T4, and let's jump up a few levels and look at ISO 1600 and higher.\n\nWe can really see that on the X-T5, we have more information on the snow and more details in other areas like these trees.\n\nThere seems to be a slight variation in the dynamic range between the X-T5 and the X-T4. Approximately half a stop. This is a nice improvement, although it is not a big one.\n\nQuestion number 4: “Can the older Fuji lenses make use of the high res sensor of the X-T5?”\n\nThis is the subject of another huge online debate. As an example, Fujifilm does not include the 10-24 in its list of lenses that can exploit the 40mp sensor to its full potential.\n\nI’m a 10-24 (first version) user, so I decided to try it myself and share my thoughts with you.\n\nTo be honest, I cannot tell any difference between the three shots. I'm at 100% zoom-in, and except for minimal differences on the focus point (that's why they don't look 100% identical), I can't detect any degradation of the image.\n\nI believe Lossless compression is a good compromise for keeping file sizes reasonable without compromising image quality. Even though the file is twice the size of the X-T4 lossless, we must keep in mind we are working with a 40-megapixel image.\n\nQuestion number 6: “How good or important is the ibis for handheld shots? Compared to an X-T3 without ibis.”\n\nExcept for the X-T3, both the X-T5 and X-T4 have in-body image stabilization. Compared to the X-T4, the X-T5 has a slightly higher rating of 7 stops of compensation. (measured with the XF 35mm F1.4, note that the rating can change depending on the lens used).\n\nThis difference is totally negligible to me. In other words, they both perform equally well.\n\nI took these shots with the X-T5 at different shutter speeds, and I had to change the aperture to get a longer shutter speed. The one at f/16 looks slightly softer because of that.\n\nThis last one is taken with the image stabilization turned off, and with a shutter speed of 1/60, and as you can see the shot is unusable. With the X-T3, I would need a faster shutter speed for the same focal length and lens. To play safe, for this specific example, I would say something about 1/400.\n\nIn low-light situations and when shooting at long focal lengths, the IBIS makes a huge difference.\n\nQuestion number 7: “If you have to make one choice which will you get between XT5 and your GFX (travel and pro)”\n\nHaving tried both systems, I can say that they both have their place. Currently, the X-T system meets all my requirements in terms of image quality, portability, usability, and video specs. With a wide range of high-quality lenses, the X-T5 and X-T4, as well as X-T3 are outstanding cameras. I think they do everything you need and more, unless you plan on printing giant wall murals that you can view from 3 ft away.\n\nAt the pixel level, GFX images are unbeatable. The detail is exceptional. The main advantage of the medium format is mostly just in resolution for larger prints and a wider dynamic range. But the drawbacks for size/speed/price/video features/lens lineup are quite drastic.\n\nTo give you an example of the differences in terms of resolution, here are a couple of shots taken with the GFX 50R and the X-T4.\n\nThis shows what an incredible amount of detail the medium format 50mp sensor can capture. I know, it’s not a fair comparison. But, as you can see, the result is quite different from a high-res image captured on an APS-C sensor. The image really shows more tiny details.\n\nGoing back to the original question, I would absolutely choose the X-T5 over the GFX.\n\nWhich model should you get?\n\nHere's a sort of framework that hopefully will help you decide what's best for you.\n\nOption 1 - X-T3\n\nIf you mostly shoot landscape photography on a tripod, and you use stabilized telephoto lenses, the in-body image stabilization is not a deal breaker. And if shooting videos is not your primary focus. Go with the X-T3. I guarantee you, it’s still an amazing camera all around, with the same image quality as the X-T4 with which you can easily make beautiful prints.\n\nIt’s weather-sealed. Pretty decent autofocus speed. Beautiful tilt screen similar to the X-T5 and the remote port is positioned properly to be used with an external cable release and doesn’t interfere with the L-bracket.\n\nSo, in my opinion, the X-T3 offers the best value for money. That’s why I’m still using it.\n\nOption 2 - X-T4\n\nWith the same photo specs as the X-T3, but with the addition of in-body image stabilization and an articulated LCD screen, the X-T4 is more suited for hybrid shooters who love shooting both stills and videos.\n\nThe IBIS is quite handy if you use very long focal lengths or not-stabilized lenses handheld. There is one caveat, as I mentioned before, the articulated screen is a pain in the butt to use with an L-bracket, and it’s less practical when shooting in portrait orientation, both on the tripod and handheld.\n\nIn conclusion, if you shoot both stills and videos and don't mind the articulated screen, the X-T4 is an excellent camera.\n\nOption 3 - X-T5\n\nIf you are a hybrid shooter, and you shoot not just landscapes but also a lot of moving objects, such as wildlife and sports photography, and you need a bit more room to crop your shots in post, then the X-T5 is probably your best choice.\n\nCompared to the X-T4, the resolution bump is not an absolute game-changer, but if you crop frequently, you'll appreciate the improvement.\n\nWhile I like the reintroduction of the 3-way tilt screen, the additional video features don't really make sense to me. Having better IBIS and AF performances when recording videos would have been much appreciated.\n\nSo, I would say, if you’re an existing Fuji user thinking of upgrading for the new sensor, I’d only do it if you were ALWAYS wanting to crop a little more, or if you weren’t satisfied with the maximum-sized prints you could make.\n\nBut if you’re happy with the quality you’re getting out of the X-Trans 4 sensors, this isn’t really as much of an impactful upgrade as you might think."
