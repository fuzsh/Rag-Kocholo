I found this really, really annoying on my iPad Air 2, because in landscape mode it was like single-channel audio.\n\nThe iPad Pro quad speaker setup solved this problem by providing two speakers on the bottom, and two speakers on the top.\n\nThe iPad Air 2020 specs only mention \"stereo speakers\" but the pics show quad speaker grills. I don't know if that means it's dual speakers with 4 grills or quad speakers, but the main point is now the Air has speakers on both the top and the bottom. That means in landscape mode it will be stereo. Finally.\n\niPad 2020:\n\niPad Air 2020:\n\nTo me, this is a big deal.

And once you notice it, the distraction gets worse.\n\nThe new Air speaker system is still a compromise compared to the Pro’s quad setup. Yes you get stereo in landscape, but you no longer get stereo in portrait like the older Airs had. Quad speakers is the only way you can get stereo in all orientations.\n\nNot at all saying this isn’t an improvement, as stereo is probably more important for most people in landscape. Just pointing out the differences between the Air’s speakers and the Pro."
