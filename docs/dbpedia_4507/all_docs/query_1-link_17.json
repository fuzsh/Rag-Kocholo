        "text": "3 Things You Should Know About Cover Art\n\nIn order to distribute music to digital stores and streaming services, you need a few things: audio files, metadata (album title, track titles, artist names, release date, etc.), etc.\n\nToday, we’re talking cover art: getting your artwork in the appropriate format so it flies through to digital store shelves.\n\nWhat Is Cover Art & Why It’s Important?\n\nProfessional cover art is the quickest and most time-honored way to make new fans. It makes your album stand out from the others competing for an audience's attention. It's a marketing gold mine, the skeleton key to unlocking engaging merchandise designs, social media posts, and themed music videos. If a third party creates your cover art, it can teach you how your songs affect new, open-minded listeners. Professional cover art is invaluable.\n\nAll that being true, you probably have many questions about what constitutes professional cover art. \"What should the size of an album cover be for streaming platforms?\" \"How many pixels should that album cover be?\" \"Should my cover art for YouTube be the same as for Apple Music, Spotify, and other platforms?\"\n\nLuckily, we have the answers.\n\nHow to Add Cover Art to Your Music\n\nIf you sell your music online through TuneCore (and we're biased but think you should be), you add cover art to your tracks at the beginning of the distribution process. You click \"Add Release\" and then click the \"Add Artwork\" tab after inputting other necessary fields to upload your cover.\n\nThese two steps are the easiest way to add cover art to your music. They ensure that your cover art accompanies your music on any streaming platform, from Spotify to YouTube Music.\n\nIf you're manually adding cover art to MP3 versions of your music, here are the three to nine steps you need to take.\n\nFor Mac:\n\nIn your Music player of choice (likely Apple Music), select the song you want to add artwork to\n\nClick “Song > Info,” and then click “Artwork”\n\nFrom there:\n\nClick ”Add Artwork” and select the image file of your choice\n\nDrag the image file of your choice to the “Add Artwork” area\n\nFor Windows:\n\nIn your Music player of choice (likely Windows Media Player),\n\nClick Library.\n\nSelect images.\n\nRight-click and Select Advanced Tag Editor.\n\nClick the Picture.\n\nClick Add.\n\nLocate the image to be used for Album art.\n\nClick Open.\n\nClick OK.\n\nDon’t Do It!\n\nWe’ve talked about the requirements for formatting the text in an album, single, or ringtone. Well, the same applies to artwork. There are specific rules the stores have that dictate what can and cannot be included in your artwork. For example, even a resolution or dimensions short of requirements could result in store rejection.\n\nHere’s what you CAN’T include:\n\nEmail addresses, URLs/websites, contact info (this includes social handles), or pricing\n\nStickers from your artwork from a scanned copy of the physical CD\n\nSomething that suggests the format of the release “CD, DVD, Digital Exclusive, the disc”\n\nCut off text or images\n\nAn image that’s compressed into one corner with white space\n\nNames of digital stores or their logos\n\nWords that express temporality, like “new,” “latest single,” “limited edition,” or “exclusive”\n\nAlso, this may sound like a given, but make sure the image isn’t blurry or pixelated (this can be adjusted via aspect ratio by the number of pixels your cover art is). No one, including TuneCore digital store partners, wants to have to squint to see your art. This is where the cover art size (minimum 1600×1600 pixels) is important. Keep in mind that stores and their cover art format requirements can vary. For example, to get your music on Spotify, your album cover must be in a 1500×1500 pixel format to get your music on Spotify.\n\nIf you include any of those things in the list above, the digital stores will likely reject your release, and it’s tough to generate sales when your music isn’t in stores!\n\nGame. Set. Match.\n\nIt’s really important that the text on your artwork matches your artist name and album title.\n\nSometimes, artists release a single from an upcoming album before the album's release. If you do this, you need to make sure the artwork for the single is specific to that single.\n\nHere’s what we mean:\n\nYou’re distributing a single, “I Can’t Remember, “ off your upcoming album, Amnesia. The artwork for your single MUST say “I Can’t Remember “ as the title, NOT “Amnesia,” even though it’s a single from the upcoming release.\n\nAlso, make sure that the artist's name on the artwork matches the artist's name in the release information. Adding extra artists to the cover art who aren’t actually performing on the release is not a good idea. For example, if you’re covering a song by John Lennon, his name can’t be on your artwork.\n\nYour artwork can include the song/album title or the artist’s name—it can even have no text.\n\nWhatever you do, just ensure there isn’t a mismatching situation."
