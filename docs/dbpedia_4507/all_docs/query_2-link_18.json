        "text": "Hi, I am very new to Lightworks, just loaded it last night and listen to various tutorial in youtube. I have started to edit my video taken using my Samsung Android Phone and realise that it is in portrait mode. I actually want it in landscape. I search in various article in this forum and come across using VFX to rotate it which is fine but when I export it to youtube, I see this landscape video with big black border all around it.\n\nI also read an article in this forum that the latest version has a function to auto-rotate but I can find that in mine (copy this from another article - 'Project.Video.Auto rotate videos'.). As I just download this software last night, I assume it is the latest version (I can't find how to find out the version number, apology).\n\nHope you can help. Thank you.\n\nModerator Update: with V2023.2 the free version allows the export in the portrait aspect ratio - briandrys\n\nIf you downloaded this software last night from this website what you have should be version 2021.1. You can verify this by checking the screen that appears immediately you launch Lightworks. At the bottom center of the screen you will see grey text that says \"Lightworks\" then a version number, a build number in brackets, and finally a date. Let us know what you see.\n\nHello,\n\nDisable the effect.\n\nIn the LOG tab, click on the Clips filter on the left side of the project content. Find your video and double click on it to open it in the right viewer.\n\nUnder the viewer in the Metadata tab, scroll down and select the desired setting in the \"Orientation\" line.\n\nThis setting will automatically be applied to all segments in all timelines based on this clip.\n\nDoes this solve your problem, or does it also give you black bars?\n\nI have demoted myself to a Free user for testing.\n\nCan the free version export portrait?\n\nNo, neither in the released, nor in the current beta. This is also officially announced in the meantime.\n\nhttps://www.lwks.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=289&Itemid=274\n\nSocial Media Custom Format Templates ‘Square’ and ‘Portrait’*\n\n[..]\n\n* This option is only available when exporting with an active Lightworks Pro license.\n\nBut available in the preview, or as a png image via keyboard command.\n\nYes, on the Sequence, I have removed the VFX rotation effect. I don't know whether it will look like that when I export to YouTube. I can't attached a screen capture here, sorry. I use 180 instead of \"Normal\" to make sure it is not upside down. The Viewer looks in the right orientation though while the Sequence view has two big black bar on the top and bottom of the picture. Sorry if I am not using the right terminology.\n\nI have demoted myself to a Free user for testing.\n\nCan the free version export portrait?\n\nNo, neither in the released, nor in the current beta.\n\nWhich is, from my point of view, not a good idea. I think, limiting Portrait export to 720x1280 and Square to 720x720 would have been sufficient with the Free version, instead of making in unavailable at all, but who am I to say that.\n\nFurthermore, with the Pro version, limiting Square to 720x720 and Portrait to 720x1080 when exporting is unacceptable. I can say that, because I pay for a license.\n\n.. there is still a small black bar at the top and bottom ..\n\nSounds like your original is a smaller format than 16/9 or 9/16.\n\nDo you want to share the YouTube link?\n\n.. but a lot more acceptable now..\n\nOK.\n\nIn theory, you could probably zoom in until the bars disappear, but then the other sides would be cropped.\n\nIf you want more, you can use the Pro license to export in aspect ratios other than 16/9 (and in resolutions higher than 720p). However, if YouTube users viewed your videos with a standard 16/9 monitor, they would see black bars in the full-screen view anyway.\n\nAny update on this feature?\n\nI see under Sequences > Playback format, Social Square. That has no visible effect when I change it. The word 'Social' is not in the User Guide, and 'square' is for some buttons. I exported the video and it is still in portrait mode.\n\nI imagine that if I want it to look like that I'd have to use 2D DVE, crop it to square, and scale to fit."
