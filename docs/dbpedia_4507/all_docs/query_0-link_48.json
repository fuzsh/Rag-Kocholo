        "text": "7 minutes read\n\nAs of May 2023, there are 1.6 billion Instagram users in the world. That’s one-fifth of the global population scrolling through hashtags, filters, stories, and Reels. Instagram is consistently ranked among the most popular social networks in the world, and, according to Hootsuite, it’s the 8th most visited website in the world.\n\nWith such great numbers to back it up, it only makes sense Instagram advertising is an attractive proposition for many. Two million advertisers flock to Instagram every month, and this platform can help them reach more than 22% of the global population.\n\nIf you want to tap into the power of Instagram and run social media ads there, learning about Instagram ad sizes is one of the first and most important steps for you.\n\nWhat are the best sizes for Instagram ads?\n\nWell, to help you avoid going down the rabbit hole, we brought together all Instagram ad sizes for 2024, so you can create Instagram ads that fit the platform 100%.\n\n1. Instagram Image Ads\n\nInstagram allows you to publish image ads in landscape, square, and vertical format.

The landscape format is more suitable for ads that require more space for content. Square and vertical formats are better suited for ads with a focus on visuals.\n\n2. Instagram Video Ads\n\nInstagram video ads and animations are very engaging and are perfect for those who want to get creative and tell the story behind their brand.

These can vary from country to country, so it’s essential to make sure your ads abide by the Meta/Instagram policies in all respects. Some of these rules include:\n\nNo images of people under 18\n\nNo references to alcohol brands or tobacco products\n\nNo profanity or hate speech\n\nNo false, misleading, or deceptive claims\n\nNo images of weapons or violence\n\nFurthermore, copy and caption-related specs should be kept in mind as well. For primary text, most types of Instagram ads will allow you to add up to 125 characters in captions and a maximum of 30 hashtags.\n\nConclusion\n\nInstagram ads can be a tremendous opportunity. As one of the biggest social media networks in the world and one of the largest sources of traffic for many businesses, Instagram has become a go-to platform for those who want to drive conversions and sales. By following the specs above, you can create highly effective Instagram ads to help you reach more people and boost your ROI.\n\nKeep in mind good ads are not just about Instagram ad dimensions and ad specifications. Your ad placement, copy, concept, and graphics bear a lot of weight when getting a good response from your audience. So make sure you put in the extra effort and think about how you can make your audience stop in their scroll and pay attention to what you have to say."
