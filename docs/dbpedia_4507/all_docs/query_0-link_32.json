There is a few ways this can be done. One way is to give each of the divs a vertical height:\n\ndiv1: 10vh (for the navbar)\n\ndiv2: 85vh (for the image)\n\ndiv3: 5vh (for the footer)\n\nThat will fill up exactly 100 vertical height on the page with the three divs.\n\nWhat is really helpful is if you can share your site link, so we can see how you have the elements setup: Share a read-only link | Webflow University\n\nThanks for the support @cyberdave\n\nOh, I had assumed from the Webflow UI that %, px and Auto were the only options.\n\nSo vh has helped me to get my divs as required. NavBar 5vh, Heading 5vh, Main 86vh, Footer 4vh.\n\nHowever now I’m wrangling with the image which is placed in a column.\n\nI want the image to occupy as much of the column width as possible, retain aspect ratio, and limited to the 86vh.\n\nI tried a variety of methods without success.\n\nYour continued and excellent support much appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.webflow.com/preview/test-heights?preview=e18c2a5c9a1592107f363e2a26ba7623\n\nHello @thewonglv\n\nThank you for you continued support.\n\nI’m really not sure how I can express this in simpler terms.\n\nYou see image 1 and 3 above ?\n\n1 Is a vertical image and 3 is horizontal.\n\n1, a vertical image, occupies 86vh with correct aspect ratio, Showing a circle, not an oval.\n\n3, a horizontal image, occupies 100% width of the central column with correct aspect ratio. Showing a circle, not an oval.\n\nHowever, I can only achieve that with 2 different classes. The class for 1 uses 86vh and the class for 3 uses 100% width.\n\nI would like to achieve the same results with a single class, so that no matter whether the image is vertical or horizontal I will achieve results 1 or 3 respectively.\n\nCan you think of a way that images, independent of vertical or horizontal aspect ratio can be displayed full height or width respectively in 1 class or other method of orientation relative code ?\n\nThe idea is to be able to display a slideshow of images in this way, displaying maximum height for vertical images and maximum width for horizontal images.\n\nI hope that explanation helps a little more.\n\nWhy not using a div that will be width and height 100% and just set a background for it? That would be the simpliest option I see here. Other than that you can’t resize in all directions an image and not expect it to stretch at some point. So a div that fits space entirely and background image with settings like cover, center would be sufficient."
