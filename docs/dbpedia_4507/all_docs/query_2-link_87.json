        "text": "Over the past three years Clair Brothers TrueFit Technology has evolved. Its genesis began as an idea to optimize frequency dispersion by customizing the horizontal waveguide to enhance directivity throughout an entire unique space using Clair Brothers kiTCurve C8 and C12 line arrays.\n\nNot every venue has the budget to install a 100% custom-tailored TrueFit system. Recognizing this compelled Clair Brothers to consider a ‘ready-fit’ product option specifically for small- to mid-sized venues that have certain overall geometric similarities: spaces where a kiTCurve-TrueFit system would offer a cost-saving alternative for budget-focused projects.\n\nAfter deploying kiTCurve-TrueFit systems in several custom projects, the engineering team identified a pattern of room-dimension commonalities. For myriad similarly-sized 200- to 500-seat venues, two prevalent room shapes include: one that is relatively shallow front-to-back, yet wide side-to-side, and another that is rather deep, but narrow.\n\nJosh Sadd, chief design engineer at Clair Brothers, explains it this way: “If you think of these two room geometries in terms of photography formats, a strong comparison would be ‘landscape’ and ‘portrait,’ where shallow and wide is ‘landscape’ and narrow and deep is ‘portrait.’ It’s all about capturing the horizontal plane angles within the dimensions of a given room.”\n\nClair Brothers is now offering the kiTCurve-TrueFit Landscape and kiTCurve-TrueFit Portrait models. These standardized TrueFit line array systems are an intermediate choice between the standard, 90-degree horizontal product and the fully customized TrueFit system. The kiTCurve-TrueFit Landscape | Portrait array products are solid options for venues on a watchful budget.\n\nSadd concludes, “For the price of a close-to-customized TrueFit system, a venue will be much nearer to having a custom-tailored sound than if they spend their budget on a standard curve system. Money is saved on engineering time. kiTCurve-TrueFit Landscape and Portrait models are a true fit all the way around.”"
