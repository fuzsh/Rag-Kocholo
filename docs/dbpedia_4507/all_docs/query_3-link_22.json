They are about layout and perceived routes.\n\nHow do you create mental images?\n\n1. Establish a reference point.\n\n2. Establish a set (frozen) body position at the reference point\n\n3. Localize (determine) auditory (and tactual) input in relationship to your body.\n\n4. Have a sighted friend (or a mobility specialist) \"paint\" a mental picture of objects in the room relative to your location\n\n5. Verbally describe the setting based on all the feedback\n\n6. To build a greater understanding of small spaces, exploration (going and coming from the reference point) is needed.\n\nWhat is vision like?"
