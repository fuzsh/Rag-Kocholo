        "text": "Ludwig Berger is a landscape sound artist, musician and educator based in Montreal and Zurich. In his compositions, installations and performances, he enables intimate and playful sonic encounters with plants, animals, buildings and geological entities. In his musical work, Berger produces sonic eco-fictions with processed and synthetic sounds. He studied electroacoustic composition at the University of Music Weimar and Musicology, Art History and Literature at the University of Eichstätt. He also holds a teaching certificate from the Center For Deep Listening. As a sound researcher and teacher at the Institute for Landscape Architecture at ETH Zurich from 2015-2022, Berger studied the sonic dimension of Japanese gardens, alpine glaciers and urban landscapes. He has composed sound and music for award-winning films and theatre pieces and curates the landscape sound festival Sonic Topologies and the experimental music label Vertical Music.\n\n\"Ludwig Berger is breaking the interspecies sound barrier\" (Electronic Sound)\n\n\"Ludwig Berger is leading the way with his field recording work in so many ways.” (Harry Sumner, Sonospace)\n\n\"A musique concrete magician” (Gray Lee, Houdini Maison)\n\n“The professor has a lot to teach, and brings a childlike wonder to his adult pursuits.” (R.
