Whether we are talking about the business page, or a personal profile, it is also the image that is displayed next to your name when you post or comment on Facebook. It is one of the most important visual elements of your Facebook presence.\n\nThe profile image epresents your personal or business brand on Facebook. It is the first thing that people see when they visit your profile or come across your posts. It helps you create a visual identity and recognition for you or your brand.\n\nA well-designed and visually appealing profile image can help to establish credibility, authority, and trust. It can also make your profile or posts stand out among others and attract more attention and engagement.\n\nProfile images look slightly different on business pages than they do on personal profiles, as some time ago Facebook shifted profile images on business pages to the left side of the screen. This way business pages stand out from personal profiles. However, the dimensions of profile images are the same for both business pages and individual profiles.\n\nImage guidelines:\n\nMinimum dimensions: 180×180 pixels\n\nMaximum dimensions: 2048×2048 pixels\n\nMinimum recommended dimensions: 761×761 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nNo matter what shape of image you upload, it will be cropped into a circle. So make sure that your image has no important information or elements outside of the rounded corners and that none of the important visualiz would get cut off.\n\nA 40×40 pixel photo thumbnail will appear next to your name on comments and posts.\n\nWhen clicking on a profile image, it can be displayed as large as 850×850 pixels.\n\nThe highest-resolution profile image that Facebook will store is 2048×2048 pixels.\n\nUncover in-depth insights\n\nAd Cost Calculator\n\nDownload now\n\nBonus for readers\n\nFacebook cover image\n\nBusiness page cover image\n\nNow, you need to find an ideal business page cover image. A Business page cover image on Facebook is the large banner-like image that appears at the top of a Facebook business page. The cover image provides an opportunity for businesses to showcase their identity, products, services, or key messages to their audience. It is the first thing visitors see when they visit a business page, making it an important tool for creating a positive first impression and capturing the attention of potential customers.\n\nFor example, you can display your brand's logo or a tagline. Promote special offers, new products, upcoming events, or seasonal campaigns. Additionally, you can use the cover image to convey your brand's personality, values, or unique selling points. The opportunities are endless, and it depends on the business's marketing objectives and target audience.\n\nThere are currently three options for cover images: single image, multiple images (that will be turned into a slideshow) and video. You can also add a 360-degree photo as your cover image.\n\nBefore designing a cover image, remember that it will display differently on desktop and mobile, so make sure to include all of the important elements within the mobile safe area so they don’t get cut off.\n\nSingle image business page cover image\n\nImage guidelines:\n\nMinimum dimensions: 399×150 pixels\n\nMaximum dimensions: 1958×745 pixels\n\nRecommended dimensions: 820×312 pixels(You can double the recommended size to maximize image quality and upload an image of 1640×624 pixels)\n\nMobile safe area: 640×312 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 2.63:1\n\nSlideshow business page cover image\n\nImage guidelines:\n\nMinimum dimensions: 399×150 pixels\n\nMaximum dimensions: 1958×745 pixels\n\nRecommended dimensions: 820×312 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 2.63:1\n\nYou can select up to five images that will rotate as a slideshow\n\nVideo business page cover\n\nVideo guidelines:\n\nMinimum dimensions: 820×312 pixels\n\nRecommended dimensions: 820×462 pixels\n\nVideo length: 20–90 seconds\n\nFile size: less than 1.75 GB\n\nPersonal profile cover image\n\nThe personal profile cover image in Facebook ads is the large banner-like image that appears at the top of a Facebook user's personal profile page.

By choosing a cover image that aligns with their values and interests, they can establish a strong online presence and make a memorable first impression on the viewers.\n\nIt is important to consider a few key factors here:\n\nFirst, ensure that the image is relevant to your and the content you publish.

Shared images can be photos, graphics, or illustrations that are relevant to your purpose or the message you want to spread.\n\nYou can promote products or services, events like webinars or gatherings, discounts, share behind-the-scenes moments, or simply engage and empathize with your audience on a more personal level. Facebook shared images can also be used to drive traffic to your blog by including a link in the image description or caption.\n\nAlways experiment with different types of images, such as infographics, quotes, or behind-the-scenes photos, to see what resonates best with your audience, and here is the list of some of the most important best practices:\n\nUse descriptive captions to provide more context.\n\nConsider adding relevant hashtags to increase discoverability.\n\nTag people or pages in the image to expand its reach.\n\nFinally, monitor the performance of your shared images using Facebook Insights or other analytics tools to gain insights and make improvements for your future posts.\n\nFacebook lets you upload one or more images to a post. It’s pretty straightforward with single image posts, however difficulties start when you want to upload multiple images with different aspect ratios. Then the way they’ll be displayed in the post will largely depend on what aspect ratio your first image is and also on how many images there are in total.\n\nSingle image\n\nImage guidelines:\n\nRecommended dimensions: 1,200×630 pixels\n\nMaximum image height: 2048 pixels\n\nMaximum image width: 2048 pixels\n\nImages will appear in the feed at a maximum width of 470 pixels (will scale to a maximum of 1:1).\n\nImages will appear on the page at a maximum width of 504 pixels (will scale to a maximum of 1:1).\n\nNo matter what type of image you’re sharing (landscape, portrait, or square), Facebook will resize it to 500 pixels wide and scale the height accordingly.\n\nMultiple images\n\nMultiple square images\n\nImages will be displayed differently based on how many you upload.\n\nOne square: 492×492 pixels\n\nTwo squares: 245×246 pixels\n\nThree squares: 492×245 pixels (top), 245×245 pixels (bottom two)\n\nFour squares: 245×245 pixels (all)\n\nFive squares: 245×245 pixels (top two), 163×163 pixels (bottom left and right), 162×163 pixels (bottom middle)\n\nSix squares: same as for five square, but the bottom right photo has an overlay displaying the number of photos not shown\n\nFor everything over six images, the layout is exactly the same as for six\n\nMultiple portrait images\n\nHere again the images will be displayed differently based on how many you upload.\n\nOne portrait: 492×738 pixels\n\nTwo portrait: 245×492 pixels\n\nThree portrait: 327×492 pixels (left), 163×245 pixels (right top and bottom)\n\nFour portrait: 327×492 pixels (left), 163×163 pixels (right top and bottom), 163×162 pixels (right middle)\n\nFive portrait: 245×245 pixels (top two), 163×163 pixels (bottom left and right), 162×163 pixels (bottom middle)\n\nSix portrait: same as five, but the bottom right photo has an overlay displaying the number of photos not shown\n\nFor everything over six images, the layout is exactly the same as for six\n\nMultiple landscape images\n\nThe situation is similar when uploading landscape images, and again the way they’ll look depends on how many there are.\n\nOne landscape: 492×276 pixels\n\nTwo landscape: 492×245 pixels\n\nThree landscape: 492×327 pixels (top), 245×163 pixels (bottom left and right)\n\nFour landscape: 492×327 pixels (top), 163×163 pixels (bottom left and right), 162×163 pixels (bottom middle)\n\nFive landscape: 245×245 pixels (top left and bottom left), 245×163 pixels (top right and bottom right), 145×162 pixels (middle right)\n\nSix landscape: same as five, but the bottom right photo has an overlay displaying the number of photos not shown\n\nFor everything over six images, the layout is exactly the same as for six\n\nImages with multiple orientations\n\nIf you’re uploading images that all have different sizes and orientations, the layout will be based on the first image.\n\nUncover in-depth insights\n\nAd Cost Calculator\n\nDownload now\n\nBonus for readers\n\nFacebook shared video\n\nYou can share or upload any type of video content, such as a personal video, a promotional video, or a video advertisement. When you share a video on Facebook, it appears in the news feed of your friends or followers, allowing them to view, like, comment, and share the video.\n\nFacebook users typically share personal videos to showcase their experiences, such as travel videos, event highlights, or memorable moments.\n\nBusinesses use shared videos to demonstrate how-to guides, promote their products or services, or provide behind-the-scenes glimpses. Additionally, organizations and influencers can leverage shared videos to raise awareness about social causes, share educational content, or just have fun their audience.\n\nHere is the list of a few best practices to follow:\n\n1. Keep your videos engaging, as attention spans on social media are often short. Aim for videos that are between 15 to 60 seconds in length, unless you have a compelling storytelling type of content.\n\n2. Optimize your videos for mobile viewing, as the majority of Facebook users access the platform through their mobile devices.\n\n3. Use captions or subtitles to make video more accessible to viewers who watch without sound.\n\n4. Promote your videos by sharing them across relevant Facebook groups, pages, or communities to reach a wider audience and increase engagement.\n\n5.

When a user clicks on a shared link, they are directed to the website associated with that link. Shared links are commonly used to promote articles, blog posts, products, events, and other types of content on Facebook.\n\nBrands often use shared links to drive traffic to their websites, share blog posts or news articles, promote new products or services, and generate leads, conversions, and sales. Here are a few tips:\n\nInclude an eye-catching image thumbnail that is relevant to the content being shared. This helps attract attention and entices users to click on the link.\n\nWrite a compelling and concise title and description that accurately represents the content of the link.\n\nWhen you share a link on Facebook, you can use a custom thumbnail image for it. You can use both rectangular and square images. It’s longer possible to upload your own thumbnail image for all links, however. You can only do this for links from your own site. To set a custom thumbnail, you’ll need to set the «og:image» property on the page’s Open Graph metadata.

You also aren’t allowed to use images that have text on them (like calls to action or promo codes), images that can be regarded as advertising or promotional material, images that include watermarks, or images that have time-sensitive information (like limited-time price drops).\n\nImage guidelines:\n\nMinimum dimensions: 1024×1024 pixels\n\nAll images should be square.\n\nYou need to have at least one image for each product.\n\nThese are pretty much all of the image sizes you’ll need when promoting your page on Facebook.\n\nRemember that Facebook loves updating the platform and introducing new features, so make sure you check regularly for updates about any changes in these image sizes.\n\nAnd while you’re preparing your page for promotion, don’t forget about a few more important things that will help you check the efficiency of your advertising:\n\nUse split tests — also known as A/B tests — to determine which ad strategies perform best and optimize your future campaigns.\n\nAssign conversion credit to marketing touchpoints along the customer journey, on and off Facebook, to understand which of your ads are getting the right results.\n\nTrack basic Facebook advertising KPIs.
