        "text": "I attached some images this morning and from some reason most rotated from portrait to landscape when adding via RM8’s Drop New Media window. This was on my laptop.\n\nThe images in the media folder are in the right orientation and when dragged into the Drop New Media window dropped in they are in the correct orientation. When they then appear in the person’s media window the image is sideways.\n\nIn parallel I added the same media at the same time on my iMac using the Leister Reunion App. No problems there.\n\nAnyone have any idea of what went wrong? Is there a way to fix this.\n\nI suspect that the images really are rotated if you just look at the pixels. I further suspect that there is metadata stored with the image that describes the orientation so that image software can rotate automatically to correct for the initial camera orientation. If you are seeing the images outside of RM with software that makes such automatic corrections, you may not realize that the images are really rotated.\n\nSome image software supports the orientation metadata and rotates automatically. Some image software does not. I don’t know if RM8’s image viewer process the metadata for the orientation or not, but it sounds like it does not. If not, then you would need to use some sort of image editor from outside of RM to rotate the images. It would probably be helpful to get input from the RM HelpDesk on this issue before embarking on a massive project to rotate all your images.\n\nHere is some further technical detail. JPG files can have metadata called EXIF data and IPTC data. If a JPG file does have orientation metadata, it will be stored in the EXIF data and it will be called the EXIF Orientation Tag. The Orientation Tag can have one of 8 different values, so it’s more than just rotated or not. It can be rotated by 0 degrees (unrotated), 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees (same as -90 degrees). Any of the four rotations can also be mirror imaged or not, which gets you to 8 different values for the EXIF Orientation Tag.\n\nI use Irfanview as my primary image viewer. It is widely used and is free. From inside Irfanview, you can see the EXIF data by clicking Image => Information => EXIF Info. Not all JPG files have the EXIF Info. If not, the EXIF Info button will not appear. And not all EXIF metadata includes all the same data fields. If the EXIF Orientation Tag exists, Irfanview will display it as Orientation. If it is not rotated and not mirrored, Irfanview will say Top Left rather than Not Rotated or 0 Degrees or anything like that. If it says anything else other than Top Left, then the image is either rotated or mirrored or both.\n\nIf there is no EXIF metadata, or if there is EXIF metadata and no EXIF Orientation Tag, then the JPG is what it is. There will be no automatic rotation and every image software should display it the same way. If it’s rotated, then every image software will show it as rotated and you will never be fooled.\n\nI maintain copies of my genealogy data in RM7, RM8, Legacy 9, FTM2017, FTM 2019 and Family Historian 7. I use Irfanview and Paintshop Pro to tweak and edit various images, many of which are used by the aforementioned genealogy programs. Some of the images are being used in Microsoft Publisher and other projects of that ilk.\n\nI will probably move the FTM Projects along to FTM2019 in the near future and assuming that I do, that means I would need to maintain no less than 5 media folders just for genealogical purposes and of that media, probably 80% of it is in use by all of the genealogy programs. That is a lot of duplication of media. I have thousands of images that need some tweaking, downloaded census images that need to be sharpened, images records from courthouse visits that need to be trimmed, images of newspaper pages that were downloaded whole and which I need to trim down to the specific obit or article…That means quite often when I work with an image, I would need to copy it all of those media folders. This way, I change the image once, and assuming I don’t rename the file or move it, it will be changed for all uses.\n\nI also never make database backups with images in the programs that allow it. I simply backup the media folder at least once a day and backup the database on an as needed basis.\n\nThis has mostly been my workflow for the better part of the last 20 years. Haven’t had a catastrophe yet.\n\nBottom right for the orientation flag means that there is a virtual rotation of 180 degrees. It’s a very quaint and odd way that JPG files say that they have a virtual rotation of 180 degrees, but that’s the way it works.\n\nWhen there is no virtual rotation, the top left corner is displayed in the top left. When there is a 90 degree clockwise virtual rotation, the top left corner is displayed in the top right. When there is a 180 degree clockwise virtual rotation, the top left corner is displayed in the bottom right. When there is a 270 degree clockwise virtual rotation, the top left corner is displayed in the bottom left. And that’s the way the orientation flag is described.\n\nI sometimes think this way of describing the virtual rotations is not just quaint but is awkward, and I wish the rotation flag would just say 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees. I suspect that the orientation flag is displayed the way it is because the flag actually has eight different values rather than just four. The other four values are the result of the fact that an image can also be virtually reflected in addition to being virtually rotated, like a mirror image reflection.\n\nI don’t think Irfanview has a way to turn off or change the orientation flag. I think it can only display the flag. What you need is a tool that will turn off all the orientation flags in bulk - for every JPG file in a given folder. Such tools exist, but I have no experience with them. Even after running such a tool, there may remain some JPG files that have actual rotations you need to get rid of rather than virtual rotations specified by the orientation flag. You can fix these one file at a time by rotating the file with an image viewer and resaving the file. The trouble with this approach is that saving a JPG file is a lossy operation and will degrade the quality of your images slightly. What you need is a tool that will do what is called a lossless rotation of a JPG file. Again, such tools exist but I have no experience with any of them.\n\nSo, does all this mean that RM8 will not allow editing of an added media item to rotate it to the view it should be? RM7 does this so why doesn’t (apparently) RM8 or have I missed something? Vital records in the UK are landscape but they scan as portrait on an A4 paper size scanner. When saved into Pictures in Windows 10 I rotate them to landscape and that’s how they are filed. When put in to Roots they go in as originally scanned as portrait (presumably) for the reasons mention above. If these cannot be rotated in RM8 then RM8 is no good to me at all; back to RM7. Is this the end result?\n\nIs it correct that media items can only be added by drag & drop?\n\nThanks for any help/comment or otherwise that would assist me."
