        "text": "This content is also available in: Español (Spanish)\n\nOrientation and Mobility (O&M) is a profession specific to blindness and low vision that teaches safe, efficient, and effective travel skills to people of all ages:\n\n“Orientation” refers to knowing where you are and where you want to go, whether you’re moving from one room to another or walking downtown for a shopping trip.\n\n“Mobility” refers to the ability to move safely, efficiently, and effectively from one place to another, such as walking without tripping or falling, crossing streets, and using public transportation.\n\nOrientation and Mobility Specialists\n\nAn Orientation and Mobility (O&M) Specialist provides instruction to help you develop or re-learn the skills and concepts needed to travel safely and independently within your home and the community. O&M Specialists provide services across the lifespan, teaching infants and children in pre-school and school programs and adults in various community-based and rehabilitation settings.\n\nThe Academy for Certification of Vision Rehabilitation and Education Professionals (ACVREP) offers certification for vision rehabilitation professionals, including O&M Specialists. A Certified Orientation and Mobility Specialist (COMS) must adhere to a professional Code of Ethics and demonstrate knowledge and teaching skills in the following areas:\n\nSensory development, or maximizing all of your senses to help you know where you are and where you want to go\n\nUsing your senses in combination with self-protective techniques and human guide techniques to move safely through indoor and outdoor environments\n\nUsing a cane and other devices to walk safely and efficiently\n\nSoliciting and/or declining assistance\n\nFinding destinations with strategies that include following directions and using landmarks and compass directions\n\nTechniques for crossing streets, such as analyzing and identifying intersections and traffic patterns\n\nProblem-solving skills to determine what to do if you are disoriented or lost or need to change your route\n\nUsing public transportation and transit systems.\n\nO & M Instruction\n\nO&M instruction is usually conducted on a one-to-one basis. It can take place either in the community where you live and/or work (called “itinerant O&M”) or at a rehabilitation center (called “center-based O&M”).\n\nTo locate an Orientation and Mobility Specialist in your home area, our Directory of Services includes information about Orientation and Mobility instruction.\n\nThe Different Types of Canes\n\nTwo types of canes are most commonly used:\n\nLong white canes come in two categories: folding canes and straight-style. Folding canes, which can be collapsed and stored easily, come in aluminum or graphite models. Graphite canes are lighter and easier to fold and unfold than aluminum ones. While great for travel, folding canes tend to be less sturdy when compared to straight (non-folding) canes and don’t provide the same amount of sensory feedback.\n\nA popular straight-style cane is made of fiberglass, which is ultra-light, provides lots of sensory feedback, and bends slightly if it slides under a car or similar obstacle.\n\nA Support Cane Should:\n\nBe strong enough to support your weight. This usually means that a support cane is not lightweight.\n\nBe short enough to rest your hand on top while you hold it close to your body.\n\nHave a tip that grips the floor and does not slide.\n\nA Probing Cane (“White Cane” or “Long Cane”) Should:\n\nBe lightweight to hold and move it in front of you without becoming tired.\n\nBe long enough to reach ahead and warn you about obstacles and stairs.\n\nHave a tip that can slide easily along the ground.\n\nA support cane and a probing cane are designed differently and serve very different purposes, so the choice of which cane to use will depend on your needs:\n\nIf you need a cane to help you know what is on the ground in front of you, it is recommended that you use a probing cane.\n\nPlease note: If you use a support cane to probe the ground ahead, it is usually impossible to reach far enough ahead without leaning forward. This harms your posture and appearance and is risky, particularly when approaching descending stairs. If you miss your footing or lose your balance while leaning forward, you will likely fall forward and tumble down the stairs.\n\nYou will need two canes if you can’t see well enough to know what is on the ground in front of you and need a cane for support.\n\nOne cane will provide the support you need, and the other will probe ahead to scan for obstacles, stairs, and curbs.\n\nIt may seem awkward and difficult to use two canes, but with effective orientation and mobility (O&M) instruction, people of all ages have learned to use two canes correctly and safely.\n\nCane Tips\n\nA wide variety of cane tips now provide smoother operation and more durability. Each tip has its pros and cons.\n\nCan I use a Cane if I also use a wheelchair?\n\nYou can use a wheelchair and learn how to use a long cane to help navigate obstacles and drop-offs. However, success depends on individual circumstances, such as your type and level of vision, overall physical limitations, and chair style. Consult your O&M specialist about whether using a long cane with a wheelchair is right for you.\n\nAlternative mobility devices (AMDs)\n\nAlternative mobility devices have been developed that provide full protection for people who cannot use the cane reliably or move it correctly, either because of physical limitations (including difficulty or pain when moving the wrist) or cognitive disabilities.\n\nTranscript of Video\n\nNARRATOR 1: A man using a cane climbs steps at a shopping center.\n\nNARRATOR 2: For those experiencing vision loss, the world may seem like one big locked door. It can be frustrating getting around both in and out of the house. Working with a trained orientation and mobility specialist can be the key to reentering the world. These trained professionals teach independent travel skills which are always geared towards a person’s individual needs. There are techniques for working with or being a sighted guide, walking with a cane, methods to taking advantage of public transportation and self-protective techniques when entering a new environment. Walking through a doorway, for example, can present hazards not experienced by those who are sighted. Notice how this man with low vision holds his arm out away from his body like a shield, while a person who uses a cane has a very different, but equally safe, approach.\n\nNARRATOR 1: A man wearing a cowboy hat crosses the street while using a cane.\n\nNARRATOR 2: Here’s an example of someone listening to the direction of traffic before he crosses the street.\n\nNARRATOR 1: Another man approaches a busy crosswalk.\n\nNARRATOR 2: Orientation and mobility specialists also teach people how to use sound cues and their remaining vision to travel around safely and efficiently.\n\nNARRATOR 1: The man presses the button for the traffic signal."
