Here are the general Shopify image size recommendations:\n\nMaximum image size: 4472 x 4472 pixels\n\nRecommended square image size: 2048 x 2048 pixels\n\nImage file size: up to 20 MB\n\nImage resolution: 72 dpi\n\nAnd here is an overview of the most commonly used Shopify image sizes for specific image types:\n\nImage type\n\nWidth x Height (pixels)\n\nImage type\n\nWidth x Height (pixels)\n\nProduct images\n\n2048 x 2048\n\nNewsletter section image\n\n1600 x 300\n\nCollection images\n\n1024 x 1024\n\nFeatured promotions\n\n840 x 840\n\nSlideshow banner images\n\n1600 x 500\n\nNewsletter popup image\n\n425 x 575\n\nShopify background image\n\n1920 x 1080\n\nGallery\n\n800 x 800\n\nImage with text overlay - Banner images, Blog featured image, Full shop background image\n\n1800 x 1000\n\nMega menu images\n\n360 x 360\n\nBlog page top banner, Contact page top banner\n\n1800 x 1000\n\nFavicon\n\n32 x 32\n\nShopify logo\n\nUp to 450 x 250\n\nCheckout page top banner\n\n1800 x 300\n\nVideo placeholder image\n\n1600 x 900\n\nPassword page background image\n\n1600 x 1000\n\nNow, let's review the main image size recommendations in detail\n\nProduct image size\n\nShopify product image size can be 20 megapixels or up to 4472 x 4472 px. The file size should not exceed 20 MB. For square images, Shopify recommends a 2048 x 2048 px size.\n\nMake sure you maintain a similar aspect ratio for all product images to ensure consistency and structure. The best ratio options are 1:1 (square) or 3:1 (rectangular).\n\nTinyIMG can automate image resizing and compression - all you need to do is upload the photos\n\nStart image optimization with TinyIMG\n\nCollection image size\n\nShopify collection image size can be up to 4472 x 4472 px. The file size shouldn’t exceed 20 MB.\n\nMake sure that your collection images are always square (same width and height) and the same or similar size. Having the same dimension and ratio images makes your site look more structured.\n\nAs for the Shopify collection header image, the size is usually 1600 x 1600 px. However, it can vary depending on your chosen theme.\n\nA Shopify collection header image size is ususally 1600 x 600 pixes, but might vary depending on the theme.\n\nBanner image size\n\nMost Shopify professionals suggest 2048 x 2048 px as the best Shopify banner image size. However, banner size requirements can vary based on your site’s theme. Choosing the right dimensions will help your image have the most impact across all browsers and devices.\n\nThe height of the banner will determine how much screen it covers. A banner with 600 pixels in height will take up pretty much all of the above-the-fold space the website visitors see upon entering. Meanwhile, a 400-pixel height will leave some room for other elements of the page.\n\nAnother way of thinking about Shopify banner image size is in aspect ratio. The best aspect ratio for hero or banner images is 16:9, which means they should be landscape. The first number suggests how wide your image should be, and the second one refers to its height.\n\nAnother way of thinking about Shopify banner image size is in aspect ratio.

The best size for this type of image is 1600 x 500 pixels. However, dimensions between 1200-2000 x 400-600 px are also good.\n\nThe precise aspect ratio will determine how much above-the-fold space there is for other elements of the page.\n\nMobile and desktop devices will crop slideshow images differently, so make sure:\n\nThe subject of your shots is centered\n\nThe details of your image are large enough to see on mobile\n\nThe slideshow images are optimized for page speed\n\nThe more similar your images are, the better the overall design will be. Align all your slide pictures in size or at least ratio.\n\nEach theme can also have special recommendations on what image sizes it suggests for the best look. Check out the information available, and see what they say. Developers know what works for sure, so it’s a good guide to follow.\n\nLogo image size\n\nThe best Shopify logo image size is a square image of 200 x 200 pixels. This is much smaller than Shopify’s 450 x 250 px limit and ensures the logo doesn’t become distorted anywhere on the website. Plus, logo file sizes that are too large can adversely impact page loading time.\n\nA square logo with a 1:1 ratio is a safe choice that works with all themes, everywhere on the page.\n\nJust like with other images, logo size can also depend on your Shopify store theme. For example, the Turbo Shopify theme suggests using a 400 x 100 px logo image for the main menu, 100 x 50 px for mobile, and 250 x 200 px for the footer.\n\nSo, we recommend checking the theme’s documentation to see what size to choose.\n\nImage with text overlay size\n\nThe recommended size for images with text overlay, like background, featured blog, or even some banner images, is around 1800 x 1000 px (9:5 ratio).\n\nHowever, the size of images with text overlay highly depends on your chosen theme and specific image type, so make sure to refer to the theme recommendations.\n\nBlog image size\n\nThe best Shopify blog image size is 1800 x 1000 pixels (9:5 ratio). For pictures within the content, it’s recommended to go for 1000 x 350 px.\n\nSame as with other Shopify images, the size of a featured blog image cannot exceed 4472 x 4472 px and 20 MB in file size, or the platform will downsize it for you.\n\nShopify background image size\n\nThe recommended Shopify background image size is 1920 x 1080 pixels (16:9 ratio). This is a safe option that ensures your background works on any device. Plus, the size of your files shouldn’t exceed 3 MB to avoid performance issues.\n\nThe Shopify image size limits still apply, so you can’t exceed 4472 x 4472 px. Remember, smaller images load faster. To reduce file size on your hefty background images, use an image optimization app such as TinyIMG for automatic size compressions.\n\nKeep in mind that background image sizes will differ depending on a theme. Therefore, it’s always a good idea to see what sizes are recommended by the developers.\n\nWe've reviewed some of the main images for your Shopify store, but don't leave the small ones without attention.

Check out our guide on image sizes for some popular Shopify themes to get the best idea of what visuals to prepare.\n\nWhy should you focus on image sizes for your Shopify store?\n\nYou’ve spent hours perfecting your product pictures and they look incredible. But what if your customers see overstretched or strangely cropped photos? Even worse - what if the customers leave the page before even seeing those photos because your website loads super slowly?\n\nPaying sufficient attention to Shopify image sizes gives you these benefits:\n\nEnhances user experience.

It indicates to the search engine that your website has what online shoppers are looking for, helping you rank higher.\n\nYou can achieve all that quite easily if you follow the best Shopify image optimization practices and use the correct Shopify image sizes.\n\nWhy are default Shopify theme images not good enough?\n\nA number of brands start their online store using a popular or free Shopify theme. Now while these themes are editable, they come with some pre-existing images in certain sizes that the developer at the moment felt did justice to the design.\n\nMost themes come with a default image ratio of 1:2. But that does not mean you edit your product images to fit their size and ratio. That should completely be based on the products you’re selling and what ratio best helps you bring it to the forefront in an image.\n\nAs a golden rule, follow the best Shopify image sizes to offer an enticing browsing experience to your store visitors. But don’t ever go reverse, compromising on your images to fit into a theme you bought.\n\nYou can also make use of some of the best Shopify apps like TinyIMG to help you optimize the images for the theme’s best performance.\n\nNow that you know all about the recommended Shopify image sizes, let's move on to the next step. The image formats.\n\nBest image formats for Shopify\n\nTake a look at the most commonly used image file formats in Shopify stores and why they’re popular:\n\nJPG/ JPEG - one of the most commonly used image file formats thanks to its small file size and good color range. Easy compression also lets you reduce the file size, but still strike a balance between image quality and file size. JPG is the recommended image format for Shopify product photos.\n\nPNG - a great choice for logos and graphics, letting you retain good image quality on various file sizes. It also supports transparency, giving store owners more freedom to make custom designs. The only downside of this image format is that the file sizes of complex images can be very large because of the lossless compression.\n\nGIF - the most popular format to add animated images that will be universally recognized by all browsers. Shopify image format makes the initially massive GIFs smaller by compressing and reducing product images to 256 colors only.\n\nShopify accepts a number of other image formats, like TIFF or HEIC, but they are not widely used. Also, to ensure better page speed, Shopify serves WebP images in browsers supporting this format\n\nKeep all your Shopify images compressed and SEO-optimized with TinyIMG!\n\nInstall TinyIMG now\n\nShopify image types to include\n\nThere are a few most commonly used types of Shopify images that are an essential part of any store.
