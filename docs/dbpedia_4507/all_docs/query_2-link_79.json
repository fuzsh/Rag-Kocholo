She turned the screen to view in landscape and when she returned it to portrait, the bottom part of the screen was missing. This meant tabs without descriptors and addresses missing from map details. Any ideas? No problems on my XR.\n\nSounds like a device operating system issue. Did you do any Google searching to see if other apps are experiencing this kind of behavior?\n\nDid you try closing the app and reopening it? Did that fix the issue?\n\nI don’t know anything about IOS, but it’s there a difference between closing and force closing? At least a restart should be the same as a force close.\n\nHi Jeff. There is a difference. You need to swipe the app up and away to close it fully on iOS rather than simply coming out of it to the homescreen or other app. She tried both. I suspect, if you haven’t heard of this issue with any other phone, it may be a temporary glitch. I’ll keep an eye on it and let you know if it continues."
