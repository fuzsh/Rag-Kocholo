        "text": "Resizing image while not constraining proportions will make it look rather squashed, distorted and otherwise not flattering. Why not resize it to fit with some negative space on the sides (or one side), it might even be good to put some text next to it, or even use two portrait-orientated images on the same page if you think looks better... This is not an answer to your question, but it's worth thinking about it...\n\nOr the other solution would be to crop it to fit your dimensions, but you will be losing a large part of your image which is on the other hand questionable on flattering your images... For this, use the crop tool or the Canvas Size operation (Image->Canvas Size).\n\nAnd another thing, pixelization occurs when you enlarge the with or height (or both) of the image, so you might have a small image, or you need to be reducing the size of your image to achieve what you want..."
