You can navigate receipts and nutrition labels in logical order, or move your finger over a photo to discover a person’s position relative to other objects.\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > VoiceOver Recognition, then turn on Image Descriptions.\n\nIn an app such as Photos or Safari, select an image.\n\nSwipe up to hear more options, then double-tap when you hear “Explore image features.”\n\nMove your finger around on the image to find out the position of each object."
