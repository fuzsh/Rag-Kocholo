        "text": "My Galaxy S10e has the same problem. I have the impression it's some interoperability problem between Samsung's One UI and the video player on Twitter. It's very frustrating.\n\nI have used Samsung producs for years and it's really disappointing to see bugs like this appearing lately. I also had an underwealming experience buying a TV from Samsung in the past.\n\nI hope they at least fix this soon.\n\nEdit:\n\nPreviously I suggested that using Nova Launcher could be a workaround for this problem while it isn't completely fixed, however after using Nova Launcher for a few days the audio problem started happening again. So using a different launcher will not fix the issue."
