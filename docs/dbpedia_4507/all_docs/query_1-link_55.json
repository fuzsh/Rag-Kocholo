This is great for sharing music files, and podcast episodes, and showcasing your audio portfolio. In this documentation, we’ll cover how to use the Audio Module and all of the settings and design options available within the Audio Module.\n\nView A Live Demo Of This Module\n\nHow to Add the Divi Audio Module to Your Page\n\nBefore you can add the Divi Audio Module to your website, you’ll need to have the Divi theme installed on your WordPress website. Learn how to install the Divi theme on your WordPress website here. Once you have the Divi theme installed and activated, we can begin using the features and functionalities of Divi. For additional information on the Divi Builder itself, its interface, usage philosophy and best practices, please refer to our Getting Started With The Divi Builder guide.\n\nAdd The Divi Audio Module\n\nWhen you load the Visual Builder, Divi automatically adds a section and a row. You can learn more about how to modify and customize sections here and rows here. Once the section, row, and columns are set up, click on the grey “+” icon inside the row. This brings up the Divi Module Library which contains all the modules included with the Divi theme. Scroll down to “Video” and click on it to load the module.\n\nNote: This module library is also searchable. Type the name of the module you want in the search bar at the top.\n\nAll Divi Audio Module Options Explained\n\nOnce you’ve added the Divi Audio Module, the module settings automatically pop up. This is where all of the content and design styles for this module are configured. These settings are organized into three groups via the tabs at the top of the module: Content, Design, and Advanced.\n\nContent\n\nInside this tab, you’ll find the content options available for the Divi Audio Module.\n\nText\n\nThis is where you can add the text content for this module. The track title, artist, and album.\n\nTitle – Type the title of the song here. If this field is left blank, it will not display.\n\nArtist – Type the name of the artist here. If this field is left blank, it will not display.\n\nAlbum – Type the name of the album here. If this field is left blank, it will not display.\n\nAudio\n\nAdd an audio file to the module by clicking “Upload File”. This brings up the WordPress media library where you can select an uploaded file or upload a new one. Choose the file you want and then click the blue “Upload an audio file” button in the bottom right of the media library window.\n\nImage\n\nAdd Image – To add an image to the Divi Audio Module, click “Add Image”. Once clicked, this brings up the WordPress media library where you can choose an uploaded image from your media library or upload a new one. By default, the image will be to the left of the audio track. The add an image to the background of the module you can do so in the background toggle (keep reading for instructions on how to do so).\n\nLink\n\nIf you would like to apply a clickable link to the entire module, you can do so here.\n\nModule Link URL – Paste the URL of the link you would like to apply to this module here. This makes the entire module clickable and when clicked it will direct visitors to the URL pasted here.\n\nModule Link Target – Defining a link target determines whether the link, when clicked, opens in a new tab or in the same window. Choose “In The Same Window” if you want the link to open in the same window and click “In The New Tab” if you would like that link to open in a new tab. By default, “In The Same Window” is selected.\n\nBackground\n\nThis is where you can add a background color, gradient, image, video, pattern, or mask to the Divi Audio Module.\n\nHow to Add a Background Color\n\nTo add a background color to the entire module, click the first tab, the paint bucket.
