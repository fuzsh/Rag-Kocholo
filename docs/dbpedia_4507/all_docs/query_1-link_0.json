        "text": "Images and audio represent different types of data so it's difficult to compare them directly, it's a bit like comparing apples and orange.\n\nHowever, the main reason that audio files are normally larger than static images is because audio files have an extra dimension, time, and therefore there is more overall data to represent. If you add time as a dimension to an image, you get video, which even without audio is much larger than an audio file.\n\nAudio files aren't always larger than images though. Compression is the key factor, some image files are actually quite large if they're uncompressed and have a large color range (like HDR). An RAW uncompressed 2048*2048 image with 40-bits of color per pixel could take up to 168MB of space. Most songs you'd listen to would take up far less space than that, because MP3/AAC files are compressed.\n\nThe reverse case can also be true. If the song file was in WAV format, then a 4 minute song would be around 40MB. And that 2048*2048 image, using a compressed lossy format like WebP, might only take up 600KB.\n\nBut, assuming a reasonable compression with both, a standard large image compressed to 600KB, is going to be smaller than your average compressed song, which even at a lower quality is around 1MB per minute."
