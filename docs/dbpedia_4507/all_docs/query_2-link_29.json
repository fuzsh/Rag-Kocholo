        "text": "I would like to share an observation and get your thoughts both from newbies and the professional artists we have on board.\n\nMany times it has been commented that “I can’t do landscapes” or “I can’t do figures/portraits” and it seems we have so few that do both. Is it a comfort level?? Intimidation?? Lack of skill/technique training?? Fear of the unknown??\n\nTell me why it seems easier for some people to do landscapes and not for others. Is there a right brain/left brain kind of thing here??\n\nJust thought this would be an interesting discussion and we might learn something from it, or challenge ourselves to try something we think we can’t do. I for one am portraiture challenged – what are you??\n\nMember of the Pastel Society of NC\n\nKat, I haven’t much time to answer now but will throw this in. The face is specific to an individual while painting landscapes is a universal experience. Everyone has seen the landscape but not everyone knows what the model looks like. In one way it means that we all criticize the landscape because without knowing why we know it’s wrong or right. In another way we all know what faces look like in general but not in the specific model.\n\nLandscapes are my passion. Faces have never interesed me the same way. I think it’s all the measuring and mere centimeters of difference–I’m more comfortable with miles!\n\nGreat question! I look forward to more answers…\n\nDeborah\n\nDeborah\n\n\"All glory to Him, who alone is God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"\n\nLandscape Painting in Pastels (free online book)\n\nGouache Blog\n\nThanks dee for getting this thread started! I think you brought up a good point – one that I was searching for – why are we more comfortable with one form and not the other?\n\nI feel so at home doing landscapes, but the portrait/figure stumps me and the times that I have tried, I have sweated blood and tears over it (and I have had professional training too!!).\n\nInteresting … hmmm??\n\nMember of the Pastel Society of NC\n\nI just have an easier time with portraits- I cannot explain it- I wish I could figure it out myself, lol. Of course I have only been at this a little over a year so I still have hope, here is my pathetic attempt at landscape\n\nA painter paints the appearance of things, not their objective correctness, in fact he creates new appearances of things. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner\n\nMy beautiful avatar is from Kordelia the artist we call NonnyKor\n\nKat,\n\nGreat topic. Speaking for myself, my previous professions all revolved around people – medicine, tourism, human resources and I love looking at the human face and the curves and shapes and unique things. I like the close range of the figure and face and find that range of distance is easiest for me to paint. I also prefer rounded shapes -vs- lines or blocks that I think of in painting buildings and horizons. (Dee – I find measuring building angles much more tedious than the eye to mouth angle and relationship.)\n\nBut…. I truly believe it’s practice and exposure that strengthens your skills and interests. I love being outdoors. It is challenging to paint in the direct sunlight but I really love the sound of birds and wind at my face to blow away the dust and mineral spirits. The bugs… the sand and dirt in my supplies… the strong wind… the cold breezes like I experienced completely yesterday, are daunting. Yet it’s more lovely in color and movement when you paint live and outdoors.\n\nLandscapes from a photo – I’ve only done a limited amount of these and again I need more practice. I figure winter weather will direct me that way.\n\nCan’t wait to hear what others say.\n\nOh – I may have to get bifocals tomorrow which may in fact change my world of what I like to paint!\n\nBarb\n\n[FONT=Palatino Linotype]Do what you love, love what you do!\n\nwww.MorninNoonanNight.com"
