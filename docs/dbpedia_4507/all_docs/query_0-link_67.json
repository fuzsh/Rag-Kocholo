The purpose of landscaping is to improve the livability of residential neighborhoods, enhance the customer attraction of commercial areas, increase property values, improve the compatibility of adjacent uses, provide visual separation and physical buffers between incompatible adjacent land uses, provide visual relief from the expanse of parking lots, screen undesirable views, contribute to the image and appeal of the overall community, and mitigate air and noise pollution.\n\nThese requirements are also intended to facilitate low impact development techniques through the retention of existing vegetation including trees to the extent feasible and to require replanting if existing trees are removed; to reduce erosion and storm water runoff; to preserve and promote urban wildlife habitats; to enhance the streetscapes along the city’s public rights-of-way with an emphasis on trees; to define and separate vehicular and pedestrian traffic areas; to screen the appearance of parking areas from public rights-of-way and adjacent properties; and to make the city a more aesthetically pleasing place to live, shop and work. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.020 Applicability.\n\nThe provisions of this chapter shall apply to any of the following:\n\n(1) All new public and private developments, multifamily housing larger than a duplex, and long plats;\n\n(2) Any additions to existing structures that exceed 30 percent of the gross floor area, or are in excess of 1,000 square feet;\n\n(3) Any expansion of a mobile home park in which the number of new mobile home lots exceeds 10 percent of the number of existing mobile home lots;\n\n(4) Provisions required by Chapter 19.48 OHMC;\n\n(5) Situations where this chapter imposes a requirement for buffering or screening between two uses, one of which is existing and the other new. The responsibility for satisfying this requirement rests entirely on the new use;\n\n(6) Single-family dwellings and duplexes;\n\n(7) Any preexisting vehicular surface area which expands in excess of 25 percent shall provide the landscaping required in OHMC 19.46.030. No expenditure made for removing existing asphalt, constructing planting areas, installing irrigation systems, and adding dirt and plant materials which is required in order to comply with these requirements shall be required to exceed four percent of the total assessed real property value of the subject property on which the improvements are being made. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.030 Requirements for setbacks, perimeters, buffers, fences, screening, and parking lots.\n\n(1) Required minimum landscape setbacks apply to all zoning districts, except those projects specifically excluded in OHMC 19.46.020.\n\n(a) Minimum width of landscape setback, as identified with the city’s street classification plan:\n\n(i) Large shopping centers in excess of five acres adjacent to principal arterial streets: 20 feet;\n\n(ii) Any multifamily and nonresidential use constructed on a designated scenic transportation route: 20 feet;\n\n(iii) All other uses adjacent to a principal arterial: 12 feet;\n\n(iv) Adjacent to a minor arterial or collector arterial: 10 feet;\n\n(v) Adjacent to all other streets: eight feet;\n\n(vi) Where roadway right-of-way expansion is proposed, the setback will begin at the anticipated new edge of the road.\n\n(b) Minimum Number of Trees in Landscaped Setbacks. There shall be four trees for every 100 linear feet of frontage of property adjacent to all street classifications. Guidelines for the specific types and locations of trees and other landscape materials in landscape setbacks are contained within the landscape policy manual.\n\n(c) Design Standards.\n\n(i) Some of the required landscape setback trees may be clustered in the setback. Parking lot screening may be included in the landscape setback width. The required landscaped setback trees may be permitted to be partially or totally located in the adjacent public right-of-way area, if:\n\n(A) All of the required trees cannot be placed in the landscaped setback;\n\n(B) There are no conflicts with utility easements;\n\n(C) In the case of the state highway, the city engineer and State Highway Engineer approve;\n\n(D) It shall be the responsibility of the adjacent property owner to care for landscaped rights-of-way;\n\n(E) Where undeveloped adjacent right-of-way occurs, it shall be landscaped.\n\nThe required landscaped setback trees may be located in the adjacent public right-of-way area if these trees cannot be placed in the landscaped setback area due to the existing development of the site. However, such trees are required only to the extent that: (1) the city engineer and State Highway Engineer approve the trees in the case of a state highway; and (2) no conflicts exist within utility easements.\n\n(ii) Opaque walls and fences which obstruct view shall be located outside (building side) of the setback to maintain a landscaped appearance along the street.\n\n(iii) Administrative relief of the requirements of this section may be requested in accordance with OHMC 19.46.160.\n\n(2) Required Minimum Landscape Perimeters. Planting areas within side and rear yards that are not occupied by structures shall be as follows:\n\n(a) Minimum Width of Perimeter. Five feet for the length of the property line, unless otherwise specified under screening requirements of this chapter;\n\n(b) Exemptions. Perimeter of industrial site or commercial yard that is not substantially visible from the right-of-way or located where screening is not required, shall be exempt;\n\n(c) Planting Requirements.\n\n(i) A minimum of four trees shall be planted for every 100 linear feet, or fraction thereof, of perimeter planting area;\n\n(ii) Shrubs and ground cover plantings shall be in quantities and spacing that will provide for 80 percent ground coverage within three years;\n\n(iii) When abutting properties with different land use classifications occur, the screening requirements under OHMC 19.46.030(3) and (4) shall supersede the requirements of this subsection;\n\n(d) Connecting Driveways. When connecting joint driveways or shared parking lots are provided between sites, the minimum area requirements may be reduced by the area occupied by the driveway that would otherwise be landscaped under the requirements of this subsection.\n\n(3) Required Minimum Landscape Buffers.\n\n(a) Buffers between (1) adjacent nonresidential and residential uses; and (2) adjacent nonresidential uses and single-family residential zones:\n\n(i) Design Standards. The buffer shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide and shall be located on the property line adjacent to any single-family residential community. Said buffer shall generally consist of a mix of predominantly evergreen plantings including trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum height of four feet at time of planting. Planting shall be chosen and spaced so as to grow together within four years of their planting in a manner that is sufficient to obscure sight through the barrier. The entire planting strip shall be landscaped; however, those plantings used to achieve the sight-obscuring screen shall cover at least six feet of the width of the strip.\n\n(b) Buffers between adjacent multifamily residential and single-family residential zones:\n\n(i) Design Standards. The buffer shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide and shall be located on the property line adjacent to the single-family residential community.\n\n(c) Buffers between nonresidential and residential uses separated by a nonarterial street, public alley or private street:\n\n(i) Design Standards. The buffer shall be a minimum of 12 feet in depth. The minimum number of trees in the buffer shall be two trees for every 20 linear feet of buffer. The trees will consist of a mix of evergreen and deciduous. Depending upon the nonresidential use, evergreens may be increased to help obscure sight between the two uses. An opaque structure with a maximum height of six feet may be optional along the common property line. If a fence is constructed, planting shall still occur as stated above. The buffer may be reduced to 10 feet if an opaque structure is erected.\n\n(d) Buffers between an industrial classified district and a residential classified district:\n\n(i) Design Standards. All sites in an industrial district having a common boundary with a residential district shall be planted and maintained along such common boundary with a view-obscuring coniferous greenbelt of shrubs, trees and native vegetation not less than six feet in height nor less than 10 feet in width, for screening purposes and controlling access.\n\n(4) Fences and Screening. When applicable, the requirements of this section shall supersede the requirements of other sections of this chapter.\n\n(a) Purpose. The requirements of this subsection are intended to reduce visual impacts and incompatible characteristics of:\n\n(i) Abutting properties with different land use classifications;\n\n(ii) Service areas and facilities, including loading and storage areas;\n\n(iii) Parking areas located in front of buildings;\n\n(iv) Any other use or area as required under this section, or determined to be necessary by the planning director (or designee).\n\nThe fence or landscaping screen shall be sight-obscuring, obstructing storage areas from view on the sides of the property abutting, adjoining, or facing a residential district. The fence shall be of such material and design as will not detract from adjacent residences and shall be built according to plans submitted by the owner or his/her authorized agent and approved by the planning director (or designee).\n\n(b) Landscaping. Screen planting shall consist of evergreen trees planted a maximum of 15 feet on center, or hedges with dense evergreen foliage, in combination with deciduous trees and hedges for seasonal color and texture. Ground cover shall be planted at a density to form an effective barrier to cover 85 percent of the ground surface within two years.\n\n(i) On a corner lot there may be placed and maintained:\n\n(A) A fence or screen not more than three feet in height; provided, that it is not sight-obstructing (50 percent of the area of the fence or screen is open) along a public or private street;\n\n(B) A six-foot-high open wire fence along the property line facing the side street; provided, that it does not come closer to the street right-of-way on the front of the lot than the required building setback;\n\n(C) A four-foot-high solid fence or hedge parallel to the property line facing the side street; provided, it is 10 feet back from the side street; and provided, that it does not come closer to the street on the front of the lot than the rear of the building.\n\n(ii) In commercial zones, no fence or hedge may be placed on the front yard setback except where required to screen the property from the adjacent lot; then the screen shall extend to the street right-of-way.\n\n(c) Minimum Width.\n\n(i) Landscape Screening. If screening is to be achieved through the use of plant materials only, the screening area shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width. If other materials, such as fencing, walls or berms, are used in conjunction with the landscaping, the width may be reduced, as described in subsections (4)(c)(ii) through (iv) of this section.\n\n(ii) Earth Berm Alternative. If an earth berm is incorporated into the screening plan, medium sized shrubs and/or evergreen trees shall be spaced a maximum of four and one-half feet on center and the width of the screening area may be reduced to eight feet.\n\n(iii) Fence Alternative. If a fence option is selected, maximum spacing of medium sized shrubs shall be six feet on center, and the width of the screening area may be reduced to seven feet. The fence shall be constructed of exterior weather- resistant wood, or applicable alternative. One alternative may be a cyclone fence; however, such a fence shall include slats, and if the fence is next to a right-of-way, landscaping shall be planted between the fence and the right-of-way. Plantings must obscure 75 percent of a cyclone fence within four years.\n\n(iv) Wall Alternative. If a wall at least five feet high is to be used for screening, the planting requirements shall be as specified under subsection (1) of this section, and the screening width may be reduced to five feet. Screen walls shall be constructed with masonry, block, rockery or textured concrete, subject to design approval by the planning director.\n\n(d) Uses Requiring Screening. The planning director may require screening to protect adjacent properties from negative impacts of any permitted or conditional use in a zoning district.\n\nExcept as otherwise required by the planning director, screening shall be required in the following instances:\n\n(i) Developments located in districts listed on the left side of the chart below shall provide screening when they adjoin districts specified on the right side of the chart.\n\nDistrict to Be Developed\n\nDistrict to Be Screened\n\nMultifamily residential\n\nSingle-family residential\n\nSemi-public\n\nAll residential\n\nCommercial/business\n\nAll residential\n\nIndustrial\n\nAll residential/commercial\n\n(ii) Churches, community centers, and other similar conditional uses shall provide perimeter screening when adjoining a residential district.\n\n(e) Fence and screen height limits in the various zones are as follows:\n\nResidential Zones:\n\nFront yard\n\n3 feet maximum\n\nSide yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nRear yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nCommercial Zones:\n\nFront yard\n\n0 feet maximum\n\nSide yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nRear yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nIndustrial Zones:\n\nFront yard\n\n8 feet maximum\n\nSide yard\n\n8 feet maximum\n\nRear yard\n\n8 feet maximum\n\n(5) Minimum Parking Lot Requirements.\n\n(a) Required Trees.\n\n(i) One tree of a type suitable for parking lots shall be provided for every 10 open (not in a garage) vehicular parking spaces in parking lots with 10 or more spaces;\n\n(ii) The tree types and minimum planter sizes shall be consistent with the landscape policy manual. Trees chosen shall be appropriate to a parking lot location;\n\n(iii) The required trees may be clustered but shall be located to divide and break up expanses of paving and long rows of parking spaces and to create a canopy effect in the parking lot. In order to be considered within the parking lot, the trees must be located in planters that are bounded on at least three sides of parking lot paving. This means only trees in landscaped “islands” or “fingers” can count toward the parking lot tree requirement;\n\n(iv) Planters shall be of sufficient size and design to accommodate the growth of the trees and to prevent damage to the trees by vehicles;\n\n(v) The number of species required shall vary according to the overall number of trees required to be planted. The species shall be planted in proportion to the required mix. The species mix shall not apply to areas of vegetation required to be preserved by law nor those located in areas designated as natural. The number of species to be planted are indicated below.\n\nRequired # of trees\n\nMaximum # of species\n\n6 – 10\n\n2\n\n11 – 15\n\n3\n\n16 +\n\n4\n\n(b) Required Landscape Area. At least 15 percent of every parking lot shall be landscaped, unless otherwise required by this title. In all cases, with the exception of vehicular display lots, landscaping shall be distributed throughout the parking area. Landscaping located in required setbacks or buffers may not be used to meet this requirement. If LID rain gardens or bioretention facilities are proposed, they are to be incorporated into the required parking lot landscaping unless site and soil conditions make such facilities infeasible. LID stormwater management facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound (current edition). The landscaping shall consist of deciduous and/or coniferous material and may include turf, shrubs, and flowers.\n\n(c) Required Screening.\n\n(i) Open parking spaces (except those in single-family residential projects in any zone district) shall be screened from the view of adjacent properties and streets to mature minimum height of 30 inches by the use of berms and/or plantings;\n\n(ii) A minimum of two-thirds of the affected street frontage or property boundary, not counting intersecting driveways, must have the required screen;\n\n(iii) The required screening may be a component of the required landscape setback;\n\n(iv) Structures such as decorative walls or fences may be approved through an administrative relief request if the planning director (or other designee) finds that:\n\n(A) The structures avoid a blank and monotonous appearance by such measures as architectural articulation and the planting of vines, shrubs or trees; or\n\n(B) The total use of the berms and/or plantings is not physically feasible; or\n\n(C) The structures attractively complement the use of berms and/or plantings;\n\n(v) The maximum spacing of plants to achieve an acceptable screen and the maximum acceptable grades for screening areas, such as sodded berms and planting beds, shall be consistent with the landscaping policy manual;\n\n(vi) Guidelines for the specific types and location of trees, shrubs and other landscape materials in parking lots are contained within the landscape policy manual as approved by the city council or thereafter amended.\n\n(6) In addition to the requirements and standards of this chapter, the landscape guidelines in the design guidelines shall apply. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.035 North Whidbey Enterprise Area landscape requirements.\n\n(1) The standards contained in this section apply to the North Whidbey Enterprise Area as identified in Exhibit C of the Urban Growth Area Interlocal Agreement between Island County and the city of Oak Harbor, a copy of which is on file with the city clerk and available for public inspection.\n\n(2) Significant Tree Retention. Significant tree retention in the I, PIP, C-4 and nonresidential development, short subdivision and subdivision in the PRE zones shall meet the following standards:\n\n(a) Applicants should retain 15 percent of the significant trees found on the property except for those trees found in the building footprints, access roads, parking areas and utility line trenches. Applicants should give attention to the following:\n\n(i) Preservation of significant trees along the perimeter of the property; and\n\n(ii) Preservation of significant trees near or adjacent to critical areas; and\n\n(iii) Preservation of significant trees which create a distinctive skyline feature; and\n\n(iv) Preservation of Garry Oak trees; and\n\n(v) Trees that may constitute a safety hazard should be removed; and\n\n(vi) Special attention shall be given to preservation of significant trees on properties identified in the 2001 Oak Harbor Comprehensive Plan, Environmental Element, Woodland Map.\n\n(b) An inventory of significant trees shall be submitted with all applications for subdivision, short subdivision or site plan review.\n\n(3) Landscaping, screening and buffering in the I and PIP zones shall meet the following standards:\n\n(a) Open storage, trash or recycling areas shall be screened by fencing and/or landscaping;\n\n(b) Landscaping including street trees spaced no further than 20 feet on center shall be required in all front yards and the abutting public road; and\n\n(c) Buffers between industrial zones and adjacent residential properties shall be planted along the common boundary. The planting should include coniferous shrubs, trees and native vegetation. Fencing may be incorporated to help ensure an effective visual buffer.\n\n(4) Landscape for I, PIP and C-4 lands abutting Goldie Road and Oak Harbor Road shall meet the following standards:\n\n(a) A 20-foot landscape setback shall be established; and\n\n(b) The area between the property line and drainage swale shall be planted with low profile foliage; and\n\n(c) The landscape area shall be planted with a mixture of native evergreen trees containing a variety of species, colors and textures for a year-round green, attractive appearance; and\n\n(d) If the landscape buffer setback does not have existing significant vegetation, the buffer will be planted with native evergreen trees. If deciduous trees are desired they may be planted at a rate of two evergreen to one deciduous tree; and\n\n(e) Maximum spacing of the trees shall be 10 feet on center or equivalent grouping as determined by site and existing conditions; and\n\n(f) Roadway and intersection requirements shall prevail if a conflict arises with the landscape standards listed herein. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.040 General landscaping standards.\n\n(1) Landscape Materials.\n\n(a) Landscape materials shall be defined as evergreen or deciduous trees, shrubs, and ground cover plants, perennial or annual flowers, and lawn. River rock, fountains, ponds, rockeries, ornamental or decorative walkways (provided both sides abut landscaping) may be included, where, in the opinion of the director, additional ornamental features may be considered as part of the landscape materials, subject to the administrative relief process.\n\n(b) Suggested tree species suited to the unique soils, geology, and weather patterns of Oak Harbor are contained in OHMC 19.46.150.\n\n(c) Planting shall occur based on species’ tolerance to the environment in which it will be placed.\n\n(d) No artificial lawn or plants will be permitted in landscaped areas.\n\n(2) Drainage Detention/Retention Ponds. If a proposed detention pond has a slope ratio of 3:1 or greater, where fencing around the pond will be required, a fencing and landscaping plan shall be submitted to the planning department. Submittal of the proposed fencing and landscaping plan shall occur in conjunction with short plat, preliminary plat, or site plan review applications, depending on the project type.\n\n(3) Land Clearing Plan. Clearing of landscaping is required to be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 19.47 OHMC.\n\n(4) Pollution Control. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to ensure that storm runoff from landscaped areas does not contain excessive amounts of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides that may be harmful to aquatic life, and to take measures to prevent runoff water impacts as required by the Department of Ecology and Wildlife and as specified in the Puget Sound Water Quality Manual. One measure to reduce the use of chemicals is the use of native plants in landscape areas.\n\n(5) Safety Features/Utilities. Installation of landscape materials shall not obstruct access to fire connections, post indicator valves (PIVs) and hydrants, standpipes, sprinkler connections, utility vaults, pedestals, and other public and private utility facilities. Landscaping shall not obstruct fire apparatus access roads.\n\n(6) Visibility Triangle. Along street frontages, within 30 feet of an alley or unsignalized street intersection, or within 25 feet of a driveway, no shrub shall be higher than 30 inches from street gutter grade and no tree shall have branches or foliage below eight feet above street level. At signalized intersections the conditions of this section shall not be necessary, but it shall be required that only deciduous trees be located at signalized intersections. Under no circumstances shall landscaping interfere with sight distance visibility. In lieu of meeting this standard, visibility triangles shall be provided as per AASHTO standards or in accordance with OHMC 11.17.110(5).\n\n(7) Where practical, landscaping shall be designed to not block solar gain or solar access by surrounding properties.\n\n(8) Special Landscaping Districts. The area of the CBD central business district, for the purpose of this chapter, will be considered a special landscaping district. This area is substantially developed on zero setbacks from the right-of-way, making it impractical to meet the full extent of the requirements of this chapter. Businesses located in this district shall meet parking lot landscaping standards as shown in OHMC 19.46.030(5) and shall participate in a street tree planting program in the street right-of-way adjacent to the parcel frontage.\n\n(9) Xeriscape Process. Xeriscape is a process by which sound horticultural, landscaping, and efficient water-using principles come together. The style of the xeriscapes can be quite variable. Drought-resistant landscaping, such as a contemporary design or a Spanish garden, could qualify as xeriscape when constructed to meet the following six principles:\n\n(a) Good Design. Based on careful selection of low-water-use plants or drought-tolerant plants;\n\n(b) Soil Improvement. Improvements including the addition of manure, compost, or other organic materials which can be amended into the soil;\n\n(c) Use of Mulch. Beauty bark or other organic substance to help maintain moisture in the soil;\n\n(c) Limited Lawn Areas. Minimizing grass areas results in minimal lawn maintenance;\n\n(d) Efficient Water Use. Water between 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. to help prevent fungus growth, and lower the evaporation rate of water;\n\n(e) Good Maintenance. Maintain the landscape to reflect a weed and trash free environment.\n\n(10) Landscaping for Freestanding Signs. All primary freestanding signs shall include, as part of their design, landscaping about their base to prevent automobiles from hitting the sign-supporting structure and to improve the overall appearance of the installation. If the required landscaping is not completed within 60 days after completion of sign installation, the sign is in violation of this chapter.\n\n(11) Groundcover. Groundcover shall be planted and maintained within all required landscaping areas. Groundcover refers to low-growing dense growth of plants, such as pachysandra, planted for ornamental purposes or to prevent soil erosion in areas where turf is difficult to grow, as in deep shade or on a steep slope. Groundcover shall consist of plantings that will achieve complete coverage within two years. Groundcover is not required within the dripline of any shrub or evergreen tree or within a two-foot radius of a deciduous tree trunk.\n\n(12) Undeveloped Areas. Undeveloped areas of a lot which are not required to be landscaped by other requirements of this chapter shall be planted with groundcover. Groundcover may consist of planted or existing vegetation maintained so as not to exceed one foot in height. For the purposes of this section, grass can be considered to be groundcover.\n\n(13) Bark, Mulch and Gravel. Bark, mulch, gravel or other similar nonvegetative material shall only be used to assist vegetative growth and maintenance within landscaping areas. Nonvegetative material shall not be a substitute for, or interfere with, required vegetative groundcover.\n\n(14) Tree Topping and Thinning. Topping and thinning of trees shall be allowed as long as it does not negatively affect the health of the tree.\n\n(15) Calculations/Measurements. All calculations and measurements within this chapter shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with greater than or equal to 0.50 being rounded up. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.050 Fences and hedges.\n\n(1) Fences and hedges a maximum of six feet in height may be placed and maintained on the side and rear lot line, and across the front of the property line even with the front of the building on the lot but not closer to the street right-of-way than the required setback. On corner lots the setback shall apply to both streets.\n\nWithin the setback area a fence not more than three feet in height may be constructed; provided, that it is not sight-obscuring (50 percent of the area of the fence is open).\n\nWithin the setback area a solid hedge may be planted not to exceed a height of more than three feet.\n\nOn a corner lot there may be placed and maintained:\n\n(a) A fence or hedge not more than three feet in height; provided, that it is not sight-obstructing (50 percent of the area of the fence or hedge is open);\n\n(b) A six-foot-high open wire fence along the property line facing the side street; provided, that it does not come closer to the street right-of-way on the front of the lot than the required building setback;\n\n(c) A four-foot-high solid fence or hedge parallel to the property line facing the side street; provided, it is 10 feet back from the side street; and provided, that it does not come closer to the street on the front of the lot than the rear of the house.\n\n(2) In commercial zones, no fence or hedge may be placed on the front yard setback except where required to screen the property from the adjacent lot; then the screen shall extend to the street right-of-way.\n\n(3) Fence and hedge limits in the various zones are as follows:\n\nResidential Zones:\n\nFront yard\n\n3 feet maximum\n\nSide yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nRear yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nCommercial Zones:\n\nFront yard\n\n0 feet maximum\n\nSide yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nRear yard\n\n6 feet maximum\n\nIndustrial Zones:\n\nFront yard\n\n8 feet maximum\n\nSide yard\n\n8 feet maximum\n\nRear yard\n\n8 feet maximum\n\n(Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.070 Conflicts.\n\n(1) If the provisions of this chapter conflict with other ordinances or regulations, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern or prevail to the extent of the conflict.\n\n(2) In the event that, because of lot configuration, adjacent land uses, or special circumstances, more landscaping is required to meet all requirements of this title, the higher amount of landscaping shall be required. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.080 Maintenance of required landscape areas.\n\n(1) Maintenance of Cultivated Areas.\n\n(a) General. The owner of land subject to this chapter shall be responsible for the maintenance of said land in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly landscape area.\n\n(b) Maintenance of Plants. All landscaping and screening areas shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition. Broken, dead, or dying trees, shrubs, or other plants shall be replaced. All landscaping and screening shall be kept free of trash and weeds.\n\n(c) Tree Removal. It shall be the responsibility of each private property owner to remove any dead, diseased, or dangerous trees or shrubs, or part thereof, located on private property which overhang or interfere with traffic control devices, public sidewalks, rights-of-way, or property owned by the city. The city shall have the authority to order the removal and possible replacement of any such trees or shrubs.\n\n(d) Pruning.\n\n(i) All pruning should be accomplished according to good horticultural standards. Trees shall be pruned only as necessary to promote healthy growth;\n\n(ii) Unless special approval is provided, trees shall be allowed to attain their normal size and shall not be severely pruned or “hat racked” in order to permanently maintain growth at a reduced height;\n\n(iii) Trees may be periodically pruned or thinned in order to reduce the leaf mass and stimulate further branching.\n\n(e) Mowing. Grass shall be mown as required in order to encourage deep root growth and therefore the preservation of irrigation water.\n\n(f) Edging. All roadways, curbs, and sidewalks shall be edged when necessary in order to prevent encroachment from the adjacent grass areas.\n\nPower trimmers shall not be used to trim grasses around trees since they will quickly remove bark causing deterioration and eventual death of the tree.\n\n(g) Watering. All watering of planted areas shall be managed so as to:\n\n(i) Maintain healthy flora;\n\n(ii) Make plant material more drought-tolerant;\n\n(iii) Avoid excessive turf growth;\n\n(iv) Minimize fungus growth;\n\n(v) Stimulate deep root growth;\n\n(vi) Minimize leaching of fertilizers;\n\n(vii) Minimize cold damage.\n\nWatering of plants and trees should always be in sufficient amounts to thoroughly soak the root ball of the plant and the surrounding area, thereby promoting deep root growth and drought tolerance.\n\nWhenever possible, automatic irrigation systems should be installed and operation should occur between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. Irrigation during these hours helps to reduce fungus growth and loss of water due to evaporation.\n\nIf an irrigation system is installed it shall be regularly maintained to eliminate waste of water due to loss of heads, broken pipes, or misjudged nozzles. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.100 Landscaping and irrigation plans required.\n\nLandscaping and irrigation plans shall be submitted for any landscaping activity required by OHMC 19.46.020. The landscaping plan shall be reviewed by the director. All landscaping plans shall include information regarding existing vegetation to be preserved on site and newly proposed plantings.\n\n(1) Nature of Required Plans. Landscape plans for lots larger than one and one-half acres in size shall be prepared by and bear the seal of an architect or landscape architect, or other professional with demonstrated qualifications or experience.\n\n(2) Contents of Landscape Plan. The landscape plan shall be drawn to scale with dimensions and distances shown and include the following:\n\n(a) General Information.\n\n(i) Show all property lines and easements for ingress/egress and drainage;\n\n(ii) Show all existing and proposed structures. The square footage and location for each existing and proposed structure shall be identified;\n\n(iii) Show all pedestrian/bike connections and adjacent landscaping areas, storage, garbage, recycling, employee recreation and aboveground stormwater detention and treatment areas;\n\n(iv) Show all paved, impervious surface areas, not including structures.

The size and location of each item above shall be identified;\n\n(b) Information Regarding Vegetation to Be Preserved.\n\n(i) Locations of perimeters of individual trees and native vegetation areas to be preserved. The tree protection area for trees to be preserved shall be shown on the plan in accordance with OHMC 19.46.140(9).\n\n(ii) Size, species, and health of trees to be preserved.\n\n(iii) General locations of trees proposed for removal.\n\n(iv) Limits of construction on site.\n\n(v) Description of tree protection and tree maintenance measures required for the trees to be preserved.\n\n(vi) Timeline for clearing, grading and installation of tree protection measures.\n\n(vii) If native vegetation retention areas are proposed, the acreage of on-site critical areas, excluding critical area buffers and acreage of on-site public and private roads.\n\n(viii) If native vegetation retention areas are proposed, the calculation of average trees per square foot of protected native vegetation area shall be provided.\n\n(c) Information Regarding Newly Proposed Vegetation.\n\n(i) Location, size, species, spacing and number of trees to be planted.\n\n(ii) Each proposed landscaping area shall have its square footage indicated on the plan.\n\n(iii) Description and detail showing any site preparation, installation, and maintenance measures necessary for the long-term survival and health of the vegetation.\n\n(iv) Timeline for site preparation, installation, and maintenance of vegetation.\n\n(v) Cost estimate for the purchase, installation and three years’ maintenance.\n\n(3) Irrigation Plan. The landscape plan shall include an irrigation plan. An irrigation plan is required to ensure that the planting will be watered at a sufficient level for plant survival and healthy growth. For projects meeting the one-and-one-half-acre threshold, the irrigation method shall be by a permanent underground system with an automatic controller. An overriding rain sensor switch shall be provided. Also, administrative relief from the irrigation requirement may be requested for planting areas which contain only drought-tolerant vegetation.\n\n(a) The irrigation plan shall show zones, connecting nozzles, distribution valves, irrigation lines, sprinkler heads, timer location, and backflow prevention device, as well as other information integral to the proposed irrigation system.\n\n(b) In lieu of a permanent irrigation system, drought-tolerant plantings may be considered by the city. If drought-tolerant, native species are selected, a watering plan is required for the establishment phase of new plantings. The plan must provide adequate watering of the newly installed trees for a minimum of three years. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009).\n\n19.46.110 Review of landscape plans.\n\n(1) Landscape plans shall be submitted and reviewed concurrently with a development or use permit and shall be processed as part of the integrated permit process under OHMC 18.20.360.\n\n(2) Compliance with the approved landscape plans shall be a condition of approval for all development applications approved pursuant to OHMC Title 19, 20, or 21.\n\n(3) The director may allow or approve minor modifications to an approved landscape plan during the site development construction process to account for unforeseen site conditions and circumstances. The submittal of an amended landscape plan meeting the requirements of this chapter may be required. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011).\n\n19.46.120 Phased projects.\n\nPhased projects include but are not limited to shopping centers, large site developments, subdivisions, planned residential developments, and business parks. Before construction permits are issued for the first phase of any phased project, conceptual approval of the landscaping plan for the site as a whole is required. Final approval of the landscaping plan for each phase is required before construction permits are issued for a phase. Installation of landscaping for each phase of development shall be required prior to releasing occupancy permits for that phase. Relief may be available per OHMC 19.46.160.\n\nLandscaping along a frontage road or perimeter screening may be required to be installed in the first phase. Criteria to be considered in the decision includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n(1) Timing of phases of a project;\n\n(2) Proximity to residential areas. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009. Formerly 19.46.060).\n\n19.46.130 Landscape performance bonding.\n\n(1) All required landscaping shall be installed prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued.\n\n(2) Deferment. The installation of landscaping may be deferred for up to six months from the date an applicant receives a temporary certificate of occupancy. A performance bond shall be submitted to the city in order to ensure the completion of the landscaping in accordance with the approved plan. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant and the property owner to contact the city upon completion of the landscaping work and request an inspection prior to the city releasing the bond. Failure to complete all of the required landscaping within six months of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy permit shall constitute a violation and the city shall use the bond to complete the required landscaping.\n\n(3) Maintenance Bond Amount and Type. A three-year maintenance bond shall be required to ensure landscaping completion and a minimum plant survival of 80 percent at the end of three years. The type of bond shall be approved by the city and must be submitted on forms supplied by the city of Oak Harbor. The approved bond shall be posted with the development services department prior to the issuance of a building permit. The bond amount shall be 150 percent of a landscaping maintenance bid amount submitted and approved by the city. The bid amount must include labor and materials.\n\n(4) Subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section shall apply to all landscaping within a development site including street trees required within the public right-of-way and all landscaping within tracts or lots owned by private entities, such as homeowners’ associations. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011).\n\n19.46.140 Native vegetation standards.\n\nTree and vegetation retention provides substantial environmental benefits including, but not limited to, erosion prevention, reduction in storm-water runoff, preservation of fish and wildlife habitat, improved water and air quality, energy conservation, reductions in the development impacts on the stormwater drainage system and hydrologic resources, and provides a better transition between adjacent land uses.\n\n(1) Applicability. The native vegetation standards set forth in this section apply to all commercial and residential projects that require one or more of the following approvals: a binding site plan, conditional use permit, manufactured home park development plan, site plan review Type II or IV, planned business park master plan, subdivision, or planned residential development. Short subdivisions and site plan review Type I are exempt from these requirements.\n\n(2) Definition of Native Vegetation and Allowed Uses.\n\n(a) Definition. Native vegetation includes native, undisturbed areas or rehabilitation of previously disturbed areas. Native vegetation shall consist of plants and trees that are indigenous to the Pacific Northwest. For the purposes of this chapter, native vegetation is defined by a tree density of no less than one tree per 600 square feet plus native understory vegetation.\n\n(b) Allowed Uses. Native vegetation may integrate pervious, passive recreation facilities, stormwater dispersion facilities, and approved surface water restoration projects. Active open space shall not count towards native vegetation requirements. Activities within native vegetation areas shall be limited to passive recreation (e.g., trails), removal of invasive species, amendment of disturbed soils, and planting of native vegetation.\n\n(3) Native Vegetation Retention and Tree Density Standards.\n\n(a) Minimum Standards. Table 19.46.140-1 provides minimum vegetation retention standards by zone. The native vegetation must be comprised of a minimum tree density of one tree per 600 square feet plus native understory vegetation.\n\nTable 19.46.140-1: Native Vegetation\n\nStandards by Zone\n\nZone\n\nNative Vegetation Requirement\n\n(% of site area)\n\nPRE, R1\n\n15%\n\nR2\n\n10%\n\nR3, R4, OS\n\n10%\n\nRO\n\n10%\n\nC1, C3, C4, C5, CBD\n\n5%\n\nI, PBP, PIP\n\n5%\n\nPF\n\n5%\n\n(b) The minimum native vegetation area may be reduced on sites with special circumstances and where replacement and supplemental plantings are proposed. Special circumstances include, but are not limited to:\n\n(i) The retention of native vegetation to the percentages specified in Table 19.46.140-1 precludes development of the property to the minimum density or intensity specified in Chapter 19.20 OHMC.\n\n(ii) Physical limitations such as existing lot size, soils or topography.\n\n(iii) Land dedicated to public infrastructure serving the property for roads, sewer, water, or storm, or other public facilities use substantially more area than is typical of properties in the zone.\n\nThe replacement and supplemental plantings should be located in clusters or contiguous tracts and placed to maximize aesthetic, hydrologic, or habitat function and values.\n\n(4) General Provisions. Native vegetation areas shall meet the following additional standards:\n\n(a) Trees shall be retained in stands or clusters. A professional forester, arborist, or landscape architect shall prepare the landscape plan to ensure that retained vegetation is not susceptible to windthrow. See OHMC 19.46.100 for landscape plan requirements.\n\n(b) Native vegetation may be accommodated within perimeter landscaping or other required landscaped areas.\n\n(c) The minimum native vegetation retention may be decreased to five percent for nonresidential uses (e.g., churches, schools, etc.) that are permitted outright or conditionally in residential zones.\n\n(d) The calculation of the native vegetation retention area for public school sites shall be based upon the total acreage of the school site minus the areas set aside for playfields in the school site plan; provided, that for the purposes of the calculation, such playfield areas shall not exceed 30 percent of the gross site area.\n\n(e) Critical areas and their buffers may be counted towards this standard so long as they contain existing native vegetation (e.g., a steep slope with Douglas fir may be counted while one with Himalayan blackberry may not). Critical areas and their buffers that will be counted towards native vegetation shall not have to comply with the replanting standards within this chapter. Land below an ordinary high water mark shall not be counted towards the required native vegetation.\n\n(f) Any soils disturbed through the site development process that are to be counted toward the native vegetation requirements shall be amended in accordance with the “Guidelines for Implementing Soil Quality and Depth” (BMP T5.13 in Volume V of the Manual).\n\n(5) Selection Standards. The following selection standards should be used with the applicant’s design concept in order to meet the standards outlined in Table 19.46.140-1.\n\n(a) Fifteen percent of trees on the project site which are 12 inches or greater in diameter and which have a live crown ratio (total tree height in relation to branched portion of the tree) of 50 percent or more shall be preserved.\n\n(b) Utilize site inventory and analysis techniques to determine which portions of the site are best suited to leave native vegetation. Typically these are the most environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, critical fish and wildlife habitat areas. In residential developments up to 25 percent of the required native vegetation specified in Table 19.46.140-1 may be incorporated into the individual lot design where covenants or other protection measures are put in place. Where individual lots are utilized, they should be connected either physically or hydrologically to other native vegetation or conservation areas.\n\n(c) Minimize changes to natural topography in an effort to maintain predevelopment flow path lengths in natural drainage patterns.\n\n(d) Maintain surface roughness to reduce flow velocities and encourage sheet flow on the lot by preserving native vegetation, forest litter and surface topography.\n\n(6) Flexible Standards to Allow for Native Vegetation Areas.\n\n(a) Administrative relief under OHMC 19.46.160 may be granted to allow intrusion of a building into a setback yard by up to five feet to allow for the provision of native vegetation areas elsewhere on the property.\n\n(b) Setback averaging may be utilized to allow for native vegetation areas elsewhere on the property. A reduced setback shall be compensated by increased setback elsewhere.\n\n(c) Administrative relief under OHMC 19.46.160 may be granted to allow a 10 percent reduction in parking spaces to allow for the provision of native vegetation areas elsewhere on the property.\n\n(7) Replanting Requirements.\n\n(a) If the site or lot has been previously cleared or the proposed native vegetation area does not contain suitable vegetation, then the minimum percentage of native vegetation on the site as required by Table 19.46.140-1 shall be replanted to meet the requirements of subsection (7)(b) of this section. For the purposes of this section, trees subject to blow-down do not constitute suitable vegetation.\n\n(b) New trees that will be planted in native vegetation areas shall meet the revegetation standards in this section and shall be native species. For a list of native species see OHMC 19.46.150.\n\n(i) Replacement deciduous and broad-leaf evergreen trees shall have a minimum two-inch d.b.h. at planting. Replacement coniferous evergreen trees shall have a minimum height of six feet at planting;\n\n(ii) Reforested areas shall be replanted with a minimum of 25 percent deciduous species and 25 percent coniferous species;\n\n(iii) Trees within designated critical areas shall be replanted at a 2:1 ratio.\n\n(8) Permanent Protections. A permanent protective mechanism shall be established to ensure that the proposed native vegetation area is preserved and protected in perpetuity. The protective mechanism shall be in a form that is acceptable to the city and filed with the county auditor’s office. Restrictions on the future use of the native vegetation area shall also be recorded on the face of the plat for subdivision applications. A permanent native vegetation area shall be established using one of the following mechanisms:\n\n(a) Placement in a separate nonbuilding tract owned in common by all lots within the subdivision;\n\n(b) Covered by a protective easement or public or private land trust dedication;\n\n(c) Preserved through an appropriate permanent protective mechanism that provides the same level of permanent protection as subsections (8)(a) and (b) of this section as determined by the approval authority.\n\n(9) Protection of Native Vegetation Areas During and After Development.\n\n(a) All trees and tree stands proposed for retention or to be placed in a native vegetation area shall be protected before and during site development and construction through adherence to the following requirements:\n\n(i) A native vegetation area shall be designed to protect each tree or tree stand during site development and construction. The native vegetation area shall conform to the approved landscape plan.\n\n(ii) Native vegetation areas may vary widely in shape, but must extend a minimum of three feet beyond the existing tree canopy area along the outer edge of the tree stand, unless otherwise approved by the director.\n\n(iii) Native vegetation areas shall be shown and clearly labeled on all applicable site development, plat, and construction drawings submitted to the director.\n\n(iv) No clearing, grading, filling, or other development activities shall occur within the native vegetation area, except where approved in advance by the director and noted on the landscape plan.\n\n(v) No vehicles, construction materials, fuel, or other materials shall be placed in native vegetation area. Movement of any vehicles within the native vegetation area shall be prohibited.\n\n(vi) No nails, rope, cable, signs, or fencing shall be attached to any tree proposed for retention.\n\n(vii) The grade level around the tree may not be lowered within the greater of: (A) the area defined by the drip line of the tree at time of development; or (B) an area around the tree equal to one foot in diameter for each one inch of tree diameter as measured one foot above preexisting grade at time of development, unless a registered landscape architect, certified arborist or certified nursery professional determines that the long-term health of the tree will not be significantly harmed.\n\n(viii) Trenching and other activities within or adjacent to native vegetation areas that may cut or damage the roots of trees proposed for retention shall be prohibited unless recommended by a professional forester, certified arborist or licensed landscape architect and approved by the city of Oak Harbor.\n\n(ix) The city of Oak Harbor may approve the use of alternate tree protection techniques if the trees will be protected to an equal or greater degree than provided by this section. A description of alternate techniques shall be submitted to and reviewed by the director along with the site plan, short subdivision, subdivision, planned residential development or other development application.\n\n(10) Tree Topping.\n\n(a) Topping or pollarding of trees within the native vegetation area is prohibited.\n\n(b) Topping or pollarding may occur when there is an identifiable safety hazard, to remove dead, diseased or unhealthy materials, or to avoid overhead utilities.\n\n(11) Maintenance of Native Vegetation Areas.\n\n(a) Removal of trees within native vegetation areas is not allowed, unless the tree is dead or in a state of irreversible decline. In determining tree removal or replacement, the director may require a professional evaluation or tree protection plan by a certified arborist at the applicant’s expense, where the director determines that such evaluation is necessary to comply with the standards of this section. The evaluation may include providing a hazardous tree assessment, evaluation of the anticipated effects of a proposed project on the viability of trees on the site, developing a plan for tree protection or replacement and evaluation after construction. Trees that become diseased, severely damaged, or which die shall be replaced. Replacement trees shall be a minimum two-inch caliper for deciduous trees and broadleaf evergreen or a minimum of six feet in height from existing grade for conifers.\n\n(b) Minor trimming of trees within native vegetation areas is permitted as long as trimming activities do not negatively affect the long-term health and survivability of the tree. Trimming of select branches is allowed for safety reasons, e.g. cracked branches which may fall and become a hazard.\n\n(c) General. All native vegetation areas shall be annually cleared of nonnative vegetation and lawn grasses, and cleared of all trash and other debris.\n\n(d) Developer responsibility for maintenance of trees, including removal or replacement of diseased, dead, or dying trees, shall be as follows:\n\n(i) Within residential subdivisions the developer shall be responsible for maintaining trees on individual lots until such time as the individual lots are sold, at which point the individual lot owner shall assume responsibility. Developer responsibility for maintaining trees within common tracts shall remain in effect until such time as the common tract is transferred to the control of a homeowner’s association or, where no homeowner’s association exists, until such time as all individual lots within the subdivision are sold, at which point the individual lot owners shall assume responsibility.\n\n(ii) Within all other developments, developer responsibility for maintaining trees shall remain in effect until such time as the property sale occurs. Upon the property sale, the new owner shall assume the responsibility for maintenance.\n\n(iii) Compliance with the landscape plan shall be a condition of approval and shall be identified on the face of the binding site plan, conditional use permit, manufactured home park development plan, site plan review, planned business park master plan, subdivision, or planned residential development.\n\n(e) Failure to maintain trees as required in this section shall constitute a violation of this chapter and any associated land use or subdivision approvals. (Ord. 1784 § 65, 2016; Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011).\n\n19.46.150 Tree species.\n\nThe following table provides information on selected species of native and non-native trees suitable for replanting. All species listed are suited to the climate conditions found in the Pacific Northwest. The list is for guidance only and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Other tree species may be utilized where appropriate when recommended by a professional forester, certified arborist, licensed landscape architect, or as approved by the director. Species availability and quantity may be limited in some cases. It is best to coordinate in advance with nurseries specializing in native plants.\n\nCharacteristics and Use of Select Tree Species\n\nSpecies Scientific Name\n\nNative Tree?\n\nCanopy Size Category\n\nStreet Tree?\n\nCharacteristics\n\n(Ord. 1784 § 66, 2016; Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011).\n\n19.46.155 Tree removal outside of native vegetation areas.\n\nThe director may approve the removal of trees that are not part of a native vegetation area that were required to be retained as part of a previous plan approval, if it is determined that the tree is diseased, physically deteriorated, potentially hazardous, damaged or subject to windthrow. Trees that are removed as approved by the director shall be replaced at a one-to-one ratio. Replacement trees shall be a minimum two-and-one-half-inch caliper for deciduous trees or a minimum of six feet in height from existing grade for conifers. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011).\n\n19.46.160 Administrative relief and alternative compliance.\n\nThe standards contained in this chapter are intended to encourage development which is economically viable and environmentally satisfying. The standards are not intended to be arbitrary or to inhibit creative solutions. Projects may justify approval of alternative methods for compliance with the standards. Conditions may arise where normal compliance is impractical or impossible, or where maximum achievement of the community’s objectives can only be obtained through alternative compliance.\n\n(1) Requests for alternative compliance and administrative relief may be accepted for any application to which the requirements of this chapter apply, when one or more of the following conditions exist:\n\n(a) Topography, soil, vegetation or other site conditions make it impossible or impractical; or improved environmental quality would result from alternative compliance;\n\n(b) Space limitations, unusually shaped lots, and prevailing practices in the surrounding neighborhood may justify alternative compliance for infill sites, and for improvements and redevelopment in older communities;\n\n(c) Parking lots with five parking spaces or less may apply for administrative relief in order to reconfigure landscaping to be less than 15 percent of the parking lot. For example, a portion of the requirement can be met by landscaping around the perimeter of the parking lot;\n\n(d) Change of use of an existing site increases the buffer required more than it is feasible to provide;\n\n(e) Safety considerations make alternative compliance necessary;\n\n(f) When an alternative proposal is equal to or better than normal compliance in its ability to fulfill all landscaping requirements in this chapter;\n\n(g) Alternative types of irrigation for preexisting conditions.\n\nAlternative compliance shall be limited to the specific project under consideration and shall not establish precedents for acceptance in other cases.\n\n(2) Submittal Requirements.\n\n(a) Requests for alternative compliance shall be accompanied by sufficient explanation and justification, written and/or graphic, to allow appropriate evaluation and decision;\n\n(b) A request for alternative compliance shall be submitted to the planning director (or designee) at the time the landscape plan is submitted. In the case of those plans for which no public hearing is required, the decision of the planning director (or designee) will be final, unless the applicant appeals the decision to the hearing examiner.\n\n(c) The planning director may request modification of proposed standards in the administrative relief proposal. (Ord. 1615 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1555 § 20, 2009. Formerly 19.46.110).\n\n19.46.170 Enforcement of chapter."
