        "text": "Are you interested in sound art, music and performance? Have you ever thought about what sounds lie hidden in a view?\n\nThis two-weekend workshop led by composer Claudia Molitor explores contemporary thinking around looking, listening and interpreting sound. Workshop participants learn a variety of techniques for collecting and recording sound and use these to explore the view across the river from the historic site of Tate Britain. With professional singing tutor Natalie Raybould participants learn how to vocalise these sounds to others, and contribute to the creation of a new sound piece: Sounding the View that translates what can be seen from Tate Britain into a unique soundscape. Workshop participants are supported to lend their voices and perform Sounding the View alongside professional singing group EXAUDI on Saturday 23 November during an event launching Tate Britainâ€™s new gallery spaces and collection re-hang.\n\nNo prior experience of sound art, music or singing is required only an interest in these areas and an openness to using your voice. Participants will develop new listening and vocal skills, work collaboratively to develop and perform a new sound piece, and take away a recording of Sounding the View performance."
