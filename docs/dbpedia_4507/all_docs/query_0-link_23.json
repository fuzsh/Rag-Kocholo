        "text": "I know the difference between crop and rotate. I made an error in describing the edit after rotate. You are correct that the image does not lose pixels. The additional effort is simply unnecessary. No, it is not acceptable that I \"prop up whatever subject matter\" or edit the picture because the camera does what it wants.\n\nLet me orient the frame of the subject matter, not the camera.\n\nI need to get back to the original issue. Thank you for offering a few \"workarounds\". I think Samsung should be working on a solution. I should not need to take a picture as I want it and then need to edit it because the camera 'thinks' it knows what I want.\n\nWhy doesn't the \"smart\"phone offer a landscape selection like it offers a portrait selection rather than automatically rotating the image because it thinks that is what the user wants without asking. This is a question in search of a solution (built in from Samsung, not adding an app from Microsoft to accommodate what Samsung chooses not to), not a workaround.\n\nThank you again DanG92263.\n\nI have decided that I must edit the picture in the phone (rotate it 90Â°) after I take it because that is what Samsung has built in with its accelerometer override ."
