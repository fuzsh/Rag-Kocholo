        "text": "Spotify is able to accept any creative up to 30 seconds.\n\nNote: Long-form audio ads are offered in select markets for Direct IO & Programmatic Guaranteed campaigns, and can be up to 60 seconds in duration. Other than ad length, normal specifications and requirements for this offering are the same as for standard audio.\n\nFile type\n\nMP3, .OGG, or WAV format\n\nFor Programmatic .OGG format required\n\nFile size\n\n1MB For private marketplace and programmatic max file size is 500MB\n\nSample rate of 44.1kHz\n\nAudio with the wrong sample rate runs the risk of playing at the wrong speed.\n\nBit rate of 192kbps\n\nImportant for good quality audio. Think of bit depth like the resolution of a digital photograph.\n\nStereo\n\nIf your ad has music or sound effects (SFX), it will likely sound crowded in mono. Most music tracks are stereo, and bouncing to a mono file will flatten any spatial mixing on the track. Bouncing in stereo also allows you to place different components of the ad (music, SFX, VO) in different parts of the sound field for more engaging audio.\n\nOverall loudness: -16 LUFS\n\nIntegrated average loudness of -16 LUFS (+/- 1.5 LUFS) and a True Peak limit of -2.0 dBTP. This ensures the ad volume is consistent with content and throughout the ad itself. If listeners feel the need to adjust their volume for an ad, theyâ€™re more likely to skip or feel interrupted.\n\nNote: The True Peak limit is a maximum and not a number to necessarily reach. As long as the integrated loudness averages -16 LUFS (+/- 1.5 LUFS) and the TPL is equal to or less than -2.0 dB, the ad meets our spec.\n\nProgrammatic compliance:\n\nVAST 2.0: All elements within VAST must make secure calls via https. Must not entail: JavaScript, VPAID, Survey tags/DMP pixels."
