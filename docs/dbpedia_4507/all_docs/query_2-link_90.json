It takes 1-2 sec for this process also looks unprofessional and there is sometime white screen too between this procedure.\n\nAnd i am using Screen Orientation as Landscape Mode\n\nSee you can see my problem the this video -\n\nCan someone solve this ?\n\nShow your blocks\n\nThere are no blocks related to screen orientation, just select the option of landscape mode in deisgner mode of every screen\n\nTry to test your app after downloading\n\nAlready did, and also tried many blocks too\n\nSee this -\n\nBut still don’t get the solution\n\nThe video i had posted is after i downloaded the apk file\n\nThere are already some topics regarding this on community like this\n\nThere may be more. Just try to search.\n\nOR\n\nYou can also use virtual screens(Layouts) instead of actual screens\n\nYes i tried everything and the topic you posted also didn’t provide the solution.\n\nAnd i know to to use virtual screens, but that not i want bcoz i have lots of players and sounds components and wav recorders.\n\nI want solution with many screens @Vaibhav\n\nAnd i never create a new topoc before trying everything and researching for days\n\nI never said that you didn’t searched, I just told you to search more if you are not getting what you expect.\n\nAnd in case you didn’t get anything, I just provided an option to use virtual screens.\n\nI didn’t comment anything related to what you know or not, as said earlier I just told to use it if possible\n\nIf using many components in a screen is a problem for you, use dynamic components extension created by @yusufcihan\n\nHmm okay now help me solve this issue, if possible?\n\nActually i use many player components, because i want to.play all the sounds when clicked at the same.time. And may be this extension will not help me to that with 1 player. I think its similar to procedure blocks.\n\nI know how to use all functions in single screen and this screen rotation problem will not come but as mentioned many times in this topic that i can’t use single screen because i have to use many player components in every screen to play sound simultaneously at the same time and there is a bug of u use more then 15 player components. Its also not possible to use procedure or any other extension to execute that function.\n\nSo i have to use 5-6 screen, now anyone has the solution for this or not ?\n\nGreat that you know, so use it.\n\nAnd ? Did you test it?\n\nYes i test it serveral times, as i told u there is a bug on player component and i can’t use single screen and these blocks are useful for single components\n\n@Faraz_Firoz1 so do you found any solution for this problem ?\n\nCan you please tell us what problem (bug) occurs with the Player component(s) when you use virtual screens.\n\nSuggestion: make a copy of your project. Remove all but 2 screens showing the problem. Remove also all blocks except those that have something to do with the orientation (rotation) of the screens and post the aia here."
