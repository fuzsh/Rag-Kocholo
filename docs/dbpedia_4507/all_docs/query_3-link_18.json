        "text": "Creating a stereophonic image with two microphones depends on the directional characteristics of the microphones, their angling and the distance between them. The aim is to create a level difference, a time difference or a combination thereof. From psychoacoustic research [1], we know which values to aim for. The art of it – and the science – is to create the right distribution of the sound between the loudspeakers. Other parameters like timbre and envelopment also are important. However, we will only look at the level and time that creates the right distribution across the standard loudspeaker setup as shown in fig 1.\n\nFig. 1 Basic setup for stereo listening\n\nThe result can be seen from the curves in fig. 2. If no time or level differences between left and right are present, the sound source is reproduced at 0° (hard center). To make a sound source appear at 30° off center (in the direction of one of the loudspeakers), the level difference between left and right channel should be approximately 15 dB. In addition, the sound is perceived as reproduced at 30°, if the time difference between the left and right channel is approximately 1.1 ms (milliseconds).\n\nAdditionally, a combination of the time difference and the level difference can act together. For instance, the sound will be perceived as reproduced at 30° if the signal in one channel is delayed by 0.5 ms and the level is approximately 6 dB below the other channel (see dotted lines in fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2 Inter-channel differences to provide specific directional information from a two-loudspeaker setup.\n\nIn fig. 2, the inter-channel differences adequate for 10° and 20° reproduction respectively are also shown.\n\nOnce quantified, this information can be combined with the directional characteristics of the mics in a two-microphone setup. Then, it is possible to determine the optimal positioning of the microphones for a stereo recording.\n\nAs mentioned, stereo recording is not just a question of reproduction at hard left or right. Naturally, the “in-between” distribution is important. Otherwise, angular distortion will occur. This is visually explained in fig. 3.\n\nFig. 3 Percepation of angular distortion.\n\nThe following information is based on the work of Michael Williams [2].\n\nSetups for stereo: AB\n\nFig. 4 AB setup.\n\nAB stereo recording is based on a spaced pair of omnidirectional microphones. On the boom, the microphones are mounted normally, keeping the housings in parallel.\n\nThe distance from the center of the thread to the centerline of the microphone boom can be read on the bar at the outer side of the two holders respectively, (fig. 4).\n\nFig. 5 The distance from the center of the boom is read on the outer side of the holder\n\nThe AB setup provides a pleasant reproduction of the reverberant sound field and provides useful spatial information. This setup takes advantage of the omnidirectional (pressure) microphones' rich low-frequency response. The directional information, however, is slightly less distinctive compared to other setups.\n\nAB is generally not suitable for mono as the summed signal may suffer from comb filtering. (For mono, just use one of the channels).\n\nThe spacing between two omnidirectional microphones can be chosen from the curves in (fig. 6).\n\nFig. 6 Diagram to determine the distance between two omnidirectional microphones for the AB setup.\n\nThe scale on the horizontal axis indicates the time difference between the microphones in milliseconds and the\n\nscale on the vertical axis indicates the position (width) in degrees of the sound source to be recorded.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe first step is to select a distance between the sound source(s) and the microphone setup. Please note that the ideal distance from the microphone pair to the sound source depends on not only the type and size of the sound source and on the surroundings in which the recording is to be made but also on individual preference.\n\nThe balance between the direct sound and diffuse soundfield in a recording is of crucial importance. Therefore, considerable time should be used in establishing the optimal positioning of the microphones.\n\nBe aware, that all directional information from the room will be reproduced in front of you in a 2-channel stereo playback system. Consequently, placement of the AB setup closer than initially expected may give a more appropriate direct-to-diffuse sound balance. It is also here the versatility of an AB Stereo Kit can be considered. Using the different acoustical modification devices for the microphones, the amount of ambiance and the tonal color of the recording can be adjusted without adding any noise. The choice of floor and ceiling mounting of the stereo boom gives you added flexibility when positioning the microphones. Remember also to listen via the microphones. The microphones way of picking up sound is different from your ears.\n\nOmnidirectional microphones and AB Stereo are often preferred when the distance between the microphone and the sound source is large. This is because omnidirectional microphones can capture the true low frequencies of the sound source regardless of distance, while directional microphones are influenced by the proximity effect. Directional microphones will therefore typically exhibit a loss of low frequencies at larger distances.\n\nNow we turn to diagram, (fig. 7): Measure the angle at which the sound source(s) can be observed, normally called the recording angle. If the total angle is 140° this should be referred to as ±70 °. Now, decide on the reproduction angle and find the related distance between the microphones.\n\nFig. 7 The diagram to determine the distance between two omni microphones for the AB setup.\n\nExample: The recording angle is ±70°. The outer limits of the recording angle should be reproduced at ±30° (time difference approximately 1.1 ms). The crossing point is marked (•): Hence, the spacing (d) should be 40 cm (16 in).\n\nSetups for stereo: XY\n\nFig. 8 XY setup\n\nXY stereo recording uses a coincident pair of directional- or bidirectional, angled microphones. Hence, the directional information is obtained solely from the level difference between signals.\n\nIn practice, “coincident” means that the microphone capsules must be placed close and normally slightly above each other (fig. 8).\n\nPlease note: Avoid the microphones touching each other as this might cause mechanical noise. Fig. 9 shows a typical arrangement of two cardioid microphones on a boom.\n\nFig. 9 Mounting the microphones closely but without any physical contact.\n\nThe XY setup provides a stable directional image but produces a slightly weaker impression of space and reverb compared to the AB setup.\n\nBe aware, that directional microphones exhibit low-frequency loss at larger distances and will result in a lack of richness and energy in sound color. Contrary to AB, there are no comb filtering effects summing XY signals to mono.\n\nProcedure\n\nIn the most commonly used XY setup, a pair of first-order cardioid microphones is arranged at a 90° angle (±45°).\n\nOther angles than 90° may apply for an XY setup, causing a change of the recording angle. If you want your sound image to fill-out the space between the loudspeakers, the rule is: The wider the sound source, the narrower the angle between microphones. Or: The more width-limited the sound source is, the broader angle between microphones.\n\nThe diagram below (fig. 10) shows the relation between microphone angles, position (width) of the sound source and reproduction angles. A red mark indicates coverage of 180° (±90°) sound source when the angle between the microphones is 90°. This is known as a standard XY-setup.\n\nWhen recording a single source, a vocal for instance, do not try to stretch the sound image from speaker to speaker. In this case, the voice should stay right in the middle. The ambiance around the voice distributes across the front.\n\nFig. 10 Set of curves to determine the angle between two cardioid microphones for XY setup. The red dot marks the 90° standard angling between the microphones.\n\nAs mentioned, bidirectional microphones (figure-of-eight characteristic) are also used in XY setups. Fig. 11 shows a set of curves providing the relation between microphone angles, position (width) of the sound source, and reproduction angles. The red mark indicates the coverage of a sound stage being 70° (±35°) wide. The angle between the microphones is 90°. This specific setup is called the Blumlein-setup, described by the English engineer Alan Dover Blumlein. The idea for this setup came from his work with antennas (spotting submarines during WWII).\n\nFig. 11 Set of curves to determine the angle between two bidirectional microphones (or a particular arrangement utilizing four cardioid microphones) for XY setup. The red dot indicates the Blumlein setting.\n\nBidirectional antennas – and bidirectional microphones – are sensitive in two directions. However, if the front lobe is in-phase with the input, the back loop is, per definition, out-of-phase. Blumlein’s idea regarding the antennas was to take advantage of both level and phase to describe signals in a 360° view. When it comes to two-channel stereo-sound, basically only reproduction of the in-phase signals (±45°) is correct. Rear sounds (135°-225°) are presented in front of the listener. The sound fields on the sides are reproduced out of phase. Nevertheless, the Blumlein setup is popular because it provides a fair resolution of the frontal sound stage and adds some interesting ambiance.\n\nFig. 12 Fig. 12 Set of curves that show the level difference and phase between two bidirectional microphones angled ±45° (Blumlein) dependent on the sound source position. The dashed lines in the grayed area indicate that the reproduced sound is out of phase. The full line in the grayed area indicates that sound from the back is in phase and thus will be reproduced in the front.\n\nNote: It is possible to create a figure-of-eight polar pattern from two cardioid microphones, see fig 13. The microphone pointing to the rear must be phase reversed (swap pin 2 & 3). The two microphones are routed to the same channel.\n\nFig. 13 Here, two cardioids replace a figure-of-eight microphone. Two microphone inputs are needed in principle. However, you can “cheat” by using a Y-sum cable with pin 2 and 3 reversed in one microphone connector.\n\nFig. 14 DUA0019 Spacer for microphone boom."
