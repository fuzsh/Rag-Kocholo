The point is to have 3 images in this panel: 1 large and 2 small (the 2 smalls would be stacked on each other just the right of the large one).\n\nAnd I want to be able to do this in the HTML:\n\n<div class='imagepanel1-2'> <img class='large' src='blahblah'> <img class='small' src='blahblah'> <img class='small' src='blahblah'> </div>\n\nIn the CSS the 'large' and 'small' subclasses would control the widths and heights of the images, and the 'imagepanel1-2' would control the orientation. Also, there should be 1 pixel empty space between each image in the panel. Is what I am describing possible?"
