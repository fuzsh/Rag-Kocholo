That works ok.\n\n@espiegel123 said:\n\n@Tones4Christ said:\n\nGoing to try this feature as my layout got really tiny compared to portrait mode. This is on iPhone.\n\nWhen creating a layout on the phone, if you are creating for landscape , you don’t want a lot of rows. The editor scales everything to fit. So things look tiny if you you have as many rows as columns.\n\nIn landscape, you can have many columns without things being tiny but only about two rows."
