        "text": "Making complex edits to your photos and videos from your phone just got easier thanks to four new AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nThese updates build on the AI technology from Google Research behind tools like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur, incorporating new technology and techniques — like generative AI — to open up more editing possibilities. These new features let you focus more on what matters most with your photos and videos — from getting the perfect group shot that captures everyone with their eyes open to reducing distracting sounds in your favorite videos.\n\nPerfect your group photos with Best Take\n\nIf you’re trying to take a group photo, even if you take multiple shots, chances are someone is always looking away or blinking — we’ve all been there, especially if you’ve ever tried to take a photo with kids. To take the stress out of getting that perfect group shot, the new Best Take feature in Google Photos uses a series of similar photos taken close together to help you automatically create a blended image with everyone’s best expression. If you prefer another expression, you can manually select another look from the other photos you took to get the group photo you want.\n\nReimagine your photos with Magic Editor\n\nEarlier this year, we announced Magic Editor, a new experimental editing experience coming to Google Photos that uses generative AI to help you easily make complex edits and bring your photos in line with how you remember a moment. Want to resize or reposition your subject? Just tap or circle the object you want to edit, then drag to reposition it or pinch to resize it. You can also use contextual suggestions to improve the lighting and background, like changing a gray sky to a golden-hour sunset. Plus, after you select an edit, Magic Editor will give you multiple result options to choose from so you can get the look you want.\n\nMagic Editor is a new experience from Labs in its early stages, and we know there are going to be times when the result isn’t exactly what you imagined. Your feedback is going to be critical in helping us improve the product over time so you can get the best edits possible. This is just the beginning, and we plan to add more intuitive generative AI features to Magic Editor in the future to help you bring your photos to life in new ways."
