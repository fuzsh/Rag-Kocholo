        "text": "No life can emerge in chaos - for life to emerge the environment has to be orderly. Organisms have to adapt to their environment, meaning optimise (or satisfice) output in light of input. In a patternless environment, there is no chance doing so.\n\nOur brain evolved in light of this - we constantly learn and update what the \"norm\" is - let it be there's light if it's day or the hair colour of your partner. Equally, the brain constantly compares stimuli to the norm - if it's all good, no action needed, but a deviation from the norm shall raise an alarm bell.\n\nThus, we are 'programmed' to ignore what's normal, and be alert to the abnormal. Perhaps the most famous example of it is the sound of mechanical clock, which is simply not perceived once we spend enough time in the room it is in.\n\nIn your specific case, seeing the same image for a prolong time results in it becoming a norm in our brain, resulting in reduced brain activity.\n\nIt is difficult to examine this phenomenon because we would have to define what it means to have a \"fresh look\" and how we could measure it. It is an interesting observation though. Here are a few possibilities for how we might interpret what's going on here, with some references to related cognitive science research.\n\nOne obvious point is that we recognise things more slowly when they are upside down. This is particularly well known in face recognition, but there are also (smaller) inversion effects in other types of stimuli such as scenes. This is often taken as evidence that when we encode or recognise something, we are not just remembering the pieces separately but are doing some sort of \"holistic\" processing which fits them together. In this case, you could say that when you turn the picture you take longer to recognise it, or that you see it as novel, and that makes you view it in a \"fresh\" way. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jesse_Husk/publication/5857415_Inverting_houses_and_textures_Investigating_the_characteristics_of_learned_inversion_effects/links/55dcbc1b08ae83e420ee5038.pdf\n\nA related point is that objects often have a \"canonical orientation\" which we are most used to seeing them from. This has been a point of interest for models of object recognition, which often assumed that our representation is \"view independent\". So if you are painting objects, it certainly would be harder to process if you rotate them from the canonical. http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30745263/pdf699.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&Expires=1472559612&Signature=yDh4VqjQ%2Bsg1ibIebSzKt4fMvmM%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DOrientation_dependence_in_the_recognitio.pdf\n\nAs we might expect from the above, viewing something from a different orientation does actually change the things that we pay attention to and look at. For example, people make frequent horizontal eye movements when looking at landscapes, but if you rotate the image they seem to make a different pattern and may be drawn to different things. http://supersaturated.com/papers/pdfs/horizonSaccade.pdf\n\nhttp://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2158151"
