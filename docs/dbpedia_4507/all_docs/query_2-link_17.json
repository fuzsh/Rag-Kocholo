        "text": "For photographers, choosing between a portrait or landscape orientation can be tricky.\n\nIn this article, we’ll have a look at portrait vs landscape orientations. We’ll see where they’re used in photography, and when to choose one over the other.\n\nPortrait vs Landscape Orientation in Photography\n\nRobert Cornelius took the first intentional portrait of a human. He was both the subject and photographer. Yep, the first portrait was a selfie.\n\nCornelius took his image in portrait orientation.\n\nFrom there, photography became important for documenting subjects. Both the portrait and landscape orientations were popular.\n\nLook at the works of Peter Henry Emerson, William Henry Jackson and Carleton Watkins. These famous landscape photographers used both portrait and landscape formats.\n\nIn the studio, photographers like Julia Margaret Cameron, Gertrude Kasebier and Mathew Brady preferred the portrait orientation. This matched well with the dimensions of the human body.\n\nPhotographers like Imogen Cunningham took portraits and still lifes characterised by intricate tonality.\n\nEdward Weston photographed a variety of subjects with unexpected camera orientations. Henri Cartier-Bresson’s masterful street photographs included both portrait and landscape formats.\n\nPhotography today sees photographers move between portrait and landscape orientations with ease. Whether in their Instagram feeds or photo galleries, you can find a variety of styles.\n\nHendrik Kerstens uses portrait orientations in his ethereal depictions of human subjects.\n\nCindy Sherman also makes extensive use of the portrait format. She explores the visual exchange between the sitter and the viewer.\n\nKim Keever and Wolfgang Tillmans have photographed their subjects in both portrait and landscape orientations. Each uses the dimensions of the abstraction to dictate the image format.\n\nBill Henson often works within a landscape format. He uses generous amounts of dark, negative space.\n\nAnd Annie Leibovitz uses a mix of portrait and landscape orientated portraits. Her choice depends on context, narrative and creative process.\n\nMaking the Choice – Landscape and Format Orientations\n\nSo what can we learn from the historic use of landscape and portrait orientations in art?\n\nThere are many things to consider when choosing between portrait or landscape. These include subject dimensions, cropping, emphasis, formality, and final presentation.\n\nIt sounds like a lot. But once you familiarise yourself with the concepts, the decision becomes much clearer.\n\nSubject Dimension\n\nAdjusting the camera orientation to fit a subject has become almost instinctual. This is the beauty of modern photography.\n\nKeep in mind the dimensions of your subject. This will allow you to make informed choices about image format.\n\nThe portrait orientation allows you to photograph vertical subjects in full.\n\nYou can capture horizontal ones in their entirety with the use of the landscape format.\n\nCropping\n\nChanging the image orientation is a way to crop out undesirable elements in a photograph. You can do this either in-camera or in post-processing.\n\nChanging from a portrait to a landscape orientation adjusts the flow of a photograph. It removes superfluous vertical aspects.\n\nGoing from a landscape to a portrait format creates a sense of formality within a photograph. You can use it to narrow in on a particular concept or subject.\n\nEmphasis\n\nThe orientation of a photograph can reinforce your subject. It tells the viewer what should take visual priority within in an image.\n\nLines, shapes and forms behave differently under the emphasis of differing orientations.\n\nA landscape format creates space, highlighting horizontal elements within a photograph.\n\nA portrait orientation is restrained and upright, invigorating vertical elements.\n\nChoose a format that fits your subject’s qualities. This will create a harmonious image.\n\nAn orientation that opposes the flow of the image can create visual tension. This can stimulate energetic visual movement. It’s a great technique to use if you want to create drama.\n\nFormality\n\nFormality defines the perceived rigidity of a photograph.\n\nA formal image is read with a tendency towards the academic. It evokes impressions of a precise, systematic formula.\n\nA landscape image is more fluid and flexible, leaving a viewer to consume an image at their own pace.\n\nBoth ends of the scale have roots in their predominant usage throughout history.\n\nThe portrait orientation evokes impressions of height, portraiture, and prestige.\n\nLandscape orientations bring to mind swaths of landscape imagery, rest and space. It can convey impressions of relaxation, rhythm, and immersion.\n\nPresentation\n\nYou might be presenting your image digitally or in print. Orientation will impact the way viewers look at your image.\n\nIf you plan on hanging your photography, the first aspect to consider is available room.\n\nWill the portrait/landscape image you are photographing fit in the desired location? If not, you may need to alter your orientation.\n\nPresenting images in a single orientation creates order and fluidity. Mixing landscape and portrait orientations together can appear spontaneous and energetic.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the beginning of photography, photographers have been using image format as a tool. It allows them to expand upon the confines of the fixed image.\n\nTake subject dimension, cropping, emphasis, formality and final presentation into account. This will help you select the most appropriate image format and easily choose between portrait vs landscape format. It’ll reinforce your imagery with informed compositional choices."
