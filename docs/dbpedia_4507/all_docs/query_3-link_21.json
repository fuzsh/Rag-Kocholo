        "text": "Direction in anatomy\n\nToday human anatomy is regarded as being a complete science. The “what is where” of the human body is largely known. But remember as you struggle to learn anatomical names and location of body parts that it took about 3600 years to make it as ‘complete’ a science as it is.\n\nThere is still individual and age variation in human body structure to be considered. And anatomists are still working out the brain’s cellular anatomy.\n\nAncient anatomists describing mobile structures needed reference points upon which to base their description of “what is where”.\n\nA uniform description of three-dimensional anatomic orientation was devised in early studies, and it was largely kept and expanded upon. It is easier to communicate when everyone uses the same words.\n\nHuman anatomic position\n\nA first issue to arise in naming human parts was the number of positions that flexible human bodies can acquire. A single position was needed that could be used as a reference for describing where the pieces were relative to each other.\n\nThat single position became known as the human anatomical position and is displayed by this skeleton. No matter what position a cadaver assumed, all descriptions were extrapolated back to where the body part would be in the anatomical position.\n\nIt takes a bit of imagination and focus to transfer what you are looking at into the anatomical position of another person. That is, a standing person, head and eyes facing forward, feet together, arms to side, palms of hands facing forward.\n\nThe directional term lateral is used as a modifier for both sides of the body, left lateral and right lateral. As opposed to lateral, the term median is used to define a point in the center of the organism. The word medial used as a descriptive means toward the median plane of the person.\n\nIn the anatomic position, palms forward, the radius bone lies lateral, and the ulna bone is medial. With rotation of the forearm as the palms turn toward the back, the radius moves to a medial position and the ulna is then lateral.\n\nBilateral symmetry\n\nHumans are said to have bilateral symmetry. That means the halves of the body formed by a theoretical median plane, shown below in red, divides the body into two parts. that are mirror images of each other.\n\nHuman hands shown below illustrate human bilateral symmetry. The symmetry applies only to the body’s shape, not to its internal organ structure.\n\nWho’s right and left?\n\nProblems with assessing right and left arise if you do not remember that for a person you are facing right and left may be reversed. Only if both of you are facing the same direction do right and left align.\n\nTo get answers correct on anatomy practical exams, it is identification of the right and left body part that is important. Some of us become confused with the issue of right and left, because we are so accustomed to mirror images of ourselves.\n\nIt is easy to forget that our mirror image is the reverse of our real self. Some people are uncomfortable with pictures of themselves because a picture is not their mirror image.\n\nThe fire truck pictured below displays an awareness of the importance of the mirror image of a written sign. Notice the word ‘FIRE’ is written forward for oncoming traffic, and backward in its mirror image for drivers who see it in their car’s mirrors.\n\nPosition of appendages\n\nAppendages, arms, legs, and pelvis require another set of directional terms to describe their position relative to the torso. One of the terms, proximal describes the point where the appendage joins the torso. The other term, distal is used for the point farthest from the place of attachment of the appendage to the torso.\n\nProximal and distal are often used as relative terms. For example, the elbow (shown above) is proximal to the hand . . .the elbow is closer to where the arm attaches to the torso than the hand is. But the elbow is distal to the shoulder . . .the elbow is in a position further away from the torso than the shoulder joint.\n\nMore human orientation descriptors\n\nIn the scheme of other human orientation descriptors, anterior is toward the front while posterior is toward the back. Superior is toward the head. The opposite term, inferior, is a relative descriptor generally used to mean below some other body part.\n\nInternal body organs are described as superficial meaning near the body surface, or deep meaning internal and away from the surface.\n\nTo summarize\n\nIn most anatomy courses these human body orientation descriptors are learned early in the instruction. They are learned in isolation. Because anatomy descriptors appear easy you may not want to focus much of your precious time studying them. It all seems so obvious that it is natural to think, “I know that”.\n\nOrientation descriptors are not used a lot until your instructor hands out long lists of muscles, nerves, and blood vessels to be learned. By then your memory of orientation descriptors may be lost in the fog of too many facts accumulated since the descriptors were last learned.\n\nThe trick is to avoid blowing off these terms early in your study of anatomy. Make friends with them instead. Practice describing all body structures you learn with these descriptors. It may feel strange at first but sticking with it will pay off.\n\nFor example, when learning bones, you can decide whether the human sternum (colored set of bones) is located anterior or posterior, inferior, or superior to the pelvis, medial or right lateral or left lateral when the body is in the anatomic position. In doing this, you will remember why you do not use the terms proximal and distal to locate the sternum.\n\nDo this, and when it comes time to learn names and locations of muscles, nerves, blood vessels you will be way ahead of your classmates.\n\nThere is a comment box below where I hope you will tell me if knowing the logic behind anatomical descriptions of orientation helps you remember and use them properly.

Please tell me what areas of anatomy you find the most frustrating.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nHuman Body Muscles\n\nAnatomy Lab Tests\n\nDo you have questions?\n\nPlease put your questions in the comment box or send them to me by email at DrReece@MedicalScienceNavigator.com.
