        "text": "Want to know the Facebook ad size and design specs for every Facebook ad format and placement? Look no further since we have it all here.\n\nFacebook offers online marketers a large selection of ad formats and placements featuring images, videos, and text to achieve all their different objectives. However, different ad formats and placements have different specs for image and video formats and sizes.\n\nUsing the best Facebook ad sizes and Facebook ads specs is crucial for achieving your goals and maximizing your results.\n\nTherefore, we decided to organize all the necessary information for you in one place. This article contains all the up-to-date specs for every kind of ad Facebook and Instagram offer.\n\nMeta News Feed - ad size & specs\n\nThe News Feed is the primary real estate for ads on Facebook and Instagram. You can show there any kind of ad: single image, single video, carousel, etc. Facebook ad sizes are different from Instagram's. Below you can find all the design specifications needed for Facebook and Instagram feed ads.\n\nFacebook News Feed Single Image\n\nFacebook Single Image ad is the oldest form of Facebook advertising. It supports a brief write-up, headlines, and a single picture with a link. You can use this ad for all ad objectives apart from those associated with videos.\n\nFacebook Feed image specifications\n\nRecommended Facebook ad image size: The best size for a Facebook ad is at least 1080 x 1080 pixels, but it's best to use the highest resolution that meets the ratio requirements since there is no maximum resolution.\n\nRecommended Facebook ad aspect ratio: 1.91:1 to 1:1. In general, ratios from 1.91:1 to 4:5 are supported. However, if you include a link, launch an Offer ad, or use stock images, you'll be limited to a ratio of 1.91:1.\n\nMinimum Facebook ad dimensions: 600 x 600 pixels.\n\nRecommended file types: JPG or PNG.\n\nMaximum file size: 30 MB.\n\nAspect ratio tolerance: 3%.\n\nPanorama and 360Â° photos: you can also use panorama or 360Â° photos as image ads to create an interactive experience. Facebook automatically recognizes such photos through camera-specific metadata. You can check their article to learn which devices and apps you can use to create panoramic photos for Facebook ads.\n\nFacebook ad character limit\n\nPrimary text: Up to 125 characters will appear on the ad's preview. However, you are allowed to write longer pieces of ad copy. The viewer will see the rest when they click \"See More.\"\n\nHeadline: Up to 27 characters. You can go beyond this limit but the text may be truncated.\n\nLink description: Up to 27 characters. You can go beyond this limit but the text may be truncated.\n\nInstagram Feed Single Image -Instagram ad specs\n\nImages are exactly what Instagram was made for, so you'd definitely want to use this platform to your benefit by placing image ads in its feed.\n\nInstagram image specs\n\nRecommended resolution: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels, but it's best to use the highest resolution that meets the ratio requirements since there is no maximum resolution.\n\nRecommended image ratio: 1:1. Image ratios from 16:9 to 9:16 are supported, but your image may be masked to 1:1.\n\nAspect ratio tolerance: 1%\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels.\n\nMaximum file size: 30MB\n\nAspect ratio: From 400 x 500 to 191 x 100.\n\nRecommended file types: JPG or PNG.\n\nInstagram text limits\n\nPrimary text: Up to 125 characters will appear on the ad's preview. The viewer will be able to see the rest when clicking \"more.\"\n\nHeadline: Up to 40 characters. You can go beyond this limit but the text may be truncated.\n\nMaximum Number of Hashtags: 30\n\nFacebook News Feed Single Video\n\nVideo ads have become very common in most online advertising platforms, and they are constantly gaining more and more traffic. They are similar to Facebook Single Image ads, only that they use videos instead of static images. Some campaign objectives allow you to use 360Â° videos in your Facebook ads.\n\nFacebook audiences also like videos because they are much more engaging. In addition, you can read some more of our articles to learn more about video ads and how to leverage them to create engaging poll ads.\n\nHere's how you get the right Facebook ads video size.\n\nFacebook video specs\n\nRecommended Facebook ad aspect ratio: 1:1 for desktop or mobile, 4:5 for mobile-only ads. Ratios from 16:9 to 9:16 are supported, but they may be masked to 4:5 on mobile. On the desktop, the video will be shown with a 1:1 aspect ratio.

With playable ads, you can target high-intent users across Facebook and the Audience Network, where the user can try out the app before buying it. This ad type offers an experience.\n\nThese ads are a combination of 3 parts:\n\nA lead-in video to introduce your demo with âTry Nowâ to indicate the ad is interactive.\n\nA full-screen game demo the user can interact with without installing anything\n\nA call-to-action to install the app from the App Store or Google Pay Store.\n\nPlayable HTML5 asset specs\n\nFile format: The Playable game should be in HTML5, and the file extensions must be âhtmlâ or âhtm.â A single HTML file should contain all compressed assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, and sounds.)Â\n\nMaximum file size: 2MB\n\nPlayables must not: require mraid.js, make an HTTP request, or contain any JavaScript redirect.Â\n\nPlayable ads must have a responsive design to show across all devices and screen resolutions.\n\nFormat: Playables should be in portrait orientation\n\nPlayables must include: the JavaScript function âFbPlayableAd.onCTAClick()â for when a person interacts with the call-to-action button so they end up at the correct app store page.\n\nNo dynamic asset loading through an external network is permitted.\n\nPro tip:\n\nTo combine into one file: encode the image into base64 string, and integrate js into index.html.\n\nPlayable Zip file specs\n\nPlayable ads in zip file formats are supported on all placements on iOS and Android.\n\nZip file structure: The zip file must have an index.html file at the root, e.g. ./index.html. Resources can be placed anywhere in the file structure as long as theyâre referenced correctly according to the index.html.

On other Audience Network placements, no lead-in video is shown.\n\nInstant Experience (formerly Canvas) - Facebook ad size & specs\n\nInstant Experience is no longer a standalone ad format. It now serves as another landing page option (destination), where you can send people who click on your ads without forcing them to leave Facebook.\n\nConsidering this is a mobile-optimized experience inside Facebook, its main advantage over traditional landing pages is the loading speed.\n\nThe Ads Manager offers different templates for Instant Experience. But while it's customizable, Facebook still has some recommendations for the cover image or video:Â\n\nâIf you want to use a cover image: the recommended width is 1080 pixels.\n\nIf you want to use a cover video: the recommended file type is MOV and MP4, while the recommended length is less than 2 minutes.\n\nAdditional Facebook ad placements\n\nFacebook offers even more ad placements for you to reach different audiences, and each has its own Facebook ad size and specs.\n\nMarketplace - Facebook ad size & specs\n\nYou can post your product or service for sale on Facebook Marketplace but you can also use ads to promote it on this platform.\n\nThe main advantage of advertising on Facebook Marketplace is the possibility to reach an audience intending to make purchases.\n\nSpecifically, Facebook Marketplace is extremely efficient for selling products or services locally.\n\nImage specs\n\nFacebook Marketplace image size: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels, but it's best to use the highest Facebook Marketplace photo size that meets the ratio requirements since there is no maximum resolution.\n\nRecommended Facebook ad aspect ratio: 1:1.
