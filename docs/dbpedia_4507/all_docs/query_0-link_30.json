        "text": "* Photoshop is available in select computer labs on campus, including the Mac computers in the Library.\n\nTo resize an image in Photoshop:\n\nOpen your image in Photoshop.\n\nGo to “Image,” located at the top of the window.\n\nSelect “Image Size.”\n\nA new window will open.\n\nTo maintain the proportions of your image, click the box next to “Constrain Proportions”.\n\nUnder “Document Size”:\n\nSelect “inches” for the unit of measurement.\n\nCheck that the resolution is no lower than “200 pixels/inch”, however “300 pixels/inch” is ideal for printing.\n\nInput the width and height you desire.\n\nIf your original image has different proportions than your desired print size, it will be necessary to crop your image after resizing it (see below).\n\nClick, “OK.”\n\nSave your file.\n\nTip! If you want to keep your original file, select “Save As” and name your image something different from the original.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, contact Print & Copy Services at copyservices@pugetsound.edu or 253.879.3737."
