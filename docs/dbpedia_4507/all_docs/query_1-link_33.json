        "text": "If you’ve come across the term aspect ratio or video aspect ratio while in the process of creating content for your business but weren’t sure what it meant, you are not alone. But it’s time to change all that.\n\nIn this article, we review the importance of understanding the different social media aspect ratio requirements, as well as how your video’s final format plays a role in how your photo and video content comes out on various platforms. We will also cover different social media size requirements and how to easily change aspect ratios for your videos. We will look at Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube’s video aspect ratios and more.\n\nWhat Is Aspect Ratio?\n\nAspect ratio is defined as the width of a picture or video frame in relation to its height. In essence, it is the proportion of your content asset—or, put more simply, its final shape: horizontal, vertical, or square.\n\nFor example, a square image has an aspect ratio of 1:1. The image resolution could be 500 x 500, 800 x 800, or 1200 x 1200, but the aspect ratio will still remain 1:1. This means that a very small image can share the same aspect ratio as a large one. Think of a Facebook profile pic compared to an Instagram feed; one is smaller than the other in resolution, but they share the same 1:1 aspect ratio and square shape.\n\nUnderstanding Aspect Ratios\n\nThe term “aspect ratio” is really a professional way of describing a shape, kind of like a picture frame that comes in different formats. The way the aspect ratio is calculated in our digital world today makes it seem super complicated, but really it’s not. In a nutshell, the aspect ratio is the shape of your image or video as it appears on your screen.\n\nIt is very helpful and even crucial to understand aspect ratios when creating online content. Without it, the content you upload can look downright bad. Do your videos ever look distorted or stretched? It might be because you don’t know the difference between the 1:1, 16:9, and 4:3 aspect ratios and where they are best used.\n\nWhy Is Video Aspect Ratio Important?\n\nAs we discussed above, the aspect ratio is important because it influences how your photos and videos will look when you share them on different platforms. Understanding the different aspect ratios will make sharing on various social media sites easier. It will also ensure your content visibility is optimal. Here are a few key benefits of using the right aspect ratio for your content.\n\nAvoids Image or Video Distortion\n\nIt is crucial to understand the aspect ratio when showcasing a specific item or subject. Have you ever searched on a photo site looking for a particular theme or topic and found the perfect image, but when you shared it on a specific platform like Instagram, the picture didn’t fit? The aspect ratio also affects how we showcase our subject material when we want a specific image or shot centered or in the background.\n\nFor example, you might have an image or video of a headshot, except when you upload it to Instagram, it appears too large, or it has black bars surrounding it. This is because the image’s aspect ratio is not formatted to the platform you are sharing it on for optimal viewing. The solution is to reformat the image or video to Instagram’s standard shape of 1:1.\n\nHas an Impact on the Design\n\nAspect ratio and design go hand in hand. The aspect ratio will affect how and where you add text to your video or captions to a photo. It makes a big difference when it comes to creating content to share on social media.\n\nAn additional thing to keep in mind is that if you want to combine an image with video footage for a promotional video, the image might have a different aspect ratio than the video. When you go to publish the video, the image will be distorted or not properly centered. This problem is simple to fix by resizing your image. With the right online tool, you can effortlessly adjust the aspect ratio of the image to be in alignment with the video.\n\nPrevents Letterboxes\n\nLetterboxes are the black bars you used to see when using older TV screens showing new movies shot at a different aspect ratio. They can also show up on mobile devices when the video uploaded doesn’t match the aspect ratio of the platform it is shared to. Some will know these as cinematic bars. If your uploaded content appears with letterboxes, that means you need to change the aspect ratio. Some people get the aspect ratio of their footage confused when we start talking about the ratio of a screen. To keep it simple, just remember that aspect ratio is really just the shape. So, for example, most televisions have a screen in the shape of 16:9 today, which essentially means “horizontal,” and mobile phones have a screen aspect ratio of 9:16, which means “vertical.”\n\nWhy is this important? Because social media outlets take this into account when creating their platforms. Take Instagram, for example—when they created their platform in 2012, users could only upload photos in a 1:1 or square shape. As a result, users who wanted to post landscape and portrait photos had to crop their pictures into a square or use other apps for workarounds.\n\nToday, all the major social media platforms have adjusted to meet their users’ various formatting needs, but you will often run into complications (like black bars or distorted images) that can be easily fixed if you have a basic understanding of the problem.\n\nThe black bars (known as “letterboxes”) are the platforms’ method of formatting footage to ensure it retains its original shape, even if the screen is not that same shape. Remember, think about the black bars on the top and bottom of a TV screen when you’re watching a film recorded in widescreen format. Using the right photo (or video) aspect ratio will prevent any letterbox situations.\n\nAspect Ratio and Video Resolution\n\nAspect ratio and resolution both refer to the frame size and are often confused with each other. Whether you’re an avid video maker or a novice, knowing some basic information about aspect ratio and resolution will prove helpful when uploading to the web.\n\nThe resolution of an image is the total number of pixels displayed on your screen. Resolution measures how many pixels an image contains. To get the resolution, you would multiply the width times the height. The bigger the resolution, the more defined the image, and the bigger your file in terms of megabytes (or gigabytes).\n\nSo, for example, you could have two videos, both filmed in full HD, that have the exact same resolution (number of pixels) but different aspect ratios (width and height of the video). One could be showing in horizontal 16:9 (aspect ratio) and one showing in vertical 9:16 (aspect ratio), but both could have 1920 x 1080 resolution.\n\nPractical Social Media Examples\n\nLet’s take it further. Again, perhaps you have one image you want to share on two different platforms like Facebook Stories and Instagram. The best shape for Facebook stores is 9:16 (vertical), because they are primarily viewed on mobile devices. However, Instagram typically uses a square aspect ratio. The image resolution could be full HD (1920 x 1080), but you can change the aspect ratio to fit the platforms or where the content is being posted. You can format the same image to a different aspect ratio for Pinterest too, which generally requires a 2:3 aspect ratio.\n\nWhat exactly does all of this mean? Aspect ratio and resolution go hand-in-hand and play an essential part in video production, especially when uploading videos to different social media platforms.\n\nHow Aspect Ratio Can Affect Your Viewing Experience\n\nWe have already explained the difference between aspect ratio and resolution. Now we understand that we can have two videos with the exact same high-quality resolution but different shapes due to the screen size on different devices. Thus, the primary issue with aspect ratio is a distorted image or the appearance of black bars on either side when viewing.\n\nMatching Aspect Ratios to Video Resolution\n\nToday, the most common video resolutions are HD, full HD, 4K, and 8K. Distorted videos and black bars in a video happen when the video aspect ratio and the screen size and/or orientation don’t match. Also, if the video resolution is lower than the screen resolution, you could also get bars on the bottom. In any case, no matter the video resolution, you will always be restricted to the maximum resolution of the viewing screen.\n\nFor instance, a video filmed in 1080p will still only give you 1080p resolution, even if you have an 8K monitor with a high resolution. Conversely, if your monitor is 1080p and you have a video filmed in 4K, the video resolution will still be 1080p when it plays.\n\nIt’s possible to change the video resolution if you find it necessary. Some excellent video converters can help with video formatting; try the ones here. However, it’s as easy as editing the aspect ratio to the desired size for the viewing device most of the time. A good video maker like Promo.com will do the trick in a few simple steps.\n\nAspect Ratios in 2023\n\nSince the dawn of the first widescreen film, Old Ironsides, in 1926, we have come a long way in the viewing quality of our devices and screens. Not too long ago, all we had was a square television with a 4:3 ratio screen shape. Today, we have mobile phones, smart pads, and widescreen TVs. Thankfully, this isn’t such a big deal, because YouTube, Facebook, and other social media channels are the new TV of this generation.\n\nIn fact, studies show that around 62% of the population watches videos on their mobile devices. Much of the content is on YouTube; however, social media sites today are also primarily video-based.\n\nPopular Aspect Ratios\n\nAmong the most popular social media sites, the most common ratio shapes are 16:9, 4:3, and 1:1. Aspect ratios are critical for web content, because different images require various shapes for different uses, e.g., desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. Facebook.\n\nIt is important to note that most social media platforms allow many varying aspect ratios, but not all will perform well for different distributions. For example, a Facebook banner ad is a different shape than a Facebook Story. Each platform has the best practices for various content sizes and ratios listed in each social media section of this article.\n\nUsing the correct aspect ratios ensures your images are displayed as intended without distortion or resolution loss. Let’s take a quick look at the common uses for all of them.\n\n9:16 Aspect Ratio\n\nThere is no question that this video aspect ratio is one of the most popular on social media. Whether it’s Facebook, Instagram Stories, or watching videos on TikTok, this vertical shape is primarily used because we see everything on our phones today.\n\n1:1 Aspect Ratio\n\nA 1:1 ratio is a square. This means that an image’s width and height are equal. Some common 1:1 ratios are an 8 x 8-inch photo, a 1080 x 1080-pixel image, or general social media profile picture templates. This shape ratio is also common for print photographs and mobile screens.\n\n16:9 Aspect Ratio\n\nA 16:9 ratio is generally used for viewing presentation slides, widescreen TVs, or computer monitors. The 16:9 ratio replaced the previous 4:3 ratio for monitors and TV screens as TVs evolved and changed their shape, thereby creating a slimmer, more elongated rectangular device. Common video resolutions in the 16:9 ratio are 1920 x 1080 pixels and 1280 x 720 pixels. Most social platforms support this shape.\n\n4:3 Aspect Ratio\n\n4:3 resolution is fading quickly, but it is not yet entirely obsolete. You can still get certain GoPros or different action cameras that give you 4:3 modes. The common resolutions are generally from 640p x 480p to 1600p x 1200p and a range in between. The 4:3 aspect ratio is becoming less common as our technology has advanced and is being replaced by 1:1.\n\nWhich Aspect Ratio Should You Use?\n\nDetermining what is driving your project and message is vital in deciding which photo aspect ratio you should use. If you are sharing your video or image across social media platforms, you need to decide on your video aspect ratio in advance. The biggest question you should be asking yourself is this: “What platform am I intending to use this content for, and in what format?”\n\nUsing Different Aspect Ratios in the Same Video\n\nSometimes, we want to combine a couple different clips together with different aspect ratios or resolutions. It’s possible to merge them with a good video maker. Likewise, you can use different aspect ratios in a video, as the editor will add the bars required to make it work. Still, when you render out a final video, it will have a set resolution and a fixed aspect ratio.\n\nAspect Ratio & Smartphones\n\nToday, there is no question that vertical video is on the rise. With the increase of video viewing on smartphones and social media channels, aspect ratios have shifted to a vertical direction. Instagram’s standard square 1:1 ratio shape is excellent for close-ups of people’s faces, but it cannot capture the panoramic views we take with our advanced cameras today.\n\nMobile phone usage has driven the 9:16 vertical shape into broader acceptance. Additionally, many people are creating vertical short films and videos for various purposes. Using video to promote small businesses and education has gained immense popularity with the rise of social media.\n\nHow to Change Video Aspect Ratio\n\nThere are many platforms available today that allow creators to toggle between a variety of aspect ratios with video resizing tools. Therefore, figuring out what shape ratio to use is not as difficult as it might sound. However, it is critical to understand what aspect ratio is and how to change it to achieve optimal engagement.\n\nOne of the best methods of changing the aspect ratio for any platform or website is utilizing online image tools and video makers. In addition, it is convenient to have all of your brand’s content assets in one place that can be accessed straight from your browser.\n\nWhether you need to change a video shape ratio or an image shape ratio, Promo.com can help—and can store all of your videos and images in one place.\n\nTo get a better idea of the options and importance of aspect ratios, let’s take a look at each of the most popular platforms and their ratio requirements.\n\nTo get a better idea of the options and the importance of understanding the aspect ratio, let’s take a look at each of the most popular platforms and their ratio requirements.\n\nThe Best YouTube Video Aspect Ratio\n\nCurrently, YouTube has over 1.9 billion monthly active users, making it second in the world only to Facebook. So there is no doubt that YouTube is a positive way to expand your audience reach.\n\nIt is crucial to provide high-quality videos to achieve high engagement. Consequently, understanding the aspect ratio of YouTube is essential. Poorly filmed or edited videos will probably not engage well, especially with billions of other videos on the platform to compete with. Therefore, understanding the aspect ratio can help you correctly format your footage so that it appears the way you intended online.\n\nYouTube permits uploading videos of various sizes that range from 240p to 4K. However, getting the correct resolution isn’t enough. It is essential to consider your YouTube video size, length, and aspect ratio when uploading videos on YouTube.\n\nThe Proper YouTube Aspect Ratios\n\nThe standard YouTube aspect ratio is 16:19, and the maximum video size is 256GB, or 12 hours, whichever is less with a verified account. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t upload other ratios. 16:9 is just the standard YouTube size. If you choose to use a different shape ratio like 4:3, then YouTube will automatically adjust the footage by adding the black bars (letterboxes).\n\nYouTube Short Aspect Ratio\n\nYouTube short videos, otherwise known as a “YouTube Short,” is YouTube’s solution for the increasing popularity of short-form videos on platforms like TikTok.\n\nYouTube short videos have a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio. YouTube short videos can be up to one minute in length, show up in your vertical feed, and generally take over the entire screen when viewing it on mobile devices. YouTube shorts can also be several 15-second videos combined or one continuous video and stay in your channel forever.\n\nLike TikTok, with YouTube short videos, you can scroll to the following video of an entirely different channel creator for that instant gratification of the next video – it’s highly addicting.\n\nBecause all you need for a YouTube short video is a 9:16 format, a video one minute long or shorter, and the hashtag #YouTube Short, it’s an easy way to promote and share your content or business.\n\nYouTube Story Aspect Ratio\n\nYouTube Stories (previously known as YouTube Reels) and YouTube Shorts are both short-form videos, but they work differently on the platform. When watching a YouTube story, you’re enjoying (hopefully) the story from end to end and remain inside the creator’s channel.\n\nYouTube Stories are shorter videos up to 15 seconds, have a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio, and are viewed on your mobile device.\n\nThe Stories feature is currently in beta and only available to eligible channels with over 10,000 subscribers. In addition, these reels are relatively short-lived because they disappear after seven days unless you save them.\n\nChanging YouTube Video Aspect Ratios\n\nYouTube gives you the option of choosing the size in which you want to view your video when you upload it by making it available in various sizes.\n\nHowever, YouTube also maintains that the speed of your broadband connection and your device greatly determine the screen resolution. Therefore, you can easily change the resolution by accessing the YouTube “Settings” gear icon and selecting the resolution you want under the Quality pop-up menu (or the three dots on a mobile device).\n\nYouTube Aspect Ratio FAQ\n\nWhat’s the Best YouTube Aspect Ratio for Mobile?\n\nThe YouTube app for Android automatically adjusts the player to the size of the video. So whether you have a vertical, square, or horizontal image or video, it will fill the screen.\n\nCan I Upload a Different Aspect Ratio Other than 16:9 on YouTube?\n\nThe standard YouTube aspect ratio is 16:9, but the YouTube player automatically adjusts the shape ratio when streaming or playing a video. There is no need to edit the aspect ratio for YouTube; however, you might want to edit the aspect ratio for the sake of video quality on other platforms.\n\nInstagram Aspect Ratio\n\nWith Instagram Reels for example, it’s important to use the recommended Instagram formats and sizes. In addition, Instagram typically compresses videos and photos during upload, so if you use the optimal resolution, your video quality won’t be affected during the compression process. If not, our Video Compressor is an easy way to ensure you’re on top of quality control for your videos.\n\nThe Instagram aspect ratio allows you to display your video in all three standard formats: a 16:9 widescreen ratio, a 4:5 portrait ratio, or a square 1:1 ratio.\n\nAdditionally, all sizes provide a video resolution range of 1920p to 1080p, but you should bear in mind that if your post size exceeds Instagram’s guidelines, it will automatically adjust your video size.\n\nThere are several ways to post on Instagram, but they all use one of the three standard aspect ratios.\n\nHow to Change Instagram Aspect Ratio\n\nYou might find yourself in a situation where your video is longer than what is allowed for Instagram and does not have the proper aspect ratio. Instagram will trim the footage and crop the shape. If the trim and crop positions are not what you want, it’s easy to fix with an online video trimmer or video cutter.\n\nYou can effortlessly upload your video and use a video maker to precisely trim the footage you want to keep and apply the aspect ratio you need if necessary. Selecting what parts of your footage you want to highlight and applying the correct aspect ratio will help promote engagement, because it gives you control over the video content. Our Instagram Video Maker is a handy tool that allows you to use professional stock videos and images royalty-free, you can also add text, royalty-free music, and ensure that you always download and share your video in the right size.\n\nInstagram Aspect Ratio FAQ\n\nWhat is the largest file size allowed on Instagram?\n\nInstagram video files may be up to 4GB, and Instagram regular post videos can only be 60 seconds long. However, you can upload and trim Instagram videos that are longer than that with a great video maker. You can also reduce the video file size with an online compressor. For Instagram Stories, you can post up to 15 seconds, or up to 60 minutes for a live stream.\n\nAre 1920 x 1080 files ok on Instagram?\n\nInstagram’s aspect ratio allows a 16:9 widescreen ratio, a 4:5 portrait ratio, or a square 1:1 ratio. This means you can upload and display videos that are 1920p x 1080p, 1080p x 1350p, or 1080p x 1080p. Also, please note that Instagram will automatically adjust your video size if your post exceeds the time guidelines. If you need to cut your video, a great video maker is the way to go. If you’re looking to create advertisements, try our Instagram Ad Maker – it’s easy to use and auto sizes your video as required.\n\nTikTok Aspect Ratio\n\nAmong the social media sites today, TikTok is one of the newest! In 2019, TikTok was the third most downloaded app. In terms of video content marketing, it is becoming super popular, and small businesses are getting in on the trend.\n\nTikTok videos are extremely fun, but it’s essential to achieve correct formatting to create engaging videos. Initially, TikTok videos could only be up to 15 seconds, but recently, TikTok extended the limit to 60 seconds for videos recorded on their app.\n\nIt’s important to note that any videos created on external platforms can be longer than 60 seconds. TikTok offers a great native video recorder. However, other more advanced online TikTok editors are available that can help you drive engagement with specific branding features or finding creative images from professional libraries.\n\nWhat Is TikTok’s Aspect Ratio?\n\nTikTok is formatted to be viewed on a smartphone, so a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio is optimal, with 1080p x 1920p resolution. The 1:1 aspect ratio is also available, but the video will not fill the entire screen. Not ideal! Additionally, don’t forget that the video’s file size cannot exceed 287.6 MB on iOS or 72 MB on Android; however, for video ads, you can go up to 500 MB.\n\nChanging TikTok Video Aspect Ratio\n\nFor TikTok videos, an aspect ratio of 9:16 is optimal, and most of the time, it utilizes the full screen of your phone. However, if you recorded your video in landscape mode, you will probably see the infamous black bars. It is relatively easy to remove these bars by editing the video into the 9:16 aspect ratio.\n\nFacebook Aspect Ratio\n\nFacebook has one of the most advanced advertising systems out of all the social networks. Currently, statistics show that there are ten million active advertisers worldwide using Facebook. In addition, globally, many brands have discovered video advertising’s effectiveness in attracting new audiences and generating more leads and are now using it with Facebook videos.\n\nFacebook supports videos of different aspect ratios such as 4:5, 2:3, 16:9, 9:16. For instance, the Facebook Feed and Carousel shape ratio is 1:1, and Facebook Stories uses a 9:16 aspect ratio. With each type of image or ad that you might use on Facebook, getting the correct aspect ratio size can affect the success of your post, and because there are so many advertising options, it can be challenging to do it right.\n\nWhen designing your ads to the optimal sizes, it is essential that you meet all of Facebook’s requirements for your ad to stand out and engage your audience. There are many advertising options for both video and images with different specifications.\n\nFacebook Aspect Ratio Specs\n\nThere are many different ways you can promote on Facebook, and so, knowing the correct aspect ratio for each is important. Facebook has broken down each advertising category and included the specs with the right aspect ratio in each section. You can find the exact aspect ratios for Facebook videos here and images here.\n\nChanging Facebook Aspect Ratios\n\nFacebook has many tools to help with ad creation and editing images and videos for proper ad placement—for example, when you want to crop media for a video ad or change your image aspect ratio for placements. However, when you upload an image for your ad, Facebook will apply the recommended aspect ratio and crop your images or video for the different placement groups, such as Feeds and Stories.\n\nIf you don’t want to use the business tools to crop your Facebook aspect ratio, video maker tools have alternatives. Many video creators like Promo.com allow you to trim your video aspect ratio in just a few clicks. Furthermore, our Video Ad Maker is quite easy to use and makes it easy to brand your messaging and creative ideas before posting.\n\nFacebook Aspect Ratio FAQ\n\nWhy Is My Facebook Video Cropped?\n\nFacebook, like Instagram, often defaults posts to a square format—so if you happen to post a landscape video, the sides will appear cut off. Fortunately, Facebook has a toggle icon that allows you to switch between formats to correct this.\n\nA great alternative for Facebook is to create a square video by editing the video aspect ratio with Promo.com’s video maker. This way, you can ensure that the parts you want in your footage don’t get cropped off.
