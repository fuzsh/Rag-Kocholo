        "text": "I'm curious if anyone else is seeing this issue. I have an iPhone 11 and I sometimes get a weird behavior when turning my phone from portrait to landscape while in messages. The screen will go dark (as if it is going to sleep) and at the same time, an audio message will start to be recorded. At first, I thought I must be inadvertently hitting one of the buttons or hitting something on the screen. But I have seen it happen when I am certain I didn't accidentally hit anything. Has anyone else seen this behavior?\n\nI should mention that when this happens, all I have to do is hit the side button and the screen comes back, the audio recording stops, and I just need to delete the audio recording to continue to text."
