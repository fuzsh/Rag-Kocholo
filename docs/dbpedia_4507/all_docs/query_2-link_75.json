        "text": "I love Americana concerts, where the spirit of our heritage is recalled without the overblown filter of politics. Thursday night in Jacoby Symphony Hall, guest conductor Michael Butterman led the Jacksonville Symphony through an all-American program featuring two of Copland's greatest hits, as well as works by Tobias Picker and Jeff Midkiff.\n\nOur first stop on this scenic musical tour of America was an Eastern Texas bayou. In the inscription at beginning of his score, Picker describes a high bridge that crosses meandering bayous east of Houston. When it rains, the bayous fill with water and begin to flow. When it is dry, they evaporate and turn green in the sun. Where the two main bayous converge, a sign on the side of the highway reads, \"Old and Lost Rivers,\" which is the name of Picker's enchanting musical landscape.\n\nThe musicians of the symphony played Picker's beautifully mystical and contemplative score with affection and sympathy for the music. However, like the free-flowing bayou, guest conductor Michael Butterman allowed the orchestra to meander without any real musical direction. The audience response was one of confusion as witnessed by the meager applause.\n\nWhat followed was a rousing scene change featuring the mandolin, which holds a special place in my heart. My paternal grandfather's hand-carved mandolin has a place of honor on the mantle above the fireplace in my home. When I was a youngster, we made the trek from Washington, D.C., to Elkins, W.Va., where I heard my granddaddy pick that mandolin and call squares.\n\nAs a classical musician with bluegrass roots, I was enthralled with Midkiff's mandolin concerto \"From the Blue Ridge.\" The piece directly reflects his Blue Ridge Mountains roots and his fondness for bluegrass music. It's a work that cleverly blends traditional folk elements with a sophisticated European orchestral foundation and combines mandolin playing suitable for the classically oriented as well as for those who prefer a more down-home style.\n\nMidkiff not only possesses the skills of an imaginative composer, but he is also a virtuoso on the mandolin. \"From the Blue Ridge\" is colorfully orchestrated and is full of foot-stomping, toe-tapping rhythms, and Midkiff mesmerizes the audience with his playing. It was just plain ol' fun to hear.\n\nCopland's little-performed opera \"The Tender Land\" takes place on a farm in the American South during the Depression. If you like his \"Rodeo,\" you will enjoy \"The Tender Land Suite.\" The opening movement features a lengthy slow love theme derived from the opera's final act. The theme is shaped nicely by Butterman and played gorgeously by the strings. The second movement is a rousing party scene, but its big square dance, \"Stomp your Foot,\" could have displayed a little more frivolity. The finale's optimistic paean, \"The Promise of Living,\" is based on the old American hymn tune \"Zion's Walls\" and was very moving.\n\nWhat piece can capture the essence of the ideal America more than Aaron Copland's 1942 Pulitzer Prize-winning ballet score \"Appalachian Spring?\" It is a work that captures rugged mountain vistas, peaceful flowered meadows and endless possibilities. For American audiences, \"Appalachian Spring\" became one of the most inspiring and symbolic works of the last century and it remains so today.\n\nWhy do we love to experience Copland's music? Perhaps it is because of the world's troubles today that we reach back through his music to a simpler time in our history to experience more basic values. Or it maybe its simply because it is great music that can be played so wonderfully by orchestras like the Jacksonville Symphony. And it was, with a clear and perfect balance in the texture, chamber-like sensitivity among the woodwinds and beautiful tone by the strings.\n\nFrom soft shimmers to vitality and power, \"American Landscape\" is a picture in sound and highly recommended.\n\nSymphony reviewer Will Kesling is a professor of conducting at the University of Florida.\n\n'AMERICAN LANDSCAPE'\n\nJacksonville Symphony with Jeff Midkiff\n\n8 p.m. Friday and Saturday at the Times-Union Center\n\n$25-$74"
