        "text": "MPEG-4 Audio, or M4A for short, is an audio file format from Apple that can store several audio content types, including songs, audiobooks, and podcasts. It saves audio data in a MPEG-4 file, encoding it with the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) or the Advanced Audio Coding codec (AAC).\n\nThe MPEG-4 format is a multimedia container that supports audio, video, and other data (such as subtitles and image data) encoded using various codecs. A MPEG-4 file containing video content will have the .mp4 extension, while a MPEG-4 file that only stores audio content will have the .m4a file extension. This distinction helps users differentiate between video and audio-only MPEG-4 files.\n\nThe most common use for the M4A format is for downloading audio files from Apple’s iTunes Store. Usually, this content includes songs encoded using AAC compression, helping to reduce the file size. Another feature is that audio files with copyright protection use the .m4p extension.\n\nThis article is a part of our series about video formats.\n\nIn this article:\n\nM4A File Format Specification\n\nM4A vs. MP3\n\nM4A vs. WAV\n\nManaging and Creating High Quality Audio for Video with Cloudinary\n\nM4A File Format Specification\n\nThe M4A format specification uses one of two codecs—AAC or ALAC. You will need to choose between these codecs when converting files to M4A:\n\nAAC is a compressed codec, meaning it will result in a smaller file size but lower audio quality\n\nALAC provides lossless compression, meaning it provides maximal audio quality but larger file size compared to AAC.\n\nM4A files are made up of contiguous chunks, each with an 8-byte header indicating the type of data in the chunk.\n\nThe first 4-byte chunk will be of type “fftype” and has a sub-type at offset 8 which must be M4A_. The following chunks will have one of the following signatures: “ftyp”, “mdat”, “moov”, “pnot”, “udta”, “uuid”, “moof”, “free”, “skip”, “jP2 “, “wide”, “load”, “ctab”, “imap”, “matt”, “kmat”, “clip”, “crgn”, “sync”, “chap”, “tmcd”, “scpt”, “ssrc”, “PICT”.\n\nRelated content: Read our guide to video codecs\n\nM4A vs. MP3\n\nMP3 is a popular audio format with almost universal compatibility.\n\nM4A and MP3 have a lot in common:\n\nBoth are designed for audio downloads and do not contain video or other types of media\n\nBoth use a compression mechanism to reduce the size of music files\n\nKey differences between the formats:\n\nQuality—M4A files have better sound quality compared to MP3s, mainly due to the high bitrate of M4A. This also means they have a relatively large file size. However, in some scenarios, M4A can have a smaller file size because it has more efficient compression. For example, if a song needs to be encoded at a bitrate of 192Kbps for MP3, it can typically be encoded at 128Kbps for M4A, with the same quality and a smaller file size.\n\nCompatibility—M4A does not have widespread support, while MP3 is supported by virtually all audio devices, computers, and mobile devices. M4A files can easily be converted to MP3 files if you need to listen to them on a non-compatible device.\n\nM4A vs. WAV\n\nThe Waveform Audio File Format (WAV) is an audio container from IBM and Microsoft, making it a standard audio format for PCs that stores lossless audio data. WAV files require a large amount of storage space because the container holds uncompressed audio content. The typical size of a WAV audio file is approximately 10 MB per minute.\n\nWhile both formats are good options for storing audio content, some important features differentiate them. Here are some main distinctions:\n\nCompatibility\n\nM4A is not always compatible with Windows apps and devices because it is an Apple Inc. design. For instance, Windows Media Player doesn’t support M4A files.\n\nWAV works on all Windows devices because it is a format created by IBM and Microsoft. It also works on Mac computers and QuickTime Media Player.\n\nFile Size\n\nM4A files often have audio content decoded using AAC compression, making them comparatively small.\n\nWAV files store audio content in an uncompressed lossless format, making them larger than most other file types, including M4A.\n\nAudio Quality\n\nM4A files usually contain compressed content, resulting in lower audio quality. This format is suitable when prioritizing file size over quality.\n\nWAV files are uncompressed, providing high-quality, lossless audio content. This container is the better format if the priority is quality.\n\nManaging and Creating High-Quality Audio for Video with Cloudinary\n\nCloudinary offers controls for both video and audio. While editing a video with Cloudinary, you can upload the audio files separately and work with several other tools with transformation capabilities similar to photo-editing software: clip, stretch, and so on. Even if encoded, those tools work directly on audio and video.\n\nPlus, by uploading and hosting videos with Cloudinary, you can apply transformations through APIs, which support services of all kinds. Cloudinary even comes with a video player."
