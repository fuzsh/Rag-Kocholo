We're talking drugs, we're talking sexual trafficking and murders, now there's a 41-year-old woman's family who mourns her death at the hands of a greedy and unprincipled operator,\" said Theresa Morris, Toledo City Council District 6.\n\nToledo Fire and Police are standing by the efforts calling on citizens to do their part to help keep the city safe, with many of the illegal establishments violating safety codes and only opening up on obscure days and times.\n\n\"We can't be everywhere at the same time, but once we know that a place is up and going, we can reach out to our friends at the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Ohio Investigative Unit and try to get in there,\" TPD Chief George Kral said.\n\nThe city is calling on six other locations they know that operate as after-hours clubs to shut down or they'll be forced to shut down.\n\n\"It shelters residents in place because residents are scared to go out into their neighborhoods to do things with their families, so it puts just a negative spotlight on our community,\" said Alfonso Narvaez, president of ONE Village Council.\n\nThe city is urging residents to call and report any illegal after-hours club you may know of and to not go into them."
