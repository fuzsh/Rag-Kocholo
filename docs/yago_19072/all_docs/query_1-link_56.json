        "text": "Former Toledo mayor Mike Bell is running for Lucas County commissioner.\n\n13abc's Bill Hormann sat down with Bell to find out what's motivating this run for office.\n\nHe told us he simply wants to make a difference, saying, \"I still care about this region. I still care about this city. I care about the people here.\"\n\nMike Bell served his hometown as fire chief and one-term as Toledo's mayor.\n\nHe has won and lost elections, but in running for commissioner, he's noticed voters are frustrated.\n\nBell told Bill Hormann voters \"think that government has gone goofy. That it's irresponsible to the people that it's serving; that they're making decisions that don't make any sense.\"\n\nAs mayor, Bell pushed Toledo to reach beyond its city limits to cooperate with all of northwest Ohio.\n\nHe insists if Lucas County doesn't do that, it cannot survive.\n\n\"If we get people who live in the city and move into the county,\" Bell says, \"if the county isn't right, their next step is out of the county and when we lose that, we lose our tax base.\"\n\nBell is running against Democrat Pete Gerken. All three commissioners are Democrats, so if Bell wins he'd be the odd man out.\n\nBut he sees possibilities, not problems.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing that I'm not them, he says. \"I think it's a good thing that I'm coming from a different direction. I think it's a good thing that I have a different background.\"\n\nIt's that difference, mixed with a sense of diversity and inclusion, which Bell insists can move the county forward.\n\nBell says, \"Let's go do this. We can. There's nothing holding us back so that's the part that I think is extremely exciting about the ability or idea of running for commissioner and hopefully winning.\"\n\nMike Bell, the former registered Democrat- turned- Independent mayor, is now running for commissioner as a Republican.\n\nHis focus is economic development, regionalism and being tight with taxpayers money.\n\nDemocrat Pete Gerken is seeking his fourth 4-year term as commissioner."
