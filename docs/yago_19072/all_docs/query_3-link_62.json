        "text": "The Ohio Opioid Education Alliance looks to expand its awareness campaign\n\nTOLEDO, OH – Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz and Findlay Mayor Lydia Mihalik hosted civic and corporate leaders in their respective cities today to discuss the work of the Ohio Opioid Education Alliance (OOEA), which is led by the Nationwide Foundation. The two meetings are the first outside central Ohio as this new public-private partnership aims to expand its addiction awareness efforts.\n\n“As mayors, we know Ohio’s approach to the addiction crisis must be comprehensive, including prevention, treatment, and awareness,” Mayor Mihalik said. “This is why the Ohio Mayors Alliance is proud to be an Ohio Opioid Education Alliance partner. By working together across the state, we can help to ensure the next generation knows the dangers of abusing prescription drugs.”\n\nThe OOEA is an education and awareness campaign committed to providing information and resources to help prevent the next generation from abusing prescription opioids. The Ohio Mayors Alliance is an alliance partner along with Nationwide Foundation and many others. The campaign urges parents, “Don’t Live in Denial, Ohio.”\n\n“As parents, we can no longer live in denial,” Mayor Kapszukiewicz said. “The addiction crisis does not discriminate, and we must ensure our kids know the dangers of abusing prescription drugs. This includes having difficult, but important conversations and disposing leftover prescription drugs in our medicine cabinets.”\n\nThe OOEA is a public-private partnership that aims to have a holistic approach by working with local elected officials, medical providers, community nonprofits, and business to reach all Ohioans and provide resources on how to prevent drug abuse.\n\n“Research shows that when parents talk with their kids about the dangers of drugs, they cut their risk of abuse in half,” said Chad Jester, president of the Nationwide Foundation. “These conversations can be very difficult, but they need to be had if Ohio has any chance of overcoming the addiction crisis.”\n\nToledo was the first community outside of central Ohio to host a meeting with the Ohio Opioid Education Alliance and community leaders. The meeting was held at the United Way of Greater Toledo in the morning. In the afternoon, Findlay hosted a similar meeting with business and community leaders throughout the Hancock-County area.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on the Ohio Opioid Education Alliance, visit dontliveindenial.org.\n\nFor more information on the Ohio Mayors Alliance, visit ohiomayorsalliance.org."
