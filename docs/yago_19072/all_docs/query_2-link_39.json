        "text": "Biography\n\nCongresswoman Marcy Kaptur proudly represents the working people of Ohio's Ninth Congressional District. She is currently the longest serving woman in the history of Congress and ranks among the most senior Members of the 118th Congress.\n\nBackground\n\nCongresswoman Kaptur, a native Toledoan, lives in the same modest house where she grew up.\n\nShe is a Polish-American with humble, working class roots. Her family operated a small grocery store and her mother later served on the original organizing committee of a trade union at the Champion Spark Plug factory in Toledo.\n\nAfter graduating from St. Ursula Academy, she became the first member of her family to attend college, earning a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Wisconsin (1968) and later a master's degree in urban planning from the University of Michigan.\n\nAfter working for 15 years as a city and regional planner, primarily in Toledo and Chicago, she accepted an appointment as a domestic policy advisor to President Jimmy Carter. During his Administration, she helped maneuver 17 housing and neighborhood revitalization bills through Congress.\n\nIn Congress\n\nIn 1981, while pursuing a doctorate in urban planning and development finance at MIT, she was recruited by the Lucas County Democratic Party to run for Congress against a first-term Republican. Although she was outspent by a 3-to-1 margin, Kaptur parlayed a strong economic message during the 1982 recession to stage a nationally-recognized upset.\n\nIn Washington, Kaptur fought vigorously to win a seat on the House Appropriations Committee. Today she serves as the first woman to serve as Ranking Member of the influential House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, which she considers an honor given the Ninth District stretches much of the southern Lake Erie coastline.\n\nFederal Investments in Northern Ohio\n\nCongresswoman Kaptur is widely credited with bringing back federal dollars to partner with local communities on crucial transportation and infrastructure projects:\n\nThe I-280 Veterans' Glass City Skyway, which is the largest bridge project in Ohio's history\n\nToledo's Farmers' Market, which has expanded substantially with assistance secured by Congresswoman Kaptur\n\nThe Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge visitors center\n\nCranes and other heavy equipment for the Port of Toledo\n\nState-of-the-art solar power array at the 180th Fighter Wing\n\nThe Center for Innovative Food Technology\n\nSolar energy research projects at the University of Toledo\n\nThe Lake Erie Center\n\nThe National World War II Memorial\n\nPhoto: American Battle Monuments Commission\n\nDedication ceremonies, May 29, 2004\n\nBorn into a family steeped in patriotism and military service, Congresswoman Kaptur has made support for America's seniors, including veterans, the touchstone of her career in Congress. That dedication was displayed during the long legislative battle she waged to have a World War II memorial built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The idea came from Roger Durbin, a constituent who had fought in World War II. Congresswoman Kaptur worked together with Mr. Durbin to make his dream a reality. Despite many setbacks and detours, she never relented.\n\nSeventeen years later, on a sunny May 29, 2004, Congresswoman Kaptur spoke as a crowd estimated at 150,000 people, including three presidents, gathered for the long-awaited dedication of the National World War II Memorial. \"What a privilege it has been to carry this dream forward for 17 years,\" she said.\n\nPresident George W. Bush accepted the memorial on behalf of the American people, calling it a \"fitting tribute, open and expansive, like America: grand and enduring, like the achievements we honor.\"\n\nRoger Durbin had died four years earlier, but he was remembered and honored prominently during the ceremony. The memorial today is one of the most popular and beloved attractions in Washington, D.C. World War II veterans, now in their mid-eighties and nineties, are treated as heroes there every day.\n\nDefense and National Security\n\nCongresswoman Kaptur's effort on the memorial and her advocacy on behalf of veterans led the Veterans of Foreign Wars to honor her with their prestigious Americanism Award. She has also received the Prisoner of War \"Barbed Wire\" Award for her commitment to veterans' affairs.\n\nShe championed the cause of workers who got sick after exposure to beryllium by guiding a major piece of legislation to passage on their behalf. She has secured funding for a pathbreaking study into the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorders and other mental health issues among our armed forces. And she helped lead a community effort to save the 180th Fighter Wing in Toledo when it was threatened by the base closure commission.\n\nInternational Affairs\n\nCongresswoman Kaptur has always shown strong interest in America's standing in the world and its relations with other countries.\n\nShe currently serves on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and co-chairs the Congressional Hungarian Caucus and also the Ukraine Caucus.\n\nA strong supporter of Middle East peace, she directed the first surplus farm commodities in 1999 to support the peace process in Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Congresswoman Kaptur remains dedicated to the development of democratic institutions globally.\n\nShe has spearheaded private charitable efforts to alleviate suffering in nations such as Ukraine and Vietnam.\n\nAs leader on issues related to international trade and human and labor rights, Kaptur has led the fight for fair trade laws, dating back to her opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nAwards"
