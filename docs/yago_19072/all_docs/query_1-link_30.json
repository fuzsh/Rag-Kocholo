Sandra Moore, President of the Association, has formally announced the results of the Board's vote.\n\n\"On behalf of the Toledo Trucking Associations 200 plus members, recognition has been duly noted of the quality of both candidates; Michael Bell and Keith Wilkowski. However, former Fire Chief and State Fire Marshall Mike Bell has a tremendous history of working to promote safety which is the foundation of the TTA.\n\n\"Additionally, Mike Bell exhibits a greater emphasis on those areas of economic development and improving business conditions that are so important to Toledo, Northwest Ohio, our families, and our industry.\""
