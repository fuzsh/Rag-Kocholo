        "text": "On the program this week, it's all about the Toledo mayor's race. It's more crowded now that District 2 councilman D. Michael Collins announced he's jumping into the fray. And Carty Finkbeiner is playing it kind of coy when asked about his plans.\n\nWhat we do know is that former Toledo fire chief and former state fire marshal Michael Bell is smack dab in the middle of the campaign. He told us he couldn't make it to last week's discussion that involved candidates Wilkowski, Konop, and Moody. So he appears on the show this week one on one.\n\nThe other candidates will also be back for solo appearances before the primary.\n\nMike Bell touches on various topics, such as the water main issue, the police and firefighter's budget, unemployment and job creation, 9isFine, gambling, and much more.\n\nOn Take Three, Lee talks with a man on a mission to potentially save young lives with a powerful message. Doug Merrill has walked away from what would be considered a successful career as a teacher and a coach at Bowling Green high school and has written a book. He is now on a mission to help prevent teen suicide and inspire young people in the process."
