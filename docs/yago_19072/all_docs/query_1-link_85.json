        "text": "TOLEDO — The realization was as surprising as it was momentous. Toledo, long known as the Glass City, needed glass, and it no longer could be manufactured here quickly enough.\n\nSo Toledo turned to China to make the 360 panels, 1,300 pounds each, needed for an extension to the Toledo Museum of Art. Some here resented the move after China supplanted the United States as the world’s top glass producer. But in the process, city leaders began an improbable and remarkable relationship.\n\nOver the past seven years, the ties between Toledo and China have grown numerous. Chinese companies have paid more than $10 million in cash for two local hotels, a restaurant complex and a 69-acre waterfront property. Mayor Michael Bell has taken four trips to China in four years in search of investors. His business cards are double-sided, in English and Chinese.\n\nHuaqiao University, one of the largest higher-education institutions in China, recently signed an agreement to open a branch in Toledo. There also have been preliminary talks between local officials and a Chinese company about an arrangement in which industrial tools would be produced in China, shipped for assembly in Toledo and labeled Made in the USA, which would allow them to be sold at a premium.\n\nToledo also has reached a deal for rarely seen Chinese antiques to be shown at the museum next year, and there are plans for the city to host a Chinese technology trade fair at its convention center. In all, more than 100 Toledo business people have traveled to China in recent years, and hundreds of Chinese investors have been welcomed in return.\n\n“For little old Podunk, Ohio, it’s been pretty phenomenal what we’ve been able to do,” said Dean Monske, president and chief executive of the Regional Growth Partnership, a Toledo-area economic-development group.\n\nToledo is hardly the only American city to find common cause with China.\n\nChinese companies made $12.2 billion in direct investments in the United States during the first nine months of 2013. That is up from $7.1 billion in all of 2012, which was itself a record at the time, according to the Rhodium Group, a New York-based consulting company.\n\nBut Toledo, a largely blue-collar city of about 280,000, appears to be punching well above its weight at a time when mayors from Philadelphia to San Francisco are returning from China empty-handed.\n\n“They looked on a map, figured out where we were sitting and saw the benefit,” said Bell, a gregarious former University of Toledo defensive lineman, referring to Toledo’s location near a number of large cities in the United States and Canada.\n\n“They could see that this town needed to be helped a little bit, and that it could be on the upswing — that there was potential, that they could do something, that it could be incredible, and it would not probably take a whole lot to do.”\n\nBell said he had tried to educate residents about the need for foreign investment and the importance of building personal relationships.\n\nDuring one of his visits to China, Bell said, he and other officials were enjoying an evening gathering at which the drinks flowed freely. At one point, his hosts presented him with two more glasses of baijiu, a potent liquor, but this time they came with something extra. One glass contained snake blood; the other, a snake’s gallbladder.\n\nWith a potential investment on the line, the mayor recalled, he grabbed the glass with the gallbladder and nudged the snake blood over to Monske, the economic-development official, who was a deputy mayor at the time. Each swallowed his drink in a gulp, leaving the hosts with mouths agape.\n\n“The guy sitting on the other side of the table said, ‘I’ve lived in China all my life, and I’ve never done that one,’” said Bell, who lost his bid for re-election in November. The mayor, who has a habit of sealing friendships with a bear hug, became an instant celebrity as news of his exploit preceded him from city to city on his tour of China.\n\n“The people traveling with me told me at the end of the 10-day trip, ‘You know, giving hugs — that’s not protocol,’” Bell said. “Then why did you let me do it?”\n\nBell paused before adding that his aide had responded, “Because it was working.”\n\n“The interesting thing,” Bell said, “is they’d started hugging me back.”"
