        "text": "Born on August 24, 1936, Donna Owens was raised in Toledo, Ohio, where she made history in 1983 as the city’s first woman mayor. While politics was not a career to which she aspired, Owens became actively involved in issues pertaining to her children’s school. She eventually ran for school board and rose to become Mayor of Toledo. Owens also made history as the first woman to serve as Chair of the State Employment Relations Board.\n\nOwens was active in a wide variety of organizations at DeVilbiss High School including the Christian Youth Club, Charlemos Spanish Club, and Deviltries. She was also the student representative to the Parent Teacher Association. After graduating in 1954, Owens married and began working at Art Iron and Wire Works in Toledo. When her boss indicated she could earn more if she knew shorthand, Owens enrolled at Stautzenberger Business College.\n\nDuring this time Owens and her husband began raising their three children. When they moved to a new neighborhood, the condition of the local school concerned Owens. Encouraged by a teacher, Owens attended a meeting of the Mothers Club and was soon recruited to be vice president and, later, president.\n\nOwens attended every meeting of the Washington Local School Board where she observed that “one board member slept every single time.” Thinking to herself, “I can do better than that,” Owens ran for the board in 1975. Despite losing, Owens was encouraged to apply for a vacancy on the larger Lucas County Board of Education. Amidst 24 other applicants, Owens won the appointment.\n\nOwens won election outright to the Lucas County Board of Education in 1977 and became its vice president. In 1979 Owens was elected to the Toledo City Council in a 17-person race. Though she was recruited to run for mayor in 1981, she opted to run again for Toledo City Council and easily won reelection. By 1983, Owens wished to tackle Toledo’s “big picture” issues, particularly those pertaining to economic development. She ran for mayor and won, winning reelection in both 1985 and 1987.\n\nFollowing her tenure as mayor, Owens served as Director of Business Development for the Perz Group, Inc. Governor George Voinovich appointed Owens Chair of the State Employment Relations Board in 1991 and Director of the Ohio Department of Commerce in 1994. Governor Bob Taft later appointed Owens to be the Public Member of the three-person Industrial Commission of Ohio.\n\nIn addition to her elected and appointed positions, Owens has been involved in over forty volunteer and civic organizations at the local, state, and national levels. These include the Ohio School Board Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors Advisory Board, and the National League of Cities Committee on Finance, Administration, and Intergovernmental Relations. Owens continues to be devoted to public service. She is one of four former mayors who lead the Coalition for Peaceful Toledo Neighborhoods. In 2022 Owens was elected to represent District 11 on the Ohio Republican Party’s State Central Committee."
