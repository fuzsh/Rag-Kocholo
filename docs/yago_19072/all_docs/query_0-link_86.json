        "text": "GWEN IFILL:\n\nIn Ohio, thanks to more than a million signatures, the dispute will be settled at the ballot box in a referendum that attempts to repeal a six-month-old law curtailing collective bargaining for 360,000 public employees.\n\nJohn Green teaches political science at the University of Akron.\n\nJOHN GREEN, University of Akron: There's been a lot of attention on this battle here in Ohio, partly because the issue of public sector unionization is important, but also because Ohio is a powerful symbol in national politics. It's a battleground state that's very important in congressional and presidential elections. But it's also a bellwether state. It tends to predict national trends very accurately.\n\nGOV. JOHN KASICH, R-Ohio:\n\nOhio has been in deep trouble. And we have got high taxes, not just at the state level, but at the local level. And if you don't control your costs, you keep raising taxes, you're going to kill jobs.\n\nSo, it's a tough issue. It's tough for everybody. You know, look, I come from a union family. My father carried mail on his back. And sometimes it's hard for people, with all the noise out here and all the ads and everything else, for people to understand exactly what's at stake here. But it's just really — it's not about going after a union, and it's not about trying to punish somebody. It's really about creating an environment where you can control your costs so you can create jobs. That's what it's really about.\n\nANNAMAE HEIMAN, teacher:\n\nIt's very far-reaching. And people need to know that, that it's not — we're not just talking about our pay. We're talking about the children of my classroom. We're talking about the people that he goes and rescues out on the freeway.\n\nJOHN HEIMAN, firefighter:\n\nStaffing levels decrease, I'm running into a burning building and something happens to me, who is going to save me? I'm there to hopefully provide and protect the public, and then when it's my turn, what happens? Well, we laid that guy off. We couldn't afford to pay him today, so, I'm going to take a day off.\n\nSTEVE KRYDER:\n\nBecause I believe the employer, us, the taxpayer, should have the ultimate control of what gets done. And that's really the only way to bring that back to this situation. You look at — you look at places like Detroit, which have been governed by union control, and it's done them no good over the long stretch.\n\nMICHAEL BELL, mayor of Toledo, Ohio: How you doing? You hanging in there?\n\nMICHAEL BELL:\n\nWhat we're doing here is, we are in the process of making hard decisions. I realize at all times, because can become very vocal, that there are people that are mad about the position I have taken. But, for me, I believe that in order to keep people working, and especially in order to governmental employees working, if I don't have the flexibility, then I'm going to have to lay a bunch of people off.\n\nNINA TURNER:\n\nThe citizens of my district, when they dial 911, they want to know that help is on the way, that the firefighters, the police officers, the EMS workers, that they are on the way. The fact that they have passed this bill and rammed it down the throats of our public sector workers in this way puts everybody in peril.\n\nWhat we do in Ohio right now in November is really going to send the battle cry across this nation that all eyes are on Ohio and it's up to us and that we can't go back and we won't go back. People fought for these rights, and we got to keep the rights for the next generation.\n\nNINA TURNER:\n\nThe Democratic base is very motivated now, knowing what happened in 2010, that Democrats lost every single statewide office. And, you know, Gwen, elections have consequences. So, hopefully, not only are Democrats awakened. Hopefully, all folks of good consciousness are awake, and they understand that it is consequential that the types of people that you put in office and their ideologies and how they form public policy has an indelible mark.\n\nJOHN GREEN:\n\nAnd one of the things that ties together 2008, 2010, and 2011 and perhaps 2012 is the poor state of the economy. One of the reasons that Barack Obama was able to do well in this state is frankly because it's perceived that the previous administration had not done a good job with the economy.\n\nOne of the reasons that John Kasich was elected governor was because of perception that the economy wasn't going well. And the economy is not getting a lot better, so this is potentially a problem for both sides."
