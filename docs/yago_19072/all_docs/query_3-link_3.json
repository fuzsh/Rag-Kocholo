        "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio (WTVG) - Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz is taking local outrage over deplorable living conditions at the Ashland Manor Apartments to Washington D.C.\n\nThe move comes after city officials discovered rooms overflowing with trash and a cockroach infestation inside the federally funded low-income apartment building near Ashland and Woodruff Avenues.\n\n“Terrible, nasty, disgusting, it stinks,” Marvin Mcquin, whose cousin lives inside Ashland Manor, told 13 Action News. “I just feel like they get paid too much money to have their property looking this low.”\n\nMcquin isn’t alone in his assessment.\n\n“We are the freest, greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world. We cannot have our fellow citizens, our fellow Americans living among cockroaches and mice and trash and filth. It’s disgraceful,” Kapszukiewicz said.\n\nKapszukiewicz is heading to Washington D.C. next week for the U.S. Conference of Mayors. While visiting, he’ll meet with the Chief Operating Officer for the federal Housing and Urban Development Department or HUD on Thursday.\n\nHUD is responsible for funding and inspecting low-income housing such as Ashland Manor.\n\n“Something is broken,” Kapszukiewicz said. “You know, HUD is supposed to inspect units like this, but ... there’s no way that Ashland Manor could have passed any inspection. So, did the inspection not happen? Are folks just kind of phoning it in?”\n\nHe says if HUD isn’t going to step up, the City of Toledo should.\n\n“If HUD isn’t going to inspect, if HUD is going to drop the ball as glaringly as it has here, maybe the City of Toledo has to step up and do its own inspections or have its own mechanisms for inspections,” he said.\n\nCity Council President Carrie Hartman told the I-TEAM that some council members are considering creating legislation to prevent these types of issues, but there are no concrete plans yet.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
