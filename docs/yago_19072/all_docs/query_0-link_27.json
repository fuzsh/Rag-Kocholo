        "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) - Ohio's fire marshal says he's running for mayor in his hometown of Toledo.\n\nMike Bell said Wednesday that he'll run as an independent in this year's mayoral race.\n\nCurrent Mayor Carty Finkbeiner has not said whether he'll seek re-election.\n\nBell was fire chief in Toledo for 16 years before Gov. Ted Strickland selected him to be the state fire marshal two years ago.\n\nBell is stepping down from that job next month so that he can devote his time to running for Toledo mayor. His replacement has not yet been named.\n\nBell grew up in the state's fourth largest city and played football at the University of Toledo.\n\nOthers running for Toledo mayor include:\n\nRepublican Jim Moody\n\nDemocrat Keith Wilkowski\n\nIndependent Opal Covey.\n\nThose considering a run are:\n\nLucas County Commissioner, Democrat Ben Konop.\n\nRepublican City Councilman George Sarantou.\n\nToledo's current mayor, Carty Finkbeiner, has yet to announce if he will run for re-election. Nine other candidates have also taken out petitions to try and get on the September 15th primary ballot."
