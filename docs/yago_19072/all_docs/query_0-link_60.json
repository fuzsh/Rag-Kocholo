        "text": "Toledo's mayor elect is going through the process of selecting his team to help him run city government next year. But Mike Bell will also restructure the mayor's office. And it's a big difference from the way Mayor Finkbeiner ran it.\n\nGovernment is a lot different when you're on the outside looking in. Every mayoral candidate has plans to shake up the office. And during his campaign, Mike Bell insisted he would realign the mayor's office by delegating duties to competent managers. \"If I have to do it all alone in this type of situation, I'm going to fail,\" says Bell.\n\nBell has run big departments before as Toledo's fire chief and as Ohio's fire marshall. And the mayor-elect insists delegating duties worked for him. Bell told us today that by putting good people in the right positions, a mayor should not have to micro-manage. He says, \"And I know there is absolutely no way one person can do it all. You have to trust people. And maybe possibly, that is why we're at where we are now because one person tried to do it all.\"\n\nBell saw the Finkbeiner administration from the inside. He saw a mayor who acted as his own economic development director, who even monitored work crews on break. But Bell's style will be more hands-off.\n\nBell will create a deputy mayor to run the administration's internal operations, a deputy mayor to work with the business community. He'll reinstate an information technology director to run the city's new computer system and create a regional government efficiency task force to find ways to combine services and save money.\n\nBell insists his staff will have the flexibility to make important decisions for their departments. \"And you have to allow them to do their job and you have to hold them accountable. If I've got to do their jobs than I've probably got the wrong people in their position,\" says Bell.\n\nMike Bell may announce his 35 member transition team as early as tomorrow. But as of tomorrow, his team will have one month to find people he trusts to run city government because Mike Bell takes office January 4."
