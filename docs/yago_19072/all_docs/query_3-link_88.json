He is running as a Democrat and his vision for District 5 is keeping neighborhoods safe, strong and sustainable.\n\n\"I believe they're neighborhoods, safe, strong sustainable neighborhoods that give us an opportunity to raise our families and age in place and live the full life that we want to live here in this amazing city,\" Melden said.\n\nOther candidates for District 5 include Connor Kelley, Tom Names and Shane Logan. Tom Waniewski, the current District 5 council member, was not able to file for 2019 re-election due to term limits."
