Michael Collins says Monday that the Lake Erie drinking water is safe and that the warning has been lifted.\n\nThe announcement comes after people in northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan were told to avoid drinking tap water because of toxins contaminating the lake, possibly from algae.\n\nToledo officials issued the water warning in Ohio's fourth-largest city early Saturday.\n\nThe Ohio National Guard and other state agencies have been delivering pallets of bottled water to the city and operating water purification systems to make more drinkable water.\n\nPREVIOUSLY:"
