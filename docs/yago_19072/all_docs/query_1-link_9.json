It's impossible to do because people will not come to your city, they will leave your city,\" Bell explained. \"It is so important to be able to really jump aggressively on that crime issue, be able to tie it with social programs.\"\n\nOwens focused in on the aspect of children growing up in the area, only knowing violence, and with that being the case, the city's future is at risk.\n\nDonna Owens, Former Mayor of Toledo:\n\n\"If we don't change the people that are growing up to be positive, influential, caring, loving, then we're lost as a country,\" Owens said.\n\nOwens also called out current Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz on using $613,000 to revamp city park signs, saying that the priorities are all wrong.\n\n\"What would that $613,000 do to improve the lives of children in this community and their families? The priorities are wrong.\"\n\nWe reached out to the Kapszukiewicz campaign for a response to Owens comments but did not hear back."
