        "text": "On Thursday, Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz highlighted public safety as he announced a new city prosecutor and interim police chief.\n\nKapszukiewicz said the past year was better than 2021 in terms of crime, something the city hopes to continue.\n\n\"This team that we have in place is ready to continue the momentum that we saw from last year, some of the positive things we saw last year,\" the mayor said.\n\nRebecca Facey will be the new city prosecutor and Michael Troendle will be the new interim police chief.\n\nDuring the announcement, Kapszukiewicz explained how the two positions alongside other leadership work together in an effort to help the public feel safe. But Troendle said it’s important to not just reduce crime, but reduce the fear of crime.\n\n\"It's very important,\" Troendle said. \"We have a big job in front of us to continue and get better. We can always get better and we will continue to get better.\"\n\nBefore now, Troendle has worked as assistant police chief for the past five years.\n\nWhile the city works to select the official new police chief, Troendle said he doesn't plan to sit back. Instead, he said he will work to help actively improve the department.\n\n\"Having somebody out there leading those officers to make sure that we're accomplishing the goals the community wants us to do.\"\n\nFor example, something he hopes to do is continue building trust with the community, something he says started under .\n\n“The good news is he's left a roadmap on how to engage the citizens of Toledo and how to get them to trust and buy into what we’re doing at the Police Department. I hope to continue those relationships and build on them.\"\n\nAs for Facey, Kapszukiewicz highlighted her work in domestic violence for the city.\n\nAs the positions of city prosecutor and interim police chief work together, Facey noted they will do just that by \"continuing that partnership as we move forward together toward our common goal of promoting public safety.\"\n\nThe city hopes to have a new police chief by March. Troendle has put his name in the running."
