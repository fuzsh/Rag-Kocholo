When they showed up, he felt they'd scare the fine folks of Toledo and made them leave.\n\nhttp://www.signonsandiego.com/news/military/20080213-1425-marinesbooted.html\n\nNeed to hook this guy up with Da Mayer in Chicago... what a team they'd make!\n\nFor the longest time the closet new development we had was the Del Webb senior homes just under downwind. I always thought that was a perfect match. but I was told that one of the old folks floated a petition against the airport once.\n\nWe since got new home on nearly all sides. No complaints, though."
