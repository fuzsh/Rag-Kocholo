        "text": "#OklahomaCity's homelessness is being addressed by a new system of governance called the Key to Home Partnership, which is a public-private partnership of over 40 agencies whose mission is to prevent and end homelessness in #OKC alongside the City of Oklahoma City and the private sector. If you would like to get involved or learn more about this partnership, visit https://lnkd.in/gddx5Rkj.

This increase in funding is a direct result of the progress our system has made and the effective strategies we have put in place to help our unhoused neighbors get housed and access the services they need. Board Chair of Housing Forward Peter Brodsky said, ‚ÄúHUD allocates funding based on performance. The increase in funding for our community reflects the efficacy of the strategy employed by the All Neighbors Coalition to tackle homelessness, as well as its hard work doing the day-to-day, person-by-person work of helping our unhoused neighbors move into homes and get the services they need to be able to stay housed. It is terrific to see the virtuous cycle of progress leading to increased funding, which will allow us to make more progress.‚Äù Read the full announcement here: https://lnkd.in/g5bsWwcQ #EndHomelessness #HousingForward #AllNeighborsCoalition\n\nDid you know that while homelessness programs are becoming more effective, the number of people experiencing homelessness is increasing? It may seem counterintuitive, but people are moving into and out of homelessness over time‚Äîit is not a static condition affecting the same people from year to year. For example, an estimated 207 people moved from homelessness into housing every day in Los Angeles in 2022; however, an estimated 227 people entered homelessness each day. This pattern underscores the need for sustained funding and innovative approaches to address the homelessness crisis. Find out more in a recent report, \"Five Recent Trends in Homelessness in California\", which resulted from collaborative research by Abt Associates, Terner Center for Housing Innovation and UCSF Benioff Homelessness & Housing Initiative. ‚¨á\n\nAs more households struggle to find housing they can afford, homelessness is increasing across the country. The solution is to address the issue head on providing housing and supportive services ‚Äì not by ticketing or arresting people who don‚Äôt have a safe place to sleep. I emphasized that point in my remarks in Atlanta to the Housing First Partners Conference and in two amicus briefs we filed with the Supreme Court in the Grants Pass case. Housing First works. Permanent supportive housing works. When we pair concrete solutions with compassionate care, we see long term housing stability ‚Äì which means fewer cycles in hospitals, through the prison system, and through substance abuse programs. When we put those solutions together with larger strategies, we can reduce, and even end homelessness."
