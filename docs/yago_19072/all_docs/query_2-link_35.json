        "text": "FROM THE PRESIDENTS DESK\n\nAUGUST 2024\n\nWe are entering into a highly contentious, hyperpartisan election season where emotions and opinions are strong. The League of Women Voters was established over 100 years ago following a long and tough battle for the right of women to vote. The purpose of the League is, and was, to protect the rights of all to vote, provide well-researched information on voting and issues and to protect the democratic process. The League was founded as a non-partisan political organization and has a 501(c)(3) non-profit.status. As such, the League neither supports nor opposes any candidate for elective office or political party. To do so would cause the League to lose its 501(c)(3) status and, more importantly, its reputation and trustworthiness as a valuable source of information which seeks to involve all in the political process.\n\nAs members of the League, we do not forfeit our Constitutional right to free speech however we must be ever mindful that what we say as representatives of the League can reflect on and affect the public’s view of the League and its mission and provide ammunition to those detractors who would like nothing better than to sully its reputation and destroy it.\n\nWhen speaking for, or as a representative of the League, please refrain from criticizing or promoting any candidate for elective office and/or political party, especially at League events and meetings. We have a most important role to play in the political arena. We have made great strides in protecting and preserving democracy and important goals to achieve in the future. Thank you for your support of, and dedication to the League and its mission, and to the democratic process.\n\nRosemarie Barciz\n\nBonnie Bishop"
