        "text": "Ohio governor John Kasich is in northwest Ohio to talk jobs. Demonstrators showed up outside the University of Toledo Lake Erie Center to protest Senate Bill 5. It aims to restrict collective bargaining for public employees.\n\nDave Shafer of the Oregon City Federation of Teachers, says, \"We've taken pay freezes. We've taken health care concessions going back 5 years. We've done that through collective bargaining.\"\n\nDuring his stop in northwest Ohio, the governor talked about the senate bill saying he's ready to sign it. \"This bill allows people to collectively bargain on wages and working conditions, but when it comes to pensions and health care, we believe city councils, mayors and school boards who represent taxpayers ought to be the ones that make those critical decisions,\" says Kasich.\n\nWhen I was a firefighter, I was laid off. I don't want to lay off anybody,\" says Toledo mayor Michael Bell.\n\nMayor Bell points out the firefighters who are protesting still have jobs, but that was not the case a few years ago. Bell says, \"There are really absolutely no good solutions right now. So what you try to do is take the best of bad solutions and try to make 'em work until we can get ourselves back on our feet.\"\n\nPart of his plan involves the sale of The Docks to Dashing Pacific. The Chinese investment group met with the governor before he spoke to the Wood County Economic Development Commission at the Hilton Garden Inn.\n\nScott Prephan of Dashing Pacific says, \"And I think it's important for Dashing Pacific to integrate themselves into the community. They're very much interested in not just investing here, but in being part of the community.\"\n\nThe governor also said the sale of The Docks has opened the doors to other foreign investors and this could be the first of many sales."
