        "text": "Announcer: The views and opinions expressed in to the point are those of the hosted, the program and its guests.\n\nThey do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of WGTE public media.\n\nDoni: When you're talking about safety, what's important to remember is that statistics really don't matter.\n\nWhat matters is the way neighbors feel about their neighborhoods.\n\nAnd if you take a poll of neighbors in Toledo, what you will find is most of them are not feeling very safe.\n\nWe know what a group of former mayors pulled together by Paula Hicks-Hudson have said, We are tired of this.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nWe are not going to take this any more.\n\nThey've joined with community and other mayors and they've put together a 12 point plan for peaceful neighborhoods.\n\nAnd we're going to be talking about that today with our guests, former Mayor Carty Finkbeiner and former Mayor Mike Bell.\n\nWelcome to The Point.\n\nPlease connect with us on our social media pages, or you can email me at doni _miller@wgte.org And for this episode and any additional extras that you might be interested in, please go to wgte.org.\n\nTo the point we are so excited to have with us today two men who need such little introduction because they are so well known for their community contributions.\n\nAnd in this particular case we're talking about their contributions to help end violence in this community.\n\nThey've actually put their money where their mouths are.\n\nThey've come up with a 12 point plan.\n\nThey and co-founders of the group Coalition for Peaceful Toledo Neighborhoods.\n\nWe're going to talk a bit about that today.\n\nIt's my honor and my pleasure to introduce you to Mayor Mike Bell and Mayor Carty Finkbeiner.\n\nWelcome.\n\nWelcome.\n\nMichael Bell: Thanks.\n\nThank you.\n\nDoni: It is so good to have you guys here.\n\nAnd it's so good to see you being involved in an issue that the whole world is talking about.\n\nBut very few people are coming up with suggestions for how to change things.\n\nLet's talk for a minute, though, just so everybody is on the same page about what it took to get you guys to work together.\n\nWhat was the thing that made you say, we're we're going to do something about this?\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: Well, I think it was Mike and Donna, probably initially, Paula and I way back, uh, late May or early June, we were different places, but we were talking about the same subject matter.\n\nIt led to the four of us writing a letter to the mayor and asking for a meeting with the mayor.\n\nAnd the police were very respectfully asking for a mayor with it for the meeting with the mayor and the police chief and the safety director.\n\nAnd that took place, if I'm not mistaken, in August, and didn't accomplish as much as we hope that it would.\n\nSo we put our heads together thereafter and thought maybe the four mayors.\n\nDoni: Could get together.\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: So together, Paula.\n\nDoni: Would be former mayor politics and Donna would be former mayor Donna Owens.\n\nYeah.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSame thing.\n\nMichael, what pulled you in?\n\nMichael Bell: Well, myself and Donna, we we meet on a pretty regular basis just to talk about things that are happening in the city.\n\nAnd we get a lot of, you know, just talking.\n\nAnd we realize that I mean, we are mayors, but we're also taxpayers.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd we thought what?\n\nWhat if we could all just remove our egos and see if we can come together, all four previous mayors, and be able to help the current mayor?\n\nYou know, we figure that we have together probably about 35 years of experience being mayors.\n\nSo why wouldn't we take it thing that we're still in a city?\n\nWe all live in the city.\n\nWe all pay taxes here.\n\nYou know, if the boat's taking on water, everybody on the boats got to be bailing.\n\nAnd so why wouldn't we step up together and be able to help the mayor?\n\nDoni: That's a great metaphor.\n\nAnd you've actually been joined by mayors from outside of the city.\n\nMichael Bell: Absolutely.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nBecause one thing that I think that I know that as mayors, we've all thought about this, what happens in Toledo affects our region.\n\nAnd so we have to be willing to understand that they should also be part of the solution of helping us.\n\nAnd so by reaching out, it just proves how much of a region we are and that, you know, if Toledo, you know, catches a cold, you know, the rest of the region can catch a cold, too, because we we drive a lot of it.\n\nA lot of the people that live in these other areas actually work in Toledo, Toledo.\n\nSo it's important to to be able.\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: To I'd like to mention by city those mayors and give them credit.\n\nI won't remember everyone's name, but Sylvania and Miami were the first two mayors.\n\nAnd we're so surprised a bit because some of us as mayors had battles with mayor of Miami and Sylvania over water issues and what they were paying for the water, but they always step right up to the plate with Mayor Owens and said, how can we be of help?\n\nAnd then we were joined by the mayor.\n\nAnd that in particular order I'm working my way around from Sylvania, mayor of Holland, Ohio, mayor of Anthony Wayne May of I shouldn't say Anthony Wayne Waterville, mayor of Waterville, mayor of Perrysburg, mayor of Rochford, mayor of Oregon.\n\nAnd we got a call from the mayor of Liberty City Center.\n\nAnd I haven't met him yet, but he says, count me in.\n\nThere's eight mayors at the moment.\n\nDoni: It's really I mean, for mayor, our current mayor has committed to see.\n\nWorking with you.\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: A present mayor.\n\nYes, not yet.\n\nMichael Bell: Not yet.\n\nWe're we're trying to work through some things.\n\nOnce again, what I'm saying and I'll say it multiple times is you have to take your ego out of this formula.\n\nIf you want a solution.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd we we are we're working.\n\nWe're doing this because we care.\n\nWe're not doing this to attack the mayor.\n\nWe're not against things that are.\n\nWe're just because we care and we still live here and we're on this boat.\n\nWe want to make sure that it's safe.\n\nAnd if we've got a skill set, why would we sit back and not be willing to help the current administration?\n\nDoni: Are you all stunned by the level of violence?\n\nAre you surprised?\n\nMichael Bell: Absolutely.\n\nBy what's.\n\nDoni: Going on?\n\nWhat do you what do you think's going on nationally?\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: It seems to me that we frozen, I believe, a little before the point of the terrible incident in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nWe were frozen then as a nation.\n\nThere was just so much bickering at the national level and hard language back and forth between political leaders.\n\nAnd then the incident on the streets where Minneapolis policemen caused the death of an African-American gentleman.\n\nI think that even brought more tension into the urban environment where there is a mixture of men and women in their families living.\n\nAnd it does seem to me that there are many cities we could be one of the first cities.\n\nAnd I give Mike credit for this.\n\nMike's the one who said, look, if we four mayors come together, that should get the attention of of of people not only in our community, perhaps in other community, because we're not alone in in facing this issue.\n\nBut on the other hand, we haven't made much progress since four and a half years ago.\n\nThe violence broke out in our city and other cities.\n\nAnd it's time that the cities that have caring, smart leaders and mayors join hands.\n\nIt can't be done by one.\n\nIt can't be done by two.\n\nIt's got to be done by a collective.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nPrivate citizens and public officials.\n\nDoni: You know, we had several shows ago, we had a young man on by the name of Anton Parks, and I actually met Mr.\n\nParks at one of your community gatherings.\n\nAnd he talked about kids these days being different, feeling abandoned, not having mentors, not being a part of community the way perhaps the three of us were when when we were growing up.\n\nAs you're talking to people in the community, is that what you're hearing, Michael Mayor, about?\n\nMichael Bell: Yeah, it it's you know, it's a matter of these kids are pretty much sort of disconnected.\n\nYou know what they're they're on the Internet and, you know, they're they're raised by the phone as compared to when I was coming up, you know, when we had to do activities.\n\nAnd so what we have to do is we have to get them more involved in activities inside our community, you know, like the Boys and Girls Club and things like that that actually make a difference in people's lives.\n\nThey right now you have and it's a parenting issue in a little bit because what we have here is we have kids raising kids.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd it's very, very difficult.\n\nIf you don't know how yourself how to do it then and you're raising kids because you're having kids at a younger age, we got to figure out a solution.\n\nYou know, we can say, well, okay, that's a problem, but what's the solution?\n\nThe solution is being able to help them somehow and in the program that we talking up 12 points, we talk about the ability to to push forward with parenting, parenting, mentoring, parenting, education so that some because where do you go if you don't know?\n\nDoni: Right.\n\nThat's a great transition.\n\nWhy don't we talk about a few of the points in the 12 point plan?\n\nThe plan is extremely comprehensive.\n\nThank you for sharing it with me, the both of you.\n\nWe won't get through all 12 points today, but maybe there is a way that we can make that plan available to people who would be interested in seeing the entirety of the report because it is an extremely broad and inclusive approach to the issue.\n\nBut let's take a look at a couple of the points that you made that I thought were particularly probative.\n\nOne of them is that the Coalition for Peaceful Toledo Neighborhoods is suggesting that there be more support for communities and the building of community resources.\n\nWhy did you choose that one?\n\nWhy were people telling you that that one was important?\n\nMichael Bell: That's some of the services that that they think they should be able to get to.\n\nThey're having a difficult time getting.\n\nDoni: Getting to.\n\nMichael Bell: Those.\n\nAnd what it what it appears, whether it is just some sort of malfunction in the system that appears that it's biased toward certain groups of people.\n\nAnd I don't think that that's the intent.\n\nBut if I'm a person and I'm trying to get a report, a police reporter or something like that, and I can't get it, okay, then I'm wondering.\n\nOkay, then what am I paying my taxes for?\n\nDoni: Right.\n\nWell, and there is there is no secret to the fact that when you're encased in issues related to poverty and lack of resources, that those issues breed violence.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd lack of educational attainment and a number of other issues.\n\nSo this first point that we're talking about today, putting more resources into the community can do nothing but help that.\n\nMichael Bell: I mean, even the basic things I can remember, Mayor Jack Ford, he remember he he took and bought a bunch of lawnmowers.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd had kids taking the lawnmowers.\n\nWe basically gave them the lawnmowers and they were they would cut city properties and then they had the ability to go out and and make money with those margins.\n\nDoni: And that's right.\n\nMichael Bell: You just have to give them.\n\nAnd when we were younger, you said this earlier, we had to come up with creative things to do and our parents came up with creative things to do.\n\nThat was one heck of a plan.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhere it actually showed entrepreneurship in in being able to learn how to make money and do it in a way that is respectful.\n\nDoni: I want you to hold that point.\n\nWe're going to go away for just a minute, but we will be right back.\n\nAnnouncer: It's out with the old and the new.\n\nWatch, listen and learn with our new reimagined website with new features to make your listening experience better.\n\nIt's easier than

with us on our social media pages or email me at doni _miller@wgte.org or again for this episode and other additional extras that you might be interested in.\n\nPlease go to talk to the point.\n\nWe are talking to former mayors Carty Finkbeiner, Michael Bell about the Coalition for Peaceful Toledo Neighborhoods designed to make a dent in this issue of violence that we continue to talk about but seem to have great difficulty in developing a plan that really gets to the heart of the need for change.\n\nAnd and Mayor Bell.\n\nMichael Bell: One of the things I want to say is that this 12 point was created through multiple meetings of residents inside our city.\n\nThis wasn't just the four mayors coming together.\n\nWe were the the core to bringing those people to meetings.\n\nBut the things that you see on this point, they're not all right is they're the ideas of what people told us at multiple meetings.\n\nAnd the only way you can actually understand what people want in this community is you have to go out and talk.\n\nDoni: To and listen to them and listen to what.\n\nMichael Bell: Exactly exactly.\n\nDoni: You can't live the lives of people in those neighborhoods.\n\nYou have to listen to those experiences and bring those into your into your planning and into your processes.\n\nAnd that's very first one that we've talked about.\n\nNeighborhood support is is absolutely critical.\n\nAnd your point about instilling pride and giving people the opportunity to be entrepreneurs.\n\nEverybody wants the same thing, right?\n\nWe all want to be safe.\n\nWe all want to be proud of who we are and where we are.\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: I heard a suggestion the other day.\n\nIt came from another city.\n\nI won't report that city, but I would love that the mayor is giving his state of the city.\n\nIn this particular city.\n\nAnd he reminded everybody of the of the term.\n\nIt takes a village That's right.\n\nTo to raise a child.\n\nDo we really mean that, ladies and gentlemen, if we do a village?\n\nCouldn't be my church in Miami reaching out to help children in the heart of Toledo.\n\nAnd we yet see too many churches that are all white or all black.\n\nWe have an integrated our churches.\n\nNow, that's not one of our 12 proposals, but the church as an entity that's getting involved.\n\nChurches are losing their their base.\n\nThey do not have the number of of of regular attenders that they used to have.\n\nI think they can churches all over.\n\nQuote Holy Toledo.\n\nWe need to get people and ministers back and particularly the heart of the city's churches.\n\nThe churches that are presently very alive and well.\n\nWe need them not to just think.\n\nIt takes a village to be a part of it.\n\nCreate problem programs that can bring those children in and feel at home.\n\nAnd there are programs that could do that.\n\nMost of the old big churches have basketball courts.\n\nYou know, kids love to play, play the basketball.\n\nDoni: I want to interrupt you for just.\n\nSure.\n\nI want to interrupt you for just a second because I want to in in thinking about that, I also want to think about how one of your other points that's really important and that's increased police presence.\n\nSometimes churches can facilitate those relationships between police and the community.\n\nSo it's important, I think, to to understand that everybody can be a partner in this.\n\nBut as you raise that point, increased police presence, I'm curious to understand how you think that would work given the current tension between neighborhoods, especially neighborhoods of color and poor neighborhoods and police.\n\nMichael Bell: I think that the key portion of that is that you have to establish a relationship.\n\nOne of the things that the late Chief Diggs was very good at doing was getting right into the community.\n\nAnd you can't do it from a car, you can't do it from a distance.\n\nYou can't probably do it from a Zoom meeting.\n\nYou have to establish a relationship with people.\n\nEverybody wants the same thing.\n\nI don't care whether you live here in Toledo or in Perrysburg or whatever you want.\n\nThe same thing.\n\nYou want to know that you feel safe.\n\nYou want to know who your officers are.\n\nI can tell you that in our multiple meetings that we've had, nobody has come in critical of the police.\n\nBut there was a perception.\n\nSo then that.\n\nDoni: Would say.\n\nMichael Bell: That they that puts that difference that you don't want us.\n\nSo we're not going to come through.\n\nAnd really what needs to happen is we have to find the bridge to being able to bring the police in with the neighborhoods that they're supposed to be supporting, and they will find it.\n\nI mean, these people really want to be able to know that they can talk to a police officer and be able to feel safe in their community.\n\nBut you got to get out of the car.\n\nYou got to really actually be able to talk to somebody one on one.\n\nAnd if you have a differences, you've got to be able to express the differences.\n\nLet's get over this, because most likely the person you got the differences.\n\nIsn't that obviously that's in your neighborhood?\n\nDoni: That's exactly right.\n\nOne of the things that both of you were quite successful with was your interaction with the community.\n\nYou were both very present and very available.\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: You have to go into the community as the mayor.\n\nWhen youngsters died, I was there.\n\nWhen they died, I went to the home.\n\nWhatever you just have to know the people of your city on a first name basis.\n\nTwo quick points, Don and I, I think I want to come down and speaking for Carty, I hope for Mike, Dana and and Paula, we believe that the police in Toledo, Ohio, over the years have done a very respectable, great job protecting families in the neighborhoods.\n\nWe believe today the police are uncertain of what is expected of them from the administration in terms of doing the policing that they're trained in the academy to do.\n\nWe think the police in a relationship with the citizens call it whatever you wish.\n\nSome people don't like the term.\n\nBLOCK Watch.\n\nI know that getting people to meetings with the police, the way that worked for Elizabeth Pierson, who put 269 block watch programs together in Toledo, Ohio, a little small in stature, huge in heart in what she got done.\n\nBlack woman put together the block, watch programs at number 269.\n\nAnd the police loved working with those programs.\n\nDoni: Is this a reasonable thought, the idea that you would increase the police presence in a friendly way in the community, is that.\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: Doable in Toledo?\n\nAnd I'll turn over to Mike in Toledo.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYou go to where white boys like me are advised to go.\n\nIf you want to know what African-American people are thinking, go to the barbershops or the beauty salons on the weekend.\n\nI don't go to the beauty salons, but I do go to the barbershops.\n\nI learned a long time ago, Sit and listen.\n\nThey'll tell you what the undercover train is in the African-American community.\n\nAnd it is we want to work with the police and we need the police in our neighborhood.\n\nDoni: Do you agree, Mayor Bell?\n\nMichael Bell: Absolutely.\n\nBut it what it's going to take, it didn't get in broken down overnight.\n\nAnd so you're not going to fix it overnight, but you've got to start some initiatives that allow for people to understand that we're trying to reach across and make this connection to being able to help people.\n\nThe BLOCK Watch portion of it was critical because it actually established a relationship with the police officers in the neighborhoods.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd in the idea of whatever you want to call it.\n\nAnd then I think that that's been the big catch right now is that they don't necessarily want to call it BLOCK which I want to call it something else.\n\nThe purpose, though, still is real, that having a community officer that knows people in the neighborhood means that there's going to be great communication.\n\nAnd when things occur, there's going to be a more urgency because I have a relationship with you.\n\nIf I have no relationship, it becomes a little bit more difficult to have the sensitivity that I need to be able to do what I need to do.\n\nDoni: You know, one other point and and I'm so sorry we're not going to be able to get through all 12 of these points today.\n\nBut you list the importance of revitalization and cleaning up neighborhoods and feeling like you matter.\n\nAll of those things are important when you're talking about minimizing aggression in a community.\n\nThis other bear that I referred to did not put a name on it because I didn't want everybody attacking him or a city.\n\nHe just proposed a week ago that the neighborhoods that are the most challenged right now, not only by crime but by blight, that they present a proposal to a committee of city and community leaders that says how over the next seven months they are going to make a difference in erasing the blight and making it safer.\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: At the end of that seven month, they bring those programs back and they're a competition.\n\nThe city will fund six of those programs for one year at $700,000.\n\nNeighborhood neighborhoods, 3 to 4 blocks or roughly 700,000 if they come back a second year.\n\nAnd they've done everything that they said they were going to do.\n\nThey're entitled to get a second $700,000.\n\nNow, the city is three times bigger than Toledo, so we reduce that amount to 200,000 or 250,000.\n\nThink of what some of those neighborhoods are capable of doing, what they're ideas they will tell you right now.\n\nAnd I'll wrap it up.\n\nThe $180 million came to the city of Toledo.\n\nA lot of people do not know where that $180 million ended up, except in generalities.\n\nWe're going to repave the streets, whatever we need to get that money into those neighborhoods that are the most challenged.\n\nDoni: Quickly, Michael.\n\nMichael Bell: You covered most of it.\n\nIt's just a matter that if you put money into these neighborhoods, then that means that you care.\n\nIf you're not putting money and you're not helping them, it means that you don't care.\n\nRight.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd people read that and they read it from there, from their porches.\n\nWhen they're looking out on the street, they know if you care about them or if you don't care about.\n\nDoni: That's right.\n\nI totally agree.\n\nWe have like 30 seconds.\n\nOne word.\n\nWhat will make this work, Mayor?\n\nGo one word.\n\nMichael Bell: Its actually two.\n\nThe egos.\n\nDoni: All righty.\n\nMayor Finkbeiner, one word.\n\nWhat makes this work?\n\nCarty Finkbeiner: Deep, caring.\n\nDoni: Deep caring.\n\nThank you both so, so very much for being with us.\n\nFinal word.\n\nYes, please.\n\nQuickly.\n\nMichael Bell: Love.\n\nDoni: Love.\n\nAll right.\n\nAll right.\n\nThank you so much for joining us today.\n\nThis is to the point.\n\nWe will see you next time.\n\nHave a wonderful day.\n\nAnnouncer: The views and opinions expressed in to the point are those of the host of the program and its guests.\n\nThey do not necessarily reflect the views or
