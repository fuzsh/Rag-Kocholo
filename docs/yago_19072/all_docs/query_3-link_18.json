        "text": "For Toledo, OH, Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz, addressing homelessness is a top priority.\n\n“One of the things we need to do as public officials is to do a better job educating the public on the overall community value of developing affordable housing,” he said in an interview with Toledo Streets. “What I try to emphasize is this is not an us versus them situation; affordable housing is for us.”\n\nMayor Kapszukiewicz serves as the head of the Community Development and Housing Standing Committee for the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM), leading many of the discussions among mayors who are working to address the housing and homelessness crisis.\n\nLast fall, he joined USCM President Reno, NV, Mayor Hillary Schieve and Los Angeles, CA, Mayor Karen Bass, Chair of USCM’s Homelessness Task Force, and a bipartisan group of mayors from across the country for a national summit to discuss solutions to homelessness. They shared best practices and reevaluated current efforts to support those who are unhoused, emphasizing the importance of federal investment and partnership. Many cities can’t afford to act without it.\n\nLast February, Mayor Kapszukiewicz and the City of Toledo directed $2 million to Toledo Public Schools (TPS) and Lutheran Social Services of Northwestern Ohio to help students and their families who need housing stability. The money helps families pay rent and utilities, and more than 700 families had enrolled in the program as of December 2023.\n\nStudying is “hard enough,” said Mayor Kapszukiewicz. “Imagine if on top of that, you didn’t know where you’re going to sleep tonight… It’s a real problem in our community.”\n\nHowever, it’s not just a question of housing resources, but also medical resources. Many Toledoans who are struggling with homelessness are also dealing with mental health issues, often hindering their ability to find and maintain housing.\n\nLast May, $2 million in American Rescue Plan funds was approved for the Mental Health and Recovery Services Board of Lucas County to invest in community groups.\n\nIn 2021, Toledo became one of only 11 municipalities nationwide to codify a right to counsel for residents facing eviction. In the first year of the program, legal aid partners represented tenants in 227 eviction cases. And in 2022, the City of Toledo joined a partnership of local organizations called the Eviction Prevention League, which works to bolster support for residents facing eviction. In the first year, the Eviction Prevention League prevented 69 evictions.\n\nAdditionally, the City of Toledo has allocated $10,000,000 of ARPA funding to support three affordable housing projects that will create more than 200 new units of affordable housing.\n\nIt comes back to mutual understanding, to recognizing that working consistently to address homelessness and the housing crisis builds a stronger community.\n\n“When we build affordable housing, we are benefiting the average Toledoan. We’re in it and happy to support it.”"
