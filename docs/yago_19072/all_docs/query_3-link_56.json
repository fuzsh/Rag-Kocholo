        "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio -- Six days after suffering cardiac arrest, Toledo Mayor D. Michael Collins passed away Friday at the age of 70.\n\nCollins died Friday at the University of Toledo Medical Center where he was in critical condition since being admitted Sunday.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that we announce that Mayor D. Michael Collins passed away on February 6, 2015. His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled,\" reads a statement from the city. \"The City of Toledo mourns its Mayor as well as expresses deep sympathy for the family and close friends of Mayor Collins.\"\n\nMayor Collins was brought to UTMC Sunday afternoon after suffering cardiac arrest while driving in south Toledo. He was rescued after on Parkside Boulevard near Hill Avenue.\n\nWithin minutes of official word of Collins' passing on Friday, began pouring in from leaders across the city and state.\n\n----------\n\nMORE:\n\n----------\n\nREAD STATEMENT FROM CITY OF TOLEDO:\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce that Mayor D. Michael Collins passed away on February 6, 2015. His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled. The City of Toledo mourns its Mayor as well as expresses deep sympathy for the family and close friends of Mayor Collins.\n\nHe died doing what he loved, serving the citizens of Toledo and being Mayor to this great city. His ambitions were far reaching; he never believed he had to leave Toledo to achieve them. He was a man devoted to his family, his friends, his staff and his community.\n\nHe has been many things in his life - a marine, police officer, councilman, Mayor, husband, father, grandfather, and devout Catholic. He will always be a shining example of how to live a good, decent and honest life.\n\nD. Michael Collins was sworn into the office of Mayor on January 2, 2014 -- prior to that he served as Councilman for District 2, a seat he was first elected to in 2007. He viewed being a public servant as a privilege that gave him the opportunity to give back to the community for the many blessings he received throughout his professional career as a police officer, councilman and Mayor. He often referenced our community as a compassionate one; it was an ideal he personally demonstrated.\n\nHis wife, Sandy Drabik, his daughters and the entire family would like to thank the community for their thoughts, prayers and support during this difficult time. They would also like to thank the medical staff at the University of Toledo Medical Center for the care and support they have provided. The City of Toledo has truly shown themselves to be a compassionate community.\n\nFuneral arrangement information is pending at this time; we ask that the privacy of the family be respected at this difficult time."
