        "text": "Toledo Mayor \"Mike Bell (once) lost his job as a firefighter because his city ran out of money.\"\n\n-- Building a Better Ohio\n\nToledo Mayor Mike Bell appears in a TV commercial endorsing Issue 2, the November voter referendum on Senate Bill 5. The ad was made and paid for by Building a Better Ohio, the largely business and Republican-backed political action committee supporting SB 5, the law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio's public unions.\n\nBell, who was elected as an independent in 2009, talks in the ad about his support for Issue 2 because it will give communities tools to help control spending and balance budgets without laying off workers or raising taxes.\n\nHe starts the discussion saying: \"Years ago, I lost my job as a firefighter because my city ran out of money.\"\n\nBuilding a Better Ohio adopts Bell's statement as its own on its website.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio took notice. Bell's record and experience make him worth listening to. A firefighter and certified paramedic who went on the job in 1980, he became Toledo's youngest-ever and first African American fire chief in 1990, and held the post for more than 16 years. After he retired, then-Gov. Ted Strickland appointed him State Fire Marshal.\n\nThe commercial also stirred our curiosity. Did Bell really lose his job in a budget crunch and was it at all related to labor issues?\n\nSo PolitiFact Ohio looked deeper into the record."
