        "text": "The mayor of Toledo, Ohio, Michael Collins, was in critical condition Sunday after suffering a cardiac arrest while driving that caused him to crash into a utility pole. \"At this time he is being heavily sedated and closely monitored,” University of Toledo Medical Center Cardiologist and Vice President for Clinical Affairs Christopher Cooper said Sunday afternoon. \"At this point it is too early yet to establish the timing or likelihood of his recovery.\"\n\nCollins was driving shortly after a news conference with Lucas County Sheriff John Tharp to officially declare a Level 3 Snow Emergency, NBC affiliate WNWO reported. Good Samaritan Evelyn Johnson and another man performed CPR on the mayor after smashing a window of his locked car windows in order to pull Collins to safety, the Toledo Blade reported. Toledo City Council President Paula Hicks-Hudson was sworn in as acting mayor shortly after 5 p.m. ET.\n\n—Richie Duchon"
