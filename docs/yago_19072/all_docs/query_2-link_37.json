        "text": "Opened as the SeaGate Centre on March 27, 1987. The name came from the St. Lawrence Seaway and Toledo’s branding as “Gateway to the Sea. Toledo natives Danny Thomas, Teresa Brewer and Jamie Farr were part of the dedication along with former Mayor Harry Kessler, County Commissioners James Holzemer, Alfred Hawkins, Sandy Isenberg, and Toledo Mayor Donna Owens.\n\nSince then, the rebranded Glass City Center has hosted hundreds of national and regional conventions, trade shows, athletic competitions, expos, fundraisers, dinner events and weddings. Improvements were made, but it was 2020 when the transformative $70 million expansion and renovation began. The result is a spectacular new downtown convention center.\n\nGlass City Center’s new16,000 sq ft Grand Ballroom opened in late August 2022 with the new name paying homage to our city’s recognition as the “glass capital of the world.” In the last 18 months, dozens of new music, food and entertainment venues have energized our dynamic city."
