        "text": "Carleton \"Carty\" S. Finkbeiner (born May 30, 1939) is an American Democratic politician and former mayor of Toledo, Ohio.\n\nQuick Facts Carleton S. Finkbeiner, 58th and 60th Mayor of Toledo ...\n\nClose\n\nIn all, Finkbeiner has run for Toledo mayor seven times, spanning a period of 40 years. He was elected to four-year terms in 1993, 1997, and 2005; he lost in 1981 (to Douglas DeGood), 1987 (to Donna Owens), 2015 (to Paula Hicks-Hudson), and 2021 (to Wade Kapszukiewicz).\n\nFirst elected in 1993, he took office on January 1, 1994. In 1997, he defeated challenger Nick Wichowski to win a second term. Term limits prevented him from running a third consecutive time. He was succeeded by former mayor Jack Ford in 2002. Following his first administration, Finkbeiner served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board.[1] He joined the ABC affiliate in Toledo and hosted Carty & Company, a Sunday morning public affairs show. He also contributed a weekly editorial segment, It's Just Not Right! Finkbeiner left WTVG in May 2005.[2]\n\nOn June 30, 2005, Finkbeiner announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. He won the Toledo mayoral primary, winning roughly 37% of the vote in comparison to 29% earned by incumbent Ford. On November 8, 2005, Finkbeiner was re-elected mayor. Finkbeiner was sworn in for his third term as mayor in a private ceremony on January 3, 2006. Carty announced that his third run as mayor would be his final one and he would not seek re-election. According to city finance records verified by the Toledo Blade, Finkbeiner left the city with a 48 million dollar deficit which was inherited by Ohio Fire Marshall Michael P. Bell, an Independent, who succeeded Carty Finkbeiner in 2010.[3]\n\nFinkbeiner resides with his wife, Amy Finkbeiner, in South Toledo. He has three children: Ryan, Jenny, and Katie, and five grandchildren.[citation needed]\n\nFinkbeiner announced plans to run for a fourth term as mayor of Toledo on August 29, 2015.[4] The 2015 election, to fill the remainder of Michael Collins' mayoral term, was won by Paula Hicks-Hudson.[5]"
