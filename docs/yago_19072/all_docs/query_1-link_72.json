        "text": "Barring some eleventh hour heroics, it still looks like the South Toledo YMCA membership drive will fail. Only 2 more people have pledged to join the South Y bringing the total number to 113 memberships. That's still far short of the 376 the Y needs to stay open. The drive ends at 4:00 this afternoon. We're told the board could close the doors for good after that.\n\nThe world's best golfer is putting away the clubs, at least for now. Tiger Woods announced he's taking an \"indefinite\" break from golf hoping to put his personal life in order. In a statement released yesterday, Woods says he needs to focus on \"being a better husband, father and person.\"\n\nNew figures show casino supporters in Ohio spent $47 million in their campaign to get casinos approved in the state's 4 biggest cities, including in Toledo. The $47-million was much more than casino opponents spent on the effort. Truth-Pac only spent about $9 million hoping to rally residents against the measure.\n\nA house fire injured one local woman overnight. It happened on Roanoke Road around midnight. Fire crews say when they arrived they found an elderly woman lying on the dining room floor. She was taken to Mercy Saint V's where crews say she was responsive by the time she got there. Investigators continue to look into a cause.\n\nMayor-elect Michael Bell is pledging to do what he can to turn the city around. In a session with the Toledo Press Club, Bell told journalists that he's largely tried to stay out of city government issues until he becomes mayor in January. But he says one of his first challenges will be to trim the city's projected budget deficit, which is approaching $40 million, far larger than when he announced his candidacy for mayor. Bell says even with the looming deficit, his administration will be focused on delivering essential city services.\n\nA new report out says the health care reform bill wouldn't slow the rise in health care costs. Under the bill that's now being debated in the senate, the nation's annual health care tab of $2.5 trillion wouldn't shrink over the next 10 years. But on a positive note, the report says the bill would provide coverage to 93 percent of Americans, reducing the number of uninsured people by about 33 million.\n\nThe army major charged in the Fort Hood shootings will face a tough prosecutor once his trial begins. The lead prosecutor will be Col. Michael Mulligan, who secured the death penalty in a similar case 4 years ago. Major Nidal Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder. It's not known if the death penalty will be sought.\n\nA blizzard was causing big trouble on the roads in northeast Ohio yesterday. Cars and trucks have been slipping and sliding into snowy ditches. Up to two feet of snow is expected to fall by this weekend. Homeowners are hard at work trying to plow and shovel themselves out of this wintry wonderland, but it doesn't seem to be doing much good. Thousands have been left without power.\n\nYou've heard of taking cars for a joyride, but one Oklahoma woman is in jail for stealing a different set of wheels. Mindy Jones, 28, made off with a $120,000 ambulance this week. She told police she swiped it while she was at a hospital for a blood test. Jones led police on a short chase before parking the vehicle outside her own home. Jones is being held on $4,000 bond.\n\nSeven weeks after a tanker truck destroyed it, the 9 mile road overpass above I-75 is back open. The bridge was destroyed in July after a driver slammed into a tanker truck sending that vehicle out of control. Michigan got federal approval to get the project done as quickly as possible by keeping workers on site 24 hours a day. The work was part of a $12 million project that will include rebuilding a mile long stretch of I-75."
