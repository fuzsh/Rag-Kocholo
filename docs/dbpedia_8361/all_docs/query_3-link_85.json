        "meta_description": "To Mee Navhech is a classic Marathi-language play written by Acharya Atre based on the court case of Madhav Kazi, who was an active criminal during the years between 1955 and 1960. Though the protagonist role has been played by many actors since its inception in 1962, the role of Lakhoba Lokhande played by Prabhakar Panshikar is the most memorable. To Mee Navhech is probably the first play in the world where the same actor has to do five completely different roles, not to merely add to novelty value or as a stunt, but because the story demands it. To Mee Navhech was also among the first Marathi plays to make use of the Revolving Stage between two scenes. This is also translated in many regional languages. The play has crossed over 3000 shows in total over a span of 52 years which itself is a record.",
