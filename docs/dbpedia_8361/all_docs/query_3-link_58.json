        "text": "Following in the footsteps of a successful Mithai business established by Shri Diwakar Panshikar at Dadar Mumbai, Maharashtra. He promoted the firm Panshikar Samarth Dugdhalaya in 1956 at Ranade road, Dadar which is called as heart of Mumbai city.\n\nThe firm began its operations in Mumbai city and is still in existence there as a major Sweets / Namkeen selling outlet. In 1971 Shri Mahadev Panshikar elder son of Shri Diwakar Panshikar started managing the business. He was affectionately called as “Sonuseth”. Between 1971 & 1991 Shri Diwakar & Mahadev Panshikar were running a Hotel at the same place with eatables like Batata & Sabudana Vada, Pohe, Sheera, Misal, Masala Milk, Piyush, etc. Later they realized that their main interest lies in dairy products only.\n\nSince 1995 after completing graduation the third generation Shri Ashish Panshikar son of Shri Mahadev Panshikar joined the business. While running the business he completed his post-graduation in LLB. He expanded the business by supplying products in malls in and around Mumbai & all over Maharashtra. The staff who is very efficient & hardworking belongs from Ratnagiri & is working with the firm for more than 25 years. Mr. Raja Nakhye who is the Manager at the outlet is serving with the firm since last 35 years & handles mainly the packaging area during the Diwali Festival. The main reason of fantastic packing for the compliments we get from worldwide customers that they received the products safely solely goes to Mr. Nakhye & his team. A comprehensive infrastructure, in terms of skilled manpower, distribution hubs at key locations and a wide & strong distributor network is in place to take care of all the business needs of the concern."
