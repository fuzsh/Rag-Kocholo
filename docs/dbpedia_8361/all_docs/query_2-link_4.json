        "text": "Nine years later I saw him at a jam-packed Shanmukhanand Hall for the 1,000th performance of the record-breaking play which speaks of Indian middle class gullibility in matters of marriage.\n\nIn 2008, I bought a ticket at Yashwant Natya Mandir (in black) to watch the 77-year-old actor doing the same roles, with the same energy (notwithstanding four surgeries) in the 2,833rd show of a play with which he was perennially associated.\n\nThat energy, that potent source of state vitality will not be seen any more. Prabhakar Panshikar (1931-2011), a well-actor, owner of the Natyasampada theatre company, a vital voice of Marathi representing theatre producers, lovingly called Pant, is no more.\n\nPrabhakar Panshikar\n\nFor ever remembered for the role of Lakhoba Lokhande, ever since playwright Acharya Atre wrote To Mee Navhech in 1962, watching Panshikar on stage was a delight.\n\nLakhoba was a fraudster who lured women into marriage. Based on a real-life incident, the courtroom drama, criticised parents who’re duped by ostensibly wealthy prospective grooms in their haste to get their daughters married.\n\nDespite its serious theme, the play became hugely entertaining because of its attention-grabbing gimmicks: a revolving stage, quick costume changes and Lakhoba’s six colourful avatars.\n\nThe play was immensely popular and also translated in other Indian languages. In Maharashtra politics, Lakhoba Lokhande became a metaphor for slyness. Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray often called the defected Chaggan Bhujbal by this name.\n\nAn old school method actor, Panshikar has several popular plays to his credit, including Bhatala Dili Osari, Ithe Oshalla Mrutyu, Ashrunchi Zali Phule, Thank You Mr Glad, Jevha Gavtala Bhale Phuttat. He was also one of the few theatre producers who consistently nourished a theatre repertoire.\n\nAs he aged and became frail in health, he passed on the unit to his younger kin. But he never lost his interest in theatre.\n\nThough Panshikar had a definite right-wing political leaning, and he made no attempts to hide it, he was a very affable theatre person, some one ready for a friendly chat at his Shivaji Mandir office.\n\nA true ‘Natyakarmi’ who set aside all leanings while choosing scripts. In this regards his production of Kimayagar (1993), the three-act play on the life of Helen Keller, set in Alabama of late nineteenth century, is notable. He had brought together the talents of many artistes like Sadashiv Amrapurkar and Bhakti Barve for this true-to-life story.\n\nA recipient of many national and state-level honours, Panshikar was a feted actor, but firmly rooted in the Maharashtrian ethos."
