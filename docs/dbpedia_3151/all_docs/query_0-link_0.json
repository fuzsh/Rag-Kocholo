        "text": "2003 studio album by Brian Eno\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[1]\n\nJanuary 07003 (stylized in all caps and subtitled: Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now) is the twenty-first solo studio album by Brian Eno, released in 2003.\n\nThis is an album of studies made for the Long Now Foundation, an organization founded in 1996 that aims to \"provide a counterpoint to what it views as today's 'faster/cheaper' mindset and to promote 'slower/better' thinking\".\n\nOne of their projects involves the construction of a clock, designed by W. Daniel Hillis, intended to keep time for 10,000 years. The first prototype of the clock is working and on permanent display at the London Science Museum. Eno, a member of the foundation, created this album both as a tribute to the project, and as an artistic expression of the vast swathes of time represented by the sheer \"long-termness\" of the philosophy behind the clock. About the workings of the record, Eno stated that he \"naturally wondered what kind of sound it could make to announce the passage of time\" and that he \"had nurtured an interest in bells for many years, and this seemed like a good alibi for taking it a bit deeper\".\n\nThe sounds on the album are entirely synthesizer-based, although Eno studied the actual physics of bell tones in order to simulate the kinds of bells familiar to modern ears. He also tried to imagine what bells might sound like in the future, which took him \"out of the bounds of current physical and material possibilities .... imagine bells with quite different physical properties from those we now know\". To that end, mathematical algorithms were also used to generate some of the sounds; Eno also made use of his generative software. Most of the tracks are also accompanied by a variety of standard, synth-based ambient backdrops and drones. Profits from the sale of this album are donated to the Long Now Foundation.\n\nAll songs composed by Brian Eno.\n\nFixed ratio harmonic bells - 23:22\n\nChanges where bell number = repeat number - 03:30\n\n2 harmonic studies - 06:05\n\nDeep glass bells (with harmonic clouds) - 03:17\n\nDark cracked bells with bass - 01:59\n\nGerman-style ringing - 03:19\n\nEmphasizing enharmonic partials - 03:01\n\nChanges for January 07003, soft bells, Hillis algorithm - 10:40\n\nLithuanian bell study - 01:26\n\nLarge bell change improvisation - 01:23\n\nReverse harmonics bells - 02:45\n\nBell Improvisation 2 - 01:40\n\nVirtual dream bells, thick glass - 03:59\n\nTsar Kolokol III (and friends) - 03:59\n\n1â€“14 January 07003, hard bells, Hillis algorithm - 05:09\n\nLater, the same year, a short CD was sent out to wine dealers to promote Pelissero's Long Now wine (named in honour of the foundation). It included a further five Bell Studies; some being variants of existing material and others previously unreleased. The interactive track on the CD has nothing to do with Eno. The track listing was as follows:\n\nStudy 16 (x5, x3, series ratios) - 2:32\n\nStudy 17 (pythagorean ratios) - 4:12\n\nIf a bell became a drone... - 2:14\n\nCampion Bells (invert harmonics) - 2:25\n\nBell Study with distant delays - 5:22\n\nOpal, OPALCD 02"
