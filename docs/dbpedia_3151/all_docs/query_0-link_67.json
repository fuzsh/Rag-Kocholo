        "text": "they're all essential (no one really needs 'On A Land Of Clear Colours' or 'Peter And The Wolf', though)\n\nGrowing up in the 70s, Eno was the closest thing to an idol I had. A rock musician who actually marketed himself as being intelligent, as though it were an asset; what a concept! Especially the Obscure series; God, I loved those.\n\n'(No Pussyfooting)' A+++ possibly my favorite album of all time.\n\n'Here Come The Warm Jets' A\n\n'Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)' A+\n\n'Another Green World' A+\n\n'Discreet Music' A++\n\n'Music For Films' (director's cut) B\n\n'Evening Star' A+\n\n'801 Live' A+\n\n'Cluster & Eno' A+\n\n'Before And After Science' A\n\n'After The Heat' A\n\n'Music For Films' A+\n\n'Music For Airports' A+\n\n'The Plateaux Of Mirror' A\n\n'Possible Musics' A+\n\n'My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts' A+\n\n'On Land' A+\n\n'Apollo - Atmospheres & Soundtracks' A+\n\n'Music For Films Volume II' B+\n\n'The Pearl' A\n\n'Thursday Afternoon' A\n\n'Wrong Way Up' B+\n\n'Nerve Net' A+\n\n'The Shutov Assembly' A\n\n'Neroli' A\n\n'Box I' A+\n\n'Box II' A+\n\n'The Essential Fripp & Eno' A-\n\n'Headcandy' - ? never got it, a reissue would be VERY welcome\n\n'Spinner' B\n\nPassengers - 'Original Soundtracks 1' - ? never got it. my dislike for U2 overwhelmed my love for Eno.\n\nJames/Eno - 'Wah Wah' - ? never got it. my dislike for James overwhelmed my love for Eno. I did buy the 'Spinner' album, though, even though I'm not a Wobble fan, and was underimpressed by it, so I kinda got soured on Eno collaborations with people whose work I don't much like.\n\n'The Drop' A+ (am I the only one loves this album?)\n\n'Music For White Cube' A\n\n'Contra 1.2' -? painfuly rare; never seen it, never heard it, never owned it. only heard about it.\n\nHarmonia - Tracks & Traces' -D dreadful; should have been left in the vault.\n\n'Lightness' A+\n\nbonus disc included with the French edition of 'Swollen Appendices' - ? never seen it, never heard it, never owned it. only heard about it.\n\n'I Dormienti' B\n\n'Kite Stories' A+\n\n'Music For Onmyoji' - I never got it. It was pretty common in stores here when it came out but, at $80 or so, fairly expensive. Financial cowardice and procrastination got the better of me. Now I'm sad.\n\n'Music For Civic Recovery Centre' A\n\n'Compact Forest Proposal' A\n\n'Drawn From Life' B\n\n'January 07003 - Bell Studies For The Clock Of The Long Now' A+\n\n'Curiosities Volume 1' B\n\n'The Equatorial Stars' A\n\n'Curiosities Volume 2' ? still haven't got it yet.\n\n'Another Day On Earth' A+\n\nI think that's everthing (I had some time to kill, too.)\n\nI dunno. The sound's okay (if you're a fan of SBM) but they did remix some tracks. Jus enough to annoy me whenever I listen to 'em.\n\nPlus, the packaging's not great; the glue seeps out and sticks the digipacks to the inside of the box. Prying them out requires pliers. AND the glue discolors the cardboard.\n\nI'd be happier with the box sets if they'd at least made an effort to mix the sings up a bit. You get most of each album, but in the same running order as the LPs. And they don't include ANYTHING from '(No Pussyfooting)'! (not even the 'Later On' b-side).\n\nNot to mention that it was pretty arrogant for them to, mere months after issuing these (@$75 each) put out 'The Essential Fripp & Eno' comp. What, Virgin hadn't milked quite enough cash out of us that they couldn't have included the 'Healthy Colours' track(s) in the box sets instead?\n\nIf the box sets had been better designed, had moved around the track orders more, and included a reasonable number of non-LP tracks, I might have been more enthusiastic.\n\nAlso, about half the tracks in the Vocal box are instrumental. What's up with that?"
