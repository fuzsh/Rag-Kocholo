This past Easter, St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church unveiled their new bell tower to the community, thanks to an anonymous donor. This unique tower shows the beauty of the refurbished bells with its open and “arch” like design.\n\nhttps://www.verdin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SANY6894-Copy-1.jpg 359 750 Verdin Marketing https://www.verdin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VERDINLogo_retina.jpg Verdin Marketing2022-08-11 13:07:182023-01-27 11:13:44Power of Bells\n\nCarillon Restoration for the Ages\n\nA 57 bell carillon restoration for the ages. In 2021, The Verdin Company completed a restoration for First-Plymouth Congregational Church. Located in Lincoln, Nebraska, the Church features a 171 foot tower.

The Verdin Company recently acquired a post card sent to customers in 1961 off of Ebay. This historical piece encouraged us to remember bells cast throughout the years. From smooth cast to decorative embossed bells, take a look at some beautiful bronze bells from the past.\n\nhttps://www.verdin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1961-Post-Card-Back.jpg 1497 2329 Verdin Marketing https://www.verdin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VERDINLogo_retina.jpg Verdin Marketing2022-03-03 13:27:472022-11-21 15:04:14Historical Cast Bells"
