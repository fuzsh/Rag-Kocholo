It was the early 1980s. Eno was 33, his debut as co-founder of groundbreaking British band Roxy Music almost a decade behind him. In the intervening years he had invented ambient music, helped reinvent the likes of David Bowie, Devo and Talking Heads. Still his mother was worried. \"'Do you think you'll ever get a real job Brian?' she said. This was long after I'd bought them a nice house with the proceeds of my rock'n'roll money,\" says Eno. \"I said, 'Well, what were you thinking Mum?' My dad was a postman I should tell you. And she said: 'Well, you could easily get a job in the post office.'\" She'd loved glam rock, his mullet and make-up years. (\"He was a very glamorous young man,\" Bowie said of the Eno of the era. \"I was very jealous.\") \"She thought it was fun, like dressing up,\" Eno recalls. \"But because it looked like such fun she didn't think it could ever become a job. It was 'Well, that's fine when you're young but sooner or later you have to start thinking about a mortgage'. She used to say to me 'Can't you just do one thing?'\" You can see Mrs Eno's point. Over four decades, her son has given Bowie a run for the title of contemporary music's most elusive shape-shifter. As a composer he pioneered ambient, electronic and generative music, and popularised music sampling. As producer and collaborator, he was there for the heyday of many of the most significant artists of the past four decades, from early '70s Roxy Music to the Bowie of the Berlin trilogy (Low, Heroes, Lodger) later in the decade; Talking Heads, Ultravox! and Devo as the '70s ticked over; U2 from the 1980s; everyone from Laurie Anderson and Jane Siberry to British band James in the '90s and, most recently, the Coldplay of 2008's best seller, Viva la Vida. Nor was he just there. In a lot of cases, he was that heyday. Roxy Music was never again quite the same cutting-edge cultural force after his brief reign as Bryan Ferry's rouged and befeathered consort; Jane Siberry never again shuddered into focus as she had in the lush Eno-produced soundscape of 1993's When I Was A Boy. He helped resurrect Bowie, taught Talking Heads to dance, turned U2 from raw Irish pro-claimers into polished postmodern pranksters. \"A lot of English rock'n'roll bands went to art school,\" Bono famously quipped. \"We went to Brian.\" And at 61, as his contemporaries settle into repetition or self-parody, Eno continues to expand his repertoire. Having created the start-up sound for Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system - on an Apple - he recently released an iPhone application, Bloom, which turns users into audio-visual artists via their touch screens or that, left to its own devices, endlessly improvises its own ambient music and images. All of which makes it sound as if he might have taken the 'Eno is God' graffiti that proliferated in New York in the 1970s a little too seriously (as one fan site puts it: \"It's Eno's world; the rest of us just live in it\"). In fact, his sprawling opus has been a byproduct of a relentless quest for open - meaning new - ground, he told The AFR Magazine on the eve of his first trip to Australia to curate the Sydney Opera House's inaugural Luminous Festival. \"What I always get excited about is being somewhere I've never been before, in a new landscape,\" he says down the line from London, where he is putting the finishing touches to a typically Eno program that bridges music, the visual arts and ideas. \"You know that famous song from Oklahoma [The Farmer and the Cowboy] basically highlighting the different kinds of personalities: the one who breaks the ground, goes through and finds new places and territories, and the other who settles down and exploits it?\" he asks. \"I think I'm the cowboy. I like the pioneering bit, getting there first; the feeling that, 'huh, nobody else has been here before'.\" It's that questing spirit that brings him to Australia, a trip he postponed because he hates flying until he has \"something serious to do\", he says, adding: \"and this is about as serious as you can get\". Luminous is an artist-in-residence program run wild, from Eno's constantly evolving image and sound installation, 77 Million Paintings, to performances from long-time collaborators such as King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp and self-described 'Fourth World' composer and trumpeter Jon Hassell, and acolytes such as British electronica outfit Ladytron (named for a 1972 Roxy Music song) and celebrated New York noise artists Battles. The program also includes '90s trip hop and dub artist Lee 'Scratch' Perry, Irish songwriter and Eno-collaborator Damien Dempsey, and Coldplay opening act Jon Hopkins. Eno will also hold 'conversations' with the artists and visiting guests, including Texan neuroscientist David Eagleman (\"he shares an interest with me in the topic of imagination and how imagination actually works\") and Zen lawyer and ClientEarth founder James Thornton (\"in my opinion, one of the really interesting NGOs at the moment\"). The whole shebang will culminate, appropriately enough, in a one-off concert on June 14, called Pure Scenius (the genius of a time and place) produced by Eno out of the festival. \"When the project first came up, I was excited about using the Opera House because it's one of the world's distinctive buildings,\" Eno says. \"But then, as it developed, it grew into something I've never done before, actually, which is curating a scene of some kind.\" It wasn't until he was writing his program introduction that he noticed an organising principle, he says. \"I was thinking 'OK, I'd better tell people a little about what these people are like' and, in most cases, I thought 'they're not really like anyone'. I realised that the thing that they all had in common was that they were all outliers, as Malcolm Gladwell would say, working in the places in between. I thought 'yes, I guess that is actually what I like; I enjoy people who become their own category'.\" Or, as in his case, continue to elude categorisation. The idea of repeating himself is, he says, \"anathema to me. I don't know why ... I think it's because it makes me feel old ... I can't think personally of any honourable reason for doing re-creations; in the sense that you'd only do it for the money really.\" It's why he's never minded that his innovations are often more successfully exploited by others. With its deft postmodern pillaging of vintage recordings, US techno artist Moby's 1999 global smash Play, for instance, became the soundtrack to end the millennium. The record it pillaged most thoroughly was Eno's pioneering sampling album with David Byrne, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, released nearly two decades earlier. \"Yes, I agree,\" he says when asked about the resemblance. \"It's interesting though that, in some respects, Moby did it better. It very often happens that the people who break the ground aren't necessarily in a position to exploit it best. You're so thrilled to have got there; it's the thrill you hear when you listen to something and say 'I love that' ... the thrill of someone being thrilled. So, while I love Bush of Ghosts, I can also see that, by comparison to what Moby was doing, it's kind of primitive; why his stuff was an international hit and it wasn't.\" Issues of proprietorship seem to bore him. As author Eric Tam has noted, Eno's own work has enjoyed an acclaim entirely out of proportion to actual units sold. Others have said his largest legacy may lie in the more popular artists he's influenced or produced. \"I don't mind really how it comes out,\" he says. \"I'm quite happy to work with other people and I will put whatever ideas I can into that work and I don't really mind whether it gets called their record or my record in the end. I just like getting the ideas out of the way, because they don't hang around for very long; they get stale if you don't use them.\" Speaking to Brian Eno is a disconcerting experience. What you get, at least on the phone, is more like a courteous, highly cultured and engaged British academic, minus the academese. \"He displayed a normalcy that I just couldn't trust,\" Chrissie Hynde wrote in a 1974 profile for New Music Express that coincided with his solo debut Here Come The Warm Jets. \"He just didn't come on like someone who keeps an extensive collection of breast bondage literature in the bathroom.\" Then again, keeping things weird has always been an essential part of project Eno. Raised near a US Air Force base in rural Sussex in the UK, his formative musical memory is listening to doo-wop on American Armed Forces radio. It's the sort of seminal moment that litters the history of British pop: American R &\n\nEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebook\n\nSubscribe to gift this article\n\nGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLatest In Politics\n\nFetching latest articles\n\nMost Viewed In Politics"
