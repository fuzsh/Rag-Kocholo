The extraordinary clock is under construction inside a mountain in West Texas, according to Fox News.\n\nBezos first announced his intention to get behind the clock in 2011, saying, \"It’s a special clock, designed to be a symbol, an icon for long-term thinking,\" according to Daily Mail. Construction reportedly started in 2018.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?\n\nMany NBA players, including LeBron James, have ventured into fine wine investments as an alternative asset. Now you can too with just $25.\n\nThe 500-foot-tall clock, a vision of computer scientist Danny Hillis, is engineered to endure for thousands of years. It operates using Earth's thermal cycles, incorporating elements such as a solar synchronizer, a pendulum, a chime generator and various gears and dials. The clock will tick once a year, a unique feature emphasizing its long-term purpose.\n\nBuilt to endure the test of time, the clock is constructed to withstand natural forces such as temperature changes, humidity and dust. This resilience ensures its longevity and functionality over the millennia. Most of its components are made of marine-grade stainless steel and high-tech ceramics, chosen for their durability.\n\nThe clock's chime generator is capable of creating more than 3.5 million unique bell chime sequences, ensuring no two days will sound alike. It is synchronized with the moon and sun to track the year, century and millennium.\n\nTrending: Join the ranks of investors like Bill Gates and Mark Cuban by tapping into early-stage startups.\n\nThe clock will feature five room-sized anniversary chambers, each marking significant milestones: the first-, 10th-, 100th, 1,000th- and 10,000th-year anniversaries. The chambers are designed for future generations to fill, thereby continuing the legacy of the clock.\n\nA spokesman for the Long Now Foundation said a completion date has not been set. Because the clock will be in the remote Sierra Mountains of Texas, visitors will need to take a significant hike to reach it, an experience designed to provoke contemplation and reflection.\n\nBezos is known for his immense wealth and luxurious lifestyle, which includes ownership of a massive 417-foot yacht worth approximately $500 million, and a support yacht valued at $75 million. His real estate portfolio further exemplifies this extravagance, featuring a $79 million mansion in Florida’s “Billionaire Bunker” and a $68 million home nearby, along with other lavish properties like a 9-acre Beverly Hills mansion purchased for $165 million and an estate in Maui, Hawaii​.\n\nWhile his super yachts and multiple mansions represent the pinnacle of immediate, tangible luxury, the clock symbolizes a radically different value: the importance of leaving behind a legacy for the future.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAre Wall Street’s days numbered?
