Stonewall Uprising is an important documentary -- and a passionate and compassionate reconstruction of the historic standoff between police and pubcrawlers.

The directors score a coup in getting testimony from the police officer who led the raid, a now-elderly gentleman who freely confesses the fear that rippled through his unit, and his regrets in having been on the wrong side of history.

It comes alive through the memories of those who were there.

Pplaces the incident within the context of the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960s with PBS-caliber tact and compassion.

Stonewall Uprising is first and foremost about people. Politics and history and sexuality are there, too, but they're subsidiary to the human stories the documentary tells.

On the one hand, Stonewall Uprising shows how far we've come toward enlightenment and tolerance since that hot June night. On the other, it reminds us that there are still many minds to change and rights to win.

Entertainment WeeklyOwen Gleiberman

This all-new assemblage of rare home-movie footage, photographs, and gripping testimony from people who were there -- including one of the cops who led the raid -- allows us to experience a landmark civil rights event in a fresh and fascinating way.

Stonewall Uprising methodically ticks off the forms of oppression visited on gays and lesbians in the days before the gay rights movement.

Slant MagazineEric Henderson

Stonewall Uprising deploys familiar PSA-cum-hate-crimes like the infamous "Boys Beware" with very little restraint in order to truly establish Stonewall's prehistory as a No M2M's Land.

Excellent source of information for those who know little of this monumental occurrence, but for those with no need for a Stonewall riots 101, it has little to offer.

VarietyRonnie Scheib

Cohesive, well-structured docu from veteran filmmakers Kate Davis and David Heilbroner boasts a panoply of found footage, graphically positioning the uprising as a flashpoint following decades of repression.

Village VoiceMelissa Anderson

The memories of those who were definitely there during those momentous days in late June are undeniably powerful... But are their voices best served by the messy documentary in which they appear?

St. Paul Pioneer PressChris Hewitt

More than half of the documentary isn't about Stonewall at all, which makes for a frustrating 49-minute wait until the uprising begins to rise up.

NYC Movie GuruAvi Offer

Heartfelt and engagingly filmed, but not nearly as insightful as it could have been with sharper, more provocative questions asked.
