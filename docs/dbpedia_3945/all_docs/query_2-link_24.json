The Stonewall Inn in New York City's West Village neighborhood is now a national monument, the White House announced. \"Today, President Obama will designate a new national monument at the historic site of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City to honor the broad movement for Lgbt equality,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday. \"The new Stonewall National Monument will protect the area where, on June 28, 1969, a...\n\nLorna Luft, daughter of the late Judy Garland, gave an emotional performance of her mother's signature tune \"Over the Rainbow\" at New York City's Feinstein's/54 Below on Wednesday night - the first she's ever given of the song, she says. \"I've never sung this song,\" Luft told concertgoers before the performance. \"Not because it was too hard for me emotionally, but because I always felt you can't improve on perfect.

Nearly 20 years ago, though, Díaz was an emerging actor who’d just starred opposite Parker Posey in Party Girl and was looking for a breakout gig. Enter Stonewall.\n\nDíaz booked his first leading role as La Miranda, a larger-than-life drag queen (and I’m not just talking about her hair), in Nigel Finch’s fictionalized account of the days leading up to the birth of the modern Lgbt rights movement...\n\nHere is last week’s caption pic winner. This week’s caption pic is at the bottom of the page.\n\nThanks to everyone for participating! The winner is …\n\n“Alvin, there are some things you just can’t tuck”\n\nThanks to Rob for this week’s winning caption!\n\nWeekend Birthdays! Ed Westwick (above) is 26, Kathy Bates is 65, John Cusack is 47, Lizzy Caplan is 31, and Brian Bloom is 43 (more with him on page two).\n\nAnd 3 … 2 … 1 … Prestigious New Yorker magazine irresponsibly promotes child endangerment.\n\nTyler Coates isn’t too happy with the cover, either.\n\nWill Supreme Court Rulings GiveThe Front Runner Film Momentum?\n\nTV Line is reporting that Heather Morris, Mark Salling, Harry Shum Jr. and Amber Riley will not be returning to Glee as regular cast members, but may make occasional appearances. Well, considering that Mark, Harry, and Amber were basically guest stars last season, the only real difference this year will be Heather.\n\nIf it's too cold to leave the house for your local theater, there's plenty of options if you stay inside online, on demand and on DVD. What follows is your guide to all the new releases coming your way between now and April.\n\nOnline and On Demand\n\nMy French Film Festival\n\nThanks to bids for Oscar consideration, the winter is traditionally one of the rare times foreign films get plenty of attention in the States, particularly at West Coast festivals such as Palm Springs and Santa Barbara. However, Francophiles in particular will be excited to know you won't have to go to California or New York -- or even Paris for that matter -- to be able to catch some of the most recent cinema from France since uniFrance is unveiling My French Film Festival, which is being billed as the \"first exclusively online film festival celebrating French talent\" that...\n\nSubmitting to or running from oppressive cops was the norm for the gay community in New York City back in the 50’s and 60’s, but, like Stonewall Uprising’s new poster’s tagline says, “on June 28th, 1969, everything changed.” When a small group of officers raided the Stonewall Inn, not only did the patrons fight back, but a massive crowd formed in front of the establishment. The arrival of more cops only added fuel to the fire and the riot continued through the night, the following two nights and eventually gave rise to what is now known as the Gay Pride Parade. Is this news to you? Then checking out Kate Davis [...]...\n\nAnd so now we catch up on a couple of very good films that opened last week, but because there's only so much podcasting I can do before my ears start to bleed, I had to wait a week to be covered. In the case of the film featured in this episode, Stonewall Uprising, the delay turns out not to be too bad: we're still in the midst of Pride Week, after all, so this documentary remains relevant. This is from Kate Davis and David Heilbroner, whom we met earlier this year with the release of their black metal documentary Waiting for Armageddon. There are fewer church burnings in Stonewall, but that doesn't mean the event depicted -- a 1969 NYC riot sparked when the police raided a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn and the patrons decided they'd had...\n\nThis Sunday, when millions of people, gay and straight, congregate on the streets and sidewalks of New York City for the NYC Pride March to watch gyrating Altoids guys and floats sponsored by multinational corporations glide by, few are likely to think about — or know about — the origins of the march. The annual march has transformed into a joyous and glitzy affair embraced by corporations, politicians and the public, but it originated from a three day rebellion against the NYPD in front of the Stonewall Inn in NYC’s Greenwich Village 41 years ago by a motley group of down-on-their-luck queer street kids with nothing, and therefore nothing to lose.\n\nThe new documentary Stonewall Uprising by Kate Davis and David Heilbroner focuses in on the Stonewall Rebellion of June 28, 1969, its aftermath, and the cultural context in which it occurred. The documentary includes first hand accounts of those who witnessed the riots,...\n\nWhile we grapple with such problems as whether or not the recently out but obviously gay Sean Hayes is believable as a heterosexual in love with Kristen Chenowith in the delightful Broadway revival of Promises Promises, it is good to remember this privileged debate is hard won. Going back to a time when same sex coupling was a crime, marriage unthinkable, a new documentary, Stonewall Uprising, directed by Kate Davis and David Heilbroner, closely following David Carter's book, Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution, has now opened at Film Forum and tells the amazing story of this evolution in human rights. Tracing the untoward history of gay liberation in America, from what it was like in the 'sixties, a fairly recent past, when homosexuality was demonized, and thought to be a disease that might be cured with electric..."
