        "text": "Today, President Obama designated a new national monument at the historic site of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City to honor the broad LGBT equality movement.\n\nThe new ‘Stonewall National Monument’ will protect the area where, on June 28, 1969, a community’s uprising in response to a police raid sparked the modern LGBT civil rights movement in the United States.\n\nCheck out the video to learn more about the Stonewall Uprising and how it sparked a movement for LGBT equality:\n\n“I’m designating the Stonewall National Monument as the newest addition to America’s National Park System. Stonewall will be our first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBT rights. I believe our national parks should reflect the full story of our country, the richness and diversity and uniquely American spirit that has always defined us. That we are stronger together. That out of many, we are one.”\n\nPresident Obama\n\nIn addition to protecting more land and water than any President in history -- more than 265 million acres -- President Obama has sought to protect places that are diverse, culturally and historically significant, and that reflect the story of all Americans.\n\nEarlier this year, President Obama designated the Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument, a site that has been central to the fight for women's equality for over a century.\n\nBy honoring the history and accomplishments of the movement for LGBT equality, today’s designation will be a historic moment in this effort towards a more inclusive National Park System.\n\nThe President’s designation of Stonewall National Monument is just one example of his ongoing commitment to equality, for all Americans no matter who they love. Find out about just a few of the President's actions to advance justice and equality for all, including LGBT Americans:\n\nPreventing Hate Crimes: Overcoming years of partisan gridlock, the President worked with Congress to pass and sign into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in October 2009, which extends the coverage of federal hate crimes law to include attacks based on the victim’s actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nEnding Discrimination in Healthcare: In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law by President Obama and it ensured that companies can not discriminate against anyone just because he or she is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.\n\nHIV/AIDS Strategy: President Obama developed and released the first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States in 2010, updated it through 2020, and is implementing it to address the disparities faced especially by gay and bisexual men of all races and ethnicities and transgender women of color.\n\nRepealing Don’t Ask Don’t Tell: The President signed bipartisan legislation to repeal Don’t Ask Don’t Tell on December 22, 2010, allowing gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans to serve openly in the Armed Forces without fear of being dismissed from service.\n\nNo longer enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act: In February 2011, the President and Attorney General announced that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act’s provision defining marriage under federal law as only between a man and woman, a provision subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by a landmark Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nProhibiting LGBT Discrimination for Federal Contractors: In July 2014, the President signed an Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against any employee or applicant for employment “because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin,” continuing to set an example as a model employer that does right by its employees.\n\nConversion Therapy: The President has supported legislative efforts to ban the use of so-called “conversion therapy” against minors and released a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) study condemning the practice."
