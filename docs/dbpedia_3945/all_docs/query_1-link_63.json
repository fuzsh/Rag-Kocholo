        "text": "The Visitor Center will open to the public on June 28, marking the 55th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising.\n\nNew York, NY – The Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center (SNMVC) – the first LGBTQ+ visitor center within the National Park Service – will officially open its doors on Friday, June 28, signifying a landmark achievement in American history. Marking the 55th anniversary of the groundbreaking Stonewall Rebellion, this day stands as a powerful testament to the unyielding spirit that helped ignite the worldwide LGBTQ+ rights movement.\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center is a program of Pride Live in partnership with the National Park Service (NPS), a bureau of the Department of the Interior. The Visitor Center encompasses 2,100 square feet at 51 Christopher Street, between Waverly Place and 7th Avenue South in New York City.\n\n“History was forever changed for the better here, and now millions of people can immerse themselves in the story of Stonewall,“ Theresa Pierno, President and CEO for the National Parks Conservation Association. “The power of place can be felt walking through the Greenwich Village streets where people stood up and spoke out, paving the way for equality for all. When you explore the new visitor center, you’re learning from and honoring those courageous people. Stonewall will continue to inspire for generations and we’re proud to work to help ensure our national parks include diverse, inclusive stories that welcome and represent the people that shaped our nation.”\n\nDesignated by President Barack Obama on June 24, 2016, the Stonewall National Monument includes the 0.19-acre formerly known as Christopher Park and the surrounding streets including Christopher Street adjacent to the park. The Stonewall National Monument is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ+ rights and history.\n\nAmidst the historic backdrop of Greenwich Village, the iconic Stonewall Inn occupied two adjoining storefronts at 51 and 53 Christopher Street and stood as a beacon of resilience on June 28, 1969, when the Stonewall Rebellion took place. Forever changing the course of the LGBTQ+ movement, the events that transpired on this day became one of the most pivotal moments in the fight for full equality. In the years that followed, the physical space underwent transformations, including separating into two separate businesses with the current bar at 53 Christopher Street reopening its doors in 1990. Meanwhile, 51 Christopher Street housed a number of different businesses.\n\n“The National Park Service eagerly anticipates the official opening of the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center in partnership with Pride Live on June 28,” said National Park Service Director Chuck Sams. “NPS staff are dedicated to sharing the history of the Stonewall Uprising and the ongoing struggle for LGBTQIA+ equality.”\n\nThe historic project began six years ago and has been led by two Queer women of color: Pride Live Co-Founders Diana Rodriguez and Ann Marie Gothard, who embarked on a mission to celebrate and preserve the legacy of Stonewall.\n\n“The journey to create the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center has been a truly remarkable and landmark moment,” said Ann Marie Gothard (she/her), Chair of the Board of Directors, Pride Live. “This required the tireless support of countless partners who are deeply committed to preserving history. With the opening of the Visitor Center, we pay homage to the brave individuals behind the historic Stonewall Rebellion. We hope it stands as an enduring and resilient symbol and serves as a beacon for generations to come, providing the unique opportunity to step foot on the site where history unfolded and where the fight for LGBTQIA+ equality was ignited.”\n\nServing as an educational resource, the Visitor Center will offer an immersive experience featuring a rich tapestry of LGBTQIA+ history and culture through a variety of engaging programs, including in-person and virtual tours, informative lecture series, captivating exhibitions, a dedicated theater space, and inspiring visual arts displays. Upon entering the center, visitors will be guided through a multifaceted learning experience that speaks to today’s generations, encouraging them to carry forward the Stonewall legacy and the ongoing fight for full equality.\n\nThe SNMVC will also serve as home base for the dedicated Stonewall National Monument NPS park rangers, who are committed to welcoming all visitors to this site of national significance.\n\n“The SNMVC will provide an enhanced visitor experience for those seeking to learn more about the historic movement for LGBTQIA+ equality that continues to this day. NPS looks forward to our continued partnership with Pride Live to celebrate and acknowledge the struggle for equality and accomplishments of the LGBTQIA+ community,” said National Park Manhattan Sites Superintendent Shirley McKinney.\n\nPride Live received significant support from the Mellon Foundation, which is a Founding Partner of the Visitor Center. Championing the establishment of the SNMVC exemplifies the work of the Mellon Foundation’s Monuments Project, which seeks to recalibrate the public knowledge and vision of the history of all communities and the multiplicity of the Americans who fought for justice and rights.\n\nCharter Founding Partners of the SNMVC include Google (the first corporate partner to sign onto the project), American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), Adam Lambert, Amazon, Booking.com, Christina Aguilera, Comcast NBCUniversal, Donatella Versace, Henry R.
