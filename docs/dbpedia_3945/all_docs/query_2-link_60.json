        "text": "Exhibition dates: 15th June – 20th June 2019\n\nAuction: 20th June, 2019 at 1:30pm\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (Gay Daddies)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\n“Born gay and free”\n\nI was born in 1958 and came out as a gay man in 1975, six short years after the Stonewall uprising, the nominal (the UK had decriminalised homosexuality in 1967) but official start of Gay Liberation around the world, especially in the United States of America. I survived the plague that hit in the early 1980s. A lot of my friend’s didn’t.\n\nThese fabulous photographs and lilting prose make wonderful bedfellows, shining a light on those very early years of outness, campness, empowerment and sexual and personal freedom pre HIV/AIDS. From Gay Daddies to Gay Teachers, from being nowhere (in sight) … to being everywhere. As Ginsberg eloquently proposes, “wearing their hearts on a banner for nothing but love.” Gay youth, dignity and equality, proud of my gay son whoever he may be.\n\nThere is such a sense of joy, happiness and love contained in these photographs. The two lads in “Untitled [summery mouths]” are redolent of the era. Cute as a button: platform shoes, tight flared jeans, keys hanging, hands clasped around, small waists, tight singlets, sultry curly hair. Disco love is in the air. I could have been one of these men, memories of those days, those halcyon 70s days.\n\nThere are heroes too. Marsha P. Johnson, performance artist, drag mother, transgender, gender nonconforming survival sex worker political activist human… probably murdered by thugs after the 1992 pride parade. And Harvey Milk, that assassinated visionary who became a martyr to the cause, marching in spirit with the crowd. The man carrying a wreath with his name – head down, black armband, gay rights t-shirt – is such a poignant image of the loss of a hero. And then Ginsberg’s text, “Harvey Milk died for your sins.” (He had initially written “our” but crossed it out).\n\nThat erasure is so important. I remember working at Channel 7 as a set painter in Melbourne in the late 1980s to pay for university. It was a typical male only workplace at the time, all “blokes”, and I was confronted one day by one of them about being openly gay. My response: I’m quite happy being how I am, it’s you that obviously has the problem. Why don’t you look at yourself first before you start attacking other people.\n\nThis is why it is so important that Ginsberg crossed out “our” and wrote “your” sins. LGBTQI people have not sinned. There just are. They have nothing to forgive themselves for. It is the prejudice of others that leads them to fight for dignity and equality. As one of the posters in the photographs says, “People should love one another regardless of race, religion, age or sex.” A men to that.\n\nDr Marcus Bunyan\n\nPS. The exhibition of these photographs is only on for a few days. Please see them if you can.\n\nThe photographs and text are used under “fair use” for the purposes of freedom of speech, research, education and informed comment.

He is considered to be one of the leading figures of both the Beat Generation during the 1950s and the counterculture that soon followed. He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism, and sexual repression and was known as embodying various aspects of this counterculture, such as his views on drugs, hostility to bureaucracy and openness to Eastern religions. He was one of many influential American writers of his time who were associated with the Beat Generation, including Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs.\n\nGinsberg is best known for his poem “Howl”, in which he denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States. In 1956, “Howl” was seized by San Francisco police and US Customs. In 1957, it attracted widespread publicity when it became the subject of an obscenity trial, as it described heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when sodomy laws made homosexual acts a crime in every U.S. state. “Howl” reflected Ginsberg’s own sexuality and his relationships with a number of men, including Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong partner. Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that “Howl” was not obscene, adding, “Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms?”\n\nGinsberg was a practicing Buddhist who studied Eastern religious disciplines extensively. He lived modestly, buying his clothing in second-hand stores and residing in downscale apartments in New York’s East Village. One of his most influential teachers was the Tibetan Buddhist Chögyam Trungpa, the founder of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. At Trungpa’s urging, Ginsberg and poet Anne Waldman started The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics there in 1974.\n\nGinsberg took part in decades of non-violent political protest against everything from the Vietnam War to the War on Drugs. His poem “September on Jessore Road”, calling attention to the plight of Bangladeshi refugees, exemplifies what the literary critic Helen Vendler described as Ginsberg’s tireless persistence in protesting against “imperial politics, and persecution of the powerless.”\n\nHis collection The Fall of America shared the annual U.S. National Book Award for Poetry in 1974. In 1979, he received the National Arts Club gold medal and was inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Ginsberg was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1995 for his book Cosmopolitan Greetings: Poems 1986-1992.\n\nFull text “Alan Ginsberg,” on the Wikipedia website\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (Miss Rollerind)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (Miss Rollerind) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nMiss Rollerind, queen of late 70s\n\ndisco world universe drama, observed by\n\na (gay??) black man on the asphalt.\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (COME!

Long before Berenice Abbott admonished him to always have a project, he undertook his first, in rural East Texas during 1970-1973. These photographs led to his first exhibition in September 1973, at The Open Mind Gallery in New York City.\n\nIn the 1970s he associated with a diverse group of photographers, notably Walker Evans, André Kertész and most importantly, Berenice Abbott, with whom he worked for the last 19 years of her life.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1999 (in addition to undertaking many photographic projects), O’Neal also published numerous books related to photography. In 1999, at the urging of gallery director Evelyn Daitz, he had a major retrospective of his work to that point at The Witkin Gallery. Since that time, he has focused his activities toward photography, and continues to mount exhibitions yearly throughout the U.S. and Canada. In 2003 his photographic career was summarised in a profile in The New York Times.\n\nBooks (text and illustrations)\n\nThe Eddie Condon Scrapbook of Jazz (St. Martin’s Press, 1973)\n\nA Vision Shared (St. Martin’s Press, 1976)\n\nBerenice Abbott – American Photographer (McGraw-Hill, 1982)\n\nLife Is Painful, Nasty and Short … In My Case It Has Only Been Painful and Nasty – Djuna Barnes L 1978-81 (Paragon, 1990)\n\nCharlie Parker (Filipacchi, 1995)\n\nThe Ghosts of Harlem (Filipacchi, 1997) French language edition\n\nThe Ghosts of Harlem (Vanderbilt University Press, 2009) English language edition\n\nHank O’Neal Portraits 1971-2000 (Sordoni Art Gallery, 2000)\n\nBillie & Lester in Oslo (A Play with Music, 2005)\n\nGay Day – The Golden Age of the Christopher Street Parade (Abrams, 2006)\n\nBerenice Abbott (Steidl, 2008)\n\nThe Unknown Berenice Abbott – Steidl (October 15, 2013)\n\nA Vision Shared – 40th Anniversary Edition – Steidl (December 1, 2016)\n\nBerenice Abbott – The Paris Portraits – Steidl (November 22, 2016)\n\nBooks (photographs only)\n\nAllegra Kent’s Water Beauty Book (St Martin’s Press, 1976)\n\nAll the King’s Men (Limited Editions Club, 1990)\n\nXCIA’s Street Art Project: The First Four Decades (Siman Media Works, 2012)\n\nPortfolios\n\nBerenice Abbott – Portraits In Palladium (Text Only, Commerce Graphics / Lunn Limited, 1990)\n\nHank O’Neal – Photographs (Text and 12 gravure prints), Limited Editions Club, 1990)\n\nThe Ghosts of Harlem (Text and 12 photographs), Glenside Press, 2007)\n\nText from “Hank O’Neal,” on the Wikipedia website\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled [MY SON IS GAY AND THAT’S OK]\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (MY SON IS GAY AND THAT’S OK) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nShe’s an old anarchist from the\n\n30’s.

Barbēlō is often depicted as a supreme female principle, the single passive antecedent of creation in its manifoldness. This figure is also variously referred to as ‘Mother-Father’ (hinting at her apparent androgyny), ‘First Human Being’, ‘The Triple Androgynous Name’, or ‘Eternal Aeon’. So prominent was her place amongst some Gnostics that some schools were designated as Barbeliotae, Barbēlō worshippers or Barbēlōgnostics.\n\nGnosticism (from Ancient Greek: γνωστικός gnostikos, “having knowledge”, from γνῶσις gnōsis, knowledge) is a modern name for a variety of ancient religious ideas and systems, originating in Jewish Christian milieux in the first and second century AD. These systems believed that the material world is created by an emanation or ‘works’ of a lower god (demiurge), trapping the divine spark within the human body. This divine spark could be liberated by gnosis, spiritual knowledge acquired through direct experience. Some of the core teachings include the following:\n\n1/ All matter is evil, and the non-material, spirit-realm is good.\n\n2/ There is an unknowable God, who gave rise to many lesser spirit beings called Aeons.\n\n3/ The creator of the (material) universe is not the supreme god, but an inferior spirit (the Demiurge).\n\n4/ Gnosticism does not deal with “sin,” only ignorance.\n\n5/ To achieve salvation, one needs gnosis (knowledge).\n\nLaldabaoth is the demiurge (a heavenly being, subordinate to the Supreme Being, that is considered to be the controller of the material world and antagonistic to all that is purely spiritual) from Gnostic Christianity.\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (a big crowd)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (a big crowd) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\na big crowd of boys + girls + …? – but\n\nthat tall girl looks worried, doesn’t she have a baloon?\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (STONEWALL CHORALE)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (STONEWALL CHORALE) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nMasculine & Feminine Sopranos!\n\nmarching on the Stone\n\nfloor on Manhattan, Explaining Life\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (WHERE IS your HUSBAND TONIGHT?)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (WHERE IS your HUSBAND TONIGHT?)

But, in its earliest days, the celebration was a much smaller event characterised by NY-style high energy, pithy signage, raucous crowd chants, extensive cruising and great music (remember disco?). Most of O’Neal’s photographs focused on NY’s West Village or Christopher Street, the epicenter of gaydom. A range of sub-cultures associated with the LGBTQ+ community are depicted: young and longhaired post-hippies, bare-chested muscle men, drag queens, fairies, leather-ites, Gay Daddies, protestors, pastors, parents of gays and the hikin’ dykes.\n\nSome participants hold placards, including those protesting Anita Bryant, the once popular singer, who emerged as an strident anti-gay crusader in the late 1970s and teamed up with the divisive evangelical figure Jerry Falwell. A banner for the Gay Men’s Health Project is a harbinger of the tragic era to come.\n\nGinsberg first saw the photographs in 1982 and, according to O’Neal, was inspired to add his distinctive captions to the backs of the prints. His brief handwritten notes, which often reflect personal or historic observations, strike a wonderful tone. A caption that accompanies a picture of a group of men holding the banner WE ARE EVERYWHERE reads, “We all look pretty normal, boy next door, handsome punk, ad man’s delight, daughters of the American Revolution.” A shot depicting two men dressed in ancient Roman costume reads, “Clark Gable and Nero on a date, smiling for the 1920s Hollywood photogs.” His lengthy caption for the Johnson print (featured on the catalog cover) reads: “If I keep dressing up like this I’ll save the world from nuclear apocalypse. But will anyone love me for it? I’ll save the world anyway I know that looks good.” And still others honour the courageous and brave: one participant holds a wreath bearing the name Harvey Milk; Ginsberg wrote, “Harvey Milk died for your sins.” (He had initially written “our” but crossed it out).\n\nO’Neal’s photographs were reproduced in the book, Gay Day: The Golden Age of the Christopher Street Parade, 1974-1983 (Abrams, 2006), with a Preface by William Burroughs. Interestingly during this same period Ginsberg had revisited his own Beat-era photographs, which were shot in the 1950s and processed at a local drugstore. He developed a unique hybrid picture-text style, adding detailed, handwritten mini-narratives to the lower margins of the prints, which captured his vivid, visual memories.\n\nText for the Swann Auction Galleries website [Online] Cited 30/05/2019.

Although he was the most pro-LGBT politician in the United States at the time, politics and activism were not his early interests; he was neither open about his sexuality nor civically active until he was 40, after his experiences in the counterculture movement of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1972, Milk moved from New York City to the Castro District of San Francisco amid a migration of gay and bisexual men. He took advantage of the growing political and economic power of the neighbourhood to promote his interests and unsuccessfully ran three times for political office. Milk’s theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and in 1977 he won a seat as a city supervisor. His election was made possible by a key component of a shift in San Francisco politics.\n\nMilk served almost eleven months in office, during which he sponsored a bill banning discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment on the basis of sexual orientation. The Supervisors passed the bill by a vote of 11-1 and was signed into law by Mayor Moscone. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, who was another city supervisor. White had recently resigned to pursue a private business enterprise, but that endeavour eventually failed and he sought to get his old job back. White was sentenced to seven years in prison for manslaughter, which was later reduced to five years. He was released in 1983 and committed suicide by carbon monoxide inhalation two years later.\n\nDespite his short career in politics, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr in the gay community. In 2002, Milk was called “the most famous and most significantly open LGBT official ever elected in the United States”. Anne Kronenberg, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: “What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us.” Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.\n\nExtract from “Harvey Milk,” on the Wikipedia website\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (Blacks are most truthful)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (Blacks are most truthful) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nBlacks are most truthful,\n\nit all goes back to deep\n\nafrican religious ?\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (Judy Garland)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (Judy Garland) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nJudy Garland’s got big-veined\n\nfists & activist boyfriends\n\nsinging\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (PEOPLE SHOULD LOVE ONE ANOTHER)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (PEOPLE SHOULD LOVE ONE ANOTHER) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nWell I’ll take 2 of these + 3 of those.\n\nHow old did you say you were?\n\nDoes that mean I have to sleep with 90 year old girls?\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (summery mouths)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (summery mouths) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nYoung meat Catholes (?)\n\nappreciating each other’s\n\nsummery mouths\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (ANITA SLEEPS WITH BIG BUSINESS)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (ANITA SLEEPS WITH BIG BUSINESS) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nAnita O’Day is still singing.\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (ANITA DEAR SHOVE IT)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (ANITA DEAR SHOVE IT) (verso)\n\n1974-1983\n\nFrom The Gay Day Archive\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nI’ll bet Anita had affairs in\n\nhigh school with her girlfriends.\n\nPretty Girl.\n\nAnita Bryant (American, b. 1940)\n\nAnita Jane Bryant (born March 25, 1940) is an American singer and political activist. …\n\nIn the 1970s, Bryant became known as an outspoken opponent of gay rights in the US. In 1977, she ran the “Save Our Children” campaign to repeal a local ordinance in Dade County, Florida which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Her involvement with the campaign was condemned by gay rights activists. They were assisted by many other prominent figures in music, film, and television, and retaliated by boycotting the orange juice which she had promoted. This, as well as her later divorce, damaged her financially…\n\nVictory and defeat\n\nOn June 7, 1977, Bryant’s campaign led to a repeal of the anti-discrimination ordinance by a margin of 69 to 31 percent. However, the success of Bryant’s campaign galvanised her opponents, and the gay community retaliated against her by organising a boycott of orange juice. Gay bars all over North America stopped serving screwdrivers and replaced them with the “Anita Bryant Cocktail”, which was made with vodka and apple juice. Sales and proceeds went to gay rights activists to help fund their fight against Bryant and her campaign.\n\nIn 1977, Florida legislators approved a measure prohibiting gay adoption.The ban was overturned more than 30 years later when, on November 25, 2008, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Cindy S. Lederman declared it unconstitutional.\n\nBryant led several more campaigns around the country to repeal local anti-discrimination ordinances, including campaigns in St. Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon. In 1978, her success led to the Briggs Initiative in California, which would have made pro-gay statements regarding homosexual people or homosexuality by any public school employee cause for dismissal. Grassroots liberal organisations, chiefly in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, organised to defeat the initiative. Days before the election, the California Democratic Party opposed the proposed legislation. President Jimmy Carter, governor Jerry Brown, former president Gerald Ford, and former governor Ronald Reagan – then planning a run for the presidency – all voiced opposition to the initiative, and it ultimately suffered a massive defeat at the polls.\n\nIn 1998, Dade County repudiated Bryant’s successful campaign of 20 years earlier and reauthorised an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting individuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by a seven-to-six vote. In 2002, a ballot initiative to repeal the 1998 law, called Amendment 14, was voted down by 56 percent of the voters. The Florida statute forbidding gay adoption was upheld in 2004 by a federal appellate court against a constitutional challenge but was overturned by a Miami-Dade circuit court in November 2008.\n\nBryant became one of the first persons to be publicly “pied” as a political act (in her case, on television), in Des Moines, Iowa, on October 14, 1977. Bryant quipped “At least it’s a fruit pie,” making a pun on the derogatory term of “fruit” for a gay man. While covered in pie, she began to pray to God to forgive the activist “for his deviant lifestyle” before bursting into tears as the cameras continued rolling. Bryant’s husband said that he would not retaliate, but followed the protesters outside and threw a pie at them. By this time, gay activists ensured that the boycott on Florida orange juice had become more prominent and it was supported by many celebrities, including Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Paul Williams, Dick Clark (Bryant had made several appearances on his shows, especially his namesake television show), Vincent Price (he joked in a television interview that Oscar Wilde’s A Woman of No Importance referred to her), John Waters, Carroll O’Connor, Linda Lavin, Mary Tyler Moore, Charles Schulz, Billie Jean King, and Jane Fonda. In 1978, Bryant and Bob Green told the story of their campaign in the book At Any Cost. The gay community continued to regard Bryant’s name as synonymous with bigotry and homophobia.\n\nExtract from “Anita Bryant,” on the Wikipedia website\n\nHank O’Neal (American, b. 1940) (photographer)\n\nAlan Ginsberg (American, 1926-1997) (writer)\n\nUntitled (I deserve a cute boy’s kiss) (Marsha P.

Johnson (August 24, 1945 – July 6, 1992) was an American gay liberation activist and self-identified drag queen. Known as an outspoken advocate for gay rights, Johnson was one of the prominent figures in the Stonewall uprising of 1969. A founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Johnson co-founded the gay and transvestite advocacy organisation S.T.A.R. (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), alongside close friend Sylvia Rivera. A popular figure in New York City’s gay and art scene, Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, and performed onstage with the drag performance troupe, Hot Peaches. Known for decades as a welcoming presence in the streets of Greenwich Village, Johnson was known as the “mayor of Christopher Street”. From 1987 through 1992, Johnson was an AIDS activist with ACT UP.\n\nPerformance work and identity\n\nJohnson initially called herself “Black Marsha” but later decided on “Marsha P. Johnson” as her drag queen name, getting Johnson from the restaurant Howard Johnson’s on 42nd Street. She said that the P stood for “pay it no mind” and used the phrase sarcastically when questioned about her gender, saying “it stands for pay it no mind”. She said the phrase once to a judge, who was humoured by it and released her. Johnson variably identified herself as gay, as a transvestite, and as a queen (referring to drag queen). According to Susan Stryker, a professor of human gender and sexuality studies at the University of Arizona, Johnson’s gender expression may be called gender non-conforming in absence of Johnson’s use of transgender, which was not used broadly during her lifetime.\n\nJohnson said her style of drag was not serious (or “high drag”) because she could not afford to purchase clothing from expensive stores. She received leftover flowers after sleeping under tables used for sorting flowers in the Flower District of Manhattan, and was known for placing flowers in her hair. Johnson was tall, slender and often dressed in flowing robes and shiny dresses, red plastic high heels, and bright wigs, which tended to draw attention.\n\nJohnson sang and performed as a member of J. Camicias’ international, NYC-based, drag performance troupe, Hot Peaches, from 1972 through to shows in the 1990s. When The Cockettes, a similar drag troupe from San Francisco, formed an East Coast troupe, The Angels of Light, Johnson was also asked to perform with them. In 1973, Johnson performed the role of “The Gypsy Queen” in the Angels’ production, “The Enchanted Miracle”, about the Comet Kohoutek. In 1975, Johnson was photographed by famed artist Andy Warhol, as part of a “Ladies and Gentlemen” series of Polaroids. In 1990, Johnson performed with The Hot Peaches in London. Now an AIDS activist, Johnson also appears in The Hot Peaches production The Heat in 1990, singing the song “Love” while wearing an ACT UP, “Silence = Death” button.\n\nStonewall uprising and other activism\n\nJohnson said she was one of the first drag queens to go to the Stonewall Inn, after they began allowing women and drag queens inside; it was previously a bar for only gay men. On the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall uprising occurred. While the first two nights of rioting were the most intense, the clashes with police would result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through the gay neighbourhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards.\n\nJohnson has been named, along with Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona, by a number of the Stonewall veterans interviewed by David Carter in his book, Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution, as being “three individuals known to have been in the vanguard” of the pushback against the police at the uprising. Johnson denied she had started the uprising, stating in 1987 that she had arrived at around “2:00 [that morning]”, and that “the riots had already started” when she arrived and that the Stonewall building “was on fire” after cops set it on fire. The riots reportedly started at around 1:20 that morning after Stormé DeLarverie fought back against the police officer who attempted to arrest her that night.\n\nCarter writes that Robin Souza had reported that fellow Stonewall veterans and gay activists such as Morty Manford and Marty Robinson had told Souza that on the first night, Johnson “threw a shot glass at a mirror in the torched bar screaming, ‘I got my civil rights'”. Souza told the Gay Activists Alliance shortly afterwards that it “was the shot glass that was heard around the world”. Carter, however, concluded that Robinson had given several different accounts of the night and in none of the accounts were Johnson’s name brought up, possibly in fear that if he publicly credited the uprising to Johnson due to her well-known mental state and gender nonconforming, then Stonewall, and indirectly the gay liberation movement, “could have been used effectively by the movement’s opponents”. The alleged “shot glass” incident has also been heavily disputed. Prior to Carter’s book, it was claimed Johnson had “thrown a brick” at a police officer, an account that was never verified. Johnson also claimed herself that she was not at the Stonewall Inn when the rioting broke out but instead had heard about it and went to get Sylvia Rivera who was at a park uptown sleeping on a bench to tell her about it. However, many have corroborated that on the second night, Johnson climbed up a lamppost and dropped a bag with a brick in it down on a cop car, shattering the windshield.\n\nFollowing the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the Gay Liberation Front and participated in the first Christopher Street Liberation Pride rally on the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion in June 1970. One of Johnson’s most notable direct actions occurred in August 1970 when she and fellow GLF members staged a sit-in protest at Weinstein Hall at New York University after administrators canceled a dance when they found out was sponsored by gay organisations. Shortly after that, she and close friend Sylvia Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organisation (initially titled Street Transvestites Actual Revolutionaries). The two of them became a visible presence at gay liberation marches and other radical political actions. In 1973, Johnson and Rivera were banned from participating in the gay pride parade by the gay and lesbian committee who were administering the event stating they “weren’t gonna allow drag queens” at their marches claiming they were “giving them a bad name”. Their response was to march defiantly ahead of the parade. During a gay rights rally at New York City Hall in the early ’70s, photographed by Diana Davies, a reporter asked Johnson why the group was demonstrating, Johnson shouted into the microphone, “Darling, I want my gay rights now!”\n\nDuring another incident around this time, which landed Johnson in court, she was confronted by police officers for hustling in New York, and when they went to apprehend her, she hit them with her handbag, which contained two bricks. When Johnson was asked by the judge why she was hustling, Johnson explained she was trying to secure enough money for her husband’s tombstone. During a time when same-sex marriage was illegal in the United States, the judge asked her what “happened to this alleged husband”, Johnson responded, “Pigs killed him”. Initially sentenced to 90 days in prison for the assault, Johnson’s lawyer eventually convinced the judge to send her to Bellevue instead.\n\nWith Rivera, Johnson established the STAR House, a shelter for gay and trans street kids in 1972, and paid the rent for it with money they made themselves as sex workers. While the House was not focused on performance, Marsha was a “drag mother” of STAR House, in the longstanding tradition of chosen family in the Black and Latino LGBT community. Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for the young drag queens, trans women, gender nonconformists and other gay street kids living on the Christopher Street docks or in their house on the Lower East Side of New York.\n\nIn the 1980s Johnson continued her street activism as a respected organiser and marshal with ACT UP. In 1992, when George Segal’s Stonewall memorial was moved to Christopher Street from Ohio to recognise the gay liberation movement, Johnson commented, “How many people have died for these two little statues to be put in the park to recognise gay people? How many years does it take for people to see that we’re all brothers and sisters and human beings in the human race? I mean how many years does it take for people to see that we’re all in this rat race together.\n\nExtract from “Marsha P.
