        "text": "Shines a light on a struggle that continues to this day, and does so in a gripping , inspiring fashion.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Aug 5, 2019\n\nIncludes frank recollections and startling clips from vintage news reports, including 'The Homosexuals,' a 1967 CBS special narrated by Dan Rather that characterized homosexuality as 'a mental illness that has reached epidemiological proportions.'\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Sep 10, 2010\n\nFor a movie about a groundbreaking gay rebellion, Stonewall Uprising plays it much too straight.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Aug 17, 2010\n\nExcellent source of information for those who know little of this monumental occurrence, but for those with no need for a Stonewall riots 101, it has little to offer.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Aug 13, 2010\n\nIt comes alive through the memories of those who were there.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 29, 2010\n\nMore than half of the documentary isn't about Stonewall at all, which makes for a frustrating 49-minute wait until the uprising begins to rise up.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jul 9, 2010\n\nOn the one hand, Stonewall Uprising shows how far we've come toward enlightenment and tolerance since that hot June night. On the other, it reminds us that there are still many minds to change and rights to win.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jul 8, 2010\n\nPplaces the incident within the context of the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960s with PBS-caliber tact and compassion.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 8, 2010\n\nStonewall Uprising is an important documentary -- and a passionate and compassionate reconstruction of the historic standoff between police and pubcrawlers.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jun 25, 2010\n\nMany witnesses offer emotional recollections of the ensuing riots, but equally powerful moments come courtesy of old footage, in which anti-gay \"experts\" expound with a confident ignorance that sounds chillingly familiar even today.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jun 20, 2010\n\nHeartfelt and engagingly filmed, but not nearly as insightful as it could have been with sharper, more provocative questions asked.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7.0/10 | Jun 18, 2010"
