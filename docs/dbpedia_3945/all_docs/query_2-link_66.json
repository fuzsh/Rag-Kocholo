        "text": "What a dramatic spectacle it was, as it unfolded! I am not referring to the Olympic opening ceremony, which was spectacular in parts, but also rather long and drawn out, full of slightly obscure allusions to French cultural ideas (was ours better in 2012? Yes, I think it was less obscure), and at times seemed rather sexualised and not good family viewing, which it was supposed to be.\n\nNor am I referring to those who were outraged at the short Bacchanalian scene which appeared to mock da Vinci’s painting of the Last Supper. No, the spectacular drama was those who were outraged at the idea that Christians should be outraged at anything in the media. As Fergus Butler-Gallie commented on Twitter:\n\nWhenever there’s a Christian controversy of some sort I always run a little book in my head in how long it takes the people who are performatively not bothered by it to become more annoying than the people who are performatively bothered by it. I make it about 36 hours.\n\nMichael Jensen offered a more robust critique on Facebook of those taking offence at those taking offence:\n\nI also note the gaslighting that has gone on towards those who’ve taken offence. How ignorant and unenlightened they must be. How touchy! How backwards! Don’t they know art history? If the shoe were on some other foot, we would immediately cave in and say ‘Yes, it wasn’t intended to be offensive but your offence is justified anyway’. We live in an era where subjectivity is everything. If you feel it, it must be true. Except in this one instance, apparently.\n\nThe most fascinating aspect of this in the Church of England was that (to my knowledge) the only bishop who objected to it in public was John Inge, bishop of Worcester, who quoted Gavin Calver of the Evangelical Alliance. Since John is a leading campaigner for the Church to change its doctrine of marriage, this was about the only thing they might agree on. But John then had to make a quick retraction—which probably needed another retraction!\n\nAll this goes to illustrate the complexity of addressing such things, as my social media feed was swamped with offence and counter-offence, a sign of the corrosive effect of living in a social media world on our thinking and conversation.\n\nWhere do we start to untangle all this? We need to start with the image of the Bacchanalian feast, with a blue figure of Bacchus and an array of people in drag. The apparent parallel with da Vinci’s Last Supper caused an immediate outcry from some. Others then went on to deride the ignorance of art history on their part, pointing out that this was actually a recreation of ‘The Feast of the Gods‘ painted in 1635 by the Dutch artist Jan van Bijlert, which is the property of the French Republic and hangs in a gallery in Dijon.\n\nBut when you look at ‘The Feast of the Gods’ it bears a striking resemblance to da Vinci’s work. (You can find a great exposition of the theological meaning of his painting here.) There has been a long tradition of displacing Christian images and ideas with pagan classical ones, with a Bacchanalian feast being the obvious substitute for the Last Supper and the Christian celebration of Communion (the Eucharist).\n\nThe debate then shifted to the intention and the awareness of those responsible for organising the ceremony. The phone app explaining the ceremony included this comment:\n\nAlso on the Passerelle Debilly is a familiar scene re-enacted by drag queens, including the famous Nicki Doll surrounding Barbara Butch at her turntables: a recreation of the Last Supper, another famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, set against the backdrop of the Seine. As you may have guessed, this is a multiple pun in French. A fashion show follows, paying homage to the capital of fashion.\n\nThe apology for offence caused from the organisers was less clear—and it wasn’t really an apology, but a regret that people had taken offence.\n\n“Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. [The opening ceremony] tried to celebrate community tolerance,” the Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps told a press conference. “We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offence we are really sorry.”\n\nThe Guardian article offered a helpful comment on the context in French culture:\n\nFrance has a rich Catholic heritage but also has a long tradition of secularism and anti-clericalism. Blasphemy is legal and considered by many to be an essential pillar of freedom of speech. Supporters of the tableau praised its message of inclusivity and tolerance.\n\nSo here is the first paradox of the whole event: the idea that you show ‘inclusivity and tolerance’ by mocking the views of others and respecting nothing as sacred. How does that work?\n\nThe second paradox is the fact that an event designed to have popular appeal actually depends on elitist understanding of the complexity of the images. Not only are the organisers expecting the viewers to know something about contemporary drag queens (‘the famous Nicki Doll’) but also 17th-century French and Dutch art history—as well, perhaps, as of Greek mythology. Zachary Arden asks the question:\n\nIncidentally, why pick this theme? In part perhaps for the somewhat pedestrian opportunity to have “la Cène” (the last supper) on “la scène” (the stage) on la Seine.\n\nVery clever, but also very elite. It is quite hard to accuse Paddington Bear having tea with the Queen as guilty of this kind of social or intellectual elitism! This kind of approach revels in the ‘in jokes’ and woe betide the commentator or critic who is ignorant of these things. It is almost as if the organisers set a trap for anyone offended, who by their offence is simply displaying their ignorance.\n\nBut the third paradox is around the notion of intention or awareness. Michael Jensen again:\n\nI think it is fascinating that one defence of the Olympics Opening Ceremony performance was the resort to ‘author’s intentions’. That is: the designer says he didn’t intend it as a reference to the Last Supper, so therefore, people shouldn’t be upset if they see an echo of the Last Supper there. How primitive and unlike every French literary critic I read at university! Surely we could at least acknowledge that cultural references can be subconscious. The Last Supper lurks deep in the consciousness of Western culture—it is no surprise that it bursts out even when the composer of the scene isn’t aware of it. For those saying ‘don’t you know art history?’ the question really ought to be put to the designer/director: don’t you know art history, that the tableaux you presented immediately would be taken as a reference to the Last Supper?\n\nLiterary criticism in the post-modern era has long argued that it is not the intention of the author that creates meaning, but the perception of the reader—first proposed in a 1967 article ‘The Death of the Author‘ by Roland Barthes. This idea has had a major impact on biblical studies, leading to a shift from attention to the context of the biblical texts and the possible meaning intended by the author, and even away from the text itself, to the ‘reader response’ of readers in different contexts. The difficulty here, as with the Olympics ceremony, is that different ‘readers’ will see different things—but of course responsibility for any of this conveniently shifts away from the author! Hence the apology was ‘that people took offence’ and not ‘that I caused offence’.\n\nIf you think this is all rather remote to contemporary life, just consider the definition of ‘hate crime’ now in the UK, which centres on whether an action ‘is perceived to be’ arising because of hatred of a particular group.\n\nThese paradoxes together are the product of the ideas of deconstruction and of ‘queering’ all of life, whether it be ideas or values or cultural icons. The real problem here is that to deconstruct something, you need something which others have previously built, and you need somewhere to stand from which to deconstruct it. If you build something in its place, then you must expect that the next person to come along will deconstruct that. It simply leads to more and more instability and self-contradiction.\n\nTwo fascinating responses highlight some of the issues here. The first is from an evangelical Christian living in France.\n\nYet, even within a France that wanted something to be proud of, the event has been widely criticised. I’ll mention the ‘anti-Christian’ element shortly but the whole venture was the epitome of postmodernism or possibly post-postmodernism. History and culture were ransacked to give episodes that were flashed up, given a sharp twist of deconstruction, only to be replaced by something else. Any overall theme was unclear and forcing viewers to make their own response to the mysteries before them. There was a consistent jokey, cynical and provocative tone and anything that could, within the law, be lampooned was.\n\nThe second is from David Watson, who is Academic Dean and Professor of New Testament at United Theological Seminary in Dayton.\n\nAs the Western world chokes on its own decadence, the drag-queen spectacle at the Paris Olympics was its fitting representation. The surprising thing would have been if nothing like this had happened, if we could have had some public spectacle without a celebration of the libertine sexual ethic that has come into full bloom in the early twenty-first century. Drag queens are, as the French say, au courant. The manner of their appearance made many particularly angry since it resembled a mockery of the Last Supper…\n\nForgive me, then, if I’m not reassured by the claim that what we saw at the Paris Olympics was only a representation of a pagan orgy.\n\nThat said, it really doesn’t have to be one or the other. In many ways, a bacchanal is the antithesis of the Eucharist. Both are celebrations at the table, though their meanings could not be more different. One is a celebration of pleasure, the other a representation of Christ’s suffering. One is about hedonism, the other about self-sacrifice. One is an adventure in lust and gluttony, the other the embodiment of self-giving love. One glorifies the flesh, one crucifies the flesh. One binds us to the enemy of our souls, the other to their creator and redeemer. Whether we witnessed an intentional mockery of the Last Supper or a bacchanal really doesn’t make much difference. The meaning is largely the same.\n\nGiven all this, should Christians have taken offence at this? Should we have vented outrage on social media and elsewhere? As others have done, Watson puts this nicely in historical context:\n\nContempt for Christianity, however, is nothing new. Early Christians were accused of all kinds of things, from atheism to incest to cannibalism. One especially sophomoric rebuke of Christians is a cartoon (technically a graffito) that was inscribed into plaster sometime around the early third century on the Palatine Hill in Rome. It depicts a man named Alexamenos worshiping a crucified figure with the head of an ass.\n\nPeople have always found Christianity distasteful. Do we expect that they will no longer do so? Just as in the early days of the faith, Christianity now finds little favor among the upper echelons of society, who prefer the bacchanal to the communion table. The foolishness of the crucified God, the odious renunciation of self, the repellent call not to be served but to serve, the submission of the flesh in union with Christ as a holy and living sacrifice—these are repugnant to those who consider themselves self-made and revel in the will to power.\n\nBut how should we respond to these kinds of offensive expressions of contempt?\n\nJimmy Carr has a wonderful short vignette in one of his stage sets, where he explains why he mocks Christians but does not mock Islam.\n\nI’m not going to be telling the same jokes about Muhammad as I tell about Jesus Christ—I’m not an idiot!So if you’re a Christian, and you’re sitting there thinking ‘That’s not fair! He makes jokes about Christians all day long, but he won’t make the same sorts of jokes about Muslims!’ then maybe, as a Christian, you should think about blowing something up! No-one’s scared of you! What are the Christians gonna do? Forgive me?!\n\nI confess when I watched that I felt rather proud. That is precisely what Christians should be known for, following the example of Jesus. Kenneth Cragg, the expert on Islam of a previous generation and Assistant Bishop of Jerusalem, in his The Call of the Minaret, highlighted the essential difference between Islam and Christianity: where Muhammad journeyed to Mecca with an army to conquer, Jesus journeyed to the cross to be conquered, to give his life for others.\n\nAnd so we stand in the long tradition that goes back to the Letter of Mathetes to Diognetius, written around 130:\n\nThey have their meals in common, but not their wives. They find themselves in the flesh, and yet they live not after the flesh. Their existence is on earth, but their citizenship is in heaven. They obey the established laws, and they surpass the laws in their own lives. They love all men, and they are persecuted by all. They are ignored, and yet they are condemned. They are put to death, and yet they are endued with life. They are in beggary, and yet they make many rich. They are in want of all things, and yet they abound in all things. They are dishonoured, and yet they are glorified in their dishonour. They are evil spoken of, and yet they are vindicated. They are reviled, and they bless; they are insulted, and they respect. Doing good they are punished as evil-doers; being punished they rejoice, as if they were thereby quickened by life.\n\nWe appear to suffer from two equal and opposite ills of the social media age—outrage and indifference. Neither of these are options for the Christian. We should not shake our social media fists in range—but neither should we shrug our shoulders are ask everyone to move on, or get a life.\n\nYes, we should be offended. Yes, we should be grieved—not just at the mockery of Jesus and his offer of himself to us, but also at the destruction and hedonism of our era. That grief need not be diminished by our concern at other issues as well; after all, it is the culture of consumption which is doing so much harm to the natural world as we exploit it for our gain.\n\nBut our response should be greater commitment to sharing the good news of Jesus—that a meal in his presence is worth more than all the consumption in the world, and it is in his service that we find perfect freedom."
