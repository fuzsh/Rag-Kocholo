The importance afforded to them in the Welsh higher education environment is clear from the emphasis in ‚Äòcohesion‚Äô and ‚Äòcollaboration‚Äô in the Welsh Government‚Äôs tertiary education and research strategic vision. For the past three years, the Learned Society of Wales has been developing is Early Career Researchers Network, which is part of our wider researcher development programme. The ECR Network emerged from a view that researchers in Wales at the start of their career would benefit from the opportunities to network with peers at a range of organisations that carry out research across Wales, including, but not exclusively, universities, irrespective of their subject specialism. The success of the ECR Network has perhaps exceeded our expectations and is now a recognised feature of the Wales HE environment. This success contributed to the recent long-term partnership agreement we signed with HEFCW, which recognised how the Network was helping to deliver key Welsh strategic targets. Tomorrow (18/06/24), the ECR Network will run its second colloquium, which brings together ECRs to present their work, participate in workshops and seminars and, of course, network. Around 100 people will attend the event, which takes place in Bangor and is titled ‚ÄòA Connected Wales‚Äô. This theme is two-pronged: the presentations and seminars all consider how Wales can draw its multiple strengths together to work in collaborative ways that benefit wider society. It also emphasises that connecting researchers across institutions and specialisms is critical to generating the imaginative solutions that we need in confronting 21st Century challenges. So what are the two key lessons we‚Äôve learnt in making the ECR Network grow to its current position of strength?

Our Dean Jasper Knoester presented the new strategic plan 'Connecting through Curiosity' üéâ The strategic plan was created thanks to the input of many people. ‚ÄòThe new strategy has a strong focus on the community we want to be,' Knoester says. 'It is about the way we want to work and study together, the way we want this big organisation to work and to develop.‚Äô The new strategic plan gives us guidelines for the coming years. ‚ÄòThe world around us is changing continuously and even if we like our traditions, we need to adjust to those changes. It helps to have a guide, a compass to help us make decisions on how we adjust. What do we want the faculty to be in this changing world, what role do we want to play in it? What type of organisation do we want to be for our staff and students, and how do we fit within the university? This is what we describe in our strategic plan.‚Äô Want to know more?

ChatGPT summary of the chapter: The development of research administration in North America spans from the 1940s to the present. In the 1940s, U.S. federal government support for scientific research marked the formal beginning, with organizations like the National Defense Research Council playing crucial roles. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed expanded federal funding and regulatory requirements, leading to the establishment of professional societies like the Society for Research Administrators and the National Council of University Research Administrators. The 1980s and 1990s brought significant regulatory growth, including the Bayh-Dole Act and the Research Administrators Certification Council. The early 2000s saw Canada's focus on knowledge transfer, while the U.S. emphasized team science and larger projects. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the increased demand for research administration. Ongoing efforts are crucial for ensuring equitable access, benefits, and formal education to meet evolving industry demands. It also introduces threads that are elucidated in other chapters, such as the profession in the US (chapter 5.5), in Canada (chapter 5.7), and the development of qualifications (chapter 2.7).

We'll delve into enhancing process efficiency, the pivotal role of early-stage funding, strategies for securing long-term investment, and maintaining the UK's status as a top destination for international competitiveness. I'll be sharing the panel with esteemed colleagues such as Professor Ashutosh Tiwari from the University of Sheffield and Thomas Frostick from The Royal Society. üìò This conference comes at a critical time as it follows the Government's acceptance of all recommendations from the November 2023 Independent Review of University Spin-Out Companies, including the launch of a ¬£20m fund to foster more spin-outs and efforts to streamline their creation process. We'll explore how these changes are shaping the landscape of academic research commercialisation, focusing on policy implementation, investment strategies, and best practices for fostering innovation. üìà Discussions will not only cover the operational aspects but also strategic implications for future government funding, investment climates, and the broader economic impact. This is a pivotal platform for policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders to collaborate towards a vibrant future for UK innovation. üîó Join us as we discuss these vital topics and more. If you're interested in the future of university research commercialisation, innovation ecosystems, and policy development, this is an event you won‚Äôt want to miss. Let's connect if you're attending or want to learn more about these developments!

On 23-24 April 2024, thought leaders from higher education, industry and wider civil society will convene to discuss how universities and other higher education institutions play a pivotal role in progressing societies across Europe and beyond through partnerships. We have a jam-packed agenda full of unmissable sessions including our THE data masterclass: European performance in the THE Impact Rankings The THE Impact Rankings are the first and only global performance tables that assess universities against the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals. üåçThe 2023 edition is the largest to date with more than 1,500 institutions participating worldwide. With tables for each of the 17 SDGs, the rankings provide an opportunity to highlight the great work universities are doing for society at all levels. Join Elsevier's Tomasz Asmussen and THE's David Watkins as they reveal how the rankings provide: üìàInsights in research, stewardship, outreach and teaching üìàDemonstrations of commitment to sustainability üìàEvidence of institutions‚Äô achievements on campus, in the local environment and further afield View our full agenda and book your tickets here: https://lnkd.in/eBrCezGp #THEeurope #timeshighereducation #constructoruniversity #europeeducation #highereducation #partnerships #data #datamasterclass #sustainability #sgds #THEglobalimpact\n\nHow Do We Navigate all the Possibilities and Paradoxes in Digital Transformation? This week, I had the privilege of presenting my PhD research design addressing this question at the Possibility Studies Conference at the University of Cambridge. It was such a great experience. Huge thanks to the Possibility Studies Network for making me feel so welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è The research project is initiated by Aarhus Municipality to complement existing knowledge on digital transformation in the public sector, with a special emphasis on how to navigate the many possibilities ‚Äì and of course, the inherent paradoxes. A study of the possible is a study of the future, and this requires creative methods and interventions, and state-of-the-art technology. This is made possible through a strong collaboration with highly skilled and dedicated researchers at Aarhus University, Aalborg University, and Dublin University. Personally, I am so motivated to gain new insights on this question ‚Äì and ultimately to discover new, even more relevant questions ‚Äì and I will gladly share the learnings with anyone interested. If you‚Äôre curious about the framing, you can see my conference abstract here: https://lnkd.in/dvCjmBtf ‚Ä¶ or just get in touch with me. I will end with Possibility Studies assertion #1: the possible is distributed [read: there is no way I could ever do this alone] Thanks to my academic advisors for making this cutting-edge design possible üöÄ and for embracing the complexities of the real world ‚Äì it's quite a messy struggle trying to fit it into an academic model ü•¥ Michael Mose Biskjaer, Anders Koed Madsen, and Vlad Glaveanu And thanks to my wise colleagues at Aarhus Municipality for helping me frame this (and reframe it over and over again), and to my organizational advisors for insisting on creative and unconventional methods that don't necessarily fit into our organizational standards ‚Äì to create insights and learning that don't necessarily fit into our preconceptions ü§ü Martin √òstergaard Christensen, Lone Juric Soerensen, and Marie R√∏rdam Fenger"
