        "text": "University in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n\nNorthumbria University (legally the University of Northumbria at Newcastle) is a public research university located in Newcastle upon Tyne, North East of England. It has been a university since 1992, but has its origins in the Rutherford College, founded in 1877.[4]\n\nNorthumbria University is primarily based within City Campus located in Newcastle upon Tyne city centre and at Coach Lane campus on the outskirts of the city centre, London and Amsterdam. It is organised into four faculties—Arts, Design and Social Sciences; Business and Law; Engineering and Environment, and Health and Life Sciences. Northumbria University has approximately 38,300 students.[5]\n\nAccording to the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, Northumbria University was rated 23rd in the UK for research power (the grade point average score of a university, multiplied by the full-time equivalent number of researchers submitted).[6] This determines how much funding is awarded to universities to spend on research activity and represented the largest percentage-point rise in market share since the previous exercise.[7] The annual income of the institution for 2022–23 was £338.3 million of which £16.4 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £340.2 million.[2]\n\nNorthumbria is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, Universities UK and the Wallace Group.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthumbria University has its origins in three Newcastle colleges: Rutherford College of Technology, which was established by John Hunter Rutherford in 1877 and opened formally in 1894 by the Duke of York (later King George V), the College of Art & Industrial Design and the Municipal College of Commerce. In 1969, the three colleges were amalgamated to form Newcastle Polytechnic. The Polytechnic became the major regional centre for the training of teachers with the incorporation of the City College of Education in 1974 and the Northern Counties College of Education in 1976.[8]\n\nIn 1992, Newcastle Polytechnic was reconstituted as the new University of Northumbria,[9] as part of a nationwide process in which polytechnics became new universities. It was originally styled, and its official name still is, the University of Northumbria at Newcastle (see the Articles of Government[10]) but the trading name was simplified to Northumbria University in 2002. In 1995, it was awarded responsibility for the education of healthcare professionals, which was transferred from the National Health Service.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2017, the university was fined £400,000 after a sports science experiment gave volunteers a hundred times the safe dose of caffeine. Two student volunteers were given a dose of 30g instead of 0.3g, because staff conducting the experiment tried to calculate the dose on a mobile phone calculator and misread the decimal point. Both were hospitalised and one reported loss of short-term memory.[11][12] A court hearing heard that the university had not trained staff in safety and had not carried out a proper risk assessment, and that the dose was above the level known to cause risk of death.[13]\n\nNorthumbria was named the UK University of the Year 2022 by Times Higher Education. The award was given in recognition of Northumbria's transformation over more than a decade into a research-intensive modern institution. The judging panel stated \"The scale of [Northumbria's] ambition, the rigour and effectiveness with which it has been pursued and its role in transforming lives and supporting its region all make it a deserving winner.\"[14]\n\nCampuses\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university has two large campuses situated in Newcastle and one in London. City Campus, located in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, is divided into City Campus East and City Campus West by the city's central motorway and linked by a £4 million bridge which in 2008 was officially opened by the former Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Lord Digby Jones.[15]\n\nCity Campus\n\n[edit]\n\nCity Campus East is home to the Schools of Law, Design and the Newcastle Business School (NBS). NBS and Law are housed in one building, and the School of Design is across a courtyard.[citation needed]\n\nCity Campus East, designed by Atkins, opened in September 2007, winning awards from The Journal newspaper and the Low Carbon New Build Project of the Year accolade.\n\nCity Campus West is home to the Schools of Arts & Social Sciences, Built & Natural Environment, Computing, Engineering & Information Sciences and Life Sciences. Also located on this campus is the University Library, Students' Union building and Sport Central, a £31m sports facility for students, staff and the community which opened in 2010.[8]\n\nThe Sutherland Building, formerly the Medical School of Durham University,[16] which was a naval warehouse during World War II, and the Dental School of Newcastle University[citation needed] (1945–78) is the home of is the home of the University Executive team and new world-class studios for Architecture students, designed by Page\\Park architects, which opened in 2019.[17]\n\nAdministrative Departments including Finance & Planning and Human Resources, are based in Pandon Building.\n\nThe Students' Union building, at City Campus West, underwent a multimillion-pound makeover with new lobby and recreational facilities, and a refurbished bar and cafe space, in summer 2010.[citation needed]\n\nIn September 2016 the Sandyford Building was acquired from Newcastle College.[18]\n\nIn 2018 a £7m building for Computer and Information sciences was opened in City Campus West[19] in place of the demolished Rutherford Hall.[20]\n\nCoach Lane\n\n[edit]\n\nA second campus[21] is located 2.6 miles (4 km) outside Newcastle, on Coach Lane, and is known as the Coach Lane Campus[22] at Cochrane Park near the A188 (Benton Road).

Coach Lane Campus has computing and library services; and sports facilities, including indoor courts, a fitness suite, outdoor rugby and football pitches, and an all-weather floodlit pitch.[citation needed]\n\nLondon Campus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe London Campus[23] offers full-time or part-time programmes, from a range of Business, Computing, Cyber, Project Management and Technology focused programmes to approximately 2,500 students. The campus is delivered in partnership with QA Higher Education, part of QA, the UK's largest corporate training provider. The campus is near Liverpool Street station, close to the heart of London's financial district.[citation needed]\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthumbria University has an international campus based in Amsterdam,[24] Netherlands through a partnership with Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences where it offers accredited postgraduate qualifications and the opportunity for undergraduates to experience overseas studies.[25]\n\nOrganisation and structure\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthumbria offers programmes in the disciplines of law and business, arts and design, engineering, mathematics, physics computing, geography and environmental sciences, architecture and built environment, applied sciences and healthcare, sports science, humanities and social sciences, psychology, nursing, social work and teacher education.[citation needed]\n\nNorthumbria University employs more than 3,100 people and offers undergraduate, postgraduate, CPD and degree apprenticeship programmes through four Faculties:\n\nFaculty of Arts, Design and Social Sciences\n\nFaculty of Business and Law\n\nFaculty of Engineering and Environment\n\nFaculty of Health and Life Sciences\n\nNewcastle Business School\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Newcastle Business School\n\nIn September 2007, Northumbria University opened its new Newcastle Business School building on the site of the former Warner Brothers cinema as part of a £136m city campus east development.[26] Newcastle Business School is the only university in the UK to hold double AACSB accreditation for business and accounting which makes them form part of an elite group of 190 institutions worldwide to hold this.[27][28] As of 2020, The university also holds accreditation for EPAS in 21 different undergraduate programmes, more than any other university in the UK. Newcastle Business School has also developed relations with a wide range of other professional bodies.[28] As a result, the university can offer a wide range of professional exemptions in its programmes such as the Accountancy degree which holds exemptions from many of the top accountancy boards including ICAEW, ACCA, and CIMA.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2015, Newcastle Business School was the winner of ‘UK Business School of the Year’ at the Times Higher Education Awards.[29]\n\nNorthumbria Law School\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthumbria Law School[30] is located within City Campus East where it shares its building with Newcastle Business School.\n\nNorthumbria Law School is the largest law school within the north-east of England.

Northumbria has a joint medical programme through a partnership with St George's University of Grenada.[31] As part of the programme the teaching hours are split between time spent within the Grenada and the United Kingdom. The programme has been expanded in recent years with an increased amount of time that students can spend within the United Kingdom.[citation needed]\n\nAcademic profile\n\n[edit]\n\nRankingsNational rankingsComplete (2025)[32]34Guardian (2024)[33]38Times / Sunday Times (2024)[34]49Global rankingsARWU (2023)[35]801–900QS (2025)[36]535=THE (2024)[37]501–600\n\nResearch\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthumbria was one of the best performing universities in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, rising the highest number of places in a ranking of 'research power' by THE.

The arched line of battlements dividing the shield refers to the Roman Wall, a historic feature of Northumberland. Whilst the curve of the arch reflects the King George the Fifth Bridge over the River Tyne, more generally the bridge alludes to the university's role in the transmission of knowledge to, and strong links, with the society in which its located.'[76] The crest is a lion grasping a flaming torch which is an emblem of learning, also a trident as the emblem of the old god of the River Tyne. The supporters are seahorses referencing the arms of Newcastle upon Tyne but with the addition of crowns around their necks, alluding to the Roman Wall and holding tridents of the River Tyne.[citation needed]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nArmorial of British universities\n\nBullocksteads Sports Ground\n\nJISC infoNet\n\nKingston Park (stadium)\n\nList of universities in the United Kingdom\n\nPost-1992 universities\n\nRankings of universities in the United Kingdom\n\nSport Central\n\nUniversities in the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen, Joan; Buswell, Richard (2005).
