        "text": "The Vikings in Northumbria - MST00069M\n\n« Back to module search\n\nDepartment: Centre for Medieval Studies\n\nCredit value: 20 credits\n\nCredit level: M\n\nAcademic year of delivery: 2024-25\n\nSee module specification for other years: 2022-23 2023-24\n\nModule summary\n\nIn 793 Viking raiders attacked the coastal monastery of Lindisfarne. In 866 the Viking ‘great army’ attacked the city of York and conquered the kingdom of Northumbria. After that, as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records, ‘they shared out the land of the Northumbrians and they proceeded to plough and to support themselves’. Scandinavian kings ruled in York until 954, and even after that time, right up until 1066 and beyond, the area they had ruled over (roughly equivalent to the modern county of Yorkshire) showed strong signs of Scandinavian culture and political separatism. This team-taught module will explore, from an interdisciplinary perspective, the history and culture of the Vikings in Northumbria\n\nModule will run\n\nOccurrence Teaching period A Semester 1 2024-25\n\nModule aims\n\nUsing a variety of sources and approaches (archaeological, artistic, textual, and linguistic), the module will examine questions of migration, settlement, religion, politics, economy, culture, and identity.
