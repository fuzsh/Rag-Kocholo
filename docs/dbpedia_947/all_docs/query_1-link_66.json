        "text": "By James, Matthew, Aleah and Tom\n\nThe Society had many uses, but the main ones were its library and lecture halls. The library served as a place for the accumulation of books and documents on a wide range of topics, including James Losh’s Weather Diaries which recorded the differences in weather of Newcastle between 1802 -1833.[1] These volumes show that the Society’s library was used to preserve and protect rare, and potentially fragile, documents. Additionally, the library was open to anyone who wished to go inside who wanted to learn, which was one of the Society’s earliest plans, to help the people of Newcastle help themselves better their chances of success.[2] As well as the library, the Society held many lectures that discussed things like science and exploration, which, in terms of the former, could include the support or opposition to an existing scientific theory, but it could also be the presentation of a brand-new theory. [3] For example, ‘Dr. Throborn […] read several papers on the chemical action of light,’ to an audience at the society.[4] The Society also provided, on rare occasions, entertainment, like in the season 1877-1878, a Mrs MacFarren played only two recitals of the piano.[5] In terms of how it was seen and understood, it was largely the same as how it was used. It was a place of knowledge and learning, where people could discuss and present their work to a knowledgeable and interested audience, and to read and learn what subjects they wished, if they were able to.\n\nNewcastle’s Literary and Philosophical society was a place originally designed for people to discuss ‘learned studies’ often taking the form of lectures.[6] It soon blossomed into a centre of technological advancement and literary works: ‘a focal point of the industrial revolution’.[7] Societies of all kinds started to appear in the 18th century and Literary and Philosophical societies were established in London first followed by Manchester in 1781 then Newcastle in 1793.[8] They were known for a variety of reasons, but perhaps most significant were the scientific innovations aimed at improving or changing industrial methods. Newcastle was chosen specifically for several reasons, which Dr William Turner explained in his speech at the first meeting. The main reason the society was created concerned the coal-and lead- industries as ‘Newcastle enjoys special advantages fore3e chemical investigations’.[9] In other words, Newcastle had the natural resources as well as the industry and the experience of those who work in it in order to develop new technology. ’The Romantic scenery’ in Newcastle was considered as a factor for creating the society so to inspire works of art.[10] The Tyne river was to be the subject of many famous paintings including J.M.W. Turner. Scholarly work of the time included a lot of collecting and cataloguing of all things to do with nature and the past therefore, ‘the profusion of antiquities, not only in Newcastle, but all along the roman wall’ was another important reason for placing the society in Newcastle.[11]\n\nThe Literary and Philosophical society in Newcastle can be studied thematically and there is a wide theme of gender within the history of the society. While the society begun a gentlemen’s club, it officially admitted women in 1804, this was a progressive move as women in this period were vastly limited in their opportunities.[12] Further steps for equality can be seen through the admission fees into the society: normal members were required to pay an annual fee of one guinea, and non-members had to pay two guineas, while women were admitted at half of the cost.[13] Perhaps this encouraged women to join the society as a lower cost would allow them to join more easily, though this still would have been limited to middle-upper class women that were financially independent. Alongside the theme of gender is the theme of class, the society was exclusive to those with an education, meaning it was exclusive to the upper classes (particularly men). Derek Orange describes it as ‘the effective direction of the LPS remained, as it had begun, in the hands of the professional classes and the local gentry’.[14] Despite the class division, the most prominent question surrounding gender in relation to the society is whether women were truly involved in the society, and the answer is evident. Although women had the opportunity to engage in debates, in books and journals there is mere mention of female significance within the society, nor was there any female presidents until 2013, which largely contrasts the idea of the society being progressive and representative of women.[15]\n\nToday, the primary function of the Newcastle Lit and Phil Society is its use as a library. According to the Society, it is an “exquisite secret library, open to all and free to explore and browse.” And it is a centre for “learning and enlightenment”.[16] This perfectly reflects current trends in contemporary society in the drive for inclusiveness. The library by opening itself to all people of all backgrounds, regardless of race, gender, or class, allows everyone to go along and explore the library of the Society. And a library of 200,000 books await those who visit.[17] 200,000 books spanning fiction to non-fiction. Business practice to the history of Vikings to murder-mystery and romance novels. The enormous collection of books contains books dating from the 1500s to books published as recently as last year. To appeal as a place of learning to all, the library is not limited to written material for older visitors. The Society, for more nearly more than 100 years, has amassed sizeable children’s library making it great for families, especially families with young children. The Newcastle Lit and Phil Society, as well as its enormous library of 200,000 books, possesses roughly 10,000 LP records and 8,000 CDs — currently making it the largest music library in the North of England.[18] In addition to the vast book and music libraries, the Newcastle Lit and Phil Society hosts a variety of frequent events that display the sheer intellectual diversity of the Society. This includes events from musical events, the West Newcastle Orchestra; to STEM subjects on the role of women in future engineering; on history of Newcastle, art and the world, and niche events, such as Haunted Tours of the Society itself.[19]\n\nBibliography\n\nArmstrong, William G.
