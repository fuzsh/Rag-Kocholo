        "text": "For decades, high-calibre students from every part of the globe have travelled to our university for undergraduate, postgraduate (including MBA) and research degrees – with start dates in both September and January.\n\nWe passionately believe that university can transform lives. No matter what their nationality, we welcome overseas students into our supportive learning community that is about creating and applying knowledge for the benefit of all.\n\nWe often find that potential students already understand the benefits of studying at a British university. So if you’ve decided on the UK, why not choose the country’s ‘Best Student City’ – as named by the WhatUni Student Choice Award in 2014.\n\nWith one in six people in Newcastle upon Tyne being a student, there’s a huge range of clubs, social activities and sports to help you enjoy every minute. What’s more, the area around the city is known for beautiful countryside, fabulous beaches, a rich history and a very efficient public transport system. Northumbria University also has a campus in London for students who prefer to study in the UK capital.\n\nNorthumbria is top ten in the UK for the number of graduates entering professional employment and nine out of ten of our graduates are working or studying six months after graduation. We are ranked 21st out of 111 universities in the 2014 Times Higher Education Student Satisfaction Survey.\n\nNorthumbria works with major employers, including Nike, IBM, Nissan, Proctor & Gamble, the BBC, and the NHS, while more than 560 employers and 60 professional bodies sponsor or accredit the University’s programmes. Innovative and entrepreneurial, we are also ranked fourth in the UK for graduate business start-ups.\n\nWe have a campus in London as well as Newcastle, and work in partnership with other higher education institutions across the world attracting students from 136 countries\n\nYou can contact us about studying at Northumbria University via Facebook, scheduled online chat sessions, email, phone or face-to-face meetings."
