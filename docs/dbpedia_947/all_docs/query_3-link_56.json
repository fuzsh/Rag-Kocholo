Since then he has taught English literature of all kinds, but mainly Old and Middle English, to undergraduates and MA students, as well as supervising a small posse of PhD students.\n\nEarly medieval research interests\n\nThese follow works which he teaches, keeping in mostly with Editions. In his book on English heathen gods (1997) North argued for the existence of Ingui, divine focus of a massive fertility cult permeating Anglian Britain from the fifth century to the late seventh.\n\nLater he tried to prove that the Icelandic chieftain Sighvatr Sturluson, older brother of the more famous Snorri, wrote the first draft of Víga-Glúms saga in c. 1225.\n\nLater still, his book on Beowulf (2006) made a case not only for the poem’s date of composition in 826-27, but also for a place, Breedon-on-the-Hill (NW Leics.), as well as an author in Eanmund, abbot of Breedon in 816 - c. 848. This book has a simple premise, that the resemblance between Beowulf and his sidekick Wiglaf on one hand and the Mercian kings Beornwulf (823-26) and Wiglaf (827-39) on the other is not a coincidence. By chance, however, many scholars took exception to this book.\n\nWith Joe Allard (and Patricia Gillies) of the University of Essex, North edited and translated most of the Old English and Old Icelandic poetry and prose in the Longman Anthology of Old English, Old Icelandic and Anglo-Norman Literatures (2011): a reader to go with the much-loved ‘Beowulf’ & Other Stories which came out in 2007 (and again, in 2011).\n\nThe offerings in his vast Anthology include many sections from Beowulf and Andreas as well as the whole of Genesis B; The Dream of the Rood, The Wanderer, The Seafarer, Vainglory, some Old English Riddles, among other poems and prose; some poems in Old Welsh, Gaelic, Old High German and Castilian; some more in Occitan from the south of France as well as an extract from the Chanson de Roland; and from the Viking side, extracts from the Sagas of Icelanders, the great Sonatorrek ‘hard loss of sons’ of Egill Skalla-Grímsson (c. 960), the Vellekla ‘gold-shortage’ of Einarr skálaglamm ‘cup-tinkle’ Helgason and the Þórsdrápa ‘eulogy on Þórr’ of Eilílfr Goðrúnarson (c. 985).\n\nNorth had already made separate editions and translations of the Haustlǫng ‘harvest-long’ of Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900) and the Húsdrápa ‘eulogy on the house’ of Úlfr Uggason (c. 995). He contends that Skaldic verse should be read not as the periodic table or glyphs on a Mayan stele, but as a kind of machote poetry like the lyrics of Rap.\n\nMore recently, he has collaborated with Martin Worthington in a comparative study of Beowulf and Gilgamesh. With Mike Bintley he has published an edition, with parallel text and translation, of the Old English Andreas (a verse epic on St Andrew in the land of the cannibals).\n\nHe sees a Cervantesque mockery of Beowulf within this poem, which he dates to c. 890; and he has also written on the Ynglingatal ‘list of the sons of Ingvi-freyr’ of Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, a parody, also datable to c. 890, of the old kings of Uppsala and their descendants living around Oslo.\n\nLater medieval research interests\n\nAt the moment North is trying to prove the influence of Beowulf on The Saga of Grettir the Strong, to translate Loki: Beweger der Geschichten by Yvonne Bonnetain (Rudolstadt: Roter Drache, 2013), and to help create a new app of The Canterbury Tales (1390s). The last project, undertaken in concert with (i.a.) Terry Jones and Prof Peter Robinson of the University of Saskatchewan, promises to fill the rest of his life, but so far an app has been produced for The General Prologue in Fragment I: http://www.sd-editions.com/CantApp/GP/ .\n\nPara-academic activity\n\nFor two years North acted as President of the London-based Viking Society for Northern Research, for which he has since been working as Hon. Assistant Secretary. For two more years North was Director of the UCL MARS Centre (i.e. Medieval and Renaissance Studies). In 2015 North and Vicky Symons helped advise on the content for software design in the project Playing Beowulf, a Digital Transformations project funded by the AHRC (https://medium.com/ucl-antenna/are-you-man-or-monster-d64d1dabe643#.adt1f2xhm). In July 2016 North and Erin Goeres of SELCS got a major AHRC award to stage ’The Siege of London 1016’, a conference in commemoration of Kings Æthelred II and Cnut the Great, in UCL and the University of Winchester.\n\nPresently North is adviser on Medieval literature and history to his team (the Brockley Badgers) in the local pub quiz. What other impact his scholarship has made on the outside world, if not lost in the ephemera of BBC radio and independent TV (and lately German TV!), may be found in the short history of his stand-up appearances in UCL Bright Club. He has informed on paganism for the Vocabulary of the Study of Religions, lectured on the solar alignments of the old royal site in Yeavering, Northumberland, and written on Angelina Jolie for Time Out.\n\nPublications\n\nBooks\n\n1.
