        "text": "It has been almost a year since my last post, a year dedicated to another project I will hopefully blog about soon (“Medieval Worlds: Muddling through the Middle Ages”). Aldred feels neglected, perhaps, but is not far from my thoughts even if those are not committed to writing in his fictional story.\n\nIn the meantime, here I sit in Leeds waiting for the start of the International Medieval Congress, emulating Johnathan Jarrett’s A Corner of Tenth Century Europe by posting something from way back that has never seen the light of day but to which I keep returning to pull ideas.\n\nThis piece comes from 2011, so more than a decade ago, and shows my nascent thoughts about bringing into conversation my early medieval research on Britain with my location in Oceania. I gave it or parts of it as oral presentations and submitted versions to journals, but the peer reviews rightly pointed out areas that needed work, after which it languished on a back shelf while I moved on to other endeavors.\n\nNonetheless, I find myself invoking bits of it in my current work, including the panel presentation for IONA here at Leeds on Tuesday. Its presence here, warts and all, may serve as a backstop in case anyone wants to know more about the main characters.\n\nBefore you read on, please note three caveats about this mostly unrevised and lightly edited paper:\n\nThis was researched and written in 2010-11 and has not been updated with more recent work on the subjects, including my own work on Aldred and new approaches to studying early medieval Britain. As a consequence, I am omitting from the essay the now well out of date historiographic overview, and have added a few but not all more current references in footnotes with “see now.”\n\nThe journal peer reviewers made some cogent observations that have not been addressed (thank you to the readers and my apologies for not following through). This includes the overblown rhetoric about the medieval-modern divide, about which I have written elsewhere on this blog, and the uncomfortable switching between the two protagonists.\n\nI am a settler scholar in Hawai‘i but not a researcher in Pacific Islands studies. Rather, I am a Euromedievalist turned global medievalist, with an ear listening to Indigenous voices in Hawai‘i and in the field of early medieval English studies.\n\nFinally, I should note that my blog title with the question mark echoes the review essay by Neil Price and John Ljungkvist,“Polynesians of the Atlantic? Precedents, potentials, and pitfalls in Oceanic analogies of the Vikings,” Danish Journal of Archaeology (30 July 2018), which offers a more current and insightful critique of the problems of comparative histories.\n\nVikings of the Pacific: An Oceanic View of the Early Medieval British Isles\n\nMay the letter, faithful servant of speech, reveal me.\n\nSalute all my brothers with your kindly voice.[i]\n\nSometime in the middle of the tenth century, a Northumbrian priest named Aldred penned these lines as part of an extended, and quite self-revealing, colophon he wrote in the Lindisfarne Gospels manuscript, a treasured relic at the community of St. Cuthbert at Chester-le-Street, slightly north of present day Durham in Northumbria. Aldred had just finished glossing in Old English the Latin text of the four gospels and now with a considerable flourish, he memorialized his handiwork by adding himself to the list of illustrious original designers of this eighth-century gloriously decorated manuscript. His enhancement—bringing the Northumbrian dialect of Old English into dialogue with the Christian language of Latin—places him as a translator and mediator between local and global. Accordingly, the colophon is also bilingual, alternating between Latin and Old English in a way that reveals Aldred’s cultural hybridity as well as unique view of Viking-era English Christianity.\n\nThe old net is laid aside;\n\nA new net goes afishing.\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century, a Maori-Irish doctor from New Zealand closed his masterful account of Polynesian societies, Vikings of the Pacific, with an epilogue quoting this Maori proverb and offering a poignant query: “The old net is full of holes, its meshes have rotted, and it has been laid aside. What new net goes afishing?”[ii] For Te Rangi Hiroa, Sir Peter Buck, “the glory of the Stone Age has departed out of Polynesia,” its “regalia and symbols of spiritual and temporal power…scattered among the museums of other people,” including the one where he served as director, Bishop Museum in Honolulu. Hiroa/Buck was uniquely positioned by his dual heritages and education to bring into dialogue old and new worlds in collision.\n\nBoth Aldred the priest and Te Rangi Hiroa speak in quite personal terms about the academic work they performed. Each stands at a temporal, geographic, and cultural nexus, but seemingly unrelated to one another except through the accident of a title, Vikings of the Pacific, that attracted the attention of a contemporary historian of [early medieval Britain] working in Honolulu. It is highly unlikely that anyone other than the author of this essay would have connected these two historical figures or would make this comparison. The voice adopted in this essay is therefore autoethnographic: the juxtaposition of two unrelated historical figures is made possible by exposing the traditionally invisible position of the historian as outsider and mediator, who joins them as the third point in a triangular interpersonal and atemporal relationship.[iii] Consequently, this article offers a unique mediation between disparate worlds—medieval and modern, pre-and post-contact, English and Polynesian—and of necessity begins with an explanation of this conjunction and ends with its potential meaning for the role of the historian.\n\nAs a medieval European historian in the middle of the Pacific, my research is often seen as arcane both here and in England, where I am often asked, “why would someone in Hawai‘i be studying Anglo-Saxon society?” My answer, depending on the interlocutor, is sometimes “as an anthropologist, studying the natives,” turning the tables as it were. And yet there is a deeper issue imbedded in the question and my answer: in Hawai‘i, I have learned new ways of seeing medieval Europe through the lens of world history and comparisons to Pacific historiographies. Deliberately making this comparison between pre-modern England and the contemporary Pacific calls into question the way that Oceanic cultures have been “medievalized” by a colonizing modernity that created this temporal landscape of historical evolution. Reversing perspectives to give a Pacific view of the British Isles in the early Middle Ages is one way of undoing this process, in contrast to the more usual vice-versa of European history as the measure of civilizational “progress.”\n\nNonetheless, the comparison remains dangerous in the sense that it suggests, given the lingering nature of the modern narrative of progress, that Pacific cultures were in some cases “pre-historic” or in other ways “medieval,” with all of the baggage those labels imply.[iv] For example, the human history of Hawai‘i includes some generic similarities to the early medieval British Isles, including waves of migration, local territories defined by diverse ecosystems (valley cultures running from the wooded highlands down to the sea known as ahupua‘a), a long period of separate island governance, and eventual unification of the islands under one dominant military leader, Kamehameha the Great, all prior to the cataclysmic events of modernity—catastrophic depopulation and cultural genocide—precipitated by European and American colonial ventures, up to and including the imposition of this historical narrative of progress toward unification and centralization.[v] Such colonial narratives of the Pacific often rely on a limited number of historical voices in what M. Puakea Nogelmeir has labeled “a discourse of sufficiency” that ignores Hawaiian language sources.[vi] Resistance to, as well as negotiation with, that western colonial narrative is widespread in the Pacific. For example, Linda Tuhiwai Smith in pointing out how “research” has been a western colonizing project calls into question aspects of western historiography, such as the tendency toward temporal binaries and the colonial trap of modernity.[vii] These and other postcolonial voices from the Pacific supply grounds for querying the colonial-era medievalization of earlier European history.\n\nThus the broader aim of this essay is to highlight the instability of the term medieval in relation to its analogue, modern, but from a Pacific Islands view. This Oceanic perspective not only can help reimagine the medievalized European past but also offer a new way of doing history free of some of the invisible constraints imposed by modernity. [….] From its European intellectual inception, modernity of necessity imagined a medieval past reduced to a static condition of “not modern” that can occur subsequently in any time or place. By its very name, post-modernism has not escaped this paradigm; its deconstruction of modernity as progress neither marks a return to the medieval nor offers a way to reconceptualize these temporal divides. Carol Symes in her essay surveyed the problematic medieval and asks a question echoing Te Rangi Hiroa’s what new net goes afishing: “What new historical paradigms could we develop?”[viii] This essay offers some possible answers by triangulating between the historian, her object of study in tenth-century Northumbria, and a Pacific sense of place found in her academic home. In particular, this essay challenges modern assumptions about secularity in the academy by analyzing the hybrid voices of cultural translators, Aldred, Hiroa/Buck, and the author as historian.\n\nThe first part of this essay, “Post Mortem on Modernity,” exposes this problematic historiographical landscape in order to pursue a geographic and temporal reorientation, but is here edited out except for the conclusion. The second section, somewhat redacted, examines a medieval case study, the Northumbrian world of the Venerable Bede’s tenth-century heirs at the community of St. Cuthbert, specifically Aldred’s expression of an Englishness marginalized by the Viking disruptions and the rise of West Saxon linguistic and political hegemony. Pacific historians’ negotiations between pre- and post-contact eras offer other ways of telling the story of this cultural disruption and continuity across cultural divides. The third section then analyzes ways of doing history from a transoceanic perspective through the eyes of Maori-Irish ethnographer Te Rangi Hiroa (Sir Peter Buck), and his articulation of Polynesian identity in Vikings of the Pacific. The conclusion returns to the autoethnographic in search of historiographic implications.\n\nPost Mortem on Modernity\n\n[…]\n\nThe combined colonial legacy of secularism and ethnic nationalism leaves us with a lingering historiographical bias toward political centralization and expansion, such that we remain insensitive to other, more diffuse and shifting notions of power and hybrid identities. Traditional accounts of Anglo-Saxon England, assuming this vision of progress moving toward singularity and unity, usually trace the seemingly inevitable rise of Wessex, symbolized in the turn around victory of King Alfred the Great over the Viking Guthrum.[ix] For similar reasons, King Kamehameha the Great is lauded by many modern historians for uniting the Hawaiian islands right on the cusp of western colonial contact, and his heirs, like King Alfred’s, followed the Great King’s lead in the consolidation and centralization of military, political, economic, and legal control of lands and human resources that modernity marks as progress.[x] In particular, modern secularization makes us blind to spiritual power, an incommensurability particularly hard to address in the secular academy and one with which Pacific historians regularly struggle.[xi] And yet it is precisely the spiritual authority and physical location of a dead saint that wields considerable power in the English community imagined by Aldred and his peers in the late tenth century.\n\nThe Community of St. Cuthbert: Bede’s Tenth-Century Heirs\n\nThe lands north of the Humber river stretching beyond Hadrian’s wall to Scotland retain a distinctive heritage and identity to this day, intertwined with the long course of “English” history. Northumbria in the early medieval era (c. 600-1100) is nonetheless marked by a rise and fall trajectory in relation to the master narrative of Anglo-Saxon history. Its heyday in terms of contributing to English history was in the eighth century, the so-called golden age of Northumbria, with its hybrid Irish-English legacy, highlighted in the brilliant artistic achievements of the monastic community of Lindisfarne and its satellites still visible in sculpture and manuscript illumination as well as memorialized in the Venerable Bede’s ecclesiastical history of the English people.[xii] Arguably the most celebrated English artifact of eighth-century Northumbria besides Bede and his work is the Lindisfarne Gospels manuscript with its colorful carpet pages and evangelist portraits, prominently on display in the British Library in London.[xiii] Both Bede and the Lindisfarne Gospels serve as exemplars defining “Englishness,” but both have this eighth-century Northumbrian heritage embedded in them that was appropriated after the golden age by south of the Humber West Saxon royals who sought legitimacy for their political hegemony in the spiritual legacy of Lindisfarne, symbolized by its most famous saint, Cuthbert. Indeed, the living presence of Cuthbert presides over this whole history in ways nearly invisible to modern secular eyes.\n\nIn contrast to its glory days and the rising power of Wessex, the late ninth and tenth-century history of Northumbria is marred by a fragmented political landscape of competing bands of Vikings and local elites. In this narrative, the beleaguered Lindisfarne religious community abandoned its famous tidewater location, carrying their relics and treasures with them to one of their lesser estates at Chester-le-Street, where they held on through the turmoil for a century, rescued ultimately by the patronage of the West Saxon monarchs and monastic reform after the community’s move to a new site at Durham in the eleventh century.[xiv] Meanwhile, translated from Latin into the West Saxon dialect of Old English, Bede’s history became the foundation for a vernacular English historical tradition sponsored by King Alfred (r. 871-899).[xv] To Chester-le-Street came his heirs, Wessex Kings Athelstan in 934 and Edmund in 945, seeking to honor Saint Cuthbert with gifts and gain his approval, while back home in the south they enhanced the liturgy celebrating this Northumbrian English saint.[xvi] By the tenth century, then, Northumbria’s value lay in its past.\n\nThe deadest of the dead zone in the histories of this period in Northumbria occurs in the second half of the tenth century, precisely when Aldred lived and worked on the Lindisfarne Gospels and other manuscripts at the Chester-le-Street community of St. Cuthbert. Even the local histories preserved at Durham have little to say about the community’s activities and scant artifactual evidence survives—certainly nothing like the eighth-century Lindisfarne treasures they preserved—except the odd handiwork of Aldred and his fellow scribes.[xvii] Consequently, Aldred sticks out as a lonely figure in a dreary time. Yet he may have seem himself and his community’s history a bit differently, given that he did not know how activities begun in his time played out over the next century: the successful centralization of an English monarchy, a sweeping monastic reform of the church, and the incorporation of Viking communities into the realm.\n\nThus Aldred’s uniqueness gives us a perspective on tenth-century England from a different temporal and geographic angle. For Aldred, the Northumbrian past was a living and present thing, vital to the English future. He, with the community of St. Cuthbert at Chester-le-Street, saw himself as a link in this temporal chain. Northumbria still had resources of value to all of the English: for the rise of Wessex, they had the body and spirit of Cuthbert as patron saint; for church reform, they offered liturgical experimentation, albeit their efforts went virtually unrecognized; and for the Viking presence, they offered a pattern of integration into the Christian community. But perhaps the best historiographical insight comes from what Aldred did in the manuscript now housed as a national treasure in London, his Old English gloss and bilingual colophon in the Lindisfarne Gospels.\n\nTo most eyes, Aldred’s contribution to the Lindisfarne Gospels appears static and backward looking, something that modernity undervalues in favor of forward-looking change to the new. His script is old-fashioned, his dialect local, and his Latinity questionable, all evidence used to demonstrate the low point reached by the Lindisfarne survivors at Chester-le-Street in the late tenth century. Nonetheless, his colophon at the end of the manuscript reveals that his local and old-fashioned preferences may have been deliberate archaizing. He places himself, rather cleverly, in direct connection to the eighth-century golden age preserved in the Lindisfarne Gospels, and values his own contribution as equal to theirs. The colophon is actually quite complex, code-switching between Latin, the universal language of Christianity, and the local vernacular Old English.[xviii]\n\nThe brief poem cited at the outset Aldred wrote into the right margin of the last section of the gospel of John he had recently finished glossing:\n\n+May the letter, faithful servant of speech, reveal me; greet, O kind one, all my brothers with [your] voice.[xix]\n\nThese Latin verses address the present and future members of his religious community in a personal way: he wants to be remembered after his death by the fruits of his labor, as a wordsmith.[xx] Aldred’s fixation with the power of words continues in the main colophon below the end of the Gospel. [….][xxi]\n\nMuch more can and has been said about this colophon, usually focused on what it tells us about the original construction of the manuscript in the eighth century, rather than the tenth-century community of St. Cuthbert at Chester-le-Street or Aldred himself.[xxii] But by revealing, however briefly, his identity and motives to his community—past, present, and future—Aldred also reveals himself to us; and in reverse, we see his community through his eyes, a lens with a very different sense of time and place. Aldred acknowledges the golden age production in his hands and its creators, but he does not seem to acknowledge the reduced circumstances of the community at Chester-le-Street, to which he paid admission with both money and this skillful work. Moreover, the glossing in Old English is seen as an enhancement to the manuscript, not as a concession to weak Latinity. He was probably commissioned to do the task based on his expertise: able to translate Latin into Northumbrian Old English, able to write in an older script appropriate to this legacy manuscript.\n\nIn short, this is not a moribund community barely hanging on in a time of turmoil but one full of pride in its heritage. Why, given the material poverty so obvious to us? Because of the spiritual, atemporal riches they possessed, which we are less able or willing to measure. Aldred is quite clear on the powers that sustain his community in his dedication to God and St. Cuthbert. To Aldred and his community, the spiritual presence of a “dead” saint is worth more than gold and silver. Arguably Wessex kings thought so also, in bringing their gifts of books and gilt liturgical furnishings to honor the saint and win his favor. To understand how powerful the living presence of the past can be to a medieval community long dead to us moderns, I turn to the contemporary Pacific, where resurrecting the pre-contact past in the post-colonial present is a matter of vital importance to the future.[xxiii]\n\nThe View from the Pacific\n\nThe Pacific as a geographic and cultural zone has a similar, though not identical, temporal divide to medieval and modern running through it: pre- and post-contact. This Euro-American colonial marker has generated a second divide into the post-colonial present. In turn, postcolonial historiography, with postmodernism, addresses the question of “what now?” as voices from former colonies around the globe struggle to reclaim their own sense of history while wrestling with the hegemony of a western narrative of progress. Contemporary scholars of the Pacific, speaking as mediators from within their respective cultures and from within the academy, highlight colonialist destruction and desecration of their lands and histories. These scholars are exploring a sense of place in the unique histories of distinctive island groups amid a pan-Pacific identity that cuts across time, based on shared stories of origin and migration as well as linguistic and artifactual similarities that speak to the interconnections between zones of settlement (currently divided into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia).[xxiv] This ongoing process of ethnogenesis—both recovery of almost lost ancient ways of thinking and the creation of new forms of connection to the past—offer perhaps the best in new historiography from which all historians could benefit. In particular, Hawaiian and other Polynesian societies have a rich notion of living and feeling history that stands in stark contrast to the dead, objectifying historical discourse of modernity.\n\nAt the heart of history in almost any culture, including “Anglo-Saxon” as well as Pacific societies, is the notion of storytelling linked to genealogy. Ethnogenesis is more than a recent theory, but a very human way of thinking: Who are we and how do we belong to each other and to this place?[xxv] The Hawaiian word mo‘olelo (“story”) in practice conveys a sense of kinship between land and people, the dead and the living. Indeed, ka wā ma mua in the Hawaiian language defines the past not only as the time before but as in front. Similarly, ka wā ma hope is the time after or behind, that is the open and unknowable future.[xxvi] In essence, the past is before us and the future is behind us in a way that Aldred would understand as he looked back in the Lindisfarne Gospels colophon while speaking forward. In this conception of history and memory, one faces the past while moving backward into the future because, unlike the future which we cannot see and which is not fixed, our eyes can survey and interpret what came before as a guide to the future we are backing into. In some ways, this view mirrors Kierkegaard’s assertion that “life can only be understood backwards,” but the philosopher’s actual emphasis was on the limitations of that truism because life must also be “lived forwards;” it is impossible to “rest” in the backward-looking position except perhaps through the illumination of a life-view, so that “life is lived backwards through the idea.”[xxvii] This resonance between a western philosopher and Hawaiian historiography may be because Kierkegaard’s views are more medieval Christian than modern and secular: his view of time is similar to Bede’s Incarnational history.[xxviii] Kathleen Davis points to Bede’s open and unfixed view of future time, in contrast not only to some of his contemporary Christians but also in contradistinction to the modern progress view of history resolutely facing toward a foretold future that medievalizes a dead past.[xxix] While Davis compares Bede’s historiography to Amitav Ghosh’s In An Antique Land, this essay draws a different parallel with Pacific historiographies as a way out of the modern/medieval conundrum Davis exposes but does not resolve.[xxx] To do so, I turn to an early twentieth-century bicultural historian of the Pacific who offers some other ways of reading tenth-century Northumbria.\n\nTe Rangi Hiroa or Sir Peter Buck (1877-1951) was a Maori-Irish medical doctor, anthropologist, author, and director of Honolulu’s Bishop Museum, whose collection of Polynesian artifacts and histories he helped built. Hiroa/Buck—the slash an admittedly awkward way of recalling his hybrid heritages—was an early proponent of a pan-Pacific identity traceable in islander stories of origins and migration, although his views on kinship “blood” are heavily colored by early twentieth-century racial genetics derived from his western academic training. Author of Vikings of the Pacific (1959; originally Vikings of the Sunrise, 1938), the title and introduction of this book invoke a comparison between the maritime history of the Vikings and that of the Polynesians.[xxxi] His overview of world maritime history traces the center of gravity swinging from the Mediterranean, to the North Sea, to the Atlantic, then finally the Pacific to highlight his Polynesian Vikings of the “sunrise,” whom he designates the “supreme navigators of history” in line with a romantic and Victorian conception of the Norsemen as “bold, intrepid mariners,” not marauders.[xxxii]\n\nIn terms of methodology, his book combines “more human” oral histories gathered from fellow Polynesians with the western (and arguably less humane) methods of “measurements, measurements, and yet more measurements.”[xxxiii] Ironically, the latter scientific measurements he offers are now completely out of date and even racially offensive, while the former, the primary accounts and personal stories, continue to provide valuable ethnographic information from native informants. In his consideration of cultural diaspora in the Pacific, Buck identifies Polynesian mariners as “Europoid” (i.e., Caucasian) and not “Negroid” or “Mongoloid,” based on stature, head measurement, skin tone, hair type, and nose width (Maoris have “the narrowest noses in Polynesia!”), concluding: “Sufficient for the day is the fact that a tall, athletic people without woolly hair or a Mongoloid eyefold had the ability and courage to penetrate into the hitherto untraversed seaways of the central and eastern Pacific.” [xxxiv] This precocious Polynesian strain, even when mixed with Mongoloids or Negroids, he portrays as superior, particularly to the Melanesians, views contrasting starkly with his sympathetic portrayal of Polynesian islanders with whom he feels kinship through his Maori heritage.\n\nThe tensions over identity and ways of thinking that Hiroa/Buck reveals about himself in Vikings of the Pacific challenge our notion of what it means to “belong” to a community and also highlight the instability of the medieval/modern and pre-/post-contact divides. Instead, Hiroa/Buck offers some possibilities for spiritual kinships that cut across human-constructed boundaries of time and geography in a way that may help us understand Aldred’s spiritual community in tenth-century Northumbria. Both situations reveal a complex mediation occurring between a distinctive local identity that ties genealogy to land and a larger atemporal conception of belonging to some global migratory community, whether Christendom or pan-Polynesia. Neither one is accommodated by the modern nation-state construct with its secular materialist underpinnings and ethnic nationalisms.\n\nFirst of all, linguistic and emotional senses of community are inextricably linked in Vikings of the Pacific. Like many bicultural translators and writers, Hiroa/Buck functions as a “go-between,” a label Kathleen Biddick also applies to Bede in the conversation she imagines he has with a modern Chicana feminist scholar about bilinguality.[xxxv] Hiroa/Buck, “writing in English and thinking in Polynesian” wrestled with his linguistic hybridity. His father from the north of Ireland, his mother Maori, he describes himself as “binomial, bilingual, and inherit[ing] a mixture of two bloods that I would not change for a total of either…. My mother’s blood enables me to appreciate a culture to which I belong, and my father’s speech helps me to interpret it.”[xxxvi] Here language and rationality are linked in opposition to blood and feeling, with the scientific operating as the interpreter of the genetic and emotional. This racialized view of genealogy is not from his Maori side, but a modern construct from his medical education imposed on Polynesian senses of blood and kinship, in a way similar to nineteenth- and twentieth-century efforts to establish ethnic nationalities in Europe based on medieval linguistic constructions of identity.\n\nNonetheless, despite or because of his scientific training, the incommensurability of language in translation cuts deeply into Hiroa/Buck’s interior dialogue between his two halves. In one instance he retells the voyaging story of Ru in the Cook Islands, a story his hosts offer him because he was “blood of our blood and bone of our bone.”[xxxvii] As recording ethnographer he then wrestles with the translation of Ru’s invocation of the god Tangaroa: “‘Tangaroa i te titi,/ ‘Tangaroa i te tata” he translated in his own bilingual mind as “Tangaroa in the titi, Tangaroa in the tata,” thinking it a “mere” play on sounds. When he asked the meaning of titi and tata, the elderly chief indicated with the sweep of his arm the whole horizon and replied: “Can we find words? Are not titi and tata as good as anything else to represent what we cannot express?” Hiroa/Buck then moves through his two linguistic modes of thinking. First he translates the phrase into English and western conceptual terms, using his father’s speech to render the lines as “the immensity of space.” Then he code switches back and says to the chief: “‘Yes…Tangaroa in the titi, Tangaroa in the tata. It could not be better expressed,’” adding in the book (emphasis mine) “I thought so then, and I feel more so now.”\n\nThat sense of incommensurability of thought and feeling lurks also in the bilingual glossing work of Aldred, but in some ways reversed: the Latin language is the measured, formal terms that Aldred seeks to express in his native Northumbrian language, often using calques, alternative words, and in some cases offering literal followed by interpretive glosses reflecting a range of theological meanings available in medieval Biblical exegesis.[xxxviii] Aldred as a “go-between” negotiated the boundary between the universal Latin language of Christendom and the Northumbrian-inflected English of his community. Like Hiroa/Buck it is Aldred’s native language that runs deeper in “feeling,” an aspect historians tend to psychologize rather than see as part of real systems of meaningful connection.\n\nHiroa/Buck’s emotional commitments to his communal heritages also illustrate a western binary of belief as feeling versus rationality, with a colonial twist on Irishness. Throughout the book, he exhibits considerable ambivalence about his mixed genetics, saying early on “with all my love for my mother’s stock, my father’s unbelieving blood gives me pause,” and yet he credits his historical empathy to both: in discussing a particular chant, he notes that “the words are simple, but perhaps only the Polynesians and the Irish [my emphasis] can feel the depth of poignant grief expressed in simple words.”[xxxix] This comment actually replicates a Victorian, as well as British colonial, notion of the emotional Irish, where loquacious feelings and storytelling displace rationality and underlie the Catholic superstition associated with a lingering medievalness in the Irish. For example, in 1926 Charles Plummer compared the prolific and self-revealing colophons of medieval Irish scribes to encounters modern travelers to Ireland might have with an Irishman who “will discuss his most intimate private affairs with any casual stranger whom he may happen to meet;” while “the relief which the modern Irishman finds in this kind of conversation” is given as an ethnic trait which the presumably stiffer Englishman finds uncomfortable.[xl] Embedded in these remarks are a set of encoded social and scholarly values about Irish difference: that scribes normally should be subservient to the text they copy and not insert their personal lives into the manuscript; that real scholars remain emotionally distant from their subjects to retain a scientific objectivity; and that the Irish, then and now, transgress social as well as scholarly boundaries, at least from the perspective of their cultural superiors as represented by Plummer. The upshot is that the Irish remain medieval and colonized.\n\nUnsurprisingly Aldred’s colophon in the Lindisfarne Gospels fits this Irish mode of intimate and revealing colophon writing Plummer describes so paternalistically. Consequently, Aldred also speaks from a historiographically and socially marginalized position, in the eyes of early modern historians at least, as emotionally “too Irish” and not West Saxon enough, textually “too superstitious” in his Catholic liturgy and not sufficiently proto-Protestant enough, and altogether too medieval for the modern, forward-facing imagination.[xli] Curiously, Hiroa/Buck performs the same action as Plummer on himself, but with different results: the combined Maori and Irish capacity for feeling stands in contrast to the cool (modern, western) scholar with his tools of measurement. That scientific detachment must be, then, only a veneer on his Maori/Irish self, useful measures to deploy at will, but also to discard, as well we might today in reading Vikings of the Pacific with its distasteful racial categories. In many ways, Hiroa/Buck was living in limbo between colonizer and colonized, with the latter doubled, perhaps invisibly to him, since both Irish and Maori were colonial subjects of the dominant British and western academic sciences.\n\nAlthough Hiroa/Buck imagines himself as bicultural, his hybridity is actually more complex, reflecting layers of historical memories: Maori and New Zealander, Irish, English, and even Viking. The overall tenor of Vikings of the Pacific suggests that Hiroa/Buck’s emotional affinities ran deeper than the scholar-speak he adopts. In one instance, he notes that he could not take skulls as museum artifacts because he says, “I have a feeling—a superstition, if you will—that if I did, I would destroy the sympathetic relationship that exists between their past and me.”[xlii] Insofar as superstition is a belief inconsistent with one’s worldview, Hiroa/Buck has a problem for he has two worldviews operating simultaneously that he tries to meld but which leave him in the dubious position of finding a rational belief in one system appear inconsistent and therefore superstitious in the other: the scientific belief in genetic determinism stands in opposition to the Maori sense of kinship with the dead.[xliii] Thus the cataloging scientific approach threatens to break the bond that allows him to extract vital cultural data from his informants. He chooses the feeling, superstitious as it may appear from the science side of himself, and in so doing, he shows that the imagined community of Polynesianness is stronger than the adopted western heritage of scientific analysis.\n\nIn this instance of “skulldudgery,” Hiroa/Buck could just as easily have drawn not only on his Polynesian sense of place but also his Irish roots to access medieval Christian views of the sacred dead in the landscape—except that Hiroa/Buck’s understanding of his Irish heritage is so heavily colored by layers of British, Protestant, and modern rationalism that he was not able to make that connection in the way he did with the Polynesians and the Vikings as master navigators.[xliv] In fact, his father’s family was Anglo-Irish Protestant with clerical ancestors at Trinity College, Dublin; he had little contact with the Irish side of the family and never visited Ireland, although he married a “fiery” Belfast born Irishwoman.[xlv] Given the very Anglican name of Peter Buck at birth, Maori tribal elders granted him in his teens the ancestral name Te Rangi Hiroa.[xlvi] This genealogically based naming and renaming illustrates a sense of continuity: the presence of the dead in the living demonstrates how the past confers meaning on the present.[xlvii] Western honorifics occurred later in life. New Zealand belatedly conferred knighthood in recognition of his achievements for his homeland, at a time when he was living and working in Hawai‘i as director of Bishop Museum (from 1936 until his death in 1951). When the King of Sweden awarded him the Order of the North Star in 1946, a physician friend, Dr. Nils Larsen, at the ceremony in Honolulu engaged in a fake Viking blood brother ritual with him, a joke probably only apparent to the two men.[xlviii] The Irish blood Hiroa/Buck claimed to be a part of his emotional makeup may be as fictive a kinship as the Viking blood he exchanges: it is notional more than actual, relying on a trope of Irish character as represented through the lens of British colonialism.\n\nIf he had been able to tap the medieval Irish roots obscured by his British Protestant birthright, he might have noted not only the Viking-Irish foundation of Dublin but also the spiritual sensibilities that echoed faintly in his sense of common feeling between his Irish and Polynesian blood and that prevented him from removing the skulls to a museum. The repatriation of bones today, like the medieval translation of a saint, is a serious political act, often as not intending to redress or undo colonial damage. But in emphasizing the political as secular in our modern way of seeing things, we often overlook the spiritual power and emotional bonds connected to the dead as these subject cultures resist not only the colonizer’s political agency but also modernity as a historical colonizer of their past.[xlix]\n\nSimilarly for our understanding of tenth-century Northumbria, Cuthbert’s bones are a vital clue to cultural relations with Ireland and Wessex. At one point as the community of St. Cuthbert moved away from the Viking-induced political turmoil around Lindisfarne, they attempted to take the saint’s body to Ireland for safety. However, the saint at the pleas of his people turned them back so that Cuthbert stayed on Northumbrian land.[l] Moreover, over the next century with the assertion of Wessex control of Northumbria, no records suggest that any Wessex king attempted to move the body of Cuthbert away from Northumbria into Wessex. The saint was, and is, immovable, his permanence in the landscape based on a spiritual potential. Thus it is that Northumbria in the person of St. Cuthbert was not to be colonized by anyone and maintains a distinctive identity tied to the lands north of the Humber to this day. I daresay if someone from outside Britain tried to move Cuthbert’s bones from his Durham Cathedral tomb today, there would be a political uproar, and perhaps even invocations of the curse of Saint Cuthbert, a superstition excused by feelings of local or national pride.[li] Yet, the casual manner in which EuroAmerican researchers acquired and displayed Pacific islanders’ bones ostensibly justifies itself based on a modern secular and materialist view of death as inconsequential and therefore of the past as dead; but this view apparently only applied to other people’s histories, not one’s own. Caught on the fence between these views, Hiroa/Buck’s Maori sense of kinship to the past won out. Indeed, Hiroa/Buck’s imagined Polynesian community stretching across the Pacific was solid enough to undercut the western scientific rationalism impinging on islanders’ historical memory, although he was unable to do so with his Irish heritage medievalized by modern secularism.\n\nHiroa/Buck’s cultural conflict between his Irish and Maori affections and his western intellectualism also correlates with the historiographic temporal divide Davis exposes, where thought is modern and feeling is pre-modern or not modern, a dream of the past that is unreal.[lii] While musing on the “virile branches” of Polynesians in the Marquesas, he asked “Can we ever see the throbbing past except in dreams? I do not wish to awake, for when I do, I will see but a line drawing in a book that conjures up a lone terrace overgrown with exotic weeds, and sad stone walls crumbling to decay.”[liii] His Maori sense of history, similar to the Hawaiian mo‘olelo, is rooted in the oral transmission of stories: what links him to other Polynesians he visits are the ritual exchange of genealogies and “ancient traditions,” which he first had to master in his Maori homeland from his grandmother and other elders.[liv] In another revealing passage on Maori history and identity from his twin perspectives, he concludes by leaving them “to work out their own salvation in the firm conviction that the stamina and mentality inherited from their stone-age ancestors will enable them to make good in a changing world.”[lv] After these allusions to a Christian and then a scientific view of historical progress, he then ends the chapter by bidding farewell to the land of his birth with a translation of a dirge for a chief that has a distinctly ubi sunt feel to it.\n\nSuch hybrid passages point to an interesting feature of Hiroa/Buck’s historiography: when he speaks from within his Polynesian sense of history, his views are firm and real; when he is caught in the modern/scientific progress view facing the future, his uncertainty and dislocation toward the past is palpable. From this conflicted position, what Hiroa/Buck offers us is a way to tap a more vital, living sense of history in contrast to the deadening and objectifying of modern, secular historiography, one that connects the living and the dead and is tempered with a dose of humility. In some ways, the stories Hiroa/Buck recounts capture the same communal sense of identity and deference to ancestors found in early English historical narratives like Bede’s ecclesiastical history.\n\nThis “feeling” is precisely what is lacking in many ethnographies and histories of migration: the way that a communal sense of place has a spiritual dimension in the formation of cultural identities in “non-modern” societies. A sense of connectedness is most evident in the evocative style of first person narrative Hiroa/Buck uses in Vikings of the Pacific. When he is telling Polynesian stories he understands from within his Maori upbringing, his voice is rich with a sense of intimacy, the color of his language deep hued compared to the black and white of dialectical scientific analysis. Similarly, Aldred played across the linguistic boundary between impersonal, universal and timeless Latin and the intimacy of the local vernacular of his contemporary community, done as part of a spiritual act of worship. Go-betweens like Hiroa/Buck and contemporary Pacific historians can teach us how to break out of the objectifying mold of academic language (even, and maybe especially, the trap of postmodern theory speak) by drawing on a personal sense of connection to people of the past through narratives of encounters and continuities, not just analyses of spatial and temporal dislocations found in medieval/modern or pre-/post-contact.\n\nThus despite or because of his mixed legacy of western colonial racism and islander perspectives, Hiroa/Buck offers some lessons for decolonizing the Middle Ages. For example, his Viking and Polynesian comparative historiography is instructive, inviting us to rethink the maritime zones of the Atlantic and North Sea. On a larger, world historical scale, he describes an oceanic sense of place at odds with the western nation-state with its terrestrially bounded seas. Next generation Pacific historian Epeli Hau‘ofa has articulated how, for Polynesian societies and their mariners, the ocean is their home and the islands simply locations within that landscape, in contrast to the western explorers’ sense of the ocean as a vast, empty space through which one must traverse to get “to” someplace.[lvi] Similarly, the British Isles can be seen through the lens of waves of migration inhabiting coastal zones that faced water. Archaeological and anthropological evidence suggests that over the longue durée of this Atlantic and North Sea zone, various people groups came to its shores, often as not facing outward, not inward toward unifying the landmass.[lvii] When the Vikings roamed this same zone and beyond, they saw the world as shores connected by water: with globe rotated to place the North Atlantic at the center, the seaways connecting Scandinavia westward to Scotland and Northumbria, Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland, on to North America are obvious.[lviii] That was, in effect, Aldred’s world, defined by overlapping zones of contact and interacting people groups more so than the rise of a central monarchy that he, unlike us, would have seen as a temporary phase in a longer spiritual history of his community.\n\nLater, Captain Cook mapped the same terrain as the Vikings in Newfoundland and Labrador, not to mention archipelagos in the Pacific. Today, Cook is memorialized with statues and museums at his home port of Whitby, in Newfoundland, and on the Big Island of Hawai‘i where his death is the subject of competing historiographical narratives.[lix] Hiroa/Buck mentions Cook as a “rediscoverer” of islands and the source of contemporary names assigned them, siding for example with the “peaceable and industrious people” of Niue objecting to Cook’s renaming of their home as Savage Island because someone threw a spear at him—and missed: “Why should an individual failure be perpetuated on the descendants of a bad marksman?”[lx] Because names tell a story, renaming, like the removal and restoration of bones and artifacts, is a political act of disempowerment or re-empowerment. Hiroa/Buck’s ironic query puts Cook in his place within a larger and longer history of Polynesian peoples.\n\nBecause Hiroa/Buck stands at a geographic and temporal nexus, he can speak from within multiple stories, albeit not always harmoniously. Yet Vikings of the Pacific contains alternative models more inclusive of the spiritual dimension so absent from modern and even postmodern discourse about identities and communities. Hiroa/Buck traces different versions of Polynesian origins for the islands and its people groups. Some, like the Sāmoans, focus on a sense of their island as a sacred center from which they emerged, seemingly in denial of the western constructions of their migration history from elsewhere. This leaves the outsider historian pitting a “religious” legend against an evidence based and seemingly objective account that therefore must be “really true,” at least from a western scientific view. The same might be said of trying to reconcile Bede’s account of English history with the archaeological record: which is more truth-telling depends on your view of what is essential.\n\nSimilar to these contrasting accounts of human migration and origins, stories of the formation of Pacific island chains vary.[lxi] The more widespread Polynesian account of the emergence of island chains is the story of Maui fishing up the islands. But as in many cultures, including the accounts of creation in Genesis or the origins of the Anglo-Saxons, several alternative storylines are available. In Hawai‘i, one account has Papa-hanau-moku giving birth to the islands fathered by Wakea or made directly by his hands.[lxii] But the nineteenth-century Hawaiian historian David Malo (1795-1853) found the competing oral accounts from the ancients contradictory, preferring the genealogical Kumulipo creation account of the islands emerging on their own, without the birth narrative, as easier to synchronize with the “speculative” geologic theories of volcanic origins.[lxiii] Interestingly, Hiroa/Buck questions Malo’s westernizing syncretism: “Yes, who knows? Probably the geologists will support David Malo and the Kumulipo, for the like of Wakea and Papa are not to be seen today.”[lxiv] Hiroa/Buck’s doubt, and sense of loss, opens the way for a different epistemology that can accommodate seemingly incommensurable “truth-telling” narratives. We can choose, then, to put these accounts on a level playing field without marking them on a temporizing scale of less to more truth, from primitive oral myth through medieval superstition to the modern rational.[lxv] Instead, we might consider the spiritual connections Aldred and his community felt as more than imaginary.\n\nWe return then to Hiroa/Buck’s epilogue to Vikings of the Pacific quoting the Maori proverb “the old net is laid aside; a new net goes afishing” and ending with the poignant query “What new net goes afishing?” Although he laid the foundation collecting and storing oral histories during his time as Director of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hiroa/Buck did not live to see the Hawaiian renaissance of the 1970s and the recreation of Pacific navigation by the Polynesian Voyaging Society that saw the old nets repaired.[lxvi] The double-hulled sailing canoe Hōkūle‘a made the roundtrip from Hawai‘i to Tahiti with startling “scientific” accuracy (in terms of modern instrumentation) using “traditional” wayfinding methods derived from chants, oral histories, and most crucially, from the memories and experiences of one living Micronesian navigator, Pius “Mau” Piailug (1932-2010).[lxvii]\n\nHiroa/Buck would undoubtedly find in this and subsequent recreated voyages validation for his Vikings of the Pacific narrative of Polynesian migration, perhaps even happy to see the “scientific” racial theories within which he operated discarded, overturned by the accuracy of cultural information contained in oral histories that he had a hand in preserving. But he might also be stymied, as many contemporary Pacific writers are, by the continuing devaluation in secular academic discourse of the power of spiritual communities across time and place. Similarly, hybridized Northumbrians like Bede and Aldred might be both gratified at what survives from their era of the Irish, English, and Viking heritages and chagrined at the loss of spiritual community between the living and the dead they valued so highly.\n\nThese spiritual communities in Hiroa/Buck’s Polynesian ethnography and Bede’s Anglo-Saxon history are more than emotional communities; they are not imagined or theorized, but narratives breaking out of the dialectic of colonizer and colonized, medieval and modern, religious and secular. Imbedded in that dialectic are more subtle but pervasive values drawn from modernity and still infecting the academy, where the subjectivity of lived experience, beliefs, and personal connection to the past belong to literary studies of fiction and autobiography, while scholarly historical writing retains a preference for scientific observation that is “objectively more true,” at least based on a materialist worldview.[lxviii] Hybrid voices from the twentieth-century Pacific, like Hiroa/Buck, offer us a way out of this dualism and entry into the medieval past and its “pre-modern” worldviews. When marginal figures like Aldred are moved from the periphery into the center, at the point of contact between times and places, they allow us to hear the polyphony in what often becomes a monophonic historical narrative. The Hawaiian word kaona conveys this sense of unwrapping layers of meanings through dialogue, both transmitted orally and in cross-cultural translation efforts.[lxix] This essay similarly has been structured around unwrapping layers of meaning in the way we relate to the past and therefore concludes with an examination of those wrappings.\n\nConclusion and Colophon\n\nThe Pacific view of Northumbria sketched in this essay has at least three implications. First, echoing Davis’ work, all historians need to be wary of the lurking medieval/modern divide in western colonial discourse that affects our understanding of both the European past and the global present. Second, we need to query the secularization theory of modernity while paying more attention to the spiritual powers at work in historical memory, by evoking feelings of connection as well as valuing thoughtful objectivity. And third, in order to do both of these, we should consider the world/comparative possibilities for developing a Pacific historiography that can help rewrite European history out of its periodization mire.\n\nThe previous paragraph does the expected work of a conclusion in academic discourse: it makes generalized recommendations in the invisible third person, in which the author remains an omniscient narrator. But in so doing, the conclusion fails to take its own advice and apply the lessons gleaned from Pacific historians. At the outset, this essay proposed an authoethnographic mode to escape the colonizing and secularizing influence of the modernist project. The author-historian who brought Aldred and Hiroa/Buck together needs to acknowledge her own position in relation to the two subjects in order to generalize to other historians the lessons she derived from serving as a go-between bridging tenth-century Northumbria and the twentieth-century Pacific. Like Aldred, I have erased the “I” from the main narrative history but am prepared to add some personal genealogy into the margin.\n\nIn terms of heritage and identity, I cannot claim to be either Northumbrian or Hawaiian. While some of my ancestors came to the Americas from the British Isles and perhaps even Northumbria, my Englishness is indirect and distant, derived from Anglo-American Protestant culture. As a consequence, my relation to Northumbria is studied more than lived, although the boundary between the personal and scholarly experience is more blurred than most historians will admit: I have come to know Aldred and his tenth-century community through time consuming, arguably obsessive, scrutiny of manuscript artifacts; and while conducting research on site, I have interacted with and received support from contemporary scholars who are also Northumbrians.[lxx] Meanwhile, I have lived in Hawai‘i for over thirty years where I remain a haole (foreigner) in relation to the Kānaka Maoli (indigenous Hawaiians), but also a kama‘āina (child of the land) in the inclusive understanding of residency fostered by the Hawaiian kingdom.[lxxi]\n\nThus despite my outsider status in relation to both geographic zones, I experience a “sense of place” in both the contemporary Pacific with its ways of looking toward the past and tenth-century Northumbria as it manifests itself today in the surviving artifacts and landscape north of the Humber river. As a consequence, I feel some kinship with Aldred analogous to Hiroa/Buck’s connection to his Polynesian informants. Living as a kama‘āina and observing Kānaka Maoli both recovering and establishing their historical voices has enriched my own understanding of culture and identity, while raising serious questions about the methods of history. From this position in a triangular relationship with cultural translators Aldred and Hiroa/Buck, I become like them, a go-between writing a colophon addressed to fellow historians about our scholarly pursuit—our calling, if you will.\n\nIf we as historians stand outside of any time and place, we are also simultaneously seeking to be within a particular time and place. Pacific historiographies offer us a way of negotiating that dual role. In a sense, they suggest discarding the newer net of modern, objectifying dialectic for an old net, repaired and made whole and usable for understanding the past as something intimate and alive. Two sets of challenging questions emerge:\n\nCan we evacuate the dialectic historiography of modernity that presently takes up so much space that we have no room to tell a story with feeling? Can we get beyond the nation-state frame of reference and colonialist periodization? To undo the medieval/modern divide, we need to reach back further, learn to narrate history over again, to tell a story as Bede or Hiroa/Buck did, finding a voice from within our hybridity while revealing, like Aldred in his colophon, our go-between status as cultural translators.\n\nAre we willing to allow the dead to be a part of us, include them in our story, and allow them to speak to our present, postmodern condition? Are we willing to stop taking the past apart and begin constructing whole narratives? Our ancestor historians from across time and place call us to feel as well as analyze who we are as we turn our face toward the past and listen to them a bit more intently.\n\nThis essay’s title, “Vikings of the Pacific: An Oceanic View of the Early Medieval British Isles,” may merely serve to expose a particular historian’s perspective, looking back at a community almost half way around the globe over a millennium ago, but it also asks all historians whether that temporal and geographic distance adds to or subtracts meaning from the past.\n\n[i] A free translation of Littera me pandat sermonis fida ministra./ Omnes alme meos fratres voce salvta.

While digging the foundation for a new building they discovered graves of Hawaiians, ostensibly Christian burials in the churchyard, but other voices claiming a living connection to these dead believe they should remain undisturbed according to Hawaiian traditions. What were the intentions of the dead and their families at their burial?

These reflections are more autobiographical than is appropriate for a scholarly publication, and also still in progress as I seek to apply them to my historical fiction novel on Aldred chronicled on this blog. I have inserted some zentangle wood tile images to break up the text. Apologies for special characters in Indigenous words not represented correctly in the WordPress font.\n\nPost-colonial and Post-secular Insights from African-American and Indigenous Studies\n\nIn focusing on magical realism in contemporary fiction, the earlier blog post delved into the effects of western binaries by citing primarily Kathleen Davis, N. T. Wright, and Martin Luther King. In this post I would like to extend that exploration of ontologies into post-colonial and post-secular studies from African-American and Indigenous studies.[1] These approaches not only deconstruct modern western ontologies that have constricted our thinking, but they also offer a means of escape for all of us, including scholars of early medieval Britain.\n\nAs noted in my earlier post, I am a white non-Indigenous person learning to listen to the voices of contemporary Indigenous and African-American spiritualities decolonizing minds, bodies, and souls. I am grateful for the generosity of spirit found among cultural practitioners here in Hawai‘i and other Indigenous scholars, particularly the thoughtful invitation to medievalists from Tarren Andrews (Bitterroot Salish) to go beyond just “engaging with” Indigenous studies and enter into kinship relationships with a good heart (x.est spúʔus).[2] In this ongoing process of listening and learning, I am endeavoring to apply these insights to a study of early medieval Britain, mindful of my own cultural limits and the risks of mis-appropriation. I begin with some deconstruction of the western binarisms and ontologies that have limited me.\n\nOntologies, ways of categorizing human experience or perception of the world, easily fall into hierarchical chains. Even the word ontology and associated categorical terms betray power differentials. Among Indigenous thinkers, Zoe Todd notes that “ontology is just another word for colonialism,” while Edgar Garcia points out that “What some people call myth, or some people call magical thinking — we might just call it ‘theory.’ Or ‘conceptuality.’”[3] The semantic shifts between terms such as ‘myth’ and ‘theory’ are rooted in western philosophical ontologies contrasting magic with religion or science, in ways applied by colonizers to subjugated cultures whose systems of belief and reason were denigrated or dismissed as irrational.\n\nSimilarly, scholars of medieval “magic” wrestle to escape the modern progress model of magic-religion-science.[4] Naming as a means of othering, while categorizing along a system of hierarchical values, is rooted in language itself, particularly the power of Latin-based words with their scientific-sounding objectivity. Post-colonial push back on these linguistic ontologies highlights for those in the field of medieval European studies the need to recognize how deeply embedded this language is in our professional academic narratives, in turn revealing how our supposed scientific objectivity is riddled with inherent materialist biases against various forms of spirituality.[5]\n\nIn response to this materialist bias in modernity, Arturo Escobar notes how “we are facing modern problems for which there are no longer modern solutions” and adds:\n\nGiven that we cannot be intimate with the Earth within a mechanistic paradigm, we are in dire need of a New Story that might enable us to reunite the sacred and the universe, the human and the non-human. The wisdom traditions, including those of [I]ndigenous peoples, are a partial guide towards this goal of re-embedding ourselves within the Earth.[6]\n\nThis call for a New Story should be heard by both historians and fiction authors, but particularly those at the intersection of the two: those of us writing historical fiction need to break free of the modern western narratives of progress with its ontological hierarchies mapped onto the pre-modern.\n\nResistance to these modern storylines comes also from within global Christian communities “decolonizing the Gospel” by reframing or decentering the dominant and hegemonic western Christianity that came to their shores with colonialist missionaries.[7] Liberation theology emerging from Latin American and African American thinkers restores an incarnational Gospel message. For example, Barbara Holmes in Joy Unspeakable, outlines the contemplative practices of the Black Church in the African diaspora.[8] She describes an embodied spirituality that both resists the gnostic-like dualism of modern white evangelicalism in the U.S. but also points us to a larger more diverse set of Christian practices of spirituality globally and historically.[9]\n\nLikewise, post-colonial Native American, Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander “Jesus-followers,” to use one circumlocution avoiding the pejorative meaning attached to “Christian,” are working to restore a more holistic understanding of Indigenous Christianities free of western blinders.[10] Contextual theology suggests a dialogue between culture and an imported faith. Imagine, anthropologist Matt Tomlinson suggests, Jesus as the Pig of God rather than Lamb of God, or consider Tongan theologian Sione ‘Amanaki Havea’s Coconut Theology, embodying Jesus as the Coconut of Life, which provides the bread and the wine for the Eucharist, as does kalo (taro) with fresh water for Hawaiian Jesus-followers.[11]\n\nSuch acculturation of a proselytizing religion like Christianity is clearly evident in early medieval Britain, despite a Rome-centered narrative of universalizing and homogenizing. Consequently, the emergence of distinctive British, Irish, or English Christianities should be considered normative not aberrant.[12] For example, the hybridity of liturgical practice in the tenth-century Durham Cathedral Library A.IV.19 manuscript (the “Durham Ritual” or “Collectar”) that Aldred glossed and the community of St. Cuthbert at Chester-le-Street modified, should not be seen only in terms of its adherence to or deviation from the monastic reform movement emanating from Wessex, as if on the periphery, but viewed at the center of its own assertion of Northumbrian spirituality.[13]\n\nTwo further aspects of Indigenous ways of thinking are currently influencing my effort to write new stories about early medieval Northumbria. One is the role of language in terms of word choice among modern Englishes, the subject of a forthcoming scholarly essay, and the second has to do with holistic views of the natural world. Here I outline my current reflections on these two issues.\n\nThe words we choose have stories embedded in them, connecting current generations to the ancestors. As a consequence, reviving cultural memories through language education is central to contemporary post-colonial Indigenous movements, particularly the ways in which language is tied to a sense of place:\n\nI ka ʻōlelo ke ola, i ka ʻōlelo ka make (in language there is life, in language there is death). This ʻōlelo noʻeau (wise saying) inextricably links our survival as a people to the survival of our language. Languages convey nuances unique to our own worldviews, cultures, and traditions.[14]\n\nImperialist assertions of English dominance suppressing Indigenous languages has done and continues to do irreparable harm to linguistic diversity and cultural identities. Similarly, pidgin and creole languages developed by people of color under colonialism were and are often dismissed by language purists as “broken” English in favor of “standard” English. For example, Hawaiian Creole (HCE), locally called Pidgin, developed among settler colonialist workers whom plantation owners brought in from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and elsewhere in competition with one another, but who allied as laborers, but this form of Pidgin English also has roots in an earlier Pidgin Hawaiian (‘Ölelo Pa‘i‘ai). [15] Pidgins, along with the Indigenous language ‘Ölelo Hawai‘i, were disfavored or banned even before, but especially after the American overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai‘i, in favor of competence in standard English.[16]\n\nIn opposition to racist monlingualism (it is usually people of color whose bi- or tri-lingualism is disparaged), we need to move toward a narrative of multiple Englishes and the empowering creativeness of translingual environments.[17] Despite colonialist English-only prejudices, creole languages are neither ‘primitive’ nor simplistic; rather, they are the opposite of a ‘pure’ or ‘original’ language. They were created and developed in multilingual environments to facilitate communication between groups, as more than likely occurred in early medieval Northumbria between the dominant English speakers in relation to Irish, Welsh, Cumbric, and Scots Gaelic, as well as Old Norse. Such language mixing does not imply equality. The main lexifer for Hawaiian Creole is English, undoubtedly true also for the dominance of English speakers in early medieval Britain.[18] Moreover, language hierarchies established by those in power exist within and between various Englishes and Creoles; conversely, for the underclasses, speaking “local” can be a source of pride and resistance.\n\nThe concept of purity in languages is also applied to culture and religion, notably an invisible standard of what is ‘Christian’ on a sliding scale with ‘pagan’, with either one rated at the top: either valuing some mythical pure Christianity unsullied by local culture’s retention of pagan practices, or seeking some pure ‘original’ paganism stripped of its foreign Christian accretions.[19] Whichever way you tip it, this scale is another instance of a linguistic ontology that inhibits our understanding of the past as well as the present.\n\nA second thread in contemporary Indigenous reactions to modern binaries is an emphasis on a holistic view of the human condition in relation to the Creator and the creation, sometimes linked to the Hebrew construct of shalom and its rich meanings for wholeness beyond just abstract “peace.”[20] So, for example, Keetoowah Cherokee descendant Randy Woodley connects the Biblical concept of shalom to what he and many contemporary Native American tribes in North America summarize from their common stock of stories and values as the “Harmony Way.”[21] Similarly, contextual theology in Samoa draws on the concept of fa‘asamoa, the Samoan Way as a God-given culture.[22] Robin Wall Kimmerer, a professor of botany and a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, combines the scientific lens of studying nature with a potent sense of connection to the natural world from a variety of Native American tribal storehouses of knowledge.[23]\n\nIn the same vein, Native Hawaiians (Kānaka Maoli) are exploring the power of aloha for local and global transformations in how humans relate to the environment and one another, embodied in the Lökahi triangle integrating spiritual, natural, and communal dimensions.[24] In ‘Ölelo Hawai‘i, aloha is a rich word that means far more than its usual English translation, commercial misappropriations, and pop culture (ab)uses.[25] The development of kapu aloha (protected or sacred way of loving the ‘aina or land) on Mauna Kea in opposition to the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) embodies that worldview.[26] As one colleague summarized in response to the kia‘i, or protectors, of Mauna Kea: ‘Language is a repository of the political ontology of a people. If that is taken, much else can be easily taken as well. Yet, revitalized language can be a weapon of protection’.[27] Aloha and the Lökahi triangle speak to a deep rooted sense of connection between sacred landscapes and humans in ways that bypass the binary of pagan versus Christian imposed on Indigenous and other convert communities who not only absorbed but also transmuted the Christian mission to create their own Christianities.\n\nThat these same acculturation processes happened in the conversion of European people groups in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages seems to have been forgotten as that particular cultural formation of “Christianity” claimed both exclusivity and universality in global dominance. One way to restore and contextualize that history is to “reverbiage” our narratives recounting the emergence of various forms of Christianity in early medieval Britain.[28]\n\nThis sensitivity to language in relation to a sense of place also raises questions about what to call the historic place-times we study and write about. Recently I have taken to using the geographic insular term Britain instead of England. The Northumbria in which Aldred lived in the tenth century was a place of shifting political boundaries within and around the island of Britain. Even the island of Britain as a contiguous landmass defined by ocean boundaries somewhat deceptively implies a land-based territorial unity, when in fact connections across water often formed more easily than across diverse terrains within Britain. Thus regions of Britain north of the Humber from the Iron Age to the eleventh century interacted in a North Atlantic world stretching from Scandinavia to Ireland as much or more than they connected with southwest Britain with its cross-channel continental connections. English-speaking communities in tenth-century Northumbria existed in a historic web of cultural identities and influences from Irish, Scots, Cumbrian, and Scandinavian languages and practices, different from and even resistant to West Saxon hegemony. In the tenth century, the notion of a singular bordered “England” and a normative or homogenized “English” Christianity emanating from Wessex was not yet inevitable.[29] Rather than tracing the emergence and triumph of what becomes hegemonic, we should seek to understand the plurality of experiences and the contested nature of the cultural landscape.\n\nTo end on a positive note: Deconstruction may seem like a negative enterprise, not to mention messy, but it is necessary in order to move into the stage of writing new narratives. Post-colonial and post-secular theorists and Indigenous scholars are not advocating a wholesale rejection of modernity via a return to some imagined pristine Indigenous or pre-modern culture, but are exposing the unstated philosophical assumptions undergirding western modernity and its globalization. In resisting the body-soul, secular-spiritual binaries, these holistic visions emphasize new ways of living and being that may sound impossibly utopian. But the human desire for a better world than the ones we have made drives most cosmologies and theologies across cultures, so should not be dismissed out of hand in favor of a modern western utilitarianism or pseudo-scientist materialism in our search for understanding the human condition through the study of the past.\n\nWhile drawing our attention to many of the dystopian fractures in early medieval Britain, Catherine Karkov offers an updated “eutopia” for our contemplation:\n\na happy place that can be realised—that would be a place in which diversity, compassion, and inclusion are vital operating methods. Eutopia, like utopia, is in opposition to the world as it is and holds out the possibility of real change. [30]\n\nThis happy place, for scholars and other post-modern humans, is an invitation to enter into a new set of scholarly and personal relationships. It may be at times uncomfortable or disconcerting, especially when we recognize the power differentials between those of us with certain privileges and those who are in vulnerable positions. Developing kinships requires compassion and forgiveness, and will take time and patience to reach fruition.\n\n[1] On post-secular theory, see Charly Coleman, “Review Article Resacralizing the World: The Fate of Secularization in Enlightenment Historiography,” The Journal of Modern History 82 (June 2010): 368–95; David Hanlon, “Losing Oceania to the Pacific and the World,” The Contemporary Pacific 29 (2017): 286–318 on Indigenous historiographies and “Deep Time”; and Karen Louise Jolly, ‘Anglo-Saxons on Exhibit: Displaying the Sacred’, in Jolly and Brooks (eds), Global Perspectives, forthcoming.\n\n[2] Tarren Andrews and Tiffany Beechy, eds, Indigenous Futures and Medieval Pasts, English Language Notes 58.2 (2020), Introduction (pp. 1-17).

Escobar in writing about Epistemologies of the South contrasts a western dualistic political One-World World ontology with relational, holistic ontologies among Indigenous communities.\n\n[7] See Philip Jenkins, The Next Christendom: Rise of Global Christianity, 3rd edn (New York, 2011; orig. 2002); and Randy S.
