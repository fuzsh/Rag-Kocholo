        "text": "External News\n\n9 January 2020\n\nNorthumbria University had the biggest rise in research power of any university following the results of the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF2014). To strengthen our world-leading research, we are further investing in the development of research that meets the emerging industrial and social challenges of our times. We are seeking to appoint a research fellow to join our School of Design, who will engage in developing, conducting, and leading collaborative and multi-disciplinary design research.\n\nWith this appointment, we are particularly interested in applicants with research expertise that build on and extend Northumbria School of Design’s world-leading reputation for research in interaction and physical-digital design, digital craft, strategic design-led innovation, fashion or industrial design. We have ongoing research programmes focused on the creation of artefacts, services and experiences related to ageing, health, wellbeing, environmental sustainability, and global development, and a vibrant community of researchers engaged in methodological innovation and practice-led research. We seek to build on these existing research strengths and through these posts grow our capabilities around critically-aware design research that is engaged with emerging technological, social, cultural and political concerns, and speaks to the UK’s industrial strategy and proprieties of research funders.\n\nThe successful applicants will develop their independent research agenda, engage in and lead research bidding activity, and publish in world-leading forums for disseminating design research. Through these posts, they will be based in an environment and provided the opportunities to develop into a future research leader in the design discipline.\n\nThe successful candidate will hold a PhD or equivalent, and will already be developing a publication track record of exceptional quality. Excellent written and verbal communication skills are essential, as is the ability to demonstrate some relevant teaching experience, the ability to work effectively with colleagues, and the potential to attract external funding to support the future development of your research. Although the role will allow the successful candidate to concentrate on developing their personal research agenda as well as collaborative projects, you should be prepared to take on a small amount of teaching and administration over the course of the fellowship. After the first three years you will progress as a Lecturer or Senior Lecturer in the School of Design.\n\nYou must have outstanding research outputs and clear research plans for the future including around grant capture. You will utilise this expertise to deliver outstanding research informed teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.\n\nFor informal enquiries about this post please contact: Professor John Vines, Professor of Design and Director of Research and Innovation in the School of Design john.vines@northumbria.ac.uk\n\nThe deadline is on the 19th January"
