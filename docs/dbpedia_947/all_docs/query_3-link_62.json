        "text": "Background\n\nI am cultural historian of the modern United States. I studied American Studies at King’s College, London, before completing my MA at the University of Manchester. Continuing my journey north, I completed my PhD at Northumbria University, where I also taught modules in American history, British culture, and academic skills. I then taught American and Transatlantic history at Teesside University, before joining Edinburgh in January 2017.\n\nResponsibilities & affiliations\n\nConference Secretary: HOTCUS, Historians of the Twentieth Century United States\n\nCo-founder: The Precarity Project, funded by a British Association for American Studies/US Embassy Grantv\n\nResearch summary\n\nPlaces:\n\nNorth America\n\nPeriods:\n\nTwentieth Century & After\n\nResearch interests\n\nI teach late 19th and 20th century American history, with a focus on issues of race, class, gender, and religion.\n\nMy research mostly focuses on the African American civil rights movement and responses to it in political and popular culture. I am particularly interested in its intersections with cinema, both through representation of the movement onscreen and the physical space of the segregated cinema before 1964. My PhD research examined the representation of southern religion in civil rights cinema, and the implications this has for public memory of the movement and national understanding of the South. This research led to published chapters on films such as Selma, The Help, and Mississippi Burning, and a forthcoming monograph, Southern by the Grace of God: Religion, Race, and Civil Rights in Hollywood's American South (November 2024) with University of Georgia Press\n\nBeyond my immediate research areas, I have published an article exploring how Martin Luther King, Jr. is taught in British schools. This research contributes to a growing body of work about King as a global figure, and hopes to encourage a more detailed examination of Transatlantic exchange and solidarity during the long freedom struggle. A collaboration with colleagues from Newcastle and Northumbria Universities, this project has led to the publication of a free teaching resource pack. I have also developed school assembly plans for Black History Month 2019, that encourage teachers and students to reflect on links between American and British anti-racism movements.\n\nCurrent research interests\n\nMore recent research explores segregated cinema-going in Birmingham, Alabama, prior to and during the civil rights campaigns of April 1963. In particular, I have examined intersecting events from April 1963, most notably, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s ‘Project C’ and the Alabama premiere of To Kill a Mockingbird. An article on this topic was published in the Alabama Review in 2023.\n\nKnowledge exchange\n\nMartin Luther King in the UK: https://research.ncl.ac.uk/martinlutherking/activities/mlkinuk/\n\nAffiliated research centres\n\nCentre for the Study of Modern and Contemporary History\n\nEditor and Introduction: '2020 and the Urgent Past,' Comparative American Studies: An International Journal, Vol. 17, Iss. 3-4 (2020).\n\nChapters & Articles:\n\n“Boutwell, Bull, and Birmingham: To Kill a Mockingbird and Racial Moderation in Alabama’s Magic City”, Alabama Review, Vol. 76, No. 1 (January 2023), 11-46.\n\n'“He Was Shot because America Will Not Give Up on Racism”: Martin Luther King Jr. and the African American Civil Rights Movement in British Schools.'
