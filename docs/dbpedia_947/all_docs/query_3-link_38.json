        "text": "by Jacob Vesey, Jake Barber and Tom Lynn\n\nSt James’ Park is a historic stadium and a landmark of the north east that today, is home to Newcastle United Football Club. The origins of the stadium can be traced all the way back to 1542 when the master of St Mary’s and St James’ granted a lease of land extending all the way to Castle Leazes. [1] The famed Gallowgate end has a history that, as the name suggest, stands in the place of the infamous Newcastle city gallows. Last used in 1863 to hang 19-year-old George Vass for the crime of murder.[2] Newcastle in the 18thand 19thcenturies was predominately working class with it being a hub for work such as shipbuilding, engineering and the iron industry. As the North East was industrialising, Newcastle developed a strong sense of regional identity as pointed out by Sheldon, and the introduction of Newcastle United brought these working-class people together and not only developed a sense of identity but gave them a common interest and passion, uniting the city. [3] By the End of the 19thcentury, St James Park was becoming a landmark for the city and an important part of many people’s lives. In 1892, the local clubs of Newcastle East End FC and Newcastle West End FC merged to become Newcastle United, who took up residence at St James’ Park and have remained there ever since, celebrating their 125th anniversary in 2017. The first football to be played here however was in 1880 by the Newcastle Rangers, the predecessors to Newcastle West End, 4 years before they folded in 1884.Newcastle United are synonymous today with their black and white kit, giving them the nickname the magpies but interestingly, the team played in red and white stripes until 1904 when the new kit was introduced. In 1899, the first major works of construction took place upgrading the already impressive 30,000 capacity to an enormous 60,000.\n\nWith these brand new renovations added to the stadium, Club Historian, [4]Paul Joannaou states in reference that many of the changes would give Newcastle United FC a ‘new status’, and ensure that the clubs new found professional status would appeal to the masses and be reflected externally. Following some scouting of other football teams’ stadiums for inspiration in order to remodel St James’ Park in 1905, the stadium would progressively be redesigned by the architect Archibald Leitch around 1926, in which the aforementioned capacity would reach around 60,000 people. This increase in capacity would actually be beneficial and almost perfectly timed, for around this time the club would begin its initial title-winning era. [5]Around the time of the First World War, the stadium would act as an impromptu military base over the duration, and would thankfully suffer no damage from German air raids; however, it would suffer some minor wear and tear as a result of its military occupation. Post-war, the stadium would receive upgrades and repairs on the Leazes’ end, including a new roof canopy and floodlights. Moreover, in 1966 St James’ Park was one of the lucky few chosen to act as host stadiums for the World Cup but due to historic and consistent lease issues and expirations, FIFA (The Fédération Internationale de Football Association) withdrew their intention application. Furthermore, due to this one of many lease issues over the years, the club’s future was uncertain in St James’ Park and there was even plans to relocate it to central Gosforth, another town in the immediate area. However, both officials of the clubs and representatives from the Council were able to work out a plan to ensure consistent income and ensure that the Club and Stadium were both sustainable and financial ventures; this was done through the addition of cantilevered stands and stalls etc. throughout the stadiums.\n\nIn current year, the stadium provides a safe haven for a massive amount of people within the community as it creates a place where everyone feels equal under one roof supporting the same team. With a large Asian community being on the doorstep of the stadium a large portion of supporters come from different backgrounds to others and won’t necessarily all have a similar background, but all share the same support for their team. [6]The supporters and team also support those who come from a less fortunate background with the foundation they set up in 2008 to help the younger generation from these less wealthy backgrounds get them into “a wide range of sports, health and educational projects.” The acceptance and integration of other groups within a community shows off the acceptance of others but creates a greater sense of comradery within such a diverse community. This sense of community and comradery has been the focus of the team recently as many groups within the fans have “joined forces to call on fans to boycott St James’ Park in protest at Mike Ashley’s ownership of the club” this is due to the lack of support from their owner. However, this shows off how grouped together the fans are in the support of one another and the support of their team by trying to get a better owner to run their team and stadium. When looking at the gender aspects it can be seen that club has attempted to reduce the gender pay gap[7] as much as possible to create a more equal environment for everyone to work in. although not many females hold jobs such as managers they’ve reduced the pay gap by [2]“0.9%” in 2019 in attempts to create an equal environment. Overall, with the addition of player and managers annual and consistent wages it can be seen that the pay gap is still there as there are no female players on the squad, and even there being a completely separate team and a league for women, much like the rest of the countries’ teams, despite all of the equal gender rights being entrenched and now common place within society.\n\nBibliography:\n\n[1]“History of Our Home.” Newcastle United Football Club.

In this time, Grey was a key figure in campaigning for parliamentary reform throughout England. Arguably, his most notable achievement during his time as Prime Minister is the passing of the Great Reform Act. The Reform Act did many things for the modernisation of the English electoral system; it extended the franchise, changed the criteria that needed to be met in order to qualify for the vote and also made the electoral system much more proportional and representative. Due to Grey’s role in this monumental parliamentary act, a monument was erected in his honour that now stands in the middle of Newcastle city centre.\n\nGrey’s monument is a Grade I listed monument that was erected to honour Prime Minister Charles Grey for his role in the passage of the Great Reform Act of 1832. The monument consists of a 130 ft high column and a statue of Grey on top. The column was designed by local architects John and Benjamin Green, a father and son duo who also designed other key pieces of architecture in Newcastle such as The Theatre Royal and the Lit and Phil society. The statue itself was designed and created by Edward Hodges Baily, a sculptor from Bristol who also created the statue of Nelson that stands in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe Reform Act itself did many things for the political modernisation of Britain. The Act extended the franchise from 400,000 to around 650,000. This extension included a whole new group of people in the electorate. So many people were given the franchise because Grey’s government amended the qualifications needed to be met to qualify for the vote. Men over the age of 21 who owned property or paid more than £10 a year in rent were able to qualify for the vote, this meant that people such as shopkeepers, small landowners and tenant farmers now had the vote.\n\nParliamentary reform was long sought after, with Charles Grey advocating for more votes since the foundation of the Society of the Friends of the People in 1792. Although multiple attempts had been made to pass the act there was frequent dismissal from the House of Lords. For example in 1831 the House of Commons passed the reform act only for it to be stopped by the Lords. This was partially because the House of Lords feared revolution if lower and middle class people were enfranchised. This fear of reform and revolution ultimately led to the Bill passing in 1832 as the riots of the previous year in major cities such as London, Nottingham, Exeter, Birmingham and especially Bristol had demonstrated the public’s demand for representation.\n\nWhile it was a great advancement for men it was a major hindrance to women’s suffrage as The Reform Act limited the vote to “male persons” creating the first official obstacle to women’s voting. The Reform act, although extremely significant, did not go far enough for the working class as the vast majority were still unable to vote due to monetary limitations. The 1850’s saw the rise of the Chartists and their campaign for the vote however the parliamentary elite were still reluctant to make major changes to the franchise rejecting the “one man, one vote” ideology.\n\nAs it currently stands, Grey’s Monument is a Grade I Listed Building. For this reason, Grey’s Monument cannot be demolished, extended, or altered without planning permission. This is because of the historical and architectural importance of the monument to the city of Newcastle. Further restrictions surrounding the monument were implemented with the Planning Act of 1990, which reinforced laws surrounding the granting of planning permissions especially when Listed Buildings are concerned.\n\nDuring the construction of the Tyne and Wear Metro system in 1977, special care was taken to ensure the column of the monument was stable. A 40-foot column was built directly underneath the existing column in order to stabilise and preserve the landmark. Grey’s Monument’s status as a Listed Building, as well as the care that goes into preserving the monument, demonstrates the landmark’s importance to the city of Newcastle. The monument is viewed as a piece of history that should be protected and acknowledged even nearly 200 years later.\n\nToday Grey’s Monument marks a major centrepiece in Newcastle with the surrounding area of the Monument and Grainger Town being a very popular area for the public. This is largely due to the Monument being referred to as the retail centre of Newcastle. The abundance of retail outlets and restaurants draw crowds of shoppers to this area of Newcastle in particular. The area surrounding the monument also hosts regular markets, including Newcastle’s Christmas market. Due to the monument’s central location, performers especially buskers and musicians are attracted to the location. They themselves draw crowds who often choose to rest on the steps leading up to the monument and enjoy the local entertainment. One of its most well-known uses is for gathering activists and protesters. More recently the monument has become a popular host for climate change protesters in the wake of the climate crisis. For this reason, Grey’s Monument is often regarded as Newcastle’s equivalent of Speakers’ Corner in Hyde Park, London – a popular and traditional location for public speeches and debates.\n\nGrey’s Monument and the surrounding area does not just act as a popular shopping destination or busking spot. The monument’s history also attracts tourists and locals. Newcastle City Guides offers the public an insight into the history of the monument and the surrounding area. A guided tour and commentary highlight the historical importance of Newcastle with the main focus being the monument, Lord Grey, and the passage of the Reform Act in 1832. The most attractive aspect of the tour is the opportunity to climb the monuments 164 steps to the top of the column where views of Monument and Grainger Town can be observed. These tours are available from March to October and have previously proven very popular with the majority of events selling out in advance.\n\nSince the erection of Grey’s Monument the landmark has been decorated to celebrate different events. For example, in 1906 the monument was decorated for the visit of King Edward VII to Newcastle and again in 1937 to celebrate the coronation of King George VI. More recently the monument has been decorated for events such as Pride, International Women’s Day, and as part of the Great Exhibition of the North.\n\nBibliography\n\nCarlson, John and Carlson, Joyce, Newcastle Through Time (Stroud: Amberley Publishing Limited, 2009).; Earl Grey Monument https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1329931 Date Accessed: 5th March 2020.\n\nEarl Grey Monument https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1329931 Date Accessed: 5th March 2020.\n\nFuller, Mike, ‘Why was Grey’s Monument in Newcastle dressed in hundreds of pairs of knickers today?’, Chronicle Live, Written 8/03/18 https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/greys-monument-newcastle-dressed-hundreds-14386352 Date Accessed: 8th March 2020; The Worker’s Maypole https://getnorth2018.com/previous-events/the-workers-maypole/ Date Accessed: 8th March 2020.\n\nHall, Gemma, ‘Slow Northumberland and Durham: Including Newcastle, Hadrian’s Wall and the Coast’ (Chalfont St. Peter: Bradt Travel Guides, 2012).\n\nHolland, Daniel, ‘Hundreds of children to join ‘most important’ climate strike protest on Friday’, Chronicle Live, Written 27/11/19 https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-climate-strike-general-election-17324880 Date Accessed: 5th March 2020.\n\nListed Buildings https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/services/planning-building-and-development/historic-enviornment-and-urban-design/listed-buildings Date Accessed: 5th March 2020.\n\nMorton, David, ‘18 things You Probably Never Knew about Newcastle’s Magnificent Grey’s Monument’, Chronicle Live, Written 6/09/17 https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/18-things-you-probably-never-13578771 Date Accessed: 8th March 2020.\n\nMeechan, Simon, ‘Grey’s Monument to be decorated with red pompoms to raise awareness of period poverty and stigma’, Chronicle Live, Written 1/02/19 https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/pompom-womens-day-newcastle-monument-15767147 Date Accessed: 8th March 2020.\n\nOldfield, Lesley, ‘Newcastle Pride 2018 in 100 joyful images of the parade & festival’, Chronicle Live, Written 21/06/18 https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/newcastle-pride-2018-100-joyful-14937311 Date Accessed: 8th March 2020.\n\nThe British Library – “The 1832 Reform Act.” The British Library. http://www.bl.uk/copyrightstatement.html, April 2, 2009.

This landmark, originally the site of a Roman Fort built around 122 AD called Pons Aelius (loosely translates to ‘Hadrian’s Fort’) which was set to defend the Roman Bridge over the river Tyne and the northern Roman border of Hadrian’s Wall.[1] It was also notably the location of an Anglo Saxon Church built 800AD, the outline of which can be found in the foundations of the castle that stands today.[2] The castle itself was built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, as he was sent north to regain control of Cumbria and Northumberland from the Scots who claimed the region during the Norman conquest of England.[3] The castle was built to work with its sister castles in Warkworth, Durham, York and Carlisle to secure the North of the realm from any more incursions.[4] It also established Norman control and authority over the people, as well as protecting the Roman Bridge over the Tyne, which was still the main crossing point used at the time.[5] The castle also became a financial hub, leading to people settling in the castle walls and around the castle, leading to the growth of the town that took its name and still stands today: ‘New-Castle’ or Newcastle.[6]\n\nImprovements to the castle were continued to be made as the old ‘motte and bailey’ was no longer doing justice to the significance the castle now had for the region at the time, being replaced by a stone keep constructed by Henry II in 1168 and completed in 1178 which still stands today.[7] The last major improvement to be made was the ‘Barbican’, or gatehouse built in 1250 which has grown to be known as the ‘Black Gate’ by locals.[8]\n\nThe uses of Newcastle Castle varied greatly over time and vastly changed from its conception in 1080, to modern day. In 1080, “the building of Newcastle helped to secure Norman rule over the North of England and to secure Norman rule over the north of England and controlled the Norman bridge which was still the main crossing of the Tyne”.[9] This was after “revolt spread and rebels were joined by Edgar the Aethling, the Saxon claimant to the crown.”[10] This may have convinced William that a castle was required to defend the region. “It formed a good defended location for people to live and trade. This led to the growth of the town around it which took its name from the castle.”[11] This is supported by the fact that “they (houses) were most numerous of all down by the riverside and the Bridge end or around the castle”.[12]\n\nThe castle was also used by the people of Newcastle for protection. As argued by Middlebrook, “townsfolk would crowd into the bailey with valuables and stock”. [13]\n\nThe castle was also used to defend the region and the country against the scots, as part of the eastern route from Scotland to England along with castles in Warkworth and Durham in the East”. Notably, as stated in Newcastle Castle tourist information “in 1297” after “the English army was defeated by William Wallace” and “knew that Scottish raids would follow”, “the sheriff…was instructed to prepare the castle for war”.[14]\n\nThe castle could be perceived as important to the people of the region for some time because in 1295, “the inhabitants of Northumberland fled to Newcastle ”, where ‘100,000 men’ ‘appeared’ to defend ‘Newcastle’.[15] This could suggest that the castle was attractive to the people of the region as an effectively defended place.\n\nAs time progressed and the castle’s regional significance declined, the castle fell into disrepair. By 1529 the castle was in a state of dilapidation due to this. The castle came into brief use again with the beginning of the English civil war. The castle was refortified with an artillery bastion and was besieged by the scots until the castle surrendered on the 19th October 1664. This was the last time the castle was used as a military installation signifying the true decline in the regional significance of the castle. As Newcastle lost the need for the castle alternative roles were assigned to the various areas. For example it was used as a prison for some time. The ground floor was used as an ice house due to its cold properties. The chapel became a beer cellar for the Three Bulls’ Heads public house by the 1780s and in 1782 the castle was advertised as a windmill. From this it can be concluded that the castle’s regional significance declined continuously as time progressed through the late medieval and early modern period.\n\nThe castle’s decline of importance and relevance in the early modern period continued up to this very day. The redundancy that all medieval castles still standing today share is primarily due to the lack of civil war within the country and the overall progression of warfare through technological advancements, such as gunpowder. Newcastle’s castle is no exception; with peace made between England and Scotland to finally secure peace in the United Kingdom, Britain’s new focus on expansion and empire set the scene for the next four three centuries of warfare, a theatre of war that would not require military fortresses at home. Furthermore, the dissolution of England’s feudal system means that any non-military use the castle may have had remaining in housing lords, ladies and other gentry has also dissolved. Today, the castle serves primarily as a tourist and public attraction, as it has for the last century. Additionally, the castle can also be hired for conventional purposes such as weddings and parties, however such services have been available since the turn of the seventeenth-century under James I attempts to appease the Scots in unification. Since the early nineteen-hundreds, the local councils of Newcastle have also attempted to restore the castle to its original condition in order to make it a more appealing tourist attraction. Although the castle was once the cornerstone of the city and an integral part of the region, its appearance and value as a historic tourist attraction today is greatly unsung. Many citizens of Newcastle are unaware of the castle’s importance and even fewer tourists or visitors know of its existence.\n\n[1] Newcastle castle website http://www.newcastlecastle.co.uk/\n\n[2] Ibid.\n\n[3] Ibid.\n\n[4] Newcastle Castle Tourist information.\n\n[5] Newcastle castle website http://www.newcastlecastle.co.uk/\n\n[6] Ibid.\n\n[7] Ibid.\n\n[8] Newcastle Castle Tourist information.\n\n[9] Newcastle castle website http://www.newcastlecastle.co.uk/\n\n[10] Harrison, F, A history of Newcastle Upon-Tyne second edition (UK:Hewitt and Rudge LTD, 1913), p.19.\n\n[11] Newcastle castle website http://www.newcastlecastle.co.uk/\n\n[12] Middlebrook, S, Newcastle Upon-Tyne Its Growth and Achievement, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Newcastle Journal and North Mail, 1950), p.32.\n\n[13] Ibid p.21.\n\n[14] Newcastle Castle Tourist information.\n\n[15] Harrison, F, A history of Newcastle Upon-Tyne second edition (UK: Hewitt and Rudge LTD, 1913), p.30.\n\nBibliography\n\nCharleton, R.

Specifically looking at the role of race and region involved with it. Hadrian’s wall spanned across England coast to coast. Spanning 73 miles, Hadrian’s wall was used to mark the borders of the holy roman empire.[1] Unsurprisingly, a lot of the wall has failed to survive the last 2000 years. Only around 10% of the wall is to be seen today.[2] Some of the details about the wall include, there was to be a mile castle every roman mile (approximately 1481 metres), I’m sure we have all heard of the mile castle near the train station.[3] Although, this wasn’t a mile castle during the construction of the wall however it was closely located to the remains of a mile castle. Thus, the history of Hadrian’s wall continues to be prevalent in modern society.\n\nLooking at the issue of region, Hadrian himself claimed that the purpose of the wall was to separate romans from the barbarians in Scotland. This was to protect the roman citizens from the Caledonians. Although, there is a common misconception that Hadrian’s wall acted as a border between England and Scotland. In fact, it has never acted as this and in fact the wall predates the creation of either kingdom. However, the wall was a small component in the protection of the holy roman empire. The walls intensive purpose was to control net migration into the holy roman empire and to restrict the flow of contraband. The roman frontier did so with relative success. Moving forwards, another aspect regarding Hadrian’s wall and the issues of race is that the romans used native (British slaves) to construct the wall. Local people were believed to be inferior to the roman legionnaires. Hence, they were used as cheap expendable labour in the construction process.\n\nHadrian’s wall has a critical historical influence on race and culture in Newcastle and the surrounding areas. Plaques dotted around the city help us to understand how close we are to the archaeology of Hadrian’s wall. For example, the plaque situated on the same street as the ‘Mile Castle’ Wetherspoons marks the discovery of the South West corner of a milecastle (fortified gate) in 1985, subsequently giving the pub its name. Wallsend and Byker are examples of places in Newcastle that were most affected, mainly because of the proximity and strategic importance. Wallsend, evidently by the name, was where the easternmost point of the wall stood, which situated a Roman fort called Segedunum and was a garrison for over 200 years.[4] This highlights the affect Hadrian’s wall has had on the area of Newcastle. Other areas of Newcastle that derive their name from the Roman monument can be seen from Wall Bottle, Heddon-on-the-wall, Wall houses and Shields-on the Wall to name a few.[5]\n\nArchaeologists have studied the Wall’s further impact on early settlements and the surrounding societies, notably in the 1960s, leading to conclusions that indigenous settlements continued to flourish under a Pax Romana, attaining a final and most developed form under Roman rule.[6] Therefore, it can be argued that roman influence was a positive for the different races of Newcastle. Indigenous people benefitted from the peace, markets and communications that the Roman military presence offered.[7]\n\nHowever, the inherently oppressive and racist Roman regime that erected the monument, can be seen to have underlying negative effects on the local communities not only surrounding the wall, but across the whole of Roman Britain. The purpose of the Wall was to control the migration of people to or from Roman Britain, excluding Scottish Picts tribes in the North and therefore naturally, the wall was a tool of oppression and control. For American Poet and historian W.H Auden, Hadrian’s wall is a ‘symbol for a certain imperialistic concept of life’, which is an idea that corroborates to the medieval society at the time, that was rife with class oppression and discrimination throughout the whole system.[8]\n\nAnother argument is that people only support the idea of the wall being inclusive and tolerant so that the monument becomes more palatable as a World Heritage Site.[9] The wall is a very popular attraction in the U.K and helps surrounding areas thrive and gain revenue, so pushing this idea would be beneficial for business. Nevertheless, this view should not take away from the cultural importance that Hadrian’s wall has for our country and the rest of the world. Helping us to understand our heritage and origins, regardless of the ideology of the Roman empire.\n\nHadrian’s wall was built by 15,000 men across six years[10] to close off and define the Roman Empire’s borders as Emperor Hadrian looked to “keep the poorer barbarians of ancient Scotland from invading the civilized and more prosperous empire”.[11] The racial undertones to the construction of the wall is evident as the wall has been designed to ensure that the “poorer barbarians” don’t tarnish the prosperity of the Roman Empire. Moreover, Hadrian himself said that it was “to separate the Romans from the barbarians” therefore further demonstrating how fundamental a part race played in the construction of the wall as Hadrian himself wanted the total separation of the Caledonians in the north away from the Roman Empire.[12] This racism can be seen in the artwork (right) whereby the Romans are coordinating the construction whilst the slaves do the work.[13]In addition to this, Hodgson states that the wall stresses “cultural division or separation”[14] which further demonstrates how the wall separated two very different races. Race again can be seen with the construction of the walls as the legionaries didn’t build it alone, they used “native peoples from certain parts of the province were used as labourers, providers of material, or as forced levies”.[15] The importance of race here is also evident as the forced labour of the people, effectively slave labour, further highlights the racial tones within the construction and idea behind Hadrian’s wall. Therefore, race played a fundamental role in the construction of Hadrian’s wall as the wall was built to keep the Caledonian barbarians out of the Roman Empire, so that the prosperity of the Roman Empire wasn’t plagued with.\n\n[1] The Historians Craft, ‘Hadrian’s wall: How and Why was it built’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aJK5jrpezw.

Its work served mostly to improve the industry and life of working class people, and were able to achieve this through its membership.\n\nThe subscription fee to the Lit & Phil was capped to 1 guinea; the entrance fees, however, were not and could cost up to 25 guineas in times of economic boom.[1] This restricted entrance to the ‘well to do’ and kept out ‘riff raff’. It suggested that more money meant a higher intellect. The rising economy, however, meant that the ‘newly rich’ from the working class could present ideas which came from a working class culture.\n\nTo illustrate this point of upper class dominance, some early members of the Lit & Phil included George J. Fenwick, Banker and Landowner of Pelton and Craghead, and Sir James Bart Joicey, a Morpeth MP.[2]\n\nAs we see, earlier in its life the Lit & Phil certainly had a lot of class exclusivity. Later we see that more and more members included people from working class backgrounds. This included people such as George Stephenson, the de facto inventor of the miner’s safety lamp, and Thomas Bewick, who focused on wood block printing and artwork.\n\nTo present an idea at the Lit & Phil a paper on the subject needed to be approved by three members of the society’s committee.[3] This suggests a need for literacy (although George Stephenson was a notable exception) as well as being well educated, meaning that presentations were near exclusive to members of the upper and middle class.\n\nThe early years of the society included discussion of more frivolous issues, such as a lecture on the Cultivation of Taste, coming from an upper class perspective.[4] Such discussions suggest that earlier members weren’t chiefly focused on lower class concerns.\n\nHowever, in later years scientific ideas took priority. Most papers focused on mining from then onward, suggesting a keen interest in the economy of the local working class.[5] Further, the Lit & Phil served as an intermediate between local industrial businesses and inventors. Matthew Boulton was famously asked by the society to implement the steam engine within the Coal Works.[6] Again this suggests that the betterment of the local economy, dominated by the working class, was at the forefront of the minds of the upper class membership.\n\nNext we will discuss a few innovative members of the Lit & Phil and their accomplishments.\n\nThe miner’s lamp was a significant development for the region. The North East was a mining and industrial region, plagued by lighting induced mining disasters. Stephenson was born into a working class family, who were illiterate, in 1781. While his background is certainly lower class, his development of the miner’s lamp was not halted. Inspired by disasters in 1806,1809 and 1812, by 1815 he had a prototype which was successfully tested in front of two witnesses in Bob’s Pit mine, Killingworth.[7] [8]\n\nNear the same time Humphry Davy, later president of the Royal Society, began work on his own lamp. Davy presented his lamp to the Royal Society a month before Stephenson presented his in the Lit & Phil. After Stephenson presented his design, similarities between the two were noticed immediately. While the designs were not identical, because of the timeframe of the presentations Stephenson was accused of stealing Davy’s design.[9] However, numerous witnesses and documents were used to state that there was no way that Stephenson could have stolen Davy’s design; the two never met.\n\nMany employers and miners preferred Stephenson’s lamp to Davy’s for one main reason; it didn’t explode. The replacement of the metal mesh with glass, and added holes on the bottom and around the lamp, ensured it did not overheat.[10] This fiasco revealed a classist attitude in Davy. He couldn’t accept that a working class man could produce a better lamp than him.[11] Davy sent letters to Stephenson’s accomplices, stating his outrage with their stance. One recipient, the Earl of Strathmore, replied to Davy’s letter stating that he didn’t care for Stephnenson’s background, only his merits.[12]\n\nThomas Bewick was born in Northumberland to a rural tenant farming family, bringing to the Society a non-industrial, lower class perspective. Bewick was renowned for his revolutions in wood block artwork and printing. He made changes to the way in which wood prints were printed by changing the materials used to a thinner, cheaper wood so that it was more affordable to print artwork.[13] This meant that illustrated books could be sold cheaper, meaning those of the lower classes could buy these books and broaden their perspectives through art, at this point a usually middle and upper class pleasure. However, Bewick’s most famous work, Quadrupeds and Birds, had prints of a quality so high only the rich could afford to buy it, so there was still a great degree of exclusivity in natural studies and art meaning that the poor were again from high culture.[14]\n\nThe Lit & Phil also served as a natural museum, buying many stuffed birds and these collections greatly influenced Bewick’s watercolour work.[15] These watercolours were predominantly sold to a gallery in Bond Street, suggesting that Bewick’s work was by the middle class for the middle class, excluding again the working class from high culture.[16] But these sales to Bond Street also served to give the Lit & Phil, as well as the Newcastle area, more prestige and spread its influence beyond the North East to a nationwide audience.\n\nBewick also made art prints of Stephen Kemble, an actor of the Theatre Royal, for show tickets. This shows Bewick’s works to also be of a more frivolous nature, catered toward a middle and upper class theatre-going audience.[17]\n\nFrom Bewick’s work we can see that the Lit & Phil weren’t necessarily entirely working in the realm of furthering the industries of the local working class, but rather they also catered to more artistic endeavors that benefited the upper classes near exclusively.\n\nAs has been shown most of the work of the Lit & Phil was of a scientific nature, focused on the betterment of the local working class economy and industry. It also served as a pillar of engineering and natural science in not only the Northeast but nationally as well. To finish however, it certainly remained an institution led by the upper class for the benefits of the upper class even if only to a small degree by means such as poems, novels or other literature.\n\n[1] Charles Parish, The History of the Lit & Phil Vol. 2, 1896-1989 (Newcastle: The Literary & Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, 1999), p. 9.\n\n[2] Robert Spence Watson, The History of the Literary & Philosophical Society 1793-1896 Vol. 1 (London: Walter Scott Ltd, 1897), p. ii.\n\n[3] Ibid., p. 135.\n\n[4] Ibid.\n\n[5] Ibid., pp. 139-140.\n\n[6] Ibid., p. 141.\n\n[7] Hunter Davies, A Biographical Study of the Father of Railways (London: Weidenfield and Nicolson, 1975), p. 21.\n\n[8] L.T.C.

The bridge itself was opened by King George V in 1928; demonstrating its importance to the region.[1] The bridge itself is known as a through arch bridge and is a Grade II listed building making the bridge a ‘particularly important building of more than special interest.’[2]\n\nHistorically, the river Tyne’s strategic position between the South and Scotland has made it ripe for a river crossing. As early as the second century the Romans built the first recorded bridge over the Tyne to supply the fort of Pons Aelius; a fort on Hadrian’s Wall.[3] However, this isn’t the only historic bridge on the Tyne. In November 1771, “The Great Flood” occurred in which the Tyne swelled its’ banks and destroyed most of the half-dozen bridges on the Tyne; the few bridges that survived had an arch structure, inspiring future engineer John Carr.[4]\n\nIn the 1920s, the city was going through a painful post-war recession.[5] The rise in unemployment occurred during a ‘transport revolution’, in which trams and automobiles were gaining popularity; the march of progress was putting great strain on the city’s infrastructure and something had to be done.[6] So to hit two birds with one stone, T.M. Webster proposed for a new Tyne bridge in 1921.[7] Although, construction wouldn’t begin until 1925.\n\nDuring this time, the class element was strong in the North East. Of course, the North East was heavily influence by the working classes. The North East’s major industries of ship building and coal mining was in decline and Tyneside was in a biting recession.[8] The North East had the biggest Coal mine in Great Britain at the time and that was severely affected, the rate per shift in “the pits”, in 1926, was ‘half that in 1921.’[9] It was hoped that a new bridge on the Tyne would help relieve the unemployment issue by using both skilled and unskilled labour.[10] [11] That is why the Ministry of Transport was ready to offer to help but the land (£342,000) and offer 65% of funding for construction (£693,808), if construction could take place immediately.[12] The safety conditions for the workers were abysmal, there were no harnesses, and the workers were described as “Monkey Men” because of the way they leapt from structure to structure during construction.[13] However, it is remarkable, in such working conditions, that only one casualty was taken over the course of construction.[14]\n\nThe organisation of the construction effort was undertaken by the middle class. The contractors of the Tyne Bridge were also contractors of the Sydney Harbour Bridge at the same time. Sir Hugh Bell, who worked on the Tyne Bridge said, “This is regarded as a trial trip for the Sydney Harbour Bridge- and we are grateful for it.”[15] The chief architect of the project was Robert Burns Dick, who also built the Spanish City, in Whitley Bay, and the Liang Art Gallery in Newcastle. His design originally proposed a great gateway into Newcastle from the time, the predicted wealth from the bridge to build such an archway never materialised.[16] Mott, Hay and Anderson was the consulting firm which helped design the bridge. Very experienced, the firm built the Rolling Bridge and Trent bridge, and had experience building underground railways. However, bridge construction was a definite speciality.[17] Although a local and experience construction company, Armstrong Whitworth, offered a quote of £750,000-£800,000, a struggling Newcastle turned them down for a cheaper alternative.[18] The Middlesbrough based, Doorman Long & Co. was that cheaper alternative, offering a quote of £571,225. Their success in the Tyne gave them construction opportunities on the Sydney Harbour Bridge; making the Middle-call benefit quite a lot from this project.[19]\n\nFig.1 Photo of the Tyne Bridge by Joseph Kemp\n\nThere was also some upper-class involvement in the construction of the bridge. King George V opened the bridge in 1928 and made a speech, attended by the Queen-Consort and Lord Mayor of Newcastle, celebrating the completion of the project and praising the workers through the time of economic struggle.[20]\n\nToday the bridge is the defining landmark of the city The bridge has been used for many high-profile events, such as: the hanging of the biggest Olympic rings, in the country, to celebrate 2012; The annual Great North Run, the biggest half marathon in the UK, has the bridge on its route and, finally, in 2016, one of the bridge’s towers was used to host an illegal New Year’s Rave.[21] [22]\n\n[1] Stafford M.

The idea of building this new infirmary was suggested at an aging social club, the members were growing older and weren’t attracting new members.[1] This pushed them to create ‘a memorial of their past happy associations’.[2] It is speculated that it was the idea of a surgeon named Richard Lambert.[3] The infirmary began in Gallowgate House, only on a temporary basis whilst a new infirmary was being constructed on Forth Bank which opened in 1753 two years after the construction began.[4]\n\n[figure 1.1 – this shows the Royal Victoria Infirmary]\n\nThe infirmary was first expanded upon in 1803.[5] However, this expansion only added 15 new beds to the infirmary, but it saw further expansions in 1830, 1855 and lastly in 1885.[6]The 1855 expansion added the Dobson wing and with it 144 beds.[7] The final expansion allowed the hospital to accommodate a further 270 patients relieving the ever-growing pressure on the hospital.[8]\n\n[Figure 1.2- The Original Infirmary at Forthbanks – 1803]\n\nThis served to only delay the problematic effects as the surrounding area became increasingly more industrialised, leading to a decrease in sanitation and general conditions for patients, such as noise from the nearby railway. Due to these increasing issues it was replaced in 1906 by the RVI which was opened by King Edward VII. A total of £203,527was raised to build this new hospital in just a few years.[9] 1954 saw the end of the old infirmary as it was finally torn down.[10]\n\nThroughout its lifetime, the infirmary was most significant for the poor and working classes, this matches the general population of the region given that its main industries and sources of wealth at the time were coal mining and ship building. Something that would continue to be the case until Thatcher.\n\nThis meant that there wasn’t a great deal of wealth for the average worker meaning a relatively cheap method of health care was required. This can be seen when looking at the staff who worked there. During this time period the four physicians and two surgeons working at the infirmary were all unpaid volunteers.[11] A subscription of at least 1 guinea was required to access treatment at the infirmary – this was the equivalent of roughly 10 days wages for a skilled tradesman or £107. [12]\n\nFollowing 1887 the infirmary became a free service seeing the removal of the previous subscription policy.[13] Due to this change the infirmary was open to anyone who required treatment. The infirmary was used in 1834 by the school of medicine and surgery as a place to train new staff.[14] Northumbria’s Sutherland Building was part of the college and later became a dental school.[15] However, the school of medicine at large was later changed to the College of physical science in 1871.\n\n[Figure 1.3- Royal Victoria Infirmary]\n\nIn 1906 the new RVI opened and took over the care of all the previous patients that had been treated at Forth banks and that of any future patients.[16] At the inception of the NHS it was one of the 36 designated training hospitals.[17] In 1963 when Newcastle University was established. This took over the role of training people in medical professions in the RVI. Both the RVI and the university to this day are still closely tied together with the medical school being on the grounds of the RVI.\n\nThe running of the RVI throughout its history has included a variety of social classes. There is evidence that the governors of the hospital were nominated by people as low down as simple workmen.[18] Over the years the RVI has been expanded several times and taken on new roles that have made other hospitals in Newcastle redundant for example the Fleming Memorial Hospital was specialised for children’s health care.[19] In 1988 the care for sick children in Newcastle was transferred to the RVI however it wasn’t until 2010 that the Great North Children’s Hospital was built.\n\nThis was part of a major move to bring multiple aspects of health care under the banner of the RVI meaning that some more redundant hospitals in the city could be demolished. This also included the transfer of the maternity services from the Princess Mary Maternity Hospital.\n\nAs of 29th of May 2019 the Royal Victoria Infirmary was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission. The commission is an independent body that regulates the quality of health and social care. It was established by the Labour Government of Gordon Brown in 2009.The same report places the RVI in the top 100 hospitals in the UK. The Care Quality Commission has 66 hospitals ranked as outstanding. It also labelled the Freeman Hospital as one of these outstanding hospitals.

During the English Civil War (1642-1651), ships trading in Newcastle port dropped from 3000 to 200 while London suffered a “fuel famine”.[1]After the 1660 Restoration, the North East’s coal industry began to develop, most significantly with ‘Newcastle roads’ – an early form of railways. These were dirt tracks for transporting coal and mining equipment between the local collieries.[2] This demonstrates the growing relationship between coal mining and railways – including its impact on social class.\n\nBy the late-18th century, Newcomen’s atmospheric pumping engine (from 1721) and Watt and Boulton’s steam engine (from 1778) helped revolutionize coal mining and establish the shipbuilding industry.[3] From 1814, George Stephenson’s locomotive made coal transportation across the country easier”. By 1822, Hetton colliery was using Stephenson’s locomotives’, demonstrating the relationship between coal and railways.[4] However, safety remained very poor: in 1812, an explosion at Felling Colliery killed 92 miners.[5]\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, life for a typical working-class family in the North East allowed this poor region a new economic affluence due to high demands for coal. However, this pressure did not come without problems: overcrowded, sublet homes (with often one family to a room) were “hot-beds of infectious diseases”.[6] One example is an 1830s cholera epidemic: an article reveals that Newcastle and North Shields “lost 1,174 persons by cholera” in 1832.[7] The epidemic was due to poor working-class living conditions, no concept of ‘germ theory’, inaccessible toilets, and lack of clean water.[8] As Alan Ereira states, working conditions for miners consisted of long hours down the mines, especially for children where “small boys… were down the pit by three o’clock and did not return until after eight at night”.[9]\n\nThe formation of trade unions improved life for the working class. After various strikes by the United Association of Northumberland and Durham Miners (formed in 1830), 10% wage increase and a maximum of 12 hour working days for children in mines were achieved.[10] The Miner’s Association of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in 1843) was another union, where they demanded a four-day week and ten-hour days.[11] Strikes led by these trade unions collapsed because pit owners would not negotiate and the miners lacked support from other areas, such as Ireland and Cornwall.[12]However, the formation of the Northumberland Miners’ Association in 1864 allowed for a new relationship between the pit owners and the unions.[13] This union made sure “there had been very few strikes” by controlling its membership and reaching out to make agreements with the higher classes.[14]\n\nMost people in the middle class were typically pit-owners or businessmen heavily linked to the mines and collieries. Most would spend long periods of time in London – taking their wealth away from the local area and channeling it away from the North East’s economy. However, when the middle class were in the North East, they had a major role in the infrastructure and politics of the region.\n\nFirstly, there were several societies, the most significant of this is the Northumberland, Durham, and Tyneside Natural History Society (founded in 1838). This society discusses national politics and developed regional understanding about the history of the North East.[15] This revived interest in regional history established a romantic image of ‘Northumbria’: for example, Sir William Armstrong purchased and restored Bamburgh Castle in the mid-19th century.[16]\n\nAlthough Newcastle is not as populous as other industrial cities, the railway system developed from ‘Newcastle roads’ allowed many to visit the city centre. Middle class investments in the city dramatically impacted on its architecture: Blaydon, Fenwick, Grainger Market and Bainbridge of Newcastle are examples of this.[17] Grainger Market was the first to be architecturally designed as an indoor market while Bainbridge and Fenwick were one of the first ‘Parisian-style’ department stores.[18]\n\nBy 1918, the government struggled to provide ‘a country for heroes to live in’; prices doubled in 1919 and 35 million days were lost to strikes, with an average of 100,000 workers.[19] By 1925, the mine-owners announced they intended to reduce miner’s wages as a result of strikes.\n\nIn conclusion, we can see three areas where coal was vital to Newcastle and the North East. Firstly, it provided the region with an economic boost that lasted until the early-20th century. Secondly, the finance generated by coal funded geographical changes, such as the railways and city’s architecture. Finally, coal created class divisions in society, and this has a lasting impact into the 21st century.\n\n[1] F. J. C. Hearnshaw, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (Wakefield: S. R.

The lengthy and prosperous history provides many uses for the castle. There is a vast differentiation in class involved with the castle, from those who built it to those who were imprisoned within it.\n\nBefore The Castle, the land was used as a ‘Roman fort of Pons Aelius in the mid-second century.’[1] 800 years later The Castle was erected on ‘order of William the Conqueror by his son Robert de Curthose in 1088.’[2] It was also ‘significantly rebuilt by Henry II between 1168-78.’[3] The Castle was beneficial for many reasons such as ‘commanding the course of the Tyne and containing border irruption.’[4] The Castle had a ‘tower which was 82ft tall and walls that were 18ft thick.’[5] It remained in the gentry, when ‘passed onto Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, but was later taken by William II following a rebellion.’[6]In the 14th century, the town walls were built enclosing the castle, reducing the need for the structure, meaning it was ‘mainly used for civil purposes.’[7] The last time it was used for military advantage was in the ‘civil war, it acted as a royalist stronghold for Sir John Marley.’[8] It was used as a prison until further efforts of restoration were made in the 18th century. The class occupying the castle fluctuates over the years, due to the range of people involved in the building of the castle, occupying the castle and the imprisoned.\n\nWithin the walls of the castle, there were many different areas. Three key examples of these areas are; the church, tavern and Jail.\n\nIn terms of social class, the church is unique, as it accommodated to all social backgrounds. Before the printing press and the reformation of the church, the only way in which people could hear the word of God was through a Priest or Bishop.[9] However, once the bible could be easily accessed, the middle and upper classes were able to read the bible, but the lower class were unable to read, and would still need to attend church to hear the word of God. The Gaol (Jail) is another area of the Castle in which the middle and lower classes would interact. The two gaols were situated across the street from one another. The first was ‘The Great Pit’, and the second was ‘The Heron Pit’, named after the infamous 13th century Sheriff of Northumberland, William Heron.[10] The final area is the Tavern (beer shop or public house). In 1552, they become more prominent in the discussion of legislation, as the impact they were having on society became more noticeable. Edward IV restricted the number of taverns across the country, with Newcastle being limited to four.[11] The lower social class would be employed in them and food and drink could be purchased cheaply, but people in the middle class would occasionally visit.\n\nCriminals who were able to reach The Castle in the 1400s were out of the jurisdiction of the Sheriff and Mayor of Newcastle because Newcastle was an independent county through a charter by Henry VI. The Castle was not included in the charter; making it a sanctuary for criminals, until legislation was rectified 1589, meaning the authorities could enter the castle. In 1600 The Castle enabled independent tradesmen to produce and sell their products. The companies had exclusive rights to producing and selling items but because of the autonomy of Newcastle Castle, they had no power to exert authority. It can be assumed that Newcastle Castle had the regular jobs that any castle or fortification would have. When it was a roman fortification, soldiers would be stationed there along with when it was reused by the Normans as a Mott and Bailey castle. The strategic position of the castle (on the Tyne) meant it was primarily used as a military fortification although this changed in the medieval era. In 1216 King John gave power to merchants to elect mayors, which turned Newcastle and the Castle into a more economically focused area.\n\nIn the 13th Century, it was looked after by the Sheriff of Northumberland, William Heron, a harsh man who decided to exploit the poor.[12] As mentioned before this is whom the infamous “The Heron Pit” in the dungeon is named after. Over his time of being the keeper of the Castle, he managed to exploit many people under his protection through farming profits and taxes that he put on them. Although England in the 13th century was already in financial difficulties due to excessive overseas spending, Northumberland citizens had to pay extra taxes to Heron. No matter the profession of the working class, citizens had to pay taxes on each revenue and aspect of it (pastures in Agriculture, Fishing in the castle etc.). This included a specific tax introduced by Heron which gained him around £14 (around 1400 days of wages) within the time of his death two years later.[13] The Sheriff of Northumberland was able to exploit the people in his county, it is evident that the Castle of Newcastle affected people dramatically in the 13th century as it gave him the power to act this way.\n\nOverall, The Newcastle Castle has affected many different classes over the years of its history and will continue to do so in the future in the city of Newcastle.\n\n[1] S.

Made of steel and granite, the bridge has come to symbolise all that is important about Tyneside’s manufacturing heritage and its history of engineering and innovation.\n\nThe Tyne Bridge is an enormous arched bridge that was built over the River Tyne. it It aided significantly in cementing a more amicable relationship between Newcastle and Gateshead, which had long been in opposition due to land disputes. Construction began in August 1925 and the completion of the giant structure took only three years. The bridge was constructed similarly to a ship, as the builders used shipbuilding techniques by welding rivets and panels together. It was eventually opened by King George V on 10th October 1928.\n\nThe bridge stood at 170 feet, and was the biggest span bridge in the UK until the construction of the Humber Bridge in Kingston-upon-Hull in 1981. It has two hinged towers, which D Anderson, a structural engineer that worked on the bridge, said “are hollow and have been designed for use as warehouses”. Additionally, author Stafford M Linsley states that “ever since its construction, it has been one of the most potent symbols of Tyneside”.\n\nThe main reason for the creation of the Tyne Bridge was the Great Depression. The Great Depression had severe consequences on the region, such as high unemployment and a fall in industrial production. To develop the economy the council took ‘various measures….to try and improve the….situation on Tyneside’[i], the main one being the creation of the Tyne Bridge. The consequences the Great Depression had on trade in the region can also be argued as a reason for the creation of the Tyne Bridge. Tyneside needed to find new ways of moving trade to not only Gateshead but other parts of the country and the Tyne Bridge would be able to support this movement. This is why when it came to the design it had to be able to ‘carry not only a high density of vehicles but also individual loads up to 100 tons on four wheels’[ii]. Another reason for the creation of the Tyne Bridge was the need to improve road conditions. Not only did the council want to ‘augment existing road and tram crossings over the Tyne between Newcastle and Gateshead’[iii] but they wanted to ease traffic congestion. They believed the Tyne Bridge would aid this by making ‘an important improvement to the A1 trunk road’[iv] so that it would eliminate ‘the steep climbs to and from river level that a trip across the Swing Bridge required’[v].\n\nNowadays, the Tyne Bridge is being used in a variety of different ways, most notably in the annual Great North Run, a half-marathon first organised in 1981. The bridge is a well-established part of the route[vi] and is usually closed for the entire day amongst other streets across Newcastle, Gateshead and South Shields.[vii]\n\nAdditionally, the Tyne Bridge regularly serves to draw attention to important events; such as the Olympic Games in 2012. The rings on the Tyne Bridge are the largest set of Olympic rings in the UK and drew attention to the Olympic football games hosted in Newcastle.[viii]\n\nIt is also a vital part of protests, as demonstrated in a cycle protest by the environmental movement ‘Extinction Rebellion’, in which 70 cyclists temporarily disrupted all traffic on the Tyne Bridge.[ix]\n\nFurthermore, after the illegal New Year’s Eve rave in 2016 in the North Tower of the bridge, there have been discussions of using the tower as an event space for things such as weddings, concerts and art shows. In January 2020 a licensing application was put forward to Newcastle City Council and the tower is planned to be in use as soon as possible, most likely 2021.[x]\n\nThe illustrious history of the Tyne Bridge clearly demonstrates its importance to the concept of region within Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Standing as one of the few changes to traditional Newcastle architecture since the 1840s, it is a defining symbol of the North-East despite its position as neither a truly modern nor old development. The images below are evidence of how it dramatically transformed the area surrounding the River Tyne:\n\nFurthermore, many historical developments in the region have been characterised by the Tyne Bridge. Importantly, it was key in shifting the ‘urban nucleus’ (Linsley, 1998.) of both Newcastle and Gateshead from the Quayside to the city and town centres. For example, it revolutionised the business sector by providing easier access to the city’s commercial heart and bringing extra trade amid the Great Depression. As well as these economic benefits, the Tyne Bridge has also helped generate a feeling of ‘connectivity’ (Hetherington, 2010.) in the region. In recent years, joint cultural ventures between city councils have embellished the bridge with a feeling of collaboration and friendship, whereas historically it had been a source of conflict due to disputes over city boundaries.\n\nAll this aids the view that the Tyne Bridge has become the popular image of the region, being a recognisable landmark for visitors and ‘evocative of home’ (McCord, 1998) for its citizens.\n\nTherefore, the Tyne Bridge has come to be significantly symbolic of Newcastle’s past, present and indeed its future. Despite the fact that Newcastle and the North East as a whole has undergone a large amount of deindustrialisation, which has affected the area greatly, the bridge has remained as a symbol of the resiliency and also a reminder of the areas strong history of industry, engineering and innovation. The previously industrial Quayside area surrounding the bridge has recently undergone massive regeneration and transformation, which centres around 3 main pieces of architecture; the BALTIC Contemporary Art Gallery, the Sage Gateshead Music Centre, and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge. The Millennium Bridge, which opened in 2001, is the first footbridge over the Tyne to be constructed since the Tyne bridge itself and its modern architecture is symbolic of a bright future for Newcastle. The Quayside redevelopment has generated over £1 billion in private sector funding[xi] and this prosperity has helped to turn Newcastle into a tourist destination and cultural centre. Meanwhile, the Tyne bridge remains a symbol of Newcastle and the entire North East as a whole.\n\nBibliography and References\n\n[i] Anna Flowers, Vanessa Histon and Noeman McCord, Water under the bridges: Newcastle’s twentieth century, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Tyne Bridge, 1999), p.54.\n\n[ii] Linsley, M Stafford, Spanning the Tyne: The Building of the Tyne Bridge, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Newcastle libraries & Information service, 1998),p.3.\n\n[iii] Ibid, p.4.\n\n[iv] Anna Flowers, Vanessa Histon and Noeman McCord, Water under the bridges: Newcastle’s twentieth century, (Newcastle Upon Tyne: Tyne Bridge, 1999), p.54.\n\n[v] Ibid.\n\n[vi] https://www.greatrun.org/\n\n[vii] https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/great-north-run-road-closures-9991367\n\n[viii] https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/great-north-run-road-closures-9991367\n\n[ix] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-48063166\n\n[x] https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/tyne-bridge-tower-could-become-17497937\n\n[xi] Miles,S (2005) ‘Our Tyne’: Iconic Regeneration and the Revitalisation of Identity in NewcastleGateshead, Urban Studies, 42, (5/6)"
