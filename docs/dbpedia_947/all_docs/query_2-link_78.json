        "text": "“With my international upbringing, I was drawn to and enrolled in the SGU/Northumbria University Pathway. England was a wonderful experience, and between basic sciences and clinicals, I really enjoyed living and learning in three different countries. Also, I was able to participate in the India selective in Karad, during which we really got to see the challenges that some physicians have to overcome to provide health care for their patients. It’s a situation in which you’re really asked to step out of your comfort zone.”\n\n“There were so many different people from so many different places at SGU, and that was really enjoyable to me. Diversity is a beautiful thing. It teaches you to accept people for their life experiences and their differences. It makes you stronger. I have hired or helped in the hiring process for several SGU graduates because I know they are darn good physicians. They’re willing to work hard, to do what it takes, and never take anything for granted because nothing was handed to them.”\n\n“I honestly have to thank SGU to the fullest extent for preparing me so well for my future in medicine. I honed my skills of teaching and guidance, hard work, dedication, and leadership at SGU. The years in Grenada, along with my rotations in New York, prepared me extremely well for day 1 of residency, where I did not feel any different in terms of overall standard and knowledge from any other American medical school grad. I am extremely grateful to SGU.”\n\n“I chose to study at St. George’s University because it offers a pathway into practicing in the US. The number of US residences filled by SGU graduates was also very impressive and I knew it was well respected by my peers. During my medical school rotations, I had the opportunity to work at many different hospitals across the country, each one providing me with new and valuable skills.”"
