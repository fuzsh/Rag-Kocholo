        "text": "Hundreds of students at Northumbria University are self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19.\n\nA spokesman for the university, in Newcastle, confirmed 770 students had tested positive since returning in mid-September, 78 of whom are symptomatic.\n\nAll infected students, and their close contacts, have self-isolated for 14 days in line with government guidance.\n\nMeanwhile, Newcastle University confirmed it has had 94 students and seven staff test positive.\n\nA Newcastle spokeswoman said the \"overwhelming majority of cases\" were from \"social and domestic settings\".\n\nUniversity and College Union (UCU) said it warned Northumbria University it was \"far too soon for a mass return to campus\".\n\nIn a statement the UCU, which represents lecturers, said: \"We told Northumbria University they had a civic duty to put the health of staff, students and the local community first and we take no pleasure in now seeing another preventable crisis play out.\n\n\"We warned last month that, given the current restrictions in the region, the direction of the infection rate and the problems with test and trace, it was clearly far too soon for a mass return to campus.\"\n\nNorthumbria University said self-isolating students were being provided with food, laundry, cleaning materials and welfare support by the university, working alongside the students' union and Newcastle City Council.\n\nEllie Burgoyne, 19, who studies social sciences, has been isolating since one of her flatmates tested positive a week ago.\n\nShe said: \"The uni and accommodation have been great in providing support and keeping us as comfortable as possible as not leaving our flat for two weeks isn't the most fun.\n\n\"I moved a couple of weeks ago and immediately noticed how strict our accommodation was being when it came to students meeting with other flats, trying to have parties.\n\n\"I think it's a common misconception that students haven't been listening to the guideline, my accommodation has been quiet aside from the odd flat having a few people over.\""
