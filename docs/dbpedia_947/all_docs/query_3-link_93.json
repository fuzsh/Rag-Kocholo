Learn more here\n\nThis is the percentage of applicants to this course who received an offer last year, through Ucas.\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here\n\nThis is what the university has told Ucas about the course. Use it to get a quick idea about what makes it unique compared to similar courses, elsewhere.\n\nHave a question about this info?

Use it to get a quick idea about what makes it unique compared to similar courses, elsewhere.\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here\n\nTeaching Excellence Framework (TEF):\n\nWe've received this information from the Department for Education, via Ucas. This is how the university as a whole has been rated for its quality of teaching: gold silver or bronze. Note, not all universities have taken part in the TEF.\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here\n\nThis information comes from the National Student Survey, an annual student survey of final-year students. You can use this to see how satisfied students studying this subject area at this university, are (not the individual course).\n\nThis is the percentage of final-year students at this university who were \"definitely\" or \"mostly\" satisfied with their course. We've analysed this figure against other universities so you can see whether this is high, medium or low.\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here\n\nThis information is from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), for undergraduate students only.\n\nYou can use this to get an idea of who you might share a lecture with and how they progressed in this subject, here. It's also worth comparing typical A-level subjects and grades students achieved with the current course entry requirements; similarities or differences here could indicate how flexible (or not) a university might be.\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here\n\nPost-six month graduation stats:\n\nThis is from the Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education Survey, based on responses from graduates who studied the same subject area here.\n\nIt offers a snapshot of what grads went on to do six months later, what they were earning on average, and whether they felt their degree helped them obtain a 'graduate role'. We calculate a mean rating to indicate if this is high, medium or low compared to other universities.\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here\n\nGraduate field commentary:\n\nThe Higher Education Careers Services Unit have provided some further context for all graduates in this subject area, including details that numbers alone might not show\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here\n\nThe Longitudinal Educational Outcomes dataset combines HRMC earnings data with student records from the Higher Education Statistics Agency.\n\nWhile there are lots of factors at play when it comes to your future earnings, use this as a rough timeline of what graduates in this subject area were earning on average one, three and five years later. Can you see a steady increase in salary, or did grads need some experience under their belt before seeing a nice bump up in their pay packet?\n\nHave a question about this info? Learn more here"
