        "text": "Course rating (4)\n\nMost of the course are taught in the class. However, there are also classes especially in Engineering related courses, some of the courses are divided into two section. One is seminar and another one is Workshop. Seminar is basically introducing and guiding the theoretical while workshop is to utilize the theoretical which are taught in the class so that students can visualize the outcome and fully understand the course that is being taught in the class. In some occasional cases, the classes are also being taught online when the tutor has some issue with personal cases. The worst part of being taught in the class which I have experienced is that in some of the classes, the tutor just read the slides without proper explanation which gives students abit disappointment.\n\nCourse content: 4 .0\n\nWork placements and internships: 4 .0\n\nLecturers and teaching quality: 3 .0\n\nCareer prospects: 4 .0\n\nTutor contact time: 4 .0\n\nSubject facilities: 4 .0\n\nCourse rating (4)\n\nThe best part of my course is that it is accredited and I get to have a Test user qualification provided I pass but that is a great opportunity. A little bit worse aspect is that sometimes I would like to have more sessions and sometimes face issues with the examination methods\n\nCourse content: 5 .0\n\nWork placements and internships: 2 .0\n\nLecturers and teaching quality: 5 .0\n\nCareer prospects: 3 .0\n\nTutor contact time: 5 .0\n\nSubject facilities: 3 .0\n\nUniversity halls (4)\n\nByron Central\n\nLike best: price, location and only 2 flatmates Worst part: overly expensive washing machine services that do a poor job at drying clothes (not value for money), heaters that turn off and never really fully warm up the room fully, a heat detector above the stove that is beeps unnecessarily and doesn't allow for effective cooking, an unofficial smoking area near the rooms used frequently by earthy smokers - the smell infiltrates the rooms - although no smoking is allowed on the premises.\n\nLocation: 5 .0\n\nSafety: 4 .0\n\nRoom allocation: 2 .0\n\nInternet/wifi: 4 .0\n\nValue for money: 4 .0\n\nProperty management: 2 .0\n\nCourse rating (4)\n\nI've never met a tutor in my entire time here. My first one assigned turned out to not be working here anymore. I didn't receive much direct interaction from any tutors that I've had so therefore I have not used them.\n\nCourse content: 3 .0\n\nWork placements and internships: 5 .0\n\nLecturers and teaching quality: 4 .0\n\nCareer prospects: 5 .0\n\nTutor contact time: 2 .0\n\nSubject facilities: 4 .0\n\nUniversity location (4)\n\nGreat social life here, police and uni security presence makes it a safe place. Part time work can often be limited to bar-staff jobs which can take over studying especially if you have a zero hour contract. But apart from that it's a fun location live and work.\n\nCost of living: 4 .0\n\nSafety: 4 .0\n\nPublic transport: 5 .0\n\nPart-time work opportunities: 3 .0\n\nGraduate employment opportunities: 5 .0\n\nDiversity: 5 .0\n\nUniversity location (4)\n\ni live here anyway so love the city, always going to be expensive as a student and also i struggled to find a part time job - probably because i was avoiding pubs etc so as not to be walking home late along\n\nCost of living: 3 .0\n\nSafety: 3 .0\n\nPublic transport: 5 .0\n\nPart-time work opportunities: 3 .0\n\nGraduate employment opportunities: 4 .0\n\nDiversity: 5 .0"
