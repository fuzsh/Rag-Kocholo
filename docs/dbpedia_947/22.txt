Northumbria University has its origins in three regional colleges: Rutherford College of Technology, the College of Art & Industrial Design and the Municipal College of Commerce. An amalgamation of these three institutions formed the Newcastle Polytechnic in 1969, which became the major regional centre for the training of teachers with the incorporation of the City College of Education in 1974, and the Northern Counties College of Education in 1976.

Northumbria was inaugurated as a university in 1992. There was much discussion over the potential name of the new University and one potential name was the City University of Newcastle upon Tyne. However, concerns over confusion with the nearby University of Newcastle upon Tyne and also over the new name's initials saw it dropped before it was used. Newcastle Polytechnic was thus upgraded under the name University of Northumbria at Newcastle.

The trading name was simplified to Northumbria University in 2002.

A considerable amount of the University's properties lie on Northumberland Road which has it's own page on this site here Northumberland Road.
