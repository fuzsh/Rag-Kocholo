        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nSlovakia traces its roots to the 9th century state of Great Moravia. Subsequently, the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom, where they remained for the next 1,000 years. After the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, backlash to language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian (Magyarization) encouraged the strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs, who fell administratively under the Austrian half of the empire. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World War I, the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. The new state was envisioned as a nation with Czech and Slovak branches. During the interwar period, Slovak nationalist leaders pushed for autonomy within Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 Slovakia became an independent state created by and allied with Nazi Germany. Following World War II, Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and came under communist rule within Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of Czechoslovakia's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create \"socialism with a human face,\" ushering in a period of repression known as \"normalization.\" The peaceful \"Velvet Revolution\" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia underwent a nonviolent \"velvet divorce\" into its two national components, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro zone on 1 January 2009.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Europe, south of Poland\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n48 40 N, 19 30 E\n\nMap references\n\nEurope\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 49,035 sq km\n\nland: 48,105 sq km\n\nwater: 930 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 131\n\nArea - comparative\n\nabout one and a half times the size of Maryland;

With a population of 5.4 million, the Slovak Republic has a small, open economy driven mainly by automobile and electronics exports, which account for more than 80% of GDP. Slovakia joined the EU in 2004 and the euro zone in 2009. The country’s banking sector is sound and predominantly foreign owned.Slovakia has been a regional FDI champion for several years, attractive due to a relatively low-cost yet skilled labor force, and a favorable geographic location in the heart of Central Europe. Exports and investment have been key drivers of Slovakia’s robust growth in recent years. The unemployment rate fell to historical lows in 2017, and rising wages fueled increased consumption, which played a more prominent role in 2017 GDP growth. A favorable outlook for the Eurozone suggests continued strong growth prospects for Slovakia during the next few years, although inflation is also expected to pick up.Among the most pressing domestic issues potentially threatening the attractiveness of the Slovak market are shortages in the qualified labor force, persistent corruption issues, and an inadequate judiciary, as well as a slow transition to an innovation-based economy. The energy sector in particular is characterized by unpredictable regulatory oversight and high costs, in part driven by government interference in regulated tariffs. Moreover, the government’s attempts to maintain low household energy prices could harm the profitability of domestic energy firms while undercutting energy efficiency initiatives.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$179.7 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$173.8 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$168.2 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 69\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$95.96 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n3.4% (2017 est.)\n\n3.3% (2016 est.)\n\n3.9% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 102\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$33,100 (2017 est.)\n\n$32,000 (2016 est.)\n\n$31,000 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 61\n\nGross national saving\n\n20.6% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n21.1% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n22.5% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 92\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 54.7% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 19.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 21.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 1.2% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 96.3% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -92.9% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 3.8% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 35% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 61.2% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ngrains, potatoes, sugar beets, hops, fruit;
