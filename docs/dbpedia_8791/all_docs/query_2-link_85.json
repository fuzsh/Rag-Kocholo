Information about the content and required terms will be set by measure of the Slovak Ministry of Finance.\n\nThe amendment also introduces an obligation to state in the audit report whether the accounting entity was required to prepare and publish a CbC reportâeffective for audit reports prepared for accounting periods beginning 22 June 2025 or later."
