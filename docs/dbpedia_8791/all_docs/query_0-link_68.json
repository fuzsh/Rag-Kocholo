        "text": "What types of companies exist in Slovakia?\n\nIn Slovakia, business can be organized in various legal forms, each of which has its own characteristics, advantages and responsibilities. Choosing the appropriate form depends on many factors, including the size and type of business, the number of founders, the desired level of responsibility, and tax considerations. Let’s take a closer look at the main types of companies that exist in Slovakia.\n\nLimited Liability Company (s. r. o.)\n\nA limited liability company (spoločnosť s ručením obmedzeným, s.r.o.) is one of the most popular forms of business in Slovakia. This is due to the limited liability of the founders, who only risk the capital invested in the business, and the relatively simple registration and management process. The minimum authorized capital is 5,000 euros and must be paid in before the company is registered in the Commercial Register.\n\nJoint-stock Company (a. s.)\n\nA joint-stock company (Akciová spoločnosť, a.s.) is suitable for large enterprises with a large number of shareholders and the need to attract investment through the issue of shares. The founders bear limited liability in the amount of their contributions to the company’s share capital. The minimum authorized capital for the establishment of a joint-stock company is 25,000 euros.\n\nLimited Company (k. s.)\n\nA limited company (Komanditná spoločnosť, k.s.) is a company that combines limited liability partners (limited partners) and unlimited liability partners (complementary partners). This form is suitable for businesses where one or more parties want to be actively managed with full responsibility, while others prefer to be investors only.\n\nFull Partnership (V. O. S.)\n\nA general partnership (Verejná obchodná spoločnosť, v. o.s.) is a business established by two or more partners who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the company. This is a traditional form for a family business or small business, where all founders are actively involved in management and operations.\n\nIndividual entrepreneur (živnostník)\n\nIndividual entrepreneur (živnostník) is the simplest and most flexible form of doing business, suitable for freelancers, consultants and master craftsmen. Zhivnostniki are registered in the Zhivnostenskiy register and can operate without creating a legal entity, but bear full personal responsibility for business obligations.\n\nCooperative (družstvo)\n\nA cooperative (Družstvo) is an association of individuals for doing business, working or producing, based on the principles of mutual assistance and self-government. Cooperatives can be useful in agriculture, manufacturing, retail, and services, allowing members to jointly own and operate businesses.\n\nConclusion\n\nChoosing the right form of business in Slovakia requires careful planning and consideration of many factors, including legal obligations, tax implications and management needs. Each form offers a unique set of benefits and limitations, so it’s important to discuss your choice with a legal or financial advisor to find the most appropriate structure for your business.\n\nWhat is the size of the company’s authorized capital in Slovakia?\n\nThe size of the authorized capital of a company in Slovakia depends on the form of legal entity under which the business is organized. The authorized capital is an important financial indicator that reflects the amount of funds contributed by the founders or shareholders when registering a company to support its activities. It serves not only as the financial basis of the company, but also as an indicator of its reliability for creditors and partners. Consider the size of the authorized capital for various forms of companies in Slovakia.\n\nLimited Liability Company (s. r. o.)\n\nFor a limited liability company (s.r.o.), the minimum authorized capital is 5,000 euros. Each of the founders must make a contribution, which can be monetary or non-monetary (for example, property or equipment), but a share of the funds must be made before the company is registered. The minimum contribution of one founder is 750 euros.\n\nJoint-stock Company (a. s.)\n\nThe Joint-stock Company (a.s.) is intended for large enterprises with the possibility of attracting investment through the issue of shares. The minimum authorized capital for a joint-stock company is 25,000 euros for a closed type and 100,000 euros for an open type that plans to issue shares to a wide range of investors.\n\nLimited Company (k. s.)\n\nIn a limited company (k.s.), there are no strict requirements for the minimum size of the authorized capital. However, the company must have at least one limited investor (limited liability investor), whose liability is limited to the size of his contribution, and one complementary (managing partner), who has unlimited responsibility and, as a rule, manages the company’s affairs.\n\nFull Partnership (V. O. S.)\n\nFor a full partnership (V. O. S.), there is also no minimum amount of authorized capital. All founders are jointly and severally liable for the company’s obligations, which means that each of them can be held liable for the entire amount of the company’s debts.\n\nIndividual entrepreneur (živnostník)\n\nFor individual entrepreneurs (živnostník), the concept of authorized capital does not apply, since they operate without creating a legal entity and bear full personal responsibility for their obligations.\n\nCooperative (družstvo)\n\nThe size of the authorized capital of a cooperative (družstvo) may vary and is determined by the constituent documents. Each member of the cooperative makes a contribution, the amount of which is set out in the charter, and the liability of members is limited to the amount of their contributions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe choice of the form of business and the size of the authorized capital in Slovakia depends on many factors, including the scope of the proposed activity, plans to attract investment, as well as the desired level of legal protection and liability. It is important to think carefully about these aspects when planning a business, as well as consult with legal and financial experts to ensure compliance with local laws and optimize the tax burden.\n\nShould a company in Slovakia have a local director?\n\nSlovak legislation does not explicitly require that the director or manager of a company must be a resident of Slovakia. However, there are certain obligations and conditions that may facilitate the conduct of business and compliance with local laws and regulations if the director resides in Slovakia or is a citizen of the European Union.\n\nCompany registration and management\n\nRegistration and successful management of a company in Slovakia requires compliance with a number of legal and administrative procedures, including registration in the commercial register, tax authorities, interaction with social and health insurance. Having a director who resides in Slovakia or is well-versed in local legislation and business practices can greatly simplify these processes.\n\nTax and legal obligations\n\nThe Company’s Director is responsible for ensuring that the company complies with tax laws, accounting rules, and other regulatory requirements. In this context, it may be an advantage to have a director who has experience in the Slovak legal system and can ensure that all the necessary requirements are properly met.\n\nRepresentation of the company’s interests\n\nFor effective representation of the company’s interests before government agencies, banks, and other institutions in Slovakia, having a local director can provide significant advantages. The local director has a better understanding of local procedures and practices, which can lead to more successful interaction with these entities.\n\nInternational companies\n\nFor international companies looking to expand their presence in the Slovak market, the appointment of a local director can be a strategic decision that facilitates integration into the local business environment and accelerates the process of adapting to local laws and market conditions.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough having a local director in a company in Slovakia is not legally required, it can make it much easier to do business, manage the company, and meet legal and tax requirements. The choice of a director should take into account both legal aspects and practical expediency in order to ensure the company’s successful operation in the Slovak market.\n\nWhat is the amount of state fees when establishing a company in Slovakia?\n\nWhen establishing a company in Slovakia, entrepreneurs need to take into account a number of state fees and charges that are mandatory for payment during the registration process and further business operations. The amount of these fees may vary depending on the type of company and the specific registration requirements. It is important to plan these costs in advance to ensure a smooth start to the company’s operations. Let’s look at the main state fees associated with the establishment of a company in Slovakia.\n\nRegistration in the Commercial Register\n\nOne of the key steps in establishing a company is to register it in the Slovak Trade Register. The registration fee depends on the form of the company’s legal entity and how the application is submitted:\n\nLimited Liability Company (s.r.o.): When submitting an application in electronic form through the electronic signature system, the fee is about 150 euros. When submitting a paper application, the fee may be higher.\n\nJoint-stock company (a.s.): The fee for registering a joint-stock company is usually higher and can reach about 750 euros, depending on the application method and the authorized capital.\n\nNotary services\n\nNotarial services may be required to certify constituent documents and applications submitted for registration. The cost of notary services may vary, but entrepreneurs should expect costs ranging from 30 to 300 euros, depending on the complexity of the documents and the number of signatures required.\n\nTrademark Registration Fee\n\nIf a company plans to register a trademark in Slovakia, this will require an additional fee. The fee for registration of a trademark with the Slovak Patent Office (ÚPV) starts from approximately EUR 166 per class of goods or services according to the International Classification.\n\nLicense fees\n\nDepending on the type of activity of the company, special licenses or permits may be required, for which a state fee is also charged. The amount of such fees varies depending on the specific type of license and field of activity.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen establishing a company in Slovakia, it is necessary to take into account various state fees and charges, which may vary significantly depending on the type of legal entity, the chosen form of registration and the specifics of doing business. Pre-planning and accounting for these costs will help ensure a smoother process of establishing a company and avoid unforeseen financial difficulties at the initial stage.\n\nWhat is the annual cost of servicing a company in Slovakia?\n\nThe annual cost of servicing a company in Slovakia includes several key components that are necessary to maintain the company in compliance with local legislation and regulatory requirements. These costs may vary depending on the size of the company, the scope of its activities, and what additional services it may require in the course of its work. Let’s take a closer look at the main items of expenses related to the company’s annual maintenance in Slovakia.\n\nTaxes and social contributions\n\nCorporate tax: The standard corporate tax rate in Slovakia is 21%. Companies need to file a regular tax return and pay taxes according to their income.\n\nVAT: If a company is registered as a VAT payer, it needs to keep records of VAT transactions and regularly submit relevant reports.

The amount of contributions depends on the salary of employees.\n\nAccounting and auditing services\n\nAccounting services: The cost of accounting services may vary significantly depending on the volume of operations and the specifics of the company’s activities. On average, small and medium-sized enterprises can expect annual expenses of several hundred to several thousand euros.\n\nAudit: Certain companies in Slovakia require a mandatory audit. The cost of an audit depends on the size of the company and the complexity of its financial operations.\n\nRegistration fees and licenses\n\nAnnual fee for maintaining the Trade Register: The Company needs to update its data in the Trade Register annually, for which a symbolic fee may be charged.\n\nSpecialized licenses: Depending on the company’s business, additional licenses or permits may be required, with separate fees for obtaining and renewing them.\n\nLegal and consulting services\n\nDepending on the specifics of the company’s business and needs, there may be expenses for legal and consulting services. These expenses may relate to corporate governance, tax planning, regulatory compliance, etc.\n\nOffice expenses\n\nThese expenses include rental of office space, utility bills, purchase of office equipment, and other operating expenses. The amount of these expenses depends on the location and size of the office, as well as on the needs of the business.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe annual cost of servicing a company in Slovakia depends on many factors and can vary significantly depending on the size of the company, the scope of its activities and the chosen business strategy. It is important to carefully plan all possible expenses and take them into account when developing a business plan and budgeting.\n\nWhat are the main advantages of establishing a company in Slovakia?\n\nEstablishing a company in Slovakia offers a number of advantages that make this country attractive for entrepreneurs and international businesses. Due to its strategic location in the center of Europe, stable economy and favorable business environment, Slovakia offers unique opportunities for the development of companies of various sizes.

These methods take into account both local and international aspects of business, providing flexibility and the opportunity for entrepreneurs to choose the best way to create their company. Let’s look at the main ways to establish a company in Slovakia.\n\nDirect company registration\n\nThis is the most common way to establish a company, which involves creating a new legal entity. The process includes selecting the type of company (for example, a limited liability company or a joint-stock company), preparing the constituent documents, registering in the Commercial Register, and obtaining the appropriate licenses and permits.\n\nRegistration steps include:\n\nPreparation and signing of constituent documents.\n\nOpening a bank account and depositing the authorized capital.\n\nRegistration in the Commercial Register of Slovakia through a notary or an online service.\n\nRegister with the tax inspectorate and get a taxpayer identification number.\n\nBuying a ready-made company\n\nThis method involves acquiring an existing, registered company, which can significantly reduce the time to start a business. A ready-made company is usually already registered in the Commercial Register, has a current account, and can be “clean”, i.e., do not conduct real activities until the moment of sale.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nQuick start of the activity.\n\nRegistration procedures that have already been completed.\n\nHaving a company history can be useful when applying for loans or negotiating with partners.\n\nEstablishment of a branch or representative office\n\nForeign companies can choose to set up a branch or representative office in Slovakia as a way to enter the local market. The branch operates as part of a foreign company and can conduct commercial activities, while the representative office is limited in rights and mainly engages in marketing and representative functions.\n\nBasic steps:\n\nRegistration in the Commercial Register.\n\nObtaining the necessary permits and licenses for specific activities.\n\nVirtual office\n\nFor those who are looking for a cost-effective way to start a business in Slovakia, a virtual office may be the right solution. This allows entrepreneurs to have a legal address in Slovakia without having to rent a physical office space.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe choice of method of establishing a company in Slovakia depends on specific business goals, management preferences, as well as the need for rapid entry into the market or the development of a long-term presence strategy. Each of these approaches has its own advantages and features that should be taken into account when making an informed decision about starting a business in this country.\n\nDo I need to have a registered office in Slovakia?\n\nAccording to Slovak legislation, every company registered in Slovakia is required to have a registered office within the country. This address is used as the official location of the company, where all legal, tax and official documents are sent.\n\nCompany registration\n\nThe legal address is required at the stage of company registration and is entered in the Commercial Register of Slovakia. It serves as public proof of the legality of the business and its presence in the country’s legal system. Without a legal address, the company registration process cannot be completed.\n\nCommunications with government agencies\n\nThe legal address is used for all official communications between the company and government agencies, including tax notices, requests from social and health insurance, and other important documents. This ensures that all necessary notifications and requirements are received and processed in a timely manner.\n\nImproving trust and creditworthiness\n\nHaving a fixed legal address in Slovakia increases the trust of customers and partners in the company. It serves as an indicator of the stability and reliability of the business. In addition, a legal address may be a prerequisite for obtaining bank loans and financial support.\n\nLegal address options\n\nTo fulfill the requirement of having a legal address, companies in Slovakia can use the address of their office, rented premises, or use the services of providing a legal address through specialized services. The latter option may be especially convenient for foreign entrepreneurs or start-ups who are not yet ready to rent a permanent office space.\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving a registered office in Slovakia is an essential aspect of doing business and ensures compliance with legal requirements, as well as contributes to strengthening business reputation and operational efficiency. It is important to choose a legal address that will meet the needs and development strategy of your company, taking into account both current tasks and long-term business goals.\n\nCan I open a branch of a foreign company in Slovakia?\n\nOpening a branch of a foreign company in Slovakia is a popular and feasible way for international businesses to expand their presence and operate in this country.

A company can operate without hiring staff, if its activities allow it to do so. For example, individual entrepreneurs or companies that provide consulting services often work without hiring additional employees.\n\nStrategic considerations\n\nThe issue of hiring employees is often raised not only from the point of view of compliance with the law, but also in the context of strategic planning and business development. Having qualified employees can be a key factor in a company’s success, especially if the business requires specialized knowledge or active customer service.

This includes registering with the social security system and the tax service, paying wages not lower than the minimum level established in the country, and ensuring that employees ‘ labor rights are respected.\n\nAlternatives to hiring\n\nFor companies looking to stay flexible and reduce their HR costs, there are alternative options.

It is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons, considering both the potential benefits of having a qualified staff and the responsibilities that the company faces when hiring them. In any case, proper planning and compliance with the law play a key role in successful business operations in Slovakia.\n\nHow do I choose a company name in Slovakia?\n\nChoosing a name for a company is a key step in the process of establishing it, especially in a country with such a diverse and competitive business landscape as Slovakia.

Check if the domain name that matches your company name is available, especially in the domain .sk if you are focused on the Slovak market.\n\nStep 7: Testing the name\n\nAfter you’ve selected a few potential titles, we recommend testing them among your target audience. This will help you understand how attractive the name is to potential customers and whether it reflects the values of your brand.\n\nConclusion\n\nChoosing a name for a company in Slovakia is not only a legal necessity, but also an important element of the branding strategy.
