        "text": "Following Slovakiaâ€™s transition from a centrally planned to market-oriented economy in the 1990s, it grew into a high-income country. It has one of the lowest levels of income inequality among OECD countries, but the western and eastern regions of the country vary considerably in terms of GDP per capita.\n\nSlovakia came into being in 1992, the result of a peaceful separation between Slovakia and Czechia, known as the Velvet Divorce. This separation was the result of the rise of nationalist ideas, the lack of a uniform Czechoslovak identity, and the gradual decentralization of political power. Today, Slovakian politics show a high degree of political party volatility, with frequent merging and splintering. The emergence of new parties is not uncommon, especially to challenge dominant parties associated with corruption. Slovakiaâ€™s international orientation is another central issue. In the past five years, polarization has increased between pro-European liberal parties and nationalist-populist parties, with support to Ukraine as a key political fault line.\n\nToday, the two largest minority groups are Hungarians and the Roma, whose populations often face discrimination, social exclusion, and lack of access to housing and jobs. In 2022, the Council of Europe urged Slovakia to improve access to education for Roma children and counteract over-representation of Roma children in special classes and schools for pupils with disabilities. Recent reports document the use of BeneÅ¡ Decrees, a WWII remnant that allows the state to confiscate land belonging to ethnic Hungarians without compensation. Additionally, Slovakia has experienced rising anti-immigration rhetoric, especially following the 2015 migration crisis, and has been criticized for its immigrant detention practices.\n\nIn terms of gender equality, women are under-represented in economic, social and political decision-making, hampered by traditional gender stereotypes. Womenâ€™s equal and full political participation is also challenged by attacks and criticisms during the election period. Gender-based violence remains prevalent, particularly impacting women in marginalized Roma communities. There have also been intensifying threats against the LGTBQIA+ community, including a terrorist attack at an LGBTQIA+ bar in October 2022. Finally, Slovakia faces challenges with press freedom, intimidation and shrinking civic space. The assassination of JÃ¡n Kuciak, an investigative journalist who reported on corruption and organized crime, led to the ousting of Prime Minister Robert Fico in 2018."
