        "text": "Todayâ€™s a big day at Handshake - all of our employer partners, education partners, and students can post, comment, and access new student profile features on the Handshake feed. With this release, we're empowering the next generation of talent to truly own their professional narrative from day one. They can share their authentic stories, connect with others facing similar challenges, learn from seasoned pros, and get discovered by great employers - all in one dynamic social network. Huge props to the team who made this possible! ðŸš€\n\nProud to partner with these amazing employers like FedEx Ground, Cisco, Goldman Sachs, PwC who are going above and beyond for early talent. Special shoutout to the Naval Nuclear Laboratory (FMP), one of the other winners. My dad was in the US Navy for 27 years and I grew up on Naval bases around the world. The NNL develops the naval nuclear propulsion technology that drive's our Navyâ€™s submarine and aircraft carrier Fleets, and trains the Sailors who operate our reactors. Proud to partner with the NNL to help them find amazing young talent to keep our fleet running! Congrats to all of the 2024 Handshake #EarlyTalentAwards winners: https://bit.ly/4caQkMi\n\nAnnouncing the inaugural Handshake #CareerSparkAwards: 30+ career services teams that stand out for their utilization and programmatic success on Handshake. As the connective tissue between students and employers, career services teams are core to everything Handshake does. Itâ€™s amazing to see what this yearâ€™s award winners have accomplished across student engagement, employer engagement and curation, and analytics and reportingâ€”all in service of driving equitable outcomes for students and powering the future of work. If your alma mater made the list, be sure to give them a shout out today! See the winners at https://bit.ly/48UxHe2\n\nToday's the premiere of Emily Chang's amazing new show, The Circuit. Download the Bloomberg app on your TV - and put it right next to Netflix! New episodes drop Thursdays at 8p ET on your TV (or here: https://lnkd.in/gbPwts2h) or 10p ET on Bloomberg TV. I'm biased but...it's really great. You should watch it this week (to learn why Ev Williams paid the Dalai Lama's phone bill + impersonated Oprah) and every week! In the next episode she goes inside the beautiful (but sterile and....eerie) offices of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and Dall-E. Then, in my favorite episode yet, she visits Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky at his home and on walks around San Francisco for a deeply personal and emotional interview. Later in the season: Satya Nadella, Gary Tan on San Francisco, Bill Gurley over BBQ and for all you pop culture fans, itâ€™s Hailey Bieber, Natalie Portman, the team behind Barbie and on and on... https://lnkd.in/g-GP6Zj6"
