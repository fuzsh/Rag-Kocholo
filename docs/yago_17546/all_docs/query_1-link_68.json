What began as a simple quest to compress a holistic account of the Pakistani nuclear program turned into a Rubik’s cube. As a first-time writer setting out to pull together a balanced and objective account on a subject considered taboo for decades, I ran into the proverbial Clauswitzian “fog of war,” where a maze of claims and counterclaims made the research difficult. Like many aspects of Pakistan’s politics and history, its nuclear story is awash with controversies and competing narratives. Yet, the most intriguing aspect during the course of this research was facing the challenge of the relentless disinformation campaign unleashed on the Pakistani nuclear program. Gore Vidal’s famous quotation emphasizing that a “[d]isinformation campaign has metastasized to a level where myth threatens to overthrow history” aptly applies to the case study of Pakistan. This was one reason that galvanized my efforts in telling the story of the Pakistani nuclear program and my interest in writing this book. In the case of new nuclear states—such as India, Israel, and Pakistan—the necessity to keep the nuclear weapons program covert in order to resist international proliferation pressures has added another layer of opacity. The habits that come with decades of secrecy do not disappear overnight just because the country has conducted a declared nuclear test. Furthermore, as with many developing countries, the Pakistan government does not open its national archives to outside scrutiny, especially on matters of national security. Even nonofficial accounts, such as newspaper and journal articles, are difficult to access with collections often incomplete. On top of these challenges, reconstructing the Pakistani case is vexing because its nuclear history is still contested by those who took part in the program. As this study will show, the establishment of two rival organizations—the ix\n\nPreface\n\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Khan Research Laboratories (KRL)—created an intense bureaucratic rivalry, in which members of both organizations have sought to highlight their own successes and minimize the accomplishments of the other. While the rivalry has waxed and waned, it frequently led to poisonous interpersonal relationships. That bitterness has frequently affected the accounts of those who took part in the interlaboratory issues. Further, the deliberate attempt to compartmentalize the program has meant that very few individuals (perhaps none) have had a complete view of the effort. As with all accounts of Pakistani history, nuclear developments are also part of a broader pattern of civil-military relations, in which control over nuclear decisions has frequently been an indicator of political strength. Given the success of the nuclear program, military and civilian leaders have considerable interest in highlighting their role. My experience as former director in Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division (SPD)—the secretariat of Pakistan’s National Command Authority (NCA)— provides insight in terms of information and analysis. The last decade of my thirty-two years in the military were dedicated to the Pakistani nuclear program. It all began with a little-known event in Pakistan’s nuclear history when President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif resigned from their respective offices in July , and handed over responsibility for the nuclear program to Chief of the Army Staff General Abdul Waheed. This charge eventually fell to Major General Ziauddin—Director General Combat Development Directorate—under whom I was posted from the end of  until the SPD was formed. In , I joined the faculty at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) along with my close friend and colleague Dr. Peter R. Lavoy, who was at the time director of the Center on Contemporary Conflict (CCC) in the Department of National Security Affairs (NSA). Under his leadership, I was involved in several research projects on South Asia that included two major military crises—“The Kargil Conflict” and the “– India-Pakistan Military Standoff.” Since that time, I have continued to work on a litany of research projects relating to South Asian security and strategic stability, including the completion of this book. Dr. Lavoy was enthusiastic when I proposed researching this book. We began the research as coauthors. Our first task was to request from the Pakistan government and authorities in Islamabad cooperation and guidance in facilitating the research, including interviews, access to public documents, and archives.\n\nPreface\n\nThe proposal was accepted after careful coordination and processing in Islamabad, where Pakistani authorities laid strict rules for our interviews, which we respected. We were not allowed to interview serving scientists, or active-duty officials. Retired officials and scientists were cleared for interviews only if they were willing to talk voluntarily. On our part, we ensured that SPD carefully scrutinized our questionnaires for any sensitive matter or inadvertent overstepping. When necessary, authorities facilitated the research with “background briefings” by concerned government departments.1 This book, then, relies on several types of source material in an attempt to overcome these challenges, while always being cognizant of their limitations. By far the most important contribution comes from interviews with key civilian leaders, military officers, and nuclear scientists. With the extraordinary approval of the Pakistani government, I was granted permission to interview for the first time many officials about their role in Pakistan’s remarkable nuclear history. These interviews were compared with a variety of other sources. U.S. declassified documents provided considerable information about U.S. perceptions of the covert Pakistani effort, and showed the U.S. understanding of Pakistan’s motivations and technical milestones at various periods of history. There are wide arrays of Pakistani accounts discussing nuclear developments. Many of these accounts come from participants in the feud between Pakistan’s two rival laboratories, with friendly journalists producing slanted accounts. A similar distortion is evident in many contemporary Pakistani articles. Reports in the U.S. press, while better, frequently lean toward sensationalism or showcase leaks that were provided with a clear policy agenda in mind. To navigate this hazardous terrain, the author has relied on his own personal knowledge of Pakistan’s nuclear and military history to help ascertain what is true and what is merely propaganda. To the extent possible, this text will highlight these controversies and describe the evidence that led to conclusions when evidence is contradictory. In some cases, the evidence is too ambiguous to draw any conclusions. Even with the assistance of interviews, there remains resistance to scrutiny. Several key officials did not yet believe it was time to write the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program. The Abdul Qadeer (A. Q.) Khan proliferation network scandal that became public in  formed a backdrop for the interviews. Khan’s role in Pakistan’s nuclear developments, already divisive given the interlaboratory rivalry, became a national controversy in Pakistan. Many individuals approached for this study were wary of inserting themselves into xi\n\nPreface\n\nan arena of such contentious politics, fearing that whatever they said would be misunderstood or distorted. Such fears were accentuated by Western accounts that many Pakistanis felt demonized by the accomplishments of the nuclear program. When someone knocked on their door asking for an interview, they were understandably suspicious. Even so, a surprising number of individuals were willing to talk on the record. Some officials asked that portions or all of their interviews occur without direct attribution, and their wishes to remain anonymous have been honored in this text. Despite these limitations, the book that follows provides the first comprehensive account of the Pakistan nuclear weapons program. While incomplete, as all histories are, this account substantially improves upon existing prior accounts. In part, it does so by assiduously following scholarly convention, which is too frequently discarded in works published in Pakistan. Throughout the text, on-the-record and anonymous interviews are cited directly. When information was provided on background, I have attempted to verify the information in a citable format. When clear written or interview evidence is not present, I have attempted to signal uncertainty or lack of clarity in the text. The hope is that this work is the first of many nuanced, scholarly, and clear-headed accounts on this topic. It does not seek to glorify or demonize those who took part in these decisions, but rather chronicle, as best it can, the role that numerous individuals from many organizations contributed to Pakistan’s present nuclear capability. Additionally, it is important to highlight that interviews conducted for this research would not have been possible without the approval of former president Pervez Musharraf, and with the consistent support of Lieutenant General Khalid Kidwai, director-general of Pakistan’s SPD; both of whom were gracious enough to provide their own inputs at various times. No words can sufficiently thank them and the staff at SPD for their positive outlook and for providing all necessary assistance and guidance. In , Dr. Lavoy left his post at NPS, after which I carried the baton for completing this book. As a consequence, this work is devoid of the wisdom, quality, and style that Peter Lavoy would have provided as coauthor. He was dearly missed as I struggled to write, but his words of encouragement throughout these years strengthened my resolve to finish this book. I owe a word of gratitude to all the others who made a great impact on this book over the past five years. First are the three editors who contributed to the completion of this book in no small order. Anya Erokhina, a graduate of the xii\n\nPreface\n\nMonterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS) and aspiring scholar, helped me with both the research and writing of the initial draft. Mansoor Ahmed, now a lecturer at the Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, did extensive research for all of these years; his contribution is exceptionally appreciated. Lisa Donohoe Luscombe helped compile and develop the final manuscript. The research team at the CCC helped me keep pace with narratives, events, and records of the interviews. Those who made an immense contribution include Christopher Clary, Adam Radin, Puja Verma, Kali Shelor, Rebekah Dietz, and Nick Masellis. In addition, thanks go to a series of close friends and enthusiasts from the Monterey Bay area, Dr. Lois Lagier, Roderick and Suzanne Dewar, whose consistent support and lens as interested, well-read laymen on the subject brought important perspectives that helped refine the subject matter. Also to several of my professional colleagues, scholars, and South Asian experts in and out of government, for their invaluable encouragement, support, and friendship: Dr. James Wirtz, Dr. Zachary Davis, Dr. Michael Krepon, Dr. George Perkovich, Dr. William Potter, Mr. Robert Swartz, Mr. Toby Dalton, Ms. Kathryn Schultz, Dr. Scott Sagan, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, and Dr. Michael Elleman. I am especially indebted to Dr. Michael Wheeler and Mr. David Hamon for their consistent support in the completion of this work. My Pakistani colleagues also deserve sincere recognition for their consistent encouragement: Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, Dr. Rifaat Hussain, Dr. Zafar Jaspal, and Dr. Salma Malik. I owe a special thanks to the Directorate of Arms Control and Disarmament, SPD, for their consistent support. Brigadier (ret.) Naeem Salik and Air Commodore Khalid Banuri, two directors that succeeded me, deserve special gratitude for their consistent help. Finally, thanks go to my family—from California to Islamabad—Mahreen, Mahvish, Sarem, and Haider, to whom belongs the future. They bore the burden of my distractions and moods as I burned the midnight oil.\n\nxiii\n\nPakistan: Key Characters\n\nGovernors-General Mohammad Ali Jinnah – Khwaja Nazimuddin – Ghulam Mohammad – Iskander Mirza –\n\nPresidents Iskander Mirza – General Mohammad Ayub Khan – General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan – Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto – Fazal Elahi Chaudhry – General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq – Ghulam Ishaq Khan – Farooq Khan Leghari – Rafiq Tarar – General Pervez Musharraf – Asif Ali Zardari –present\n\nPrime Ministers Liaquat Ali Khan – Khwaja Nazimuddin – Mohammad Ali Bogra – Chaudhry Mohammad Ali – Husain Shaheed Suharwardy – xv\n\nPakistan: Key Characters\n\nIftikhar I Chundrigar  (Interim) Feroz Khan Noon – Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto – Mohammad Khan Junejo – Benazir Bhutto – Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi  (Interim) Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif – Balak Sher Mazari  (Interim) Moeenuddin Qureshi  (Interim) Benazir Bhutto – Malik Meraj Khalid – (Interim) Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif – Zafarullah Jamali – Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain  (Interim) Shaukat Aziz – Mian Mohamad Soomro (Interim) Yusuf Raza Gilani –12 Raja Pervez Ashraf 12–present\n\nArmy Chiefs General Sir Frank Messervy – General Sir Douglas Gracy – General (Field Marshal) Mohammad Ayub Khan – General Mohammad Musa Khan – General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan – Lt.

A mere seventeen days after neighboring India had shocked the world with its first nuclear tests since , Pakistan’s response came as a surprise to many observers. Some had doubted that Pakistan possessed the capability to construct a nuclear explosive. But even those who thought that Pakistan could test a weapon were astonished by the speed of the Pakistani reaction. Many observers wondered how a poor country recovering from catastrophic wars and national dismemberment—and struggling with national identity crises—could devote its limited state resources to acquiring such potentially destructive technology.1 This book examines how and why Pakistan managed to overcome the wide array of obstacles that stood between it and nuclear weapons. It unravels the interplay of personalities and organizations involved in developing the bomb against a backdrop of political, security, and economic constraints, as well as opportunities. It contributes to the established tradition of academic work that examines the causes behind nuclear proliferation by telling the Pakistani nuclear story. While excellent academic accounts describe the origins of the other key nuclear weapons programs (for example, those of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Israel, and India),2 existing accounts of Pakistan’s pursuit of the bomb either have been journalistic, have focused almost exclusively on the A. Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network, or have included Pakistan only in a broader discussion of nuclear weapons in South Asia.3 Pakistan’s nuclear program evolved under immensely complex and challenging security circumstances. Structural generalizations do not explain the complexities of its historical existence and evolution unless a holistic account is understood. This book examines that historical experience—a blend of cultural nuances, idiosyncrasies of personalities, and the multitudinous pulls of domes\n\nIntroduction\n\ntic politics, regional crises, and geographical compulsions, as well as technical challenges, global politics, and international barriers to nuclear materials and know-how. Nuclear technology is now nearing seven decades of development, but nuclear politics and technological determinism remain the quintessential factors in international relations, especially for developing states. Fascination in mastering the mystery of the atom is as much alive today as it was in the early fifties, when many of the developing world states broke free from the yoke of colonialism. Despite the many decades of the nuclear age exposing the dangers and blessings of nuclear energy, atomic weapons are considered a life-line for states like Pakistan and Israel, “orphan states” in the international system, outside the U.S. nuclear umbrella.4 In this sense, the story of nuclear Pakistan is sui generis among nuclear weapon–capable states in contemporary times. Although many of its compulsions and rationales are comparable to those of other nuclear powers that earlier decided to take the same path, what would cause Pakistan to fulfill almost literally its vow to “eat grass or go hungry” in its quest for the nuclear weapon? Why and how did Pakistan stand in defiance of the world to acquire a capability described by Bernard Brodie as the “absolute weapon”?5 To understand the heart of the Pakistani quest, this study examines these and several related questions: What conditions sparked the shift from a peaceful quest to acquire nuclear energy into a full-fledged weapons program? How was the nuclear program organized? What role did outside powers play in Pakistan’s nuclear decisions? How did Pakistan overcome the many technical hurdles encountered in the process of developing nuclear weapons? Like the history of the Pakistan state, the story of Pakistan’s nuclear program is one of unwavering resolve and dedication. Pakistani senior officials tapped into the genius of young scientists and engineers and molded them into a motivated cadre of weaponeers. Building on this reservoir of talent, the program outlasted perennial political crises and persisted despite poor civil-military relations. The young nation’s leaders and scientists were united by their fascination with the new nuclear science and consciously interwove nuclear developments into the broader narrative of Pakistani nationalism. They were unwilling to allow India’s strategic developments to go unanswered, and the more assiduously the program was opposed by India and the West, the more precious it became. It evolved into the most significant symbol of national determination and a central element of Pakistan’s identity. Pakistan’s enduring rivalry and strategic competition with India turned bit\n\nIntroduction\n\nter over subsequent decades after a series of wars and crises. The last major war in  resulted in humiliating military defeat and dismemberment of Pakistan, which simply reinforced its belief that its adversaries were determined to destroy the very existence of the new state. This perception united the nationstate into a “never again” mind-set that found succor in the acquisition of a nuclear capability. However, as this book will show, there were twin causes for its national dismemberment in —external aggression and internal instability. The development of a nuclear capability and robust command system might partially address one-half of the equation—that is, deterrence against external threat from India. But Pakistan has so far failed to address the other more dangerous half that threatens national survivability—domestic dissension and internal conflict. It was Pakistan’s inability to develop a viable political system that failed to bring harmony and nationalism to a religiously homogeneous but ethnically and linguistically diverse people. Although the quest to acquire a nuclear weapons capability was fundamentally drawn from outside threats, East Pakistan’s geographical separation, with a hostile India situated between the two wings of the country, was a vulnerability waiting to be exploited.\n\nTheory and Approach Why do states pursue nuclear weapons, and how do they do so? What, if anything, is unique about the Pakistani case? The realists (neorealists) would suggest that states are concerned primarily with maximizing security.6 When faced with external threats and an unfavorable distribution of political, economic, and military capabilities with its adversaries, government officials have two fundamental options. They can either bandwagon, by accepting the dominance of the stronger state and relying on it for continued safety, or seek to “balance” against the power asymmetry and security challenge posed by the adversary. The option to bandwagon frequently requires the weaker state to compromise its national sovereignty.7 The second option can be achieved through the pursuit of alliances (external balancing) or through the development of military capabilities (internal balancing).8 According to Kenneth Waltz and Stephen Walt, states usually choose to balance against the most serious foreign threats to their security; rarely do they bandwagon—that is, accommodate or appease the powers making these threats.9 Further, defense planners generally prefer internal balancing because it leaves less to chance and less to the will of others; however, this strategy requires\n\nIntroduction\n\nlevels of national determination and resources that are beyond the reach of most countries, including Pakistan. While allies were crucial in the prenuclear era to help states fend off foreign aggression, realists recognize that nuclear weaponry has made internal balancing both more feasible and more urgent, especially to states such as Pakistan that face security threats from nuclear-armed neighbors. All nuclear weapons development programs constitute a response to insecurity and a form of balancing against foreign political or military threats. States will choose to build nuclear bombs if the pursuit of other time-honored policies—such as strengthening their conventional military capabilities, acquiring different weapons of mass destruction, or aligning with foreign powers—are either not available or insufficient to provide the security for the state.10 An alternative explanation by Jacques Hymans surmises that ideas produced by national, cultural, or individual attributes and idealist approaches can explain much about worldviews, motives, and decision-making styles of specific state leaders who engage in nuclear proliferation.11 To understand why some countries pursue nuclear deterrence—and certainly to understand how they operationalize that deterrent—one must understand the strategic culture of the country in question. The passion and fervor with which Pakistan acquired nuclear weapons are only partially explained by realism. What is necessary is to supplement realism with more fine grained predictions derived from Pakistan’s unique strategic culture— “a collectivity of the beliefs, norms, values, and historical experiences of the dominant elite in a polity that influences their understanding and interpretation of security issues and environment, and shapes their responses to these.”12 This book does not make the case that strategic culture can replace the explanatory power of realism. Rather, it argues that strategic culture is important to understand how Pakistan reacted to changes in the regional balance of power. Strategic culture stands as an important intervening variable between changes in the material bases of power and state behavior.13 “Strategic culture” is a slippery term, which presents challenges to any study employing it. The definition used in this account, proposed by respected Pakistani scholar Hasan Askari-Rizvi, argues that historical experiences have important explanatory value in the development of beliefs and in assessing how a given state responds to a given threat to national security.14 Strategic culture is the mediating lens through which national leaders view reality, which, while not permanent, is slow to change. National elites are socialized into a strategic\n\nIntroduction\n\nculture, and in the process come to share these beliefs, norms, and values. Frequently, strategic culture will be a source of constancy in the midst of a changing international environment. This study pays particular attention to assessing episodes when national leaders took decisions that would make sense only in the context of certain strategic beliefs, norms, and historical experiences. Peter R. Lavoy has chronicled a similar narrative in his history of Indian nuclear development, where he argues that Jawaharlal Nehru and Homi Bhabha played the role of “nuclear mythmakers.”15 Lavoy defined “nuclear mythmaking” as an approach adopted by national elites (mythmakers) who want government to adopt a national security strategy of acquiring nuclear weapons by emphasizing the country’s insecurity and poor international standing; portraying this strategy as the best corrective measure; articulating political, economic, and technical feasibility; successfully associating these beliefs with existing cultural norms and political priorities; and finally convincing national decisionmakers to act on these views.16 This account describes these factors as “beliefs” that grew out of existential threats in a historical narrative that was internalized through generations and that forms the inherent cognitive disposition of the people. Lavoy provides an analytical pathway as to how myths turn into strategic beliefs. He examines primary and auxiliary assertions that drive leaders to convince decision-makers and ultimately create a popular national goal. The primary beliefs are based on two levels of relationship. The first level is the relationship between nuclear weapons acquisition and the military dimension of security, which lays the foundation on which the second level develops in terms of a state’s political status and its influence in international affairs. These levels are supplemented by four auxiliary requirements, which relate to articulating political, economic, strategic, and technological feasibilities. The state must have the developed capacity to manage political problems associated with developing nuclear weapons and their impact on relations with important states; the wherewithal to meet financial costs associated with acquisition or development of nuclear technology, including the possibility for other spin-offs such as industry, agriculture, and medicine; the capability to develop operational nuclear weapons and to devise options for their effective use in military operations; and the infrastructure and capacity to overcome the numerous technical difficulties associated with developing nuclear weapons with the possibility for industrial spin-offs. When leaders acquire the capability to articulate the six interrelated factors with panache and convincing aplomb, it is\n\nIntroduction\n\na matter of time for them to become embedded in the strategic culture of the nation-state.17 The person who spearheaded the idea of nuclear Pakistan was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. In Pakistan’s early history there was no consensus about the desirability or utility of nuclear weapons. Only a few individuals, most notably Bhutto, believed that acquiring them was critical for Pakistan. However, following the devastating loss of East Pakistan in  and the Indian nuclear test in , opinions favoring nuclear weapons, held only by a minority, became national consensus—the necessity of nuclear weapons became a mainstream belief. This belief eventually determined the discourse of Pakistani nuclear thinking that evolved gradually—first into developing a nuclear weapon capability that took some twenty-five years, and later operationalizing it after being forced to demonstrate that capability. In the Indian case, the shock of losing the  war with China combined with the Chinese nuclear test at Lop Nor in  eventually led to the Indian test in .18 Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s and Indian Chief Scientist Homi Bhabha’s arguments became dominant, even though neither survived to see the ascendency of those beliefs. In the Pakistani case, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto played a similar role and nurtured the nuclear program throughout the important decade of the s. Today, there are three important strategic beliefs regarding nuclear weapons that were largely absent when Bhutto took power in  but have since become dominant in Pakistani strategic thought. First, nuclear weapons are the only guarantee of Pakistan’s national survival in the face of both an inveterately hostile India that cannot be deterred conventionally and unreliable external allies that fail to deliver in extremis. Second, Pakistan’s nuclear program is unfairly singled out for international opposition because of its Muslim population. This feeling of victimization is accentuated by a belief that India consistently “gets away with” violating global nonproliferation norms. Third is the belief that India, Israel, or the United States might use military force to stop Pakistan’s nuclear program. Today, these three beliefs—nuclear necessity for survival, international discrimination against Pakistan, and danger of disarming attacks—form the center of Pakistani strategic thinking about nuclear weapons. Collectively, these convictions have served to reinforce the determination of Pakistan’s military, bureaucratic, and scientific establishment to pay any political, economic, or technical cost to reach their objective of a nuclear-armed Pakistan. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was able to capture this all-encompassing narrative even\n\nIntroduction\n\nbefore there was any national consensus on the nuclear matter. As far back as , he famously told the Manchester Guardian: “If India makes an atom bomb, then even if we have to feed on grass and leaves—or even if we have to starve—we shall also produce an atom bomb as we would be left with no other alternative. The answer to an atom bomb can only be an atom bomb.”19 He continued to push for nuclear developments as foreign minister in the s and played a critical role during his period as national leader in the s. By the time he was removed from power in , his thinking on nuclear matters had been institutionalized throughout the establishment. Ample patrons in the military, bureaucracy, and scientific communities would ensure the nuclear program’s success in the s and s. Today the national narrative around the need for nuclear weapons is intertwined with Pakistani nationalism to a level that it is almost treasonous to think otherwise.\n\nNuclear Themes While it is too strong a statement to say that every nuclear state has the same historical experience, it is useful to highlight the similarities. Underneath the unique strategic beliefs of Pakistan are several themes that are similar to those found in the histories of other nuclear aspirants. Three threads interweave through the fabrics of many nuclear weapons acquisition stories: national humiliation, international isolation, and national identity. When Pakistanis look back on their history, these themes are recurrent and provide a conceptual foundation from which specific strategic beliefs emerge.\n\nNational Humiliation At the core of the nuclear weapons acquisition narrative rests national humiliation—the phrase “never again” is repeated over and over in nuclear histories. For many nations, fears produced by past humiliations are frequently reinforced by concerns about nuclear blackmail. The Soviet Union, after experiencing the ravages of invading Nazi armies, refused to accept the danger that came from an American nuclear monopoly.20 China’s nuclear ambitions were fueled by a century of foreign interference, a brutal Japanese occupation, and U.S. nuclear threats in the s.21 India’s national humiliation stemmed from colonial subjugation, an embarrassing defeat in its border war with China in , and strategic disparity following the Chinese nuclear test at Lop Nor in .22 Israel is a state created to ensure that “never again” would the Jewish\n\nIntroduction\n\npeople face risk of national extermination, and nuclear weapons became perceived increasingly as central to that requirement in the context of enduring Arab-Israeli enmity.23 For Pakistan, the memories—both firsthand and passed down—of the fall of Dhaka, the loss of East Pakistan, and the capture of ninety thousand prisoners of war by India are seared into the collective memory. The tragedies of  left Pakistan reeling, and were followed by the subsequent blow of the  Indian nuclear test. Together, these events allowed nuclear enthusiasts to take charge and led to the ascendance of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and his belief in the necessity of nuclear arms. Nuclear weapon efforts were redoubled after India’s underground explosion at Pokhran three years later. The asymmetry in strategic capability between India and Pakistan reinforced the feeling of insecurity that had lingered after Dhaka’s fall. The Pakistani nuclear weapons program was the only way to prevent such humiliation in the future and to preserve Pakistan. “Never again” would Pakistan be subject to disgrace at the hands of others.\n\nInternational Isolation Some nuclear weapons states find themselves on the receiving end of international demonization, which serves only to buttress national resolve to develop advanced technology. While the Russian experience was somewhat different—it is difficult to call a nascent superpower isolated—the USSR was the target of Western castigation for its socialist way of life. Nuclear weapons were not only a security imperative but also proof to the West of Soviet scientific advancement. China found itself ideologically disconnected not just from Western foes but also, and increasingly, from its former Soviet patrons. Israel faced opprobrium from much of the postcolonial world, and criticisms grew as Soviet-backed pan-Arabism emerged as an important political force in the s. Many nuclear aspirants are also harshly reminded that to the extent they have international support, such support is insufficient or, more often, ephemeral during periods of profound political crisis. Israel’s early history showed that the United States would subordinate Israel’s interests during periods of tension in an attempt to maintain stability between the superpowers. Israel’s battlefield successes in – and  occurred with little foreign support. Soviet backing did little to ease Chinese hardships in Korea or to face U.S. threats in other crises regarding Taiwan in . Tensions between Soviet Pre\n\nIntroduction\n\nmier Nikita Khrushchev and Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong grew in the mid-s, ultimately leading to the cessation of Soviet assistance to the Chinese nuclear program in . India found itself isolated: it initially received neither U.S. nor Soviet assistance in its  war with China. Delhi’s calculations had gone woefully wrong when its forward policy on the disputed territory provoked a border war with China. But, unfortunately for India, it occurred simultaneously with the Cuban Missile Crisis between the two Cold War superpowers. Following China’s nuclear test in , India’s hawks began to dominate the debate. The mood of the nation was summed up in a famous speech of renowned Indian scientist Homi Bhabha: “[A]tomic weapons give a State possessing them in adequate numbers a deterrent power against attack from a much stronger State.”24 Eventually the bomb lobby in India would prevail, while India continued to believe it was on its own. In , India was disgusted that the United States had cut off aid to both India and Pakistan, despite Delhi’s belief that Pakistan was the aggressor in the five-week-long Second Kashmir War. For Pakistanis, history showed that outsiders would not assist them in confronting security threats, particularly during the periods of most pressing need. Pakistan’s alliance with the United States provided no benefit in the  war and proved traumatically insufficient to stop military defeat in East Pakistan in . While Pakistan entered into an alliance with the United States primarily to answer the Indian threat, the United States viewed the alliance solely through the prism of superpower competition and had little interest in Pakistan’s fears about India. Similarly, Pakistan’s all-weather friendship with China translated into little material support for Pakistan when it counted most, in either the  or  wars. After Pakistan embarked seriously on the nuclear path, it increasingly was the focus of Western proliferation concerns. Conspiracy theories that Pakistan was being targeted for its “Muslimness” grew, along with resentment. This perception of international isolation only served to reinforce the Pakistani state’s devotion to achieving nuclear self-sufficiency.\n\nNational Identity Most nuclear programs are not initiated with national identity as a driving factor, but often they eventually become integral to national self-perception and are thus perpetuated by their symbolic place in national identity. Sacrifices associated with the nuclear program made in the face of international opposition, combined with the belief that nuclear weapons are the only answer to\n\nIntroduction\n\nprevent future humiliation, confer symbolic meaning upon the nation’s sense of self. By , all five permanent members of the UN Security Council were recognized as nuclear weapons states by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and nuclear weapons were perceived as the currency of international power. “Mythmakers,” be they Chinese, Indian, or Pakistani, often argued that nuclear weapons were necessary not simply to check aggression but also to wield greater influence on the global scene. This perception is well captured by Mao’s statement to senior Chinese officials in  that, without nuclear weapons, “others don’t think what we say carries weight.”25 Moreover, the scientific, technical, and logistical challenge of nuclear development elicits pride in societies that are able to harness their national potential to join what is arguably the most elite club in the world. Especially for countries that might have quite a mixed bag of indicators of modernity and progress, nuclear weapons are a potent symbol of the national scientific establishment’s strength. This achievement is then typically employed by national elites in their effort to gain political legitimacy and influence at home. In Pakistan, the contrast between its status as a semi-industrialized developing country and its technological expertise was particularly striking, especially for those involved in the nuclear weapons development efforts. N. M. Butt, a retired Pakistani nuclear physicist, took pride in the fact that Pakistan’s nuclear developments occurred in “an ocean of ignorance” in a country that possessed “lame high technology.”26 A. Q. Khan boasted of Pakistan’s success in uranium enrichment: “A country which could not make sewing needles, good bicycles or even ordinary durable metalled roads was embarking on one of the latest and most difficult technologies.”27 Pakistan’s sense of national identity has a complex relationship with its Islamic identity. The perception that Pakistan is a victim of discrimination—that the world is opposed uniquely to an “Islamic bomb”—became a source of pride. Of the Muslim polities, only Pakistan has managed to cross the nuclear threshold. This nuclear accomplishment gave Pakistan certain preeminence in the Islamic world. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the force behind the nuclear program, pivoted Pakistani foreign policy to enhance ties to other Muslim countries. Moreover, Bhutto adroitly leveraged these relationships to garner financial support for Pakistan’s nuclear program. Such global prominence, in Pakistani thought, harkened back to past civilizational glory, to the time when the Mughal Empire shared the global stage with the Safavids and the Ottomans. Additionally, for Pakistan, a country conflicted over 10\n\nIntroduction\n\nwhether it is a secular or theological Muslim state, nuclear weapons were a symbol of cohesion—they became one of the few issues about which there was national consensus.\n\nChapter Summary and Roadmap This book divides Pakistan’s nuclear history into five phases. Part I recounts Pakistan’s early days, when its fragile domestic political state was devoid of leadership in the face of emerging rivalry with India. Pakistan was barely surviving when the United States found a strategic ally by virtue of its geographical location and U.S. compulsion to “contain” the communist threat. Under these circumstances, Pakistan found new life as a member of U.S.-led military alliances. President Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace program through the s fascinated the young nation and influenced the creation of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). Pakistani youth, under the vision of the father of the nation, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, were determined to acquire knowledge, and the new science was the greatest source of excitement. This part delves into the initial reluctance of Pakistani leaders to pursue a nuclear weapons program. President Ayub Khan kept the program focused on peaceful civilian purposes in the s, much to the consternation of his young, hawkish foreign minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The most prosperous period of Pakistan’s history began to crash with decisions that led to war with India, diminished the alliance with the United States, and gave birth to the bomb lobby around the time the world was debating the most famous treaty of the nuclear age—the NPT. This part ends with Chapter , which recounts the disastrous  war with India, the ascent of Bhutto to national leadership, and Bhutto’s call to Pakistani nuclear scientists to begin a weapons development program in a meeting in Multan in January . Part II examines the subsequent steps taken by Pakistani leaders and scientists to develop a full-fledged nuclear research and development program. Pakistan’s early, multipronged, and somewhat disjointed efforts to obtain fissile material were given greater urgency following the Indian nuclear explosive test in . More important, the PAEC’s attempts to secure a plutonium-based fuel cycle were stymied by the international nonproliferation regime. In fact, following the Indian nuclear test, the regime was focused not on India but on stopping Pakistan from following suit as a means to stall the cascading effect on nonproliferation. The more India’s nuclear activities were tolerated, the more 11\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe Pakistani sense of discrimination grew, captured in Chapter , “Punishing Pakistan.” Under these circumstances Pakistan developed the front end of the fuel cycle and established the road to nuclear ambition. The program was developing at a slow pace, but institutions and infrastructures grew steadily. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto then recruited A. Q. Khan to develop a uranium enrichment capability, whose mastery by a developing country was a revolution of sorts in the nuclear world. Despite global export controls, two related but distinct procurement networks emerged to meet the needs of the PAEC’s plutonium route and the uranium route of the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL). The procurement was possible in the grey areas of nuclear trade and evolved into one of the most troubling tales in the history of nuclear weapons: that of the A. Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network. The penultimate chapter of Part II describes the scientific, technical, and experimental work necessary to develop a nuclear weapon design. Chapter  describes the slow reemergence of the plutonium fuel cycle, which was initially blocked in the s but became increasingly important to Pakistan’s nuclear developments in the late s and s. Part III of the book narrates the steps taken in the s and s to weaponize Pakistan’s nuclear devices and develop delivery means, culminating in the May  tests in the Chagai Hills. This part also covers a complex historical phase of the country under the military regime of General Zia-ul-Haq. In this period, Pakistan’s ideological character was redefined in more theological terms—a shift away from the founder Jinnah’s vision of Pakistan. The interplay between the domestic dimension and regional and international shifts made Pakistan a central player in the Cold War battlefront in Afghanistan in the s. Religious zealots were armed in the name of faith to defeat the infidel Soviet forces in Afghanistan by waging jihad through asymmetric guerrilla war. The Soviets were eventually defeated, and the Cold War ended. In this period three nuclear-tinged military crises and near-wars occurred with India, while the nascent nuclear weapons program continued apace. Production of fissile material was achieved, and the program’s focus shifted to acquiring delivery systems. Chapter  examines the multiple routes Pakistan explored to acquire an ensured capability—including fighter aircraft and liquid- and solid-fuel missiles—to deliver nuclear weapons to enemy targets. When the aircraft route became stalled as a result of nuclear sanctions, the effort shifted to ballistic missiles. Pakistan struggled to sustain its covert nuclear program in the face of sanctions and the emergence of post–Cold War norms 12\n\nIntroduction\n\nand arms control. Pakistan’s nuclear capability had not been demonstrated, but Islamabad was under intense diplomatic pressure to cap and roll back the program to mitigate crippling sanctions. Pakistan faced the choice of “eating grass or giving up the bomb.” Part III ends with India’s mid-May  surprise test and the Pakistani government’s decision to respond in kind, and the national euphoria following the success of the late-May Pakistani tests. Part IV describes the steps taken after  to turn Pakistan’s nascent nuclear weapons program into an operational deterrent. Once again Pakistan transitioned from a decade of democracy to a military government under General Pervez Musharraf. Chapter  explores why nearly three decades of U.S.-led nonproliferation policies failed to prevent Pakistan from going nuclear, and concludes by examining the burst of U.S. diplomatic activity at the end of the Clinton administration aimed at restraining post-test nuclear deployments in South Asia. This new nuclear environment evolves in the context of two serious crises with India and major steps taken by Pakistan in  and  to institutionalize command and control over its nuclear arsenal. Chapter  examines a – military standoff and explores what role nuclear weapons played in the resolution of these crises. By the end of the Musharraf era, Pakistan’s thinking on nuclear doctrine and force posture had developed substantially, and this planning is described as Part IV closes. Part V identifies the challenges facing Pakistan today. Chapter  returns to the A. Q. Khan network and explains how Khan converted the import network he had overseen into an export enterprise that culminated in an international scandal as the network unraveled. The chapter reveals a view from inside Pakistan as to how the network activities came to light under the command and control system, what led to Khan’s removal from KRL, and how the nuclear trafficking activity moved away from Pakistan into the world—vulnerable and waiting to be unraveled. The impact of the network on Pakistan and the consequences for nonproliferation continued to haunt Pakistan, especially after the United States offered a lucrative nuclear deal to India and continued to isolate Pakistan. The book concludes with Chapter  by examining Pakistan’s role in the new nuclear order. It provides an overview of how Pakistan is managing its nuclear arsenal following a return to civilian rule in Islamabad, while it faces unparalleled terrorist and insurgent threats. Pakistan’s nuclear future will be determined within the overall context of strategic stability in South Asia. As In13\n\nIntroduction\n\ndia and Pakistan both pursue conventional and strategic force modernization, there is a potential arms race in the making. Which nuclear future will prevail is unknown. This book tells the story of Pakistan’s pursuit of the bomb in the light of the wisdom of an old African proverb: “If you wish to know where you are going to go in the future, you must first know where you have come from.”\n\n14\n\n2\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nIn , in the aftermath of the armistice on the Korean Peninsula and the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s death, the new U.S. administration under President Dwight Eisenhower reconsidered the policy of “containment” regarding the Soviet Union. Worried about an escalating arms race with a rising nuclear power, Eisenhower attempted rapprochement with the new Soviet administration. In his famous “Chance for Peace” speech he offered an olive branch, but his efforts proved futile; the Cold War between the USSR and the United States deepened.1 The Eisenhower administration then adopted a more aggressive policy of “containing” the communists’ potential global expansion. Washington was eyeing the periphery of Eurasia for strategic alliances, and Pakistan’s strategic location atop the Indian Ocean caught its attention. Pakistan, a six-year-old sovereign state, was yet to evolve as a nation. Nevertheless, when the newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles planned a visit to Asia, the New York Times favorably described Pakistan as “developing an Eastern area of substantial strength, which can be vital to the whole of the free world.”2 The Dominion of Pakistan, however, was still reeling from the violent partition of India during its independence from the British Empire in . The country was in tatters—communal riots, political instability, ethnic rivalries, mass migrations of Muslims and Hindus, and a lack of basic needs had hindered nation-building and civilian rule. At the same time that the glowing Times editorial appeared on January , , Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafrullah Khan was at the U.S. State Department pleading for emergency food aid.3 At this crossroads, between a new nation heading toward its demise and U.S. Cold War exigencies demanding military alliances and “containment,” arrived Atoms for Peace, promising atomic energy technology for all nations willing to forgo the development of nuclear weapons. On December , , President Eisenhower stood before the UN General Assembly and outlined his Atoms for 17\n\nThe Reluctant Phase\n\nPeace proposal. He sought to address the global challenges posed by nuclear science and technology in a bipolar thermonuclear age.4 The new technology was seen as a panacea by the struggling Pakistan, a way toward economic development, legitimacy, and nationhood.\n\nA Moth-Eaten and Truncated Muslim State In the spring of  the wounds of partition were still visible in the young Pakistani state.5 The dream of a Muslim homeland in South Asia appeared in doubt. Leaders in India saw Pakistan as temporary, nonviable, and likely to collapse. Even Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy, who oversaw the partition of British India, had predicted that the new nation of Pakistan would more closely resemble a tent, or nissen hut, than a permanent building. By that time, the sixyear-old country was an orphan. Governor-General Mohammad Ali Jinnah— the Quaid-e-Azam (“Great Leader”)—and his chosen prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan—the Quaid-e-Millat (“Leader of the Nation”)—had passed from the scene. The founding father of Pakistan, Jinnah succumbed to illness in September , having governed Pakistan for just over a year of its independent existence. A Pashtun gunman assassinated Liaquat Ali in . Their departure left a void in Pakistan’s leadership that, to some extent, was never filled.6 In this period of political turmoil, Pakistan was still struggling to formulate a written constitution and to unite its various factions. Partition from India and independence ought to have brought an end to communal violence between Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs, but Britain’s hasty and “shameful flight” from the subcontinent created new and more intractable problems.7 Lord Mountbatten had rushed the process of independence along at an absurd pace. The viceroy’s worst blunder was the impetuous drawing of new borderlines through the middle of Punjab and Bengal. The trauma of partition had left Pakistan structurally and geophysically vulnerable to India. Three issues were at the root of Pakistan’s animosity toward its neighbor. First, the new border, as drawn, was perceived as neither fair nor just, and the partition’s manner of execution led to horrible consequences that continued to affect future generations. For example, Jinnah lamented that the border demarcation had left a “truncated and moth-eaten” Pakistan, with vulnerable and arbitrary boundaries.8 Further still, no one expected that the partition would be accompanied by such bloodshed and widespread migration, as more than  million refugees from minority communities on both sides of the new border sought 18\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nto relocate to the other, hundreds of thousands dying in the process.9 Second, the division of civil and military assets had been inequitable. Pakistan had been expected to get one-fourth of the cash balance of rupees, but India held back and delayed, making excuses. The military division was even more acute. Pakistan received no more than  percent of its share of ordnance stores, and neither tanks nor ammunition was ever delivered. Pakistan’s perception that India was foot-dragging on completing the division of assets reinforced the Pakistani belief that India was not reconciled to partition and was betting on failure for the infant state. In Pakistan’s view, the third and most glaring example of injustice was the accession of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir to India by its Hindu ruler, which led to the First Kashmir War in  and would become a casus belli for decades to come. Domestically, Pakistan was bursting from within, facing immense challenges to national consolidation and its identity. A hostile India separated the two wings, East and West Pakistan, by a distance of a thousand miles. East Pakistanis, predominantly Muslim Bengalis, were agitated with the West Pakistanis over a host of issues, but most importantly over nonacceptance of their native language, Bengali, as a national language.10 Following Liaquat’s death in , a Bengali politician, Khawaja Nazimuddin, had taken over as prime minister. Governor-General Ghulam Mohammad then sacked Prime Minister Nazimuddin in April , believing him to be too weak to shepherd Pakistan’s government during that critical period, and replaced him with another Bengali, Mohammad Ali Bogra. Despite having two consecutive Bengali prime ministers following Liaquat’s assassination, East Bengal nevertheless felt disrespected by the ruling elites in Karachi and Lahore. After all, Bengalis noted, Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, was the  birthplace of the All India Muslim League and, in , the first city to raise a voice for the preservation of Muslim rights when the British rulers revoked the  partition of Bengal under Hindu pressure, redividing the province along linguistic lines. In , the Bengalis took to the streets to call for, among other demands, Bengali as the second national language in addition to Urdu.11 Language riots the previous year had left many dead on the streets of Dhaka and Chittagong, East Pakistan’s largest port city. In West Pakistan, there was unrest on the streets of Lahore, the cultural and commercial capital of Punjab. Pakistan’s most resource-rich and fertile province, Punjab braced itself for violence once again, barely six years after Mountbatten’s vivisection of the province. Angry Muslim clerics began to target the Ahmadi community, a religious sect that venerated a nineteenth-century 19\n\nThe Reluctant Phase\n\nprophet named Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was castigated by orthodox Muslims.12 The religious schism flared to national prominence. Free from the Hindus and Sikhs, who had fled western Punjab, Muslims now wanted the removal of Jinnah’s handpicked foreign minister, Sir Zafarullah Khan, an Ahmadi, by declaring the Ahmadi sect as non-Muslim and Khan hence unfit for office.13 Pakistani Punjab prepared itself for another bloodbath, barely six years after witnessing the bloodiest migration in human history. Pakistan’s military was called in and martial law declared in Punjab, foreshadowing the limits of civilian authority and more declarations of martial law in the decades to come.14 Other separatist forces threatened Pakistan. Baluchistan, a tribal preserve on the brink of armed resistance against the state, simmered with rebellion. The Baluchis had reluctantly accepted the new federal order; however, they failed to understand its implications and were unable to give up their antiquated tribal system (Sardari). For example, the country’s biggest natural gas field had been discovered in Sui, Baluchistan, the previous year. From the Baluchis’ perspective, the Punjabi-dominated central government was milking and exploiting their resources.15 Rather than becoming a source of strength and prosperity, therefore, the gas field became a source of grievance, lending strength to many insurgencies to follow. The Sindh province also became a hotbed of ethnic and socioeconomic unrest. Sindhis had hoped for a better future in modern Pakistan as its feudal lords (waderas) maximized their gains after the departure of the Hindus. But Muslim immigrants from India (muhajir) chose to settle predominantly in Sindh. These “New Sindhis” settled mainly in urban areas, especially in Hyderabad and the port city of Karachi. Karachi, the national capital, was made a federal district, which was perceived as robbing the best of Sindh from Sindhis.16 Migration southward of Punjabis and Pashtuns into Sindh added salt to the wounds, creating further alienation among the Sindhis. In Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province (NWFP), disenchanted Pashtuns demanded the return of Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan’s provincial government. Popularly known as Dr. Khan Sahib, he was the brother of Ghaffar Khan, leader of the populist Red Shirt (Khudai-Khidmat) movement. Ghaffar Khan, the “Frontier Gandhi,” had led a Pashtun nationalist movement in opposition to the creation of Pakistan, with support and sympathy from Afghanistan and India’s Congress Party.17 Pashtuns demanded their province be named Pashtunistan after their ethnic identity, rather than after a cardinal direction. 20\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nAlso in , across the wild borderlands of western Pakistan, King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan appointed his cousin, Mohammad Daoud Khan, as prime minister. Daoud, who vowed to unite the Pashtuns under a single Pashtunistan banner, questioned the contours of the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Kabul had always refused to accept Pakistan as a successor state to the British, had voted against its membership in the United Nations in , and in  had unilaterally revoked the  border agreement it had made with the British Empire. Pakistan’s newly inherited mountainous western border was now disputed, porous, tribal, and lawless. Although Afghanistan remained a buffer against Cold War communist expansion—just as it had shielded British India from the southerly expansion of the czars in the nineteenth century—the last thing Pakistan desired was an unsettled western neighbor as it prepared to face its principal rival, India.18 Meanwhile, in the same year, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) successfully toppled the Mossadeq government in Iran in a coup, returning the pro-Western Reza Shah Pahlavi to the throne in Tehran. For the next two decades, the Pahlavi dynasty would ensure the smooth flow of oil to the West and act as a Western bridgehead in the strategic Persian Gulf. The ripple effects of developments in Iran would be felt in Pakistan far into the future. While Iranian Shia clerics, alienated from the Western-influenced elites in Tehran, gained sympathy among Pakistani Shia, under the shah the relationship between Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey would grow into an organization called the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD). This partnership would also form the centerpiece of a U.S.-backed military alliance (the Central Treaty Organization, or CENTO) against communist expansion.\n\nPakistan and the Early Cold War Oblivious to the chaotic situation within and around Pakistan, the Eisenhower administration was eager to explore Pakistan’s strength and abilities. When Secretary Dulles made his visit to South Asia in May , he found an anxious Pakistani leadership willing not only to cooperate but also to enthusiastically make available its “potential both in manpower and bases.” The Americans were impressed with the “martial and religious qualities of the Pakistanis, especially its military leader General Muhammad Ayub Khan,” even though they noted that the political situation was disordered.19 Dulles was convinced of finding in Pakistan “one country with a moral courage to do its part in resisting 21\n\nThe Reluctant Phase\n\ncommunism.” Army Chief Ayub Khan took it upon himself to commence the foundations of a military alliance. His visit to the United States in September  would be the “turning point” in laying the foundation for probably the most critical and enigmatic military relationship during the Cold War and one that has continued through the post-/ world order.20 Vice President Richard Nixon’s trip to Karachi followed a visit to New Delhi, where Nixon found Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru “the least friendly leader he had met in Asia.”21 With Pakistan, however, Nixon was impressed. “Pakistan is a country I would do anything for. The people have less complexes than the Indians.”22 At another occasion he remarked, “The Pakistanis are completely frank even when it hurts.”23 In the year following Nixon’s visit, the United States began assisting Pakistan’s armed forces with training and equipment for new infantry battalions, an armored division, and modern aircraft. In  and  Pakistan became a formal member of two U.S.-led alliances, the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Baghdad Pact—later, CENTO.24 SEATO was formed in Manila in September, in the midst of the Taiwan Straits crises. During the preparation for the pact, Pakistan wanted the SEATO shield to cover aggression from all quarters (namely India), not just from communist states. Dulles refused and even added an explicit clarification to the treaty that it would deal only with communist aggression and that the United States had no interest in embroiling the alliance in India-Pakistan disputes. Inside Pakistan, the military was skeptical of any benefit from the final treaty, given its failure to address India.25 Throughout , the modalities of the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance were under discussion as the United States agreed to strengthen the Pakistan Army. General Ayub Khan assured the U.S. leadership that Pakistan did not want dominance over India; it wanted only to protect itself. During Ayub Khan’s interaction with U.S. military leadership, he explained that Pakistan was vulnerable to communist and Indian pressure, as well as suffering from internal difficulties. The alliance should therefore have a proportionate distribution of sacrifice. Further, Pakistan had a crushing financial burden, especially in relation to its defense expenditure.26 It was clear to the two countries by now that while an alliance was mutually beneficial, they had divergent objectives. Those same years saw U.S. debate regarding the bolstered Pakistani military’s impact on India’s security. To placate India, Eisenhower issued a policy statement pledging that any aid to Pakistan misused for aggression would result in “appropriate action” by the United States and the United Nations. Pakistani 22\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nPrime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra recognized this limitation and responded in turn that Pakistan would not provide bases or any other military facilities to the United States. However the military, led by Ayub Khan, knew the tremendous boost that American-led military outposts would provide to Pakistan’s security. The risk of housing the bases, of course, was reaction from communist countries, as well as neutral countries such as Egypt.27 Indeed, the Soviets reacted sharply to the U.S.-Pakistan alliance and courted India and Afghanistan by supporting their resentments toward Pakistan. Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s request for military aid from Washington was rebuffed. Kabul then reached out to Moscow, which obliged. Pakistan now was sandwiched between two officially nonaligned countries but de facto allies of the Soviet Union. In November , Soviet leaders Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev visited Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, and declared that Kashmir belonged to India, adding fuel to the regional rivalry. Thus India had secured a Soviet veto in the United Nations against any resolution on Kashmir.28 A significant development took place in . In April an Afro-Asian Summit was held at Bandung, Indonesia, that provided Pakistan with an opportunity to initiate high-level contacts with the countries vying for leadership in the nonaligned world. Here, Pakistan and China recognized their importance to each other. Sensing an emerging nexus between Moscow, Kabul, and Delhi, Pakistan could not afford to alienate China. At the same time, Chinese Prime Minister Chou En-lai was quick to realize the significance of Pakistan in China’s national security.29 Pakistan’s alliance with the United States was China’s ticket to improved national security, given Pakistan’s shared border with China’s volatile Muslim-majority Xinchiang province and their shared competition with India. Pakistani Prime Minister Bogra requested a meeting with Chou En-lai to explain that Pakistan’s membership in SEATO was not directed at China. Chou En-lai immediately understood and responded that he would call upon Bogra that afternoon.30 This meeting marked the beginning of what would become an “all weather friendship” between China and Pakistan. Compelled by geographical location, regional threats, and domestic politics, a weak and fragile Pakistan had chosen to play power politics. It was, however, caught in a catch-: Pakistan’s survivability now depended on alliance with the United States, yet keeping all of its eggs in the American basket would risk alienating China. Pakistan’s dilemma at this juncture was analogous to Israel’s, where the centrality of the United States was deemed essential for national sur23\n\nThe Reluctant Phase\n\nvival, yet the “necessity of locating an alternative partner” was also felt. France had provided that partner in the early s.31 In its search for security and survival, Pakistan ensured its national security by making use of a two-pronged approach: engaging in external balancing through its alliances with the United States and China, as well as its dependence on international institutions such as the United Nations; and engaging in internal balancing through the formation of professional armed forces that would meet both external and internal military threats. As time passed, however, Pakistan found international institutions capricious and alliances unreliable. Bolstered by such realizations, Pakistan determined that only by matching India’s threats could its security be ensured. This acute sense of insecurity and isolation became a central tenet of its security policy. Subsequent events in the region reinforced Pakistani vulnerabilities.32 Facing a constellation of outside foes and domestic threats, Pakistan was confronted early on with the challenge of balancing between the dictates of national security and the demands for economic development—a dilemma the country has continually struggled with throughout its independent history.\n\nAtoms for Peace President Eisenhower was conscious of the danger of nuclear proliferation. “Atomic realities of today comprehend two facts of great significance,” he said in his  Atoms for Peace speech. “First, the knowledge now possessed by several nations will eventually be shared by others—possibly all others. Second even a vast superiority of weapons and a consequent capability of devastating retaliation, is no preventive, of itself . . . . “[L]et no one think that vast sums for weapons and systems of defense can guarantee absolute safety.”33 Going on, he categorically stated, “[T]he United States pledges before you—and therefore before the whole world—its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma—to devote its entire heart and mind to find a way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.” He added, “[If] the fearful trend of atomic military buildup can be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed . . . to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind.”34 Consequently, in August  the United States modified the U.S. Atomic Energy Act to allow for nuclear assistance and technology transfer just when the U.S.-Pakistan relationship was being forged. This was a radical departure from the previous American policy of nuclear secrecy. At the time, the United 24\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nStates led the world in nuclear science and technology, and while the idea of sharing was noble, it would become the engine for transfer of essential knowhow for future proliferant states. Under Atoms for Peace, the United States supplied research reactors to forty countries and the highly enriched uranium needed to fuel them.35 The plan, which allowed the United States to transfer nuclear technology and materials to countries that pledged not to use this assistance for nuclear weapons manufacturing, simultaneously would “strengthen American world leadership and disprove the Communists’ propaganda charges that the United States is concerned solely with the destructive uses of the atom.”36 In the following year, the United States called for an International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, under the auspices of the United Nations. Some twenty-five thousand participants attended this meeting, which was the largest scientific conference at the time. Two prominent scientists from South Asia played leading roles in the event. The conference was presided over by an Indian physicist and founder of the Indian nuclear program, Homi Bhabha, while a Pakistani scientist, Abdus Salam, who would be Nobel laureate, served as the scientific secretary.37 The Pakistani press welcomed the proposed assistance for peaceful uses of atomic energy. Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafarullah Khan, who a year earlier had knocked at the door of the State Department seeking emergency food aid, lobbied for the new technology by reassuring the West that Pakistan was not interested in developing an atomic bomb.38 A U.S. Atoms for Peace exhibit team visited Pakistan in , which greatly helped spread awareness in the young country about the benefits of nuclear technology for socioeconomic development.39 The U.S. Agency for International Development also displayed a large exhibit at the New Delhi Trade Fair that included a thirty-foot-high reactor diagram, “hot” laboratories, and many working models of nuclear power reactors.40 The developing world was impressed with this new science and its availability. But as Pakistan was poor, underdeveloped, and unstable, thoughts of its going nuclear were far away. Nevertheless, the “new science” excited young Pakistani students more than did the other more established fields.41 Partition did not evenly divide the subcontinent’s scientific capital, just as other elements of national power had been unjustly distributed. As early as , in part because of the urging from Indian Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian National Congress, the British government supported the establishment of the Indian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which oversaw sev25\n\nThe Reluctant Phase\n\neral national laboratories throughout India.42 After the partition, however, the Council and the laboratories were all located on the Indian side of the dividing line.43 During Pakistan’s early years, issues of national survival, not scientific progress, occupied Pakistan’s leaders. So it was not until October  that Pakistan’s minister for industries announced a plan for the establishment of a national atomic research unit as part of a new body for scientific and industrial research in Pakistan, whose name was copied from its Indian progenitor: the Pakistan Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR).44 Although important, this body was not initially a major contributor to the emerging nuclear infrastructure.45 Instead, the history of the first decade of Pakistan’s nuclear endeavors is the story of a trio of Cambridge-educated physicists, who would build institutions and, equally important, identify and train the next generation of Pakistani scientists. In , Dr. Rafi Mohammad Chaudhry oversaw the formation of the “High Tension Laboratory” in the Physics Department of Government College, Lahore, in order to carry out nuclear research. Chaudhry, both as an institution-builder and teacher, proved to be one of the most influential figures in creating the scientific foundation for Pakistan’s subsequent nuclear efforts.46 He had trained under Ernest Rutherford, the leading British nuclear physicist of his era, at the renowned Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University, completing his dissertation in .47 Chaudhry had returned to India, becoming head of the Physics Department at Aligarh University, the preeminent Muslim higher education institution in what is now the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. At the time of partition, Mark Oliphant—a leading Australian physicist who worked with Rutherford and Rafi Chaudhry in Cambridge—corresponded with Pakistan’s founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, and suggested to him that he hire Chaudhry. Apparently in response to Oliphant’s advice, Jinnah worked to secure Chaudhry a position at Government College, Lahore, in , when Chaudhry migrated from India to Pakistan.48 As early as , Prof. Rafi Chaudhry constructed a particle accelerator at the university, a larger version of a model designed by British physicists John D. Cockcroft and Ernest Walton at Cavendish Laboratory in the mid-s. Upon its completion, the .-megavolt accelerator was perhaps the most advanced nuclear accelerator in Asia.49 He also founded the High Tension Laboratory in  and remained its head until . During his tenure at Government College, Lahore, he would oversee the training of many of Pakistan’s best physicists, earning him the title of ustadon-ka-ustad (“teacher of teachers”) in the 26\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nscientific community.50 Throughout his career and well into his retirement, he earned a variety of awards for that work. When one of his students, Munir Ahmed Khan, subsequently introduced him to President Zia-ul-Haq in , the military dictator raised his hand and saluted Chaudhry for his contributions to Pakistan’s nuclear development. For a few years in the early s, Chaudhry was a colleague of another brilliant, Cambridge-educated Pakistani physicist, Abdus Salam. Salam, who would become the first Muslim and first Pakistani to receive the Nobel Prize in physics, in , for his work on the interaction between particles, studied at Cambridge several years after Chaudhry.51 Upon finishing his graduate studies in Great Britain, he returned to Pakistan in . As a rising star, he received faculty appointments at both Government College, Lahore, and Punjab University. Salam considered himself a devout Muslim, though he belonged to the Ahmadi sect. He was disheartened to see, upon his arrival, his birth province in the throes of anti-Ahmadi riots. Salam was also appalled at the grim state of affairs in Pakistan, particularly in the field of science. He had returned to Pakistan hoping to establish a world-class scientific institute but quickly concluded that Pakistan was not yet ready for such a venture. In a retrospective essay, he wrote, “Of indigenous science and technology, or indeed of any technological manpower development, there was neither need, nor appreciation, nor role . . . . In that extreme isolation in Lahore, where no physics literature ever penetrated, with no international contacts whatsoever, and with no other physicists around in the whole country, I was a total misfit. In no uncertain terms, it was made plain to me that my dream of founding a school of research in physics was to remain a dream.” By , he had decided that institution building was best done outside of Pakistan. Nevertheless, throughout his life he would continue to advise the Pakistan government on nuclear matters, serve on Pakistani scientific and research bodies, and regularly scout for talented Pakistani students that could advance physics in Pakistan. If Chaudhry at root was an educator, and Salam a scientist, the third member of the Cambridge trio can be summarized as an administrator, albeit a controversial one. Nazir Ahmad, like Chaudhry and Salam, also undertook his graduate education in the United Kingdom at the Cavendish Laboratory under Rutherford’s guidance. A few years older than Chaudhry (Nazir Ahmad and Rafi Chaudhry were decades older than Salam), Nazir Ahmad finished his Ph.D. at Cambridge in , after which he returned to India.52 The job prospects for even accomplished physics graduates in British India were limited, 27\n\nThe Reluctant Phase\n\nand Nazir Ahmad’s initial appointments were at the laboratory associated with the Central Cotton Committee of India. He moved to a series of economic appointments in the mid-s, and, after partition, he served in Pakistan’s planning and economic development bureaucracy. His physics background did not go unnoticed by the new state, however, and he continued to advise on nuclear matters. In , he led Pakistan’s delegation to the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva. Upon his return, and in response to the U.S. Atoms for Peace initiative, Pakistan decided to upgrade its ad hoc nuclear activities by creating a more formal Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) with Nazir Ahmed as its first chairman.53 Under Ahmed’s leadership, the new institution’s charter outlined its primary objectives: planning and development of peaceful uses of atomic energy, the establishment of the Atomic Energy and Nuclear Research Institute, installation of research and power reactors, negotiation with international atomic energy bodies, personnel selection and training, and the application of radioisotopes to agriculture, health, and industry.54 Early on, Pakistani scientific leaders identified the lack of trained physicists and engineers as a crucial deficiency that its nuclear program would have to rectify. In that context, in  the PAEC established a small laboratory with limited facilities in a shed at West Wharf, Karachi, to provide basic training to scientists and engineers to prepare them for further studies. Specially selected individuals would be sent for short training courses of under a year that were available in Europe or the United States. Then, having completed their studies, they would return to Pakistan and conduct their own elementary research and development, instructing the next generation of students. Just as Pakistan decided that it needed more scientific talent, the availability of nuclear education expanded dramatically. Pursuant to the Atoms for Peace initiative, the United States decided to train nuclear scientists and engineers from foreign countries beginning in . At the Argonne National Laboratory, administered by the University of Chicago, the United States established a school to accomplish that task. Similar international outreach programs existed at North Carolina State University and Pennsylvania State University, among others. On March , , at the opening session of the Argonne international program, President Eisenhower personally addressed some forty students from twenty countries, saying: “You represent a positive accomplishment in the Free World’s efforts to mobilize its atomic resources for peaceful uses and the benefit of mankind.”55 28\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nTwo years later, in , a research reactor, the Argonne Nuclear Assembly for University Training (ARGONAUT), was set up at Argonne, deepening the education available for foreign students. Students were trained in reactor theory, nuclear physics, and engineering laboratory experiments. Following their studies, nuclear engineering graduates received an opportunity to work and intern in various U.S. national nuclear laboratories; many of them, if they did not return to their home countries, went on to join the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) upon graduation. By , Argonne’s international school had  alumni in nuclear science and engineering from forty-one countries.56 Pakistanis participated actively in the training available in the United States and elsewhere, and by the end of the s PAEC had signed several bilateral agreements with U.S. national nuclear laboratories including Oak Ridge, Brookhaven, and Argonne.57 On August , , Pakistan and the United States signed an agreement in Washington for cooperation in civilian and peaceful uses of atomic energy. Under the agreement the United States would supply a research reactor to Pakistan and help with the design, construction, and operation of power reactors, so long as total assistance did not exceed $,.58 This small dollar amount meant that Pakistan could afford only a swimming pool–type reactor, a design suitable for research and training but not power generation.59 The PAEC was dissatisfied. They wanted a heavy water reactor that could be used for power generation in addition to more advanced scientific research. Among other benefits, heavy water allows for naturally occurring uranium—as opposed to enriched uranium—to be used in reactor cores; however, separating heavy water from regular water requires large-scale facilities. Heavy water molecules consist of one oxygen atom and two deuterium atoms, an isotope of hydrogen having an extra neutron in the nucleus; while naturally occurring, they are quite rare, accounting for about only one in three thousand water molecules. Nazir Ahmad implored the ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs to allocate $ million, or arrange a loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank (USEXIM), in order to procure a heavy water reactor like the “CP-” reactor in operation at the Argonne National Laboratory.60 But the domestic institutions had different national infrastructure priorities, such as the Warsak Dam in the NWFP.61 In March , PAEC chairman Nazir Ahmad wrote a letter to the chairman of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC), Ghulam Farooq, requesting procurement of a heavy water plant that could produce  29\n\nThe Reluctant Phase\n\nkilograms (kg) of heavy water per day. This plant, proposed to be installed in Multan, a city in the Punjab province, would use by-products from a nearby fertilizer plant. But the PIDC showed no interest in this plan. The PAEC was deeply disillusioned with the response of PIDC, as well as that of the Ministry of Finance.62 Aside from fund allocation, the PAEC push for a CP- reactor met another obstacle. The United States was reluctant to sell Pakistan a CP- reactor because by-products of a heavy water reactor could have military applications, though proliferation concerns at the time were not as acute as they would later become. Instead, the United States was willing to assist only with comparatively proliferation-safe light water reactor technology.63 The issue remained unresolved for three years. Not until  did the Pakistani government approve the construction of the modest swimming pool–type research reactor.64 The PAEC was still unhappy. The PAEC was demanding a quality power reactor, especially knowing that India had received one. The minutes of the meeting recorded the dismay of the board: “The installation of the swimming pool type reactor might adversely affect the progress of peaceful uses of atomic energy which we would like to achieve in the country, and in view of our expanding national requirements, it might be necessary to consider the installation of a power reactor, with a large number of facilities.”65 Still grappling for options, Pakistan looked to Canada, which had offered a Canada Deuterium-Uranium (CANDU-type) heavy water reactor to India in ; Pakistan sought a similar reactor, but the Canadian price of $ million greatly exceeded Pakistan’s budget. The difficult path toward the acquisition of a reactor defined Nazir Ahmad’s tenure as PAEC chair, which ended in  with few concrete results. As early as June , , Ahmad was complaining that the procurement of nuclear reactors had been unnecessarily delayed for “nontechnical” (that is, financial and administrative) reasons. He demanded financial and administrative autonomy for the PAEC so that it could carry out its objectives. In the memories of the PAEC scientists, Nazir Ahmad’s tenure as the PAEC chair is judged harshly for his failure to secure a reactor. Former scientists are likely to understate Ahmad’s challenges in educating a young bureaucracy about the promise of nuclear science, and they certainly understate the accomplishments of the young PAEC in identifying and training the personnel that would be crucial to the program’s later success.\n\n30\n\nAtoms for Peace at the Crossroads of History\n\nThe Decade Draws to a Close As Ahmad struggled with the bureaucracy, Pakistan continued to face serious political instability. Clashes in East Pakistan, sudden power shifts, and failed government appointments led to frequent changes in the central government. Even Indian Prime Minister Nehru was prompted to comment, “The government in Pakistan changes before I change dhoti [pants].”66 Young military officers of the time found the behavior of the political leadership very disturbing, especially when it provoked negative comments from the comparatively more stable India. Defense Secretary Iskandar Mirza and Army Chief General Ayub Khan emerged as powerful players during this tumultuous period. The two men had similar worldviews. They viewed strong armed forces as essential. They believed that Pakistan must have a secu"
