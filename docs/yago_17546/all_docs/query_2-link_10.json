        "text": "Founded the University of Minnesota Underground Laboratory at Soudan in 1979 and supervised the expansion of the laboratory in 1984-1986; also collaborated in the second expansion in 1999-2001. Although the Soudan Laboratory is now closed, for 37 years, this Laboratory added about ~$100 million to the economy of an underdeveloped region of the United States, while pursuing cutting-edge physics research. Established and encouraged outreach activities at Soudan, including a public visitor program, an open day, use of media to explain basic research. Started unique Physics Global Studies course, which takes undergraduate students abroad for a three-week intensive experience (2003, 2005, 2008, 2010). Founded the University of Minnesota Residential College, a program that included up to 450 undergraduate students and integrated academic and residential activities. Represented the 3,000 members of the University of Minnesota faculty in interactions with the Governor and Legislature of Minnesota. Served the University of Minnesota as its Senior Vice-President and Chief Academic Officer during the 1996-1997 conflict between the University Regents and faculty regarding policies on faculty tenure. He also participated in the management of the University’s reorganization of its biological sciences programs and the $225 million sale of the University Hospital. Played a significant role in raising $4 million to endow a Theoretical Physics Institute. Also raised approximately $0.5 million to endow the Abigail and John Van Vleck Lectureship in Physics, which has attracted nearly 20 Nobel-laureate lecturers. Often served as a Visiting Scientist in K-12 schools, principally in a program sponsored by the Science Museum of Minnesota and the Blandin Foundation. Supervised the construction and operation of the NOvA Ash River Laboratory, including the installation of the 14,000 ton NOvA Far Detector.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D., University of Michigan, 1970\n\nM.S., University of Michigan, 1969\n\nA.B., Cornell University, 1967\n\nProfessional Background\n\nDUNE Collaboration Resource Board, 2016-present\n\nChair, Organizing Committee, Weak Interactions and Neutrinos (WIN 2021) Conference, 2016-present\n\nAmerican Physical Society Committee on Informing the Public, 2015-present\n\nOrganizing Committee, Neutrino 2020 Conference, 2006-present\n\nCollege of Science and Engineering Distinguished Professor, 2004-present\n\nMorse-Alumni Distinguished Teaching Professor of Physics, 1996-present\n\nFaculty Director of Undergraduate Research, University of Minnesota, 2008-2015\n\nExecutive Committee, Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment Collaboration, 2010-2012\n\nChair, Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment Collaboration Executive Board, 2009-2012\n\nExecutive Committee, NOvA Collaboration, 2007-2010\n\nExecutive Committee, MINOS Collaboration, 2005-2010\n\nChair, American Physical Society, Subcommittee on Graduate Education, 2008-2009\n\nChair, MINOS Collaboration Speakers’ Committee, 2008-2009\n\nChair, Organizing Committee, 10th Conference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP 2009)\n\nChair, Faculty (Senate) Consultative (Executive) Committee, 2004-2005\n\nChair, American Physical Society Constitution and By-laws Committee, 2003-2004\n\nDirector of the Residential College, 1994-1996, 1997-2004\n\nFaculty Legislative Liaison, University of Minnesota, 1997-2001, 2002-2003\n\nSenior Vice-President for Academic Affairs, University of Minnesota, 1996-1997\n\nHead, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota, 1986-1996\n\nProfessor of Physics, University of Minnesota, 1983-1996\n\nDirector of Graduate Studies in Physics, University of Minnesota, 1983-1986\n\nAssociate Professor of Physics, University of Minnesota, 1978-1983\n\nAssistant Professor of Physics, University of Minnesota, 1974-1978\n\nResearch Associate, University of Minnesota, 1970-1974\n\nGuest or Visitor Appointments at Fermilab, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)\n\nBoard of Governors, Children’s Theater Company, 1986-1994\n\nScientific & Professional Societies"
