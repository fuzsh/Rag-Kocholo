        "text": "When Iran’s reformist President Masud Pezeshkian submitted nominees for his 19-member Cabinet, many expected the hard-line parliament to reject at least some of his picks.\n\nBut in a rare move, lawmakers accepted the entire slate of ministers without a change, the first time a president has managed the feat in over two decades.\n\nPezeshkian hailed the move as a win for consensus in the divided country. But critics said the unanimous approval of his cabinet showed the limits of the president’s powers in Iran’s clerically dominated political system.\n\nThat is because Pezeshkian, addressing parliament before they voted on his nominees, said that the names were selected in “coordination” with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and preapproved by him.\n\nSome Iranians saw Pezeshkian’s comments as an admission that the government is controlled by the supreme leader, who has the final say on all important matters of the state.\n\nHamid Aboutalebi, a former Iranian ambassador to Australia, said Pezeshkian may have “won the battle in parliament” but had “lost [Iran’s] century-long war for constitutionalism and republicanism.”\n\nSome Iranian social media users said the presidency had lost all legitimacy and Pezeshkian was effectively a prime minister reporting to Khamenei.\n\n“Get rid of this meaningless position of president and appoint a prime minister,” said political activist Hossein Razzaq.\n\nRazzaq added that Khamenei should pick the head of government so that public funds are not spent on holding “ridiculous elections for show\" in Iran, where votes are tightly controlled.\n\nIn many countries, including Iran, a president is elected by the people. A prime minister, a role that does not exist in Iran, is typically chosen by parliament or the head of state.\n\nSome Iranians argued that Khamenei had finally realized what they said was his yearslong goal of abolishing the presidency and installing a prime minister, arguing that in Pezeshkian, he had accomplished it without the need to change the constitution.\n\nIn 2011, Khamenei said there would be “nothing wrong in changing” the system of government if “one day in the distant future it is felt that a parliamentary system is better than a presidential system for appointing officials.”\n\nGetting rid of the presidency would further widen Khamenei’s powers.\n\nIran abolished the position of prime minister in 1989, a decade after the Islamic Revolution. The prime minister’s duties were divided between the president and the newly established position of first vice-president.\n\nUnder the Islamic republic, the prime minister was nominated by the president and approved by parliament. He served as the head of the government.\n\nThe General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces has rejected a media report saying that the helicopter crash in May in which Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died was caused by weather conditions and the aircraft's inability to handle the weight it was carrying.\n\nIran's semiofficial Fars news agency reported on August 21 that the investigation into the helicopter crash had been \"fully completed by the regulatory and security institutions.\"\n\nFars quoted an unnamed security source informed of the final investigation as saying there was \"absolute certainty that what happened was an accident.\" The monitoring and security institutions \"did not identify a suspicious factor\" in their final assessments, Fars reported.\n\nThe two reasons given for the crash were bad weather conditions and the helicopter’s inability to handle the weight of extra passengers that exceeded safety protocols, the source added.\n\nAccording to the Fars report, the chopper was carrying two passengers beyond the recommended capacity when it crashed.\n\nBut after the Fars report, the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces \"strongly rejected\" the reported findings, saying in a statement carried by state media that it was \"distorted and discredited.\"\n\nThe headquarters said the claim that the helicopter was carrying more people than its capacity was \"fundamentally false.”\n\nThe Bell 212 helicopter had a capacity of 15, including one pilot, according to the manufacturer. Raisi and seven others were killed when the helicopter crashed on its way to the city of Tabriz on May 19 in heavy fog as it crossed a mountainous and forested area.\n\nSome reports at the time noted that because of international sanctions it has been difficult for Iran to obtain parts for its aging helicopter fleet. The Bell 212 was made in the United States and procured by Iran from the United States before the 1979 Iranian revolution.\n\nIran elected a new president, reformist Masud Pezeshkian, in June and on August 21 the country's hard-line parliament approved his 19-member Cabinet, accepting the entire slate of ministers without a change for the first time since 2001.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nIran says it will take its time in its response to the July 31 killing in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nIran has kept the world on edge since it promised to strike Israel -- which it blames for the attack that killed Haniyeh -- a move experts say could plunge the region into an all-out war.\n\nIsrael has neither confirmed nor denied carrying out the attack. But it has vowed to kill leaders of Hamas over the group’s October 7 attack inside Israeli territory that killed 1,200 people. Around 250 others were taken hostage, some of whom have since been released.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said after the assassination that Iran was \"duty-bound\" to avenge its \"guest.\"\n\n\"Time is in our favor, and the waiting period for this response could be long,\" Ali Mohammad Naini, a spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said on August 30, adding any response \"may not be a repetition of past operations.\"\n\nThe 62-year-old Haniyeh was killed while he was in Tehran to attend the July 30 inauguration ceremony for Iran's new president, Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nTehran has rebuffed calls by Western nations to show restraint, insisting it has a legitimate right to respond to the killing of Haniyeh on Iranian territory.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh and talk of retaliation comes as Washington continues to push to get Hamas and Israel to agree to a temporary cease-fire and a deal to release hostages being held in Gaza. Senior officials from the United States, Israel, Qatar, and Egypt are engaged in the latest round of talks to secure such a deal.\n\nNaini did not comment on how Iran may respond to the attack on Haniyeh, but his reference to \"past operations\" may refer to Tehran’s launching of more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in April in response to Israel's suspected bombing of Iran's embassy compound in Damascus.\n\nDamage from the Iranian attack was minimal with some analysts saying the response appeared to be measured to avoid a broader conflict.\n\nIranian police have shut down Germany’s Das Deutsche Sprachinstitut Teheran (DSIT) -- the German Language Institute Tehran -- for allegedly “violating the country’s laws,” prompting Berlin to summon Iran's ambassador.\n\nIn a post on X, the Mizan news agency of Iran’s judiciary said on August 20 that two branches of “illegal centers affiliated with the German government” had been shut down for “committing several illegal actions and extensive financial violations.”\n\nIt added that the judiciary had \"received reports of violations by other centers linked to Germany\" without elaborating.\n\nFormerly called the Goethe Institute, the cultural center is managed by the Germany Embassy in the Iranian capital.\n\n\"We condemn Iranian security authorities' treatment of that German language institute in Tehran,\" the Foreign Ministry in Berlin said, noting that the Iranian ambassador had been summoned.\n\nPrior to Mizan’s post, an informed source told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that police officers had shuttered the institute’s branches in uptown Tehran on August 20, confirming earlier claims on social media.\n\nThe move comes after Germany last month banned the Islamic Center Hamburg, or IZH, an Iran-linked organization that it said \"promotes an Islamist-extremist, totalitarian ideology in Germany.\"\n\nThe German authorities also shut down five IZH suborganizations, saying that they \"also support the terrorists of Hizballah and spread aggressive antisemitism,” referring to Iran’s Lebanon-based ally that has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Farda, a former DSIT student said the closure was a “sad” development because the institute served as a “second home” for people who wanted to learn German in an environment “more open” than Iranian universities.\n\nThey said most people who studied at the institute sought to migrate to continue their studies in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Now, those looking to learn German have to pay more to study at less reputable institutes and travel abroad to take an accredited German language exam.\n\nMany people immediately expressed concerns about what the shuttering of the institute would mean for their scheduled language exams.\n\nPhotos shared on the social media platform showed several police cars parked outside premises of the cultural institute. Police officers were also seen standing under the institute’s torn-down signboard.\n\nThe Goethe Institute opened its first branch in Iran in 1958 but its cultural activities were severely restricted following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, resulting in its closure in 1987.\n\nThe institute resumed operations in 1995 under a new name -- DSIT -- but it continued to be referred to locally as Goethe Institute.\n\nA new report says Iran is preparing to export Fath-360 and Ababil close-range ballistic missiles (CRBMs) to Russia and has started training Russian personnel to use the former.\n\nThere have been several reports since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 claiming Iran was gearing up to sell or had already supplied Russia with ballistic missiles. None of the reports was confirmed by U.S. or Ukrainian officials, and Iran continues to deny having armed or planning to arm Russia.\n\nAnalysts who spoke to RFE/RL were unsure about the latest report but added that if confirmed it would provide a boon for Russia's war efforts and have both benefits and pitfalls for Iran.\n\nRussia's use of North Korean ballistic missiles briefly allayed concerns Moscow would turn to Iran to restock its inventory.\n\n\"However, the extensive demands of the battlefield may have strained North Korea's supply capabilities,\" Nicole Grajewski, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told RFE/RL.\n\nShe said Moscow might be seeking Iranian ballistic missiles as a strategy to \"lessen its dependence on North Korea,\" which would allow Russia to play off Pyongyang and Tehran against each other, \"potentially maximizing its strategic benefits.\"\n\nA visit to Tehran on August 6 by Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, who previously served as the country's defense minister, fueled suspicions that Moscow was seeking to acquire Iranian missiles.\n\nFrom Drones To Missiles\n\nSince the early months of the Ukraine war, Russia was suspected of using Iranian-made Shahed and Mohajer-6 drones, many of which have been found after being shot down in Ukrainian cities and battlefields. Iran initially denied arming Russia before relenting and admitting that it had supplied \"a limited number of drones\" to Moscow before the war.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Tehran continues to deny that its drones are being used by Russia against Ukraine. That has not stopped the United States and EU from imposing sanctions on Iran for helping Moscow.\n\nGrajewski said Iranian drones \"had a comparative advantage over the Russian ones in terms of technology, manufacturing, and operational use.\" But with ballistic missiles, it \"is about quantity, not quality.\"\n\nAside from the reputational boost that would come from supplying ballistic missiles to Russia, Iran would also gain significant knowledge about how Fath-360 and Ababil perform in battle.\n\nIn addition, Grejewski said, the \"operational use and any Russian modifications would potentially help Iran with some areas where its missiles tend to be lacking.\"\n\nEarlier reports suggested Russia was eyeing Iran's Fateh-110 and Zolfaqar short-range ballistic missiles. But exporting those to Russia would put Iran in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) range and payload thresholds, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nHowever, Fath-360 and Ababil are under the 300 km and 500 kg thresholds established by the MTCR.\n\n\"Nonetheless, that does not mean [CRBMs] should be ignored, as they help Russia conserve their own domestically produced long-range strike assets and are further signs of a deepening Russo-Iranian relationship,\" Taleblu argued.\n\nTaking Risks To Grow Partnership\n\nNot contravening the MTCR would still draw the ire of Western nations if Iran ends up supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.\n\nUN restrictions on Iran's imports and exports of missiles expired in October 2023, but the United States and the E3 (Britain, France, and Germany) as well as the wider EU extended ballistic-missile sanctions against Iran.\n\n\"The E3 was resolute in their warnings to Iran,\" Grajewski said. \"The supply of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would complicate any solution with the Iranian nuclear program.\"\n\nTalks on restoring the nuclear deal have stalled and the agreement is set to expire in October 2025, so Iran may be looking to bolster its relations with Russia in case the prospects for reviving the deal disappear.\n\nIran took part in Russia's annual army exhibition, which was held in Moscow on August 12-14, and showcased some of its latest military technology including the Mohajer-10 drone -- the updated version of the Mohajer-6 that Russia has used in Ukraine.\n\nBut Grajewski argued that more notable was the presence in Moscow of Brigadier General Ali Shadmani, a deputy commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters that is responsible for the operational command and control of Iran's armed forces.\n\nTaleblu said Iran had received a combination of things for arming Russia with drones, including cash and gold, and maintained that \"these vectors of cooperation are likely set to deepen.\"\n\n\"Iran is intent on moving up from the status of junior partner to Russia, which is one reason why the arms cooperation between the two over Ukraine is unlikely to be compartmentalized,\" he added.\n\nThe Revolutionary Court of Isfahan has acquitted Toomaj Salehi, an Iranian rapper who was sentenced to death over his protest songs against the Islamic republic.\n\nSalehi’s lawyer said the court that heard his client's case in 2022 on the charge of \"corruption on Earth\" issued the ruling on August 14.\n\nAmir Raesian said on X that Branch 5 of the Revolutionary Court of Isfahan had issued a verdict of acquittal in the case.\n\nHe added that the court also \"issued a suspension of the prosecution order on other charges” and sent two charges of publishing computer lies and disturbing order to Criminal Court 2 with a “disqualification order.”\n\nSalehi was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court in May on the \"corruption on Earth” charge, but the Supreme Court overturned the punishment and referred the case to a parallel branch of the Revolutionary Court for reconsideration.\n\nSalehi was serving a six-year prison sentence for his involvement in the 2022 protests that rocked Iran when he was sentenced to death on the \"corruption on Earth” charge.\n\nSalehi was initially arrested in October 2022 after making public statements in support of the protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died while in police custody for allegedly wearing her head scarf improperly.\n\nSalehi gained prominence for lyrics that rail against corruption, widespread poverty, executions, and the killing of protesters in Iran. His songs also point to a widening gap between ordinary Iranians and the country's leadership, accusing the authorities of \"suffocating\" the people without regard for their well-being.\n\nAfter spending much of his pretrial detention in solitary confinement, he was sentenced to six years in prison but released in November 2023 on appeal after the Supreme Court found \"flaws in the original sentence.\" But he was arrested with \"beatings\" only 12 days later after a video describing his torture in prison was published.\n\nIn a letter published in late May, Amnesty International said Salehi had been tortured and beaten repeatedly during his detention.\n\nIran has kept the world on edge since it promised to strike Israel more than two weeks ago -- a move experts say could plunge the region into an all-out war.\n\nThe promised attack by Islamic republic is meant as retaliation for the July 31 killing in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said after the assassination that Iran was \"duty-bound\" to avenge its \"guest.\"\n\nAn Iranian attack has been \"imminent\" for the past two weeks, and this anticipation has led to frequent bouts of hysteria on social media predicting an attack by Iran and its allies -- including Lebanese militant group Hizballah -- within hours.\n\n\"I think they really enjoy that: watching Israel stuck in this waiting period, paying a heavy economic and psychological price,\" said Raz Zimmt, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:35 0:00\n\nBut the fallout from the anticipation is a double-edged sword that also hurts Iran and its allies.\n\n\"The negative impact on Israel, be it the stress to the home front, the military mobilization, and even the economic consequences, will not be limited to Israel, but also affect Iran and Lebanon,\" warned Michael Horowitz, head of intelligence at the Bahrain-based Le Beck International consultancy.\n\nWhy The Wait?\n\nAnalysts said the idea Iran is delaying its retaliation because it is relishing the psychological impact it is having is more of an excuse than a proper strategy.\n\nThey agreed intense domestic debates, the complexity of coordinating with proxies, and assessing the risks associated with an attack have all contributed to Iran's hesitation.\n\nZimmt said Iran is \"facing a major dilemma\" because while Khamenei and the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) want to restore Iran's deterrence vis-a-vis Israel, there are elements in Iran that worry a large-scale attack could drag Iran into a war with Israel and maybe even the United States.\n\nEven if a decision on how to respond to Haniyeh's killing has been made, coordinating with Hizballah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance -- Tehran's loosely knit network of regional state and nonstate allies and proxies -- is a time-consuming process.\n\nAnother factor likely affecting Iran's decision-making is the United States beefing up its military presence in the region more than it did in April ahead of Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack against Israel.\n\n\"We're seeing a bigger response [from the United States] than in April, which is probably meant to match the scope of the threat, as Iran may carry out a larger response than the one in April,\" Horowitz said.\n\n\"The message [from the United States] in sending both defensive assets -- but also potentially offensive ones -- is one of deterrence and perhaps the only kind of message that does truly matter at this stage.\"\n\nCan Diplomacy Prevail?\n\nTehran has rebuffed calls by Western nations to show restraint, insisting it has a legitimate right to respond to Israel's killing of Haniyeh on Iranian territory.\n\nStill, the flurry of phone calls made to new President Masud Pezeshkian and acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri-Kani have raised speculation that attempts at diplomacy have helped delay an attack and could potentially stave it off.\n\n\"I am skeptical that diplomacy, on its own, is enough to truly change the Iranian calculus,\" Horowitz said. \"Iran will do what it feels is in its best interest, regardless of the calls and statements urging restraint.\"\n\nBut Iran has suggested a different kind of diplomacy could convince it to at least \"delay\" its promised attack: a permanent cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFarzan Sabet, senior research associate at the Geneva Graduate Institute, speculated Iran \"may be looking for off-ramps\" to justify a toned-down response, and some kind of Gaza cease-fire could be just the \"diplomatic victory\" it needs to do that.\n\nZimmt said a Gaza cease-fire may not be important to Iran but it does provide Tehran with \"an excuse or an explanation to legitimize this delay, both internally and mostly externally.\"\n\nHe said a cease-fire could lead to Iran either reducing the scale of its attack or choosing a different method of retaliation altogether that does not involve a direct strike on Israel.\n\nNo Good Options\n\nIt remains a mystery when and how Iran is going to respond, but as things stand Tehran does not seem to have any good options.\n\n\"Decision-makers in Tehran may have vacillated in finding a 'Goldilocks' option,\" Sabet said.\n\nThat, he explained, is Iran's conundrum to deliver \"a retaliatory strike that is not so weak as to have little symbolic or deterrent value, but not so strong as to cause an uncontrolled cycle of escalation that leads to a larger war.\"\n\nTehran is effectively left with either a weak response or one that crosses the threshold of war.\n\nBoth options \"entail significant risks,\" Horowitz said, \"either for Iran's regional projection power or the risks Iran could take if it crosses a line and is hit back in return.\"\n\nIran on August 13 rejected Western calls to renounce its threat to retaliate against Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nHaniyeh was killed along with his personal bodyguard in Tehran on July 31 as he visited the Iranian capital for the swearing-in of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIsrael hasn't confirmed or denied carrying out the attack.\n\nIran, Hamas's main backer, blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement that \"such a request lacks political logic, flies in the face of the principles and rules of international law, and constitutes public and practical support\" for Israel.\n\nReuters quoted on August 13 three senior Iranian officials as saying that only a cease-fire deal in Gaza stemming from talks expected to take place in the coming days would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel.\n\nIsrael started an air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage. Israel’s action has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nAccording to one of the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, Iran, along with allies such as Hizballah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks, which are due to begin on August 15 in either Egypt or Qatar, fail or if it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. A cease-fire in Gaza, on the other hand, would give Iran cover for a smaller \"symbolic\" response, one of Reuters' sources said.\n\nHis statement came after the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy called on Iran on August 12 to \"stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also held phone calls with Pezeshkian the same day.\n\nStarmer asked Pezeshkian to refrain from attacking Israel and said that war was not in anyone's interest, his office said. Starmer told Pezeshkian he was deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East and called on all parties to de-escalate to avoid further regional confrontation.\n\n\"There was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration,\" Starmer was quoted as saying, adding that he had underlined his commitment to an immediate cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the call with Starmer, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that war anywhere in the world was in no one's interest but that states had the right to \"punitive responses against an aggressor.\"\n\nScholz also called on Pezeshkian to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East. \"The spiral of violence in the Middle East must now be broken,\" Scholz told Pezeshkian, according to a German government statement.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agreed with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could \"attack Israel as early as this week.\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation.\n\nWestern diplomats have scrambled to avert a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions were already high due to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and dpa\n\nYahya Sinwar, the alleged architect of the deadly October 7 attack on Israel and surprise appointment as the new leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated terror group Hamas, is known to have close ties to Iran.\n\nHis appointment on August 6 as the head of the Palestinian group's political bureau followed the assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran on July 31, an act that Iran and Hamas blame on Israel.\n\nFollowing the death of Haniyeh, who had strong relations with Iranian officials, the most prominent names to be considered as his successor were Khaled Meshaal, a former politburo chief of Hamas, and Khalil al-Hayya, a prominent figure within the bureau with close ties to Haniyeh.\n\nThe appointment of Sinwar, who has been the Hamas chief in Gaza since 2017, came as a big surprise because many did not take into account the Iran factor, analysts say.\n\n\"None of us experts on Palestinian affairs -- especially here in Israel -- thought about Sinwar as the person who would replace Haniyeh,\" said Yohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies who specializes in Israeli-Palestinian relations.\n\n\"One [major] reason why Sinwar is the [new] leader is Iran,\" he added.\n\nSinwar was appointed after two days of deliberations in Qatar by the Shura Council -- a consultative body that elects the group's politburo and has members in Gaza, the West Bank, Israeli prisons, and the Palestinian diaspora.\n\nTzoreff said Meshaal's criticism during the 2011 Arab Spring of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- a close ally of Tehran -- made him a deeply unpopular figure among Iran's top brass.\n\nTzoreff argued that Mashaal's return to power could have jeopardized the Palestinian group's relations with the Islamic republic and \"[the Iranians] may have stopped giving Hamas everything it needs [to fight Israeli forces].\"\n\nBut Sinwar is reportedly stuck in Gaza, where he has been in hiding since the start of the war with Israel in October 2023. The constraints on his movement and restricted ability to communicate with the world mean Sinwar is very limited in what he can do.\n\n\"I don’t expect him or Hamas to become closer to Iran. At this point, the relationship will likely stay the same,\" said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East and North Africa Program director at the Belgium-based International Crisis Group.\n\nMolded By Israeli Prisons\n\nAlso known by his supporters as Abu Ibrahim, the 61-year-old Sinwar was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza. His parents, like Haniyeh's, fled the coastal town of Ashkelon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War that resulted in the establishment of the state of Israel -- or what Palestinians call the \"nakba\" (catastrophe).\n\nSinwar joined Hamas shortly after it was formed in 1987 and set up its feared internal security organization, Al-Majd, whose main purpose was to find Israeli spies within the group. He gained a reputation for violence and was nicknamed the \"Butcher of Khan Younis.\"\n\nSinwar was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to multiple life terms for a variety of offenses -- including the killing of two Israeli soldiers -- and spent more than two decades in prison.\n\n\"He is a guy who was hardened in Israeli prisons, like many longtime Palestinian ex-prisoners,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nHe said Sinwar learned Hebrew while in prison and, crucially, this helped him to learn how Israeli leaders think.\n\n\"Sinwar's really tough. He is ruthless. He is very much a leader in the mold of any Israeli leader,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nWhile in prison, Sinwar organized strikes to improve working conditions and emerged as a leader among incarcerated Palestinians.\n\nHis experience in prison \"prepared him very well for the leadership of Hamas\" and in planning the October 7 attack, Hiltermann said.\n\nNearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed when Hamas militants raided communities in south Israel in October and took hostages back to Gaza. The attack prompted Israel to launch a major offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which Palestinian sources say has killed more than 40,000 people.\n\nSinwar was released from prison in 2011 as part of an exchange that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners freed in return for one Israeli soldier held by Hamas. Soon after his release, Sinwar accompanied Haniyeh on a trip to Tehran where he met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe same day Sinwar was announced as Haniyeh's successor on August 6, Khamenei's account on X posted a short video of that visit showing Sinwar meeting with the Iranian leader in February 2012.\n\nHamas's Message\n\nTraditionally, Hamas's political bureau chief is based abroad so he can travel and maintain contact with regional allies, such as Iran and the Lebanese Islamic militant group Hizballah.\n\nBut Sinwar, who U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken once joked is \"buried 10 stories underground\" in Gaza, is unable to leave the enclave because of the war.\n\nTzoreff said that, by appointing a Gaza-based leader, Hamas was \"sending a very strong message\" to both Israel and Arab states that \"the resistance of Hamas has not collapsed.\"\n\n\"The main message is that nobody can push them out of the area,\" he added.\n\nSinwar himself may not be keen on leaving Gaza, because his legitimacy is based on his being in the enclave.\n\n\"If Sinwar were to leave Gaza, Palestinians would say he is abandoning them, like a captain leaving the ship,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nSinwar has been in Israel's sights since the beginning of the war, with army spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari describing him as a \"dead man\" following the October attack.\n\nKilling Sinwar remains a priority for the Israeli army.\n\nChief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi vowed on August 7 that his troops would target Sinwar and force Hamas to \"replace the head of the political bureau again.\"\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agrees with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could “attack Israel as early as this week” and it urged Tehran to “stand down” with regard its ongoing threats.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation and said Washington takes seriously reports that Iran could soon attack Israel in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIran blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\n“We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks, which is why, again, we have increased our force posture capabilities in the region even in just the last few days,” Kirby said.\n\n“We've got significant force capabilities in the region. We've changed some of that posture in just the last few days. The president is confident that we have the capability available to us to help defend Israel,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Pentagon has bolstered its forces in the Middle East amid the mounting tensions as Washington reiterated its support for long-standing ally Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement later with Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the White House said: “We expressed our support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n“We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place,” the statement added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian in separate phone calls to avoid escalation of military tensions in the region, their offices said. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.\n\nFollowing the call with Scholz, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that, \"while Iran welcomes the expansion of interactions with all countries and stresses the need for resolving problems through negotiations, it will not give in to pressure, sanctions, bullying, and aggression.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he added, \"it considers it a right to respond to aggressors based on international rules.\"\n\nThe Western allies' joint statement also said they “expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\"\n\nIt said the group endorsed the joint call by Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Amir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar “to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.”\n\n“All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition, unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed,” it said.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas extremists surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters"
