        "text": "AYAZ AMIR:\n\nAyaz Amir is a seasoned columnist. When he was requested to comment on this issue in the light of international law, he said: \"It is not a question of international law. It requires some signal contribution for peace -- like some outstanding achievement for peace, a major peace agreement or something of that sort. What has he done? He was a warlord in the beginning and later became the opponent of the Taliban. He was the defence minister of the Rabbani Government. That was the time when Kabul was reduced to rubble and amongst the competing ambitions which reduced Afghanistan to a land of sorrow, one of those ambitions was that of Masood. He was no better or worse than the other warlords.\"\n\nAbout the esteem of the Nobel Prize, Mr Amir remarked: \"There is always a political angle to such awards. The Nobel Prize has already fallen into a pit of disrepute. This is because some of its recipients have been bad choices -- Henry Kissinger, Shimon Perez and even Kofi Anan! What has the UN done for peace? The other Nobel Prizes are held in high regard but the 'Peace Prize' sometimes comes in for a lot of cynicism.\"\n\nHAMID GUL:\n\nGeneral Hamid Gul is the author of the abandoned Pakistan Afghan policy. He said: \"He was a good fighter. He was not a political figure -- a figure of great consequences. He could not unite Afghanistan. Like Hikmatyar, he too was responsible for ruining Afghanistan. He was one of the perpetrators who aggravated the ethnicity conflict in Afghanistan and was harsh with prisoners. The French always patronised him. They were directly dealing with him. The French always had an interest in the division of Afghanistan along ethnic lines.\"\n\nWhen asked what will happen if Masood won the prize, the General stated: \"Pakistan will be a great sufferer. The Pashtoon prejudice will sharpen in Afghanistan while the Tajik prejudice will be hardened.\"\n\nA Criminal fighter of Shura-e-Nezar (Supervisory Council) led by Ahmad Shah Masoud. Kabul 1993\n\nAccording to Los Angeles Times (Apr.26,1999): \"In one terrible incident in 1993, documented by the State Department, Masoud's troops rampaged through a rival neighborhood, raping, looting and killing as many as a thousand people.\"\n\nTAHIR KHAN:\n\nTahir Khan strings for the Iranian news agency IRNA. He hailed the decision admiring Masood as a great mujahid. \"He deserves it on account of defending his homeland against the Soviet occupation and making peace offers to Mullah Omar on numerous occasions. He was willing to work with the Taliban to resolve the Afghanistan crisis but his initiatives were never reciprocated. It is a healthy sign that a Muslim mujahid has been nominated for such a prestigious award.\"\n\nRAHIMULLAH YUSUFZAI:\n\nRahimullah Yusufzai, The News expert on Afghanistan shared some enlightening thoughts. Excerpts. \"Ahmed Shah Masood should have been nominated for a gallantry award. He has been fighting throughout his life. He never worked for peace. Kabul was destroyed in 1994 because of him -- 50,000 people were killed and the number of those who became homeless was greater than this. Most of them took refuge in Pakistan. It was his lust for power -- like that of Hikmatyar, Abdul Ali Mazari, Rashid Dostum, and Professor Sayyaf -- that reduced Kabul into rubble.\n\n\"In March 1995, Massoud [Defence Minister at that time] forces were responsible for rape and looting after they seized control of Kabul's predominantly Hazara neighborhood of Karte Seh.\n\nOn the night of Feb. 11, 1993, the Massoud and Sayyaf forces conducted a raid in west Kabul, killing Hazara civilians and committing widespread rape. Estimates of fatalities range from 70 to more than 100.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, October 10, 2001\n\n\"Masood spoke French fluently. The French had a long love affair with him. He was glorified disproportionately by the French media. Those who glorified him did not care that he was not acceptable to the majority of Afghans. He became controversial right form the early phase of the Afghan jihad when he agreed to a ceasefire with the Soviet army. The ceasefire gave passage to the red army to Salang Highway and enabled Moscow to supply its troops in Kabul and in the east and south of Afghanistan. That was really unthinkable and an act of treason! No mujahid could have thought of a ceasefire like this. Like a number of other Afghan leaders, Masood also accepted military and monetary support from outsiders which allowed them to interfere in Afghanistan's affairs.\"\n\nIn March 1995 Shura-e-Nezar forces reportedly carried out raids on hundreds of civilian homes in Kabul's south-western district of Karte She, killing or beating whole families, looting property and raping Hazara women. One family, interviewed by a foreign journalist in Kabul, said President Rabbani's soldiers had told them they wanted to \"drink the blood of the Hazaras\". Medical workers in the area confirmed at the time at least six incidents of rape and two attempted rapes, but believed the actual number was much higher.\n\n\"International responsibility for human rights disaster\", (AI, 1995)\n\nWhen Mr Yousafzai was reminded that in the light of the disputed ceasefire, Masood did not deserve even a gallantry award, his reply was: \"I credit him for staying in Afghanistan unlike many others who fled to Iran or Pakistan. He fought till the end and never surrendered. He should be commended for forming an organised guerilla force. He was a very good commander and strategist who understood the training needs of his soldiers. He was also very popular among Tajiks.\"\n\nWe hope the French Ambassador in Islamabad will convey the above views to his people and a greater sanity will prevail among the French."
