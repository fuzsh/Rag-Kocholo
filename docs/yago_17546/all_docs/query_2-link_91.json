        "text": "I became a graduate of the international stream of the program \"Woman Leader\" of the Management Workshop \"Senezh\" On November 10-11 in Moscow, the training of the second international stream of the program \"Woman Leader\" of the management Workshop \"Senezh\" of the platform \"Russia is a country of opportunities\" was completed. The uniqueness of the project consists in the transfer of relevant leadership knowledge online on 4 topics: \"Personal leadership\", \"Social Design\", \"Team leadership: resources and opportunities\", \"Communities: formation and development\", and then, their subsequent application and \"grounding\" through the creation of social projects. The program involves online training on tracks. One of the key factors for getting into the program is the candidates have an actual managerial position and at least 2 years of managerial experience, as well as leadership skills. 166 women from 22 countries, including Brazil, Nicaragua, France, Germany, Great Britain, the CIS, Singapore, Jordan, China and others, took part in the international stream of 2023. #rosatom #Akkuyu #nuclearpower #Engineering #Leadership\n\nCurrently writing an article based on my global research Save Lake Balkhash International Research Project dedicated to the global leadership. Assessing the most professional political leaders among men out there according to the criteria I use to evaluate ; a) emotional resilience b) ability to return a serve c) charisma d) speed of risk assessment. As a female leader I am currently participating in economic forums and these are my points : a) The global need to assess the quality of groundwater reserves close to the war conflict zones in Ukraine and Gaza as this underrated factor is critical to the future economic development of those regions. b) Additional programs required to establish support platforms for women in science, politics and business. c) Economic prosperity is intertwined with GDP correct calculation and GDP formula should be unique to each continent due to the difference between its compounds' weigh.

This study delves into how Mauritania can leverage its natural resources to become a leader in green steel production, a crucial issue for sustainable growth. I invite my network to consult, share, and discuss this work that offers a strategic perspective on sustainable industrial transition. Your feedback and discussions will enrich this important debate.

I‚Äôve travelled and worked in many multinational companies, I have exposure to a very international environment, but this was really a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Being an annuitant of this great compy, I know that they are genuine in all what they do and say #exxonmobil #exxonmbilegypt\n\nI've got a long way to go and a fast train to get there. I'm north bound and down, watch me speed to Seoul. Today, I conducted a leadership workshop on global agility in Busan, for a great renewable energy company's, Asia Pacific leadership team. These leaders from 13 different nationalties are modern day pioneers. Their assignment is to develop new renewable energy assets in several Asian countries. New laws, policies, and procedures need to be written. The development of cross-cultural leadership skills are a must. Hiring and training new talent capable of developing new skill sets is no small task. It is not easy being a pioneer. The greatest joy comes during the journey. And that's the way it was on this day in my life. #executivecoaching #leadershipcoaching\n\nThis week I had the privilege of presenting my reflection about leadership in the energy transition -to a group of talented Equinor colleagues in the PLE leadership program. **Key Topics Discussed:** 1. **Strategic Vision:** Navigating the complexities of the energy transition requires a clear and forward-thinking strategic vision. 2. **Higher Project Risk Appetite to Shape Policies:** Embracing calculated risks is essential to influence policies and catalyze meaningful advancements in the energy sector. 3. **Open and Honest Communication:** Transparency fosters trust. Open communication is vital for cohesive teamwork and informed decision-making. 4. **Society Engagement:** Leadership in the energy transition extends beyond business ‚Äì active engagement with society ensures a broader positive impact. 5. **Grit:** Tenacity and determination are the cornerstones of effective leadership, especially when faced with obstacles. 6. **Growth Mindset:** Embracing a growth mindset fosters continuous learning and adaptation, crucial in an evolving industry like energy. 7. **Adaptability:** Flexibility is key in a rapidly changing landscape. Leaders must adapt to new technologies, market dynamics, and stakeholder expectations. 8. **Physiological safety:** it is key creating an safe environment ensuring team individuals feel free to speak up to be able constantly learn and adapt As we collectively work towards a sustainable energy future, these leadership attributes will play a pivotal role. Grateful for the opportunity to share and learn with my Equinor colleagues. Equinor #Leadership #EnergyTransition"
