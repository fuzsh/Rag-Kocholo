He studied literature, philosophy, mythologies and many contemporary subjects during his student life.\n\nHe started the journey of his mental investigation from doubt and denial. The center of attention and the direction of his study and meditation took eight years of his life; he dedicated all his investigation and struggle to find a reason to deny the existence of God. His thesis was very simple, if a man commits thousands of mistakes he still remains a human being, but if we find even one mistake of God, He cannot be a God. Thus he declared the criterion to find God; he had to uncover only one error in God’s words,\" The Quran\".\n\nAll his explorations, investigations, researches and findings were rendered futile when he found that his efforts lead him to the confirmation of the Quran and existence of God. Consequently he made God his first and foremost priority. He was already a teacher but the focus of his teaching had now diverted to his findings about God. He believes that God has to be the top priority of every single intellectual curiosity.\n\nFlyer\n\nDr. Nisar Ahmad, former Director General, PINSTECH, is one of the poineering laser scientist in Pakistan.\n\nHe also held the positions of President, Pakistan Nuclear Society; Dr. Rafi Muhamamd Choudhary Chair, Government college, Lahore; Advisor (Technical) NESCOM, Associate DG, PINSTECH; Head Laser Development Program, etc.\n\nDr. Ahmad did PhD in laser induced plasma from Queens University, Belfast, UK, in 1970.
