Arabic manuscript on paper. 86 ff. 13 lines, per extensum, written in clear and thick Turkish naskh in black ink; single words marking the various textual sections are marked in red. Modern green half calf.\n\n€ 2,500.00\n\nAnthological manuscript on Arabic morphology. quantity\n\nA miscellany of works belonging to the genre of \"nahw\", or essays on grammatical topics, mainly focusing on the nominal and verbal morphology of Arabic. Contains parts of the \"Marah al-Arwah\" (\"Abode of the Spirits\") by the 14th century grammarian Ahmad Ibn Ali Ibn Masud (ff. 1-31) as well as \"Sharh az Zanjani\" (or \"Serh ul Izzi fi't-Tasrîf\", ff. 32-43) by Taftazani, a grammatical treatise (ff. 43-56); further, a treatise on the conjugation of the verb (ff. 56-66), and various forms of the verb with explanations, beginning with perfect, imperfect and infinitive of Nasara (ff. 66-86).\n\nA detailed list of grammatical contents is given throughout, subdivided into seven sections (aqsam), each dealing extensively with (mostly) verbal morphology and derivation. The first work is dated AH [10]31 (= AD 1621/22) in the first colophon. Both on the front endpaper and immediately after this first colophon, respectively, are a short introduction and several notes in Ottoman Turkish, suggesting the manuscript’s provenance.\n\nSome worming, browning and brownstaining."
