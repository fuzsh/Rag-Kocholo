        "text": "If Iran decides to respond to a suspected Israeli strike on its territory on April 19, it might not have to pull its punches like it did the last time.\n\nTehran's telegraphed barrage against Israel last week was written off by many as a failure. But Iran has many arrows in its quiver should its standoff with Israel continue to escalate.\n\nExperts say that Iran has more sophisticated weaponry at its disposal, can bring its proxies into the fight, and, unlike its attack on April 13, can utilize the element of surprise. And the ultimate threat -- officially activating its long-suspected effort to develop a nuclear weapon -- could come into play.\n\nCaution First\n\nIran's initial response after its territory was hit on April 19 was muted. While unidentified U.S. officials reportedly said that Israel had carried out the attack, Tehran did not directly accuse Israel of involvement. Israel has not commented on the incident.\n\nA senior Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that there was \"no plan for immediate retaliation, and no clarification on who is behind the incident.\"\n\nWATCH: Iranian state media said explosions were heard early on April 19 near the central city of Isfahan, which is home to an air base and a nuclear facility. The IAEA nuclear watchdog reported that there was no damage to Iran's nuclear sites. U.S. sources were cited as saying Israel had attacked the area.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:49 0:00\n\n\"The foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed,\" the official said. \"We have not received any external attack, and the discussion leans more toward infiltration than attack.\"\n\nIranian Army General Siyavush Mihandoust said only that explosions heard in the central city of Isfahan were \"due to the work of air defenses against suspicious objects.\"\n\nIranian state television reported that three small drones were shot down east of Isfahan, which is home to Iranian nuclear facilities, and broadcast footage that projected an image of calm in the city.\n\nA spokesman for Iran's National Center of Cyberspace, Hossein Dalirian, dismissed reports by U.S. media that quoted unidentified U.S. officials as saying that missiles were used in the attack.\n\n\"There have been no air strikes from outside [Iran's] borders against Isfahan or other parts of the country,\" Dalirian wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"They have only made a failed and humiliating attempt to launch drones, and the drones were shot down.\"\n\nTiming Is Everything\n\nAnalysts said it is common for Tehran to hold off on commenting on such incidents until it can determine a course of action.\n\nBut if Iran does choose to respond militarily -- as it did on April 13 in retaliation for the April 1 killing of seven members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in a strike on the Iranian Embassy in Damascus that it blamed on Israel -- it can take things much further.\n\nHamidreza Azizi, a fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, noted that ahead of Iran's April 13 barrage against Israel, which was effectively thwarted, Tehran ensured that \"everybody would know about it beforehand.\"\n\nThere was deliberately \"no element of surprise,\" Azizi said.\n\nBut hours before the April 19 strike, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN that if Israel again took actions against Iran, \"the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level.\"\n\nIranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani on April 15 said that \"there will not be a 12- or 13-day gap\" between an Israeli strike and an Iranian answer. Israel, he said, \"must now reckon in seconds, not hours.”\n\nThe Iranian officials' stress on the immediacy of a possible retaliatory strike signals that Iran would not telegraph its strategy this time, raising the chances of inflicting greater damage.\n\nMore In Iran's Arsenal\n\nTehran launched more than 300 drones and missiles during its April 13 attack, in which the vast majority were either shot down or failed to reach their target, but experts and Iranian officials have suggested it could have used more powerful weaponry.\n\nIRGC Aerospace Force Commander Sardar Hajizadeh said that Iran had used \"old weapons with minimal power\" on April 13, adding that Tehran had decided against using more powerful missiles, including hypersonic missiles, in its arsenal.\n\nFabian Hinz, a researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin, questioned the veracity of Iran's claim it could have used better weapons, saying that one of the missiles launched against Israel, the Kheibar Shekan ballistic missile introduced in 2022, \"is one of the best missiles Iran has.\"\n\nHinz told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that in terms of quality, he is not sure Iran could make a \"qualitative jump\" in any future attack.\n\nIn terms of sheer numbers, however, Iran has \"many, many more missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in stock,\" Hinz said. \"There is no doubt about that.\"\n\nDangerous Friends\n\nWhile Iran sent a message with its April 13 attack that it was willing to take on Israel directly and had the capacity to inflict heavy damage, Tehran still has many partners and proxies willing to strike their mutual enemy.\n\nWhile members of Iran's so-called \"axis of resistance\" have been battling Israel -- including the U.S.- and EU-designated terrorist organization Hamas, Huthi rebels in Yemen, and Lebanese Hizballah -- those groups for the most part sat out the April 13 attack.\n\n\"One thing Iran could do is involve Hizballah, because Hizballah is just much closer to Israel,\" Hinz said. \"And when you deal with amazing defenses, the best thing to do is to overwhelm them, and that is much, much easier at a shorter distance.\"\n\nGoing Nuclear\n\nJust hours before the April 19 strike, an IRGC commander specified that an attack that targeted Iranian nuclear facilities would prompt a reciprocal attack on Israeli nuclear sites and could even lead to a rethinking of Iran's official nuclear doctrine.\n\nAhmad Haqtalab, who oversees nuclear security for the IRGC, said in comments published by Iranian media on April 18 that \"our hands are on the trigger for reciprocal attacks using advanced missiles against their own nuclear sites.\"\n\nIran has long been suspected by Israel, the United States, and other countries of pursuing a nuclear weapon, while Tehran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed after Israel's apparent strike that \"there is no damage to Iran’s nuclear sites.\" But prior to the incident, Haqtalab said that even the threat of an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites made it \"possible and conceivable that the doctrine and nuclear policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be reviewed to reverse the declared considerations of the past.\"\n\nThat decision would ultimately be made by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final call on all major decisions in Iran and has claimed that Iran cannot pursue nuclear weapons for religious reasons.\n\nBut Azizi emphasized that the threat is real, saying that an attack on Iranian territory \"might be exactly what Iran wants to find an excuse to weaponize its nuclear program.\"\n\nHannah Kaviani of RFE/RL's Radio Farda contributed to this report.\n\nWhen Iran’s reformist President Masud Pezeshkian submitted nominees for his 19-member Cabinet, many expected the hard-line parliament to reject at least some of his picks.\n\nBut in a rare move, lawmakers accepted the entire slate of ministers without a change, the first time a president has managed the feat in over two decades.\n\nPezeshkian hailed the move as a win for consensus in the divided country. But critics said the unanimous approval of his cabinet showed the limits of the president’s powers in Iran’s clerically dominated political system.\n\nThat is because Pezeshkian, addressing parliament before they voted on his nominees, said that the names were selected in “coordination” with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and preapproved by him.\n\nSome Iranians saw Pezeshkian’s comments as an admission that the government is controlled by the supreme leader, who has the final say on all important matters of the state.\n\nHamid Aboutalebi, a former Iranian ambassador to Australia, said Pezeshkian may have “won the battle in parliament” but had “lost [Iran’s] century-long war for constitutionalism and republicanism.”\n\nSome Iranian social media users said the presidency had lost all legitimacy and Pezeshkian was effectively a prime minister reporting to Khamenei.\n\n“Get rid of this meaningless position of president and appoint a prime minister,” said political activist Hossein Razzaq.\n\nRazzaq added that Khamenei should pick the head of government so that public funds are not spent on holding “ridiculous elections for show\" in Iran, where votes are tightly controlled.\n\nIn many countries, including Iran, a president is elected by the people. A prime minister, a role that does not exist in Iran, is typically chosen by parliament or the head of state.\n\nSome Iranians argued that Khamenei had finally realized what they said was his yearslong goal of abolishing the presidency and installing a prime minister, arguing that in Pezeshkian, he had accomplished it without the need to change the constitution.\n\nIn 2011, Khamenei said there would be “nothing wrong in changing” the system of government if “one day in the distant future it is felt that a parliamentary system is better than a presidential system for appointing officials.”\n\nGetting rid of the presidency would further widen Khamenei’s powers.\n\nIran abolished the position of prime minister in 1989, a decade after the Islamic Revolution. The prime minister’s duties were divided between the president and the newly established position of first vice-president.\n\nUnder the Islamic republic, the prime minister was nominated by the president and approved by parliament. He served as the head of the government.\n\nA new report says Iran is preparing to export Fath-360 and Ababil close-range ballistic missiles (CRBMs) to Russia and has started training Russian personnel to use the former.\n\nThere have been several reports since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 claiming Iran was gearing up to sell or had already supplied Russia with ballistic missiles. None of the reports was confirmed by U.S. or Ukrainian officials, and Iran continues to deny having armed or planning to arm Russia.\n\nAnalysts who spoke to RFE/RL were unsure about the latest report but added that if confirmed it would provide a boon for Russia's war efforts and have both benefits and pitfalls for Iran.\n\nRussia's use of North Korean ballistic missiles briefly allayed concerns Moscow would turn to Iran to restock its inventory.\n\n\"However, the extensive demands of the battlefield may have strained North Korea's supply capabilities,\" Nicole Grajewski, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told RFE/RL.\n\nShe said Moscow might be seeking Iranian ballistic missiles as a strategy to \"lessen its dependence on North Korea,\" which would allow Russia to play off Pyongyang and Tehran against each other, \"potentially maximizing its strategic benefits.\"\n\nA visit to Tehran on August 6 by Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, who previously served as the country's defense minister, fueled suspicions that Moscow was seeking to acquire Iranian missiles.\n\nFrom Drones To Missiles\n\nSince the early months of the Ukraine war, Russia was suspected of using Iranian-made Shahed and Mohajer-6 drones, many of which have been found after being shot down in Ukrainian cities and battlefields. Iran initially denied arming Russia before relenting and admitting that it had supplied \"a limited number of drones\" to Moscow before the war.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Tehran continues to deny that its drones are being used by Russia against Ukraine. That has not stopped the United States and EU from imposing sanctions on Iran for helping Moscow.\n\nGrajewski said Iranian drones \"had a comparative advantage over the Russian ones in terms of technology, manufacturing, and operational use.\" But with ballistic missiles, it \"is about quantity, not quality.\"\n\nAside from the reputational boost that would come from supplying ballistic missiles to Russia, Iran would also gain significant knowledge about how Fath-360 and Ababil perform in battle.\n\nIn addition, Grejewski said, the \"operational use and any Russian modifications would potentially help Iran with some areas where its missiles tend to be lacking.\"\n\nEarlier reports suggested Russia was eyeing Iran's Fateh-110 and Zolfaqar short-range ballistic missiles. But exporting those to Russia would put Iran in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) range and payload thresholds, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nHowever, Fath-360 and Ababil are under the 300 km and 500 kg thresholds established by the MTCR.\n\n\"Nonetheless, that does not mean [CRBMs] should be ignored, as they help Russia conserve their own domestically produced long-range strike assets and are further signs of a deepening Russo-Iranian relationship,\" Taleblu argued.\n\nTaking Risks To Grow Partnership\n\nNot contravening the MTCR would still draw the ire of Western nations if Iran ends up supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.\n\nUN restrictions on Iran's imports and exports of missiles expired in October 2023, but the United States and the E3 (Britain, France, and Germany) as well as the wider EU extended ballistic-missile sanctions against Iran.\n\n\"The E3 was resolute in their warnings to Iran,\" Grajewski said. \"The supply of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would complicate any solution with the Iranian nuclear program.\"\n\nTalks on restoring the nuclear deal have stalled and the agreement is set to expire in October 2025, so Iran may be looking to bolster its relations with Russia in case the prospects for reviving the deal disappear.\n\nIran took part in Russia's annual army exhibition, which was held in Moscow on August 12-14, and showcased some of its latest military technology including the Mohajer-10 drone -- the updated version of the Mohajer-6 that Russia has used in Ukraine.\n\nBut Grajewski argued that more notable was the presence in Moscow of Brigadier General Ali Shadmani, a deputy commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters that is responsible for the operational command and control of Iran's armed forces.\n\nTaleblu said Iran had received a combination of things for arming Russia with drones, including cash and gold, and maintained that \"these vectors of cooperation are likely set to deepen.\"\n\n\"Iran is intent on moving up from the status of junior partner to Russia, which is one reason why the arms cooperation between the two over Ukraine is unlikely to be compartmentalized,\" he added.\n\nIran has kept the world on edge since it promised to strike Israel more than two weeks ago -- a move experts say could plunge the region into an all-out war.\n\nThe promised attack by Islamic republic is meant as retaliation for the July 31 killing in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said after the assassination that Iran was \"duty-bound\" to avenge its \"guest.\"\n\nAn Iranian attack has been \"imminent\" for the past two weeks, and this anticipation has led to frequent bouts of hysteria on social media predicting an attack by Iran and its allies -- including Lebanese militant group Hizballah -- within hours.\n\n\"I think they really enjoy that: watching Israel stuck in this waiting period, paying a heavy economic and psychological price,\" said Raz Zimmt, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:35 0:00\n\nBut the fallout from the anticipation is a double-edged sword that also hurts Iran and its allies.\n\n\"The negative impact on Israel, be it the stress to the home front, the military mobilization, and even the economic consequences, will not be limited to Israel, but also affect Iran and Lebanon,\" warned Michael Horowitz, head of intelligence at the Bahrain-based Le Beck International consultancy.\n\nWhy The Wait?\n\nAnalysts said the idea Iran is delaying its retaliation because it is relishing the psychological impact it is having is more of an excuse than a proper strategy.\n\nThey agreed intense domestic debates, the complexity of coordinating with proxies, and assessing the risks associated with an attack have all contributed to Iran's hesitation.\n\nZimmt said Iran is \"facing a major dilemma\" because while Khamenei and the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) want to restore Iran's deterrence vis-a-vis Israel, there are elements in Iran that worry a large-scale attack could drag Iran into a war with Israel and maybe even the United States.\n\nEven if a decision on how to respond to Haniyeh's killing has been made, coordinating with Hizballah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance -- Tehran's loosely knit network of regional state and nonstate allies and proxies -- is a time-consuming process.\n\nAnother factor likely affecting Iran's decision-making is the United States beefing up its military presence in the region more than it did in April ahead of Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack against Israel.\n\n\"We're seeing a bigger response [from the United States] than in April, which is probably meant to match the scope of the threat, as Iran may carry out a larger response than the one in April,\" Horowitz said.\n\n\"The message [from the United States] in sending both defensive assets -- but also potentially offensive ones -- is one of deterrence and perhaps the only kind of message that does truly matter at this stage.\"\n\nCan Diplomacy Prevail?\n\nTehran has rebuffed calls by Western nations to show restraint, insisting it has a legitimate right to respond to Israel's killing of Haniyeh on Iranian territory.\n\nStill, the flurry of phone calls made to new President Masud Pezeshkian and acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri-Kani have raised speculation that attempts at diplomacy have helped delay an attack and could potentially stave it off.\n\n\"I am skeptical that diplomacy, on its own, is enough to truly change the Iranian calculus,\" Horowitz said. \"Iran will do what it feels is in its best interest, regardless of the calls and statements urging restraint.\"\n\nBut Iran has suggested a different kind of diplomacy could convince it to at least \"delay\" its promised attack: a permanent cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFarzan Sabet, senior research associate at the Geneva Graduate Institute, speculated Iran \"may be looking for off-ramps\" to justify a toned-down response, and some kind of Gaza cease-fire could be just the \"diplomatic victory\" it needs to do that.\n\nZimmt said a Gaza cease-fire may not be important to Iran but it does provide Tehran with \"an excuse or an explanation to legitimize this delay, both internally and mostly externally.\"\n\nHe said a cease-fire could lead to Iran either reducing the scale of its attack or choosing a different method of retaliation altogether that does not involve a direct strike on Israel.\n\nNo Good Options\n\nIt remains a mystery when and how Iran is going to respond, but as things stand Tehran does not seem to have any good options.\n\n\"Decision-makers in Tehran may have vacillated in finding a 'Goldilocks' option,\" Sabet said.\n\nThat, he explained, is Iran's conundrum to deliver \"a retaliatory strike that is not so weak as to have little symbolic or deterrent value, but not so strong as to cause an uncontrolled cycle of escalation that leads to a larger war.\"\n\nTehran is effectively left with either a weak response or one that crosses the threshold of war.\n\nBoth options \"entail significant risks,\" Horowitz said, \"either for Iran's regional projection power or the risks Iran could take if it crosses a line and is hit back in return.\"\n\nIran on August 13 rejected Western calls to renounce its threat to retaliate against Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nHaniyeh was killed along with his personal bodyguard in Tehran on July 31 as he visited the Iranian capital for the swearing-in of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIsrael hasn't confirmed or denied carrying out the attack.\n\nIran, Hamas's main backer, blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement that \"such a request lacks political logic, flies in the face of the principles and rules of international law, and constitutes public and practical support\" for Israel.\n\nReuters quoted on August 13 three senior Iranian officials as saying that only a cease-fire deal in Gaza stemming from talks expected to take place in the coming days would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel.\n\nIsrael started an air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage. Israel’s action has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nAccording to one of the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, Iran, along with allies such as Hizballah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks, which are due to begin on August 15 in either Egypt or Qatar, fail or if it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. A cease-fire in Gaza, on the other hand, would give Iran cover for a smaller \"symbolic\" response, one of Reuters' sources said.\n\nHis statement came after the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy called on Iran on August 12 to \"stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also held phone calls with Pezeshkian the same day.\n\nStarmer asked Pezeshkian to refrain from attacking Israel and said that war was not in anyone's interest, his office said. Starmer told Pezeshkian he was deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East and called on all parties to de-escalate to avoid further regional confrontation.\n\n\"There was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration,\" Starmer was quoted as saying, adding that he had underlined his commitment to an immediate cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the call with Starmer, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that war anywhere in the world was in no one's interest but that states had the right to \"punitive responses against an aggressor.\"\n\nScholz also called on Pezeshkian to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East. \"The spiral of violence in the Middle East must now be broken,\" Scholz told Pezeshkian, according to a German government statement.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agreed with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could \"attack Israel as early as this week.\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation.\n\nWestern diplomats have scrambled to avert a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions were already high due to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and dpa\n\nYahya Sinwar, the alleged architect of the deadly October 7 attack on Israel and surprise appointment as the new leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated terror group Hamas, is known to have close ties to Iran.\n\nHis appointment on August 6 as the head of the Palestinian group's political bureau followed the assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran on July 31, an act that Iran and Hamas blame on Israel.\n\nFollowing the death of Haniyeh, who had strong relations with Iranian officials, the most prominent names to be considered as his successor were Khaled Meshaal, a former politburo chief of Hamas, and Khalil al-Hayya, a prominent figure within the bureau with close ties to Haniyeh.\n\nThe appointment of Sinwar, who has been the Hamas chief in Gaza since 2017, came as a big surprise because many did not take into account the Iran factor, analysts say.\n\n\"None of us experts on Palestinian affairs -- especially here in Israel -- thought about Sinwar as the person who would replace Haniyeh,\" said Yohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies who specializes in Israeli-Palestinian relations.\n\n\"One [major] reason why Sinwar is the [new] leader is Iran,\" he added.\n\nSinwar was appointed after two days of deliberations in Qatar by the Shura Council -- a consultative body that elects the group's politburo and has members in Gaza, the West Bank, Israeli prisons, and the Palestinian diaspora.\n\nTzoreff said Meshaal's criticism during the 2011 Arab Spring of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- a close ally of Tehran -- made him a deeply unpopular figure among Iran's top brass.\n\nTzoreff argued that Mashaal's return to power could have jeopardized the Palestinian group's relations with the Islamic republic and \"[the Iranians] may have stopped giving Hamas everything it needs [to fight Israeli forces].\"\n\nBut Sinwar is reportedly stuck in Gaza, where he has been in hiding since the start of the war with Israel in October 2023. The constraints on his movement and restricted ability to communicate with the world mean Sinwar is very limited in what he can do.\n\n\"I don’t expect him or Hamas to become closer to Iran. At this point, the relationship will likely stay the same,\" said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East and North Africa Program director at the Belgium-based International Crisis Group.\n\nMolded By Israeli Prisons\n\nAlso known by his supporters as Abu Ibrahim, the 61-year-old Sinwar was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza. His parents, like Haniyeh's, fled the coastal town of Ashkelon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War that resulted in the establishment of the state of Israel -- or what Palestinians call the \"nakba\" (catastrophe).\n\nSinwar joined Hamas shortly after it was formed in 1987 and set up its feared internal security organization, Al-Majd, whose main purpose was to find Israeli spies within the group. He gained a reputation for violence and was nicknamed the \"Butcher of Khan Younis.\"\n\nSinwar was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to multiple life terms for a variety of offenses -- including the killing of two Israeli soldiers -- and spent more than two decades in prison.\n\n\"He is a guy who was hardened in Israeli prisons, like many longtime Palestinian ex-prisoners,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nHe said Sinwar learned Hebrew while in prison and, crucially, this helped him to learn how Israeli leaders think.\n\n\"Sinwar's really tough. He is ruthless. He is very much a leader in the mold of any Israeli leader,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nWhile in prison, Sinwar organized strikes to improve working conditions and emerged as a leader among incarcerated Palestinians.\n\nHis experience in prison \"prepared him very well for the leadership of Hamas\" and in planning the October 7 attack, Hiltermann said.\n\nNearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed when Hamas militants raided communities in south Israel in October and took hostages back to Gaza. The attack prompted Israel to launch a major offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which Palestinian sources say has killed more than 40,000 people.\n\nSinwar was released from prison in 2011 as part of an exchange that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners freed in return for one Israeli soldier held by Hamas. Soon after his release, Sinwar accompanied Haniyeh on a trip to Tehran where he met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe same day Sinwar was announced as Haniyeh's successor on August 6, Khamenei's account on X posted a short video of that visit showing Sinwar meeting with the Iranian leader in February 2012.\n\nHamas's Message\n\nTraditionally, Hamas's political bureau chief is based abroad so he can travel and maintain contact with regional allies, such as Iran and the Lebanese Islamic militant group Hizballah.\n\nBut Sinwar, who U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken once joked is \"buried 10 stories underground\" in Gaza, is unable to leave the enclave because of the war.\n\nTzoreff said that, by appointing a Gaza-based leader, Hamas was \"sending a very strong message\" to both Israel and Arab states that \"the resistance of Hamas has not collapsed.\"\n\n\"The main message is that nobody can push them out of the area,\" he added.\n\nSinwar himself may not be keen on leaving Gaza, because his legitimacy is based on his being in the enclave.\n\n\"If Sinwar were to leave Gaza, Palestinians would say he is abandoning them, like a captain leaving the ship,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nSinwar has been in Israel's sights since the beginning of the war, with army spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari describing him as a \"dead man\" following the October attack.\n\nKilling Sinwar remains a priority for the Israeli army.\n\nChief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi vowed on August 7 that his troops would target Sinwar and force Hamas to \"replace the head of the political bureau again.\"\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agrees with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could “attack Israel as early as this week” and it urged Tehran to “stand down” with regard its ongoing threats.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation and said Washington takes seriously reports that Iran could soon attack Israel in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIran blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\n“We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks, which is why, again, we have increased our force posture capabilities in the region even in just the last few days,” Kirby said.\n\n“We've got significant force capabilities in the region. We've changed some of that posture in just the last few days. The president is confident that we have the capability available to us to help defend Israel,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Pentagon has bolstered its forces in the Middle East amid the mounting tensions as Washington reiterated its support for long-standing ally Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement later with Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the White House said: “We expressed our support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n“We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place,” the statement added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian in separate phone calls to avoid escalation of military tensions in the region, their offices said. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.\n\nFollowing the call with Scholz, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that, \"while Iran welcomes the expansion of interactions with all countries and stresses the need for resolving problems through negotiations, it will not give in to pressure, sanctions, bullying, and aggression.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he added, \"it considers it a right to respond to aggressors based on international rules.\"\n\nThe Western allies' joint statement also said they “expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\"\n\nIt said the group endorsed the joint call by Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Amir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar “to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.”\n\n“All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition, unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed,” it said.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas extremists surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters"
