Heck, even India, Sri Lanka, Iran are willito reach big trade with Pakistan.\n\nEven Sweden and Pakistan signed a deal for Saab 2000 Eriey Awacs. It was rejected... They were delivered nevertheless cuz they signed it before they could change their minds...\n\nRussia just wants money from you like Sweden did want from Pakistan from those deals. Those Rus-Ind deals you and other Indians point out were signed well before MMRCA rejection, and before India's move to ally its self with NATO... Watch what they will do in the future...\n\nYou even look for nuke deals with Australia and America. Russians will not digest this....\n\nlol you just proved Roy's point, even after rejection of mmrca Russian friends are transferring us critical technologies like seekers for long range ballistic missiles! Russia is not china and pakistan is not India where the seller can blindly trust the buyer, china doesn't supply pakistan with best of its weapons. yea they helped you with nukes for which you will always be thankful to them.\n\nlol you just proved Roy's point, even after rejection of mmrca Russian friends are transferring us critical technologies like seekers for long range ballistic missiles! Russia is not china and pakistan is not India where the seller can blindly trust the buyer, china doesn't supply pakistan with best of its weapons. yea they helped you with nukes for which you will always be thankful to them.\n\nFirst you are saying China doesn't supply with best of its weapons, and now you are saying they helped us nukes? Look who is b.S ing now\n\nHow on earth did China give us nukes in the first place???\n\nPerhaps you should go back and do some Pakistani research.\n\n-Its starts off with Ayub Khan, who hires someone named Abdus Salaam in the 1960s. Later he achieved a nobel piece prize award in physics.\n\n- Zulifiqar Al Bhutto hires someone named Abdul Qadeer khan..... we all know what he did.\n\nI can go on if you like...\n\n- Parvez Butt helped establishing the particle accelerators, nuclear power plants, and started the research program to the field of Nuclear medicines. Parvez Butt is currently serving as an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and also serving as a \"Science and Technology\" member at the Planning Commission of Pakistan\n\n- Ishfaq Ahmad D.Sc., Minister of State, SI, HI, NI, FPAS, (born 3 November 1930) is a Pakistani nuclear physicist, and well-known educationist and academic from Pakistan. A versatile theoretical physicist,[1] Ahmad made significant contributions in nuclear, particle and quantum electrodynamics, Ahmad played an important role in establishing research institutes in Nuclear sciences in Pakistan. During 1970s, Ahmad was the head of the Nuclear Physics Division at the secret Pinstech Institute which developed the first designs of atomic bombs.[2] There, he played an influential role in leading the physics calculations in the critical mass of the weapons, and did theoretical work on the implosion method used in the weapons.[3]\n\nPrior to 1960s, he also led the Reactor technology government projects in different countries, and served as lead project coordinator on behalf of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nHe is currently Science adviser to the Prime minister on Strategic and Scientific programs, with the status of Federal Minister. A scientist and physicist by profession, Ahmad was the chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) from 1991&#8211;2001 when he replaced his lifelong friend Munir Ahmad Khan as chairman in 1991.[4]\n\nOne of the top and leading scientist of Pakistan, Ahmad played an important, pioneering, and a central figurative role in both Nuclear weapons research program and the Nuclear power generation program.[5] Having headed the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Ahmad rose to international fame in May 1998 when he headed PAEC as a chairman while conducted the country's successful nuclear tests in Balochistan Province.[6]\n\n- Muhammad Masud Ahmad, D.Phil, Sc.D, , HI (twice), SI) best known as Masood Ahmad, is a Pakistani theoretical physicist and ICTP laureate known for his work in dual resonance and Veneziano model, a strings sting mathematically described the fundamental forces and forms of matter in quantum state. Having specialized in Quantum and Statistical physics, Ahmad assisted and took participation the development of atomic bomb project as a member of Theoretical Physics Group, in 1970s, and furthermore, took participation in the development of the atomic bomb programme.\n\n- Ghulam Dastigar Allam Qasmi, popularly knew as G.D. Alam; HI, PhD), was a Pakistani theoretical physicist and professor of mathematics at the Quaid-e-Azam University. Allam is best known for conceiving and embarking the research on gas centrifuge project during the timeline of Pakistan's integrated atomic bomb project in 1970s, and also conceived the research on Gauge theory and Gamma ray bursts throughout his career.\n\nAfter the atomic bomb project, Allam joined the Department of Mathematics at the Quaid-e-Azam University as well as serving as visiting faculty at the Institute of Physics, and co-authored papers on variation calculus and fission isomer.\n\n- Tahir Hussain (1923-2010) was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and a emeritus professor of nuclear physics at the Government College University whose research was engaged in Long-lived fission product and Electrostatic nuclear accelerators. As an eminent educator and scientist, he has mentored noted Pakistani physicists at the Government College University and is considered one of the noted physicist in his country.[1]"
