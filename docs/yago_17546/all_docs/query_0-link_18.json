        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe main goal of this study was to report the roles of age, gender, BMI and lifestyle choices (dietary habits and addictions) in colon carcinogenesis that could further be evaluated for the prognosis.\n\nWith the increasing risk rate of CC worldwide, it is important to evaluate the clinical parameters for estimating and identifying CC risk for early precautions and detection. This single-centre study showed the clinical relevance of BMI with CC in the Pakistani-Asian population. The number of underweight, NW, overweight and obese patients in the total cohort was 17 (7.2%), 95 (40.3%), 81 (34.3%) and 43 (18.2%), respectively. NC patients were taken as a control group to analyse the cross-correlation of the risk of CC. Association of underweight with CC may not be cause and effect since many patients will become underweight due to cancer effects. It is hard to prove this is causative. Both cancer and control populations are from different socioeconomic groups. The Punjabi ethnic patients constituted a major group of the study cohort; however, the proportion of each ethnic group in the study does not reflect the national distribution of ethnic groups. The information on cancer statistics retrieved from the patient-based annual report 1994–2020 from Cancer Registry and Clinical Data Management shows that 104,960 malignancies were registered, of which 67.8% are from Punjab, 19.8% from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and F.A.T.A, 3.4% from Sindh, 1.5% from Baluchistan, 1.2% from Federal Capital, 0.2% from Gilgit-Baltistan, 1.0% from Un-occupied Kashmir and 0.04% from other countries,[15] which may cover the population of Pakistan, but more frequently cover residential areas of Punjab, particularly underdeveloped areas and urban environments such as major villages. In our study, using the WHO BMI classification, being underweight or obese was related to cancer. Ascending part of the colon seems to be the preferred site of tumour formation. There was a significant correlation between cancer stage and gender (P = 0.011). There were relatively more male patients in all the age groups, with highest in the <50 years. Clinicopathological differences between younger and older patients may be explained by underlying different molecular patterns.[16] The aetiology of the gender differences is primarily unknown. However, the preventive effect of oestrogen and progestin,[17] less use of smoking, genetic differences,[18] differences in lifestyle and eating habits[19] and differences in screening rates[20] have been suggested as possible explanations. A study reported that a significantly higher risk of CC in female versus male patients in the obese group was observed than that in the NW group.[21] Our study showed that female patients were more likely (2 times) to have CC than male patients [ ].\n\nIn a study in Japan, BMI was also positively associated with CC risk for men. In contrast, the pattern for women was not clear.[22] Data from 8213 participants showed a statistically significant direct association between BMI and the odds of non-advanced adenomas (P < 0.001) and proximal neoplasia (P < 0.001), while the relation for advanced adenomas was of marginal significance (P < 0.07) and no relation for distal neoplasia (P < 0.85).[23] Individuals younger than 50, eating a balanced diet and BMI <25 Kg/m2 with no metabolic condition are at a 15% lower risk of CRC.[24] In a Canadian study, alcohol was associated with a higher risk of CRC (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2–4.0) among obese participants (BMI ≥30) relative to the non-alcohol obese. However, no increased risk was observed in people without obesity.[25] Pre-diagnostic alcohol abstaining and heavy drinking were associated with poorer survival after a CRC diagnosis than light drinking.[26] Colon microbiota is a recently recognised mediating factor in colon carcinogenesis. It is heavily affected by metabolites of ethanol, so even moderate drinking of alcohol increases the risk of CC.[27] The majority of Pakistanis do not drink alcohol for religious reasons. However, the exact percentage of drinkers within the general population is unknown. Our study showed that 217 out of 236 (91.9%) participants did not drink alcohol. Smoking is strongly associated with cancer risk in organs such as the lungs, oral cavity, kidney, bladder, digestive and urinary tract. Total tobacco usage early in life may be a significant independent prognostic factor of cancer recurrences and mortality in patients with Stage III CC.[28] In a prospective study of older women, cigarette smoking was associated with the MSI-high, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-positive and BRAF mutation-positive CRC.[29] Based on the World Health Organization’s 2017 age-standardised current estimate of smoking prevalence, 34.6% of men, 6.8% of women and 20.7% of Pakistan’s adult population use tobacco in one form or another.[30]\n\nThree meals a day are a regular diet of the majority of the Pakistani population ranging from 2000 to 5000 calories/meal. There is a direct link between dietary choices and health outcomes. However, there are few studies on the dietary patterns in Pakistan,[31-33] so there is a knowledge gap in ethnic and regional dietary variations that might contribute to CC. The use of wood for cooking food seems to increase the likelihood of CC; hence, this could be a potential risk factor for CC [ ]. There is a great deal of variation in terms of fuel used for cooking the food from natural gas, animal and plant products producing hydrocarbon-rich soot that has been reported as a potential cancer risk factor.[34] Eating habits, high BMI and physical inactivity enhance the threat of CC. Multiple studies in Asia, Europe and the USA have shown the link between eating red or canned meat and a higher threat of CC in evaluating the male and female populations.[35] Incidence of CRC in a meta-analysis of 13 studies from different areas of Pakistan ranged from 4% to 6.8%, possibly due to genetic differences, environmental factors and dietary variations along multiethnic lines such as consumption of large quantities of fat and smoked meat.[36]\n\nMultivariate analysis of BMI and clinical variables showed that the underweight group had a high risk for advanced stage cancer. A study on 31,756 patients (malignant neoplasm of the colon) using a Korean nationwide cohort showed the association of high BMI with CC and reported that the risk of advanced cancer stage (III) in the underweight group was 33% higher (P < 0.001).[21] The results of our study are in alignment with these findings. We collected the data on DM status in our study cohort to see if a sugar-associated disease is comorbid in CC patients. Only 37 out of 236 patients (15.7%) had DM with 15 (15.2%) NC and 22 (16.1%) cancer patients (P = 0.85) showing no association. In Pakistan, despite ethnic and regional dietary variations, high-calorie meals are generally consumed, which might lead to high BMI if a physically inactive lifestyle is opted. Literature shows that as BMI increases, the risk of some diseases, including cancer, will also increase.[13] Increased BMI (≥25 Kg/m2) was identified as a potential risk factor for CC [ ]. Many risk factors can be associated with weight gain in a particular age window of a patient’s lifespan. Advancement in screening protocol is an important factor in reducing the overall incident rate of CRC. It has been estimated that in 2030, the incidence rate of CC will increase by 90% in patients aged 20–34 years and 28% in patients aged 35–49 years.[37] Young-onset (age <50) CC in Asian regions follows a similar pattern of CRC as seen in Europe.[38] In the USA, 20% of CRC diagnosed individuals are younger than 55 years.[39] In Japan, CRC screening starts at 40 years.[40]\n\nThe lack of CRC screening programmes and socioeconomic hurdles, such as a significant out-of-pocket expense, is major problems in the developing countries such as Pakistan. CC is on the rise, but it has the potential to move down the rungs of the mortality ladder. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a battery of screening tests, including guaiac-based faecal occult blood test, antibody-based faecal immunochemical test (FIT), the FIT-DNA test, colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy.[41] Implementing CRC screening at an earlier age will have a long-term, cost-effective impact in low-income developing countries in Asia.[40] Screening colonoscopy use was associated with a 65% reduction in risk of death in the right colon and a 75% reduction in risk of death for the left colon/rectal cancers.[42] In Asia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are leading nationwide databases to record CRC endoscopy procedures performed, complications and outcomes.[43-45] When offered as a primary screening test, colonoscopy screening typically starts at age 50 or 55. It is repeated every 10 years after that up to age 75 or 79, with two or three examinations in total for one individual.[46-49] India has early detection programme/guidelines for three of four cancers (breast, cervix, colon and childhood) and Nepal and Afghanistan are in the process of adapting a national level cancer screening programme.[50] Similar nationwide cancer screening models in developed countries could be adopted by LMICs such as Pakistan to reduce the cancer burden. The limitation of this study is the lack of quantified values for smoking in terms of pack year, exercise in terms of minutes per week and nutrition in terms of type and frequency.\n\nOur single-centre preliminary study is one of the first studies investigating the clinical relevance of BMI with CC in Pakistani. New measures must be taken not only to avoid the onset of CC but also for general good living, such as screening programmes and recommending a balanced diet and physically active lifestyle to the community through awareness and education. Several distinctive results in our study offer future research possibilities in challenging environments such as ours found in the developing countries. In Pakistan, nationwide epidemiological studies should be conducted to gather information on their dietary habits, exercise routines, kind of fuel in use, specific amounts of addictive substances and more prevalent diseases (diabetes, hypo or hyper blood pressure) affecting their BMI and linking it to cancer burden identified by advanced methods in emerging sciences (bioinformatics, metabolomics and proteomics) at an appreciable pace. Launching a nationwide screening programme using a non-invasive test (e.g., occult blood measurement in stool) could reduce the number of patients with advanced stage cancer, giving a chance for disease management at an early stage."
