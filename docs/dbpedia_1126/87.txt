Derry’s local heroes The Undertones are to have their biggest hit, ‘Teenage Kicks’, released in its 7” original format.

Bestowed with the honour of being covered by REM at their recent jaunt in Belfast, and most significantly known for being the late John Peel’s favourite song, ‘Teenage Kicks’ will be out on April 4.

Its tracklisting will remain the same as the 1978 original, containing ’Smarter Than U’, ’True Confessions’ and ’Emergency Cases’. But the single will be limited to 1,000 copies, making it almost as much of a collector’s item as the original, which fetches £20 on eBay.

The single is released to coincide with a double album of late ‘70s punk tunes, also called ‘Teenage Kicks’. The album contains defining moments of the Boomtown Rats, The Buzzcocks, Sham 69, The Jam, The Ruts, XTC, Elvis Costello and about every other band of that ilk you could possibly think of.
