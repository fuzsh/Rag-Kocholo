        "text": "Rock Biography | The Undertones\n\nSelling an estimated 120,000 records, Northern Ireland Band, The Undertones consisted of Feargal Sharkey (vocals), John O'Neill (rhythm guitar, vocals), Damian O'Neill (lead guitar, vocals), Michael Bradley (bass, vocals) and Billy Doherty (drums).\n\nFormation\n\nOriginating from Derry The Undertones formed in 1974 as a result of five friends having similar interests in music and the fact that many entertainment venues in the city were closed in late evenings, as a result of the Troubles.\n\nThe group would play their first gigs at local venues, including schools and parish halls covering songs from bands such as The Beatles and The Small Faces.\n\n1976 would see the arrival of a new form of music known as punk rock and with that The Undertones changed musical direction. The influx of bands such as the Adverts, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks and, particularly, the Ramones became major influences on the young Derry lads.\n\nThe Undertones Punk Rock\n\nThe Undertones would begin performing their own three-chord wonders and eventually secured a paying job at The Casbah, earning the group up to £30 for each attendance fee.\n\nThe Undertones popularity through The Casbah was growing, and the fact they were being paid, inspired the group to write and rehearse further material. By the following year, the concerts the Undertones performed would include the iconic Teenage Kicks.\n\nThe popularity of the The Undertones at The Casbah gave the band confidence to start looking outside of Derry walls.\n\nThe Undertones And John Peel\n\nThe Undertones would record a demo of Teenage Kicks and began sending copies to various record companies in the hope of securing a record deal.\n\nIn an effort to gain publicity the band decided to send a copy to influential BBC Radio DJ John Peel, who impressed by the band, offered to pay for a recording session.\n\nOn 15 June 1978, the band recorded their debut four-song EP Teenage Kicks on a budget of only £200.\n\nRecord Deal\n\nPeel had been playing Teenage Kicks on his show when Seymour Stein, the president of Sire Records first heard The Undertones. Paul McNall, his London-based representative, was sent to Derry to see the band play live in what would ultimately prove to be their final performance at the Casbah on 29 September 1978.\n\nThe following day, three members of the band signed a proposed contract from McNall, with the understanding that Feargal Sharkey and Michael Bradley would discuss the contract with Seymour Stein in person in London.\n\nOn 2 October 1978, Bradley and Sharkey agreed to an increased advance fee of £10,000 offered by Stein upon the recording contract and signed to Sire Records on a five-year contract.\n\nThe Undertones (1978), Album\n\nTeenage Kicks would be released later in October 1978 and with help from John Peel and a performance on BBC's Top of The Pops the group reached No.31 in the UK charts.\n\nThe Undertones would spend the rest of 1978 touring England, Wales and Belfast until they began work on their debut album at Eden Studios, West London, in January 1978. The recordings consisted of material performed regularly at the Casbah.\n\nThe self titled album, The Undertones (1979), primary lyrical concern of the songs focused upon youthful relationships and adolescence. Three further punk singles Jimmy Jimmy, Here Comes the Summer and You've Got My Number (Why Don't You Use It?) each received critical acclaim.\n\nHypnotised (1980)\n\nThe Undertones released their sixth single, My Perfect Cousin (1980), which took them to No.9 in the UK charts. The single would be their highest chart entry and a month later Hypnotised was released, reaching No.6 in the UK Album Charts.\n\nThe group would go on a tour of the UK followed by a short tour of the US when Wednesday Week was released, bringing chart success once again reaching No.11.\n\nChart success and constant touring would make The Undertones one of the hottest bands in UK. The group had their eyes on the US and felt their current label wasnt promoting them enough, resulting in The Undertones splitting form Sire Records.\n\nThe band signed a contract with EMI and began recording their third album, Positive Touch.\n\nWhile Positive Touch was guitar oriented the lyrics and musical style was heavily influenced by the what was happening at home.\n\nThe Troubles in Northern Ireland would influence songs such as Crisis of Mine, You're Welcome and It's Going To Happen!, which preceded the release of Positive Touch and was inspired by the 1980–81 Hunger Strikes.\n\nPositive Touch (1981), would peak at No.17 in the UK charts, remaining in the Top 40 for a total of four weeks. Although well received by critics, the album and singles released were not as successful as the material released the previous year.\n\nThe Sin of Pride (1983)\n\n1983 would see a musical change once again with the release of The Sin Of Pride. Influenced by soul and Motown, the album was met with critical acclaim, reaching No.43 in the UK charts.\n\nThe Undertones would tour to promote their new album and released the singles Got To Have You Back and Chain of Love, but EMI was not happy.\n\nThe Undertones Split\n\nBy 1983 EMI were unhappy with the lack of chart success since the release of Positive Touch LP and with tensions growing within the band Fergal Sharkey would announce his intentions to leave the group.\n\nTo fulfill agreed commitments, The Undertones remained together for a further two months before disbanding, with their final concert being played at Punchestown Racecourse in County Kildare.\n\n1999 would see the band reform, without Sharkey, and have been touring ever since.\n\nChart Success\n\nThe Undertones released 6 studio albums and 20 singles, 7 which entered the Top 40 in the UK charts.\n\n- Featured -"
