Picking an entrant for some places would be next to impossible, but with all due respect to Girl From Mars, Moondance, Alternative Ulster or even Things Can Only Get Better, for Northern Ireland as they say, there can be only one.\n\nJohn O’ Neill formed The Undertones with a group of schoolfriends in Londonderry/Derry; Feargal Sharkey had already been something of a minor local celebrity on the Catholic school singing circuit, but by then crucially also had a job and a van. After getting regular live work at local venue The Casbah in 1977, O’Neill was determined to write some new material to bolster a repertoire that included mostly Ramones and Stooges covers.
