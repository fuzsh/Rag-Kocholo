        "text": "Description\n\nDelighted to announce the return of The Undertones to Mike the Pies on Saturday 20th July 2024. A night you sure definitely don’t want to miss.\n\nThe Undertones emerged from Derry in 1976, the result of five friends (John O’Neill, Damian O’Neill, Feargal Sharkey, Billy Doherty and Michael Bradley) learning how to play basic rock and roll.\n\nEven by the standards of that decade Derry was not the rock and roll capital of anywhere. With no live bands worth watching, they learned by listening to mail order records, reading one of the few copies of NME that made it to Derry but most of all from listening to John Peel’s wonderful show on BBC Radio One. Practicing in their bedrooms eventually led to the band recording John O’Neill’s ‘Teenage Kicks’ in 1978 on Terri Hooley’s Good Vibrations label in Belfast. The legendary DJ John Peel received a copy and liked it so much he played it twice in a row on his radio show.\n\nIn 1999 The Undertones reconvened, without Feargal Sharkey, to once again perform their two-minute, three and a half chord songs to a new generation of fans in Derry. Fellow Derryman Paul McLoone replaced Sharkey on vocals and his vocal prowess and electric onstage presence soon convinced any doubters that he was more than capable of doing the job.\n\nIn 2003 ‘Thrill Me’ was released as a limited edition 7” vinyl single and found its way to John Peel’s turntable. He introduced it on his show commenting, “And these are words I thought I would never be saying on radio again, a new single from The Undertones”. He liked it so much he played it twice, just as he did with ‘Teenage Kicks’ in 1978.\n\nIn 2016 the Band released vinyl remasters of ther first two LPs; ‘The Undertones – The Undertones’ and ‘The Undertones – Hypnotised’ along with a 7” vinyl remix of the 1979 single ‘Get Over You’. Remixed by Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine/Primal Scream). Michael Bradley also published his book Teenage Kicks: My Life As An Undertone’.\n\n2018 marked the 40th Anniversary of the release of their most influential and famous song, ’Teenage Kicks’. On 21st April for Record Store Day 2018 the band released a Vinyl Singles Box Set containing the 13 x 7” original Undertones singles from the classic early period: 1978-1983.\n\n2020 should have seen the band continue to perform widely with tours in the UK,USA and Europe but Covid stopped the world in its tracks so we all hunkered down and tried to make the best of it. The bands recorded legacy was marked with a double vinyl album ‘West Bank Songs’ with sleeve notes by Mick Houghton and Michael Bradley,\n\n2022 and 2023 will see The Undertones roaring back with an extensive European tour to promote the release of “ Dig What You Need“, on Dimple Discs. This sees selected tracks (many remixed) from the post reformation Albums available on vinyl for the first time. There will be a matching CD and download release."
