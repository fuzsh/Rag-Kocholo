        "text": "They were all teenagers with a love of music like the Small Faces.\n\nWhen Vinny left – at his mother’s insistence, to concentrate on his exams – his younger brother, Damian, not yet 15, took over on guitar.\n\nIf we were in America, we would have been a garage band. But we didn’t have a garage. So we were a bedroom band\n\nSchool pal Feargal Sharkey joined on vocals, because he had sang at the Feis in Derry.\n\n“Life in Derry was pretty grim in the 1970s, as you can imagine,” says Damian O’Neill. “There wasn’t much going on, particularly for teenagers. You had to make your own amusement. There were two ways to get your mind off all the crap that was going on. You either played football or music. We loved music.”\n\nTheir dad went guarantor on a credit union loan of £200 for the band to buy new equipment.\n\n“It was a lot of money back then – and our dad, god bless him, had a lot of belief in us. Our mum and dad were very, very supportive. And when we did get the gear we were making a hell of a racket. We went upstairs to my bedroom in the attic.\n\n“If we were in America, we would have been a garage band. But we didn’t have a garage. So we were a bedroom band. We evolved up there, doing covers.”\n\nBut we didn’t have a garage. So we were a bedroom band. We evolved up there, doing covers.”\n\nWhat helped their evolution also was listening “incessantly” to the latest releases by The Jam and The Clash on their sister Bernadette’s stereo, bought from a Freeman’s catalogue.\n\nIn February 1976, they played their first gig, at the St Mary’s Scout Hall in the Creggan.\n\n“Sharkey was a scout leader and he got us in there. We were in our teens and most of the crowd were wee bairns – nine year olds, ten year olds.”\n\nPlaying under the name The Hot Rods and on a stage that was no higher than ten inches off the ground, they performed four or five songs – “but it was fun”.\n\nThe following month, they played St Joseph’s Secondary School in Derry’s Westway and then the Top of the Hill Youth Centre before Doherty found the name The Undertones in a school history book.\n\nHe couldn’t believe nobody had written a song called ‘Teenage Kicks’ before\n\nIt was at their regular gigs, in The Casbah at the corner of Bridge Street and Orchard Street, that the band made a name for themselves. They also earned £30 per gig. In June 1977, they supported The Radiators from Space at UCD at a mini punk festival called Belfield’s Burning. Tragically, at the festival, during the Radiators’ set, a young fan was stabbed to death.\n\nThe band’s drummer Billy Doherty, who was wearing identical clothes to the suspect, had his collar felt after the show.\n\n“Oh, god, that was horrible,” says Damian. “They didn’t arrest Billy, but they interrogated him for three hours. We had to hang around until they released him.\n\n“They gave him hell. They didn’t beat him up, don’t get me wrong. It was a good cop-bad cop kind of thing. ‘So, Billy, why did you stab him?’\n\n“The guy who did the stabbing was supposedly wearing a white denim jacket, and Billy was wearing a white denim jacket. And because we were from the North I don’t think the police took too kindly to us.”\n\n​Later, the RUC went to interview Billy at his mother’s house. Things probably didn’t look too cheery – but then, a month later, the song that changed their lives came into being. A two-minute, 28-second symphony about adolescent lust,\n\nTeenage Kicks is one of the greatest songs ever written on this island. The immortal lines “I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight/Get teenage kicks right through the night, all right” were sung by Sharkey in his unapologetic Derry accent.\n\n​“John wrote the song in July, 1977,” says Damian. “I know that because I used to keep a diary. I still have it. He couldn’t believe nobody had written a song called ‘Teenage Kicks’ before. The word ‘kicks’ he definitely got from ‘get your kicks from Route 66’. And once he got the title, the song basically wrote itself. He wrote it in 20 minutes.”\n\nIn March, 1978, they recorded a demo of it at Derry’s Magee University. Legend has it that one day they left badges of the band into Terri Hooley’s record shop on Great Victoria Street in Belfast.\n\nHe heard their demo of Teenage Kicks and was impressed enough to offer them time to record it at Wizard Studios on Donegal Street for £200. But one of the most exhilarating pop songs ever almost went unrecorded.\n\nOn June 14, 1978, the day before the band were scheduled to record the song, they played Hooley’s Battle of the Bands at Queen’s University. A good night was had by all, especially Hooley.\n\n“He showed up halfway through,” says Damian. “He was very hungover. When we were knocking out the song, we looked through the control room and we could see him nodding off.”\n\nHe also recalls him bringing them sausage and chips.\n\nThat evening, Kevin Dyer, a 26-year-old plumber working for the Belfast City Hospital was abducted and murdered not far from where The Undertones were recording. His body was found in a rubbish tip.\n\nA few thousand copies of the EP were pressed up. In early September, it was released on Hooley’s Good Vibrations label.BBC DJ John Peel soon got a copy – and he played the song twice in one night on his radio show. (Peel had Teenage Kicks played at his funeral in 2004. “Teenage dreams, so hard to beat” is inscribed on his gravestone. )\n\nIn New York, Seymour Stein, head of Sire Records in New York who would sign Madonna and manage The Ramones, was impressed. He contacted Hooley. On October 2, 1978 , the Undertones signed a five-year deal with Sire.\n\nOn October 26, they performed Teenage Kicks on Top of the Pops. By November, the song had gone to No 31 on the UK singles chart.\n\nWe were the most anti-rock’n’roll band ever!\n\nIn 1979, Joe Strummer personally invited the band to support The Clash on their ‘Take the Fifth’ American tour.\n\n“He offered us six weeks but we only did three because John and Billy didn’t want to be away from their girlfriends for that long,” Damian laughs.\n\n“We had to also turn down tours of Japan because Billy and John didn’t want to be away. Now they regret it. But back then I couldn’t persuade them to be away from their girlfriends. We were the most anti-rock’n’roll band ever!”\n\nWhen someone graffitied ‘The Undertones’ on a wall in the Bogside, a wag painted the word ‘Hang’ beside the band’s name. Damian refutes this, and any such animus towards The Undertones\n\n“A lot of people back then hated punk. They didn’t get the concept of it. Derry is a rock town. To them, anything that was punk was shite. We got a lot of dogs’ abuse on the street – for years, even after we had hits.\n\n“People would be verbally abusing us, or even worse sometimes, physically abusing us. It’s kind of what put me off the place. In fact, I eventually left. I live in London.\n\n“It’s funny because there’s this new mural of us in Derry. Now, suddenly, we’re the heroes.”\n\nThe politics did emerge later, albeit buried vaguely in a catchy pop song.\n\nOriginally the song was going to be about the hunger strikes – but the verses were really naff\n\nOn May 5, 1981, they played their top ten hit It’s Going to Happen on Top of the Pops. Damian wore a black armband, as Bobby Sands had died on hunger strike in the Maze earlier that day. Asked how he got the armband past BBC officialdom, he says: “I don’t know how the hell they missed it! Maybe it was because nobody else wore the armband, it was just me.\n\n“I was convinced they were going to find out and ban us from the BBC forever. It would have got us into big trouble. In hindsight, I’m glad no one noticed.”\n\nIs the song referencing the hunger strike?\n\n“Yes and no,” he says. “It was originally. I had the chorus: ‘It’s going to happen all the time, until you change your mind.’ That is about the hunger strikers.\n\n“You’ve got to remember it was a really horrible, emotive time. We were behind them. We were fully supportive, because they were political prisoners after all.\n\n“They were being treated as common criminals – which is just bollocks – by Thatcher. So virtually every Catholic in Northern Ireland supported them, even if they didn’t support the IRA. I thought the song was my statement. I’m going to do something here.\n\n“Originally when I wrote the song it was going to be about the hunger strikes – but the verses were really naff. Then I gave it to Mickey and said: ‘Rescue this. Turn it into whatever you want.’ So, the verses are just a pop song. Nonsense really, but we kept the chorus.”\n\nIn 1983 Sharkey left the band to pursue a solo career. In late 1999, the Undertones reformed. When Sharkey chose not to re-join, Paul McLoone became the lead singer.\n\nNext Sunday, they play a sold-out and much-anticipated show at the Academy in Dublin. It’s subtitled ‘Celebrating 45 Years of Teenage Kicks’.\n\nTwo weeks ago a mural to the five Derry boys was unveiled on a gable wall in Castle Gate (it’s by Karl Porter, who also made the Derry Girls mural in the city).\n\n“Teenage Kicks is timeless,” says Damian. “It could have come out in the late 1950s, early 1960s. It’s got a major to minor chord sequence. It’s very simple to play. It’s infectious. The words resonate, and they always will with teenagers.”\n\nAnd teenagers at heart, I say.\n\n“Yeah, even now with 60 and 70-year-olds,” says the guitarist (who turns 63 on January 15). “There is an honesty to that song, and to all our songs, that people get and cherish.”\n\n​The Undertones are touring the island of Ireland from Friday, starting in Derry, and finishing in Kilkenny on November 30"
