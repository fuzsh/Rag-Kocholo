        "text": "There’s almost 2500 posts at PPM and this is the first one on Squeeze. There’s a reason for that. In all candor, they were never a group that really excited me in any way. I know many at the time [late 70s-early 80s] felt that songwriters Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook were the Lennon + McCartney of their era. Well, that might have something to do with my antipathy. I never much rated Lennon + McCartney much less a duo who might be their echo nearly 20 years later! But the first time I heard Squeeze was a very different scenario.\n\nAt the high school radio station I immediately gravitated to upon entering the student body, in 1978, we had a few current promos sent to us by I.R.S. and A+M Records. They were the only label that would service a 10 watt mono student station back then! We had received the first Squeeze album, and I heard the song touted on this album’s hype sticker. “Take Me I’m Yours” was to these young ears, a relentless earworm with the song built on a motorik synth pulse that was like a sonic tarpit I loved falling into. As we can see from the cover, it was very New Wave in its coloration! And so was that single! I loved that song but everything else that I heard from the album failed to ignite any interest.\n\nBack in the day, A+M Records was the only major label with much of a handle on New Wave. They seemed to be all-in on it as compared to…Atlantic Records. They had no problem putting out quirkily packaged records that even today, I’d buy copies of if I saw them in a bin [at he right price]. Squeeze was the beneficiary of some pretty outlandish packing gambits.\n\nLike this little beauty. Not only was it a holy 10″ record [there were not too many of those in 1979…] but the die-cut cover brilliantly illustrated this with a 12″ sleeve being “squeezed” by hands down to 10″ size. It managed to be a compilation of tracks from the band’s first two albums; usually in live or remixed single form. I never bought one of these, but these days, I don’t think I could resist such potent gimmix packaging. Even so, I managed to accrue five releases in my Record Cell with Squeeze represented.\n\nSqueeze: Take Me I’m Yours [Tiny Collector’s Edition] – US – 5″ [1980]\n\nIf I Didn’t Love You\n\nAnother Nail In My Heart\n\nI remember seeing this in 1980. I think chasinvictoria had a copy and when I finally saw one in maybe 1992 in a Tampa record store I took the bait. The 5″ single was unplayable on many automatic turntables, but as I was never going to actually play the record; just feed my exotic format fetish, that was fine by me. When I looked this release up just now, I honestly thought that the B-side was “Pulling Mussels From the Shell.” See? I can’t tell these Squeeze songs apart, for the most part. It remains the only pure Squeeze release in my Record Cell… but I have a few appearances by the band on compilations.\n\nVarious: Steppin’ Into The 80s – Netherlands – LP [1980]\n\nJoe Jackson: Geraldine & John\n\nPaul Collins’ Beat: Rock ‘n Roll Girl\n\nJules And The Polar Bears: Good Reason\n\nThe Nits: The Young Reporter\n\n20/20: Cheri\n\nLive Wire: Money\n\nThe Only Ones: Another Girl, Another Planet\n\nDavid Werner: What’s Right\n\nNina Hagen: Auf’m Rummel\n\nBruce Woolley: English Garden\n\nThe Romantics: What I Like About You\n\nWhite Honey: Nothing Going On In The City\n\nMi-Sex: A Loser\n\nThe Sinceros: I Still Miss You\n\nSqueeze: Another Nail In My Heart\n\nAfter The Fire: One Rule For You\n\nThis was another album that I first encountered in the collection of chasinvictoria. Goodness knows where he came upon a Dutch New Wave comp from 1980, but at least it’s a great one! Lots of New Wave and Power Pop. Most of which was more interesting to me than Squeeze, represented here once more by “Another Nail In My Heart.” This was another album that I eventually found my copy of maybe a decade later than chasinvictoria. Probably at some record show. I bought this specifically for the David Werner and Nina Hagen tracks.\n\nChasinvictoria might have played “Auf’m Rummel” which translates to “At The Carnival.” I think I have only ever played the Hagen and Werner cuts off of this. It’s still my favorite song of the Nina Hagen Band era material. One day I need to digitize this and make a CD of it… and report back with my findings!\n\nVarious: Teenage Kicks [UK Pop v. 1 1976-79]\n\nNick Lowe: So It Goes\n\nEddie & The Hot Rods: Do Anything You Wanna Do\n\nNick Lowe: Mary Provost\n\nWreckless Eric: Whole Wide World\n\nThe Motors Dancing The Night Away\n\nTom Robinson Band 2-4-6-8 Motorway\n\nKursaal Flyers Television Generation\n\nSqueeze: Take Me, I’m Yours\n\nThe Only Ones: Another Girl, Another Planet\n\nXTC: This Is Pop?\n\nThe Boys: Brickfield Nights\n\nThe Motors: Airport\n\nJilted John: Jilted John\n\nThe Rezillos: Top Of The Pops\n\nRich Kids: Ghosts Of Princes In Towers\n\nThe Undertones: Teenage Kicks\n\nYachts: Look Back In Love (Not In Anger)\n\nThe Pleasers: A Girl I Know (Precis Of A Friend)\n\nSkids: Into The Valley\n\nRhino released a spate of the D.I.Y. series of New Wave era compilations in 1993; the year that New Wave Comps on CD officially became a trend. Our friend Squeeze are here with their first UK Top 10 single, the enchanting “Take Me I’m Yours.” But I’ll admit that this whole CD is pretty fabbo from start to finish. I see The Only Ones are here again with the same track as on the last record we examined. Memo to self: review this album one day.\n\nVarious: Starry Eyes [UK Pop v. 2 1978-1979] – US – CD [1993]\n\nBuzzcocks: Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve)\n\nThe Undertones: Get Over You\n\nYachts: Yachting Types\n\nJoe Jackson: Is She Really Going Out With Him?\n\nStarjets: Schooldays\n\nBram Tchaikovsky: Girl Of My Dreams\n\nThe Squares: This Is Airebeat\n\nXTC: Life Begins At The Hop\n\nSqueeze: Up The Junction\n\nThe Jags: Back Of My Hand (I’ve Got Your Number)\n\nThe Radiators: Let’s Talk About The Weather\n\nThe Records: Starry Eyes\n\nZones: Mourning Star\n\nPurple Hearts: Millions Like Us\n\nThe Distractions: Time Goes By So Slow\n\nThe Searchers: Hearts In Her Eyes\n\nThe Revillos: Where’s The Boy For Me?\n\nMo-Dettes: White Mice\n\nThe Tourists: So Good To Be Back Home Again\n\nI also own the Rhino companion volume to the previous CD. Once more, Squeeze are represented. This time by the more representative kitchen-sink dullness of “Up The Junction” than a more lively single like “Take Me I’m Yours.” Why was this in the Record Cell? It was the only way to get the holy Revillos on CD in dark ages of 1993! Not that the rest of the volume was chopped liver.\n\nVarious: Just In Time For Christmas – US – CD [1990]\n\nSqueeze: Christmas Day\n\nRebel Pebbles: Cool Yule\n\nKlark Kent: Yo Ho Ho\n\nTorch Song: Hark\n\nReckless Sleepers: Every Day Will Be Like A Holiday\n\nSteve Hunter: We Three Kings\n\nThe dB’s: Home For The Holidays\n\nMolly Johnson And Norman Orenstein: Silent Night\n\nDeborah Holland: It Only Comes Once A Year\n\nTimbuk 3: All I Want For Christmas\n\nKennedy Rose: More Than One Night A Year\n\nDread Zeppelin: All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth\n\nWall Of Voodoo: Shouldn’t Have Given Him A Gun For Christmas\n\nBy 1990, when this compilation came out, I.R.S. Records was a shadow of its former self. The scrappy New Wave oriented label of 1979 had in a decade lost its bearings and its top selling band when R.E.M. jumped ship to WEA. Why did I buy this? I was compiling a Klark Kent kompilation and a track appeared only here. Plus, it had the Torch Song track from their xmas flexidisc [that you can’t afford] here on a freaking CD! I.R.S. was in such artistic dire straits by 1990, that to this day I have never played this CD! So I can’t very well vouch for the merits or of the Squeeze track…for good or ill.\n\nSqueeze managed to get a US hit by 1987 with the annoying “Hourglass” single after nearly a decade of existence where they actually split up for a few years and only their fans may have noticed. Me? I still can’t be bothered since the band that made “Take Me I’m Yours” quickly vanished to be replaced with what seemed like run of the mill Pub Rock to these ears. Your mileage may vary.\n\n-30-"
