        "text": "I just heard \"Teenage Kicks\" for the first time, yet I'm picking it over the Buzzcocks tune for this very reason. (And I'm familiar with the Fine Young Cannibals cover as well, btw.)\n\nTeenage Kicks is one of those tunes that just has a magic 'something extra' that you can't quite put your finger on.\n\nThe Buzzcocks tune is great but it doesn't really have that. For me, anyway.\n\nTwo absolute, monster classics and are among my very favourite songs of all time. With that said, Kicks kicks.\n\nPlus...Kicks wasn't in Shrek 2. Can't say that about the other tune. Automatic demerit.\n\nI love Teenage Kicks, and have played it live so many times to audiences who've lapped it up.\n\nBut.... Ever Fallen In Love is by far my favourite of the 2, what a song!\n\nI love both but I get interference from that squeaky-voiced Fine Young Cannibals character when I think of \"Ever Fallen In Love.\"\n\nNot fair, I know, but it's enough to make \"Ever Fallen In Love\" not my favorite Buzzcocks song. I suppose \"What Do I Get\" would be the one.\n\n\"Teenage Kicks\" is all that Peel said it is.\n\nHuge fan of both bands but could never understand the praise that Teenage Kicks received. Lots of songs I prefer from the first Undertones LP (Family Entertainment, Jump Boys, Male Model, Wrong Way...)\n\nPete Shelley is amongst the greatest songwriters of all times and Ever Fallen In Love is just one example that proves it\n\nI was a bit surprised to read that about Peel too, but i think for him, its one of those songs that scratch the right itch for him, had that excitement and fun and spontaneity that you can't really explain. I think we all have songs like that, that you crank up and jump around like you're 12 again. I think Teenage Kicks did that for him\n\nAgree with this. Lots of great songs on Hypnotised too. My favourite Undertones single is You've Got My Number (Why Don't You Use It?). Undertones & Buzzcocks are my 2 favourite bands from the punk era."
