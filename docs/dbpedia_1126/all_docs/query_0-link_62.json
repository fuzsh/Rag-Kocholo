        "text": "In 1976 punk took Britain by surprise and for one brief moment challenged some of the society’s cultural and social assumptions, shocking public opinion and causing an outbreak of moral panic in its wake. In Northern Ireland, a scene soon emerged too and coalesced around record shops such as Caroline Records and Good Vibrations, venues such as The Pound and The Harp in Belfast or The Casbah in Derry, and bands such as RUDI, The Undertones, Stiff Little Fingers, The Outcasts, Ruefrex, Victim, and scores of others. Much has been made in recent years of the largely cross-community nature of the Northern Ireland punk scene, and rightly so. In a region whose history often appears dark and bleak, the punk experience appears as a breath of fresh air. However, less has been written about what Northern Ireland bands actually sang about. Indeed, one of the main attractions of punk was not only the raw, raucous music, but also the fact that it enabled the exploration of a whole new range of themes by anyone able and willing to start a band. For the first time in years, young people were able to express their own views to an audience made of people their own age. So what did they choose to express? During the course of for my research on Northern Ireland punk, I decided to classify songs from the first wave of Northern Ireland punk (1976-1983) in order to determine their main thematic concerns [1]. After analysing over two hundred songs, I found that over a third of them tackle various social and political issues; a quarter deal with romantic and sexual relationships; and ten percent are concerned with aspects of teenage pop culture [2].\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, among the songs dealing with social and political issues, only a fifth revolve around the ‘Troubles’ (six percent of all songs). The band most associated with this stance is Belfast’s Stiff Little Fingers. The group’s very first single, ‘Suspect Device / Wasted Life’ (1978), criticizes sectarianism and paramilitary violence in no uncertain terms: ‘Inflammable material, planted in my head / It's a suspect device that's left two thousand dead’; ‘They make us feel indebted / For saving us from hell / And then they put us through it / It's time the bastards fell’. In ‘Wasted Life’, singer Jake Burns shouts ‘Stuff their fucking armies / Killing isn't my idea of fun’ and, in the last verse, compares paramilitaries to Nazis: ‘Still they come up to me / With a different name but the same old face / I can see the connection / With another time and a different place / Now, they ain't blonde-haired or blue-eyed / But they think that they're a master race’. These songs constitute some of the most explicit attacks on para-militarism in the Northern Ireland popular music repertoire; however, after the release of that single, the band rarely again criticised paramilitaries in such an explicit manner. Most of the songs that followed, and especially those which appeared on their 1979 debut album Inflammable Material, made heavy use of conflict-related iconography, while actually dealing with unrelated issues. This reliance on ‘radical chic’ was part of a conscious strategy to break into the overseas market – and it worked. Stiff Little Fingers’ success came at a price: for a long time, the band was resented by punks in Northern Ireland who objected to the use of the ‘Troubles’ as a marketing tool. However, while they were the most famous punk group to refer to the conflict, they were not the only one to do so. A few other bands from the era explicitly dealt with this thorny issue. For instance, in ‘The System is Here’ by the Ex-Producers, the narrator laments the local tendency to vote along sectarian lines: ‘You're afraid to change or rearrange / Just keep your permanent vote / Your voting's done by colours / Black and white / Green and orange / Left and right’. ‘Mixed Up World’ by Victim expresses disappointment over the failure of all attempts to transcend sectarianism: ‘This is a mixed-up world that we’re living in / We say we’re going to change it now but we just can’t win / We gotta sit together now, maybe this will end / But we know there’s no chance of that’. The Defects’ ‘We Don’t Care’ constitutes an aggressive denunciation of the ruling élite: ‘You read your paper everyday / But don't listen to what the bastards say / They build you up then kick you down / Too much power for pathetic clowns’; ‘How much longer can they rule / Threatening the world like we’re fools / Propaganda filled with hate / If you’ve got brains ignore their bait’. However, the most clearly political and most actively antisectarian off all the first wave punk bands is probably Ruefrex, whose songs frequently depicted the realities of life amidst the ‘Troubles’. While Stiff Little Fingers were accused of using the conflict for their own advancement, Ruefrex put into practice the anti-sectarianism they preached: they played not only in the ‘neutral’ venues of Belfast town centre or in the safety of their own Protestant community, but all over the region, including republican neighbourhoods of Belfast such as Ardoyne, the Falls or Turf Lodge. Ruefrex’s political commitment could get the band in trouble. In 1985, they released ‘Wild Colonial Boy’, a biting indictment of the Irish Americans who funded the Provisional IRA. The song, which also accused Americans of perpetuating Irish stereotypes and of mistreating the African American population, can be summed up by its final lines: ‘It really gives me quite a thrill / To kill from far away’. When the song received airplay on BBC Radio One, the band was wrongly accused by some of being pro-loyalist. This led them to be called ‘Orange Bastards’ by Elvis Costello and to be dropped from the support slot of a planned US tour with The Pogues. However, Ruefrex’s uncompromising stance was an exception: generally speaking, even the more political punk songs didn’t blame or name anyone in particular. Rather than a form of political analysis, most songs about the ‘Troubles’ were an appeal to common sense; they expressed individual rather than collective discontent with the status quo.\n\nOther songs from local bands didn’t address the political aspects of the ‘Troubles’ so much as their effects on the everyday lives of teenagers. This is the subject of one of the most famous of Stiff Little Fingers’ songs, ‘Alternative Ulster’: ‘What we need / Is an Alternative Ulster / Grab it and change it, it's yours / Get an Alternative Ulster / Ignore the bores and their laws’. Although the song has often been interpreted as a demand for radical political change, its main concern, as the first verse reveals, is the lack of opportunities for teenagers to have fun in 1970s Northern Ireland:\n\nThere's nothing for us in Belfast\n\nThe Pound's old, and that's a pity\n\nOK, so there's the Trident in Bangor\n\nAnd then you walk back to the city\n\nWe ain't got nothing but they don't really care\n\nThey don't even know you know\n\nThey just want money, we can take it or leave it\n\nThe song is primarily ‘about being bored out of your skull in Belfast’, as Jake Burns told Melody Maker in 1980[ 3]. Boredom was one of the most prominent themes in early punk rock: The Buzzcocks sang about it (‘Boredom’), as did The Clash ('London’s Burning’). Although ‘Alternative Ulster’ seems to attack the British armed forces and the police (‘Take a look where you're living / You got the army on the street / And the RUC dog of repression / Is barking at your feet’), they are singled out mainly because they stand in the way of young people’s desires, not because they embody an imperialist branch of the state, as later Northern Ireland anarcho-punk bands would contend. Anything and anyone that got in the way of teenage leisure and pleasure could be the subject of punk abuse, whether the army, the RUC, or parents. For example, ‘P-Check’ by The Ex-Producers deals with the frustration of being stopped by the RUC at checkpoints to be questioned: ‘They wanna know, they wanna know / My name, my address / My DOB / The company I keep / Where I'm going’. More famously, RUDI expressed their frustration about the police’s mistreatment of punks in ‘Cops’. The song, which begins and ends with chants of ‘SS RUC, SS RUC’, was written in reaction to the RUC’s violent reaction following the ‘riot’ which followed the last-minute cancellation of a concert by The Clash in October 1977 – one of the founding myths of the Northern Ireland punk scene.\n\nYet the ‘Troubles’ and its effects were far from the only social and political issue that punks sang about. In fact, as we said earlier, a fifthof those songs addressed the conflict. Most songs were preoccupied with other concerns. For instance, ‘White Noise’ by Stiff Little Fingers, ‘Suggestions’ by Acme and ‘Smash The Front’ by Stalag 17 dealt with racism, particularly in the context of the increasing influence of the British National Front. ‘Mercenary’ by the Co-ordinates, ‘Cause or Consequence’ by Victim, ‘Capital Letters’ by Ruefrex and ‘Tin Soldiers’ by Stiff Little Fingers denounced militarism and war abroad rather than at home. ‘Hits and Misses’ by Stiff Little Fingers and ‘Disco’ by the Co-ordinates tackled the issue of violence against women. ‘Nine to Five’ by The Androids and ‘Live in Pain’ by The Defects were ‘anti-work’ songs (‘Why must I suffer such a strain / I wasn't made for the factory / I don't need security / I just want to follow my rules’, sing The Defects). The frustration of having to join the adult world was also reflected in songs like ‘Prelude’ by The Co-Ordinates, ‘College Boys’ by White Noise, ‘Future Plans’ by Shock Treatment and ‘Don’t Wanna Be No Adult’ by The Outcasts. These songs reveal that for young punks in Northern Ireland, the ‘Troubles’ and its effects were a fact of life; but so were unemployment, poverty, racism, the worrying rise of right-wing populism and the necessity to strike out on one’s own in a frightening world. Far from being inward-looking, Northern Irish bands sang about issues which had resonance on an international rather than simply on a local level. This isn’t surprising considering that punk was a transnational phenomenon: from Paris to Berlin, from Barcelona to Belfast punk bands sang about the social issues that affected young people everywhere. This shows that, despite the ‘Troubles’, Northern Ireland could be more outward-looking than it is sometimes given credit for.\n\nIf punk, in Northern Ireland as elsewhere, enabled the expression of social and political concerns which usually weren’t addressed in popular music, it also delved into previously unexplored aspects of popular culture. Previous rock genres had shown interest in high fantasy and space opera – the members of Led Zeppelin were obsessed with J.R.R. Tolkien; Rick Wakeman created concept albums about the Legends of the Round Table and Jules Verne; Marc Bolan, in his pre-glam era, sang about unicorns and dragons. By contrast, punk bands were fascinated by more lurid, sensationalist forms of popular culture: crime fiction, B-movies, horror. In the US, The Ramones frequently referenced horror films (‘Chain Saw’ was inspired by Tobe Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) while ‘Pinhead’ is a nod to Todd Browning's Freaks (1932)). The Cramps made camp B-movie iconography the hallmark of their style. In Britain, The Adverts imagined what it would be like to receive the transplant of a pair of eyes formerly belonging to a serial killer (‘Gary Gilmore’s Eyes’). To a certain extent, punk aesthetics in general were inspired by the world of pornography, horror and criminality (bondage trousers, fishnets, outrageous makeup, ransom note typography...). Northern Irish punks were no different. Similar themes found their way into many local punk songs: ‘The Cops are Coming’ by The Outcasts deals with a necrophiliac killer; ‘Lizzie Borden’ by Stage B is about the eponymous 19th century American murderer. In The Undertones’ ‘There Goes Norman’, the deranged character will, according to the narrator, ‘poke out your eyes’. Perhaps some of these songs reflected anxiety about ‘Troubles’-related violence. After all, sectarian murders were still a reality; most of the members of the Shankill Butchers were being tried during the heyday of the first wave of Northern Irish punk. Whether consciously or not, this concern seems to appear in songs like ‘Victim’ by Rabies: ‘Dead of night / When it's quiet on the streets / No one will protect you / In the dead of night’. However, other punk songs which were inspired by the horror genre dealt not with human killers but with other-than-human monsters. For instance, The Outcasts sang about zombies (‘Clinical Love’) and cyborgs (‘Cyborg’); ‘Bewerewolf!’ by RUDI features a werewolf. On a psychoanalytical level, monsters are often associated with fear of the changing, ‘mutating’ adolescent body and repressed sexual desire, but they may also be read on another level as ‘transgressors of the social practice, beings that violate accepted cultural codes’ [4]. Since the primary context of the reception of these songs, which often feature ‘unnatural’ couplings, was the largely cross-community local punk subculture, they remind us that punks were ‘monsters’ in the sense that they threatened to disrupt some of Northern Irish’s society cultural codes by revealing the arbitrary nature of the ‘us/them’ binary and by disrupting the process of sectarian ‘othering’. In ‘Cyborg’, The Outcasts sang: ‘We are the new generation / We are the new scientific creation / Half-machine, half-boy and girl / Sent to overrun the rule of nature’. It is interesting in this regard to note that the word monstrum – which in Latin means ‘portent’ – derives from the etymon monere: ‘to warn’. The Outcasts’ hymn to hybridity contains such a warning: ‘You are the old days, we are the new ways / You are the old ways, we are the new days’. Sectarianism’s days were numbered.\n\nMore surprising for punk, perhaps, is the large number of songs which deal with romantic and sexual relationships. In Sounds magazine in 1977, rock journalist Vivien Goldman said about the punk scene that ‘No one's singing love songs any more, but that ain't conviction, that's fashion’. And yet punk bears a more ambiguous relationship to romance and pop music than is often assumed. American bands like The Ramones and Blondie, and, arguably, English bands like The Damned, Generation X or The Buzzcocks were influenced by pop melodies and tropes. In Northern Ireland, a quarter of songs from the first wave of punk are about love or sex.Some of these are straightforward, heartfelt songs about romantic relationships. In ‘Sometimes’ by RUDI, the narrator sings: ‘The tears I cry / At nights I lie / And I could not sleep at all / I dream of you / I scream for you / To the picture on my wall’. In a scene which evokes romantic comedies, the jilted lover who appears in The Tearjerkers’ ‘Love Affair’ is ‘Waiting in the rain at the stop / For the bus to show / My feet are getting wet and the drizzle is soaking through my coat’. Even The Outcasts, despite their tough reputation, occasionally indulged in love songs: ‘I want to see her every day on the bus / And I dream of asking her out / But I turn red / Sweat dripping down my face / And I'm feeling such a freak / So what will I do? I'm self-conscious over you’ (‘Self-Concious Over You’). Many other bands did the same: ‘She’s 19’ by The Moondogs, ‘Just Want Your Attention’ by Protex, ‘It really doesn't matter’ by The Starjets, ‘Barbed Wire Love’ by Stiff Little Fingers, etc. However, these punk ‘love songs’ were counterbalanced by ‘hate songs’ which expressed suspicion of romantic feelings or sometimes even outright misogyny: for example, ‘Bad News’ by Acme, ‘Bitch’ by The Defects, ‘ Love You for Never’ by The Outcasts, ‘A Place In Your Heart’ by Protex, ‘Just Fade Away’ by Stiff Little Fingers, ‘I’m Not Your Type’ by The Tinopeners, to give just a few. Of course, the Northern Irish punk band most associated with ‘pop punk’ and songs about ‘chocolate and girls’ is The Undertones, whose ‘Teenage Kicks’ has become the region’s most famous punk – and, perhaps, pop music – anthem. No other band was able to capture the teenage experience with as much candour and humour as the boys from Derry. Full of irony, their songs depicted neither self-assured ‘cock rockers’, nor love-struck teenyboppers, but a quintessentially punk figure: the loser. Indeed, in The Undertones’ songs, the characters’ love is almost always unrequited; often, the objects of their affection don’t even seem to be aware fully of their existence. The Undertones narrator is often cast in the position of voyeur: he’s in love with yet ‘another’ girl who ‘walks down the street’ (‘Teenage Kicks’); he falls under the spell of a girl he watches dancing (‘Hypnotised’); at the beach, he keeps ‘on looking for the girls with their faces all tanned / They're lying on the beaches all covered in sand / Stretching out their long legs lying in the sun’ (‘Here Comes the Summer’). For The Undertones, love and sex seem to be something that only ever happens to other people or from a safe distance. Even in ‘I Know A Girl’, where the tone at first seems more triumphant, nothing indicates that the narrator has finally found love (or sex). He simply knows a girl, and she is (perhaps) aware of the fact that he likes her: ‘I know a girl / I know that she knows about me / She’s not just a girl / I think she knows how I feel’. By using pop tropes and melodies in punk songs, and by placing such hopeless ‘losers’ within them, The Undertones sent up pop conventions; they both celebrated and parodied pop music. Yet underlying this apparent frivolity, there was a more serious side to their songs. Some of the characters they depicted are ‘losers’ in a more literal sense: they are left behind by life, stuck in seemingly inextricable situations. For instance, Jimmy is smothered by his mother (‘Jimmy Jimmy’) and the narrator of ‘My Perfect Cousin’ by family expectations. The young woman who appears in the song ‘(She's A) Run-Around’ ‘wants to leave home but she can't get away’; ‘she wishes she could live in a world of her own / Go someplace where she's not known’. In ‘Gotta Getta’, a young man seems to want to escape from home, but his car breaks down, preventing him from doing so: ‘He turns ignition on and it's ready to start / As the car begins to move he feels it falling apart’. The narrator of ‘Boys Will Be Boys’ is abandoned by a friend: ‘John's gone he's left on a bus / In a hurry he's forgotten about us’. Life seems to pass these characters by. They’re stuck in their hometown with no chance of escaping. To a certain extent, this may reflect the reality of 1970s Derry, where there were few prospects for most young people. But Derry or Northern Ireland are never mentioned: the lack of geographical context makes these songs timeless. They could apply to teenagers or indeed anyone in any place and time. Moreover, despite the feeling of claustrophobia that the lyrics may elicit, the tone of the music is joyful rather than pathetic. Feargal Sharkey’s voice gives an urgency to the group’s lyrics; the power pop melodies make one want to dance (or pogo). The Undertones never indulge in pathos; they don’t give the listener the time to feel sorry about themselves or about the characters they depict. They make light of their own situation; they make fun of their own inadequacy. If punks knew how to laugh at themselves, The Undertones did it better than most.\n\nThe Undertones made a conscious decision not to sing about the ‘Troubles’ (although there were a few exceptions, most famously ‘It’s Going To Happen’, which referenced the 1981 hunger strikes). In an interview given in 1978 in the fanzine Alternative Ulster, guitar player and main lyricist John O’Neill explained why: ‘We really have to make the best out of situations in Derry & N.Ireland to find something to write about that doesn’t sound too contrived (eg: straight politics). Our music has to [reflect] our everyday life or else it just isn’t honest’ [5]. O’Neill appeals to a core value of the punk subculture: authenticity. For The Undertones – and, indeed, for a lot of other bands from the first wave of Northern Ireland punk – singing about love, desire and teenage frustration was more authentic than talking about the ‘Troubles’. Undoubtedly, it also provided them with an escape from an often difficult everyday life. And yet the significance of singing about love in a conflict-ridden society should not be underestimated. Despite their affiliation with a subculture which was reputed for its suspicion of romantic love and of commercial culture, many of the young people involved in the punk scene aspired for a ‘normal’ adolescent life: a life of pleasure and carefree fun. They knew that this was made more difficult by the ‘Troubles’ and Northern Ireland’s high rate of unemployment – but it wasn’t completely out of their reach. In fact, because punk placed an emphasis on local live music-making, it motivated young people to venture out of their neighbourhoods to attend or play concerts or to meet up with other punks. They invested spaces where, for a while at least, they could concentrate on being teenagers and deal with adolescent problems, such as crushes, sex and growing up – and more often than not, in cross-community settings. In a deeply divided society, where affiliation with one of the two rival groups was a prerequisite for social integration, where sectarian partisanship and social conformity were the norm, this was itself a bold, transgressive, empowering act. Punk not only enabled young people to express themselves through song – it allowed them to create and shape their own world.\n\nBorn in Belfast and raised in France, Tim A. Heron is currently a lecturer at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne. He holds a PhD in Irish Studies and is involved in research about the punk subculture, both in Ireland and in France. His wider interests lie with history, literature and popular and alternative culture.\n\n[1] These songs were taken from the discography compiled in what remains the most exhaustive book to date on Northern Ireland punk: Sean O’Neill and Guy Trelford’s brilliant It Makes You Want to Spit: The Definitive Guide to Punk in Northern Ireland (Reekus Music, 2003).\n\n[2] Concerning the social and political issues and songs about personal relationships, these proportions come close to the findings of rock journalist and academic Dave Laing’s own classification of early British punk, in his seminal 1985 book One Chord Wonders.\n\n[3] LINK, Roland.
