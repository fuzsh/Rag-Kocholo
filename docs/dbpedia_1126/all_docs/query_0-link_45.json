        "text": "The Bands That Started It All & Their Iconic Songs\n\nAfter a few influential bands, like The Velvet Underground and MC5, opened the door to raw, unique sounds and aggressive energy in the 1960s, there was a punk rock explosion in the 1970s. Bands like the Ramones, Suicide, and The Dead Boys embraced a minimalist and fast-paced musical approach never seen before. Each of these innovators held a different style and sound, but at their core, they shared the same punk rock ethos of individuality, attitude, and artistic expression. And with that, I present you with the 12 most iconic punk rock songs of the 1970s.\n\n“Ghost Rider” by Suicide\n\n“Ghost Rider” is a song by the band Suicide that was released in 1977. It is part of their self-titled debut album and is known for its raw and minimalist sound. The song incorporates a repetitive drum machine beat, eerie synth lines, and despair-filled lyrics sung by Alan Vega. With its dark and menacing atmosphere, “Ghost Rider” captures the essence of Suicide’s unique blend of punk, new wave, and electronic music. The lyrics depict a sense of isolation and desperation, painting a haunting image of a restless spirit roaming the streets on a motorcycle. This track has had a lasting impact on various genres and is celebrated as a defining song of the post-punk era, showcasing the band’s avant-garde style and relentless energy.\n\nAND fun fact – the term “punk” has been said to originate from a flyer promoting the band Suicide.\n\n“Blitzkrieg Bop” by the Ramones\n\n“Blitzkrieg Bop” you know. If you don’t, leave this website and go cry or something. That’s embarrassing. Anywho. The legendary song which all should know was released in 1976 as the first track on the Ramones‘ debut album Ramones. The chorus forces any listener to jam along, that “Hey ho, let’s go!” has become an iconic chant associated with the Ramones. Fans worldwide use it as a symbol of punk rock and rebellion, as “Blitzkrieg Bop” continues to inspire musicians and fans, solidifying its status as a timeless punk rock anthem.\n\n“Anarchy in the U.K.” by Sex Pistols\n\n“Anarchy in the U.K.” is also one everyone should know. Released by the Sex Pistols in 1976, it quickly became an influential song in the punk rock movement, capturing the spirit of disillusionment and rebellion of the late 1970s. The song criticizes the social and political establishment, advocating for anarchism and individual freedom. With its aggressive sound and provocative lyrics, it resonated with a generation seeking change. “Anarchy in the U.K.” remains a quintessential punk rock song that energizes and inspires listeners to this day.\n\n“London Calling” by The Clash\n\nThe Clash released “London Calling” in 1979. It combines elements of punk rock, reggae, and rockabilly, with politically charged lyrics. Not only that, but it captures the spirit of rebellion and addresses social and political issues of the time, such as unemployment and nuclear threat. It features a catchy guitar riff, strong vocals, and a driving rhythm section. “London Calling” redefined punk rock and solidified The Clash‘s reputation as an influential band. Even after four decades, it remains a timeless anthem, inspiring new generations of musicians and cementing its status as a classic punk rock song.\n\n“Teenage Kicks” by The Undertones\n\nThe Undertones‘ “Teenage Kicks” remains one of the band’s most iconic and influential tracks, capturing the essence of teenage angst and euphoria. Released in 1978, its catchy melody, energetic guitar riffs, and relatable lyrics, the song resonated with listeners seeking an escape from the mundane routines of everyday life. Written by John O’Neill, “Teenage Kicks” expresses a universal desire for excitement, freedom, and the unforgettable experiences of adolescence. It has become an anthem for generations of music lovers, defining the vibrant spirit of punk rock and connecting with audiences across different eras. If you haven’t listened to “Teenage Kicks” yet, I highly recommend experiencing this f*cking masterpiece.\n\n“Neat Neat Neat” by The Damned\n\nReleased as a single in February 1977, “Neat Neat Neat” by The Damned later became part of their debut studio album, Damned Damned Damned. The song is highly regarded as a classic from the punk rock era. With its energetic guitar riffs, fast-paced drums, and edgy vocals, it embodies the raw and rebellious spirit of punk music. The lyrics, though seemingly nonsensical at times, contribute to the song’s charm and reflect the punk ethos of breaking free from societal norms. The Damned, alongside other influential bands like the Sex Pistols and The Clash, played a vital role in shaping the punk rock genre in the late 1970s. “Neat Neat Neat” remains a beloved and influential track, serving as a testament to The Damned’s unique sound and the lasting impact of punk rock on music.\n\n“Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve)” by Buzzcocks\n\nShowing punk has a heart, the Buzzcocks brought “Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve)” to the world in 1978. Released as a single and later included on their album Love Bites, the song explores the theme of falling in love with someone who may not be the best choice. It was written by Pete Shelley, the band’s lead vocalist and guitarist. The track’s catchy melody and relatable lyrics have made it one of Buzzcocks‘ most well-known songs. It has been covered by various artists and featured in various forms of media, solidifying its status as an enduring classic in the punk rock genre.\n\n“Personality Crisis” by New York Dolls\n\n“Personality Crisis” is a famous song by the American rock band New York Dolls. It was featured on their debut album released in 1973 and is known for its catchy hooks, energetic performance, and distinctive glam rock sound. The song explores themes of identity, self-expression, and societal pressures to conform. “Personality Crisis” has had a significant impact on the punk rock genre and solidified the New York Dolls‘ status as pioneers of punk rock and influential figures in rock and roll history.\n\n“Search and Destroy” by The Stooges\n\nComing out in 1973, “Search and Destroy” by the Stooges (with frontman Iggy Pop) is known for its high-energy and rebellious vibe. The song’s aggressive guitar riffs, pounding drums, and Iggy Pop‘s raw and intense vocals combine to create a powerful and exhilarating experience. The lyrics express a sense of frustration and alienation, reflecting the band’s confrontational attitude. One of the best punk rock songs AND the greatest rock songs to ever hit the world. And that’s a fact, Jack.\n\n“Sonic Reducer” by The Dead Boys\n\n“Sonic Reducer” is a punk rock song by The Dead Boys, featured on their 1977 album Young, Loud and Snotty. It is a renowned punk rock anthem known for its energetic guitar riffs, aggressive vocals, and driving rhythm. The lyrics convey rebellion and frustration, typical of punk music. The song has influenced many punk rock bands and has been covered by various artists, retaining its raw and intense sound that resonates with fans of the genre.\n\n“Cherry Bomb” by the Runaways\n\n“Cherry Bomb” by the all-female rock band, the Runaways, was released in 1976 as the opening track to their debut album. Now, that’s one way to enter the rock world. The song became an anthem for female empowerment in the male-dominated rock industry, with its rebellious sound and catchy lyrics. It showcases the band’s unique blend of punk, rock and roll, and glam rock influences. “Cherry Bomb” remains a beloved classic and symbolizes the Runaways‘ place in rock history and the genre of women in rock. Its energetic and unapologetic nature continues to captivate audiences today.\n\n“Alternative Ulster” by Stiff Little Fingers"
