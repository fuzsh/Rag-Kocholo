        "text": "King Crimson founder Robert Fripp and his wife, singer Toyah Willcox, have shared a cover of The Undertones‘ ‘Teenage Kicks’ – watch it below.\n\nREAD MORE: Toyah Willcox and Robert Fripp’s 10 best lockdown covers – ranked!\n\nThe cover is a part of the pair’s ‘Sunday Lunch’ video series which returns today (January 16) after a brief break for the holidays. Launched in 2020, the series has so far seen the couple share renditions of songs by Nirvana, David Bowie, Metallica, Billy Idol, The Rolling Stones, Judas Priest, The Prodigy, Guns N’ Roses, Alice Cooper and more through Willcox’s YouTube channel.\n\nTheir last performance as part of the series came on December 19 and saw them share a cover of The Stooges classic ‘I Wanna Be Your Dog’. Filmed in their kitchen, Fripp donned dramatic black eyeshadow, while Willcox waved around a bone-shaped dog toy.\n\nFor their reworking of ‘Teenage Kicks’, the 1978 debut single from the Northern Irish punk band, the pair get up close and personal with the camera, while Willcox, wearing a see-through half blouse and heart-shaped, black nipple covers, pulls tissues from a box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“What a year 2021 was, lets kick start 2022 as we mean to carry on….. Direct from the most famous kitchen of lockdown – this is a version of Teenage Kicks you wont forget!!!” Willcox captioned the new video. You can watch their latest cover below.\n\nNot totally abandoning fans during the Christmas period, Fripp and Willcox did share a number of festive songs and carols over the latter part of December, including ‘Ding Dong Merrily On High’ and ‘Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer’.\n\nRecommended\n\nWillcox revealed last February that her Sunday Lockdown Lunch video series started because her husband, King Crimson‘s Robert Fripp, was having withdrawals from performing.\n\nIn August, Willcox released her 16th studio album ‘Posh Pop’, which she previewed with the single ‘Levitate’ featuring Simon Darlow and Bobby Willcox.\n\nDiscussing the album in a recent interview with NME, Willcox explained how it came about. “When COVID stopped everything last year, it allowed me to concentrate on writing and recording the next album,” she said. “We recorded in Simon’s outdoor studio with just him, my husband and I.\n\n“‘Posh Pop’ was a magical experience created out of the need and ability to make contact with our fans in a heartfelt way. Also the terrifying distance between those who run the world and those on the ground inspired my writing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: “Working with Fripp in the studio, we just handed him the chord charts the day before and said: ‘We want you to come in and improvise and that’s what we’ll use’. It was spontaneous.”\n\nMeanwhile, Willcox was tapped up to star in Proud’s Cabaret All Stars for a limited run last November and December at London’s Proud Embankment.\n\n“With performances embodying the spirit of the swinging sixties & sexy seventies, we give you an experience of a lifetime,” a description of the London stage show read. “Enjoy world-class jazz musicians and on-stage bands, award-winning acrobats, fire breathers and burlesque beauties. Be prepared to be amazed. This is an unforgettable night out.”"
