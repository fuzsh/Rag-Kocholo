        "text": "Note: this is an archived copy of Paul Routenburg's excellent Killed By Hype site which was previously located at http://plaza.powersurfr.com/paul/punk.html and http://ca.geocities.com/kbd77@rogers.com/punk.html. It contains a lot of great information about punk records so I decided to keep it alive here after the demise of GeoCities.\n\nPunk Rock Ireland\n\nNote: Until I get my geography sorted out everything whether it's Ireland or Northern Ireland is included here until I decide what to do with it.\n\nBesides Stiff Little Fingers and the early Undertones, most Irish punk that I know about is on the Good Vibrations label. While most of it is good, it tends towards powerpop. The Outcasts were a pretty good band, the song \"Cops Are Coming\" (on the 2x7\" compilation and their LP) has particularly interesting lyrics. I happen to like the first U2 LP (though it isn't really punk) and don't mind some tracks from a couple of their other LPs. Some of their later releases include some of the most pompous and self-indulgent shit I've ever heard.\n\nBears Insane/Decisions 7\" (1978) On Me/Wot's Up Mate 7\" (1978) Insane LP [recorded 1977] (1986) Blades Hot For You/The Reunion 7\" (1980) Ghost Of A Chance +1 7\" (1981) The Bride Wore White/Animation 7\" (1981) Revelations (of Heartbreak)/Rules of Love 7\" (1982) Downmarket/You Never Ask 7\" (1983) Those Were The Days 2CD [= The Last Man In Europe LP, Raytown Revisited LP and 3 extra non-LP tracks] Live At The Television Club 23 Nov. 1984 Boomtown Rats Lookin' After Number 1 +2 EP (1977) Mary Of The 4th Form/Do The Rat 7\" (1978) Someone's Looking At You +1 7\" (1979) s/t LP (1977) A Tonic For The Troops LP (1978) Clive Culbertson Time To Kill/Busy Signal 7\" (1979) Defects Dance Till You Drop +2 EP (1981) Survival/Brutality 7\" (1982) Suspicious Minds +2 EP (1983) Defective Breakdown LP (1982) Duggie Briggs Band Punk Rockin' Granny/I'm A Flasher 7\" (1977) Doubt Contrast Disorder +3 EP (1980) Electro-Motive Force E.M.F.
