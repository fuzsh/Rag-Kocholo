        "text": "Love Will Tear us Apart by Joy Division. One of the greatest singles ever IMO. It charted in the UK in 1980 after Ian Curtis took his life. It can be found in a number of places. I'm not sure how many masterings there are of this track but IIRC the 4CD Heart and Soul box was remastered. There IS a very rare and way OOP Steve Hoffman mastering of this on some obscure comp. I'm too lazy to look it up at the moment. If anyone has the SH Love Will Tear Us Apart can you tell us how it compares to the mastering on the Heart and Soul box?\n\nChris\n\nI'm partial to the Rhino series \"Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the '80s\" in terms of track selection. There are a number of big U.S. hits sprinkled throughout the collection (which I believe is 15 volumes plus a few other \"theme\" volumes for women, dance, Halloween, and Christmas) but the majority of stuff on these discs were too \"new wave\" to make much of a dent on the charts here. If you listened to a radio station in the era that played new wave music (or went out to clubs where this music was played) you will likely recognize the majority of the tracks, however, even though they weren't big \"hits.\" The mastering isn't the best (what with the typical Rhino EQ choices) but it isn't bad, either (ie not maximized/compressed). I like this series a lot more than the other U.S. new wave series of which I am aware (EMI's \"Living In Oblivion\", Priority's \"Rock Of The '80s\", the Right Stuff's \"Sedated in the '80s\", and Oglio's \"Flashback Favorites\").\n\nRhino also put out an '80s box set (\"Ohmigod!...\") but I don't like the track selection as much as it contains more U.S. mainstream pop/rock and fewer rarities.\n\nBefore Rhino launched their \"Just Can't Get Enough...\" series, they issued 2 discs in (what they were calling at the time) their \"DIY\" series. \"Teenage Kicks - UK Pop I (1976-79)\" contains 19 tracks running the gamut from Nick Lowe, Squeeze and XTC, to hard -to-find songs by Tom Robinson Band \"2-4-6-8 Motorway\" Skids, Kursaal Flyers, The Rezillos and more. The second volume, \"Starry Eyes - UK Pop II (1978-79)\" features 19 more by The Radiators, The Undertones, Buzzcocks, The Records and even The Searchers(!) with their classic, \"Hearts In Her Eyes\"! Bill Inglot did the sound, and if you can find these, they are a great place to start, IMO.\n\nGary\n\nActually that DIY series had many more volumes -- 9 in all, if I recall correctly, with other discs devoted to other areas (including Boston, LA, and NYC)."
