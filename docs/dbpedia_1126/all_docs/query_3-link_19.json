        "text": "This week on Teenage Kicks, we chat with Joe Jackson, who's just released \"Fool,\" his first new album in more than three years, and he shares his thoughts on songwriting today. Joe Jackson has worked through the new wave to jumpin' jive, classic pop to classical, with a career spanning more than 40 years. We'll play Jackson's new music and look back at the early days. It's an interview and music from Joe Jackson, this week on Teenage Kicks.\n\nThis is Jim McGuinn, and this week I re-address a wrong. Since falling in love with punk rock as a teen, I considered bands like Wham! to be the anti-punks, the opposite of the raw emotion that I heard in those loud fast rules of the day. Only in retrospect can I look back and realize I was wrong; soulfulness takes so many shapes and forms, and that few in the '80s could match the voice and playful cleverness of George Michael. With his Wham! musical partner Andrew Ridgeley celebrating a birthday Saturday, we'll feature Wham! this week, on Teenage Kicks.\n\nThis week on Teenage Kicks, we highlight Robert PalmerÃ¢â¬â¹, born this week back in 1949. Known as a song stylist of great musical taste along the lines of Joe CockerÃ¢â¬â¹, Rod StewartÃ¢â¬â¹, or Bryan FerryÃ¢â¬â¹, Palmer went from working with members of Little FeatÃ¢â¬â¹ and The MetersÃ¢â¬â¹ to making some new wave albums in the early '80s, fronting the Power StationÃ¢â¬â¹ with members of Duran DuranÃ¢â¬â¹ and Chic, and having massive hits in the '80s with his very ubiquitous and very dated music videos. Sadly, Palmer died suddenly of a heart attack in Paris in 2003 at the age of 54, but from \"Sneakin Sally\" to \"Simply Irresistible,\" we'll feature him this week on Teenage Kicks.\n\nIt's hard to believe, but we're approaching both the birthday and the anniversary of the passing of David Bowie three years ago next week, and his music is still as powerful, mysterious, and exciting as ever. This week on Teenage Kicks, we'll dive into his first two rock albums - 1970's The Man Who Sold the World, and his 1969 record known as either Man of Words/Man of Music, Space Oddity, or simply David Bowie, depending on where and when you bought your copy of it. This is pre-Ziggy Bowie — when he was considered a bit of a novelty one hit wonder with that Major Tom song — and before he re-wrote rock's rulebook.\n\nDecember 30 is Patti Smith's birthday. At this point, it's kinda like an extra holiday - and definitely one worth celebrating - we'll do so again on Teenage Kicks. From punk poet to acclaimed author, Patti Smith has had a 40-plus-year career in art and music, and maintains her love of rock and roll - she's still a fan, and we're fans of hers - and we'll feature Patti Smith this week on Teenage Kicks.\n\nThe '80s were a great era for holiday music. You got your Wham, The Waitresses, Pretenders, U2, Payolas, Tom Petty, Bowie and Bing, Band Aid, Run DMC, XTC, Annie Lennox, the Ramones - it was a golden era for new standards to be created, and old standards to be wrestled with, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no song captured the mix of bad decisions, regret, sadness, hope, and love quite like Fairytale of New York, a duet between The Pogues Shane McGowan and Kirsty Maccoll. We'll play ALL those Kicks-era holiday jams and a whole bunch more on this week's Teenage Kicks.\n\nThis week on Teenage Kicks we pay tribute to Pete Shelley of the Buzzcocks, who died of a heart attack last week at the age of 63. A massively influential band, Buzzcocks made their debut opening for the Sex Pistols in the summer of 1976, and went on to make melodic punk rock that lyrically examined modern life - making their politics personal and profound. When Buzzcocks broke up in 1981, Shelley moved towards synth-rock, and had a club hit with Homosapien, which was banned by the BBC for sexual references. Buzzcocks reunited in 1989 and continued to tour and record in the years since, while their sound paved the way for everyone from the Descendents to Green Day to exist, and their best known song Every Fallen in Love has been covered by artists from metal to country, rockabilly to goth. We'll honor and celebrate the music of Pete Shelley this week on Teenage Kicks"
