        "text": "-The Irish band, The Undertones, came along in the late ’70s to perform an interesting brand of music. With Feargal Sharkey in the band, and Billy Doherty as drummer, The Undertones began their trek signed to the then important label, Sire Records. They released two excellent albums with Sire before moving into experimental styles with other labels. But their marks were made with The Undertones (1979), and Hypnotized (1980), Feargal sharkey left and the band would give up the ghost in 1983.\n\nOn October 27, BMG will reissue the band’s 2020 LP-only ‘best of’ collection, West Bank Songs 1978-1983: A Best Of. This collection contains songs from the LP sets that were released in vinyl color variations. This new reissue will include 42 tracks spanning their brief six-year period during one of Rock’s grand moments.\n\nWest Bank Songs 1978-1983 (A Best Of) will be released on 2CD and DD.\n\nWest Bank Songs: 1978-1983 (A Best Of) – The Undertones"
