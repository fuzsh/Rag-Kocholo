        "text": "'Maria'\n\nMaria - Blondie\n\nAfter 17 years away, Blondie returned with a new album with 1999's No Exit.\n\nIts lead single saw them return to number one in the UK, their sixth in total.\n\n'Hanging on the Telephone'\n\nBlondie - Hanging On The Telephone\n\nThis track was first performed by writer Jack Lee's short-lived band The Nerves.\n\nBlondie released a cover version as the second track off their huge album Parallel Lines in 1978, and it gave them a top five hit in the UK.\n\n'Call Me'\n\nBlondie - Call me\n\nThis song was recorded as the main theme for the 1980 movie American Gigolo. It was written by Debbie Harry alongside electronic producer legend Giorgio Moroder.\n\nThe lyrics were written from the perspective of the main character in the film, a male prostitute. Harry said the lyrics were inspired by her impressions from watching the film, and that \"When I was writing it, I pictured the opening scene, driving on the coast of California.\"\n\n'Rapture'\n\nBlondie - Rapture\n\nThis track featured elements of disco, electronica and early forms of hip-hop.\n\nWhile it was not the first single featuring rapping to be commercially successful, it was the first to top the US chart.\n\n'Denis'\n\nBlondie - Denis\n\nOriginally titled 'Denise', this song was written by Neil Levenson about his childhood friend, Denise Lefrak. In 1963, it was a hit in the US for doo-wop group Randy & the Rainbows.\n\nIn 1978, Blondie reworked it as 'Denis', and it became one of their breakthrough tracks. It featured a verse with improvised lyrics in French by Debbie Harry.\n\n'Sunday Girl'\n\nBlondie - Sunday Girl - HD\n\nThis poppy new wave track reached number one in the UK in 1979.\n\nWritten by Chris Stein, the band also released a French-language version at the time.\n\n'The Tide is High'\n\nBlondie - The Tide Is High\n\nThis was originally a 1996 track written by John Holt, performed by the Jamaican group The Paragons, with Holt as lead singer.\n\nBlondie covered the song in 1980 with a reggae feel, and it topped both the UK and US charts. Atomic Kitten later reached number one in the UK with a cover of their own.\n\n'One Way or Another'\n\nBlondie - \"One Way Or Another\" (Audio)\n\nWritten by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison, this rock classic was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their breakup.\n\nOne Direction later scored a number one with a cover in 2013, as a mash-up with 'Teenage Kicks' by The Undertones.\n\n'Atomic'\n\nBlondie - Atomic\n\nA song of few words, but a number one hit for Blondie in 1980. Debbie Harry once said of the song’s lyrics: “A lot of the time I would write while the band were just playing the song and trying to figure it out. I would just be scatting along with them and I would just start going, ‘Ooooooh, your hair is beautiful’.”\n\nThe word ‘atomic’ in the song apparently carries no fixed meaning and functions more as a signifier of power and futurism. 1970s model Gia Carangi appears briefly in the post-apocalyptic music video.\n\n'Heart of Glass'\n\nBlondie - Heart Of Glass\n\nThis song saw Blondie truly hit the mainstream, reaching number one in the UK in 1979.\n\nTaking on a disco vibe, this song was written as a slower track titled 'Once I Had a Love' a few years earlier. Harry later said it \"was one of the first songs Blondie wrote, but it was years before we recorded it properly. We'd tried it as a ballad, as reggae, but it never quite worked\", and that \"the lyrics weren't about anyone. They were just a plaintive moan about lost love.\""
