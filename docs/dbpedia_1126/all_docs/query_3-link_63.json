        "text": "Catching up on forty years. 1978: Teenage kicks – The Undertones\n\nThe music of the Undertones is bang on message – full of that teenage insecurity. Just over two minutes of perfect imperfection, with the perfect lyric “Teenage dreams, so hard to beat” which is, of course, engraved on John Peel’s gravestone and briefly on a Belfast flyover.\n\nCatching up on forty years. 1977: Go Your Own Way – Fleetwood Mac\n\nMy fave track of Rumours is Go Your Own Way, not so much for the lyrics but for one of the best bits of drum thumping you’ll ever hear. Remember, a pre-teen boy won’t give a hoot about all this lovey-dovey stuff but some decent drumming and air guitar and the song is his.\n\nCatching up on forty years. 1976: Bohemian Rhapsody – Queen\n\nWe jacked up the volume. I felt so grown-up. We’d got to my favourite bit\n\n“I see a little silhouetto of a man,\n\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango”\n\nCatching up on forty years. 1975: Space Oddity – David Bowie\n\nI paid attention to this slightly weird man on our black and white television who sang of Major Tom, and being stranded and floating away and space flight. Imagine if I’d seen him in colour.\n\nCatching up on forty years. 1974: Remember You’re a Womble – The Wombles\n\nI confess this was the first single that I ever bought and therefore, I guess, has to be very important…From a time when there was that iconic slot in the TV schedule that adults and children converged on, just before the news and after all the other kid’s stuff.\n\nCatching up on forty years. 1973: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road – Elton John\n\nWe start with 1973. As a 9 year old my music is picked up mainly from Radio One…"
