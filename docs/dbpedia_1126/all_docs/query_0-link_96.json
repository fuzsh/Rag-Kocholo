        "text": "The lyrics \"Teenage dreams, so hard to beat\" taken from The Undertones debut single were spray painted under a motorway flyover after the Radio 1 DJ's death nine years ago.\n\nThe non sectarian mural has now been re-painted as part of a £300,000 public realm improvement scheme prompting a storm of protest on social media websites with some people questioning why other murals depicting gunmen have not also been taken down.\n\nUndertones bass player Michael Bradley was among those who took to Twitter to vent their frustration.\n\nHe said: \"So the John Peel graffiti removed in Belfast. Undertones now going to paint over the DRD building. Call the Outcasts!\"\n\nThe cult classic Teenage Kicks became a hit in 1978 after John Peel played it twice in a row on his popular show. He later described the song as his favourite and requested the lyrics be inscribed onto his headstone.\n\nTerri Hooley the man behind the recording of Teenage Kicks and whose story was the subject of the successful film, Good Vibrations, said he was bewildered by the decision.\n\n\"I am surprised, shocked and very sad about it,\" he said. \"It just seems to have been an easy target - all the murals for paramilitaries and violence have been left up, I don't understand why they took this one down. It was there for nine years and no one graffitied over it - that is unusual in Belfast.\n\n\"A lot of people considered Teenage Kicks to be the national anthem of Northern Ireland.\"\n\nThe mural was painted under the M3 flyover at Bridge End in east Belfast close to a sectarian interface where rival gangs of Catholics and Protestants youths have clashed in recent times.\n\nHuman rights campaigner Patrick Corrigan described the removal as \"cultural vandalism\" on Twitter.\n\n\"They've killed £teenagedreams,\" he said.\n\nAn east Belfast Protestant who called himself @RudyardKipling7 also posted: \"Of all the murals in Belfast the £DSD choose to remove the Teenage Dreams one? Buffoons.\"\n\nThe Department of Social Development (DSD) which was responsible for removing the graffiti said it would consider funding a new mural painted by children from the local area.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \"We do not remove graffiti as a standalone issue however we will always remove graffiti, after consultation, as part of any scheme if it falls within a scheme area.\n\n\"Community representatives from the area have made initial contact with the department to develop a proposal to bring together teenagers from the Short Strand and Newtownards Road area to design alternative community art work in this location.\n\n\"The department has funded similar schemes in other locations and does not foresee any issue with an agreed new community mural, subject to consultation with DRD Roads Service who own the wall.\"\n\nEast Belfast MLA Chris Lyttle from the cross community Alliance Party said people were frustrated by the situation.\n\n\"There is a certainly a question being asked as to why this popular, non-divisive mural was painted over and more contentious ones have been left as they are.\n\n\"I have contacted DSD with a view to getting what had become an iconic image for the residents of east Belfast restored as soon as possible and I hope that will be the case,\" he said.\n\nLater, the department added: \"DSD consulted with The East Belfast Partnership and the Ballymac Friendship Trust. A new mural was not proposed during consultation with the community however, the department is always willing to consider community proposals.\""
