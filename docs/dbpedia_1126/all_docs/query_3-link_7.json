        "text": "Post by Ulterior Motives on\n\nHello, everyone. I thought this might be a fun topic for a rankdown. I realized that the Alternative rankdowns ended at 1980, but it got me curious and I began looking into songs from before 1980 that could fit into the \"Alternative\" category. This is the list I came up with, but I didn't feel like just 100 songs would cut it, so I added five songs as \"bonus\" tracks. These will be optional for participants, and their positions will be tied with the closest song from the proper 100 to their average, so I would suggest tying them with another song instead of treating them as just a regular track on the list.\n\nThis isn't a \"traditional\" list, in that it isnt based on radio play. However, it is a list of songs from the year 1979 and songs from late 1978 that would have likely peaked in 1979 (such as \"Teenage Kicks\" or \"Homicide\"). I still ordered them so it still looks like a proper \"chart\" rankdown, albeit slightly arbitrarily, but to look similarly to what a chart year end list would probably look like. It is mostly well known artists, but there are a few exceptions. I also added artists that likely could have crossed over, a few might be a little controversial. All in all, I hope people enjoy this list. Format the list however you like, but please do not just copy the list and send it to me, or just switch a few songs around. The songs at top might be the most favored, but still. The due date is June 24, 2023. I actually created this list awhile back, but have changed a few things since. I also have lists for 1977 and 1978 pre-made, with these lists having way more obscure artists. Make sure to number your lists too, and while you should write them similarly to how I wrote them, I won't get mad at capitalization differences or whether you put \"The\" in front of the band names (i.e \"The Ramones\" and \"Ramones\" are both fine)\n\nAnyway, without further ado, here is the Alternative songs of 1979.\n\nThe due date is currently December 11th of 2023.\n\nHere we go\n\n1.

I want to make sure I don't make the same mistakes here, so I plan to tell everyone when I am not revealing, and reveal ten songs each day I reveal.\n\nI might allow some extensions, but I'm not planning to go to crazy with it like I did for the 1966 list. I'm not sure if I'll continue with the 60s Billboard Pop Year End lists, but that is a possibility. I doubt I'm gonna go earlier than 1962, though, since most songs from the 58-61 lists aren't likely to be very appealing to most users here. I'm sure we will also get to 70s Year End lists for the Hot 100 soon, but I doubt I'll be the one to do them, or I'd get help for them since they will be highly popular. I do plan to do Alternative lists for both 1977 and 1978, but not any for prior to 1977 due to the genre barely existing before that (some 1976 songs will fall into the 77 YE list too).\n\nI hope people will enjoy this rankdown, I might get a co-host for this to help me, since I do expect more turnout on this than the 1966 Year End (And once again, thank you to the 17 participants for that rankdown, and thanks for your patience. I am new to making Rankdowns, so it sometimes was very time consuming, especially when also working and having some mild depression/ procrastination issues. So thank all of you :)\n\nAnd once again, enjoy this list!"
