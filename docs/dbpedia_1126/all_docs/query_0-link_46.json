Bob Seger “Old Time Rock n Roll” (from A Stranger In Town)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W1LsRShUPtY\n\nSo a lot of folks consider this an all time classic: after all it was written by the legendary George Jackson, it uses the Muscle Shoals rhythm section, it’s featured in one of the most iconic movie scenes ever, and it’s reportedly Seger’s favorite song.\n\nBut despite all that I find it kind of boring. I don’t hate it (I don’t hate any song on this list, obviously). It’s fine, it’s a good rock song, the piano playing is excellent…but it doesn’t really do anything or go anywhere.\n\nInstant skip for me. I like lots of Seger songs but this is not one of them. I get it being on the list though. It's still played (far too often)\n\n99.

Barry Manilow “Copacabana” (from Even Now)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/toV8Lb9h0Vs\n\nDid I mention that this list was going to have some very cheesy songs on it? This one might be top of that class. The melody is an earwig; once heard it can’t be unheard. And yet it’s a great melody. And the story is so dramatic: At the Copa…don’t fall in love!\n\n1. Kudos to any of you who watches the entire video I linked. It’s a special kind of horrifying.\n\n2. Special shout-out to the punk rock band The Vandals, who a few years later performed one of the most utterly tasteless, yet totally hilarious parodies of all time, “Dachau Cabana”:\n\nHis name was Helmut, he wore a Brown Shirt, but that was 40 years ago, when the Nazis ran the show!"
