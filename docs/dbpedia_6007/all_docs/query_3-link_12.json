        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nAzerbaijan -- a secular nation with a majority-Turkic and majority-Shia Muslim population -- was briefly independent (from 1918 to 1920) following the collapse of the Russian Empire; it was subsequently incorporated into the Soviet Union for seven decades.\n\nBeginning in 1988, Azerbaijan and Armenia fought over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was populated largely by ethnic Armenians but incorporated into Soviet Azerbaijan as an autonomous oblast in the early 1920s. In the late Soviet period, an ethnic-Armenian separatist movement sought to end Azerbaijani control over the region. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh escalated after Armenia and Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the time a ceasefire took effect in 1994, separatists with Armenian support controlled NagornoâKarabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani territories. After decades of cease-fire violations and sporadic flare-ups, a second sustained conflict began in 2020 when Azerbaijan tried to win back the territories it had lost in the 1990s. After significant Azerbaijani gains, Armenia returned the southern part of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories to Azerbaijan. In September 2023, Azerbaijan took military action to regain the rest of Nagorno-Karabakh; after a conflict that lasted only one day, nearly the entire ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh fled to Armenia.\n\nSince gaining its independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has significantly reduced the poverty rate and has directed some revenue from its oil and gas production to develop the countryâs infrastructure. However, corruption remains a burden on the economy, and Western observers and members of the countryâs political opposition have accused the government of authoritarianism. The countryâs leadership has remained in the ALIYEV family since Heydar ALIYEV, the most highly ranked Azerbaijani member of the Communist Party during the Soviet period, became president during the first Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1993.Â\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 10,650,239\n\nmale: 5,330,233\n\nfemale: 5,320,006 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 90; male 90; total 88\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Azerbaijani(s)\n\nadjective: Azerbaijani\n\nEthnic groups\n\nAzerbaijani 91.6%, Lezghin 2%, Russian 1.3%, Armenian 1.3%, Talysh 1.3%, other 2.4% (2009 est.)\n\nnote: Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of Azerbaijan on the basis of the borders recognized when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, was populated almost entirely by ethnic Armenians; Azerbaijan has over 80 ethnic groups\n\nLanguages\n\nAzerbaijani (Azeri) (official) 92.5%, Russian 1.4%, Armenian 1.4%, other 4.7% (2009 est.)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nDÃ¼nya fakt kitabÄ±, Ésas mÉlumatlar Ã¼Ã§Ã¼n ÉvÉz olunmaz mÉnbÉdir (Azerbaijani)\n\nThe World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.\n\nnote: Russian is widely spoken\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim 97.3% (predominantly Shia), Christian 2.6%, other <0.1, unaffiliated <0.1 (2020 est.)\n\nnote: religious affiliation forÂ the majority ofÂ Azerbaijanis is largely nominal, percentages for actual practicing adherents are probablyÂ much lower\n\nDemographic profile\n\nAzerbaijanâs citizenry has over 80 ethnic groups. The far eastern part of the country has the highest population density, particularly in and around Baku. Apart from smaller urbanized areas, the rest of the country has a fairly light and evenly distributed population. Approximately 57% of the countryâs inhabitants lives in urban areas.Â While the population is continuing to grow, it is in the early stages of aging. The declining fertility rate â which has decreased from about 5.5 children per woman in the 1950s to less than the 2.1 replacement level in 2022 â combined with increasing life expectancy has resulted in the elderly making up a larger share of Azerbaijanâs populace. The percentage of elderly residents and the slowed growth and eventual shrinkage of the working-age population could put pressure on the countryâs pension and healthcare systems.Â\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 22.3% (male 1,269,241/female 1,104,529)\n\n15-64 years: 68.7% (male 3,659,441/female 3,656,493)\n\n65 years and over: 9% (2024 est.)

mobile usage rates reached 100% as far back as 2011, but have largely stagnated since then; the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are slowly extending the reach of their long-term evolution (LTE) networks around the country, and this increased coverage (along with access to faster data-based services) is expected to produce a moderate resurgence for both mobile and mobile broadband over the next few years as customers migrate from 3G to 4G. 5G services are still some ways off, as the demand for high-speed data and fast broadband can easily be met by existing capacity on LTE networks; fixed-line tele density continues to drop down each year as customers consolidate their telecommunications services around the mobile platform; yet the rate of decline is comparatively slow to other countries, since Azerbaijan has a relatively high proportion of (87%) of fixed-line broadband customers still on DSL; Fiber (12% of fixed broadband connections) is gradually being rolled out in urban areas, and this makes up the bulk of the (limited) growth being seen in the overall fixed broadband market; DSLâs predominance, however, will serve to keep Azerbaijanâs average access speeds in the sub-10Mbps range for the foreseeable future\n\n(2024)\n\ndomestic: 16 fixed-lines subscriptions per 100 persons;
