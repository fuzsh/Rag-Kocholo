        "text": "Economy of Armenia\n\nArmenia is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics. It is a landlocked country between the Black and the Caspian Seas, bordered on the north by Georgia, to the east by Azerbaijan, on the south by Iran, and to the west by Turkey. Up until independence (1991), Armenia's economy was based largely on industry--chemicals, electronic products, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber, and textiles--and highly dependent on outside resources. Agriculture accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union. In recent years, the construction sector has taken off, fueled by an ambitious government-backed construction project in the capital, and remittances to relatives by ethnic Armenians living in Russia and the United States.\n\nLike other New Independent States of the former Soviet Union, Armenia's economy still suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former Soviet trading networks. While investment from these states in support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, and few major enterprises are still able to function, Russian entities have nevertheless increased their exposure in the mining, energy, telecommunications, and transportation sectors. In addition, the effects of the 1988 earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt, though international donors and diaspora Armenian groups continue to fund reconstruction efforts in the earthquake zone.\n\nAlthough a cease-fire has held since 1994, the 2-decade-old conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved, in spite of intensive efforts by the OSCE Minsk Group to reach a settlement. The consequent closure of both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders resulting from the war has prevented Armenia from realizing its economic potential, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed, though air connections to Turkey exist; land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. In 1992-93, GDP fell nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nThe structure of Armenia's economy has changed substantially since 1991, with sectors such as construction and services replacing agriculture and industry as the main contributors to the economic growth. The diamond processing industry, which was one of the leading export sectors in 2000-2004 and also a major recipient of foreign investment, faced a dramatic decrease in output since 2005 due to raw material supply problems with Russia and overall decline in international diamond markets. Other industrial sectors driving industrial growth include energy, metallurgy, and food processing.\n\nDespite the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the Government of Armenia has been able to carry out wide-ranging economic reforms that have paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. Armenia registered strong economic growth beginning in 1995, with double-digit GDP growth rates every year from 2002 to 2007.\n\nAfter rapid expansion in 2001-2007, with average 13% annual GDP growth, economic and financial conditions worsened rapidly in Armenia in 2008, due to a drop in international metals prices and a downturn in the Russian economy following the collapse of oil prices in late 2008. The end of a remittance-fueled construction boom that had driven growth in recent years resulted in a 14.4% drop in real GDP for 2009 (compared to 6.8% GDP growth in 2008), with about 80% of this decline due to a plunge in the construction sector. The economy recorded positive growth rates in the first months of 2010.\n\nArmenia maintains a floating exchange rate regime with no explicit exchange rate target. The nominal exchange rate of the Armenian dram with major currencies was fairly stable between 1998 and 2003. During 2003-2007, the Armenian dram appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar by around 45%, mainly due to significant growth in remittances, growth of exports in absolute terms, the de-dollarization of the economy, and weakening of the dollar in international markets. The appreciation of the dram negatively affected the traditional export industries, including information technology, diamond cutting, the wine industry, and textiles. Exporters responded to the increased costs by either reducing their production capacity or by reducing their number of employees in order to stay afloat. The exchange rate was mainly stable at around 300 drams per dollar during 2008 and until March 2009, when the Central Bank stopped its heavy intervention in the foreign exchange market and the dram devalued by around 25%. The exchange rate remained broadly stable during 2009, with only a few interventions from the Central Bank to prevent sharp depreciation.\n\nArmenia is highly dependent on import of energy fuel, mainly from Russia. The Armenia Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) at Metsamor provides around 40% of electricity generation for the country, and hydro and thermal plants provide roughly 30% each. Armenia imports most of its natural gas from Russia, which provided significant discounts to Armenia until 2009. The Russian import gas price rose from $110 to $154 per thousand cubic meters in April 2009, and increased further to $180 in April 2010. However, the current price is still below the international average of over $300, and in the coming years the price is expected to converge with market prices.\n\nIn May 2009 Armenia began receiving gas from Iran through a recently constructed pipeline, which is meant to diversify Armenia's gas supply. Much of the Iranian gas is expected to be used for power generation.\n\nArmenia imports nearly all of its refined petroleum products through Georgia. The recent conflict between Russia and Georgia resulted in periodic disruptions of fuel and food imports, and highlighted Armenia's vulnerability to this single transit corridor.\n\nArmenia has received significant support from international institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors. In 2009 Armenia received more than $1.5 billion in donor financing for budget support and various government-led anti-crisis programs.\n\nContinued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and making strides against corruption. A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization. Armenia joined the World Trade Organization on February 5, 2003.\n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\nArmenia is trying to address its environmental problems. It has established a Ministry of Nature Protection and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal, with the resulting revenues used for environmental protection activities. Deforestation by mining concerns in certain parts of the country have resulted in periodic protests by environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and stirred controversy over government policies to support investment in the mining sector. Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS--a group of 11 former Soviet republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues. Armenia is under strong pressure from the international community to close its aging nuclear power plant (ANPP) at Metsamor by 2016. Given that Armenia depends on the ANPP for over 40% of its electricity, the Armenian Government sees no alternative to construction of a new nuclear plant. A U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded initial planning study was completed in September 2008, and concluded that a new nuclear plant is the least-cost option to replace the existing facility. The Armenian Government is continuing with the planning process for a new plant.\n\nEconomy (2009)\n\nGDP: $8.71 billion.\n\nGDP growth rate (CIA World Factbook, 2009): -14.4%.\n\nPer capita GDP PPP (World Economic Outlook, 2009 est.): $4,915.\n\nInflation (CIA World Factbook, 2009): 3.4%.\n\nNatural resources: Copper, molybdenum, zinc, gold, silver, lead, marble, granite, mineral spring water.\n\nAgriculture: Products--fruits and vegetables, wines, dairy, some livestock.\n\nIndustry: Types--diamond-processing, metal-cutting machine tools, forging-pressing machines, electric motors, tires, knitted wear, hosiery, shoes, silk fabric, chemicals, trucks, instruments, microelectronics, jewelry manufacturing, software development, food processing, brandy.\n\nTrade: Exports--$698 million: pig iron, unwrought copper, nonferrous metals, diamonds, mineral products, foodstuffs, energy. Export partners (2009)--Germany 16.5%, Russia 15.4%, U.S. 9.6%, Bulgaria 8.6%, Georgia 7.6%, Netherlands 7.5%. Imports (2009)--$3.3 billion: natural gas, petroleum, tobacco products, foodstuffs, diamonds. Import partners (2009)--Russia 16%, U.A.E. 8.8%, Ukraine 5.6%, Turkey 4.8%, Georgia 4.6%, Iran 4.4%.\n\nGovernment of Armenia\n\nArmenians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a September 1991 referendum, followed by a presidential election in October 1991 that gave 83% of the vote to Levon Ter-Petrossian. Ter-Petrossian had been elected head of government in 1990, when the Armenian National Movement defeated the Communist Party. Ter-Petrossian was re-elected in 1996 in a disputed election. Following public demonstrations against Ter-Petrossian's policies on the predominantly ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh that is located within Azerbaijan, the President resigned under pressure in January 1998 and was replaced by Prime Minister Robert Kocharian, who was subsequently elected President in March 1998. Following the October 27, 1999 assassination in Parliament of Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsian, Parliament Speaker Karen Demirchian, and six other officials, a period of political instability ensued during which an opposition headed by elements of the former Armenian National Movement government attempted unsuccessfully to force Kocharian to resign. Riding out the unrest, Kocharian was later reelected in March 2003 in a contentious election that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the U.S. Government deemed to have fallen short of international standards.\n\nThe Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style parliamentary democracy as the basis of its form of government. However, international observers have been critical of the conduct of national elections in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2008, as well as the constitutional referendum of 2005. The new constitution in 2005 increased the power of the legislative branch and allows for more independence of the judiciary; in practice, however, both branches remain subject to political pressure from the executive branch, which retains considerably greater power than its counterparts in most European countries.\n\nThe unicameral National Assembly has 90 seats that are elected by proportional representation (party list) and 41 that are single mandate districts. Armenia held its most recent parliament elections in 2007, when the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) won 33% of the votes cast, followed by Prosperous Armenia (15%), the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) Dashnaktsutyun (13%), Rule of Law (7%), and the Heritage Party (6%). This election also was marred by irregularities. The RPA and Prosperous Armenia joined to form a governing coalition which secured an absolute majority of parliament seats. The ARF negotiated a cooperation agreement with the governing coalition in exchange for ministerial positions, but declined to join the coalition formally, instead reserving the right to support its own candidate for the February 19, 2008 presidential election.\n\nThe Republican Party of Armenia, Prosperous Armenia, the Rule of Law, and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) Dashnaktsutyun signed a new coalition agreement on March 21, 2008. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation resigned from the coalition in April 2009, citing differences over the conduct of foreign policy.\n\nThe 2008 presidential election, while originally deemed by the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) to be “mostly in line” with OSCE standards, was later seen to be marred by credible claims of ballot stuffing, intimidation (including beatings) of poll workers and proxies, vote buying, and other irregularities. Recounts were requested, but ODIHR observers noted “shortcomings in the recount process, including discrepancies and mistakes, some of which raise questions over the impartiality of the [electoral commissions] concerned.”\n\nMass protests followed the disputed vote. For 10 days, large crowds of pro-opposition demonstrators gathered in Yerevan’s downtown Freedom Square. Police and security forces entered Freedom Square early in the morning on March 1, 2008, ostensibly to investigate reports of hidden weapons caches. This operation turned into a forced dispersal of demonstrators from Freedom Square by massed riot police. Following the clearing of Freedom Square, clashes erupted in the afternoon between massed demonstrators and security personnel, and continued throughout the day and evening, leading to 10 deaths and hundreds of injuries. President Kocharian decreed a 20-day state of emergency in Yerevan late on March 1, which sharply curtailed freedom of media and assembly. Dozens of opposition supporters were jailed in the wake of the violence, in proceedings that many international watchdog groups criticized as politically motivated. Armenia's media freedom climate and freedom of assembly remained poor overall, though somewhat improved after the state of emergency was lifted. Serzh Sargsian took office as President in April 2008.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nPresident--Serzh Sargsian\n\nPrime Minister--Tigran Sargsian\n\nForeign Minister--Edward Nalbandian\n\nDefense Minister--Seyran Ohanian\n\nAmbassador to the U.S.--Tatoul Markarian\n\nAmbassador to the UN--Garen Nazarian\n\nArmenia's embassy in the U.S. is at 2225 R Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20008; tel: 202-319-1976 or 202-319-2983; fax: 202-319-2984.\n\nType: Republic.\n\nConstitution: Approved in November 2005 referendum.\n\nIndependence: 1918 (First Armenian Republic); 1991 (from Soviet Union).\n\nBranches: Executive--president (head of state) with wider powers relative to other branches, prime minister (head of cabinet), Council of Ministers (cabinet).
