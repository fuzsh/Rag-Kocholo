        "text": "Armenia covers an area of 29,743 sq. km (11,484 sq mi) in Eurasia's South Caucasus region. It is a landlocked country with no access to the world's oceans. Armenia is one of the most mountainous nations on Earth and has an average elevation of 5,900 feet (1,800 meters) above sea level. Armenia is surrounded by the nations of Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.\n\nThe Lesser (or Little) Caucasus Mountains dominate much of Armenia's landscape. As observed on the physical map of Armenia above, the topography of the country is very rugged and mountainous. Nearly the entire nation is covered by mountain ranges and deep valleys. The highest point is Mt. Aragats at 13,418 ft. (4,090m). A yellow triangle marks the highest point on the map.\n\nThe Araks and Debed Rivers are the two most important waterways in the nation. The Araks act as a natural border between Iran and Turkey to the south while also granting the nation a small sliver of floodplain that exists along its banks. This part of the nation is the most densely populated and is home to Armenia's capital city Yerevan. Rivers flow fast down through the mountains, at least 3% form the valleys of the Araks and Debed rivers."
