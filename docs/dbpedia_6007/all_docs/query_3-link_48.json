        "text": "The landlocked mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh was the subject of a long-standing territorial dispute between Azerbaijan, in which it lies, and its ethnic Armenian majority, backed by neighbouring Armenia.\n\nInternationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, until recently much of it was governed by the unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, also known as the Republic of Artsakh.\n\nFollowing decades of ceasefires punctuated by sporadic clashes and upsurges of violence, Azerbaijani forces overwhelmed the territory's defenders in a short campaign in September 2023.\n\nThe majority of ethnic Armenians fled and on 1 January 2024 Nagorno-Karabakh was formally dissolved.\n\nWhile Armenia itself never officially recognised the region's independence, it became its main financial and military backer and the territory functioned as a de facto part of Armenia.\n\nKey dates in the history of Nagorno-Karabakh:\n\nThe conflict has roots dating back well over a century into competition between Christian Armenian and Muslim Turkic and Persian influences.\n\n19th Century - Populated for centuries by Christian Armenian and Turkic Azeris, Karabakh becomes part of the Russian empire.\n\nearly 20th Century - Acts of brutality on both sides punctuate the region's relative peace, and live on in the popular memory.\n\n1920s - After the end of World War One and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, the new Soviet rulers, as part of their divide-and-rule policy in the region, established the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, with an ethnic Armenian majority, within the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\n1991 - With the break-up of the Soviet Union, Karabakh declares itself an independent republic, and as Soviet control loosens Armenian-Azeri frictions escalate into a full-scale war.\n\n1992-94 - First Karabakh war: During the fighting up to 30,000 people are estimated to have lost their lives. Armenians gain control of the region and push on to occupy Azerbaijani territory outside Karabakh, creating a buffer zone around Lachin, linking Karabakh and Armenia.\n\nMore than one million people flee their homes during the fighting. The ethnic Azeri population - about 25% of the total before the war - leaves Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia while ethnic Armenians flee the rest of Azerbaijan.\n\n1994 - Russian-brokered ceasefire is signed leaving Karabakh as well as swathes of Azeri territory around the territory in Armenian hands.\n\n1994-2020 - A simmering stalemate prevails punctuated by armed clashes.\n\n2017 - In a referendum, voters approve a new constitution turning the government from a semi-presidential to a fully presidential one. The territory changes its name from Nagorno Karabakh Republic to Republic of Artsakh, though both remain official names.\n\nKarabakh is the Russian rendering of an Azeri word meaning \"black garden\", while Nagorno is a Russian root meaning \"mountainous\". Artsakh is an ancient Armenian name for the area."
