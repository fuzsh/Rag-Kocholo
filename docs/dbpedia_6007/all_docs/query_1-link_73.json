        "text": "This chart shows the Population Density (per square kilometer) by country in 2015.\n\nPopulation density is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and particularly to humans.\n\nFor humans, population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile (which may include or exclude, for example, areas of water or glaciers). Commonly this may be calculated for a county, city, country, another territory, or the entire world.\n\nPopulation density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.Low densities may cause an extinction vortex and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the Allee effect after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes in low population densities include:\n\nIncreased problems with locating sexual mates\n\nIncreased inbreeding\n\nMonaco in South Europe, currently holds the record for being the most densely populated nation in the world.Mongolia is the least densely populated country in the world."
