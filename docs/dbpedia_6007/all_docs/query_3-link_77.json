Libya: Libya, officially known as the State of Libya, is a country located in North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad to the south, Niger to the southwest, Algeria to the west, and Tunisia to the northwest. The capital city of Libya is Tripoli, which serves as the country's political and economic center. Libya is known for its vast stretches of desert, including the Sahara Desert in the south, as well as its long Mediterranean coastline, which boasts scenic beaches and ancient ruins. Libya has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with ancient civilizations such as the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines leaving their mark on the country. The economy of Libya is heavily dependent on oil exports, which account for the majority of government revenue and GDP. However, ongoing conflict and insecurity have disrupted oil production and hindered economic development, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. Despite its challenges, Libya possesses significant potential due to its natural resources, strategic location, and educated population. Efforts to stabilize the country and establish a functioning government are ongoing, with support from the international community and regional actors.

The history of Africa is the story of the origins of human civilisation. Africa is the birthplace of humankind itself, yet little of its early and modern history is widely known. For too long, Africa's history has been dominated by Western narratives of slavery and colonialism, or simply ignored. Now, broadcaster and SOAS President Zeinab Badawi will set the record straight. This seminal book is the culmination of seven years of research by Zeinab, travelling through 30 African countries and interviewing countless historians, anthropologists, archaeologists and local storytellers. The result is a fascinating and epic history, told through the voices of the Africans themselves - from the origins of our species, through ancient civilisations and medieval empires with remarkable queens and kings, to the miseries of conquest and the elation of independence. An African History of Africa unearths buried histories from across the continent and weaves them into an accessible and essential book, giving Africa its rightful place in our global story.\n\nRudison-Imhotep, C. N. (2022). Hiring Nonviolent African American Male Ex-offenders: A Phenomenological Investigation on Employment Discrimination (Doctoral dissertation, Northcentral University). Chicago The first incarcerated Africans arrived in the Western Hemisphere in the 16th century (Grimes, 2017). They were forced into slave labor to facilitate European colonialists by working in deforestation, agriculture, domestic labor, industrial labor, and other types of employment. Wesely and Miller (2018) believed that one of the primary reasons the United States was able to experience such an elevated level of growth and expansion was the low cost of the workforce comprised of incarcerated Africans. After the Civil War, these groups were formally granted liberty and the autonomy to live their lives (Zhang, 2018). However, in the 21st century, African Americans continue to face discrimination because of the xenophobic nature of structural racism. This discrimination is not restricted to vocal abuse but is also seen in education, employment opportunities, and the sentences given for crimes committed by African Americans and other non-White ethnic groups (Jacobsen & Hardaway, 2016). Link and Oser (2018) have argued that one of the most important effects of racial discrimination in the United States is visible in the nation’s crime rates. National data show that the highest number of crimes are related to drug abuse, robbery, theft, homicide, and any other activities, with African Americans as significant contributors (Young & Powell, 2015). As Stewart (2017) stated, the primary reasons for the high rate of crimes committed by African Americans are discrimination, a lack of available opportunities, and the deprivation of rights granted by the U.S. Constitution. In many major cities, crime rates have weakened sharply and become constant at depleted quantities (Jonson & Cullen, 2015).\n\nDid you know? If you move to Ethiopia 🇪🇹 today, you will be at least seven (7) years younger as they're currently in the year 2016. 11.09.2024 is Ethiopia's 🇪🇹 new year for 2017 Here's one of the most mind blowing facts about the world. When we welcomed the year 2024 Ethiopia 🇪🇹 were four months into 2016. The most interesting differences are the holidays. Ethiopia 🇪🇹 celebrates the new year on September 11th and Christmas on January 7th. The Ethiopian 🇪🇹 calendar is different from the Georgian calendar. There are thirteen months in the Ethiopian calendar, which means they are currently in 2016. This makes the Ethiopian calendar 7 years behind the rest of the world. Not only is the country in a different year, they tell time differently as well. Ethiopians 🇪🇹 use a 12-hour clock, like many other countries. But with a variation that you can never come across anywhere else. “Orop time or Habbishat time?” That is the expression you should memorize, because you will use it several times a day. “Orop” or “Europe time” is how the Ethiopians refer to the clock system the rest of the world uses. “Habbishat” is the casual term for Ethiopians. Here is how it works. When you are in 🇪🇹 , at 6:00 in the morning (by your watch), an Ethiopian clock will say 12:00. Your 8:00 will be Ethiopian 2:00, and so on. And at 6:00 suppertime , an Ethiopian clock will revert to 12:00 again. Ethiopia 🇪🇹 is the only African country never to have been brought under colonial rule. The Italians tried but failed woefully and were defeated by the solid Ethiopian forces. 🇪🇹 is Africa's oldest country. Originally founded in 980 BC 🇪🇹 has the world's oldest Bible and according to some archaeological findings, 🇪🇹 is the cradle of humankind, meaning, life actually started in Ethiopia. Safe to say, life started in #africa, the garden of Eden was located in #ethiopia 🇪🇹 #GataamaGroup #Africa🌍\n\nTurkmenistan is a country in Central Asia, known for its significant natural gas reserves and unique cultural heritage. Here are some key points about Turkmenistan: 1. **Geography**: Turkmenistan is bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and northeast, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west. The country is mostly desert (the Karakum Desert), with oases and the Kopet Dag mountain range along the southern border. 2. **Capital and Major Cities**: The capital city is Ashgabat, which is known for its white marble buildings and grandiose national monuments. Other notable cities include Türkmenabat, Daşoguz, Mary, and Balkanabat. 3. **History**: Turkmenistan has a long history that includes ancient civilizations such as the Parthian Empire and later influences from the Persian Empire and the Mongol Empire. It became part of the Russian Empire in the late 19th century and was later incorporated into the Soviet Union. Turkmenistan declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. 4. **Economy**: The economy of Turkmenistan is heavily dependent on natural gas exports, which constitute the majority of its revenue. The country has the fourth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world. Other economic activities include cotton farming, oil production, and some manufacturing. 5. **Demographics**: Turkmenistan has a population of about 6 million people. The majority ethnic group is Turkmen, with smaller communities of Uzbeks, Russians, and Kazakhs. The official language is Turkmen, but Russian is also widely used, especially in government and business. 6. **Government**: Turkmenistan is a presidential republic with a highly centralized government.

His successor, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, continued many of Niyazov’s policies but has also made some reforms. The current president is Serdar Berdimuhamedow, who took office in March 2022. 7. **Culture**: Turkmen culture is characterized by its nomadic heritage, which influences its music, dance, and traditional crafts like carpet weaving. The country is also known for its traditional horse breeding, particularly the Akhal-Teke horse breed.

It has limited its involvement in international organizations and maintains a stance of non-alignment, although it has economic and energy-related partnerships with various countries, including Russia, China, and Iran. Turkmenistan is known for its stability and significant economic resources, yet it also faces challenges related to political freedoms and economic diversification.\n\nProud of being the fastest-developing country with a population of 37 million. 🏆🚀 #Uzbekistan #Progress We are the nation of al-Khwarizmi, who introduced the world to the concept of the 'algorithm' and is rightfully considered the father of modern mathematics and informatics. 🧮💡 We are the descendants of Jaloliddin, who chose death over captivity and remains a symbol of resistance to this day. ⚔️🛡️ We are the descendants of Temur, who was not only one of the most powerful conquerors of his time, creating a vast empire stretching from Central Asia to the Middle East and India, but also left behind a cultural legacy that continues to inspire to this day. 🏰👑 We are the great-grandchildren of the remarkable poet, great conqueror, and statesman who founded one of the greatest empires in history — Babur, whose legacy continues to influence the cultures of Central and South Asia. 📚📝 🇺🇿🚀 We are Uzbekistan — the fastest-developing country. #Uzbekistan #ProudToBeUzbek #Legacy #Olympics2024"
