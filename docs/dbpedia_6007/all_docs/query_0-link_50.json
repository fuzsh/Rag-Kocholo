It is usual practice among researchers to use <strong>of</strong> graph <strong>of</strong> PC2 versus PC1 in order to visualize clusters in multivariate data. Recently some researchers suggest that ICA or ICA after PCA is better than PCA itself in this task. But no extensive comparison between these three techniques is available in literature. This article attempts to compare these on the basis <strong>of</strong> four sets <strong>of</strong> simulated data as well as three sets <strong>of</strong> real data. It is found that ICA after PCA is the best all the times, PCA alone fails in almost all the cases while ICA alone performs next to ICA after PCA. Theoretical justification behind this findings is also presented. So we recommend using <strong>of</strong> ICA after PCA to visualize clusters in multivariate data set. Keywords: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Kurtosis, Sub-gaussian. 1 Introduction Although Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2002) is one <strong>of</strong> the oldest techniques in multivariate analysis, still the application <strong>of</strong> PCA is the mainstay <strong>of</strong> modern data analysis. PCA constructs a set uncorrelated variable, called principal components from a set <strong>of</strong> correlated variable by using an orthogonal transformation. The principal components (PCs) are formed in such a way that first principal component has the maximum variance and last principal component has the smallest variance i.e., the principal component are ordered. It is difficult to represent the data in high dimension (n > 3), where the graphical representation is not available, PCA is powerful tool to visualize structure in multivariate data (Yeung, 2001; Ben-Hur, 2003; Wiesner and kent, 2004). Independent Component Analysis (Hyvärinen et al., 2001) is also a multivariate technique. ICA consists in finding a linear transformation in such a way that the resulting components are not only uncorrelated but also independent. Independent component are deduced maximizing non gaussianity whereas PCA constructed maximizing variance. Since Clusters makes a distribution multimodal and a multimodal distribution is generally sub-gaussian, it is more reasonable that sub-gaussian ICs indicate presence <strong>of</strong> clusters in the data sets. One specific use for ICA is to pick out clusters from multi-dimensional data via projection (Bugrien et al. 2009). ICA gives optimal results only in connection with PCA as a preprocessing step. In a recent work Scholz et al. (2004) used one genome data (Arabidopsis thaliana) and compare the performance between PCA and ICA after PCA. ICA after PCA a new visualization technique shows the maximum discriminating power whereas PCA the least (Reza et al., 2011). Reza (2011) apply one real dataset but did not compare the performance <strong>of</strong> PCA, ICA and ICA after PCA. Since there are not yet any comparison studies among PCA, ICA and ICA after PCA. Thus in this article, we are interested to compare the performance <strong>of</strong> PCA, ICA and ICA after PCA for visualizing clusters. Our demand is <strong>of</strong>ten but not always. In section 2 we have discussed about the model <strong>of</strong> PCA and ICA that we have applied in our study. In section 3 we have discussed about measure <strong>of</strong> non gaussianity. In section 4 we have discussed both real and simulated data sets. In section 5 we have presented the graphs and discussed overall findings and conclusion are drawn in the final section. 169"
