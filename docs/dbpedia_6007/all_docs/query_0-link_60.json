        "text": "The paper focuses on the metaphor of the saints’ body/border as a means to analyse the social field of the migratory flows between Sicily and Sri Lanka. The saints’ body is viewed as important on a symbolic-sacred level, but even more broadly as a centre of what migrants experience in the in-between space spanning ‘here’ and ‘there’: as living simulacra of a civic-religious cult that crosses borders, the saints’ relics function as a site of agency and a medium of communication. Far from a rigid and pre-established container that constrains migrants’ lives, the social field established by the flows between Sri Lanka and Sicily is an embodied and circular space forged in part through civic-religious practices that make migrants feel at home in the borders.\n\nGlobalization, Immigration, and Transformation in the Underwater Archaeological Record Assuming that maritime archaeology conducted in Sri Lanka is new to most readers, the present paper has been written with a dual purpose. First, it tries to give some background to the birth and growth of the discipline in this country and shows its involvement in ICOMOS––ICUCH (International Council on Monuments and Sites––International Committee on the Underwater Cultural Heritage) activities. Second, it tries to deal with the focus of the 2013 SHA conference by addressing three sites, each of which can be developed into a case study relating to the conference themes. Sri Lanka was always a place where East/West shipping interacted, whether before or after A.D. 1500, and was also always conscious of the looming presence of India. This paper, however, deals only with material aspects in the period after 1500.\n\nThis is a case study that shows how the Indian Ocean was a major maritime hub up to the 15th century and was gradually replaced by the Atlantic Ocean after the discovery of the Americas by the Europeans and Christopher Columbus. The Arabs and Chinese played a major role in it up to 1433, but for domestic political reasons, the Chinese dropped all practice of ocean navigation and commerce even before the arrival of the Europeans, which contributed to its decline. Right now we are witnessing a reversal, both the come-back of the Indian Ocean as a crucial global area as well as the come-back of the Chinese as the main actor in this area in the present global context. We are going to show striking similarities between the two historical periods (pre-14th century and 21st century). We will consider the central features of this form of the evolution of the Indian Ocean and consider it in terms of the basic perspective of recent post-civil-conflict in Sri Lanka."
