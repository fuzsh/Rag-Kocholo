        "text": "The clotheslines that extended from balconies in Stepanakert showed an extraordinary degree of precision, if not obsession. In this city of 50,000, families had ordered the clothes from smallest to biggest: pink toddler socks gave way to slightly larger red and black ones for children and adults, then underwear (sorted by color), and finally a sequence of ever-larger shirts, hung upside down with sleeves outstretched, like an army of invisible superheroes swooping down from the sky.\n\nCould it be that living in the limbo of a self-declared but largely unrecognized country drives people to seek order in other ways? It was a thought that occurred to me after a weekend in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, where about 150,000 Armenians (and a smattering of others) live over 1,700 square miles of mountains, rivers and valleys in the Caucasus Mountains. To the west is an easygoing border with Armenia; to the east is a disputed boundary with Azerbaijan, which sees regular sniper attacks and, last year, a downed helicopter incident.\n\nThe area’s complicated history goes back centuries. Most recently, a bitter war in the early 1990s, in which the Armenian-majority enclave declared independence from Azerbaijan (which months earlier had declared independence from the Soviet Union), drove out the minority Azeris, and sucked in ethnic Armenians fleeing the rest of Azerbaijan. A new constitution in 2006 declared it a sovereign state.\n\nYet today, the de facto Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is not recognized by any member of the United Nations; most sources, including Google Maps, place it squarely in Azerbaijan. And though it has its own flag and government, it is deeply connected with and dependent on Armenia, which supplies its currency and military, among other things.\n\nThe area’s tourism options, though, are rough-edged but spirited, and the region is generally considered safe for travelers — who, of course, should steer clear of that tense eastern border. And most significantly for me, during a recent off-season trip to the area, it turned out to be excellent for travelers on a tight budget.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
