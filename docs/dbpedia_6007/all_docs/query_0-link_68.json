For nearly a decade, Vicky has challenged me to make my scholarship relevant to non–art historians by focusing on the practical implications of visual arts in day-to-day life. Through the example she sets personally and professionally, and through her careful reading of my work, she pushes me to keep the links between social products and power always within sight. For insightful feedback on draft versions of the manuscript and related talks, I am indebted to Chris Castiglia, Jill Gordon, Julie Hansen, Ena Harris, Sharon Ann Holt, Cynthia Mills, Alex Nemerov, and Jack Quinan. Sharon’s comments in particular were remarkable for their thoroughness and detail. The Press’s two readers, Frances Pohl and Bruce Robertson, each provided thoughtful, meticulous, and generous assessments of the manuscript that helped me reﬁne my thesis. Jolene Rickard’s help was indispensable to me as I thought through my arguments on Native American representation, and I thank her. To Mark Aronson, Ron Gaczewski, Karl Kusserow, and Jack Quinan, I express appreciation for aid in locating, acquiring, and reproducing a number of my illustrations. The Press’s ﬁne arts editor Stephanie Fay does a wonderful job with ideas, words, and psyches. Consequently, there is no editor with whom I would rather work. I am grateful for the diligent and responsive eªorts of her assistants, Erin Marietta and Sigi Nacson. Thanks also to Susan Ecklund, who copyedited the book with precision. Much of the research and writing of this book took place at the Smithsonian Amer-\n\nXIII\n\nXIV\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nican Art Museum, where I had the privilege of being a fellow in 2002–3. I thank Virginia Mecklenburg, Cynthia Mills, and Bill Truettner for fostering a warm and intellectual environment in which to write, and also SAAM and Congress for seeing the value in continuing to fund research in the humanities during this era of social cuts. Among the many fellows who enriched my experience in Washington, I wish to single out Isabel Taube and Catherine Whalen for particular thanks.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWHITE LIKE ME\n\nRace has become metaphorical—a way of referring to and disguising forces, events, classes, and expressions of social decay and economic division far more threatening to the body politic than biological “race” ever was. Expensively kept, economically unsound, a spurious and useless political asset in election campaigns, racism is as healthy today as it was during the Enlightenment. It seems that it has a utility far beyond economy, beyond the sequestering of classes from one another, and has assumed a metaphorical life so completely embedded in daily discourse that it is perhaps more necessary and more on display than ever before. TONY MORRISON, PLAYING IN THE DARK: WHITENESS AND THE LITERARY IMAGINATION, 1992\n\nS\n\night Unseen explores the links between racial identiﬁcation and vision. It probes the role of European-American whiteness in guiding both the form and the meaning of the visual arts during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Without claiming that all whites see the world through an identical lens, Sight Unseen maintains that shared ideologies rooted in race provide a consistent and detectable structure that guides their interpretation of the visual world. This book analyzes the discursive contexts in which selected paintings, photographs, buildings, and early motion pictures were produced and received, tracing how European-Americans internalized historically speciﬁc ideologies linked to whiteness, how such ideologies were both expressed by and impressed on visual texts, and how these texts worked in conjunction with social structures and practices to produce real-life material implications for both white and nonwhite peoples.1 Sight Unseen diªers from many previous studies of race in that its focus on the visual arts does not reﬂect the importance of visual evidence per se in constructing racial identities. Despite the human propensity to privilege sight, and the long-standing Western tendency to root racial designations in observable traits, images do not persuade us to internalize racial values embedded within them, so much as they conﬁrm meanings for which the discourses and structures of our society have predisposed us. Instead of selling us on racial systems we do not already own, the visual ﬁeld powerfully conﬁrms previously internalized beliefs. Because the narratives and meanings visible to us in artworks are supported by forces\n\n1\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nexternal to the works themselves, Sight Unseen expends considerable energy explicating what is unseen. The unseen is at work in the discourses and structures that guide and delimit the signiﬁcance of art but extends as well to the evidence selected for examination and the properties of whiteness itself. In my eªort to illustrate the power and ubiquity of race in conditioning the meaning of American visual culture, I have selected the primary texts scrutinized here for their conspicuous distance from the politics of race. This book not only shuns artworks containing obvious racial themes or tropes, but also avoids analyzing images that include nonwhites. In illuminating the value systems that informed the meaning of genre paintings and adventure ﬁlms populated exclusively with white characters, and landscape photographs and ﬁne arts museums containing no human beings at all, Sight Unseen argues that a decidedly racialized perspective animated even those cultural products most removed from racial concerns.2 The focus on works that exclude nonwhite characters both helps to deﬂate the common assumption that racial minorities catalyze otherwise race-neutral texts into treatises on race and expands the range of evidence used to elucidate whiteness. But perhaps more important, it also mitigates the dangers associated with white scholars’ making a subject of racial others. Since the late 1960s a host of antiracist whites across a range of disciplines have produced sophisticated and sensitive studies of nonwhite racial identities, convinced that their analyses might serve as catalysts for social change. In critiquing the dominant construction of black, brown, or red identity, such studies have had an undeniable impact on the material conditions of nonwhite peoples. Yet in light of the pernicious legacy of whites’ taking both vicarious and physical pleasure in the bodies of nonwhites, it seems prudent to consider the investment of whites in producing even the most progressive analyses of nonwhite representations. Until quite recently, I explained my own investment in teaching and writing on people of color as a natural by-product of my ethnic identity. My concern with racial justice struck me as a reasonable outgrowth of my cultural identiﬁcation as a Jew. As the son of a refugee from Hitler’s Germany, and the nephew of a survivor of Dachau and BergenBelsen, I grew up with family narratives of anti-Semitism, arrest, deportation, and death, which oªered vivid reminders of the dangers inherent in racial classiﬁcation. Concern for disempowered peoples seemed a logical extension of my identity politics. But despite the ways in which I believed myself politically aligned with nonwhite peoples, my identiﬁcation as a Jew did nothing to dismantle my whiteness.3 As a host of scholars have shown, American Jews worked hard throughout the twentieth century at losing those traits, outlooks, and a‹liations that marked them as racially distinct. In contrast to my father’s childhood in Berlin, mine in Toronto was characterized by the possibility of being both Jewish and white. I will have more to say in later chapters on the utility of reading nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century American Jews (or, for that matter, Irish Catholics and Italians) as nonwhite, but for now it is enough to appreciate\n\nWHITE LIKE ME\n\n3\n\nthat widely held perceptions of the racial inferiority of Jews in the 1930s complicated my father’s relation to the dominant ideal of whiteness in ways that were not true for me in the 1960s.4 From time to time I may be made to feel racially insecure based on comments and actions that target my ethnic background, but most of the time I comfortably pass as white. I continue to believe that my slightly outsider status has much to do with my interest in racial questions, though I am now more attuned to the ways in which my whiteness must necessarily complicate this interest. Being Jewish or, for that matter, being female, gay, or working class may well increase one’s potential for sensitivity to societal inequities—even as it sadly oªers no guarantee—but since those of us who are Jewish and white, or female and white, were nonetheless formed by a perspective on the world that owes much to our racial identiﬁcation, it is important to acknowledge what is at stake in our desire to make a subject of racial others. My concern is that white academics who focus on representations of nonwhite peoples—no less than members of the general public who “love” black athletes, comedians, and musicians—may use the mantle of “racial justice” as a respectable cover for indulging in our long-standing fascination with the other.5 There is a way in which the public and academic attraction of whites to images depicting blacks might constitute a twenty-ﬁrst-century incarnation of the minstrel show.6 The claim is less fantastic than it may seem, given the insatiable white desire for racial others, as well as the complex cultural functions of minstrel performance. As historians from Eric Lott to Michael Rogin have cogently explained, minstrelsy has long provided an outlet for the conﬂicted racial impulses of whites, expressing both the denigration and the celebration of black American life. Instead of creating satirical skits that only lampooned African Americans, and so solidiﬁed northern support for the slave system, or later, segregation, minstrelsy expressed both fear and desire, disavowal and identiﬁcation. In presenting minstrelsy as ambivalent and conﬂicted, contemporary scholars have sought not to defend it as positive or even benign but to explore its complex cultural functions for nineteenth- and twentieth-century Americans, and to allow modern readers to see beyond what we take today as its unmitigated racism. This revisionist account helps explain how both abolitionist and proslavery Americans could attend and appreciate the same performances by drawing on those elements of the spectacle that resonated with their own views.7 Once we acknowledge the contradictory cultural meanings that minstrelsy embodied, we can appreciate how the performances necessarily promoted views that segments of their audience did not consciously embrace. White abolitionists who enjoyed minstrel shows may have believed that the performances celebrated African American life, but it should be obvious that their ﬁnancial and moral investment in the genre promoted collateral meanings they were unable to control. Minstrelsy did not promote either pos-\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nitive or negative images of African Americans depending on the politics of a given audience member; to varying degrees, it advanced both simultaneously. The cultural work that minstrelsy performed for even racially progressive whites remained ambiguous, even if some audiences judged its impact as beneﬁcial to blacks. Given that most blacks in nineteenth-century America deplored minstrelsy while such racially progressive whites as Walt Whitman and Abraham Lincoln attended minstrel performances, and considering that as powerful an antiracist as Mark Twain expressed unequivocal love for minstrelsy, it seems appropriate for whites today to consider how our modern interest in the black image may express a cultural complexity—a multivalence—of which we are similarly unaware. Knowing of the long-standing white need for black others should make us skeptical of claims that well-meaning whites can transcend their race’s investment in depictions of nonwhites. Because even progressive whites are still white, I am convinced that those of us motivated by a vision of racial justice should begin an analysis of race by assessing how white identity aªects the lives of both white and nonwhite peoples. This process might start with European-American scholars shifting their primary evidence of race from black to white representations. To suggest such a shift is not to say that people of color approach images of nonwhites objectively, but simply to acknowledge the markedly diªerent stakes for each group. Nonwhites (not whites) pay the cultural and material price for any analysis of racial minorities that inadvertently reinforces cultural stereotypes or feeds the white need for racial others. Given the stakes for minority peoples, our understanding that the “problem” of race lies primarily with the group that holds most of the power, and considering the growing number of studies on African American, Latino, Native American, and Asian American depictions produced today by nonwhite peoples, we might ask, why would whites concerned with racial justice not begin their examinations with their own racial representations? As bell hooks urges, it is time “for concerned folks, for righteous white people, to begin to fully explore the way white supremacy determines how they see the world, even as their actions are not informed by the type of racial prejudice that promotes overt discrimination and separation.”8 For hooks and contemporary scholars of race, whiteness is clearly not a natural identity rooted in our genes but a malleable social product. Notwithstanding how the many historians of whiteness choose to deﬁne it—through its eªects (as a kind of violence, blindness, or entitlement), through its secondary characteristics (as self-regulation, control, or rigidity), or as a coherent entity (such as a form of property or a self-perpetuating discourse or structure)—all share a belief in its artiﬁciality.9 Virtually every study of whiteness opens with the academic commonplace that there are no signiﬁcant genetic distinctions between the races, and that our system of racial classiﬁcation is an invention of the West. The melanin concentrations that Americans read as signs of racial belonging may be genetically grounded, but as academics routinely point out, there is\n\nWHITE LIKE ME\n\n5\n\nno biological reason to group human populations according to skin color. While color is a culturally signiﬁcant sign for separating various human populations, researchers have long maintained that there is no more logic to this demarcation of race than there would be in ﬁxing a racial order based on other genetic patterns, such as eye color, balding patterns, or lactose intolerance. Americans who trace their earliest-known ancestors to Kenya are likely to be darker than those whose origins are in Norway, but we know that there is as much genetic variation within the “black” and “white” races as between them.10 As James Baldwin famously remarked, “Color is not a human or a personal reality; it is a political reality.”11 Politically progressive scientists and historians have embraced the concept of race as a social product, in part, because it so eªectively discredits group claims for racial superiority. Even casual students of history will appreciate the racial impetus behind some of the twentieth century’s most infamous acts of genocide—against Armenians in Turkey (1915–18, 1920–23), Jews in Europe (1941–45), ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese in Cambodia (1975–79), Kurds in Iraq (1988), Tutsis in Rwanda (1994), Muslims in Srebrenica (1995), and black Africans in Darfur, Sudan (2004–). Given the frequent rationalization of laws, policies, prejudices, and crimes by reference to “innate” and “natural” diªerences between human groups, it is no wonder that we are attracted to imagining that all begin life with an identical biological base. But those who argue for our social construction, ﬁnding the evidence for human equality in genetic sameness, ironically ally themselves with those who support racial hierarchies, to the extent that each group adheres to identity models grounded in biological determinism. For social constructivists, genetic homogeneity ensures racial equality, while for biological determinists, genetic diªerence produces racial hierarchy.12 In both cases, genes are the base dictating the shape of racial superstructures. The stance of social constructivists has the added eªect of leaving their arguments vulnerable to advances in genetic analysis, for should improved technology allow scientists to discover consistent genetic signatures separating racial groups, the rationale for racial equality would appear open to attack. Such concerns are more than hypothetical, given that recent progress in genomic research has begun to chip away at the orthodoxy that genes are unconnected to racial divisions. In 2002 a group of American, French, and Russian researchers developed a technique for accurately determining an individual’s place of genetic origin, reliably grouping their test subjects into one of ﬁve geographic regions based on an examination of correspondences in their genomes. While the researchers were careful not to invoke the loaded label of “race” in their published report, their geographic zones closely correspond to popular racial categories, dividing the world’s population by descent into African, Eurasian (European and Middle Eastern), East Asian, Oceanic, and American.13 Their work is complemented by that of Steven Pinker, a psychologist of language, who argues that academics have consistently suppressed evidence of how genes shape human be-\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhavior, for fear of undermining cherished principles of equality under law. For Pinker, scientiﬁc analysis of the links between certain social behaviors, innate abilities, and biology need not bring about conﬂict with our moral value system. Committed to legal equality, and unconvinced by the sensationalistic arguments of Richard Hernstein and Charles Murray that the IQ “gap” between various races has a genetic component, Pinker nonetheless argues that particular elements of our makeup are hardwired into our genes.14 Pinker’s work focuses on general social behaviors (our drive for dominance, ethnocentrism, and moral sensibility) and abilities (our intuitive physics, spatial sense, and propensity for language), which he sees as innate in human beings, even as he leaves open the possibility that minor genetic distinctions between races might play a role in predisposing the individuals in racial groups to other subtle behaviors or abilities.15 To conclude that populations closed to outside groups for tens of thousands of years share a detectable genetic signature, or that some social behaviors and abilities might have a genetic tie, is a long way from declaring that Jews are genetically programmed for avarice or that blacks are naturally slothful. To acknowledge minor racial diªerences does not mean asserting racial superiority any more than accepting the existence of major genetic diªerences between the sexes necessarily entails an argument for the superiority of either females or males. To be sure, innate diªerences are routinely noted in support of claims for the supremacy of one sex over the other, but corresponding assertions are also made for various races, despite forty-odd years of academic rhetoric stressing the social nature of racial divisions. Whether human beings are ultimately shaped by society, biology, or some combination of the two, racial justice is a moral imperative that must not hinge on the vicissitudes of popular or scientiﬁc identity theories. As Pinker writes, “The case against bigotry is not a factual claim that humans are biologically indistinguishable. It is a moral stance that condemns judging an individual according to the average traits of certain groups to which the individual belongs.”16 Whether or not our racial divisions are linked to biology, it is inarguable that our experience of race is shaped predominantly in the social ﬁeld. Academics in recent decades have produced an impressive corpus of research detailing the ﬂuid borders of whiteness during the past three hundred years. We know from the work of historians that Protestant European-Americans deemed Irish Catholics racially inferior into the ﬁnal third of the nineteenth century and that they rejected Jews as their racial equals up through the middle of the twentieth.17 From legal scholars we have learned that, beginning in the last two decades of the nineteenth century, numerous immigrants went to court asking to be designated white so that they might become naturalized citizens of the United States. Between 1790, when naturalization was limited to “free white persons,” and 1952, when overtly racial criteria for citizenship were dropped, scores of immigrants turned to the courts in the hope of being declared white. Citing a bewildering array of contradictory rationales, including scientiﬁc evidence, common knowledge, congressional in-\n\nWHITE LIKE ME\n\n7\n\ntent, and legal precedent, federal and even Supreme Court judges shifted racial borders by extending white identity to individuals from Mexico and Armenia, and at times to those from Syria, India, and Arabia.18 In opinions that show no awareness of the ways in which their collective eªorts shaped race as a social and legal ﬁction, U.S. judges worked diligently to secure what they took as the natural borders of race. Given both the potential dangers of linking moral claims for equality to social deﬁnitions of race and our understanding that socially produced criteria have historically guided American racial thought and policy, it makes little sense for scholars in the humanities and social sciences to wade into debates on correspondences between genetic markers and modern racial deﬁnitions. Biology should concern historians only to the extent that perceptions of biological makeup have consistently produced social deﬁnitions of race. Biology in early twentieth-century America was wedded to race by ethnic (and at times religious and even political) ties, taken as signs of an individual’s immutable biology and so determining who could be classiﬁed white. As we shall see, the discourses and structures of American society encouraged both whites and nonwhites to embrace a white perspective on the world (that naturalized the perquisites of European-Americans), even as ﬂuctuating perceptions of biological identity severely restricted who might and might not enjoy the beneﬁts of being labeled white. The chapters that follow take seriously the importance of situating racial identities in social context. Each analyzes how the borders of whiteness have expanded and contracted over time and outlines the structural and discursive forces that made such changes possible. Each considers how shifting deﬁnitions of whiteness presented opportunities and perils for Native American, African American, and European-American peoples. Yet, the chapters are more concerned to illustrate the material consequences that result from being white than to trace the ﬂuid boundaries of whiteness. I claim that acceptance of whiteness conditions the sight, beliefs, and actions of European-Americans, thus naturalizing their sense of entitlement, but more signiﬁcant, I argue that this racialized value system led European-Americans to interpret their art in decidedly racial terms. By the end of the nineteenth century, the perspective that came with being white was su‹ciently ingrained in the European-American mind that it consistently structured whites’ interpretations of the visual world. I claim that racial thinking has long infected how European-Americans view and respond to their environments, but do not insist that everything in America is always about race. The distinction is signiﬁcant. In analyzing visual texts that contain no links to racial subjects (and often no sign of human beings), I illustrate how whites used the logic of race as a powerful, comforting mold for casting both human products and the natural environment into recognizable forms. As my chapters demonstrate, genre paintings depicting white farmers, landscape photographs of the western frontier, ﬁne arts museums, and early action ﬁlms were made intelligible in part through racialized viewing prac-\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntices of which European-Americans were utterly unaware. Although whites did not see race as an issue in any of my primary texts, they nevertheless responded to the works in ways that betrayed their investment in being white. Sight Unseen radically shifts the boundary of what counts as “racial” by refusing to conﬁne its inquiry to texts containing obvious racial themes. Politically progressive studies of art that expose European-American investment in racial hierarchies center on the depictions of white and nonwhite peoples, aiming to end their unequal treatment in art. Over time, such analyses have had the unintended eªect of equating the narratives of art with identity formation, racial symptoms with the illness itself. Since altering how whites and nonwhites are represented cannot by itself cause (or cure) racial inequalities rooted in structural and discursive systems, it is essential that racial studies probe beneath the narrative surface of images. Only by unearthing both the operational logic of race and its manner of guiding the interpretation of our visual world may we come to comprehend, and potentially dislodge, its power in American culture. Somewhat uneasily, I refer throughout the text to those Americans classiﬁed as white as European-American. I do this to distinguish whites in the Americas from those in Europe but also to produce a term that parallels the terms “African American,” “Asian American,” and “Native American.” To disrupt the apparent self-evidence of what the term “white” signiﬁes, I elect to employ a clunky alternative that embodies the messy and contradictory ways in which modern racial divisions are produced. This decision presents some obvious di‹culties, given that all people from Europe residing in the United States were not accorded equal claim to status as white. But even such a di‹culty presents certain advantages, for in those cases where I am forced to distinguish between, say, Protestant and Jewish European-Americans, the needed adjectives compel readers to confront the inconsistent and historically contingent nature of racial deﬁnition. Because the term “white” occludes contradictions that are unavoidable in the phrase “Catholic European-American,” it is ultimately less useful to my project. Its neatness is something of a liability in a study devoted to exploring how race works. The picture of whiteness that emerges in this book reﬂects, in part, the legal deﬁnitions mandated by Congress and policed by the nation’s courts. But it is primarily a representation of cultural understandings of who is and who is not white, and of the shifting hierarchy that exists within the white race. The apparent clarity with which legal deﬁnitions purport to divide black from white ﬂattens the lived reality of many Americans, given that the legal designation “white” has never guaranteed equal treatment under the law, never mind social or economic equality, for those whose whiteness is less culturally secure.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN RACE\n\nI\n\nn a lengthy tribute to William Sidney Mount (1807–68) in 1851, the critic Alfred Jones lauded the painter’s honest treatment of American racial types. Jones showed considerable interest in exploring both black and white identity in Mount’s works, though, revealingly, he found racial themes at play only in those canvases that included blacks. For Jones and his European-American contemporaries, an African American presence was required to think through the racial identity of those categorized as black, but it was also necessary for considering the racial designation of those deemed white. As period responses to the European-American laborers in Farmers’ Nooning (1836; ﬁg. 1) make clear, the protagonists owed their whiteness to the presence of a black. For Jones, the scene provided a “perfect transcript” of life, documenting “how lazily lolls the sleeping Negro on the hay [while] the white farmers are naturally disposed about with their farming implements.”1 The nonwhite ﬁgure cued the critic to invoke a series of binaries (lazy and industrious, asleep and awake, black and white), which gave to whiteness tangible, visible traits. In European-American culture, nonwhites have historically functioned as racial catalysts, transforming whites from individual human ﬁgures into symbols of an otherwise unmarked race.2 Mount’s Boys Caught Napping in a Field (1848; ﬁg. 2) depicts a similar rural scene of midday ease, yet lacking a nonwhite ﬁgure, it had nothing overt to say about race. Whereas the African American of Farmers’ Nooning is entitled to rest during his lunchtime break, the white youths in Boys Caught Napping are clearly shirking their responsibilities. Even without the aid of its title, the canvas’s visual evidence presents us with 11\n\n12\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nWilliam Sidney Mount, Farmers’ Nooning, 1836.

A discarded pitchfork is displayed prominently in the center foreground, and a deck of cards—long a symbol of gambling and, hence, vice— spills from the cap of the central youth. Despite these signs of dereliction, EuropeanAmerican audiences were not led to reﬂect on the racial ﬁtness of the boys. The same viewers who saw the African American protagonist of Farmers’ Nooning as a sign for an inferior race took the white miscreants of Boys Caught Napping as individuals, who apparently revealed little about their racial group. An anonymous critic describing the scene’s allure to European-American viewers in 1848 noted how “we . . . look with feelings of regret somewhat akin to envy at the delicious indolence of the boys Caught Napping who bask under the shady trees and are troubled by no care or anxiety.”3 Far from\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n13\n\nWilliam Sidney Mount, Boys Caught Napping in a Field, 1848.

FIGURE 2\n\noªering an exposé of white idleness, the canvas presented viewers with a nostalgic ode on the pleasures of (white) boyhood. European-Americans overwhelmingly accepted the existence of a racial opposition between black sloth and white industry, yet they were nonetheless able to view the white youths’ “delicious indolence” in Boys Caught Napping as an appealing trait. This suggested no paradox to European-American audiences. Without an African American presence to activate racial binaries or to transform whites into symbols of their race, viewers interpreted the youths as lazy individuals who just happened to be white. Because no ideological context existed then to taint European-Americans’ perceptions of their race, the social or economic implications of whites who acted in seemingly unwhite ways were limited. It was not simply that European-Americans overlooked the indolence of the youths, but that they viewed their laziness in positive terms. Virtually identical actions\n\n14\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nconﬁrmed both the innate “laziness” of blacks and the “delicious” quality of white boyhood. So ingrained was this racial asymmetry that the obviously European-American laborer lounging in the right foreground of Farmers’ Nooning did nothing to disrupt the racialized binary of indolence and industry that critics saw as central to the work. The historical inability of European-Americans to see whiteness at work entails considerable costs. These are evident in the economic, political, and judicial inequities suffered by nonwhite peoples—already touched on in the introduction and to be detailed in the chapters that follow—and in less-often-remarked-upon biases that impair our ability to account for the lived complexity of race. Prior to analyzing the racial investment of European-Americans in late nineteenth-century painting, this chapter accounts for how current art historical biases necessarily skew the analysis of whiteness; it then proªers a three-step formula for analyzing race that takes into account the historically contingent processes by which we read meaning from visual texts. Convinced that discourses circulating outside art objects circumscribe their signiﬁcance, I begin my study by analyzing the dominant discourses that established the parameters for what visual texts might mean, before attending to the visual evidence of the art. Since acknowledgment of the social utility in examining whiteness is some distance from developing a practical model for its analysis, this chapter lays out a legible road map for approaching race in the visual arts, establishing the route for the chapters that follow. It should come as no surprise that a culture blind to whiteness developed similarly oblivious art historical methods.4 All methods are fashioned from distinct perspectives and priorities, each with an internal logic. Such logic ensures that methods have builtin blind spots, at times because various issues are deemed extraneous to the central inquiry, but also because they may not even register as issues: empiricist approaches tend to miss the cultural relativism of truths; Marxist methods, the dynamics of gender; and structuralist inquiries, the notion of agency. Because the oª-the-shelf methods available to Americanists were forged in a culture unattuned to whiteness, they all possess deﬁciencies for the analysis of race. At their best, our standard methods serve as a blunt tool for examining race; at their worst, they simply conﬁrm the impression of most Americans that nothing new or remarkable can be learned about individuals labeled white. Our methods impede the study of race by internalizing the racial blindness characteristic of our society; they then compound the problem through their visual determinacy. Because virtually all methods root their inquiries in the visual evidence of artworks, they participate in an endless feedback loop: methods that privilege visual evidence combine with our cultural blindness to whiteness to ensure that texts containing only white people—or those containing no ﬁgures at all—have nothing to say about race. This visual determinacy is endemic to our methodological landscape, for although Americanists today employ a range of approaches, virtually every one is anchored ﬁrst in the visual\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n15\n\nregister. Even approaches typically taken as polar opposites in American art history— formal and contextual methods—support my claim. Formalists believe in the autonomy and primacy in art of line, color, texture, and, in some instances, representation. Contextualists, in turn, see art as inextricably linked to culture; they believe that no understanding of the ﬁne arts is possible without a thorough grounding in the economic, political, philosophical, and religious underpinnings of a society. If these are the strict deﬁnitions, the practice of Americanists is considerably less clear-cut, for the boundaries between camps frequently blur, and formal and contextual approaches both continually evolve in response to ongoing disciplinary debates. Claims made for the supposed primacy of form are frequently used by formalists to support broader claims for other artworks and American culture. Similarly, contextualists routinely promote the sociology of art—that is, while paying attention to the context provided by external social forces, use art to understand society. They explain how social forces guide what art gets made and how and consider what that art, in turn, says about our values. To my mind, the most politically responsible scholarship produced by members of each camp seizes on the potential of art to illuminate culture, with formalists focused on the art itself, and contextualists more concerned with factors external to the art object. The formalists’ privileging of visual evidence oªers many advantages for the study of visual culture, including attention to the materiality of art and a corresponding insistence on not reﬂexively subordinating visual to text-based evidence. It also presents serious drawbacks. To ground the meaning of an artifact in its visual evidence exaggerates the power of art objects, limits our ability to see the range of cultural work performed by art, and in the case of racial inquiries, predisposes us to overlook whiteness by ensuring that we root our analysis in what is readily seen. Certainly the artifacts of a given society constitute a material residue of that culture’s past, but an investment in the object, coupled with a general reticence to see any art as simply a mirror of social values, leads many formalist scholars to overstate the cultural impact of artifacts. Studies that stress the primacy of visual evidence make it di‹cult to read an artwork as an intellectual dead end or a mere reﬂection of dominant norms. The tendency is always to interpret artworks as proactive, counterhegemonic, and anticipating future trends.The investment in close looking—and, hence, in a privileged object—enshrines each work as a rare and singular artifact. Reliance on “visual evidence” entails other risks as well. In many such studies there is an underlying assumption that what we see in an artwork as “obvious,” “signiﬁcant,” or “strange,” or even what we take to be the work’s primary narrative, was read in a similar way by the work’s original viewers. Close looking helps us understand the original culture only if we can accept vision as a self-evident and unchanging route to knowledge; but as a number of scholars—from art historians to neurobiologists—have con-\n\n16\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nvincingly argued, human vision is contingent on historical context.5 We cannot approximate the viewing experience of a canvas’s original audience in the nineteenth century, because of how our historical moment conditions our sight. Frederic Edwin Church, working in nineteenth-century America, and Fan K’uan, painting in eleventh-century China, each impressed his countrymen with his “truthful” depictions of the natural world (ﬁgs. 3, 4). Notwithstanding the penchant of these artists for selectively combining natural forms in their compositions and for using subjective representational systems, these paintings were taken as veritable transcripts of nature. Readers will instantly appreciate the futility of debating the relative truthfulness of the depictions, given the dissimilar value systems informing the creation of these two works. Whereas Fan’s contemporaries valued his ability to conjure up the internal essence of nature, Church’s audiences prized his photograph-like replication of external forms. If one considers “truthful” those scenes rendered in parallel perspective, with objects viewed frontally from a constantly shifting rather than a ﬁxed vantage, and with light eliminated as an external organizing principle, then Fan’s work is clearly superior. If, in contrast, one values linear perspective, with additive forms organized by an external light source, and photographic rendering of detail, then Church’s work is more satisfying.6 One’s evaluation of the landscapes’ veracity indicates reasonably well the cultural system that dominates one’s worldview. The diªerences in culture and vision between eleventh-century China and twentyﬁrst-century America make it impossible for us to ground arguments about Fan’s art and society in the visible evidence of his painting; we cannot see what the artist and his contemporaries saw. Without claiming that it is impossible to learn a new way of seeing more in keeping with Fan’s, I nonetheless believe that a study rooted in the formal elements of a canvas will lead mostly to insights on the modern critics who do the looking. If the gulf between us and the Victorian era is less than that between us and the Sung dynasty, still the cultural divide remains signiﬁcant. Since realist novels and sentimental paintings are still produced today, our conversancy with the artistic forms of the Gilded Age masks the signiﬁcance of the altered social context in which such forms are read. The problem is only exacerbated by the long-standing American penchant for naturalistic art. Because the art of Victorian America minutely reproduces our modern sense of sight, it is easy to downplay the changes separating us from the Gilded Age. Familiar genres and naturalistic renderings serve to cloak more than a century of change. Although the best formalist studies are always careful to move beyond the visual evidence of an isolated artwork—taking into account an eclectic array of historical evidence in their analyses— the bedrock insistence that visual evidence establish the direction of inquiry diminishes the likelihood of producing readings that counter what our modern eyes can “see.” On one level, our experience of nineteenth-century art diªers from that of Victorian Americans because of the cultural work that the texts themselves performed. In Hard Facts: Setting and Form in the American Novel, Philip Fisher argues that the experience\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n17\n\nFIGURE 3 Frederic Edwin Church, Cotopaxi, 1855. Oil on canvas, 71.1 × 106.8 cm. Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC. Gift of Mrs. Frank R. McCoy.\n\nof modern-day audiences reading Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852) cannot replicate that of readers in the 1850s because of the ways in which the novel has altered American culture. By leading white readers to experience the emotion of black characters, and thus perceive their humanity, Uncle Tom’s Cabin counterbalanced the indiªerence and cruelty to which blacks were subject in antebellum society. But, as Fisher notes, the triumph of the novel’s humanizing strategy has meant that present-day readers confront the sentimental ethos of a text that no longer has anything to balance. The novel (in conjunction with a host of other period texts) has done its work so well—obliterating that which it was created to refute—that we can no longer experience it as an antidote to a poisonous ideology. We can and do recognize the dehumanizing context in which the novel ﬁrst circulated, but it is di‹cult to conceive how we might ground our understanding of it in the formal properties of the text and yet experience Uncle Tom’s Cabin in a manner approaching that of antebellum audiences.7 On a more elemental level, cultural trends having little to do with artworks per se distort our modern experience of nineteenth-century texts. Broad cultural shifts unrelated\n\nFIGURE 4\n\nFan K’uan, Travelers amid Streams and Mountains, after 1033. Hanging scroll, ink and color on silk, 206.3 × 103.3 cm.

Cultural determinacy leads formalist viewers of Homer Dodge Martin’s Iron Mine, Port Henry, New York (ca. 1862; ﬁg. 5), for example, to see the painting through the lens of contemporary environmentalism. Audiences today, molded by decades of modern conservationist rhetoric—from Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962) to Al Gore’s Earth in the Balance (1992)—doubtless focus on deforestation and erosion as evidence of industry’s degradation of the land, though Martin’s contemporaries most likely saw a very diªerent scene.8 Midcentury Americans overwhelmingly shared an optimistic attitude toward development, believing in the potential compatibility of industry and nature and in the resilience of the natural world. Many of the nineteenth-century painters and photographers who are taken today as advocates of wilderness protection also produced canvases that championed the development of the land. As the art historian Nicolai Cikovsky Jr. reminds us, George Inness saw no inconsistency in creating scenes of untrammeled nature at the same time that he celebrated the railroad’s transformation of the Lackawanna Valley (ﬁg. 6).9 In a posthumous tribute to Martin after his sudden death in 1897, the art historian John C. Van Dyke noted critics’ universal appreciation of Martin’s “landscapes . . . deserted\n\n20\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nFIGURE 6\n\nGeorge Inness, The Lackawanna Valley, ca. 1856.

After they have passed, nature once more returns to herself. She is ru›ed for a moment and then only in a small localized area.”10 Whereas to modern audiences the scraggly trees at the borders of Martin’s denuded hillside represent the pathos of the land’s destruction, for Van Dyke and his contemporaries they surely signaled nature’s reclamation of a landscape seemingly abandoned by human beings. What we are conditioned to see as a scene of ruin, Victorians could appreciate as an image of rebirth. In signiﬁcant ways, the problems with formalist art historical methods I have enumerated might seem to be overcome by the contextualists’ distinctive approach. By emphasizing the context surrounding the production of artworks and by downplaying the centrality of visual evidence, contextual art historians reduce the risk of projecting personal or cultural biases on historical artifacts. But the approach of contextualists is strangely menaced by visual determinism, for although their theoretical position may downplay the role of formal properties, their practice of art history is surprisingly attentive to visual evidence. Contextualists rarely ignore the formal attributes of an artwork that contribute to its narrative, subject matter, style, and color, considering only its history of production and reception, or its medium. In determining which contexts are\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n21\n\nworthy of analysis, contextual historians necessarily consider what artworks depict. Thus, at an early stage of analysis, contextualists buy into the representational systems of art, taking the subjects of illusionary scenes as meaningful to their inquiries. This investment in the primacy of vision may strike some readers as a rather strained link between formalists and contextualists, but I want to make a case for its signiﬁcance in circumscribing the meanings contextual studies of art produce. It is less consequential that contextual inquiries quickly move beyond formal properties than that they start there, for by acknowledging form researchers delimit the range of social factors deemed “appropriate” for discussion. The analyses of patronage, academic training, and markets will always be relevant, but I am interested in scholars’ decisions to select additional contextual frames invariably based on visual information and that, in studies of nineteenth-century American art, almost always involve some consideration of narrative. Although it seems reasonable that a landscape painting encourages a contextualist’s analysis of environmental issues, or a ﬁlm about shoppers raises issues of consumerism, these connections by their very obviousness, which suggest themselves to every scholar and member of the public who but glances at the artwork, preclude the consideration of other, less obvious, contexts. Late twentieth-century scholarship on Mount exempliﬁes the contextualists’ de facto reliance on visual evidence. Since the 1970s social historical readings that argue for the works’ bold assertions of the artist’s party politics have supplanted the standard interpretations of his images as sleepy vignettes of country life. Art historians, to recuperate allegorical readings that were widely understood during the artist’s lifetime, have concentrated on the works’ pictorialization of contemporary slang, market philosophies, and political slogans. Beginning with Joseph Hudson’s trailblazing study of Cider Making (1841; ﬁg. 7) as an allegory of William Henry Harrison’s successful “log cabin and hard cider” presidential campaign of 1840, through Elizabeth Johns’s inﬂuential analysis of Farmers’ Nooning (see ﬁg. 1) as a cautionary note on foreign-born agitators “tickling the ears” of African Americans, and thus providing them with unrealistic expectations of abolition’s beneﬁts, contextual art historians have grounded elaborate readings of Mount’s works on the paintings’ visual cues.11 Allegorical interpretations serve important cultural functions for contemporary art historians. By rooting meaning in coded signs consciously crafted by the artist, the readings both express a ﬁrmly held belief in artistic agency and a‹rm meaning as singular, lucid, and recoverable with su‹cient research. But an allegorical approach entails signiﬁcant drawbacks: it disregards the reception of art by heterogeneous audiences who may or may not have known the artist’s overt design; it slights the works’ complexity and play; it creates a static picture of the paintings, downplaying the ways in which meanings change over time; and, most signiﬁcant, it ignores the most elemental meanings, which have nothing to do with conscious intent.\n\n22\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nFIGURE 7\n\nWilliam Sidney Mount, Cider Making, 1841.

Scholars are inclined to characterize any image produced between 1861 and 1865, however an artist’s patrons or public received it, as at least an unselfconscious reference to the Civil War. On one hand, this makes perfect sense, for how could cultural products created during a national trauma not relate to the conﬂict on some level? On the other hand, surely there is something too pat about our reﬂexive conclusion that if it is the 1860s, the issue must be the Civil War; if the 1830s, Andrew Jackson’s bank war; if the 1890s, the Jim Crow era, or at least the closing of the western frontier. Although methods privileging visual evidence are sure to uncover narratives prompted by an artwork’s formal properties, they are destined to overlook more basic meanings generated by invisible discourses circulating in the common culture. These shared discourses help animate the meaning of art, because those of us who produce and interpret art have our vision partially structured by discourses whose cultural work precedes— and need not be activated by—individual artworks. As counterintuitive as it might sound, these invisible discourses are more revealing of a culture than its artworks, given their unobtrusive work in establishing limits on the range of meanings that a text, and a culture, might produce. To reconstruct the meanings of visual artifacts for their original\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n23\n\nFIGURE 8\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright, Darwin Martin House, 1904–6. Buªalo, NY. University Archives Collection, SUNY Buªalo.\n\naudiences, then, we must ask what the works were not about, focusing on unseen discourses that no amount of looking can tease out. I do not recommend that if the dominant discourses Mount’s contemporaries sensed in Farmers’ Nooning relate to abolition, agrarianism, or labor politics, we now arbitrarily tie the canvas to gender relations, merely for the sake of producing a counterreading. But once we have acknowledged that powerful unseen discourses circulating in society play a signiﬁcant role in determining how an artwork gets seen, it is imperative to visualize the discourses these artworks fail to depict. Although discourse is popularly conceived as a coherent set of beliefs on a subject or theme, it is understood herein in Foucauldian terms—as a well-deﬁned body of social knowledge. The discourse of race, for example, is composed of many ideologically irreconcilable beliefs, uniﬁed only by our acceptance of arbitrary boundaries on the statements and the debates that may proceed under its rubric. Powerful yet seldom-remarkedupon discursive boundaries allow me to refer to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Darwin Martin House (ﬁg. 8) as “a successful example of the architect’s mature prairie house style, with his signature cantilevered roof” and to contend that it “makes appropriate use of such modern materials as concrete, glass, and steel in ways that exemplify the modern era,” but also to claim that “it is a spacious six-bedroom home on a generous corner lot, containing original woodwork, updated kitchen, and a new roof.” It is easy to distinguish the passage in the academic style of an architectural critic from that in the commercial language of a sales agent, for each description adheres to the disciplinary rules of its\n\n24\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nprofession. In each example, a discursive logic establishes the parameters for appropriate thought and speech long before the ﬁrst descriptive phrase is uttered.12 My approach to visual analysis sees meaning shaped by the complex interaction of discourses—those that circulate invisibly in the common culture, others prompted by general themes of an artwork, and those arising from the unique formal properties of the work. Dominant cultural discourses residing in viewers interact with a range of secondary discourses suggested by the work’s subject matter and media to establish the outside boundaries for what the artwork might mean. This initial discursive interaction demarcates the range of possible meaning, without dictating the speciﬁc interpretations at which audiences will arrive. Once outside limits of potential meaning are established, discourses prompted by particular narrative and material attributes of a singular object further narrow the range of meaning. To put this another way, free-ﬂoating invisible discourses (ﬂowing through socialized human beings) interact with thematic discourses (arising from the artwork’s medium, general subject, and display venue) to demarcate the parameters of potential meaning; then speciﬁc discourses arising from formal evidence (stylistic and narrative qualities speciﬁc to a unique material object) constrict possible meanings down to a limited menu, which gives oª the illusion of having sprung organically from the artwork. My method for recovering the signiﬁcance artworks held for period audiences is based on this model of meaning’s production in the visual arts. While my selection of race as the signiﬁcant external discourse guiding the meaning of my chosen artworks may be interpreted as no less subjective than a structuralist’s discovery of racial binaries in the syntax of the image or a social historian’s recovery of racial allegory in its narrative, my approach diªers from theirs in telling ways. Instead of analyzing racial themes in images whose narratives suggest race, I apply whiteness as a category of analysis to artifacts (paintings, as well as photographs, buildings, and ﬁlms) with no visible links to race. Concerned about the ways in which visual evidence typically sets the trajectory of art historical inquiries, thus diminishing analyses by precluding those readings that do not jibe with what is currently seen, I have selected a category of undeniable concern to nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Americans, and then handpicked artifacts that appear removed from such concerns. My analysis of art is not more sophisticated than that of other art historians, though it is undoubtedly more attuned to the investment of European-American audiences in racial patterns of thought. In reading artworks against the grain of their visual evidence, Sight Unseen concerns itself less with what artifacts mean than with how their meanings get produced. To illuminate the complex philosophical and racial discourses that animated late nineteenth-century conceptions of race, and to make concrete my method of reading visual evidence, consider what Mount’s Fair Exchange, No Robbery (1865; ﬁg. 9) meant to postbellum audiences. Completed toward the close of Mount’s career, when his contempo-\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n25\n\nWilliam Sidney Mount, Fair Exchange, No Robbery, 1865. Oil on panel, 64.77 × 83.82 cm.

FIGURE 9\n\nraries were increasingly convinced of his irrelevance to modern American art, the image follows in a long line of amusing genre scenes of country life that the artist had consistently turned out since the early 1830s. Against a backdrop of ripening corn, the mustachioed and goateed man at the center of the painting grips a hat in each hand, evidently in the process of swapping his own ragged hat for the scarecrow’s more serviceable headgear (ﬁg. 10). Because the exchange seems so obviously unfair by present-day standards— with the man simply taking what he desires—modern scholars have read the title as ironic. The historian Charles Colbert, writing in the late twentieth century, terms the canvas’s exchange “decidedly unequal,” claiming that the work oªers a sardonic commentary on the relative value of the man’s and the scarecrow’s labor. According to Col-\n\n26\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nbert, the scene contrasts the industry of the scarecrow, which successfully protects the cornﬁeld from hungry birds, with the idleness of the man, whom he takes to be a feckless vagabond.13 The extent to which the exchange was deemed “fair” during the nineteenth century is suggested by an anonymous review of the work published in the New York Herald in 1871. For this critic, who refers to the work as Swapping Hats and Exchange Is No Robbery, it “represents a country man, who, while crossing a ﬁeld of corn, ﬁnds—as is often the case in this world—that a blessing has alighted on a head which cannot appreciate it: he hastens to exchange his own well worn chapeau for the more presentable Panama of the scarecrow. The gratiﬁcation occasioned by this piece of unlooked for good fortune is well depicted in the face of the young man.”14 Intertwined with the critic’s assertion that the world is unfair, with “blessings” often going to those unable to appreciate them, is an understanding that the man’s ability to value good fortune legitimates his swap of the hats. The exchange is fair not because the hats are equal in value, or even because the respective parties have freely agreed to the trade, but simply because the man getting the best deal appreciates his good fortune in a way that is obviously impossible for the scarecrow. Merely by describing the exchange of hats in positive terms, the critic for the Herald reveals his unspoken belief in the protagonist’s whiteness, for such appreciation and appropriation of material resources were then commonly understood as exclusively white prerogatives; the entitlement of whites has long been naturalized as a central principle of European-American culture. This interpretation may strike some readers as a heavy interpretive burden to place on a simple genre painting, with its illustration of an innocent swap of hats, but I claim not that the painting is about white entitlement but that the worldview of European-Americans ensured that the reception of the image was structured in such racialized terms. Whatever the subject of the painting for its creator or audience, European-Americans viewed it through the lens of white privilege. For nineteenth-century viewers, the exchange at the heart of the narrative tapped into a racialized discourse on property that legitimated ﬁctional conﬁscations as trivial as that of a scarecrow’s hat or, alternatively, real-world appropriations as consequential as those of Native Americans’ land. At either extreme, the logic of whiteness rationalizes appropriating what belonged to those unprotected by a designation as “white.” When contemporary scholars address the historical eagerness of European-Americans to dispossess native peoples of their land, they often explain it as a consequence of the perceived failings of Native Americans. Because native populations were understood by European-Americans to lack Christian, democratic, capitalistic, and individualistic values, whites readily justiﬁed conﬁscating Indian property. Given the many native groups that accepted all the supposed trappings of European-American culture but were nonetheless dispossessed of their lands—the most obvious example being the Cherokee\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nFIGURE 10\n\n27\n\nWilliam Sidney Mount, detail of ﬁgure 9.\n\nNation, forced by the Indian Removal Act of 1830 to relocate west of the Mississippi River, despite the community’s embrace of agriculture, Christianity, and Western-based systems of law and governance—such historians’ explanations must be seen as merely partial. The Cherokees’ fate was sealed not by their inability or unwillingness to acquire particular values or traits but by their designation as racially “other.” As the historian Ronald Sanders points out, Europeans and colonial Americans made sense of Indian identity by assigning Indians a nonwhite position along a racial axis that ran from “European” to “African.” Having scant interest in understanding the value systems of indigenous peoples, European-Americans supplied them with an identity largely prefashioned out of old-world encounters with racial and religious others. The racial binaries that Europeans used to distinguish themselves from Africans (including industrious/lazy, controlled/wild, Christian/heathen, culture/nature, and white/black) gave them a framework for cementing the identities of indigenous peoples in the New World. Although the legal status of Indians ﬂuctuated over the ﬁrst century after contact, the immutability of racial categories ﬁxed their initial designation as racially other. When it came to peoples designated as nonwhite, Europeans conveniently ignored how\n\n28\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nthe dominant signs of civilization and race were obviously cultural.15 Americans stripped them of their land, even though the Cherokees adopted Western values and institutions, because perceptions of their diªerence ensured that Indians were viewed through a racialized frame that took for granted their inability to make proper use of, or appreciate, material resources. Rationalizations for the conﬁscation of Indian land invariably focused on native failings. The justiﬁcation John Winthrop, the ﬁrst governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, laid out during the colonial era for appropriating native lands resonated with EuropeanAmericans for the next two and a half centuries: “That which lies common, and hath never beene replenished or subdued is free to any that possess and improve it.” Winthrop argued that as for “the Natives in New England, they inclose no land, neither have they setled habytation, nor any tame Cattle to improve land by, and soe have no other but a Naturall Right to those Countries, soe as if we leave them su‹cient for their use, we may lawfully take the rest.”16 Up through the end of the nineteenth century, most EuropeanAmericans accepted the prerogative of whites to seize unenclosed land, provided they fenced it and exploited its resources. As Theodore Roosevelt claimed, surveying American history at the turn of the twentieth century, “The settler and pioneer have at bottom had justice on their side; this great continent could not have been kept as nothing but a game preserve for squalid savages.”17 European-American observers sympathetic to native claims seemed equally unable to separate themselves from the logic of white entitlement. Speaking to his Senate colleagues in 1830, during the ﬁerce debate over the Indian removal bill, Senator Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey roundly condemned President Jackson’s legislation, yet he conceded that “when the increase of [white] population and the wants of mankind demand cultivation of the earth, a duty is thereby devolved upon the proprietors of large uncultivated regions, of devoting them to such useful purposes. But such appropriations are to be obtained by fair contract, and for reasonable compensation.”18 Despite being one of the Cherokee people’s greatest advocates in the Senate, Frelinghuysen had internalized the racialized belief that whites had a right to appropriate land that they would make “useful.” As the contemporary legal scholar Cheryl Harris notes in her analysis of whiteness, Indians and blacks were oppressed not by abstract deﬁnitions of race but by the material eªect of such deﬁnitions interacting with conceptions of property.19 The general subject of Fair Exchange, No Robbery cued European-American viewers to tap into a discourse of property, so establishing the parameters for the signiﬁcance of the work. But as we begin to see, the painting’s meanings were produced by the interaction of the visible discourse of property and the invisible discourse of race. One discourse suggested by the image’s subject matter was shaped by a second discourse, which was at issue simply because it resided in a broad cross section of Americans conditioned to privilege the values associated with whites. Modern readers can readily interpret as\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n29\n\nan expression of white privilege the Herald critic’s commentary on who can and cannot appreciate “blessings,” for the issue of white entitlement continues to be relevant to contemporary European-Americans. To account for the conditioning of the nineteenth-century reception of the painting by other strands of racial discourse that no longer resonate with us today proves more di‹cult. If nineteenth-century texts are to possess meanings that are not reducible to modern value systems, we need to recover discursive strands long since faded from view. Period commentary that strikes us as ambiguous, confused, or even banal must be analyzed for what it reveals of narratives that have lost their currency rather than dismissed as an insigniﬁcant idiosyncrasy of a critic or a culture. Consider, for instance, that the Herald critic who drew our attention to entitlement noted his belief that Mount’s scarecrow was “quite equal to Hawthorne’s Feathertop.”20 Invoking the title character of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story “Feathertop: A Moralized Legend” (1852), the anonymous reviewer linked the painting to the most famous scarecrow in American ﬁction before L. Frank Baum’s Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). While it is easy to gloss over the statement as a prosaic observation that both painter and writer depicted scarecrows, the cultural relevance of the assertion is rooted in what this “equality” meant for audiences in the early 1870s. Hawthorne recounts the tale of a scarecrow, named Feathertop, created out of a pumpkin, broken wooden tools, straw, feathers, and threadbare clothes; he is ﬁlled with hundreds of empty stock phrases and is given life by a New England witch. Sent by his creator to court the daughter of a prominent judge in a nearby town, Feathertop projects an image of reﬁnement, convincing nearly everyone he encounters of his aristocratic lineage. Despite his initial social success, the story closes with a distraught Feathertop taking his own life, having caught sight of his “true” reﬂection in a mirror and recognizing, as he explains to the witch, “the wretched, ragged, empty thing I am” (257). Readers today may be predisposed to accept a scarecrow built of straw, broken tools, and a pumpkin as a symbol for a “hollow man,” with a pleasing surface but no depth, but Feathertop confounds such expectations by emerging as the story’s deepest character in the author’s most powerful antiallegorical tale.21 We learn that despite his motley makeup, the scarecrow has “more real substance” than ninety-nine out of a hundred men (249). Yet neither the townspeople who ﬁrst encounter Feathertop nor the scarecrow himself can see beyond appearances to judge his real worth. In Hawthorne’s short story perceptions are always misleading.22 Just as the townspeople mistakenly judge the scarecrow as noble based on their “false” view of his ﬁnery and manners, so the scarecrow errs in ﬁnding himself worthless after glimpsing his “true” visage. Perhaps appropriately, then, we learn that Feathertop comes closest to “vindicating his claims to be . . . human” (257) at the moment he apprehends his reﬂection and misjudges his value. He is most human, then, not when he realizes his actual\n\n30\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nworth but when he relies on a human value system that reads appearance as an index of worth. Harboring feelings “too tender [and] sensibilities too deep” (258) for this world, he takes his life only after accepting that a hollow scarecrow stands for a hollow man. He dies because of an investment in allegory that readers are meant to question.23 Much as with Mount, Hawthorne’s appellation as an allegorical artist promotes a narrow, restrictive understanding of his work. It is intriguing that the Herald critic links the works, given that twenty-ﬁrst-century audiences are likely to note signiﬁcant contrasts between short story and painting. Whereas “Feathertop” conjures up a messy, ﬂuid universe where external signs stand in a complex relation to inner worth, modern scholars consistently read Fair Exchange, No Robbery as depicting a stable, positivistic world.24 Recently scholars have explained the painting as a period allegory of President Andrew Johnson’s political jockeying during Reconstruction and as a pictorial jibe at a much-mocked community of Long Island anarchists; both readings assume that the painting conveyed a straightforward message, readily decoded by the artist’s contemporaries.25 But such positivistic interpretations of Mount’s work bring us no closer to understanding how the nineteenth-century critic linked it to Hawthorne’s inscrutable tale. The critic saw the “equality” of graphic and literary scarecrows because of the philosophical and racial context through which the depictions were ﬁltered in the 1870s— not the similarities in narrative or subject matter, shared use of allegorical conceits, or political views common to the artists. Despite being the products of distinctive ideological contexts, painting and story were drawn together and framed by anxious metaphysical debates then gripping postbellum society. The philosophical ascendancy of idealism over older empiricist paradigms, and the adjustments in racial deﬁnition that the emergent worldview fostered, combined with the internal evidence of the works to argue for more equality than diªerence in the scarecrows. To appreciate how such debates transformed Fair Exchange, No Robbery, consider ﬁrst the intellectual and racial ground out of which Mount’s art developed. Born in 1807 into the early republic, Mount came of age at a time when empiricist thought retained a strong grip on American political and social culture. Driven by a core belief in human rationality and in the possibility of free choice, empiricist thinkers—such as Locke, Voltaire, Hume, Paine, and Jeªerson—provided the intellectual foundations for the new democracy. They articulated both the rights of man and a cogent rationale for rebellion against a tyrannical regime.26 But more relevant to a study of American race is the common view that the egalitarian impulses of empiricist thinkers that nurtured democratic political reforms also played a sizable role in improving the racial climate in the West. According to a host of scholars, empiricism helped break down rationalizations for both slavery and the essentialist concepts of race that supported its imposition.27 Scholars advancing this thesis turn naturally to the writings of John Locke, one of\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n31\n\nempiricism’s most eloquent advocates, who famously wrote in his Two Treatises of Government (1690), “Slavery is so vile and miserable an Estate of Man, and so directly opposed to the generous Temper and Courage of our Nation; that ’tis hardly to be conceived that an Englishman, much less a Gentleman, should plead for’t.” Not only did Locke argue against the institution of slavery, but, as his many admirers suggest, his philosophy helped lay the foundation for racial classiﬁcations uncoupled from physiognomy. Rejecting older philosophical systems that accepted the concept of innate ideas, Locke maintained that human beings begin life as a blank slate to be ﬁlled by experience, not biology. Historically, liberals have read Locke’s concept of the blank slate to support a behaviorist notion of identity, seen to support human equality and individual freedom.28 The philosopher Kay Squadrito, for example, claims that “Locke’s tabula rasa hastened acceptance of the view that blacks are not congenitally inferior to whites.” She argues that “the empiricist polemic against innatism resulted in stress being placed on environmental factors which contribute to diªerences between races as opposed to purported congenital diªerences.”29 But given the insights of revisionist scholars over the past few decades, we cannot simply link empiricism, and Locke’s philosophy in particular, to egalitarian reforms. The man who labeled slavery “vile and miserable,” oddly enough, also invested in slaving companies, authored the colonial Carolina charter enshrining the rights of slave owners, and reasoned that the European ability to make productive, agricultural use of Indian “waste” land allowed for the dismissal of native titles.30 Those wishing to shield Locke from the taint of racism tend to interpret the philosopher’s ties to slavery either as ideologically inconsistent or as a tortured application of his philosophy.31 The philosopher Harry Bracken, however, takes a diªerent, more pragmatic approach to Locke. Noting the rise of modern theories of race during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Locke’s own complicity in the slave trade, and the “remarkable” acceptance and popularity of empiricism over the past several centuries, Bracken suggests that empiricism helped lay the foundations for modern conceptions of race.32 Although some of the world’s oldest written texts illustrate the human tendency to make distinctions based on physical appearance, only in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were phenotypical diªerences established as the markers of identity, signaling biological diªerences that oªered unproblematic signs of intellectual and cultural worth. Even academics who argue that race is a meaningful division of human populations must acknowledge that the signiﬁcance of particular physical traits has altered over time, and that our modern formulation of race is unique to the past three hundred years. Bracken points to four elements of Locke’s doctrines that combine to enable racist thought to ﬂourish: antiessentialism, the tally model for determining (nominal) essences, choice preference of items in the tally, and the blank tablet. Locke began by accepting the Aristotelian position that material objects have a particular substance (an inner con-\n\n32\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nstitution), which might be classiﬁed into sorts or species. But his antiessentialism held that while real substances might potentially exist, human beings have no basis for knowing them. This is because we base our understanding of substance on our sense perception of its external qualities, which are secondary to its “real essence.” Our sense perceptions, unable to uncover a thing’s “real essence,” provide us what Locke termed “nominal essence,” a collection of qualities serving imperfectly for our idea of a substance. As Locke points out, we may take qualities such as the color yellow, shiny appearance, and malleability as the real essence of gold, but we cannot ﬁnd any necessary connection between these qualities and the substance itself. According to Locke, the choice preference with which we ascribe various qualities to gold, or to human beings, is grounded not in substances’ real essences but in our subjective interests. In this context the blank slate, for many liberals an empowering component of Locke’s philosophy, by thwarting eªorts to pin down what is common to all human beings may actually push us to accept racial classiﬁcations rooted in biology. Bracken points out how the Cartesian mind/body dualism, which empiricism displaced, oªered a “modest conceptual barrier” to racist ideologies by separating human identity from external characteristics. Because the Cartesians rooted human identity in thought—with external characteristics such as skin pigmentation and sex merely accidental, and unreﬂective of identity—the Cartesian worldview resisted racial theories grounded in physiognomy. Bracken explores how it is possible in Locke’s empirical philosophy, however, for skin color (and other physical and cultural markers) to become the “essential” human property. It is not that Locke argued for the pertinence of skin color in determining identity (if anything, he argued against it) but that he promoted a philosophical system that, unlike Cartesian thought, did nothing to prevent adherents’ taking pigmentation as an essential attribute of human beings. Locke’s philosophical worldview ultimately made it easier to conclude that human beings were those who were white, rather than those who thought.33 This is not to argue that empiricism necessarily produced race any more than it created democracy, for philosophical systems do not invent social structures, but only provide an ideological ground conducive to their development. Instead of giving birth to race, Locke’s empiricism simply made the acceptance of slavery, and of modern racial theories, more likely. Given Bracken’s care not to attribute the invention of race to either Locke or empiricism, one is left to wonder what led Europeans and European-Americans to embrace racialized patterns of thought from the seventeenth century onward. To say that empiricism laid the foundations for race, by making it a conceptual possibility, is not to explain why race turned into the dominant social structure of the West. To appreciate why European-American culture seized on race, we need to consider what the sociologist Albert Memmi has argued is our inborn tendency to diªerentiate: “Racism is the generalized and ﬁnal assignment of values to real or imaginary diªerences, to the accuser’s\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n33\n\nbeneﬁt and at his victim’s expense, in order to justify the former’s own privileges or aggression.” Despite the utility of racism, Memmi cautions against searching for an overarching logic or consistency to racist discourse, for as he makes clear, racism is driven by something outside itself. He makes the controversial claim that racism is “a lived experience . . . inherent in the human condition [whereby] each time one ﬁnds oneself in contact with an individual or group that is diªerent and only poorly understood, one can react in a way that would signify racism.”34 Memmi contends that we exhibit a universal tendency to articulate diªerences when confronted with an alien group—a tendency heightened when we feel our privileges or well-being threatened. For Memmi, it is the articulation of diªerence, not racism, that is innate to human beings. Merely to observe “diªerences” is not a racist act, but it is rarely a neutral exercise either, for to articulate diªerence would be largely meaningless if it did not illustrate qualitative disparities. According to Memmi, the human predisposition to diªerentiate produces a racist discourse once it combines with interpretations of those diªerences that serve to consolidate or promote the power of a given group. Memmi argues not that our perception of race is grounded in our biological makeup but that a propensity to diªerentiate is hardwired into our systems, and that such a proclivity, in our particular social context, has produced the modern concept of race.35 Locke’s legitimating of an inborn predisposition to evaluate human beings according to observable traits at once weakened the power of innate ideas (which at least potentially could check experiential biases) and helped produce a social and intellectual context in which modern racial theories might ﬂourish. Just as empiricism did not prevent skin color from being taken as a sign of identity, nor did it bar selective prejudices that might appear veriﬁable through “scientiﬁc” analysis. Thus it allowed the invention of modern ideas of race from a diverse array of preexisting biases: religious prejudices, climactic theories of development, belief in the hereditary nature of human traits, ancient predispositions related to physical appearance, anthropomorphism, long-standing xenophobia, and even philological readings of languages as a reﬂection of natural character, all of which inﬂuenced what would be understood as the scientiﬁc discovery of race.36 This Lockean context establishes the antebellum racial conditions out of which the formal qualities of Fair Exchange, No Robbery were born and suggested how the oldfashioned and increasingly marginalized artist may have conceived of his work. Since by the 1870s, when the Herald critic described Fair Exchange, No Robbery for his readers, the empiricist paradigms of Mount’s youth had been largely supplanted by American idealism, my discussion also illuminates the signiﬁcant intellectual foil against which the emergent philosophy rebelled. Having surfaced in America in the 1830s as transcendentalism, idealism attained philosophical dominance in the decades following the Civil War. Called Absolute Idealism and drawn from Hegelian and contemporary British idealist thought, American idealism oªered a pointed critique of empiricism, ﬁnding its route to\n\n34\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nknowledge through experience inadequate because it limited one’s ability to arrive at larger, overarching truths. The idealists argued that all truths (and all that exists) stem from one spiritual reality, which human beings might know. Postbellum Americans embraced a metaphysical system that assured them that a master plan existed at a time when empiricist thought no longer assuaged their doubt. Period Americans were troubled by the human costs associated with industrialization and urbanization; concerned about geological science and Darwinian theories of evolution, which weakened traditional religious beliefs; deeply unsettled by the carnage and destruction of the Civil War. For a nation traumatized by experiential knowledge—overloaded with sensory perceptions and scientiﬁc discoveries that fostered disillusionment and doubt—idealism held out an appealing promise of an ultimate meaning that transcended everyday experience.37 Idealism proªered a compromise. Instead of promoting the outright rejection of experience and science, as many conservative theologians desired, idealism argued that such routes to knowledge were partial, not that they were invalid. As Josiah Royce, America’s most famous proponent of Absolute Idealism, urged in Religious Aspects of Philosophy (1885), “Let us overcome all our di‹culties by declaring that all the many Beyonds, which single signiﬁcant judgements seem vaguely and separately to postulate, are present as fully realized intended objects to the unity of an all-inclusive, absolutely clear, universal, and conscious thought, of which all judgements, true or false, are but fragments, the whole being at once Absolute Truth and Absolute Knowledge.”38 Here, eªectively, was a new religion that appeared compatible with the modern world.39 The triumph of a philosophical system that questioned sensory experience meant the redeﬁnition of racial types, which had been predicated in part on experiential knowledge. Without suggesting that Americans in the aftermath of the Civil War were suddenly unable to judge racial categories according to an individual’s appearance, I contend that the shift away from experiential knowledge unsettled long-standing views of race and then-current racial deﬁnitions. The growing appeal of idealist philosophies prepared the ground for realignments in racial thought at the close of the century. The shifting racial outlook is evident in both the increasingly broad acceptance in the South of the “one-drop rule” as the arbiter of black identity and in the ﬁrst lawsuits various racial minorities brought seeking legal designation as “white” and the consequent conferral of citizenship that status made possible. The consolidation of the one-drop rule in the years following the Civil War is sometimes seen to buttress, rather than diminish, the American tradition of deﬁning race on the basis of physical appearance. After all, the rule undermined a long-standing practice of consigning mulattoes to a separate racial category, neither white nor black. Because the rule stipulated that individuals with even a single black ancestor be classiﬁed as black, light-skinned mulattoes were folded into the black race.40 But just as the rule simpliﬁed racial categorization by reinforcing a white/black division, it also complicated\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\n35\n\nunderstandings of race by downplaying physical diªerences that had long stood as immutable signs of identity. Under the new system it was possible for individuals whose communities categorized them as black to pass as white, just as a portion of those deemed white were unknowingly black. The one-drop rule both built upon and consolidated racial deﬁnitions that transcended physiognomy, leaving whites to fear what came to be known as “invisible blackness.”41 Similarly, the lawsuits ﬁled by racial minorities to gain citizenship during the ﬁnal decades of the nineteenth century must be seen in this context to provide further evidence of the loosening tie between racial categories and physical traits. Although a congressional act of 1790 restricted citizenship to any alien deemed to be a “free white person,” not until 1878—almost ninety years later—did a visible minority ask the courts to declare him white. The legal scholar Ian F. Haney López argues that such court challenges began only in the late 1870s because of the increased importance of national versus state citizenship in the years following passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the concomitant rise in immigration from Asian nations, which produced a critical mass of people who were not obviously white or black.42 But given that a number of early litigants were Hispanic or Native American—two groups that had long boasted signiﬁcant populations in the United States—it seems evident that other factors explain why such lawsuits were attempted only in the ﬁnal decades of the nineteenth century. Even the increased importance of national citizenship at the century’s close does not fully account for the number of such suits. They could not be initiated or proceed to court until a conceptual framework developed to allow for the possibility of non-EuropeanAmericans’ being declared white. If the Fourteenth Amendment and rising Asian immigration encouraged the challenges, the suits were conceivable only after the ﬂuidity of period racial models allowed the consideration of such claims. In the 1870s and 1880s, blacks could be legally black notwithstanding their physical appearance as white, just as Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics could sue for citizenship based on a legal possibility of their being determined white. Although many blacks had been subjected to the one-drop rule over the course of American history, and members of various racial minorities had long agitated for equal rights, the rise of idealism ushered in an ideological context wherein identity models that were only marginally embraced in the antebellum era now rose to dominance. With this picture of shifting racial formation in mind, I turn again to Fair Exchange, No Robbery to ask how its meaning was produced and how the painted and literary scarecrows might have seemed equal to audiences in the 1870s. As we shall see, various strands of external evidence (including the visible discourse of property and the invisible discourses of whiteness and metaphysics) were shaped by the painting’s internal, formal evidence to produce a meaning speciﬁc to this particular visual artifact. Because the sub-\n\n36\n\nGENRE PAINTING AND MODERN RACE\n\nject matter of thousands of pastoral artworks in various media suggested the visible discourses analyzed in this chapter, and because the invisible discourses resided in virtually all Americans of the period, it is essential to consider the unique formal properties of Mount’s painting to have any hope of understanding the contemporaneous responses of gallery audiences. The narrative elements of Mount’s composition are relatively spare. The swap of hats between man and scarecrow takes place in a shallow foreground space blanketed with short grass and scattered weeds. The ﬁgures are bracketed on the right by a small blackand-white dog and on the left by a large cornstalk and stump. The middle distance is bisected horizontally by a rickety picket fence, with missing and broken boards, that separates the ﬁgures from a ﬁeld of ripening corn. Anyone familiar with the art of Mount is likely to place the scene in rural Long Island, where the artist spent his working life, but Gilded Age Americans would have recognized a more precise location based on a common knowledge of fence types—a sort of iconography of enclosure. Americans traditionally used fences to keep animals away from crops and as barriers to contain and exclude human beings, and, just as signiﬁcant, to symbolically demarcate the use of exterior spaces. The type of picket fence illustrated in Mount’s painting was never erected to protect the boundaries of large commercial farms but was placed around houses to signal a domestic space. The standard use of picket fences strongly suggests that the enclosed ﬁeld in Mount’s image was a modest corn patch attached to a private home. As the architectural historian Philip Dole explains, on nineteenth-century American farms “a trinity of fences—rail, horizontal board, picket, one within the other—described three diªerent but concentric zones. Split rails surrounded the distant pastures; board fences bounded barnyards or b"
