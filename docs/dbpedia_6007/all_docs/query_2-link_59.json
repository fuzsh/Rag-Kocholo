Instead of them, the 2nd level administrative units of Armenia are the communities/hamaynq (համայնք). There are 71 of them. Please change regions to communities. The list of communities can be seen on the website of the RA Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure. Link: ՀՀ ՏԿԵՆ | <!-- -->ՀՀ համայնքներ.\n\np.s. I can support and help put communities on the map myself\n\nSincerely Tigran\n\nI think the issue is simply that no one has yet mapped municipal/hamaynq level subdivisions in Armenia. By the way, Municipalities of Armenia - Wikipedia says there are over 500 such municipalities, not 71. Is that correct?\n\nThe regions I saw in Armenia like this one Relation: ‪Թալինի տարածաշրջան‬ (‪10866159‬) | OpenStreetMap are mapped as admin_level=5 which indicates informal level subdivisions of provinces without political powers, which seems correct to me when quickly looking at the Wikipedia page of Armenia.\n\nSo the issue would be that someone needs to map the borders of the 500 municipalities…\n\nOk, so it changed relatively recently, and nobody has yet updated it. Countries with writing systems other than latin often have problems attracting mappers from other parts of the world to finish things since it’s hard for us to interact with existing objects. So it needs somebody local to draw the lines in OSM and then combine them into administrative boundaries.\n\nIf you could get an official map from some source that would allow us the license to import it into OSM that would definitely make things a lot easier because then we would have official coordinates."
