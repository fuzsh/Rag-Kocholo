        "text": "Armenia covers an area of 29,743 sq. km (11,484 sq mi) in Eurasia’s South Caucasus region. It is a landlocked country.\n\nAs observed on the physical map of Armenia above, the topography of the country is very rugged and mountainous. Nearly the entire land is covered by the Lesser (or Little) Caucasus Mountains. The highest point is Mt. Aragats at 13,418 ft. (4,090m). A yellow triangle marks the highest point on the map.\n\nRivers flow fast down through the mountains, and although much of Armenia’s land remains at or above 6,562 ft (2,000 m) at least 3% form the valleys of the Araks and Debet rivers.\n\nLake Sevan is the largest lake and it sits 6,000 ft, (2,000 m) above sea level. Significant rivers include the Aras, Debet and Razdan.\n\nArmenia overview: Flag: Legal Name:Republic of Armenia Capital Value:Yerevan Largest City:\n\nYerevan (1,086,275)\n\nOfficial languages:Armenian Demonym(s):Armenian Government:Unitary parliamentary republic Legislature:National Assembly Total Area:29,743 km² Land Area:28,203 km² Water Area:1,540 km² Population:2,957,731 Density:101.5/km (262.9/sq mi) GDP:$13.67 Billion GDP Per Capita:$4,622.73 Currency Value:Drams (AMD) Driving side:right Calling code:+374 Internet TLD:\n\n.am\n\n.հայ\n\nArmenia is a country situated in both Europe and Western Asia, known for its mountainous terrain and stunning landscapes. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains, or Armenian Highlands, are particularly prominent, and satellite imagery and elevation maps give us a great insight into the area.

The Yerevan province has been granted special administrative status. The provinces are further subdivided into municipal communities.\n\nLocated at the center –west part of the country, along the Hrazdan River is, Yerevan – the capital and largest city of Armenia. It is also the political, cultural and economic center of Armenia.\n\nLocation Maps\n\nWhere is Armenia?\n\nArmenia is a landlocked country situated in the Middle East, though it can also be considered part of Europe geopolitically. Yerevan, the largest city and the capital of Armenia, is surrounded by four countries – Turkey to the east, Azerbaijan to the east, Georgia to the north, and Iran to the south. The Armenia boundary line is one of the most complex in the world today.\n\nThe Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is an exclave of Azerbaijan that borders Armenia to the southwest. Armenia claims two other enclaves within Azerbaijan – Artsvashen and Nagorno–Karabakh. On the other hand, Azerbaijan has four enclaves within Armenia, which are Yukhari Askipara, Yaradullu, Barxudarli, and Karki.\n\nHigh Definition Political Map of Armenia\n\nPhysical Map of Armenia\n\nTransportation Map of Armenia\n\nArmenia Satellite Map"
