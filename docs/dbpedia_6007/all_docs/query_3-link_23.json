        "text": "Yearly % Change: For 2023: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2022 to June 30 2023). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding.\n\nYearly Change: For 2023: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2022 to June 30 2023). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period.\n\nMigrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants.\n\nMedian Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution.\n\nFertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the country, and assuming she is not subject to mortality.\n\nDensity (P/Km²): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km²).\n\nUrban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population.\n\nUrban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country.\n\nCountry's Share of World Pop: Total population in the country as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated.\n\nWorld Population: Total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated."
