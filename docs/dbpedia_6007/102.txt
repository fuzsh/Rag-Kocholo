During the World War I, on May 28, 1918 Armenia became independent as the First Republic of Armenia. However soon Armenian Republic collapsed and in 1920 the nation was conquered by the Soviet Red Army and Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union.

In 1991 when the Soviet Union was dissolved Armenia’s independence was officially recognized and in 2016 Armenians will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Republic of Armenia.

The national flag of Armenia consists of three horizontal bands of equal width. Three succeeding colors of red on the top, blue in the middle and orange on the bottom was adopted on August 24, 1990. On June 15 Armenians celebrate national Flag Day.

The national coat of arms of Armenia consists of an eagle and a lion supporting a shield. Mount Ararat with Noah’s ark on the top is pictured on the shield.
