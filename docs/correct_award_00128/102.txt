An example of Gide's innovative narrative technique can be found in The Counterfeiters, where he uses a multi-perspective narrative structure and inserts a journal within the novel, allowing the reader to engage with the story from multiple viewpoints.

Gide's personal life greatly influenced his literary work.

Key Elements of Gide’s Literary Technique
