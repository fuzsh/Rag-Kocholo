Life

André Gide’s literary homage of freedom from conventions and morals is all about the right of Western individuals to live out their desires and impulses. As portrayed in his literature, this way of life presupposes the oppression of vulnerable groups, such as children and women in poverty, by the privileged class. It is now known that Gide sexually assaulted minors, which he describes in positive terms himself, especially in the book Corydon.

Work

André Gide was a prose writer and literary critic who translated the works of Walt Whitman, William Shakespeare and Rainer Maria Rilke into French. His wrote five collections of poems, eight plays and more than 15 prose works, of which Les Faux Monnayeurs (1926) (The Counterfeiters) stood out as experimental in form because it was a metanovel, which deals with its own creation and the conditions under which it is written.
