The quirky, intimate, and fascinating portrait drawn in these “notes” can be relished by someone who has never read or even heard of Gide. Gide’s friendship with Roger Martin du Gard lasted over thirty-eight years. In his journal, Gide wrote of his friend, “With him I can let myself go and be perfectly natural.”"
