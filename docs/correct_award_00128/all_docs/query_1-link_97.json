It suggests that our perception of truth is influenced by our own emotions, beliefs, and values. Gide highlights the notion that truth cannot simply be black and white, as it is intricately connected to our individual experiences and perspectives. The color of truth, therefore, is intimately linked to the complexities and shades of our hearts, portraying the multifaceted nature of what we perceive as truth. This quote urges us to be aware of our own biases and to seek a deeper understanding of others' hearts in order to find a more comprehensive and empathetic truth.",
