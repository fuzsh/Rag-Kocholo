        "text": "André Gide (1869-1951), winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, produced novels that probe the nature of the human personality, the interaction between psychology and ethics in human behaviour, and the problems that stem from what he called “the rivalry between the real world and the representations we make of it”.\n\nThis project produced a landmark critical edition of Gide’s major novel Les Caves du Vatican, with facsimile images of his manuscripts. It was strongly supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Conseil National des Lettres in Paris and the French Embassy in London. The CD-ROM of the Édition génétique des Caves du Vatican d’André Gide was published in association with Éditions Gallimard, Paris, and contains transcripts and full colour images of all Gide’s working drafts, as well as a genetic and editorial apparatus.\n\nWebsite\n\nÉdition génétique des Caves du Vatican\n\nDownload the data\n\nThe website presented here is the contents of the original published CD-ROM.
