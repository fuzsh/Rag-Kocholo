        "text": "Read\n\nMarch 7, 2016\n\nAndré Gide (1869-1951)\n\nEt tibi magna satis quamvis lapis omnia nudus\n\nLimosoque palus obducat pascua junco. ()\n\n- Virgil, Eclogue I\n\nIn 1895, when Paludes was published,(*) André Gide was a very young man trying to find his own creative voice as well as to overcome the contradictions between his deeply internalized Calvinist upbringing and the powerful urges for sensuality and freedom from external strictures that whorled within him. He had written poetry and had come into close contact with the Symbolists and their hangers-on - most of whom were to be found at Stéphane Mallarmé's Mardis, his weekly social event on Tuesday evening - through his school friend Pierre Louÿs, but after an initial fascination that definitely had an effect on his early publications he had begun to rebel against the inevitable self-satisfaction of any coterie of human beings, not least that of a group of self-congratulatory intellectuals and aesthetes who were spinning their way into some paradise of Platonic Ideals and hypersubtle sensations. And, in any case, all young persons must rebel against their first artistic/intellectual love if they are to find their own creative impulses. This Gide did with a vengeance.\n\nFor Paludes is a satire of just that bunch of intellectuals and aesthetes with whom he had spent so much time since 1891 and from whom he had gained the strength to throw off some of his upbringing. Their poses and tedious, though well-turned jeux d'esprit; the interminable backbiting in order to heighten their own social/intellectual standing; the many ill-intentioned remarks about the inner Paludes meant to undermine the narrator, who was more their competitor than companion; not only does one understand Gide's disgust with those circles but one laughs aloud at his sly portrait. (I did not expect humor from Gide.) But Paludes is more than that; it might be one of the first modernist novels.\n\nBefore we get there, though, one should know that Gide himself divided his fictions into three classes: récits, soties, and just one roman.(**) Paludes was the first of the soties, in which Gide examined somewhat abstractly some (usually) moral problem. The characters were not drawn three-dimensionally but served primarily to illustrate the problem and to bring forth various views of the matter. However, and this is deeply ingrained in Gide's contradictory nature, he usually left the moral problem unresolved after testing it from many sides and points of view, perhaps most famously in his later sotie, L'Immoraliste.\n\nOne should also know that Gide had begun to find his life, both in his mother's world and in the world of the Parisian intellectual, \"suffocating\" and had taken his first lengthy trip to North Africa. When he returned he wrote that he felt like \"Lazarus escaped from the tomb.\" In order to shed part of his old life he scurried away to Switzerland and delivered himself of a light-handed satire whose humor and multiply refracted ironies disguised a just barely banned despair that he later wrote would have driven him to suicide.\n\nPaludes opens with a first person narrator writing - wait for it - Paludes. Don't forget now: this is 1895. But no, it doesn't go there! It is not our Paludes, except insofar as the inner Paludes is written, read and discussed and discussed in our Paludes. Other texts are written and read in our Paludes besides the inner Paludes. Indeed, our text is full of other, inner texts such as the written meditations by our narrator about his friend, Richard, which become stranger and stranger. Actually, much is strange in this text since a generous dollop of the absurd plays a part in Gide's ironies.(***)\n\nBoth the inner Paludes, based upon the above quote from Virgil, and our Paludes semi-seriously examine the question \"can/should one be happy with life's routines?\" and do so with a wide range of approaches. The inner text answers \"yes\", the outer leans towards \"no\". The author himself, though, was destroying most of his routines and used the writing of this multifaceted text to come to terms with it.\n\n() [M. Happy old man, your lands shall then still remain in your possession] and large enough for you. Though naked stones and marsh with slimy rushes overspread all the pasture-grounds...\n\n(*) Available in English translation under the title Marshlands.\n\n(**) The rest he just called divers. Apparently, sotie originally referred to a kind of theater in the 14th and 15th centuries in France in which a burlesque critique of contemporary society and mores was performed by actors called sots.\n\n(***) Add to this passages like the stream-of-consciousness account of a man falling asleep and one has reason to believe that Gide was ahead of his literary time. Just wait until you see the final page. There I emitted the loudest laugh.\n\nOctober 25, 2021\n\nWhat a joy to read this book. I’m not so well versed in metafiction, having only come across it in Borges (not Calvino, not yet). I picked this one up on a whim, and boy am I glad I did so. More metafiction. Maybe I need to explore that section of literature a lot more than I currently do.\n\nThis is the story of a writer working on Marshlands, a story/book/novel/long-form poem that he has been chipping away at for quite a while. Friends and family constantly inquire. How is Marshlands going? Read us a bit from Marshlands! Do you mind committing to this massive undertaking with me today? It’s okay, because you are not busy anyway – you are only working on Marshlands. Ohhhh! I think I understand Marshlands. Hey! Great thought. Maybe you should put that in Marshlands.\n\nThe following is from the first page of the book:\n\nAround five o’clock, it started to get cold outside; I closed my windows and returned to my writing.\n\nAt six o’clock, my dear friend Hubert walked in. He was back from riding school.\n\n“So!” he said. “Hard at work?”\n\n“I am writing Marshlands,” I replied.\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“A book.”\n\n“Will I like it?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Too intellectual?”\n\n“Too boring.”\n\n“Why write it then?”\n\n“If I don’t, who will?”\n\n“I see, more personal confessions.”\n\n“Hardly any.”\n\n“Well, what’s it about then?”\n\nThat’s my elevator pitch for the book. I have attempted to explore my thoughts on the topic before, but this is Gide’s exploration of literary pretension – sometimes satirical, sometimes deeply true. Anyone who has ever thought of writing or is currently in the midst of writing that work that will change the world should take a look at this. Do you resonate? Why? Do you disagree? Why?\n\nFinal quote, because I found it superb:\n\n“Art means depicting a specialized subject with such power that the generality on which it depends can be understood in it. It can only be expressed very badly in abstract terms, because the subject is itself already in abstract thought – but surely you will understand what I’m saying if you consider how a whole enormous landscape passes through a keyhole when your eye gets close enough to the door. Someone who sees nothing but a lock would see the whole world through that lock if only he knew that he needed to bend down. It is enough if one creates the possibility of generalization; it is the reader’s job, the critic’s job, to make the generalization.”\n\nMarch 11, 2022\n\nThis is a delightfully playful and funny satirical novel full of effortlessly pithy remarks. Gide said he wrote it to laugh (with his readers) at it.\n\nIt’s a very modern-feeling story about a writer who’s working on a novel called Marshlands, who takes his art very seriously but is mocked and refuted by his friends and acquaintances, his fellow writers and artists, in the literary establishment.\n\nGide said it’s about a man who doesn’t understand life, “who writhes and worries” because no one gets what he’s doing, and he doesn’t know the answers to the things he can’t get anybody to take seriously. He wants people to chafe against the heartbreaking silliness of life the way he does, with its series of endless repetitions and routines, and the insufferable human need to conform to patterns and box ourselves inside structures.\n\nIt’s all so deftly and lightly done, which is so impressive because there’s a lot going on, there’s a lot of commotion contained in this jewel of a novella.\n\n“But then what are you trying to say?”\n\nGide’s reply: “That’s just my point: one can’t say anything.”\n\nThis is the kind of fluffy brilliance that only the most cunning and supernaturally gifted of writers can produce. Muriel Spark comes to mind. I loved it. I recommend it to all serious readers who love books about books, especially ones that poke fun at themselves.\n\nJanuary 13, 2021\n\n\"Marshlands\" is the best book I read regarding being a writer and writing a book. Beyond that, I love the stylish touch of having the French translated into British English, which reads like a PG Wodehouse narrative. The story is about a writer who is writing a book (\"Marshlands\") about a reclusive fellow who lives in a stone tower by himself. Usually, one thinks of a writer as writing themselves into their narratives. Still, the author is nothing like his character named Tityrus. In fact, his life is totally the opposite of being a recluse and more of a fellow traveler in the world of literary salons. Based on Stéphane Mallarme's series of literary parties, the (grand) author André Gide makes light of these gatherings, but with a British effect due to the translation by Damion Searls, who captures the absurdity of artists not only at work but also at play. \"Marshlands\" plays with the reader's approach of what a novel or novella is, and Gide was in a puckish mood when he wrote this small masterpiece. The dialogue is very campy and artificial. I think Searls did the right thing for English readers by giving it an upper-British accented language.\n\nI believe this is Gide's second novel, and this small volume captures the essence of a writing life, which is also a social one. I think that a writer should never talk about his current project due to what happens to the author in the story. Even before having a manuscript, his fellow authors are commenting on the literary worth of \"Marshlands,\" as well as what they heard through the grapevine. And what he's hearing ain't good!\n\n\"Marshlands\" captures the essence of what we think of an author and how they feel about their work. There are books or writing that appeal to my highly humorous sensibility and expose the absurdity of everyday life. Robert Benchley comes to mind, as well as novels by Albert Cossery. I only know Gide's journals, and of course, his reputation in the French literary world. I suspect that \"Marshlands\" is his funniest book, and I will treasure it among all the great humorists in my library.\n\nFebruary 28, 2021\n\n\"And there you have the subject of my book. Marshlands is the story of an idea, more than of anything else; it is the story of the spiritual malaise that that idea causes. Is an idea an aspect of life? No, it is part of a fever, part of a semblance of life. It is a succubus, feeding on us, while we exist merely to give it life. I could have made any other idea my subject in a book like this, it wouldn't matter.\" (103)\n\nSeptember 5, 2022\n\nThis is autofiction, a form of fictionalized autobiography. Autofiction combines two mutually inconsistent narrative forms, namely autobiography and fiction.\n\nThe protagonist of Marshlands is a writer who is writing a book called Marshlands about a reclusive character who lives in a tower and can fish out of his windows.\n\nThe narrator or protagonist is someone who is the opposite of reclusive, someone who has lots of acquaintances to whom he talks about Marshlands and other people behind the scenes are talking about Marshlands too and tell the narrator what they think about the book.\n\nEven the reader can write part of the book by adding to the table of remarkable sentences on Page 88, making each reader's version of the book unique. Isn't that the idea, that each reader completes the book they're reading almost always in a different way?\n\nJune 9, 2021\n\nHow blest is thy old age! thou hast the fields\n\nThat meet thy wants, albeit the pastures all\n\nAre covered with bare stones, or marsh-grown reeds.\n\nVirgílio\n\n—⁠His flaws? Just one is enough: He prefers the better to the good.\n\nAndré Gide\n\nO narrador deplora a sua mediocridade e os que a suportam melhor do que ele. Tityrus é a personagem que ele encontra em Virgílio e em todo lado. Tityrus aceita; o narrador, outro Tityrus, rejeita. O narrador escreve um livro, e nós lemos um livro sobre a escrita dum livro. E a narrativa continua de Tityrus em Tityrus.\n\nO livro é tão inverosímil, tão cheio de nada, que até parece a vida real.\n\nI have a very active temperament; it’s the equipment that gets on my nerves . . .\n\nJanuary 16, 2021\n\nAndre Žid: „Močvare“\n\nAndre Žid – satiričar? Je li to moguće? (Moguć je i kolač u tiganju, a i pogodak u zadnjim sekundima utakmice, pa zašto ne bismo mogli da zamislimo Žida kao satiričara...) Štaviše, njegove „Močvare“ korespondiraju sa nama poznatijim delom – pričom „Mrtvo more“ Radoja Domanovića. Ali, „Močvare“ uz to imaju i nešto od kafkijanske atmosfere, tako da glavnog junaka nije teško zamisliti kao Kafku. Ako bismo iz pripovetke pokušali da odstranimo Židov prepoznatljivi stil (u kome, pored ostalog, veliki broj poetizovanih rečenica nosi jednu vrstu specifičnog nepatetičnog zanosa), i ako bismo pritom pokušali da zamislimo čitavu priču kao niz stripovanih slika – smeteni junak-spisatelj sasvim lepo bi mogao da nosi crte omiljenog češkog pisca.\n\nSvoju glavnu ideju Žid nam prikazuje na posredan način. Umesto da jednostavno piše svoju pripovetku, on uvodi naratora – pisca koji objašnjava šta mu se dešava od dana kad započinje pisanje „Močvara“. Tako ga na samom početku upoznajemo kao nekog ko na pitanje – šta radiš? (često mu se to postavlja na različite načine), odgovara – pišem „Močvare“. Neki to smatraju radom, neki naprotiv omalovažavaju taj trud i podrazumevaju da taj odgovor znači – ne radim ništa. Prijateljica koja se često pominje – Anžel – pravi poređenje između njega i zajedničkog prijatelja Ibera (u korist ovog drugog) pokazujući šta sve čovek može da radi, kad reši da radi (počevši od jahanja, pa do učestvovanja u poslovnim i dobrotvornim aktivnostima). Nabrajanje Iberovih aktivnosti je karikirano isto onoliko koliko je ismejan i zaneseni pisac (a i čitava književna zajednica, okupljena jedne večeri u Anželinom tesnom i zagušljivom salonu). Pisac neprekidno propagira promene, izlazak iz umrtvljujuće čamotinje močvarnog polja, propagira gledanje nasuprot ljudskom slepilu koje misli da pronalazi u svom okruženju, ljuteći se na sve oko sebe što ne shvataju šta im govori. Da bi ilustrovao svoje zamisli, uvodi u „Močvare“ lik Titira (ime je preuzeto iz Vergilijevog dela). Titir poseduje močvarno polje, puno kamenja i baruština, i srećan je što je zadovoljan na tom polju. (Ovo dupliranje je, naravno, namerno. Biti srećan zato što si srećan – zvuči pomalo čudno, ali upravo o tome se radi. Imati Titirovo polje, imati močvaru, biti zadovoljan svojom močvarom, i biti srećan što si zadovoljan svojom blatnjavom poljanom, na kojoj se prehranjuješ lovom na divlje patke dok ti i to ne zabrane i ne ubede te da moraš jesti blatne crve...) U svom okruženju narator-pisac pronalazi i ljude koji mu naročito liče na izmišljenog Titira. Jedan od njih je Rišar – normalan i moralan čovek. On nema šta da zameri Rišaru, poštuje ga, a Rišar njega još i više. Ipak, oni vode različite živote, s tom razlikom što je Rišar svojim životom zadovoljan, a pisac upravo zato ne želi to da bude, smatrajući da takvom životu nedostaju stvarni događaji. On zapravo ni sam nije postigao ono što drugima propoveda, ali za razliku od Titira/ Rišara koji je srećan što je zadovoljan, pisac je zadovoljan što nije srećan. (Takva vrsta izvrtanja i karikiranih filozofskih rasprava naročito je prisutna u delu pripovesti gde se pisci i filozofi susreću. Prijem kod Anžel je vrhunac pripovetke u tom smislu, i tu je Žid satiričar najbolje pokazao da može sasvim lepo da se okuša u tom žanru.\n\nTitir je tip čoveka koji ne može da putuje. On i njemu slični, iako su zatvoreni, veruju da su napolju, zato i ne pokušavaju da nađu neki izlaz. Pisac nije revolucionar – on želi da se ljudi pobune u sebi. Gledajući ventilator u Anželinoj sobi, kaže – ništa me tako ne razdražuje kao nešto što se vrti na mestu. Čovek sebe može videti samo kad je nesrećan - tvrdi on. Ponovo se i ovde ponavlja vapaj da se više živi. Ali ne, ljudi oko njega traže tipičan jelovnik. Životinje koje žive u pećinama gube vid zato što ga ne koriste, upozorava on svoje sagovornike (i eto Platona gde ga nismo očekivali!). Dok on traži velika dela, književnici sa kojima priča veličaju suprotno – ne velika dela već odgovornost za ona mala, svakodnevna činjenja. Kolebamo se gde je tu nihilizam – u njegovom negiranju vrednosti koje je uspostavio „normalan čovek“, ili u životu „malih ljudi“ koji počiva na pećini, ponavljanjima, tipičnom jelovniku, krovu nad glavom koji štiti ali i zarobljava... Takav kakav jeste, narator-pisac ne primećuje da je Anžel željna i spremna na to da njihov odnos preraste u nešto više (tu se ponovo susrećemo sa jednom od omiljenih Židovih tema – temom nerealizovanog odnosa, jer jedna strana bira drugi put: put vere, put kontemplacije ili put stvaralaštva).\n\nCeo svet je duhovna provincija. Svuda gde ima više ljudi na jednom mestu nastaje duhovna provincija. Ogleda se u patetičnom i žalosnom skretanju pažnje na sebe, u dvostrukim aršinima pri procenjivanju svojih i tuđih potreba, u nemogućnosti da se preraste ta bolećivost i sebičnost bez obzira na godine i stepen obrazovanja. Odlikuju je i zavirivanje u tuđu čorbu, sakrivanje problema u sopstvenoj kući, prenošenje tračeva, licemerje, osuđivanje bilo kakve različitosti i ruganje kao jedno od najvažnijih oružja protiv svake drugosti. Strah od osude drži većinu u pokornosti, lakše nego što to čine zakoni. Ko je spreman da se menja, da propituje važeće standarde, da radi stvari drugačije, makar i na korist zajednice a na sopstvenu štetu, biće na udaru javnosti upravo kao predmet straha od bilo kakvih promena. Takva zajednica ima nekrofilski karakter – može da voli samo ono što je mrtvo; zato ubija živost u svojim naraštajima proglašavajući živost, strast i nemir bolesnim stanjem. Tako nastaje mrtvo more, tako se polje pretvara u Titirovo polje, u močvaru. Često sve to služi samo manipulaciji nad grupom; nju prepoznaju i koriste najveštiji, oni instinktivni, rođeni manipulanti koji su bolećivost prema sebi uzdigli na stepen životnog zadatka. Izlazak iz toga je moguć samo tako da čovek, kao pojedinac, pokuša da prevaziđe sva ograničenja koja dovode njegov duh u to provincijsko stanje. Nikad nema dovoljno takvih pojedinaca na istom mestu da bi se moglo govoriti o zajednici koja nije podlegla tome.\n\nČak i zajednica od svega dvoje ljudi, pa i takvih da su duhovne \"gromade\", izgrađene celoživotnim bavljenjem isključivo stvarima duha, podleže jednakim nepisanim pravilima svih ostalih zajednica – kreće poređenje, ljubomora, nametanje moći, strah od prekida zajednice, nesigurnost u sebe i onog drugog. Iz takvih se stvari često rađaju porivi i aktivnosti koji nikako ne idu uz čoveka koji je ostvaren kao stvaralac u nekoj duhovnoj oblasti.\n\nI to je jedan od najvažnijih razloga zbog kojih se \"ljudi od duha\" povlače u samoću. Osećaju da zajednica prosto nosi sa sobom nešto od tih nedostojanstvenih primesa i da se tome niko ne može odupreti (jer je čovek, jer to ide uz ljudsko biće).\n\nDa li to znači da sam protiv zajednica?\n\nO, ne... Postupak o kome govorim mogao bi se nazvati obračunom sa provincijom u sebi, uz nužno priznavanje da je provincijalizam upisan u čovekov genetski, prirodni kod, i da se ta bitka ne dobija (proces se ne završava, mada može otpočeti) pukim premeštanjem u prostoru, preseljenjem, klasičnim školskim obrazovanjem, ni usvajanjem određenih manira. Jedna od najčešćih malograđanskih zabluda je verovanje da je provincija negde drugde.\n\nDa li je Žid protiv zajednica? One su, svakako, prolazne. Ne, nije ni on. Njegovo delo (ne samo “Močvare”, nego sve što sam pročitala) tuguje nad neostvarenim zajednicama u kojima bi možda moglo da se pokuša da se “više živi”. Ljubav je jedini garant, ali ljubav dovoljno velika da istera blatne crve i mrtvo more iz ljudskih duša, i da neki događaj učini stvarnim. Ljubav koja poništava vreme, ukida ponavljanja, suprotstavlja se navici, menja čoveka i razvija ga na takav način da iz njegovog života ne nestaju ni strasti ni nemiri. Možda je prvi korak – prevazilaženje straha.\n\nIako satira, ovo delo nije obojeno jeftinim epizodama plitkog humora: ono je nalik na druga Židova dela, britko, inteligentno, poetizovano, prožeto citatima, aluzivno, sa neobičnim ali čitljivim simbolima na pravim mestima. Sami pasusi iz nedovršenog dela “Močvare” odišu posebnom atmosferom, a to što su okruženi naracijom, dijalozima i kafkijanskim epizodama iz piščevog života, majstorski je komponovano u pripovetku velike zanimljivosti i nesumnjivog književnog kvaliteta.\n\nJune 29, 2019\n\nUne nouvelle qui prend pour thème principal l'histoire d'une création littéraire. C'est un récit qui montre l'entrée dans la vie d'un auteur qui peine à organiser son temps, se bute aux moments quand il doit expliquer ce qu'il est en train d'écrire aux autres et qui cherche à trouver sa voix malgré les distorsions qui en découlent. Intéressant, mais moins captivant que les deux autres nouvelles que j'ai lu du même auteur. Je me réjouis déjà à découvrir tout ses autres livres qui m'attendent encore!\n\nNovember 12, 2019\n\nRecensie door Roosje\n\nUitgeverij Vleugels\n\nZonder titel*\n\nWe volgen gedurende zes dagen een man zonder naam, een ik-personage, tijdens zijn leven en het schrijven van zijn literaire stuk, dat de volgende titel draagt: Moerassen**. We volgen hem in zijn dagelijkse doen, in de struggle zouden we nu zeggen van de urban jungle van zijn agenda, verplichtingen, sociale bezoekjes van vrienden - bijvoorbeeld van best friend Hubert -, andere literatoren op letterkundige avondjes, van zijn bff - hij slaapt bij haar maar niet met haar; hiermee geeft hij indirect te kennen niet hetero te zijn; de bff heet Angèle -, van een reisje, van het schrijven en afronden (?, dat is nog maar de vraag) van zijn boek Moerassen.\n\nHet boek is nog net in de 19e eeuw geschreven maar doet direct erg modern aan. Vanaf de eerste woorden weet je als lezer dat dit geen gewone roman is die je leest, of een autobio, of een toneelstuk, of poëzie, terwijl alle genres in dit boek voorkomen. Bovendien krijgt de naamloze schrijver geen naam, is zijn werk misschien een écriture automatique? Dat is het ook niet helemaal. Het boek is een mengelmoes van dagboek, roman, autobiografie, toneelstuk en poëzie.\n\nIk dacht aanvankelijk: dit is een roman met sterke autobio-kenmerken.\n\nWat natuurlijk ook direct opvalt - en daar is Gide heel expliciet in - is dat dit boek zowel het schrijfproces toont van het boek en tegelijk het onderwerp ervan is. Een boek over het schrijven van een boek; en dat boek heeft sterkte autobiografische én algemeen-menselijke trekken; het is bedoeld als een egodocument én als platform voor filosofische en literair-theoretische uiteenzettingen.\n\nDat doet allemaal erg zwaar aan, maar zo schrijft Gide helemaal niet. Hij schrijft met grote luim en ironie, maar ook met grote ernst en aandacht voor de algemeen menselijke zwaarmoedigheid en diens existentiële twijfel..\n\nVoor de zekerheid expliciteert Gide ons helemaal voorin zijn boek:\n\n‘Ik wacht met het uitleggen van mijn boek tot anderen het mij uitleggen. Het eerst te willen uitleggen maakt dat je al meteen de betekenis ervan beperkt; want we mogen dan wel weten wat we te zeggen hebben, we weten niet of dat ook het enige is wat we zeggen…’ (2019: 11)\n\nWij lezers worden expliciet uitgenodigd een duit in Gides zakje te doen. Echter, wat blijkt in het verloop van het boek? Die lezers zijn blijkbaar niet de contemporaine ‘letterkundigen’, die op een cultureel avondje bij vriendin Angèle, hem alsmaar over Moerassen (onder)vragen en hem aan een filosofische en literair kruisvuur lijken te onderwerpen. Tenminste, zo ervaart de ‘Schrijver’, een enkele keer ‘het Schrijvertje’ genoemd, het. Hij krijgt het acuut benauwd ondanks de ventilator die Angèle heeft laten aanbrengen, en hij moet weg.\n\nMoralist Barnabé zegt - in parafrase -: u wilt de mensen dwingen tot handelen, want u hebt een afkeer van stilstand, maar de daden moeten uit henzelf voortkomen. (ib.: 63).\n\nGaléas zegt - nog steeds in parafrase -: je geneest een zieke niet door op zijn ziekte te wijzen, maar te tonen wat gezond is. (ib.: 64).\n\nDe ‘grote’ dichter Valentin Knox (ongetwijfeld ironisch bedoeld, rdv): gezondheid is geen belangrijk goed, het is slechts de middelmaat van alles. Ziekte is juist geen gebrek maar zij heeft een meerwaarde: een gebochelde is een mens plus een bochel. (ib.: 64-65). Kijk eens bij Vergilius, waar Tityrus de normale mens vertegenwoordigt: ’…het is de mens die niet tegelijk met ons sterft en die leeft met hulp van ieder van ons.’ (ib.: 66) Die uitspraak is natuurlijk hellemaal tegen het verkeerde been. Die Tityrus van Vergilius is juist de hoofdpersoon in het boek van de Schrijver. Die Tityrus staat symbool, of is een metafoor voor, De Tevreden Mens; de mens die zijn moerassige land beziet en er gelukkig mee is. Natuurlijk is er veel beter en vruchtbaarder grond denkbaar, grond die je kunt bewerken en waar je geen koorts (malaria!) oploopt, maar het is zíjn land en hij doet het ermee.\n\nDe Schrijver zou graag een Tityrus zijn en vol tevredenheid neerliggen - Tityrus recubans bij Vergilius - maar zo is hij niet. Het platteland en de buitenlucht doen niets voor hem, integendeel. Na het literaire avondje van Angèle is hij totaal van de kaart. In bed heeft hij de meest uiteenlopende, maar in ieder geval vreselijke gedachten, die langzaam overgaan in een afschrikwekkende toestand van illusoire beelden in de overgangsfase van waken naar slapen, om natuurlijk uit te monden in een onontkoombare nachtmerrie, waaruit hij angstzwetend ontwaakt en volkomen in de put en uitgeput is. Hij stelt niets voor als schrijver, etc etc.\n\nToch, een enkele keer kijk hij uit het raam - het raam van Angèle - en mompelt: ‘Het leven, het leven van anderen! Dat, het leven! Het leven zien! Wat het toch is te leven!’ (ib.: 93) Een uitspraak die iets van vitalisme heeft, maar dat kan direct weer omslaan in diepe wanhoop en afkeer van datzelfde ‘Leven!’.\n\nEen reisje met Angèle moet uitkomst brengen. De Schrijver zoekt het platteland om ruim te kunnen ademen. Het reisje bekomt hun slecht. Niet zozeer de bestemming is van belang, zo beweert de ik, met élan, maar het vertrek. Hoe dan ook, het miezert zowat de hele dag en Angèle heeft slechts haar parasol meegebracht en haar paraplu thuisgelaten. In een donkere schuur wachten zij tot het weer opklaart.\n\nHij houdt een agenda bij maar kijkt er zelden in. Hij schrijft zaken op om ze niet te hoeven herhalen, zoals hij ook voortdurende losse blaadjes volschrijft met invallen en poëtische oneliners. Zijn agenda corrigeert hij ook net zo makkelijk weer. Zo staat er op een dag: proberen om 6 uur op te staan - dat noteert hij vrijwel iedere dag. Dan wordt hij op een dag om 8 uur wakker en voelt zich ziek; dan streept hij 6 uur door en vervangt dat door 11 uur.\n\nIronie en ernst, tegenstellingen, eigen observatie en de mening van anderen, als ook de omstandigheid dat het verhaal niet verloopt langs causale lijnen, maken dit boek en dit verhaal, dat eveneens het scheppingsverhaal van het boek is maar, tot een meerlagig avontuur, met absurdistische trekken, waarin het uitstekend past dat het boek niet maar bij één genre is onder te brengen. Woordspelig als in ironische stukken; woordspelig als in poëzie. De structuur is heerlijk circulair; het eindigt ongeveer zoals het begon, behalve dat Hubert vervangen is door Gaspard en Moerassen door Polders. Over Polders werd eerder opgemerkt dat hij dat maar eens wilde voltooien. Of Moerassen nu einde gekregen heeft? Ja zeker, en wel dit:\n\n‘Om zes uur kwam mijn trouwe vriend Gaspard.\n\nHij kwam van het schermen. Hij zei: ‘Hé! Zit je te werken?’\n\nIk antwoordde: ‘Ik schrijf Polders…’\n\n(ib.: 114)\n\nHulde aan de uitgever Vleugels die dit boek opnieuw heeft uitgegeven.\n\n* Omdat Gide zijn boek geen eenduidig genre geeft, besluit ik maar net zo (?) tegendraads mijn stukje geen titel te geven, als was het een modern abstract schilderij (I wish…).\n\nIn het Frans Paludes, een archaïsche benaming die nog slechts voorkomt in de medische term paludisme = malaria. Paludes verwijst naar het Latijn - palus, paludis - van met name Vergilius, die prominent in Gides tekst voorkomt. Verder zijn er connotaties met ludes = spel; pa-lude (fonetisch voor pas lude) = zonder spel: spel en ernst, hetgeen slaat op de toon van Gides tekst. Het spelen met woorden, hun vorm en betekenis is van belang in deze tekst en wijst al vooruit op het absurdisme als van dada (mijn opvatting, rdv; lees ook nawoord van vertaalster Hannie Vermeer-Pardoen).\n\n*** Automatisch schrijven (ook wel écriture automatique genoemd) is het schrijven zonder vooropgezet idee, met het doel de tekst te gebruiken voor een literair doel.\n\nLiterair gezien kan automatisch schrijven worden vergeleken met improviseren. De auteur schrijft wat in hem opkomt, ongeacht of het syntactisch juist is of niet. Het idee is dat men zo het onbewuste aanspreekt en op die manier tot nieuwe en onverwachte teksten kan komen, die evenwel qua idee dicht bij de opsteller liggen. De ontstane teksten worden vaak (niet per se) verwerkt tot poëzie, waarna ze dikwijls geredigeerd worden. Auteurs die automatisch schrijven toepasten zijn: André Breton, Louis Aragon en Guillaume Apollinaire.\n\nAutomatisch schrijven wordt wel een surrealistische techniek genoemd omdat deze voor het eerst doelbewust werd toegepast bij Dada en het surrealisme.\n\n(Bron: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automat...)\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\n4.36. Bazı yazarlar var teknikleriyle, üslubuyla, kurgusuyla etkiliyor ve yazacağa \"hey sen, dur, önce oku\" diyor. Aklımdan geçeni uygulamış Gide. Gide gele bunu yazmış. Tebrik.\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nThis short book, published by Gide in 1895, revolves around a clique of writers and intellectuals in fin-de-siecle Paris. The unnamed narrator is writing a book called \"Marshlands.\" It tells the tale of a certian Tityrus, who lives in a tower by a marsh, fishes out a window, and does nothing. The narrator quotes passages from his book to Angela, his quasi-girlfriend (he sleeps in her apartment but not in her bedroom, and the one time she indirectly but unmistakably offers sex, he finds a way to put her off), his best friend Hubert (whom he seems to suspect might be sleeping with Angela), and various other figures he meets at a party, on the street, and in his apartment.\n\nThe narrator may seem a poseur, but he's in fact a published writer (his friends all tell him they've heard his latest book is excellent, though none has read it). He regulates his life by a planner; he rarely actually does what he's planned. By the end, after various encounters, conversations, and a failed little day-trip with Angela, he declares \"Marshalnds\" finished and has begun the sequel: \"Polderlands.\"\n\nIn an afterword to the second edition, reprinted here along with some other material, Gide says the book is about \"an idea\" and the way that an idea gets into you like a parasite and grows in your brain. \"Anyone who thinks he sees something dull and ordinary in the world,\" Gide adds, \"is wrong: there is nothing the least bit dull and ordinary in it\" (104), and that's another theme of \"Marshlands\" -- the narrator's life may appear boring and dull -- and he declares \"Marshlands\" boring more than once to a friend -- but actually all the incidents of his life as related here are completely engaging. There's a touch of Proust or Joyce in this short novel.\n\nThe new translation by Damion Searls is excellent: the language is colloquial, sounding like the way people speak, but full of depth and polish. There's a lot of humor here, and it comes across subtly but unmistakably (like Angela's failed effort at seduction).\n\n\"Marshlands\" is one of Gide's early masterpieces.\n\nJuly 20, 2017\n\n1895'te yazılmış bir kitap için epey sıkı numaralar içeriyor: Her şeyden önce, Batak adlı bu romanda, Batak adlı bir roman yazan bir yazar var, ama onun yazdığı Batak, bizim o anda okuduğumuz Batak değil; diğer yandan, onun romanı için aldığı notlar da bizim okuduğumuz romana dahil oluyor. Kahramanımız olan yazarın, çevresindeki herkes ve her şey hakkında ha bire not almak, günlük tutmak, berbat şiirler yazmak, durmadan plan yapmak ama başladığı hiçbir şeyi bitirememek gibi huyları var. Ve bir de bitmeyen can sıkıntısı. Okuduğumuz kitabın içinde, onun yazdığı her şey birbirine karışıyor ve buna bir de edebiyatçı ve estet arkadaşlarıyla yaptığı aforizmatik sohbetler ekleniyor. Sonuçta, kısa ama dopdolu bir yergi ortaya çıkıyor.\n\nJuly 19, 2022\n\nGide fucking around. The protagonist is writing a book called Marshlands. Yep. Camel, eye of needle. Still fun, if largely unremarkable.\n\nJanuary 24, 2021\n\n“I draw up from my daily planner the sentiment of duty: I write in it a week in advance, so that I have time to forget what I wrote; surprises are always lying in wait, which are indispensable, given my way of life. I go to sleep every night facing a day to come that is unknown and nonetheless predetermined by me.”\n\nAn early work by Gide, Marshlands is a comedy about the late-19th-century equivalent of an “artistic” hipster / poseur. Not a fop—which would require an obsession with fashion and bon mots, neither in evidence here—the narrator does however socialize daily, much to the detriment of his time spent writing—largely a banal one- or two-paragraph observation he manages to come up with every few days.\n\nHe is writing a book called Marshlands, featuring a protagonist named Tityrus, his alter ego. But what Marshlands is / will be about changes by the moment. At least we have hints of what he intends to be in it, by both the lists he makes about what it should describe and what it actually does describe. Although the narrator reacts with exasperation when his friends, after hearing or telling an anecdote, tell him “You should put that in Marshlands,” he does put it in Marshlands because we’re reading it. And although the notes from Marshlands he shows tend to be silly or trite, his writing as the narrator of the book we’re reading is better than that of the book he’s writing.\n\nJanuary 27, 2021\n\nthis book fucks\n\nStarting to get more into Gide, although this isn't necessarily representative of his oeuvre at large, but rather maybe an aberration. Although, this book seems more popular among writers, as the preface by Dubravka Ugresic and the faithful translation by Damion Searls attests.\n\nMuch more about the strangeness of books, the almost uncanny element of writing that sometimes runs counter to daily life. Unlike our habits, writing a book (which may of course become a habit itself) seems suspect, seems to want to transcend something higher. Or at least thats the perceptions of others. IDK IDK just a weird ass book that keeps referring to its own materiality as a book, a feverish and maybe damned project that also in the end is just a bunch of pages taped together.\n\nApril 20, 2022\n\n“Marshlands,” I began, “is the story of neutral ground, that which belongs to us all . . . or better: the terrain of the normal person, the place where we all begin—the story of the third person, about whom one speaks—who lives in us all, who does not die with us. In Virgil, he is called Tityrus. And Virgil explicitly says he is lying down—‘Tityre recubans.’* Marshlands is the story of Man Lying Down.”\n\nThis is an early work that predates modern metafiction; probably one of its earliest examples. For Marshlands was finished in late 1894 and published in the spring of 1895. It is also one of Gide's earliest works. This is one of those books about writing a book that never engaged my interest throughout the reading of this novel. It is far too experimental when compared to Gide's later works and far too short for a complete appreciation of the literary devices involved in its writing. This is a narrative about a writer writing 'Marshlands' which involves a recluse living all alone in a stone tower. The narrator of the novel is, however, the exact opposite of the reclusive character and is one who moves exclusively among the Parisian literary world populated by characters who become acquainted with the fact of writing the book and their reactions to it. And this is what comprises the core of this brief work of fiction.\n\nElsewhere the narrator replies to a question:\n\n“Once you take up an idea, you have to carry it through to the end.” —⁠And there you have the subject of my book. Marshlands is the story of an idea, more than of anything else; it is the story of the spiritual malaise that that idea causes. Is an idea an aspect of life? No, it is part of a fever, part of a semblance of life. It is a succubus, feeding on us, while we exist merely to give it life. I could have made any other idea my subject in a book like this, it wouldn’t matter.\n\nAnd probably this sums up the purpose of this work in a nutshell (although I am not entirely convinced).\n\nFinally the last lines of this work lays ample testimony to the need of the characters involved in this work- a stark social statement which is probably intended as a satire:\n\nLet me add one more thing: Marshlands is the story of someone who does not understand life, who writhes and worries for having believed in anything except the one thing needful.\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nMarshlands\n\nBy Andre Gide 🇫🇷(Nobel prize in literature)\n\nTranslated from French by Damion Searls\n\nPreface by Dubravka Ugresic\n\nTo put this unknown author into context, Gide was a friend of Oscar wilde. They did a lot of misdeeds together.\n\nThis book is about nothing(as perceived by many, act of writing a book as doing nothing), where many things happen but nothing really happens, it's circular by design.\n\nThis book is about a writer and a book and the process of it being a book, there’s nothing more, nothing less. It’s a book about an unnamed writer who is trying to write a book called Marshlands and talks about the book with his friends and in a literary circle where nobody understands what he is trying to say by writing the book.\n\nIsn’t it always the case, its your book/poetry/art/music untill you’re creating it, when it is finished, when it is percieved by others, its not yours anymore.\n\nIt’s a satire to literary culture, the meditation of writing a book and how it is perceived by the ones who are not writing. Writer/non-writer conflict.\n\n“So!” he said. “Hard at work?”\n\n“I am writing Marshlands,” I replied.\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“A book.”\n\n“Will I like it?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Too intellectual?”\n\n“Too boring.”\n\n“Why write it then?”\n\n“If I don’t, who will?”\n\n“I see, more personal confessions.”\n\n“Hardly any.”\n\n“Well what’s it about then?”\n\n“so, hard at work?” Implying nothingness of the act of writing by the non-writers while it is the only thing the writer is pulled to do “If I don’t, who will?”\n\nIt’s metafiction, its autofiction…..\n\n“But Marshland is more than that” - Ugresic said, and I believed, Marshland is more than that.\n\n—— “Literature as seduction” ——\n\nShelved as 'tasted'\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nThe best thing about this edition of a dull, pre-post-modern satire is Dubravka Ugrešić’s preface.

We volgen hem in zijn dagelijkse doen, in de struggle zouden we nu zeggen van de urban jungle van zijn agenda, verplichtingen, sociale bezoekjes van vrienden - bijvoorbeeld van best friend Hubert -, andere literatoren op letterkundige avondjes, van zijn bff - hij slaapt bij haar maar niet met haar; hiermee geeft hij indirect te kennen niet hetero te zijn; de bff heet Angèle -, van een reisje, van het schrijven en afronden (?, dat is nog maar de vraag) van zijn boek Moerassen.\n\nHet boek is nog net in de 19e eeuw geschreven maar doet direct erg modern aan.

Echter, wat blijkt in het verloop van het boek? Die lezers zijn blijkbaar niet de contemporaine ‘letterkundigen’, die op een cultureel avondje bij vriendin Angèle, hem alsmaar over Moerassen (onder)vragen en hem aan een filosofische en literair kruisvuur lijken te onderwerpen. Tenminste, zo ervaart de ‘Schrijver’, een enkele keer ‘het Schrijvertje’ genoemd, het.

(ib.: 63).\n\nGaléas zegt - nog steeds in parafrase -: je geneest een zieke niet door op zijn ziekte te wijzen, maar te tonen wat gezond is.

Ziekte is juist geen gebrek maar zij heeft een meerwaarde: een gebochelde is een mens plus een bochel. (ib.: 64-65). Kijk eens bij Vergilius, waar Tityrus de normale mens vertegenwoordigt: ’…het is de mens die niet tegelijk met ons sterft en die leeft met hulp van ieder van ons.’ (ib.: 66) Die uitspraak is natuurlijk hellemaal tegen het verkeerde been.

Hij schrijft zaken op om ze niet te hoeven herhalen, zoals hij ook voortdurende losse blaadjes volschrijft met invallen en poëtische oneliners. Zijn agenda corrigeert hij ook net zo makkelijk weer. Zo staat er op een dag: proberen om 6 uur op te staan - dat noteert hij vrijwel iedere dag. Dan wordt hij op een dag om 8 uur wakker en voelt zich ziek; dan streept hij 6 uur door en vervangt dat door 11 uur.\n\nIronie en ernst, tegenstellingen, eigen observatie en de mening van anderen, als ook de omstandigheid dat het verhaal niet verloopt langs causale lijnen, maken dit boek en dit verhaal, dat eveneens het scheppingsverhaal van het boek is maar, tot een meerlagig avontuur, met absurdistische trekken, waarin het uitstekend past dat het boek niet maar bij één genre is onder te brengen. Woordspelig als in ironische stukken; woordspelig als in poëzie. De structuur is heerlijk circulair; het eindigt ongeveer zoals het begon, behalve dat Hubert vervangen is door Gaspard en Moerassen door Polders. Over Polders werd eerder opgemerkt dat hij dat maar eens wilde voltooien. Of Moerassen nu einde gekregen heeft? Ja zeker, en wel dit:\n\n‘Om zes uur kwam mijn trouwe vriend Gaspard.\n\nHij kwam van het schermen. Hij zei: ‘Hé! Zit je te werken?’\n\nIk antwoordde: ‘Ik schrijf Polders…’ (ib.: 114)\n\nHulde aan uitgever Vleugels die dit boek opnieuw heeft uitgegeven.\n\n* Omdat Gide zijn boek geen eenduidig genre geeft, besluit ik maar net zo (?) tegendraads mijn stukje geen titel te geven, als was het een modern abstract schilderij (I wish…).\n\nIn het Frans Paludes, een archaïsche benaming die nog slechts voorkomt in de medische term paludisme = malaria. Paludes verwijst naar het Latijn - palus, paludis - van met name Vergilius, die prominent in Gides tekst voorkomt. Verder zijn er connotaties met ludes = spel; pa-lude (fonetisch voor pas lude) = zonder spel: spel en ernst, hetgeen slaat op de toon van Gides tekst. Het spelen met woorden, hun vorm en betekenis is van belang in deze tekst en wijst al vooruit op het absurdisme als van dada (mijn opvatting, rdv; lees ook nawoord van vertaalster Hannie Vermeer-Pardoen).\n\n*** Automatisch schrijven (ook wel écriture automatique genoemd) is het schrijven zonder vooropgezet idee, met het doel de tekst te gebruiken voor een literair doel.\n\nLiterair gezien kan automatisch schrijven worden vergeleken met improviseren. De auteur schrijft wat in hem opkomt, ongeacht of het syntactisch juist is of niet. Het idee is dat men zo het onbewuste aanspreekt en op die manier tot nieuwe en onverwachte teksten kan komen, die evenwel qua idee dicht bij de opsteller liggen. De ontstane teksten worden vaak (niet per se) verwerkt tot poëzie, waarna ze dikwijls geredigeerd worden. Auteurs die automatisch schrijven toepasten zijn: André Breton, Louis Aragon en Guillaume Apollinaire.\n\nAutomatisch schrijven wordt wel een surrealistische techniek genoemd omdat deze voor het eerst doelbewust werd toegepast bij Dada en het surrealisme. (bron: Wikipedia)\n\nOver de auteur:\n\nAndré Paul Guillaume Gide (Parijs, 22 november 1869 – aldaar, 19 februari 1951) was een Frans schrijver en winnaar van de Nobelprijs voor Literatuur in 1947.\n\nBiografie\n\nGide was de zoon van een protestantse vader uit de Midi en een uit een katholieke familie afkomstige maar tot het protestantisme bekeerde moeder uit Normandië. Hij was een van de belangrijkste schrijvers van zijn generatie.\n\nDe streng protestantse opvoeding door zijn moeder heeft hem schuldgevoelens en frustraties opgeleverd als jongeman. Ook zijn nicht Madeleine Rondeaux, met wie hij opgroeide en met wie hij ten slotte huwde, was puriteins; hun huwelijk was louter een spirituele verbintenis en is nooit geconsummeerd. Later raakten zij vervreemd, maar haar terminale ziekte bracht hen weer bijeen; zij overleed in 1938. In 1923 kreeg Gide ondertussen een overspelige dochter bij Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, de dochter van Théo en Maria van Rysselberghe.\n\nGide heeft zich uiteindelijk bevrijd van deze hem verstikkende banden. Door het lezen van de werken van Nietzsche, door ontmoetingen met schrijvers als Oscar Wilde en door de ervaringen tijdens zijn Afrikaanse reizen ontwikkelde hij zijn geestelijk evenwicht als universeel humanist wiens non-conformistische levensstijl werd aanvaard.\n\nAndré Gide streefde ernaar open te blijven staan voor nieuwe kunststromingen als dadaïsme en surrealisme, of de mystieke kunst van William Blake, wiens werk hij vertaalde.\n\nOp middelbare leeftijd ging hij een langdurige vriendschap en verhouding aan met de vijftienjarige Marc Allégret (1900-1973), die hij adopteerde en die later een bekend filmproducent zou worden.\n\nWerk en thema's\n\nTerugkerende thema’s zijn het religieuze en het zinnelijke, waarbij de balans in de loop der jaren steeds vaker naar het zinnelijke doorsloeg. Vanaf zijn eerste werk schreef Gide over zijn eigen leven, zijn eigen psyche; het zou hem nooit lukken zijn eigen 'Ich' uit te sluiten. Zijn werk wordt narcistisch genoemd.\n\nZijn homoseksualiteit komt in zijn werk pas later aan de oppervlakte: in de vroegere werken draait hij er nog wat omheen. Toen hij echter in de jaren negentig van de negentiende eeuw drie jaar doorbracht in Algerije, viel veel van zijn geremdheid van hem af, mede doordat hij verliefd werd op de jonge Athman. Daarna verschenen zijn grote werken l'Immoraliste (1902) en la Porte étroite (1909). Tijdens WO I schreef hij Corydon (gepubliceerd na de oorlog, in 1924) waarin hij de homoseksualiteit in een gunstig daglicht stelt en zich beroept op grote figuren als Blaise Pascal en Montaigne. Overigens was hij voorstander van een viriele vorm van homoseksualiteit, die hij beschouwde als niet \"tegen de natuur\", maar wel \"tegen de norm\". In 1926 kwam Les Faux-monnayeurs uit, door Gide wel zijn \"enige roman\" genoemd. Het was in ieder geval zijn monumentaalste.\n\nBerucht is zijn houding tegenover de veelzijdige kunstenaar Jean Cocteau, op wie hij altijd heeft neergezien, zonder dat de reden daarvoor ooit duidelijk is geworden. Gides dagboeken wekken de indruk dat er (deels seksuele) jaloezie in het spel was.\n\nToen van de Amerikaanse auteur Gore Vidal in 1948 het openlijk homoseksuele The City and the Pillar uitkwam - een doorbraak in de VS - stuurde Gide de schrijver een exemplaar van Corydon.\n\nPolitiek\n\nIn de jaren twintig begon Gide zich te bekommeren om de maatschappelijk zwakkeren. Hij werd een voorvechter van gelijkberechtiging van de vrouw en was voorstander van een humanere behandeling van misdadigers.\n\nIn de jaren dertig had hij, zoals vele schrijvers in die tijd, sympathie voor het communisme, vooral onder invloed van het evangelie. Maar na een reis naar de Sovjet-Unie in juni 1936, in gezelschap van Jef Last, keerde hij ontgoocheld terug. Naar aanleiding van dit bezoek schreef hij een destijds opzienbarend reisverslag Retour de l'U.R.S.S. (1936) dat scherpe kritiek bevatte op de toestanden die hij had aangetroffen. De Sovjet-autoriteiten waren niet gelukkig met dit boek, waardoor Gide in de Sovjet-Unie in ongenade viel. Hij verloor vele communistische en socialistische vrienden.[1]\n\nIn de jaren veertig ontwikkelde zijn denken over het concept van de vrijheid zich: absolute vrijheid, aldus Gide, was zowel schadelijk voor de maatschappij, als voor het individu.\n\nInvloed\n\nAls oprichter van de Nouvelle Revue française (1909, na een abortief begin in 1908), maar vooral als vrijgevochten schrijver, heeft Gide een enorme invloed uitgeoefend op latere generaties Franse schrijvers en op de ontwikkeling van de moderne Franse roman, de Nouveau roman.\n\nHet werk van André Gide is geprezen en aangevallen, maar zowel voor- als tegenstanders erkennen zijn meesterschap over de vorm. Hij kreeg eredoctoraten van diverse universiteiten, waaronder Oxford. In 1947 ontving Gide de Nobelprijs voor Literatuur. In 1952 zette de Katholieke Kerk zijn werk op de lijst van verboden boeken.\n\nBibliografie:\n\nTitel: Moerassen - Paludes\n\nAuteur: André Gide\n\nVertaler: Hannie Vermeer-Pardoen\n\nUitgever: Vleugels\n\nJaar: 1895; 1926; 2019\n\nAantal blz: 135\n\nISBN: 9789078627753\n\nNovember 3, 2023\n\nΤέλματα. Αντρέ Ζιντ.\n\n\"Πριν εξηγήσω το βιβλίο μου στους άλλους, περιμένω οι άλλοι να μου το εξηγήσουν\"( Andre Gide).\n\nΗ αγωνία του κεντρικού ήρωα και αφηγητή των \"Τελμάτων\" είναι η πλήξη, η στασιμότητα, η έλλειψη αντίδρασης από το περιβάλλον. Αυτή η συμπαγής αδράνεια, τον προκαλεί μέχρι του σημείου της ρίξης του με το περιβάλλον, που τελικά αναστέλλεται από την εξαντλητική του προσπάθεια να εξηγήσει στους γύρω του (λόγιους, φιλοσόφους, αριστοκράτες),την ουσία του συγγραφικού του εγχειρήματος.\n\nΤα \"Τέλματα\" είναι ένα βιβλίο μέσα σ' ένα βιβλίο. Γίνεται το ίδιο το έργο ο αφηγηματικός του άξονας, με τη χρήση του λογοτεχνικού τεχνάσματος \"έργο μέσα στο έργο\". Κι αυτή η επανάληψη αποτελεί μέρος της πρακτικής του κατάδειξης όσων θεωρεί \"λιμνάζουσες\" πλευρές της ανθρώπινης ζωής.\n\nΣ' αυτή τη σάτιρα του Ζιντ παρακολουθούμε την ιστορία ενός βιβλίου εν τη γενέσει του, μια καταγραφή της μυθιστορηματικής δημιουργίας όπου η πρόθεση της γραφής είναι πιο ουσιαστική απ'την ποιότητα του αποτελέσματος, το οποίο λειτουργεί ως η κουραστική συνέπεια της πρόθεσης. Έτσι ο συγγραφέας και αφηγητής της ιστορίας φαίνεται να αντλεί τέτοια ηδονή από τη διαδικασία, που ωθείται στη διαστροφική καταγραφή( σε μορφή αντζέντας)ακόμα και των μελλοντικών του σκέψεων κατευθύνοντας τες ώστε να προαποφασίσουν τη θλίψη ή τη χαρά του. Η υπερέκθεση της ιστορίας προκαλεί τέτοια πολυφωνία, που σαν άλλος Πύργος της Βαβέλ οδηγεί στην παρεξήγηση του αναγνώσματος.\n\nΤελικά τα \"Τέλματα\" γίνονται αυτό που θέλει ο καθένας να είναι.\n\nFebruary 9, 2014\n\nIk herinnerde me Paludes als één van de hoogtepunten uit mijn studentenlectuur, al was de inhoud ervan met de tijd vervaagd.\n\nHet is in feite een soort dagboek van de auteur, die bezig is met het schrijven van \"Paludes\". Het vertrekpunt van Paludes is Vergilius' beroemde \"Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmini fagi\". Toch lijkt de invulling van het verhaal te verschillen naargelang de persoon aan wie de schrijver erover vertelt.\n\nIn wezen is Paludes een filosofisch verhaal over de al dan niet zoekende mens.\n\nHet was voor mij zeer confronterend om dit boek te herlezen, en wel om volgende redenen:\n\n- in tegenstelling tot vroeger weegt het filosofische aspect door op het humoristische aspect\n\n- ik ben duidelijk niet meer gewend om filosofische werken te lezen\n\n- en vooral: het is heel erg te moeten vaststellen dat, waar ik als studente vooral verwant was met de schrijver, ik onder druk van de dagelijkse besognes en beslommeringen veeleer ben uitgegroeid tot een soort Richard, voortdurend druk in de weer en zich in die drukke bezigheden gelukkig wanend.\n\nMisschien is het goed om dit boek regelmatig te herlezen, om niet te bezadigd te worden en zichzelf tijdig in vraag te stellen.\n\nFebruary 23, 2014\n\nRoman (très) court pour une (très) grosse claque. Tityre traverse le temps, de Virgile à Gide et jusqu'à aujourd'hui où on le retrouve partout, surtout en Occident, surtout chez ces Européens endormis. C'est peut-être ça le génie des auteurs classiques, écrire et être toujours encore plus d'actualité une centaine d'année après. Rarement je ne me suis senti aussi proche de l'auteur à contempler les Tityre m'entourant et à vouloir les changer... et de découvrir que Gide avait écrit cela à 26 ans - mon âge - est guère surprenant. Un âge où l'on croit encore, une dernière fois, pouvoir s'échapper de la normalité. Avant sûrement de finir par se résigner et d'accepter sa vie et sa monotonie.\n\nAugust 26, 2021\n\nThis was such an unexpectedly good read. The narrator is hilarious “Marshlands will never bore anyone as much as it has bored me…” his friend Hubert and Angela just unwillingly have to listen to all of his self-contradicting rambles it’s actually quite an enjoyable sight. As well as the party in Angela house. I love books written in this manner"
