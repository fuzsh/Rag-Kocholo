        "text": "Sun 5.20.18\n\nAm reading André Gide’s, The Counterfeiters, or as he would have it, Les Faux Monnayeurs. Published in 1925, it’s a complex novel with, all told, 29 characters in interlaced relationships. One is constantly having to look up who such & such a person is. Mostly it’s about the original, the real as opposed to the copy or the false. A brilliant writer, and a major influence in the 20th century, subtle, especially in describing relationship, and sophisticated. he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1917.\n\nGide was gay. He explains his orientation thusly:\n\nI call a pederast the man who, as the word indicates, falls in love with young boys. I call a sodomite (\"The word is sodomite, sir,\" said Verlaine to the judge who asked him if it were true that he was a sodomist) the man whose desire is addressed to mature men. […]\n\nThe pederasts, of whom I am one (why cannot I say this quite simply, without your immediately claiming to see a brag in my confession?), are much rarer, and the sodomites much more numerous, than I first thought. […] That such loves can spring up, that such relationships can be formed, it is not enough for me to say that this is natural; I maintain that it is good; each of the two finds exaltation, protection, a challenge in them; and I wonder whether it is for the youth or the elder man that they are more profitable.\n\nHe describes an adventure he had with Oscar Wilde:\n\nWilde took a key out of his pocket and showed me into a tiny apartment of two rooms… The youths followed him, each of them wrapped in a burnous that hid his face. Then the guide left us and Wilde sent me into the further room with little Mohammed and shut himself up in the other with the [other boy]. Every time since then that I have sought after pleasure, it is the memory of that night I have pursued. […] My joy was unbounded, and I cannot imagine it greater, even if love had been added.\n\nHow should there have been any question of love? How should I have allowed desire to dispose of my heart? No scruple clouded my pleasure and no remorse followed it. But what name then am I to give the rapture I felt as I clasped in my naked arms that perfect little body, so wild, so ardent, so sombrely lascivious? For a long time after Mohammed had left me, I remained in a state of passionate jubilation, and though I had already achieved pleasure five times with him, I renewed my ecstasy again and again, and when I got back to my room in the hotel, I prolonged its echoes until morning.[30]\n\nIn a novel within a novel, the main character, Edouard, is writing a novel called The Counterfeiters. He falls in love with his half sister’s middle son Olivier, a senior college student. Olivier’s older brother, Vincent has impregnated and abandoned Edouard’s former sweetheart. Olivier also has a schoolmate, Bernard, attracted to him. And then Vincent the impregnator becomes involved with Lady Griffith who takes him under her wings and sets about polishing him up. She is a friend to the bad guy, the Comte de Passavant who lent Vincent the money for his pregnant ex. Bad times ahead with this bunch.\n\nThis was Gide’s second book with a homosexual theme. The first one, Corydon was the gate crasher, the closet doors flung open asserting the rightness of homosexuality, strident, I didn’t enjoy it. But Counterfeiters is very good. Gide was prolific, over 50 books, he founded the Nouvelle Revue Francaise, a leading literary magazine, many travel books, journals, imaginary interviews, exposés on corruption. A gentleman."
