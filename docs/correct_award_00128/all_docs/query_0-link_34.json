Gide reminds us that venturing into the unknown inevitably involves leaving the familiar behind, whether it be physical or metaphorical. To discover new lands, both in the physical world and within ourselves, we must be willing to embrace uncertainty and step away from our comfort zones. Only by letting go of our attachments to the safe and predictable can we embark on a transformative journey of exploration and self-discovery. Gide's words encourage us to take risks, to courageously explore uncharted territories, and to trust that losing sight of the shore is necessary for the discovery of new horizons.",
