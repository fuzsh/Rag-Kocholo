        "text": "Biographical History\n\nAndré Gide was a French author and novelist known for his fiction and autobiographical works. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947.\n\nAndré Paul Guillaume Gide was born on November 22, 1869 in Paris, France to Juliette (Rondeaux) and Paul Gide. In October 1895 he married his cousin, Madeleine Rondeaux, but the marriage was never consummated. Gide had one daughter, Catherine, born to Elisabeth van Rysselberghe in 1923. Gide had a successful literary career and in 1947 he received the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his comprehensive and artistically significant writings, in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight\" (The Nobel Foundation, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/index.html). He died of pneumonia on February 19, 1951.\n\nReturn to top\n\nRestrictions\n\nAccess Restrictions\n\nThe majority of our archival and manuscript collections are housed offsite and require advanced notice for retrieval.
