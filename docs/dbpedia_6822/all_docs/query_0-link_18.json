        "text": "Abstract\n\nSince their inception in the years following World War II, American puberty videos have discursively manufactured affective distress in several generations of on-screen children. The patterns of talk found in eight films from 1947 to 2016 demonstrate that affect may de-link itself from specific talk and diffuse into a broader discourse through the recirculation of parallel structures in new semiotic spaces. I use queer critical discourse analysis (Jones & Collins 2020) and language socialization theory (Ochs & Schieffelin 2011) to argue that puberty videos first manufacture distress in the on-screen child before swiftly introducing a trusted adult to mitigate and recast distress as a normal part of growing up. Further, puberty videos reify cis- / heteronormativity and reproductive futurity in adulthood as the necessary outcomes of development. This paper explores the connection between affect and temporality in talk by critically attending to the historical stability of American puberty video discourse.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe belief that there is a relationship between sexuality and speech has inspired a vast body of linguistic research on lesbian- and gay-sounding voices (Campbell-Kibler 2007, Gaudio 1994, Levon 2006, Moonwomon-Baird 1997, Munson, McDonald, DeBoe & White 2006a, Munson, Jefferson & McDonald 2006b, Pierrehumbert, Bent, Munson, Bradlow & Bailey 2004, Smyth, Jacobs & Rogers 2003, Zimman 2013). Bisexuality is conspicuously absent in this literature. This article analyzes bisexual English speakers’ productions of the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ relative to lesbian, gay, and straight speakers using linear mixed-effects regression modeling. A qualitative analysis of post-test participant information surveys contextualizes the statistical findings. The quantitative and qualitative results suggest that bisexual women and men do not pattern consistently with each other or lesbian, gay, or straight speakers. The analysis highlights the extent to which ideologies of sexuality, gender, and normativity inform experimental sociophonetic research practice.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article presents a multimodal critical discourse analysis of #GaysForTrump on Twitter as a discursive formation within Trumpism with distinct subject positions connected to specific acts of identification, libidinal investments, and a homonationalist allegiance to the United States, constructed as a homotopia for cisgender, white gay men. Trumpism is a political formation with its own discursive and structural dynamics that we argue have bred a specific strain of homonationalism worth unpacking in its specificity. Our main objective was to understand how identifying as gay was articulated as commensurate with Donald Trump’s particular brand of transgressive and masculinist white nationalism. We identified three overarching discursive strategies: the appropriation of the “coming out” narrative to validate the #GaysForTrump victimization experience; the construction of conservative gay masculinity as desirable; and the articulation of a sexual geopolitics that legitimates the extreme xenophobia of Trumpism.\n\nAbstract\n\nSexuality professionals (sexologists) often communicate from a broad perspective of sexuality based on unique training. Cross-cultural code-switching is useful for sexologists to communicate with those who have different sexological worldviews. We discuss the concept of cross-cultural code-switching and its usefulness for sexuality professionals. We consider the theories behind the usefulness of this tactic in one’s work as a sexologist and offer practical considerations for effective code-switching across cultures. We observe the power dynamics in code-switching and offer this theoretical work as a way to raise one’s awareness to these realities of communication in the roles sexuality professionals hold in the world.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article explores the conceptions and attitudes that non-linguists have towards Finnish spoken by gay men. Combining folk linguistics and feminist theories, the study utilises interview and survey data for content analysis. The study finds that the main characteristics of speech viewed as “gay” – e.g. high pitch, atypical intonation patterns, nasality, non-canonical /s/ quality, use of affective adjectives – align with the speech stereotypes associated with girls and young women. The article suggests that, even though the attitudes explicitly communicated by the participants are mostly neutral, the language features associated with gay men show a strong relation to extra-linguistic gay stereotypes."
