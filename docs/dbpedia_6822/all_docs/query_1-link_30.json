        "text": "If you heard about Trans Pride having 20,000 people on the march, then that probably wouldn't have been via mainstream press, who didn't report this incredible moment. I proudly helped to co-found Trans Pride in Brighton & Hove in 2013, and we've gone from a few hundred people on an unofficial march, to the masses who flocked to support on Saturday. As a trustee and a trans person, my heart swelled to be part of such an important community event, seeing friends old and new, documenting the event and the incredible banners. Events like this are massively important, because there's a roll back of trans rights and a lot of mis-information about the reality of trans and non-binary lives. People ask why there's a separate Trans Pride, away from LGBTQIA+ Pride events, but this is because trans rights are not where gay rights are, and there's a lot of need for community and a focus on trans specific issues. Apparently there are 13 Trans Prides in the UK, and all of them will need your support. #pride #lgbt #transrights"
