Then, let them write a haiku about a beetle or a feeling their place invokes.” If a wizard were to grant me one wish, it would be for Anglophone language-users to stop confusing the verb to evoke with to invoke. To invoke means “to appeal to an authority, such as a religious text or an imposing thinker.” To evoke means “to suggest.” A place might evoke a feeling; it does not invoke a feeling.\n\nDeducing\n\n“He deduced that the mound had been used for a burial ritual.” No, he induced such an inference. He was not practicing deductive logic. He was practicing inductive logic. To deduce means to begin with a general statement and therefrom to seek evidence in order to support that statement. To deduce comes from the Latin deducere, which means “to move away from.” To induce may mean “to begin with evidence—and therefrom to come up with a general statement.” It comes from the Latin inducere, which means “to move into.” Thus, if someone is drawing conclusions after surveying a mound of dirt, that person is inducing, not deducing. Inducible is a great word that is only used by nerds such as myself. There is nothing wrong with “such as myself,” incidentally, even though Microsoft Word underlines it twice in blue.\n\nUnimaginable\n\n“An unimaginable humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Sudan.” But can one not imaginarily envision such a crisis? Can one not represent such a crisis in the imagination? A square circle might be unimaginable, but a zebra-headed griffin is not. Neither is a humanitarian crisis in Sudan.\n\nHypotheticals\n\n“Let’s not get into the hypotheticals of what would’ve happened if Franz Ferdinand hadn’t been killed.” Hypothetical is an adjective, not a noun. The nominal form is hypothesis (singular) or hypotheses (plural).\n\nHow Society Feels\n\n“We need to talk about how society feels about women’s issues.” But society does not “feel” anything. A society is a concentration of people. Perhaps those people have feelings, but “society” does not. It is emotionless. It also cannot think or believe. It cannot tell you anything.\n\nOptics\n\n“The optics are not good.” That should read, presumably: “The optics is not good.” Optics is a singular noun, or it may be a singular noun. A word is not plural merely because it ends in the letter S.\n\nEntertaining\n\nEven if I were to live as long as Zeus, I would never understand why the children misapply the verb to entertain. You can entertain a proposition or a proposal, but if you write that you are entertaining a person, this means that you are amusing that person. For these reasons, one oughtn’t write, “I refuse to entertain negativity.” Again: To entertain is either “to amuse people” or “to hold a proposition in one’s mind.” Thus, it would make more sense to write, “I refuse to entertain negative people,” if one were a clown with an ultra-sensitive disposition and fastidious tastes. It would also make more sense to write, “I refuse to entertain such a negative proposition,” if one means one wouldn’t want to consider such a proposition.\n\nGaslighting\n\nThis term has come to mean mere “lying” in American culture, since American culture dumbs down everything. One should keep the provenance of this term in mind, however. Gaslighting is derived from Patrick Hamilton’s play Gaslight. In the play, a murderous husband named Jack attempts to deceive his wife Bella into believing that the gaslights in their house aren’t dimming, even though they are. He is trying to drive her insane. Gaslighting does mean “lying,” in a sense, but it signifies a particular form of lying. It means deceiving someone into believing something that is contrary to sensory evidence.\n\nDroves\n\nAn excellent student of mine wrote this sentence in her essay: “Many are unnerved by the droves of abandoned buildings, as well as the population ravaged by poverty.” The sentence is fine, of course, but I did take slight exception to the use of the word droves. A drove is something that is drifting. Drove is derived from the Middle English word drīfan, which means “to drive.” A drove is a cluster, a clutch, a concentration, a constellation of things or people, but they must be in motion.\n\nReactionary\n\n“It is the nature of conservatives that we are somewhat reactionary.” To be reactionary is not to react to something or to someone. It means to be an unreconstructed, retrogressive conservative, a paleo-conservative. For this reason, the sentence cited above is tautologous. The word for “reacting to something or someone” is reactive, not reactionary.\n\nRelatable\n\nI once made the mistake of correcting a radio-interviewer who misused this word, and he retaliated against me by ending the interview. If you use the word relatable, it should be clear what is relating to what or who is relating to whom. Relatable to what? Relatable to whom? Don’t just write that someone or something is relatable, please!\n\nPassive-Aggressive\n\nThis term has been so often misapplied that the American Psychiatric Association excised it from its vocabulary. No, passive-aggressive does not mean “playing the victim.” It doesn’t mean that one is martyrizing oneself. It indicates that someone is asserting oneself in a minatory, hostile manner by refusing to do something that one is expected to do. The term suggests sullenness and surliness. It suggests non-participativeness and inexpressiveness. It suggests someone who wants to acerbate other people by ostentatiously not playing along. A passive-aggressive person is the antithesis of the team-player, and there is a sense that such an unlikable person wants the active players in the community to know that s/he doesn’t like them.\n\nJudgmental\n\n“My mom is so judgmental to people it’s outrageous.” All conscious human beings make judgments all of the time. What the writer means is that her mother passes negative judgments upon people and does so excessively. There is an adjective for this trait, and that adjective is…\n\nCensorious\n\n“Society is so censorious today compared to the late 20th century.” The word for which the writer is groping in vain is censorial. Censorious means “excessively fault-finding,” “captious,” “caviling,” “carping.” Someone is censorial if that person has the tendency to exercise censorship.\n\nSelf-Aware\n\n“Our teacher is not at all self-aware that she talks over the end of the class and we have jobs and other classes to get to. She has zero self-awareness.” Why do I have the impression that when people use the word self-aware, they actually mean “aware of others”?\n\nEmpaths\n\n“The social worker is such an empath. He makes everyone feel welcome and always asks how we are doing.” An empath is not merely someone who is sensitive, accommodating, and compassionate. Someone who is empathic is a person who can imaginarily represent to oneself how another human being is feeling.\n\nNarcissists\n\nI will follow Kohut in asseverating that narcissism is an essential structure of the human personality and is not exclusively a personality disorder. It seems to me, as it seemed to Kohut, that narcissists regard other human beings as specula—as mirrors. This is more than selfishness or self-interestedness. A narcissist is a speculist of the Self-in-others.\n\nRegret\n\nTo be regretful is to wish you had done something. To be remorseful is to wish you hadn’t done something. Thus, it is an instance of misapplication to say or to write: “They treated me badly all those years ago, but now that I am famous, they regret what they did to me.” I myself have made this mistake an uncountable number of times.\n\nIntentional\n\n“I’ve been very intentional about my dating-goals.” Well, good for you! You mean that you carefully set your dating-goals. The adjective intentional should not be coupled with a human subject. A person cannot be intentional—this makes absolutely no sense. A person might have the intention to do something, or a person might do something intentionally. “I have set my dating-goals decidedly (or undecidedly)” would be justifiable. Or: “I have set my dating-goals with intentness.” “To do something with intentness” is not a common phrase, it is true (one can find it in the writings of D. H. Lawrence), but it makes much more sense than “to be intentional about doing something.”\n\nDr. Joseph Suglia\n\nThe Endemic and Organic Disease of Willie Nillie, Who Drinks, Who Impacts Me, Who Is Totally Intentional, Agreeable, Disingenuous, Egregious, Toxic, and Meta, Who Has a Big Ego, Who Resonates with Me, and Who Is Totally Obsessed by the Mass Exodus from Our Apocalyptic Society\n\nby Joseph Suglia\n\nendemic\n\nEndemic is not the right way to describe a pandemic which has become normalized or naturalized. Prefer native. Endemic properly means “peculiar,” “exclusively specific,” or “particular.” Incidentally, peculiar means “exclusively specific,” as well. Peculiar does not mean “strange,” “odd,” “unusual.” EXAMPLES: The persimmon is a fruit which is endemic to East Asia. The rattlesnake and the caribou are endemic to North America.\n\norganic\n\nOrganic, etymologically, means “from human work.” It does not mean “natural.” The correct use of organic separates careful, serious writers from the hacks. Organic might be the most commonly misused word in the English language.\n\nwilly-nilly\n\nWilly-nilly does not mean “in a haphazard manner.” It means “involuntarily,” “whether I want to or not.”\n\nto drink\n\nWhy is it that everyone assumes that drinking alludes to imbibition of alcohol? There are other imbibitional practices than the consumption of spirituous libations.\n\nimpact\n\nI do not care who misuses this word. Impact is a noun, not a verb. Prefer to make an impact.\n\nintentional\n\nTo be intentional is a nonsensical fabrication. One is not intentional. One does something intentionally.\n\nagreeable\n\nI am not sure how many times more I can read and hear the misuse of the words agreeable and disagreeable without resistance. Despite what Dr. Jordan Peterson will tell you, agreeable does not mean “submissive,” “acquiescent,” “conforming,” “obeisant,” “complaisant,” nor does disagreeable mean “rebellious,” “disobedient,” “resistant,” “renitent,” “recalcitrant.” Agreeable means “pleasing to the senses.” Disagreeable means “unpleasant.”\n\ndisingenuous\n\nDisingenuous does not mean “dishonest.” It means “pretending to be innocent when one is not,” which is something different.\n\negregious\n\nEgregious does not mean “morally bad.” It means “conspicuous.” Indeed, the word egregious originally meant “distinguished,” “eminent”! In the same way in which the word bland originally meant “pleasant,” and the word egregious originally meant something that is different from what it has come to mean.\n\ntoxic\n\nToxic does not mean “abusive.” It means “carrying a toxin,” “poisonous.”\n\nmeta\n\nMeta is Greek for “after.” It is fine to use it as a prefix, such as in metapsychology or metaphysics. In such cases, the prefix meta– means “beyond.” Meta, by itself, does not mean “self-reflexive,” which is the proper way of writing it. It is likely that the misuse of meta as a stand-alone adjective is derived from meta-fictional or meta-cinematic.\n\nbig ego\n\nIn Freudian psychoanalysis, the Ego (das Ich) is the self-preservational part of the human mind; it is a representation of the Reality Principle. The Ego is the “I” that stands against the impulses of the Id (das Es) and squares these impulses with the demands of the world. Having a “big ego” makes no sense. I suppose that one might be said to have a “solid ego,” but there is no such thing as a “big ego.” There might be such a thing as a “big Ego-Ideal,” however. The Ego-Ideal is the idealized image that someone has of oneself. The Ego-Ideal is a form of self-deception, a fictionalized image-concept of one’s being.\n\nThe Ego regulates the desires, the proclivities, the impulses, the inclinations of the libido. Imagine a man who believes that he is a good-natured and unfailingly polite—he compliments himself thus. His behavior suggests otherwise, and, more to the point, his unconscious mind suggests otherwise. And I do not think it makes any sense to describe the size of the Ego. I would, however, defend those who use the phrase “fragile Ego,” under the proviso that they know what they mean. All of this merely to write: There is no such thing as a “big Ego”!\n\nEgotistical is some kind of linguistic savagery that should be quickly civilized. If you must use such a word, prefer egoistic or egoistical. In my Nietzsche translations, I use egoic.\n\nto resonate with\n\nWe need to stop using the phrase to resonate with. It is nonsensical. To resonate means “to continue to produce sound,” “to echo.” It only makes sense to write or say, to resonate within. Something might resonate within you, but how could something resonate with you?\n\nobsessed\n\nAre you truly “obsessed” with any social-media site? Are you truly “obsessed” with any piece of clothing? Are you truly “obsessed” with any kind of food? Are you truly “obsessed” with a song? Are you truly “obsessed” with cleaning your home? An obsession is an all-engulfing fascination that deprives you of hunger and sleep. We would do well to use this term more sparingly. Remember that to obsess is derived from obsidēre, which means “to beleaguer,” “to besiege,” “to weigh upon,” “to oppress.”\n\nmass exodus\n\nThe phrase mass exodus is a pleonasm. Exodus is a Greek word that means “the way out” and came into prominence from the Hebraic Bible’s description of the departure of the Ancient Israelites from Egypt. Every exodus is the exodus of a mass of people.\n\napocalyptic\n\nMeanings have accreted to this word that are alien to what the word actually means. The Apocalypse is not the cataclysm that will end the world; it refers to the impendent revelation of what is good and what is evil. The term is derived from the Greek apokalýptein, which means “to disclose,” “to reveal,” “to uncover.” Thus, it makes no sense to say or write that something is “apocalyptically terrible,” since the Apocalypse might not be bad at all. Indeed, if a writer makes Apocalyptic pronouncements, good for him / her! That writer is revealing Good and Evil and distinguishing what is good from what is evil. If you want to describe something that is surreally terrible, prefer dystopian or cacotopian. Incidentally, always capitalize the A in “Apocalypse” and don’t confuse it with “Armageddon.” I propose the coinages Armageddonic or Ragnarökian, instead of Apocalyptic, to signify “end-of-the-worldly.”\n\nDr. Joseph Suglia\n\nAn Agreeable Global Pandemic\n\nby Joseph Suglia\n\n1.) Despite what Jordan Peterson implies, agreeable does not mean “tending to agree,” “complaisant,” “obedient,” “submissive.” Agreeable means “pleasant.” EXAMPLE: “Nothing could be more agreeable” means “Nothing would be more pleasant.” Disagreeable means “unpleasant.”\n\n2.) To beg the question means “to move in a circle argumentatively.” Begging the question means that what was supposed to be proven has not been proven–the premise of the argument has been merely repeated. EXAMPLE: “Schools need to be reopened because not to do so would be to keep them closed.” To beg a question does not mean “to prompt a question.” It is tautologous, like an Ouroboros, the snake that eats its own tail.\n\n3.) “Global pandemic” [sic] is a pleonasm (writing the same thing twice or saying the same thing twice). Pan- means “everything.” Of course, a pandemic is global!\n\n4.) Reactionary does not mean “reactive.” It is a politics which is unreconstructed, a deeply entrenched adherence to tradition.\n\n5.) Moot is a term of law. It does not mean “mute,” despite the phonetic identity. Moot means the precise opposite of mute: What is moot is what is discussable, not what is indiscussable. What is moot is what you may talk about, not what you may not talk about.\n\n6.) Nothing irritates me more than the misuse of the word performative. Since I am a comparatist, I have spent many years of my life studying literary theory, and postmodern literary theory draws many of its concepts from linguistics. Performative comes from the work of the philosopher J.L. Austin. A performative is a sentence that has the word “I” as its subject and which appears to elicit an action. A performative is illocutionary if it is direct (a promise or a command) or perlocutionary if it is indirect (a form of persuasion or seduction). “I promise to cook your breakfast tomorrow morning” is an illocutionary speech act because it might lead to the action of cooking someone’s breakfast. A perlocutionary speech act would be: “I wonder if you would like me to cook your breakfast tomorrow morning.”\n\n7.) I have written about this elsewhere (cf. “Literally”), but to repeat for the purpose of emphasis: “I literally cannot hear the music” does not need the word literally.\n\n8.) Some cliches are useful. A useful cliche is a high-frequency expression. EXAMPLES: “If you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes”; “When you’re in a hole, stop digging.”\n\n9.) Enttäuschungsgelüst is a word that I have coined which means “the pleasure in someone else’s disappointment.” Let us say that someone wants you to be unhappy. Your happiness makes your enemy disappointed; you feel Enttäuschungsgelüst as a result. Perhaps you feel Enttäuschungsgelüst when someone else is disappointed when you decline the invitation to a party. The fact that your presence is desired and missed fills you with Enttäuschungsgelüst.\n\n10.) It makes no sense to say/write that someone has a “fragile Ego,” a “big Ego,” or an “inflated Ego,” unless one intends thereby the construction of the Ego Ideal. The Ego Ideal is the idealized and self-preserving image of the self.\n\n11.) Never say/write that a character or a person is “relatable,” unless you specify to what or to whom that character or person can be related. “The characters in the Netflix program are very relatable.” To what? To whom? And what does “very” mean in this sentence?\n\n12.) “No problem” is a problem. Prefer “You are welcome” or “My pleasure,” which is the preferred expression of welcome by the employees of Chick-fil-A.\n\n13.) Avoid superfluous words and phrases. Instead of saying/writing, “She was able to create a painting,” say or write, “She created a painting.”\n\n14.) Capitalize all of the letters in RADAR, for it is an acronym. But should one capitalize all of the letters in robot?\n\n15.) Avoid portmanteaux (see my forthcoming guide The Ten Punctilios of Style). Portmanteaux are formed by people who think that they don’t have enough time to utter two words. So, they combine two words into one, clumsily. They say things such as “passionpreneuer.”\n\n16.) “A little bit extreme” is an example of antiphrasis (if something is extreme, it is not “little”).\n\n17.) “I, personally” is an example of a pleonasm. Delete “personally,” and simply write, “I.” There is no reason to write, “personally,” if you write, “I.”\n\n18.) Stop saying/writing, “the new normal.” Simply say or write, “the way that we do things now.”\n\nJoseph Suglia\n\nA Few Words of Introduction to PRINCIPLES OF ENGLISH USAGE: STANDARD WRITTEN AMERICAN ENGLISH by Joseph Suglia\n\nSince there is confusion around the term “usage,” let me write a few words of introduction here.\n\nUsage covers three areas:\n\na.) whether certain words should be used at all\n\nb.) when certain words should be used\n\nand\n\nc.) where words should be used\n\nThe language of choice is Standard Written American English not because it is the only form of English or because it is the best form of English. It is the language of choice because it is the form of English that is political and institutional. Standard Written American English is no better than, for instance, Spanglish or Chinglish. It is simply the form of English that has been, by a series of historical accidents, politically and institutionally accepted.\n\nIs “lightning” a verb? Is it acceptable to write, “It is lightninging”?\n\nAccording to Standard Written American English, it is.\n\nIs “you guys’s dog” Standard Written American English?\n\nThe descriptivists would say that it is, since the descriptivists believe that a community of language users does not need to be told how to use “their own” language. Descriptivists believe that language is a game without any rules. Language, according to the descriptivists, is a game of tennis that is played without a net, without a court, without a ball, and without rackets.\n\nI would argue, on the other hand, that every language has its own set of rules already. It is absolutely fine to write, “you guys’s dog” in colloquial English. It is absolutely wrong to write, “you guys’s dog” in Standard Written American English.\n\nWhat determines acceptability? The boundaries of acceptability are set by that which one can explain. All I am arguing for is a greater consciousness-in-writing. I wish that today’s writers would become more conscious writers.\n\nWhen there is a question of meaning, instead of looking to the dictionaries, one should look at etymologies. The verb peruse is a good example of an amphibolous word. To peruse means, according to most dictionaries, both “to read carefully” and “to read carelessly.”\n\nIf one knows that the prefix per- means “thoroughly,” the choice becomes clear: To peruse means “to read carefully” in Standard Written American English, despite what dictionaries might tell you.\n\nDr. Joseph Suglia\n\n“I find your tone very gratuitous”\n\n“It is very nice to meet you, and I hope to see you again soon,” Cheyenne said with the most gratuitous tone she could muster into the phone.\n\nAnd did I not have something of the same gratuitous tone where my wage-earning was concerned?\n\nWhile the article is written in a somewhat gratuitous tone, I think that it is meant to be informative.\n\nThe three sentences above have two things in common:\n\na.) They are three of the most invasively galling and aggressively grating sentences that I have ever read in my life.\n\nb.) They couple the words gratuitous and tone.\n\ngratuitous\n\nDespite what descriptivist dictionaries might tell us, gratuitous should not signify “unnecessary” or “unwarranted.” Gratuitous is derived from gratus and originally meant “what is freely given,” “what is given without the expectation of compensation.”\n\nThus, it makes no sense to write, “Abel Ferrara’s Body Snatchers (1993) contains a gratuitous scene of violence,” unless you are suggesting that the scene is given to audiences without the expectation of compensation.\n\nUse supererogatory or superfluous instead.\n\ntone\n\nWhenever someone says/writes the word tone, I usually do not understand what that person means. “You have to establish a tone in your writing”: In order to establish a tone, I must first know what the word tone signifies.\n\nTone is the vaguest, slipperiest word in the English language, and I wish that it would go extinct.\n\nThe color of her writing, the atmospherics, the mood of Daphne du Maurier’s novels — these terms, at least, are clear. Color, atmospherics, mood. I understand what prose-style is.\n\nTone is more general than any of these words and refers to everything and nothing with equal acuity or vacuity.\n\nTone is used these days as a surrogate for the refutation of an argument: “I agree with what you are saying, but I don’t like your tone.” Instead of a reasoned disagreement, there is the accusation of a “bad tone,” and this accusation is supposed to shut down one’s argument.\n\nThere is no defense or recourse against such an accusation. Tone is irreducibly subjective.\n\nWhen pressed, the accuser will say, “Well, I just don’t like the way that you said that.” This leads me to believe that tone is a camouflage word. It disguises the bluntness of “I don’t like the way that you said that.”\n\nThe German correlative of tone is der Ton and has a clearer meaning. For a contemporary use of this, consult Haneke’s film Funny Games (1997). Friedrich Hölderlin knew what he meant by the word when he employed it in his theory of tonal modulation (Wechsel der Töne).\n\nMy advice? Never use the English word tone, ever.\n\nJoseph Suglia"
