        "text": "A.C. Smith\n\nA.C. Smith is a playwright and songwriter who has won awards from the RSC and Soho Theatre. She has previously developed work with the Bush Theatre, HighTide, the Old Vic, and RADA. She loves exploring the boundary between real life and art, and has a specialism in cross-medium experimentation, collaborating regularly with artists from the worlds of dance, photography, mime, and film.\n\nTo Rose On Her 18th Birthday\n\nTo Rose On Her 18th Birthday is an autobiographical play, written as a love letter from a mother to her young daughter. Writer A.C. Smith was on maternity leave when she discovered a lump in her breast – which turned out to be cancer. The play explores the life-altering experience of going through cancer treatment as a young mother – and then having to do it all over again when the cancer returned mid-pandemic. When Rose turns 18, she will be able to decide whether she wants to be tested to know whether she carries the genetic mutation that made her mother so prone to getting cancer. This is a play written to speak to her in that moment, ultimately asking the question: how do we live joyfully in the face of uncertainty?\n\nASYLUM Arts: Stephen Bailey, Theo Angel, Evlyne Oyedoukn, Kat Dulfer\n\nASYLUM Arts is a CiC company that creates opportunities and platforms neurodivergent/disabled artists. We make work that reinterprets and critiques social perceptions of disability & neurodivergency – subverting mainstream narratives and expectations of disabled-art. ASYLUM work in a collaborative format – centralising different artists dependent on the project.\n\nPrevious credits include Surfacing (**** Londontheatre1, VAULT Origins nominee), which will tour nationally in 2024; creative producing the development of FlawBored’s It’s a Motherf**king Pleasure and its runs at VAULT and Soho (***** The Times, Untapped Award winner); Who Plays Who, a comedic critique of cripping up (the Barbican Centre and closing Liberty Festival 2022); Covered in Jam’s That’s Not My Name, which mixes cabaret with structured facilitated discussion to explore the effects of receiving diagnoses of personality disorders (***** National Tour). They also run training schemes and have provided mentoring to various neurodivergent artists.\n\nAutistic as Fuck\n\nAutistic as Fuck is a meta-theatrical piece about autistic performers trying to put on a show about autism. Over the course of the show, internal conflicts underline both the lack of public understanding\n\nabout autism but also the complexities and contradictions within such a large group. At its heart (and with a lot of comedy) AAF argues that the ‘tell your story’ show just involves masking in a different way – being pushed into a performance of identity which doesn’t reflect what you feel and maybe, when seen by a non-disabled audience, is harmful. It’s dark, it’s funny, it asks questions about what people laugh at, it’s angry at points but ends optimistically though pointedly emphasising the impact of anti- autistic discrimination in the world.\n\nHugh Malyon and Steve Sowden\n\nHugh is a disabled artist whose practise bridges space between personal, political and the universal. His\n\ncreative work aims to directly disrupt categorisation, shifting perceptions of disability towards positive identity, unleashing the power of care as practise. Steve is a neurodivergent, multidisciplinary artist working with live and recorded soundscape, music and voice, to find multi-layered stories with and through the community around him.\n\nHumetheus and the Quest for the Bronze Cloak\n\nHumetheus and the Quest for the Bronze Cloak will see Humetheus in jeopardy, encountering mayhem and myth. Questions on which way to turn or who’s story is being told seem contradictory. As we journey towards the dead end of Paignton Pier, an almost too remarkable tale of heroes and monsters unfolds; will our hero’s insatiable desire to prove his worth divert him from his true destiny? The end is in sight, but never in touching distance. What if we get stuck in a loop of trying, and never find a way home? Have we been here before? Intertwining classical myth with raw and knotty reality, this emotive semi-autobiographical journey take us to the seaside long after the holidays have ended.\n\nPeyvand Sadeghian & Matthew Robinson\n\nPeyvand Sadeghian is a neurodivergent performer and maker from and London native, working across stage and screen. A Goldsmiths College alum and ex-National Youth Theatre GB member, Peyvand is an\n\nAssociate artist with Camden People’s Theatre, Nouveau Riche, Tamasha and has undertaken residencies with Barbican Open Lab, and artsdepot through which she’s evolving a multi-disciplinary practice with performance at its core. Previous works include Dual دوگانه (VAULT Festival 2020 Show of the Week, Keep it Fringe 2023 recipient); The Art of Uprising (MENA Arts UK short film); Restless (Terrifying Women).\n\nMatthew Robinson is a neurodivergent visual artist whose experience spans teaching, filmmaking and screen arts, with a particular focus on experimental film and narrative theory. During an arts fellowship & residency in Berlin at Z/KU Center for Art and Urbanistics, Matthew co-created Baden Projekt, a series of installations that combined documentary and projection to create an immersive sensory experience that explored perspectives of nature and the city through the changing state of water and its impact on wellbeing. Other works include Glacial Waters,(Goethe Institut & EU Creative Commission), an experimental film installation using holographic multi-channel projections exploring global warming and the importance of waters from the Bogdanovich Glacier to the city of Almaty, exhibited at Art Bat Fest in\n\nKazakhstan.\n\nOver the Moon\n\nOver the Moon (working title) is a theatrical exploration using immersive projections and original NASA archive material of the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing, to navigate the interplay between awe and despair, along with the search for NASA’s top-secret mental health checklist in the quest for wellness. Using this cultural marker for human progress so deeply embedded into our collective psyche, we ask: What perspective has space travel really given us on our place in the universe, our relationships with each other and in understanding ourselves?\n\nMarcy Rick & Ro Lewis\n\nMarcella Rick and Ro Lewis are a duo of queer, neurodivergent artists creating work that spans theatre, spoken word, cabaret and stand up comedy. Driven by scouse and northern humour, their work is bold, funny and often chaotic.\n\nA graduate of the Everyman & Playhouse Playwrights Programme, and with previous projects supported\n\nby Homotopia and Unity Theatre, Marcella’s recent credits include; Who The F**k is Shakespeare (20\n\nStories High), Arden Winter Tales (Writer, Box of Tricks) and Sober Curious (CRIPtic Arts).\n\nCurrently part of the Everyman & Playhouse Young Writers Programme, and previously supported by\n\nUnity Theatre and Young Homotopia, Ro’s recent credits include; Potato Milk (Unity Theatre), Lydia\n\nMcmannus & The Red Headed Girl (Hope Mill Theatre), and Femme (Young Everyman & Playhouse)\n\nBoth regularly curate, host and perform at events for Unusual Art Sourcing Companies Birkenhead Arts\n\nPalace, with a focus on new and emerging artists.\n\nWellness Seminar (title TBC)\n\nWe’re all overworked & underpaid, overloaded and under appreciated, but thank god for workplace\n\nwellbeing culture! Who needs work/life balance when we have lunchtime yoga and wellbeing webinars?\n\nOn Launchpad, we’re going to pull this culture apart at the seams, and put a spotlight on the inaccessible, uninspiring, proper shit ways that workers are often let down by their employers. For too long now, employers have gotten away with pocketing the profits of their employees’ work – and all we got was this lousy wellbeing seminar.\n\nBy satirizing the many World Mental Health days that we, mentally ill disabled artists, have spent being\n\ntold ‘it’s okay not to be okay’, immediately followed by ‘now get back to work’, we’re going to put\n\nworkplace wellbeing culture where it belongs – in the bin.\n\nJasmin Thien\n\nJasmin Thien is a fully blind, Bruneian born Chinese actor, writer, spoken word poet and stand-up comedian. She earned a degree in Education, English, Drama and the Arts from Cambridge University. Her work often explores narratives of intersectionality. She is especially keen on approaching difficult subjects in ways that are truthful and nuanced while staying accessible to all.\n\nWe Close Our Eyes\n\nWe Close Our Eyes is a play exploring memory, loss, inter-generational trauma and what it means to repeatedly start a new life for the sake of the next generation. It takes a raw and sometimes even funny look at how being Chinese means to be stubborn, to be headstrong, to never be afraid to begin again, and above all, to never, ever talk about trauma.\n\nJessi Parrott\n\nJessi Parrott is a non-binary, disabled and neurodivergent performer, playwright and poet based in London. When making their own creative work, they are particularly interested in exploring the intersections of their identity, and understanding what it means to navigate the world as a wheelchair user with Cerebral Palsy who is part of the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nBumps\n\nBumps explores the joy and pain of journeys (literal and figurative) towards accepting and embracing your body and brain, when society – and your own mind – tells you that you shouldn’t.\n\nAda Eravama\n\nI’m a Nigerian woman who is visually impaired, based in Manchester. I studied Performing Arts at Hope University, Liverpool. I’m inspired by the creative potential of audio description and believe access tools such as AD and BSL should continually be experimented with to ensure they complement their visual counterparts. I’ve worked with companies such as Leeds Playhouse, Mind the Gap, Extant, DaDaFest, and The National Youth Theatre – as a trainee, performer, assistant director, and Inclusion facilitator. These years of experience have inspired a career in directing and the playful exploration of multi-sensory, access-integrated work.\n\nFragments\n\nExploring themes from my Nigerian culture, age, and youth, the piece follows Grace and her grandma who are struggling to connect before something more than personal differences expand the distance between them."
