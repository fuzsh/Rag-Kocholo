        "text": "As the lead singer of 1980’s pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Holly Johnson has had a huge influence on Liverpool’s music and queer cultural scene. He achieved three number ones with the band, has had a successful solo career and has held visual art exhibitions.\n\nJohnson has also worked with Merseyside-based LGBTQIA+ sexual health and wellness charity Sahir House, who are a partner of this project. Working alongside Homotopia, they will capture the stories of local LGBTQIA+ people in community workshops and oral history sessions over 12 months.\n\nWe hope that as we look back on LGBTQIA+ heritage, it gives us an opportunity to look towards the future.\n\nOlivia Graham, Marketing & Development Manager at Homotopia\n\nLocal artists will be commissioned to creatively contribute to an exhibition to showcase Liverpool’s rich artistic LGBTQIA+ heritage and talent.\n\nThe research and development of the exhibition will align with the 40th anniversary of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's rise to global fame and explore Johnson’s story from the punk scene in Liverpool to international stardom.\n\nOlivia Graham, Marketing & Development Manager at Homotopia, said: “The queer fashion and culture pioneered by Holly in the 80s is of huge relevance now, and we hope that as we look back on LGBTQIA+ heritage, it gives us an opportunity to look towards the future.”"
