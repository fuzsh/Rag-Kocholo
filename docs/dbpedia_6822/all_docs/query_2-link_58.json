        "text": "Get to know Turner Prize nominated artist, Veronica Ryan, at our exclusive In Conversation event\n\nThe Turner Prize 2022 is back in Liverpool and we’re inviting you to get to know each of the four nominees through our Meet the Artist event series. Join each of the artists in conversation with a guest of their choice, to discuss the themes of their work.\n\nFor the third in our series, hear from Veronica Ryan. Nominated for her solo exhibition Along a Spectrum at Spike Island and her Windrush Artwork Commission in Hackney, Ryan’s work is a continuous process of adaptation – making and remaking. Her recent works feature sculptural objects and installations using containers, compartments, and combinations of natural and fabricated forms to reference displacement, fragmentation, and alienation.\n\nThe artist will be joined in conversation with Lewis Dalton Gilbert, curator of the Hackney Windrush Artwork Commissions, and current Creative Director of Black-owned creative agency A Vibe Called Tech – working to approach creativity through an intersectional lens. This event will be followed by an audience Q&A.\n\nGet to know Turner Prize nominated artist, Heather Phillipson\n\nThe Turner Prize 2022 is back in Liverpool and we’re inviting you to get to know each of the four nominees through our Meet the Artist event series. Join each of the artists with a guest of their choice, to explore the themes of their work.\n\nFor the second in our series, join artist Heather Phillipson. Nominated for her solo exhibition RUPTURE NO 1: blowtorching the bitten peach at Tate Britain and her Fourth Plinth commission THE END, Heather Phillipson’s wide-ranging practice involves collisions of wildly different materials, media and gestures in what she calls “quantum thought experiments”.\n\nDuring this event, the artist will introduce a presentation by Professor Steve Brusatte, Chair of Palaeontology and Evolution, of the University of Edinburgh, on the evolution of mammals across pre-history, in relation to global climate changes – a major theme in her work. This talk will be followed by an audience Q&A.\n\nCelebrating the release of a ground-breaking new anthology called This Arab Is Queer, this event by Homotopia and supported by LAAF, brings together editor Elias Jahshan with essayists Madian Alijazeera and Anbara Salam for an evening of readings and lively chat.\n\nFor the first time, LGBTQIA Arabs come together to share their personal stories of hope, struggle and love. All welcome.\n\nMadian Aljazeera is a Palestinian Jordanian bookseller and founder of Amman’s Books at Café, a bookshopcome-internet café.\n\nAnbara Salam is a Palestinian-Lebanese-Scottish writer. She is the author of Things Bright and Beautiful (Fig Tree/Penguin, 2018) and Belladonna (Fig Tree/Penguin, 2020).\n\nElias Jahshan (he/him) is a Palestinian/Lebanese-Australian journalist, writer and editor. He is a former editor of Star Observer, Australia’s longest-running LGBTQ+ media outlet.\n\nChaired by Laura Marie Brown, Creative Producer at Liverpool Arab Arts Festival.\n\nYou can buy a copy of This Arab is Queer, published by Saqi Books, https://saqibooks.com/books/saqi/this-arab-is-queer/\n\nHomotopia runs 1st – 20th November 2022 across Liverpool. Check out the fantastic programme and book tickets here: www.homotopia.net/festival/\n\nThis October, Unity are proud to host the opening of the first Here and Queer panel discussion. They will be discussing the project, the process and their new exhibition. With the Queer Creatives Meet-Up before, a spoken word performance from Day Mattar during and a queer Halloween film screening after, it is set to be a special evening and not one to miss.\n\nWhat is Here n Queer?\n\nHere n Queer is a street-art photography project focusing on claiming public spaces where queer people have been made to feel unsafe. We fill the streets and exhibition spaces with photos of and words from Queer people living unapologetically. Liverpool is all of our city and everyone should be able to call it home. Here n Queer consists of Kolade Ladipo, Luke Bryant, Iesha Palmer, Francois Sandile Alexander and Felix Mufti.\n\nThe work shot by photographer Luke Bryant features moments of beauty and triumph, with images of those that have been made to feel unwelcome or attacked, returning to these sites to be unapologetically themselves. Here n Queer has also recently captured members of the LGBTQIA+ community in areas where they feel most themselves and accepted, to champion the places that help to fight prejudice in their everyday. The culmination of all of these shoots is a colourful, joyful and personal body of work that serves to send a community-wide message of love and acceptance.\n\nMake a night of it…\n\nAs well as the panel discussion, there are two more events happening that evening that you’re welcome to attend and enjoy:\n\n6pm, Queer Creative’s Meet Up: Join Homotopia, Unity and friends for a friendly and inclusive meetup with local LGBTQIA artists, makers and creators. This is your chance to meet new creative collaborators, seek career advice and have a lovely time with liked-minded queer pals.\n\n7pm, Here n Queer Panel Discussion + Spoken Word Performance from Day Mattar: Join the team behind our latest exhibition Here n Queer to find out more about project, the process and the images. With the Queer Creatives Meet-Up before, a spoken word performance from Day Mattar during the panel discussion and a Queer Halloween film screening after, it is set to be a special evening and not one to miss.\n\n8pm, Queer Halloween Film Screening + intro: For our October Cinema Night Special, the Cinema Nation team present a Halloween bash with a Queer Twist with a screening of cult-favourite, Hausu. Once described as “Scooby Doo on acid, when a schoolgirl decides to visit her aunt for the summer and invites a group of friends, it’s not long before their mischievous antics swerve into a kaleidoscopic and bizarre horror journey.\n\nRefreshments:\n\nThe Unity Bar will be open from 5pm with a special Halloween themed cocktail menu for just £6 per cocktail. Our usual 2 for £8 beer and wine offer will also be available, supplied by your favourite local vendors including Love Lane, Liverpool Brewing Company and Neptune, as well as a range of snacks for you to enjoy with the film.\n\nJoin legendary musician and broadcaster Jarvis Cocker live in conversation to celebrate the publication of his highly regarded new book Good Pop, Bad Pop.\n\nJarvis will be discussing his unique life, Pulp, 20th century pop culture, the good times and the mistakes he’d rather forget.\n\nSo please join them. Proceeds in support of Ron’s Place in Birkennhead, of which Jarvis is Patron.\n\nWe all have a random collection of the things that made us – photos, tickets, clothes, souvenirs, stuffed in a box, packed in a suitcase, or crammed in a drawer. When Jarvis Cocker cleared out his loft, he found a jumble of objects that catalogued his story and asked him some awkward questions. Now Jarvis takes us through the accumulated debris of a lifetime, revealing his creative process – writing and musicianship, performance and ambition, style and stagecraft.\n\nGood Pop, Bad Pop asks whether the things we keep hidden say more about us than those we put on display.\n\nJarvis will be signing books after the show.\n\nMain Photo: Tom Jamieson\n\nLion Photo: Martin Wallace"
