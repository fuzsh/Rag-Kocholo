The events take place during the war in Ukraine, which exacerbates the problems faced by couples – the inability to arrange guardianship for their children or to visit an injured partner in the hospital. Some of the characters are representatives of the LGBTQ+ community, who tell their authentic stories at the end of the video.\n\nThe MARRIAGE (IN)EQUALITY project was prepared as part of an advocacy campaign aimed at lobbying for the adoption of bill No. 9103 “On the Institute of Registered Partnerships” in Ukraine. This bill would allow LGBTQ+ couples to have some of the rights that heterosexual couples have after marriage. For example, they would have equal rights in matters related to property, inheritance, insurance, pensions, medical care, and other important aspects of life.\n\nThe project will be presented by director Yuriy Dvizhon and art director Aleh Razhkou, followed by a panel discussion with Homotopia representatives on the theme of “Power of art in advocacy”. The panel discussion aims to explore the role of art in transforming society. Can art projects influence laws? How to achieve a successful advocacy campaign through art? Can the experience of art activists from one country be useful to representatives of another, and how to achieve synergy on the global stage?\n\nVisitors to the presentation will have the opportunity to speak personally with the creators of the project MARRIAGE (IN)EQUALITY IN UKRAINE and also pose their questions to the panellists.\n\nYuriy Dvizhon is a film director, creative producer, LGBTQ, and HIV activist from Ukraine who communicates with his audience using art videos and films. He is included in the “Top 30 under 30” by the oldest English-language newspaper, Kyiv Post, for his contribution to the development of Ukrainian society. Some of his works were officially selected or won at Ukrainian and international festivals (1.4 Awards, Berlin Music Video Awards, Bolton International Film Festival, Kyiv Fashion Film Festival, LGBT+ Film Festival Poland, La Jolla Fashion Film Festival, and many others). In 2023, The Shark Awards shortlisted him as a Best New Talent director.\n\nAleh Razhkou, Cultural Projects Director from Belarus now residing in London, is passionate about exploring xenophobia and the pathways to its eradication through his latest works. In a continual state of experimentation and self-observation, he collaborates with fellow creators, utilizing art as a universal language that bridges diverse communities. He places a special emphasis on the recognition and acceptance of the queer community in society.\n\n9 MAY / 6–7 PM / FREE, RSVP\n\nA short video art transports us to an imaginary world where heterosexual couples cannot legalise their relationships.
