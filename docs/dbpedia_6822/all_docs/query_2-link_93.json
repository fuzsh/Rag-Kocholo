        "text": "Council House Movie Star was originally a collaboration between performance artist and writer Mark Edward, designer Olivia Du Monceau, film director Rosa Fong, videographer Mark Fremaux, fine art painter Pete Bennett and sound maker Karen Lauke. The project was funded by Edge Hill University and launched the opening of the international LGBT arts festival Homotopia in 2012. The work consisted of a short film of the drag persona Gale Force, a fading drag queen in a socially deprived economy going about daily life; and an immersive gallery installation where Gale’s council house was installed. The house illuminated the gritty and glamorous aesthetics of the 1970s with a variety of props that related to Mark Edward’s childhood; a childhood era of strong working class northern women with highly charged personas and the ability to mark their terror-itory with such back street chic. Gale inhabited this space for three weeks in Liverpool, alongside other ageing drag queens and youth from the local council estate. Such immersion invited live viewership and participation. Although the film was part of a larger scale immersive installation, it has its own identity and can be appreciated independently from its original setting as part of the live performance. The movie draws viewers into the poignant absurdities and eccentricities of life, giving the viewer a peek behind Gale Force's dirty net curtains and providing real moments of fun underscored with a sense of sadness and loss. The work strikes a balance between being entertaining and inviting the viewer to think about the difficult experience of ageing in non-heterosexual contexts and an image obsessed culture. The film has been disseminated in Liverpool, London, and Barcelona and continues to be invited to showcase at national and international film festivals and academic platforms.
