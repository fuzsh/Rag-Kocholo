        "text": "The full programme of commissions for this May’s EuroFestival has been revealed – with events taking place at locations and venues throughout the city centre.\n\nThey include 12 giant illuminated nightingales, a simultaneous mass participation kite-flying event involving hundreds of British and Ukrainian children, a Liverpool/Ukrainian ‘supergroup’, an immersive audio experience following artists on the front line, and a contemporary media opera.\n\nEuroFestival – which runs from May 1-14 - will also include a wide range of other performances, poetry, film, exhibitions and installations.\n\nA sneak preview of the commissions earlier this spring revealed a giant blue and yellow submarine trail, a poignant installation inside Liverpool Cathedral, a simultaneous rave in Liverpool and Ukraine and English National Opera Does Eurovision.\n\nAmong the venues involved are Tate Liverpool, Invisible Wind Factory, Liverpool Everyman, the Unity Theatre, the Bluecoat, Chavasse Park and Exchange Flags, along with the EuroVillage at the Pier Head.\n\nCulture Liverpool director Claire McColgan says: “EuroFestival is unique in every sense. No other Eurovision host city has ever curated a creative programme of such scale and scope, paying homage to the culture and heritage of both Liverpool and Ukraine in the most unforgettable way.\n\n“Evocative, thought-provoking, joyous, celebratory, reflective, hopeful – these 24 commissions cover the whole gambit of emotions which will draw in the audience and make them really feel truly part of this Eurovision experience.\n\n“It’s a programme of glorious brilliance, made by artists with open hearts and the will and commitment to present a show in less than five months, to reach across countries and genres and to produce this Scouse/Ukrainian mashup of brilliance.\n\n“This is the spirit of Eurovision spilling onto our streets. Free for all. Accessible to all. Uniting us all.”\n\nEuroFestival has been made possible thanks to support from the DCMS, as well as The British Council, Spirit of 2012 and Arts Council England. The content partners are The Ukrainian Institute, the BBC, Liverpool ONE, The Liverpool BID and Royal Liverpool Albert Dock.\n\nThe Commissions\n\nProtect the Beats\n\nExchange Flags – May 1-14\n\nCompany/Artist: Whispered Tales and Denys Kashchei\n\nAs war broke out in Ukraine, everyone looked on in horror as people across the country tried to keep their loved ones safe. But it wasn’t just their loved ones they were protecting, but their culture, art and music.\n\nProtect the Beats is a work of solidarity with the people of Ukraine. A large-scale public artwork will feature a well-known Liverpool landmark – and over 2,500 sandbags. A short film, embedded in the artwork, illustrates how music remains at the beating heart of Ukrainian culture in a message of hope, joy and defiance.\n\nCreated by Whispered Tales in collaboration with the Ukrainian musician Denys Kashchei, the film features a range of footage – from opera singers to drum and bass – illustrating the power of music to unite people, even in the darkest of times.\n\nLand & Sky, Home & Dreams\n\nTower Grounds, New Brighton\n\nCompany/Artist: Go Fly Your Kite and the Junior Academy of Science Kyiv\n\nThis atmospheric performance sees children from Ukraine and Liverpool united by art in a simultaneous flying finale, representing their soaring dreams and shared aspirations.\n\nThroughout May, Go Fly Your Kite hosts inspiring kite design workshops in Liverpool, while in Ukraine, Junior Academy of Sciences creates workshops working with young people across four cities.\n\nThey will come together with schools from Liverpool City Region, to creatively illustrate their dreams and wishes onto their kites.
