        "text": "cover illustration: Fox Fisher\n\nThe Suitcase\n\nIn September 2019, we formed a writer’s room with a group of trans and non-binary young people in order to develop our script. We’d learned that a suitcase full of Hirschfeld’s papers, notebooks, letters and his death mask was found on a rubbish heap and as a group we kept coming back to this image of a suitcase full of queer history, put out with the rubbish.\n\nIn our script, the character Suitcase says the responsibility of time travel is to make the times you are living in better and to send messages of hope out so that they might reach people from the future who need them.\n\nWhat would you put in your suitcase to send a message of hope to trans and non-binary people of the future?\n\nUpload an image of your luggage along with your message to Instagram and tag #transthrutime"
