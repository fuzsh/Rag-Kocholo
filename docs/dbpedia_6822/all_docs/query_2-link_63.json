This project is a collaboration between force/collision and award-winning playwright Caridad Svich. Can we ever fully recover our queer history or will our legends be forever pressed between the pages of the archive? JARMAN brings together a community of over 40 performers through video and sound, manipulated in real time by one performer whose own story of artistic survival unravels within that of Derek Jarman’s. JARMAN will be performed by force/collision Founding Director John Moletress. Don’t miss a chance to see this incarnation of the work that has been given voice in American Theatre Magazine, Huffington Post, DC Theatre Scene, Washington Blade and DC Metro Theatre Arts. force-collision.org"
