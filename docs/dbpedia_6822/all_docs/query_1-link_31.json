        "text": "The Unity Theatre stage was turned into a mini Call My Bluff set on 8th November for a spin off game show called ‘Call My Puff’ as part of the Homotopia gay arts festival in Liverpool. The two panels and host provided a respectable amount of platinum blonde wigs, false eyelashes and feather boas, preparing the audience for a full on night of cross dressing and gay jokes ahead.\n\nThe panels consisted of Brian Ralfe (AKA drag queen legend Maisie Trollete) and Harry Hill-esque Terry Titter on Team A and Lee Tracey (AKA drag queen Vera with her dog!) and funny guy Chris Bernard on Team B with host ‘Kitty Litter’ in the middle, compete with blonde wig, elegant silk gloves and tattoos on both arms!\n\n\"The audience interaction gave the show a pantomime ‘oh no he doesn’t’ feel as the audience was split into two teams down the middle...\"\n\nA large screen behind the panellists announced the words which the guests and audience had to guess the meaning of, from two explanations given by the two people on either panel A or B. The hilarious explanations of ridiculous words along with banter from the host and rival teams gave the night a great atmosphere, with explanations of the word ‘Mauve’ (neither of which was a colour!) including posh people who may say ‘will you please mauve’ and the word ‘Bagaga’ for poor people as a reference in a Charles Dickens book!\n\nThe alternative explanations for the words were references to the so called lost language of queerdom - ‘Polari’ which is a type of slang popularised in the UK in the mid twentieth century, mainly used by gay men. Examples given in the show included ‘Fortuni’ which means gorgeous and ‘Mogue’ meaning to mislead or lie - but did the audience guess it right?\n\nAt various points in the show the drag queens got up to perform their acts, Maisie Trollete was the first to jump on stage miming to a hilarious song with the words ‘Oops goes the Spring’ that sounded like it was performed by a ‘Carry on’ era Barbra Windsor complete with giggles and ‘boings’. These were dramatised by Maisie who jumped off the seat of a chair in comedy style in time with the boings, causing her false eyelash to fall down her cleavage at one point leaving the audience in fits of laughter!\n\nThe audience interaction gave the show a pantomime ‘oh no he doesn’t’ feel as the audience was split into two teams down the middle and asked to hold up ‘true’ or ‘bluff’ cards in a Ready Steady Cook styley. Call my bluff always looks so easy on TV but I was rubbish and when Vera told me that Bagaga was a Polari slang term for a mans privates I believed her - but it turned out she was bluffing, shouting to the crowd “Like you’re book readers, we are in Liverpool!” I think our team lost?\n\nKitty Litter ended the show with a drag act to remember, singing ‘This is my life’ to claps from the audience, pulling out a fake boob in a comic performance, dancing around the stage in a feather boa and ballroom style dress, Lilly Savage wig and fake diamond jewellery! Organisers say that Kitty’s razor sharp wit has led to many to tip her as the next Lilly Savage, she was witty shouting to the contestants “shut up or I’ll do yer make up!” in a gruff northern voice!"
