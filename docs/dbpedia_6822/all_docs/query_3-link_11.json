The exhibition also explores the impact of national events such as Section 28 (legislation which banned local authorities from producing and distributing material promoting homosexuality, or promoting the acceptability of homosexuality ‘as a pretended family relationship’), civil partnerships, marriage, age of consent equality, and equal adoption rights.\n\nDirector of the Museum of Liverpool, Janet Dugdale said:\n\nExhibition highlights include:\n\nA collection of objects and interviews related to The Magic Clock; a pub which was close to Liverpool’s Queen Square and part of an underground gay scene between 1940 and the 60s.\n\nArtworks such as Wheel of Fortune by Yankel Feather and drag queen portraits by Liverpool artist, Ben Youdan.\n\nAn opportunity to watch and listen to the experiences of LGBT+ people living in the city. The voices span five decades and include a film of DJ Pete Price and Roger Merchant talking about gay aversion therapy. Pete underwent it in mid 1960s, while Roger, a gay man, was a nurse who assisted during therapy.\n\nSection 28 protest material from Liverpool’s LGBT+ community.\n\nLiverpool Pride material; including a flyer from Liverpool’s first Gay Pride Week in 1979, flyers from later Prides in the early 1990s and T-shirts, banners and promotional material from recent official Pride events in the 2000s.\n\nOrder of service from the UK’s first same sex civil partnership on religious premises at Ullet Road Unitarian Church, Liverpool.\n\nBrookside sign, accompanied by the story of the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss by writer, Shaun Duggan.\n\nA selection of costumes including Holly Johnson’s Vivienne Westwood suit, Lily Savage’s snow leopard outfit and local trans artist and activist, Sophie Green’s wedding dress.\n\nHomotopia Artistic Director, Gary Everett said:\n\nTales from the city runs until late 2018.\n\nwww.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/talesfromthecity\n\n#LGBTtales\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nMuseum of Liverpool\n\nThe Museum of Liverpool is one of the country’s most visited museums outside of London.
