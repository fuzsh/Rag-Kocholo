        "text": "This article argues that we are currently experiencing a renaissance of New Queer Cinema (NQC). The original NQC occurred in the early 1990s, which saw a wave of queer films that were successful on the mainstream international film festival circuit, at venues such as Cannes and Sundance. Queer film scholars, such as Michele Aaron and B. Ruby Rich, have argued that films like Paris is Burning (Livingston, 1991), Poison (Haynes, 1991) and Swoon (Kalin, 1992) were united by their sense of defiance. They represented the marginalized within the contemporary LGBT communities. This article looks at recent films such as Weekend (Haigh, 2011), Stranger by the Lake (Guiraudie, 2013), Appropriate Behaviour (Akhavan, 2014), Pariah (Rees, 2011) and the work of Xavier Dolan as being successful queer-themed films that meet the criteria outlined by scholars of NQC. Their success will be determined by their representation in both queer and non-queer film festival circuits and beyond. They respond to the state of contemporary independent cinema and utilize film form to allow for the accessibility of their queer characters. In their own way, they are defiant against mainstream queer representations and demonstrate a resurgence of films that service a community that is in need of queer intellectual stimulation.\n\nProposing a radical vision of cinema's queer globalism, Karl Schoonover and Rosalind Galt explore how queer filmmaking intersects with international sexual cultures, geopolitics, and aesthetics to disrupt dominant modes of world making. Whether in its exploration of queer cinematic temporality, the paradox of the queer popular, or the deviant ecologies of the queer pastoral, Schoonover and Galt reimagine the scope of queer film studies. The authors move beyond the gay art cinema canon to consider a broad range of films from Chinese lesbian drama and Swedish genderqueer documentary to Bangladeshi melodrama and Bolivian activist video. Schoonover and Galt make a case for the centrality of queerness in cinema and trace how queer cinema circulates around the globe–institutionally via film festivals, online consumption, and human rights campaigns, but also affectively in the production of a queer sensorium. In this account, cinema creates a uniquely potent mode of queer worldliness, one that disrupts normative ways of being in the world and forges revised modes of belonging.\n\n[Introduction to the special dossier Pride on the Margins] Queer cinema exists on a spectrum, with films that have crossover appeal to mainstream audiences (such as Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Céline Sciamma, 2019)) on one end and niche films for queer audiences—from Fig Trees (John Greyson, 2009) to Another Gay Movie (Todd Stephens, 2006)—on the other. This dossier presents an array of case studies of films that rely heavily on the queer film festival circuit for reaching their audience. This mode of distribution does not necessarily seek interest or approval from heteronormative film culture. In this dossier, we propose that this mode of queer spectatorship mobilises and draws value from its own marginality. Through several case studies, we argue that the curation of these events are affective experiences that momentarily bind queer histories and audiences together in the moment of their projection. We have both written extensively on the queer film festival as a cultural phenomenon. Stuart Richards has analysed the queer film festival as a social enterprise to examine how these festivals need to consider social, economic and environmental sustainability.1 Antoine Damiens draws an alternative history of queer film festivals to question ‘the theoretical and political narratives implied in current festival scholarship.’2 We both advocate for queer film festivals to ensure that transgressive film practices flourish. The values of such film are core to the queer film festival’s social mission.\n\nElsewhere, I have proposed a new, hybrid school of theory that hopefully has incredible potential in application with film, and this essay will apply praxis to theory. I claim a mode of analysis engaged with the queer ecosemiotics of film, and this essay will rework the foundations of that mode as well as relate it to three films from class this semester: A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001), Johanna d’Arc of Mongolia (1989), and Avatar (2009).\n\nThe ubiquity of gender-bending and sexually ambiguous imagery in the media seems to herald a post-gay era. But are LGBT/Q identities and representation politics really a thing of the past? Inspection of the circulation patterns of LGBT/Q images on a global scale suggests a more nuanced story. Taking the lead from distribution and film festival studies, in this essay I sketch out how LGBT/Q images travel around the world. The festival network was always an alternative channel to mainstream work. Therefore, I pay particular attention to the international film festival circuit with its art film bias, on one hand, and activist festivals, such as LGBT/Q film festivals and their LGBT/Q-themed films, on the other. Utilizing Lisa Henderson’s notion of “queer relay” I argue that the relationship between the queer film ecosystem and the larger art film circuit is highly ambivalent. The deployed art film strategies reveal that we have not yet arrived at actual acceptance and universality in a post-gay, post-identitarian world. However, the positions on the side of distinction and cultural capital do not just lean towards exploitation of queer subcultural productions by neoliberal forces but offer also a relay position that accounts for queer agency in the wider cultural arena.\n\nThis project collects empirical qualitative data from non-binary filmmakers and motion picture creators with the purpose of understanding how a filmmaker’s lived experience of having a non-binary gender identity affects their filmmaking production and their experiences in the motion picture industries. Through interviewing five non binary filmmakers and drawing from established theoretical frameworks (such as gender theory, minority studies, empirical cultural studies, and participatory ethnography) this project found that having a non-binary gender can affect a filmmaker’s experience (to a greater or lesser extent) in a number of ways, including motivation, narrative topics, economics, and the desire for independence and creative freedom. Though the majority of the subjects started out by creating non-fiction documentary media about the experience of being transgender, most of them were interested in branching out to projects that feature non-binary characters (while not focusing explicitly on the experiences of being a non-binary person) in such forms as fictional narratives, music videos, and experimental films. The filmmakers see the potential of non-binary representation to function as positive activism for the normalisation of non-binary people by promoting empathy and compassion for this minority group, normalising their existence and experiences. Keywords: Non-binary, transgender, filmmakers, film industry, motion picture, media.\n\nThe following article investigates the origins and functions of particular settings in queer films by examining four examples from different national contexts: Shortbus (dir. John Cameron Mitchell, US, 2006), Weekend (dir. Andrew Haigh, UK, 2011), Stranger by the Lake (L’inconnu du lac, dir. Alain Guiraudie, France, 2013), and Tropical Malady (Sud pralad, dir. Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand, 2004). The textual analyses highlight a range of prevalent queer film settings, such as the road and nature, in which queer characters take refuge. The study aims to identify a transnational countercultural stance in various uses of setting by concentrating on the notion of escape in a theoretical framework that draws on the work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, José Muñoz, and Marc Augé. In the context of the study, the production of alternative spaces in queer cinema is treated as a revolutionary practice that challenges homophobia and heteronormativity, which sometimes coexist with class inequality and racism. The discussion finally suggests that there is a social critique of civilization behind the escapism and pessimism, as well as utopianism, in queer cinema. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tv88UNAlY9cVqFCCK-HVcoWM9HvzVNyp/view?usp=sharing https://askucuk.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/queer-film-settings.pdf https://doi.org/10.1215/02705346-8359530\n\nThis essay connects Sarah Schulman's discussion of aesthetic gentrification in The Gentrification of the Mind with the concept of disruptive innovation to analyse patterns in recent mainstream film exploring LGBTQ histories. Since the Great Recession, LGBTQ cinema in the Global North has become structured by disruptive narrative strategies that reroute the transformative power of queer and transgender histories upward and away from the most at-risk LGBTQ populations. Films such as Dallas Buyers Club, Stonewall, and The Danish Girl purport to represent 'actual' moments in LGBTQ history, but instead appropriate aesthetic space from communities with little to no cultural representation-HIV positive, working-class, and of colour, queer and trans populations-instead offering that space to symbolic gentrifiers. Cultural erasure of AIDS activism and of trans people's important roles in LGBTQ histories and politics are among the most deleterious shared outcomes of this new wave of cinema. This essay contends that historical disruption and resulting aesthetic gentrification of queer and trans cinema in the Global North has potentially global implications for the future of LGBTQ representation."
