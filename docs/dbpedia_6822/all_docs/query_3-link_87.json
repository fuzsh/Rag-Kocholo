        "text": "A FAG (Feminist Art Gallery) Satellite Project\n\nParticipating Artists:\n\nCecilia Berkovic\n\nMichèle Pearson Clarke\n\nSharlene Bamboat and Ali El Darsa\n\nJesi the Elder\n\nFASTWURMS\n\nDeirdre Logue\n\nHazel Meyer\n\nAllyson Mitchell\n\nHeidi Nagtegaal\n\nRadiodress (Reena Katz)\n\nAbstract Random (Ayo Leilani, Jamilah Malika, Sun Sun)\n\nDana Bishop Root and Ginger Brooks Takahashi\n\nChris E. Vargas\n\nSyrus Marcus Ware\n\nChristina Zeidler\n\nPart of the Complex Social Change Series\n\nScheduled Events:\n\nJanuary 24 – 12 pm\n\nArt Now Speaker Series – Recital Hall W570\n\nJanuary 24 – 2 – 4 pm\n\nInformal Discussion – Room W857\n\nFeminist Art Gallery\n\nWe conclude the first phase of the Complex Social Change series with a project from the Feminist Art Gallery (FAG). Their stubborn, playful, inventive focus on contemporary feminist issues and gender identity could not be more necessary than at a time when people continue to say “we don’t need feminism anymore” or claim that “ [insert feminist statistic or analysis] seems blown out of proportion.” Even more insidious are the subtle forms of sexism that continue to thrive. The two people at the core of FAG, Allyson Mitchell and Deirdre Logue, asked that their names not be featured in the promotion and are instead are included in the list of 20 artists participating in the exhibition. They are both successful artists with international careers, as well as significant day jobs, and it is precisely for this reason that they did not want to be featured ahead of or above the diverse, emerging artists who they aim to support by including whenever their reputation earns them an invitation to produce a project. Pointing out sexist language and structures is not sufficient to make change, one has to change the assumptions and practices – alter the discourse and the discursive formation – in order to create a major shift and to make that change lasts.\n\nPerhaps the most radical action that FAG takes is to put into place models based on collective practice in order to undermine the negative, competitive notion of striving for lone success and climbing over others (or pulling the ladder up once you make it to the top). This approach goes to the heart of what the Complex Social Change group at the U of L is hoping to achieve. We want to focus on successful areas of social change, such as the strides that feminism has made in our society, but also create more productive, more inviting ways of conducting the research into these issues and then engaging with others to discuss them. Along with collaborative artistic approaches, we have also been inspired by the Matsutake Worlds Research Group who use an attractive metaphor to describe and shape the way collaborative work is conducted. They move away from the tree-like imagery often used to depict the scholarly process (with its various disciplinary ‘branches’), instead employing a micorrhizal metaphor—symbiotic structures formed between fungi and tree roots that nourish the fungi, and provide essential nitrogen for the tree. The manner in which the fungi entangle themselves with the tree’s roots is a form of collaboration that allows the plant’s roots to diversify into multiple different strands. This tangle of fungus and roots then cooperates with other microbes to dissolve the soil, creating new strata and changing the very nature of the landscape.\n\nThe Complex Social Change group views the U of L Art Gallery as the micorrhizal structure that melds with the roots of the university, assembling new landscapes of interest, and allowing creative new forms of scholarly endeavour—the fruiting bodies of the fungus—to bloom. In this way, we answer the call of Matustake Worlds: “Might we use the heady rush of creativity and charisma, but plow it back into the scholarly process rather than toward the fetish of individual brilliance?” I hope that this approach is evident in the diverse voices present in “We Can’t Compete” and that visitors to the gallery are encouraged to join the discussion raised by the art works included in the exhibition.\n\n– Josephine Mills,\n\nDirector/Curator, U of L Art Gallery\n\nWE CAN’T COMPETE\n\nWE CAN’T COMPETE is the title of this exhibition and a mantra of the FAG Feminist Art Gallery.\n\nFAG is – a response, a process, a site, a protest, an outcry, an exhibition, a performance, an economy, a conceptual framework, a place and an opportunity. We host we fund we advocate we support we claim. FAG has a geographical footprint located in Toronto, Canada and is run by artists Allyson Mitchell and Deirdre Logue.\n\nWE CAN’T COMPETE is the first articulation of the Feminist Art Collection (FAC) and is comprised of collected art works as well as materials and documentation from social sculptures and happenings at the FAG over the past four years.\n\nWE CAN’T COMPETE/WE WON’T COMPETE\n\nWE CAN’T KEEP UP/WE WON’T KEEP DOWN\n\nThese statements are an acknowledgement of the dilemmas of feminist and queer cultural participation and describe the all too familiar push/pull of working across discourses and converging dialogues. This push/pull activates us to take risks. The opportunity offered through Complex Social Change and the University of Lethbridge Art Gallery is one of these risks. They pulled us into this setting and structure (a gallery, a university, an art space, a budget) and they have offered us the chance to test new models within those parameters -to challenge the system and the audience. And now we are pushing to create an exhibition that is inclusive, that recognizes artists at every stage in their careers, offers opportunities for publication, supports their work, and makes them visible within an academic, public and social framework fulfilling FAG’s desire to make artists who are almost always invisible- visible.\n\nThe economies of art institutions and the powers that dominate the art world do not champion, or recognize artists working from the margins. It is this truth and injustice that prompted the creation of the Feminist Art Collection. FAC is as much an archive as it is an intervention into the economic hierarchies that fail to value feminist and queer artists (including artist of colour, women artists, Aboriginal artists, trans artists and artists with disability/ies).\n\nThe FAC starts at home as a deterritorialized body of feminist art collected through an interactional network of artists and enablers in support of queer and feminist cultural production. Art that enters into the FAC is bought from the artists and exists in the care of an enabler. Institutions (like the University of Lethbridge) that borrow from the FAC enter into a declaration of participation, a social contract that acknowledges the value of the artwork and ensures the artist will be paid for the exhibition of the work. The FAC does not contain, possess, and capitalize on artists.\n\nAs this young collection grows we struggle with the language for feminist description. How do we describe an object or image or sound piece as feminist and/or queer? All of the art in this exhibition incorporates text. Words, lyrics, letters, statements. This entry point may be one of the least complicated ways to begin this communication.\n\nThe collection is forming and becoming. It exists in the near future. The FAC manifesto is on the tip of our tongues and can be felt inside these gallery walls. Feel it.\n\n– FAG (Feminist Art Gallery)\n\nWe Can’t Compete Participating Artists Bios:\n\nCecilia Berkovic\n\nCecilia Berkovic is a Toronto-based visual artist and designer who uses strategies of collecting and displaying to explore aspects of feminism, consumer culture, leisure and queer identity. Her work includes poster projects, publishing, photography and installation. She sits on the Board of Directors at Gallery TPW in Toronto and received her MFA from Bard College in New York.\n\nMichèle Pearson Clarke\n\nMichèle Pearson Clarke is a Trinidad-born media artist working predominantly in photography, video and performance. Recent projects include the photo series It’s Good to Be Needed (2013), documentary shorts The Grief Trilogy (2012) and Diplomatic Communication, a commissioned photographic project presented at Axe Grinding Workshop, part of the Civil Partnerships? Queer and Feminist Curating conference at The Tate Modern in May 2012. NOW Magazine’s Cameron Bailey named Michèle one of Toronto’s 10 best Filmmakers of the Year in 2006, and the following year she won the Best Canadian Female Short Award at the Inside Out Toronto LGBT Film and Video Festival for her video, Black Men and Me. Michèle has served on the board of directors for the Inside Out LGBT Film and Video Festival and Trinity Square Video and she was a jury member for the Ontario Association of Art Galleries annual awards in 2010. Currently Michèle is on the boards of the Feminist Art Gallery and Gallery 44, and is pursuing an MFA in Documentary Media Studies at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSharlene Bamboat and Ali El Darsa\n\nSharlene Bamboat is a Toronto-based artist, working predominantly in film, video and performance. Her work calls into question narratives of diaspora, citizenship and nation building. Through a re-examination of history, Bamboat elicits tongue-in-cheek performative videos and installations to question our contemporary moment marked by colonialism and neoliberalism. Transgressing the rigid boundaries of both identity and the canon of moving image work, Bamboat inserts her queer body into site-specific locations in video and performative installations in order to question narratives that structure how we imagine bodies should belong within spaces. Using humour, subcultural practices, and discourses of art activism, Bamboat’s work also explores themes of cultural hybridity through the conditions of globalization that structure relocation and migration. Bamboat regularly works in collaboration with artists and academics. Her most regular collaborative partner is artist Alexis Mitchell, and together they form Bambitchell. Bamboat’s other collaborative ventures include the 2012 installation, Throwback, with the Feminist Art Gallery (FAG) and artist Ali El-Darsa, and recently a collaborative group project curated by Erin Silver called TAG TEAM: Gay Premises exhibited in Toronto, in the summer of 2013.\n\nAli El-Darsa, Lebanese-born Montreal-based, works in video, performance, installation and printmaking. His work examines associated temporal and spatial dimensions within a media context and a cultural landscape, where notions of absence, identity politics, intimacy, and transience have acquired new meanings. His latest performance piece, That tree you claimed your throne employs interactive sound and lighting design to express a view of exile from a meditative stance. It actively calls for an audience to listen to a reading of words as they lose their meaning over time due to repetition. El-Darsa’s collaborative work include Crossover, a performance with Bogota-based artist, Carlos Romero Maria, and Throwback with Toronto-based artist, Sharlene Bamboat. Crossover, highlights a contemporary social discourse of ‘queer’ identity, while Throwback responds to queer archiving, specifically the lack of migrant bodies/stories/histories within queer North American art production. His latest installation, “”Standing Still”” in collaboration with sound artist Solomiya Moroz examines Griffintown’s current social condition and evolving identity in the midst of rapid urban redevelopment by looking at its architecture as a site of collective memory in relationship to the human body. His work has been internationally exhibited.\n\nJesi the Elder\n\nJesi The Elder is a self-taught animator born in Toronto in 1985. After a couple of years of making work for Katie Stelmanis, she established her career as a music video artist, making videos for talents such as Owen Palette, Timber Timbre, DDMMYYYY, and Brendan Canning from Broken Social Scene. Besides animating, Jesi is an avid painter, sculpture, comic book artist, and Psychic.\n\nFASTWURMS\n\nFormed in 1979 by Kim Kozzi and Dai Skuse, FASTWURMS is the trademark and joint authorship of these Toronto/Creemore- based multidisciplinary artists whose artwork melds high and popular cultures, bent identity politics, social exchange and a Witch positive DIY cinematic sensibility. FASTWURMS has exhibited and created public commissions and installations, performance, video and film projects, across Canada and in the United States, Europe, Korea, and Japan. FASTWURMS’ cultural politics are complex and strategically subversive, their critical aesthetics relational and inclusive with a bent towards working class, craft collaborations, and queer alliance.\n\nDeirdre Logue\n\nFor the past 20 years Canadian artist Deirdre Logue has been prolific and steadfast in her engagement with the moving image and has subsequently produced upwards of 60 short films and videos as well as some of this country’s most celebrated video art installations. Diving deep into the unconscious, Logue’s recorded performances are a tangle of fragmentation, perversion, symbiosis and psychic unrest. Uniquely located on the golden mean between excess and deficiency, self-liberation and self-annihilation, her works are at once unruly and uncanny. Logue holds a BFA from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and an MFA from Kent State University. Recent solo exhibitions of her award winning work have taken place at Open Space in Victoria, Oakville Galleries, the Images Festival in Toronto, the Berlin International Film Festival, Beyond/In Western New York, YYZ and at articule in Montreal. She was a founding member of Media City, the Executive Director of the Images Festival, Executive Director of the CFMDC and is currently the Development Director at Vtape. Logue also directs the F.A.G. Feminist Art Gallery with her partner/collaborator Allyson Mitchell.\n\nHazel Meyer\n\nHazel Meyer is an artist and sports enthusiast based in Toronto. She draws pictures, text and comics, makes letterpress prints, screen-printed multiples, felt banners, broadcasts, and constructs physical environments that are used for performance, collaboration, workshops and amateur athletics. From the monumental to the modest her projects range from immersive installations, to small woven tags meant for an audience of one. Much like the tag line of The Litter Game, a collaborative project she started with Lucy Pawlak and Jim Skuldt in 2013, her practice is devoted to a forever shifting ratio of endurance, transgression, and laughs, as ways of being in one’s body and the world. She holds an MFA from OCAD University (Toronto), a BFA from Concordia University (Montréal) and has recently had her work included in Separation Penetrates at Dutch Art Institute (Netherlands), More Than Two (Let It Make Itself), curated by Micah Lexier, PowerPlant, (Toronto), No Theory No Cry at Art Metropole (Toronto), Schlaegermusik with Annesley Black for Zukunftsmusik (Stuttgart), Walls to the Ball at La Centrale (Montréal), All Hands on the Archive: An Audience of Enablers Cannot Fail, with Logan MacDonald at F.A.G. (Toronto), and flex your textile, John Conelley presents (New York).\n\nAllyson Mitchell\n\nAllyson Mitchell is a maximalist artist working in sculpture, performance, installation, and film. Her ongoing aesthetic/political project, “Deep Lez” advocates a strategic return to the histories of lesbian feminism for it’s radical queer world making potential. Her work has exhibited in numerous venues including the Textile Museum of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Warhol Museum, Tate Modern and the British Film Institute. She is based in Toronto, where she is an Assistant Professor in the School of Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies at York University.\n\nHeidi Nagtegaal\n\nHeidi Nagtegaal lives and works in/from/with Hammock Residency, on unceded Coast Salish Territories.\n\nHammock Residency lives and breathes, and unfolds in residencies of 2-3 months, takes students at The School Of The Free Hammock for 2-3 years, and is interested in Buying The House with the current roommates and cast of decentralized housemate members in 2014.\n\nRadiodress (Reena Katz)\n\nReena Katz aka Radiodress uses live and recorded talking, whispering, singing, yelling and listening to consider bodies as sites of knowledge, and communication as a social and political practice. Through audience participation in public spaces, Katz highlights the relationship between collective voice and the empathic act of listening. Her projects have been performed, played and exhibited widely in North America and Europe. Katz’s web-based audio project, embodied arts collective assembly was commissioned by the Vera List Centre for Art and Politics on the occasion of their 20th Anniversary year. Her recent project, love takes the worry out of being close: public assemblies in bed with queers premiered in April at Harbourfront Centre in Toronto as part of the 2013 HATCH Residency. Katz is currently the Acting Director of Galerie SAW Gallery, a multi-lingual artist-run center in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nAbstract Random (Ayo Leilani, Jamilah Malika, Sun Sun)\n\nAbstract Random is a rap electro dub hop mashup infused with feminist politics.
