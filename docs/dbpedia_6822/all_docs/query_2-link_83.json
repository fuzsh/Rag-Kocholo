L8 0XA\n\nWhen: Saturday 26th November 2022 | 16.30-18.30\n\nTickets: £5 from Eventbrite\n\nSing with Daughter of Arabia, Camille Maalawy\n\nJoin Camille Maalawy for a choir performance workshop, which explores Arabic folk song, Andalusian Muwashshah and some well known songs of the great Arabic singers such as Um Kulthum and Fairuz. This workshop will take place Merseyside Yemeni Community Association in the heart of Toxteth.\n\nNo previous knowledge of Arabic or Arabic music is needed. Everything will be transliterated.\n\nCamille Maalawy is a Mezzo Soprano – classical, Arabic and world music performer; singing teacher and animateur based in Kingston Upon Hull.

To challenge helplessness and to facilitate action to change, to become better world citizens, we have a duty and responsibility to channel important messages to the wider world.\n\nThe production does not give an answer, rather it questions the public and encourages us (the audience) to find our own answers by expiring and reflecting on our positions and our actions towards oppression, injustice and complexity.\n\nAbout Love in the Time of Apartheid:\n\nLove in the Time of Apartheid premiered at Liverpool Arab Arts Festival and presents the start of internal conflict of an individual torn between the love for his homeland and the love for his partner. Through a rollercoaster of insomnia, stress, torment, and defiance, the dancer draws on his own personal story to represent that of thousands of Palestinians who struggle for family reunification.\n\nPerformances sponsored by the Arts Council, British Council, Liverpool Arab Arts Festival and Interpal.\n\nHow to Watch:\n\nCurfew & Love in the Time of Apartheid will be available to watch on Unity Online until the 31st October 2022.\n\nWatch this film for £6: You can watch the show through Vimeo for just £6, by clicking the Watch Now button.

How are these archives accessed, who has access and what are the ethics of working with them (or not)?\n\nMultifaceted objects and visual documents, which are enmeshed in Europe’s colonial interventions in North Africa and its postcolonial resonances are held in family archives. Artists and researchers from North Africa and its globally dispersed diaspora as well as from the formerly coloniser countries return to these objects to access not only a part of family history, but also to take a glance at historically determined asymmetric relations between the Global North and the Global South.\n\nModerated by Jessica El Mal, A.MAL presents a discussion into this topic from the perspective of food historian Salma Serry of Sufra Kitchen, artist Imane Zoubai and media scholar Elodie Sacher. The diverse perspectives offered by the panel offer timely insight into the use of family archives.\n\nFor more information please visit: www.arabartsfestival.com/events/a-mal-presents-working-with-family-archives-from-north-africa/\n\nWorking with Family Archives, An Encounter\n\nOnline workshop\n\nSat July 16\n\n11:00am – 1:00pm BST\n\nBOOK HERE\n\nJessica El Mal and Elodie Sacher of A.MAL will guide you through a digital space for a fruitful exchange about exemplary approaches to working with family archives. Workshop participants will be invited to upload something from their family archive into a Google Drive before the workshop – this could be a picture, a recipe, a video, an audio track – anything. During the workshop, we will explore these items through discussion and writing activities, to question if and how we can encounter such objects, and what this means for the future.\n\nFor more information visit: https://www.arabartsfestival.com/events/working-with-family-archives-an-encounter/\n\nA.MAL is an art and research initiative exploring ecology, migration and globalization through speculative art and research projects. We cast a critical eye on past and present global issues while seeking to harness human connection and creativity to imagine a better, more hopeful future – always questioning, always exploring. We are keen to contextualize ecological concerns within contemporary global – in particular post-colonial – relations and climate justice in the context of North Africa.\n\nIt creates opportunities for collaboration and experimentation through paid artist residencies, paying for workshops and talks, and touring exhibitions across Europe/North Africa. We bring emerging artists and mid-career artists and creatives from Europe, North Africa and the diaspora, to engage in reciprocal learning and experience sharing.\n\nA.MAL have collaborated with ONCA (Brighton, UK), International Lost Species Day, Dardishi (Scotland), P21 Gallery (London), Liverpool Arab Arts Festival (UK), The Arab British Center (London), Le Cube (Rabat), Pikala Bikes (Marrakech), Mahal (Tangiers) and the Africa/UK: Transforming Art Ecologies from New Art Exchange (Nottingham), as well as a wide network of individual artists across Morocco and Europe.\n\n​​@a.mal_projects\n\nImage: Grandfather’s photo album picturing his travels through Morocco in the 1960s, courtesy of Elodie Sacher.\n\nA Day in the Life – Arabic\n\nA Day in the Life consent form – Arabic\n\nIf you’re an aspiring writer of Arab heritage, you need to know about a new international poetry and short story competition – with £1,000 worth of prizes to be won.\n\nThe A Day in the Life competition is being launched by Liverpool Hope University in conjunction with Liverpool Arab Arts Festival.\n\nEntrants of Arab heritage, under the age of 21, are being invited to submit either a poem, short story or video clip which shines a light on an aspect, either positive or negative, of their life in the Liverpool City Region.\n\nIt could be related to school, work, community or leisure time, and should give a snapshot of a typical 24 hours in the person’s life.\n\nApplicants can use whatever medium they’d like – whether it’s written word, short video, a rap or a link to their TikTok or any other social media clip.\n\nBoth the Palestinian Writers Union and the Jordanian Writers Society are also hosting their own A Day in the Life competitions in their native countries, and delegates from each will Zoom-in to a special winners’ ceremony held in Liverpool in July during this year’s Liverpool Arab Arts Festival.\n\nProfessor Michael Lavalette, Dean of the School of Social Sciences at Hope, said: “This is a great opportunity for aspiring young writers and creative thinkers. What we really want to see are poems or short stories that really offer a window into someone’s lived experience. There are no restrictions as to what you might address – this is about how you interpret a day in your own life. Applicants can use a variety of mediums to capture their thoughts, whether it’s a written poem or short story, or whether you turn those ideas into a video or social media snippet. For me, the cross-national element of the competition is really exciting. Both Liverpool Hope University and LAAF are committed to fostering links between communities, and we hope this is a way to build further bridges. Of course the prize money isn’t bad, either!”\n\nAfrah Qassim, Chair of LAAF, said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with Liverpool Hope University on this great initiative. Our 2022 festival theme is points of connection between cultures and this project encapsulates this wonderfully. From writing to video and audio clips, we can’t wait to see the creative responses in this cross-national competition.”\n\nThere will be two categories for applicants in Liverpool:\n\n16 years and under\n\n17 to 21 years\n\nPrizes are as follows: 1st: £250 2nd: £150 3rd: £100.\n\nThe UK competition will be judged by experts from Hope and Liverpool Arab Arts Festival and its community partners, with the winner announced during the organisation’s big summer spectacular on Wednesday July 13th.\n\nOne of those judges will be the award-winning poet Dr Eleanor Rees, who is also Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at Hope.\n\nAmong the panel of judges from LAAF are prize-winning Yemeni novelist Hamdan Dammag and Amina Atiq, a Yemeni- Scouse poet, performance artist, creative practitioner and award-winning community activist.\n\nThe big reveal will take place at Liverpool Hope University’s Great Hall, located at the city centre Creative Campus, on Wednesday July 13th, as part of Liverpool Arab Arts Festival.\n\nFounded in 1998, Liverpool Arab Arts Festival is the UK’s longest-running annual Arab arts and culture festival, platforming the best UK and international Arab artists. The festival creates a dynamic between traditional and contemporary Arab artforms, encouraging informed debate that explores, and increases, appreciation of Arab people and their rich cultures. Liverpool Arab Arts Festival’s work continues throughout the year, with a wide range of events and participatory projects that bring together artists and diverse communities. From Liverpool to the Arab world, LAAF builds connections that help more people to encounter and experience Arab culture in Liverpool and beyond. The year-round programme of artistic and cultural events includes Liverpool Arab Arts Festival, which runs this year from Thursday 7 – Sunday 17 July 2022. Liverpool Arab Arts Festival is an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation.\n\nMurad Sudani, General Secretary of the Palestinian Writers Union, said of the A Day in the Life initiative: “This competition is a great opportunity for young people in Palestine, Jordan and Liverpool to learn from each other and about each other’s lives. It is the first, but hopefully not the last, shared competition between students in our countries.”\n\nMeanwhile the Jordanian Writers Society is chaired by Muhammed Khudair, a celebrated and multi award-winning poet.\n\n**\n\nTerms and conditions\n\nThe competition is open to those of Arab heritage either living in the Liverpool City Region (as well as separately in Palestine and Jordan).\n\nAny video-based submissions must be either one minute in duration, or less.\n\nAny written submissions must be of a maximum permitted 500 words in length.\n\nCategories for applicants are as follows:\n\n1) 16 years and under\n\n2) 17 to 21 years\n\nPrizes are as follows, for each age group: 1st: £250 2nd: £150 3rd: £100.\n\nFull details can be found at https://www.hope.ac.uk/socialsciences/adayinthelifecompetition\n\nTo submit your application by emailing adayinthelife@hope.ac.uk.\n\nPlease include a filled-in Competition Consent Form, which can be found at: https://www.hope.ac.uk/socialsciences/adayinthelifecompetition\n\nPlease also include contact details for either yourself or your legal guardian.\n\nThe closing date for submissions for applicants from Liverpool is midnight Friday June 17th.\n\n10 finalists from each entry category will be invited with their families to the event on Wednesday July 13th during Liverpool Arab Arts Festival 2022.\n\nWinners will be announced on the day of the event – if you can’t be there on the day, please nominate someone to collect the award for you.\n\nPrize money will be awarded either via bank transfer or cheque, or, if the applicant is claiming asylum, via a gift card."
