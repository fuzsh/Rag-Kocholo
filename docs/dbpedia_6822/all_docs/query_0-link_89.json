        "text": "The Society of Akron Graduate English Scholars is pleased to announce a call for papers for its upcoming interdisciplinary conference on April 28, 2016. We welcome creative writers and scholars from various disciplines to discuss the theme, \"Hysteria.\" This free conference is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nWe invite scholarship and reflection addressing one or more elements of hysteria and its historical and cultural context.\n\n\"Every day people perform dozens of rituals. These range from religious rituals to the rituals of everyday life, from the rituals of life roles to the rituals of each profession, from the rituals of politics and the judicial system to the rituals of business or home life. Even animals perform rituals\" (Richard Schechner, Performance Studies: An Introduction 3rd ed. 52).\n\n\"Sermon Studies\" is a new, peer-reviewed online journal sponsored by Marshall University. We are seeking articles on Jewish, Christian, and Islamic preaching written from a range of disciplinary perspectives, including literature, linguistics, religious studies, history, theology, anthropology, rhetoric, and communication studies. For more information or to submit an article, please visit the journal's website at http://mds.marshall.edu/sermonstudies/.\n\nSlavoj Žižek has suggested that, after the spectacular failure of party-states in the twentieth century, it is no longer time for the Left to change the world, but again to interpret it. Of course, Žižek's directive comes in the wake of popular anti-capitalist and anti-racist revolts around the world which have reinvigorated militants and scholars alike: from New York to Cairo, Kobanî to Ferguson. There is, evidently, no easy division between action and interpretation, even in the absence of any major world power designating itself as Communist. And yet, Žižek's plea must be a tempting one for those working in the current, increasingly globalized university system.\n\nWomen and Work in Literature: Special Session, Pacific Ancient & Modern Language Association Conference, November 11-13, 2016, Pasadena, California\n\nSession Description:\n\nHow do writers represent the work of being women—where \"work\" is defined broadly to encompass not only paid labor inside and outside the home, but also the work of performing femininity and domesticity? How do writers address social assumptions about who should be performing work, and for what purpose? How do race, class, sexuality and national identity affect women's ability to define both the meaning of their work and their ability to engage in work?\n\nThis regular session welcomes 300-500 word abstracts on any aspect of African American Literature and Culture for the 73rd Annual South Central Modern Language Association (SCMLA) Conference November 3-5, 2016.\n\nAbstracts relating directly to the conference theme \"The Spectacular City: Glamour, Decadence, and Celebrity in Literature and Culture\" are also encouraged.\n\nThe conference will be held at the Sheraton Dallas Hotel 400 N. Olive Street in the Dallas Arts District.\n\nPlease submit an abstract and a CV to Carol Bunch Davis at davisc@tamug.edu by March 18, 2016.\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\nKate Newell (Savannah College of Art and Design)\n\nArthur Little (UCLA)\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS\n\n\"Adapt or perish, now as ever, is nature's inexorable imperative\" - HG Wells\n\n\"Every major rap artist in the world samples, you know? That's all I'm doing, is sampling.\" - Vanilla Ice on similarities between \"Under Pressure\" and \"Ice Ice Baby\"\n\nIn the preface to Borderlands, Gloria Anzaldúa declares: \"I am a border woman.\" As simple as it sounds, this statement suggests the individual's agency in the social and cultural production of personal identity as it boldly rejects to acknowledge the power of the state in the process. Migration and border-crossing today present serious political, social and cultural challenges, which force countries to craft policies to address security, economic, and humanitarian concerns. The migration crisis in Europe offers a new perspective on the development of migrant identity in this ever-changing relationship between the individual and the host country."
