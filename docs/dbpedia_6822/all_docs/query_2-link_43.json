Many other books are available OA as PDF files. The publishers of the books determine the licensing terms under which the books are made available.\n\nBooks may change their status on MUSE from paid access to OA, at the request of the publisher. Some books previously sold in collections may become OA; these titles will be delivered with their original collection(s) but are no longer included in the pricing for future sales.\n\nUse the links in the Discovery section above to download a title list, KBART file and MARC Records for the open access books:\n\nBig Ten Open Books\n\nProject MUSE is pleased to host the Gender and Sexuality Studies collection of open access book titles, from the Big Ten Open Books project. The project is a collaboration between the university presses and libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance. The works included in the collection have all been previously published in print by partnering university presses and are now being made openly available in digital form to read and reuse at no cost. Each title has undergone a rigorous selection and quality certification process that allows readers and users of this collection to trust the veracity of the content made available. Big Ten Open Books creates ebook collections that aspire to the highest standards of discoverability, accessibility, durability, and flexibility.

A multimodal essay \"Sound and Vision\" from the born-digital OA monograph Furnace and Fugue: A Digital Edition of Michael Maier's Atalanta fugiens (1618) with Scholarly Commentary, published by the University of Virginia Press, was made available on the MUSE platform early in 2021. In early 2023, MUSE released a chapter titled The Web of History from A New Vision for Islamic Pasts and Futures, published by MIT Press. The full text of both publications is available on the Brown University platform, and the excerpts on MUSE offer all the same functionality as on the primary site. Hosting content from these publications provides additional visibility and pathways to discovery for this ground-breaking scholarship, as well as spotlighting the MUSE platform's suitability for hosting robust and innovative digital humanities works.\n\nOA Journals on MUSE\n\nAlliance for African Partnership Perspectives\n\nAmerican Religion\n\nArtivate\n\nCanadian Journal of Information and Library Science\n\nCross-Currents: East Asian History and Culture Review\n\nEnglish Literature in Transition, 1880-1920\n\nExpeditions with MCUP\n\nGendered Perspectives on International Development\n\nJournal of Advanced Military Studies\n\nJournal of Appalachian Health\n\nJournal of Disaster Studies\n\nJournal of Indian Ocean World Studies\n\nManuscript Studies: A Journal of the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies\n\nMarine Corps History\n\nMashriq & Mahjar: Journal of Middle East and North African Migration Studies\n\nNuevos Horizontes\n\nObservational Studies\n\nRapa Nui Journal\n\nRSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences\n\nSoutheast of Now: Directions in Contemporary and Modern Art in Asia\n\nSungkyun Journal of East Asian Studies\n\nThe Dial: A Journal of the Ralph Waldo Emerson Society\n\nOpen Access Books"
