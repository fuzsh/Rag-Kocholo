        "text": "Join Liverpool’s art-house witch and drag shapeshifter, Dross, for an unforgettable evening of dark, decadently queer cabaret-theatre.\n\nIn a world divided, what might happen when we allow ourselves to dream?\n\nHaving cut her teeth on the cabaret circuit across the U.K & developing a unique performance style that blends spectacle with a deep vulnerability – this is the question at the heart of Dross’ first one-queen show.\n\nWhat are the stories that we choose to tell to & about ourselves? How do we shape the world around us?\n\nAn Evening with Dross charts a course across this constellation of contradictions – weaving a thread that is equal parts biography and fantasy.\n\n“Beautiful, smart & hilarious in waves” (so she’s told), An Evening with Dross is a kaleidoscopic, multimedia patchwork of a life as ‘what if’ – not – ‘this is’.\n\nDross invites you to yearn for more magical world – and perhaps together, learn the power of fantasy in unmasking the truths we take for granted.\n\nFeaturing film & animation from Laura Spark, special guest performances from drag artist Dan Chan, & musical accompaniment from Emily Meghan Lansley & Alex Germains.\n\n“An intelligent and thoughtful reflection on LGBTQ+ identity & community. This is Queer Church! *****\n\nWritten & performed by Dross.\n\nDramaturgical & Script support: Alice Holland & Brendan Curtis.\n\nAn Evening with Dross was developed with the kind support of FACT Artist Lab & Homotopia QueerCore programme."
