        "text": "Join Homotopia Festival Artist in Residence Jade Anouka and her partner Grace Savage for an online viewing of their short film Her & Her, followed by a Q&A.\n\nHer & Her have been seeing each other for a few months now and are both very much in love. They have recently moved into Her small, one-bedroom flat and, of course, she has brought the dog! Suddenly Her home is their home, and the realities of their differences come into full view. Backgrounds, cultures, upbringings, rules… all different. And one uses poetry, the other music, to tell their stories.\n\nPart performance poetry. Part music video. This experimental short film is a lyrical and musical story told using rhyme and beatboxing.\n\nWritten and directed by Jade Anouka; music composed and performed by Grace Savage.\n\nPAY WHAT YOU DECIDE (Suggested donation £5)"
