Her work includes collage, publishing, photography and installation. She received her MFA from Bard College in New York and was an active member of Toronto/Vancouver–based collective Instant Coffee from 2000 to 2010.

Their projects aim to foster multiplicity of amplified voice; redirect money from an arts economy to a local economy; value local knowledge and discourse production; and create spaces in which roles can shift between teacher and learner.

Prior to Transformazium, Bishop-Root was a program director for Publicolor in NYC. She continues to work as an education consultant for arts and neighborhood based organizations.\n\nLori Blondeau is a performance artist based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan that has exhibited nationally and internationally. Blondeau’s work explores the influence of popular media and culture (contemporary and historical) on Aboriginal self-identity, self-image and self-definition. The performance personas she creates refer to the damage of colonialism and to the ironic pleasures of displacement and resistance. She completed her MFA at the University of Saskatchewan. She is also a co-founder and the current director of Canada’s most innovative and exciting aboriginal arts organization, TRIBE.\n\nGinger Brooks Takahashi’s collaborative project-based practice is an extension of feminist spaces and queer inquiry, actively building community and nurturing alternative forms of information distribution.

Coburn’s multi-disciplinary work in photography, sculpture, installation and video explores representations of women in popular culture; ideas of nationhood; the roles of image, spectacle and myth in mediating cultural difference; queer and sexualized bodies, everyday objects, material culture, and human/animal relations. Coburn’s work has been exhibited and screened in galleries and festivals including Photophobia (Art Gallery of Hamilton), the Living Effect (Ottawa Art Gallery), MIX (New York Gay & Lesbian Experimental Film/Video Festival) Transmediale International Media Art Festival (Berlin, Germany), Beaver Tales and Uneasy Pieces (Oakville Galleries), Kassel Documentary Film & Video Festival (Kassel, Germany), and the Dublin Lesbian & Gay Film and Video Festival (Dublin, Ireland).

In 2007 she was appointed Associate Professor and awarded tenure.\n\nDodoLab is the experimental, public-focused practice of Guelph-based artist Lisa Hirmer. DodoLab is focused on developing provocative approaches to working with the public and the nebulous reality of public opinion. Often modeled as a type of performative research, the work explores and responds to the public’s relationship with contemporary issues—meaning that it is never solely an idea in and of itself that is explored, but rather an idea in relation to the public’s (or more accurately a specific public, counter-public or community’s) understandings and beliefs about that idea. As DodoLab, Hirmer has created projects across Canada and internationally at public galleries, including Confederation Centre Art Gallery (Charlottetown), Harbourfront Centre (Toronto), University of Lethbridge Art Gallery, Kamloops Art Gallery, Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, Foreman Gallery (Lennoxville) and Peninsula Arts (Plymouth, U.K.); with service organizations, such as Trillium (Sudbury) and the Gosling Foundation (Guelph); municipalities, including Breckland Council (U.K.) and the City of Rijeka (Croatia); and academic groups, including The Institute for Critical Studies in Improvisation (University of Guelph), and the Centre for Community Based Research (Kitchener). In 2015 Hirmer was selected for an international residency by the Centre for Contemporary Art and the Natural World (U.K.) and for the Time_Place_Space program by Performance Space and Art House Melbourne (Australia).\n\nAli El-Darsa, Beirut-born Berlin/Toronto-based, works in video, performance and installation.

FASTWURMS cultural production is about multidisciplinary, multimedia artworks that integrate time based, performance, and visual art in the context of immersive installations, social exchange and event architecture principles. FASTWURMS artwork is characterized by a determined DIY sensibility, Witch positivity identity politics, and a keen allegiance towards working class, queer alliance, and artist collaborations. FASTWURMS cultural practice is predicated on the free exchange and circulation of aesthetic knowledge as a public and performative narrative. FASTWURMS has exhibited and created public commissions and installations, performance, video and film projects, across Canada and in the United States, Europe, Brazil, Korea, and Japan.\n\nFor the past 20 years, the film and video work of Canadian artist Deirdre Logue has focused on the self as subject. Using ‘performance for the camera’ as a primary mode of production, her compelling self-portraits investigate what it means to be a queer body in the age of anxiety. Logue has been prolific and steadfast in her engagement with the moving image and has subsequently produced upwards of 60 short films and videos as well as some of this country’s most celebrated video art installations. Important exhibitions of her video works have taken place at Plug In ICA (Winnipeg), Open Space (Victoria), Oakville Galleries, the Images Festival (Toronto), the Berlin International Film Festival and ExiS (Seoul). Her most recent collaborations with artist Allyson Mitchell include the FAG Feminist Art Gallery (Toronto) and Killjoy’s Kastle: A Lesbian, Feminist Haunted House (Toronto, London and Los Angeles).

Syrus holds degrees in Art History, Visual Studies and a Masters in Sociology and Equity Studies, University of Toronto. He is a PhD candidate in the Faculty of Environmental Studies at York University.\n\nAllyson Mitchell is a maximalist artist working in sculpture, performance, installation and film. Her practice melds feminism and pop culture to investigate contemporary ideas about sexuality, politics and the body. These articulations have resulted in a coven of lesbian feminist Sasquatch monsters, a room-sized Vagina Dentata, an army of genius Holly Hobbies and a woodland utopia library of political knowledge. Her works have exhibited in galleries and festivals across Canada, the US and Europe, including Tate Modern, the Textile Museum of Canada, the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, Yerba Buena Art Centre, Andy Warhol Museum, Walker Art Center, The British Film Institute, Winnipeg Art Gallery and the Art Gallery of Ontario.

Recent film screenings include Pleasure Dome’s New Toronto Works, International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, and Images Festival, Toronto. She holds an MSW from the University of Toronto and an MFA in Documentary Media Studies from Ryerson University.\n\nRadiodress uses live and recorded talking, singing, yelling and listening to consider bodies as sites of knowledge, and communication as a political practice. Through guided audience participation in public space, she highlights the relationship between collective voice and the empathic act of listening. Radiodress' projects centre around questions of community, justice and healing. They usually involve non-artists, intentional community, and spiritual practices. Radiodress' audio-based community project, midnight dawn 20-10-10 was exhibited as part of Border Cultures Two (work, labour) at the Art Gallery in Windsor, resulting in a long-listing for the 2014 Sobey Award. Her most recent work, Mysterium Tremendum was presented this past summer by the Worker's Arts and Heritage Centre in Hamilton. For this project, Radiodress worked with a number of feminist, activist and precarious worker communities to share their struggles and transform their invisibility through the ancient mystical form of the Merkabah. Radiodress also produces Republic of Love, a radio show on critical art culture broadcast monthly on the new moon, and is currently in training as a Hebrew Priestess. For more information on her creative and spiritual work, visit: www.radiodress.ca\n\nFrom the monumental to the modest, Hazel Meyer’s projects range from large installations to small woven tags meant for an audience of one. She explores seemingly disparate yet overlapping preoccupations —intestines and athletics, feminism and the absurd, anxiety and textiles— using scale, language, play, repetition, gentle confrontation and ecstatic immersion. She has collaborated with teens, badminton players, composers, her mother, and artists for projects that are devoted to a forever shifting ratio of endurance, transgression, and laughs, as ways of being in one’s body and the world. Hazel holds an MFA from OCAD University (Toronto), a BFA from Concordia University (Montréal). Recent solo exhibitions include Muscle Panic at the MacLaren Art Centre (Barrie, ON), No Theory No Cry at Art Metropole (Toronto), and Walls to the Ball at La Centrale (Montréal).

Her work is full of chimeric landforms, melting bodies, radical womanhood, sentient objects, and disarming ruptures of time and space. Inspired by her nomadic lifestyle, Jesi the Elder's animated short films and music videos are a fever-dream travelogue. Her animations are diaries of her most traversed landscape: that of her own vivid imagination.\n\nChris E. Vargas is a video maker & interdisciplinary artist. From 2008-2013, he made, in collaboration with Greg Youmans, the web-based trans/cisgender sitcom Falling In Love…with Chris and Greg.
