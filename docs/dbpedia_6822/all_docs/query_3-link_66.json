        "text": "The time is coming of the triumphant return of the man, Touko Laaksonen, to his country of Finland. Laaksonen is best known as the artist Tom of Finland. His body may have passed over two decades ago, yet his spirit lives on in his art as he proudly makes his homecoming to his native region of Turku as part of the 2011 European Capital of Culture celebrations.\n\nSince early 2009, Tom of Finland Foundation in partnership with Homotopia, has been preparing for this very special exhibition in Turku, which has been curated to span this master artist’s lifetime from his early childhood drawings to his most accomplished works. Tom of Finland has been proclaimed as one of the most influential artists of the last century. He transcended into, and became part of our culture, being expressed in numerous ways. His influence can be seen from Jean Paul Gaultier fashions and the photography of Bruce Weber to the stage presence of Freddy Mercury, Rob Halford of Judith Priest, Adam Ant, and Holly Johnson of Frankie Goes to Hollywood fame. He is felt in the paintings of Pierre et Gilles and Juan Davila to the films of Kenneth Anger and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.\n\nTom of Finland made his homeland internationally famous through his renderings of its natural splendor and the majestic, northern, god-like men that he created – TOM’s Men. His return to Turku offers his own people a new opportunity to experience his genius, to be enthralled in his mastery and to absorb the Beauty in his depictions of the male species. It is a chance to snicker along with Tom with his classic Finnish humor and to see ourselves in his simple, straightforward approach to something that comes naturally to all of us – sex. Beginning in the mid 1950s, Tom’s clear objective was to give homosexual males strong, positive, masculine role models – proud men-loving-men. No guilt, no shame. Very simple. Very powerful. His artwork provided generation after generation healthy and happy imagery with which they could identify – something that western culture had been unwilling to supply and, in fact, did it utmost to curtail.\n\nThe world abounds with a love for this hero and his art, stretching across all boundaries. It is now time for everyone to permit themselves to enjoy him, honor him, cherish him and be proud of him for all that he gave us. When one hears “Finland”, one thinks of Nokia, Jean Sibelius, and Tom of Finland, of course.\n\nDurk Dehner\n\nPresident & Cofounder\n\nTom of Finland Foundation, Los Angeles"
