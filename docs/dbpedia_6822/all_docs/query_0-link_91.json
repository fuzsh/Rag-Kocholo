        "text": "⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nYou could hear the murmur from outside the theatre. That familiar sound and yet so foreign and out of place. The language gets more intense as you venture inside the venue, into the queue and finally as you land in your seat.\n\nAlmost begs the question: Is this show in English or Portuguese?\n\nOnly the English drama students in the last row loudly debating Meisner’s technique while we all wait for the show to begin would remind you that you’re still in London.\n\nThe phone rings as the show starts. Josh Hinds, the director of Spicy White demands the audience’s undivided attention straight away when Elena the main and only character on stage directly addressed the audience.\n\nFrom her own perspective, the character Elena, played by Marta Bonito, guides us through her decision to move to a new country, what led to that decision, the stereotypes a Portuguese woman faces in London and the differences between dating Portuguese men versus English men. The seemingly light-hearted show even manages to tackle the deeper issues behind all the “spicy and exotic” jokes Elena faces exposing it as systemic xenophobia in a world pre and post-Brexit.\n\nThe show made its premiere at Backstage Theatre and moved to The Golden Goose Theatre this summer. It was brought back for two nights with Theatre 503 in London.\n\nAt first glance, one can assume this to be a self-written piece of work given the way Marta Bonito portrays the story in such a personal way and since the holding device is a one-person show. However, the words came from Carina Simões, who puts on the hat of both writer and producer of Spicy White.\n\nCarina Simões wants to create a platform for under-represented people in the arts in the UK and she achieves it with this easily relatable story to every immigrant in the United Kingdom while still giving a special nod to southern Europeans who find themselves invisible in the big city of London.\n\nThe performance of Marta Bonito is speedy and witty as Elena quickly shifts from herself and her point of view of the world to multiple characters that surround her. Being her family and Portuguese friends with very strong accents or clients and co-workers with their respective posh accents. She manages to change very organically from Elena to other characters and still keep the energy levels up thought-out the 50-minute show.\n\nBeing able to encapsulate the most light-hearted jokes about the atrocity of putting milk in tea while still being able to fit in some social commentary on xenophobia and racism is nothing short of a challenge.\n\n“They might say I’m exotic or spicy but I am still white so I’m still a part of the problem”.\n\nAnd while Spicy White does an amazing job at making fun while speaking to these greater issues, it lacks in the sense of resolution or at least the attempt of that. In depicting her own struggles, the character stereotypes the English middle-class man and incentivizes the classic “do as I say not as I do”.\n\nIn the last scene, the character has a phone which is made in Portuguese and never translated to English, possibly highlighting the cultural divide that exists today and probably tomorrow.\n\nBringing to question if we are not all the same in the way we are defensive with our cultures and judgemental of others even if white or not white or spicy white.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 5 out of 5.\n\nWritten by Martin Sherman and directed by Scott Le Crass, Rose opens with a gentle spotlight on David Shield’s minimalist set: the clean lines of a yellow mat atop a wooden bench, a blue notebook, a blue coolbox, a bottle of water and a glass. Rose is sitting Shiva, the week-long Jewish mourning rite, although it is initially ambiguous for whom – or what – she is mourning.\n\nShe takes the opportunity to talk, recounting her life for us over the next two hours. ‘I am eighty five. I find that unforgivable’, laments Rose, to great laughter from the audience. At eighty five, Rose is an infectiously charismatic, poised raconteur, unafraid to muse with verve and humour on a heady mix of themes, from sex and menstruation to religious renouncement, pagan ritual and kabbalah.\n\nShe talks of her early days in a Ukrainian shtetl, remembering a time of carts and horses pounding the streets – ‘traffic, but no exhaust fumes’ – a time when ‘we still had an ozone layer…someone should have told us, we could have enjoyed it’. Rose presents her younger self as a precocious, intellectually hungry child, ‘pretentious in several languages at once’, her thirst for knowledge prompting long, forbidden conversations with her brother late into the night, and an indignation at her inability to attend school on account of her gender.\n\nThe play strongly resists tropes of neat storytelling – ‘nothing was linear’, Rose recalls of her time hiding from the Nazis in Warsaw’s sewers. ‘I don’t want to remember. What can I tell you? We lived happily ever after’. Fairytale endings elude this narrative; she quips that ‘when you experience your first period and your first pogrom in the same month, you can safely say your childhood is over’ – though somewhat humorously, Rose can’t be sure if her memories of that first pogrom are in fact lifted from Fiddler on the Roof. Later, she tells us she can see the sign on a boat headed for Palestine, large letters designating ‘Exodus 1947’, so clearly in her mind – but acknowledges she was standing directly underneath it, so how could she? After Rose is detained by American soldiers and bundled onto a train heading for a displaced persons camp, she is encouraged to jump off by a sailor she has recently met, soon to become her second husband. The train, the lovers, and the steam spilling across the platform; hadn’t she seen this scene a hundred times in the movies?\n\nQuestions surrounding the unreliability of memory, as well as the relationships between fiction and reality, the past and present are explored throughout the play. Rose’s spiritual experiences and trauma-induced hallucinations, as well as the burnt, washed-out scenes of her beloved Western films blur with vivid visual memories. All are presented to us with equal significance in an exquisite tapestry of oral testimony. One of Rose’s grandchildren eventually becomes a film editor in LA, showing her how to cut and rearrange the reels – ‘my hallucinations were not unusual’, she muses, ‘it was just the movies catching up with the mind’.\n\nDame Maureen Lipman is mesmerising as the titular Rose in this one-woman play. One of the problems faced by such productions is the struggle to hold an audience’s attention, exacerbated in an age of big-budget streaming services and 4D cinema. It is safe to say Lipman has us unequivocally in the palm of her hand throughout, hanging on to her every word in a trance-like state. She speaks with a natural parataxis, a rhythmic beat given to our instincts for storytelling and meaning-making through narrative that verges on the biblical, builds her memories steadily, and irresistibly pulls us into her world. Rose’s testimony is deeply affecting without ever becoming sentimental, her most traumatic memories and deepest longings told with a direct, matter of fact simplicity. She surprises and moves us, effecting a kind of emotional whiplash as she switches from recounting her trials within the ghetto in Warsaw to musing on a quotidian observation, or telling a joke.\n\nRazor-sharp, recognisably Jewish humour is weaved throughout, with Rose aware of the irony of eating ice cream to take a cholesterol pill, and telling us God is like a policeman – ‘he’s never there when you need him, and then he punishes you when you haven’t done anything’. The clumsy American sailor slips on the escape boat, producing an unexpected visceral reaction in her – her body heaves and convulses, and strange sounds erupt from her throat; she’d forgotten what laughter was, which here becomes a corporal symbol of freedom, resistance and survival.\n\nJane Lalljee’s lighting design is hypnotic, bathing our storyteller in soft colours that complement her often dream-like verbal wanderings. Julian Starr’s simple soundscapes help to sketch the outlines of Rose’s life stories, such as the far-off cheering of crowds gathered to watch a Miss America pageant, in a particularly surreal recollection of Rose’s attempt to become possessed by the spirit of Yussell, her dead lover.\n\nThe themes of belonging and its antithesis, outsiderhood, perhaps resonate most strongly across the script. Persecuted throughout her early life, Rose’s son greets her as an old woman at the airport in Tel Aviv, saying ‘welcome home, Mama’: Palestine was no longer Palestine, but Israel, the promised land of milk and honey. Yet for Rose, the milk has gone sour, the honey is tart. Abby thinks her world, the culture of the old country is dead, that there is only the future. He calls her an outsider by choice. As Rose sings in Yiddish at the play’s close, it is that question which rings out and haunts the theatre – where do I belong?\n\nRose runs at the Park Theatre until 15th October.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5.\n\nThis week the indomitable Trocks make their return to the Peacock Theatre stage and regale audiences with a second programme, running from the 12th – 17th September, presenting an inspired and colourful selection of works based on Fokine, Petipa and Balanchine.\n\nThe programme opens with an adaptation of Les Sylphides, a short abstract ballet from 1907 that was inspired by the mysterious atmospheres of earlier romantic ballets such as La Sylphide and Giselle. With choreography by Michel Fokine and set to music by Chopin, the ballet has no narrative beyond ethereal air spirits dancing by moonlight with a lone man. The Trocks are scintillating to watch in this “romantic reverie,” performing with the utmost grace and precision one minute, before tumbling into impeccably timed pratfalls the next. Some of the funniest moments in Les Sylphides are derived from the corps de ballet either awkwardly waddling, penguin-like, across the stage to assume new starting positions, or spending most scenes in entirely static positions on the floor, slowly losing the will to live as a result.\n\nFollowing on from Les Sylphides is a glitzy, vivacious take on the pas de trois from Paquita, a notable excerpt from the 1846 romantic ballet, originally choreographed by Mazilier but then revised by Marius Petipa a year later. Set to music by Ludwig Minkus, this pas de trois serves up flirtatious silliness and offers a taste of the stylized Spanish-themed splendour that they later capitalize on in the final ballet of the evening, Majisimas. In Vivaldi Suite, the Trocks take a brief detour from the romantic era to revel in the stark elegance of Balanchine’s method, performing in shimmering leotards to a striking musical backdrop of Vivaldi. This is a breath-taking homage to neoclassical dance, at points reminding me of Christopher Wheeldon’s minimalist one-act ballet Within the Golden Hour. As with their first programme, Robert Carter once again gives a hilarious turn as his melodramatic alter ego Olga Supphozova in The Dying Swan, fluttering across the stage and clutching hopelessly at fallen feathers before folding in on himself in clumsy self-conscious defeat.\n\nThe grand finale of the evening is Majisimas, a vibrant love letter to a romanticised 19th century theatrical interpretation of Spain, harking back to popular works such as Don Quixote and Paquita. The music in Majisimas is lifted from the opera “El Cid” by Jules Massenet, providing a lush musical accompaniment to the fiendishly challenging choreography. The Trocks really come into their own in this piece, carrying off countless fouettes with precision and poise.\n\nOne of the most joyous aspects of seeing the Trocks on stage is the degree to which the individuality and diversity of company members informs their performances. Indeed, they take immense pride in their approach to equality, diversity and inclusion, and this ethos is inseparable from their artistic practice. In many ways this sets them apart from mainstream ballet companies that still cling to outdated, exclusionary aesthetic requirements and a rigid, unquestioning approach to the gender binary. These are important battles that are still being fought both within the dance world and in the world at large, and although the tide does seem to be changing for the better the Trocks occupy a unique space in this discourse as veteran dancers and pioneers of diversity and acceptance. They are not just an exceptionally skilled ballet troupe; they are radicals and proud of it. As a young queer trans person I am in awe of them and sincerely hope they will keep on Trockin’ for years to come.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 3.5 out of 5.\n\nAt its heart, The P Word explores Britain’s broken asylum system through the life of Zafar (Esh Alladi) as he hangs in limbo between deportation and finding a new home. Running in parallel to Zafar’s story is that of Bilal, a self-professed gym bro and Grindr addict who slowly learns to love. Whilst his role is integral to the show, in contrast to Zafar the character comes off shallow and uninspired. I never found myself rooting for Bilal for any reason other than because he was the only other character on stage.\n\nA standout throughout the show was Esh Alladi’s performance whose handling of Zafar was delicate and considered. The show’s effectiveness hinges entirely around Zafar, and Alladi never drops the baton.\n\nWhilst simple, the show’s staging is effective and at no point detracts from the experience. The set pulls inspiration from characters’ personal symbols, solidifying and uniting them in the space. As the two draw closer, sharing their experiences of homophobia and identity as British Pakistanis, so too do they unite in the space.\n\nUnfortunately, the show feels like it cannot decide how it should treat the subject matter. The first 40 minutes of the show introduces us to both characters as we hop in and out of each narrative. It wrestles between Zafar’s deeply traumatic past, having to flee his home for threat of death from his father, and questions of ‘should I double text my hook-up if I messaged last?’ Littered throughout the play are moments of beauty that when isolated are truly incredible but when seen in context are undermined by the surrounding scenes.\n\nThe play slowly picks up the pace from its slow opening and eventually rockets towards its promised Bollywood ending. As music and lights explode into action, The P Word slams its real meaning home, solidifying itself as a show that must be seen, especially given the current climate in which it exists.\n\nFundamentally, The P Word is an exploration of a deeply profound and important topic that is sadly diluted as the show loses itself to unoriginal writing and undermining humour. However, you would be remiss to miss such an original and important theme, despite the bumps in the road.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nBlackout. Then lights come up and we are immediately transfixed in what looks like the switching on of a well-oiled machine. The actors on stage move in complete synch and without a trace of hesitation. If it weren’t for my left brain telling me that these are real people executing a choreographed piece, I would have thought that I was watching human lookalikes who have been programmed to execute a perfectly conceived choreography.\n\nAnd that is, of course, when the realisation of what live theatre and live performance is and what it can achieve hits you. You cannot help but be in awe.\n\nEach turn, twitch and tiny motion is perfectly articulated, and the cast is not only in sync with the beatbox-esque rhythm that underlines all the movement, but with each other as well. Were it not for the beads of sweat dripping from their faces, it would be impossible to know how much effort this performance requires, because they all make it look truly effortless.\n\nThe story and the relationships are clear and the archetypes of the three different characters are very recognisable and succeed in provoking a deeply emotional response to the viewer. It is the perfect example of how the telling of a story doesn’t need a dense text full of information in order to be understood, and how an audience can understand solely through feeling and experiencing, much like how people connect with music without lyrics.\n\nIt would be unfair, in my opinion, to comment on each individual performer because this production is the definition of an ensemble piece. One cannot exist without the others, each of them 1/3 of a truly impressive whole. Praise must be given however to Kwame Asafo-Adjei’s astonishing choreography, which doesn’t let our attention lapse for one single minute. It is fairly easy with a choreography so precise for performers to find themselves doing a very impressive dance, but this is not the case with Family Honour. Even the tiniest motion is motivated and executed with clear intention driven by storytelling, which is what makes the performance look less like a dance sequence and more like a secret language that these characters use to communicate with each other and that we, as audience members, are lucky enough to be listening in to.\n\nThe whole piece is elevated by Adam Careé’s lighting design, which creates breath-taking images and an atmosphere that accommodates the storytelling beautifully, without pointing out the obvious.\n\nSadly, there were only two performances of this show at Sadler’s Wells Theatre. This is a brilliant piece with so many things to say and, hopefully in the future, it will be shared with larger audiences both in and outside the UK.\n\nWe sat down with Joseph Toonga who is behind Born to Exist – a Hip-Hop Dance Theatre production that is a response to Joseph’s personal experience of being solely brought up by black women.\n\nBorn to Exist is part of a trilogy – can you give us a brief description of how the three works fit together thematically?\n\nThe three works fit together as they look at the themes of black excellence, black experience and black journeys. I think the thread between the three pieces is the insight into the journeys and experiences of black brotherhood and sisterhood. The trilogy overall looks at relationships and how they are perceived and seen through another lens.\n\nWhen you started out with the trilogy did you already have in your mind the overriding themes of each piece? Did you always know you would end up telling this female-focused story?\n\nNo, originally Born to Exist was meant to be part of a double bill when I did my R&D in 2018. It was meant to be a solo on myself and then a trio on three females. However, I realised that those two stories needed a separate show, so I started Born to Manifest which became a duet. From there, I realised that I wanted more people who looked like me and reflected my journey and my background to see the pieces of work. Born to Protest came out of this and was an outdoor piece because I wanted non-theatre goers and non-dance lovers to be able to access work like this. So the trilogy came out of the want for more people to be exposed to Born to Manifest.\n\nI always knew the last part of the trilogy was going to be female-focused as I wanted one part of the work to reflect the different females in my life and my upbringing. I also wanted to bring in other viewpoints and shine a light upon the journeys of their mothers, aunties, best friends and cousins.\n\nBorn To Exist tells the story of how you were brought up by your mum and aunties when you came to the UK – can you briefly describe this experience?\n\nI think Born to Exist has moved past my upbringing. My upbringing was a stimulus, but through the process we had a survey and I spoke to a lot of people, including the performers. I tried to get consensus from the performers on the themes and issues covered and on how we explored them. We didn’t want to make it cliched or stereotypical or for it to feel like I’m telling a story of how they are. It’s more of an insight from my research and their opinions, and we’re presenting their journey to you.\n\nIn terms of my experience growing up, it was good, but it was also hard because I had to watch my aunties and my mum be very resilient in a place that wasn’t home for them. And of course, there were certain scenarios that they couldn’t hide from me as a child. But they tried their best to make sure that we were brought up in a positive, hard-working environment. They really tried to form a sense of community, a sense of home, a sense of being proud to be African, to be black, because it wasn’t the norm at that time.\n\nWhy do you feel it is important to tell your story at this time? Is there a political message you want to get across?\n\nIt’s a message that needs to come at this time because we’re at a point where while black and ethnic minority stories are starting to come out in little drops, there is a lack of focus on black female stories. I don’t want to neglect the stories of my mum and my cousins, and other black and biracial females whose stories are not being told because they’re not in the mainstream. There’s so much beauty in their journeys and strength in their sisterhood, and I felt that my work needed to highlight this. I have a spotlight right now where people are wanting to hear and see my opinion, so I think it’s the right time to put this work out and start conversations that will hopefully give others a platform to make work and know that their story is relevant.\n\nI don’t try to convey a political message, but I think the journeys and stories are political in and of themselves. There are three black women on stage who all come from different backgrounds, different tones of black, a different mix of what black can look like. The political message is in the piece of work: to see them how they are, for who they are, and see their journeys. Who they are is important and we need to hear their stories. We need to celebrate their journeys and realise that their stories are just as complex as anyone else’s.\n\nAnything else you’d like to say about Born to Exist to potential audiences?\n\nI hope it gets the exposure it needs in order for more people to come and watch these stories.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nHappy Meal, fresh from the Fringe, is treating the Oxford Playhouse and Coventry to a witty, touching queer rom-com. The Burton Taylor studio is perfectly suited to this intimate story – placing the two actors – Sam Crerar (Alec) and Allie Daniel (Bette) – close to the audience and ensuring we are thrown headfirst into their whirlwind relationship.\n\nUsing social media as a plot point – we travel through Club Penguin to MySpace to Facebook to Instagram (which is a nostalgia trip in itself) and learn about Alec and Bette through the virtual world and the personalities they put out there versus who they are in the real-life.\n\nRunning at an hour and fifteen, this is a short and succinct play that keeps the pace and energy up and the audience engaged throughout. Exploring the fear of coming out as transgender, accepting who you are and the trials of trying to access medical support, as well as the gender dysphoria that can be a constant presence was handled with delicacy and also an approachability that made the play easy to follow whilst tackling some tricky topics.\n\nWithout spoiling the show I can say that it was an eye-opening experience. It’s a play I think deserves a greater tour, greater visibility and perhaps to be used in more educational settings – it gave a platform to transgender individuals through the method of a romantic comedy storyline – something in mainstream media would still most likely feature a cis-heteronormative couple. It was sad to leave the theatre and realise that this in itself was a reason for the play to standout – theatre and arts as whole needs to do more to normalise transroles in plays.\n\nTo conclude – I must tell you the truth – I found myself in tears at the end – I’d become so invested in Bette and Alec’s story and through the duo’s acting and the vulnerability of the script I was fully immersed in their world and the ending came too soon.\n\nWe sat down with Christine Kavanagh who plays Mrs Bingley in Stephen Daldry’s production of JB Priestly’s classic thriller An Inspector Calls on a 30th anniversary tour of the UK.\n\nAn Inspector Calls is an absolute classic in the theatre world – how does this production bring a new light or energy to a play most audiences will have experienced already?\n\nWe are lucky that An Inspector Calls is studied so much in schools, and so we can bring this production to people, and we love having schools in our audiences, other works are not performed nearly so frequently. People often think of plays like this as being stuffy period dramas, but the reason this production by Stephen Daldry is a landmark production is that it is given its full weight. It was first staged in 1945 in Russia and written as an experimental piece of theatre, and this production stays with that. Everything you think you’re going to see at the theatre is turned on its head. You think you’re going to see a costume drama, but it seems to be 1945, you think you’re going to see a set that is grounded but it appears to be floating mid-air. I cannot urge people to come along to see An Inspector Calls enough, not just because of this incredible production but also because the actual message of the play is so important – that we are all responsible for each other and that privilege and wealth need to be examined. It’s not a bad message for our times. It’s not a play that people see that frequently, and if it’s your first experience of theatre then it’s a great place to start.\n\nStephen Daldry, your director, has a fantastic track record – how have you found the rehearsal process? Is it part of your career’s allure/benefits to work with a range of directors in your career and experience different approaches?\n\nI’ve been fortunate in my career, as I have been in the business over 40-years, to have worked with some truly great directors including Trevor Nunn, Simon Godwin and now, Stephen Daldry! Of course, it goes without saying that there are some directors who you wish to work with, and Stephen Daldry is most definitely in that category. He thinks outside the box, which is what most great directors do, he has quite an eclectic career and amazing curiosity. In rehearsal it has been a treat as he seems eternally youthful and still has the joy and love of theatre. It was like having a masterclass because Stephen is the originator of the production. My advice to young people is definitely try and work with great directors, and work with great work. When you choose your audition pieces, choose great writing whether it is contemporary or classic. Always choose the best and lean on that strength as well as your own talent. It’s a marriage made in heaven to work with a wonderful director on a great script.\n\nIt’s a big tour you’re embarking on – how do you find all the travel and performing in the same show for so long?\n\nIt’s very simple – Angela Lansbury was once asked ‘how do you learn your lines?’ and her reply was ‘It’s my job’. I would suggest this would apply to touring as well, it’s my job! You always have to know what you’re getting yourself in for that this is a touring production with long hours and hard work but it’s a fantastic play and great company. You do have to look after your health and find good accommodation but it is a treat. You meet new people, you meet young audiences and you get to experience art galleries and museums across the countries. It’s a great job!\n\nAre there any parts of Mrs Birling’s character that you really resonate with?\n\nNot much, she is a monster, and I am quite a pleasant person, and I have a sense of humour and she doesn’t, but I absolutely do resonate with the fact that she is a very opinionated person, and let me tell you, I am quite opinionated too, but hopefully with more charm and humour than her. I suppose the strongest resonance is that we are both mothers, matriarchs. I don’t resonate with her much at all, but she is a fantastic character to play.\n\nAre there any themes in the play that people might not normally notice that you’d like to point out for them to experience An Inspector Calls in a new way?\n\nOh I think you should come and see the show and find out for yourself! However, I would say that a theme people don’t often think too much about is time. Priestley messes with time, as does Stephen Daldry. We look at the past and find out how the past affects the future and wanting people of privilege to examine their privilege. The play was written in 1945, during the Second World War, and set it in 1912, just before the First World War. Here we are in 2022 with war happening across the globe. A great line from the play is “We don’t live along, we are members of one society” and we are all responsible for each other, which is not a bad lesson to think about today. The play includes discussion of the exploitation of women, of strikes and of the disparity of pay and wealth, all of these timeless themes.\n\nFinally – what do you prefer – the stage or the studio (for TV)?\n\nThey’re all different, but they are all the same principal – acting. The one that I really love actually is radio, but I do love it all!\n\n(Tickets and dates can be found here) www.aninspectorcalls.com"
