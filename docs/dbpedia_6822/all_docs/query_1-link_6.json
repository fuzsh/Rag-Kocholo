Take to the streets!‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm glad this film advocates for both cruising the toilets and taking direct action.\n\nüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è #8\n\nThis film was made for that certain type of queers. Best way to watch it is in a cramped dorm room on a friends laptop. Get a few drinks, invite some good friends, and have the best time a 22 minute movie can bring üß®\n\nAs the fight for gay marriage was gaining steam, Homotopia, a very-low-budget semi-guerilla hey-gang-let's-put-on-a-show production reasserts radical queer anti-all-institutions, and specifically anti-marriage positions. It's scattershot, attacking friend and foe and even non-institutional processes that support the sort of freedom and individuality that's espoused throughout. But there are sharp and perceptive observations as well. Thought-provoking, but of wildly inconsistent quality."
