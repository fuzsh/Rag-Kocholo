        "text": "A Disney Wordless Wednesday post – the theme this week is “Royal Ladies”.\n\nThe theme for Disney (Almost) Wordless Wednesday this week is Royal Ladies and, with two daughters, princesses are one thing of which I have an abundance of photos.\n\nOver the years, we have met all the princesses that I like to refer to as the traditional Fab Four (meaning the princesses that I remember from when I was a little girl – Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty – plus Belle) multiple times at Disney World, Disneyland, and on a Disney cruise.\n\nEmma and Cinderella\n\nEmma and Snow White\n\nEmma and Sleeping Beauty\n\nEmma and Belle\n\nWe have been entertained by beautiful princesses dancing and singing in shows.\n\nCinderella dancing with her Prince\n\nSnow White and her Prince\n\nPrincess Aurora and Prince Phillip dancing\n\nWe have seen princesses smiling and waving in countless parades.\n\nBelle in the holiday parade at Disneyland\n\nAriel and Prince Eric in the holiday parade at Disneyland\n\nWe even amused the Little Mermaid in her grotto one time.\n\nCan’t remember what Emma said but Ariel thought it was rather funny\n\nAs Disney has released more princess movies, we have developed new favourites like Tiana, Rapunzel and Pocahontas.\n\nEmma meets Tiana\n\nRapunzel and her mane\n\nEmma with Pocahontas\n\nWe have had photos taken with princesses that I don’t think are princesses. (There’s an ongoing discussion in my family about whether or not Mulan is a princess. The way I remember the story, Mulan was a commoner and she married a soldier. I don’t think she’s a princess, however, Disney seems to be marketing her that way and both of my daughters agree with Disney and not their mom.)\n\nEmma and Mulan – Is she a princess?\n\nMy favourite little princess, however, appeared at the Pirate and Princess Party at Disney World in 2008. Unfortunately, it poured rain all over the party but Emma could not have been happier dressed in her bright pink Princess Aurora gown and looking like an authentic royal lady."
