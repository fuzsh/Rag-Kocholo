        "text": "We recently returned from a lovely 7 days at WDW (18 days in Orlando all together) and I came home with over 2500 photos on my memory card! On one of the days that we visited the Magic Kingdom we grabbed fast passes for the princess meet n greet. Aurora, Belle and Cinderella were fantastic with our children and especially our DS 5 who has Cerebral Palsy. He does not communicate except for a few chosen words here and there, but he was in awe of each of the princesses. I believe they were smitten with him too as they each gave him a parting kiss which he LOVED! Here are his 'smooch' pics, with the Cinderella ones being my absolute favorite of all of the pics I took over the whole trip!\n\nPrincess Aurora\n\nAurora kisses by jbr00ks, on Flickr\n\nPrincess Belle\n\nBelle kisses by jbr00ks, on Flickr\n\nPrincess Cinderella\n\nCinderella's kisses by jbr00ks, on Flickr\n\nNot sure who's expression is better.....?!\n\nCinderella's kisses by jbr00ks, on Flickr"
