        "text": "Everybody loves the Disney Princesses, so why not have a Disney Princess engagement? That's exactly what one Minnesota couple did, and their photos turned out like a dang dream come true. According to The Huffington Post, Yalonda and Kayla Solseng celebrated their engagement with a Belle and Cinderella-themed shoot. The photos were taken by Taylor Snyder Art & Photography at Romantic Moon Events Center (very fitting name) in Glyndon, Minnesota. The two brides wore spot-on Disney princess dresses, as you can clearly see from the photos. Kayla dressed as Belle in yellow while Yalonda wore blue as Cinderella. Loving the choker by the way. Just saying. How did their Princess obsession come to be? It turns out they were both a fan of the show Once Upon A Time, the couple told The Huffington Post. Kayla also noted, \"That show rewrites fairy tales and this was our modern-day fairytale.\" Aww.\n\nThe twosome posed sprawled out in the grass, alongside rainbows and butterflies and were even snapped reading each other's stories from the childhood books. This is some next level Disney fandom if you ask us. We love it. Did we mention there's even a shot where Belle is pouring a drink from Mrs. Potts into Cinderella's Chip cup? So much magic in one place, you'd swear they worked at Disneyland. As if that wasn't adorable enough, there are photos of them dancing under twinkling lights, and a shot of Belle holding Cinderella's lost slipper. Additional pictures were also snapped by Sun & Moon Photography."
