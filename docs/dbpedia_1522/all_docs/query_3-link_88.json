        "text": "Disney has brought us countless memorable characters, but there's something extraordinary about the enchanting world of Disney Princesses.\n\nFrom tales of true love to stories of female empowerment (yes, Mulan, we're looking at you), these iconic Disney heroines have captured the hearts of both kids and adults alike.\n\nThey've not only entertained us but also inspired generations as role models. But who is the best Disney princess? Here's our list of the best Disney princesses that left a mark on Disney fans!\n\nTop 20 Most Popular Disney Princesses\n\n1. Mulan\n\nKnown as: Bravest\n\nWhy We Chose Her: Mulan is one of the few Disney Princesses known for bravery and determination. Unlike traditional Disney princesses, she doesn't wait for a prince charming to save the day.\n\nInstead, Fa Mulan disguises herself as a soldier to save her father and her country - a narrative of an independent woman, making her one of the most iconic Disney princesses ever.\n\nAdditionally, we like her love story with Li Shang and the theme song, \"Reflection,\" sung by the famous singer Lea Salonga.\n\nTake a peek at our list of the most popular Disney characters here.\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nBravery in the face of danger (defeats Shan Yu)\n\nDevotion to family and duty\n\nIntelligence and resourcefulness\n\nAbility to defy stereotypes and challenge norms\n\n2. Belle (Beauty and the Beast)\n\nKnown as: Smartest\n\nWhy We Chose Her: Belle, from the Disney film \"Beauty and the Beast,\" stands out for her love of reading, intelligence, and compassion.\n\nShe's not just one of the best Disney Princesses for her beauty but also her sharp mind and kind heart. Belle sees beyond appearances, showing us the importance of inner beauty and character.\n\nHer fairy tale story (in Beauty and the Beast) is a beautiful blend of romance and personal growth, making her a timeless role model for viewers.\n\nBe our guest and dine like royalty with our Disney Princess Dinnerware collection here!\n\nAlso Read: Beauty & the Beast Party Ideas\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nLove for learning and reading\n\nSeeing beyond superficial appearances\n\nCourage and compassion\n\nIndependence and strength of character\n\n3. Tiana (Princess and the Frog)\n\nKnown as: Humblest\n\nWhy We Chose Her: Tiana, from \"The Princess and the Frog,\" is a hardworking and ambitious Disney princess who encounters the frog prince - Prince Naveen.\n\nShe's an inspiration for her determination to achieve her dreams through perseverance and resilience. In fact, Tiana (of The Princess and the Frog) [1] is the first African-American Disney princess.\n\nTiana's journey from a waitress to a restaurateur encapsulates the essence of an independent woman, making her a unique and relatable Disney Princess.\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nStrong work ethic and determination\n\nPursuit of dreams despite obstacles\n\nResourcefulness and practical skills\n\nKindness and humility\n\n4. Rapunzel (Tangled)\n\nKnown as: Cleverest\n\nWhy We Chose Her: Rapunzel, from the Disney movie \"Tangled\" (voiced by Mandy Moore), captivates us with her adventurous spirit and zest for life and her romantic love story with Flynn Rider.\n\nShe remains optimistic and eager to explore the world despite being confined her entire life (involving her evil stepmother, Mother Gothel).\n\nRapunzel's fairy tale symbolizes the quest for freedom and self-discovery. Her story is a testament to the idea that one's circumstances don't define one's future, making her a truly inspiring Disney Princess.\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nOptimism and positivity\n\nCuriosity and love for adventure\n\nCreativity and artistic talent\n\nEmotional resilience\n\nAlso Read: Popular Disney Gifts For Women\n\n5.

So, her determination to follow her heart (Prince Eric) is inspiring.\n\nAriel's story encourages viewers to dream big and be brave, solidifying her status as one of the most cherished Disney Princesses. She's also the only Disney princess to have become a mother [2].\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nCourage to explore the unknown\n\nDetermination to pursue goals\n\nOpenness to new experiences\n\nResilience in facing challenges\n\n6. Jasmine (Aladdin)\n\nKnown as: Loveliest\n\nWhy We Chose Her: Princess Jasmine, from the Disney version of \"Aladdin\" (Walt Disney Pictures), is a strong-willed and independent character.\n\nDisney Jasmine challenges the constraints of her royal life, showing a desire to explore beyond palace walls and make her own choices, making her one of the iconic characters.\n\nHer character breaks the mold of traditional princess roles, making her a powerful role model for audiences. Besides, we love the magic lamp and the theme song sung by Lea Salonga.\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nIndependence and assertiveness\n\nCompassion for others\n\nCuriosity and intelligence\n\nCourage to stand up for herself\n\nAlso Read: Our Favorite Disney Quotes\n\n7. Merida (Brave)\n\nKnown as: Fearless\n\nWhy We Chose Her: We like Brave's Merida (daughter of Queen Elinor) for her fierce independence and bravery.\n\nShe defies traditional expectations and forges her own path - a symbol of self-determination and personal freedom.\n\nMerida's character (the first Pixar princess) encourages us to embrace individuality and be courageous in pursuing our destinies, making her a unique and inspiring princess.\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nStrong-willed and determined\n\nSkilled archer and horse rider\n\nPassion for adventure\n\nWillingness to challenge norms\n\n8. Pocahontas\n\nKnown as: Kindest\n\nWhy We Chose Her: Pocahontas (the titular character) is the first Native American Disney Princess. We love her deep connection with nature and her courageous spirit.\n\nPocahontas is the only Disney princess to have her story inspired by a real person (a Powhatan woman) [3], bringing a powerful narrative about bridging cultural divides and seeking peace.\n\nHer love for John Smith brought peace and unity before any battle could unfold. Her theme song, sung by Judy Kuhn, was good, too.\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nDeep respect for nature and the environment\n\nStrong sense of justice and peace\n\nCourage in the face of adversity\n\nWisdom beyond her years\n\n9. Cinderella\n\nKnown as: Nicest\n\nWhy We Chose Her: Cinderella is an iconic Disney Princess, embodying hope and kindness.\n\nCinderella's transformation, aided by her fairy godmother, glass slippers, and true love's kiss, makes her journey a magical and unforgettable tale within the Disney world.\n\nDespite hardships (involving her wicked stepmother), Cinderella remains optimistic, teaching us about the power of dreams and the rewards of perseverance.\n\nSo what's the theme in Cinderella?\n\nRole Model Qualities:\n\nUnwavering optimism in difficult times\n\nKindness to all, including her animal friends\n\nPatience and grace under pressure\n\nBelief in her dreams and aspirations\n\n10.
