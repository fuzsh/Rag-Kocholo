        "text": "The #DreamBigPrincess global video series empowers the next generation of leaders by spotlighting female trailblazers as they share their stories and advice. 21 talented young women from 13 countries captured the stories of these leaders in digital shorts that will be shared across Disney’s global social media.\n\nPlus, from October 10–November 20, 2018, for each like or share of a public video or photo with #DreamBigPrincess on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, Disney will donate $1 to Girl Up, the United Nations Foundation’s initiative supporting girls’ leadership and empowerment (minimum donation: $500,000/maximum donation: $1 million). For more information about Girl Up, go to girlup.org.\n\nWhile the donation goal has been met, you can still inspire others to dream big by sharing the videos and photos online. No additional posts or likes will trigger any more donations.\n\n*Campaign hashtags include:\n\n#DreamBigPrincess, #soyprincesasiendoyo, #souprincesasoureal, #CroisEnTesRevesPrincesse\n\nVoid where prohibited\n\nThis campaign aims to make a tangible difference for girls who face challenges in achieving their dreams, through a collaboration with Girl Up.\n\nFunds generated through this campaign will help support Girl Up’s leadership development programs. These programs engage girls to take action and advocate for themselves and girls globally, giving them empowering tools to help transform the world. Funds from this collaboration will help more girls start Girl Up Clubs in the US and around the world, and build a new program for Girl Up members to help them grow their skills and increase their leadership potential.\n\nGirl Up is an initiative of the UN Foundation, working across a global community of partners to achieve gender equality worldwide.
