        "text": "Tatler looks back at one of the most romantic royal love stories of all time on the anniversary of the birth of the late Duke of Edinburgh\n\nWhen it comes to love stories, the tale of the Queen and Prince Philip is one for the ages. It started in the 1930s and blossomed into a marriage that endured for more than 70 years, with the Queen famously describing her husband as her ‘strength and stay’. But before they were Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, they were simply Princess Elizabeth (or ‘Lilibet’) and Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark.\n\nPrince Philip first caught Princess Elizabeth’s eye in the summer of 1939 when she was just 13 years old. He was five years her senior, about to embark on a career with the Royal Navy. Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret were on a trip with their parents to Dartmouth’s Britannia Royal Naval College, their father’s alma mater. It was here where the dashing cadet Prince Philip – a distant cousin – entered the scene. According to Marion Crawford, the princesses’ governess, it was Philip’s ‘viking’ good looks – his fair hair and blue eyes – that attracted Elizabeth. Crawford explains in her memoir, The Little Princesses, that he came aboard the King’s yacht for meals, and caused Elizabeth to turn ‘pink-faced’. Apparently her affection for him was noted by Philip’s uncle and aide to the King, Lord Mountbatten, who was also aboard and he wrote in his diary that their initial meeting was ‘a great success’.\n\nSome of the Queen’s relatives spoke openly about Elizabeth’s fondness for Philip during those early days. Among them was Margaret Rhodes, Elizabeth’s cousin, who wrote in her autobiography that ‘Elizabeth was truly in love from the very beginning’.\n\nThe engagement didn’t come for a while. In fact, it came eight years later, after the war in 1947, with the marriage taking place at Westminster Abbey in November that same year. Little did Elizabeth know that in a matter of five years, she would ascend to the throne and become Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nRead More\n\nWho are the Hensons? Meet Olivia Henson's aristocratic family, who have ties to banking empires and the social scene's most sought-after sisters\n\nTwo households, both alike in dignity, in fair Chester where we lay our scene …\n\nFast forward to Prince Philip’s death on 9 April 2021 and the couple had been married a total of 74 years, with four children, eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Side-by-side they had travelled all over the world, from Australia to America, Antigua and India, flying the flag for the Commonwealth. They shared total commitment to their duties and service, and always had each other to lighten the burden of public life with a little bit of laughter."
