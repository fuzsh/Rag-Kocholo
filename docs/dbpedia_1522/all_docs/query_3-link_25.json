        "text": "William and Kate first met when they enrolled at the University of St Andrews in Scotland in September 2001.\n\nAt first, the Prince was on the same course as his future wife (Art History) but he later switched to Geography.\n\nThe pair were friends at first but it's widely believed that Kate caught William's eye when she took part in a student charity fashion show in 2002, where she wore a sheer dress on the catwalk.\n\nThe Prince reportedly paid Â£200 for a front-row seat!\n\nThe rumours about an impending royal engagement went into overdrive when Kate attended William's passing-out parade at the Royal Military Sandhurst in 2006.\n\nShe was also joined by her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, who are said to share a close relationship with their son-in-law.\n\nIt was a major moment in William and Kate's relationship, as Queen Elizabeth II was also present at her grandson's graduation ceremony.\n\nIn April 2007, there were reports that William and Kate - pictured at Cheltenham races just one month earlier - had parted ways.\n\nIt was a brief split and shortly after Kate was spotted sitting two rows behind William at the Concert for Diana that July, they reconciled their relationship.\n\nTouching on their break-up in their engagement interview, William said: \"We were both very young, it was at university, we were both finding ourselves as such and being different characters and stuff, it was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up, it was a bit of space and a bit of things like that and it worked out for the better.\"\n\nKate added: \"I think at the time I wasn't very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person, you find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realised, I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you are younger and I really valued that time for me as well although I didn't think it at the time.\"\n\nWilliam and Kate's second child Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diane was born on 2 May 2015 at the Lindo Wing.\n\nCharlotte made history at the age of two as she was the first female royal to benefit from The Succession to the Crown Act (2013), which states that girls will not be overtaken by any future younger brothers.\n\nShe kept her place in the line of succession above her younger brother, Prince Louis, when he was born in April 2018."
