Have an account? .\n\nPrincess Diana and then-titled Prince Charles were married for 15 years.\n\nThe couple's complex relationship is shown in the latest season of \"The Crown.\"\n\nPhotos show how Charles and Diana's relationship changed through the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiana Spencer first met then-titled Prince Charles in 1977, when he was casually dating her sister Lady Sarah (pictured). Diana was just 16 at the time, and Charles was 28.\n\nDiana and Charles reconnected in 1980, three years after they met. Press attention was an obstacle from the beginning, as Diana was followed by photographers before their engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiana and Charles announced their engagement on February 24, 1981. When asked by an interviewer whether they were in love, Charles said: \"Whatever in love means.\"\n\nThey tied the knot at St. Paul's Cathedral in London on July 29, 1981. They had their first kiss on the Buckingham Palace balcony, becoming the first royal couple to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn audio of Diana that was later shared in the documentary \"Diana: In Her Own Words,\" the princess called her wedding \"the worst day of my life.\"\n\nRead more: Princess Diana once said her royal wedding to Prince Charles was the 'worst day of my life'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1983 they took their first overseas tour together in Australia with Prince William. It was the tour that secured Diana's position as the \"people's princess,\" and this reportedly made Charles jealous.\n\nSource: Vogue\n\nDiana and Charles shared this sweet moment at a polo match in July 1984, two months before Prince Harry was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir marriage \"went down the drain\" when Harry was born in 1984, according to Diana. Here they are with their second son on the hospital steps shortly after his birth.\n\nThe couple still displayed affection in public throughout the years that followed, however. Here they are sharing a kiss at a polo match in 1985.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey shared another kiss during a visit to Oman the following year.\n\nWith their two children, William and Harry, the Wales family appeared picture-perfect from an outside perspective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBehind the scenes, however, things weren't working out. The couple officially separated in 1992 and continued to carry out their royal duties separately. They didn't divorce until four years later, in 1996.\n\nThey still appeared in public together as a family in the years between their separation and divorce. Here they are with William and Harry in 1994.\n\nSource: Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiana shared her side of the story during the now-famous BBC \"Panorama\" interview in 1995, in which she said \"there were three of us in the marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\"\n\nDiana lost her HRH status after the divorce, and her title was restyled to Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThe princess died from injuries sustained in a car crash in Paris a year later. She was said to be on good terms with Charles before her death.\n\nAccording to Tina Brown's book \"The Diana Chronicles,\" released in 2008, the couple had become friends after the divorce, though Diana was said to have still had feelings for the prince. The claim has never been officially confirmed.\n\n\"Charles got into the habit of dropping in on her at Kensington Palace and they would have tea and a sort of rueful exchange,\" Brown wrote, according to Elle. \"They even had some laughs together.\"\n\n\"It was definitely calming down, the boys were older. They talked about their philanthropies. And she had accepted Camilla. One thing she had finally done was really understand that Camilla was the love of his life, and there was just nothing she could do about it … But she said to me at that lunch that she would go back to Charles in a heartbeat if he wanted her,\" Brown wrote.\n\nRead next\n\nPrincess Diana The Crown Royal Family\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
