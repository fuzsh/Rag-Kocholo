Itâs a home town thing for me and the Princess is DECATUR!\"\n\nBonnie Hamric\n\nSource: Facebook\n\n\"This is a great old theatre. Reminded me of times past. I was here due to an auction, but was able to walk through the entire place. This place would be a great place just to visit and if you have a reason to go to it, go. Walk around and explore.\"\n\nJP Aus\n\nSource: Google\n\n\"It was a lovely, loving, lively event filled with kind people, delicious food, and good music at a great venue. Really enjoyed all the roaring 20s attire in honor of the 100 year anniversary of the theater.\"\n\nKimberly McCracken\n\nSource: Google"
