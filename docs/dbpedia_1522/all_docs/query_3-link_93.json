        "text": "It's no secret that Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, has a passion for photography (she even launched a nationwide project centred on it during lockdown). Luckily, it's also something that she has a real talent for too – as evidenced by all the gorgeous portraits of the royal family that she's treated us to over the years.\n\nAs well as being something she's naturally interested in, it's thought that there could be another motive for Kate taking on the role of unofficial royal photographer: if she's behind the camera, it means the photos have a more natural feel to them and the family can enjoy a little more privacy, free from professional snappers wanting to be present during their personal moments.\n\nA prime example? When Kate took the first officially released portrait following Princess Charlotte's birth back in 2015. According to one royal expert, Camilla Tominey, the Princess was inspired by Queen Victoria of Sweden, who has adopted a similar approach with her own family, in an effort to thwart any paparazzi.\n\nKate's photography skills really shine through when it comes to pictures of her husband Prince William and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, especially when capturing them in the great outdoors, enjoying time in nature.\n\nTo celebrate the Princess of Wales' talent, here are some of our favourite photographs that she's taken and treated the nation with. Do enjoy!\n\nQueen Elizabeth II surrounded by her grandchildren (2022)\n\nShared on what would have been Queen Elizabeth II's 97th birthday, a moving image of the former monarch surrounded by ten of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, was posted to the Wales' Instagram account.\n\nThe image was captioned: \"Today would have been Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s 97th birthday. This photograph - showing her with some of her grandchildren and great grandchildren - was taken at Balmoral last summer. 📸 The Princess\".\n\nPrincess Charlotte turns seven (2022)\n\nAlthough exactly when this delightful portrait of Charlotte was taken, we do know that her mother, the Princess of Wales, was the one behind the camera at the time. The beautiful shot was shared on the Wales' Instagram account last March, with the caption: \"Thank you for all the lovely messages on Princess Charlotte’s seventh birthday! 📸 The Duchess\".\n\nA day prior, the below photos (from the same series) were also shared, featuring a cameo from the young Princess' much-loved dog.\n\nPrince George celebrates his eighth birthday (2021)\n\nTo mark his eighth birthday, the then-Duke and Duchess of Cambridge shared a sweet photo of their eldest son, Prince George. In the photo, which understandably amassed over a million likes, Prince George beams at the camera as his mum captures the special moment.\n\nPrince Louis has his fourth birthday (2022)\n\nAs has become tradition for the Wales family, a new portrait taken by their mother is shared on social media the day before their birthday. For Prince Louis' fourth, things were no different – and these fun beach shots were offered up to the public. You can really see his mischievous spirit in them!\n\nThe Queen and Prince Philip with their great-grandchildren (2018)\n\nAhead of his funeral, the Royal Family shared an emotional photo of Prince Philip with a selection of his great-grandchildren. In the image, shot by the then-Duchess of Cambridge in 2018, the late Queen and her late husband sit on the sofa at Balmoral Castle with the royal children gathered around them.\n\nPrince George and the late Prince Philip (2021)\n\nFollowing the death of Prince Philip, his grandson Prince William took to social media to share a poignant tribute, praising the late Duke of Edinburgh's many acts of service throughout his life supporting the Queen. Accompanying the message was a photograph of Prince George when he was a toddler, riding a carriage with his great-grandfather, taken by Kate.\n\nPrince Louis' third birthday portrait (2021)\n\nTo mark her youngest child's third birthday and his first day of nursery, the Princess shared a sweet snap of Louis riding his bike and looking extremely cute.\n\nQueen Camilla's Country Life cover (2022)\n\nWhen her step-mother-in-law, Queen Camilla, agreed to appear on the front cover of Country Life she apparently had a special request: that the Princess of Wales would be the one to take the smiling portrait of her in the gardens of her home in Witlshire.\n\nSharing a little behind-the-scenes shot of the Princess in action, the Clarence House Instagram account wrote: \"In celebration of The Duchess of Cornwall’s upcoming 75th birthday and the magazine’s 125th anniversary, Her Royal Highness has guest edited a special commemorative edition of @CountryLifeMagazine, to be published on Wednesday 13th July.\n\n\"📸 Commissioned by The Duchess of Cornwall as guest editor, Her Royal Highness invited The Duchess of Cambridge to capture the cover image at her home in Wiltshire, Raymill.\"\n\nPrincess Charlotte's sixth birthday portrait (2021)\n\nPrincess Charlotte turned six in May 2021, and to celebrate her birthday, royal social media channels shared a lovely photo of Kate and Will's only daughter, taken by her mum.\n\nPrince Philip and Mia Tindall (2021)\n\nAfter Prince Philip's death, another family member who shared a touching tribute on social media was Mike Tindall, husband to Princess Anne's daughter, Zara. \"It’s been a very sad week but it has given us time to reflect on great memories and stories both personal and shared. A devoted family man who we will forever miss but always love,\" Mike said, along with a photo of the late Duke eating snacks with Mike and Zara's eldest daughter Mia, taken by Kate.\n\nPrince William and Prince Charles' Father's Day portrait (2019)\n\nThis sweet snap of the King and his heir, taken at Sandringham, was first shared for Father's Day, June 2020 – however it was taken in December 2019. We love how happy both William and Charles look.\n\nPrince William and his three children George, Charlotte and Louis (2020)\n\nTaken in June 2020, showing the family posing on a swing, we bet Kate felt super proud of this picture. How much of a little cherub is Louis here? A fun family pile-on shot was also shared via the then-Kensington Royal Instagram account shortly afterwards.\n\nPrince George and his new baby sister, Princess Charlotte (2015)\n\nWhat an undeniably adorable portrait this is! Kate took this one of Prince George and a then-baby Charlotte not long after she was born and besides the iconic photo of her leaving hospital, and being cradled by her parents on the steps outside, this was the first real glimpse the world caught of the Princess. So lovely.\n\nPrincess Charlotte's fifth birthday portraits (2020)\n\nThe royals treated us to not one, but five pictures of little Charlotte as part of her fifth birthday celebrations. They show her working hard to create food packages for isolated pensioners in her local area during the coronavirus lockdown. What a wee angel.\n\nPrince Louis' second birthday portraits (2020)\n\nThe tot's messy handprint painting session has now been seen by millions, many of whom loved the symbolism of his rainbow colour scheme, which they believed could have been a subtle tribute to the NHS. We love that the Princess also shared a little 'Instagram vs Real Life' moment with the public too, in which Louis decorates his face... as well as the intended paper!\n\nPrince George's fourth birthday portrait (2017)\n\nClearly a friend of the animals, George can be seen here offering to share his ice cream with a very well-behaved looking dog on a picnic blanket at Kensington Palace. Honestly, even the royal pooches look glossier than any dog we've ever seen in real life.\n\nPrince William during a visit to a melting glacier at the Hindu Kush mountain, Pakistan (2019)\n\nWhile it's undoubtedly a stunning landscape shot, this photograph was shared by William and Kate's Instagram account to highlight the devastating impact that climate change is having on the world (something that King Charles has long been vocal about).\n\nPrince Louis as a baby with sister Princess Charlotte (2018)\n\nTaken on 2 May 2018, Princess Charlotte's third birthday, the young royal can be seen here giving her new baby brother a kiss and cuddle. So sweet! Prince Louis was just nine days old in this one.\n\nA family Christmas celebration (2019)\n\nThe Waleses chose to share this striking black and white picture of William and the three children in Norfolk by way of wishing the nation a very merry Christmas in December 2019. It certainly warmed our hearts! \"We wish all our followers a very happy and relaxing Christmas Day\" was part of the accompanying caption.\n\nPrince George's sixth birthday celebrations (2019)\n\nShowing one of her royal offspring donning some casual clothes, George looks over the moon to be repping his England shirt here!\n\nPrincess Charlotte's fourth birthday celebrations (2019)\n\nAccompanying a series of images released for Charlotte's birthday (all taken by the Princess of Wales, showing her daughter enjoying some outdoor playtime) were captioned, \"The photographs were taken in April by The Duchess at Kensington Palace and at their home in Norfolk.\"\n\nPrince Charles cuddling Prince Louis (2020)\n\nPosted by the then-Clarence House social media team, this touching picture shows Prince Louis giving his grandfather a big squeeze. The photo was released to celebrate Louis turning two years old.\n\nPrincess Charlotte's first day of nursery (2018)\n\nA big milestone in any toddler's life, Kate was on hand to capture the morning of Charlotte's first day at Willcocks Nursery School. She looks every inch the mini fashion icon in her matching red coat, bow, shoes and backpack. Perhaps it's the Princess' favourite colour?\n\nPrince George's seventh birthday portrait (2020)\n\nTo mark the seventh birthday of Prince George, royal social media accounts shared a snap of the young royal, taken by his mum, Kate."
