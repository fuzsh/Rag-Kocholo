We recently returned from a lovely 7 days at WDW (18 days in Orlando all together) and I came home with over 2500 photos on my memory card! On one of the days that we visited the Magic Kingdom we grabbed fast passes for the princess meet n greet. Aurora, Belle and Cinderella were fantastic with our children and especially our DS 5 who has Cerebral Palsy. He does not communicate except for a few chosen words here and there, but he was in awe of each of the princesses. I believe they were smitten with him too as they each gave him a parting kiss which he LOVED! Here are his 'smooch' pics, with the Cinderella ones being my absolute favorite of all of the pics I took over the whole trip!
