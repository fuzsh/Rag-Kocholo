The Committee have again the pleasing duty of congratulating the Members of the Sussex Archaeological Society on the continued prosperity and advance of the Society ; in evidence of which they may refer to the interest excited, both locally and among the literary public, by the contents of their Second Volume; to the crowded meeting held at Arundel in August 1849, and to the interesting proceedings of subsequent meetings at Brighton and East Bourne. To these outward signs of activity and success, may be added the extension of the Society's influence pervading all classes, so as to secure a ready co-operation on all subjects of Archaeological interest, and which is evidenced by the number of Members, now amounting to 342, constituting the Society. With such encouragement, there can be no room for doubt of its progress, or for distrust of a friendly feeling having been generally awakened towards its main objects — the better explanation of the ancient history of the County, and the more careful preservation of the ancient buildings, monuments, or documentary evidence. The prosecution of such a purpose is well calculated to teach the present generation the value of the blessings they enjoy by a true representation of the manners and customs of former times. It is the earnest hope of the Committee that the contents of the present Third Volume may be considered as contributing fresh materials to Sussex history, and may meet with a favourable acceptance from those, who have welcomed the former publications. By the financial position of the Society at the close of 1849, it found itself possessed of a balance of £49. 18s. 6d. in the hands of the Treasurer, after discharging all liabilities, and also of £87. 3s. Stock of the Three per Cents, purchased by the £5 compositions. There was also a considerable amount of subscriptions in arrear, the early payment of which by the Members is confidently relied upon.

Cooper's History of the Priory and Church of Wilmington, illustrated by numerous Drawings, was communicated, and reserved for future publication. The * is prefixed to those papers and objects which are published in the present Volume. Some Papers of fresh interest are necessarily deferred, especially those relating to recent discoveries of Eoman remains at Balmer, Westergate, &c, and of a Eoman road near Eastbourne ; and the Committee take this op- portunity of earnestly requesting the assistance of all their Members to render more complete a general account of all the traces of Eoman occupation in Sussex, which it is their wish to include in the Fourth Volume. Any com- munication denoting the localities of such discoveries will be thankfully received by W. Figg. Esq. Lewes, who has undertaken to collect such particulars. It is proposed in an early volume to give a descriptive list of all the Tradesmen's Tokens issued in Sussex in the seventeenth century. Members possessing specimens are requested to communicate with W. Harvey, Esq., Lewes. The thanks of the Society are due to John Peter Eearon, Esq., for presenting the Society with the plate of Ockenden House, his own residence, as an ornamental embellishment of the curious Diary of Timothy Burrell, published in the present volume, and the same Diary has been also fortunate enough to be further illustrated by the kindness of James Htjrdis Esq., who has preserved the appearance of the original MS. in the faithful copies of its rude drawings by the liberal devotion of his skill.

JOHN SHARPE, LATE CURATE OF SHIPLEY, AND COMMUNICATED BY SIR CHARLES MERRIK BURRELL, BART., M.P , WITH REMARKS, BY W. H. B. (READ AT ARUNDEL, AUGUST 9, 1840.) Of the six great feudal fortresses, each of which anciently defended a Rape of Sussex, one only has added the mag- nificence of modern luxury to the sternness of its antique strength ; while four of the others have long been reduced to scanty ruins, and the sixth was in very early times purposely destroyed, and its site occupied by a monastery. Knepp Castle, in the parish of Shipley, though never one of the principal strongholds, and though a ruin for more than 600 years, was frequently the residence of a king, and is said to have exhibited, even in the last century, considerable traces of its extent within the angle of two small streams falling ultimately into the river Adur. West of the ruins is a field, now called Town Field, which was an approach by a raised road, and a bridge, probably a drawbridge. There remains of it now only the broken wall of a single tower, with a flat buttress, upon a small mound;1 but its de- molition is not due either to war or neglect. The period of its history, authenticated by the few documents relating to it, is very brief; and it will be seen that it is all comprised within the reign of King John, into whose hands, together with Bramber, it had been seized on the forfeitme of William de Braose. This nobleman had incurred the king's anger by 1 For a view in 1775, see Grose, vol. iii, where the succession of owners is also detailed. 2 DOCUMENTS RELATING TO KNEPP CASTLE various disputes and refusals to pay fines for his large posses- sions in Ireland, and at last escaped to die at Paris in 1212, his wife and eldest son William having perished at Windsor in prison, in 1210. It is to this circumstance that we owe the following notices of Knepp in the national archives, and even these will be found to refer as much to the timber and game of the adjoining forest as to the Castle. Indeed the necessity of providing a store of food for the winter in those times, made hunting in the forests an urgent duty. King John was at Knepp on April 8, 1206 ; on January 6, and again from May 28 to June 1, in 1209 ; from April 6 to 9, in 1211 ; and from January 21 to 24, in 1215 ; and it will be seen that his Queen Isabella made a residence of eleven days here, in 1214-15. Some confusion arising from the regnal years of King John commencing from the move- able feast of the Ascension, it is sufficient here to state that they were generally reckoned from May to May. At his first visit the king signed an order to protect the men and lands of Humphrey le Dene against any lawsuits, as long as he should be absent in Ireland on the king's ser- vice. 10th John, Rot. Pat. Most of the deeds are addressed to Roeland Bloet, who seems to have been the king's confidential agent at Knepp, Cnapp, or Cnappe, as it was variously named. The castle was a member of the honor of Bramber. The documentary ex- tracts were originally collected by the Rev. John Sharpe, when curate of Shipley, the learned translator of William of Malms - bury, who also assisted in preparing the materials for 1 Monu- ment a Historica Britannica,' lately published by government. \" The King to Roeland Bloet, 8f c. — We send to you Michael de Puning, commanding that you permit him to take all the fat deer he can without the park at Cnapp : as well by bow as by his dogs ; and that you cause them to be salted (saliri) ; and act for our advantage, as well concerning their flesh as their skins (tarn de carne quam de coriis).

The crisis of the king's fate was now approaching ; the dis- contented barons had been received by the Londoners in triumph, on Sunday, May 24, and on June 19 Magna Charta was signed ; after which the king immediately prepared to annul it. A subsequent order alludes to the foreign merce- naries whom he had invited over, and whom he personally welcomed at Dover on their arrival, Sept. 1, 1215. \" The King to Reidand Bloet, greeting. — Know ye that the citizens of London have surrendered the city of London to our enemies, on Sunday next before the feast of St. Dunstan, in the morning, of their free will (spontanea voluntate).

At this time King John thought it politic to come to terms I with the Braose family, and to restore Bramber and Knepp, not indeed to the heir, son of him who had perished in prison four years previously, but to his uncle Giles, bishop of Here- ford, who, after having actively taken the part of the barons against the king, and recovered by force some of the family castles in Wales, had now recently made his submission, and having paid a fine, received the king's pardon and a grant of the hereditary property of the Braoses. The following letter authorises him to have seizin of Knepp Castle, but the bishop unfortunately died in less than a month, November 17, 1215, when about to assume possession. John de Monmouth, then appointed the temporary warden of Knepp, had been a wealthy ward of the bishop's father. To ensure the delivery of the castle, the king sent his half-brother, William Longespee, earl of Salisbury, who had steadily adhered to him ; but at length the personal wrongs inflicted on him by the king's vices drove this earl also, like Warenne, to desert him in the following year, and join the French prince Louis. \" The King to Boeland Bloet, 8fc. — Know ye that we have received our venerable father, E.10 bishop of Hereford, into our full favour, and have restored to him all the lands, tene- ments, and castles of which his father was seized as in fee, in consideration of the fine which the bishop has paid to us on that account.

Whether this peremptory order was immediately acted upon is unknown ; but it may partly account for the early disap- pearance of Knepp Castle from history, and the removal of the garrison at this time seems confirmed by a subsequent order, when the king, at Leymenestre {Leominster, co.

As King John died on October 19, only four months later than the order of demolition, it is not at all probable that it was fully executed in that short period, in the midst of civil war, and with such imperfect methods of destruction as were then known ; but fire could easily have rendered Knepp Castle uninhabitable by a garrison, and so the king's object would be fulfilled. A similar order of destruction was also given with respect to Pevensey Castle, on the earl de Warenne's defection at this time. In the pressure of civil war, King John, though ready to order the demolition of his own castle, yet was at times will- ing to ensure the safety of his subjects by a compromise, and very recently, on June 9, 1216, from Devizes, he had ad- dressed to the barons of Winchelsea a permission, in case of a descent of his enemy, Prince Louis of Prance, upon that town, to offer him 200 marcs, to exempt the town from fire and damage. 18°, Rot. Pat., p. 187. There are but few subsequent notices of Knepp in the Records. In 1218 there is a deed addressed to William de Braose, relating to the honour of Cnapp (2° Hen. Ill, Rot. Pat.) In 1280, April 13, an order from William de Braose to his bailiff is dated from Kneppe (Cartwright's Bramber). In 1323-4 there is a grant allowing Alionora, widow of John de Mowbray, to surrender to Hugh le Dispenser, earl of Winchester, the notorious favourite of Edward II, the castle and manor of Brembre in fee, and the manors of Knapp, Shoreham, Horsham, and Beaubusson, in the county of Sussex. 17° Edw.

ON AN ANCIENT RECTORY-HOUSE, IN THE PARISH OF WEST DEAN, WITH SOME REMARKS ON THE CHURCH. BY THE RE V. GEORGE MILES COOPER. (READ AT BRIGHTON, DEC. 6, 1849.) In the village of West Dean, near Seaford, is an ancient structure, possessing, I think, a considerable degree of interest, as a specimen of the domestic architecture of the middle ages. Residences of the nobility and dignified ecclesiastics of those times, in tolerable preservation, are of not unfre- quent occurrence ; the skill and solidity with which they were constructed, and the opulence of those great families or official personages who have been their successive possessors, having secured them from the ordinary fate of meaner and more fragile edifices. But specimens so complete as this, of what may be con- sidered as the dwelling-houses of the middle class of the people in that remote period, have not so often fallen under my own observation : and if I shall be able to show, by pro- bable evidence, that this is one of the few instances of small houses belonging to the 14th century, which have survived the wreck of time, and come down almost unimpaired to the 19th, those who are interested in the study of antiquities will perhaps judge it to be worthy of some public notice. This curious house, which belongs to the rectory, stands contiguous to the churchyard, and is now tenanted by two labourers. It is built, with a lavish expenditure for its size, of stone and oak timber; the former excellently cut for the quoins, copings, door-arches, and mullions of the windows. Its walls are about 14 \\ feet high, and 2ft. 6 in. thick. It is distinguished by what I believe is generally thought a mark 14 A N C I EN T R ECTO It V - J I OU S E of high antiquity, a staircase (Plate I, fig. 1), whose walls, of very solid masonry, project externally, square without, and semi-cylindrical within, roofed over with stone of good work- manship, and attached to the north end of the house. This contains a spiral stair of stone, forming the communication between the two stories, the floor between which consists of massive beams (15 in. by 8in.), and joists (5 to 7in. by Sin.) the entrances to the stairs, both above and below, being mas- sive pointed arches, of equilateral proportion (Plate II, fig. 4). The doors themselves are of oak, presenting, together with their fittings, the appearance of great age. A small cellar, half sunk below the surface, at the south end, seems to have served for a store ; as does also a singular projecting part at the south-west corner of the building, which is of quadran- gular form, and had originally no light. A loft, extending the whole length of the roof, which is comparatively modern, lighted by two small, unglazed windows at the north end, and accessible, only by a ladder, may once have answered the same purpose, but has long ceased to be used at all. Of the fireplaces, the one below is so much disguised by modern alterations, that I can hardly conjecture its original cha- racter ; but that in the chamber above remains as at first, a spacious hearth, raised above the floor, and covered with a projecting funnel (Plate II, fig. 3), which rests upon two brackets, the whole of stonework, plain but substantial. Upon a comparison of the two buildings, one might be led, by general appearances, to assign to the rectory about the same date as to the adjacent church. Both are built of the same material, flint, faced with the green sandstone, found on the coast at Eastbourn, and so much used in the churches of this neighbourhood. This forms here the mullions of the windows, the arches, and other ornamental work, with occa- sionally a small admixture, in the church, of sandstone of a reddish colour. The house bears every note of a genuine structure, unaltered in its main features to an extent which is at first sight surprising, if it belong to the period which I suppose. There is no record that I am aware of, nor any tradition going far back, which directly throws light upon the history of this ancient building. But there are certain sources of IN THE PARISH OF WEST DEAN. 15 information which may perhaps enable us to frame a probable conjecture as to its origin and date. I find in the charters of the Norman Abbey of St. Mary Grestein, as given in the ' Monasticon,' that amongst its English possessions were the churches of East Dean and West Dean. It is well known that the Priory of Wilmington was a cell of that foreign abbey ; and amongst the references given by Tanner, relating to this priory, is one which mentions that the \" Prior de Wil- mington habet in proprios usns ecclesiam de Wilmington et ecclesias sive praebendas de Est-dene et Westham.\" — The latter I take to be erroneously written Westham for West- dene ; since West Dean is expressly named in the charters above alluded to, whereas no mention is there made of West- ham. At any rate it is certain that the church of West Bean formed part of the possessions of St. Mary Grestein, of which the prior and monks of Wilmington were first the ad- ministrators and eventually the possessors. My conjecture therefore is, that by them was built the rectory-house. The edifice, small as it is, would be too costly for the incumbent of so moderate a preferment to have erected for himself; whilst it would be quite in keeping with the ampler resources and possibly better taste of the monastery. The architectural details also exhibited in the accompanying drawings, will be found, I think, to confirm the supposition I venture to make. Now if it be conceded that the house was erected by the Benedictine monks of Wilmington, this will enable us to assign an approximate date. Eor as the priory was sup- pressed towards the end of the reign of Henry IV, and its estates transferred to the cathedral church of Chichester, the chapter of which was confirmed in possession by statute 1 and 2 Henry V, the erection of the building must have been antecedent to 1413, the year of Henry Vth's accession. The priory owed its origin to a grant of the manor of Wil- mington to the Abbey of Grestein, in the reign of William I, by Robert earl of Moreton ; and it appears from the charter that the church of West Dean was part of the original gift of that nobleman, about the end of the 11th century. Erom these grounds, then, I am disposed to infer that this rectory- house is not far short, if at all, of being 500 years old; L6 ANCIENT RECTORY-HOUSE having been first designed as a cell for the residence of onel or more; monks, to whom the pastoral care of the parishioners,! the public services of the church, and perhaps the manage- m ment of its temporalities, were committed. Its preservation during so long a period may be partly ac- 1 counted for by the seclusion of its situation. The village of I West Dean is, and always has been, extremely small, the popu- m lation at present being only 129: it is embosomed in the i hills, with no public road through it ; a striking example of a I sequestered Southdown hamlet. The church bears evident marks of higher antiquity than the date of its transfer to the chapter of Chichester, a.d. 1413. It is of the simplest form (Plate III, fig. 2), a parallelogram, with a bell-tower at the west end, surmounted by a low irre- gular four-sided spire. The extreme internal length is 69 feet, the width 16 feet. It contains several features of architec- tural interest — proofs doubtless of the pious care of the priors, J its early patrons. In the chancel are two mural recesses under arched canopies ; the one of great simplicity of design and ancient character ; the other (Plate IV, fig. 3) more de- I corated, and with the appearance of having been at some time used as a ministerium or sepulchrum Christi. There is reason to think that they were monuments of some family of distinction settled in this place at an early period. It appears from the records of Edward the First's journeys in Sussex, that this monarch, when staying at Lewes, paid a morning visit to West Dean, and dated a writ from thence, on the 25th of June, 1305. (See Suss. Arch. Coll., vol. II, j pp. 156-7.) A manor-house of some importance, owned and occupied early in the 17th century by the Thomas family, was pulled down about twenty-five years since, having been long used as a farmhouse, and being then too much dilapidated for repair. An elaborate monument of some members of that family, date 1639, is in the chancel of the church. There appears to have been nothing to separate the nave from the chancel but a wooden screen (removed not many years ago), and a rood-loft ; part of the stone stair leading into the latter is still visible, inserted in the north wall behind the pulpit. But at the western end a circular arch (Plate IV, IN THE PARISH OF WEST DEAN. 17 fig. 5) of considerable beauty, 6 feet 4 inches in span, spring- ing from short shafts, each consisting of three clustered round pillars 1 foot 9 inches high, with capitals 4 inches high, and bases 1\\ inches high, of roll moulding, resting upon solid piers of squared stone 4 feet high — leads from the nave through a \\ narrow belfry (7 feet wide) to the western door. I In the east window (Plate III, fig. 5), 13 feet high and 7 feet j broad, the mullions branch off into circular arches on each side, the intersections of which form the compartments for 1 the tracery with which the head is filled. Immediately below j it, across the whole width of the chancel, runs a string-course (Plate IV, fig. 4) of early English or decorated pattern, a roll moulding, of which the upper part overlaps the lower. The two south windows (Plate III, figs. 3, 4) have their iambs considerably splayed ; that to the east, 4 feet 6 inches by 1 foot four inches, is a single, the other, 6 feet 3 inches by 3 feet 9 inches, a double light, with a circular head, including a sexfoil, both having the interior recesses neatly arched. The window next the porch is a modern insertion. A narrow single window on the north side, 4 feet 10 inches by 1 foot 3 inches, gives light to the pulpit. The above are all of pointed trefoil. On the outside of the north wall, towards the tower, is a small window of very rude character, probably Norman, 1 foot 9 inches by 6 inches, now stopped with flint- work (Plate III, fig. 6.) The west window is of the perpen- dicular style. In the opening of the single south window, just without the altar-rail, is a piscina, let into the wall, and inclosed between columns terminated above by the bottom of the recess of the window (Plate III, fig. 4 ; Plate IV, fig. 2) ; this gives them a truncated appearance, though probably at first so constructed. The basin is elegantly scalloped, radiating from the centre. The remains of a stoup for holy water, broken off close to the surface of the wall, are on the east side of the south entrance. The font is square and massive, placed upon a raised base near the west door, supported in the centre by the usual cylindrical drain, and at the corners by four octagonal pillars ; IS ANCIKNT RECTORY-HOUSE like most of the stonework of these two buildings, it is in! perfect preservation. The earliest date one can assign to all j these details, except the west window, seems to he anterior to 1400. The soil of the churchyard is much higher than the j floor of the church, especially on the north side, partly owing to the site having a natural slope to the south ; but the rise of the surface at the west entrance, to the height of full twenty inches, entirely concealing the sill and lower parts of the door jambs, cannot be so explained, and must have taken place subsequently to the erection of the building. It has doubt- less resulted from that accumulation of matter which, in the case of most of our ancient village churches, has raised the surface of the churchyards so much above their original level. This change can hardly have been produced in any sensible degree, in so very small a village as this, by the human remains consigned to their last resting-places, even in a very long period of years. But it may be accounted for by the consideration that, whenever vaults or steined graves are made, the excavated earth is spread over the surface of the churchyard ; and that fresh turf is continually introduced for the purpose of covering new-made graves, or redressing those which have decayed. Possibly, too, the debris of the edifice, when destroyed or dilapidated, may have augmented the accumulation. These, in the course of ages, appear quite adequate causes for the change of level now observable, when it is borne in mind that popular feeling everywhere forbids the removal of the consecrated earth from the precincts of the church. Thus, there are perpetual additions and no abstractions. Whether the Rectory House is of the age I have conjec- tured, must be determined by its own evidences : to me, these seem to warrant the conclusion I have drawn. It may serve, perhaps, to strengthen this conclusion, that, in the ' Nonarum Inquisitiones' it is stated that the rector of this church had then (a.d. 1340) \"one messuage, & 7-J acres of land, wherewith the church was endowed.\" The land remains the same to this day, and I am disposed to believe in the identity of the house. William de Medestede, a namesake of one of the royal IN THE PARISH OF WEST DEAN. 19 I commissioners, was an attesting juror on that occasion ; ; and might probably be the incumbent, for he is styled 1 \" clericus,\" and said to be \" de eadem parochia.'' The return • shows that the parish was then, as it is now, of small popula- 1 tion and importance ; for the rector's whole income, including I the annual value of the above-mentioned land and messuage, I together with \" the customary offerings, and the tenth of hay, pigeons, gardens, calves, pigs, flax, and other small tithe,\" was valued only at £1 16s. 3d. ; whilst there was no inhabitant who lived by merchandise, nor had any dignitary, or other ecclesiastical person (save the Prior of Wilmington), any property therein. The ancient dovecote, with a numerous tenantry, still remains, but the culture of flax has long since disappeared. Perhaps I may be allowed to add a few words upon a question incapable, it may be, of any very positive solution, but yet one of interest and curiosity. Asser, bishop of St. David's, the friend and secretary of Alfred, mentions, in his book ' De iElfredi Rebus gestis,' the fact of his having had his first interview about the year 885, with King Alfred at Dene,1 which Dallaway (vol. i, p. 174) supposes to be East Dean, included in \" Silleton\" (or Single- ton) in Domesday, afterwards held by the Earl of Arundel (23 Hen. II) of the king, \"in capite,\" as of the honour of Arundel. A Dene also occurs in the Will of Alfred,2 which 1 \" His temporibus ego quoque a rege advocatus de occiduis et ultimis Britanniae finibus ad Saxoniam adveni : cumque per multa terrarum spatia ilium adire proposueram, 'usque ad regionem dexteralium Saxonum, qua Saxonice Suthseaxum appellatur, ductori- bus ejusdem gentis comitantibus perveni ; ibique ilium in villa regia, quae dicitur Dene, primitus vidi,\" \"dato revertendi pignore statuto tempore quarta die ab eo equitantes ad patriam remeavimus, sed cum ab eo discesseramus in Wintonia civitate febris infesta me arripuit.\" (Vide Asser, Odon, 1722, p. 47) 2 Will of King Alfred, ed. Rev. Owen Manning, 4to, Oxon, 1788, p. 17 \" To my eldest son (Ethelward), the land at Eaderingtune, and that at Dene, and at Meone, and at Ambresbyry, and at Deone, and Sturemynster, and at Gifle, and at Cruoen, and at Whitchurch, and at Axemouth, and at Brancescumbe, aud at Columtune, and at Twyfyrd, and at Mylenburn, and at Exanmynster, and at Suthewyrth, and at Liwtune, and the lands that thereto belong, which are all that I in Weal district have, except Triconshire. p. 19. \" And to Athelm, my brother's son, the manor at Ealdingburn, and at Cumtune, and at Crundell, and at Beading, and at Beadinghamme, and at Burnham, and at 20 A NCI ENT RECTORY-HOUSE Mr. Manning, in his notes, concludes to be either in Hants or Wilts, because most of the estates there bequeathed lay among the West Saxons, and none of the lands afterwards mentioned are farther west than Wiltshire. Manning here alludes to the bequests made to the king's younger son ; but of the manors left to his nephews yEthclm and Athelwold, and to Osferth his cousin, many are in Sussex, and several in East Sussex, as llotherfield, Ditchling, Sutton (in Seaford), Lullingminster (Lullington), and Beddingham. In truth, little or no regard is paid to counties in the arrangement of the bequests. There is therefore but slender ground for Mr. Manning's conclusion. We do not, indeed, know that Alfred possessed any other manor of this name, beside the one spoken of by Asser, and that he tells us was in Sussex. If the king had held more than one, it is likely more would have been mentioned in the Will ; or, one only being named, that it would be so designated as to distinguish which he meant. It seems reasonable, therefore, to suppose that the Dene of the Will is identical with the Dene in which Asser first saw Alfred, and which he describes as the king's \" villa regia,\" in the county of Sussex. But then Mr. Dallaway's reasons for thinking this to be East Dene, in the hundred of Singleton, can scarcely be looked upon as conclusive. The language used by Asser, in speaking of his journey — \" I arrived, through great spaces of country, as far as the region of the Saxons on the right hand, which in Saxon is called Suthsex, some guides of the same people accompanying me,\" — seems well to describe his long journey from the extremity of South Wales ; but he would hardly re- quire natives of Sussex for guides to conduct him to a Dene only a few miles over the borders of the county, though their services would be necessary to bring him to a remote village at the eastern extremity of the Southdowns. Regarding this, therefore, as still an open question, I must Thunresfield, and at TEscing. And to Athelwold, my brother's son, the manor at Godel- ming, and at Gyldeford, and at Sterling. And to Osferth, my cousin, the manor at Beccanlea, and at Rytherfield, and at Dicceling, and at Suthtune, and at Lullingminster, and at Angmering, and at Felham, and the lands that thereto belong.\" In the above ex- tract the places in Sussex are in Italics. IN THE PARISH 0E WEST DEAN. 21 put in a modest plea on the part of our West Dean, for the honour of being considered a residence of the most illustrious among our Saxon monarchs. It may be premised, that \" villa regia\" means nothing more than \" a country village, where | the kings of England had a royal seat, and held the manor in ] their own demesne.\" (Jacob in verb.) Beddingham, another \\ property belonging to Alfred, left by him to iEthelm, his ! brother Ethelbert's son (and only eight miles from West Dean), was so held, in the Confessor's time, by his queen Eclitha ;3 and there is nothing incredible in the hypothesis that West Dean itself might be in Alfred's time a royal abode. It was held of the king \" pro manerio,\"4 under the Confessor ; and we have it already in evidence, that a family of rank occupied it in the Norman period, and that it was visited by Edward I. Besides the ruins of the manor-house before mentioned, which show it to have been a large and handsome edifice, there are in a field declining to the south, and presenting one of the best sites in the village, foundations of great extent and solidity, and the whole surface of the ground exhibits manifest indica- tions of large buildings at some remote period, of which the tradition is now entirely lost. It was in the immediate vicinity of the king's other manors — Sutton, in the adjoining parish of Seaford ; and Lullington, separated from it only by the small parish of Littlington ; — places at the present day still more inconsiderable even than West Dean. The downs in this neighbourhood bear clear marks of having been frequented and cultivated in the earliest periods of our history. A resi- dence in them is likely to have been desirable for the king in those troubled times, from their being difficult of access to an invading enemy, and abounding in strong positions for de- fence. The river Cuckmere, which now finds its way with difficulty into the sea in this parish, the mouth of its ancient harbour being blocked up by a bar of shingle, formed once, as is evident from inspection, an estuary, which flowed far in- land to Alfriston, and extended up a side valley to the foot of the slope upon which the village and church of West Dean stand. Thus it was formerly accessible both by land and 3 Domesday, T. 1, f. 21, b. 4 \" Pro manerio;\" \"from the French Manour, habitation, or from manendo, abiding, because the lord of it does usually reside there.\" (Jacob.) 22 ANCIENT RECTORY-HOUSE IN WEST DEAN. water. The very name of the town Alfriston, hard by, seems to savour of the king as its founder. In the absence of more cogent proofs these are sufficient, I think, to render it sup- posable that this sequestered spot is the Dene once dignified by the presence of the great Alfred. Subsequent inquiry leads me to conclude that the family settled at West Dean was that of the Heringauds ; for I find : a.d. 1081-7 . . — (1) Ralph holds of the Earl, in Dene, viii hides. (Domesday.) Temp. H. II ; \"I — (2) Ralph de Dene (whom I take to be his son or grandson) founds i.e. f\"Otteham\" (in Hailsham), for monks of the order of Premontr£; his 1154 to 1189. J daughter Ela marries Jordan de Sackville; and about a.d. 1200 Ralph Heringod (probably Ela's father with the addition of his surname) and Jordan de Saukvill both give land to Grestein. (Tanner, p. 560, and Charter of Grestein.) 1200 to 1250. — (3) Robert de Dene (son of Ralph and brother of Ela), by his wife Sibylla, has Ralph de IcMesham and Robert de Dene; the daughter of the former, Sibylla de IcMesham (who seems to have been sole heiress), carries Icklesham (and it would appear Dene also) by marriage to Nicolas Heringod. (Authorities cited in Horsfield.) 1269 — (4) Their son Ralph Heringod obtains a charter of free warren for his manor of Icklesham. (Burrell MS. 5679.) 1296 — (5) John Heringaud, Villata de Exetes (in W. D. parish), is taxed 45s. 7hd. (Unpublished Subs? Roll, communicated by Mr. Blaauw.) This must be the man whom Edw. I. visited in 1305 — for, 1302 to 1313 — (6) John Heringaud sits six times in parliament as knight of the shire for Sussex. 1333 — (7) Henry de West Dene is knight of the shire. 1340 — (8) Thomas Heringaud appears as a resident in W. D. in the Nonae Return. Upon the whole, it seems highly probable that the Heringods were all along possessors of both Dene and Icklesham • and that Sibylla the second married a cousin.

( INTERIOR.) ON THE CASTLE OF BELLENCOMBRE, THE ORIGINAL SEAT OF THE FAMILY OF DE WARENNE, IN NORMANDY. BY MR. M. A. LOWER. (READ AT ARUNDEL, AUGUST 9, 1849.) Ruins of Bellencombre, 184 9. The interest in the early history of the De Warenne family, excited by the discovery of the remains of William de Warenne and Gundrada, at Lewes Priory, in 1845, led me, during a recent brief stay in Normandy, to visit the principal seat of that ancient race — the Castle of Bellencombre. Eor this purpose I left La Chapelle, the chateau of M. de Breaute, member of the Institute of Erance, in company with M. l'Abbe Cochet, of Dieppe, our foreign associate, taking in our way the towns of Longueville and S. Victor, the former celebrated for its castle and abbey, built in the eleventh century by the Giffards, Earls of Buckingham, and the latter for its monastery, founded by William the Conqueror. 30 CASTLE 01 BELLENCOMBRE. At the distance of a league and a half from S. Victor, at a place little known to the antiquary and rarely visited by the tourist, stand the remains of the habitation of the once potent De Warenncs. A picturesque village of one broad street, consisting of irregular antique houses, chiefly constructed with wood, and flanking the humble mairie, constitutes the bourg of Bellencombre, which occupies a very agreeable and picturesque situation on the western side of the river Varenne. This river, which rises in, and gives name to, the neighbouring commune of Omonville-sur- Varenne, is now more generally known as the riviere d'Arques, because it passes the castle and town of Arques on its way to join the Bethune, which debouches a few miles northward at the haven of Dieppe. The town itself, in early times, bore the same name as the river, and from it the De Warennes took their surname. It was not until the grace- ful mound upon which the castle stands had been cast up, that the spot assumed another name, and was called Bellencombre, which, as Mr. Stapleton observes, may be literally translated Bellus Cumulus, \" the fair mound or pile.\"1 At the present day, Bellencombre is the chef-lieu of a canton in the arrondisse- ment of Dieppe, containing a population of less than 1000 inhabitants. The castle of Bellencombre recently belonged to M. Godard de Belbeuf, of the Chateau de Belbeuf, near Rouen, and pre- viously to the Duchess de Fontaine-Martel, near Bulbec, chatelaine de Cleres, who married the Duke de Bethune- Charrost. It is now in the hands of a small proprietor named M. Dillard. It occupies the artificial mound alluded to, and is appa- rently about 100 feet above the river Varenne. A few massive walls of stone and brick, once a portion of the keep or donjon, constitute the whole of the existing remains. Nor will this excite surprise, when I state that the property was purchased by the present possessor for the sum of 10,000 francs, in the year 1835, for the express purpose of selling the materials; and so little ashamed is the old man of his sordid spoliation, that he told us, with an air of the utmost satisfaction, that he had, within the last ten years sold 18,000 feet of freestone, 1 Vide Archaeological Journal, vol. iii, p. 6. CASTLE OF BELLENCOMBRE. 31 procured by the demolition of the two entrance towers only. The height of these towers was about 50 feet. Unless some friendly influence should arrest the progress of destruction, in a few years more it will have to be said of Bellencombre — \" Etiam perierunt Ruinse !\" In the middle of the donjon, according to M. Dillard's state- ment, stood a Chapel, no remains of which are now visible. The area, inclosed by the vallum and fosse, measures between two and three acres, and includes the parish church of St. Peter. Within the memory of man, a long flight of steps, extended from the warder's lodge to the keep ; but this also has disappeared. The accompanying etchings have been made from drawings taken on the spot in 1832, before the building was delivered over to the spoliating cupidity of M. Dillard. At that date it consisted chiefly of two lofty round towers, with machicolations; but the battlements had disappeared. Between the towers were a principal and a side gateway ; and over these were two longitudinal openings, by means of which the drawbridge was raised. Internally the towers were square ; but the inner walls of the left hand tower had been removed previously to 1832. I need hardly state, that the present owner of Bellencombre Castle had never heard the name of a De Warenne ! Very little appears to be known of the history of the descent of this castle. That it was the caput baronice of the Earls of Warenne is beyond question, although the Norman antiquaries and historians scarcely recognise the fact. Indeed, I was assured, by a very erudite archaeologist, that the earliest record respecting it to be met with in Normandy was dated no earlier than the time of John sa?is Terr e. 2 It is not, therefore, sur- prising that Dr. Watson, the English historian of the family, gives only two or three incidental notices of Bellencombre. It appears from Dugdale, that William de Warenne, the second earl, with Isabel, alias Elizabeth, his wife, gave to the church of All Saints, at Belencumbre, and the infirm brethren there serving God, all his arable lands at S. Martin's, probably part 2 M. Leprevost, however, in his notes to the ' Roman de Rou,' speaking of the De Warennes, says : \" lis poss^daient dans notre province, entre autres domaines, la terre et le Chateau de Bellencomhre.\" (Roman de Rou, p. 241.) 32 CASTLE or BELLENCOMBRE of the ancient paternal estate of the family. The brethren thus referred to were the constituents of a hospital of lepers, founded hen; in early times. Isabel, Countess de Warenne,3 likewise, in the year 1135, gave to these lepers the sum of one hundred shillings, arising out of the borough of Lewes.4 William, fourth Earl of Warenne, by accord between King Stephen and Henry Duke of Normandy, resigned certain rights, on condition that Reginald de Warenne (son of William the second Earl) should, if he thought fit, have the custody of the castles of Bellencombre and Mortimer, giving hostages to the duke for the same, until Henry should become king of England.5 On the separation of England and Normandy, the connexion of the De Warennes with Bellencombre ceased. The castle, however, remained as a fortress till a much later date. In the parish church (which exhibits very evident traces of the style known among us as that pertaining to the Norman period, and which was probably erected by one of the early earls) is an in- cised slab, with an inscription which shows that the governor- ship of the castle was an office existing so lately as the year 1519. It is to the following effect : \" Beneath lie the viscera and intestines of the late noble and puissant Lord, Monsieur James de Moy, in his lifetime Chevalier, Baron of Moy, and hereditary Castellan of this land, lordship, and castelry of Bellencombre. His heart and body are buried in the collegiate church of Moy. He died on Sunday, the 12th of February, in the year of grace 1519.\"6 3 In the MS. book of deeds relating to Lewes Priory (Vespas. F. xv, in Br. Mus.) the name of William de Bellencombre twice occurs, as a witness to confirmatory charters of Countess Isabella, together with Reginald de Warenne, William his son, Oddo priest of Roger de Warenne, &c.

At a still later period the castle must have been in a habit- able state, as pieces of marble moulding, not older than the 17th century, are to be found among the rubbish. About six years since an oblong slab, of black marble, inscribed with the following lines, was found in the garden. It is certainly of the same period. \" MON . II ON N EUR . ET . MA . VIE SONT . DEVX . LOTS . DE . MON . BIEN . QVAND . I/UNE . M'EST . RAVIE . L' AUTRE . NE . m'eST . PLUS . RIEN.\" I inquired of M. Dillard if any other articles had been found, and he stated that about two years since his wife had picked up a silver ring and an antique spur, both of which she had sold. Many tiles of medieval date had also been found. The greater part of them were taken from a corridor in the castle, and are now laid down in the kitchen of the old man's cottage. I was fortunate enough to procure one relic of extremely interesting character, for which this modern Baron of Bellen- combre demanded the moderate sum of two francs, and the sale of which seemed to him a very satisfactory transaction. It is a bronze ivyvern — in the opinion of M. l'Abbe Cochct, of the 13th century. The wyvern or two-legged dragon was the crest or rather badge of the I)e Warenne family ; and the article in question bears a striking general resemblance to some drawings of it made in the time of Henry VII, and en- graved at page 13, vol. i, of Watson. The only material difference between them is, that the latter have expanded checquy wings, while in my bronze figure the wings are close, and very slightly relieved from the back. I may mention that Alice, Countess of Warenne, and consort of John, the seventh earl, was buried in Lewes Priory, in 1290, before the high altar, under a marble tomb, whereon was sculptured a wyvern, or lieraldric dragon, with a branch in its mouth. The coin- cidence may be accidental, but it is certainly highly curious, and deserving of further consideration. in. 3 31 CASTLE 0 V BELLENCOMBRE These few facts, however meagre they may appear, arc all that I was enabled to glean regarding this once-important and interesting spot. I trust, however, that their relation to Sussex history, and their connection with a distinguished race, repre- sented at this time by the noble proprietor of Arundel, will render them acceptable to t"
