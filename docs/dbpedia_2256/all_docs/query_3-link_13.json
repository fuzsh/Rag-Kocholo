        "text": "EX2 8UA - Alphington\n\nAlphington is a former manor and village, now a suburb of the City of Exeter in Devon. The ward of Alphington has a population of 8,250 according to the 2001 census, making it the third largest in Exeter, with the village itself accounting for about a quarter of this figure. The ward population increased to 8,682 at the 2011 census. It is surrounded on two sides by countryside, with the Marsh Barton trading estate to the east and Exeter City to the north. The Alphin Brook passes around the northern edge of Alphington. Alphington is on the south-western side of Exeter.\" [1]\n\nSituated in local authority Alphington, Alphington is classed as urban with city and town. Nearest towns are Exeter (2 miles away), Dawlish (8 miles away), Exmouth (8 miles away), with the capital city, London being 160 miles away.\n\nDevon\n\nAlong with its neighbor Cornwall, Devon seems to be the one region of the UK seemingly designed to appeal to tourists and holidaymakers. Quite apart from the (ever so slightly) Mediterranean climate, Devon has some of Europe's best coastline (for sheer variety) and a magnificent landscape of rolling farmland and fields, steep craggy hills, wild and awe-inspiring moorland as well as the obligatory white sandy beaches and waves made for surfing.\n\nIn addition it offers history buffs a wealth of sites from country houses and gardens to dramatic castles and from stately homes to ancient monuments.\n\nBecause the county has been inhabited since Paleolithic times there are numerous excavated sites worth visiting. In addition there are stone circles dating back to Celtic times (when the area was known as Dumnonia) and the city of Exeter features a seemingly never-ending supply of reminders of its importance during the Roman occupation.\n\nTowns such as Tavistock and Totnes are also packed with historical sites and there are buildings that have been there since before the Norman Conquest. Also worth a visit are Buckland Abbey (home of Sir Francis Drake) and Buckfast Abbey where monks have been producing both stained glass and tonic wine for hundreds of years.\n\nOf course most people head to Devon for the scenery, to visit the never ending supply of breathtaking views and vistas; from Devon's section of England's only natural UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Jurassic Coast, to miles upon miles of rolling hills, upland forests and rugged stone as well as endless beautiful and rustic farmland.\n\nMost exhilarating of all is Dartmoor National Park, covering 370 square miles and offering some of the most spectacular terrain in the UK if not Europe. From wild moorland to wild ponies, this is a special and unspoiled place and somewhere everyone should visit at least once in their lives."
