Another year of successful progress having elapsed, the Members of the Society may well congratulate themselves ; — an Association, which, while promoting much social advantage by the combination of so many classes in one pursuit, has made no inconsiderable contribution to the literary illus- tration of the history and antiquities of the county. The Committee, to whom the practical management of the Society has been entrusted, feel encouraged, by its continued prosperity, to believe that the course they have hitherto adopted has been acceptable to the Members, and that the employment of its funds in the expenses of occasional and general meetings, and in the publication of three volumes of interesting matter has been beneficial to its interests and its character. The Society has, during the year, been increased by a considerable number of new members, amounting to 84, and, at this date (Dec. 31, 1850), reckons 403 members. It is a flattering testimony to its influence to observe that, among these, there are many persons wholly unconnected with Sussex, and that one of its Essays (on Bellencombre, in vol. Ill), has been translated into French, for publication in the 6 Eevue de Eouen.' The accounts for 1850 have been examined, and it is gratifying to state that, all debts having been discharged, a balance of £41. 14s. 3d. remains in the Treasurer's hands, besides the amount of Life Compositions, invested in £107. 14s. lOd.

The other chief items were for advertisements, £9. Is. ; printing circulars, £1. 18s. ; excavations at Balmer, £1. 9s. 6d.; binding 100 vols., I and II, £4. 0s. 2d.; expenses of East- bourne and Herstmonceux Meetings, JE6. Ids. §d. ; parcels, postage stamps, &c, £4. 17s. lOd. Vlll REPORT. Some subscriptions in arrear are also due to the Society ; and there is a considerable stock of its published volumes, the gradual sale of which to the Public, or at reduced prices to new Members, forms an additional source of income, from which £24. 9s. 2d. was received in 1850. A General Meeting took place, at Eastbourne, on May 20th, at which Colonel Elwood presided, where various papers and objects of interest were produced. Report of the Discovery of a Roman Road lately traced near Pole Gate. By Mr. Ade. Description of the Ancient Coins which had been found near Eastbourne and at Pevensey. By Mr. W. Harvey. Some particulars of the Wheatear abounding in the neighbourhood, and the stipulation for a supply of them, found in Leases of Land. By Mr. John Dudeney. *Historical Account of the Priory of Wilmington, and the Church, with numerous Drawings. By Rev. G. M. Cooper. A Papal Dispensation of Leo X, dated June 9, 1516, to permit Thomas Cumbe, Vicar of Arundel, to hold another Benefice in plurality, discovered by the Rev. H. Latham, as forming the outside cover of the Parish Register of Fittleworth. The Site of the Eoman Villa (described in Vol. II, p. 257,) was examined, and the ancient Arched Vault under the Lamb Inn was visited. By the kindness of the Eev. T. Pitman the Church was opened for the inspection of the Members, and the details of its architecture pointed out. The General Annual Meeting took place at Herstmonceux, on Thursday, July 25th, under the presidency of the Venerable Archdeacon Hare. Although it was not so numerously attended as usual, owing to the very unfavourable weather, yet, in all other respects, it was highly successful, and matters of great interest were brought forward. The Members assembled, by permission of H. M. Curteis, Esq., M.P., at Herstmonceux Place, where, among the articles exhibited, were : — Various Original MSS. Documents relating to the Castle. By Rev. E. Venables. Gold Coins of the time of Henry VIII, found at Herstmonceux. By Mr. Miller. A Monumental Slab of Iron, dated 1591, from a Cottage, where it had been used as a Chimney Back. By Sir H. Shiffner, Bart. Leaden Bulla of Pope Innocent IV, found near Battel. By Mr. Rush. Roman Antiquities, from the Iron Works at Old Land, in Maresfield. By Mr. M. A. Lower. Roman Ornamented Fibulas, Glass Bottle, Lamp, &c, found at Westergate, near Arundel, in the Garden of Thomas Shiffner, Esq. Carvings of Fruit and Flowers, bv Grinlin Gibbons, from the old Apartments at Herstmon- ceux Castle. By H. M. Curteis, Esq., M.P. Various Objects of Interest from Rome and Palestine. By Rev. Mr. Towner. Roman Pottery, Sepulchral Vases, and Fibulas, found at Bormer, near Lewes. The following papers were then read : *On Herstmonceux Castle and its Lords. By Rev. Edmund Venables. ♦Glimpses of the Saxon Rule in Sussex. By Rev. C. Bohun Smyth. *On some Early Wills of Inhabitants of Herstmonceux. By Mr. M. A. Lower. *On some Mural Paintings lately discovered in Stedham Church. By Mr. J. Butler, jun. Observations on the Saints represented in the Stedham Paintings, and on the Legends relating to them. By the Rev. Leveson Vernon Harcourt. REPORT. IX A Meeting, at which several Members attended, also took place on I October 16th, at Alfriston, which was the means of introducing fresh matter of antiquarian interest. Some fine Roman Coins were exhibited by Rev. C. Bohun Smyth, who also kindly accom- panied the Members in examining the Church, and explained the Legend of S. Alphege, whose Figure remains in the stained glass there. An ancient Spear Head found near Battle, a British Urn dug up at Dean's Place, and Drawings of the Saxon Coins found at Milton, were exhibited by Mr. C. Ade. *Mr. M. A. Lower read an account of the Star Inn, where the Meeting was held, and its curious external Carvings. *Mr. Blaauw read several Extracts from the Apsley MSS. belonging to Mrs. Mabbott, including original Letters of the Princess Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, and others, relating to the Civil War in Sussex, being a Letter from the Rev. Thomas Sharpe, of Beckly, and a Narrative of the capture of Arundel by the Royalists. *Mr. Blaauw also exhibited some Drawings of Streat Place, by Miss Fitztlugh, and described the Latin Inscriptions of the panelled room there. The most interesting incident during the year 1850, has been the tenancy of the Keep and Gateway of Lewes Castle, by the Society. By the liberal j concurrence of the joint landlords (the Earls of Abergavenny, De la Warr, ! and Amherst), the opportunity offered itself, and the Committee thought that they should best consult the interests of the Society, by occupying, on reasonable terms, a building, which, though not of eminent architectural beauty, was of much historical importance, and the ruins of which, from the beauty of their position and the extensive view commanded from them, have never ceased to be an object of popular resort. Its central situation in the county recommends it as well adapted for the deposit of such books and archaeological remains as may be collected; and the ready sanction of the General Annual Meeting, at Herstmonceux, was, on the motion of the Dean of Chichester, seconded by the Earl of Chichester, unanimously given to this arrangement. The rent agreed upon is £32. a year; but the Committee have thought it advisable, while members should have free admission, to ! impose a trifling charge upon other parties, and it is confidently expected that the proceeds from this source will cover the expenses of the rent and of the necessary superintendence. Some considerable repairs were immediately necessary, to fit up one tower 1 for the residence of the warder, but the expenses of these works will be met by the sale of materials on the demolition of the several modern buildings, comprising stables, a school-room, and a large warehouse, all greatly out of repair, now clustered round the ancient gateway of the castle, which will resume much more of its former dignity by their removal. Lewes; Dec. 31, 1850. Notice. — The General Annual Meeting will take place at Steyning, on Thursday, August 7, 1851. This Volume is distributed free to Members. The price to the Public will be lis. ; but to new Members hereafter joining the Society the price will be 7s., and for them also will be reserved the few remaining copies of previous Volumes, of the Second at 7s. 6d., of the Third at 5s., for which applications mav be made to Mr. W. Harvey, Local Secretary, No. 3, Vliffe, Lewes. X REPORT.

THE MURAL PAINTINGS RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN STEDHAM CHURCH. BY THE KEY. LEVESON VEIINON IIAKCOUET. To confine our attention to the aesthetic department of Archaeology, and to be content with an unintelligent gazing upon works of mediaeval art, or at least to have no other appreciation of their value except as works of art, would be to degrade the science from its true dignity, and to strip it of all its historical and intellectual utility. The discovery of truth is the proper employment of the human understanding within the range assigned to its faculties, and some portions of it will generally reward the search of those who look for them, even in the deep well of fable or legend, in which they lie concealed. I hope to illustrate this proposition by an examination of the frescoes which have recently been dis- covered in pulling down the church of Stedham, and which have been faithfully depicted, so far as the whitewash that covered them could be removed, by Mr. Butler, a son of the architect to whom the rebuilding of the church was confided, the artist having skilfully copied all that the most practised eye could discover. The colour in some parts is so faint, that it is extremely difficult to interpret all the design ; but there are four panels sufficiently intelligible, on which I have to offer a few remarks. Of these subjects, St. George, who occupies the upper part of the centre on the south wall, has the first claim for consideration, both because he is the patron saint of England, and because he furnishes some evidence of the date to which iv. 1 2 MURAL l'ATNTTNdS the paintings are to be ascribed. They arc not coeval with the building of the walls; for they have not that depth and full possession of the plaster, which colours obtain if they are laid on while it is fresh and moist ; strictly speaking, there- fore, they are not frescoes, though, for want of a better, it is a convenient term to designate all those paintings in distemper which Cimabue and Giotto introduced with so much success into Western Europe. The original architecture of the church appears to have been Norman, or rather, perhaps, Saxon ; for the extreme narrowness and scarcity of the windows seem to indicate a darker age, and the name of the place is thoroughly Saxon, being composed of two Anglo-Saxon words, which, being translated, exactly correspond to the English word, ' homestead'; so little light, indeed, could have been admitted through such crevices, that the prayers and exhortations must either have been delivered extempore, or recited from memory; but when the first pointed style of architecture was introduced, the inconvenience was felt to be so great, that two openings were made in the south wall, and a double lancet was intro- duced on each side of the original light, if that can be called a light which scarcely admitted any ; though towards the end of the thirteenth century, probably, one of them was replaced by a double trefoil-headed window ; at the same time, or perhaps somewhat later, the same want of light being still felt, another two-light window was inserted close by the side of the early English one ; but all the alterations were made before the paintings were added. They then nearly covered the north side, which was only pierced by the narrow Saxon windows, till some ruthless churchwarden — perhaps the same who built the tower in 1670, broke through the picture of the Last Judgment, in order to insert a flat-headed three-light window. None of the figures wear the flowing drapery which we see in the productions of the Italian painters ; their dresses have, for the most part, that matter-of-fact formality which might be expected from native artists, among whom the revived art would not make its way, especially in a small ! church of an obscure village, till after the lapse of many years ; and the florid character of the architectural ornaments must be referred to a late period of the Decorated style, about the middle of the fourteenth century. Now this date coin- IN STEDHAM CHURCH. 3 cides very well with the evidence furnished by the design of St. George ; for it may be observed that his combat with the dragon is not represented according to the conventional form given to it in the Order of the Garter, and adopted by the knights of St. George in Russia, Burgundy, and Rome — one difference is, that in all the other instances, the dragon is entirely below the horse, and the spear is wielded either by the left hand only, or by both, but here the head of the dragon is in advance of the horse, and the lance is in the right hand of the rider ; but further he is less fully armed than he is represented in all the pictures with which I am acquainted, with slight armour on his arms and knees ; he wears a vest of white cloth, bearing a red cross, something like the badge worn by the canons of the Penitence of Martyrs, which, bating the anachronism, would not mis- become St. George, as I propose to show. But it is very remarkable, that a small black cross lies under the red cross, forming a star upon the back, which is more distinctly repre- sented on a banner suspended in the background, and of which the rays to a certain point are inclosed within a circle like the garter. Now the bearings of those knights is thus described by heralds : on the left breast of the riding habit they wear a star of eight points, having in the centre the arms of the Order ; argent, a cross gules, within a garter. This fresco, therefore, must have been painted after the institution of the Order, which is supposed — though the exact date is uncertain — to have taken place about the year 1350. It must be remembered, that the George was not appended to the collar till the reign of Henry VIII. It is stated, in- deed, by Polydore Vergil (1. 19, p. 372), that when Edward III had chosen him to preside over his army, he assigned to him, armed and seated on a horse, a white shield bearing a red cross — but there is not a word about the dragon ; and it is evident that the artist, though loyally admitting the martyr's newly instituted honours, was not accustomed to regard him as a great chevalier, ready to do battle against monsters, and that he was wholly unacquainted with the deeds of the saint, which Jacobus de Voragine had been recording, not long before, in the Golden Legend. St. George was not a warrior in fields of battle, but a 4 MURAL PAINTINGS Christian warrior in the cause of truth. He had long been honoured in this country as an eminent martyr. Dr. Ileylin mentions a canon of a synod at Oxford in 1222, which ordered a peculiar service to be celebrated by all parochial priests on St. George's day, the 23d of April ; and that no servile work shall be done upon it. Mr. Pegge (Archacologia, vol. v), enumerates several priories and churches that had been previously dedicated to this saint, and the churches bearing his name in South wark and at Canterbury are said to have been founded before the Norman invasion ; at Thetford (Tanner's Not. ; Blomfield's Norfolk) a church of St. George was granted by Canute to the abbot of Bury, who added to it a monastery for regular canons, perhaps of the order of the Penitence of Martyrs. If it be asked, what induced Edward to knight the saint, a satisfactory reason may be found in a passage of Bede's Ephemeris, which, after mentioning other saints, to whom the 23d day of April was assigned, concludes with this couplet : \" Hac etiam invicto mundiun qui sanguine temnis Infinita refers Greorgi sancte trophsea.\" \" On this day, too, St. George, whose blood throws scorn Upon this world, what trophies hast thou borne !\" Where it is plain that the victory to which it alludes is the victory of faith displayed in martyrdom; and his ordinary titles in the Menologia, or breviaries, were Trophy-bearer and Champion. This character might easily suggest the mounting him on horseback ; but the first writer who mentions any equestrian figure of him is Nicephorus Gregoras, who was contemporary with Edward III. His glory is thus summed up by Heylin : \" His name is commemorated in the martyrologies of Rome and Greece ; his reliques reverenced in Spain, Constantinople, France, and Germany ; temples are erected to his honour in Rome, Thrace, Romula, Diospolis, Alexandria, Cairo, and Ethiopia, and in other places by prelates, popes, and emperors ; temples in Asia, Europe, and Africa ; in the prin- cipal cities of the east and west and southern parts of the whole world.\" IN S TED HAM CHURCH. 5 It is worthy of notice, too, that so early as the sixth century, the emperor Justinian is said by Procopius to have dedicated a church to him in Armenia. But, although in all these instances he was venerated only as a martyr, and there is no written evidence of his\" having been previously mounted on ahorse, yet it is remarkable that the Priory of Greseley, in Derby- shire, dedicated to St. Mary and St. George, had a seal, about the time of Richard, bearing an equestrian figure of the saint ; and Richard is said to have been inspired by St. George to institute that order of knighthood which Edward III really founded, as his statutes express it, \" to the honour of Almighty God, St. Mary the glorious Virgin, and St. George the Martyr.\" In the year 1344, in imitation of Justinian, he dedicated the chapel of Windsor to our saint. In 1349, at the battle of Calais, he publicly invoked St. George, but not alone, nor yet combined with any military saint, like St. Maurice or St. Sebastian, but with the unwarlike Edward the Confessor. Though thus accepted as a saint, yet the character of St. George has been blamed by high authorities. Gibbon (Decline and Pall, ii, 404) says, that \"each moment of his episcopal reign at Alexandria was polluted by cruelty and avarice;\" Milner (Ch. Hist., ii, 131) says, that \"he distinguished him- self as the persecutor of the people of God \" and Pope Gelasius I, in the synod of Rome, in 494, specifies the mar- tyrdom of St. George among the writings which were not allowed to be read in the Roman church, that no occasion of scandal might arise, because it was said to have been written by heretics. The question, then, naturally occurs, if this be so, how came he to be admitted among the saints ? How came Andreas Cretensis, in the sixth century, to commend so highly his wisdom, his integrity, and his flagrant zeal against impiety ? Or how came our own Chaucer to exhort the knights who had just been instituted to do him service and knightly obeisance, thus, \" Por Christes cause is his, well knowen ye?\" An examination of the real circumstances of his martyrdom will, I think, solve this enigma. We have the evidence of two contemporary writers, whose testimony is the more impartial, because they were not Christians, Ammianus Marcellinus and the Emperor Julian. The former tells us that \" George the bishop had made himself extremely unpopular, 6 MURAL PAINTINGS not only by turning common informer in order to ingratiate himself with the Emperor Constantius, hut also by representing to him, ' that the public buildings, which had been constructed by Alexander at the public expense, ought to pay a tax to the revenue.' Now those public buildings were doubtless the heathen temples ; but the immediate cause of his death was a greater exuberance of zeal ; for when he returned from exile, by the favour of Constantius, in passing through the heathen temple, he lifted up his eyes upon its stately walls, and said, ' how long shall this sepulchre stand ?' which was understood to be a threat of its destruction ; and two of his attendant priests were murdered too, one because he had overthrown an altar recently erected at the mint, and the other because he had cut off the hair of some boys, under the idea that it ministered to superstition. They were all slain with brutal cruelty, and their dead bodies were exposed in the streets on the backs of camels, then burned on the shore, and their ashes were thrown into the sea, lest they should be collected and venerated as the ashes of martyrs, and honoured with shrines. \" (Amm. Marc, 1. 22, c. iv). Before we proceed to the testi- mony of Julian, let us see how Sozomene represents the previous conduct of George. He says, \" that the Gentiles had greater and more motives of hatred towards him than the Athanasians, who were accused of instigating his murder, especially on account of injuries offered to their images and temples, and his prohibitions of their sacrifices and native rites : moreover, there had been a quarrel about a place called Mithrias, a waste place, which Constantius had given to the church. George, on clearing it away, in order to build a house of prayer, discovered a sanctuary containing some images and apparatus used in the mysteries and initiations practised there, which, appearing to the Christians to be ridiculous, were paraded by them through the town in scorn of the heathen, who then assembled and attacked them with swords and stones, and other weapons, and some were crucified, and they were obliged to abandon their undertaking, and the bishop was obliged to fly from the country.\" (Hist. Eccl., 1. v, c. 7.) After his return Constantius died, and Julian succeeded to the imperial throne, whose known hatred of Christianity encouraged its heathen inhabitants to take their IN STEDHAM CHURCH. 7 revenge for the indignities offered to their false religion, and for every effort to subvert it ; the emperor, in truth, was not much displeased, and contented himself with sending this mild rebuke, as the only punishment of the barbarous crime which they had committed : \" You will say it was because he exas- perated Constantius against you, and because he introduced an army into your holy city, and the Egyptian commander, fearing him more than Constantius, took possession of the most sacred temple (of Serapis), plundering from thence the image, and offerings, and furniture ; and when you resented it, and tried to defend the god, or rather the property of the god, he sent his soldiers against you. Unjustly, illegally, and impiously, in your rage against George, the enemy of the gods on these accounts, you have defiled the holy city again with blood, when you might have sent him before the tribunals ; granted that he deserved to suffer such things, and, I might add, worse and severer punishments, yet not from you,\" &c. These contemporary accounts of the saint's death suf- ficiently coincide with the statement of his later panegyrists, that he brought it upon himself by his hostility to heathen superstition. The fiction of the pestiferous dragon, which St. George encountered and dragged into the city by the princess's girdle, is easily explained, the girdle being the girdle of truth, and the monster false religion, in the form of Serapis, which is described by Macrobius as a three-headed animal, bound up in the folds of a dragon. (Bochart Hier., 1. ii, c. 34.) In the church of St. Francis d'Assisi, Cimabue has painted Michael, like St. George, thrusting his lance into the mouth of the dragon ; for the saint is not necessarily mounted on horse- back, though that was the device which suited the Crusaders best. Out of six representations of him mentioned by Husen- beth (Emblems ofS. S., p. 61), only two are equestrian ; and if the archangel were deprived of his proper attributes, the wings, it would be impossible to distinguish the one from the other. From these data we may conclude that the victory of St. George, depicted on the walls of Stedham Church, was a victory over the enemies of Christianity, nor is it difficult to conjecture, with tolerable accuracy, the date of its execution ; for an ancient manuscript informs us, that in the year 1368 8 MURAL PAINTINGS certain persons in the West Street of Chichester (Westrata, Cicestrie), who proposed to form a fraternity or guild, being impelled by the highest devotion towards that saint, the pro- tector and patron of England, placed an image of him for his honour in the church of Chichester. (Selden's Titles of Honour, p. 672.) It is probable, therefore, that about the same time, or certainly not long after, it would become the fashion to imitate, in the neighbouring parish churches, the example thus set in the cathedral city. The drawing which has the next claim upon our attention is the representation of St. Ursula, on the north wall, for she, too, is a British saint, though Mrs. Jameson has most un- patriotically disowned her, in her work on Sacred and Legen- dary Art, by following the German version of her story, on the authority of Antonius and Jacobus Philippus ; and this, too, although she had before her, and refers to, Junius, who tells a very different story, which he professes to have extracted from very ancient manuscripts, and which is less extravagant than the legend which she has adopted. At the end of the sixth century, Cyriacus, patriarch of Constantinople, is said to have rebaptised, at Home, Conan, to whom Ursula was betrothed, although he had been already baptised before he began his journey, at the request of Ursula. Conan is said to have given orders to all his vassals in his kingdom of France, and in Scotland, and in the province of Cornwall, to send 11,000 virgins to his court. Now this is a combination which could not have occurred before the four- teenth century, thereby marking the date of the legend. Discarding, therefore, this legend, let us turn to the account of Surius. \" When all the ends of the earth,\" says he, \" were converted to Christianity, and not any corner of the ocean hid itself from the warmth of faith, Deonatus a most religious king reigned in part of Britain ; his daughter Ursula was a paragon of beauty, learning, and piety ; and her fame had spread to such distant lands, that a barbarian king of great wealth and power sent ambassadors to demand her hand in marriage for his son, with abundance of promises and threats, but she had vowed to dedicate herself to Christ, and to receive no other spouse j her father, therefore, was much IN S TED HAM CHURCH. 9 distressed ; but was finally relieved from his perplexity by a vision which she related to him. It was revealed to her, that she was to give an apparent consent upon very singular terms ; ten noble virgins were to be selected for her com- panions, and each of them, as well as herself, was to be provided with a thousand virgin attendants, and eleven ships were to be built for them, in which they were to practise the art of navigation for three years before she repaired to her suitor's court, as if to fulfil her contract.\" This is a proposal, which could only have been imagined for an insular, and consequently a seafaring people ; and accordingly, having employed that interval of preparation in training up her female crews, not only to a perfect knowledge of nautical manoeuvres, but also to the more important knowledge of faith in Christ; and having persuaded them to take upon themselves the same vows of perpetual chastity, she sailed with a favourable wind to a harbour on the coast of Gaul, called Tile, probably Teil on the Waal ; and having passed the night there, and laid in a stock of provisions, they took to their oars and proceeded up the river to Cologne. In order to give some sort of consistency to the legend, two things must and may reasonably be taken for granted ; first, that when each of these ladies is said to have had a thousand attendants, we are only to understand that they were nu- merous, a definite number being taken indefinitely, of which we have many examples in Scripture ; and secondly, that the barbarian prince was a chieftain of one of the powerful tribes, which were then overrunning Germany, for the ambassadors had made a long journey to reach Britain (emenso grandi itinere), which would not be true if they only crossed the channel. Ursula landed at Cologne, and in the night a man of angelic glory appeared to her, and promised her a safe conduct to Rome to perform her vows there, and a safe conduct back to Cologne, and then a crown of martyrdom for her and all her train ; this being communicated to the rest, they sailed to Basle, and from thence went overland to Borne, where they visited the sacred shrines, and prayed, and then returned by the same route, prepared to meet their fate, though they knew not how, for, remembering the friendly reception which they 10 Ml KM, l»AINTIN(iS. had met vvitli at Cologne, they landed there on their arrival without any hesitation ; but it so happened that the town at I that time was beseiged by the Huns, who immediately fell upon them and slew them. Ursula herself, refusing to beeome the wife of the general, was shot by an arrow, which in many of her pictures she holds in her hand. Whatever historical truth there may be in this legend, there is none in its chronology ; for it goes on to say, that this ruthless slaughter was punished by a sudden panic, which scattered the Huns, and drove them away from the beleaguered city ; and the inhabitants rejoicing in their unexpected deliverance poured forth their thanksgivings, not so much to God as to the martyrs. When, however, the Huns under Attila attacked Cologne in 451, they took it, and destroyed it ; they have been confounded, therefore, with some other tribe, and the date must be earlier. We know that the city was threatened by the Pranks under Marcomir in 388, and possibly may have had several similar alarms from those roving hordes during thirty years afterwards ; and that would give a date to the transactions sufficiently in ac- cordance with history. In one point, however, the legend has I an advantage over history, supposing it to be thus interpreted, and explains reasonably enough, why Ursula is said to have had a prosperous voyage in ascending the Rhine in search of her affianced lord, with whom she, nevertheless, knew that she 1 never was *to be united. Our British historians carry her there against her will, by error or by accident ; the names, | however, of her father and her suitor are the same names which are given by the Cologne legend, and are ascertained beyond a doubt to be British. There is one great advantage in accepting the account of | the British historians — they furnish a very fair explanation of a mystery which has much perplexed both writers and artists i — the prodigious troop of virgins in the train of Ursula. They j cannot be reduced to one under the name of Undecimilla — I signifying eleven thousand ; for the legend mentions the names of several, but Undecimilla is not among them. Nor can they be reduced to eleven by taking the Latin numeral M ! for martyrs instead of thousands ; for the number is men- j tioned as a fact, before any of them were martyred. But j IN STEDHAM CHURCH. 11 !take the account of Polydore Vergil, and the difficulty vanishes J at once. He says that \" Conan, a British chieftain, having !; obtained the supreme power in Armorica by means of his |j British army, expelled the Gauls, and introduced everywhere [British inhabitants ; and that he might preserve the British blood pure, he would not allow his soldiers to marry the natives, but sent for wives for them out of Britain ; so that a ( large number of virgins emigrated there, and at one time 11,000 of either sex perished, partly by shipwreck, and partly by violence, being killed by barbarians when they landed ; and among them one was said to be St. Ursula, the daughter of Dionotus, prince (Regulus) of Cornwall, she having been betrothed to Conan.\" (Hist. 1. 3, p. 50). In this narrative all mention of Cologne is omitted ; but the tradition related by Usher, which greatly augments the number, at the same time fills up the blank. He says that the whole emigration consisted of 30,000 soldiers and 100,000 others, and that, of their destined brides, St. Ursula and 11,000 noble and 60,000 plebeian virgins, some mistaking their way landed at Cologne, and were murdered by the Huns. (Ant. Brit. 107). Fabian recites the same particulars (Chron. p. 51) with little variation. Another historian of the 14th century, Harding, after going- over the same ground, acids these rude rhymes : \" This Dionote custos was of Britain ; His daughter was with those virgins then forth sent, In Thamis shipped and cast in Almayn, By tempest great, their shippes all to rent, Many of them were dead, and many spent In sickness, frayed in storms and sore tempest, That full fain they there would have had their rest. Grwames was then king of Houndeland, And Malga king of Paynims hatous, In whose landes they arrived, I understand. Unto them then they were full odious, Passing ireful and full malicious ; And for that they would not be devirginate, They slew them all through cruelty and hate.\" Harding's Chron. 104 ; see also RasteWs Chroti. 450. That the Christian princes thus constantly associated with the story of St. Ursula had a real, and not merely an imaginary existence, as Milton rashly surmised, we may infer from col- 12 MURAL PAINTINGS lateral evidence. Buchanan, in his ' History of Scotland/ relates how a British prince, Dioncthus (which is a version of the same name, evidently not copied from English sources) fought, in conjunction with two Scotch chiefs, against the Romans, under Maximian, and was wounded in the battle in which they were slain, but escaped and returned into his own country j and he mentions Conan as having complained in a British council that all their youth were sent abroad. (Histor. Rex Scot. 1. 5. c. 5 & 11). It appears, therefore, that both of them were hostile to the Roman government ; and in what way Conan became possessed of the supreme authority in that part of France which was then called, not Brittany but Armorica, we learn from a very accurate and trustworthy French author, whose statement coincides very much with that of our own historians. In 6 I/Art de verifier les Dates,' we find, that in 384, Maximus being in Britain, transported into Armorica the third part of the British youth, not to punish them, but to reward them for their military exploits under his command. These, added to the other British fugitives who had expatri- ated themselves during the preceding century, in consequence of the invasion of the Saxons, made themselves masters of the country ; and it was probably at that time, or a little after, that Armorica took the name of Bretagne. The Britons founded there a state almost monarchical on the ruins of the republican government which they found there. Conan, surnamed Meriadec, prince of Albania, as part of Scotland was then called, was chosen to be their prince in 409, when they found themselves abandoned to the barbarians by the Romans. He was a very zealous Christian, and founded the bishoprics of Dol, Vannes, and Quimper, in concert with Grallin, the earl of Cornwall. (V. ii. 890). These testimonies are sufficient to show why the story of Ursula was popular in England. She was an eminent Chris- tian lady ; but in order to represent it on the walls of a church, it was necessary to adopt the legend which was then in vogue, and perhaps read in churches. But though she was considered a saint, she is not at Stedham represented as a martyr. She does not, as in later pictures, wear the crown of martyrdom, nor does she bear in her hand the arrow which IN STEDHAM CHURCH. 13 was the instrument of her death. The point of time selected by the artist is that, when she saw the vision which directed her to proceed to Rome and there receive the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, previous to the death which awaited her on her return. These directions are intimated by emblems connected with the figure of our Lord, on whose body the five stigmata are sufficiently conspicuous. The two-wheeled car on which he stands signifies a long journey overland, being connected with the feet of Ursula ; and amidst the triple glory which encompasses his head, the sacramental symbols, the chalice and the patine, are intro- duced, and two or three of the longer rays seem intended for javelins or arrows. Perhaps, too, eternal life is in the balance, and is supposed to determine her choice in weighing the cost of the undertaking. Her long golden tresses are characteristic of her, and the ermined robe marks her rank. The small figures sheltered beneath her mantle have been mistaken for children by those who either reject or were ignorant of the legend, and therefore she is absurdly reckoned the patroness of children ; but it is merely the device of the artist, usual in England as elsewhere, to represent the attend- ant virgins under her protection. The third design which occupies the middle compartment of the north wall, is one that is very common in church frescoes, and probably owes its popularity in this country to the same cause as the story of St. George, that is to say, it was imported by the Crusaders from the East ; for St. Chris- topher is a Saint of the Greek as well as of the Latin Church, as indeed his name imports, and there he was called the great martyr, meaning thereby one of those whom Radowitz calls \" Nothhelfer,\" or the great auxiliators of mankind ; but this being misunderstood by the western legend- writers, they turned him into a giant : one makes him twelve feet in height, another twelve cubits, and another declares that a perfect foot of the Saint was exported into Bosnia from Byzantium, when it was taken by the Turks, of such magni- tude that it reaches from the heel of an ordinary man up to his armpit, which would give him a height of about twenty- seven feet. It is not difficult to discern a reason for the 14 MURAL PAINTINGS ready acceptance of this monstrous legend by the early artists of Europe, which was then inhabited by a manly mili- tary race of men, not much civilised, and valuing nothing so much as bodily strength. In their churches therefore they preferred seeing the infant Jesus mounted on the shoulders of a giant rather than in the arms of his mother. A Latin couplet, appended to the pictures, assured the spectator that whoever looked on the form of St. Christopher was safe on that day from any violent death. \" Christophori sancti speciem quicunque tuetur Ilia nempe die non morte mala morietur.\" And another couplet, highly extolling his virtues, adds, \" Qui te mane videt, nocturne- tempore ridet.\" Delightful shall the evening be To him who early looks at thee. In order to enjoy the benefits of this talisman, it was a common practice to exhibit the wonder-working saint on the outside of sacred edifices as well as in the interior. He is said to have converted to Christianity, according to some writers, 18,000, according to others 48,000 heathens in Lycia, where he suffered martyrdom ; and more particularly two different bands of soldiers, each consisting of 200, who were sent by the Praetor Dagnus to bring him away by force, but who returned quoting Scripture, and prepared to die with him, and also two women, Niceta and Aquilina, who were sent, like the women of Moab, to seduce him from his alle- giance to Christ, but were reclaimed by his pious instructions, and courageously encountered cruel deaths in defence of their faith. As there are probably many persons who are quite unacquainted with the legend, it is necessary to recite so much of it as belongs to the explanation of the picture. A heathen, whose name by a clumsy fiction is represented to have been Offero, but more appropriately, by a various reading, Reprobus, received, on his conversion, the name of Christophorus, which seems to have suggested the story founded upon its meaning Christ-bearer. Being very desirous to serve Christ, but not knowing how, he consulted a hermit, who recommended him to make the best use of his strength and stature for the benefit of his fellow-creatures, by helping them to pass IN STEDHAM CHURCH. 15 through a rapid and dangerous river, which had no bridge across it. This he readily undertook to do, and stationing himself on the bank, and steadying his steps with a palm-tree, which he had plucked up by the roots, he was never weary of carrying all who wanted his assistance through the tumultuous waters. At last it happened that, in a dark night, he heard ; the weak voice of a child asking a passage to the other side, '< and though the darkness was so great that he could not see I the petitioner without the aid of a lantern, which the hermit, or, as he is sometimes called, Cucuphatas the martyr, is made by some to hold, he immediately complied, but as he strug- gled on through the rising waters, the burthen which he bore seemed to grow more and more insupportable, and when he reached with difficulty the opposite shore, he thus remon- strated : — \" Thou hast placed my life in extreme peril : for if I had carried the whole world on my shoulders, I should scarcely have felt it more.\" \" Wonder not at that,\" was the reply, \" for thou hast carried not the whole world only, but Him who created it and, in confirmation of his words, he ordered him to stick his palm-staff into the earth, which im- mediately brought forth leaves, and flowers, and fruit. The moral of this legend, which Baronius admits must have an allegorical interpretation, is well expressed in some Latin verses, written upon an image of the Saint exhibited at Augsburg, by Stigelius, who was a Lutheran. They were published by Chytnseus, in the form of a dialogue between the spectator and St. Christopher. The former begins by asking \"Who are you? — a. I am the image of one sin- cerely professing to be a Christian, the sweet name which He whom I carry has given me. q. Who is the child ? — a. It is Christ. q. What need of such gigantic strength to bear so light a burthen ? — a. Outwardly he seems to be a child, than whom, nevertheless, nothing in the wrorld is greater; hence great powers both of mind and body are needful for those who would carry Christ to the knowledge of mankind. Q. But why, walking through the depths of the swelling sea, do you drive back the troublous waters with your treelike staff? — a. By the sea which I tread under my feet, under- stand the wicked world, which surrounds pious minds with fearful perils ; by the staff understand nothing else than the L6 MURAL PAINTINGS word of God, which supports the heart in tribulation, and armed with which, wo who preach the great work of Christ's righteousness boldly encounter difficulties and dan- gers, q. But who is the old man at a distance, that with a lighted torch points out the way ? (he was sometimes represented holding a torch, instead of a lantern.) — a. The guiding light signifies the oracles that announced the coming Messiah, and the holy man represents the ancient prophets.\" The verses conclude with a welcome to the Saint, and this pleasing address to him whose name he bears, Optime Christe Mecum habita ; tecum vivere sola salus 0 Blessed Jesus ! dwell with me ; \"lis not life to live without thee. This interpretation of the device is adopted by Roman Catholic writers ; but there are two or three circumstances in the present picture which remain to be noticed. The holy child holds the globe in his hand, the lantern is not held by the hermit, who is shown in a separate compartment, but stands on the shore with all its ribs but one obliterated ; the staff is just bursting into leaf; a ship is to be seen in the water, because the saint was the patron of shipping, of those who encountered the perils of the sea ; and partly also, perhaps, in order to inform the spectators that they were looking at water ; much in the same way as in the clown's play of ' Pyramus and Thisbe,' in c A Midsummer Night's Dream,' a bush and a lantern are introduced by them \" to present moonshine,\" and a man with mortar sticking to him \" to present a wall.\" Possibly too the dog, which appears upon the shore, may answer the same purpose in designating land, or else it may refer to a variety in the legend, which describes Christopher, before his conversion, as one of the Cynocephali, or dog- headed men, supposed by Pliny to exist in Ethiopia ; for it raised the wonder higher, that a dog should he heard, not only to speak, but to preach the Christian faith. Strange as much of this may be, yet Mrs. Jameson is scarcely justified in treating the whole as a parable ; for Bellarmine very justly argues that there must have been some foundation of historical truth for a story so generally received, concerning a person IN STEDHAM CHURCH. 17 admitted into both the Greek and Roman martyrologies. A Spanish hymn, cited by Baronius, celebrates the elegance of his stature, as well as the fervour of his devotion, which cer- tainly cannot refer to the legend ; for though it implies some- thing remarkable in his stature, it excludes the idea of its being monstrous. There is nothing incredible in the sugges- tion of those who wrote the ' Acta Sanctorum,' that he was taller and stronger than the generality of men ; and, however unskilfully the materials may have been huddled together, there is nothing incredible in the supposition that he was a barbarian captain taken by the Greeks ; that he was taught Greek at Samos ; that he was converted, not by an angel, but by the Holy Spirit ; that he was baptized by Babylas, the patriarch of Antioch ; that he was a very faithful servant of Christ, and bore him, not on his shoulders, but in his heart ; that he converted many of those whom he commanded before ; that he endured many severe torments, rather than renounce his faith ; and that, finally, he suffered martyrdom in the Dacian persecution. Though we may not believe that Dagnus, his Lycian persecutor, having been deprived of the sight of one eye by an arrow intended for the saint, had it restored after his death by the application of his blood, which produced his conversion, yet there is nothing incredible in the statement, that he was converted by witnessing the forti- tude of the martyr, and his constancy, even unto death : for it is well known that the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the Church. And now a very few words will suffice to explain what I conceive to be the meaning of the various objects contained in the fourth picture, which is a representation of the Last Judg- ment. The outlines are very faintly delineated, and nearly one-third of the picture is cut off by the insertion of the modern window ; but when it was entire, the central figure, high above all, was the Judge of the whole earth, clad in royal apparel, but very coarse, both in the conception and execu- tion, and his glory is represented by two burning candles ; at his feet appears the \" city which hath good foundations, whose builder is God,\" very inaccurate, if it is intended for the New Jerusalem ; for it is not four square, and only one iv. 2 18 PAINTlNdS IN STEDHAM CHURCH. gate is shown, but containing a multitude of the blessed, and two saints, probably representatives of the Apostles, occupy exalted thrones, and the archangel is blowing his trumpet j and, below, the dead arc rising from their tombs. On the right of the throne another angel has been gathering the elect from the four corners of the earth, who are looking with calm adoration to their Judge ; and on the left, no doubt, we should have seen the lost assembled, for one of them is still visible, in the act of falling into the flames of hell, which, with various expectant fiends and tortured souls, occupy all the bottom of the picture. It was a continual sermon for those who could more easily be taught by the eye than by the ear. THE ANTIQUITIES OE STEDHAM CHURCH. BY MR. J. E. BUTLEE. Before noticing the paintings which have lately been dis- covered in Stedham Church, it will perhaps be well, by way of preface, to give a brief description of its architecture, and of the very ancient carved fragments which have been brought to light by the pulling down of the old nave. Erom the bulging of the nave walls, owing to the very awkward situation of the tower (between nave and chancel), and more than all, from the want of sufficient accommodation in the church, it has been found necessary to pull down the old building, with the exception of the tower, and reconstruct it on a new foundation and on a larger scale. The old church consisted of a nave, central tower (but no transepts), and chancel. The nave, from the simple and even rude character of its windows and masonry, must be of early date, and in all pro- bability is the church mentioned in Domesday Book : \" Here is a church; 10 ministers/' The tower has been rebuilt (circa 1670), but all the lower portion of it is original. The chancel is of the simple lancet style, c. 1200, and has had a brass on the floor ; but there are no signs of mural painting. The lower portions of the nave walls have been built in a manner very unusual, which may be termed, kist or chest fashion — i.e., for the first four or five feet with slabs or blocks set edgeways (vide annexed sketches, fig. 1, 6, 7, 8, 9); and it is to this method of building, and the want of sufficient depth of foundation, that the bulging of the nave walls may be attributed. The surfaces of some of these stones are orna- mented with crosses of various patterns, standing in relief about one inch and a half above the face. Others, again, are 20 ANTIQUITIES OF quite plain, and would appear to have been fresh from the pit at the time of their insertion, having been only \" faced\" with the stone hammer or axe, and cut into coffin-lids, ready to receive the monumental cross upon it, when, upon the decease of any person, the stone coffin and its lid should be required. A further proof of this is given by the fact, that the dimensions of those stones, which have already served to memorialise the dead, tally very generally with those that have not — their average size being over six feet long, twenty- two inches wide at the head, eighteen inches at the foot, and eight or nine inches thick. Four stone coffins have also been taken out of the wall (fig. 3, 4) — three are of grown persons, but one, only two feet nine inches long, was found in the tower wall. There was no trace of human remains in either, but one, at least, had the drain bored for the escape of moisture. It is curious, also, that many specimens of cable-moulding (fig. 10), the ordinary criterion of Norman work, have been found in these walls. Quite distinct from these stones, which originally lay flat on the ground, were found others, which we should term head and foot stones : unlike the tall modern ones, which are sometimes too scanty for a list of all the virtues of the departed, these head-stones stood about two feet and a half high, two feet wide, and nine or ten inches thick, semi- circular-headed, with a simple cross rudely cut in relief, but without inscription of any kind. The foot-stone was similar, but smaller, and also had the simple cross upon it. Both are formed of the fine sandstone of the country — as indeed was all the church — which may be dug to any amount at the distance of about a mile. Not a figure has been seen on any stone to mark its date, but several retain the brown dust of the moss of ages upon them, which moss must have been acquired by lying in the old churchyard, prior to the erection of the church ; and as that appears to have been before Domesday, some may be even British. Neither has any foundation stone been dis- covered, but as the lower part of the south walls has not been removed, it may possibly still be there concealed. The west gable of the nave seems to have been rebuilt STEDHAM church. 21 (probably when the porch, a work dated 1670, was erected) partly with broken gravestones out of the churchyard, speci- mens of which I subjoin (fig. 1, 2). With regard to the paintings, they had been covered up and written upon with the usual texts from Scripture, perhaps at the time of the rebellion, and these again superseded by others, about a century ago ; but in some places those now described, which may date from 1450 to 1500, appear to have supplanted others of yet older date. Of those on the north wall, one may represent St. Ursula ; but as her symbol, the arrow, is not visible, and the figures on each side of her appear to be males, rather than females, perhaps it may symbolise the church as the bride of Christ, who is placed near, sur- rounded by the instruments of the crucifixion, the emblems of the eucharist, and the scales. Another is St. Christopher, carrying the infant Saviour across the river, supporting his steps on an uprooted palm, being lighted by the hermit, standing in a niche and holding a lantern. The fourth is the Last Judgment, broken in upon by a comparatively modern window. The subjects on the south wall are — St. George slaying the Dragon ; beneath which are three figures, which may be representations of the \" three Marys,\" which subject appears to have been executed in a manner superior to the rest, and more like actual fresco. The remainder, from the difficulty of separating whitewash from damp plaster, was too imperfect to make out. On the east, being the tower wall, were the Ten Command- ments, printed on the plaster, in black, with red capitals, in old English character, probably done at the time the tower was rebuilt ; but of course there is no design beneath them. The paintings have been so amply treated by another hand, as to make further comment here unnecessary. EXTRACTS FROM ACCOUNT-BOOKS OF THE EVERENDEN AND ERE WEN FAMILIES, IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. BY WILLIAM DUKRANT COOPER, F.S.A. Among the MSS. belonging to Thomas Frewen, Esq., of Brickwall, Northiam, are two Account Books of his family, in the seventeenth century, which contain many entries of interest to Sussex men. They come down to the same period as the Diary of the Rev. Giles Moore {Sussex Archceological Collections, vol. I) ; but they commence at a period much earlier. With Mr. Frewen's permission I have made extracts for our Society. The first book came into his family by the marriage of Mary Everenden with the Rev. Thomas Frewen, rector of Northiam, temp. Charles II. There are a few items in the years 1586, 1592, and 1609; but they are unimportant till we reach the accounts of John Everenden, of Sedlescombe, gen- tleman, who married Mary, sister of William White, of Brick- wall, and who was on such friendly terms with his neighbours, the Saekvilles, that we find in April, 1626, an entry — \" Spent at London, at Snt. George's Feast, when I waited on the Earle of Dorset, £15. 10*. 8d.\" The accounts of Mr. John Everenden commence in March 1618-9, and end 14th July, 1660; the years from 1632 to 1643 are imperfect. The remainder of the book contains the accounts of his son Walter, who was a justice of the peace. His accounts commence Oct., 1661, and continue till July, 1678. We have thus a perfect account of the expenses of Sussex gentry farming their own land for nearly sixty years. The following account of stock and crops in 1618 is of considerable worth, as showing the value of stock and the modes of farming and cropping in those days, and how large a proportion of stock was kept. Mr. J. Everenden owned and occupied 14 pieces of land in Sedlescombe, containing together 84 acres, of which 5J EXTRACTS FROM ACCOUNT-BOOKS. 23 were woodland ; and for the sake of pasturage he rented 30 acres of marsh land in Padiham and Dimsdale marshes next Winchelsea.

Itt. of old ewes, 12, worth £8. Itt. ram, 1, worth 13s. 4<d. On 5th Oct., 1648, his \" tale of sheep \" was, store wethers, 107 ; store ewes, 123 ; fatting wethers, 96 ; fatting ewes, 33 ; rams and riggs, 16; young ewes at Dimchurch, 77 ; lambs brought home, 216, viz., wethers, rams, and riggs, 111 ; and ewe lambs, 105. His fleece wool this year was sold to a stapler at Cranbrook for Is. a pound, and produced £87 ; and his lamb's wool to his brother-in-law, Caleb Courthop, of Cranbrook, at 3s. 4ad. per quarter, and produced £9. 3s. 4d. His other stock, in March 1618, is thus entered : — Itt. 4 oxen, worth £22. Itt. 6 kine, worth £24. Itt. 3 yearlings, worth £8. Itt. 1 bull, worth £4. Itt. 2 geldings, worth £16. Itt. 1 young mare, worth £10. Itt. 6 hogs, worth £2. 8s. Itt. 1 old black mare, worth £4. 6 acres of wheat, worth £24. Itt. 7i acres appointed for oats, worth £10, making a total of £345. 8s. Itt. more for my part of the lease in the marsh, worth £66. This year he had 24^ acres of grass mown ; in the next year he had 21 J acres of grass mown, 8 acres of wheat and 10 acres of oats ; and the whole value of his stock, &c. was £411. 10s. Sd.

In 1622 there are receipts for wood of 14 years' growth, used for hop-poles. The second book is the ledger of Benjamin Frewen, son of the Rev. John Frewen, rector of Northiam, by his second wife ; he was a haberdasher : and of his brother Stephen, who was a skinner ; both in London. The eldest son by the first wife was Accepted Frewen, archbishop of York 1660 to 1664. The book commences 5th January, 1631. On the cover is written — •\" In my beginning God bee my good ly[fe] in grase @ venture to prosper. — Ben.
