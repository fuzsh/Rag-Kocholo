        "text": "Longtime Michigan State University trustee Dianne Byrum owns two Michigan homes with her husband and both had a tax exemption for years that allowed the couple to save thousands of dollars on property taxes that should have been paid on one of the homes — a situation Byrum called \"an error.\"\n\nThe exemption on both properties, known as a principal residence exemption, allowed the Byrums to save at least $11,900 in school taxes over seven years on their longtime home south of Lansing in rural Ingham County, a Detroit News analysis of tax records shows.\n\nThis year, the Byrums saved $11,620 by claiming the principal residency exemption on their other home overlooking Lake Michigan near Grand Haven, which Byrum says is her primary residence. That home has doubled in taxable value since the couple bought it in 2012. State law only allows a resident to declare one home their primary residence, thus exempting them from the 18-mill school operating tax levied on second homes and rental properties, as well as commercial and industrial property.\n\nThe Byrums didn't have a principal residence exemption on their Lake Michigan home between 2013-16. Changing their principal residence to the west side of the state and making the Lake Michigan home their primary residence between 2017-23 allowed Byrum and her husband to save more than $75,000 in taxes because it exempted the property from the 18-mill non-homestead property tax for vacation homes, a Detroit News analysis shows.\n\nIt wasn't until The Detroit News inquired to Byrum last month about why she had principal residency exemptions on both properties that she began addressing a situation she characterized as an error and had one of the exemptions eliminated.\n\n\"I know when I registered to vote in Ferrysburg and changed my residence, I filled out a form to indicate I was moving my principal residence,\" said Byrum, who has served on the MSU board since 2008. \"If they don't have it correct, then I need to correct it. But I think they do. I believe I have one principal address. It's in Ferrysburg. And Onondaga is listed as a second residence.”\n\nByrum said the situation occurred as a result of paperwork she filed in 2018 to drop the principal exemption on her Ingham County home was not recorded for an unknown reason after she moved her principal residence to her Lake Michigan home. She said she has since corrected the tax status of the Ingham County home by refiling the proper paperwork, and she would \"promptly\" pay back the taxes she owes after they are calculated.\n\n\"There was an error, and I believed on my end that everything was appropriately filed,\" Byrum told The News.\n\nByrum, a public relations executive who is a partner at Byrum & Fisk Communications in East Lansing, is the immediate past chair of the MSU Board of Trustees. She was first elected to the MSU board in 2008 and reelected in 2016. Her second term will end on Jan. 1, 2025. Byrum has not said yet whether she will seek reelection to the board next year.\n\nA longtime Ingham County Democratic politician, Byrum served in the Legislature for more than a decade, spending a decade on the county commission and running unsuccessfully for Congress in 2000. She was the first woman to lead a caucus in the state as the Michigan House as minority leader. Her family owns a chain of independent Ace hardware stores in Livingston, Ingham and Eaton counties.\n\nWhen first contacted in May, Byrum said she filed paperwork a few years ago to drop the principal residence exemption from her home in Onondaga that, public records show, had a taxable value in 2023 at $104,940. She now lives and votes in Ferrysburg near Grand Haven, where she says she commutes 90 minutes to Lansing to live in the four-bedroom, 3.5-bath Lake Michigan home that public records show had a taxable value in 2023 of $645,541 — which is more than six times the value of her home in Onondaga.\n\nThe Byrums' home, nestled into a dune on Lake Michigan, has doubled in value since the couple purchased the property more than a decade ago. In 2012, the home’s taxable value was $305,153 when the Byrums purchased it for $900,000 in 2012, public records show.\n\nByrum said she filed the paperwork to change her principal residence from Ingham County to her Lake Michigan home in 2018.\n\nAn official with the Michigan Secretary of State's Office confirmed that since February 2019, Byrum's driver's license shows that her address is listed in Spring Lake, the mailing address for the city of Ferrysburg.\n\nBut Byrum's home on Lake Michigan has had a principal residence exemption since 2017, public records show.\n\nThe Onondaga Township clerk and treasurer did not respond to several phone messages or emails regarding the tax exemption on the Byrum home near Lansing.\n\nBut one of the township's contract assessors, Ruth Scott of Spring Arbor-based Sunrise Assessing Services, confirmed Tuesday that Byrum has filed the paperwork to rescind the principal residence exemption and that has been sent to the county to process and send the Byrums a bill for back taxes. She said that the exemption has been rescinded for the current year and the previous three years, which is as far back as they can go, per state law.\n\nScott could not confirm whether Byrum had filed the principal residence exemption in 2018 since her firm has only worked with Onondaga Township for a year.\n\n\"It's possible,\" Scott said. \"My partner has looked into the files, and there is nothing on file. That does not mean she did not file it. Sometimes, mistakes are made. It's possible it was filed and the paperwork was lost. I can't say one way or another.\"\n\nOnondaga Township Supervisor Phil Hutchison responded to an email.\n\n\"Our assessor has it handled, probably a clerical error from (a) previous administration,\" Hutchison wrote.\n\nByrum said her husband, Jim Byrum, retired three years ago as president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association in Lansing.\n\n\"We bounce back and forth between both residences, and it just depends on what's going on and the time of year,\" Byrum said. \"But the point is I have one residence. One principal residence. I don't have two. Or at least that's my belief. If it's not correct, it needs to get corrected. But I believe that is accurate.\"\n\nA principal residence exemption gives a person who lives in a home that they own a property tax break — specifically, they are exempted from a property tax levied by the local school district for operations, up to 18 mills, according to the Michigan Department of Treasury. Only one residence may be declared a principal residence; homeowners who claim more than one property as a principal residence can face fines, back taxes, interest, community service and imprisonment, according to state law.\n\nSeeking a principal residence exemption reduces a homeowner's property taxes, but the law states that homeowners can only do that on one of their properties, said H. Nathan Resnick of Resnick Law, a Bloomfield Hills-based real estate attorney for 35 years.\n\n\"There are cases where people try to file multiple PRE (principal residence exemptions), and they are doing that to reduce their real estate taxes,\" Resnick said.\n\nGenerally, people own homes in different cities or townships. It would be flagged immediately if both properties were in the same city, Resnick said.\n\n\"They could potentially get away with it (having an exemption on more than one home) for a while and pay less taxes,\" Resnick said. \"It can potentially save you thousands of dollars, particularly if the property is expensive, meaning your real estate taxes are higher based on the assessed value of the property. You could be saving thousands of dollars every year in real estate taxes by filing more than one (principal residence exemption).\"\n\nBoth Byrum properties had principal residence exemptions in May, public records showed.\n\nHowever, the home in Ferrysburg did not have a principal residence exemption for the first four years after the Byrums purchased it. The home has had a principal residence exemption from 2017-23, records show.\n\nOne day after Byrum was contacted about the exemptions on both her homes, she said she learned from a clerk in Onondaga Township that the paperwork was not filed, so she refiled it so her homes are now compliant with state law.\n\n\"I believed that everything had been submitted, and I was unaware of this error, and I am trying to rectify it as quickly as I can,\" Byrum said.\n\nByrum said she could not get an answer from the officials in Onondaga Township as to why the form she filled out in 2018 to drop the principal exemption to her home was not received.\n\n\"They don't have an answer,\" Byrum said. \"There's been turnover in staff. There's an error someplace, but I don't know where it occurred, nor do they.\"\n\nkkozlowski@detroitnews.com"
