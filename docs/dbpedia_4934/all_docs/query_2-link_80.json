        "text": "Michigan State University Interim President John Engler will not be involved in the university's search for a new president.\n\nTrustees Dianne Byrum and Melanie Foster told News 10 they want to make this process as inclusive as possible. According to the two, they're planning four months worth of listening sessions to get input on what kind of president the MSUcommunity wants.\n\nBut students aren't buying it.\n\n\"I think we need someone who doesn't care about the public eye...someone who cares about students, staff, and faculty and survivors and people that are actually being affected,\" MSU student Mackenzie Mrla said.\n\nTensions ran high at the meeting on Wednesday where trustees Dianne Byrum and Melanie Foster laid out the timeline for the university to select its next president. Trustees plan to get input from the community at listening sessions before identifying candidates. They say the process is about moving forward.\n\n\"We need to learn from the past. we need to listen, and we need to respond,\" trustee Melanie Foster said.\n\nBut that didn't seem like enough from students in attendance.\n\n\"They say they want to work with student, staff, and faculty, but really clearly only want to talk to the media and save face,\" Mackenzie Mrla said.\n\nKatie Paulot agreed.\n\n\"I think if anything today was a reminder that the can say they want to be transparent, they can say they want to be inclusive. But actions speak louder than words,\" Paulot said.\n\nTrustees on the other hand think that the listening sessions will help include everyone.\n\n\"I believe the listening sessions will start to heal this community. It's another positive step forward, there are lots of positive steps,\" Dianne Byrum said.\n\nStudents told News 10 that they think the university is missing its most important step, and that's getting rid of interim president Engler.\n\n\"I'm very concerned for the future, especially with Engler here. I know that not much is going to change. So more pressure needs to be put on Engler to leave,\" Mrla said.\n\nByrum said the search committee will be made up of students, faculty, and alumni. Initial interviews will start in November with the final round of interviews with the board of trustees starting in February.\n\nMSU created a Website where you can track the progress of the search for a new president, to access it, click on the link to the side.\n\nTrustees say a new president should be chosen by June 2019."
