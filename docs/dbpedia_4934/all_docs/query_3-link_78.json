        "text": "Lansing, MI -- For more than a year, Michigan State University President Lou Anna K. Simon and her administration had successfully tamped down indignation over MSU's role in the Larry Nassar sex-abuse scandal.\n\nThat changed over the past nine days, a consequence of Nassar's sentencing hearing -- an epic event in which 156 women detailed the former doctor's sexual assaults under the guise of medical treatment.\n\nThese weren't Jane Does in a lawsuit. They had names. Faces. They had heartbreaking and intensely personal stories of sexual violation that they shared in open court, day after day after day, with the national media in attendance.\n\nWith the cameras rolling, they also repeatedly expressed their rage towards MSU, where Nassar worked for 20 years as a sports-medicine doctor. The women accused the university of ignoring a series of complaints about Nassar and not taking responsibility for its role in the scandal.\n\nThe hearing ended Wednesday with Nassar getting a sentence of 40 to 175 years in prison.\n\nHours later, as criticism of MSU continued to snowball, Simon announced her resignation.\n\n\"As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable,\" Simon said in a statement. \"As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger.\"\n\nHere is a closer look at the nine days that brought down Simon's presidency.\n\nTuesday, Jan. 16: The first day of the hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court includes statements from 29 victims, most of whom were treated by Nassar at MSU's Sports Medicine Clinic when they were adolescents or college-age.\n\nThe women tell a consistent story: During osteopathic treatment for an injury, Nassar penetrated their vagina and/or anus with his ungloved fingers, and he typically did it without consent or much explanation.\n\nOutside the courtroom, ESPN's \"Outside the Lines\" focuses on the Nassar controversy and compares it to the Penn State sex-abuse scandal.\n\nWednesday, Jan. 17: Tiffany Thomas Lopez, a former MSU softball player, describes how she complained to MSU athletic trainers in 1999 and 2000 about Nassar's intravaginal treatments, to no avail.\n\nAmanda Thomashow tells of filing a Title IX report, as well as a report with MSU police in 2014 accusing Nassar of molesting her during an office visit.\n\nNassar was cleared in Title IX investigation. The police recommended criminal charges against Nassar, but the Ingham County Prosecutor's Office dismissed the case. Meanwhile, MSU let Nassar see patients for 16 months while under criminal investigation.\n\nWednesday afternoon, Simon attends the Nassar hearing with MSU Trustee Melanie Foster. During a court break, victims and their family members question Simon about MSU's role in the controversy.\n\nThursday, Jan. 18: Nassar victim Lindsey Lemke, a former MSU gymnast, gets applause for a fiery denunciation of MSU, describing how then-gymnast coach Kathie Klages continued to defend Nassar even after he was fired.\n\nTo Simon, Lemke says: \"I don't know how you can still call yourself a president...You are no president of mine.\"\n\nOutside the courtroom, Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, and Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint, issue a rare joint statement that calls on Simon to resign. That call is joined by several other lawmakers, including the senator and representative from East Lansing.\n\nFriday, Jan. 19: Nassar victim Amy Labadie, former team manager for the MSU gymnastics team, tells the court: \"I gave MSU my everything. That's all changed. I can't get over the monsters who turned a blind eye to the monster that is Larry Nassar.\"\n\nLarissa Boyce, another Nassar victim, says she and another teen complained in 1997 about Nassar's intravaginal treatments. Boyce said the complaints were made to Kathie Klages, then head coach for MSU gymnastics, who defended Nassar and dismissed the girls' complaints.\n\n\"This could have stopped in 1997,\" Boyce says. \"But instead of notifying authorities or even my parents, we were interrogated. We were led to believe we were misunderstanding a medical technique.\"\n\nOutside the courtroom, the MSU Board of Trustees convene an emergency closed-door session. After four hours, they unanimously reaffirm their support for Simon but take no questions from reporters.\n\nThe board does ask Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette to conduct an investigation into the university's handling of the Nassar controversy.\n\nAlso Friday, in separate conversations with sports reporters, MSU football coach Mark Dantanio and MSU basketball coach Tom Izzo offer their support for Simon.\n\nSaturday, Jan. 20: MSU Trustee Mitch Lyons break ranks with the board and says Simon needs to go. His statement reads in part: \"As I expressed repeatedly to fellow board members during our discussion Friday, I don't believe Pres. Simon can survive the public outcry that has been generated by this tragedy and even less so after hearing the testimony of these brave survivors of Larry Nassar's abuse.\"\n\nSunday, Jan. 21: After getting slammed on social media by the mother of Aly Raisman, a Olympian gold medalist and Nassar victim, Izzo issues a \"clarification\" of his Friday remarks, in which he said, \"I hope the right guy was convicted.\"\n\nIn his clarification, Izzo says he \"used the wrong words\" and \"my overall message was, and remains, that I have tremendous admiration for the courage the survivors have shown.\"\n\nMonday, Jan. 22: Nassar victim Marta Stern, now a physical therapist, says MSU had the duty as an educational and medical institution to protect Nassar's patients, and says the university's lack of accountability \"has been repulsive and inexcusable.\"\n\nOutside the courtroom, Joel Ferguson, vice chairman of the MSU Board of Trustees, is interviewed on a sports-talk radio show. He calls the Nassar controversy \"a lot noise,\" says there's no chance of Simon resigning and scoffs at the idea of an NCAA investigation in the Nassar situation.\n\nFerguson's only reference to the victims focuses on a possible financial settlement. \"You can never use money to completely make over people's pain and suffering, but there's going to be something happen in their favor,\" Ferguson says.\n\nTuesday, Jan. 23: In a victim-impact statement read by her parents, Morgan Valley points out that MSU received its first complaint about Nassar in 1997, before she was born. She was abused during appointments in 2014 and 2015, a time when -- unbeknownst to Valley -- Nassar was under criminal investigation for molesting Amanda Thomashow.\n\n\"As parents, we are overcome by anger and guilt,\" says Marty Valley, Morgan's father.\n\nTuesday night, it's reported the NCAA has opened an investigation into Michigan State over the Nassar scandal.\n\nAlso Tuesday night, Ferguson issues a statement saying he \"deeply regrets the inadvertent comment he made on a local radio program that trivialized the experience of the victims of Larry Nassar.\"\n\nWednesday, Jan. 24: Rachael Denhollander is the final victim to speak at the sentencing hearing, and lambasts MSU. \"You keep saying there is no criminal cover-up, but you play word games,\" she says. \"No one knew because no one handled the reports properly. Victims were silenced.\"\n\nIn her statement to the court, Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis alludes to institutional failures that failed to stop Nassar. He \"would still be on the Michigan State University campus abusing kids if not for investigative reporters and Rachael Denhollander,\" the first victim to go public, Povilaitis says.\n\nIngham County Circuit Judge Aquilina is even more pointed. \"There has to be a massive investigation as to why there was inaction, why there was silence,\" she says. \"Justice requires more than what I can do on this bench.\"\n\nWednesday afternoon, MSU Trustee Dianne Byrum and U.S. Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters all put out statements calling on Simon to step down.\n\nBy Wednesday night, Simon's resignation letter was posted on MSU's website."
