This multi-disciplinary approach brings together all the professionals and agencies needed to offer comprehensive and child friendly services to abused children and their families.\n\nPrimary program objectives are:\n\n􀂃 Provide 24 hour emergency shelter for children taken into protective custody (15 bed capacity).\n\n􀂃 Provide a safe, child friendly environment for children to be interviewed and assessed for abuse.\n\n􀂃 Provide best practice placement planning for children who will not return to their biological home.\n\n􀂃 Provide crisis intervention and trauma counseling for children, parents, and family members.\n\n􀂃 Provide support groups for parent, children and teens who have been victimized by abuse.\n\n􀂃 Provide support and assistance to families during the time of family restructuring.\n\n􀂃 Provide advocacy services to children and non-offending parents before, during and after court testimony.\n\nTarget Population\n\nThe target population for Angel House is children (aged birth to seventeen) who have been physically or sexually abused or severely neglected and their non-offending caregivers. The Angel House facility is located in Mason at 830 Kerns Road and serves all of Ingham County. Considering that over 90% of abused children live in poverty, the population served is largely comprised of low-income families.\n\nStatement of Need\n\nAngel House responds to a growing need and gap in services for child victims of abuse and their family members. Last year, the Ingham County Department of Human Services (DHS) substantiated 1,327 cases of child abuse and neglect in Ingham County. An additional 565 cases were investigated by law enforcement agencies. Data on the incidence of sexual abuse from Sparrow Hospital Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE) indicate that more than 200 abused children were examined in 2005. These numbers represent a disturbing trend: since 1997, Ingham County has experienced higher and increasing rates of child abuse and foster care placement compared to the majority of Michigans counties.\n\nAngel House was developed by a local group of private and public sector child welfare leaders. The group identified the critical gaps in the Ingham County child welfare service continuum as\n\nfollows: (1) Children in need of emergency shelter are quite often taken into protective custody in the middle of the night, in large sibling groups and end up sleeping on the floors of offices, or riding around in police cars until emergency foster care can be located; (2) Siblings are often split up at the time of emergency removal; (3) placement planning for children who will not return home is inadequate, often resulting in repeated moves from foster or relative homes to other homes; (4) there is little coordination among the agencies that investigate, assess, treat, and support child victims. It is not uncommon for a child to be interviewed by law enforcement, child protective services, prosecuting attorney, physician, and a mental health practitioner on separate days, at separate (and often inappropriate) locations  adding further trauma to the child and stress to the family.\n\nAngel House opened in late May. At the end of October, 111 admissions to shelter care and 157 forensic interviews had been provided.\n\nProgram Outcomes\n\nThe following outcomes are stated in the United Way grant for Angel House:\n\n 400 unduplicated Ingham County cases (children and parents) will access and complete services.\n\n 80% of families served become safe and stable family units, demonstrating changed behaviors or conditions.\n\n 90% of families will not have an additional confirmed complaint of abuse and neglect demonstrating changed behaviors or conditions or new skills or knowledge.\n\n 85% of parents served will demonstrate new knowledge and skills in areas of appropriate discipline, parent-child boundaries, child nurturing and developmental needs and communication.\n\n 80% of children served will demonstrate reduced trauma and anxiety and report improved functioning; and report that their family environment is safe, stable, and healthy.\n\nCommunity Continuum of Care\n\nThe attached Angel House Service and Community Continuum flow chart best describes how the two services of Angel House (Emergency Shelter/Placement Planning and Forensic Assessment) are critical to the continuum of services to abused and neglected children.\n\nInteragency collaborative agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) have been signed by the Ingham County Department of Human Services-Childrens Protective Services, Ingham County Prosecuting Attorneys Office, Ingham County Circuit Court-Family Division, Ingham County Sherriffs Office, Lansing Police Department, and Sparrow Health System.\n\nContact Information\n\nJim Paparella\n\nExecutive Director\n\nChild & Family Services, Capital Area\n\n4287 Five Oaks Drive\n\nLansing, MI 48911\n\n517.882.4000 ext. 123\n\n[email protected]\n\nThe following resolution was introduced by the Law Enforcement and Finance Committees:\n\nRESOLUTION TO AMEND THE LICENSE FEE FOR UN-STERILIZED DOGS AND ADJUST THE ANIMAL CONTROL DEPARTMENTS 2007 BUDGET\n\nRESOLUTION #06-336\n\nWHEREAS, the Ingham County Animal Control Ordinance was adopted by the Board of Commissioners on September 18, 1972; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Ingham County Board of Commissioners on July 27, 1999, amended the Ingham County Animal Control Ordinance so that fees and expenses established by the Animal Control Ordinance could be changed from time to time by action of the Board of Commissioners; and\n\nWHEREAS, the current license fee for un-sterilized dogs does not create incentive for pet owners to spay or neuter their pets, and un-sterilized dogs account for the majority of service calls and resources used by Animal Control to address stray dogs running at large, dog bite cases, nuisance complaints and dogs relinquished to the Shelter; and\n\nWHEREAS, an increase in the number of new neutered animals becoming licensed and a decline in un-altered animals can be achieved along with a higher rate of compliance; and\n\nWHEREAS, an increased license fee for un-sterilized dogs could accomplish a reduction in the number of strays while at the same time increase revenues for the County; and\n\nWHEREAS, the incident of dog bites will decrease (435 dog bite cases in 2005) in addition to an increase in the number of dogs licensed; and\n\nWHEREAS, the fee adjustments will provide assistance to low income citizens who currently have hindrances affecting their ability to spay or neuter their pets; and\n\nWHEREAS, enhancing citizen safety, wise-use of resources, and providing the citizens with an effective animal control program could also be achieved; and\n\nWHEREAS, the increased revenues will exceed the cost of the positions added; and\n\nWHEREAS, an outcome of this action will be a reduction in the number of stray animals turned into the Shelter (Ingham County Animal Control received 2,314 dogs), and a reduction in euthanasia as a result of dogs being spayed or neutered (Ingham County Animal Control euthanized 698 dogs in 2005) thus reducing overpopulation; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Animal Control Department and the Animal Control Advisory Board has recommended an adjustment in this fee schedule.\n\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Ingham County Board of Commissioners hereby adopts the following fees for the Animal Control Department effective January 1, 2007:\n\nLicense fee for Sterilized Dog s (remains the same) $ 12 Delinquent $24\n\nThree-Year License $ 30\n\nLicense fee for Un-Sterilized Dogs $ 40 Delinquent $80\n\nThree-Year License $100\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the remainder of the Ingham County Animal Control Ordinance and the fees of the Ingham County Animal Control Department, as amended, shall remain unchanged.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Controller is authorized to amend the 2007 Animal Control Budget and Position Allocation List in accordance with this Resolution by increasing Dog License revenue $100,000 to pay for the staff increases and spay/neuter fund at a cost of $59,315.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a part-time Animal Shelter Operator, position number 421018, FOP/AC 1, be increased to full-time with the available funds.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a part-time Redemption Clerk/Dispatcher, position number 421019, UAW/C, be increased to full-time with available funds.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the temporary seasonal Animal Control Officer, position number 421805, be increased to a part-time permanent position, FOP/AC 2, with available funds.\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT: Nolan, Copedge, De Leon, Thomas, Schafer, Vickers\n\nNays: None Absent: None Approved 11/30/06\n\nFINANCE: Yeas: Thomas, Grebner, Weatherwax-Grant, Dougan\n\nNays: None Absent: Hertel, Dedden Approved 12/6/06\n\nAdopted as part of the consent agenda.\n\nThe following resolution was introduced by the Law Enforcement, Judiciary and Finance Committees:\n\nRESOLUTION AUTHORIZING A CAREER QUEST CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR THE INTEGRATION PHASE OF THE\n\nINTEGRATED JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\nRESOLUTION #06-337\n\nWHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners is under contract with Career Quest for professional management services on the Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) project;
