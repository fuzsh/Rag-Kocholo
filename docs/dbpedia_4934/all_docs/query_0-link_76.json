        "text": "EAST LANSING – A Michigan State trustee is calling for an investigation into who allegedly leaked the name of a sexual misconduct complainant to the media in the case involving Spartans football coach Mel Tucker.\n\nDianne Byrum, a Michigan State trustee and former chair of the Board of Trustees, said in a statement released on Wednesday that she is “disturbed and outraged” by allegations from sexual assault survivor and survivor advocate Brenda Tracy that her name was leaked to the media while MSU investigates her sexual harassment claim against Tucker.\n\n“We should unequivocally condemn attempts to silence or retaliate against victims,” Byrum said. “I call on Michigan State University to thoroughly investigate these troubling allegations and hold anyone who is found to have leaked or released the claimant’s name accountable.\n\n“We need to do everything in our power to ensure victims of sexual assault and abuse can come forward without fear or intimidation and have full confidence their identities and private information will be kept confidential.”\n\nTracy’s complaint became public early Sunday morning in a story from USA Today. Her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, later said in a statement that an “outside party” leaked Tracy’s name to “local media,” leading her to go public with her story.\n\nTracy later clarified in a statement of her own that she shared case documents with USA Today with the intention of a story being published after Michigan State’s investigation process finished. When her name was allegedly leaked, she agreed to have the story published earlier than planned.\n\n“I am angry that my right to confidentiality has been violated and I hope that those responsible are held accountable,” Tracy wrote in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nByrum called on Michigan State to be transparent regarding the case.\n\n“In the past MSU has not been as transparent as it should’ve been during times of crisis, and we need to learn from these painful experiences and improve if we are going to regain the trust of our Spartan Community and move forward,” Byrum said.\n\nMichigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sunday. The case is scheduled for a hearing beginning on Oct. 5 to determine if Tucker violated the school’s sexual misconduct policy."
