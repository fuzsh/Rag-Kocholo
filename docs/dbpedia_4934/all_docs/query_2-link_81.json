        "text": "The general public won't have a chance to vet or weigh in on any specific candidates to be the next president of Michigan State University.\n\nDianne Byrum and Melanie Foster, the two MSU board members leading the search for a replacement for interim President John Engler, announced the decision in an email to the MSU community Wednesday.\n\nThe decision means there will be no open interviews or town halls with candidates. Instead, the board will make the decision and conduct the interviews in private.\n\nIn doing so, MSU mirrors a trend across much of higher education. Oakland University was a notable exception in its last search for a president. It held candidate town halls with finalists that were open to anyone.\n\nRead more:\n\nMichigan State University picks firm for presidential search\n\nOakland U names Ora Pescovitz as next president\n\nThe email from the MSU board said the closed search was the only way to get good candidates.\n\n\"Our consultant, Dr. Teresa Sullivan, and our search firm, Storbeck|Pimentel, both have advised that the majority of presidential searches at research-intensive universities during the past three years have been confidential, as most highly qualified candidates are not willing to be recruited for an open search. Additionally, MSU is competing for highly qualified presidential candidates at the same time as several other universities around the country, most of which are conducting confidential searches.\n\n\"In order to draw the strongest pool of candidates, the search for the next MSU president will be confidential.\"\n\nThe email said the board will continue to use a search committee made up of representatives from across campus to advise it during the rest of the process. Committee members would have access to the names of candidates.\n\nThe Board of Trustees selected former Michigan governor John Engler earlier this year to serve as interim president. A controversial pick, Engler has been criticized for the way he spoke to and about Larry Nassar's victims, among other issues.\n\nEngler replaced Lou Anna Simon, who resigned in disgrace following the Nassar scandal. She recently was charged with criminal charges stemming from her actions during the scandal, in which the former MSU doctor was accused of molesting more than 200 women.\n\nMSU hopes to conduct initial interviews with candidates between November and January, with final interviews from February to May. An announcement on the new president could come in June.\n\nContact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter: @reporterdavidj"
