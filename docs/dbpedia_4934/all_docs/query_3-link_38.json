        "text": "Respected for her remarkable versatility and profound depth in acting, Dianne Wiest is a titan of both the big screen and theatre. Born on March 28, 1948, in Kansas City, Missouri, Wiest pursued a degree in Arts from the University of Maryland before embarking upon her acclaimed career. Her journey began on stage, performing in several off-Broadway productions and regional theater shows, where she honed her craft and prepared herself for the illustrious career that was to follow. Wiest's breakthrough came via her collaboration with the iconic director Woody Allen, which has been a significant marker in her career. She delivered unforgettable performances in Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and Bullets Over Broadway (1994), earning her two Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress. Additionally, Wiest's performance in Parenthood (1989) earned her an Academy Award nomination, further cementing her place in Hollywood. However, her prowess is not limited to films alone. Wiest's television credits are equally impressive, having won two Emmy Awards - one for her role in the series Road to Avonlea (1990) and the other for the drama In Treatment (2008). Yet, despite her cinematic accomplishments, Wiest remains deeply rooted in the world of theatre. She continued her stage work parallel to her screen appearances, earning a Theatre World Award for her Broadway debut in Othello (1982), and later, two Obie Awards for The Art Of Dining (1979) and Rasheeda Speaking (2016). Simultaneously, she received Tony nominations for her work in In the Summer House (1993) and The Seagull (1998). Wiest's commitment to her craft, her versatility across mediums, and the depth of her performances, firmly place her as one of the most respected actors in the annals of American performance arts.\n\nDianne Goldman Berman Feinstein (born Dianne Emiel Goldman; June 22, 1933 â€“ September 29, 2023) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from California from 1992 until her death in 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she served as mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988. By the time of her death, Feinstein was the oldest sitting U.S. senator and member of Congress. She was also the longest-serving U.S. senator from California, the longest-tenured female senator in history, and the senior Democratic member of the Senate."
