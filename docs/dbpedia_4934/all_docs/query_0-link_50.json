        "text": "After more than four decades, the Grundy family has sold their Ace Hardware store in Howell.\n\nOwners Cliff Grundy and his brother-in-law Jay Mellin have retired, but the store at at 1250 East Grand River Ave. in the city will remain family-owned.\n\nGrundy and Mellin, who hail from West Bloomfield, sold the hardware store last month to Jim and Dianne Byrum of Ingham County.\n\n\"It was quite a wonderful run,\" Cliff Grundy, 67, said Thursday by phone between golf swings on an outing with Mellin. \"We're enjoying our retirement. ...but it's bittersweet, after all these years having left so abruptly.\"\n\nGrundy and Mellin, also 67, said they had not planned to sell the store until Jim Byrum walked in the door one day and made them an offer.\n\nThe Byrum's own Ace hardware stores in Leslie, Stockbridge, Holt and Charlotte, and their son Jim Byrum, Jr. owns the Pinckney True Value Hardware. The Byrum's took over the business just a few weeks after making an offer.\n\n\"There have been so many memories,\" Grundy said.\n\nREAD MORE: Howell High grad to appear on 'Blue Bloods' TV show\n\nREAD MORE: 'Emporium' opening in downtown Howell\n\nHis father Seymour Grundy, 93, first opened an Ace Hardware store in the former Brighton mall in 1971. They moved the store to Howell in 1975.\n\n\"My favorite memories were to be able to work with my father,\" Grundy said. \"We had a lot of family time.\"\n\nThe success of the family's businesses — they also owned a string of auto shops before selling them — allowed them to buy and breed race horses.\n\n\"One of our first horses made more than a half million dollars racing and we sold it to a stud farm in Sweden,\" Grundy said. \"Another horse earned over $1 million ... and he was the most expensive stud in America in the mid-80s.\"\n\nGrundy plans to spend retirement caring for his father, who suffered a stroke a little over a year ago but is recovering, and \"racing my horses from the computer and television.\"\n\nMellin plans to spend his retirement staying healthy and spending time with his grandchildren.\n\n\"Selling the store was just one of those crazy things that happened,\" Mellin said. \"We were running a successful business, but everything is for sale for the right price.\"\n\nThe family watched the retail business changed over the years.\n\n\"It was the technology, the competition, the world has changed with online sales, but our family picked a niche ... and we smothered (the competition) with customer service.\"\n\nNext chapter, new products\n\nThe Byrum's are making changes at the store, which will be called Byrum Ace Hardware, including an expanded product line and building improvements, according to Jim Byrum, who also serves as president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association.\n\nDianne Byrum is currently a trustee for the Michigan State University Board of Trustees and previously served as a state Representative. She also owns Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications, a Lansing public relations firm.\n\n\"We're going to expand plumbing, electrical and fasteners,\" and also have a \"more robust\" line of outdoor products such as grills,\" Byrum said. \"There will be several niche lines that will be in there. ...We'll have Yeti coolers.\"\n\nThey are also adding a new key-making center and expanding the color mix paint system.\n\nThe sales floor will be expanded by about 1,000 square feet to make room for more products. The store will also get new fixtures, lights, counters and a fresh coat of paint.\n\n\"We'll invest well over $100,000 in infrastructure, fixtures and the new computer system, and the overall investment will be much more,\" Byrum said. \"We want to expand the lines and also build on the Grundy's legacy.\"\n\nHe expects to hire several more employees in the near future and says all of the old employees have stayed on.\n\nAssistant Manager Preston Buesching, 23, enjoyed working for the Grundy family for several years and is also looking forward to the coming store improvements.\n\n\"They are bringing in a lot more products we never carried, like grills, lawnmowers and power tools,\" Buesching said. \"A lot of people are excited for the change and we're trying to get them excited about it as well.\"\n\nLongtime customers and Howell residents Max and Gladys Willmore, both 78, prefer shopping at the store over big box stores.\n\n\"They are always helpful,\" Max Willmore said. \"They are friendly and you're dealing with local people. It's not a box store. ...It's smaller, so you walk in, get what you want and walk out.\"\n\nContact Livingston Daily reporter Jennifer Timar at 517-548-7148 or at jtimar@livingstondaily.com.
