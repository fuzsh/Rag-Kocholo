        "text": "LANSING — A pair of former Michigan State University trustees has called for current board member Dianne Byrum to resign over a report that she and her husband underpaid tens of thousands of dollars in property taxes over a decade.\n\n\"The Detroit news report about Dianne Byrum's failure to pay her local school mileage tax, claiming homestead exemptions on two houses since 2017, shows she is unfit to govern any education institution,\" Brian Mosallam and Pat O'Keefe, both trustees emeriti, wrote in the letter.\n\nThis week, The Detroit News reported that Byrum and her husband Jim have owned houses in both Onondaga in Ingham County and Ferrysburg in Ottawa County and for at least some years claimed principal home tax exemptions on both. The News said the couple saved at least $75,000 since 2012.\n\nByrum characterized the situation as an error on the part of local officials.\n\n\"As an elected leader and businesswoman for decades, paying taxes on time and in full has been part of my core values,\" she said in a statement to the State Journal Thursday afternoon. \"Recently, I was made aware of an error regarding the way our property taxes had been calculated. Upon learning of this error, I immediately notified the local assessor and re-submitted all necessary forms to ensure the calculation was accurate and all paperwork was up to date. I have also paid all property taxes owed in full.\"\n\nByrum did not say how much she paid in taxes to satisfy the underpayment. She also did not comment on the call for her to resign as a board member.\n\nByrum is a founding partner at Byrum & Fisk Communications in East Lansing. She is the immediate past chairperson of the MSU Board of Trustees. She was first elected to the board in 2008 and reelected in 2016. Her second term will end on Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nByrum also was elected to the Michigan House in 1991, and to the state Senate in 1995, returning to the House in 2002. She served on the Ingham County Board of Commissioners from 1983 to 1990.\n\nIn their letter, the former trustees said Byrum has compromised her ability to serve and violated her duty of care to taxpayers of the state.\n\n\"It is unconscionable that an elected official of a higher education institution would cheat teachers and children out of the tax dollars needed in the classrooms,\" they wrote. \"It is unbelievable, that as a former state legislator and minority floor leader, Byrum was unaware of the basic law that you can only claim one house as your primary residence.\n\n\"That weak excuse that it was a 'paperwork error' is proof that she either does not care enough about making sure she is in compliance with state law or that she is using political influence to have local township officials give her cover especially considering her daughter is the county clerk,\" Mosallam and O'Keefe said.\n\nMosallam served as trustee from 2012-20, when he lost his reelection bid to O’Keefe, who served for two years before resigning in 2022."
