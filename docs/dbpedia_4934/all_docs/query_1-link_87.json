        "text": "EAST LANSING – Michigan State has launched an investigation to find out who allegedly leaked the identity of the woman who made a sexual harassment complaint against Spartans football coach Mel Tucker.\n\nThe university contracted law firm Jones Day “to conduct an investigation into alleged breaches of confidentiality by MSU officials and others” in the school’s office of civil rights case involving Tucker, it announced on Monday.\n\nThe investigation was spurred by a claim from national sexual assault victim advocate Brenda Tracy that her identity was leaked after she filed a complaint against Tucker in December. That complaint led to Tucker being suspended as the Spartans’ football coach on Sunday, Sept. 10.\n\nMichigan State trustee Dianne Byrum publicly called for an investigation last week, saying she was “disturbed and outraged” by the alleged leak.\n\n“We need to do everything in our power to ensure victims of sexual assault and abuse can come forward without fear or intimidation and have full confidence their identities and private information will be kept confidential,” Byrum said.\n\nByrum released her statement on Sept. 13. Michigan State said in its statement that it began the investigation on Sept. 12.\n\n“Confidentiality in Office for Civil Rights cases is paramount,” the school said in a statement. “The university investigation will be thorough, and the outside firm will follow the facts wherever they may lead.”"
