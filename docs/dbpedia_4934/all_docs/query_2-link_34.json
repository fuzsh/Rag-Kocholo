        "text": "Blanche Diane Byrum, 74, was called to her final resting place Wednesday, July 3, 2024, at 12:27 p.m. at Fort Sanders Regional Hospital, Knoxville, Tenn., with her family by her side.\n\nBlanche was widely known as Diane. She was born on Nov. 23, 1949, in Coral Gables, Fla., to Frank and Norma Etheredge Buhrmaster. On Dec. 31, 1967, Diane married Robert E. Sherrard Sr. in Coral Gables, Fla. They moved to Indiana and called Pierceton home. He preceded her in death on Sept. 27, 1989. Diane later married Hoyt Byrum on May 13, 1996; he survives.\n\nDuring her time in Pierceton, Diane was a member of Pierceton Presbyterian Church and the Order of Eastern Star. Diane worked for United Telephone Company until taking early retirement in 1996 and relocating to Melbourne, Fla. A lifelong learner, Diane completed her degree from Boston University as a paralegal in 2011 before retiring in 2016 from the Brevard County Attorney’s Office.\n\nDiane enjoyed traveling with her husband, reading, knitting anything from socks to sweaters and sewing. As a talented seamstress, Diane made many treasured outfits and custom wedding dresses. Diane looked forward to and enjoyed spending time with family and friends, catching up over a good cup of tea, which paired perfectly with her homemade shortbread cookies.\n\nDiane will be dearly remembered as a loving wife, mother, sister, aunt, grandmother, great-grandmother and cousin. She will be forever loved by her family and friends.\n\nDiane is survived by her three little women: Elizabeth “Beth” Sherrard, Melbourne, Fla.; Amy (William) Alberding, Warsaw; and Megan (Neil) Hodges, Syracuse; two stepchildren, Jennifer Meyer, Titusville, Fla.; and Michael (Lauren) Byrum, Fort Wayne; sister, Kym (David) Arter, Melbourne, Fla.; and sister-in-law, Elaine Buhrmaster, Laurens, S.C. She also leaves behind her beloved seven grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, four step-grandchildren, one step-great-grandchild, one niece, one nephew, three great-nephews, one great-niece and several cousins.\n\nIn addition to her parents, Frank, Norma and Fran Buhrmaster, and first husband, Robert E. Sherrard Sr., she was preceded in death by her brother, Robert “Sparky” Buhrmaster; son, Robert E. “Bobby” Sherrard Jr.; and granddaughter, Victoria Alberding.\n\nPer Diane’s wishes, no services are planned at this time. A celebration of life will be held at a later date.\n\nDonations to the American Cancer Society Hope Lodge in Nashville, Tenn., can be made by donating to the following: https://raiseyourway.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donate.event&eventID=1215"
