In 1922, Kozintsev and Trauberg organized the Theater Workshop "Factory of an Eccentric Actor", and in the same year they put in it an eccentric reworking of "Marriage" by Nikolay Gogol. For two years, they staged 3 more plays based on their own plays, and in 1924 they transferred their experiments in the field of eccentric comedy to cinema, transforming the theater workshop into the FEKS Film Workshop.

The first full-length film by Kozintsev and Trauberg - the romantic melodrama Chyortovo koleso (1926) according to the script of Adrian Piotrovsky - was already a mature work.
