        "text": "Alan Schneider (December 12, 1917 – May 3, 1984) was an American theatre director responsible for more than 100 theatre productions. In 1984 he was honored with a Drama Desk Special Award for serving a wide range of playwrights. He directed the 1956 American premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Edward Albee's Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Tiny Alice; the American première of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane, Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, as well as Pinter's The Dumb Waiter, The Collection, and a trilogy of Pinter's plays under the title Other Places (including One for the Road, Family Voices, and A Kind of Alaska); Bertolt Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle; You Know I Can't Hear You When the Water's Running; and Michael Weller's Moonchildren and Loose Ends. Schneider also directed Samuel Beckett's only direct foray into the world of film, entitled Film. The short subject starred Buster Keaton and its direction is often mis-attributed to Samuel Beckett himself, notably during an exhibit at the Louvre in November 2006. \"Film\" is a silent exploration of Bishop Berkeley's principle 'esse est percipi' (to be is to be perceived). One of a select group of non-actors awarded membership in The Actors Studio, Schneider taught at Catholic University, City College of the City University of New York, The Juilliard School (where he was director of the theatre program), the University of California, Riverside, and the University of California, San Diego, whose library maintains an archive of his papers. He was associated with Arena Stage for 30 years. He was also the co-artistic director of The Acting Company. At the time of his death, he served as president of the board of directors for Theatre Communications Group (TCG)."
