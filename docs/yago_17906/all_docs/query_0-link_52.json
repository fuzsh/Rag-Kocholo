        "text": "Battleship Potemkin movie (1925)\n\nBattleship Potemkin (Russian: Броненосец «Потёмкин», Bronenosets Patyomkin), is a 1925 Soviet silent film directed by Sergei Eisenstein and produced by Mosfilm. It presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers. Battleship Potemkin was named the greatest film of all time at the Brussels World's Fair in 1958. The film is set in June 1905; the protagonists of the film are the members of the crew of the Potemkin, a battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet. Eisenstein divided the plot into five acts, each with its own title: Act I: \"Men and Maggots\" in which the sailors protest at having to eat rotten meat; Act II: \"Drama on the Deck\" in which the sailors mutiny and their leader, Vakulinchuk, is killed; Act III: \"A Dead Man Calls for Justice\" in which Vakulinchuk's body is mourned over by the people of Odessa; Act IV: \"The Odessa Steps\", in which imperial soldiers massacre the Odessans; Act V: \"One against all\" in which the squadron tasked with intercepting the Potemkin instead declines to engage; lowering their guns, its sailors cheer on the rebellious battleship and join the mutiny. Directed by Sergei M. Eisenstein Running time 1:11:38\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2986SLGCgeE\n\nOctober (Ten Days that Shook the World) movie (1928)\n\nIn documentary style, events in Petrograd are re-enacted from the end of the monarchy in February of 1917 to the end of the provisional government and the decrees of peace and of land in November of that year. Lenin returns in April. In July, counter-revolutionaries put down a spontaneous revolt, and Lenin's arrest is ordered. By late October, the Bolsheviks are ready to strike: ten days will shake the world. While the Mensheviks vacillate, an advance guard infiltrates the palace. Anatov-Oveyenko leads the attack and declares the proclamation dissolving the provisional government.\n\nDirected by Grigori Aleksandrov, Sergei M. Eisenstein\n\nRunning time 1:42:20\n\nThe New Babylon movie (1929)\n\nIn the beginning of the industrial revolution, the Paris Commune was established in 1871 against the rich and the powerful, and violently repressed by the army that remained faithful to a tamer form of Republicanism. How could the love story between a young sales girl and a soldier unable to decide if he was pro or against the radical fashion? Two short months were needed for the answer to be found - in blood and tears, and under rain that washes all past memories. Any day, a New Babylon shop will open with frilly things for the bourgeois girls. The washerwomen will be there to wash them.\n\nRunning time 1:33:27\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rzm1iSHIjY&list=UUTKpdDNg-FgqRDg7TbIOgoQ&index=21\n\nThe Great Consoler movie (1933)\n\nThe film takes place in America in 1899, and in its principal plot depicts Bill Porter, who is the great consoler of the title, in prison. His writing skills earn him privileges from the governor and he is spared the inhumane treatment meted out to other prisoners. Porter is very much aware of the brutality around him but, mindful of his better conditions, refuses to write about prison life. He prefers to console his less-well-treated friends, and indeed all his readers, with excessively romantic fantasies in which good invariably triumphs.\n\nRunning time 1:31:32\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8CPiTheCA&index=31&list=UUTKpdDNg-FgqRDg7TbIOgoQ\n\nДезертир / Deserter (1933)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS0mMuPY-48\n\nThunderstorm movie (1934)\n\nIn a provincial town on the Volga River, the young and sensitive Katerina marries Tikhon, a violent drunkard, and thus enters the crude milieu of greedy salesmen, the \"dark kingdom\".

One day, when Tikhon is away, she meets Boris, a man who embodies everything Katerina is longing for.\n\nRunning time 1:20:14\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWbCGl868HE&index=19&list=UUTKpdDNg-FgqRDg7TbIOgoQ\n\nA Strict Young Man movie (1935)\n\nThe characters debate the role of free love and free will within the Soviet social and political economy.\n\nRunning time 1:34:42\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNsLIDIgJc&list=UUTKpdDNg-FgqRDg7TbIOgoQ&index=20\n\nMasquerade movie (1941)\n\nThe play begins when beautiful Nina (Makarova) loses a bracelet during a masked ball.

The film depicts the effects of Arbenin's jealousy on everyone around the couple, leading to a quarrel with and calculated humiliation of the officer, Arbenin poisoning his wife, and finishes with a strange out of left field \"I told you so\" from someone who Arbenin had injured a decade earlier.\n\nRunning time 1:41:15\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MRJtlXtG6I&list=UUTKpdDNg-FgqRDg7TbIOgoQ&index=4\n\nThe Fall of Berlin documentary film (1945)\n\nFall of Berlin – 1945, The Fall of Berlin, or just Berlin is a Soviet documentary film about the Battle of Berlin, titled in Russian Битва за Берлин 1945 г., literally The Battle for Berlin – 1945. The film was directed by Yuli Raizman and Yelizaveta Svilova. The film begins with an animated map of Eastern Europe with Soviet soldier double exposed on the bottom. The narrator lists the names of the rivers that the Red Army crosses as they march west: Volga, Don, Desna, Dnieper, Bug, Dvina, Neman, Vistula, and finally, Oder. The Soviet arrival at the Oder river is shown, along with the broken bridges across it. The undeterred men of the Red Army are shown as they cross the river while under German fire. The use of missile artillery by the Soviet forces is showcased. After the Oder is crossed, the assault on Berlin itself begins. Footage of the actual battle is shown, as the Red Army fights German troops, street by street and building by building. This is interspersed with shots of Nazi propaganda films showing parades in the same areas, providing a sense of irony. A dramatic sequence follows a detachment of the Red Army in the assault on the Reichstag, which ends with the famous photograph, raising the Red Flag over the Reichstag.\n\nWhen the Russian troops entered Berlin, they began to push forward to the Reichstag. There were soldiers from every available battalion, with flame throwers, rifles, sniper rifles, automatic weapons, like the PPSh-41, and others. There were over 40 Soviet T-34 tanks that were pushing the German soldiers back. The battle for Berlin was one of the longest battles for a city in the years 1900-2000.Shortly before the Russian troops entered Berlin, Hitler was ready to make a half-peace with England and the USA, giving away Berlin to them. He said: \"I'd rather give Berlin to the Americans or the English, only to prevent Russian forces from taking it over!\", but he thought of this too late. Shortly after that the Russians approached and attacked Berlin. On the 8th of May, 1945, the flag of the USSR replaced the Nazi German flag in Berlin. This was the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nRunning time 1:03:09\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxaydnqp0jg\n\nThe Village Teacher movie (1947)\n\nVillage Teacher was the first postwar production by Soviet director Mark Donskoy, of \"Gorky Trilogy\" fame. Vera Maretskaya stars as Varenka, a starry-eyed young Moscow teacher who accepts a post in a forsaken Siberian village. The story follows Varenka's career from the pre-revolutionary Czarist regime to the end of WWII. It is a period of great unrest in the world and shattering personal heartbreak for Varenka.\n\nRunning time 1:38:17\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HmfemznIAE&index=15&list=UUTKpdDNg-FgqRDg7TbIOgoQ\n\nПадение Берлина. Серия 1 / The Fall of Berlin film 1 (1950)\n\nPart 1\n\nAlexei Ivanov, a shy steel factory worker, greatly surpasses his production quota and is chosen to receive the Order of Lenin and to have a personal interview with Joseph Stalin. Alexei falls in love with the idealist teacher Natasha, but has difficulties approaching her. When he meets Stalin, who tends his garden, the leader helps him to understand his emotions and tells him to recite poetry to her. Then, they both have a luncheon with the rest of the Soviet leadership in Stalin's home. After returning from Moscow, Alexei confesses his love to Natasha. While they are both having a stroll in a wheat field, their town is attacked by the Germans, who invade the Soviet Union.\n\nAlexei loses his consciousness and sinks into a coma. When he awakes, he is told that Natasha is missing and that the Germans are at the gates of Moscow. In the capital, Stalin plans the defense of the city, explaining to the demoralized Georgy Zhukov how to deploy his forces. Alexei volunteers for the Red Army, takes part in the parade in the Red Square and in the Battle of Moscow. At Berlin, after receiving the blessings of his allies – Turkey, the Vatican, Romania and Japan – and watching a long column of Soviet slaves-laborers, Natasha among them, Adolf Hitler is furious to hear that Moscow has not fallen. He dismisses Walther von Brauchitsch from his office and offers the command of the army to Gerd von Rundstedt; the latter refuses, saying that Stalin is a great captain and Germany's defeat is certain. Hitler orders to attack Stalingrad. In the meanwhile, Göring negotiates with British capitalist Bedstone, who supplies Germany with needed materials. After the Soviet victory in Stalingrad, Vasily Chuikov tells Ivanov that Stalin is always with the Red Army. The storyline leaps to the Yalta Conference, where Stalin and his Western Allies debate the future of the war. The treacherous Winston Churchill intends to deny the Soviets access to Berlin and almost manages to convince the gullible Franklin Delano Roosevelt to accept his plans. And the war rages on toward Moscow, with Alexei in the midst of battle and Natasha trapped in the concentration camp.\n\nRunning time 1:10:45\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-hZam8dXHU&t=193s\n\nПадение Берлина. Серия 2 / The Fall of Berlin film 2 (1950)\n\nPart 2\n\nStalin asks his generals who will take Berlin, they or the Western Allies. The generals answer that they will capture the city. Alexei's Guards Army advances towards Berlin, while Hitler has a nervous breakdown and demands that his soldiers fight to the end. The Germans plan to execute the inmates of the concentration camp in which Natasha is held before the arrival of the Red Army, but Alexei's unit liberates the prisoners before they carry through their design. Natasha faints, and he does not find her. Hitler and the German leadership fall into despair and lose their grip on reality the closer the Soviets get to Berlin. Hitler orders to flood the subway stations as the Soviets approach, drowning thousands of civilians. He then marries Eva Braun and commits suicide. Gen. Hans Krebs carries the news of Hitler's death to the Red Army and begs for a ceasefire. Stalin orders to accept only an unconditional surrender. Alexei is chosen to carry the Victory Banner, alongside Mikhail Yegorov and Meliton Kantaria. Their division storms the Reichstag and the three hoist the banner atop of it. The Germans surrender and Red Army soldiers from throughout the USSR celebrate victory. Stalin's plane lands in Berlin, and he is greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of peoples of \"all the nations\", holding posters with his picture and waving various nations' flags. Stalin carries a speech in which he calls for world peace. Standing in the crowd, Alexei and Natasha recognize each other and are reunited. Natasha asks Stalin to let her kiss him on the cheek, and they hug while prisoners praise Stalin in numerous languages. The film ends with Stalin wishing all peace and happiness.\n\nRunning time 1:15:01"
