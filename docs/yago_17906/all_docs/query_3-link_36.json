        "text": "The New Babylon is a 1929 Soviet silent drama film written and directed by Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg. The movie tells the story of the time of the Paris Commune in the spring of 1871 during the postwar turmoil of the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71). The New Babylon is the name of the large department store in Paris, where Louise is employed as a saleswoman. She is involved with the Commune, in which Jean, an unpolitical young man from the country, has to fight as a soldier in the army controlled by the French government. Both are in love with each other, even though they are on different sides. But their love finds no place in a time of political turmoil.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film The New Babylon:\n\nHandguns\n\nSmith & Wesson No. 3 Russian Model\n\nFrench officers are armed with Smith & Wesson No.3 Russian Models which stands in for the Lefaucheux Revolver or the Remington M1858 that were used by French forces during this time period.\n\nRifles\n\nGras Model 1874\n\nSome French soldiers including Jean (Pyotr Sobolevsky) use Gras Model 1874 rifles standing in for correct Chassepot 1866 rifles. The Gras is based on Chassepot and looks very similar. The difference is that the Gras fires metallic cartridges.\n\nMauser Gewehr 1898\n\nThe majority of French soldiers in the movie use anachronistic German Gewehr 98 rifles. These rifles were captured during the First World War from the German Empire which may be a reference for the Prussian help to crack down the Paris Commune.\n\nKropatschek Model 1884\n\nParisian Commune members, Jean and the National Guard's soldier (Oleg Zhakov) also use French Kropatschek 1884 rifles which were not developed until about 10 years later.\n\nBerdan No. 2\n\nThe Berdan No. 2 Infantry rifle is also used by some revolutionaries.\n\nOther\n\nCannons"
