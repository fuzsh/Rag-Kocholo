        "text": "Howard Hawks, whose aviation melodramas must, we suspect, drive airline stock down from two to three points per showing, has produced another fatality-littered thriller in \"Only Angels Have Wings\" (even the title is ominous) which opened yesterday at the Music Hall. This once, however, Mr. Hawks has charitably transferred his operations base to Ecuador, presumably having exhausted his local sources, not to mention the patience of the commercial transport people.In Ecuador, in the banana port of Barranca, he has indulged himself and the vicarious adventurers in the audience in a delightful series of crack-ups, close-shaves and studiously dramatic speeches. It is all very exciting and Juvenile.Barranca, says Mr. Hawks, is a sultry little spot boasting a general store and bar, a swampy landing field and Cary Grant as operations manager for a junky air line which must maintain a regular schedule for six months to obtain the mail subsidy. Flying conditions are rarely better than impossible. There are the Andes, there is a narrow pass with clawing crags and a group of pilots who seem to be broad targets for all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, chiefly of feminine origin.We particularly marveled at one sequence in which a flyer, grounded by failing eyesight, breaks another's arm in a fight and soon is helping probe a bullet from the commander's shoulder. That is known as piling it on.Not content with this fell set-up, Mr. Hawks, as author, has chosen to add a few dramatic and romantic complications. Miss Arthur enters the scene as a stranded showgirl, and a less convincing showgirl than Miss Arthur would be hard to find. Enter, too, Richard Barthelmess as a pilot with a black blot on his record and a wife who, by some strange coincidence, used to be Mr. Grant's fiancée.The brew stirs slowly, as is the way with two-hour shows, tending toward silly romanticism in its dialogue, but moving splendidly whenever the plot's wheels leave the ground and take off over the Andes.Few things, after all, are as exciting as a plane in flames, or the metallic voices of a pilot in a fog-shrouded plane and the chap in the radio room, or a screaming power dive, or the wild downward swoop of a plane taking off from a canyon's rim.Mr. Hawks has staged his flying sequences brilliantly. He has caught the drama in the meeting of a flier and the brother of the man he killed. He has made proper use of the amiable performing talents of Mr. Grant, Miss Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Mr. Barthelmess, Sig Rumann and the rest. But when you add it all up, \"Only Angels Have Wings\" comes to an overly familiar total. It's a fairly good melodrama, nothing more.\n\nONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS, screen play by Jules Furthman based on a story by Howard Hawks; directed and produced by Mr. Hawks for Columbia Pictures.

Pat WestTom Brown, the baby face killer of Universal's \"Ex-Champ,\" hammered his way across the screen of the Palace yesterday to gain the welterweight championship by knocking out the titleholder (a fellow named Olson) in five grueling rounds. Fortunately, the spectator is only permitted to see the first two rounds, for if you can think of anything more ludicrous than Mr. Brown in the role of a pug, you are even more gifted than Universal's fight experts.To our way of thinking the climactic fight scene was delayed too long, for the preceding sequences are weighted down with sentimental folderol. Victor McLaglen, as the former champ, walks through the picture with unmistakable signs of pained resignation, and William Frawley strives earnestly to inject a note of comedy into the banal dialogue. As for Mr. Brown, well, he's just not the type.\n\nAt the PalaceEX-CHAMP, from a story by Gordon Kahn; directed by Phil Rosen and produced by Burt Kelly for Universal.Gunner Grey . . . . .

Kid ChissellWith admirable consideration for the intellects of the Russian people, the Soviet film-makers began several years ago a series of motion pictures which would trace the development of the bolshevist revolution through the revolutionary development of one man. They called their hero Maxim; and the first of the series—\"The Youth of Maxim,\" which was shown here in 1935—was a strong and stirring documentation of one ignorant worker's life in Czarist Russia and his first discovery of the proletarian ideal.In the second of the series—\"The Return of Maxim,\" shown here in 1937—the hero had become more fully aware of the things for which he was fighting and pursued them with more serious intent and with considerable cinematic effect.But in \"New Horizons,\" the third in this seemingly \"to be continued\" series, which is now showing at the Cameo, it appears that our old friend Maxim is becoming just a shade swell-headed and the Russian revolution, still to be fully realized, is developing into a triumphal snake-dance. To put it bluntly, \"New Horizons\" is a let-down from its predecessors.This time—about 1918—Maxim is placed in charge of the government bank; his girl friend, Natasha, is made chairman of the Vyborg district Soviet in Petrograd, and together they shout or glare their way, along with an assortment of clowning companions, through a counter-revolutionary intrigue and the opposition of some farcical bourgeois stuffed-shirts.The whole picture is conceived in a vein which seems pure burlesque to the impartial observer, and the only real dramatic sequences are those devoted to the pathetic confusions of a poor, ignorant woman who has been used as a tool by the counter-revolutionaries.Boris Chirkov, again playing Maxim, leads a cast of distinguished Soviet performers in over-acting their roles—especially in moments of triumph. It is a tendency to be deplored, for this reporter dares to warn that if Commissar Maxim continues the way he is now going and if history is truly respected, our hero may find himself before a firing squad when the series finally reaches 1937—if it ever does.Benny Fields Heads State BillBenny Fields heads the new stage show at the Loew's State Theatre this week. Sharing the headline honors is Mike Riley and his orchestra. The balance of the program includes the Peggy Taylor Trio, Steve Evans and the Canestrellys in an acrobatic turn.\n\nAt the CameoNEW HORIZONS, A Soviet film, written and directed by Gregory Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg; musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich; produced by Lenfilm.Maxim . . . . .

KuznetsovOwing to inflation brought on by a flood of fiat, or series pictures, causing artistic values to be reckoned on new and lower levels, the reviewer's chief function these days resolves itself into the almost purely mechanical task of numbering the chapters. The most important fact about \"Calling Dr. Kildare\" (at the Capitol), therefore, is that it is Chapter 2 in the Dr. Kildare series, of which last year's \"Young Dr. Kildare\" was the first. Incidentally, it would be a breach of professional etiquette not to make a note of the fact that it is also a pleasantly entertaining production in the vein of light fiction.It is a vein, alas, which has been opened rather too frequently of late, especially by the surgical picture. But the Kildare series approaches its task with such a suavely professional touch, and its graceful bedside badinage is backed, as it were, by the weight of so many expert consultants (the Messrs. Bucquet, Ruskin, Goldbeck and Brand, to name a few) that even medical science is apt to stand in awe at the spectacle. For screen melodrama has seldom if ever been grafted with more hygienic charm upon the slightly forbidding carcass of materia medica than it is in the likeable Kildare series—the Hardy Family of hospital pictures.In the current chapter Lew Ayres continues his interneship under the ornery but golden-hearted tutelage of old Dr. Lionel Barrymore, who could be jailed for the reckless way he drives a wheel chair. And since being an interne involves such glamorous contacts as Lana Turner, the gunman's girl, and Laraine Day, the lovely nurse, it is hardly surprising that Lew sticks to Aesculapius like a leech, even when the old doctor farms him out to a neighborhood clinic, to teach the young sprout to mix common sense with his prescriptions. Medicine is getting harder and harder to take in the films, but \"Kildare\" has been, on the whole, successfully sugar-coated."
