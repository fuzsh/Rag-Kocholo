        "text": "Leonid Zakharovich Trauberg is Soviet film director and screenwriter. People's Artist of the RSFSR (1987). Leonid Trauberg was born in Odessa. After moving to Petrograd, the family settled in house number 7, apt. 4, along Kolomenskaya street.\n\nIn December 1921, together with Grigoriy Kozintsev and G. Kryzhitskiy, he wrote the \"Eccentric Theater Manifesto,\" which was proclaimed at a debate organized by them. In 1922, Kozintsev and Trauberg organized the Theater Workshop \"Factory of an Eccentric Actor\", and in the same year they put in it an eccentric reworking of \"Marriage\" by Nikolay Gogol. For two years, they staged 3 more plays based on their own plays, and in 1924 they transferred their experiments in the field of eccentric comedy to cinema, transforming the theater workshop into the FEKS Film Workshop.\n\nThe first full-length film by Kozintsev and Trauberg - the romantic melodrama Chyortovo koleso (1926) according to the script of Adrian Piotrovsky - was already a mature work. Love for a bright eccentric was combined with a convincing display of urban life. This film has a permanent creative team; in addition to the directors, it included cameraman Andrey Moskvin and artist Yevgeni Yenej, who worked with Kozintsev in almost all of his films.\n\nIn 1926-1932, Leonid Trauberg taught at the Leningrad Institute of Performing Arts, in 1926-1927 he was the head of the film department of the Leningrad Theater Institute. In 1961-1965 he taught at the VKSR under the Goskino USSR."
