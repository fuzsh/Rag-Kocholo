        "text": "Shinel by Kozintsev & Trauberg is one of the earliest screen adaptation of the famous novel by Nikolai Gogol of the same name. If follows the story rather close to the source: a minor state official Akaki Akakievich Bashmachkin, who was very poor all his life and never had that much of an ambition. At some point he noticed that his old overcoat got worn out; he took to a tailor, but the tailor refused to mend it, because it was too far gone. Instead he offered Bashmachkin to sew him a new one, but that was too expensive – Akaki Akakievich didn’t have the necessary sum at the moment. He started saving up, which, considering his low salary, should’ve taken him a long time, but then he got a bonus that was higher than expected, and so he ordered the new overcoat. But, soon after he got it from the tailor, he got robbed. Neither the police, nor his fellow state officials cared very much, so he got nowhere asking them for help. And because it was winter time, he caught a cold and died soon afterwards. Such was his miserable, pathetic fate.\n\nThe story is relatively readable, which is not always the case with silent cinema; some scenes could’ve been more clear, but all in all it’s quite understandable.\n\nApart from slight exaggeration of the detestabilitiy of the higher rank state officials, the film does not contain any distortions so characteristic to soviet cinema, which makes it more or less watchable.\n\nThe film, however, is a typical silent movie, with theatrical, overly expressive acting and questionable stage settings.\n\nPerhaps, one can say that it is a novel work of cinema, because it has employed and, probably, worked out some of the movie making techniques that haven’t existed before. But I don’t see it as a virtue; I believe, that to be considered outstanding the film must offer something more than just some progress of the technical means – it must have the pure essence of the story. And with Shinel it’s a problem: after watching the film I find myself completely at a loss as to why this story has been written in the first place, for it is extremely depressing and sad. The directors failed to reproduce the humor of the original, and stripped it of most of its context.\n\nAll in all, this film might be interesting only to the students of cinema. In and of itself it’s barely watchable."
