        "text": "On GERASIMOV: articlesâ€”\n\nVronskaya, J., \"Recent Russian Cinema,\" in Film (London), Summer 1971.\n\n\"Sergei Gerasimov,\" in Soviet Film (Moscow), no. 261, 1979.\n\nObituary in Variety (New York), 4 December 1985.\n\nWuss-Mundeciema, L., Sergei Gerassimow, and H.-J. Rother, \"In memoriam Sergej Gerassimow,\" in Film un Fernsehen (Frankfurt), vol. 14, no. 6, June 1986.\n\nObituary in Soviet Film (Moscow), no. 6, 1987.\n\n* * *\n\nThe very survival of the brilliant, original, almost iconoclastic Sergei Gerasimov through turbulent eras of Soviet history has tended to obscure the importance of his early contributions to cinema. The somewhat stern image of a grim conservative headmaster he seemed to project to students at the Moscow Film School (VGIK) in the early 1970s was an antithesis of his prewar self.\n\nGerasimov's career started in Leningrad when, after graduating as a theatrical designer, he joined the \"Factory of Eccentric Actors\" (FEKS). He became one of the strongest and most original actors in Soviet silent cinema, with a special attraction to complex roles. Together with what he learned from Kozintsev and Trauberg, who directed most of the productions in which he appeared, his deep study of acting was an important part of Gerasimov's apprenticeship as a filmmaker.\n\nGerasimov cut his directorial teeth on three silent productions in the early 1930s, but it was not until 1936, with his first sound film Semero Smelykh ( The Bold 7 ), that came into his own as a major talent. In this and his next film ( Komsomolsk ) he broke new ground in his choice of subject and in his sincere and unusually successful attempt to portray ordinary young people as varied, breathing, living human beings rather than animated heroic sculptures. His sympathetic direction of his young cast, together with his romantic but naturalistic scripts (pitting teams of young people against the elements) achieved something approaching the elusive ideal of socialist realism.\n\nGerasimov's works were by far the most successful films of their genre during the 1930s. Uchitel ( Teacher ), released in 1939, completed his trio of lyrical but unpretentious evocations of the new Soviet generation in the Russian countryside. Uchitel told the tale of a young man who leaves the bright lights of the city to return to his native village as a schoolmaster. This film begins, perhaps, to show some signs of the stress imposed by the increasing rigidity of official dogma, for it does not achieve the freshness of the previous two films. Yet, sadly, some seven years later Gerasimov castigated himself for not having adhered more strictly to the party line. \"I loved the film,\" he wrote, \"and I still love it, despite the fact that it is far too polished . . . and not a little too obsequious in its attitude to Art.\" By this time the war had intervened and Gerasimov (in 1944) had become a member of the Communist Party.\n\nBesides Gerasimov's rural trilogy, his only other prewar feature, Masquerade , was a lavish version of Lermontov's verse tragedy. He had certainly set himself an uphill task in trying to combine his FEKS style with the tradition of stage drama and dialogue in verse, although his own performance as \"The Stranger\" was an echo of his old FEKS philosophy and the Leningrad setting was spectacular. Although successful at the time, the film was criticized by the director himself, a stern exponent of \"socialist self-criticism.\" While he admitted that the film had helped him \"refine his art,\" he considered it \"haphazard and unplanned\" and lacking sufficient appreciation of Lermontov's particular genius.\n\nDuring World War II, Gerasimov was put in charge of the documentary film studios. There he brought together the talents of feature directors and documentarists and once more proved his flair for encouraging good work from others. This led to his appointment in 1944 as head of the directing and acting workshops of the Moscow Film School (VGIK). Occupying this seminal position through the following thirty years, he had an enormous influence on the whole present generation of Soviet filmmakers."
