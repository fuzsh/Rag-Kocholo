The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis. The Fourier series is named in honour of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830), who made important contributions to the study of trigonometric series, after preliminary investigations by Leonhard Euler, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and Daniel Bernoulli.[1] Fourier introduced the series for the purpose of solving the heat equation in a metal plate, publishing his initial results in his 1807 Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides (Treatise on the propagation of heat in solid bodies), and publishing his Théorie analytique de la chaleur in 1822. Early ideas of decomposing a periodic function into the sum of simple oscillating functions date back to the 3rd century BC, when ancient astronomers proposed an empiric model of planetary motions, based on deferents and epicycles. The heat equation is a partial differential equation. Prior to Fourier's work, no solution to the heat equation was known in the general case, The first four partial sums of the Fourier series although particular solutions were known if the heat source behaved in for a square wave a simple way, in particular, if the heat source was a sine or cosine wave. These simple solutions are now sometimes called eigensolutions. Fourier's idea was to model a complicated heat source as a superposition (or linear combination) of simple sine and cosine waves, and to write the solution as a superposition of the corresponding eigensolutions. This superposition or linear combination is called the Fourier series. From a modern point of view, Fourier's results are somewhat informal, due to the lack of a precise notion of function and integral in the early nineteenth century. Later, Dirichlet[2] and Riemann[3][4][5] expressed Fourier's results with greater precision and formality. Although the original motivation was to solve the heat equation, it later became obvious that the same techniques could be applied to a wide array of mathematical and physical problems, and especially those involving linear differential equations with constant coefficients, for which the eigensolutions are sinusoids. The Fourier series has many such applications in electrical engineering, vibration analysis, acoustics, optics, signal processing, image processing, quantum mechanics, econometrics,[6] thin-walled shell theory,[7] etc.\n\nRevolutionary article\n\n“\n\nMultiplying both sides by\n\n, and then integrating from\n\nto\n\n”\n\nyields:\n\n[8][9]\n\n—Joseph Fourier, Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides. (1807)\n\nFourier series\n\n2\n\nThis immediately gives any coefficient ak of the trigonometrical series for φ(y) for any function which has such an expansion. It works because if φ has such an expansion, then (under suitable convergence assumptions) the integral\n\ncan be carried out term-by-term. But all terms involving\n\nfor j ≠ k vanish when\n\nintegrated from −1 to 1, leaving only the kth term. In these few lines, which are close to the modern formalism used in Fourier series, Fourier revolutionized both mathematics and physics. Although similar trigonometric series were previously used by Euler, d'Alembert, Daniel Bernoulli and Gauss, Fourier believed that such trigonometric series could represent any arbitrary function. In what sense that is actually true is a somewhat subtle issue and the attempts over many years to clarify this idea have led to important discoveries in the theories of convergence, function spaces, and harmonic analysis. When Fourier submitted a later competition essay in 1811, the committee (which included Lagrange, Laplace, Malus and Legendre, among others) concluded: ...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and...his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour.\n\nBirth of harmonic analysis Since Fourier's time, many different approaches to defining and understanding the concept of Fourier series have been discovered, all of which are consistent with one another, but each of which emphasizes different aspects of the topic. Some of the more powerful and elegant approaches are based on mathematical ideas and tools that were not available at the time Fourier completed his original work. Fourier originally defined the Fourier series for real-valued functions of real arguments, and using the sine and cosine functions as the basis set for the decomposition. Many other Fourier-related transforms have since been defined, extending the initial idea to other applications. This general area of inquiry is now sometimes called harmonic analysis. A Fourier series, however, can be used only for periodic functions, or for functions on a bounded (compact) interval.\n\nDefinition In this section, f(x) denotes a function of the real variable x. This function is usually taken to be periodic, of period 2π, which is to say that f(x + 2π) = f(x), for all real numbers x. We will attempt to write such a function as an infinite sum, or series of simpler 2π–periodic functions. We will start by using an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions on the interval [−π, π], as Fourier did (see the quote above), and we will then discuss different formulations and generalizations.\n\nFourier series\n\n3\n\nFourier's formula for 2π-periodic functions using sines and cosines For a periodic function f(x) that is integrable on [−π, π], the numbers\n\nare called the Fourier coefficients of f. One introduces the partial sums of the Fourier series for f, often denoted by\n\nThe partial sums for f are trigonometric polynomials. One expects that the functions SN f approximate the function f, and that the approximation improves as N → ∞. The infinite sum\n\nis called the Fourier series of f. These trigonometric functions can themselves be expanded, using multiple angle formulae. The Fourier series does not always converge, and even when it does converge for a specific value x0 of x, the sum of the series at x0 may differ from the value f(x0) of the function. It is one of the main questions in harmonic analysis to decide when Fourier series converge, and when the sum is equal to the original function. If a function is square-integrable on the interval [−π, π], then the Fourier series converges to the function at almost every point. In engineering applications, the Fourier series is generally presumed to converge everywhere except at discontinuities, since the functions encountered in engineering are more well behaved than the ones that mathematicians can provide as counter-examples to this presumption. In particular, the Fourier series converges absolutely and uniformly to f(x) whenever the derivative of f(x) (which may not exist everywhere) is square integrable.[10] See Convergence of Fourier series. It is possible to define Fourier coefficients for more general functions or distributions, in such cases convergence in norm or weak convergence is usually of interest. Example 1: a simple Fourier series We now use the formula above to give a Fourier series expansion of a very simple function. Consider a sawtooth wave\n\nIn this case, the Fourier coefficients are given by\n\nPlot of a periodic identity function—a sawtooth wave\n\nAnimated plot of the first five successive partial Fourier series\n\nFourier series\n\n4\n\nIt can be proven that the Fourier series converges to f(x) at every point x where f is differentiable, and therefore:\n\n(Eq.1)\n\nWhen x = π, the Fourier series converges to 0, which is the half-sum of the left- and right-limit of f at x = π. This is a particular instance of the Dirichlet theorem for Fourier series. Example 2: Fourier's motivation One notices that the Fourier series expansion of our function in example 1 looks much less simple than the formula f(x) = x, and so it is not immediately apparent why one would need this Fourier series. While there are many applications, we cite Fourier's motivation of solving the heat equation. For example, consider a metal plate in the shape of a square whose side measures π meters, with coordinates (x, y) ∈ [0, π] × [0, π]. If there is no heat source within the plate, and if three of the four sides are held at 0 degrees Celsius, while the fourth side, given by y = π, is maintained at the temperature gradient T(x, π) = x degrees Celsius, for x in (0, π), then one can show that the stationary heat distribution (or the heat distribution after a long period of time has elapsed) is given by\n\nHeat distribution in a metal plate, using Fourier's method\n\nHere, sinh is the hyperbolic sine function. This solution of the heat equation is obtained by multiplying each term of Eq.1 by sinh(ny)/sinh(nπ). While our example function f(x) seems to have a needlessly complicated Fourier series, the heat distribution T(x, y) is nontrivial. The function T cannot be written as a closed-form expression. This method of solving the heat problem was made possible by Fourier's work.\n\nFourier series Other applications Another application of this Fourier series is to solve the Basel problem by using Parseval's theorem. The example generalizes and one may compute ζ(2n), for any positive integer n.\n\nExponential Fourier series We can use Euler's formula,\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit, to give a more concise formula:\n\nAssuming f(x) is a periodic function with T = 2π, the Fourier coefficients are then given by:\n\nThe Fourier coefficients an, bn, cn are related via\n\nThe notation cn is inadequate for discussing the Fourier coefficients of several different functions. Therefore it is customarily replaced by a modified form of f (in this case), such as or F, and functional notation often replaces subscripting:\n\nIn engineering, particularly when the variable x represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a frequency domain representation. Square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies.\n\nFourier series on a general interval [a, a + τ] The following formula, with appropriate complex-valued coefficients G[n], is a periodic function with period τ on all of R:\n\nIf a function is square-integrable in the interval [a, a + τ], it can be represented in that interval by the formula above. I.e., when the coefficients are derived from a function, h(x), as follows:\n\nthen g(x) will equal h(x) in the interval [a, a + τ]. It follows that if h(x) is τ-periodic, then: • g(x) and h(x) are equal everywhere, except possibly at discontinuities, and • a is an arbitrary choice. Two popular choices are a = 0, and a = −τ/2.\n\n5\n\nFourier series\n\n6\n\nAnother commonly used frequency domain representation uses the Fourier series coefficients to modulate a Dirac comb:\n\nwhere variable f represents a continuous frequency domain. When variable x has units of seconds, f has units of hertz. The \"teeth\" of the comb are spaced at multiples (i.e. harmonics) of 1/τ, which is called the fundamental frequency. g(x) can be recovered from this representation by an inverse Fourier transform:\n\nThe function G(f) is therefore commonly referred to as a Fourier transform, even though the Fourier integral of a periodic function is not convergent at the harmonic frequencies.[11]\n\nFourier series on a square We can also define the Fourier series for functions of two variables x and y in the square [−π, π]×[−π, π]:\n\nAside from being useful for solving partial differential equations such as the heat equation, one notable application of Fourier series on the square is in image compression. In particular, the jpeg image compression standard uses the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, which is a Fourier transform using the cosine basis functions.\n\nFourier series of Bravais-lattice-periodic-function The Bravais lattice is defined as the set of vectors of the form:\n\nwhere ni are integers and ai are three linearly-independent vectors. Assuming we have some function, f(r), such that it obeys the following condition for any Bravais lattice vector R: f(r) = f(r+R), we could make a Fourier series of it. This kind of function can be, for example, the effective potential that one electron \"feels\" inside a periodic crystal. It is useful to make a Fourier series of the potential then when applying Bloch's theorem. First, we may write any arbitrary vector r in the coordinate-system of the lattice:\n\nwhere ai = |ai|. Thus we can define a new function,\n\nThis new function, respectively:\n\n, is now a function of three-variables, each of which has periodicity a1, a2, a3 .\n\nFourier series\n\n7\n\nIf we write a series for g on the interval [0, a1] for x1, we can define the following:\n\nAnd then we could write:\n\nFurther defining:\n\nWe can write g once again as:\n\nAnd finally applying the same for the third coordinate, we define:\n\nAnd write g as:\n\nRe-arranging: . Now, every reciprocal lattice vector can be written as the reciprocal lattice vectors, we can use the fact that\n\n, where li are integers and gi are to calculate that for any arbitrary reciprocal\n\nlattice vector K and arbitrary vector in space r, their scalar product is: . And so it is clear that in our expansion, the sum is actually over reciprocal lattice vectors: . Where\n\nAssuming\n\nwe can solve this system of three linear equations for x, y, and z in terms of x1, x2 and x3 in order to calculate the volume element in the original cartesian coordinate system. Once we have x, y, and z in terms of x1, x2 and x3, we can calculate Jacobian determinant:\n\nWhich after some calculation and applying some non-trivial cross-product identities can be shown to be equal to:\n\nFourier series\n\n8\n\n(it may be advantageous for the sake of simplifying calculations, to work in such a cartesian coordinate system, in which it just so happens that a1 is parallel to the x axis, a2 lies in the x-y plane, and a3 has components of all three axes). The denominator is exactly the volume of the primitive unit cell which is enclosed by the three primitive-vectors a1, a2 and a3. In particular, we now know that\n\nWe can write now h(K) as an integral with the traditional coordinate system over the volume of the primitive cell, instead of with the x1, x2 and x3 variables:\n\nAnd C is the primitive unit cell, thus,\n\nis the volume of the primitive unit cell.\n\nHilbert space interpretation In the language of Hilbert spaces, the set of functions {en = einx; n ∈ Z} is an orthonormal basis for the space L2([−π, π]) of square-integrable functions of [−π, π]. This space is actually a Hilbert space with an inner product given for any two elements f and g by:\n\nThe basic Fourier series result for Hilbert spaces can be written as\n\nThis corresponds exactly to the complex exponential formulation given above. The version with sines and cosines is also justified with the Hilbert space interpretation. Indeed, the sines and cosines form an orthogonal set:\n\n(where δmn is the Kronecker delta), and\n\nSines and cosines form an orthonormal set, as illustrated above. The integral of sine, cosine and their product is zero (green and red areas are equal, and cancel out) when m, n or the functions are different, and pi only if m and n are equal, and the function used is the same.\n\nfurthermore, the sines and cosines are orthogonal to the constant function 1. An orthonormal basis for L2([−π, π]) consisting of real functions is formed by the functions 1, and √2 cos(nx), √2 sin(nx) for n = 1, 2,... The density of their span is a consequence of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, but follows also from the properties of classical kernels like the Fejér kernel.\n\nFourier series\n\n9\n\nProperties We say that f belongs to\n\nif f is a 2π-periodic function on R which is k times differentiable, and its kth\n\nderivative is continuous. • If f is a 2π-periodic odd function, then an = 0 for all n. • If f is a 2π-periodic even function, then bn = 0 for all n. • If f is integrable,\n\n,\n\nand\n\nThis result is known as the\n\nRiemann–Lebesgue lemma. • A doubly infinite sequence {an} in c0(Z) is the sequence of Fourier coefficients of a function in L1([0, 2π]) if and only if it is a convolution of two sequences in . See [12] • If\n\n, then the Fourier coefficients\n\nof the derivative f′ can be expressed in terms of the Fourier\n\ncoefficients • If\n\nof the function f, via the formula , then . In particular, since\n\n. tends to zero, we have that\n\ntends to zero, which means that the Fourier coefficients converge to zero faster than the kth power of n. • Parseval's theorem. If f belongs to L2([−π, π]), then • Plancherel's theorem. If\n\nare coefficients and\n\n. then there is a unique\n\nfunction such that for every n. • The first convolution theorem states that if f and g are in L1([−π, π]), the Fourier series coefficients of the 2π-periodic convolution of f and g are given by: [13]\n\nwhere:\n\n• The second convolution theorem states that the Fourier series coefficients of the product of f and g are given by the discrete convolution of the and sequences:\n\nCompact groups One of the interesting properties of the Fourier transform which we have mentioned, is that it carries convolutions to pointwise products. If that is the property which we seek to preserve, one can produce Fourier series on any compact group. Typical examples include those classical groups that are compact. This generalizes the Fourier transform to all spaces of the form L2(G), where G is a compact group, in such a way that the Fourier transform carries convolutions to pointwise products. The Fourier series exists and converges in similar ways to the [−π, π] case. An alternative extension to compact groups is the Peter–Weyl theorem, which proves results about representations of compact groups analogous to those about finite groups.\n\nFourier series\n\n10\n\nRiemannian manifolds If the domain is not a group, then there is no intrinsically defined convolution. However, if X is a compact Riemannian manifold, it has a Laplace–Beltrami operator. The Laplace–Beltrami operator is the differential operator that corresponds to Laplace operator for the The atomic orbitals of chemistry are spherical Riemannian manifold X. Then, by analogy, one can consider heat harmonics and can be used to produce Fourier equations on X. Since Fourier arrived at his basis by attempting to series on the sphere. solve the heat equation, the natural generalization is to use the eigensolutions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator as a basis. This generalizes Fourier series to spaces of the type L2(X), where X is a Riemannian manifold. The Fourier series converges in ways similar to the [−π, π] case. A typical example is to take X to be the sphere with the usual metric, in which case the Fourier basis consists of spherical harmonics.\n\nLocally compact Abelian groups The generalization to compact groups discussed above does not generalize to noncompact, nonabelian groups. However, there is a straightfoward generalization to Locally Compact Abelian (LCA) groups. This generalizes the Fourier transform to L1(G) or L2(G), where G is an LCA group. If G is compact, one also obtains a Fourier series, which converges similarly to the [−π, π] case, but if G is noncompact, one obtains instead a Fourier integral. This generalization yields the usual Fourier transform when the underlying locally compact Abelian group is R.\n\nApproximation and convergence of Fourier series An important question for the theory as well as applications is that of convergence. In particular, it is often necessary in applications to replace the infinite series\n\nby a finite one,\n\nThis is called a partial sum. We would like to know, in which sense does (SN f)(x) converge to f(x) as N → ∞.\n\nLeast squares property We say that p is a trigonometric polynomial of degree N when it is of the form\n\nNote that SN f is a trigonometric polynomial of degree N. Parseval's theorem implies that Theorem. The trigonometric polynomial SN f is the unique best trigonometric polynomial of degree N approximating f(x), in the sense that, for any trigonometric polynomial p ≠ SN f of degree N, we have where the Hilbert space norm is defined as:\n\nFourier series\n\n11\n\nConvergence Because of the least squares property, and because of the completeness of the Fourier basis, we obtain an elementary convergence result. Theorem. If f belongs to L2([−π, π]), then the Fourier series converges to f in L2([−π, π]), that is, converges to 0 as N → ∞. We have already mentioned that if f is continuously differentiable, then\n\nis the nth Fourier coefficient of the\n\nderivative f′. It follows, essentially from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, that the Fourier series of f is absolutely summable. The sum of this series is a continuous function, equal to f, since the Fourier series converges in the mean to f: Theorem. If\n\n, then the Fourier series converges to f uniformly (and hence also pointwise.)\n\nThis result can be proven easily if f is further assumed to be C2, since in that case\n\ntends to zero as n → ∞.\n\nMore generally, the Fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to f, provided that f satisfies a Hölder condition of order α > ½. In the absolutely summable case, the inequality proves uniform convergence. Many other results concerning the convergence of Fourier series are known, ranging from the moderately simple result that the series converges at x if f is differentiable at x, to Lennart Carleson's much more sophisticated result that the Fourier series of an L2 function actually converges almost everywhere. These theorems, and informal variations of them that don't specify the convergence conditions, are sometimes referred to generically as \"Fourier's theorem\" or \"the Fourier theorem\".[14][15][16][17]\n\nDivergence Since Fourier series have such good convergence properties, many are often surprised by some of the negative results. For example, the Fourier series of a continuous T-periodic function need not converge pointwise. The uniform boundedness principle yields a simple non-constructive proof of this fact. In 1922, Andrey Kolmogorov published an article entitled \"Une série de Fourier-Lebesgue divergente presque partout\" in which he gave an example of a Lebesgue-integrable function whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. He later constructed an example of an integrable function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere (Katznelson 1976).\n\nNotes [1] These three did some important early work on the wave equation, especially D'Alembert. Euler's work in this area was mostly comtemporaneous/ in collaboration with Bernoulli, although the latter made some independent contributions to the theory of waves and vibrations ( see here, pg.s 209 & 210, (http:/ / books. google. co. uk/ books?id=olMpStYOlnoC& pg=PA214& lpg=PA214& dq=bernoulli+ solution+ wave+ equation& source=bl& ots=h8eN69CWRm& sig=lRq2-8FZvcXIjToXQI4k6AVfRqA& hl=en& sa=X& ei=RqOhUIHOIOa00QWZuIHgCw& ved=0CCEQ6AEwATg8#v=onepage& q=bernoulli solution wave equation& f=false)).

It concerns construction of an angle equal to one-third of a given arbitrary angle, using only two tools: an un-marked straightedge, and a compass. The problem as stated is generally impossible to solve, as shown by Pierre Wantzel (1837). Wantzel's proof relies on ideas from the field of Galois theory—in particular, trisection of an angle corresponds to the solution of a certain cubic equation, which is not possible using the given tools. Note that the fact that there is no way to trisect an angle in general with just a compass and a straightedge does not mean that it is impossible to trisect all angles: for example, it is relatively straightforward to trisect a right angle (that is, to construct an angle of measure 30 degrees).\n\nAngles may be trisected via a Neusis construction, but this uses tools outside the Greek framework of an unmarked straightedge and a compass.\n\nIt is, however, possible to trisect an arbitrary angle, but using tools other than straightedge and compass. For example, neusis construction, also known to ancient Greeks, involves simultaneous sliding and rotation of a marked straightedge, which can not be achieved with the original tools. Other techniques were developed by mathematicians over centuries. Because it is defined in simple terms, but complex to prove unsolvable, the problem of angle trisection is a frequent subject of pseudomathematical attempts at solution by naive enthusiasts. The \"solutions\" often involve finding loopholes in the rules, or are simply incorrect.[1]\n\nBackground and problem statement Using only an unmarked straightedge and a compass, Greek mathematicians found means to divide a line into an arbitrary set of equal segments, to draw parallel lines, to bisect angles, to construct many polygons, and to construct squares of equal or twice the area of a given polygon. Three problems proved elusive, specifically, trisecting the angle, doubling the cube, and squaring the circle. The problem of angle trisection reads: Construct an angle equal to one-third of a given arbitrary angle (or divide it into three equal angles), using only two tools: 1. an un-marked straightedge and 2. a compass.\n\nBisection of arbitrary angles has long been solved.\n\nAngle trisection\n\n51\n\nProof of impossibility The problem of constructing an angle of a given measure\n\nis\n\nequivalent to construct two segments such the ratio of their length is because one may pass from one solution to the other by a compass and straightedge construction. It follows that, given a segment that is sought as having a unit length, the problem of angle trisection is equivalent to construct a segment whose length is the root of a cubic polynomial — since by the triple-angle formula, This allows to reduce the Rulers. The displayed ones are marked — an ideal straightedge is un-marked\n\noriginal geometric problem to a purely algebraic problem. One can show that every rational number is constructible and that every irrational number which is constructible in one step from some given numbers is a solution of a polynomial of degree 2 with coefficients in the field generated by these numbers. Therefore any number which is constructible by a series of steps is a root of a minimal polynomial whose degree is a power of 2. Note also that radians (60 degrees, written 60°) is constructible. We now show that it is impossible to construct a 20° angle; this implies that a 60° angle cannot be trisected, and thus that an arbitrary angle cannot be trisected. Denote the set of rational numbers by Q. If 60° could be trisected, the degree of a minimal polynomial of cos(20°) over Q would be a power of two. Now let y = cos(20°). Note that cos(60°) so\n\ncompasses\n\n. Then by the triple-angle formula, . Thus\n\nand\n\n, or equivalently\n\nsubstitute , so that . Let The minimal polynomial for x (hence cos(20°)) is a factor of\n\n. Now\n\n. . Because\n\nis degree 3, if it is reducible\n\nover by Q then it has a rational root. By the rational root theorem, this root must be 1 or −1, but both are clearly not roots. Therefore is irreducible over by Q, and the minimal polynomial for cos(20°) is of degree 3. So an angle of 60° = (1/3)π radians cannot be trisected. Many people (who presumably are unaware of the above result, misunderstand it, or incorrectly reject it) have proposed methods of trisecting the general angle. Some of these methods provide reasonable approximations; others (some of which are mentioned below) involve tools not permitted in the classical problem. The mathematician Underwood Dudley has detailed some of these failed attempts in his book The Trisectors.[2]\n\nAngles which can be trisected However, some angles can be trisected. For example, for any angle\n\n, the angle\n\nignoring the given angle and directly constructing an angle of measure constructible, but are trisectible. For example, angle of measure an angle of measure\n\nis such an angle: five copies of\n\n, which is a full circle plus the desired is trisectible if and only if\n\nangle is constructible if and only\n\nis a Fermat prime.\n\ncan be trivially trisected by\n\n. There are angles which are not combine to make an\n\n. More generally, for a positive integer\n\ndoes not divide\n\n;\n\n[3]\n\nif\n\nis a prime number, this\n\n,\n\nAngle trisection\n\n52\n\nOne general theorem Again, denote the rational numbers Q: Theorem: The angle\n\nmay be trisected if and only if\n\nis reducible over the field\n\nextension Q . The proof is a relatively straightforward generalization of the proof given above that a 60-degree angle is not trisectible.[4]\n\nTrisection using other methods The general problem of angle trisection is solvable, but using additional tools, and thus going outside of the original Greek framework of compass and straightedge.\n\nBy infinite repetition of bisection Trisection can be achieved by infinite repetition of the compass and straightedge method for bisecting an angle. The geometric series 1/3 = 1/4+1/16+1/64+1/256+... or 1/3 = 1/2-1/4+1/8-1/16+... can be used as a basis for the bisections. This method is considered to be breaking the rules for compass and straightedge construction as it involves an infinite number of steps. However, an approximation to any degree of accuracy can be obtained in a finite number of steps.[5]\n\nUsing origami Trisection, like many constructions impossible by ruler and compass, can easily be accomplished by the more powerful (but physically easy) operations of paper folding, or origami. Huzita's axioms (types of folding operations) can construct cubic extensions (cube roots) of given lengths, whereas ruler-and-compass can construct only quadratic extensions (square roots).\n\nWith an auxiliary curve There are certain curves called trisectrices which, if drawn on the plane using other methods, can be used to trisect arbitrary angles.[6]\n\nWith a marked ruler Another means to trisect an arbitrary angle by a \"small\" step outside the Greek framework is via a ruler with two marks a set distance apart. The next construction is originally due to Archimedes, called a Neusis construction, i.e., that uses tools other than an un-marked straightedge. This requires three geometry (at right):\n\nfacts\n\nfrom\n\n1. Any full set of angles on a straight line add to 180°, 2. The sum of angles of any triangle is 180°, and, 3. Any two equal sides of an isosceles triangle will meet the third in the same angle.\n\nAngle trisection\n\n53\n\nAt the diagram at right, angle a (left of point B) is the subject of trisection. First, a point A is drawn at an angle's ray, one unit apart from B. A circle of radius AB is drawn. Then, the markedness of the ruler comes into play: it is \"anchored\" at point A, and slided and rotated until one mark is at point C, and one at point D, i.e., CD = AB. A radius BC is drawn as obvious. That is to say, line segments AB, BC, and CD all have Trisection of the angle using marked ruler equal length. (Segment AC is irrelevant.) Now, Triangles ABC and BCD are isosceles, thus (by Fact 3 above) each has two equal angles. Hypothesis: Given AD is a straight line, and AB, BC, and CD are all equal length, Conclusion: angle\n\n.\n\nProof: 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nFrom Fact 1) above, °.

From Fact 1) above, Clearing,\n\n, or\n\n°. ° °, thus\n\n, so from last, °\n\n°\n\n.\n\n°.\n\n, and the theorem is proved.\n\nAgain, this construction stepped outside the framework of allowed constructions by using a marked straightedge.\n\nWith a string Thomas Hutcheson published an article in the Mathematics Teacher[7] that used a string instead of a compass and straight edge. A string can be used as either a straight edge (by stretching it) or a compass (by fixing one point and identifying another), but can also wrap around a cylinder, the key to Hutcheson's solution. Hutcheson constructed a cylinder from the angle to be trisected by drawing an arc across the angle, completing it as a circle, and constructing from that circle a cylinder on which a, say, equilateral triangle was inscribed (a 360-degree angle divided in three). This was then \"mapped\" onto the angle to be trisected, with a simple proof of similar triangles.\n\nAngle trisection\n\n54\n\nWith a \"tomahawk\" A \"tomahawk\" is a geometric shape consisting of a semicircle and two orthogonal line segments, such that the length of the shorter segment is equal to the circle radius. Trisection is executed by leaning the end of the tomahawk's shorter segment on one ray, the circle's edge on the other, so that the \"handle\" (longer segment) crosses the angle's vertex; the trisection line runs between the vertex and the center of the semicircle. Note that while a tomahawk is constructible with compass and straightedge, it is not generally possible to construct a tomahawk in any desired position. Thus, the above construction does not contradict the nontrisectibility of angles with ruler and compass alone.\n\nA tomahawk trisecting an angle. The handle forms one trisector and the blue line shown forms the other.\n\nWith interconnected compasses An angle can be trisected with a device that is essentially a four-pronged version of a compass, with linkages between the prongs designed to keep the three angles between adjacent prongs equal.[8]\n\nReferences [1] Steven Dutch. \"Why Trisecting the Angle is Impossible\" (http:/ / www. uwgb. edu/ dutchs/ pseudosc/ trisect. htm).

The idealized ruler, known as a straightedge, is assumed to be infinite in length, and has no markings on it and only one edge. The compass is assumed to collapse when lifted from the page, so may not be directly used to transfer distances. (This is an unimportant restriction, as this may be achieved via the compass equivalence theorem.) More formally, the only permissible constructions are those granted by Euclid's first three postulates. Every point constructible using straightedge and compass may be constructed using compass alone. A number of ancient problems in plane geometry impose this restriction.\n\nCreating a regular hexagon with a ruler and compass\n\nThe most famous straightedge-and-compass problems have been proven impossible in several cases by Pierre Wantzel, using the mathematical theory of fields. In spite of existing proofs of impossibility, some persist in trying to solve these problems.[1] Many of these problems are easily solvable provided that other geometric transformations are allowed: for example, doubling the cube is possible using geometric constructions, but not possible using straightedge and compass alone. Mathematician Underwood Dudley has made a sideline of collecting false ruler-and-compass proofs, as well as other work by mathematical cranks, and has collected them into several books. Construction of a regular pentagon\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions\n\n56\n\nCompass and straightedge tools The \"compass\" and \"straightedge\" of compass and straightedge constructions are idealizations of rulers and compasses in the real world: • The compass can be opened arbitrarily wide, but (unlike some real compasses) it has no markings on it. Circles can only be drawn using two existing points which give the centre and a point on the circle. The compass collapses when not used for drawing, it cannot be used to copy a length to another place. • The straightedge is infinitely long, but it has no markings on it and has only one edge, unlike ordinary rulers. It can only be used to draw a line segment between two points or to extend an existing line. The modern compass generally does not collapse and several modern constructions use this feature. It would appear that the modern compass is a \"more powerful\" instrument than the ancient compass. However, by Proposition 2 of Book 1 of Euclid's Elements, no computational power is lost by using such a collapsing compass; there is no need to transfer a distance from one location to another. Although the proposition is correct, its proofs have a long and checkered history.[2]\n\nA compass\n\nEach construction must be exact. \"Eyeballing\" it (essentially looking at the construction and guessing at its accuracy, or using some form of measurement, such as the units of measure on a ruler) and getting close does not count as a solution. Each construction must terminate. That is, it must have a finite number of steps, and not be the limit of ever closer approximations. Stated this way, compass and straightedge constructions appear to be a parlour game, rather than a serious practical problem; but the purpose of the restriction is to ensure that constructions can be proven to be exactly correct, and is thus important to both drafting (design by both CAD software and traditional drafting with pencil, paper, straight-edge and compass) and the science of weights and measures, in which exact synthesis from reference bodies or materials is extremely important. One of the chief purposes of Greek mathematics was to find exact constructions for various lengths; for example, the side of a pentagon inscribed in a given circle. The Greeks could not find constructions for three problems: • Squaring the circle: Drawing a square the same area as a given circle. • Doubling the cube: Drawing a cube with twice the volume of a given cube. • Trisecting the angle: Dividing a given angle into three smaller angles all of the same size. For 2000 years people tried to find constructions within the limits set above, and failed. All three have now been proven under mathematical rules to be impossible generally (angles with certain values can be trisected, but not all possible angles).\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions\n\n57\n\nThe basic constructions All compass and straightedge constructions consist of repeated application of five basic constructions using the points, lines and circles that have already been constructed. These are: • Creating the line through two existing points • Creating the circle through one point with centre another point • Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing, non-parallel lines\n\nThe basic constructions\n\n• Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect) • Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect). For example, starting with just two distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles. If we draw both circles, two new points are created at their intersections. Drawing lines between the two original points and one of these new points completes the construction of an equilateral triangle. Therefore, in any geometric problem we have an initial set of symbols (points and lines), an algorithm, and some results. From this perspective, geometry is equivalent to an axiomatic algebra, replacing its elements by symbols. Probably Gauss first realized this, and used it to prove the impossibility of some constructions; only much later did Hilbert find a complete set of axioms for geometry.\n\nConstructible points and lengths Formal proof There are many different ways to prove something is impossible. A more rigorous proof would be to demarcate the limit of the possible, and show that to solve these problems one must transgress that limit. Much of what can be constructed is covered in intercept theory. We could associate an algebra to our geometry using a Cartesian coordinate Trisecting a segment with ruler and compass. system made of two lines, and represent points of our plane by vectors. Finally we can write these vectors as complex numbers. Using the equations for lines and circles, one can show that the points at which they intersect lie in a quadratic extension of the smallest field F containing two points on the line, the center of the circle, and the radius of the circle. That is, they are of the form , where x, y, and k are in F.\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions Since the field of constructible points is closed under square roots, it contains all points that can be obtained by a finite sequence of quadratic extensions of the field of complex numbers with rational coefficients. By the above paragraph, one can show that any constructible point can be obtained by such a sequence of extensions. As a corollary of this, one finds that the degree of the minimal polynomial for a constructible point (and therefore of any constructible length) is a power of 2. In particular, any constructible point (or length) is an algebraic number, though not every algebraic number is constructible (i.e. the relationship between constructible lengths and algebraic numbers is not bijective); for example, is algebraic but not constructible.\n\nConstructible angles There is a bijection between the angles that are constructible and the points that are constructible on any constructible circle. The angles that are constructible form an abelian group under addition modulo 2π (which corresponds to multiplication of the points on the unit circle viewed as complex numbers). The angles that are constructible are exactly those whose tangent (or equivalently, sine or cosine) is constructible as a number. For example the regular heptadecagon is constructible because\n\nas discovered by Gauss.[3] The group of constructible angles is closed under the operation that halves angles (which corresponds to taking square roots). The only angles of finite order that may be constructed starting with two points are those whose order is either a power of two, or a product of a power of two and a set of distinct Fermat primes. In addition there is a dense set of constructible angles of infinite order.\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions as complex arithmetic Given a set of points in the Euclidean plane, selecting any one of them to be called 0 and another to be called 1, together with an arbitrary choice of orientation allows us to consider the points as a set of complex numbers. Given any such interpretation of a set of points as complex numbers, the points constructible using valid compass and straightedge constructions alone are precisely the elements of the smallest field containing the original set of points and closed under the complex conjugate and square root operations (to avoid ambiguity, we can specify the square root with complex argument less than π). The elements of this field are precisely those that may be expressed as a formula in the original points using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, complex conjugate, and square root, which is easily seen to be a countable dense subset of the plane. Each of these six operations corresponding to a simple compass and straightedge construction. From such a formula it is straightforward to produce a construction of the corresponding point by combining the constructions for each of the arithmetic operations. More efficient constructions of a particular set of points correspond to shortcuts in such calculations. Equivalently (and with no need to arbitrarily choose two points) we can say that, given an arbitrary choice of orientation, a set of points determines a set of complex ratios given by the ratios of the differences between any two pairs of points. The set of ratios constructible using compass and straightedge from such a set of ratios is precisely the smallest field containing the original ratios and closed under taking complex conjugates and square roots. For example the real part, imaginary part and modulus of a point or ratio z (taking one of the two viewpoints above) are constructible as these may be expressed as\n\n58\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions\n\n59\n\nDoubling the cube and trisection of an angle (except for special angles such as any φ such that φ/6π is a rational number with denominator the product of a power of two and a set of distinct Fermat primes) require ratios which are the solution to cubic equations, while squaring the circle requires a transcendental ratio. None of these are in the fields described, hence no compass and straightedge construction for these exists.\n\nImpossible constructions The following three construction problems, whose origins date from Greek antiquity, were considered impossible in the sense that they could not be solved using only the compass and straightedge. With modern mathematical methods this \"consideration\" of the Greek mathematicians can be proved to be correct. The problems themselves, however, are doable, and the Greeks knew how to solve them, without the constraint of working only with straightedge and compass.\n\nSquaring the circle The most famous of these problems, squaring the circle, otherwise known as the quadrature of the circle, involves constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only straightedge and compass. Squaring the circle has been proven impossible, as it involves generating a transcendental number, that is,\n\n.\n\nOnly certain algebraic numbers can be constructed with ruler and compass alone, namely those constructed from the integers with a finite sequence of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots. The phrase \"squaring the circle\" is often used to mean \"doing the impossible\" for this reason. Without the constraint of requiring solution by ruler and compass alone, the problem is easily solvable by a wide variety of geometric and algebraic means, and has been solved many times in antiquity.\n\nDoubling the cube Doubling the cube: using only a straight-edge and compass, construct the side of a cube that has twice the volume of a cube with a given side. This is impossible because the cube root of 2, though algebraic, cannot be computed from integers by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots. This follows because its minimal polynomial over the rationals has degree 3. This construction is possible using a straightedge with two marks on it and a compass.\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions\n\n60\n\nAngle trisection Angle trisection: using only a straightedge and a compass, construct an angle that is one-third of a given arbitrary angle. This is impossible in the general case. For example: though the angle of π/3 radians (60°) cannot be trisected, the angle 2π/5 radians (72° = 360°/5) can be trisected. This problem is also easily solved when a straightedge with two marks on it is allowed (a neusis construction).\n\nConstructing regular polygons Some regular polygons (e.g. a pentagon) are easy to construct with straightedge and compass; others are not. This led to the question: Is it possible to construct all regular polygons with straightedge and compass? Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1796 showed that a regular n-sided polygon can be constructed with straightedge and compass if the odd prime factors of n are distinct Fermat primes. Gauss conjectured that this condition was also necessary, but he offered no proof of this fact, which was provided by Pierre Wantzel in 1837.[4]\n\nConstructing with only ruler or only compass\n\nConstruction of a square.\n\nIt is possible (according to the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem) to construct anything with just a compass if it can be constructed with a ruler and compass, provided that the given data and the data to be found consist of discrete points (not lines or circles). It is impossible to take a square root with just a ruler, so some things that cannot be constructed with a ruler can be constructed with a compass; but (by the Poncelet–Steiner theorem) given a single circle and its center, they can be constructed.\n\nExtended constructions Markable rulers Archimedes and Apollonius gave constructions involving the use of a markable ruler. This would permit them, for example, to take a line segment, two lines (or circles), and a point; and then draw a line which passes through the given point and intersects both lines, and such that the distance between the points of intersection equals the given segment. This the Greeks called neusis (\"inclination\", \"tendency\" or \"verging\"), because the new line tends to the point. In this expanded scheme, any distance whose ratio to an existing distance is the solution of a cubic or a quartic equation is constructible. It follows that, if markable rulers and neusis are permitted, the trisection of the angle (see Archimedes' trisection [5]) and the duplication of the cube can be achieved; the quadrature of the circle is still impossible. Some regular polygons, like the heptagon, become constructible; and John H. Conway gives constructions for several of them;[6] but the 11-sided polygon, the hendecagon, is still impossible, and infinitely many others. When only an angle trisector is permitted, there is a complete description of all regular polygons which can be constructed, including above mentioned regular heptagon, triskaidecagon (13-gon) and enneadecagon (19-gon).[7] It is open whether there are infinitely many primes p for which a regular p-gon is constructible with ruler, compass and an angle trisector.\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions\n\nOrigami The mathematical theory of origami is more powerful than compass and staightedge construction. Folds satisfying the Huzita-Hatori axioms can construct exactly the same set of points as the extended constructions using a compass and a marked ruler. Therefore origami can also be used to solve cubic equations (and hence quartic equations), and thus solve two of the classical problems.[8]\n\nThe extension field In abstract terms, using these more powerful tools of either neusis using a markable ruler or the constructions of origami extends the field of constructible numbers to a larger subfield of the complex numbers, which contains not only the square root, but also the cube roots, of every element. The arithmetic formulae for constructible points described above have analogies in this larger field, allowing formulae that include cube roots as well. The field extension generated by any additional point constructible in this larger field has degree a multiple of a power of two and a power of three, and may be broken into a tower of extensions of degree 2 and 3.\n\nComputation of binary digits In 1998 Simon Plouffe gave a ruler and compass algorithm that can be used to compute binary digits of certain numbers.[9] The algorithm basically involves the repeated doubling of an angle and becomes physically impractical after about 20 binary digits.\n\nReferences [1] Underwood Dudley (1983), \"What To Do When the Trisector Comes\" (http:/ / web. mst. edu/ ~lmhall/ WhatToDoWhenTrisectorComes. pdf), The Mathematical Intelligencer 5 (1): 20–25, [2] Godfried Toussaint, \"A new look at Euclid’s second proposition,\" The Mathematical Intelligencer, Vol. 15, No. 3, (1993), pp. 12-24.

They were first described by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1843[1][2] and applied to mechanics in three-dimensional space. A feature of quaternions is that the product of two quaternions is noncommutative. Hamilton defined a quaternion as the quotient of two directed lines in a three-dimensional space[3] or equivalently as the quotient of two vectors.[4] Quaternions can also be represented as the sum of a scalar and a vector. Quaternions find uses in both theoretical and applied mathematics, in particular for calculations involving three-dimensional rotations such as in three-dimensional computer graphics and computer vision. They can be used alongside other methods, such as Euler angles and rotation matrices, or as an alternative to them depending on the application. In modern mathematical language, quaternions form a four-dimensional associative normed division algebra over the real numbers, and thus also form a domain. In fact, the quaternions were the first noncommutative division algebra to be discovered.[5] The algebra of quaternions is often denoted by H (for Hamilton), or in blackboard bold by H (Unicode U+210D, ℍ). It can also be given by the Clifford algebra classifications Cℓ0,2(R) ≅ Cℓ03,0(R). The algebra H holds a special place in analysis since, according to the Frobenius theorem, it is one of only two finite-dimensional division rings containing the real numbers as a proper subring, the other being the complex numbers. The unit quaternions can therefore be thought of as a choice of a group structure on the 3-sphere S3 that gives the group Spin(3), which is isomorphic to SU(2) and also to the universal cover of SO(3).\n\nQuaternion\n\n63\n\nGraphical representation of quaternion units product as 90°-rotation in 4D-space, ij = k, ji = −k, ij = −ji\n\nHistory Quaternion algebra was introduced by Hamilton in 1843.[6] Important precursors to this work included Euler's four-square identity (1748) and Olinde Rodrigues' parameterization of general rotations by four parameters (1840), but neither of these writers treated the four-parameter rotations as an algebra.[7][8] Carl Friedrich Gauss had also discovered quaternions in 1819, but this work was not published until 1900.[9][10] Hamilton knew that the complex numbers could be interpreted as points in a plane, and he was looking for a way to do the same for points in three-dimensional space. Points in space can be represented by their coordinates, which are triples of numbers, and for many years Hamilton had known how to add and subtract triples of numbers. However, Hamilton had been stuck on the problem of multiplication and division for a long time. He could not figure out how to calculate the quotient of the coordinates of two points in space.\n\nQuaternion plaque on Broom BridgeBrougham (Broom) Bridge, Dublin, which says: Here as he walked byon the 16th of October 1843Sir William Rowan Hamiltonin a flash of genius discoveredthe fundamental formula forquaternion multiplicationi2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1& cut it on a stone of this bridge\n\nThe great breakthrough in quaternions finally came on Monday 16 October 1843 in Dublin, when Hamilton was on his way to the Royal Irish Academy where he was going to preside at a council meeting. While walking along the\n\nQuaternion\n\n64\n\ntowpath of the Royal Canal with his wife, the concepts behind quaternions were taking shape in his mind. When the answer dawned on him, Hamilton could not resist the urge to carve the formula for the quaternions i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1, into the stone of Brougham Bridge as he paused on it. On the following day, Hamilton wrote a letter to his friend and fellow mathematician, John T. Graves, describing the train of thought that led to his discovery. This letter was later published in the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, vol. xxv (1844), pp 489–95. On the letter, Hamilton states, And here there dawned on me the notion that we must admit, in some sense, a fourth dimension of space for the purpose of calculating with triples ... An electric circuit seemed to close, and a spark flashed forth. Hamilton called a quadruple with these rules of multiplication a quaternion, and he devoted most of the remainder of his life to studying and teaching them. Hamilton's treatment is more geometric than the modern approach, which emphasizes quaternions' algebraic properties. He founded a school of \"quaternionists\", and he tried to popularize quaternions in several books. The last and longest of his books, Elements of Quaternions, was 800 pages long; it was published shortly after his death. After Hamilton's death, his student Peter Tait continued promoting quaternions. At this time, quaternions were a mandatory examination topic in Dublin. Topics in physics and geometry that would now be described using vectors, such as kinematics in space and Maxwell's equations, were described entirely in terms of quaternions. There was even a professional research association, the Quaternion Society, devoted to the study of quaternions and other hypercomplex number systems. From the mid-1880s, quaternions began to be displaced by vector analysis, which had been developed by Josiah Willard Gibbs, Oliver Heaviside, and Hermann von Helmholtz. Vector analysis described the same phenomena as quaternions, so it borrowed some ideas and terminology liberally from the literature of quaternions. However, vector analysis was conceptually simpler and notationally cleaner, and eventually quaternions were relegated to a minor role in mathematics and physics. A side-effect of this transition is that Hamilton's work is difficult to comprehend for many modern readers. Hamilton's original definitions are unfamiliar and his writing style was prolix and opaque. However, quaternions have had a revival since the late 20th Century, primarily due to their utility in describing spatial rotations. The representations of rotations by quaternions are more compact and quicker to compute than the representations by matrices. In addition, unlike Euler angles they are not susceptible to gimbal lock. For this reason, quaternions are used in computer graphics,[11] computer vision, robotics, control theory, signal processing, attitude control, physics, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, computer simulations, and orbital mechanics. For example, it is common for the attitude-control systems of spacecraft to be commanded in terms of quaternions. Quaternions have received another boost from number theory because of their relationships with the quadratic forms. Since 1989, the Department of Mathematics of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth has organized a pilgrimage, where scientists (including the physicists Murray Gell-Mann in 2002, Steven Weinberg in 2005, and the mathematician Andrew Wiles in 2003) take a walk from Dunsink Observatory to the Royal Canal bridge. Hamilton's carving is no longer visible.\n\nDefinition As a set, the quaternions H are equal to R4, a four-dimensional vector space over the real numbers. H has three operations: addition, scalar multiplication, and quaternion multiplication. The sum of two elements of H is defined to be their sum as elements of R4. Similarly the product of an element of H by a real number is defined to be the same as the product in R4. To define the product of two elements in H requires a choice of basis for R4. The elements of this basis are customarily denoted as 1, i, j, and k. Every element of H can be uniquely written as a linear combination of these basis elements, that is, as a1 + bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers. The basis element 1 will be the identity element of H, meaning that multiplication by 1 does nothing, and for this reason,\n\nQuaternion\n\n65\n\nelements of H are usually written a + bi + cj + dk, suppressing the basis element 1. Given this basis, associative quaternion multiplication is defined by first defining the products of basis elements and then defining all other products using the distributive law.\n\nMultiplication of basis elements The equations i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1, where i, j, and k are basis elements of H, determine all the possible products of i, j, and k. For example right-multiplying both sides of −1 = ijk by k gives:\n\nAll the other possible products can be determined by similar methods, resulting in\n\nwhich can be expressed as a table whose rows represent the left factor of the product and whose columns represent the right factor, as shown at the top of this article.\n\nHamilton product For two elements a1 + b1i + c1j + d1k and a2 + b2i + c2j + d2k, their Hamilton product (a1 + b1i + c1j + d1k)(a2 + b2i + c2j + d2k) is determined by the products of the basis elements and the distributive law. The distributive law makes it possible to expand the product so that it is a sum of products of basis elements. This gives the following expression:\n\nNow the basis elements can be multiplied using the rules given above to get:[6]\n\nOrdered list form Using the basis 1, i, j, k of H makes it possible to write H as a set of quadruples:\n\nThen the basis elements are:\n\nand the formulas for addition and multiplication are:\n\nQuaternion\n\n66\n\nScalar and vector parts A number of the form a + 0i + 0j + 0k, where a is a real number, is called real, and a number of the form 0 + bi + cj + dk, where b, c, and d are real numbers, and at least one of b, c or d is nonzero, is called pure imaginary. If a + bi + cj + dk is any quaternion, then a is called its scalar part and bi + cj + dk is called its vector part. The scalar part of a quaternion is always real, and the vector part is always pure imaginary. Even though every quaternion is a vector in a four-dimensional vector space, it is common to define a vector to mean a pure imaginary quaternion. With this convention, a vector is the same as an element of the vector space R3. Hamilton called pure imaginary quaternions right quaternions[12][13] and real numbers (considered as quaternions with zero vector part) scalar quaternions. If a quaternion is divided up into a scalar part and a vector part, i.e.\n\nthen the formulas for addition and multiplication are:\n\nwhere \"·\" is the dot product and \"×\" is the cross product.\n\nRemarks Noncommutativity of multiplication\n\nNoncommutativity of quaternion multiplication. × 1\n\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\n1 1\n\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\nk\n\n−j\n\ni\n\ni −1\n\nj\n\nj −k −1\n\nk k\n\nj\n\ni\n\n−i −1\n\nUnlike multiplication of real or complex numbers, multiplication of quaternions is not commutative. For example, ij = k, while ji = −k. The noncommutativity of multiplication has some unexpected consequences, among them that polynomial equations over the quaternions can have more distinct solutions than the degree of the polynomial. The equation z2 + 1 = 0, for instance, has infinitely many quaternion solutions z = bi + cj + dk with b2 + c2 + d2= 1, so that these solutions lie on the two-dimensional surface of a sphere centered on zero in the three-dimensional subspace of quaternions with zero real part. This sphere intersects the complex plane at two points i and −i. The fact that quaternion multiplication is not commutative makes the quaternions an often-cited example of a strictly skew field.\n\nQuaternion Historical impact on physics P.R. Girard’s essay The quaternion group and modern physics[14] discusses some roles of quaternions in physics. It \"shows how various physical covariance groups: SO(3), the Lorentz group, the general relativity group, the Clifford algebra SU(2), and the conformal group can be readily related to the quaternion group\" in modern algebra. Girard began by discussing group representations and by representing some space groups of crystallography. He proceeded to kinematics of rigid body motion. Next he used complex quaternions (biquaternions) to represent the Lorentz group of special relativity, including the Thomas precession. He cited five authors, beginning with Ludwik Silberstein who use a potential function of one quaternion variable to express Maxwell's equations in a single differential equation. Concerning general relativity, he expressed the Runge–Lenz vector. He mentioned the Clifford biquaternions (split-biquaternions) as an instance of Clifford algebra. Finally, invoking the reciprocal of a biquaternion, Girard described conformal maps on spacetime. Among the fifty references, Girard included Alexander Macfarlane and his Bulletin of the Quaternion Society. In 1999 he showed how Einstein's equations of general relativity could be formulated within a Clifford algebra that is directly linked to quaternions.[15] A more personal view of quaternions was written by Joachim Lambek in 1995. He wrote in his essay If Hamilton had prevailed: quaternions in physics: \"My own interest as a graduate student was raised by the inspiring book by Silberstein\". He concluded by stating \"I firmly believe that quaternions can supply a shortcut for pure mathematicians who wish to familiarize themselves with certain aspects of theoretical physics.\"[16] Sums of four squares Quaternions are also used in one of the proofs of Lagrange's four-square theorem in number theory, which states that every nonnegative integer is the sum of four integer squares. As well as being an elegant theorem in its own right, Lagrange's four square theorem has useful applications in areas of mathematics outside number theory, such as combinatorial design theory. The quaternion-based proof uses Hurwitz quaternions, a subring of the ring of all quaternions for which there is an analog of the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nConjugation, the norm, and reciprocal Conjugation of quaternions is analogous to conjugation of complex numbers and to transposition (also known as reversal) of elements of Clifford algebras. To define it, let q = a + bi + cj + dk be a quaternion. The conjugate of q is the quaternion a − bi − cj − dk. It is denoted by q*, q,[6] qt, or . Conjugation is an involution, meaning that it is its own inverse, so conjugating an element twice returns the original element. The conjugate of a product of two quaternions is the product of the conjugates in the reverse order. That is, if p and q are quaternions, then (pq)* = q*p*, not p*q*. Unlike the situation in the complex plane, the conjugation of a quaternion can be expressed entirely with multiplication and addition:\n\nConjugation can be used to extract the scalar and vector parts of a quaternion. The scalar part of p is (p + p*)/2, and the vector part of p is (p − p*)/2. The square root of the product of a quaternion with its conjugate is called its norm and is denoted ||q||. (Hamilton called this quantity the tensor of q, but this conflicts with modern usage. See tensor.) It has the formula\n\nThis is always a non-negative real number, and it is the same as the Euclidean norm on H considered as the vector space R4. Multiplying a quaternion by a real number scales its norm by the absolute value of the number. That is, if α is real, then\n\n67\n\nQuaternion This is a special case of the fact that the norm is multiplicative, meaning that\n\nfor any two quaternions p and q. Multiplicativity is a consequence of the formula for the conjugate of a product. Alternatively it follows from the identity\n\n(where i denotes the usual imaginary unit) and hence from the multiplicative property of determinants of square matrices. This norm makes it possible to define the distance d(p, q) between p and q as the norm of their difference:\n\nThis makes H into a metric space. Addition and multiplication are continuous in the metric topology. A unit quaternion is a quaternion of norm one. Dividing a non-zero quaternion q by its norm produces a unit quaternion Uq called the versor of q:\n\nEvery quaternion has a polar decomposition q = ||q|| Uq. Using conjugation and the norm makes it possible to define the reciprocal of a quaternion. The product of a quaternion with its reciprocal should equal 1, and the considerations above imply that the product of q and q*/||q||2 (in either order) is 1. So the reciprocal of q is defined to be\n\nThis makes it possible to divide two quaternions p and q in two different ways. That is, their quotient can be either p q −1 or q −1 p. The notation pq is ambiguous because it does not specify whether q divides on the left or the right.\n\nAlgebraic properties The set H of all quaternions is a vector space over the real numbers with dimension 4. (In comparison, the real numbers have dimension 1, the complex numbers have dimension 2, and the octonions have dimension 8.) The quaternions have a multiplication that is associative and that distributes over vector addition, but which is not commutative. Therefore the quaternions H are a non-commutative associative algebra over the real numbers. Even though H contains copies of the complex numbers, it is not an associative algebra over the complex numbers. Because it is possible to divide quaternions, they form a division algebra. This is a structure similar to a field except for the commutativity of multiplication. Finite-dimensional associative Cayley graph of Q8. The red arrows represent division algebras over the real numbers are very rare. The Frobenius multiplication on the right by i, and the green theorem states that there are exactly three: R, C, and H. The norm arrows represent multiplication on the right by j. makes the quaternions into a normed algebra, and normed division algebras over the reals are also very rare: Hurwitz's theorem says that there are only four: R, C, H, and O (the octonions). The quaternions are also an example of a composition algebra and of a unital Banach algebra. Because the product of any two basis vectors is plus or minus another basis vector, the set {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} forms a group under multiplication. This group is called the quaternion group and is denoted Q8.[17] The real group ring of\n\n68\n\nQuaternion\n\n69\n\nQ8 is a ring R[Q8] which is also an eight-dimensional vector space over R. It has one basis vector for each element of Q8. The quaternions are the quotient ring of RQ8 by the ideal generated by the elements 1 + (−1), i + (−i), j + (−j), and k + (−k). Here the first term in each of the differences is one of the basis elements 1, i, j, and k, and the second term is one of basis elements −1, −i, −j, and −k, not the additive inverses of 1, i, j, and k.\n\nQuaternions and the geometry of R3 Because the vector part of a quaternion is a vector in R3, the geometry of R3 is reflected in the algebraic structure of the quaternions. Many operations on vectors can be defined in terms of quaternions, and this makes it possible to apply quaternion techniques wherever spatial vectors arise. For instance, this is true in electrodynamics and 3D computer graphics. For the remainder of this section, i, j, and k will denote both imaginary[18] basis vectors of H and a basis for R3. Notice that replacing i by −i, j by −j, and k by −k sends a vector to its additive inverse, so the additive inverse of a vector is the same as its conjugate as a quaternion. For this reason, conjugation is sometimes called the spatial inverse. Choose two imaginary quaternions p = b1i + c1j + d1k and q = b2i + c2j + d2k. Their dot product is This is equal to the scalar parts of p*q, qp*, pq*, and q*p. (Note that the vector parts of these four products are different.) It also has the formulas\n\nThe cross product of p and q relative to the orientation determined by the ordered basis i, j, and k is\n\n(Recall that the orientation is necessary to determine the sign.) This is equal to the vector part of the product pq (as quaternions), as well as the vector part of −q*p*. It also has the formula\n\nIn general, let p and q be quaternions (possibly non-imaginary), and write\n\nwhere ps and qs are the scalar parts, and\n\nand\n\nare the vector parts of p and q. Then we have the formula\n\nThis shows that the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication comes from the multiplication of pure imaginary quaternions. It also shows that two quaternions commute if and only if their vector parts are collinear. For further elaboration on modeling three-dimensional vectors using quaternions, see quaternions and spatial rotation.\n\nMatrix representations Just as complex numbers can be represented as matrices, so can quaternions. There are at least two ways of representing quaternions as matrices in such a way that quaternion addition and multiplication correspond to matrix addition and matrix multiplication. One is to use 2×2 complex matrices, and the other is to use 4×4 real matrices. In each case, the representation given is one of a family of linearly related representations. In the terminology of abstract algebra, these are injective homomorphisms from H to the matrix rings M(2, C) and M(4, R), respectively. Using 2×2 complex matrices, the quaternion a + bi + cj + dk can be represented as\n\nQuaternion\n\nThis representation has the following properties: • Complex numbers (c = d = 0) correspond to diagonal matrices. • The norm of a quaternion (the square root of a product with its conjugate, as with complex numbers) is the square root of the determinant of the corresponding matrix.[19] • The conjugate of a quaternion corresponds to the conjugate transpose of the matrix. • Restricted to unit quaternions, this representation provides an isomorphism between S3 and SU(2). The latter group is important for describing spin in quantum mechanics; see Pauli matrices. Using 4×4 real matrices, that same quaternion can be written as\n\nIn this representation, the conjugate of a quaternion corresponds to the transpose of the matrix. The fourth power of the norm of a quaternion is the determinant of the corresponding matrix. Complex numbers are block diagonal matrices with two 2×2 blocks.\n\nQuaternions as pairs of complex numbers Quaternions can be represented as pairs of complex numbers. From this perspective, quaternions are the result of applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the complex numbers. This is a generalization of the construction of the complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. Let C2 be a two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers. Choose a basis consisting of two elements 1 and j. A vector in C2 can be written in terms of the basis elements 1 and j as If we define j2 = −1 and ij = −ji, then we can multiply two vectors using the distributive law. Writing k in place of the product ij leads to the same rules for multiplication as the usual quaternions. Therefore the above vector of complex numbers corresponds to the quaternion a + bi + cj + dk. If we write the elements of C2 as ordered pairs and quaternions as quadruples, then the correspondence is\n\nSquare roots of −1 In the complex numbers, there are just two numbers, i and −i, whose square is −1 . In H there are infinitely many square roots of minus one: the quaternion solution for the square root of −1 is the surface of the unit sphere in 3-space. To see this, let q = a + bi + cj + dk be a quaternion, and assume that its square is −1. In terms of a, b, c, and d, this means\n\nTo satisfy the last three equations, either a = 0 or b, c, and d are all 0. The latter is impossible because a is a real number and the first equation would imply that a2 = −1. Therefore a = 0 and b2 + c2 + d2 = 1. In other words, a quaternion squares to −1 if and only if it is a vector (that is, pure imaginary) with norm 1. By definition, the set of all such vectors forms the unit sphere.\n\n70\n\nQuaternion\n\n71\n\nOnly negative real quaternions have an infinite number of square roots. All others have just two (or one in the case of 0). The identification of the square roots of minus one in H was given by Hamilton[20] but was frequently omitted in other texts. By 1971 the sphere was included by Sam Perlis in his three page exposition included in Historical Topics in Algebra (page 39) published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. More recently, the sphere of square roots of minus one is described in Ian R. Porteous's book Clifford Algebras and the Classical Groups (Cambridge, 1995) in proposition 8.13 on page 60. Also in Conway (2003) On Quaternions and Octonions we read on page 40: \"any imaginary unit may be called i, and perpendicular one j, and their product k\", another statement of the sphere.\n\nH as a union of complex planes Each pair of square roots of −1 creates a distinct copy of the complex numbers inside the quaternions. If q2 = −1, then the copy is determined by the function\n\nIn the language of abstract algebra, each is an injective ring homomorphism from C to H. The images of the embeddings corresponding to q and −q are identical. Every non-real quaternion lies in a subspace of H isomorphic to C. Write q as the sum of its scalar part and its vector part:\n\nDecompose the vector part further as the product of its norm and its versor:\n\n(Note that this is not the same as\n\n.) The versor of the vector part of q,\n\n, is a pure imaginary\n\nunit quaternion, so its square is −1. Therefore it determines a copy of the complex numbers by the function Under this function, q is the image of the complex number\n\n. Thus H is the union of complex planes\n\nintersecting in a common real line, where the union is taken over the sphere of square roots of minus one, bearing in mind that the same plane is associated with the antipodal points of the sphere.\n\nCommutative subrings The relationship of quaternions to each other within the complex subplanes of H can also be identified and expressed in terms of commutative subrings. Specifically, since two quaternions p and q commute (pq = qp) only if they lie in the same complex subplane of H, the profile of H as a union of complex planes arises when one seeks to find all commutative subrings of the quaternion ring. This method of commutative subrings is also used to profile the coquaternions and 2 × 2 real matrices.\n\nQuaternion\n\n72\n\nFunctions of a quaternion variable Like functions of a complex variable, functions of a quaternion variable suggest useful physical models. For example, the original electric and magnetic fields described by Maxwell were functions of a quaternion variable.\n\nExponential, logarithm, and power Given a quaternion, q = a + bi + cj + dk = a + v, the exponential is computed as\n\nand .[21] It follows that the polar decomposition of a quaternion may be written\n\nwhere the angle θ and the unit vector\n\nare defined by:\n\nand\n\nAny unit quaternion may be expressed in polar form as\n\n.\n\nThe power of a quaternion raised to an arbitrary (real) exponent is given by:\n\nThree-dimensional and four-dimensional rotation groups The term \"conjugation\", besides the meaning given above, can also mean taking an element a to rar−1 where r is some non-zero element (quaternion). All elements that are conjugate to a given element (in this sense of the word conjugate) have the same real part and the same norm of the vector part. (Thus the conjugate in the other sense is one of the conjugates in this sense.) Thus the multiplicative group of non-zero quaternions acts by conjugation on the copy of R3 consisting of quaternions with real part equal to zero. Conjugation by a unit quaternion (a quaternion of absolute value 1) with real part cos(θ) is a rotation by an angle 2θ, the axis of the rotation being the direction of the imaginary part. The advantages of quaternions are: 1. Nonsingular representation (compared with Euler angles for example). 2. More compact (and faster) than matrices. 3. Pairs of unit quaternions represent a rotation in 4D space (see Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space: Algebra of 4D rotations). The set of all unit quaternions (versors) forms a 3-dimensional sphere S3 and a group (a Lie group) under multiplication, double covering the group SO(3, R) of real orthogonal 3×3 matrices of determinant 1 since two unit quaternions correspond to every rotation under the above correspondence. The image of a subgroup of versors is a point group, and conversely, the preimage of a point group is a subgroup of versors. The preimage of a finite point group is called by the same name, with the prefix binary. For instance, the preimage of the icosahedral group is the binary icosahedral group.\n\nQuaternion The versors' group is isomorphic to SU(2), the group of complex unitary 2×2 matrices of determinant 1. Let A be the set of quaternions of the form a + bi + cj + dk where a, b, c, and d are either all integers or all rational numbers with odd numerator and denominator 2. The set A is a ring (in fact a domain) and a lattice and is called the ring of Hurwitz quaternions. There are 24 unit quaternions in this ring, and they are the vertices of a 24-cell regular polytope with Schläfli symbol {3,4,3}.\n\nGeneralizations If F is any field with characteristic different from 2, and a and b are elements of F, one may define a four-dimensional unitary associative algebra over F with basis 1, i, j, and ij, where i2 = a, j2 = b and ij = −ji (so (ij)2 = −ab). These algebras are called quaternion algebras and are isomorphic to the algebra of 2×2 matrices over F or form division algebras over F, depending on the choice of a and b.\n\nQuaternions as the even part of Cℓ3,0(R) The usefulness of quaternions for geometrical computations can be generalised to other dimensions, by identifying the quaternions as the even part Cℓ+3,0(R) of the Clifford algebra Cℓ3,0(R). This is an associative multivector algebra built up from fundamental basis elements σ1, σ2, σ3 using the product rules\n\nIf these fundamental basis elements are taken to represent vectors in 3D space, then it turns out that the reflection of a vector r in a plane perpendicular to a unit vector w can be written:\n\nTwo reflections make a rotation by an angle twice the angle between the two reflection planes, so\n\ncorresponds to a rotation of 180° in the plane containing σ1 and σ2. This is very similar to the corresponding quaternion formula,\n\nIn fact, the two are identical, if we make the identification\n\nand it is straightforward to confirm that this preserves the Hamilton relations\n\nIn this picture, quaternions correspond not to vectors but to bivectors, quantities with magnitude and orientations associated with particular 2D planes rather than 1D directions. The relation to complex numbers becomes clearer, too: in 2D, with two vector directions σ1 and σ2, there is only one bivector basis element σ1σ2, so only one imaginary. But in 3D, with three vector directions, there are three bivector basis elements σ1σ2, σ2σ3, σ3σ1, so three imaginaries. This reasoning extends further. In the Clifford algebra Cℓ4,0(R), there are six bivector basis elements, since with four different basic vector directions, six different pairs and therefore six different linearly independent planes can be defined. Rotations in such spaces using these generalisations of quaternions, called rotors, can be very useful for applications involving homogeneous coordinates. But it is only in 3D that the number of basis bivectors equals the number of basis vectors, and each bivector can be identified as a pseudovector. Dorst et al. identify the following advantages for placing quaternions in this wider setting:[22] • Rotors are natural and non-mysterious in geometric algebra and easily understood as the encoding of a double reflection.\n\n73\n\nQuaternion • In geometric algebra, a rotor and the objects it acts on live in the same space. This eliminates the need to change representations and to encode new data structures and methods (which is required when augmenting linear algebra with quaternions). • A rotor is universally applicable to any element of the algebra, not just vectors and other quaternions, but also lines, planes, circles, spheres, rays, and so on. • In the conformal model of Euclidean geometry, rotors allow the encoding of rotation, translation and scaling in a single element of the algebra, universally acting on any element. In particular, this means that rotors can represent rotations around an arbitrary axis, whereas quaternions are limited to an axis through the origin. • Rotor-encoded transformations make interpolation particularly straightforward.

Explicitly, the Brauer group of the reals consists of two classes, represented by the reals and the quaternions, where the Brauer group is the set of all CSAs, up to equivalence relation of one CSA being a matrix ring over another. By the Artin–Wedderburn theorem (specifically, Wedderburn's part), CSAs are all matrix algebras over a division algebra, and thus the quaternions are the only non-trivial division algebra over the reals. CSAs – rings over a field, which are simple algebras (have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, just as with fields) whose center is exactly the field – are a noncommutative analog of extension fields, and are more restrictive than general ring extensions. The fact that the quaternions are the only non-trivial CSA over the reals (up to equivalence) may be compared with the fact that the complex numbers are the only non-trivial field extension of the reals.\n\nQuotes • \"I regard it as an inelegance, or imperfection, in quaternions, or rather in the state to which it has been hitherto unfolded, whenever it becomes or seems to become necessary to have recourse to x, y, z, etc.\" — William Rowan Hamilton (ed. Quoted in a letter from Tait to Cayley). • \"Time is said to have only one dimension, and space to have three dimensions. […] The mathematical quaternion partakes of both these elements; in technical language it may be said to be \"time plus space\", or \"space plus time\": and in this sense it has, or at least involves a reference to, four dimensions. And how the One of Time, of Space the Three, Might in the Chain of Symbols girdled be.\" — William Rowan Hamilton (Quoted in R.P. Graves, \"Life of Sir William Rowan Hamilton\"). • \"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and, though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way, including Clerk Maxwell.\" — Lord Kelvin, 1892. • \"I came later to see that, as far as the vector analysis I required was concerned, the quaternion was not only not required, but was a positive evil of no inconsiderable magnitude; and that by its avoidance the establishment of vector analysis was made quite simple and its working also simplified, and that it could be conveniently harmonised with ordinary Cartesian work.\" Oliver Heaviside, Electromagnetic Theory, Volume I, pp. 134–135 (The Electrician Printing and Publishing Company, London, 1893). • \"Neither matrices nor quaternions and ordinary vectors were banished from these ten [additional] chapters. For, in spite of the uncontested power of the modern Tensor Calculus, those older mathematical languages continue, in my opinion, to offer conspicuous advantages in the restricted field of special relativity. Moreover, in science as well as in every-day life, the mastery of more than one language is also precious, as it broadens our views, is conducive to criticism with regard to, and guards against hypostasy [weak-foundation] of, the matter expressed by words or mathematical symbols.\" — Ludwik Silberstein, preparing the second edition of his Theory of Relativity\n\n74\n\nQuaternion in 1924. • \"… quaternions appear to exude an air of nineteenth century decay, as a rather unsuccessful species in the struggle-for-life of mathematical ideas. Mathematicians, admittedly, still keep a warm place in their hearts for the remarkable algebraic properties of quaternions but, alas, such enthusiasm means little to the harder-headed physical scientist.\" — Simon L. Altmann, 1986.\n\nNotes [1] \"On Quaternions; or on a new System of Imaginaries in Algebra (letter to John T. Graves, dated October 17, 1843)\". 1843. [2] Boris Abramovich Rozenfelʹd (1988).
