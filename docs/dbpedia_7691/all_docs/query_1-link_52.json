        "text": "Introduction – Scientific Revolution\n\nThe character of modern science is generally considered to have emerged during the early modern period (from roughly 1550 to 1750 beginning with the Renaissance and ending with the Age of Enlightenment and the wars of the French Revolution) spanning, more or less, a time that has subsequently become known as the Scientific Revolution, a period in which we see a maturing of the disciplines of astronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics as they surpassed the learning of the Classical world.\n\nIn a mischievous challenge to current ideas of historical continuity historian David Wootton claims that the Scientific Revolution was ‘the rejection of moribund Scholastic Aristotelianism‘ and that ‘Modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe saw a nova, or new star, and 1704, when Newton published his Opticks‘[2] but this conclusion relies on a narrow interpretation of both science and its predecessors. The customary convenient historical bookends for the period are Copernicus’s published claims for a heliocentric planetary system published in 1543 and the masterly Principia of Newton in 1687. Certainly today’s science involves a community of experts with research programs that have established sophisticated evidence-based theories that can make reliable predictions. But, it is argued elsewhere (see Reason & science) that the underlying use of reason divested of all extraneous accretions, which is at the core of science, came to us from Classical times – in other words, that the science of the modern era grew out of ancient modes of thought rather than replacing them.\n\nOur current use of the word ‘science’ and our idea of scientists dates back only as far as the 19th century, the word ‘scientist’ first appearing in 1834 created by the English naturalist-theologian William Whewell to distinguish those who sought knowledge of nature from those who sought knowledge in other disciplines. Only in the 19th century did publicly funded scientists emerge who did not depend on patronage or their own resources: before this time ‘science’ (Latin scientia pl. scientiae) simply meant ‘knowledge’. What we now know as ‘science’ fell, in the 16th and 17th centuries, under the general name of natural philosophy.\n\nThe sphere of intellectual study occupied by the natural philosopher was much wider than that of the scientist today being an attempt to integrate all aspects of reasoning about the the world and therefore including theology and metaphysics. Much more than today these thinkers tried to establish the connectedness of everything rather than viewing objects and systems in isolation. It is only by embracing their worldview that we can appreciate the significance of their achievements. This article attempts to paint something of the experience of our precursor scientists.\n\nFrom antiquity to the Scientific Revolution\n\nTheophrastus was followed by Strato at the Lyceum in Athens before the seat of learning moved to Alexandria which became the centre of learning for western Europe.\n\nIn the eastern (Byzantine) Roman empire learning was fostered in major cities like Antioch and Constantinople. A university-like school was founded as the Pandidakterion at Constantinople in 425 by emperor Theodosius II. It had 31 chairs in what would become the traditional Medieval liberal arts of law, philosophy, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, rhetoric and languages (mainly Latin and Greek) and persisted into the 15th century. Though the Pandidakterion is sometimes regarded as the first ‘university’ it lacked the corporate structure of students and masters that defined the medieval universities of Western Europe to which the Latin term universitas was first applied.\n\nIn the West the Roman world had converted to Christianity under Emperor Constantine in the 4th century CE. But Christians and Romans alike looked back with deep respect to the intellectual tradition of thought that had flowed from ancient Greece as distilled into the works of the great thinkers Plato and Aristotle. For example, Christian theology was united with the thought of Plato in St Augustine’s (354-430 CE) monumental City of God). Plato’s Theory of Forms, his owrld of timeless, perfect, and eternal truths was equated with the Christian heaven. The much later recovery of Aristotle‘s works from the Muslim world, and their translation from the Arabic into Latin, permitted a similar unification with Christian theology by St Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) in his great treatise on Catholic theology Summa Theologica).\n\nToday we associate scientific thinking with the attempt to eliminate from our reasoning anything that might interfere with or prejudice our conclusions. The Pre-Socratic philosophers minimized the dependence on supernatural explanations that were prevalent at that time. Aristotle, in his Physics, demonstrated the kind of detached critical thinking needed to penetrate those subjects that would later become domains of study on the curricula of educational institutions. He attempted to explore rational thought unfettered by tradition, ideology, religion, or authoritarian doctrine and his philosophy was devoid of the transcendental mysticism evident in Plato. Aristotle was perhaps the world’s greatest polymath, originating or making major contributions to the studies of aesthetics, ethics, logic (especially syllogistic deductive logic), metaphysics, physics, politics, rhetoric, biology (especially zoology), his was a comprehensive system of Western philosophy built on the genius of his teacher Plato.\n\nAristotle had no inkling of modern science so how is it that, until the mid 17th century his teaching remained vitually unchallenged? English philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) offers us two valuable insights into Aristotle’s method and legacy ‘… after his death it was two thousand years before the world produced any philosopher who could be regarded as approximately his equal … he is the first to write like a professor: his treatises are systematic … he is a professional teacher not an inspired prophet … his work is critical, careful, pedestrian, without any trace of Bacchic enthusiasm … the errors of his predecessors were the glorious errors of youth attempting the impossible; his errors are those of age which cannot free itself of habitual prejudices’.[3] Plato’s philosophy was expressed in elegant Greek prose. Much of Aristotle’s work is lost and what remains is in the form of lecture notes although we are told that he too, in works now lost, demonstrated a mastery of the Greek language. Russell adds … ‘Aristotle is the last Greek philosopher who faces the world cheerfully; after him, all have, in one form or another, a philosophy of retreat’.[4]\n\nGradually and inevitably the discoveries of modern science would surpass those of the ancients. This happened in the early 17th century when the sense of progress resulting from new scientific and technological discoveries created a forward-looking mentality. But for nearly 1000 years thinkers had looked backwards for intellectual and moral guidance. Wisdom could only be obtained through the interpretation and understanding of the great works of the past. The common man looked to the Christian Bible for not only moral truth, but a literal account of Creation, cosmology, and the history of mankind. However, men of learning needed a greater breadth of knowlege, albeit founded in religion, and this was inherited from Roman learning with its foundation in Greek philosophy and traditions. To overcome the deep-seated traditional influences of the past required active rebellion.\n\nThe progressive overthrow of several key ideas can be traced through the years of the Scientific Revolution. Medicine had acquired from the time of Hippocrates (c. 460-c.370 BCE), the ‘Father of Medicine’ ancient texts known as the Hippocratic Corpus. These texts, which outlined the state of medical knowledge in his time, were later acquired by the influential Greco-Roman physician Galen (129-200 CE) who promoted the theory of the four humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile) whose proportions and condition were not only responsible for the health but also for the four major personality types, the sangine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic. From Aristotle, and the Greek tradition associated with Empedocles (c. 490 – c. 430 BCE) the struggle to determine the ultimate composition of matter had resolved into the four elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water and the atomistic theory of Leucippus (5th BCE) and Democritus (c. 460 – c. 370 BCE). To Plato’s student Eudoxus we can attribute the idea of the firmament as consisting of concentric spheres. Greek mathematics had flourished with the genius of people like Pythagoras, Archimedes, and Euclid, the latter living in Hellenistic Alexandria at the time of King Ptolemy I (323–283 BCE) who was himself an authority on astronomy and world geography up to the Early Modern period. The Ptolemaic map of the world remained unchanged until the 15th century era of European maritime exploration while it was the Ptolemaic system of planetary cycles and epicycles that so challenged the astronomers of the Scientific Revolution. Aristotle was himself triumphantly proved wrong in various ways by the new empiricists. Among his errors were claims for spontaneous generation and that bodies fell at speeds relating to their weight.\n\nGradually ancient ideas like these dissolved or were reformulated into a different, more sophisticated, and more evidence-based picture of the Earth and the heavens.\n\nCarolingian Renaissance\n\nThere were two revivals of learning prior to the Renaissance, firstly that of Charlemagne (called the the Carolingian Renaissance) in the 9th century when the court of Emperor Charlemagne in Aachen became a centre of learning and culture. There was a period of formal governance through monastic life across Europe based on Roman traditions along with the birth of Cathedral schools that were to evolve into our modern universities. By the end of the Roman empire only a few popular fragments of the former Greek academic output were available.\n\nMuslim Renaissance\n\nIn the 12th century there was another revival of learning and culture, including the growth of towns, cities, and more stable government, as the population doubled, and there was a higher standard of living and steady food supply, perhaps a consequence of the Medieval Warm Period. It was at this time that Aristotle’s works, which had been lost to the West, but translated from Greek into Arabic by the Muslim world (and supplemented by Arabic learning) to be translated into Latin. These works, along with many other scientific, philosophical and other masterpieces, were rediscovered by Western scholars, mostly in Spain, where they were translated from the Arabic into Latin. Cathedral schools developed formal university curricula based on religious studies, medicine, the law, and Aristotelian philosophy in an educational tradition that became known as Scholasticism. Cultural achievements were eroded during the Great Plague of 1348 that swept across Europe killing towards half the population.\n\nHumanism was in part about freeing the human intellect from dogma and authoritarian tradition to breathe the oxygen of liberated knowledge and experience opened up to the creative imagination. But this took place within religious tradition. Humanists were mostly in religious orders, mainly Franciscan and Dominican, and are not to be confused with the 20th century movement of secular humanism. Several key factors can be seen to contribute to this release of the human intellect. Firstly there was the invention of the printing press with its capacity to disseminate information. ‘By 1500, there were about 1000 in operation, and between thirty and forty thousand titles had been printed, representing roughly ten million books‘.[5] Secondly there were the world-expanding voyages of discovery as Europeans spread into western Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, then India, the Americas and finally the far East in a circumnavigation of the Earth, thus unshrouding the mystery of the world beyond and revealing myriad new plants, animals and, above all, the need to reconcile accepted doctrines with those of other peoples and cultures.\n\nAll of life was religious life – birth, marriage, death, the afterlife, and the meaning of everything – was steeped in religious tradition and thinking. The transition from polytheism to monotheism had resolved many intellectual questions but monotheism itself was racked by internal dissent. The opening of the sixteenth century was marked by protestation against Catholic practices, a reformation movement that became Protestantism, itself fracturing into Lutheran, Calvinist and more while the Catholic Church responded with its own program of ‘Counter-Reformation’ creating Jesuit orders that would spur the Scientific Revolution and the spread of scholarship to China, India, and the Americas. The order of the world could be seen in everything from mathematics to the design of nature and was clear evidence of the work of God. But for several hundred years Europe became a conglomeration of rival states warring over religious ideology.\n\nThe Early Modern World\n\nLife for most people in the Early Modern world was one of toil in the fields made meaningful through religious observance. For those with the time to contemplate existence by study, the universe was the marvel of God’s orderly creation filled with his purpose and rich in meaning. The enquiring mind could investigate God’s design that was so evident in all living creatures, the orderly behaviour of the Sun, Moon, stars and planets of the firmament. One reason for study was the discovery of the many secret signs in the world that indicated God’s presence.\n\nHumanism\n\nThe intellectual ethos of the Scientific Revolution began with a Renaissance in the Italian city states of the 13th and 14th centuries, subsequently spreading to north-west Europe. Universities at this time provided essentially vocational training for men destined to enter the professions of Medicine, Theology, and Law but rediscovery of the Classical learning of Greece and Rome resulted in an intellectual movement now known as Renaissance humanism which placed an emphasis on the ‘humanities’ (Latin humanitas) which included subjects like rhetoric, history, philosophy, and literature. Works of the Roman scholar Cicero (106-43 BCE) were particularly influential. Petrarch (1304-1374) was a Florentine poet and scholar who studied at Montpellier (1316-1320) and Bologna (1320-1323) and a leading inspirational figure in the movement. He travelled widely, his letters as literary work achieving wide acclaim. In his Secretum Meum (My Book) that the full flowering of human creativity and intellectual imagination was the manifestation of God-given qualities and therefore to be encouraged. He is credited with the rediscovery of Cicero’s letters and the coining of the concept of the Dark Ages.\n\nAmong the humanists were writers whose work remains vital and interesting today. Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) was an Italian poet from Ravenna and author of the Divine Comedy, a journey through Hell, Purgatory, an Paradise, acclaimed as the greatest poem of the Middle Ages like the work of his fellow poet Bocaccio (1313-1375) (known for The Decameron) his most famous work was written in the vernacular rather than the usual Latin. Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) was a senior official in the Florentine Republic sometimes heralded as the ‘Father of Political Science’. His cynical vision of political life as represented in ‘The Prince‘ (1513) was struck a chord down the generations. As the movement passed northwards other figures would emerge, among them the Dutchman Erasmus (1466-1536) from Rotterdam whose Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament and other works, wwould be infuential in the coming Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation.\n\nThe teaching of the Church encouraged a spiritual and contemplative life as preparation for the eternal life hereafter. The early Church regarded the rationalism of the Classical era with suspicion since it had given rise to confusion and conflict. Secure foundations for life came from faith, not reason. The new emphasis, while retaining the old religious faith, was on the individual and secularism.\n\nSt Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was an Italian Dominican friar and priest who restored respect for rational enquiry through his promotion of natural theology, the idea that the order we see in the world around us is a manifestation of God’s order, of intelligent design, and that we must use reason to discover this order. His greatest work, Summa Theologiae was the pinnacle of Scholasticism[7], was a reconciliation of the thought of Aristotle (‘The Philosopher’) with Christian theology. Supposedly at the request of Thomas Aquinas, William of Moerbeke (1215-1235 – c. 1286), a Dominican Flemish monk working in the Greek Pelopponese, translated the complete works of Aristotle directly from the Greek into Latin when the Byzantine Empire was under Roman Latin rule. Many of the copies of Aristotle in Latin at that time had originated from Spain as translations of Arabic texts in the library of Toledo, a provincial capital in the Caliphate of Cordoba. Many of these had, in turn, passed through Syrian versions rather than being translated from the originals.\n\nMarsilio Ficino (1433-1499) was an Italian scholar, astrologer and priest who encouraged the revival of Neoplatonism, the uniting of Platonic ideas with those of Christianity, notably the merging of heaven and the Platonic eternal world of Forms.\n\nThrough the 15th century Greek became more widely written and studied but by the 16th century the humanist movement had began to fade as more writers resorted to the use of the vernacular and the Scientific Revolution gathered momentum.\n\nThe intellectual cosmological synthesis of these times was, as we shall see, in various ways more integrated, coherent, and meaningful than the fragmented and detached world we know today with its limited sense of purpose and absence of cosmic meaning. The humanists based this social movement of renewal on the recovery of Roman learning. An outstanding genius and product of these times was the polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) who soaked up the knowledge of his day while making detailed observations of the natural world and contributions to academic disciplines like anatomy, engineering, and architecture while at the same time being widely acknowledged as one of the greatest painters of all time (Mona Lisa c. 1503-1506). He worked in Florence, Rome, Bologna and Venice before ending his days in France. Leonardo was the embodiment of the expression ‘Renaissance Man’, celebrating knowledge, both art and science, engaging in critical experimentation and observation, and the exercise of the intellect while avoiding dogma and superstition.\n\nHumanists both respected and challenged the scientific and cultural world of the ancients. The contradictions and complexity of polytheism, so much a part of the Greco-Roman world, had now resolved into the more manageable monotheism. The gradual acceptance, among intellectuals, of the scientific mode of thought was a reaction to the chaos and cruelty of superstition but it was awakened by the rediscovery of ancient culture with its liberation of the human spirit.\n\nEarth, Air, Fire, Water\n\nA central task for the natural philosopher is to provide a naturalistic account of the physical matter or substance of the universe. Is it one kind of thing manifest in different ways, or is it simply many different things? Is substance infinitely divisible or it composed of indivisible minute particles? If made up of particles are these particles all the same or are they different, and if so in what way? How does matter combine to form the many abjects we see around us? How is the variety we see around us to be reduced or classified into more basic or fundamental elements? How do we account for transformations of substance – solid to liquid, water to gas etc.? Indeed, why do things change at all, and why do they move as they do – for example, why do unsupported objects fall to the ground rather than floating up into the sky?\n\nToday we so easily forget, or ignore, the enormity of these questions to which we still struggle to find satisfactory answers today.\n\nThe ancient learning of Pre-Socratic and Classical philosophers bequeathed to the Middle Ages the idea, via Empedocles and Aristotle, that the physical world could be divided into four fundamental elements – Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Over the period of the Scientific Revolution the Classical cosmology and this characterisation of matter would undergo extensive revision.\n\nFollowing Aristotle it was assumed that the heavy elements, earth and water, were drawn down towards the centre of the Earth, which was a point of rest at the centre of the universe. Light elements, air and fire, would therefore move upwards. This explained why a candle flame and its smoke smoke were directed upwards and rocks and rain downwards as they ‘strived’ to find their natural place. This natural order was to be refined or replaced although Aristotelian ‘powers’ would never go away completely. With the Bible as accepted and literal authority the age of the Earth was taken as beeing about 6000 years. Though rock strata containing seashells were observed away from the sea and there was evidence of cataclysmic events these were mostly related to biblical events, most notably Noah’s flood. However, observations on ocean currents, volcanoes and other geological phenomena were recorded in Athanasius Kircher’s Subterranean World (1665) an Thomas Burnet’s Sacred Theory of the Earth (1680s) and mysterious magnetic attraction investigated in On the Magnet (1600) by William Gilbert (1544-1603) in which he named north and south poles as he noted that compass needles were attracted towards terrestrial not celestial poles and he noted for the first time that the Earth was itself a vast magnet together with some further, idiosyncratic by today’s standards, observations on attractive forces.\n\nThe selection of fire as one of the four fundamental elements of the universe might seem strange to us but it seemed to be at the heart of physical transformation, of volcanic eruption and, with the emission of great heat, the conversion of objects into smoke and different forms of matter. This was the domain of alchemy and the chymists. Another signature characteristic of the Scientific Revolution was the attempts to convert base metals like lead into gold (chrysopoeia). Along with the pursuit of the mystical and magical, the potions and medicaments, came careful experiment and observation into dyes, oils, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, pigments, salts in a tradition harking back to 4th century Hellenistic Egypt. One major goal was to find the Philosopher’s Stone, a physical agent that would serve as a transforming agent. Profitable discoveries could be witheld as trade secrets.\n\nThe cosmological order, the connectedness of all things\n\nFor most people life in the Middle Ages was one of relentless toil in the fields but what were the intellectual changes that were taking place among the more privileged, what was their mind-set? The Early Modern educated people lived in a world of cosmological order and interconnectedness. There were several key ideas contributing to this perception:\n\nThe sidereal or supra-lunal world, the sublunar world, and the microcosm\n\nThe popular image of the universe in 1600 consisted of three major parts: everything beyond the Moon (the sidereal world), eveything under the Moon (the sublunar world), and human beings (microcosm). The study of these integrated worlds – God, nature, man – was the task of the natural philosopher who developed a cosmic perspective. It was only in the 19th century that academic study resulted in subject specialization that excluded a synoptic overview, possibly a consequence of the decreased relevance of an integrating deity.\n\nThe categories of knowledge were those largely inherited from the ancients, subjects like philosophy, physics,[6] astronomy, medicine, music, geography, poetry, and mathematics, all valuable sources of knowledge and not divided into science and humanities although high on the agenda in the universities was law, medicine, and theology.\n\nGreat Chain of Being\n\nFirst there was the Great Chain of Being, the overall structure of the universe including the meaning and purpose of all its contents, especially the role of humanity within this structure and the relationship between man and God. This image of existence pervaded all thought and is described under the heading ‘Vallue’ here.\n\nMagia naturalis\n\nFor men of learning the task was to decipher the many connections that existed in the cosmic order and, if possible, to harness that order for human benefit. This mode of study was called magia naturalis or mastery of nature, pejoratively referred to as ‘magic’. Aristotelians divided the world into two kinds of properties, the manifest or primary qualities available to the sense organs (hot, cold, wet, dry, bitter, salty, smooth) as anything that stimulated the senses. Some objects, like magnets (lodestones) and the pull of the Moon on the tides, had hidden qualities that could not be detected by the senses. The connections of the cosmos, the hidden properties of things, needed to be discovered, and to assist this process God had provided clues. So, for example, there was a silent forceful connection between the sunflower and the Sun. The sunflower demonstrated this by the shape and colour of its flower that followed the path of the Sun across the sky through the day. The Sun, most prominent of the bodies in the firmament, was yellow, the colour of the glistening noble metal gold. The walnut was associated with the brain, and so on in what was known as the ‘doctrine of signatures‘ which demonstrated the power of similitude. The book De Signaturis (1609) by Oswald Cross of Prague declares that ‘God has stamped upon each plant legible characters to disclose the uses‘. The world was full of such meanings and hidden purposes waiting to be revealed. One observation in music was the sympathetic vibrations of objects at a distance that occurred in harmonic intervals of sound. Aristotle had said that this required a medium for the transmission of vibration which became the spiritus mundi, an invisible object connecting all things.\n\nThe mechanical philosophy\n\nThe perception of cause as efficient cause (consider colliding billiard balls) and the mechanical predictability of the clocks of the period created a popular metaphor of the universe as a machine, mechanical processes also being associated with the operation of bodies and biological systems. Roman Lucretius had spoken of the machina mundi to express the order and regularity of the universe. The ancient metaphor of the world as an organism whose parts were integrated to achieve purposeful objectives was replaced by the metaphor of a lifeless and purposeless mechanism. God was like a watchmaker. But there were still the mysteries of ‘action at a distance’ – the way magnets attract and fire heats without any visible connection between the source object and the objects it affects. Newtonian mechanics would describe with mathematical precision how these mysterious forces behaved but without explaining what they were.\n\nIntelligent design\n\nRegardless of individual interests almost all thinkers of the period embraced the idea of a close connection between God, man, and the natural world. Religion was not a matter of opinion and personal choice; these natural philosophers were Christians whose theology expressed facts as certain as those of science. God’s Creation, the Book of Nature, was a supplement to the Book of Scripture; it was an object for sustained study and interpretation since it revealed the wonder of God’s design. ‘Early modern thinkers, like their Medieval forebears, looked out on a world of connections and a world full of purpose and meaning as well as of mystery, wonder, and promise.’[1]\n\nSuperstition & science\n\nThrough the Middle Ages a deep and pervasive religious belief was practiced in a world alongside what learned men called ‘superstition’. Uneducated people attended church services whose liturgy promoting the one true god was given in Latin. But their daily lives were still populated with nature gods, evil spirits, sacred groves and trees, demons, goblins, magic, mysterious chemical potions, ghosts, and the occult. Catholicism worked hard to first eliminate and then absorb the old animistic and polytheistic beliefs of the past. Old women were slaughtered by the thousand for being wiches. To reduce the impact of pagan beliefs the Catholic Church combined days of Christian celebrations with those of pagan festivals. Chemistry was in its earliest stages. In accounting for substance we are familiar with the elegance of matter as elements of the Periodic Table all forged into neat mathematical compounds. Though the atomism of Democritus was carried over from the ancients the elemental explanation of the material world was in terms of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.\n\nThe new thinking of the Scientific Revolution was a reaction to the terrors and excesses of superstition in all aspects of academic thought, but it was largely a critical attack from within the framework of accepted state religion. Expressed crudely, there was a supernatural exorcism as academic disciplines were subjected to the scrutiny of disinterested critical reason. The outcome amounted to a transition from: numerology to mathematics; physic to medicine; alchemy to physics and chemistry; and astrology to astronomy.\n\nThe spirit of direct enquiry into nature needed a fresh start to escape the deference to the ancient intellect, mostly the influence of Aristotle ‘The Philosopher’, but also the grip of religious interpretation. ‘… men did not study flowers or birds for their own sakes or in order to learn from them new insights into reality; they went to them solely for illustrations of moral or metaphysical dogmas, accepted on authority and believed to be dicinely ordained; they sought in nature not knowledge but edification, not Enlightenment but the exemplification of preconceived ideas‘.(R. p. 3)\n\nAstrology to Astronomy\n\nToday the night sky is, for most of us, of little consequence, obscured by the lighting of our cities. But before electricity each night would reveal to all the beauty and wonder of points of distant twinkling light rotating in the eternal black silence. From the earliest times the regular movement of the heavens has triggered human curiosity.\n\nBabylonian star charts were inherited by ancient Greek astronomers. Plato observed mathematical harmony in the firmament its perfect regularity also being admired by the Pythagoreans who thought it reflected the mathematical ideas of its Creator and served as a model for orderly human government. The movement of the firmament was a circle, the most perfect shape. Since motion around a circle is without beginning or end it symbolises timelessness and the eternal. Aristotle divided the universe into a superlunar domain which included everything beyond the moon and a sublunar world that included everything below. Looking up to the unchanging perfection and mathematical precision of movement of the superlunary heavens Aristotle thought it must consist of a pure and elemental substance which he called the aither being a different element than the sublunary elements earth, air, fire and water out of which the ever-changing sublunary realm was composed.\n\nThe stars remained fixed in relation to one-another, passing across the sky each night but rising about four minutes earlier each night such that over the weeks the constellations (patterns of stars named after objects and people like Taurus (bull), Orion (the hunter), Libra (scales), and Pisces (fish)) seemed to move across the sky taking one year to returning to their original position. The Sun moved more slowly changing its position relative to the starry background and taking a year to return to its original position. The Moon would rise about 50 minutes later each night, taking a month (29 days) to return to its original position. Then there were seven planets (meaning ‘wanderers’), the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, that moved irregularly against the starry backdrop, their movement passing through a narrow band of 12 constellations known as the zodiac.\n\nThe ancient viewed the heavens as made up of concentric spheres with the Earth it the centre. Objects naturally move towards the centre of the universe, falling downwards. However, this model failed to explain some heavenly movements as did the system of circles within circles devised by Ptolemy (c. 100-170 CE) to overcome these difficulties. As learning passed to the Arabic world these problems occupied Islamic mathematicians and astronomers until inherited by Medieval European astronomers.\n\nNicholas Copernicus (1473-1543)\n\nNicholas Copernicus was a canon at a cathedral in today’s Poland. He had studied medicine in Padua, and developed an interest in astronomy while studying canon law at Bologna. Here he calculated that the Earth rotated around the Sun along with the other planets, except for the moon which orbits the Earth. In this heliocentric system the Earth rotated on its axis once a day creating the illusion of a rotating firmament and the Sun passing through the zodiac and that the irregular movement of the planets was a consequence of the relative motion between them and the Earth. Copernicus worked steadily on his thesis but it was only in 1543, shortly before he died, that his work On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs was published. His conclusions were questioned because they were counterintuitive. How could the Earth be spinning when we have no sense of motion?\n\nAstronomy calculated the positions of the objects on the celestial sphere and astrology tried to explain their effects on th Earth although the two were interrelated. Celestial studies attempting to make predictions, especially of the weather that was so important to farmers. This resulted in a proliferation of almanacs that included calendars, tables of lunar cycles, dates of eclipses, dates of passage of planets through the constellations etc. Medical astrology related the planetary configurations at time of birth to medical treatments and peoples’ temperaments as related to the humours they acquired at birth: this being called the ‘complexion’. Suitable dates for important life choices were calculated this way and strange occurrences like the sudden appearance of comets could be interpreted as portents. All things were signs, symbols, and messages hidden in nature and there to be deciphered.\n\nJohannes Kepler (1571-1630)\n\nAstronomers continued making discoveries. Johannes Kepler, who was originally an assistant to Tycho de Brahe, calculated that the positions of the planets are best accounted for if they move in an ellipse rather than a circle. He thus broke with the 2000-year conviction expressed in Plato’s idea of celestial pefection. But the factors controlling the movement and positioning of planets remained a mystery, Kepler postulating an anima motrix, a power in the Sun that propelled the planerts on their way.\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564-1642)\n\nItalian Galileo Galilei heard about the Dutch invention of the telescope and, building his own, began a phase of observations and new discoveries in 1609 that included: the craters, mountains, and valleys of the Moon, the four moons orbiting Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and the way Venus had phases like the Moon. He published these findings in the Starry Messenger (1610). His findings proved unpopular with the Church discouraging open communication but the discoveries continued. Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655) obserbved the transit of Mercury across the face of the Sun in 1631, the detail of Saturn’s rings and largest Moon by Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) in 1656 and four more discovered by Gian Cassini (1625-1712). Star maps and lunar maps followed.\n\nIsaac Newton (1643-1727)\n\nFrom the most ancient times we had looked up to the heavens because here was the eternal and unchanging perfection of the firmament. Though Aristotle had regarded the supralunary world as perfect, eternal and unchanging he had advocated more research into living organisms (see Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Theophrastus) and the sublunary world of coming-to-be and passing-away. The Middle Ages at first retained the four elements with attention directed to both the celestial to the terrestrial.\n\nPlanetary movement remained a mystery philosopher-scientist Rene Descartes who made original contributions in algebra and geometry, and promoting the mechanical model of the universe. Descartes postulated celestial vortices of particles driving the planets along and this was, at first, sufficient to convince the young English natural philosopher Isaac Newton but by the 1680s he was thinking in terms of an attractive force existing between Sun and planets based on the kind of attraction observed in magnets. In his most famous work, Principia Mathematica, he gave a mathematical derivation of planetary motion as the laws of universal gravitation, the inverse-square law that challenged any remnant Aristotelian distinction between the celestial and terrestrial. But Newton’s hidden force, like Aristotle’s ‘hidden qualities’ continued to tantalize the mind. Newton was content to describe gravity’s effects without wishing to penetrate further into what gravity itself was – and what was its cause. For Newton God was both the Creator and universal Agent.\n\nNewton was the first scientist to be buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nPhysic to medicine\n\nFor a more in-depth historical account of plants and medicine see plant science 1\n\nEducation at universities of the Middle Ages was directed towards three major disciplines – Theology, Medicine, and Law – which led, in turn, to socity’s most highly esteemed professions. Physics and astronomy lay on the path to these major occupations, chemistry as we know it today had no classical precedent and therefore did not emerge as an academic discipline until the 18th century. Medicine as taught in 1500 was a synthesis of the teachings of Greek Hippocrates, Greco-Roman Galen and medicinal learning that had also accumulated in the Arabic world as synthesised by Ibn Sina (Avicenna). Botany as a discipline diverged from the medical faculties with the appointment of botany professors to 16th century university medicinal gardens at places at the medical faculties of universities in Padua and Pisa. A corner had been turned though as herbals began to accumulate herbal pharmacopia-like information and organisations like London‘s Royal College of Physicians (est. 1518) gradually became more commonplace.\n\nAncient Romans had, perhaps surprisingly given the barbarity of some of their practices, resisted the dissection of human bodies, regarding it as a violation. But by 1300 human anatomical dissection was routine training for medical students at universities like Padua and Bologna although only the bodies of criminals and other undesirables.\n\nAndreas Versalius’s (1514-1564)\n\nCoinciding with the 1543 publication of of Copernicus’s On the Revolutions was Paduan surgeon Andreas Versalius’s On the Structure of the Human Body leading to the construction of steep anatomy theatres adopted by other countries as the medical torch was passed on from Italy to, for example, the Netherlands Leiden University (1596) which would later become the medical centre for Europe under Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738). He was preceded by Flemish nobleman Joan Baptista van Helmont (1579-1644), a rebellious but stimulating and influential thinker of his day.\n\nWilliam Harvey (1578-1657)\n\nOf special note too is William Harvey’s (1578-1657) work on the circulation of the blood published in 1628 with careful empirical description of the arteries and veins.\n\nRobert Hooke (1635-1703)\n\nThe world was suddenly viewed at a different scale when Robert Hooke (1635-1703) built an improved model of the microscope in the 1660s generating research into the reproductive cycles of both animals and plants and illustrations showing the cellular structure of both animals and plants. How did new individuals arise from sperm and eggs – were passed from generation to generation as tiny individuals (preformationism) or were completely new individual produced with each generation (epigenesis)? Plants anatomy was launched by London’s Hehemiah Grew (1641-1712) and Italian Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694).\n\nAspects of chemistry also merged from medicine as chemical medicine. In Germany of the following century Johannes Hartmann (1568-1631) became the first professor of chemiatria (chemical medicine) at the University of Marburg in 1609 and classes in chymistry were soon given at the medicinal Jardin du Roi in Paris.\n\nParacelsus (1493-1541)\n\nEarly modern chymists were renowned for their preparation of medicinal extracts. Most famous of these men was the Swiss Paracelsus who resisted the medicine that had been passed down the ages from Egyptian, Greco-Roman, and Arabic sources preferring to follow instead a system based on Germanic folk beliefs. He began to view the world as fundamentally chemical – the formation of rain, body metabolism, the minerals of the Earth, healing medicines – all was chemistry. But although physics and astronomy were an established part of the university curriculum chemistry would not be included until the 18thth century since it could account for the way that substances could be broken down and reconstituted.\n\nMedicine to botany\n\nThe academic interest in plants during the Early Modern period began as a preoccupation with their medicinal properties. This was a continuation of a tradition dating back to at least ancient Egypt. Only Theophrastus (c. 371–c.287 BCE), who followed Aristotle as Head of the Lyceum in ancient Athens, showed an interest in plants for their own sake rather than their utility. His study of plant structure, function, and relationships (independent from the herbalists or rhizotomi) initiated the academic discipline of plant science. Following Theophrastus interest in plants once again focused on utilitarian and medicinal concerns. Plant science as a subject independent from medicine did not subsequently reappear until the Italian Renaissance and the appointment of professors of botany as administors of physic gardens associated with the medical faculties of universities in Pisa (1544), Padua and Florence (1545). These medicinal gardens are generally interpreted as the world’s first botanic gardens although as medicinal gardens they are probably more accurately referred to as the first stage in the development of botanic gardens of the modern era.\n\nThough professors of botany were still essentially physicians and apothecaries their interest in accurate description led to the first collections of dried specimens pressed and attached to card to be labelled and shelved in buildings called herbaria. Specimens were used for scientific comparison, study and, above all, description. Following the development of the printing press among the first printed books were the herbals. These were descriptions of plants, including their medicinal and other properties and their publication would span the period c. 1470–1670 before evolving, on the one hand, into a medicinal pharmacopeia and, on the other hand, the formal compendia of plant descriptions known as Floras.\n\nAssociated with herbals were woodcut pictures that would, over time, evolve into accurate botanical illustrations. The Age of Discovery and exploration was introducing new plants that needed description, especially those from the New World. By the mid 17th century the first simple attempts at global inventories of plants were being made with major advances in botanical nomenclature and increasing standardization of terminology for the now more closely observed features of plant morphology and anatomy which assisted identification. However, the formalization of an internationally-agreed fully standardized method of plant description and classification would not arrive until the work of the great naturalist Linnaeus, published in the middle of the 18th century. It was only towards the end of the period that studies in plant sexuality such as the observation of fertilization by Camerarius (1665–1721) and the structure of pollen by Englishman Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712) opened up this field. The serious business of plant collection and study was just beginning in earnest at Leiden and Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden age at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries at a time when the collection of plants for garden decoration was also gathering pace.\n\nNumerology to mathematics & engineering\n\nNowhere could the underlying order of the universe be encountered more obviously than in the world of numbers and mathematics. A vegetarian fraternity headed by Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570 – 495 BC) would greatly influence the future of mathematics. Pythagoras benefitted from travel to Egypt, Greece, and possibly India, but spent most of his working life in Magna Graeca (the ancient name for southern Italy and Sicily). He had a major influence on fellow Greek philosopher Plato (c. 428-348 BCE) who founded a university-like Academy in 387 BCE with the motto ‘Let none unversed in geometry enter here‘.\n\nThe Pythagoreans were a mystical and spiritual sect believing in the transmigration of souls. Number infused the world and was redolent with symbolism and meaning in a tradition that was just as evident among early modern intellectuals. Pythagoreans considered four a perfect number and we can get an impression of the way numerology was integrated into Medieval life by tracing some of its associations.\n\nFour\n\nAccording to Indian, Persian, Greek, and Roman traditions of medicine, especially those espoused by Hippocrates and the Islamic physicians, the human body reflected the four elements of the world. Number 4 was the number of stability, order, and justice. Within mathematics four is the only cardinal numeral in the English language that has the same number of letters as its number value, it is the smallest composite number, its proper divisors being 1 and 2.\n\nTo the ancients there were four elements. These were the simplest substances out of which all else was composed (earth, air, fire, and water). Galen (c. 129- 200 CE) claimed that these elements were used by Hippocrates to describe the association of the human body with four bodily fluids or humours: yellow bile (fire), black bile (earth), blood (air), and phlegm (water) from which are derived the four temperaments (melancholic, choleric, phlegmatic, sanguine) these, in turn, were related to the four qualities hot and cold, wet and dry. The rational behaviour of the heavens was assumed to influence our bodily functions through the medium of medical astrology. The planets, for example, could have an influence on particular human organs. Astrology was associated more with medical diagnosis than with the prognostication we associate with horoscopes today. Astrological diagnoses began to wane in the 17th century but th theory of ‘humours’ we associate with Hippopcrates and Galen continued well into the 18th century. Attention from professional physicians was, of course, a luxury som most households and communities maintained catalogues of home remedies that were a mixture of common sense, superstition, and occult practice.\n\nBut the association went much deeper. There were four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter), four phases of the moon, four causes (material, efficient, formal, final), the four corners of the world (north, south, east, west) and therefore four winds. Existence itself is comprised of four dimensions (time in one dimension, and space in the three dimensions of length, width, and height).\n\nSimilar catalogues of numerical significance were assembled for other numbers and we see remanants of these in today’s astrology.\n\nFollowing the example of the Oxford Calculators (c. 1300) who had explored the application of mathematics to motion Galileo applied mathematical abstraction to the idealized movement of bodies regarding air resistance and friction as ‘imperfections’. He famously wrote that the universe ‘… is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a word of it‘. The application of mathematics would be a feature of the Scientific Revolution along with a satisfaction in establishing effects, what things do, rather than why they do so in the old Aristotleian search for causes.\n\nFollowing in the great civilizations of the past Renaissance Italian natural philosophers were deeply engrossed with the problems of supplying cities with water, that is, with hydraulics and fluid dynamics – the design, construction, and operation of aqueducts, canals, fountains, and sewers. Advances were made in the study of the atmosphere and barometric pressure notably the air pump of Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke.\n\nTimeline\n\nBCE\n\nMesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China\n\nc. 3400 – first numeral system, and a system of weights and measures.
