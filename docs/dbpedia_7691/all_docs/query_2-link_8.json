The issue of women in mathematics has been a recent political and social hot topic in the mathematical community. As thematic foci we place a double comparison: besides shedding light on differences and similarities in several European countries, we complete this investigation by comparing the developments of women studies from the beginnings. This shall lead to new results on tradition and suggest improvements on the present situation. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010): 01A55, 01A60, 01A70, 01A80. Introduction by the Organisers The aim of the workshop was to build a bridge between research on the situation of women in mathematics at the beginning of coeducative studies and the current circumstances in academia. The issue of women in mathematics has been a recent political and social hot topi...\n\nIn this paper, I follow trails of the auto/biographical turn in the field of gender and science, particularly focusing on women mathematicians' epistolary narratives. The paper emerges from a wider Leverhulme funded project of writing a feminist genealogy of «automathographies», tracing women mathematicians' historical emergence as subjects of scientific knowledge, as well as creators of philosophy and culture. What I argue is that letters are important auto/biographical documents in illuminating women's epistemological and intellectual involvement in the making of scientific knowledge, which included the development of mathematical sciences, but was also expanded in the wider cultural formations of the European modernity. In doing so, I deploy the notion of «epistolary sensibility» as a methodological and epistemological approach to archival research with women mathematicians' letters.\n\nThis chapter is based on interviews with four women mathematicians who made a research career in mathematics in Denmark from the mid-twentieth century on. Through semi-structured research interviews, we try to capture and pass on glimpses of strategies and experiences in their lives. The four interviewees represent the very few women who achieved faculty positions in a male-dominated field at the universities in Denmark. Their personal stories, in addition to being admirable examples of academic achievement, become stories of how they navigated and succeeded in a society without apparent or fixed solutions for ambitious working women and mothers—and of how they later in life reflected on their choices and options. Their stories are both about women receiving an atypical education in a male-dominated field and about pursuing and succeeding in having a career and a family during a period of change in social values and possibilities for women. In the chapter, we focus on their stories ...\n\nA common theme in accounts of choosing mathematics is that of persistence in the face of troubles or difficulties which are often associated with the structuring effects of gender, class, culture and ethnicity. Centring on an analysis of one woman's account of becoming a mathematician, we build on our understanding of multiple and developing identities with the aim of capturing the nature of individual challenge to structuring discourses and its implications for choice and participation in mathematics more generally. Inspecting how she talks about events in the past, present, and future, we expand on Leont'ev's (1978, 1981) notion of leading activity to explore how we organise and prioritise activities (and their related identities) within the context of Holland et al.'s (1998) theory of identity in practice, hybridity and world-making. We interrogate the part played by contradiction in creating a space for individual agency through its resolution in hybrid practices and its relation to social change, exploring how our informant narrates taking up mathematics \" against the odds \" as part of an ongoing process of \" rewriting \" herself into new imagined worlds. In providing an insight into how one individual envisages and enacts a different mathematics culture in which she can have a place, our analysis suggests ways forward in creating new, more inclusive, mathematics education.\n\nPurpose – Finding reference sources on women in mathematics can be challenging. With the increasing interest in encouraging women to go into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)-related careers, there is a need for a list of recommended resources in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – An exhaustive literature review was performed on books addressing women in math that were published in the last 15 years. Findings – An exhaustive literature review was performed on books and online reference material addressing women in math that were published in the last 15 years. Research limitations/implications – These resources are mainly useful as places to begin research on women and mathematics. This list is not designed to be comprehensive. Originality/value – This annotated bibliography will be helpful to librarians interested in helping others understand the challenges women face in STEM careers, specifically mathematics."
