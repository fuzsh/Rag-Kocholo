        "text": "What were the real nature and role of the annus mirabilis, 1905, in Physics? In this paper we discuss in a historical perspective Planck’s and Einstein’s contributions as the fundamental steps in the scientific transformations (the latter with a sharper sense of methodological awareness) that led from the mechanistic and reductionist approach of 19 th century physics to the fulfillment of the formal revolution of quantum mechanics. This process underwent with further scientific breaks, in the context of the social and economic situation and the corresponding role of science.The mechanistic approach adopted in physics at the end of the 19 th century not only produced difficulties and contradictions, but resulted in the limitation of further scientific development. Chemists were the first, at that time, to perceive such limits, and introduce a thermodynamic approach, whose role in the revolution in physics must be underlined. Planck was the first physicist to introduce a procedure tha...\n\nThe philosopher-Physicists centers on the origins of modern mathematical physics developed primarily by Maxwell and Helmholtz. In alternate chapters, the contributions of the principals are placed in the context of the prevailing discourses and controversies in physics and philosophy. Cultural contexts, such as art (e.g. the pre-Raphaelites), literature (e.g. romanticism) and historical events (e.g. the revolutions of 1848 and the Franco-Prussian war) are presented. Contemporaries, such as Boltzmann, Gibbs, Oersted, and Riemann in mathematical physics, and Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Frege in philosophy are considered. The last chapters deal with the influence of the work of Maxwell and Helmholtz on the developments in 20 th century mathematical physics, focusing on the origins of quantum mechanics. The theme of the arguments is in the influence of Kantian epistemology and metaphysics on the authors. The epilogue examines the work of Arthur Compton as founded on Maxwell's electrodynamics and field theory and Helmholtz' concept of energy (all modified by Einstein), and Boltzmann's Statistical Mechanics. It highlights the difficulties of modern wave-particle dualism inherent on their dependence on the mathematical formalism and on innovations of the principals. The arguments are paraphrased with a minimum of both scientific and philosophical technical terminology, and there is no mathematical notation. This is to make the work accessible to non-specialists, typically at the undergraduate level.\n\ntheories of modern physics, and the increasingly mathematical arguments used in their development, has led some to see the success of modern physics to seem mysterious or even magical. Looking at the development of equations in quantum theory, Steiner (1998) has argued that as a result of their being developed using various kinds of mathematical, rather than physical, analogy, their significant success in applications presents a challenge to a naturalistic explanation of the applicability of mathematics. The challenge to naturalism is supposed to come as a result of mathematics being anthropocentric. I will argue in a later section that this argument is problematic for several reasons, which are evident once we better appreciate how mathematical theories of nature are developed out of experience. The successful application of the theories of modern physics cannot be properly understood through a consideration of their development alone; one must also examine the process of developme...\n\nThere were two philosophical breakthroughs that were made during the first decades of the 17th century. One was in the theory of knowledge, or epistemology, which was initiated by Francis Bacon. Another breakthrough was made by Galileo Galilei, in the subject of being and becoming, or of metaphysics. What we call science today appears to me to be the fruit of those two remarkable philosophical breakthroughs. I present a case for this claim."
