        "text": "Janis S. Rimshans, Doctor of Mathematical Sciences (Dr.Sc.Math.), Professor, Latvian mathematician and physicist, rector of the Liepaja University, Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Information Technology, Head of the &quot;Mathematical modeling hydrodynamics&quot; Laboratory in the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences of the University of Latvia, died January 11, 2015. Professor Janis S. Rimshans was a very pure soul. His main trait was boundless kindness to everything: to the people, to animals, to plants and to nature in general. This trait was so strong in Janis S. Rimshans that it was impossible to stay &quot;unpurified&quot; while talking with him even for 10- 15 minutes, no matter what state of mind you had before. Janis S. Rimshans vainly dreamed for learning to say &quot;no&quot; and refuse people if they approached him with requests, fulfilling of which often caused an obvious material and/or moral damage both personally and indirectly to Jan...\n\nThis article concerns the life and work of Lucjan Emil Boettcher (1872-1937), a Polish mathematician born in Warsaw and active in Lvov. Besides biographical and bibliographical information, it contains a survey of his mathematical achievements in the theory of iteration and holomorphic dynamics and an outline of further developments of the topics he initiated. Some documents are presented for the first time."
