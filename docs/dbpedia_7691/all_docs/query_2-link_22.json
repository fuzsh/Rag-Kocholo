        "text": "<strong>Karl</strong> <strong>Theodor</strong> <strong>Wilhelm</strong> <strong>Weierstrass</strong> Born: 31 Oct 1815 in Ostenfelde, Westphalia (now Germany) Died: 19 Feb 1897 in Berlin, Germany <strong>Karl</strong> <strong>Weierstrass</strong>'s father, <strong>Wilhelm</strong> <strong>Weierstrass</strong>, was secretary to the mayor of Ostenfelde at the time of <strong>Karl</strong>'s birth. <strong>Wilhelm</strong> <strong>Weierstrass</strong> was a well educated man who had a broad knowledge of the arts and of the sciences. He certainly was well capable of attaining higher positions than he did, and this attitude may have been one of the reasons that <strong>Karl</strong> <strong>Weierstrass</strong>'s early career was in posts well below his outstanding ability. <strong>Weierstrass</strong>'s mother was <strong>Theodor</strong>a Vonderforst and <strong>Karl</strong> was the eldest of <strong>Theodor</strong>a and <strong>Wilhelm</strong>'s four children, none of whom married. <strong>Wilhelm</strong> <strong>Weierstrass</strong> became a tax inspector when <strong>Karl</strong> was eight years old. This job involved him in only spending short periods in any one place so <strong>Karl</strong> frequently moved from school to school as the family moved around Prussia. In 1827 <strong>Karl</strong>'s mother <strong>Theodor</strong>a died and one year later his father <strong>Wilhelm</strong> remarried. By 1829 <strong>Wilhelm</strong> <strong>Weierstrass</strong> had become an assistant at the main tax office in Paderborn, and <strong>Karl</strong> entered the Catholic Gymnasium there. <strong>Weierstrass</strong> excelled at the Gymnasium despite having to take on a part-time job as a bookkeeper to help out the family finances. While at the Gymnasium <strong>Weierstrass</strong> certainly reached a level of mathematical competence far beyond what would have been expected. He regularly read Crelle's Journal and gave mathematical tuition to one of his brothers. However <strong>Weierstrass</strong>'s father wished him to study finance and so, after graduating from the Gymnasium in 1834, he entered the University of Bonn with a course planned out for him which included the study of law, finance and economics. With the career in the Prussian administration that was planned for him by his father, this was indeed a well designed course. However, <strong>Weierstrass</strong> suffered from the conflict of either obeying his father's wishes or studying the subject he loved, namely mathematics. The result of the conflict which went on inside <strong>Weierstrass</strong> was that he did not attend either the mathematics lectures or the lectures of his planned course. He reacted to the conflict inside him by pretending that he did not care about his studies, and he spent four years of intensive fencing and drinking. As Biermann writes in [1]:- ... the conflict between duty and inclination led to physical and mental strain. He tried, in vain, to overcome his problems by participating in carefree student life ... He did study mathematics on his own, however, reading Laplace's Mécanique céleste and then a work by Jacobi on elliptic functions. He came to understand the necessary methods in elliptic function theory by studying transcripts of lectures by Gudermann. In a letter to Lie, written nearly 50 years later, he explained how he came to make the definite decision to study mathematics despite his father's wishes around this time (see [1]):- ... when I became aware of [a letter from Abel to Legendre] in Crelle's Journal during my student years, [it] was of the utmost importance. The immediate derivation of the form of the representation of the function given by Abel ..., from the differential equation defining this function, was the first mathematical task I set myself; and its fortunate solution made me determined to devote myself wholly to mathematics; I made this decision in my seventh semester ... <strong>Weierstrass</strong> had made a decision to become a mathematician but he was still supposed to be on a course studying public finance and administration. After his decision, he spent one further semester at the University of Bonn, his eighth semester ending in 1838, and having failed to study the subjects he was enrolled for he simply left the University without taking the examinations. <strong>Weierstrass</strong>'s father was desperately upset by his son giving"
