        "text": "This is far more than just a Photo Album. Many\n\ninteresting things about mathematics and astronomy are also shown and discussed below.\n\nHere are Professors George Andrews, Jocelyn Quaintance and Henry Gould at WVU in September 2007:\n\nBelow, an old photo of H. W. Gould and L. C. Hsu:\n\nPhoto of Professors H. W. Gould and L. C. Hsu (徐利治) at West Virginia University, circa 1980.\n\nOn the wall are a photo of Prof. John A. Eiesland (1867-1950), Chair of WVU Math. Dept.\n\n1907-1938, who was born in Norway; and a portrait of Niels H. Abel (1802-1829), the very\n\nfamous Norwegian mathematician. Leetsch C. Hsu wrote to Gould in 1965, seven years before\n\nNixon's memorable trip to China to meet Chairman Mao. Hsu and Gould began a collaboration\n\nand published a seminal paper on a generalized series inversion pair in the Duke Mathematical\n\nJournal, Vol. 40(1973), pp. 885-891. The paper appeared just after relations between USA and\n\nPRC were re-established.\n\nProfessor Leetsch Charles Hsu (徐利治) at West Virginia University in mid-1970's.\n\nThe sign in Chinese (Chung Mei liang guo ren-min peng-you wan-sui) says\n\n\"Long live the friendship of the Chinese and American People.\"\n\nWVU Magazine article (Fall 1972) photo of Prof. Gould writing Chinese\n\non blackboard, circa 1972. It says \"Quotation from President Harlow:\n\n'Long live West Virginia'.\" (Xi fu-ji-ni-yah wan-sui!)\n\nAmbikeshwar Sharma and Paul Erdös at West Virginia University circa 1986-89.\n\nPhoto by H. W. Gould. Uncle Paul visited WVU three times (3-5 March 1986;\n\n4-6 April 1987; and 28-31 March 1989). Ambikeshwar visited several times. He was a professor many years at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.\n\nThis is the original Half-Professor Charlie Brown (1970-1981), shown relaxing at home.\n\nHe was given his title by then University President James G. Harlow. Dr. Harlow told\n\nme: \"Henry you are a Full Professor; I like your little dog Charlie Brown, and I hereby\n\nmake him a Half Professor. I can't give him a higher title, because then the State would\n\nhave to pay him benefits!\" Charlie was mostly beagle, could count to 10, and had 10 years\n\nof classes at WVU. His successor is Half-Professor Spotsie Ann, a Jack Russell Terrier.\n\nBesides many canine friends, Gould has been surrounded by many feline assistants, and\n\none of them was a 20-year-old black Siamese named Kahlil Gibran who liked to sleep\n\nwrapped up in Gould's hair. Kahlil passed away 8 April 2010 due to renal failure. Spotsie Ann is now 16 years old. In April 2009 Spotsie was ill with Canine Geriatric Vestbulitis Syndrome, and took 3 weeks to recover. The etiology of this disease (affecting dogs around 12 to 16 years old) is not completely understood, It causes nystigma (roaming of eyes) and general ataxia (trouble with body movements and balance). No cure is know, but dogs do recover. Spotsie did recover, with an after-effect of a tilt to her left side. She has had a second bout with it in March 2010, and is again recovering. Vestibulitis, a disease of the inner ear, may also affect children and adults. Unfortunately Spotsie developed other difficulties and died on 14 Sept. 2010.\n\nBelow is Professor Gould with Half-Professor Charlie Brown during office hours in 1975.\n\nAt one time Gould had a career in broadcast radio as announcer and engineer. Here he is\n\nat the microphone in 1949 at radio station WUVA, the student station at the University\n\nof Virginia. He ran a three hour program of classical music. Also he rebuilt the transmitter\n\nto get more power output and a better signal for the station.\n\nWhile he played LP classical music records on the air, he worked\n\nout proofs of combinatorial identities! Mozart makes good Math.\n\nHenry (Hank) Gould at his shortwave ham station K4CQA in 1957\n\nat the University of North Carolina. He contacted all U. S. states and\n\nover 100 countries using Morse code on the 40 and 20 meter bands. This\n\nequipment was used to monitor the first 3 Soviet sputnik satellites.\n\nphoto by Harvey Diamond\n\nHenry and Jean Gould at Henry's 'first' seventy-fifth birthday party on 26 August 2003.\n\nphoto by Harvey Diamond\n\nGroup of faculty at Gould's 75th birthday party. Note attentive Half-Professor Spotsie Ann!\n\nphoto by H. W. Gould\n\nArchimedean Screw, built by Joshua Taylorfor demonstration in\n\nMath. 218, History of Mathematics Class, April 2006. Device invented\n\n2000 years ago by Archimedes for raising water to a higher level.\n\nIt would be simply colossal for enterprising WVU students to devise\n\nsuch a device to pump beer up from a tub up into cups at beer pong\n\nparties! It could be called a BEER SCREW!\n\n\"See, he has two eyes, but if he crosses them he'll be minus one.\"\n\n(i times i equals -1) - - Cartoon drawn by Paul Louis Goodfriend\n\nwhen we were high school students in 1945. Goodfriend (1930-1995) became a chemist and taught at the University of Maine, Orono, Maine. In 1945-46 he, Bernard Brown and I extracted Uranium from glass used in the manufacture of neon signs.\n\nGarfield tells all about Research!\n\nWhen you espy a mathematician somewhat drowsy,\n\nhe is not really sleeping he is doing mental research.\n\nphoto by H. W. Gould\n\nThis is a view of some remains of the 7-foot refracting telecope\n\nbought for WVU in 1872 by Prof. Samuel G. Stevens. It was made\n\nin NYC by John Byrne, successor to Henry Fitz. WVU students\n\nburned the old observatory down in Nov. 1919 to celebrate\n\nWVU beating Princeton University in football by 25 to zilch.\n\nThe telescope itself was rescued by Professor Eiesland, only to be\n\ndestroyed in another fire c.1950 when the old Mechanical Hall\n\nburned. Oldtimers have told me about going up to \"Observatory\n\nHill\" in 1910 to see Halley's comet. The Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKA)\n\nFraternity house was erected in 1965 on the exact spot where the\n\nobservatory once stood. I remember seeing a 13 foot diameter ring\n\nof burned earth at that spot when the PIKA was being built. A large\n\nsteel rod was found sticking up from the ground at the center; most\n\nlikely being a rigid center to which the telescope was anchored.\n\nThe burned remains of the observatory had been removed around\n\n1931 by a WPA crew, and the spot remained clear until the PIKA\n\nhouse was built.\n\nphoto by H. W. Gould\n\nHere is another view of some remaining parts of the 1872 telescope,\n\nshowing rack and pinion focus part and the end that held a 5-inch\n\nlens with 7 foot focal length. It had mahogany strips for the barrel.\n\nIt is hoped to make a new lens and resurrect this ancient instrument.\n\nThe telescope cost Professor Stevens $400.00 from his own pocket.\n\nThe University had no money for equipment, so he bought it himself,\n\nhaving convinced the University to let him teach an extra class for\n\n$400.00.\n\nJames Scott Stewart\n\nJames Scott Stewart was Head of WVU Mathematics Department\n\nfrom 1891-93 and 1894-1907. He was trained at West Virginia, the\n\nfirst civilian and the last before Eiesland arrived in 1907 (see below).\n\nCuriously enough, Robert Allen Armstrong, Professor of English,\n\nwas Head of WVU Mathematics for 1893-1894, a period when James\n\nScott Stewart was improperly relieved of his duties, but then reinstated.\n\nThis has happened when Jerome Raymond was WVU President.\n\nStewart had a home on Willey Street precisely where the present West\n\nVirginia Junior College stands. He also served as University Librarian.\n\nToday WVU Mathematics is housed in Armstrong Hall. (more below)\n\nSome interesting information about the life of James Stewart may\n\nbe found at the following website:\n\nhttp://homepages.rootsweb.com/~usbios/Ohio/bios/jefferson/jsstewart.txt\n\n= = = = = = =\n\nFrom 1867 to 1891 the War Department assigned a military officer to be\n\nCommandant of Cadets and Professor of Military Science and Tactics at\n\nWest Virginia University. This was the standard procedure at Land Grant\n\nSchools in America. WVU was poor, so they had the military man also teach\n\nmathematics. In 1877-1878, WVU had an excellent military math. teacher\n\nby the name of Lt. James Monroe Ingalls. W. Va. Senator Waitman T.\n\nWilley tried to get U. S. President Rutherford B. Hayes to allow Ingalls to\n\nstay at WVU, but Hayes said he could nothing, as he was only the President\n\nand could not over-rule the War Department. (WVU has the letter from Hayes)\n\nIngalls went on to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, where he founded the U. S. Army\n\nBallistics School. He published major papers and tables for exterior ballistics\n\nwhich have been extremely important, even today.\n\nIngalls was very keen to recognize and support mathematics. While Ingalls\n\nwas at WVU, James Joseph Sylvester founded the American Journal\n\nof Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in 1877-78. Major Ingalls was\n\nlisted as one of the very first 100 subscribers to this extremely important\n\nnew journal and in this small way a mathematician at West Virginia University\n\naided in the support of the first important American mathematics journal.\n\nJOHNNY EIESLAND\n\nThis is Johan Arndt Eiesland (1867-1950) who was WVU Math. Head\n\n1907-1938. He was from Norway, received his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins\n\nin 1898. He was the first significant mathematician in West Virginia\n\ndirecting the first two Ph.D.'s here in 1934. He was also one of the first\n\nbrain drains from Norway, as explained in a 2005 paper in Norway by\n\nProfessor Trygve Breiteig. WVU named a building for Eiesland. We occupied\n\nEiesland Hall for eighteen years.We once had a memorial to him in our\n\nMathematics Research Library in our present quarters in Armstrong\n\nHall, but it was discontinued when the Library was eliminated. Eiesland's late\n\nniece Miss Mary Jo Mitchell left modest funds to establish an Eiesland Visiting\n\nProfessorship in Mathematics.\n\nRemark: \"Eiesland\" is a Norwegian name NOT German. WVU people and\n\nstudents spell it incorrectly and mispronounce it as if it were \"Eisland. It is NOT\n\nICE-land. Johnny Eiesland himself pronounced his name as \"AZE-land\". You get\n\nan A if you spell it right and say it right and teach it to everyone you meet!\n\n(The combination \"eie\"is rare in German except in \"Eier\" meaning \"eggs\").\n\nA short story about Eiesland by Professor Trygve Breiteig of Adger University\n\nCollege, Kristiansand, Norway, has been published on pp. 23-24 of the Spring 2006\n\nissue of the Eberly College Magazine (WVU). This is a very brief adaptation\n\nfrom Professor Breiteig's longer article appearing in a Norwegian book discussing\n\n100 years of science in Norway.\n\nWe interrupt our sequence of WVU math. chairs to show one of Eiesland's\n\nfavorite pictures, a portrait of the famous Norwegian mathematician Niels\n\nHenrik Abel. The original was a heliotpe of a drawing done by Johan Görbitz\n\nin Paris in 1826. Görbitz (1782-1853) was a noted Norwegian artist who\n\nlived in Bergen, Norway. Eiesland kept this portrait near his desk. Abelian\n\ngroups were named for Abel of course.\n\nNiels Henrik Abel (1802-1829)\n\n\"Weierstrass satte Abels arbeider overordentlig\n\nhØit; han gav alltid det räd til sine elever:\n\n'Laes Abel!' \" quoted by Carl StØrmer in the Norsk\n\nMatematisk Tidskrift, Vol. 11(1929), page 137.\n\n[Translation: Weierstrass placed Abel's work very\n\nhigh; he always gave the advice to his students:\n\n'Read Abel.']\n\nClarence Newton Reynolds, Jr.\n\n(1890-1954) Head of WVU Mathematics Departmenrt, 1938-1946. He\n\nwas at first a student of Maxime Bocher at Harvard. After Bocher's death,\n\nReynolds took his Ph.D. under G. D. Birkhoff, and spent the rest of his\n\nlife at WVU trying to prove the Four Color Conjecture. In two papers in the\n\nAnnals of Mathematics in 1926-1927 Reynolds was able to use clsassical\n\nreduction techniques to prove that four colors suffice for all maps having\n\nno more than 28 countries. This was one of the best results until 1976\n\nwhen Kenneth Appell, Wolfgang Haken and graduate student John Koch\n\nused computers and new techniques to prove the theorem that 4 colors always\n\nsuffice. Reynolds had joyously told a friend of mine (retired Professor Wilbur\n\nBluhm) who had been a student at WVU circa 1946, that he had proved the\n\n4CC, but it is said that Philip Franklin found an error in the proof. I have not\n\nbeen able to find the manuscript in his posthumous papers, so it remains\n\nunknown whether he was onto something. He did leave a large table of\n\n'topologically applicable number-theoretic functions', but no evidence how\n\nthis might have been applied. He gave a talk about this at the 1950\n\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians at Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nReynolds patented a 'Relativity Slide Rule' in the 1910 to 1920 period that\n\nshows how Einstein's addition of velocities operates. I have his large,\n\nworking classroom model, a wooden device about six feet long. He\n\npublished a paper about this in the old Bulletin of the West Virginia University\n\nScientific Association, Vol. 2(1923), pp. 3-11, showing how to construct and\n\noperate it. A photo of this device is displayed here:\n\nHere is the four foot long wooden working model of the Relativity\n\nSlide Rule invented by Professor C. N. Reynolds.\n\nRemark: I shall never forget my own excitement when Frank Bernhart\n\ntold me in 1976 about the amazing new and correct proof of the 4CC! This\n\nevent was a highlight of our conversation at the AMS Summer Meeting at\n\nToronto, Canada in August 1976. But wouldn't it be comforting to find an\n\nold-fashioned proof we could check easily?\n\nHannibal Albert Davis\n\n(1899-1992) Hannibal A. Davis was Head of WVU Mathematics 1946-1960.\n\nHe did his Ph.D. in classical geometry under Virgil Snyder at Cornell Univ.\n\nHe directed the third of the early WVU mathematics Ph.D. degrees in 1940,\n\nhis student being Allen B. Cunningham. As with almost all the faculty at WVU\n\nbetween 1907 and 1950 he worked on Cremona transformations and other\n\nnon-involutorial transformations. Work in these areas at WVU reached zero\n\nby 1950 as topology was on the ascendancy in American mathematics.\n\n(Reynolds was an exception at WVU, being primarly a topologist.)\n\n(The author of this web page was hired by Davis in 1958, and it was he who\n\nurged me to seek support by way of an NSF research grant.\n\nTo my doubt about being able to get a such a grant, Hannibal quipped:\n\n\"You'll never know unless you try!\" That was excellent advice!)\n\nRemark: Hannibal and his wife Tyreeca were both mathematicians but also\n\nwere botanists and internationally known for their study and collections\n\nof genus rubus (raspberry bushes).\n\nJoseph Kyle Stewart (1906-1987)\n\nJoe Stewart was Head of WVU Mathematics 1960-1965. He was the first\n\nmath. Ph.D. to graduate at WVU (in 1934) having worked under Eiesland.\n\nHe also was Associate Dean of the Graduate School. He did some work\n\nwith WVU physicists involving vibrations of Chladni plates, which\n\ninvolved Bessel functions.\n\nIn the same year (1934) Reginald Horton Downing (from Nova Scotia)\n\n(1908-1987) received a Ph.D. under Eiesland's direction. Downing was Math.\n\nChair at the Air Force Institute of Technology and Dean there for most of his\n\ncareer starting in 1947 and retiring in 1974.\n\nSee the following web page for more information about Reggie Downing:\n\nhttp://www.afit-aog.org/downing.html\n\nIland Dee Peters\n\nI. Dee Peters (1919-1990). Dee Peters was acting chair of WVU Mathematics,\n\n1965-67 and 1972-73, and regular chair 1973-79. His interests were modern\n\nalgebra and improving the teaching of mathematics.\n\nJames Clifton Eaves (1912-2002)\n\nJ. C. Eaves came to West Virginia from the University of Kentucky,\n\nand was Chair of Math at WVU, 1967-1972, also holding a Centennial\n\nProfessorship. Eaves was National Director of the Pi Mu Epsilon mathematics\n\nhonorary. He worked in linear algebra and matrices.\n\n= = = = = = =\n\nThis marks the last of our initial series of photos of WVU Math. chairs.\n\n= = = = = = =\n\nA S T R O N O M Y\n\nHere is the late Professor Charles (Chuck)\n\nNelson Cochran (1923-2000) of the WVU Mathematics Department, who taught astronomy,\n\nand who was the principal Founder in 1963 of the\n\nNational Youth Science Camp held every\n\nsummer at Greenbank, WV.\n\nTwo students from each of the 50 states come to this camp\n\nevery summer. In 1963 WVU Student Roger Mersing and\n\nI obtained 200 3-inch glass disks and optical abrasive from\n\nthe Houze Glass Plant in Pt. Marion, Pennsylvania, and each\n\nYouth Camp student was shown how to grind a telescope mirror.\n\nRoger Mersing (1941-2009) took a degree in physics at WVU and later worked with NASA,\n\nHe will always be remembered for his vast enthusiasm for astronomy and his wonderful personality.\n\nBelow is a photo of the present WVU observatory located on top\n\nof Hodges Hall (Physics Building).\n\nIt houses a 14-inch Schmidt Cassegrain reflector. In Hodges Hall we also have the\n\nexcellent Tomchin Memorial Planetarium, which offers hundreds of shows all year.\n\nThe telescope and observatory were made possible by gifts of Harold Tomchin (1915-1999).\n\nInitial contact with Tomchin was made by Prof. Wilbur H. Bluhm (1920-2008) (math.) and\n\nProf. H. W. Gould. (Tomchin owned a furniture company in southern W. Va.)\n\nphoto by H. W. Gould\n\nCurrent WVU Observatory\n\n= = = = = = =\n\nNow let's go back a hundred years:\n\nHere below is a view of the original WVU Observatory circa 1905.\n\nThis is from a glass plate negative found by August Mastrogiuseppe\n\nin the WVU Wise Library around 1965. The photo was classified\n\nthen incorrectly as \"WVU Silo\". The gentleman sitting at the right\n\nis unknown. As we indicated previously above, the old observatory\n\nwas built in 1901 and burned by students in 1919 to celebrate WVU\n\nbeating Princeton in football by 25 to 0.\n\nOriginal WVU Observatory circa 1905\n\n= = = = = = =\n\nNow we go back just 42 years to an astronomy club:\n\nThis is a view of the Morgantown Astronomy Club on 10 February 1967.

Sr., Prof. Virgil Peterson, and\n\nDavid L. Smith (who took the photograph).\n\nThe club existed from 1965 until around 1980. Over 100 people were members and they had around 40 telescopes among them, Two students had spent a long time grinding and polishing 8 and 10 inch mirrors for their own telescopes. This photo was at the home of the late Arthur Dale Randolph.\n\n= = = = = = =\n\nNow . . . some administrative humor:\n\nphoto by H. W.

In center, in blue suit,\n\nis the then WVU President Neil Bucklew, flanked by Gary and Gary's wife Debbie, who\n\nis also a mathematician. At far right is Prof. Sam B. Nadler, Jr., Gary's dissertation\n\nadviser. Since 1992 we have graduated at least 34 Ph.D students. Our Department\n\nhas considerable strength in discrete mathematics (combinatorics and graph theory),\n\nnumber theory, continuum and hyperspace theory, and other developing areas.\n\nThe current doctoral program came about when Alphonse Baartmans was Chair\n\ncirca 1982-85. He had me initiate a regular seminar on combinatorics and discrete\n\nmathematics, which has met almost every Wednesday during the regular academic year\n\never since, bringing in numerous excellent speakers. For example we had Paul\n\nErdös here three different years. I also remember teaching our first graph theory course.\n\nThe current Seminar Director is Prof. John Goldwasser.\n\nNext we cannot forget to show a recent happy moment:\n\nphoto by H. W.

Most were made in Germany in the nineteenth\n\ncentury, and are still very useful in teaching and research.\n\nphoto by H. W. Gould\n\nThis is a very old string model of a cone. It is shown\n\ntwisted around so as to show a hyperboloid as a ruled\n\nsurface with two generators.\n\nI have a model (to show here later) which I built in 1958\n\nfor Prof. Hannibal Davis showing a twisted cubic, which\n\nis a curve in 3-space formed when two cones intersect\n\nin a common generator. From one viewpoint it looks\n\nlike a cubic curve and from another like a parabola.\n\nT E S S E R A C T The author likes to make models for classroom use. Here is a simple wire model of a tesseract,\n\na three dimensional projection of a cube extended to four dimensions. . . . Imagine a room now\n\nand the same room an hour later. Of course we cannot show four mutually perpendicular lines\n\nin 3-space. think of length, width, height, and time.\n\nMysterium Cosmographicum\n\nKepler's first model of the solar system in which he ingeniously used\n\nthe five Platonic solids circumscribed with spheres to show the orbits\n\nof the planets. With the discovery of new planets and eccentricities\n\nof the orbits he had to abandon this model and was then led to his\n\nthree famous laws of planetary motion.\n\nSunflower pattern. 55 spirals in one direction\n\nand 89 in the other direction.

I offer below an example of such a connection. Here is a poster\n\nannouncing a mathematical lecture by the famous Metropolitan Opera star Jerome Hines:\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nSeminar on Combinatorial and Discrete Mathematics\n\nSpecial Lecture Announcement\n\nMr. Jerome Hines\n\nMetropolitan Opera Basso\n\nwill give a lecture on\n\nOperator Mathematics\n\nFriday 7 October 1994, at 3:30 PM,\n\n324 Armstrong Hall, Refreshments at 3:00 P.M.\n\nMr. Hines will later be heard in an Operatic Concert at West\n\nVirginia University on Saturday 8 October.\n\nMr. Hines sang here in Morgantown on Sunday 6 February 1994. His opera fans may not all know that Jerry majored\n\nin chemistry and mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles, before going on to his world-famous career as\n\nan opera singer. His operatic repertoire covers some 30 different roles, singing at the New York Metropolitan Opera,\n\nMilan's La Scala, and the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre. In his book \"This is My Story, This is My Song\", published in 1968,\n\nhe wrote:\n\n\"With my parents' blessing I went to the University of California at Los Angeles to study chemistry. As my studies progressed I began taking extra courses by examination, in addition to my regular curriculum, which enabled me to pick up enough extra credits to acquire a double major. And what was the extra subject? Mathematics! The very subject in which I had done so poorly in junior high. It had now taken a place of immense importance in my studies because of its necessity in science, and I was growing to enjoy it more than any of my other academic pursuits.\"\n\nMr. Hines published several papers on operator mathematics and has maintained his interest and activity with this\n\nsubject over the years. He loves music, mathematics and people, and it is a distinct pleasure to welcome him to our community and have him share with us his immense enthusiasm for mathematics as well as music.\n\nHenry W. Gould\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nNote: Jerome Hines was born 8 Nov. 1921 and died 4 Feb. 2003. he was blessed with a marvelous basso voice, and\n\nhe had a lifelong love of music, mathematics and people. He actually wrote a paper about generalized Stirling numbers\n\nthat was published in the Mathematics Magazine, vol. 29(1956), No. 4, March-April, pp.200-203, at the very time I\n\nwas myself writing a master's thesis on these numbers. At the time he sang here at WVU and gave the lecture announced\n\nabove, he was writing a very long book on \"Infinite Numbers.\" Jerry and I had planned to revise this for publication, and\n\nthis project may yet eventually be accomplished. His mathematical mentor in California was Professor William M.\n\nWhyburn at UCLA. Curiously enough I also knew Professor Whyburn myself years later (1957) when I studied at the\n\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N. C. after Whyburn had moved there. My father had an excellent voice, and\n\nmy uncle William Benjamin Gould was a tenor singing here and in Europe, Dad took me to hear Jerry Hines sing many\n\nyears ago. Hines was tne mentor of batoneinger/theologian Joseph Shore, who has collected recordings of\n\nJerome Hines and plced them on YouTube.\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nHere is a quick view of Gould's file card index of\n\n30,000 file cards on the mathematics literature:\n\nThis index is arranged by topics: Binomial Sums, Bernoulli Numbers,\n\nStirling Numbers, Bell Numbers, Catalan Numbers, Biographies,\n\nWVU Math. Dept. History (from 1867), etcetera. These file cards\n\ninclude data such as author, title, journal, date, etc. and include\n\ninformation such as abstracts, reviews, and so on. The file system\n\nwas begun around 1948. Also a very partial index of my library of\n\nseveral thousand mathematics books and journals.\n\n= = = = = = =\n\nProfessor Gould shows a copy of the rare 1796 book by C. F. Hindenburg concerning\n\npartitions to Professor George E. Andrews, Eiesland Visiting Professor Jocelyn Quaintance\n\nand Henry's wife Jean. 20 September 2007\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nHenry Gould and George Andrews discuss compositions\n\nand partitions. Professor Andrews gave a Colloqium talk\n\non \"Gould's function and some partition problems.\"\n\n20 September 2007\n\nProfessor Andrews is the Evan Pugh Professor of Mathematics\n\nat Penn State University. He is a member of the National\n\nAcademy of Sciences and is the President-Elect of the\n\nAmerican Mathematical Society. Andrews is a noted expert\n\non partition theory and the work of Srinivasa Ramanujan.\n\nDot Underwood, Assistant to W. Va. Governor Joe Manchin, presents\n\nHonorary Mountaineer Award to Professor Gould, 20 September 2007,\n\nin recognition of Gould's 49 years of service and scholarship at West\n\nVirginia University.\n\nThe late Professor Wilbur H. Bluhm (22 Jan. 1920 - 15 Nov. 2008) at his desk at home surrounded by\n\nhis large library of several thousand mathematics and philosophy books. Bluhm took his master's degree\n\nat West Virginia University in 1946 and did further graduate work at Columbia University. He taught\n\nmathematics at Waynesburg College (1947-82); then taught mathematics and astronomy at West Virginia\n\nUniversity (1982-89). He knew WVU's Prof. Clarence N. Reynolds, Jr. who often shared with Bluhm his\n\nlove of research and his work trying to prove the Four Color Map Conjecture. As noted above it was\n\nBluhm's contact with Harold Tomchin (1915-1999) that led to WVU getting a large telescope and a new observatory. Professor Bluhm was a vast repository of knowledge about mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, language and ancient Biblical exegesis. He will be missed.\n\nThe old WVU Mathematics Research Library:\n\nGeneral view of the current journal shelves in the former WVU Mathematics Library (Photo by Gould)\n\nStudent studying in the old WVU Mathematics Library as it appeared before 2008 when\n\nthe space was turned into an undergraduate computer study hall with 150 computers.\n\nThe student in this photo is Mrs. Jean W. Gould, wife of Prof. Henry W. Gould\n\nSeveral hundred current journal issues were always displayed, and hundreds of journals\n\nwere available for immediate browsing, some dating back to 1826 and earlier.\n\n(Photo by H. W.
