        "text": "The Department of Mathematics offers programs leading to the degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics and in Applied Mathematics. Students may opt for the Concentration in Computational Mathematics, which is attached to the program in applied mathematics. The Concentration in Interdisciplinary Mathematics (MAI) is available to Ph.D. students in either Mathematics or Applied Mathematics. It is not available to Masters Students. Joint research endeavors with industrial and governmental partners are facilitated and encouraged. The Department of Mathematics also offers a Certificate.\n\nMaster of Science Requirements\n\nThe M.S. degree requires a minimum of 30 credit hours with courses chosen to satisfy certain requirements to cover material from three different areas in the department, and some level of depth of material.\n\nPh.D. Requirements\n\nThe Ph.D. requires a minimum of 72 credit hours. A student will typically take 50-60 semester hours of course credits for the Ph.D. The written preliminary examination consists of examinations in three areas of mathematics chosen by the student from 12 possibilities. The research dissertation should represent a substantial contribution to an area of mathematics or its applications.\n\nStudent Financial Support\n\nTeaching assistantships and some research assistantships are available. Teaching assistants benefit from a structured program of training in university-level teaching.\n\nMore Information\n\nMathematics Program Website\n\nAdmissions Requirements\n\nApplicants for admission should have an undergraduate or Master's degree in mathematics or applied mathematics. This should include courses in advanced calculus, analysis, modern algebra and linear algebra. Applicants with degrees in other subjects may be admitted but may be required to take certain undergraduate courses in mathematics without receiving graduate credit. GRE general scores are not currently required. The GRE Subject Test in Mathematics is not required but a good score can be a positive factor in admission.\n\nApplicant Information\n\nDelivery Method: On-Campus\n\nEntrance Exam: None\n\nInterview Required: None\n\nAdmission Deadlines\n\nFall: Jan 18 (for first round funded PhD offers and invitation to recruitment weekend), March 15 (final deadline for funded PhD offers) March 15 (International Masters students), June 1 (Master's Students)\n\nSpring: November 25 (Master's Students)"
