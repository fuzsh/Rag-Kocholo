(1969), University of Canterbury, New Zealand on inelastic light scattering in solids (experiment); D.Sc. (1978), University of Edinburgh, Scotland; D.Sc. (2000), University of Canterbury, New Zealand Lockwood has pioneered applications of inelastic light scattering spectroscopy to the study of layered compounds (University of Canterbury), solvated ions (University of Waterloo), structural phase transitions (University of Edinburgh), magnetic excitations (Light Scattering in Magnetic Solids with Michael G. Cottam, 1986) and semiconductor heterostructures (National Research Council of Canada). His latest research on the optical properties of semiconductor nanostructures (Light Emission in Silicon, 1998; Semiconductor Nanocrystals with Alexander Efros and Leonid Tsybeskov, 2003; Silicon <strong>Ph</strong>otonics with Lorenzo Pavesi, 2004; Self-Organized Nanoscale Materials with Motonari Adachi, 2006) and magnetic nanostructures has attracted wide attention. Lockwood was a Teaching Fellow at the University of Canterbury (1965–1969), a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Waterloo (1970–1971), a Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh (1972–1978), and in 1978 joined the National Research Council of Canada where he is currently Principal Research Officer. <strong>Ph</strong>otograph URL http://ims-ism.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/staff/LockwoodDJ_e.html McLELLAN, Alister George Born: 4 June 1919 in Christchurch, New Zealand Mathematical <strong>Ph</strong>ysicist/Solid State Theoretical <strong>Ph</strong>ysicist Fellow, Royal Society of New Zealand (1961) Fellow, Institute of <strong>Ph</strong>ysics (1966) Hector Medal, Royal Society of New Zealand (1958) <strong>Ph</strong>.D.
