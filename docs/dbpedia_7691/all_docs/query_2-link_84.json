        "text": "Episode 92 - Kate Stange\n\nEvelyn Lamb: Hello and welcome to my favorite theorem, the math podcast with no quiz at the end. I'm Evelyn Lamb, a freelance writer in Salt Lake City, Utah, where it is gorgeous spring weather, perfect weather to be sitting in my basement talking to people on Zoom. This is your other host.\n\nKevin Knudson: I’m Kevin Knudson, professor of mathematics at the University of Florida. I don't know, Evelyn, I saw the pictures on Instagram over the weekend and it looked cold in Utah. You wrote that you rode a century, right?\n\nEL: Metric century.\n\nKK: Okay. Metric.\n\nEL: Just in case — you know, I don’t want people to think I'm quite that hardcore. Yeah, at least at this point in the season. Yeah, I hadn't managed to ride more than about 25 miles since last fall because weather, travel, just things conspiring against me. The week before I was like, I really need to get 30 or 40 miles in on Monday. And then it was, like, 20 mile an hour winds and sleet and I was like, well, I guess I'm just going into this cold, but it was fine. It was actually gorgeous weather. It was a little chilly at the start, but better than being too hot.\n\nKK: Well, you know, the muscle memory takes over, right? So you can do — I mean, 62 miles isn't that much more than 25, really, once you have the legs, so congratulations.\n\nEL: Yes, thank you. Well, we are delighted today to be joined by Kate Stange, who is in the Mountain Time Zone, something that I always feel thrilled about because I'm constantly converting time zones when I'm talking to people, and finally, someone I didn't have to do that for! So Kate, other than being in the Mountain Time Zone, what would you like to tell us about yourself?\n\nKate Stange: Oh, geez. Um, well, I'm also a cyclist. And so I'm jealous hearing about your rides.\n\nEL: Wonderful!\n\nKS: Here in Colorado we have we have this ride called the The Buff Classic. And so it has a 100 mile option where they close Boulder Canyon so that you can bike up the canyon without any cars.\n\nEL: Oh, wow.\n\nKS: Then you bike along the peak to peak highway. It's just wonderful.\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKK: Yeah. That sounds great.\n\nEL: So you're at CU Boulder?\n\nKS: Yes. And it's run from the campus. It starts right outside the math department.\n\nEL: Oh, perfect. Yeah, just drop your stuff in your office and hop on and ride it?\n\nKS: Yeah.\n\nEL: Yeah, great. Well, we are thrilled to have you here today. And I guess we can just dive right in. What you're on what do you like to tell us about?\n\nKS: My favorite theorem, at least for today, is the bijection between quadratic forms and ideal classes.\n\nKK: That’s a lot of words.\n\nEL: Yeah, and I'm so excited to hear about this, because I am honestly a little nervous about both quadratic forms and ideal classes, and a little embarrassed about being nervous about quadratic forms, not so much with ideal classes. So yeah, can you tell us a little bit about what that all means?\n\nKS: Yeah, sure. So quadratic forms is probably what sort of comes first in the story, at least sort of the way that the mathematics tells it, and also probably the historical way. And so a quadratic form is just a polynomial with an x2, a y2 and an xy. So it's like 3x2 + 7xy − y2. So that's quadratic form. And, as number theorists, one of the things that we're most interested in studying is what are the integer solutions to polynomial equations? And so first you start with linear equations. And there's a wonderful story to do with Euclidean algorithm and stuff there. And then you move on to quadratic. And really, these are sort of some of the first equations that you would start studying next, I guess. And so they go back to the classical days of number theory, Gauss and Euler and everybody. And, yeah, so they come in, what happens is that they come together in families. So different quadratic forms, you can actually just do a change of variables. And it'll look different, but it won't really be too different, particularly if you're interested in what numbers it can represent when you put in integers. So say I take x2 + y2, which is the simplest one, if I put in various different integers to that I get various different integers out. And then if I do a change of variables on that, just a little change of variables — like maybe I change x to x + y, but I leave y alone — the formula will look different after I do that change of variables, but as I put in all integers and look at all the stuff I get out, those two sets, the in and out, they're going to look the same. And so we kind of want to mod out, we want to ignore that difference. So I'm really thinking of equivalence classes of quadratic forms. So that's the first object.\n\nEL: And that change of variables is kind of the only equivalence class thing that happens with them?\n\nKS: Yeah. Yeah. Because they could really behave differently between the different classes.\n\nKK: And you only allow a linear change of variables, right?\n\nKS: Yes, exactly. Yes. Thank you.\n\nEL: Yeah. Okay. So now, ideal classes.\n\nKS: Now ideal classes. So this is an interesting one, to describe where it comes from, I think. So there's sort of — if you think about the history of math, I would say there are sort of two versions, there are sort of two histories of math at the same time. There's one, which is sort of the human history, which is fascinating and human and quirky. And then there's sort of the way that the math would like to unfold to human understanding the way that as any human coming to it, they might discover the pieces of the mathematics. And I don't know too much about the details of the human history. But in terms of how you might discover this, if you're just looking at the integers, you are interested in how they behave, you discover things like prime numbers, you've got addition, you've got multiplication, you've got powers, you might ask how these things interact. And at some point, maybe when complex numbers are discovered, you think about whether there are possibly other collections, or other number systems, other collections of numbers in which you could do the same kind of thing. And so one of the first examples of this would be what's called the Gaussian integers, which is where you take complex numbers, I don't know whether I should dive into complex numbers, but you take complex numbers with integer coefficients.\n\nEL: So that means things like 1 + 2i or something. So the i and the 1 both have integers in front of them.\n\nKK: Right.\n\nKS: Yeah, exactly. And so this is a collection of integers, kind of, right? And we ask things like, okay, are there prime numbers? And so it turns out that there are in that system, there are Gaussian prime, so, like, 1 + i is a prime number. And so you kind of start to develop this whole theory that you have for the integers. But what you find is that in some of these systems, you lose unique factorization. So we love unique factorization in the integers, right? Every integer, up to reordering the factors and maybe putting on a minus sign, you have always a unique factorization into prime numbers. And in the Gaussian integers, that's true. But in some of these other systems, you lose that. And so what people tried to do is to try to fix it. And it turns out, the way to fix it is to add in what were I think, originally called ideal numbers. They were thought of as numbers that should be in the system that weren't in the system. And what they actually were were collections of numbers. They were sets of numbers instead of individual numbers. And the idea here is that, say, you were to take — like in the integers, if you took the number two, you could replace that idea, that idea of two-ness with just the collection of even integers. And so that's an ideal now. Instead of a number, it’s an ideal, and it's really carrying the same information. But now it's a subset. And so by moving from individual elements of the ring, of the collection of numbers, you move to subsets of them. Now you have more things, and so now you can recover unique factorization in that world. So those are ideals.\n\nEL: Yeah. And so the Gaussian integers do have unique factorization.\n\nKS: They do. Yeah.\n\nEL: So this — actually, I kind of forgot, but recently, this came up in something I was writing where I wanted the example to be the Gaussian integers so bad because it doesn't have any square roots in it. But then it didn't work because it isn't true for that. I was trying to show how unique factorization could fail, but I didn't want to have to use square roots. But as far as I know, you can't do that. So then I fixed it by putting a square root of negative five in there and hoping that people would be patient with me about it. But yeah.\n\nKK: So that's the example of one where you don't get unique factorization, right? So you take the integers and you join the square root of minus five. That's one example.\n\nKS: That’s one of them. Yeah.\n\nEL: And then it's like two and three are no longer primes.\n\nKS: So if you multiply (1+ √ −5) × (1− √ −5)\n\nKK: You get six. Yeah.\n\nKS: You get six, which is also two times three. And those are two different prime factorizations of six.\n\nKK: Right.\n\nEL: Yeah, but it's so fun that you can do that, and I like your way of putting it where regardless of how these ideas actually formed, you can as a human, looking at some of these basic pieces like primes and then or primes and integers and square roots and things, you can kind of come up with this, like, what happens if I do this? And create this new thing where this this property that I know I always assumed — like unique factorization, when you're growing up, you know, when you take math classes in school and stuff, it just seems like so basic, like, how could you even prove that there's unique factorization? Because how else could you factor anything?\n\nKS: Yeah, exactly.\n\nEL: It feels so basic.\n\nKS: Yeah. And this is what happened, I think, historically, too, is that people didn't expect it to fail. And so they were running into problems and it took a while to figure out that that's what was going wrong.\n\nKK: Wasn’t this part of, was it Kummer who had a reported proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and he just assumed unique factorization?\n\nKS: That’s what I've heard, although I never trust my knowledge of history. Yeah.\n\nKK: It’s probably true.\n\nEL: Well, and there are a lot of good stories. And they may or may not be true sometimes. But yeah, okay. So we've got these, these two things.\n\nKK: Yep.\n\nEL: The quadratic forms and the ideal classes. So yeah, I guess either historically or mathematically, what is this connection? And how do you know that these two things are going to be related?\n\nKS: Yeah, so they seem like different things. So I think quadratic forms were studied earlier. And at some point, people noticed that quadratic forms had an interesting property, which is that sometimes you could multiply them together and get another quadratic form, which is kind of hard to explain. But like, if you actually wrote out (x2 + y2) × (z2 + w2) and you multiplied that all out, you'd have a big jumble. But then you could factor it out. So it looked like, again, a square with some stuff inside, z’s and w's and whatever inside the brackets, plus a square. And so this meant that sometimes if you picked your forms correctly, and they had this sort of relationship, then if you looked at the values they represented, the numbers that can come out, when you're putting integers in, you would take that set of things the first one represents and the set of things the second one represents, and then you’d look at what the third one represents, and it would represent all of the products of those things. So there was this definite relationship, but the way I'm describing it to now is a little awkward, because it's a lot of algebra. But this is, I think, what was noticed first, somehow. And again, I might be mixing the human story with how math tends to want to unfold. I don't know exactly the history. But anyway, so you notice that there's this relationship. And that's kind of reminiscent of an operation, like a multiplication law. And what happens is that, in fact, that's coming from the fact that these ideal classes, each one of them — sorry, my mistake — so it's from the fact that each of these equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms, each one of them is associated to an ideal. And the ideals as the sort of generalization of the idea of number, they can be multiplied together to get new ones. And so on the ideal side, it makes sense that there's an operation because you're already living in a number ring where you've gotten an operation. But on the quadratic forms side, it's a surprise. And so that's one of things I like about this theorem is that you see some structure and you want to understand why. And the reason to understand why is just to change your perspective and realize these objects can be viewed as a different kind of object where that behavior is completely natural. Yeah, so that's one thing that I like about it.\n\nEL: And does this theorem have a name or an attribution that you know?\n\nKS: Oh, it's such a classical theorem that no, I don't know.\n\nKK: Right. It's just the air you breathe, right? So what's the actual explicit bijection? So you've taken a quadratic form. What's the corresponding ideal?\n\nKS: Well, actually, the other way is a little bit easier to figure it out.\n\nKK: Yeah, let's go that way.\n\nKS: So let's take the Gaussian integers, okay. And in the Gaussian integers, you've got — for your ideal, so think of it as a subset of the Gaussian integers. But because it's an ideal, it has the property that it has the same shape as the Gaussian integers. I actually usually like to draw a picture. So I'm going to try to draw a picture just out loud. So if you think of the Gaussian integers in the complex plane, they fill out a grid, right? It's all the integer coordinates in that plane. So that's a grid. And if you want to see what the ideals are, they’re subsets that are square grids as well, but fit inside that grid that we started with, maybe rotated or scaled out.\n\nEL: Okay.\n\nKS: But they're square again.\n\nEL: Okay.\n\nKS: And so, what you can do is with this example, specifically, you can take the norm of each of these elements in the Gaussian integers. So the norm of a complex number, usually I think of it as the length from the origin. But I don't want to do the square root part. So if I have a Gaussian integer x + iy, I'm going to take x2 + y2, and that's the norm.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nKS: All right. And so if I take the whole Gaussian integers, which is itself an ideal, that's one of the subsets that is valid as an ideal, then if I take all of the values, all the norms of all those elements, that's all the values of x2 + y2. So from my collection of integers, I take all of the values and that's actually a quadratic form.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nKS: Okay?\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nKS: And so you can do this with the other ideals as well. So for each one, you look at the norms of all of its elements, and that is a quadratic form and the values of that quadratic form?\n\nKK: Right. So the Gaussian integers are Euclidean, right? So it's PID, right?\n\nKS: It is. It’s a principal ideal domain.\n\nKK: So everything's generated by one element, basically every ideal?\n\nKS: That’s right.\n\nKK: So that makes your life a little simpler, I suppose.\n\nKS: Yeah. So the ideals, in that case, really, they're not so different than the numbers themselves. This is one of those ones where you don't have to go to ideals. But by going to it, you think about instead of just, say, 1+i the number, you think about all the multiples of 1+i and you take all of those, and you take their norms.\n\nEL: Okay. And I told you, when we were emailing earlier, that you'd have to hold my hand a little bit on this. So yeah, sorry, if this is a too simple question or something. But like, what is the quadratic form like the x2 + whatever xy +whatever y2 that you get from the the Gaussian integers that you just said?\n\nKS: Right. So if we take the Gaussian integers, if I take x+iy as a Gaussian integer, its norm is x2 + y2. That’s the form right there.\n\nEL: Okay. Yeah. All right.\n\nKS: And then if I were to take a subset, like all the multiples of 1+i, I'm not plugging in all x's and y's. I'm plugging in only multiples of 1+i, so you end up with a slightly different form popping out.\n\nEL: Yeah, so I guess it's kind of like x+x then.\n\nKK: 2x2 squared basically, right?\n\nKS: Yeah. Yeah. You could have Yeah, various things in various different situations, but yeah.\n\nEL: Okay, thank you. Yeah. And so, yeah, can you talk a little bit about how you encountered this theorem? If it was something that like you really loved to start out with? Or if your appreciation has grown as you have continued as a mathematician?\n\nKS: Yeah, well, it's one of these things, so I think everybody has things that they're attracted to mathematically, they all have a mathematical personality. And there's some sort of particular kinds of things that attract you. And for me, one of the things is the sort of projection theorems that tell you that a particular structure, if you look at it a different way, has a whole different personality. And it's actually the same thing, but it has just become totally different. So I really love those things. And I've always loved number theory, because it has such simple questions. But then when you dig into them, you always run into such fascinating, complex structure hidden. And so this is one of those things that if you have that kind of personality thing you, just keep bumping into. And so for me, and all of the research that I've done and things I've been interested in, I keep coming back to this theorem and bumping into it in different places. It shows up when you study complex multiplication of elliptic curves, it shows up when you study continued fractions, it shows up all over the place. And it just seems so fundamental. And it's sort of like maybe one of the most fundamental examples of this special kind of theorem that I really enjoy.\n\nEL: Okay.\n\nKK: Cool.\n\nEL: All right, well, then the next portion of the podcast is the pairing. So yeah, as you know, we like to ask our guests to pair their theorem with something that helps you appreciate the theorem even more. What have you chosen for that?\n\nKS: So, when I think about this theorem, I just it's a treat. So I think the only thing that comes to mind really over and over again is just chocolate. I love chocolate. And that's what you should enjoy this theorem with because maybe you should just be happy enjoying it.\n\nKK: I mean, chocolate pairs with everything.\n\nKS: That’s true. It's a bit of a cop out.\n\nKK: No, no, that’s okay. So our most recent favorite chocolate is Trader Joe's has this stuff. And it's got, I don’t even know what’s in it, pretzels and something else crunched up in these like bark of chocolate. And it’s a dark chocolate I really recommend it. So you must have a Trader Joe's in Boulder, right?\n\nEL: Are you a dark, milk, or white chocolate person?\n\nKS: Oh, definitely dark. Yeah, I have a dark chocolate problem, actually.\n\nEL: Yeah, the Trader Joe's. For me the dark chocolate peanut butter cups are are always purchased when I go to Trader Joe’s.\n\nKK: Dark chocolate feels healthier, right? It's got more antioxidants and a little less sugar. So you're like this is fine, less milk. Okay. All right. It's actually it's a fruit, right?\n\nEL: It’s a bean. You’re having a black bean pate right there.\n\nKK: That’s right.\n\nEL: Yeah, well, Salt Lake is actually a hub of craft chocolate. We have some really wonderful chocolate makers here, like single origin, super fancy kind of stuff. So if either of you are here, we'll have to pick up some and enjoy together. And yeah, along with quadratic forms and ideal classes.\n\nKS: Sounds wonderful.\n\nEL: Yeah. So something I meant to talk about this earlier in the episode, but you mentioned that you'd like to illustrate things, and that is how we first met is, through mathematical illustration. So I don't know, maybe it's a failure of imagination on my part, but I always, I'm always fascinated by like, number theorists who are really into illustration as well, because I think of, like, geometry, as you know, it shapes it as the more naturally illustrate-y parts of math. But would you talk a little bit about it, you know, illustrating number theory? And if if you've done anything related to this particular theorem, or if there's something else you want to talk about with your mathematical illustration?\n\nKS: Oh, yeah, that's a that's a great idea. Yeah. So there's actually building up gradually a wonderful community of people who are interested in illustrating mathematics. And so that's maybe one of the things that you could add a link for is the website for the community.\n\nEL: Definitely.\n\nKS: Yeah. And so I've always found that the way I think about mathematics is very visual. I mean, I think as human beings, we have access to this whole facility for visual thinking, because we're embedded in this three-dimensional world that we're living in. And another way that we think about mathematics, I think often, is we're using another one of our natural facilities, which is our sort of social understanding facility, where we imagine characters interacting with each other and having motivations and stuff like that. But for me, it was always a very visual thing. And so even though it wasn't taught in that way, in my mind, somehow these things were always very visual things. And so I've always been really attracted to situations where you can see some hidden geometry in number theory. And with this particular theorem, there is a little bit of nice hidden geometry. I mean, the first hint of this is that when I talked about ideals in the Gaussian integers, I visualized them as a lattice.\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKS: And in all of these number rings, you can do this, you can you can think about lattices. And you're really talking about lattices, and lattices have things like shape. And you know, there's lengths and angles and stuff like that to talk about. And so one of the really cool things that you can do is you can think about, for example, with the Gaussian integers or with some other ring of interest that you can put in the plane like this, into the complex plane, then you can ask this question, it's a natural question that people ask: how can I study the collection of objects instead of the individual objects themselves? So if you want to study the collection of lattices, say, two-dimensional lattices in the plane, then one way to do it would be okay, how do I decide on a lattice? Well, I have one vector that's generating it, and then another vector that's generating it. So let's put the first one, let's sort of ignore issues of scaling and rotation, let's put the first one down pointing from like zero to one. And then the other one is somewhere, but now you don't have any choice anymore. No more freedom. And so you can think of the plane itself as a sort of moduli space, as a parameter space for the collection of lattices. And this space has a lot of beautiful properties. So you might as well order your vectors so that we're just talking about the upper half plane. So the first vector is from zero to one, and the other one is an angle less than 180 degrees from that. And so when you start looking at the geometry of this plane, and you want to talk about well, okay, I want to look at lattices, but maybe I don't care so much about what basis I'm using for the lattice, you start to divide the plane up in certain ways. And what you discover is that the natural way to talk about this plane is using hyperbolic geometry, actually. And so all of a sudden, you're doing hyperbolic geometry. And I find myself doing hyperbolic geometry sometimes when I'm doing number theory, because when I want to look at these these objects and stuff, that's just the natural world in which they live. I mean, the mathematics kind of tells you what you have to do you. You know?\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKS: And so those are moments that I really enjoy, because you're doing something that you think is just some algebra, but all of a sudden, it turns out it's geometry.\n\nEL: Very cool. Yeah. So we will include a link to your website, which I know has some of the cool illustrations that you've done available there. And to the illustrating math, there's an online seminar that meets monthly that is really nice to go to, if you can. And, yeah, it's a lot of fun. And I, yeah, just so many different fields of math represented with that in ways that I never would have guessed.\n\nKS: That’s true. That's one of the nice things about that community is that there's people from all different areas that you wouldn't normally interact with, because usually you have a pretty narrow research circle, if you're doing research in mathematics. But there, you're talking to everybody. And it has a much more creative feel for that reason, you get surprised by people's ideas, because they come from just a little bit farther from your home base, you know?\n\nEL: Yeah. And I think it also kind of pushes people to really think about how they're explaining things, where you have a shorthand when you're working with someone who is in, or talking to someone who's in such a close field, and since you don't necessarily have that same common background, people, I think, it seems like are very thoughtful about how they describe things and what they assume that you already know.\n\nKS: Yeah, exactly. It's just good to get out of your little corner.\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKK: All right. Well, this has been great. I definitely learned something today. I did not know this connection between ideal classes and quadratic forms.\n\nKS: Oh, I thought of one more, one book I'd like to plug.\n\nKK: Okay. Please do.\n\nEL: Great. Yes.\n\nKS: Yeah, so Martin Weissman has written a book called — I'm going to get the title slightly wrong. It's An Illustrated Theory of Numbers, maybe? Oh, you have it. Oh, I got it right.\n\nEL: Yeah. An Illustrated Theory of Numbers. It's been holding up my laptop, after I read it, I will say.\n\nKS: Yeah, and so you were asking about illustrating number theory, and this is just a beautiful book. It's completely accessible. I used it when I was teaching an introduction in number theory for undergraduates. But it doesn't require any particular background because it starts from, you know, we’ve got the integers, we’ve got addition, we’ve got multiplication, let's do some stuff. And and he really looks hard for ways to turn theorems which are usually completely algebraic into something visual, and they're just lovely.\n\nEL: Yeah, and really amazing illustrations, and full color, like everywhere, which I know is more expensive to make books, and that's why books so often have the color in the middle, like in a little section and not the whole thing. But I do think this is just much more pleasurable to read because it it is does use that aspect, too. And it's not as stark as every page being black and white.\n\nKS: Yeah, it's so inviting. It's a wonderful book.\n\nEL: Yeah. Great recommendation. Thank you so much for joining us. I really enjoyed talking with you.\n\nKS: Yeah, me too. Thank you so much for having me on.\n\n[outro]\n\nFor this episode, we were excited to talk to Kate Stange from the University of Colorado, Boulder about the bijection between quadratic forms and ideal classes.

It's been a minute since we've recorded one of these. We kind of went dormant for the winter.\n\nKK: Yeah, a little bit, a little bit. Yeah. But Punxsutawney Phil told us — I don’t, what did he say? Let's pretend he said six more weeks of winter.\n\nEL: I think he usually does. I don’t know.\n\nKK: I mean, objectively, there are always six more weeks of winter. Like, the calendar says so, right?\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKK: Anyway, yeah.\n\nEL: And, you know, he probably is pretty good at seeing shadows if he's a prey animal because he'd be used to seeing, like, a bird coming overhead.\n\nKK: That’s an interesting question.\n\nEL: Do birds eat groundhogs?\n\nKK: That’s what I was going to wonder. I mean, like, eagles, maybe, but groundhogs are pretty large, right? I mean,\n\nEL: Yeah. What eats groundhogs?\n\nKK: Well, that's something to investigate later.\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKK: So it is Pi Day, right?\n\nEL: It is! Well…\n\nKK: We’re actually, we're recording this on Pi Day. When our listeners hear this, it won't be, but we're recording.\n\nEL: And, I always have to put in a plug for my calendar.\n\nKK: That’s right.\n\nEL: The AMS math page-a-day calendar on which Pi Day does not occur on this day.\n\nKK: That’s right.\n\nEL: There are other Pi days on this calendar, none of which is this day, my little joke here. So you can find that in the AMS bookstore.\n\nKK: Right. Are you Team Pi or Team Tau?\n\nEL: I’m Team whichever one works for the calculation that you’re doing. It’s not that big a deal.\n\nKK: That’s right. That's right. Okay. All right. Enough of us, enough of our useless banter, although we did discuss what's the ratio of banter to actual talk, right, that there's, there's like a perfect ratio. But we are pleased today to welcome Karen Saxe. Karen, why don't you introduce yourself and let us know all about you?\n\nKaren Saxe: Hi, there, everybody. So first of all, happy Pi Day. If listeners know who I am, I was a professor at Macalester College for about for over 25 years. And then about seven years ago came to work at the American Mathematical Society, where I am very happy to be the director of the Government Relations Office. So I work in DC with Congress and federal agencies. And could quite a bit about this. I'm also happy to be here because it's Women's History Month. And it will be appropriate that it is Pi Day when you hear what my favorite theorem is.\n\nKK: Okay, good to know. So, I'm curious to know more about this government relations business. So I mean, I know that the AMS does a lot of work on Capitol Hill, but maybe some of our listeners don’t. Can you explain a little more about what your office does?\n\nKS: Yeah, so we do a lot of things. So first of all, we communicate — I sort of view the work of our office as going two ways. One is to communicate to Congress why mathematics is important to almost everything they make decisions about, you know, our national security, health care, you know, modeling epidemics, thinking, like you’re in Florida, thinking about how to model severe weather and things they care about, and then why they should fund fundamental research in mathematics and all sciences. And then also you know, how they make decisions about education. So we tell Congress, we give them advice and feedback on our view about what they should do in those realms. And then on the sort of flip side, I tell the AMS community, the whole math community about what Congress is doing and what's happening at the agencies like the NSF, and Department of Defense and Department of Energy, that that they might care about things, things that would affect their lives. So that’s sort of it in a nutshell. I spend a lot of time on the hill. I just came this morning, I went to a briefing put on by the National Science Board, which is the presidentially-appointed board that oversees the NSF. And they put out a congressionally mandated report every few years on the state of, it's called the indicators report. I'm sure I found it more interesting than everybody else, but it's pretty fascinating. You know, it covers everything from publications around the world, like which countries are are putting out the most science publications, what the collaborator network looks like around the world, and that to sort of US demographic information about education, you know, who's getting undergraduate degrees? Who's getting two year degrees? Who's getting PhDs, that that sort of thing. It covers a lot, actually. Pretty interesting.\n\nKK: Yeah, yeah. All that in like two hours, right, and then it's over.\n\nKS: Yeah, all that in two hours. And then they give you the big report that you can. And I've got them sitting in front of me. But given that this is a podcast, showing things doesn't work.\n\nKK: Well, we do it all the time.\n\nKS: Here’s one of the reports I picked up this morning. Actually, one really, so they're, you know, they're one thing. And you might end up cutting this, but one thing that's sort of fascinating to me is they always list barriers for getting into STEM degrees. And you know, there are things listed, like college accessibility, things that — and even going back. So like, you know, school kids who say they don't have science teachers in their schools, they don't have math teachers, but they've added to this list. “I can't support my family on a graduate student stipend.” So this is something.\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKK: That’s real.\n\nKS: And we are, we've endorsed a bill in Congress that would look that would help to improve the financial stability, I guess, you would say, or the ability to be a grad student or a postdoc. So it's looking at stipends, it's looking at benefits, you know, leave time, all that sort of stuff, making it a job that you can choose to take when you're 23, and have a family to support and could make a hell of a lot more money doing something else with a math undergraduate degree.\n\nEL: Yeah, and not see it as something where it's like, you're kind of putting off real life for a little longer, which I think maybe in the past was more of the model, like, oh, yeah, you'll have a real career later. But you know, in your mid-20s, you'll just keep being a student and not have kids or, you know, things, you know, not have parents to support or things like that.\n\nKS: Exactly.\n\nKK: Yeah. Okay. That's, that's good to know. Thank you for all that hard work you do, Karen. So but this is a math podcast.\n\nKS: Right.\n\nKK: So what’s your favorite theorem?\n\nKS: Okay, so first, I'm going to tell you about the three theorems that I didn't choose.\n\nKK: Cool.\n\nEL: Great.\n\nKS: So — I'm sure everybody goes through this — and thinking about my research, it would probably have to be the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem, which basically tells you that if you've got a bounded linear operator on two Lp spaces, then it's bounded on every Lp space in between those two values of p, so I used that all the time when I did research on that sort of thing. Then, but I was primarily a teacher of undergraduates, and kind of my two favorite theorems to teach are always Liouville’s theorem and, and then the uncountability of the real numbers.\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKS: And Liouville, they’re the one that says, you know, that there's a bounded — if you have a bounded entire function function, it's got to be constant. And the result is so stunning, and it gives a great proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, that every non-constant polynomial has a root. So I always love teaching that. And then of course, like, Cantor’s diagonal argument about the real numbers, nothing beats that proof in terms of like, cool proof, in my opinion.\n\nEL: Yeah. All-time great.\n\nKS: Yeah, all-time great, right. And I think it's been mentioned on your podcast before. But what I picked was this theorem that says that if you have a given fixed perimeter, then the circle maximizes the two-dimensional shape you can make, so the isoperimetric theorem.\n\nEL: Nice! And as you said, very appropriate for Pi Day.\n\nKS: Yeah, which, I hadn’t even thought about that, which is sort of also embarrassing. But until we started acknowledging Pi Day, I hadn't thought about that. So another way to say it, or the way you might see it in a textbook, is if you have a perimeter P and an area A, then P2−4πA is greater than or equal to 0, with equality if and only if you have a circle. So this theorem has a very long, fascinating history. Lots of great applications. And for all those reasons, I love it. I love history.\n\nKK: Yeah.\n\nKS: I love math.\n\nKK: Yeah. Do you have a favorite proof of this theorem?\n\nKS: I do, actually. Yeah. Well, I didn't know you'd ask that. So there are a lot of proofs. And the one that I like, and this comes from being an analyst probably, is in the early 1900s. Hurwitz gave a proof using Fourier series. I love that proof. And proofs are quite old, going back thousands of years to the Greeks. And then in 1995, Peter Lax actually gave a new short calculus-based proof. But I like the Fourier series proof, just because I like Fourier series.\n\nEL: Yeah, that's a topic that I wish I understood better. Somehow I kind of missed really, ever feeling like I've really got my teeth into Fourier series. Maybe that's a little embarrassing to admit on a math podcast.\n\nKK: I don’t know. I took that one PDEs class as an undergrad and, like, that's where you see it, you know, doing the — whichever, the wave or the heat equation, whichever one it is — maybe both? I don't know. And then that’s it, that shows you how much I remember, too.\n\nKS: Yeah. Good. So you're not gonna dare ask me to give you that proof or anything?\n\nEL: Yeah, generally, a proof like that on audio is not the ideal medium.\n\nKS: It doesn’t work.\n\nEL: Actually, you brought up these ancient proofs. So yeah. Yeah, I guess how long has humanity known this fact, do you think, or do you know?\n\nKS: So it's considered that the Greeks knew the proof. And then it was proved around 200 BCE. It even features in Virgil's version of the tale of Dido, Queen Dido.\n\nEL: Oh, that’s right.\n\nKS: So yeah, I think that was around 50 or 100 BCE, after the Greeks knew the theorem. So can I say what that story is?\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKK: Yeah, please.\n\nKS: So she apparently fled her home after her brother had killed her husband. Okay, so we're already in an interesting phase. She somehow ended up on the north coast of Africa after that, and she was bargaining to get some land. And they told her, oddly, that that somehow she could get as much land as she could enclose with an oxhide.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nKS: And so she took this oxide and cut it into very thin strips, and then enclosed an area, that was the largest she could conceive of, with the given per perimeter.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nKS: So there's that. So it appeared, like, 2000 years ago, or more, and then you sort of we sort of jumped into the early 1800s when Steiner gave geometric proofs. But what's kind of fascinating is his proofs all assumed that a solution existed. And I haven't looked at these proofs, at least not in a long time. But then later in that century, Weierstrass is credited with giving a proof that, well, first, he proves that a solution does in fact exist. And he did use the calculus of variations to get this proof. So that's, that's sort of the story of the, of the theorem.\n\nEL: Yeah, this actually — you know, we say the Greeks knew this, but I kind of wonder if this is one of those things that humans would kind of intuitively know, even if they're not in a framework where they have language about proving mathematical theorems, even if that's not an aspect of, of their culture, but it seems like you're trying to get into the mentality of like, what is really intuitive or innate about mathematics for humans? And I wonder if that, you know, we kind of would understand, well, if I took a square or something, I could sort of bow it out a little bit, and get a little more area with the same string.\n\nKS: Actually, I mean, one reason I love this theorem is you can give string to kids, and I used to do this, like in elementary schools, and tell them make the biggest shape. And you have to tell them what closed is, no, you have to describe that the string has to come back to where it started. And they all come up with a circle. And this is, you know, second, third grade kids. So it is really intuitive. Yeah. So what it's meant by the Greeks knew this theorem is not 100 percent clear.\n\nKK: Because they didn’t even use pi, right?\n\nKS: And then actually, Evelyn to what you just said, you know, there's something that's quite interesting to me, which is that, you know, if you think about, you know, shapes of constant width, you know what I'm talking about?\n\nEL: Yeah.\n\nKS: So, if you take the fixed perimeter, there's an infinite number of these, the circle’s the largest one and those Reuleaux, I think that's how you say his name, those triangles are the ones of smallest area.\n\nEL: Okay.\n\nKS: And you were just kind of alluding to that, like take a triangle and go puff out the sides, or something.\n\nKK: And you can push in.\n\nKS: Yeah. Right. And you can do it for any regular polygon.\n\nEL: Yeah. Well, British money has a couple of these that are I think heptagons, Reuleaux heptagons? Are they all called Reuleaux? Or just the triangles? I don't know.\n\nKS: No, but you’re right about that, they do. And so it's kind of funny, I saw something that was talking about these points, like, what possessed them to make those points? And if you have a machine that has a hole size, and you know, it could fit a circle, it has a diameter, right, but it can also obviously fit one of these other shapes. Yeah. So that works. And I think you're right. It's a heptagon, heptagonal version of those.\n\nEL: Yeah. The first time I went to the UK, this was, I think, the most exciting things on my trip to me, was these coins. Like, who thought to make these? And I actually, I remember, I wrote a blog post about it and discovered that it was a little hard to figure out if I had the rights to use a picture because all the images of these coins are like, technically property of the Crown.\n\nKS: That’s funny.\n\nEL: Abolish the monarchy, man.\n\nKK: Her Majesty relented in the end?\n\nEL: Yeah, so strange. I was like, well, I'm not gonna beg the queen for the right to post this on my math blog. So I don't remember what happened with that. Hopefully, I'm not opening myself to takedown.\n\nKS: I think you’re probably okay.\n\nEL: Hopefully the statute of limitations has run out on that. Anyway.\n\nKK: I recently came across, I was going through an old notebook, and I found — I don't know why I tucked it in there — from the late 90s. I had one of these 10 Deutsche Mark notes that had Carl Gauss on it.\n\nEL: Oh, nice.\n\nKK: And so I put it on Instagram. And I'm now starting to worry. Wait a minute. Will the German government come after me? Although it's not really legal tender anymore.\n\nEL: Yeah, the pre-2000, whenever they went to the Euro, government.\n\nKK: It was pre-Euro. Yeah, I think I’m safe too.\n\nEL: But anyway, getting back to the math, Karen. So, has this been a favorite of yours for a long time? I guess to me, this is one that I don't think the first time I saw it, I would have been super impressed by it. So what was your experience? What's your history with this theorem?\n\nKS: Right. So like, why did I decide I liked it? Because yeah, it's sort of like, okay, I mean, it's appealing, because everybody can understand it, it’s very intuitive. It's got this, the proof has this interesting history. But why I like it is because you probably know that I'm pretty engaged with congressional redistricting. And when they do measures of compactness of districts, this is the theorem that kind of motivates all their measures.\n\nKK: The Polsby-Popper metric, right?\n\nKS: Yes, exactly. And so you take the Polsby-Popper measure, which was come up in 1991. So like, different states, should I say something about redistricting?\n\nKK: Sure, yeah.\n\nKS: So yeah, I mean, just like the very brief thing is every 10 years, we have to do the census. This is mandated in our Constitution, for the purposes of reapportionment of the House of Representative seats to the state so then after the census is done the seats, which we now have 435 of them, they're doled out to the states. And how that's done is a whole nother you know, interesting math problem, more interesting, probably. But then once the states get their number of seats, like how many in Florida?\n\nKK: We’re up to 27? [Editor’s note: It’s actually 28.]\n\nKS: So let's pretend there's 27 for a minute.\n\nKK: I think that’s right. [Ron Howard voice: It wasn’t.]\n\nKS: Okay. Then, you know, the Florida Legislature, probably, I don't know who does it in Florida, but somebody.\n\nKK: Let’s not talk about that.\n\nKS: Yeah, let’s not talk about that. Whoever’s in charge has to carve up the state geographically into 27 districts, one for each representative, and how they do that geographic carving up is extremely complicated. And to answer the question, “Has this been gerrymandered?” there are certain measures of what's called compactness, and this is like a whole nother thing I could talk for hours on. And compactness sort of measures the lack of convexity, sort of, so like, are there long skinny arms going out? And this is where obviously, like a podcast is, is not the best. But in any case, you know, are there long skinny arms going out, or does the thing look like a circle? So the Polsby-Popper measure tells you how close to a circle, or a disk because it's filled in, but in any case, your district is. Well, that's kind of weird, because if you think about tiling any state with circles, it’s just not going to happen.\n\nEL: Right.\n\nKS: Yeah. So just to sort of fetishize circles is bizarre. But I guess, like, what are your other options? Well, there are lots of other options. But the Polsby-Popper is the most common. There's a handful of states that require specific compactness measures in their process, and many other states that require compactness, but they don't specify the actual measure. In any case, the Polsby-Popper is the most common. And the other common measure is called the Reock measure, and that also fetishizes circles. It's a similar type thing. So with the Polsby-Popper, it's kind of interesting, because they they first published it in a law journal in 1991, in this context for redistricting, but it has actually been mentioned, as far back as the late ‘20s. And can I read you a funny a funny opening line?\n\nEL: Yeah, sure.\n\nKS: So the it first appeared, as far as I know, in a 1927 paper in the Journal of Paleontology. Okay. And how's this for the start of a paper? In quotes: “How round is a rock? This is a question that the geologist is often forced to ask himself.” Okay.\n\nEL: Nice.\n\nKS: So that's a great opening sentence. And then it kind of carries on: “when he wishes to consider the amount of erosion that a stone has received.” And then the paper is actually about measuring the roundness of grains of sand.\n\nEL: Oh, cool.\n\nKS: So there's a lot to say here that the paper is filled with hilarious hand drawings, you know, but also, of course, that geologists seem to be male is another observation.\n\nEL: Yeah, well, and the grammar rules of the time.\n\nKS: Yeah, exactly. But even just this past January, I ran into a paper that was published, and uses this to measure the aggressiveness. It's in, like, a cancer journal. I can't remember which one. And I wrote it down, but of course, what do you know, I can't see it. Anyways — oh, Cancer Medicine is the name of the journal — and it used the Polsby-Popper measure to measure aggressiveness of tumor growth. So you know, it has a life.\n\nEL: That's so so interesting. When you said Journal of Paleontology, I was just like, how is that going to come up in paleontology? But what do you say? Yeah, how round is a rock? It's like, yeah, you do need to measure that. I actually, just the other day watched this interesting video about sand grains and like, certain beaches, or, and certain dunes have different acoustical properties. Due to, like, if they've got a lot of the same sized sand grains and if they pack really well, or if they don't, sometimes there can be the squeaking effect, like when you walk on it, or in a dune, like when there's wind, there can be these like deep, deep resonances, like almost a thunder sound that happens.\n\nKS: Oh, that is interesting.\n\nEL: And this this video went and looked under the microscope at the sand on these different beaches, and kind of showed how some of them packed together better or worse, and some of them are more uniform. So they might secretly be using that metric.\n\nKK: They might.\n\nKS: That’s fascinating. I mean, I heard I've heard that squeaky sound on beaches.\n\nEL: I never have I'm not a huge beach person. So I guess, yeah, but I'm curious about going to one of these beaches someday now.\n\nKS: Yeah. And when you said that I was thinking of the packing, like how they pack, but that would have to do with their shape, and their size. Well, I don't know.\n\nKK: So this is a sphere packing question now. And it's yes.\n\nEL: Or a “how sphere-y is your sphere”-packing question.\n\nKS: How spherey is your sphere?\n\nEL: Not quite as catchy.\n\nKK: Right. So the other part of this podcast is we like to ask our guests to pair their theorem with something, so what pairs well with the isoperimetric inequality?\n\nKS: So naturally, you know, a mathematician would ask, are there analogs in higher dimensions? Right? And then back to how spherey is your sphere, so I play tennis quite a bit. So I'm going to pair it with tennis.\n\nEL: Excellent.\n\nKS: The shape of the ball abides by the theorem.\n\nKK: Yes. Right.\n\nKS: And works for so many reasons.\n\nEL: Yeah. Well, and you are not the the first My Favorite Theorem guest to pick tennis, actually.\n\nKK: That’s right. Yeah.\n\nEL: Yeah, we've had Dr. Curto.\n\nKK: Carina.\n\nEL: Yeah. Carina Curto, paired paired hers with tennis. It was it was about linear algebra. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Hers was about how this thing kind of goes back and forth. When you're doing this thing in linear algebra. So you picked different aspects of tennis to pair with your theorem.\n\nKK: Yep. Do you play much do you, you play, you play a lot?\n\nKS: I play — it’s embarrassing to put on a very well listened-to podcast — that I do play a lot, because I don't know how good I am.\n\nKK: That doesn’t matter.\n\nKS: But I play a couple times a week.\n\nKK: I used to play quite a bit. So as a teenager, certainly. And then in my 30s I played a lot. I played a little league tennis. This is when I lived in Mississippi. And actually, my team won the state championship two years running at our level.\n\nKS: Oh, wow.\n\nKK: But I'm not any good. This was like, you know, I'm like a 3.5. Like, you know, just a very intermediate sort of player.\n\nKS: Yeah, that's what I am.\n\nKK: Yeah, my shoulder won't take it anymore.\n\nKS: I still, I feel lucky. Because physically, I can do it. Right now. I'm in a 40+ league, and that's good. But next season, whatever you call it, or next season, I guess, I'm in an 18+ League, and I've done this before. It means the other players are allowed to be as young as 18. It’s a little humbling, even if we can serve, you know, we have the technical skills, like they’re, you know, like the shots you use in the 40s, like, lobbing is not a good strategy in 18+ because they can run.\n\nKK: Back when I was in my 30s and played, I played a lot of singles still, and I could still do it. But when I would come up against the 20-year-olds, it'd be a lot harder. But then I also learned, I used to play a lot of doubles with with these guys in their 70s. And they destroyed me every time. They were just —because they knew where to be. They had such skill and good instincts for where the ball was going to be. It was humbling in that way.\n\nKS: Yeah, it's it's fun. And I prefer playing doubles these days. It's just more fun and different strategy.\n\nKK: Yeah, and less court to cover. That helps.\n\nKS: Less court to cover. And it’s more social. It's a lot of fun.\n\nKK: Yeah, so you haven't succumbed to pickleball, have you?\n\nKS: I played once, on my 60th birthday. Because no one would play tennis with me. And I got invited to a pickleball thing. And I was like, Okay, we're gonna do it. And, you know, it was fun, but I haven't really. It’s a challenge in Minnesota playing pickleball because it's so windy and the balls are so light, and it’s like whiffle ball.\n\nKK: That’s what they are, basically.\n\nKS: The ball kind of blows around all over the place. So yeah, I haven't I succumbed to doing that. In DC I'm lucky to have enough people to play tennis with. There's a lot of them.\n\nKK: Cool. All right.\n\nEL: Yeah. Great pairing.\n\nKK: Yeah, yeah. So we also give our guests a chance to plug anything they're working on. You sort of already did that. I mean, you're doing all the work. Anything else you want to pitch?\n\nKS: I mean, back to what I do, one reason I love this new job is I get to go in and and make connections to any Congressperson. You know, they have their own interests motivated by their own history, their own life, their own constituents. And this can be — there are obvious things we think about, like people, congressional members who are interested in their electric grid, or ocean modeling for the Hawaii delegation. But it's fun. And it's a fun challenge to think of things. So there's one newish member who was a truck driver before he was elected to Congress. And, we went in and their office was like, we can't make a connection to math. And we started talking about logistics, you know, truck routing. And it was great. It turned into a great conversation where they hadn't really thought about that. So this is what I really love about my job, trying to connect math to anything they’ve got. What they’re interested in, I'm gonna I'm gonna try to connect math, and there are very few issues that that can't be connected.\n\nEL: Yeah, well I actually have a question, something that our listeners might be interested in is like if a mathematician is listening to this, and wonders, how can I get more connected to what's happening? How can I understand what math and science, you know, representatives do on the hill? Is there a newsletter or a website or something that you have that they could look at? And, you know, maybe find ways to get more involved? Or at least more informed?\n\nKS: Yeah, definitely. So first of all, I used to write a blog, but I don't do that anymore for the AMS. The AMS Government Relations page — so my office is the Office of Government Relations. And I believe if you search, AMS government relations, you'll get to my webpage, you know, the one that I call mine, and you'll see a lot of different things there. There are ways to get engaged. We offer felt three fellowships. Two are for graduate students, one is for a person with a PhD in mathematics to come and to come here physically and do things. One is a boot camp for graduate students, a three-day graduate boot camp to come learn about legislative policy. And then the the biggest one is a year long fellowship and working in Congress. I do hill visits with people. And you know, I'm pretty willing to bring almost any mathematician to the hill, and that can be virtual these days. So we have volunteer members through our committee work who fly in and do these hill visits. We did this last Wednesday, we had about 25 AFS, volunteers fly in, and that was a fantastic day. But I can do them virtually. I've done them with big groups of grad students from departments, and people can email me if they want. And I think you guys have my email.\n\nEL: Yeah. Thanks.\n\nKS: So those are the big ways. And then for AMS members who are a little more advanced in their careers, you can volunteer for AMS committees. And there's the Committee on Science Policy, which really focuses on this one. And then I'm also in charge of the Human Rights Committee for the AMS, which can be of interest to a lot of people.\n\nKK: Sure.\n\nEL: For sure.\n\nKK: Lots going on there.\n\nKS: Yeah, lots going on.\n\nKK: Well, Karen, this is terrific. Thanks so much for taking time out of your day, and thanks for joining us.\n\nKS: Thank you.\n\n[outro]\n\nIn this episode, we enjoyed talking with Karen Saxe about her work as the director of the American Mathematical Society's Office of Government Relations and her favorite theorem, the isoperimetric theorem.

I'm your host Evelyn Lamb. I'm a freelance math and science writer in Salt Lake City. And this is your other host.\n\nKevin Knudson: Hi, I'm Kevin Knudson, professor of mathematics at the University of Florida. How's it going?\n\nEL: All right. Yeah, I was I was trying to think about what to say. And I was like, well, the most exciting thing in my life right now is that our city is starting a pilot program of food waste, like a specific food waste bin.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nEL: But then I realized I also did an 80 mile bike ride last Saturday, and that's the first time I've biked that far. And that might be slightly more exciting than compost.\n\nKK: Are you working up the centuries? Are you are you heading for?\n\nEL: We’ll see. I felt pretty fine after 80. I also don't feel like I wanted to do 20 more miles. So we'll see. Someday, maybe\n\nKK: The last century I did was, wow, it was 2003. It was 20 years ago. This is one called the six gap century in Georgia. And it goes over six mountain passes in the mountains of North Georgia, one of which has, like, a 15% grade, which is quite steep. It took me about eight hours. And then I hung up my bike and didn't ride it for like three months.\n\nEL: Well, I mean, it would probably take me at least eight hours to do a flat century.\n\nKK: Yeah, but back in my youth I could do a flat century in about five, but not anymore. Not anymore. So let's keep this banter going because I — so Ben Orlin, a former guest on our podcast, I saw Math with Bad Drawings today had various golden ratios. One of which was the golden ratio of hot fudge to ice cream in a hot fudge sundae, which he argues is one to one, but that's way too much fudge.\n\nEL: That is so much fudge!\n\nKK: But the podcast, like, substance to banter golden ratio, he claims is like two to one. So like a third of this should just be like us, you know, just shooting it.\n\nEL: Saying nothing.\n\nKK: Yeah.\n\nEL: Well, I must admit, that's why I listen to fewer podcasts that maybe I would want to because I have a low banter tolerance. Which brings us to our guest today. Yeah, so we are very happy to welcome Corrine Yap today. Would you like to tell us a little bit about yourself?\n\nCorrine Yap: Yes. So I am currently a visiting assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Tech, in the math department. I'm also a postdoc affiliated with the Algorithms and Randomness Center. But I just got my PhD in the spring from Rutgers University.\n\nKK: Congratulations!\n\nCY: Thank you! I do a lot of, like, probabilistic combinatorics, and stuff around that. So that's sort of my main research work. I also do some performing and some playwriting as well. I actually just got back from a performance yesterday Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.\n\nEL: Oh, wow.\n\nCY: So very busy this time.\n\nEL: Yeah. That’s actually one of the reasons that I've been wanting to invite you for a while. And I was like, well, I should wait until I've seen one of her shows. And then it just has not aligned to work out. Because I know you've done them at the Joint Meetings and things, and the times that I have been there and you have been there, it’s just not been a good time. So it's like, well, I'm not going to put this off forever. So even though I have not yet seen one of your shows, I'm very glad that that we could invite you and have you here and yeah, well, can you talk a little bit about the kinds of theater that you do, or kinds of — I don't know if it's mostly theater or more, like other? I don't know, speaking performances?\n\nCY: Yeah. So it really started when I was a lot younger. And also in college, I primarily studied both mathematics and theatre, with no sort of vision as to what that would turn into in terms of a job or career or anything. I just really enjoyed doing both of them. And as an undergraduate I thought I was mainly interested in acting, but I started studying playwriting while at Sarah Lawrence College in Westchester, New York. And I started writing this play, which is the play that I continue to perform. It's called Uniform Convergence. And it's a one-woman play that's about math. It tells the story of Sofia Kovalevskaya, who is a historical Russian mathematician. She was born in 1850. And it tells a little bit about her life and how she faced a lot of obstacles to be successful as one of the first few women in academia. But it also has a portion that is sort of inspired by my experiences being Asian American, and also being a woman pursuing mathematics. And the setting is that of a real analysis classroom, a lecture where the character Professor….\n\nEL: Hence, uniform convergence.\n\nCY: Yeah, and she is lecturing to her students. So at one point, they do reach the point of the class where they do uniform convergence as a topic. So, you know, in the past, I did a lot more — like, in college, I did, you know, the auditioning for plays and being involved in rehearsals, and all this sort of stuff. But since going to graduate school, and now having an actual job, this one play is sort of the main way that I keep my ties to doing theater and the theater world.\n\nKK: Very cool.\n\nEL: Yeah. Well, that's cool. I didn't realize that Kovalevskaya was the subject of this. I actually just read Alice Munro's short story, Too Much Happiness, which is based on her life. And actually was not my favorite short story in the collection that it’s in, but it, you know, she is such a compelling figure and another woman who was interested in math, you know, at a time when it was a lot harder for a woman to have an academic career in any field, and was interested in literature. Wrote, I think both memoirs and fiction?\n\nCY: She also wrote a play.\n\nEL: Oh, wow.\n\nCY: Yeah. But it wasn't about math. But yeah, she was very much also in both of these worlds in, you know, sort of a more artistic, creative mindset as well as a mathematical one.\n\nEL: Yeah. Fascinating person. So yeah, that's really interesting. And hopefully someday I'll get to see it.\n\nCY: Yeah, I'm still performing. I didn't think I necessarily would be. But it's been since 2017. I've been performing it at different college campuses, and sometimes at conferences at different parts of the country. And I still get invited places. So as long as that keeps happening, I'll keep going.\n\nEL: Yeah, when I was still in academia and doing a postdoc, I did, you know, I'd started doing writing. And sometimes I would get invited to do both like a research seminar talk and a public engagement kind of talk. And so that that might be in your future as well.\n\nCY: Yeah, maybe.\n\nKK: Yeah. Broader impacts.\n\nEL: Wearing both hats on one trip.\n\nCY: Yeah, I actually, I forgot I am doing that. I think this is the first time I'm doing it. At Duke in October, when one day I'll be giving a seminar talk, and then the next day, I'll be performing the play.\n\nEL: Yeah, cool. Well, we invited you on here to talk about your plays, but also to talk about your favorite theorem. So what have you chosen?\n\nCY: Yeah, so I've chosen Mantel’s theorem as my favorite theorem. So this is a theorem that is in the area called extremal combinatorics. And I'll explain what that means. But the statement of the theorem is pretty straightforward. It says that if you have a graph, which I’m a combinatorialist, so for me graphs mean, collections of vertices with edges connecting pairs of vertices. If you have a graph on N vertices, then the maximum number of edges you can have without forming any triangles — so just three edges and three vertices connected to each other — the maximum number of edges you can have with no triangles is N squared over four with appropriate floor.\n\nKK: Yeah, sure.\n\nCY: And this seems like, okay, this is this is just a statement, maximum number of edges. What's so cool about that? You actually, we actually also know where the N squared over four comes from. It’s, the extremal example is the complete bipartite graph on parts of size N over two. So what that means is, you split your vertices up into two sets, each of size half the total universe. And all of your edges go between the two parts. So from one part to the other, not inside the vertices of the parts. So complete means you have all the possible edges crossing between the parts, and then bipartite because you have the two parts of the vertices, and that has N squared over four edges. And it has no triangles in it.\n\nKK: Not even any cycles.\n\nCY: Yes. Yeah, no odd cycles. Yeah.\n\nKK: Okay, all right.\n\nCY: Yeah. So, one reason I really liked this is because when I first learned it, I didn't really think much of it, I learned it in an undergraduate class in combinatorics. And there are, like, three, maybe four proofs that we learned that were all pretty short and straightforward. One of the most basic proofs is just via induction on the number of vertices, and there's nothing, there's no really heavy machinery that's needed at all. And I didn't think much of it. And I didn't have any context as to like, why do we care about this sort of thing. But every year, I learn more and more things that make me appreciate this theory, more and more, because it really was the foundation for this whole field that we call extremal combinatorics, which is really centered on these questions of, like, what are the maxima and minima of certain things that we want to count when we put certain constraints on the problem? So this is an example we want the maximum number of edges. And our constraint is we have no triangles. And you can, there are a lot of different directions you can go with this sort of theorem. One of the most sort of classical foundational ones is just to replace triangle with a different type of graph. Like you could say, Okay, if I want the maximum number of edges with no cycle of length four, or cycle of length 10, right, what can I say? Or if I want the maximum number of edges with no complete graph of size five, where complete means you know, the vertices, you have every possible edge between every pair of vertices. And this type of problem, sort of replacing triangle with other things. It's called a Turán type problem, because there's Turán's theorem that generalizes mantle's theorem to complete graphs of higher orders. And we basically know the answer of what the extremal number is, and the extremal constructions for almost every graph, except for when you consider a bipartite graph as your, instead of triangles.\n\nEL: As the thing you're trying to avoid?\n\nCY: Exactly. And there's a reason for this, there's a theorem where it basically fails, or it's trivial in the case that your forbidden graph is bipartite. And so there's been a lot of study, it's still a very active area of research. And what people are doing is sort of taking different flavors of this Turán type problem that sort of started with Mantel’s theorem. And my first paper in graduate school was on a topological version of this theorem, where we were looking at these higher-dimensional structures called hyper-graphs, which you can think of as a higher dimensional version of a graph, and looking at a more geometric or topological viewpoint on these hyper-graphs by making them into simplicial, abstract simplicial complexes. So we don't have to go into the details of that. But I found it, you know, when I did that project, I found it very cool that that we could take this seemingly purely combinatorial, graph theoretic statement about just counting edges, and somehow turn it into something that requires a little bit more of a geometric or topological point of view, which is not something I had spent much time with before. And so that's sort of one direction at the beginning of my grad school career, where I felt like I had suddenly a much greater appreciation for this theorem. And on the other end, where I am now, it's also connecting very heavily to the research direction that I'm currently pursuing, which is in statistical physics, which is for me an entirely unexpected application of this sort of thing. But if you think about it, this sort of characterization of the extremal structure saying, okay, we can achieve the maximum with a complete bipartite graph, you can view this as sort of a ground state, if you will, if you want to think of the vertices as like particles in some sort of distribution, and you can take a probabilistic point of view on these sorts of counting problems. For example, it turns out that the triangle-free graphs and the bipartite graphs, if you think of these two collections, triangle-free graphs and bipartite graphs on N vertices, they're very closely related to one another. In fact, almost all triangle-free graphs are bipartite. This is a theorem by Erdős, Kleitman, and Rothschild. So you can sort of ask how far does that behavior persist if you add more constraints to your problem? And you can think about it as in a probabilistic sense of thinking, well, what if I have a probability distribution on my triangle-free graphs? And I have a probability distribution on my bipartite graphs? How are those distributions related to one another? And what is the counting statement, say, in terms of the probability distributions when we when we consider a randomness point of view on these things. And the sort of magical thing is that when you go to a probabilistic point of view, there are very natural ways that you can put it into a statistical physics context, where in statistical physics, you are thinking inherently about probability distributions on certain particles, on particles in space, or different configurations of particles in space, where there's maybe a physics motivation underlying the distribution you define. But ultimately, you can distill it down into something that is, that is simply triangle-free graphs, or different discrete structures. So one thing that I'm really interested in right now is just exploring more of this somewhat mysterious, but somewhat really amazing connection between questions that arise in graph theory and combinatorics that, you know, for a long time, we have just thought of in that context, in the graph theoretic context, and how, looking at them from a more statistical physics perspective, can help us gain new insight into how to tackle these problems.\n\nKK: Yeah, and hopefully, it'll go in the other direction. I mean, I think we have this idea that because we learn calculus, and we think about physics being based on calculus, but inherently, right, the universe has to be kind of discrete, so you can't divide stuff forever. So I mean, it sort of makes sense that the underlying business, when you get down to it, might have to involve some kind of graph theory questions.\n\nEL: Yeah, that is remarkable that there's this connection. So this is maybe a naive question about what you're talking about doing. Like probability distributions on graphs, are you saying things like, the likelihood that that two vertices have an edge between them? Or are we talking about some other kind of probability distribution?\n\nCY: Yeah, so there, I purposely didn't include too many details, just because there are a lot of a lot of actually interesting and all valid ways that you can think about imposing probability, you know, into this world into these problems, these extremal combinatorics problems. So one flavor is what you said, we can think of what's called the random graph model. The most common one is the Erdős–Rényi random graph model, where you simply have your N vertices, and for each pair of vertices, you flip a coin, and it can be a P-biased coin, independently, to decide whether you put an edge there. And you can analyze what happens in that graph. What are the likely properties that this graph might have, if you, for example, change P. And what's really cool about studying this model is that there are, for a lot of graph properties, you can find these thresholds with respect to P. And this is like a huge, very active area of research right now, there have been a lot of really cool things proven just this year, in the past few years with regards to a lot of open questions here. But you can sort of if you let your P, your probability that you're adding an edge, be a function of N, the number of vertices, and you imagine N going to infinity, then you can actually sort of chart what happens if you're trying to count, let's say, the number of triangles in your graph, the expected number of triangles in your graph, or other properties. And you can see how changing P changes the value of the thing that you're trying to count. And for a lot of things, they exhibit these thresholds where the probability of finding a particular structure is close to zero. And then past a certain threshold, it jumps up to something close to one, and it happens with high probability. And this is also mimicking something in the statistical physics world where we have things like phase transitions.\n\nKK: Right.\n\nCY: If you think of in physics, just like water’s liquid-gas sort of phase transitions. Where we're also interested in studying what happens to certain properties of your statistical physics distribution when you change the temperature of your different parameters of your model. Can you find the sort of phase transition where the behavior changes quite drastically?\n\nKK: Yeah.\n\nCY: And then so GNP is, is one of these ways you can sort of input probability into — you know, take a sort of probabilistic perspective on these problems. Another is simply something a little bit more physics motivated, is by just imposing a uniform, or nonuniform, or a weighted distribution on the things that you're trying to count. For example, if you want to study triangle-free graphs, you could consider the uniform distribution on all triangle-free graphs on N vertices. And then think about the uniform distribution on bipartite graphs and ask, like, are these distributions close in total variation distance? And you can conclude things about that based on what you know about how close are triangle-free graphs and bipartite graphs to one another? Well, what does that say then about the distance between the nniform distributions that you impose on each set? And that sort of thing characterizes the different sort of distributions that come from the perspective of statistical physics. There are things called, like, the Ising model, and the Potts model and the hardcore model that were defined by physicists. And it turns out that they are simply weighted distributions on things like graph colorings, and independent sets of graphs. And so you can study them in these two different contexts, in the context of the hardcore model from the physics world, or in the context of a distribution on independent sets from the graph theory world.\n\nKK: The hardcore model, I love that name. That’s good.\n\nCY: Yeah.\n\nKK: Well, we’ve gotten pretty far away from triangle free graphs can have at most N squared over four edges. So you mentioned that there were like three or four proofs of this. Do you have a favorite?\n\nCY: I have to say my favorite is the very straightforward induction proof.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nCY: And the reason I like this is because it's a proof that I've done with high school students at a summer math program I teach at called MathILy-Er. And I do it as an hour-long inquiry-based activity, where I simply pose to them this question. I let N be something like six or five, something that they could start drawing examples for them, then say, how many edges can you have before you start having to find triangles? And they often come up with the extremal construction, the complete bipartite construction first. And then I asked them how can we prove that this is actually true that this is the maximum. And they've learned induction at this point, when I do this activity. And so it's a nice lesson in induction, because it requires strong induction. And everybody wants to do weak induction, first of all, and they always want to what I call induct up instead of induct down. They always want to start with an extremal example with N vertices and try and build something with N+1 vertices. And it doesn't work.\n\nKK: Right.\n\nCY: And I always have to remind them, you have to start with something that has N+1 vertices, and remove something and see what happens. Yeah, yeah.\n\nKK: And the base case of one vertex is super easy, right?\n\nCY: And then there's also some argument about how many base cases we need and whether we need one or two or three, or where do we start? And so I think it's just a really nice exercise and practice. And it's simple, but I get to give a little, tiny spiel at the end, not nearly as much as I have said here in this podcast so far. But a tiny hint as to like, you know, what's cool about this theorem, and what more could you do? And some of the students have been interested enough to try and generalize to complete graphs or higher orders, you know, a complete graph on four vertices and try and mimic the same proof. And yeah, I think it's a really nice activity.\n\nKK: Cool.\n\nEL: Yeah. So a complete graph on four vertices includes a complete graph on three vertices so therefore you're trying to avoid something more, so like some of these ones that have triangles could still not have the four. Sorry I'm thinking out loud here because I have very little graph theory intuition. So okay, just like which direction are we going, and how many of these are we avoiding?\n\nKK: You and I are probably the same, Evelyn. Like, we probably took one undergrad graph theory course and then yeah, and then then became topologists.\n\nEL: Right. It’s kind of like it came up in, my introduction to proof class, but never a specific class dealing with graph theory things. Although the times that I've taught in high school programs or stuff, it is the kind of thing that can be quite accessible because the idea of drawing a graph, it's not hard to explain to anybody.\n\nCY: Yeah, to answer your question. So there are actually lots of triangles in the extremal example for the complete graph on four vertices.\n\nEL: Okay.\n\nCY: Just to give you a sense of how it generalizes, the extremal example is the complete tripartite graph where you take three parts now sides and over three, and you have all the edges between the parts, so it looks like a giant triangle.\n\nEL: Yeah. This kind of makes me want to go think about graphs a little bit. Yeah.\n\nKK: Well, so the other part of this podcast is we ask our guests to pair their theorem with something. So what do you think pairs well, with with this theorem?\n\nCY: So yeah, this this question was actually harder for me.\n\nKK: It’s harder for everybody!\n\nCY: I thought of something right away. And then I thought, no, I can't say that. I have to say something cool. And my pairing has to be something neat that makes me seem like a cool person. But I just couldn't think of anything better. So bear with me.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nCY: My pairing is tofu. Okay. And here's why.\n\nEL: Oh, tofu is great!\n\nCY: Yeah. Okay, great. Great. So I thought of this because I think tofu is also somewhat of an underrated ingredient. But it is also so versatile, and you can use it in so many ways. So I grew up eating a lot of tofu because I grew up in a Filipino-Chinese household. And it was just sort of a staple of the things we were eating. But then I realized that not everybody knows or appreciates tofu. The first time I met someone who had never heard of tofu before, it just sort of shocked me, but then I realized it's not a common thing everywhere. But it's used in so many ways. And so I have been vegan since 2015. And also, every year I gain more and more appreciation of tofu as an ingredient. Like, you can use it in stir fries. There's now cheese that's made of tofu, you can make eggs using tofu. You can make a pie using tofu. There are so many ways you can use tofu. And there are so many more vegan options at restaurants and grocery stores and everywhere. So I feel like you know, for anyone who hasn't had tofu before, I would recommend at least giving it a shot.\n\nEL: Yeah, yeah. And yeah, I mean, I grew up in a household that did not eat tofu much, my parents don't eat too much. But yeah, I'm not vegetarian or vegan, but like eat a lot — we have recently been enjoying this vegan Korean cookbook, I mean, it's called Vegan Korean. You might have seen it. [Editor’s note: It’s actually called The Korean Vegan.]\n\nCY: Yeah. I have that!\n\nEL: And just checked out this vegan Chinese cookbook that of course, it's like I think multiple sections are tofu because it's like the tofu tofu part and the tofu skin part, and all of this stuff.\n\nKK: And, you know, do you use silken or what.\n\nEL: But yeah, we’re a high-tofu household now.\n\nCY: Nice. Yeah, there are so many different levels of tofu that you can have.\n\nEL: Yeah, so many different textures, like, the Korean soft tofu is different from like the soft tofu in the cardboard package. Yeah, and so I finally found a Korean grocery store in Salt Lake that I could get to and got, like, the real stuff and oh man, great. That soft tofu soup, so good. And I can actually eat the kind I make because when I get it at a Korean restaurant, it's way too spicy. So I cut — in that cookbook, I think I cut at minimum, sorry, maximum spiciness is, like, a third of what the recipes start with, sometimes a sixth and see if I can work up.\n\nKK: The correct answer level and there was you know, N squared over for, the floor.\n\nEL: Yeah. I am impressed by the spice tolerance of Koreans.\n\nKK: Asian cuisine in general, we once years ago, I was director of the University Honors Program, there was this place in town. It was an Asian place, and they have various stir fries. And you could ask for your spice level from zero up to no refunds, right? And so we had a student worker who was from Bangladesh, we went to lunch there one day, and he got the “no refunds.” And we were like, how is it? And he just went, eh. Like, it's just not very hot. And it's just an interesting cultural thing. Because, you know, I grew up in the Midwest, my mother's family was German, you know, we ate a lot of fried potatoes and sausage, like no flavor, you know? And it's just all what you get used to. Right?\n\nCY: Yeah.\n\nKK: All right. Well, this is we like to give our guests a chance to plug anything. Where can people find you online? Or you've talked about your plays, so that's good.\n\nCY: Yeah. I mean, you can find my website. I recently updated it. And now it's got an all-purple background, which I'm very happy with. And it's corrineyap.com. That's Corrine with two R’s and one N, in case you forget. And, yeah, I continue to perform my plays. So if you're ever interested in bringing me out somewhere to perform, I am always happy to consider doing that. And I've done it at a lot of math departments. I did it at some conferences, but I don't have any conference performances coming up. So mainly like seminars and colloquia slots, things like that. So Evelyn, if you have any universities around you in Salt Lake City who might be interested in hosting a performance, you can let me know.\n\nEL: Yeah. I'll make you vegan Korean food.\n\nCY: Oh, amazing. But yeah, I mean, I just do this for fun. So it's not something that I'm trying to, I'm not trying to schedule, you know, 100 performances on my show this year. I just do it whenever someone is interested in having me there, but I'm always open to new inquiries. So yeah, that's, I guess, the one thing that I'll plug.\n\nEL: Okay, great. Well, it was lovely to have you I'm so glad we finally got to at least meet online.\n\nCY: Yeah, you as well. Thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me. This is a lot of fun.\n\nKK: This was great.\n\n[outro]\n\nOn this episode, we enjoyed talking with mathematician and playwright-performer Corrine Yap about Mantel's theorem in graph theory.

And tomorrow is my 40th birthday. So everything I do today is the last time I do it in my 30s. So, like, having my last mug of tea in my 30s, taking out the compost for the last time in my 30s, going for a bike ride for the last time in my 30s. So I'm, I'm kind of enjoying that.\n\nKK: Well, congratulations. Let's not talk about how long ago I passed that landmark. I will say there's a switch that goes off when you turn 40. So riding your bike will be more difficult tomorrow, I assure you.\n\nEL: Well I’d better get one in then.\n\nKK: Any big plans?\n\nEL: I’m actually going to the Janelle Monae concert.

So yeah, brush with celebrity there.\n\nKK: I mean, of course I've never met Janelle Monae, but you can — actually if you look him up, so there's a style of dance, sort of Memphis Jook, it’s called. Dr. Rico. He's something else. Amazing dancer.\n\nEL: Wow. Interesting life.\n\nKK: That's right. That's right. So anyway, enough about us. We have guests on this show.

Is it one of mine?\n\nEL: Yeah, and when we were chatting before we started recording, you made the mistake of mentioning that you've done some improv comedy. Is that something you do regularly?\n\nAH: So I wasn't an improv artist. This is such a cool event. This science grad student at the University of Washington started this type of improv comedy where they have two scientists give short five-minute talks. And then this improv comedy troupe does a performance that's loosely based on things that they heard in the science talk. And so I gave a talk about some basic knot theory ideas, and it was so funny. I wish everyone could have the experience of an improv comedy troupe doing a whole set about your like research or your job. Yeah, it was so amazing.\n\nEL: Cool. But also, it sounds a little stressful. A little bit. Yeah.\n\nAH: Yeah. You want to not be too boring. And you gotta, like — it's really interesting. The other speaker tried to work in things for them to make jokes about, and they totally didn't take the bait. And they found like more interesting things to make jokes about, but I definitely tried to work in some things that would help them riff off of my talk, and it worked pretty well. Like just referring to knots with quirky names and making jokes about knot theorists and whatnot.\n\nKK: Sure. What-knot. Hahaha.\n\nAH: There are a lot of good knotty puns.\n\nKK: Sure. Okay, so this podcast does have a theme. And the question is, what's your favorite theorem?\n\nAH: Yes! This is a hard question.\n\nKK: Of course.\n\nAH: I’ve decided to tell you about my second favorite theorem. Should I admit that?\n\nKK: Sure.\n\nEL: I’m sorry, that’s a different podcast, My Second Favorite Theorem. It has two slightly worse hosts.\n\nAH: It’s the cheap knockoff.\n\nKK: No, it's the sequel, once we get rid of this one, we're gonna move on.\n\nAH: Just, we're all out of mathematicians, we’ve got to go through them again. So my, let's call it my favorite theorem.\n\nKK: Sure.\n\nAH: My favorite theorem is the region crossing change theorem. So I have to tell you a bunch of stuff before I can explain what this theorem is.\n\nKK: Sure. But it must be about knots.\n\nAH: It is about knots. So, you know, knots we represent, typically, with two-dimensional pictures called knot diagrams, where you have ways of representing when a strand is going over and when a strand is going under at a crossing. And so every type of knot that there is has infinitely many diagrams you can draw of it. But no matter how you draw a diagram of whatever your favorite knot is, it can always be unknotted if you're allowed to do a special kind of move called a crossing change. So if you have your favorite knot diagram, and you're allowed to switch the over and under strands on whichever crossings you want, you can always turn that knot diagram into the diagram of an unknot, which is like a trivial knot that'll fall apart if you unravel it a little bit.\n\nEL: Basically just a circle, right?\n\nAH: Yeah, a circle. I mean, all knots are circles, so I have trouble. Like, a geometric circle.\n\nEL: A boring circle.\n\nAH: Yeah, a boring circle.\n\nEL: And so this theorem, does it come with like, a number of how many of these crossing changes?\n\nAH: Ah, so this is not my favorite theorem. This is a theorem that's going to help us understand my favorite theorem.\n\nEL: Okay.\n\nAH: So this theorem has a really interesting proof that Colin Adams calls “proof by roller coaster.” So the the theorem that says you can unknot any not diagram by changing crossings, you can accomplish unknotting using a certain algorithm where you choose a starting point to travel around a knot, and you decide that every time you encounter a crossing for the first time, you're going to go over it. So the fact is that you're kind of like always traveling downwards. And then when you get to the very end, you take a little elevator back up to where you started. So this will always create an unknot. So it's not that surprising that this is true, that if you're allowed to change whatever crossings you want, you can unknot things. What is surprising is my favorite theorem, which is that region crossing changes can unknot any knot diagram. So let me tell you what a region crossing change is. So you have your knot diagram in the plane. A lot of us kind of imagine that this plane is on a big sphere. So can we picture not diagram on a ball? Is that okay?\n\nKK: Sure. Make it a big enough ball, and it looks like a knot diagram.\n\nAH: Exactly. Yup. So we've got a knot diagram on a ball, and the knot diagram basically separates the surface of the ball into different regions, right? So this amazing theorem uses this operation called a region crossing change. And what a region crossing change is, is you choose a region in the diagram, and you change every crossing along the boundary of that region. So in my head, I'm picturing kind of like a triangular region in the diagram. And if I do a region crossing change on that region, I'm going to change all three crossings that are kind of around that region. So this is the amazing result: every not diagram can be unknotted by region crossing changes. So you no longer, seemingly, have control over individual crossings, you can only change groups of crossings at a time.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nEL: But you can still do it.\n\nAH: Yes, you can still do it.\n\nKK: Right. That seems less likely. The other one, you told us and I thought, Well, yeah, I can kind of see, before we even saw the proof, I could sort of imagine, well, yeah, you just lift them up basically.\n\nAH: Exactly. You lift it up, and then if it gets stuck, you know, change that crossing. But you can only change groups of crossings with the region crossing change. But amazingly, it's still an unknotting operation. So that just blew my mind when I heard that.\n\nKK: Okay, so now I have questions. So, more than one, right? You can't expect to be able to just do one of these, right?\n\nAH: Right. I mean, so if you have a region that just has one crossing on it, it's like a super boring region, because it's just a little loop.\n\nKK: Yep.\n\nAH: And that's actually called a reducible crossing.\n\nKK: Sure.\n\nAH: If you just have a little loop, it doesn't matter which way, which is going over and which is under.\n\nKK: No, but I guess I meant, so you know, you've got one region, right?\n\nAH: Yeah.\n\nKK: So there might be multiple regions, you might have to change many of these, right?\n\nAH: Yes, yes.\n\nKK: What if two are adjacent, then you do one flip on one and one flip on the other, then you're undoing some of the flips from the other.\n\nAH: Exactly.\n\nKK: Is that why it works, maybe?\n\nAH: That is why it works. So it’s a really cool proof. It's actually a proof by induction, which is so cool, that you can have like a proof on knot diagrams that's a proof by induction. But it's by induction on the number of reducible crossings. So the number of these crossings that you could sort of flip out of the diagram. They're not really necessary for the knotedness of the knot. But the base case is the most interesting part of the proof, where you have a knot diagram that has no reducible crossings. So no extraneous little loops or flips on it. But it's very constructive, and it uses things like checkerboard colorings, and it uses splices, or smoothings, which is where you take a crossing and you turn it into — like, you basically get rid of the crossing by cutting it and reattaching ends so that it's just — I’ve got this picture in my head, how do I say it? What's the best way to say that? So you have a crossing, and you want to get rid of it by cutting it and reattaching ends so that there's no crossing anymore. Does that make sense?\n\nKK: Well, it’s sort of like a braid, right? I mean, so you imagine sort of a braid cross, you just clip the string above and below and then you just reattach, then you don't have it, right? Is that what you’re doing?\n\nAH: Okay, yeah, what you just said totally makes sense because I could see your fingers.\n\nKK: This would be a better video podcast, I suppose.\n\nAH: I know. Yeah, at least for topology, or geometry. But the proof basically creates a checkerboard coloring that tells you how to find a collection of regions where you can basically control which crossing you're going to change. So I can change just one crossing, by carefully selecting a group of regions where exactly one, or exactly three of the regions involved in that crossing are going to get changed, but every other crossing in the diagram is next to either zero, two, or four regions that are being changed. So if it gets changed, it'll get changed back and look like it like it started.\n\nKK: Right. Okay. All right.\n\nEL: So I have not thought about knot theory, probably since we talked with, like, Laura Taalman on this podcast years ago. It's not something I think about a whole lot. And so I was not expecting this induction to be on the number of reducible crossings because they're so silly, you can just undo it, and then your diagram doesn't even have it anymore. So, yeah, why not the number of crossings or the number of regions or something?\n\nKK: Yeah.\n\nAH: So the reason reducible crossings are annoying for region crossing changes is because at a reducible crossing — you know, at any crossing, if you zero in on it, it looks like there are four different regions involved in the crossing, but with a reducible crossing, two of those four regions are actually the same region.\n\nKK: Right.\n\nAH: So it can look locally like you're changing two regions, so that you know, the crossing shouldn't flip. But you're really changing one, so the crossing does flip. So that's why reducible crossings are the annoying thing that you need to carefully control.\n\nKK: Okay. All right.\n\nAH: Yeah. And so once you get into the inductive step, you basically want to take a reducible crossing, change it so that you have two pieces, one has one fewer reducible crossings, and you know how to deal with that. And then one is a totally reduced diagram of a knot.\n\nEL: Yeah. But the base case is the hard part, it sounds like.\n\nAH: Yes, yes, yes. Totally.\n\nEL: Interesting.\n\nAH: Yeah. So yeah, so one of the reasons I love this is because I love unknotting. In general, I find unknotting questions really interesting. And I highly recommend everyone go listen to Laura Taalman's My Favorite Theorem podcast because she talks a lot about unknotting problems. But also the woman who proved this result is named Ayaka Shimizu. She’s a Japanese mathematician, probably my age, maybe a little bit younger, maybe she's about to have her 40th birthday or something, I don't know. But she is one of the coolest mathematicians I've ever met. She's definitely the cutest mathematician, and her talks are so cute that you're like, oh my gosh, I'm watching such a cute talk! And then you realize, oh my God, this result that she just proved is really amazing! So she's just super, super cool. I love her so much, and I think it's amazing that she proved this result that, you know, the Japanese math community wondered about for a long time, but no one came up with a proof before her. And she must have, maybe she was even a grad student at the time, or she was definitely a very young mathematician when she proved this result. So I love it.\n\nKK: So here's a question: why would you want to allow such operations? I mean, because physically, changing the crossing, I mean, that would be great when your shoes are knotted, right? Like, you could just go Oh, snap, that's unknotted. Right. Is there a practical reason? And by practical, it could be including things like, it doesn't change the knot invariants or something? Or I don't know, it must if you get to the uknot, but I mean, is it… or is it just fun?\n\nAH: Well, so the other thing — yeah, it's just fun. The other thing you need to know about me is that I study games that you can play on knot diagrams.\n\nKK: Okay.\n\nAH: And this result enabled this Lights Out-type game, they actually have a website. You can search for this game called Region Select. It's a really fu"
