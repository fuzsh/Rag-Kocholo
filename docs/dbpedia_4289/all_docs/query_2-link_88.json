        "text": "Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the most diverse and ubiquitous groups of social insects the largest family under the order Hymenoptera. In insects, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) function as chemical cues for the recognition of mates, species, and nest-mates in social insects. The surface of insects is covered by a complex mixture of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to prevent desiccation. In this study, the cuticular hydrocarbons profiles (CHCs) of weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina workers was extracted and analyzed in Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results reveal that O. smaragdina CHCs extract composed straight-chain and branched-chain alkanes and alkenes. A total of 18 CHCs were identified in the workers of O. smaragdina. The major cuticular hydrocarbons such as Hexadecane (C16H34), Octacosane (C28H58), Octadecane,9-ethyl-9-heptyl (C27H56), Heptacosane (C27H56), Eicosane,9-octyl (C28H58) and Pentatriacontane (C35H72). These cuticular hydrocarbons might be acted as a chemical messenger between the ant colony, nest, nest-mate recognition of the weaver ant O. smaragdina.\n\nThe body surface of nearly all insects, including ants, is covered with a lipid layer that largely consists of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC). They fulfil several functions, the two best-studied ones being communication and protection against water loss. CHC profiles are astonishingly diverse as even a single individual can possess more than 100 different hydrocarbon molecules. Species vastly differ in their CHC composition, but also within species, CHC profiles vary among individuals of different sex, caste, fertility, age, health state, etc. This variation has been intensely studied especially in eusocial insects like ants, where differences are likely to have a signalling function. However, with so many sources of variation in CHC profiles, it is easy to lose track of which factors are more important than others, which patterns can be generalised, and which are idiosyncratic. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of how precisely different factors influence CHC variation. In this re...\n\nSemiochemicals, 5-methyl-nonacosane, Alkanes, Chromatography.Ants are eusocial organisms with great relative abundance and species richness. Studies on these organisms are scarce, especially in the high altitude humid forest environments of the state of Cear√°. In view of this condition, an evaluation of the chemical composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of the species Odontomachus bauri found and recorded for the first time in this study in the tropical forest of Maranguape was carried out, based on the hypothesis that different nests have different compositions of CHCs. For this purpose, collection incursions were carried out in the region to obtain individuals from three different nests. In the laboratory, the extraction of CHCs was performed by immersing the ants in hexane for 30 minutes. After removing the ants, the extracts were subjected to drying to assess the yield of the samples. Then, the extracts were subjected to a silica gel column, before performing an analysis ..."
