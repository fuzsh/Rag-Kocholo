        "text": "Podcast\n\nShe Tells Sea Tales by the Sea Shore – Go Forth and Science\n\nIn this concluding episode of Season 1 (we have seasons now!), I’m talking with someone who is literally an expert on ocean storytelling. Dr. Kelly Bushnell explains how she managed to combine scuba diving and Victorian literature, and takes us on a journey from Greenland to the Salish Sea to the Galapagos. We chat feminism, the connections between colonialism and natural resource exploitation, and the narrative of climate change. As Kelly says, “when problems are caused by humans, they have to be solved by humans from every discipline.”\n\nShe Tells Sea Tales by the Sea Shore 24:05\n\nFill Your Boots 17:53\n\nPolyp to this Conversation 22:42\n\nForever and Ever 09:39\n\nLet the sealebrations begin! 20:32\n\nIf a seagull flies over the sea, what flies over a bay? 13:01\n\nThe Zombie Apocalypse 20:22\n\nEarth Without Art is Just \"Eh\" 15:42\n\nTo Bee or Not to Bee 20:42\n\nFilled to the Brim with Stone 21:00\n\nFind more episodes below, or wherever you listen to your podcasts!\n\nCheck out our pages on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Music, Audible, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, SoundCloud, Pandora or PodBean.\n\nEpisodes\n\nFind episodes, citations, show notes and photos from the interviewee’s adventures below!\n\nShe Tells Sea Tales by the Sea Shore\n\n“When problems are caused by humans, they have to be solved by humans from every discipline.”\n\n– Dr. Kelly Bushnell, ocean humanities scholar\n\nKelly’s website and Instagram\n\nRecommended reading can be found here, here and here (this last one is a syllabus from a course she teaches)\n\nOne of Kelly’s favorite poetry books, Debt to the Bone-Eating Snotflower (aka, a carnivorous sea sponge) is here\n\nKelly’s own publications can be found here, including A Whale is a Palimpsest: Dismembering and Remembering in Moby-Dick and Fighting the Whales\n\nThe great dive shop that Kelly teaches at is Seattle Dive Tours\n\nFill Your Boots\n\n“If I’m standing there it’s my favorite wetland.”\n\n– Tom Hruby, wetland scientist\n\nPolyp to this Conversation\n\n“Ocean acidification, it’s the other side of climate change.”\n\n– Amanda Quasunella, ocean acidification and coral reef scientist\n\nMote Marine Laboratory’s website and the International Center for Coral Reef Research and Restoration\n\nMote’s Florida Keys Coral Lab Facebook and Instagram\n\nForever and Ever\n\n“Everybody loves an underdog. I particularly love the alligator as an underdog.”\n\n– Briana Gibbs, episode guest and Everglades adventurer\n\nEverglades National Park website\n\nLet the sealebrations begin!\n\n“It can be hard sometimes to get people to care about a salmon or to care about a sea star. But if I can get them to care about a fuzzy seal with big eyeballs, the changes they’re going to make in their everyday life are going to help everything else in the ocean as well.”\n\n– Casey Mclean, episode guest\n\nSealife Response + Rehabilitation + Research (SR3) website\n\nSR3’s blog about their whale research\n\nSR3’s social media: Instagram, Twitter and Facebook\n\nIf a seagull flies over the sea, what flies over a bay?\n\nAudubon’s North American Bird Guide\n\nSibley Bird Guides\n\nCornell Lab of Ornithology, All About Birds Guide\n\nMerlin Bird ID App\n\nNPR article about Wisdom, a 70 year old albatross\n\nThe Zombie Apocalypse\n\n“Ecosystems are complex webs, especially undersea ecosystems.
