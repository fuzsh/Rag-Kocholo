Monthly data was used ranging from January 1994 to August 2004. The results indicate that U.S. housing starts have a highly significant impact on the quantity of lumber exports. This study also found that U.S. policies such as the Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA), countervailing duties, and antidumping duties have considerably reduced exports of softwood lumber from Canada. Ye, Michael M.2005-05Dorsey, Donald WayneBiologyEffects of environmental changes on snow algaeExtreme environmental conditions surround snow algae in the High Mountains of Wyoming freezing temperatures and very high light levels. Light intensity, temperature, and medium content are the three main focuses of this experiment. In theory, varying the temperature and light may promote two different visible life stages of snow algae into the other form. This algae, Chlamydomonas nivalis, can be obtained commercially from University of Texas and naturally from Wyoming. The naturally occurring algae is in its resting, aplanospore stage while the one obtained from University of Texas is in its motile stage. In using two different medium types, I found that Bold Basal medium sustained longer algae growth than M-1 medium. The other part of my experiment was to compare the two different originating algae's chloroplast-encoded large subunit of the ribulose-1,5-5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rblcL) gene. Due to inadequate amplified DNA I was unable to conclude whether the two algae were the same species.Williams, William E.2000-05Simms, Tiffany MarieBiologyExploring my back yard : Calvert Marine Museum bay trek programMy plan is to develop an environmental-education curriculum that allows students to explore and learn about the Chesapeake Bay. This Chesapeake Bay program will be used as a Summer Youth Camp (grade 6-8). The first offering of the program will take place June 26- July 7, 2005, from 9am to 4pm at the Calvert Marine Museum located on Solomon’s Island in Calvert County, Maryland .… Lessons are designed for hands-on interactive learning. Some of the topics being taught include geology, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), marshes and wetlands, Bay organisms and biodiversity. I am convinced children learn more when they are able to get their hands dirty and interact with the lesson going beyond just classroom lecture. To encourage this each student will be given a field guide and a lab notebook to write down observations allowing him/her a chance to experience the true essence of science. This process will culminate in a student project during the last week of camp. The students will be divided into three groups and assigned a specific topic on biodiversity. They will have time to do research and make conclusions about the issue given to them. The final day of camp is dedicated to biodiversity where the students will be required to present their findings to the group. [from \"project purpose\"]Williams, William E.2006-05Nelson, Michael AndrewChemistryCool season analysis of particulate phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at Piney Point, MarylandThe ground-level atmospheric concentration of particulate phase Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) were determined over a set of sampling dates between October 25, 2007 and December 7, 2007. Samples were collected in a rural residential area in Piney Point, MD a few hundred yards away from the Piney Point Lighthouse State Park and the Mirant-Piney Point Pipeline fuel offloading facility. This study was directed with the intent to see whether any significant PAH concentrations are found in this community as a result of the pipeline. Found in any organic fuel source or biomass, PAHs are highly suspect carcinogens which are persistent in the environment, especially in areas of high industry, population, or fuel-burning traffic. The results in this study were compared to those taken in a much closer proximity to the pipeline one year previously. This study determined benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, triphenylene and napthacene at a total of 2.88 ng/m3, Fluoranthene and pyrene at 1.43ng/m3, cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene at 0.38 ng/m3, to be the compounds of highest concentration for samples collected after November 5. The variety of PAHs detected are indicative of petrogenic sources. The day with the highest total PAH concentration was December 2, 2007 containing 28.50 ng/m3 PAH. These values are an order of magnitude lower than those detected in the previous year, suggesting that the presence of PAHs in colder late fall months at Piney Point, MD is quite limited when compared to summertime concentrations. It also implies that the effect of the offloading and pipeline facilities have a greatly reduced effect on PAH atmospheric concentrations outside of their immediate vicinity.Larsen, Randolph K.2008-05Talisa, Victor BrodzikBiologyEffects of direct and diffuse light on growth of Brassica rapaThe rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is predicted to lead to increases in precipitation and cloud cover, which can increase the diffuse component of light as much as 85%. Closed-canopy vegetative ecosystems benefit from significantly increased productivity under diffuse light, which optimizes light availability at all levels of the canopy. In contrast, at the leaf-level, specific adaptations allow more efficient absorption of direct light over diffuse light. Little is known about the effects of the directional character of light at the organismic level. Here I investigated the effects of direct and diffuse light on plant growth. Brassica rapa grown under 94% diffuse light were 52% taller than those grown under 29% diffuse light, all other variables remaining the same. These preliminary results should be replicated and possible complication from mutual shading should be investigated.Gorton, Holly L.2008-12Spehnkouch, Patrick ThomasBiologyLive bait or lures : the effects of temperature on the feeding preferences of Micropterus salmoides, the largemouth bassThe phylogeny of the family Centrarchidae is well documented, and extends back to almost 34 million years ago. From there on, the family has extended its range far beyond its ancestral habitat within the Gulf of Mexico and its tributaries. Centrarchid species are found throughout lentic and lotic environments. Of the 31 species and 9 genera contained within the family, Micropterus salmoides, the largemouth bass, has managed to dominate not only the trophic webs of many of those environments, but also the sportfishing scene as well. Their feeding habits vary according to the environment, though they often correlate with temperature of the environment, be it flowing or still. M. salmoides feed more voraciously with increased temperature, up to an optimum feeding temperature of 26°C (Winemiller and Taylor, 1987), and feeding becomes negligible at or below 10°C (Lemons and Crawshaw, 1985). After an extensive review of the literature, I evaluate in further detail the feeding behavior of the largemouth bass, incorporating temperature, environment, and intra- as well as inter-species competition. At the conclusion of my literature review, I suggest an experimental proposal to gather much needed data on M. salmoides feeding preferences for artificial lures which is otherwise absent from the literature.Ramcharitar, John U.2010-05Fisher, TrinaBiologyCritical analysis of the umbrella species concept in conservation biologyAmong the many concepts in use in conservation biology is the “umbrella species” concept, in which the protection of one species confers protection for other species living within the same habitat. This paper addresses the ways in which the umbrella species system may prove to be inadequate as a conservation tool. Through the examination of such organisms as the California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) and the giant panda (Ailuropoda melonoleuca), along with several others, it becomes clear that a strict definition of what constitutes an umbrella species is of immediate necessity. An umbrella species may have several shortcomings such as low population viability or misidentification, which can lead to the collapse of the umbrella system. This paper suggests that the umbrella species approach be abandoned as a conservation tool for long-term planning, and that conservation efforts turn instead to a more holistic approach of ecosystem management rather than a species-based management approach.Price, J.

[from presentation announcement]Norlock, Kathryn J.2006-05Moore, Campbell ByronEnvironmental StudiesEnvironmental, economic, and social problems of globalization within the context of a sustainable futureA multi-pronged strategy involving governments, economists, environmentalists, civil society, indigenous groups, and ordinary people is needed to help move the world towards a sustainable future where human rights are recognized and the natural world is utilized in the present so as not to impede the rights of future generations or further degrade the amazing natural heritage we are a part of. A quick survey of the solutions I have proposed will show that I believe globalization is both the problem undermining Sustainable Development and the solution to the problems associated with the status quo global economy. A globalization of ideas, law, civil society, and governance is needed to match the globalization of the economy .… The idea of a ‘Global Village’ is not a bad one. The world ‘village’ conjures up images of different and diverse people working together in an idyllic environment to live their lives as they wish and help their neighbors when necessary. But, this idyllic social order is not what globalization has created. Globalization as we know it is heading towards a global serfdom where people and resources are stripped of identity and individuality and forced through the system imposed on them to work for the benefit of a few feudal lords. Today’s feudal lords are the economically and politically powerful, subverting democracy and the freedom of others for their own selfish desires — almost always at the expense of nature. This is not a vision of a sustainable or stable world. The destructive cycle must be broken. A globalization of the interests of the poor and disenfranchised, and ordinary people is necessary to counter the system of globalization that has protected the interests of the few at the costs of the many. All peoples of the world must unite in the pursuit of admirable goal, while still maintaining regional identity and pride, yet respecting others’ rights to do the same. There is no other sustainable option, and the consequences are dire. [from conclusion]Norlock, Kathryn J.2004-05Nelson, Katherine ElizabethEnvironmental StudiesSeeds for growing green schools : an environmental education guideEnvironmental education is an engaging and motivating style of teaching which can significantly improve student academic achievement and test scores, critical and creative thinking, attention, and behavior. However, environmental education plays a limited role in schools due to the focus on state mandated curriculum and standardized test preparation. The consequences of children’s reduced exposure to nature have been documented both in research and anecdotally and include attention difficulties, behavior problems, and the diminished use of senses. Teachers must find ways to accommodate and engage students affected by nature deficits. Environmental education, whether taught on its own or integrated into interdisciplinary studies, is one way of ensuring that all students are able to achieve at high levels. Becoming an effective environmental educator takes time and practice, although it can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Educators must consider effective teaching strategies, expectations for their students, and the logistics of lessons and activities. Ten environmentally-themed lesson plans are included in this guide to help teachers incorporate the environment into the curriculum. These plans include background information and resources to provide a clear and accessible reference and are correlated to Maryland’s Voluntary State Curriculum. Schools that integrate the environment into the curriculum fulfill a major requirement of Green School recognition by the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education (MAEOE). Information about the application process is included. This guide aims to inspire and assist teachers in finding the right place for environmental education in their classrooms and schools.Chandler, Katherine R.2009-05Friedel, Elizabeth AnneEnvironmental StudiesFatal beauty : times of prosperity, hardship, and cultural change on the Eastern ShoreFor those who are familiar with Maryland’s Eastern Shore, isolation and a rural lifestyle have defined the region for the majority of its history. Located on the Delmarva Peninsula, which is named for the three states of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, the Eastern Shore has enjoyed relative seclusion from the chaos of metropolitan sprawl and its highly controversial impacts. Bordered by the Chesapeake Bay on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east, the Delmarva Peninsula is, as Erica Wagenhals of the Institute for Governmental Service describes, “about as close as it can get to being considered an island” (Bell, Favero, and Wagenhals 2005). It is precisely for this reason that the region has largely remained dependent upon a natural resource-based economy. [first paragraph]Sheeran, Kristen A.2005-05Luciano, Christina MarieEnvironmental StudiesEnvironmental history of the Zekiah Swamp and Wicomico River drainagesHumans have inhabited the Zekiah Swamp and Wicomico River Drainage Area for almost 8000 years. Because of this, its environmental history is very much centered on changes in human land use. As human populations grew, the Wicomico drainage area and the Zekiah began to be more intensely utilized. Human population growth continues to be the primary source of environmental problems in these areas. This paper will describe how the landscape has formed and changed, as well as how humans utilized the resources in the area over time.King, Julia A.2012-05Meiklejohn, Anthony StuartEnvironmental StudiesWay of taking careI began studying philosophy early on as a St. Mary’s student, by chance really. I was backing out of the biology department and felt somewhat directionless. Attempting something new I choose an introductory class on western philosophy. Quickly taken by the continual friendly debates that dominated class I had to have more. From there I slowly traveled eastward across the philosophical horizon. I studied some Buddhism and South Asian philosophy in the beginning, and then headed into China. I took a gander across the sea at Shinto and Chan Buddhism, but found a home among the eccentrics in Zhuangzi’s writings. As this was the slow eastward progression on my academic career, my extracurriculars took me in the opposite direction. While searching for ways of building a make shift sauna in my back yard I tripped across the name of Tom Brown. The more I read about him and his wilderness school the more curious I became. Having found no real outlet at school into which I could satisfy my out - of - doors interests, this seemed like a fitting place. The more I got involved the more hooked I became. His philosophy and teaching style paralleled my East Asian studies. His passion and enthusiasm for the outdoors made mine seem petty. I was continually learning more and more about the wilderness and survival, and it seemed only to fuel my passion. The teaching was true “Coyote teaching”; a teaching method driven by the passion of the student. Advances are only made when one skill is mastered and somehow drifts into the next lesson, easier and easier as the student becomes more aware of their interconnection. Spending time with Tom and his fellow teachers has helped expand my spiritual tendencies. I do not necessarily believe in God or the supernatural. But I do believe through our own awareness we may enhance our existence beyond what is strictly considered the physical. What is spiritual is what each of us believes in, and into which we put our faith. These beliefs guide us through life. That is why they must work on both a large and small scale and why we must not let our faith and belief stagnate. Spirituality is necessary for the passionate and intimate existence I believe is necessary to optimize the human experience. These two philosophies have directed the majority of my collegiate experience. Alternating between the two I have spent the last two years focused on practicing and analyzing these philosophies. I would by no means call myself an expert, and have much still to learn about both of these practices. But I hope that I may share some of what I know with others so that we may all enjoy living a little more. [“a note to the reader”]Poor, P. Joan2006-12Norris, Jacqueline CorinnEnvironmental StudiesResidential stormwater best management practices : a survey of a St. Mary’s County neighborhoodI did my St. Mary’s Project on residential stormwater management through the Environmental Studies department. I conducted an online survey about residential stormwater best management practices with participants being homeowners from the Breton Bay neighborhood in Leonardtown. The survey assessed residents’ knowledge about watersheds, stormwater, and fifteen residential best management practices (BMPs), such as rain gardens and rain barrels. It also assessed whether residents have any of the BMPs and if they were willing to install any of them on their property. Finally, the survey gathered some basic information about the residents such as whether they live on waterfront property, how long they’ve lived in the neighborhood, how much money they spend on lawn maintenance, etc. I compared the answers from waterfront residents to those who live on the non-waterfront property. I found that waterfront residents seemed to be more knowledgeable about stormwater management, more likely to have BMPs on their property, and to be more willing to install BMPs. I created a poster outlining my projects and results, and a handout containing information on the fifteen BMPs in the survey, and I presented my project at the St. Mary’s County Going Green Expo on April 21st at the Dr. James A. Forrest Career and Technology Center. Takacs, Jacqueline U.2012-05Everett, Jessica CaitlinEnvironmental StudiesEcotourism and sustainable developmentIn this paper I will strive to address what constitutes ecotourism, and how it fits into the greater theme of sustainable development, particularly in the developing world. In order to examine the issues more closely, I will also take an in-depth look at how ecotourism has manifested itself in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica as well as at the eco-camp at Tumani Tenda in the Gambia.Nguyen, Ho2008-05Selle, Caroline A.Environmental StudiesFossil fueled stories : political change, the American dream, and the Keystone XL controversyIn this paper, I look at how storytelling both creates and influences the outcomes of social movements. I use the Keystone XL pipeline controversy as a case study, partially because there are clear examples of intentional storytelling within the anti-Keystone pipeline movement and also because I am intimately involved with the issue. To gather information, I first interviewed a handful of activists involved in different parts of the anti-pipeline movement. Next, I read dozens of blog posts written by activists about their decision to get involved. Finally, I used newspaper articles (“mainstream journalism”) and academic research on storytelling, narrative, and social movements. Ultimately, I conclude that the Keystone XL issue became a national debate because of storytelling – especially because, through two weeks of arrests, the anti-pipeline movement broke the institutional rules of storytelling and thus garnered massive amounts of attention. Once the issue was a national one, however, the anti-pipeline activists were less successful. Anti-pipeline stories had to compete with the traditional American narrative of prosperity for prominence. In my research, I found three main groups of anti-pipeline narratives. First, there were those who argued that the pipeline would contribute to climate change. Second, some argued that the pipeline would exacerbate current issues of social justice, especially for people of color. And, third, the people of Nebraska argued that the pipeline would threaten their livelihoods and traditional, American way of life if it were to leak and spill into the Ogallala aquifer. The Nebraska story prevailed, and once it was resolved, the pipeline was quickly approved because activists failed to cast it as a harmful object rather than a symbol of prosperity.Eberly, Todd E.2012-05Krembs, Greer ElizabethEnvironmental StudiesSaving the wildlife or the people : is there a balance between conserving wildlife and preserving indigenous cultures in Kenya?Kenya has some of the world’s most diverse wildlife and human cultures, and the two are constantly impacting each other. The wildlife are not receiving proper conservation from people’s impacts and the government is ignoring the people’s need to be protected from the wildlife. Impacts that people have on the wildlife are divided into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct impacts directly affect the lives of the wildlife and include killing for bush-meat, poaching, killing problem animals, and killing as political statements. People’s indirect impacts on wildlife include habitat fragmentation and insularization of protected areas, and habitat displacement and degradation. The wildlife’s impacts on people are destruction of property, livestock injury or death, and human injury or death, and although there are positive impacts—tourism and hunting—neither are available to the people. Based on these impacts, the possible solutions should center around landscape conservation because both the wildlife and people’s cultures are protected, and community-based conservation (CBC) because communities play central roles in the development and management of the projects. Fencing around consolidated areas of agriculture is necessary in some situations to lessen the frequency of crop raiding. Sustainable harvesting programs could be implemented on small scales, with local management by the national parks. If sustainable harvesting programs are not possible, compensation for wildlife damage could be reintroduced since its cancellation in the 1990s. Programs for monitoring poaching and ivory trade, such as CITES’ Monitoring of the Illegal Killing of Elephants, need to be made for efficient and effective. Further habitat fragmentation needs to be prevented and one method that has been successful is to pay landowners to keep their land open. Wildlife and cultural conservation are possible in Kenya under the new landscape conservation paradigm.Williams, William E.2004-05Vossbrinck, Alice MargaretEnvironmental StudiesBuilding a connection to our natural landscape : a guideMy SMP was done to help create a deeper connection between the campus community and our natural environment. Environmental problems are lately becoming of major concern. I believe that my project offers important ways to promote environmental understanding as well as addressing some of the issues. St. Mary’s College has some valuable environmental opportunities but should seek to increase these opportunities. This project had three parts that can be easily broadened. I ordered and installed sixty tree labels that included common name, species name and native range. Additionally I organized a group of students to remove a small portion of the invasive plants on campus. Lastly I ordered native trees and meadow grass to incorporate into the college landscape. Through all parts of my project other students gave me significant help in accomplishing these goals. The feedback from the students has led me to believe that this project has made a positive impact on the campus. My hope is that these ideas will continue and expand in the future.Gorton, Holly L.2007-05Griffin, Shaun HamiltonEnvironmental StudiesLocal environmental awareness experienceSo, the purpose of the SMP, both the paper and experiential ecology tour is to provide an introduction to several examples of Non-Western environmental ideologies and practices. Hopefully, in this way, the project will help active environmentalists be more prepared to make correct choices in their local relationships with the biotic community through an increased awareness of cross cultural models of ecological thought from around the world. [from introduction]Norlock, Kathryn J.2004-12Knipp, Megan A.Environmental StudiesNormative messages influence on conservation behavior : study on the Townhouse GreensThe following study examines the influence of normative messages on subsequent energy consumption behavior on St. Mary’s College of Maryland’s campus. A series of four door hangers, each containing either an injunctive, descriptive, combined descriptive and injunctive normative, or control message, were randomly distributed to the residences of St. Mary’s Townhouse Greens. Although the results were not significant, there was a reduction in energy use over time after the distribution of the normative message. A post-test self-report survey revealed significant correlations between the influence of the normative message, intention to perform energy conservation behavior, and reasons for adopting behavior.Platt, Richard D.2011-05Sedon, Samantha RoseEnvironmental StudiesCooking and community : hope for the American food systemThe hope for the future of the American food system is in reclaiming cooking. Cooking allows us to pay attention to the ingredients we use, and to the people we share meals with. As consumers and eaters we have the choice to reject industrially produced and processed foods and we can choose food that comes from and is shared within our local communities. Starting with the early 1900’s, I have outlined the historical background of scientific cooking and the American industrialized food system that convinced us to be more concerned with convenience than flavor and health. I argue that consumers have the power to avoid advertisements for conventionally produced foods and to make food choices that will nourish our minds as well as our bodies. By incorporating personal nonfiction about my experiences in creating new food traditions, as well as including recipes, I hope to empower us to embrace a cooking community that is based in morality and sustainability.Anderson, Karen L.2012-05Flexner, Robert WilliamsEnvironmental StudiesDeveloping a forest stewardship planThere are many properties in St. Mary’s County, as well as throughout the state and country which require a detailed forest management plan in order to best preserve, protect and harvest timber. A forest management plan is usually undertaken by a registered forester and involves many pieces of data to be collected and analyzed to give the best possible recommendations for up to 15 years into the future for a given piece of land. The lands can be owned by either the state or a private owner. The property of Richard C. Wildes was one which required such a management plan. The type of plan which Mr. Wildes received is a forest stewardship plan, one which is intended neither for the purposes of commercial harvesting, nor for preferential taxation. This particular type of plan can be enacted by a lay person, or an unregistered forester. The plan was formed under the guidance of a local forester. Poor, P. Joan2007-05Flanigan, Eileen LouiseEnvironmental StudiesNature versus drugs : alternative treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorderThere has in the last half-century been a change from an agriculturally based culture to a culture focused on urban development and technological productivity. This has lead to an environment of constant stimulation and high pressure to succeed. One of the outcomes of this over-stimulation is an increase in learning and behavioral disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The main symptoms of ADHD are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. While the exact cause is unknown, ADHD is thought to be from an interaction between vulnerable genes controlling extracellular levels of dopamine in the brain and certain environmental risk factors. Pharmaceutical treatments focus on correcting dopamine levels in the brain, correcting for the genetic flaws. These treatments are today by far the most common treatment of ADHD. Because ADHD is usually a lifelong disorder, people often take their medication long-term. While short term improvements are clearly shown in patients taking these drugs, the effectiveness of long-term use and its possible risks are unknown. Alternative treatments to medication focus on decreasing environmental risk factors. Several of these focus on increasing the ability of the subject to self-control their symptoms. One treatment that recent research is finding to be very effective is Nature Therapy. It has been found that spending time in nature doing unstructured activities can decrease the severity of the common symptoms of ADHD. These alternatives to medication are not often used because lack of public knowledge of these possibilities. Another reason is that these treatments often take more effort on the caregiver’s part and do not have the clear immediate improvements in ADHD symptoms that medications produce.Chandler, Katherine R.2009-05Stillwell, Jeffrey AlanEnvironmental StudiesSt. Mary’s College of Maryland carbon profileThis [SMP] has been designed to produce a carbon profile for St. Mary’s College of Maryland. The carbon profile presented here details the carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane emissions produced by the operation of the campus and the campus community and provides a means of comparing individual sources of emission. This report is meant to be used as an administrative decision making tool to aid the college in identifying its greatest contributing aspects, as a historical reference to identify how past trends have affected our greenhouse gas emission, and as a means of directing the advancement of sustainability initiatives.Larsen, Randolph K.2008-05Hachadorian, JasonEnvironmental StudiesVacant lots to garden plots : a case study of community gardens in Baltimore CityThis project examines the current literature regarding urban community gardening efforts in the United States paying particular attention to the historical context of the movement. Urban food problems such as food deserts and supermarket redlining are discussed, with special attention given to the reasons and responses to these issues. The movement in Baltimore City is highlighted and contrasted to the larger movement in the United States. Four urban community gardens in Baltimore City were visited as part of assessing the current situation in the city. Successes and failures from other parts of the country are also noted. Community gardens represent an important response to food access inequalities in Baltimore City, but are unable to address the problem in its entirety, primarily due to the movement’s infancy in the City.Roberts, William C.2012-05Williams, James ConradEnvironmental StudiesGoats vs. aliens : an analysis of a goat browsing’s effectiveness on removing invasive plant species at Historic St. Mary’s CityThis St. Mary’s Project explores the experiment at Historic St. Mary’s City in the summer and fall of 2011 in which a herd of goats was used as an herbicide-free method to eliminate invasive plant species. In my paper, I analyzed invasive non-native plants found at the site and included descriptions of the plants, brief histories of their arrival in the United States, how they escaped from cultivation, the sorts of habitats that they colonize, why they are difficult to eradicate, their occurrence on site at HSMC, methods for their removal, and recommendations of native plants for substitution. Non-native invasive plant species found at Historic St. Mary’s City include: English Ivy (Hedera helix), Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), Bradford Pear (Pyrus calleryana ‘Bradford’), Multiflora Rose (Rosa multiflora), and Common Privet (Ligustrum vulgare). The results of the project demonstrated that the goats were effective as a first measure on the site to remove these invasive plants; however, manual and mechanical labor is required as a follow-up.Chandler, Katherine R.2012-05Simmers, MeganEnvironmental StudiesTropical Caribbean ecosystemsThis webpage has been created as a platform to share my research on tropical ecology.

Despite receiving almost $4 billion in official development assistance from the United States in 2009, Africa continues to suffer from poverty, poor governance, and environmental and human rights crises. The types of development projects to which the United States government disburses funds contribute to the intensification of poverty and environmental crises in some African nations. This paper also addresses appropriate solutions to some of the problems of international aid, including increased funding for indigenous sustainable development organizations and decreased assistance to African governments.Eberly, Todd E.2011-05Kaylor, Meghan RoseHistoryBrief and truer report of the new found land of Virginia“A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia” was originally written by Thomas Harriot in 1587 and republished in Theodor de Bry’s America Part I in 1590 with engravings of the John White watercolors and additional comments made by Harriot. John White was a commissioned artist on the second expedition to Roanoke in 1585. His mission along with Thomas Harriot was to report back to England the conditions experienced in Virginia such as the vegetation, animals, and people who may inhabit the area. Harriot was to be the recorder and White the ‘photographer’. Their findings subsequently served as propaganda for English colonization. Both White and Harriot purposely depicted Virginia in a fashion that would entice English settlement, neglecting the hardships and violence they encountered while in the New World. White also drew the New World Indian in Europeanized fashion which is further enhanced by the engraver Theodor de Bry. This can be seen through his various watercolors and de Bry’s engravings. The figures that are drawn were placed into classical positions and the background material was enhanced to suit the European observer’s eye. White has long been noted for his ethnographic accuracy and drawing “exactly what he saw,” but his Natives are drawn with obvious classical conventions that were common in art in the late sixteenth century.King, Julia A.2006-12Smith, Kevin ThomasComputer ScienceCreating geospecific 3-dimensional databases for real-time visual simulationsVirtual SMCM is a 3-dimensional model of St. Mary's College of Maryland as it exists today. The database utilizes geospecific imagery and correlated vector data to place 3-dimensional features very accurately upon a detailed terrain skin. Unlike the extraordinarily detailed landscapes you might find in computer-rendered films, this database can be traversed in real-time. Whereas it may take overnight to render a scene for Hollywood, the database is redrawn at 60fps, fast enough to make any lag unnoticeable to the naked eye. The buildings and other 3-dimensional features, including trees, light posts, etc. were created in MultiGen Creator, a modeling tool heavily utilized in real-time database development. The database was assembled using Terrex TerraVista, a comprehensive tool that simplifies the integration of all the database components including: elevation data, raster imagery, vectors, models, and textures. Specific sources from this database include Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), Digital Feature Analysis Data (DFAD), Digital Orthographic Quarter Quadrant (DOQQ) imagery, hundreds of textures derived from digital stills around the campus, and dozens of models.Sterling, Ivan2003-05Tornabene, Michael WilliamBiologySt. Mary’s gone wild : a vegetative survey of both maintained and un-maintained lawnsSaint Mary’s College of Maryland has joined a growing trend among business to appear more green and have a more beneficial impact on the environment. The college has a series of areas called Audubon Wildlife habitat restoration areas, which are designed to increase animal and vegetative biodiversity. These plots were maintained as lawns for a number of years prior to April 2010, at which point they were no longer maintained. I performed a survey in five of these plots throughout the campus to determine if there was an increase in vegetative biodiversity. After sampling in both fall 2010, and Spring 2011, I found that biodiversity in the unmaintained plots was higher in terms of species cover and in terms of how many individuals of each species were present in all cases, and was significantly higher in three of four cases (T-tests, p<0.05). In addition to that, I found that biodiversity increased in all plots from the fall to the spring (T-test, p<0.05). This study while being detailed and showing clear trends begs for more research on how wildlife reclamation projects should be performed. Gorton, Holly L.2011-05Scudder, Chelsea JoyBiologyToxin production in sexually reproducing Convolutriloba macropygaConvolutriloba macropyga, an acoelus flatworm, is shield shaped and when mature can grow up to 8 mm long and 6 mm wide. It possesses two round lateral caudal lobes and one to nine median caudal lobes. Like other members of the genus, Convolutriloba macropyga shares a symbiotic relationship with zoochlorellae. This symbiosis gives the worm’s body a green-brown coloration. Also visually prominent in the flatworm’s body are aposematically colored red rhabdoid cells. When ruptured these cells release a yellow-orange toxin. Toxin production in Convolutriloba macropyga could potentially be different from other toxic flatworms. Most flatworms acquire their toxin, but evidence suggests that C. macropyga may produce its own toxin. Observations under UV light have shown an absence of algae in both eggs removed from pregnant macropyga worms and in eggs collected after oviposition. UV observations have demonstrated the absence of toxin in eggs prior to oviposition and the development of toxin in eggs collected post-oviposition. These findings suggest that larval worms produce the toxin themselves independent of either their parents or their symbiotic zoochlorellae.Hatch, Walter I.2010-05Frederic, Ann EliseArt HistoryGolden age of British railway posters : romanticism and modernity in advertising imageryIn 1923, the British railway system was amalgamated into four regional and geographic companies. The years between 1923 and 1947 are known as the golden age of posters. During this time innovations in graphic design flourished and some of the railways used these new techniques in developing their visual advertising campaigns. In my paper, I looked at the way fine art movements at the time, influenced graphic art and design, and examined the ways these images were used in developing advertising that not only looked good, but worked in a poster format. I focused my investigation on imagery that I saw as expressing the tension of the railway, as both a possible means for escaping modern life into the great “outdoors” and the representation of the train as a modern and innovative form of transportation. Poster designers constructed images of nature to advertise the romance of travel and sight seeing. While the train advertised where it could take its passenger, it also had to advertise itself. Images of the train began to appear in posters, using modern art movement vocabularies to advertise the speed and efficiency of the trains. As a form of advertisement, these posters were created for public consumption and therefore needed public spaces in which to be presented. The railway station became a gallery space, where it could show its work to all its passengers.Lucchesi, Joseph E.2004-05Giuliano, Angela MarieBiologyEffects of urbanization and prioritizing potential restoration sites in Hilton RunLand use, particularly urbanization, can greatly affect water quality. Negative effects include channelization, higher stormwater flows, higher nutrient and sediment concentrations, and decreased biodiversity. This study examined the effects of urbanization on Hilton Run, a tributary to the St. Mary’s River in St. Mary’s County, Maryland. This watershed has experienced extensive development pressure with the growth of the Patuxent Naval Air Station in Lexington Park, Maryland. This study quantified instream habitat and documented the extent of erosion in the watershed using a geographic information system. The results of the study showed high amounts of erosion in the lower section of catchment 201. In the upper portion of the catchment, the stream sediment was mostly silt, common in areas with agriculture and mining activity. This study lends further support to previous studies which suggest the large beaver ponds are mitigating the effects of urbanization in the watershed. Previous studies have prioritized catchment 201 for restoration because of its low levels of imperviousness and its high biological integrity. Because of the extensive erosion documented in this study, it is suggested that restoration priorities be placed on the lower section of catchment 201.Paul, Robert W.2005-05Campanella, Camille MariaEconomicsCrouching farmer, hidden dragon : how China’s economic growth has affected the Argentine economyThe economic relationship between Argentina and China surrounds Argentina’s booming soy industry and China’s vastly increasing demand for natural resources. However, the relationship between China and Argentina cannot simply be described via supply and demand; the ebb and flow of goods and services between the countries is influenced by dynamic and complex cultures, economics, and politics. Argentina, the smaller, less influential, and (in GDP terms) poorer country gains more as a whole from bilateral trade with China than China does with Argentina. However, China remains committed to the relationship with Argentina because of Argentina’s productive soy industry. While both parties gain from trade, Argentina, a politically stubborn nation, still imposes restrictions on its own industry and on incoming Chinese imports. Argentina’s actions can be explained easily through an examination of its turbulent economic past, but they seem irrational in light of the current global economic climate. Certainly, Argentina feels the need to maximize gains from trade with China, which explains its high export taxes and import restrictions, but at times it has taken these measures too far. In the recent past, Argentina has angered not only its own people, but also the Chinese government through inappropriate policy measures. In order to sustain healthy economic and political relations with China, Argentina must enact liberal trade policies and diversify its exports beyond the soy industry.Dillingham, Alan E.2012-05Smith, Nathan R.PhilosophyThe American Gastronome: why the slow food movement is needed in the United StatesCurrent agricultural methods and food consumption habits in the United States are harming our bodies, communities, and land for the sake of profit and speed. The effects of this lifestyle are unsustainable and unjust. Slow Food, a cultural preservation movement born in Italy in the late 1980’s and focused on food as means of preservation and moral education, aims to counter the fast-paced lifestyle that America was exporting to Italy. The founder of the movement, Carlo Petrini, calls its members gastronomes. Gastronomes follow the principles of Slow Food in order to preserve distinct food traditions, sustain the planet, and act justly towards people and communities involved in food production. I am calling for Americans to join the Slow Food movement and create a community of American gastronomes. What this will take is a change in our conception of food. Slow Food views food as everything involved in its process of becoming, thus opening all elements of production to moral scrutiny. This idea, though difficult to adopt, is the key to meeting the goal of Slow Food, a goal that is desperately needed in the United States.Taber, Michael S.2013-05Forbes, Amy LeeEconomicsFinding an alternative crop for tobacco after the Maryland state tobacco buyout : the case for grapesOver the past three hundred years, Maryland has recently seen a change in agriculture. This change has been brought forward by the Maryland State Tobacco Buyout. In 1999, former Maryland Governor Perris Glendening and the Maryland Department of Agriculture initiated the Maryland State Tobacco Buyout. This buyout is a voluntary program, in which the farmer when taking the Buyout must agree to remain in agriculture for over a ten-year period. Finding an alternative crop that would provide farmers with an income level more than or equal to tobacco is the focus of this research. Of the twelve wineries in Maryland, all are in need of grapes, in which they are encouraging farmers within the state to grow this particular crop. Having conducted a survey on two hundred two buyout farmers in St. Mary’s County, showed that farmers have an interest in alternatives. Having ventured to a local commercial grape producer helped with the process of this research. With much help from this farmer, the idea of grapes being grown as an alternative may become true in Southern Maryland. What is important though is that the grape growers must first research on how grapes can be productive by using specific training methods and soil types. It is through this research that grapes could be the next best thing to tobacco.Poor, P. Joan2003-05Painter, Kathleen R.BiologyStatus of the barn owl (Tyto alba) in St. Mary’s County, MarylandThis project is a continuation of Melissa Boyle’s St. Mary's Project on the Barn Owl in St. Mary’s County, begun in the Fall of 1998. Boyle constructed and erected 16 owl nest boxes and searched marshes and duck blinds for owls. I monitored the boxes she constructed, used aerial photographs to determine unexplored areas of good habitat, and erected seven additional boxes in those areas. As of the end of her study period in the Spring of 1999, Boyle had observed no owl activity at her box sites. Since that time, a landowner at one of her sites has reported two sightings of a barn owl, and I have collected barn owl feathers and pellets from this farm and from three other sites. There was no evidence of nesting activity in the boxes. I compared the results of the St. Mary’s County Barn Owl Project with similar projects in Calvert and Prince George’s Counties, and compiled statistics on the changes in agricultural practices in all three counties since 1954. I believe that barn owls are still present in small numbers in St. Mary's County, but that they are more scarce than in past years. This apparent decline coincides with a decline in overall agricultural land in the area, and may be due to decreased habitat. The barn owl nest box program has been more successful in Calvert and Prince George’s Counties than in St. Mary’s, possibly due to differences in types of land and habitat available.Willoughby, Ernest J.2000-05Bumgarner, Suzanne NicoleEconomicsSouthern Maryland farmers' markets : the value consumers place on local agricultural productsThe overall goal of this research is to better understand the customer tastes and preferences for local agricultural products at the St. Mary’s County, California Farmers’ Market in Maryland. This paper focuses on expectations toward produce at the local farmers’ market by administering a questionnaire during the 2006 market season from July through late-October. Results from the questionnaire found St. Mary’s consumers comparable to the typical consumer found at farmers’ markets across the United States according to current literature. In general consumers expect lower prices and better quality of produce at farmers’ markets than at grocery stores.Poor, P. Joan2006-12Fennelly, NicoleBiologyNutrient Management Plans: A Compromise between Agriculture & the Chesapeake BayAgriculture within the Chesapeake Bay region has been a major contributor to the Bay’s nutrient loading. Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers and manure feed harmful algal blooms that deplete the bay of oxygen and harm its overall ecosystem. In 1989, Maryland developed the Maryland Nutrient Management Program that requires farmers to follow a nutrient management plan designed from soil analyses on their farm. This plan aims to minimize the usage of nutrients and maximize uptake by the crops and therefore reduce the amount of nutrients leaching into the environment. Statistics from the Maryland Department of Agriculture revealed that only 73% of Maryland farmers were in full compliance with the nutrient management plan and thus urged me to perform a review of the program to see what is deterring 100% compliance from the farmers and what could encourage it. In this project I interviewed four Maryland farmers and two nutrient management officials responsible for implementing nutrient management plans and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the program as they see it as well as its overall effectiveness. The participants gave overall good reviews of the program and gave me valuable insight on how well the nutrient management plans work out in the field. Using an analysis of this research and my interview responses, I made recommendations for how the Maryland Nutrient Management Program could be even more effective in reducing agricultural nutrient run-off into the Chesapeake Bay from agriculture. Paul, Robert W.2014-05Volpitta, Alice MarieBiologyHow do direct and diffuse light differentially affect chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in morphologically distinct leaves?Models of global climate change predict an increase in cloud cover and atmospheric water vapor in the near future. Additionally, air pollution levels are continuing to rise around the world, thereby increasing the amount of particulate matter in the air. Both the water vapor and particulates will scatter sunlight, effectively increasing the amount of diffuse light that reaches the earth’s surface. Experiments conducted under diffuse-light conditions show increased photosynthetic efficiency at the canopy level and for understory plants, due to a more uniform distribution of light to leaves that would otherwise be shaded when exposed to direct light. In contrast, photosynthesis at the leaf level is enhanced under direct light. Here I use measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence to assess the photochemical efficiency of PSII under direct and diffuse light of equal irradiances in species with structurally different leaves: Magnolia grandiflora, Antirrhinum majus, and Vicia faba. The rate of electron transport is significantly higher in direct light than in diffuse light for both M. grandiflora and V. faba leaves.Gorton, Holly L.2008-05Wilhelm, Matthew LucasBiologyAlarm signaling in UV damaged soft coralMarine species have adapted many defense strategies to cope with predation and disturbance in their surrounding environment. Chemical alarm signaling has been one strategy that provides an effective means to warn conspecifics of potential dangers in the area. This strategy is highly useful in the phylum Cnidarians, which includes the soft coral Capnella. Chemical alarm signaling in Capnella has been highly effective in warning for predation, but its effectiveness in warning for other hazards, such as UV radiation, is not well known. The research for this experiment focuses on determining if UV radiation can act as a stimulus for chemical alarm signaling in Capnella and in determining if UVA (320-400nm) or UVB (290-320) radiation promotes a higher level of response.Hatch, Walter I.2007-05Capone, Emily ElizabethPsychologyInvestigations into the effectiveness of alternative medicine from traditional Asian practicesThe term alternative medicine encompasses any therapy not a part of conventional modern medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda are alternative medical systems that have been practiced for thousands of years in China and India, respectively. The traditional Chinese herb Huperzia serrata and Ayurvedic herb Bacopa monniera have historically been used for memory enhancement. Studies investigating the effects of Huperzia serrata and Bacopa monniera on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cognitive and neurological symptoms are proposed. Another alternative therapy from TCM is acupuncture. In the United States acupuncture is most often used to treat pain. A study investigating the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain and inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis is also proposed.Bailey, Aileen M.2010-05Clayton, JessicaPolitical ScienceThe Eclipse of Individuality: The Food Industry in Today's Advanced CapitalismIn this paper, I pursue a critical analysis of America’s contemporary food system to argue that as an arm of advanced capitalism, it threatens the development of individuality through modes such as marketing, commodification, and advertisement of false needs and desires to consumers. Specifically, those methods preclude the hard work, struggle and creative potential found in working hands-on with our food at its source. As a result, our individual potentiality is exchanged for a more lethargic and effortless existence as consumers. But before diving into the evidence of repressed individuality, I demonstrate the false sense of individuality Americans value today. Philosophical works derived from early American settlement and expansion describe the American character as a self-reliant, hardworking individual. This account helpfully demonstrates the lack of individuality and false understanding of freedom actually characterizing Americans in today’s American food system. To develop an initial understanding of the individual as threatened, I primarily utilize Critical Theory from Theodore Adorno’s “culture industry” and many of Herbert Marcuse’s pieces on advanced capitalism. Once the relationship between advanced capitalism, its “culture industry”, and the resulting loss of individuality is demonstrated through Critical Theory, I resort to a handful of historical narratives to illustrate the transformed relationship between the individual and food through the post-WWII industrialization of the American food system. It is at this point that the parallel threat to the individual posed by the culture industry and the American food industry--both arms of advanced capitalist order-- will become apparent. Boros, Diana2014-05Garvey, Leslie A.BiologyAmphibian population declines : causes and theoriesAmphibians are considered by the scientific community to be the early warning system for problems in the environment. They are very sensitive to contaminants and changes in their surroundings because their eggs lack protective shells, they have semi-permeable skin, and most have an aquatic stage during development. Recent reports of declining populations and site specific extinction events are cause for concern. I performed a literature review of the research into possible causes of these population declines. In this paper I site specific examples of the present lines of research, outline some of the current theories to explain these population declines, and discuss the possible implications for global environmental problems.Crawford, Karen2002-05McVae, Bridget ChristineHistoryLost but not forgotten : an analysis of shipwrecks on the Chesapeake BayThis is a database and analysis of shipwrecks in the Chesapeake ranging from pre-colonial times to the present. This project represents the continuation and expansion of a project begun in 2004 to create a searchable database of Chesapeake Bay shipwrecks in Maryland waters. Begun solely as a Microsoft Access database recording the particulars of each wreck, the project has expanded to include a Geographic Information System (GIS) component. The inclusion of the GIS aspect allows for examination of wreck distribution by various features including vessel type, means of propulsion, cause of casualty, and even the time of year in which the casualty occurred. The paper goes beyond a simple explanation of the database construction, and endeavors to illustrate how this research can be used for historical analysis purposes and resource management, primarily archaeological in nature. Two case studies - of Southern Maryland and war on the Chesapeake - were used to demonstrate how this combination of sources can be used to go beyond merely recording location information and allow a more comprehensive analysis of a region using two different approaches - historical and archaeological. This work will eventually become incorporated into the State of Maryland’s archaeological records and become the system of wreck management state.Hall, Linda J.2006-05King, Mary AnnBiologyUnusual animal behavior : a component in earthquake predictionUnusual animal behavior has been observed prior to earthquakes for thousands of years. There have been many accounts, mostly in China and Japan, of unusual animal behavior being observed prior to an earthquake. Many Western Scientists are skeptical as to whether it is possible to predict an earthquake or if it is luck of the draw. However, with an increase in knowledge and understanding of earthquakes there has been growing support of earthquake prediction. There have been earthquakes that have been successful predicted, with unusual animal behavior being a component in earthquake prediction. One example is the first successfully predicted earthquake in Haicheng, China 1976. Scientists have obtained research that animals have sensory mechanisms that sense the low-frequency seismic waves or the seismic electrical signals that radiate from the epicenter prior to the earthquake occurring. Most animals have specific mechanisms that sense low-frequency seismic waves from an earthquake because low-frequency vibrations are used in communication, courting, defense, or the warning of the presence of predators. I am suggesting using unusual animal behavior as a component in earthquake prediction, along with the seismic technology that is available to sense geological changes in the earth’s surface.Williams, William E.2009-05Nguyen, Minh BaoBiologyEffect of white noise on primary stress response in zebrafish (Danio rerio)Very little is known about the effects of chronic anthropogenic noise on fish physiology. Furthermore, little research has been done on the stress response of fishes to long-term noise exposure. Zebrafish are an appealing model for a noise/stress study because they are hearing specialists and a model organism. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) are exposed to Gaussian white noise (114 db re1uPa) over a one hour period. Zebrafish cortisol levels are tested at 0, 15, 20, 40, and 60 minutes of white noise exposure to determine stress response. Cortisol concentrations over time did not prove significant against each other (ANOVA; p > 0.05).Ramcharitar, John U.2010-05Walker, Sarah McCreadyBiologyCorrelations between nutrient and steroid hormone concentrations in Chesapeake Bay tributaries receiving poultry wasteNatural sex steroid hormones excreted into the environment from human and animal waste can act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals that mimic endogenous hormones and alter reproduction in wildlife. Animal waste and sewage treatment plants are the two greatest sources of nutrients and the natural steroid hormones estrogen and testosterone. While the source and transport of nutrients has been studied in depth, the fate of steroid hormones in the environment is not fully understood, despite occurring in concentrations known to alter endocrine systems in aquatic animals. In this study I examined correlations between hormone concentrations and nutrient concentrations in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay receiving poultry effluent. In collaboration with the Wye Institute of Maryland I collected samples from tributaries of the Choptank River during the first spring storms, when poultry manure is washed off crops into adjacent streams. I determined nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations and 17ß-estradiol and testosterone concentrations in each water sample and ran bivariate correlation tests. Significant amounts of hormones were found in the Chesapeake Bay watershed; 17 of the 18 tributaries contained estradiol concentrations known to feminize male fish (>10 ng/L). The maximum estradiol concentration (112 ng/L) was found downstream of the Easton sewage treatment plant. Estradiol and testosterone concentrations were both positively correlated with nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations. Phosphorous and ammonia. were the best predictors of hormone concentration in the storm runoff conditions. Gorton, Holly L.2006-05Davis, Elizabeth ForsChemistryDetermination of hexabromocyclododecane in Chesapeake Bay fishCommercial hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a brominated flame retardant (BFR) commonly used in polystyrene foams. 1,2,5,6,9,10-HBCD is synthesized using a process that produces a raecemic mixture of three diastereomers: a-, b-, and y-. This study employs liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to detect and quantify the three enantiomers of HBCD in fish collected from the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Twenty two samples of various fish species were analyzed. Total HBCD concentration ranged from not being detected (nd) to 0.3411 ng g-1 (wet weight; w/w). Isomer specific concentrations ranged from nd to 0.2950, 0.0347, and 1.7900 ng g-1 for a-, b-, and y-, respectively. The highest total HBCD concentration number was found in a sample of white perch (Morone americanus) caught in the Upper Magothy River. Though the literature suggests that the a- isomer should exist at a higher concentration in fish samples, this study found that no one isomer was consistently higher than the others. The only sample with detected b- concentrations was a striped bass (Morone saxatilis) sample from the Chesapeake Bay, North of Swan Point.Larsen, Randolph K.2005-05Van Parys, Rachel SarahSociologyDecision-making processes and behaviors of St. Mary’s College of Maryland students regarding anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis while traveling abroad in malaria-endemic areasSt. Mary’s College of Maryland (SMCM) has many students who choose to study abroad in malaria-endemic areas. As malaria is a serious and devastating disease, anti-malarial medications play a vital role in the health of these students. This research sought to understand the decision-making processes and behaviors of SMCM students regarding these medications, including different modes of influence, compliance, and the presence of side effects. I have found that SMCM students often do not understand the risks of not taking anti-malarial medications, and have dangerously low rates of compliance. Awareness of these issues will hopefully lead to increased appropriate and adequate anti-malarial coverage of students while they study abroad.Osborn, Elizabeth A.2012-05Schneider, Alexander ReedEnglishAutumn ashAutumn Ash is set in a post-apocalyptic future where ash falls like snow and humanity has been split in two. The majority lives far below the surface in military-style bunkers and have become listless, surviving without purpose or point. The rest of humanity still walks the surface, but they have succumbed to their most primal instincts and become barely more than beasts and monsters. The plot of the story centers on the grown orphan, Ethan Straussman, his life and thoughts, and his role in the fate of not only of his bunker, but ultimately, in the redemption of humanity. Told from his perspective, the novella is highly introspective and often volleys between bittersweet memories and present events. Ethan’s mental wanderings often lead to his father and his disappearance, a critical event in the narrator’s life. The writing is gritty and dramatic, often employing a leaning balance of description and dialogue, tinged with a melancholic human. Though dark, hidden within the depths of the novella is a burning hope that waits patiently to illuminate the shadows of the dark and gray world it calls home. When the end seems near, Ethan and his fellows find purpose for the first time in their lives and summon forth a courage previously unknown to them, though their bravery may not be enough to save them. The return of a mysterious man ignites what is left of the spark not only in Ethan but everyone shackled beneath the surface.Gabriel, Gerald D.2009-05Ruthenberg-Marshall, DanielTheater, Film, and Media StudiesFaces of the Appalachian TrailFaces of the Appalachian Trail is a 25 minute video documentary looking at life along the trail, everything that goes into making it possible, and the different personalities that are drawn to the trail. Film student Danny Ruthenberg-Marshall spent five months traveling along the Appalachian Trail by foot and by car, talking with all different categories of people affected by it: thru-hikers, day hikers, trail maintainers, trail administrators, hostel owners, and more. These people came from all walks of life, from the big city and the backwoods, academics and illiterates, rich and poor. The one thing everyone had in common: a love of the Appalachian Trail. In the film, we meet Traveler, an eighteen-year-old thru-hiker from Illinois taking a gap year between high school and college. Laurie Potteiger gives us a rundown on the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, her employer and the managing organization of the trail. A cook and river guide named Vish tells us about his experience on the trail after being forced to abort his thru-hike attempt due to a knee injury. Bob Peoples talks about Kincora, his hostel in Tennessee which has served more than 16,000 hikers. Throughout the film, Dewlap, Rainer and Sly walk with us along their hiker marathon, a 26.2 mile day heading into Damascus, Virginia. Faces of the Appalachian Trail is an original look at the many diverse personalities who have their lives shaped by the trail. Each person has their own unique story to share, and they invite you to join them on their journey through life along the Appalachian Trail.Ellsworth, David N.2011-05Auger, Paul L.BiologyQuantitative comparison of two marine mesocosmal filtration systemsSuccess within any aquatic field, be it aquaculture, the tropical fish hobby, or research mesocosms, depends on the systems which are used to maintain water quality. Over the decades new and exciting means of nutrient removal have been developed. Many different systems have been used and tested independently showing effective control over the amounts of organic wastes. These systems are also able to keep the quality of the water stable enough to provide proper habitat for the survival of many aquatic species. In marine research both the NMR plenum and Berlin foam fractionation methods fall into this category. These two systems are probably the most popular in use today. However, neither has been pitted head to head in a quantitative analysis. This study hopes to provide some conclusive data showing which system is more effective.Hatch, Walter I.1998-05Osterberger, Michelle A.BiologyMicrobial community development : a look at microbial community development through use of biofilm communities and studying the effects of phosphorus on community developmentWater quality plays an important role in the community development and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems. Monitoring changes in biotic factors, such as community development and biodiversity, enables us to comprehend how abiotic factors, such as water quality, impact the health of aquatic ecosystems. A new and innovative way to monitor marine communities and to observe the impact that factors such as water quality have on them is through the use of biofilm communities. Biofilm is a layer of bacteria that provides an advantageous environment for particular invertebrate organisms, which in turn forms biofilm communities that can be used for study and observation. This research observed the general process of community development of sessile organisms and than specifically looked at the effects of the introduction of excess phosphorus on water quality and the development of the sessile community. The hypothesis for this research is that changes in water quality, such as the addition of excess phosphorus, will decrease biodiversity within the biofilm communities. The research was conducted in two parts; one part looked at community development along the Patapsco River and the other part took a specific look at the effects of excess phosphorus on community development and biodiversity. Although statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference among biofilm communities exposed to different water quality conditions in both parts of the research, key observation were made in community development and the impact of water quality on that development. The first study illustrated the effects of competition and predation upon community development. The second study revealed how the addition of excess phosphorus can affect water quality by altering dissolved oxygen concentration and thus altering the community development. Many other key observations are made during the research which could lead to possible future study.Paul, Robert W.2000-12Robey, Joanna MarlowBiologyDevelopmental effects of exposure to androgenic and antiandrogenic chemicals in the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki)In this study I tested the effects of methyl-testosterone (M-T; androgen) and flutamide (antiandrogen) on the sexual development of the mosquitofish. It has been shown that exogenous androgens can induce elongation and increases to the number of segments in the anal fin both males and females. In the first experiment, I showed that the number of segments in the anal fin is a more sensitive measure of androgen exposure than anal fin elongation, as the difference in the number of segments, but not anal fin length, was greater for both sexes in the M-T (0, 3, 30, and 300 ppb) treated fish. No overall effect was seen in anal fin development in fish treated with flutamide. In the second experiment, fish exposure to a 3 ppb M-T for 7, 24, 42, or 56 days, grew longer anal fins for all time periods, so even the shortest exposure altered the development of the anal fin. No difference was seen in number of segments for any time period. These data support action on the androgen receptor as the cause of masculinization in this study and in studies finding similar results in situ.Orlando, Edward F.2004-05Goerling, Genevieve BlytheAnthropologyComparative archaeological analysis of three 17th-century Catholic mission sites in North AmericaThis paper compares the archaeology of three Catholic mission sites from the 17th century – Sainte Marie among the Hurons, Saint Inigoes, and San Luis. The sites are located in French Canada, the English Mid-Atlantic, and Spanish Florida respectively. My approach models James Deetz’s call to produce ‘archaeographies,’ or ethnographies of material life in the past. Through this approach, differences in how the sites have been excavated are minimized as the comparative focus is on the interpretations. The founders should have shared similar goals, such as the promotion of European culture through colonization and the conversion of native populations to Christianity. Yet, my analysis reveals differences between the missionary efforts linked to both varying New World environments and cultural homelands, both European and Native.King, Julia A.2009-05Reif, Randall DeanChemistryConstructing a superior arsenic detectorArsenic is a known human carcinogen. Over the past few years arsenic concentrations in groundwater have become a serious environmental concern. For this reason it has become critical to identify methods of measuring trace levels of arsenic that are inexpensive and field deployable. In response to this we have constructed an inexpensive, sensitive, and field deployable instrument that measures trace levels of inorganic arsenic. This instrument uses an intense chemiluminescent reaction between arsine and ozone over a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to correlate the intensity of the light emitted to the concentration of arsenic in the water. The instrument uses a syringe pump to distribute the proper amount of the reagents to a reaction chamber where the sample is first acidified then the As is reduced to arsine using sodium borohydride. The arsine is then pumped along with the ozone to the reaction cell over the PMT. The preliminary trials using this newly constructed instrument indicate an unknown error in the amplifier circuit causing the signal to remain a constant +15 volts which matches the voltage from the power supply. Once remedied the instrument should function properly.Larsen, Randolph K.2006-05Weirich, Sarah JaneArt HistoryArt in National Parks: exploring the roles of landscape artists as preservation advocatesThis art historical St. Mary’s Project explores the changing ideas of land preservation that have been incorporated into the work of artists connected with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The SMP studies the artists’ involvement with the U.S. National Parks ranging from the parks’ inception to the present day. The emphasis of the SMP will be placed on the contemporary artists working within individual U.S. National Park artist in residence programs. This contemporary study serves to anchor the historic artists who also worked in the NPS. The SMP explores the evolving portrayals of ecological restoration and its importance in preserving land through visual representation. With an understanding of these artists’ intentions and commissions concerning the NPS, I then pose the question: how can these artists be considered advocates as environmental stewards and how does their art serve their stewardship goals?Lucchesi, Joseph E.2013-05McIsaac, Naomi RhodesArt HistoryCraft, commerce, and the environment : art in America’s national parksMy St. Mary’s Project is the result of a two month long trip across the country, where I traveled to twelve different national parks. It is an investigation of twentieth century and contemporary art that is sold in the national parks or in the gateway towns just outside the park’s boarders, with a specific focus on craft. I chose to separate my SMP into three different essays that focus on the three main factors that influence the artists in these areas: Craft, Commerce, and the Environment. These three essays eventually took the form of three artist’s books, hand bound and accompanied by the visual information that I gathered during my trip: photographs, pamphlets, et cetera. All three books are supplemented by the same introduction and although they can be read separately, much of the information is interwoven and they are intended to be read as a whole. Included in this archival documentation are my introduction, each essay, my presentation power point and script, and the covers of the three books.Lucchesi, Joseph E.2003-05Likas, Leonard PaulArtMixed media abstract art Nature, and by nature I mean to include man, is the subject of my painting. Landscape painting is the visual forum where I attempt to come to terms with the nature of all existence, most importantly my own. I seek to elicit powerful, primitive emotions from the viewer such as awe, tragedy, and ecstasy - emotions that arise from the depths when one stands in the mysterious and potentially threatening grandeur of nature. I define this experience as the sublime. My artwork is a reaction against the prevailing values of American society. I feel the sublime experience is the antithesis of modernity and technology, which seeks to assert mankind's dominance over nature. I would argue that nature can never be controlled or replaced. I believe that sublime experience is the understanding of the fragile, impermanent space we occupy as part of nature, through which we come to understand our relationship with the world. By choosing to evoke the sublime through the liberating, creative act of making art, I seek to enter a protest against modernity and offer an important artistic contribution to this ongoing dialogue. I choose to create monumental artworks with varied media to distill my own experience of nature. The media consist of sand, dirt, leaves, twigs, wax, and splattered paint - reflecting my interest in the material presence and metaphorical content that can arise from it. The spontaneity of the action painting allows my emotion to become a tangible presence in the work. In addition, I often burn or scar the surfaces of the paintings, which reflects my notion of the art making process as being comprised of both creative and destructive acts. Great things can happen in an open-ended art making process. Unexpected associations are discovered, new visions developed, and revelations experienced. To be sure, great things can also come of planning and systematic execution. I feel that the different approaches to art making are all viable and should be wholly embraced.Scheer, Lisa N.2000-05Hernly, Kenna DeirdreArt HistoryEarth : art in the natural environment[no abstract]Brown, Rebecca M.2003-05Ferrer, Montserrat IsabelArtSt. Mary's projectWater and oil mixing on the street, the gritty sludge that now seeps into the white snow, a chalk drawing on the pavement; these are all nothing, but when noticed become something. I make art based on the little moments in my environment ranging from small sounds, changes in light, reflections and other sensual encounters. The long winter has inspired me to create a series of paintings based on the physical sensations and visual events that I experience daily. The paintings focus on the optical effects achieved when light and dark pigments are married together on a field of a single color. These works carry a specific mood in comparison to pieces I have done in other seasons; a mood darkened and dulled by the elements, but brought to life with small moments of light. Each one of my paintings is an exploration of texture and tools, as I vary using toothpicks, knives, syringes and sticks to splatter, pull, puddle and drag my paint across the surface. It is a meditative process, one that is all about the paint, my hands, my tools and the surfaces onto which I embed my images. I see beauty in working on a process where a painting is born from a single gesture or moment that can’t be repeated. My marks become maps, water, paths and veins; all traces of what I experience throughout the day. My pigments take flight, jumping, leaping from the canvas only to rest in puddles of muddled grays and pools of mauves and blues. Paint streams across my canvas, staining it with streaks of color, fighting for small odds in the dark. Winter’s sullen mood is now dashed with light, harsh and unforgiving on my naked eyes. Silence has been interrupted. [artist statement]Patterson, Carrie C.2010-05Akbarova, Anzhela M.ArtArt as a reflection on nature : a process of self-discoveryLee Krasner believes that nature is within the creator. She produces her paintings by relying on her impulses and unconscious desires of creation. The focus and meaning is not behind the final product of the work, but on the process of making the art. Following her example, I want to express myself through my artwork in response to my experience within the landscape. Nature is all around us; however, artists should not forget that nature is inside us; art is inside us. It is through our hand and mind that we can recreate the art of nature. Through the process of creating, I develop an experience; I reflect on landscape and express myself through brushstroke and color. Nature, art, and psychology are sources for my work. Nature is an object outside of me that I connect with and draw inspiration from. Art is the process of making that reflects on my experience within the landscape. Psychology has influenced my art process because, from a psychological perspective, art is an experience and a tool for self-expression. I want my work to reflect on my experience within the landscape and focus on my expressive process of mark making. My procedure of creating artwork focuses on letting the unconscious govern the path towards reflecting on nature through an artistic medium. As an artist, I do not want to recreate the environment I am in, but instead present the spiritual experience that the environment creates for me. I respond towards the fleeting moments within nature, such as the motion of the clouds and the water, and the changing light and color in the sky and its reflection on the water. My strokes are quick and meditative and express my emotional reaction towards my experience in nature. The artists Vincent Van Gogh, Piet Mondrian, Jackson Pollock, and Lee Krasner use art as a tool for expression and discovery. Van Gogh uses nature as inspiration for creation and expresses himself through varied stroke and vibrant color. Mondrian begins with an interest in nature, but then develops a system for an ideal abstract form by representing landscape geometrically. Pollock’s psychoanalytic works reveal the relationship between his emotional state and mark making. Krasner discusses her art as an autobiography and combines her unconscious marks with her experience. These artists’ works and theories have helped me develop my own artwork. My mark has a meditative quality but it is not predetermined; it functions as a discovery process and focuses on the inner experience between myself and my environment. My artwork is an experience and allows me to express my connection to landscape. I want the viewer to realize that art is not limited to the painting, but it exists within the natural environment and the self. [artist statement]Johnson, Susan R.2008-05Yancone, Allison NicoleArtSt. Mary's projectMy art making is an extensive process that is saturated in time and ritual. While it is easy to assume that my work is about oysters, it is actually about ideas of place and nature, specifically St. Mary's. My connection to the landscape has led me to consider how I develop a personal relationship with nature—moments of time and place—through collection. Collecting is a habit I find to be a natural human reaction. We as humans have an internal ache to understand objects and connect to the tangible. In many ways I believe that is a foundation for making art; to make emotions, relationships, thoughts and concepts concrete. That sense of concreteness is important in my own work; it allows me to make apparent how I am connecting to the world and understanding my own relationship with St. Mary's. People and places are both impressionable; not only have I left indentations upon the shoreline of the river here, but the shoreline has indented upon me. To remember this importance, I collect oyster shells. At other important places I have visited in my lifetime, I have also collected—rocks, coral, shells, leaves—all have found their way from their natural, original location and accumulated in my hands, pockets, and shelves. [from art smp archive website]Caldwell, Colby2011-05Holloway, Cristy LynnArtLandscape paintingSince studying art on the college level, I have been introduced to numerous artists, cultures and ideas. I believe that every piece of art that I have viewed has effected me as an artist in some manner, however, I feel that certain artist and art movements have had direct influence on the imaginative landscapes that I produce. I have studied the intentions of the Romantic artists and the emotional exploration and depiction of feelings contained within their work. I have also studied classical artists such as Claude Lorraine and the academic composition and perspective that is used to create illusionistic space. There are other art movements and individual artists that have been influential in applying concepts of space in my landscape paintings. The Chinese and Hudson River Artists produce interesting spaces such as focal points and fore-ground areas that I have studied and applied similar ideas to my work in the attempt to improve as an artist. My intention as an artist is to combine my knowledge of the history of landscape painting with my own skills in order to create emotionally expressive landscapes. In displaying my work of western-American landscapes, I wish to offer a journey to the viewer of an aesthetically pleasing depiction of my own experiences and fantasies. These landscapes are based on my dreams and visions which contain emotional responses to life.Johnson, Susan R.1999-05Smigel, AbigailArtSt. Mary's projectMy [SMP] is in the discipline of Art and focuses in Underwater Photography. My body of work entails photographs of women and their movement in the underwater environment. The printed photographs are quite small, for the purpose of an intimate interaction with the viewer. The women in each of the photographs remain anonymous so that the viewer can associate with the figure more freely. I photograph in calm water, and position my models in ways that are natural in the water, to achieve a response of comfort and pleasantry from the viewer. My motivations behind this project lie in my enjoyment of the water environment. I have been a member of swim teams since the age of six, and have always found relaxation when swimming. I have desired to express this enjoyment in some creative form, and I have found that the medium of underwater photography provides me with an outlet for that artistic expression. I have utilized photography for over nine years and have been influenced by many other photographers and their use of the reflection of light on human figures. Man Ray and his use of the anonymous female figure in his photographs has motivated me to disguise the models in my photographs. The nostalgic images and methods of printing that Sally Mann uses in her photographs have influenced the dreamlike quality in my images as well. I find that the use of underwater photography has provided me with a creative outlet and medium to better express my enjoyment of the underwater environment.Johnson, Susan R.1998-05Sullivan, Meghan AnneEnglishLost and found in the night skyMy [SMP] consists of a collection of creative nonfiction pieces about astronomy. The pieces focus on astronomical phenomena, blending scientific facts and explanations with literature, theology, mythology, sociology, and history. Main themes occurring throughout the collection include faith vs. reason, travel, curiosity, the imagination, the mysterious, the unknown, and the magical. Besides educating readers, the main purpose of my SMP is to open minds to the possibility of blending the sciences with the arts and humanities.Hammond, Jeffrey A.2008-05Bogel, Kenneth JohnBiologyInvestigation into the effects of atrazine on the gonadal differentiation of the mangrove rivulus (Rivulus marmoratus), a self-fertilizing, simultaneous hermaphroditeIn teleost fish, sexual differentiation can be directed genetically, environmentally or behaviorally. Four main types of life history are followed in teleosts; gonochorism, protandrous hermaphroditism, protogynous hermaphroditism, and simultaneous hermaphroditism. In all life history types, besides simultaneous hermaphrodites, androgens are important in differentiation of testicular tissue and estrogens (and the enzyme aromatase which produces estrogens from androgens) are important in the differentiation of ovarian tissue. In simultaneous hermaphrodites the role of sex steroids in differentiation and maintenance of gonadal tissue is unknown. Endocrine disrupting contaminants (EDCs) can influence the actions of steroid hormones and modify gonadal differentiation and normal reproductive functioning. Atrazine, the most widely used herbicide in the world, increases aromatase activity in human cell lines and also disrupts normal gonadal differentiation (at very low concentrations) in two species of frog. This study looks at the effects of similar concentrations of atrazine on the gonadal differentiation in the simultaneous hermaphrodite, Rivulus marmoratus. Atrazine had no significant on any effect on gonadal differentiation in R. marmoratus. The lack of an effect of atrazine could be due to a variety of factors: improper dosage, improper timing, a decreased sensitivity in simultaneous hermaphrodites to changes in sex steroid levels, and a different role of aromatase in gonadal differentiation of simultaneous hermaphrodites. Future studies need to be done to determine the effects of sex steroids on the gonadal differentiation of simultaneous hermaphrodites. Also, more research needs to be focused on the effects of low, environmentally relevant concentrations of man-made chemicals.Orlando, Edward F.2003-05Prasher, Emma ClaireBiologyComparison of isolated soil bacteria and nematode intestinal bacteria from an organic farmTo make a comparison between bacteria found in the soil and bacteria isolated from the intestines of nematodes, soil samples were taken from three different fields at EvenStar Organic Farm: a currently planted field, a 2 year fallow field, and a 12 year fallow field. Bacteria were isolated directly from the soil samples as well as from the intestines of nematode. From an initial 193 isolates, 69 were gram stained and subjected to the Biolog microbial identification system. 13 isolates were successfully identified at the genus and species level and 2 isolates were identified to the genus. Identified isolates were Aeromonas eucrenophila DNA group 6, Cardiobacterium hominis, Pediococcus acidilactici/parvulus, four Pseudomonas maculicola, two Staphylococcus xylosus, and three Tsukamurella inchonensis. Further characterization is needed to identify the remaining isolates before a comparison can be made.Elliott, Samantha L.2009-05Nugent, Kenneth RyanBiologyIdentification of unknown bacterial soil isolates from a two year fallow organic farm fieldThe goal of this study was to identify a subset of bacteria isolated from a two year fallow field at Even Star Organic Farm. Emma Prasher isolated the set of bacteria in order to study correlations between bacteria in the soil and bacteria present in the intestines of soil nematodes. After culturing the bacteria from their frozen state, 51 isolates were classified according to gram staining, oxidase test, and spore staining. Of these isolates, 14 were chosen to be identified using the Biolog identification system. Seven isolates were identified at the genus and species level, and one isolate was identified only at the genus level. The identified isolates were two cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens biotype G, two cultures of Enterobacter aerogenes, two cultures of Pseudomonas putida biotype A, and one culture of Microbacterium testaceum. Using data from this study, further analysis of bacteria involvement in soil hierarchy can occur.Byrd, Jeffrey J.2010-05Johnson, Scott ByronBiologyDisturbance and its Effect on Avian Populations on New Providence Island, BahamasNatural disturbances, such as hurricanes, and human disturbances, such as bulldozing forest habitats, can have different effects on wildlife and ecosystems. In my study, I hypothesized that human disturbance has had greater effects on the bird populations of New Providence Island, Bahamas than have hurricanes. I used Christmas Bird Count data for New Providence from 1995-2010 to determine if there were significant changes in bird populations during these years, and I used information from land development agencies and data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to investigate changes in land development and storm frequency. My results revealed that of the 180 species investigated, 26 species have had significant population change during the 15 years of study. Of these 26 species, the population sizes of 13 species increased (eight residents and five migrants), 10 species decreased (eight residents and two migrants) and three species were extirpated (two residents and one unknown). My analysis also found that there was no significant effect of storms on bird population sizes, suggesting that human activity was the main reason for their change in population numbers. My data also revealed that most of the birds that showed an increase in population size (61.5%) were resident, non-migratory birds adapted to urban areas whereas most of the birds that decreased in population size (80%) were resident birds that preferred natural and early successional habitats. This indicates that human disturbance and urbanization on New Providence may be selecting for species more adapted to human dominated areas.Price, J. Jordan2012-12Thompson, Elizabeth MarieBiologyBallast water regulation : a critique of the National Invasive Species Act of 1996In this paper I hope to thoroughly explain the National Invasive Species Act and to support the idea that while laws regarding the control of invasive species in our waterways exist they are difficult to enforce and do not provide any incentive for further innovation and are therefore rendered ineffective. I also hope to show that there are other alternatives available that would better address the problems than the current accepted practices in Ballast water management (BWM). [from introduction]Paul, Robert W.2006-05Crawford, Kelly ElaineBiologyBanding patterns in eastern oystersSclerochronology is the study of growth patterns in the skeletons of invertebrates (Hudson, et al. 1976). Growth patterns in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica can best be identified by the patterns in band deposition. When the oyster clamps its shell together the concentration of hydrogen increases, stripping the calcium carbonate from the shell, creating a band. Oysters shut down during stressful situations such as during a storm event. Storms cause oysters to shut, which creates a band so the storms that an oyster has experienced will be recorded in the shell. In this experiment oysters were taken from the St. Mary’s River, a tributary of the Lower Potomac, and analyzed for growth and band number. Growth and band number was related to the amount of precipitation, the days of precipitation, severity of the event, seasonality, and the duration of storm event. This study showed that patterns of growth were indeterminate from precipitation data, however the number of bands per year showed a direct negative correlation (p<0.01) with the amount of precipitation.Paul, Robert W.2001-05Boyle, Melissa ElizabethBiologyStatus of the barn owl (Tyto alba) population in St. Mary’s County, MarylandThe Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is a relatively uncommon and highly nocturnal member of the Maryland avifauna. Although relatively few Barn Owl studies have been conducted in Maryland, it is suspected that populations are declining, possibly due to loss or fragmentation of nesting and feeding habitats. Because some Barn Owl populations across the country have decreased significantly, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has listed them as a species of management concern. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the current status of the Barn Owl population in St. Mary’s County, Maryland. I first sought information about Barn Owls from the public through newspaper articles and personal contacts. I then surveyed duck blinds and barns, common nesting and roosting sites for this species, to determine whether Barn Owls were present in the county. I erected 16 Barn Owl nest boxes throughout the county in an effort to attract and detect any owls that may be present. These boxes were monitored over a six month period and at this time there has been no detectable Barn Owl nesting activity in the boxes. This initial data suggests that the Barn Owl population of St. Mary’s County has declined over the past 25 years. These Barn Owl nest boxes should continue to be monitored in the future, to more accurately determine the status of the Barn Owl population in Southern Maryland. In addition to extended monitoring, this nest box program should be expanded to include all parts of St. Mary’s County, especially the northern section. A more intensive education program could also be implemented to better inform residents about the status of the Barn Owl population.Willoughby, Ernest J.1999-05Bove, Andrew PhilipAnthropologyBean tobacco barn at historic St. Mary's CityTobacco barns are a unique and very important element of the physical and cultural landscapes in St. Mary’s County, Maryland. Using the symbolic interactionist theoretical perspective one can determine that tobacco barns represent different things to those who worked around them and those who have never had a part in tobacco production. Farmers see the barns as a testament to their culture and a way of life"
