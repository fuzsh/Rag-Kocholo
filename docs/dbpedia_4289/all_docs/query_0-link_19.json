ant subfamily Ponerinae (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is revised to reflect recent molecular phylogenetic information and a reappraisal of ponerine morphological diversity. The monogeneric tribe Thaumatomyrmecini (Thaumatomyrmex) is newly synonymized under Ponerini (syn. nov.), and the diverse genus Pachycondyla is fragmented into 19 genera, largely along the lines of its junior synonyms: Bothroponera, Brachyponera (gen. rev.), Ectomomyrmex (gen. rev.), Euponera (gen. rev.), Hagensia (gen. rev.), Megaponera (gen. rev.), Mesoponera (gen. rev.), Neoponera (gen. rev.), Ophthalmopone (gen. rev.), Pachycondyla, Paltothyreus (gen. rev.), Pseudoneoponera (gen. rev.), Pseudoponera (gen. rev.), and 6 new genera: Austroponera (gen. nov.), Buniapone (gen. nov.), Fisheropone (gen. nov.), Mayaponera (gen. nov.), Parvaponera (gen. nov.) and Rasopone (gen. nov.). Some junior synonyms of Pachycondyla are transferred to junior synonym status under other genera: Wadeura as a junior synonym of Cryptopone (syn. nov.), and both Termitopone and Syntermitopone as junior synonyms of Neoponera (syn. nov.). A new genus, Iroponera (gen. nov.), based on the new species Iroponera odax (sp. nov.), is described from Australia. Molecular and morphological justifications for these taxonomic changes are given alongside discussions of phylogenetic relationships. Keys to the world genera of Ponerinae are provided, and morphological diagnoses and species lists are given for each genus. Finally, the available information on ponerine ecology and behavior is reviewed and synthesized. Key words: World revision, ants, taxonomy, Ponerinae\n\nIntroduction The higher taxonomic classification of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) has recently undergone significant changes. Driven by careful reconsiderations of morphological variation (Bolton, 2003; Keller, 2011) and broad molecular phylogenetic studies (Moreau et al., 2006; Brady et al., 2006; Rabeling et al., 2008), the subfamily-level classification of Formicidae is now largely stable and reflective of evolutionary relationships. At the same time, molecular data have demonstrated that tribal and generic classifications remain phylogenetically inconsistent for many ant groups, especially the diverse subfamilies Formicinae, Myrmicinae (Brady et al., 2006) and Ponerinae. These latter groups, along with Dolichoderinae, constitute the “big four” subfamilies of ants in terms of described species diversity. Formicinae, Myrmicinae and Dolichoderinae include the most familiar ants, and together with several smaller subfamilies constitute the formicoid clade (Moreau et al., 2006; Brady et al., 2006). Ponerinae is unique among the major ant subfamilies in being situated outside this clade, and is the focus of this study. Ponerines are notable for combining generally simple social organization with a high diversity of derived morphological, ecological and behavioral traits. They provide valuable opportunities to examine the incipient evolution of traits considered critical to the success of other major ant lineages such as Myrmicinae and Formicinae. For example, group foraging is characteristic of these latter subfamilies and is probably ancestral within them, but it has apparently evolved repeatedly within Ponerinae. The newly inferred molecular phylogeny of Ponerinae (Figs 1, 2; Schmidt, 2013) provides an historical framework for studying the evolution of group foraging, among many other traits. Because taxonomic classification is expected to reflect phylogeny, a phylogenetically informed ponerine classification system is critical to the success of such studies. The molecular phylogeny of Ponerinae demonstrates the phylogenetic inconsistency of the current tribal and generic classification of the subfamily. Ponerinae has not received a comprehensive taxonomic revision in nearly a century, since Emery’s (1911) Genera Insectorum, though several individual genera have been revised (e.g., Bolton, 1974, 1975b; Brown, 1976, 1978; Bolton & Fisher, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, 2011). Since Emery’s revision, many additional ponerine taxa have been discovered and some radical and poorly justified taxonomic changes have been made within the subfamily.\n\n4 · Zootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press\n\nSCHMIDT & SHATTUCK\n\nFor example, the genus Pachycondyla has recently been recognized as a highly paraphyletic assemblage with no justification for the species placed there (Keller, 2011; Mariano et al., 2011; Schmidt, 2013). The goal of the present study is to revise the tribe- and genus-level classification of Ponerinae to reflect its internal phylogeny. While several areas of uncertainty remain, and some genera recognized here will likely prove to be nonmonophyletic in future studies, the new classification provides a foundation for future phylogenetic and taxonomic refinements.\n\nMaterial and methods The taxonomic changes made in this revision are based on a combination of molecular and morphological evidence. Schmidt's (2013) molecular phylogeny of Ponerinae served as the framework upon which taxonomic changes were based. A consideration of morphological characters was used to assess the plausibility of the molecular phylogeny, to define tribal and generic boundaries, to assign species to genera, and to develop hypotheses about the phylogenetic positions of those genera that were not included in the phylogeny. The guiding principles for taxonomic changes were as follows: 1. Ponerine classification should reflect evolutionary relationships, so demonstrably non-monophyletic groups should not be recognized. 2. Genus-group and higher taxonomic ranks are arbitrary, so their most valuable roles are in facilitating identification. Genera were therefore defined mainly by morphological distinctiveness, rather than strict observance of an arbitrary age cutoff (in practice there was relatively little conflict between these two criteria, with Dinoponera being the most notable exception). 3. Taxonomic changes should be conservative in order to minimize unnecessary disruptions to the end users of ponerine taxonomy. Generally, changes were made only if they were supported by both molecular and morphological data, with minor exceptions. Adherence to these principles resulted in a conservative set of taxonomic changes within Ponerinae. The revised classification incorporates one tribal synonymization (Thaumatomyrmecini as a junior synonym of Ponerini), the division of Pachycondyla into 19 genera (six of them new), several new synonymizations of former Pachycondyla synonyms and the description of one entirely new genus. In addition, the genera within Ponerini are arranged into six informal genus groups, which are analogous to subtribes but not formally defined as such. Justifications for particular changes are given under the relevant tribe or genus descriptions. Not all ponerine species were examined to assess their generic placement. Most ponerine genera are taxonomically stable and have clear diagnostic characters and uncontroversial species compositions. For these genera, representative sets of species were examined to provide information on the morphological variation within each genus, supplemented with a review of the original descriptions for the other species and any recent revisionary work. The species of the former genus Pachycondyla were given special attention in order to determine their generic placements. In most cases this was straightforward, as the boundaries of the separate “Pachycondyla” lineages largely corresponded to the former genera synonymized under Pachycondyla. Particular areas of uncertainty in species placement remain in the genera Bothroponera, Cryptopone and Mesoponera (see their individual descriptions for details). Adjustments to this taxonomic framework will undoubtedly become necessary in the future as additional molecular and morphological data are obtained. Likely changes that we foresee but do not feel comfortable making at this time include the following: 1. Removal of the African (and potentially other) species currently placed in Cryptopone to separate genera. 2. The division of Mesoponera into smaller, monophyletic genera. 3. Synonymization of Anochetus under Odontomachus, should either prove to be non-monophyletic.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PONERINAE\n\nZootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press ·\n\n5\n\nFIGURE 1.

We examined specimens of ponerine taxa in several museum and personal collections, in addition to specimens obtained through our own collection efforts and through personal loans and gifts from many generous researchers. Collection codes are as follows: ALWC ANIC BMNH CASC CSC JWC MCZC PSWC UAIC USNM\n\nAlex L. Wild personal collection, Urbana, Illinois, USA. Australian National Insect Collection, Canberra, Australia. The Natural History Museum, London, UK. California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, California, USA. Chris A. Schmidt personal collection, Tucson, Arizona, USA. Jeannette Wheeler Collection, Tucson, Arizona, USA. Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Phil S. Ward personal collection, Davis, California, USA. University of Arizona Entomology collection, Tucson, Arizona, USA. Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C., USA.\n\nDistribution data. Distribution information for each genus is reported by political units and biogeographic region. These data are derived primarily from material examined during this study supplemented with records from the published literature and www.antweb.org. The maps are based on those prepared by B. Guenard and M.D. Weiser (Guenard et al., 2010) and updated by www.antwiki.org, together with data collected during this study. Regions shown as “present” are those with known occurrence records, “likely present” indicates a high probability of presence but no actual specimens are known, “uncertain” flags regions where a taxon may be present but is likely rare and has yet to be collected there and “present as exotic” are regions with known established but introduced populations.\n\nPonerine ecology and behavior: A brief review Most ponerines retain a suite of social and ecological traits that are probably ancestral within Formicidae, and as a result have often been considered “primitive” relative to most other ants (Hölldobler & Wilson, 1990; Wilson & Hölldobler, 2004). This characterization is only partially accurate, however, as ponerines in fact display a remarkable diversity of derived morphological, ecological and behavioral traits. This diversity is detailed in the individual genus accounts but is briefly reviewed below, with an emphasis on ponerine social, reproductive and foraging behaviors. Based on a review of the diversity within Ponerinae, it is possible to characterize the “typical” ponerine species. Note that the following description is not necessarily a hypothesis about ancestral conditions, but is rather a composite sketch of the most common features among members of the subfamily. Probably very few ponerine taxa entirely fit the following description, but it serves as a useful starting point to discuss the behavioral diversity within the group: Colonies of the typical ponerine contain a few dozen to a few hundred adult workers and a single dealate queen. Nesting occurs in preformed cavities in soil, leaf litter or decaying wood. Workers are monomorphic. The queen is morphologically similar to the workers except for its larger eyes, ocelli, modified thoracic flight sclerites, and enlarged gaster. Workers retain ovaries and spermathecae and may lay haploid eggs, but do not mate. Colony reproduction occurs through independent semiclaustral colony foundation by single mated queens. Colony emigration occurs via social carrying and through the use of weak chemical orientation cues. Division of labor among the workers follows a typical pattern of age polyethism, with younger workers performing nest duties and older workers foraging. The workers, which are fairly large (roughly 8 mm long) and have moderately large eyes, hunt individually on the ground and in leaf litter for a wide variety of arthropods. They also scavenge opportunistically. Nestmates are not recruited to food sources. Prey is stung and hence paralyzed before its retrieval to the nest, where it is fed directly to the mandibulate larvae. Trophallaxis does not occur between adults or between adults and larvae. Pupae are enclosed in cocoons.\n\n8 · Zootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press\n\nSCHMIDT & SHATTUCK\n\nSocial organization and mating systems The colony sizes of most ponerine species (and many genera) are unknown, but most taxa seem to have relatively small mature colonies, usually with between a few dozen and a few hundred workers. This is the case, for example, in Anochetus (Brown, 1976), Centromyrmex (e.g., Lévieux, 1976; Déjean & Fénéron, 1999), Diacamma (e.g., André et al., 2001), Dinoponera (e.g., Monnin & Peeters, 2008), Harpegnathos (e.g., Peeters et al., 2000), Hagensia (Duncan & Crewe, 1994a), Platythyrea (e.g., Villet et al., 1990b), Plectroctena (e.g., Bolton et al., 1979), Streblognathus (Ware et al., 1990; Peeters, 1993), and most Hypoponera (e.g., Yamauchi et al., 1996), Leptogenys, Myopias (e.g., Gobin et al., 2006), Neoponera (e.g., Gobin et al., 2003a; D’Ettorre et al., 2006; Longino, 2013) and Odontomachus (Brown, 1976). Larger colonies of over a thousand workers are known in some species of Brachyponera (Haskins & Haskins, 1950; Déjean & Lachaud, 1994), Leptogenys, Megaponera (Hölldobler et al., 1994), Neoponera (Leal & Oliveira, 1995), Odontomachus (Colombel, 1970a), Paltothyreus (Braun et al., 1994), and Simopelta (Gotwald & Brown, 1967). Very large colonies of 10,000 or more workers are known in some Leptogenys (up to 50,000 workers in certain members of the L. processionalis group), Neoponera (N. luteola: Yu & Davidson, 1997), and Odontomachus (O. opaciventris: de la Mora et al., 2007). At the other end of the spectrum, very small mature colonies with 20 or fewer workers are typical for Pseudoneoponera (e.g., Sommer et al., 1994), and exceptionally small colonies of about five workers on average have been reported for some Thaumatomyrmex (Jahyny et al., 2002). The ecological and social factors responsible for this diversity in colony sizes are unknown and undoubtedly numerous and varied, but large colonies tend to be correlated with obligate collective foraging behavior and small colonies are often correlated with a reproductive system dominated by gamergate workers (see below). Monomorphic workers are nearly universal in the subfamily, but polymorphic workers occur in several groups, including Brachyponera sennaarensis (Déjean & Lachaud, 1994), the Centromyrmex bequaerti species group (Déjean & Fénéron, 1996, 1999), Megaponera (Crewe & Villet, 1984), and some Neoponera (N. laevigata and N. marginata; Wheeler, 1936, Longino, 2013). The phylogenetic distribution of these taxa (Schmidt, 2013) suggests that worker polymorphism has probably evolved at least five times independently in Ponerinae. In most cases it is correlated with group foraging behavior (Centromyrmex, Megaponera and Neoponera), while polymorphism in B. sennaarensis may be related to its granivorous habits. Similarly, most ponerines show relatively little morphological differentiation between the worker and queen castes, other than the characters normally associated with reproduction and dispersal (including wings and larger eyes). In one sense, this similarity is taken to an extreme in those taxa without a distinct queen caste (see below). A common trend in ponerine evolution is the supplementation or replacement of winged queens with wingless ergatoid queens. Ergatoid queens are often morphologically extremely similar to the worker caste, as is the case in most Leptogenys, whose ergatoid queens differ only very subtly from conspecific workers (Bolton, 1975a). Among ponerine taxa with fully winged queens, worker-queen dimorphism is at its minimum in Harpegnathos, as workers and queens basically differ only in the occurrence of wings and associated modifications of the thoracic sclerites (queens are also very slightly larger; Peeters et al., 2000). Harpegnathos workers even have ocelli, which are otherwise virtually unknown in ponerine workers (also observed only in some populations of Paltothyreus tarsatus: CAS, pers. obs. and B. Bolton, pers. comm.). Large worker-queen size dimorphism has evolved in only a handful of ponerine taxa, including some Brachyponera (B. sennaarensis and B. luteipes; Wheeler, 1933b; Déjean & Lachaud, 1994) and the Centromyrmex bequaerti group (Déjean & Fénéron, 1996, 1999). In addition, queens of Simopelta are dichthadiigyne and differ greatly from the workers (e.g., Gotwald & Brown, 1967). Ponerines have evolved a remarkable diversity of reproductive strategies. While most retain the basic (and probably ancestral) pattern in which reproduction is performed by a single dealate queen, many other taxa have modified this strategy in various ways. Two of the most common variations are reproduction by ergatoid queens and gamergate workers. Ergatoids may occur alongside alate queens (e.g., Mayaponera, some Anochetus, Hypoponera, and Myopias; Brown, 1978, Foitzik et al., 2002; Gobin et al., 2006; Longino, 2013) or may replace them (e.g., Megaponera, some Anochetus, Odontomachus, Plectroctena, most Leptogenys, and possibly Dolioponera; Arnold, 1915; Bolton, 1974, 1975a; Fisher, 2006; Gobin et al., 2006; Molet et al., 2007). In addition to the frequent evolution of ergatoid queens in Ponerinae, reproduction by mated gamergate workers has arisen numerous times in the subfamily. Gamergates are rare among the other ant subfamilies but have evolved perhaps as many as nine times or more in Ponerinae (Schmidt, 2013). Like ergatoids, gamergates may\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PONERINAE\n\nZootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press ·\n\n9\n\noccur alongside distinct queens (e.g., Harpegnathos and some Platythyrea and Pseudoneoponera; Villet, 1993; Ito, 1995; Peeters & Hölldobler, 1995) or may entirely replace them (e.g., Bothroponera kruegeri, Diacamma, Dinoponera, Hagensia, Ophthalmopone, Streblognathus, some Leptogenys, Platythyrea and Pseudoneoponera; Peeters & Crewe, 1986b; Peeters & Higashi, 1989; Peeters, 1987, 1991a, 1993; Villet et al., 1990b; Villet, 1991b, 1991c; Sledge et al., 2001; Jahyny et al., 2002; Monnin et al., 2003; Gobin et al., 2008; Monnin & Peeters, 2008). Colonies with gamergates are commonly polygynous (e.g., Ophthalmopone and some Pseudoneoponera), though in many taxa a dominance hierarchy may exist in which only a single dominant gamergate performs reproduction for the colony (e.g., Bothroponera kruegeri, Diacamma, Dinoponera, Hagensia, Streblognathus, and some Pseudoneoponera). Both ergatoids and gamergates are correlated with reduced dispersal abilities when they act as the sole reproductives in a colony, but they represent distinct evolutionary pathways and have never been found together in the same species (Molet & Peeters, 2006). Ergatoids and gamergates necessitate a form of colony reproduction characterized by budding, in which new ergatoids or gamergates leave their natal nest (either before or after mating), usually with an entourage of workers, and found new colonies a short distance away. While it is tempting to conjecture that these reduced dispersal capabilities may help drive speciation due to increased genetic isolation, most genera with ergatoids or gamergates are relatively species-poor (e.g., Dinoponera, Hagensia, Harpegnathos, Megaponera, Ophthalmopone and Streblognathus), with Leptogenys being a major exception.\n\nForaging behavior Ponerine evolution has been marked by a rich diversification in foraging behaviors. Most of this diversity involves variation in foraging location, prey specialization, method of prey capture, and degree of cooperation among foraging nestmates. We consider these topics separately below. Ponerines can be broadly categorized as being either cryptobiotic or epigeic foragers depending on the microhabitats where they forage, though many taxa are intermediate between these extremes. Epigeic foraging occurs on the surface of the ground or on low vegetation, and is typical of many ponerines. Rarely, foraging occurs arboreally (e.g., most Platythyrea, many Neoponera, and a small number of taxa in a few other genera). Epigeic ponerines tend to be relatively large and to have well developed eyes. Cryptobiotic foraging occurs in soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or other concealed microhabitats, and is also common among ponerines. Cryptobiotic taxa variously show several morphological traits that are correlated with life in tight and dark conditions. For example, cryptobiotic ponerines are typically small bodied, which is taken to an extreme in many Cryptopone, Dolioponera, Hypoponera, and Ponera. The compound eyes are typically greatly reduced in size or even entirely absent (including Boloponera, Centromyrmex, Dolioponera, Feroponera, Promyopias, and some Cryptopone and Hypoponera). Most cryptobiotic ponerines have at least mildly clubbed antennae, perhaps facilitating movement and prey detection in low light conditions. The legs are often short and stocky, and are sometimes armed with stout setae to increase traction in soil or wood (these are present in Centromyrmex, Feroponera, Promyopias, and most Cryptopone). As with the eyes, some other morphological characters show various degrees of reduction, including pigmentation, the number of labial and maxillary palp segments, and the number of tibial spurs. Most cryptobiotic ponerines have only a single metatibial spur, reflecting a loss from the likely ancestral condition of two spurs. This character has often been considered to divide Ponerinae into two groups (discussed by Brown, 1963), but molecular phylogenetic results (Schmidt, 2013) suggest that the loss of a metatibial spur has occurred several times independently during the course of ponerine evolution, with cryptobiotic taxa probably evolving from epigeic ancestors multiple times. Prey specialization probably drove much of the morphological and behavioral diversification within Ponerinae. While many ponerines are generalist predators and scavengers, a large number have specialized to various degrees on specific types of prey. Many taxa are more or less specialist predators of termites (e.g., Centromyrmex, Megaponera, Ophthalmopone, Paltothyreus, some Leptogenys and Neoponera, and scattered species in other genera). Other taxa are specialist predators of earthworms (Psalidomyrmex), isopods (most Leptogenys), millipedes (Plectroctena, Thaumatomyrmex, and some Myopias), or other ants (Simopelta and some Myopias). Prey specialization in these taxa is often correlated with highly specialized mandibular structure (e.g., in Leptogenys, Plectroctena, and Thaumatomyrmex). From this observation it is possible to predict that several other\n\n10 · Zootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press\n\nSCHMIDT & SHATTUCK\n\ngenera, whose prey preferences are unknown, are probably specialist predators. For example, Belonopelta, Dolioponera, Emeryopone, and Promyopias all have highly modified mandibles that are probably adapted to the capture of specific prey types, but the identities of their prey are unknown. Most ponerines capture their prey by standard means, using their antennae to locate prey, their more or less unspecialized mandibles to seize it, and finally one to several stings to rapidly subdue and paralyze it. A few ponerine taxa have evolved more unusual methods of prey capture: Harpegnathos employs its huge eyes to locate its prey, and then uses its jumping capabilities and rapidly closing forceps-like mandibles to capture it. Anochetus and Odontomachus use their extremely fast and forceful trap jaws to skewer, crush or stun their prey, and Plectroctena sometimes uses its snap mandibles to stun its prey. Finally, Thaumatomyrmex uses its pitchfork-like mandibles to grasp polyxenid millipedes, which are covered in noxious hairs, and employs its front tarsi to scrape the hairs off. Ponerines typically forage individually without any nestmate recruitment to food sources, though this basic pattern has been modified by many lineages. In some cases, recruitment is facultative and only employed to large prey sources. In others, recruitment is a standard component of foraging. Such obligately collective foraging occurs in Megaponera, the Neoponera laevigata species group, Simopelta, and some Leptogenys (L. diminuta and relatives, as well as the L. processionalis species group). Some members of the L. processionalis species group conduct swarm raids, as in many of the true army ants of the doryline section (Brady, 2003). Simopelta has converged most extensively with a true army ant lifestyle, as it conducts mass raids on other ants, is nomadic, and has dichthadiigyne queens with pulsed reproduction. Recruitment in ponerine taxa may occur either via tandem running or chemical trails.\n\nMorphological characters The traditional lack of a robust taxonomic framework for ponerines is unsurprising given their apparently rapid rate of morphological change and their frequent convergence, as suggested by the inferred molecular phylogeny of the subfamily (Schmidt, 2013). Below we review some of the morphological characters of ponerine workers and queens that were utilized in this revision. This review is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather to give a sense of the morphological variation in the subfamily and the utility of each character as a diagnostic or phylogenetic tool. We end with a brief mention of some additional characters which were not examined for this study but which would likely prove highly useful in future studies. We generally follow the morphological terms of Bolton (1994, 2003). Body Size and Build. In the genus descriptions that follow, the known range of body sizes is listed for each genus, and is given as the smallest and largest total body lengths (in mm) reported in the literature for the described species of that genus. Given that these lengths were inconsistently reported and were measured by many different authors using different methods, these ranges should be treated as only very rough estimates of the size range for that genus. No effort was made to determine the average body length among members of a genus. Body size varies within a fairly small range in many ponerine genera, but is highly variable in many other genera (e.g., Anochetus, Bothroponera, Centromyrmex, Leptogenys, Myopias, Odontomachus, Platythyrea, and Plectroctena). This high intrageneric variation makes body size a generally poor character for phylogenetic inference and of only limited utility for diagnoses. Still, some phylogenetic trends in body size are apparent in ponerine evolution: three of the six genus groups within Ponerini are predominantly small bodied (the Ponera, Hypoponera and Plectroctena groups), while the other three (the Harpegnathos, Pachycondyla and Odontomachus groups) are predominantly large bodied in comparison. Platythyrea is highly variable in this respect. Small bodied ponerines apparently have arisen from large bodied ancestors many times independently. Most ponerines have a moderately slender build, but some (e.g., Bothroponera, Phrynoponera, and Pseudoneoponera) are more robust, and others (e.g., most Leptogenys) are very slender. Color, Sculpturing and Pilosity. Color, sculpturing and pilosity are highly variable characters within Ponerinae. Color ranges from light yellow-brown in some hypogeic taxa, through various shades of red and brown to black, the latter color typical of most large ponerines. The most common type of sculpturing in ponerines is dense to sparse punctations associated with standing pilosity or pubescence. Some taxa have a more or less smooth and glassy cuticle, with little to no pilosity or pubescence. A few groups (Platythyrea, Belonopelta, and the Leptogenys\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PONERINAE\n\nZootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press ·\n\n11\n\nmaxillosa species group) have evolved pruinose sculpturing, which gives the ants a frosted appearance and is associated with an extremely dense pubescence and usually little to no standing pilosity. Many groups have foveate or foveolate sculpturing (e.g., Harpegnathos, Bothroponera, Phrynoponera, and many members of the Plectroctena group), and still others are at least partially striate (e.g., Diacamma, Ectomomyrmex, Odontoponera, Pachycondyla, Paltothyreus, and Pseudoneoponera). In short, sculpturing is highly variable within Ponerinae and does not appear to be useful as a marker for deeper phylogenetic relationships (this is also true for pilosity and pubescence). On the other hand, pilosity and sculpturing are generally fairly consistent within individual genera, making them useful characters for diagnosis of some genera. For example, shaggy golden or red pilosity and deep longitudinal striations on the dorsum of A3 are characteristic of most species of Pseudoneoponera. Mandibles. The mandibles contain some of the most important diagnostic characters in ponerine taxonomy and provide a wealth of insight into the ecological niches of their carriers, though there are few mandibular characters that have proven useful as synapomorphies linking two ponerine genera (the trap mandibles of Anochetus and Odontomachus are an obvious exception). The ancestral ponerine probably had more or less triangular mandibles with distinct basal and masticatory margins, several small teeth, and a basal groove. This is still the condition in most extant ponerines, but several lineages have evolved unusual mandibular pits or grooves whose functions are unclear (they may have a role in pheromone dispersal; Brown, 1963). Hagensia has perhaps the most striking of these grooves, on the dorsal surface of its mandibles. Plectroctena also has dorsal grooves on its mandibles, though of a different form than in Hagensia. Euponera, Brachyponera, and most Cryptopone have a basal pit near the mandibular insertion. The ancestral basal groove has become lost or nearly lost in many ponerines, is variable even within many genera, and is generally not a useful diagnostic character. A substantial diversity of mandible shapes and dentitions occurs in the subfamily, and these are usually correlated with specialized prey preferences or hunting strategies. Hence we find that the mandibles of many isopod-specialist Leptogenys species are thin and outwardly bowed, enabling them to grasp their hard round prey. Similar adaptations occur in Plectroctena and Myopias, which specialize on millipedes (which are also hard and round). Thaumatomyrmex has evolved long attenuated teeth to enable capture of polyxenid millipedes, which are covered in irritating hairs. Belonopelta and Emeryopone have also evolved attenuated mandibular teeth, though their prey preferences are unclear. The mandibles of Anochetus and Odontomachus are perhaps the most highly derived, as they arise from the midline of the head, are long and straight, and function as trap jaws, snapping shut with tremendous speed and force. The mandibles of Harpegnathos are also unusual, being long, upwardly curved, and serrated, apparently facilitating the capture of fast moving prey. Dolioponera has a unique set of setose teeth on the inner margins of its mandibles; their function is unknown but may indicate a specialized diet. Many other ponerine genera have evolved less extremely derived mandibular shapes, often by reducing the relative length of the masticatory margin (a mandible shape referred to as “subtriangular”). Clypeus and Frontal Lobes. The clypeus is an important source of characters for ponerine systematics. In most ponerines the clypeus is unremarkable, having a nearly straight or gently convex anterior margin, often with a slight emargination medially. In several genera (e.g., Buniapone, Myopias and Paltothyreus) the clypeus bears a blunt median projection, and in others (e.g., some Belonopelta and Emeryopone) there is a short but sharp tooth. Some other genera have evolved two (Dinoponera, Feroponera and Streblognathus) or numerous (Odontoponera) blunt teeth on the anterior clypeal margin. The frontal lobes provide some useful diagnostic characters within Ponerinae, as well as some clear synapomorphies. The relative spacing of the frontal lobes is one of the main morphological distinctions between Platythyrea and Ponerini, with the frontal lobes widely separated in the former genus but closely approximated in nearly all Ponerini (Thaumatomyrmex is the single exception, but its frontal lobes are even more widely spaced than in Platythyrea). Within Ponerini, the frontal lobes show a wide diversity of sizes and shapes. In most large bodied members of Ponerini (e.g., Diacamma, most members of the Pachycondyla group, and many members of the Odontomachus group) the frontal lobes are moderately large, with a relatively large separation at their anterior end (created by a posterior triangular projection of the clypeus) but only a narrow or nonexistent separation posteriorly. This particular frontal lobe structure may be the ancestral condition within Ponerini, given its wide phylogenetic distribution. In many other Ponerini (e.g., most members of the Ponera group, Hypoponera, Mesoponera, Leptogenys, Anochetus, and Odontomachus) the frontal lobes are small and closely approximated for nearly their entire length; this type of frontal lobe is often correlated with small body size. Finally, some taxa have greatly expanded frontal lobes (Bothroponera and most members of the Plectroctena group, taken to an extreme in\n\n12 · Zootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press\n\nSCHMIDT & SHATTUCK\n\nBoloponera and Loboponera). Another character is the shape of the lateral margins of the frontal lobes, which are typically triangular or semicircular. This character is highly variable and rarely useful for diagnoses. Eyes and Ocelli. The size and location of the eyes are important characters in ponerine systematics. Eye size varies substantially among genera. While most ponerines have moderately large eyes, Harpegnathos and Ophthalmopone both have strikingly large eyes, and many ponerines have very small eyes in the worker caste or have lost them altogether. The reduction or loss of eyes is generally correlated with a reduction in body size and the adoption of hypogeic foraging behavior, and is typical of most members of the Ponera group (except Diacamma), Hypoponera, most members of the Plectroctena group, and some members of the Odontomachus group. A complete loss of eyes occurs in some Cryptopone and Hypoponera species, as well as Boloponera, Feroponera, Promyopias, and Centromyrmex. Eye location is generally consistent within genera and even within larger clades, making it a useful diagnostic character. In most large bodied ponerines the eyes are situated at or just anterior of the head midline (though the eyes are posterior to the head midline in Ophthalmopone). Most small bodied ponerines, on the other hand, have the eyes located far anterior on the sides of the head, often practically abutting the mandibular articulations. Harpegnathos is unusual in having its huge eyes situated at the extreme anterior end of the head, while Anochetus and Odontomachus are unusual in having their eyes situated on lateral ocular prominences. An additional character related to the eyes is the presence or absence of preocular carinae, which are present only in Megaponera, Odontoponera and some Neoponera. Finally, ocelli are almost universally absent in ponerine workers (though present in queens), but are present in workers of Harpegnathos and some populations of Paltothyreus. Mesosoma. The thorax and propodeum (which together constitute the mesosoma) have a number of characters that are useful for diagnosis of ponerine genera, and some of these have useful synapomorphies for higher level phylogenetic analysis. The pronotum has rounded or bluntly angular lateral margins in most ponerines, but the margins are sharply ridged in Hagensia, most Neoponera, some Pachycondyla, and some Centromyrmex, and Odontoponera has a single blunt projecting tooth at each anterolateral corner of its pronotum. The mesopleuron is usually undivided in ponerines, but several ponerine groups have the mesopleuron divided by a transverse groove (e.g., Ectomomyrmex, Euponera, many Neoponera and Pachycondyla, many members of the Plectroctena group, and rarely in other genera such as Anochetus and Brachyponera). Though this character is variable within many genera, it is still useful for diagnosis of some genera. A possible synapomorphy of Plectroctena, Loboponera and Boloponera is the apparent fusion of the dorsal section of the mesopleuron to the mesonotum. Dolioponera has a similar fusion, but its mesopleuron is undivided. The metanotal groove is an important character in ponerine systematics. In most ponerines the mesonotum and propodeum are separated by a suture or very shallow groove (the metanotal groove), but a deeply impressed metanotal groove is characteristic of Brachyponera and Mayaponera, as well as some members of several other genera. In contrast, several groups have entirely lost any vestiges of the metanotal groove, and the mesonotum and propodeum form a continuous structure dorsally (e.g., Harpegnathos, Bothroponera, Phrynoponera, Pseudoneoponera, most members of the Plectroctena group, and most Platythyrea). The propodeum has a number of useful characters. The propodeal dorsum varies from being roughly as broad as the mesonotum (especially common in those taxa without a metanotal groove) to being very sharply narrowed (e.g., Brachyponera, Hagensia, and many Mesoponera and Hypoponera), with most taxa having an intermediate condition in which the propodeal dorsum is moderately narrowed and continuously convex in posterior view. An apparent synapomorphy of Austroponera, Cryptopone and Pseudoponera is the characteristic shape of their propodeal dorsum, which is flattened and has a distinct pinched-in appearance anteriorly. The posterior propodeal margin is unadorned in most ponerines, but Phrynoponera, Streblognathus and most Anochetus have a pair of teeth (of varying structure) at the posterodorsal margin of the propodeum. In Boloponera, Loboponera and Plectroctena, the posterolateral margins of the propodeum are drawn out into lamellae (this is apparently a synapomorphy of these genera). Finally, the shape of the propodeal spiracles is a useful diagnostic character within Ponerinae. It varies from slit-shaped to ovoid to round, and is usually correlated with body size (slit-shaped in large taxa, round in small taxa). Metapleural Gland Orifice. The metapleural gland orifice appears to be a rich source of characters for ponerine systematics, but we have been able to give it only a cursory consideration in this study. The location and direction of opening of the metapleural gland orifice varies a great deal among ponerines. In Platythyrea, Harpegnathos, and members of the Plectroctena group the metapleural gland orifice opens laterally and somewhat anterior of the\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PONERINAE\n\nZootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press ·\n\n13\n\nposteroventral corner of the propodeum (this may be the ancestral condition within Ponerinae). In most other ponerines the orifice opens posterolaterally at the posteroventral corner of the propodeum, though in some taxa (e.g., Hypoponera and many members of the Ponera group) the orifice is located on the posterior face of the propodeum and opens posteriorly. Some ponerine groups have accessory grooves or cuticular flanges associated with the metapleural gland orifice, and these are often useful diagnostic or phylogenetic characters. For example, many Platythyrea and many members of the Pachycondyla group have a lateral longitudinal groove leading up to the metapleural gland orifice, possibly functioning to facilitate the spread of gland contents. The presence of cuticular flanges anterior and posterior to the orifice is synapomorphic for Buniapone and Paltothyreus. Members of the Pachycondyla group, as well as Diacamma and Bothroponera (s.s.) have a characteristic U-shaped cuticular lip posterior to the orifice. Future examination of both external and internal metapleural gland structure in ponerines will likely yield additional informative characters. Legs. The legs bear a number of useful diagnostic characters, including the number and type of meso-/ metatibial spurs, the number of preapical tarsal claws, the prominence of the arolia, the presence of femoral and metatibial glands, and the presence of stout traction setae on the mesotibiae. For an overview of these glands see Billen (2009). Most ponerines have two mesotibial and two metatibial spurs, and this is undoubtedly the ancestral condition (Bolton, 2003). In Platythyrea all spurs are pectinate, while in most Ponerini one spur of each pair is pectinate and the other is simple or barbulate. The loss of the second metatibial spur has occurred repeatedly in ponerine evolution, and is particularly common in small bodied hypogeic taxa (e.g., Ponera, Simopelta, Thaumatomyrmex, Fisheropone, Hypoponera, and nearly all members of the Plectroctena group). A few genera (e.g., Cryptopone, Centromyrmex and Anochetus) are variable for this character. The number of metatibial spurs was traditionally thought to split Ponerini into two groups, but the phylogenetic distribution of taxa with only a single spur clearly demonstrates that they are non-monophyletic. Despite the variability of this character within some genera, its often subjective scoring (as discussed by Brown, 1963), and its poor utility as a phylogenetic marker, the number of metatibial spurs is still generally a useful diagnostic character within Ponerinae in combination with other characters. The presence and number of preapical teeth on the tarsal claws is a valuable diagnostic character for several genera. Most ponerines have unarmed tarsal claws, but several large-bodied genera have a single preapical tooth (e.g., Dinoponera, Hagensia, Harpegnathos, Megaponera, Paltothyreus, most Platythyrea, and some Ophthalmopone) and in most Leptogenys the tarsal claws are pectinate (rarely with only one or two preapical teeth). The arolia are also useful characters, as they are enlarged and prominent (even bright white) in several ponerine genera (Platythyrea, Harpegnathos, Diacamma, Simopelta, Mayaponera, and most Neoponera). Prominent arolia may be plesiomorphic within Ponerinae, given their phylogenetic distribution. Another leg character is the presence of longitudinal and probably glandular grooves in the meso- and/or metafemora of Boloponera, Loboponera and Plectroctena (the grooves are probably synapomorphic for these three genera). Visually, the gland at the apex of the metatibia varies from an obvious subcuticular sac, to a relatively smooth patch of cuticle (the pore plate) to a dense cluster of (often spatulate) hairs, to a small cluster of unspecialized hairs only slightly more dense than the remaining hairs on the tibia (Hölldobler et al., 1996b). This gland is broadly present across the subfamily although it is not visible externally in some species of Mesoponera, Odontoponera and Pseudoponera and appears to be absent from Parvaponera and Streblognathus (although this absence needs to be confirmed through dissection). Finally, several hypogeic genera have stout traction setae on the mesotibiae (and often metatibiae): Centromyrmex, Feroponera, Promyopias, and most Cryptopone and Parvaponera. These setae can be helpful in diagnosis. Petiole. The petiole is highly variable within Ponerinae and provides many useful diagnostic characters. In a few genera the petiole is much longer than it is broad (e.g., Dolioponera, Harpegnathos and most Platythyrea), but in most ponerines the petiole is either roughly cuboidal (about as long as broad) or squamiform (scale-like, much broader than long). The phylogenetic distribution of different petiole structures suggests that petioles change rapidly in evolutionary time, though the adaptive benefits (if any) of each petiole shape are unclear. The exact shape of the petiole is highly variable among taxa, with many genera having important diagnostic characters in their petioles. The two most extreme examples are the petioles of Streblognathus, which is unique among ants in having a long posterodorsal keel (reminiscent of the dorsal fins of sharks or whales), and of Phrynoponera, which has five sharp spines or teeth jutting posteriorly from the posterodorsal margin of the petiole. Other examples of diagnostic petiole shapes include the dorsally semicircular petioles of Pseudoneoponera, the bispinose cuboidal\n\n14 · Zootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press\n\nSCHMIDT & SHATTUCK\n\npetioles of Diacamma, the emarginate petioles of Odontoponera and many Anochetus, the coniform and often unispinose petioles of Odontomachus and some Anochetus, and the sharply margined squamiform petiole of Hagensia. The subpetiolar process is undoubtedly a source of many useful characters, but we did not attempt a full evaluation of its diversity. Some notable diagnostic characters of the subpetiolar process include the presence of an anterior fenestra (Ponera, Emeryopone, and maybe some Hypoponera) and the presence of paired posterior teeth. Some members of the Plectroctena group have highly modified anteroventral petiolar articulations (see discussion under that group). Gaster. The last set of characters considered for this revision are gaster (abdominal segments 3 to 11, abbreviated as A3, A4, etc.) characters. Most members of Ponerini (and a few Platythyrea) have the helcium, to which the petiole attaches, projecting from low on the anterior face of A3. In nearly all of these taxa, A3 has a high vertical face above the helcium, with the one exception being Harpegnathos, in which the vertical face is shortened. In a few groups within Ponerini, as well as nearly all Platythyrea, the helcium projects from near midheight on the anterior face of A3. All Ponerini with this character state are hypogeic: Boloponera, Buniapone, Centromyrmex, Dolioponera, Feroponera, Promyopias, and some Cryptopone. This suggests that a high helcium has an adaptive benefit in hypogeic ponerines, perhaps by enabling more efficient gaster curling while hunting in tight spaces. Another somewhat useful character is the degree of constriction between the presclerites and postsclerites of A4. While generally consistent within genera, this character is often difficult to assess, and in many cases is of limited utility as a diagnostic tool. In most ponerines the constriction is moderately deep and girdles the sclerites, but in some taxa the constriction is particularly deep (e.g., many members of the Plectroctena group) and in others it is absent (e.g., Asphinctopone and Phrynoponera). The presence of a stridulitrum on the pretergite of A4 is also a useful character, but it again can be difficult to assess, and its presence is variable in many genera. In Loboponera and some Emeryopone the tergite of A4 is strongly vaulted, probably as an adaptation to hunting in tight spaces. Finally, some lineages have evolved rows of stout setae on the hypopygium on either side of the sting apparatus (this is the case in Dinoponera, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Paltothyreus, some Leptogenys, and rarely in Ponera). An additional gastral character is the prora, a cuticular process or prominence that projects forward from the anterior surface of abdominal sternite III, below the helcium. It occurs throughout the Ponerini and is large and obvious in most genera, being easily visible in lateral and ventral view as a U-shaped ridge of cuticle, a tubercle of very variable size, or a distinct prow. However, the prora is reduced and not externally visible in three genera, Brachyponera, Iroponera and Phrynoponera. There is no evidence that this reduction is a synapomorphy for these groups but is rather a convergent loss. See Bolton & Fisher (2008b) for a detailed discussion of this character within Phrynoponera. Characters for Future Consideration. This study emphasizes external characters of the worker caste (which are generally also present in the queen caste). Two important characters which were not evaluated here are the number of labial and maxillary palp segments, which could be useful diagnostic characters (Brown, 1963; Bolton, 2003). A wealth of additional characters useful for diagnosis or phylogenetic analysis are likely to come from careful considerations of the mesosoma venter, helcium, mouthparts, details of abdominal segment articulation, internal structure (Hashimoto, 1996), ultrastructure, and histological variation, as well as reproductive characters of all castes and both sexes, wing characters for alate queens and males, all other characters of males, and larval characters. Keller (2011) examined a wealth of morphological characters in his analysis of poneromorph relationships; these deserve deeper study to determine their utility for phylogenetic and diagnostic purposes within the Ponerinae. Finally, as described above, careful study of ponerine metapleural gland orifices and subpetiolar processes are also likely to yield many additional useful characters.\n\nClassification of Ponerinae Proposed Here Ponerinae contains two tribes, Platythyreini, with the single genus Platythyrea, and Ponerini with the remaining genera. Ponerini is here divided into six informal genus groups based on molecular phylogenetic results (Schmidt, 2013). Firm morphological synapomorphies have not been found for all of these groups, and their relationships are still unresolved, but the monophyly of each is generally well supported by the available evidence.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PONERINAE\n\nZootaxa 3817 (1) © 2014 Magnolia Press ·\n\n15\n\nPlatythyreini Platythyrea Roger = Eubothroponera Clark Ponerini = Thaumatomyrmecini syn. nov.
