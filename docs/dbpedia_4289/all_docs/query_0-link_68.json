The historical record shows that the use of animal-based remedies is an extremely old practice, which can be found in the pharmacological texts of not only the Egyptian medical tradition, but also those of the Mesopotamian, Roman, and Greek medical traditions. The phenomenon of zootherapy – that is, using therapeutics based on medicines obtained from animals, or ultimately deriving from them – occurs all over the world, and reaches back into antiquity. Domestic and wild animals, as well as their by-products, were important ingredients in drugs used for curative, protective, and preventive medicine. In both the past and the present, the use of animal-based medicines has had far-reaching implications in terms of ecology and ecomony. Their availability and accessibility have long been a concern for doctors using animals and their by-products, and the potential of overexploitation is a real threat, which has been alleviated by the mass rearing of animals, including medicinal insects. According to Lokeshwari and Shantibala, one can broadly classify the current exploitation and utilization of insects into four different categories. First, insects are used as industrial resources, such as lac and natural dye. Second, they are consumed as food and taken as medicine. Third, they appear in forensic entomology, and finally they possess a high ecological importance regarding biomass recycling and so on. The medicinal use of insects, i.e. entomotherapy, has drawn the attention and the resources of pharmacological researchers in the search for new drugs. Many such researchers hope to find bioactive compounds that may lead to new therapeutics. Shrivastava and Prakash, for example, see the potential for the discovery of new drugs, especially with regard to cytotoxins and anticancer compounds, neurotoxins, antibiotics, and antivirals. A famous example is cantharidin and its derivatives, which can be found in several species of blister beetles of the genera Mylabris and Lytta (Meloidae). Mylabris cichorii is, for instance, found in parts of India and China, and it seems that it was also used in Tibetan medicine (see below).\n\n10 Still 2003, p. 118.\n\n11 Alves & Rosa 2005, p. 2.\n\n12 Feng et al. 2009, p. 313.\n\n13 Ibid.\n\n2The Chinese and Indian medical traditions, both of which have had a lasting influence on the Tibetan medical tradition, are known to draw on animals for curing diseases, including a wide range of insects. It has been said that about 13% of the medicinal substances used in Chinese medicine derive from animals. Some authors speak of more than 1500 animal species that have been recorded to be of some medicinal use in the Chinese tradition. According to Feng et al., in Chinese medicine there are approximately 300 medicinal insect species distributed across 70 genera, 63 families, and 14 orders, and an estimated 1700 traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions include medicinal insects or insect-derived crude drugs. They point out that in the earliest Chinese pharmacopeia, more than twenty kinds of insect-derived drugs from eight species of insects are recorded. The famous Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao gangmu) composed by Li Shizhen (1518-1593) contains seventy-three types of insect-based drugs, which derive from sixty species of insects. It is estimated that more than one hundred kinds of medicinal insects have been recorded for use in ancient times.\n\n14 Unnikrishnan 1998, p. 2. On both texts, see Wujastyk 2003, pp. 39ff., 104ff.\n\n15 Mahawar & Jaroli 2008, p. 10.\n\n16 Meyer-Rochow &Chakravorty 2013.\n\n3It has also been estimated that in Ayurveda about 15-20% of its materia medica derive from animal products. In the Caraka-saṃhitā, for example, 230 types of animals and 380 types of animal substances are mentioned. Similarly, approximately 225 types of animals are mentioned in the Suśruta-saṃhitā. Most of these references discuss animals as food and medicine. Beside the classical texts of Ayurveda, medicinal animals are an integral part of folk medicine. A recent review summarizing and analysing the data in fifteen research works on zootherapeutic practices in different parts of India concludes that about 109 animals are used in 270 medical applications. With regard to insects specifically, studies have shown that they are used in various ways among Indian ethnic communities. Some edible insects are consumed, and others are gathered for therapeutic uses. Building upon this background, the present article seeks to clarify the therapeutic importance of medicinal insects and introduce some of the insects that were used in the Tibetan medical tradition by analysing traditional medical sources.\n\nThe classification of animals in the Tibetan medical tradition\n\n17 Regarding the medical texts from Turfan, see Francke 1924a, 1924b, 1925, Hübotter 1928, Taube 1980, (...)\n\n18 See Beckwith 1980, Yoeli-Tlalim 2013.\n\n19 See Akasoy & Yoeli-Tlalim 2007.\n\n20 This can be found in virtually all medical treatises. It was a standard procedure.\n\n4The earliest preserved sources of the Tibetan medical tradition are the medical texts found at Dunhuang and Turfan. They can be tentatively dated to around the 9th or 10th century. They are available in the form of modern editions and on online databases. They give important insights into the application of plant, mineral, animal, and human substances in the early instructional texts of Tibetan medicine. Previous research has shown that some of these substances originate in far-off regions and were made accessible to the Tibetan doctors via long-distance trade, which is reflected in the specific Tibetan names for certain remedies and materia medica that clearly show signs of their foreign origins, such as the remedy theriac, and the medicinal substances camphor and saffron. Tibetan areas also contributed to this pan-Asian trade network, by supplying substances like musk, for example. Even in these early sources, animal products are mentioned as components of drugs, but these were not the only uses of animal substances. Felt, for example, was also used to treat wounds, and milk was recommended to accompany the ingestion of certain drugs. The size of the droppings of certain animals also served as a standard of comparison when creating medicinal pills.\n\n21 The Four Tantras consists of the Root Tantra, the Explanatory Tantra, the Instructional Tantra and (...)\n\n5Although animal substances were an integral part of Tibetan medicine, there are only a few systematic and detailed descriptions of them. Even in early sources, details regarding the appearance of the animal and where it is found are very rarely provided, which is in contrast to plants that are often described in detail. The first systematic list of animal materia medica in the Tibetan medical tradition was prepared by Yutok Yönten Gönpo (g.Yu thog Yon tan mgon po, fl. 12th century) in the 20th chapter of the Explanatory Tantra of his fundamental work, the Four Tantras. There he distinguishes different types of materia medica based on the substance from which they are composed, such as precious stones and so on. The last category of this schema is animal-based medicine, and it is the category in which formulae for most, but not all, animal products have been compiled. Some animal products can also be found in the category called “medicinal sap” (tsimen, rtsi sman), which can derive from roots, trees, and animals. The most important “animal sap” or “animal secretion” are (elephant’s) bezoar, musk, and bear bile.\n\n22 Parfionovitch et al. 1992, pp. 75ff., 231ff.\n\n6The category of medicinal animals in the Four Tantras is further classified into thirteen sub-categories. These include (1) horns, (2) bones, (3) flesh, (4) blood, (5) bile, (6) fat, (7) brain, (8) skin, (9) nails, claws, beaks, and hooves, (10) small hairs and feathers, (11) urine, (12) faeces, and (13) the bodies of insects. Reviewing each item in the list, however, it becomes clear that other categories – such as the liver, stomach, lungs, tongues, and testicles of the animals – were also used to classify animal products used in medicines. These lists also include substances of human origin such as human bones, flesh, fat, brain, urine and faeces. Taken as a whole, the category of medicinal animals comprises ninety-six kinds of animal substances. Based on the respective categories, there are nine kinds of horns, fifteen kinds of bones (including cowry and snail shell), thirteen kinds of flesh, three types of liver, one kind of stomach, four kinds of tongues, two kinds of testicles, eight kinds of blood, four kinds of fat, five kinds of brain, four kinds of skin, one kind of beak or scale, three kinds of hooves, four kinds of feathers, two kinds of thin hair, two kinds of urine, ten kinds of faeces, and seven kinds of whole bodies of insects and others. Note that bile is listed in the overview but not further exemplified in the list, because it is, as already mentioned above, dealt with in the category of “medicinal sap”. In this regard, Yönten Gönpo mentions the bile of a bear only but as it will discussed below the bile of various animals could be used for medicinal purposes as indicated by Tendzin Püntsok. However, it would be mistaken that to think that these lists represent all animal substances mentioned in the Four Tantras. In the Instructional Tantra, for example, one finds further substances not included in the list found in the Explanatory Tantra. Sangyé Gyamtso (Sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, 1653-1705), who wrote a commentary entitled the Blue Beryl on the Four Tantras, adds the substances described in the Instructional Tantra in his discussion about materia medica, and also includes them among the illustrations in his series of medical thangkas. For several centuries, the commentarial literature on the Four Tantras remained the main written source for systematic information on animals used in Tibetan medicine.\n\n23 Shel gong shel phreng 384/11, 390/17, 396/22, 400/18, 408/13, 410/16. For references, see appendix.\n\n24 Shel gong shel phreng 382/11, 384/11, 385/6, 388/14, 390/15, 394/11, 400/18, 410/16, 413/21. For re (...)\n\n7Scholarship on matera medica within the Tibetan medical tradition completely changed with the seminal work known as the Lumps of Crystal. A Rosary of Crystal (Shel gong shel phreng) written by Tendzin Püntsok (bsTan ’dzin phun tshogs, b. 1672). His work covers all sorts of materia medica, and consists of two separate works: Lumps of Crystal, which is a concise list of materia medica and their healing potentials, and A Rosary of Crystal, which is its commentary. The ninth section of this work describes medicinal substances that derive from animals, and it is subdivided into twenty-nine divisions, occasionally with subitems. The divisions include (1) horns and so on, (2) eyes, (3) tongues, (4) teeth, (5) throats and necks, (6) hearts, (7) lungs, (8) livers, (9) bile, (10) spleens, (11) kidneys, (12) stomachs, (13) small intestines, (14) genitals, (15) bones and so on, (16) bone marrow, (17) brain, (18) fat, (19) blood, (20) flesh, (21) skin, hide, and so on, (22) hair and so on, (23) feathers, (24) nails, claws, beaks, and hooves, (25) bezoar, (26) faeces, (27) urine and semen, (28) milk including milk, curd, and butter, and (29) whole bodies of insects, eggs of birds, and so on. Similarly to the Four Tantras, “animal secretions”, such as musk and bear bile, are included in the section on “medicinal sap”. In general, Tendzin Püntsok used the Four Tantras as the main base for his treatise, but expanded, supplemented, and elaborated upon it. The total number of body parts deriving from different species varies, for example, and is not the same as the Four Tantras. He lists the eyes used for medicinal purposes as coming from five species, and he describes the tongues of seven animals that can be of help in curing diseases. Concerning the brain, he registers sixteen types of brains from different animals, and also from humans. The biggest demand was apparently for the bile of nineteen animals, including humans, as well as fifty-three types of bones coming from animals such as sheep, goats, fish, snail shells, tortoises, fossils, and humans. According to Tendzin Püntsok, many animals possessed several parts that could potentially be of use in Tibetan medicine. A doctor might use the neck, stomach, brain, meat, feathers, and excrement of the bearded vulture, known as gowo (go bo) in Tibetan. Similarly, the cinereous vulture called jagö (bya rgod) had several body parts that were of interest, such as the eyes, neck, heart, bile, stomach, bones, and flesh, as well as its excrement and urine. In contrast to his long descriptions of plants, however, Tendzin Püntsok does not discuss the animals in any significant degree of detail. He usually just names them and neglects any further information regarding where they can be found, how they live, and so on.\n\n25 The information that Jampel Dorjé bears the monastic name Yeshé Döndrup Tenpé Gyemtsen can be found (...)\n\n8Scholarship on animal-based materia medica further progressed in the 19th century when a monk from Inner Mongolia composed a treatise on materia medica in the Tibetan language. In his Beautifully Wondrous Eye Ornament (mDzes mtshar mig rgyan), Jampel Dorjé (’Jam dpal rdo rje), alias Yeshé Döndrup Tenpé Gyemtsen (Ye shes don grub bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan, 1792-1855), includes illustrations that mostly derive from the Bencao gangmu, originally written by Li Shizhen and later printed in numerous editions. In addition to Tibetan names for materia medica, he also includes Manchu, Mongolian, and Chinese names, and the latter with a rough pronunciation in Tibetan. It was never of great significance for the Tibetan medical tradition, but it become important for Mongolian medicine. Partially deviating from the precedents set by the Four Tantras, Jampel Dorjé chose some new criteria for the classification of materia medica, which becomes most obvious with regard to animals. He divides the animal-based materia medica into eight categories, which consist of:\n\n26 The Tibetan designations are: 1. khron gyis brko ba’i sde, 2. mchu yis brko ba’i sde, 3. ri dwags k (...)\n\n1. Animals scratching with their feet\n\n2. Animals pecking with their beaks\n\n3. Herbivorous animals\n\n4. Carnivorous animals\n\n5. Animals eating with force\n\n6. Animals domesticated by humans\n\n7. Animals living in dens and burrows\n\n8. Animals living in water and damp places.\n\n27 rGyud bzhi 54/13.\n\n28 These are: 1. The category of animals digging with their claws (khron gyis rko ba’i sde), 2. The ca (...)\n\n29 In the opinion of Dash, both first categories of animals digging with their claws and animals diggi (...)\n\n30 gZhan la phan gter 394/2.\n\n31 gSer gyi thur ma 74/17.\n\n9These classifications are quite unsual and are not found in other Tibetan works on materia medica. Jampel Dorjé certainly took the sixteenth chapter of the Explanatory Tantra which deals with the normal diet, including meat and fish, as a basis for his categories, but Yutok Yönten Gönpo distinguishes between several kinds of animal flesh, illustrating them by giving examples. It should be noted that Yutok Yönten Gönpo enumerates a total of nine categories, but they are collectively referred to as only eight categories (sde brgyad). It is possible that the third and fourth categories were once considered to be a single category, or a category was later inserted into the Four Tantras. Commentators on the Four Tantras, such as Kyempa Tsewang (sKyem pa Tshe dbang, b. 1514) and Sangyé Gyamtso did not see this difference between eight and nine categories as important. The commentary of Pema Karpo (Padma dkar po, 1527-1592), which only identifies the main and sub-points of Four Tantras, counts only eight categories, lacking the category of large animals in the open mountains. The same applies to the commentary written by Lozang Chödrak (Blo bzang chos grags, 1638-1710).\n\n32 Srikantha Murthy 2004-2005 [1992-1997], vol. 1, pp. 83ff.\n\n33 In the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya-saṃhitā, these eight categories are: 1. mṛga (ri dwags), 2. viṣkira (khron rko(...)\n\n10The schema for the categorization of animals in the Four Tantras derives from the Ayurvedic treatise, the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya-saṃhitā of Vāgbhaṭa. In the latter book, accessible to Tibetan scholars through translation, the normal diet is discussed in the sixth chapter of the first book, which describes a normal diet. Regarding flesh and meat, Vāgbhaṭa classifies the animals in eight classes, based on zoological categories known in ancient India.\n\n34 Zimmermann [1982] 1999, pp. 100, 103 etc., Olivelle [2002] 2011, pp. 377f.\n\n11In the Beautifully Wondrous Eye Ornament, Jampel Dorjé provides a brief description of each animal and sometimes their healing potential, with the latter information deriving from either the Four Tantras, the Blue Beryl, or A Rosary of Crystal. In a few cases, his descriptions might also include mythical animals, such as the so-called Kalanta bird. He places the Kalanta bird in the first group of animals, labelled as the “category of animals digging with their claws”, which can be traced back to the Ayurvedic category, viṣkira (trönko, khron rko). One can interpret the Sanskrit term literally as birds that “scatter their food with their feet”, or as birds that “scratch the soil in search of food”. Tibetan translators of the Sanskrit term have interpreted viṣkira to mean birds that “dig/scratch (the soil) with their claws (in search of food)”. Jampel Dorjé chose to group the Kalanta bird under this category, most of which are known species. Therein he describes it as follows (Fig. 5):\n\n35 ka la nta ni / shin tu ltas bzang gi dus su ’babs pa’i bye’u ste / lus che ba dang kha dog snga lng (...)\n\nKalantaka: The baby bird (indicates) that an auspicious time has begun. The body (of the adult bird) is large and its tail feathers, which are of five colours, are very beautiful. His singing entangles those who have ears, and when he hovers (in the sky), all the big and small birds follow him. In the Lumps of Crystal it is stated: “The head of the male pigeon Kalantaka is a powerful drug for the restoration of virility, and it is the best among the remedies for healing wounds”. The baby bird, which is pleasent to hear, resembles a pigeon and is greenish. One must not confuse it with the Kalapingga (bird).\n\n36 This also has the name Kalandaka. Dave identifies it as chestnut-bellied nuthatch (Sitta castanea) (...)\n\n37 This meaning mainly applies in Buddhist literature. It can also be used as a generic term for sparr (...)\n\n12The illustration, as well as the names listed in Mongolian, Manchurian, and Chinese make it clear that Jampel Dorjé is describing a phoenix. This is surprising because the phoenix does not generally play a role in Tibetan mythology or in Tibetan medicine. The reference to the Lumps of Crystal is also misleading, for Tendzin Püntsok is describing a real bird and not the mythological phoenix. The Kalantaka bird sometimes occurs in Buddhist literature, but it remains unclear what kind of birds it is. Thus, Jampel Dorjé is combining several different descriptions of birds, both real and mythological, by introducing the Kalanta bird into the Tibetan medical tradition. At the same time, he warns that one should not confuse the Kalanta bird with another mythological being, the kalapingga (in Tibetan) or kalaviṅka (in Sanskrit), which is a mythological half-human creature with the body of a bird and a long flowing tail. It is famous for its sweet voice.\n\nThe medicinal insects in Tibetan medicine\n\n38 The broad medicinal use of honey in the Tibetan medical tradition deserves a separate study. It wil (...)\n\n39 In this regard, one has to note that both Western and Tibetan authors usually are simplifying nosol (...)\n\n40 I have chosen these insects because they are mentioned in various Tibetan medicinal sources and in (...)\n\n13It should be noted at the outset that insects were used only to a very limited extent in Tibetan medicine. The only important exception is the lac insect (gyakyek, rgya skyegs), which can be found in numerous Tibetan drugs. The honey of bees has often been added to drugs (drangtsi, sbrang rtsi) as well. In the following paragraphs, eleven insects that are mentioned in Tibetan medical treatises will be discussed, demonstrating how Tibetan doctors described them, potential identifications provided by modern authors, and which healing potentials they are said to possess. The medicinal insects considered include flies, ants, two insects whose existence is doubtful, cicadas, butterflies, grasshoppers, and four kinds of beetles.

It does occur in the treatise Ten Million Instructions: Relics (Bye ba ring bsrel) written by Nyamnyi Dorjé (mNyam nyid rdo rje, 1439-1475), however. There it is said that one should use the body of the “flesh fly” with big eyes as an ingredient in a remedy for “restoring virility” (rotsa, ro tsa). In the 18th century, Nyamnyi Dorjé’s drug was included in three important lists of Tibetan medicaments, one compiled by Tendzin Püntsok, and two by Karma Ngedön Tendzin Trinlé Rapgyé (Karma nges don bstan ’dzin ’phrin las rab rgyas, b. 1770). Orgyen Tekchok (O rgyan Theg mchog, b. 19th century) also adds it to his drug section on “restoring virility”. In the prestigious compilation of Tibetan drugs prepared by the Mentsikhang in Lhasa in 2005, this medicament is listed as the drug named Soma Senggé-25 (sro ma seng ge nyer lnga). The “flesh fly” is not discussed by any other scholars, with the exception of the contemporary Chinese scholar Luo Dashang, who states that it might be used to boost the male sex drive.\n\nRaksha mikmé (raksha mig med)\n\n46 Given the misspelled name Eormica fusca L., it seems that rNam rgyal thar 2006 and dGra ’dul 2009 s (...)\n\n47 grog ma ni / raksha mig med / rgyu rgyur / gshin rje’i bu zer / mgo dang stod smad so sor chad cing (...)\n\n48 raksha mig (grog ma yin) med rtsa ’byed dmu chu sbyong, Shel gong shel phreng 422/15.\n\n49 For more information, see Kletter & Kriechbaum 2001, p. 343.\n\n50 srog chags grog ma la spyir ming lnga ’dir raksha / mig med dang gnyis des rtsa kha ’byed la dmu ch (...)\n\n51 de'i tshang gi sas sha skrangs 'joms, Vaiḍūrya sngon po 340/4.\n\n52 Srikantha Murthy 2004-2005 [1992-1997], vol. 2, p. 507.

Note that the painter mistakenly depicts the ant (or ter (...)\n\n15If one consults modern publications on Tibetan materia medica written by Tibetan authors, one will come across statements on the use of ants in Tibetan medicine. They uniformily identify such ants as Formica fusca, a black-coloured ant, but it remains unclear how they came to this precise identification. With the exception of the treatise written by Jampel Dorjé, there are only a few sketchy traditional descriptions of ants in Tibetan medical literature. Jampel Dorjé states that their bodies are segmented into heads, upper, and lower bodies, and that they are black, have six legs, and emerge from nests. Because ant nests in India are big like fortresses, they are depicted as emerging from just such a nest in the Beautifully Wondrous Eye Ornament (Fig. 6). In the Tibetan language, ants are also called raksha mikmé, which literally means “eyeless demons” (raksha mig med). In A Rosary of Crystal by Tendzin Püntsok, it is said that ants can open “channels” and purify muchu (dmu chu), which is characterised by accumulation of fluids in the body. Tendzin Püntsok probably drew this information from the Blue Beryl of Sangyé Gyamtso, where this statement is also made. In this regard, Sangyé Gyamtso also mentions the use of soil from an anthill for supressing the “swelling of the flesh” (shatrang, sha skrangs). Although he provides no details for how this is done, one can assume that he was influenced by the Ayurvedic tradition, in which such a use is recommended and explained. In the twenty-first chapter of the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya-saṃhitā, for example, in the section on therapeutics for “wind” (vāta) diseases, Vāgbhaṭa discusses a medicinal paste that includes the soil of an anthill together with mustard and honey. The use of ants themselves is not mentioned in Vāgbhaṭa’s work, however. This particular use of soil of an anthill is also depicted in the famous Tibetan medical paintings that serve as illustrations for the Blue Beryl (Fig. 1).\n\n54 raksha chur bsdus srod la khyor gang btang / khams ’khrugs lus lci phrum ser khyer na yin, rGyud bz (...)\n\n55 ru raksha drag po’i mig ces zur chag pa rag sha ste mig med lnga chur bsdus pa’o, sKyem pa Tshe dba (...)\n\n56 ru raksha drag po’i mig ces zur chag pa rag sha ste mig med lnga chur bsdus pa la bshad na’ang / zh (...)\n\n57 Man ngag lhan thabs 594/1, Man ngag lhan thabs brda bkrol 197/20.\n\n58 raksha ni ru raksha lnga zhes bai sngon dang srog chags grog ma lnga zhes bla rta ltar dka’ ’grel l (...)\n\n16Moreover, it seems that in the past some doctors thought that ants could be used for the diagnosis of poisoning. In the eighty-seventh chapter of the Instructional Tantra dealing with “compounded poison” (jarduk, sbyar dug), Yutok Yönten Gönpo states that one should boil raksha in water and give the patient a handful to drink in the evening after sunset. If the patient’s mind is disturbed, the text states, and his or her body becomes heavy and he or she begins to shiver, he or she has been poisoned. Later commentators such as Kyempa Tsewang and Sangyé Gyamtso have understood the term raksha as corrupted form of ru raksha, the Tibetan term for the Sanskrit rudrākṣa, the seeds of specific large evergreen trees used for prayer beads. Others such as Lozang Chödrak (Blo bzang chos grags, 1638-1710), Könchok Chödrak (dKon mchog chos grags, 1646-1718), Karma Ngedön Tendzin Trinlé Rapgyé (b. 18th century), and Trashibum (bKra shis ’bum, b. 1726) have interpreted raksha as an “ant” (drokma, grog ma) or “eyeless demon” (rakshamikmé, raksha mig med). Lungrik Tendar (Lung rigs bstan dar, 1842?-1915) also notes in his explanation of difficult terms in the Supplement to the Instructional Tantra, a work written by Sangyé Gyamtso supplementing the Instructional Tantra of Yutok Yönten Gönpo, that there are two opinions: one that maintains raksha refers to ruruksha, and one that interprets raksha as a reference to ants. The same statement can be found in Lungrik Tendar’s work explaining the difficult expressions of the Four Tantras.\n\n59 brag dkar (bya rgod sha) bdud rtsi brag (sbrul sha) ’og rtsi / chu yi (nya khyi ba) bdud rtsi rdo ’ (...)\n\n60 yang ’brum bcos kyi gsang sman ni / rang shi’i rkang mar 'brum lkog [skogs] gnyis la byed / la las (...)\n\n61 chu ’dren gsang sman / raksha mig med [grog ma] sbyang shis cha drug la / srad dkar skyu ru glang s (...)\n\n17Beside these brief descriptions, ants are rarely mentioned in Tibetan medical sources. In the early text King of the Moon (Zla ba’i rgyal po), ants are listed as an ingredient for a powder that is used to treat “swellings in the throat and the uvula” (gaklhok, gag lhog). It can also be found in a brief treatment for “smallpox” (drum, ’brum) written by Pöntsang Yeshé (dPon tshang Ye shes, fl. 17th century). Moreover, ants were part of pills administered to drain the patient’s body of fluids, as explained by Jampel Chökyi Tendzin Trinlé (’Jam dpal chos kyi bstan ’dzin ’phrin las, 1789-1838) in his work A Jewel Mine of Instructions (Man ngag rin chen ’byung gnas). Given the number of potential therapies and extant medical sources, this number of descriptions is not exceedingly high. Perhaps a full survey of all available Tibetan medical texts will bring to light more results. Such an endeavour would not be a small contribution, particularly in light of the notion that ants can be used to open “channels”, as maintained by Tendzin Püntsok in his A Rosary of Crystal, for which textual evidence in clinical sources is still required.\n\nZhobur (zho sbur)\n\n62 zho sbur la spyi dang ’dir ming gcig ’khrul med sbur chung des chu ser la phan, Vaiḍūrya sngon po 3 (...)\n\n63 Le ’dod mos 2009, p. 294.

Its name can be literally understood as the “yogurt beetle”, and Sangyé Gyamtso states that it is a small beetle that is beneficial for “yellowish fluid” diseases. “Yellowish fluid” (chuser, chu ser) is a sticky fluid that is said to be located between flesh and skin and in the joints. It has a mixed reddish-yellow colour; the red colour is a waste product of blood, and the pale-yellow colour is a refined product of “bile”. If it increases or decreases it causes diseases, which are the so-called diseases of “yellow fluid”. Consulting the fifty-ninth chapter of the Instructional Tantra, one only finds a line where a beetle is recommended for the treatment of “yellow fluid” disease, but not a “yogurt beetle”. In Sangyé Gyamtso’s commentary, the beetle is described as a zhöbur (zhod sbur), probably a mistake for zhobur (zho sbur; see Fig. 2). Later authors on Tibetan medicine have tried to elaborate upon this identification, with Lungrik Tendar stating that zhobur is a small and very quick beetle. Jampel Dorjé suggests that zhobur are worms that emerge when the summer curds become stale (Fig. 7). This is also Sangyé Gyamtso’s interpretation of the term zhobur. Other commentators, such as Kyempa Tsewang and Trashibum, think that the term “beetle” listed in the fifty-ninth chapter of the Instructional Tantra stands for the sebur beetle. Karma Ngedön Tendzin Trinlé Rapgyé thinks that it refers to a “black/dark golden beetle”. Given this complicated and obscure situation, it is hardly surprising that none of the modern publications on Tibetan materia medica include the so-called “yogurt beetle”.\n\nTrumembu (spru ma’i ’bu)\n\n70 For references, see the appendix.\n\n71 spru ma’i ’bu ni / spru ba dkar nag gnyis / dkar po ste/ gdugs dkar can gyi ’bu’o, rGyud bzhi’i rts (...)\n\n72 spru ma’i ’bu khra bo de yi rma yi khrag shor ba sdom mo, sKyem pa Tshe dbang ’Grel pa 444/3.\n\n73 spru dkar gyi dkyil du gnas shing ’tsho ba’i ’bu khra bo, Dri med kun gsal 105/10.\n\n74 spru ma la rigs dkar nag gnyis su phye ba ’di dkar po de’i rtsa ba’am gseb tu gnas pa’i ’bu khra bo (...)\n\n75 spru ma’i ’bu ni spru dkar gyi rtsa bar ston dus ’bu sngo khra yod pa de yin, mKhas pa’i zhal lung(...)\n\n76 spru ma’i ’bu ni / spru dkar ’bu / shu ta dye pa zer / spru dkar gyi lo mar yod pa’i ’bu ste / rgyu (...)\n\n77 For references, see the appendix.\n\n78 Yonten Gonpo 2011a, p. 217.\n\n19The term trumembu means the “worm of the truma plant”, and the truma plant is often distinguished into a white or a bright, and a black or dark type. Some sources also refer to a yellow type. In Western botany, the truma plant potentially corresponds to a wide range of plants, including the genera Heracleum, Notopterygium, Valeriana, Angelica, Thalictrum, Aralia, and Actaea. Namgyel Drakpa Zangpo (Rnam rgyal grags pa bzang po, 1395-1475) describes the worms as being found on the white type. Kyempa Tsewang does not say where they can be found, but only writes that the worms are multi-coloured. Sönam Yeshé Gyentsen (bSod nams ye shes rgyal mtshan, b. 15th century) combines both statements by saying that they live on the white truma plant and are multi-coloured. Lozang Chödrak elaborates upon these descriptions by writing that they live among the roots of the white truma plant. He states that they are multicoloured and about the size of a thumb. Trashibum adds that they occur during autumn. Jampel Dorjé writes that the worms live on the leaves of the white truma plant (Fig. 7). Given the sparse nature of these desriptions, it is hardly surprising that scholars have mostly abstained from identifying the trumembu, sometimes surmising that it is the chrysalis of caterpillars, but not specifying any further. The Translation Department of the Men-Tsee-Khang in Dharamsala has also abstained from translating the term in their English edition of the Four Tantras. They probably were unable to identify the trumembu with any degree of confidence.\n\n79 spru ma’i ’bu yis rtsa khrag shor ba sdom, rGyud bzhi 75/12.

In other words, it stops the bleeding of a cut or injured “channel”. The fact that Sangyé Gyamtso duly notes this healing potential, but does not say anything about the worm (Fig. 4) further indicates the ambiguous nature of the trumembu. In fact, the term “worm of the truma plant” does not figure in his entire commentary, except for the occurance just mentioned. Instead, he consistenly speaks of the “seeds of truma plant” (trumemdru, spru ma’i ’bru). When discussing the truma plant, he says that these seeds are also known under name shuti (shu ti). The conflation of these two words indicates a fundamentel problem in their identification: how should one confidently differentiate the “worm of the truma plant” (trumembu) from the “seed of the truma plant” (trumemdru)?\n\n82 spru ma’i ’bru yis rtsa khrag gcod, ’Bum bzhi vol. 1 249/16\n\n83 spru ’bu bcos nas spru ’bru byas nor, Kun gsal snang mdzod 840/4.\n\n84 spru ma, Shel gong shel phreng 271/8, sbur khras khyi dug spru ’bus khrag shor sdom, Shel gong shel (...)\n\n21In the animal section on materia medica in the Four Tantras, one finds the “worm of the truma plant” as part of animal products used for healing. The Bönpo version of the Four Tantras, the Four Hundred Thousands (’Bum bzhi), renders even this simple identification uncertain, however, because there the “seed of the truma plant” is listed. Although the Four Hundred Thousands includes the “seed” and not the “worm of the truma plant”, the “seed” is still listed in the section on animal products. It seems that the conflation of these two terms frustrated some doctors, for Tendzin Püntsok clearly writes that it is a mistake to amend “worm of the truma plant” to “seed of the truma plant”. Consequently, he does not even mention seeds of the truma plant or bush in his Rosary of Crystal at all, but one finds “worms of the truma plant” as a materia medica of animal origin. Importantly, the truma plant was traditionally prescribed to stop bleeding, which is the same healing potential that these obscure worms are said to have. One might add that the dried roots of the truma plant can look like worms, which causes one to speculate that this could possibly be the origin of these “worms of the truma plant”.\n\nJelep sertra(bye leb ser khra)\n\n85 phye ma leb ni / stag khra / bye stag khra / bye stag / lhung byed zer / me ’od la chags nas bsags (...)\n\n86 For references, see the appendix.\n\n22Tibetan doctors also knew of medicinal usages for butterflies, which are called “yellow mottled flat flying (insect)” (jelep sertra, bye leb ser khra), “flat flying (insect)” (chemalep, phye ma leb), and “tiger (striped) flying (insect)” (jetak, bye stag) in medical works. Butterflies are not listed in the Explanatory Tantra and therefore they are also rarely discussed in the corresponding commentaries. Again, Jampel Dorjé is the exception, for he describes the chemalep as being the yellow mottled butterfly, with a slender and small body, four wings, and colours that are so clear, it is as if they have been painted on (Figs 2, 9). In the literature on Tibetan materia medica, the chemalep is also identified as the common yellow swallowtail, the eastern pale clouded yellow, or the high-altitude butterfly, Parnassius imperator.\n\n87 Phan bde’i sgo ’byed lde mig 248/14, 275/1, sKyem pa Tshe dbang ’Grel pa 232/11, 274/10, Mes po’i z (...)\n\n88 bye stag la spyi dang ’dir ming gcig / de’ang phye ma leb ser khra’i shas so srin dang / nywa log l (...)\n\n89 Shel gong shel phreng 421/20.\n\n90 Le ’dod mos 2009, p. 1117.

It occurs in the chapter on diseases of the teeth, as well as the chapter discussing minor diseases, such as “twisted calf” disease (nyalok, nywa log). In the former chapter, the term “tiger (striped) flying (insect)” (jetak, bye stag) is used, and in the latter the term “tiger striped one” (taktrawo, stag khra bo). The commentators of the Instructional Tantra usually write that these terms refer to the “yellow mottled butterfly” (jelep sertra) in both cases. Based on this actual usuage, Sangyé Gyamtso gives the healing potential of the flesh of the butterfly as curing the “tooth diseases caused by small animals” (sosin, so srin) and “twisted calf” disease. This information is repeated by Tendzin Püntsok in his Lumps of Crystal. In general, sosin disease is characterised by the swelling of dental roots down to the “channels” of the teeth, turning them into pus. It is so painful one cannot touch it, regardless whether the “disease caused by small animals” (sinné, srin nad) is of a hot or cold nature. For a patient with “small animals of teeth”, pain rises and abides, and the teeth ache sharply. The symptoms of “twisted calf” disease are a fine pulse and a urine having a colour like dark butter. One has headaches, painful joints, cramps in the calves, sore “channels”, an upset stomach, diarrhoea, one loses one’s voice, the complexion of one’s face is spoiled, and one speaks nonsense like a madman.\n\nChagapa (cha ga pa)\n\n92 de ma ’dzom na cha ga ni rigs che chung kha dog gi dbye ba mang yang nus pa mtshungs, sKyem pa Tshe (...)\n\n93 cha ga ba ni lte chag gam / tshag tshag pa’am / lte ba san cag gam / seng phrug gnam ’phyogs zhes p (...)\n\n94 cha ga pa la spyir ming lnga ’dir gcig de ni ston ka spang du ’ong ba de phur ba’i kha chu bdud rts (...)\n\n95 cha ga pa ni / cha ga pa zer / mtho bong tsam yang ring / skya smug nag thig can ’dab ma dmar po ld (...)\n\n96 For references, see the appendix.\n\n24It seems that grasshoppers were also used for specific medical applications. Not many detailed descriptions of the grasshopper’s appearance and habitat are found in medical works, which is perhaps due to an opinion expressed by Kyempa Tsewang that, although there exist many types of grasshoppers that can be distinguished by size and colour, they all possess the same healing potential. Seen from this perspective, one could use any grasshopper for medicinal compounds, whatever species it may be. Most treatises just name its synonyms, such as the “one of the (cracking sound) tsaktsak” (tsaktsakpa, tshag tshag pa), the “lion cub that protects the sky”/”lion cub that jumps in the sky” (sengtruk namchong, seng phrug gnam ’phyong / mchong), and others. Sangyé Gyamtso also provides some alternative names, as well as a brief description stating that they appear in the grassland during autumn and can fly. Jampel Dorjé writes that chagapa are about a thumb’s length, are pale brownish with black spots, and have red wings. He also states that if they soar, they make a sound, the last pair of its six legs are long, and their saliva is known as “brownish ambrosia”. He concludes by stating that in China they exist in abundance and consume the harvest (Figs 3, 10). Modern literature on Tibetan materia medica state that chagapa refers to a grasshopper, but they differ in its exact identification. Some say that it is the Oxya chinensis Thunberg, while others think it is the Patanga japonica Bolivar.\n\n97 rGyud bzhi 532/2.\n\n98 rGyud bzhi 624/2.

See also rGyud chung 818/2.\n\n25Chagapa is not listed in the Explanatory Tantra, but it does appear in both the Instructional and Subsequent Tantras. In both cases, chagapa is used for cleansing the “channels”, and in the Instructional Tantra it is mentioned in the eighty-seventh chapter on eliminating “compounded poison” (jarduk, sbyar dug). There it is part of a special three-fold treatment consisting of “gathering”, “killing”, and “cleansing” the poison. In the Subsequent Tantra, it is part of a very important cleansing application regarding the “channels” that forms the entire nineteenth chapter. The most important materia medica used in combination with the grasshopper is the jangpa beetle, which will be discussed below. Here let us merely note that the jangpa beetle is very poisonous, and it had to be combined with the chubur beetle (on this beetle also see below) to counteract its poisonous effect. If the latter beetle was not available, however, three heads of grasshoppers were recommended instead.\n\n100 Bye ba ring bsrel 274/10.\n\n101 Dug srung rim pa 470/8.\n\n26Finally, it has also been stated that the “saliva” of grasshoppers, called “brownish ambrosia”, (dütsi mukpo, bdud rtsi smug po) could be used for a head injury called “dripping brain”. Nyamnyi Dorjé recommends the use of the saliva of grasshoppers for such a medicine purpose in his Ten Million Instructions. Relics, for example. Throughout the instructions of the Tibetan medical tradition, the primary use of grasshoppers, however, was to alleviate or to neutralize the poison of the jangpa beetle. This was achieved not only by adding grasshopper heads to a medicinal preparation as mentioned above, but also by using them as an independent ingredient for the antidote in case a patient has been poisoned by a jangpa beetle.\n\nZindira (zi ldi ra)\n\n102 For references, see the appendix.\n\n103 lte mkhrang nad la gla rtsi byi tang ga / ma ru tse dang smyug rtsi pi pi ling / phur thal sdig sri (...)\n\n104 zi ldi ni zi ldi ra sbur pa chen phur shes mchu [chu?] dug ’byung ba de’o / sbur pa ni bse dri can (...)\n\n27It seems that cicadas (zindira, zi ldi ra) were also used in Tibetan medicine. None of the modern scholars writing on Tibetan materia medica discuss zindira, except those who were engaged in translating Tibetan medical sources that include this insect, such as the Four Tantras and the Blue Beryl. One reason why other authors neglect to engage this insect is probably because Yutok Yönten Gönpo does not include it in his list of materia medica in the twentieth chapter of the Explanatory Tantra. Even Tendzin Püntsok did not include zindira in the Lumps of Crystal. The only medical treatise known so far where it is mentioned is the Four Tantras of Yönten Gönpo, where it appears in the seventy-second chapter of the Instructional Tantra on paediatric diseases. There it is recommended that a particular disease called “stiff navel” (lte mkhrang) be treated with a drug that consists of the ashes made of zindi (zi ldi) and a beetle (bur, sbur), as well as the singed hair of the father and mother of the child, all cleansed in the urine of the child. The various commentators of the Four Tantras have commented on both of these animal terms. Kyempa Tsewang wrote that zindi denotes a large beetle that is able to fly, and from which poisonous fluids emerge. Although the meaning of the latter is uncertain, perhaps it refers to species of beetle that lives in a wet habitat, or to a species living in a burrow that is coated in fluids.\n\n105 zin [zi] ldi zhes pa zi de ra sbur ba chen po phur shas chu dug ’byung ba de’o / sbur ba zes pa ni (...)\n\n106 zi ldi ra la spyi dang ’dir ming gcig de’ang ngo bo che la lo bzhi dbyar du dbyar nyi ldog nad ’byu (...)\n\n107 yang na zi ldir dang sbur ba gnyis nus ldan bsregs thal dang phru gu’i pha ma’i skra gzhob bzhi byi (...)\n\n28This opinion of Kyempa Tsewang is repeated by Lozang Chödrak in his commentary on the Instructional Tantra, which was arranged as the third part of Zurkhar Lodrö Gyelpo’s Oral Instructions of the Forefathers (Mes po’i zhal lung). Sangyé Gyamtso devotes a separate entry for zindira in his supplementary list of materia medica for the twenty-first chapter of the Explanatory Tantra (Fig. 3), and according to him, it has only one designation and no synonyms. The big cicadas emerge at the time of the summer solstice, and only one summer in every four years. The small cicadas emerge at midnight, however, and they are beneficial for diseases caused by its (poisonous) fluids and the “stiff navel” disease of children, which is of the severe type (nyen, gnyan). He does not elaborate on the former type of disease, and while discussing the treament of the pediatric disease, he does not add anything.\n\n108 zi ldi ni dbyar nyi ldog dus byung ba’i sbur ba chen po ser nag ’phur shes pa de nyid chu nang du s (...)\n\n109 zi ldi ni zi ltir ste / bee sngon las / ngo bo che la lo bzhi bar du dbyar nyi ldog nad byung ba de (...)\n\n110 zi ldi ni zin [zi] ldir te / sbur ba chen po rwa can phur [’phur] shes chu dug can gyi sar byung / (...)\n\n111 zi ldir ni / gser rgyan las / zil [zi] der [ldir] spur [sbur] ba chen po ’phur shes chu dug las byu (...)\n\n112 zi ldi ra ni khyi spos pa dang / sbur ni bse sbur gnyis nus bsregs thal / rnag tu khug na phug pa s (...)\n\n29Later commentators were clearly influenced by the Blue Beryl, but also introduced some new information when writing about zindira. Karma Ngedön Tendzin Trinlé Rapgyé, who lived and worked in Eastern Tibet, writes that the zindi are big, dark, golden flying beetles that emerge during the summer solstice. If they move in water, poisonous fluids emerge from them, and they are also called “rising up crawler” (danggok, ldang gog), “soaring crawler” (dinggok, lding gog) and “zi chirping (insect)” (zi[n]dira, zi di [ldi] ra). When discussing the materia medica in his work on the difficult terms in the Four Tantras, Lungrik Tendar usually quotes the Blue Beryl without any addition, but when discussing zindira in the chapter on pediatric diseases he writes that it is a big flying beetle with antennae that emerges in places with poisonous water. Jampel Dorjé cites both the commentary on the Instructional Tantra written by Lozang Chödrak and the commentary by Sangyé Gyamtso, followed by the observation that the big type produces a chirping sound when flying. They live on trees, are yellow-brownish, and are the size of a sebur beetle. The small type has gold on its back and is the size of a finger nail of the little finger, and they fly in masses to the desert (Fig. 8). Trashibum alone gives a different statement, saying that zindi is “dog incense” or “the one of the dog incense”. It remains unclear what he means by this phrase, perhaps referring to the plants that the zindi eat.\n\nSebur (bse sbur)\n\n113 bse sbur ni / sbur ba nag po'o, rGyud bzhi’i rtsa ’grel 186/2, bse sbur ni nag gseb dri can te / sb (...)\n\n114 bse sbur ni nag po rgyab ser zhad can dru dug pa, Si tu sMan ngo gsal byed 115/2, bse sbur ni nag p (...)\n\n115 bse sbur ni sbur ba dri ma can nam bse dri sbur gog ces pa de’o / ’di la rigs ni che ’bring chung g (...)\n\n116 bse sbur ni / spur rog po zer / bai sngon du drin mnan pa’i spur ba zhes pa nag srab mthe bong tsam (...)\n\n117 There is some disagreement regarding what sebur is. One author indicates that it refers to beetles (...)\n\n30The sebur (bse sbur) is another insect that is considered to possess healing potentials. Its name can be understood literally as “stink beetle”, and it is described in some Tibetan sources as a black beetle, a stink beetle, and a black beetle with a stinking smell. Two authors add that its back is golden. Lozang Chödrak provides a more detailed description in his work Golden Annotations written in 1695, where he writes that there are three types: a big, a medium, and a small one. In the opinion of some, he notes, during spring they stay invisible in the ground that is exposed to the sun, and then they appear at dusk. The name of those that soar at the treetops is zindirwa (zi ldir ba), and there are two kinds of them: one big and one small. Others maintain that there are two kinds, big and small, which are called “strong wild yak of the earth” and “yak of mixed breed”. Jampel Dorjé agrees that the sebur is a beetle of strong smell and adds that it is black, slender, and about the size of a thumb. It has six feet, and a stinking smell comes from its anus (Fig. 12). In academic literature, opinions differ regarding which beetle the sebur might be according to Western identification, but most agree that it is a species of dung beetle or a plant-feeding stink bug.\n\n118 Zla ba’i rgyal po 168/3.\n\n119 bse sbur bying bying thu lus glang thabs ’joms, rGyud bzhi 75/11.\n\n120 Kletter & Kriechbaum 2001, p. 347, Semichov 1981.\n\n31The sebur insect is already mentioned in the King of the Moon treatise in the chapter on treating diseases of the stomach. There we learn that if sebur is mixed with garlic and then combined with water, it might have a healing effect. When Yutok Yönten Gönpo listed animals and their healing potentials in the twentieth chapter of his Explanatory Tantras, he also included the sebur insect, stating that “sebur and jingjing tulu provide relief from the langtap (disease)”. Langtap disease (glang thabs) can be characterised as painful cramps, which might occur together with indigestion, and which might also be caused by a disturbance of “small animals” (sin, srin) living in the human body, especially in the stomach. There are four types of langtap disease, namely one hot and one cold type, one due to disturbed internal “small animals” and one caused by “infectious fever” (nyenrim, gnyan rims).\n\n121 Bye ba ring bsrel 106/11, 417/13, Man ngag rin chen ’byung gnas 593/12.\n\n122 Bye ba ring bsrel 106/11, ’Bum khu tshur 365/19, Man ngag rin chen ’byung gnas 248/6, 593/12, 597/1 (...)\n\n123 bse sbur ni nag gseb dri can te / sbu lam pa zhes kyang bya’o / bying bying thu lu ni rdzib ci zho (...)\n\n124 Kletter & Kriechbaum 2001, p. 349.\n\n125 zi ldi spur thal pha ma’i skra gzhob bzhi / byis pa'i chur sbyangs btang bas sel bar ’gyur, rGyud b (...)\n\n126 yang na zi ldir dang sbur ba gnyis nus ldan bsregs thal dang phru gu’i pha ma’i skra gzhob bzhi byi (...)\n\n127 bse sbur zhes pa bse dri mnan pa’i sbur gyis gnyan tshad sel zhing byis pa’i lte mkhrang la phan / (...)\n\n32Although Yutok Yönten Gönpo provides the aforementioned instructions for the medicinal use of sebur, he does not mention sebur in the section of the Four Tantras that describes the treatment for “colic” (langtap). Despite this absence, the healing potential of sebur described in the twentieth chapter of the Explanatory Tantras is also known in other medical treatises. Reviewing them, it becomes obvious that sebur can be used to treat a range of similar diseases, which are characterized by abdominal pain, indigestion, and sin diseases (srin nad), among others. It seems that some commentators on the Four Tantras were also aware of the discrepancy between the twentieth chapter of the Explanatory Tantras and the treatment for “colic”. Therefore, some qualify the use of sebur by stating that it heals “colics” caused by “small animals” and “infectious fever”. Sangyé Gyamtso also provides a creative interpretation, for he dismisses the notion that sebur cures “colics” at all, and instead opines that it heals a certain type of fever called nyentsé (gnyan tshad) (Fig. 4). Nyentsé should be understood as inflammation with an increase of temperature at the affected part, and it remains unknown how he found this healing potential. Moreover, Sangyé Gyamtso states that sebur can be used when childen have “stiff navel” disease, much like zindira mentioned above. In the corresponding paragraph of the Four Tantras, in the chapter on pediatric diseases in the Instructional Tantra, a remedy for a “stiff navel” is described that is comprised of four ingredients: namely zindi, beetle ash, and the singed hair of the father and mother, which are all to be cleansed in the child’s urine. Sangyé Gyamtso interprets “zindi and beetle ash” as ashes of both zindi and beetles, the latter of which he interprets as the “stink beetle” (sebur). Therefore he dismisses the healing potential of sebur as a treatment for “colics”, as given by Yutok Yönten Gönpo, and recommends sebur for treating “the stiff navel of children” instead. Some later doctors, such as Yeshé Penjor (Ye shes dpal ’byor, 1704-1788), agree and supplement traditional healing potentials found in the Four Tantras in a similar fashion.\n\nJingjing tulu (bying bying thu lu)\n\n128 bying bying thu lu ni/ ’ga’ zhig sbrang bur ’dod pa dang / ’ga’ zhig dmar nag rkyal ba la ’dod pa s (...)\n\n129 bying bying thu lu ni rdzib ci zho la zhes kyang bya ste / sbur khog dri can rgyab yol yod pa lta b (...)\n\n130 bying bying thu lu ste ming gshog mo rdza log ces pa gshog pa’i rnam pa can yod med gnyis yong ba d (...)\n\n131 bying bying thu lu ni ’bu mjug ma ra gnyis yod pa’i rgyab gnyer ma can leb mo de yin, Si tu sMan ng (...)\n\n132 bying bying thu lu ni ’bu mjug la rwa gnyis yod pa’i rgyab gnyer ma can leb mo de yin, mKhas pa’i z (...)\n\n133 bying bying thu lu ni / rdzib rdzib / zhol spur ba zer / bse ’bur nas che sgor mo rkang drug ’dab m (...)\n\n134 For references, see appendix.\n\n33The beetle known as jingjing tulu is described variously by different Tibetan authors. Namgyel Drakpa Zangpo, for example, writes that some authors maintain that jingjing tulu are bees, while others say they are dark red insects that can swim. He is of the opinion that jingjing tulu are actually the same as zindira (zi ldi ra). Kyempa Tsewang explains that they are beetles, which smell and have a hard shell on their backs. Lozang Chödrak states that there are at least two types: some have wings, and some do not. Chökyi Jungné (Chos kyi ’byung gnas, 1699/1700-1774) describes the jingjing tulu as an insect with a tail and two antennae, with a flat and wrinkly back. Trashibum and Troru Tsenam (Khro ru Tshe rnam, 1926-2004) agree with him and give the same description. Jampel Dorjé provides a divergent opinion, however. He states that jingjing tulu is bigger than the sebur beetle and is of a globular shape. They have six feet, have wings, and are able to fly. He also claims that they roll human faeces into round balls and carry them to their den (Figs 4, 8). From these descriptions, it becomes clear that different Tibetan doctors held different opinions regarding the appearance of the jingjing tulu insect. These different opinions have also influenced the identifications made in the modern academy, for some scholars think that the jingjing tulu is a dung beetle, while others write that it is a stink bug. A third group identifies the jingjing tulu as a wingless cockroach.\n\n135 bse sbur bying bying thu lus glang thabs ’joms, rGyud bzhi 75/11.\n\n136 Zla ba’i rgyal po 167/17.\n\n137 Man ngag rin chen ’byung gnas 248/7.\n\n138 rGyud bzhi 329/4.\n\n34When listing materia medica and their healing potentials in the twentieth chapter of the Explanatory Tantra, Yutok Yönten Gönpo names sebur and jingjing tulu together as having the potential to cure the langtap disease, or “colics”. Similar to sebur, however, jingjing tulu is not mentioned in the corresponding paragraphs of the Instructional Tantra. In other words, such a healing potential is maintained in the Explanatory Tantra but not actually recommended in the Instructional Tantra. Also much like the case of sebur, medicinal prescriptions of jingjing tulu are also known in other medical treatises. For instance, jingjing tulu is a part of a drug compound that is used to cure “colics” in the King of the Moon treatise. The jingjing tulu beetle occurs six times in the Ten Million Instructions: Relics written by Nyamnyi Dorjé, and in five cases it prescribed to alleviate “colics”. Jampel Chökyi Tendzin Trinlé also mentions jingjing tulu for the same medicinal purpose in his A Jewel Mine of Instructions. Furthermore, this beetle is also employed to cure patients having difficulties with urinating, as explained in the fifty-fourth chapter of the Instructional Tantra.\n\nChubur (chu sbur)\n\n139 sdig srin chu sbur gnyis kyis chu ’gags sel, rGyud bzhi 75/11.\n\n140 Shel gong shel phreng 421/5.\n\n141 sbur mgyogs ni chu nang du myur du rgyud pa’i sbur chung nag po ste chu sbur zhes so, bDud rtsi sgr (...)\n\n142 chu sbur ni / ljon mo myur mgyogs rta zer / bai sngon las / chu nang du myur bar ’gro ba’i sbur chu (...)\n\n143 The Mongolian term is qoruqai sinayan, the Manchu is koki,and the Chinese is kēdǒu (蝌蚪).\n\n144 One scholar gives a family of water beetles.

Its name literally means “water beetle”, and sometimes it is also called the “quick beetle” (burgyok, sbur mgyogs). Usually it is described as a small black beetle that moves quickly in water (Fig. 4), and Jampel Dorjé adds that it develops from rain water and transforms into a small frog when it gets old. It is also called “one life two bodies” and the “frog with a tail”, because later it is said to become a frog (Fig. 11). Thus, it is obvious that Jampel Dorjé has conflated two animals: a beetle and a frog that is in its larval stage of a tadpole. The names in Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese also are terms for tadpole. Modern scholars usually identify chubur as a water beetle, and, as mentioned above, it is usually prescribed for patients who have difficulties urinating. It occurs in a remedy to treat an illness characterised by acute pain and urinary problems. In addition, it can also be found in the chapters of the Four Tantras dealing with the treatment for “compounded poison” (jarduk, sbyar dug) and of “non-poisonous substances that have turned into poison” (gyurduk, gyur dug). Sangyé Gyamtso provides another special application of the beetle for gently cleansing diseases of the “channels”. Regardless, it seems that its basic use was for removing problems with the flow of urine, as the treatise of Jampel Chökyi Tendzin Trinlé indicates.\n\nJangpa (byang pa)\n\n148 For references, see appendix.\n\n149 ming gzhan padme zhes so, bDud rtsi sgron me 276/12, ming gzhan pad me’u dang rgya nag me lce ’khor (...)\n\n150 Zin thig yang thig 502/14, rGyud bzhi’i rtsa ‘grel 186/1, bDud rtsi sgron me 276/12, sKyem pa Tshe (...)\n\n151 byang ba nag khra kun la dug yod pas spang ngo, ’Bum khu tshur 289/11, rigs ni nag dmar ser po khra (...)\n\n152 nag po gsum dang dmar khra bdun mnyam / dmar khra bdun dang ser khra bcu gcig mnyam pas bzang ngan (...)\n\n36The jangpa beetle is generally identified in modern literature as a blister beetle, Mylabris phalerata Pallas or Mylabris cichorii Fabricius. The jangpa beetle has various alternative names in Tibetan, however, such as pemé (padme), “Chinese wheel of fire tongues”, “small tiger lotus”, “golden Mongolian cushion”, “red striped small tiger”, “hero of women diseases”, and others. Traditionally Tibetan doctors have classified the beetles as black or black striped, red striped, and gold striped (Figs 4, 13). They are said to possess a varying degree of quality, beginning with the black one, which has a superior quality; the black and red striped ones, which have a medium quality; and the golden striped one, which has an inferior quality. Some doctors were of the opinion that one should not use the first type, the black one, because it is poisonous. The black jangpa is not used by Yutok Yönten Gönpo in the Four Tantras, for example, and consequently many treatises just distinguish between two types of jangpa beetles: namely the red striped ones and the gold striped ones. The former is said to be of good quality and the latter of poor quality. This order of potency also found its expression in the number of insect equivalents. Sönam Yeshé Gyemtsen, for example, writes that three black beetles are equivalent to seven red striped beetles, and seven red striped beetles equal eleven gold striped beetles.\n\n153 Zin thig yang thig 502/19, ’Bum khu tshur 289/11, rGyud bzhi 624/16, Yid bzhin nor bu 96/17, Bye ba (...)\n\n154 la la mgo lag ’dreg [’breg] zer te / mgo lag med na gang med kyi / nad mi ’grangs [’drongs] pas mi (...)\n\n155 byang pa mgo rkang chad na nad ’drongs chung, rGyud bzhi 624/17.\n\n156 dmar khra bar gshog ldan pa nyi shu gcig / gshog dkar phral na rno myur ga la srid, Bye ba ring bsr (...)\n\n157 rje g.yu thog pa’i shog dril skor gsum las sbyong gi sde tshan skor du / sug smel gyis pho ba’i gzh (...)\n\n37These equivalencies also vary according to which part of the body of the beetles is being used. It is also usually said that the inner transparent wings should be removed, as they contain poison. Regardless, Darma Gönpo (Darma mgon po, fl. 13th century) writes that some doctors say that one should cut off the head and the legs of the jangpa beetle. He remarks that, in his opinion, one should not cut them off, however, because if the have no head and legs they cannot pull out whatever disease they are being used to treat. This opinion is shared by Yutok Yönten Gönpo in his Four Tantras. Nyamnyi Dorjé states that if the jangpa beetle is without wings, it will be sharp and quick. On a semantic level, using beetles to cleanse the “channels” can be understood as sending the beetles through the “channels” to pull out disease-causing agents. Mipam Gyamtso (Mi pham rgya mtsho, 1846-1912), for example, cites Yutok Yönten Gönpo in describing the jangpa beetle as driving the disease through the channels. This basic meaning may also be seen in a brief treatment for cleansing the “channels” contained in the Big Measure of Gold (gSer bre chen mo), which was probably compiled by Drangti Penden Gyeltsen (Brang ti dPal ldan rgyal mtshan, fl. 14th century). The treatment reads:\n\n158 It is likely that the “wheel of iron” is the secret name of an ingredient. As a note is not attache (...)\n\n159 shig khra gshog bor rnam pa (note: byang khra) bdun / sbur ’gyogs (note: ser po) gcig gi rta la bsk (...)\n\nSeven striped lice without wings (i.e. the striped jangpa beetle) ride on the (yellow) “quick beetle”, holding a wheel of iron (and) a club of conch-shell (i.e. sal ammoniac) in their hands, (and wearing) a hat of gold (i.e. fresh sand), finely ground. One should give (this compound) with beer through a younger male relative.\n\n160 Zla ba’i rgyal po 232/12.\n\n161 gSung sgros 19/1.\n\n162 Zin thig yang thig 501/1.\n\n163 For these and the following schools, see Desi Sangyé Gyatso 2010.\n\n164 gSer bre chen mo I 297/2, gSer bre chen mo II 209/13, dNgul bre ma 174/1.\n\n165 Yid bzhin nor bu 96/7, Bye ba ring bsrel 110/6, 121/7, 195/10.\n\n166 bDud rtsi’i thigs pa 484/4.\n\n167 For a translation of Yönten Gönpo’s treatment, see Dašiev 2001, pp. 617ff, Yonten Gonpo 2011b, pp. (...)\n\n38One can probably assume that such compounds, which contained a manageable number of ingredients, were more common than the very elaborate treatments outlined in the Subsequent Tantra. Reviewing the medical literature, one finds several instances where the jangpa beetle was used to cleanse the “channels”, and it is mentioned several times in this regard as early as the King of the Moon treatise. Sönam Rinchen (bSod nams rin chen, 1079-1153) sees jangpa beetles as an important ingredient in drugs used to cleanse the “channels”. Darma Gönpo gives a very detailed discussion that should be compared to the Yönten Gönpo’s description in the Subsequent Tantra. Jangpa beetle prescriptions are also found in the collection of medical treatises named A Fist of Hundred Thousands (’Bum khu tshur) that mainly consists of works recorded by Chakmen Ringyel (Phyag sman Rin rgyal, ca. 15th century). Both treatises represent lineages of knowledge that was handed down in the Cherjé (Cher rje) and Chakmen (Phyag sman) medical schools, respectivly. The same can be said about the Drangti (Brang ti) school, for in addition to the aforementioned formula attributed to Penden Gyeltsen, compounds containing jangpa beetles can also be found in the The Measure of Silver (dNgul bre) that was probably authored by Dorjé Pelzang (Rdo rje dpal bzang), who flourished during the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 15th century, the cleansing of the “channels” by jangpa beetles is also found in the medical writings of Namgyel Drakpa Zangpo and Nyamnyi Dorjé. These works clearly represent the traditions of later medical schools, the Jangluk (Byang lugs) and the Zurluk (Zur lugs), respectively. Cleansing the “channels” with jangpa beetles was also known in later times, as the works of Yeshé Penjor show. Thus, it is obvious that this therapy was of great importance for generations of Tibetan doctors.\n\n168 Zin thig yang thig 502/11.\n\n169 rGyud bzhi 624/13, ’Bum khu tshur 289/8, Zin thig yang thig 502/11, Nyi ma'i snying po 916/12.\n\n170 The sema plant belongs to various genera, mainly Astragalus,Oxytropis, and Hedysarum. The kyiwa pl (...)\n\n171 It seems that some authors identify this with Isodon rubescens, but most states that it is Artemisi (...)\n\n39Instead of providing an overview of cleansing the “channels”, however, here we shall consider how a doctor decided whether a jangpa beetle is of good or poor quality. It seems that this method can be traced back to Jinamitra, possibly the father of Kyebu Melha (Skyes bu Me lha, fl. 11th century). There are four criteria that are considered in this process: namely (1) the type of jangpa beetle, (2) the season in which they were collected, (3) the locality, and (4) the way in which they were killed, all of which are addressed by Yutok Yönten Gönpo, Darma Gönpo, the anonymous author whose work is included in the A Fist of Hundred Thousands, and Tendzin Püntsok. As mentioned above, beetles that have red stripes are of good quality, but if they have gold stripes, they are considered to be of poor quality. The best time to collect jangpa beetles is autumn, the first month of autumn in particular, when the rainy season has ended. They should be collected among the sema plant (srad ma) and the thorns of the kyiwa plant (skyi ba), especially if they have died suddendly. If one collects beetles at the end of spring and during the rainy season, when they have been frozen following the rains, they are of poor quality. The same applies to beetles living among the leaves of the yokmo shrub (yog mo) and that have died naturally or have been injured.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\n172 The only exception is a recent article by Sabernig. She provides quantitative data on the use of fo (...)\n\n40It is evident that animals and their by-products were an integral part of Tibetan medicine, even though it is not possible to provide a precise quantitative analysis. For this, one would have to carry out a survey of the Tibetan materia medica that are used in drugs and other therapies. This is by no means the only unresolved issue in our current knowledge of the use of animals in Tibetan medicine.\n\n173 A good example is the identification of the horse in Tibetan medicine. Some modern Tibetan authors (...)\n\n41Certainly, one must also critically question the currently available publications on Tibetan materia medica, for they are generally not based on appropriate studies of materia medica terminology. Some authors just copy identifications that are given in previous works, and very often the proposed Western identification is influenced by or borrowed from the established identification of Chinese materia medica. This does not just concern insects studied in this article but concerns animals used in Tibetan medicine in general.\n\n174 See Eidmann 1941, Dlussky 1965, Bharti 2008, Thapa 2000, pp. 70ff., Pfeiffer et al. 2006, Bayartogt (...)\n\n175 Narsu & Stuart 1988, p. 8, Ding et al. 1997, pp. 215f., He & Li 2003, Costa-Neto 2005, pp. 102f., G (...)\n\n176 For example, Namba states that cicada nymph skin can be used for infantile convulsions, Namba et al (...)\n\n42In some cases, the actual existence of the proposed animal or insect and its medicinal application remains unclear and more information would be necessary for proper identification. This applies to the zhobur insect, for example, as well as the trumembu. The use of ants also needs further inquiry, for although ants populate the Himalayan regions, Tibet, and Mongolia, further research would be needed to determine which species are used and whether ants are indeed used by Tibetan doctors at all. It is known that ants are used for medicinal purpose in regions adjacent to Tibet, however, such as Mongolia and China. A thorough comparision of the insects used in the Chinese medical tradition could help elucidate the insects that are used in Tibetan medicines. Such research would go well beyond the scope of this preliminary study, however, as it would require the analysis of compounded drugs, and not just single ingredients, based on a systematic survey of the relevant Chinese medical sources. Thus, it might be interesting to see which butterflies, or more likely their catarpillars, were used in Chinese medicine to treat stomach diseases. Also, the use of the cicada slough for paediatric ailments and other illnesses should be analysed in future research. Possibly these very specific applications of insects in Tibetan medicine could demonstrate a Chinese influence in the medical system of the neighbouring country.\n\n177 Zhang & Guo 2011, Zhang & Liu 2014.\n\n178 da ni rgya nag tong kun rgyal bo’i gdams pa, Bye ba ring bsrel 374/6.

In modern Chinese medicine, one of the medicinal applications of Aspongopus chinensis Dallas alias Coridius chinensis Dallas (九香蟲) can be to alleviate stomach pain and treat gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, the use of the shadrang fly appears to have a Chinese background, for it seems that there is no use in the Tibetan medical tradition other than as an ingredient for “restoring virility”. Notably, Nyamnyi Dorjé states that this particular remedy represents the instructions of the king of the eastern capital in China. In other words, such uses of the shadrang fly might be a Chinese remedy that was integrated into Tibetan medicine. Insects such as horseflies are well-known in Chinese medicine and are the subject of current academic research. Perhaps there also is a Chinese background for the medicinal use of the jangpa beetle in Tibet, but it could also be a feature that has not been borrowed, but is shared by both medical systems. In sum, the number of medicinal insects in Tibetan medicine is limited, and their uses are very specific. Perhaps this degree of specificity indicates origins and influences from neighbouring medical traditions.\n\nFigure 1.
