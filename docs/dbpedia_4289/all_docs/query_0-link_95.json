        "text": "This study reported the ant species that were recovered from monkey carcasses in three different ecological habitats in Malaysia. The study was conducted from 9 May - 10 October 2007, 6 May - 6 August 2008 and 26 May - 14 July 2009 in forested area (Gombak, Selangor), coastal area (Tanjong Sepat, Selangor) and highland area (Bukit Cincin, Pahang), respectively. Monkey carcass was used as a model for human decomposition in this study. A total of 4 replicates were used in each of the study sites. Ants were observed to prey on eggs, larvae, pupae and newly emerged flies. This study found that ant species could be found at all stages of decomposition, indicating that ants were not a significant indicator for faunal succession. However, different species of ants were obtained from monkey carcasses placed in different ecological habitats. Cardiocondyla sp. was only found on carcasses placed in the coastal area; while Pheidole longipes, Hypoponera sp. and Pachycondyla sp. were solely found...\n\nLaos is one of the most undersampled areas for ant biodiversity. We begin to address this knowledge gap by presenting the first checklist of Laotian ants. The list is based on a literature review and on specimens collected from several localities in Laos. In total, 123 species with three additional subspecies in 47 genera belonging to nine subfamilies are listed, including 62 species recorded for the first time in the country. Comparisons with neighboring countries suggest that this list is still very incomplete. The provincial distribution of ants within Laos also show that most species recorded are from Vientiane Province, the central part of Laos while the majority of other provinces have received very little, if any, ant sampling. Many ant specimens collected from Laos are awaiting identification and future collections should provide many new species records. Keywords: Formicidae, ants, checklist, new records, Laos\n\nKnowing the importance of participation by insects at cadaverous decomposition processes, and the limited use of the family Formicidae in criminal investigations, this study aims to record the foraging activity of four genera of ants in carcasses of birds and mammals. Observations occurred accidentally in two locations in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In total, seven species of ants foraging in eight vertebrate carcasses were recorded. In addition, the study reported for the first time the presence of Wasmannia in carcasses in Brazil.\n\nThe present study is a first study of the diversity of subterranean ants in Sumatra Island, Indonesia. Subterranean probes and traps were used to collect ants at Educational and Biological Research Forest (EBRF), Universitas Andalas, Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of ten species of ant [Hypoponera truncata (F. Smith, 1860); Lophomyrmex bedoti Emery, 1893; Odontomachus minangkabau Satria et al., 2015; Odontoponera denticulata (F. Smith, 1858); Pheidole aristotelis Forel, 1911; Pheidole sp. 1 of HH; Pheidole sp. 3 of HH; Pheidole sp. 12 of HH; Pristomyrmex bicolor (Emery, 1900); Selenopsis geminata (Fabricius, 1804)] that belonging to two subfamilies, seven genera and 330 individuals was collected. The subfamily Myrmicinae was the highest number of species which were dominated by Lophomyrmex bedoti and Pheidole sp. 1 of HH in the number of individual. These two species was found at every level of four level of soil depth. The subterranean probes were collected more species of ants than t..."
