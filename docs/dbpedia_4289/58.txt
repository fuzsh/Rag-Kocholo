The influence of food supplement on the home ranges of three colonies of the ant Formica (Serviformica) japonica was studied by the group-marking method in a grassland in spring and autumn, 1992,in Nara, western Japan. When bait (honey syrup) was supplied at one place in the home range of one colony, the neighboring colonies expanded their home ranges toward the bait site within a few days both in spring and autumn. With the food supplement in autumn, the home range of a colony which included the bait site diminished in size, but overlap of home ranges of neighboring colonies expanded to some degree. Thus, the sizes and the degree of overlap of home ranges of individual colonies of F. japonica were changed by the food supply.

Stand structure and growth dynamics of a mixed forest in the Shiretoko National Park were investigated in two plots of 1600 m2 between 1989 and 1993. The stand was dominated by a conifer, Abies sachalinensis, and the hardwood species Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata. The size structure of both groups showed inverse J-shaped distributions. The diameter growth of the coniferous and hardwood species was independent of size. Tree death in hardwood species occurred in small size classes (diameter at breast height, DBH<10 cm), whereas various size classes of coniferous species were affected. The effect of upper tree density (one-sided competitive effect) on the absolute growth rates of conifer trees was significant over a wide range of size classes (0<DBH<15 cm), but this was not the case for hardwood trees, except in the intermediate size classes (5<DBH<10 cm) of the subcanopy layer. A matrix model simulation showed that the size structure dynamics of conifer and hardwood species was governed mainly by a one-sided density effect, and by recruitment of seedlings or saplings, respectively.

The clonal growth of a rhizomatous perennial herb, Epimedium sempervirens, was investigated on three different forest floors : oak (Quercus serrata), pine (Pinus densiflora) and cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). Several 1Ã—1 m^2 quadrats were located on each forest floor, and leaf area and length of new rhizomes produced by all shoots of E. sempervirens were examined. On the floor of the oak forest, the population was composed chiefly of small genets with few intraclonal ramets. On the other hand, on the floors of the pine and the cedar forests, the populations were made up mainly of fewer, but larger genets. The ratios of the numbers of long to short rhizomes of E. sempervirens differed conspicuously in the pine and the cedar forests, and were lower in the latter. In the oak forest population these ratios varied markedly among quadrats. Except for small shoots, no significant correlation was recognized between leaf area of the parent shoots and length of new rhizomes, nor between leaf area and the ratios of long rhizomes.
