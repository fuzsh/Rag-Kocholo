        "text": "i am considering to buy a MF digital camera back? it's a bit\n\ndifficult for me to digest all the information that manufacturer's\n\nspew out. is there anyone out there who has a made a\n\ncomparison between the sinar, the leaf and the phase one\n\nbacks and can give me an unbiased opinion about the\n\nadvantages/disadvantages of these backs relative to each\n\nother? in talking to the sales people for these backs, what is the\n\nmost important piece of information that I need to find out about\n\nthese backs: CCD size? micron size? about its software? I do\n\nquite a bit of location work so what would be the most\n\ncompatible back for both studio and location as well?\n\ni have mamiya 645af (w/c will need to be upgraded to an AFD), a\n\nRZ67 and a Toyo 4x5. Ideally, I would like to have a digital back\n\ncompatible with all three. Is there one?\n\nNinfa\n\nHi Ninfa,\n\nI haven't got either of the backs..\n\nbut have been asking the same questions myself...\n\nI recently saw a studio in Manilla, Philipines where the guy was\n\nusing a Phase One back... he had two.. the original that came\n\nout and the second version. The diff. between the two is the\n\nscanning rate I guess.\n\nHe did primarily ad work.. table top stuff.. but involved set ups...\n\nlike breaking 'tidal waves' of juice for a drink co. - he said he was\n\nso pleased with the first Phase One that he bought a second\n\none as all the guys in his studio were always fighting over who\n\ngot to use it. He said the second version had a faster scanning\n\nrate that made it even better and that he preferred it over the\n\nSinar back because of this.\n\nThough don't know if it this'll work for a fast fashion shoot - but\n\nthen again do models move faster than juice tidal waves? ;-)\n\nAnyhow, my anecdotal 2 cents.. will wait to hear the truly\n\nknowledged to chime in with hard numbers and facts.\n\ncheers,\n\nluc"
