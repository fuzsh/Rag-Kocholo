There really isn't a place for this thread, so here it be. I'm sitting here right now without a functional DSLR. My Canon 7D quit and, frankly, hasn't been as reliable as I'd want. Anyway, since then I've acquired a Mamiya 645AFD and am looking for a digital back for it. I'm torn between a Leaf Aptus (22mp model) or a Phase One P25 (also 22mp).\n\nPhase One Pros:\n\nIntegrated Battery, tougher construction, light, excellent image quality\n\nNegatives:\n\nExpensive, TINY screen, can't tether with my non-Firewire laptop\n\nLeaf pros:\n\nImage quality similar to that of the Phase, larger and infinitely better screen, less expensive\n\nNegatives:\n\nBattery hangs below and doesn't look overly stable, open fan port (no shooting in ANY kind of inclement weather-I like shooting in snowstorms), still can't tether, looks a little more fragile than the Phase One.\n\nOK, there it is. If these were your options, which would you choose, and if you can, tell me why? I've been agonizing over this decision for too long now.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nminicoop1985\n\nBeen spending a lot of time on here!\n\nJoined\n\nSep 3, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n5,520\n\nReaction score\n\n1,865\n\nLocation\n\nAppleton, WI\n\nCan others edit my Photos\n\nPhotos OK to edit\n\nJan 27, 2016\n\n#2\n\nWelp, I've made up my mind.

You say you can tether because of the firewire. Can't you find an adapter from (I assume) USB to firewire to make this happen?\n\n480sparky\n\nChief Free Electron Relocator\n\nJoined\n\nMar 8, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n25,196\n\nReaction score\n\n9,034\n\nLocation\n\nIowa\n\nWebsite\n\npixels.com\n\nCan others edit my Photos\n\nPhotos NOT OK to edit\n\nJan 27, 2016\n\n#4\n\nLemme throw a wrench into the gears here.\n\nWhat about shooting film and scanning the negs?\n\nronlane\n\nWhat's next?\n\nJoined\n\nAug 3, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n10,224\n\nReaction score\n\n4,961\n\nLocation\n\nMustang Oklahoma\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.lane-images.com\n\nCan others edit my Photos\n\nPhotos OK to edit\n\nJan 27, 2016\n\n#5\n\nLemme throw a wrench into the gears here.\n\nWhat about shooting film and scanning the negs?\n\nWhat????????

Because of my scanning situation, my film work tends not to be as precise. And no, apparently there is no such thing as a true Firewire to USB adapter. So tethering will not be an option unless I somehow win the lottery and come up with the cash to get a Credo or IQ.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nminicoop1985\n\nBeen spending a lot of time on here!\n\nJoined\n\nSep 3, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n5,520\n\nReaction score\n\n1,865\n\nLocation\n\nAppleton, WI\n\nCan others edit my Photos\n\nPhotos OK to edit\n\nJan 28, 2016\n\n#8\n\nI HAVE MADE THE DECISION!
