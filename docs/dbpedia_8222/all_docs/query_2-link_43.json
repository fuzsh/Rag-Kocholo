The LeafGuard gutter system revolutionized the industry by providing an innovative one-piece system for residential and commercial application, with a lifetime, clog-free guarantee. Today, the LeafGuard brand continues to be a trusted source for quality and reliability, backed by the Good Housekeeping seal.\n\nEnglert's LeafGuard brand is available through a national network of authorized dealers, and supported by Englert, Inc., the pioneer of on-site custom fitted, seamless gutters since 1966."
