        "text": "Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) Minister Andrew Muir has today launched Phase one of the Lough Neagh: Blue-Green Algae Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI).\n\nThe Lough Neagh: Blue-Green Algae SBRI is being developed to explore potential solutions to treat and reduce Blue-Green Algae blooms without impacting the natural environment of Lough Neagh and associated Northern Ireland water ways.\n\nThe SBRI has two phases and will be expected to follow the standard approach:\n\nPhase one: Five applicants selected to develop proof of concepts. A total funding package of £450k has been secured via DAERA and the Department for the Economy (DfE) through its SBRI Challenge Fund for Phase one; and\n\nPhase two: Two to three concepts selected and developed as potential pilot solutions.\n\nMinister Muir said: “I am pleased to announce the launch of Phase one of the Lough Neagh: Blue-Green Algae Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI), supported by funding from both my Department and the Department for the Economy.”\n\n“We all have a responsibility to work collectively to deliver sustainable solutions to address the issues facing Lough Neagh and to return it to its rightful state as an ecological jewel at the heart of Northern Ireland.\n\n“I understand that this SBRI initiative will not fully address the Blue-Green Algae problems, however it will contribute, along with the other actions contained in the Lough Neagh report, to help deliver my vision to have a healthy, resilient environment with high water quality status and environment standards thereby contributing to the health and wellbeing of our citizens.”\n\nMinister Muir added: “Whilst much attention has been devoted to the issues with BGA in Lough Neagh I am equally focussed on water quality issues across Northern Ireland and this work will hopefully provide solutions that can be applied to any area that has been affected by the emergence of BGA.”\n\nEconomy Minister Conor Murphy said: “My Department’s SBRI Challenge Fund supports the development of innovative solutions to complex public policy challenges. Lough Neagh is a vital asset for the local community and for the north as a whole so it is welcome that the fund will be used to formulate a solution to the Blue-Green Algae in Lough Neagh.”\n\nThere is scope for physical, chemical or biological, or a combination of solutions, but whatever solution is developed it must not contribute to further environmental degradation. It must also comply with legislation and environmental designations.\n\nThe application window for Phase one is open for six weeks. Applications must be received by 3pm on Friday 13th September.\n\nIt is anticipated that Phase one will run through to March 2025 with a potential call for a phase two applications commencing summer 2025.\n\nAnyone wishing to apply can do so at https://sdi.click/sbrinibga1\n\nA supplier information event will be held online on Wednesday 14th August for anyone wishing to obtain more details. Registration is required and is available at\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lough-neagh-blue-green-algae-phase-1-sbri-information-event-tickets-964869048297\n\nNotes to editors:\n\n1.SBRI competitions have a three-phase structure:\n\ni. Phase 1 is intended to show the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the proposed concept;\n\nii. Phase 2 is intended to develop and evaluate prototypes or demonstrators from the more promising technologies identified in Phase 1 through feasibility trialling; and\n\niii. Phase 3 allows for a period of extended testing for the most promising potential solutions, where this is desirable.\n\n2.The competition process is being managed on behalf of DAERA by SBRI, part of the Strategic Investment Board (SIB) and DAERA is the contracting body in this procurement.\n\n3. At the end of Phase 1, all, or a subset only of the suppliers in Phase 1 may be selected to proceed to later phases, based on agreed objective selection criteria and budget availability.\n\n4. At the conclusion of the SBRI contract, or at any other time, the contracting authority may decide to procure the solution(s) developed or similar solution(s) from other providers - but there is no obligation to do so. If a solution is to be procured, this will constitute a separate competition under normal public procurement rules and other potential suppliers on the open market will be free to compete for the business.\n\n5. DAERA contributed £200k with DfE contributing £250k through its SBRI Challenge Fund.\n\n6.Follow DAERA on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook\n\n7. All media queries should be directed to the DAERA Press Office: pressoffice.group@daera.ni.gov.uk or telephone 02890 163460.\n\n8. The Executive Information Service operates an out of hours service for media enquiries only between 1800hrs and 0800hrs Monday to Friday and at weekends and public holidays. The duty press officer can be contacted on 028 9037 8110.\n\nShare this page"
