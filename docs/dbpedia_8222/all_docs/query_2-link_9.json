        "text": "Stomata are small openings on plant leaves and young stems that allow for gas exchange with the atmosphere. Each stoma is surrounded by a pair of kidney-shaped guard cells that control the opening and closing of the pore. There are several types of stomata defined by the number and arrangement of neighboring subsidiary cells. The document discusses the definition, distribution, size, positioning and six main types (anomocytic, anisocytic, paracytic, diacytic, gramineous, and coniferous) of stomata found across plant species."
