        "text": "1. STOMATA Mrs. R. H. Mishal Incharge HOD, D. Pharm Sir Dr. M. S. Gosavi College of Pharmaceutical Education & Research, Nashik.\n\n2. A stoma is a minute epidermal opening with following characteristics: • A central cell • Two kidney shaped similar cells containing chloroplasts known as Guard cells and varying number of subsidiary (epidermal) cells covering the guard cells. A stoma is made up of a pair of identical guard cells, forming a pore in centre through which gaseous exchange takes place. STOMATA\n\n4. There are 4 basic types of stomata among the dicotyledons. These types are distinguished on the basis of arrangements of the subsidiary cells surrounding the stomata The four types are: • Anomocytic type, Ranunculaceae • Anisocytic type, Curciferae • Paracytic type, Rubiceae • Diacytic type, Caryophyllaceae\n\n5. The surrounding epidermal cells have no special arrangement, they are all similar & there are no subsidiary cells, so all the cells are normal epidermal cells without any modification, like stomata of digitalis.\n\n6. The stomata is surrounded subsidiary cells, one of them by 3 or more is distinctly Hyoscymus smaller that the others like in niger.\n\n7. Each stoma is surrounded by 2 or more subsidiary cells, 2 of them have their long axes parallel to the pore, which means that the axes of the subsidiary cells are parallel to the axes of the pore like the one in senna leaves.\n\n8. Each stomata is surrounded by 2 subsidiary cells having their long axes perpendicular to the pore like in peppermint, Mentha piper.\n\n10. Paracytic or Rubiaceous or parallel- celled stomata: Coca leaf, senna leaf Diacytic or caryophyllaceous or cross-celled stomata : Peppermint, Vasaka Anisocytic or cruciferous or Unequalcelled stomata: Belladona, Datura Anomocytic or ranunculaceous or irregular celled stomata: Digitalis, Lobelia"
