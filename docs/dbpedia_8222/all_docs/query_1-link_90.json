        "text": "i would like information about digital back for contax 645. while i\n\nsee many references to such, i can find very little information\n\nabout the subject. anyone have sources i can check?\n\nAll the major digital back manufacturers make digital backs that will fit the Contax 645, and plan to continue to do so.\n\n<p>\n\nTry,<br>\n\nPhase One: www.phaseone.com<br>\n\nLeaf Systems (now part of Kodak), wit the Leaf Aptus being thier latest offering: http://graphics.kodak.com/global/product/digital_photography/default.htm<br>\n\nSinar: http://www.sinar.ch/sinar/default.htm (find \"Digital\" under the \"Products\" heading on the menu), and<br>\n\nImacon: http://www.imacon.dk/sw2264.asp (recently merged with Hassleblad so don't expect too much support for your superior Contax.)\n\n<p>\n\nThese links should provide you with the detailed information you are looking for on the offerings from the main digital back manufacturers. Good luck.\n\n<I>((recently merged with Hassleblad so don't expect too much support for your superior\n\nContax.)</I><P>Why would you think that?. Hasselblad is perfectly happy to sell you a\n\n$20,000 back for a Contax. Hasselblad is a business, not someone on the Jerry Springer\n\nShow, they are perfectly happy to sell you a product they make.\n\nHaving shot pretty extensively with a Hasselblad H1 and a Contax 645 last year both with\n\ndigital backs, I just didn'yt see any superiority: the contax was heavier, went through\n\nbatteries dfaster and the autofocus of the Contax was much slower and no more accurate.\n\nThe lenses for the Contax were quite nice but only marginally (if at all) better than the\n\nlenses for\n\nthe H1. That didn't keep me from really liking using the Contax or thinking it was anything\n\nbut a great camera -- but superior? Nope.<P> I used both cameras with digital backs.\n\nThe\n\nbest buy, if you can find one, will be a Kodak DCs Proback 645C -- it has limitations --\n\nyoun eed to work at ISO 100 to160 and forget about exposures longer than 2 seconds --\n\nbuit for landscape and portrait work the (discontinued ---just like the Contax 645 -- bit\n\nfor different reasons) the Kodak 645 pro Backs are great. You should be able to find one\n\nfor $5K or less. Kodak's processing software is also terrific -- really better than Capture\n\nOne or Adobe Camera Raw"
