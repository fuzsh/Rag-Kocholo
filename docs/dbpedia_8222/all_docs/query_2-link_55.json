        "text": "Yahoo’s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon is a complicated beast, showing how different acquisition structures can affect how shareholders are treated.\n\nFirst, let’s say what the Yahoo sale is not. It is not a sale of the publicly traded company. Instead, it is a sale of the Yahoo subsidiary and some related assets to Verizon.\n\nThe sale is being done in two steps. The first step will be the transfer of any assets related to Yahoo business to a singular subsidiary. This includes the stock in the business subsidiaries that make up Yahoo that are not already in the single subsidiary, as well as the odd assets like benefit plan rights. This is what is being sold to Verizon. A license of Yahoo’s oldest patents is being held back in the so-called Excalibur portfolio. This will stay with Yahoo, as will Yahoo’s stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan.\n\nIt is hard to overestimate how complex an asset sale like this is. Some of the assets are self-contained, but they must be gathered up and transferred. Employees need to be shuffled around and compensation arrangements redone. Many contracts, like the now-infamous one struck with the search engine Mozilla, which may result in a payment of up to a $1 billion, will contain change-of-control provisions that will be set off and have to be addressed. Tax issues always loom large.\n\nIn the second step, at the closing, Yahoo will sell the stock in the single subsidiary to Verizon. At that point, Yahoo will change its name to something without “Yahoo” in it. My favorite is simply Remain Co., the name Yahoo executives are using. Remain Co. will become a holding company for the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stock. Included will also be $10 billion in cash, plus the Excalibur patent portfolio and a number of minority investments including Snapchat. Ahh, if only Yahoo had bought Snapchat instead of Tumblr (indeed, if only Yahoo had bought Google or Facebook when it had the chance).\n\nBecause it is a sale of a subsidiary, the $4.8 billion will be paid to Yahoo. Its shareholders will not receive any money unless Yahoo pays it out in a dividend (after paying taxes). Instead, Yahoo shareholders will be left holding shares in the renamed company.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
