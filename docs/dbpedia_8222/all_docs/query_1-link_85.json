Probably as they are from the time that Leaf was not part of Phase One. I think those also work with the AFDII. You can ask on the getdpi.com forum as well as there are more digital back users there than here.\n\nThanks. I've always found Phase One's website horrible to navigate. Looks like the best I can do would be a non-Phase One Leaf back if I do decide to add digital to this camera and want a full 645 image.\n\nMuch appreciate!\n\nThanks.

I have an IQ back + a AFD to try as well, I think that'll actually also work.\n\nA bit late, just saw the date of the OP and last reply, but maybe this will help someone else in future with the same questions.\n\nThe ZD back works with the AFDII (that's what I have). The RAW files work fine with Silkypix.\n\nI think some of the older backs need to be tethered, and may have specific cables and software.\n\nI would also check whether any updates would be needed to firmware, as that might prove diffcult.\n\nPhase One incidentally have a user forum and their technicians will do their best to help solve issues even with old unsupported kit."
