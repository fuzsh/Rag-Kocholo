        "text": "Stomata are small openings that mainly occur on the underside of leaves. They are surrounded by specialised cells and they regulate the gas exchange between the plant and it’s environment, the plant is 'breathing' through them, as it were. Stomata are very recognizable by the two kidney- or bean-shaped guard cells that regulate the size of the opening. The guard cells are specialised epidermal cells which contain vacuoles that change their shape when water is absorbed due to a process called turgor, causing the stomata to open. The stomata are opened by stimuli like high humidity and bright light. Depending on the plant family, guard cells are often surrounded by so-called subsidiary cells.\n\nAs for the morphology of stomata, some different shapes can be distinguished:\n\n● anomocytic: without subsidiary cells\n\n● paracytic: with lateral subsidiary cells oriented parallel with the guard cells\n\n● tetracytic: with both lateral and polar subsidiary cells\n\nStomata are fascinating objects to study, in each plant they look a bit different or are positioned differently. To observe stomata we need to peel off the epidermis from the underside of a leaf. If you tear a leaf apart, often a small piece of the epidermis will come off. Especially with thicker leaves this works quite well. Easy to begin with are the leaves of Hosta, Prunus laurocerasus (Cherry laurel) and Tradescantia.\n\nHostas are popular garden plants. In garden parks you will see them a lot. In the garden park where I have a house, they are also very popular with snails. There are almost no undamaged specimens to be found.\n\nThe hosta is a monocotyledonous plant native to East Asia. The epidermal cells are not very typical for a monocot plant and there are no subsidiary cells to be seen. The stomata morphology can therefore be labeled as anomocytic.\n\nA plant that has always fascinated me is the Tradescantia. This plant has large cells and stomata. When I started with a toy microscope a very long time ago, I observed Tradescantia a lot. At home we had several plants of what was then called Setcreasea purpurea. It’s present name is Tradescantia pallida, a plant native to Mexico. Tradescantia pallida you will find not that often in an average plant store, usually these stores have Tradescantia zebrina, at least in the Netherlands. The latter plant has shorter leaves and a striped pattern. On a microscopical level I could not see any difference between Tradescantia pallida and Tradescantia zebrina."
