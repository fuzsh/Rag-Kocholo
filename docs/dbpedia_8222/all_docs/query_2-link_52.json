        "text": "Finding holes in your plant leaves can be frustrating, especially when you don't know why those holes appeared. But don't worry. Hole-causing pests — from insects to diseases — leave clues to help you determine who's to blame. By learning about potential offenders and the holes they cause, you can stop leaf holes and protect your plants.\n\nHoles From Slugs and Snails\n\nHoles From Caterpillars\n\nHoles From Chewing Insects\n\nHoles From Sucking Insects\n\nHoles From Fungal Diseases\n\nHealthy Plants and Leaves\n\nHoles From Slugs and Snails\n\nSlugs and snails belong to a class of animals known as \"gastropods.\" Roughly translated, that scientific name means \"stomach-foot.\" If these voracious pests hit your garden, you understand the name suits them well. If you find holes in leaves but no bugs, visit your garden with a flashlight at night. That's when slugs and snails do their dirty work.\n\nSlugs and snails chew leaf holes in many plant types, including hibiscus, hosta, basil, cabbage, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers and pepper plants. Leaf holes from slugs and snails offer these clues:\n\nHoles are large and irregular in shape.\n\nHole edges are relatively smooth.\n\nHoles appear toward leaf centers, not edges.\n\nTrails of silvery slime lead to and from plants.\n\nSlug and snail control: Slugs and snails aren't insects, so insecticides don't control these pests. You can get rid of slugs and snails and stop the damage fast with Corry's Slug & Snail Killer ready-to-use pellets. People and pets can reenter treated areas immediately.\n\nSnails and slugs make irregular holes away from leaf edges.\n\nHoles From Caterpillars\n\nCaterpillars are the larvae of moths and butterflies. A diverse group, these hole-making pests range from tiny inchworms to hornworms 4 inches long. Some types are nocturnal; others feed around the clock. In addition to leaves, these pests often chew on other plant parts, including stems, roots, buds, flowers and fruits.\n\nIn their many forms, caterpillars target all types of plants, from roses and hydrangeas to basil, broccoli, cabbage, tomatoes, peppers and more. Holes in leaves from caterpillars provide these hints:\n\nHoles vary in size.\n\nHole edges are rough.\n\nHoles appear at leaf edges and leaf centers.\n\nLots of dark fecal droppings are nearby.\n\nCaterpillar control: To stop leaf damage from caterpillars, spot-treat individual pests or plants with Sevin Ready to Use. For larger areas, try Sevin Insect Killer Concentrate or Sevin Insect Killer Ready to Spray. People and pets can reenter the area when sprays dry.\n\nLeaf damage intensifies when caterpillars come in multiples.\n\nHoles From Chewing Insects\n\nCaterpillars are chewing insects, but their leaf holes end with adulthood. Plenty of other chewing insects continue their damage as adults. Chewing insects eat leaves and make holes by biting or tearing leaves and grinding them with their tooth-like mandibles.\n\nFew plants — or plant parts — are safe from damage by chewing insects. Day-feeding Japanese beetles skeletonize the leaves of hundreds of plant species. Earwigs and other chewing pests attack at night. These pointers help identify leaf holes from chewing insects:\n\nHoles are smaller and more diverse.\n\nHole edges are rough or ragged.\n\nHoles appear along leaf edges first.\n\nHoles may stay between leaf veins, be on just one leaf side, or consume entire leaves.\n\nChewing insect control: An effective broad-spectrum insecticide stops a wide range of chewing insects, no matter who's guilty. Sevin Insect Killer Concentrate kills Japanese beetles, earwigs, flea beetles and other listed chewing insects. Then it keeps protecting your plant's leaves for up to three months. You can reenter treated areas when the spray dries.\n\nJapanese beetles are chewing insects that skeletonize leaves.\n\nHoles From Sucking Insects\n\nSome hole-making insects prefer liquid diets, made possible by specialized mouthparts. Aphids and squash bugs are examples of what's called piercing-sucking pests. They pierce leaves and suck plant sap through tubular mouthparts that work like straws. Rasping-sucking pests, such as thrips, scrape leaf surfaces and suck plant juices from the oozing holes.\n\nSucking insects strike many plant types, from flowers and grasses to roses, hydrangeas, cabbage, eggplant, tomatoes and kale. Their damage happens day and night. Leaf holes from sucking insects offer these clues:\n\nDamage focuses on tender, new growth.\n\nSmall, seeping holes become yellow spots.\n\nEntire leaves become mottled or discolored.\n\nSticky honeydew, excreted by sucking insects, attracts ants.\n\nSucking insect control: As with chewing insects, sucking insects are a wide-ranging group. Broad-spectrum Sevin Insect Killer Concentrate or Sevin Insect Killer Ready to Spray kills aphids, squash bugs and other listed sucking pests. Then it protects for up to three months. Once sprays dry, people and pets can reenter treated areas.\n\nRasping-sucking pests like thrips cover leaves with tiny feeding holes.\n\nHoles From Fungal Diseases\n\nSome holes on plant leaves start with diseases, not insects or gastropods. Unlike freshly chewed edges or oozing holes, these leaf holes usually begin as spots. Once disease is active, spots can spread quickly. Hole-causing fungal diseases include anthracnose, Cercospora and shot hole disease.\n\nFungal diseases affect all types of plants. They often trace back to cultural problems such as overcrowding, poor air circulation and wet leaves. Holes caused by fungal disease usually offer these hints:\n\nHoles start as yellow, discolored or wet-looking spots.\n\nUndersides of spots may show fuzzy fungal growth.\n\nSpots turn brown and dead centers fall out.\n\nBrown or yellow halos remain around the holes.\n\nFungal disease control: Prevention is crucial with fungal diseases. Give your plants plenty of room and avoid overhead watering. Water early in the day so any wet leaves dry before nightfall. Then let Daconil fungicide products help prevent, stop and control more than 65 types of fungal disease. Once the spray dries, people and pets can reenter and enjoy the area.\n\nCucumbers are vulnerable to anthracnose leaf spots and holes.\n\nHealthy Plants and Leaves\n\nKeeping your plants well-nourished goes a long way toward preventing leaf holes from all types of hole-causing pests. Healthy plants are better able to resist insects and diseases — and the holes they cause — which means more beautiful leaves and plants for you.\n\nPennington UltraGreen All Purpose Plant Food 10-10-10 feeds your plants a balanced, beneficial blend of essential nutrients, then it keeps feeding for up to four months.
