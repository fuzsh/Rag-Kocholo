        "text": "The camera system, above, is (as Phase One say) ‚Äúthe pinnacle of image quality, offering some of the highest resolution captures of any commercially available camera‚Äù ‚Äì and that‚Äôs a picture of it sat on my dining table!\n\nThat‚Äôs right, I‚Äôve finally made the permanent switch to medium format. As a long-term Canon shooter (even my first compact film cameras were Canon) it‚Äôs a sad day in some respects as my Canon gear has been with me through thick and thin. Responsible for some of my favourite images I‚Äôve shot from amazing places around the world I can‚Äôt really say a bad word about it and would recommend their EOS system to anyone. In reality, I‚Äôll be keeping two of my EOS bodies and L lenses, but others will be sold as I switch to using my new 80 megapixel digital back to capture even more of the stunning landscapes I‚Äôm lucky enough to see.\n\nAlong with the digital back, the need for the right body and lenses is clearly just as important so I‚Äôve added a few more things to the line-up in my gear bag. My new Benro case will be causing me back-strain from now on as I haul the new contents around the world:\n\nPhase One iQ280 Digital back\n\nPhase One 645DF+ Medium Format camera body\n\nSchneider Kreuznach Leaf-Shutter 80mm f/2.8 lens\n\nPhase One AF 28mm f/2.8 lens\n\nPhase One AF 45mm f/2.8 lens\n\nPhase One AFD 75-150mm f/4.5 lens\n\nSo, why the leap?\n\nGiven the cost of this stuff (ouch!), believe me, it‚Äôs a considered move to say the least. The fact is, I‚Äôve used Canon camera equipment for so long that I‚Äôve gotten used to its quirks as well as its features and have started to hit a wall I wasn‚Äôt expecting. Sadly it‚Äôs a wall that can‚Äôt be fixed by any 35mm DSLR EOS body. I‚Äôve used the 5D2, 5D3, 7D, 1DX, M, the lot ‚Äì and for landscapes, I still honestly believe the 5D3 is the best in the lineup that Canon currently offers.\n\nThe problem is, that‚Äôs great while you‚Äôre printing up to 42‚Ä≥. Beyond that, the quality of the print on the wall shows signs of the pixels struggling to keep up with the dimensions. Nikon have a great answer to this in their 35mm DSLR format: the D800/D800E. At 36mp it‚Äôs an amazing bit of kit for landscape photography with that sensor squeezed in there, but having seen the results in my opinion it‚Äôs still not quite really ‚Äúup there‚Äù either.\n\nWhat about the Hasselblad option? I looked seriously at the H5D-50. It‚Äôs a great camera, really, but then that‚Äôs a lot of money to spend on a closed system (you can only use their lenses) and at 50mp it‚Äôs still shooting on a smaller physical sensor (36.7 x 49.1mm compared to 40.4 x 53.7mm with Phase One) and delivers images of 8176√ó6132 pixels ‚Äì quite a bit smaller than the near 11,000 pixels wide of the iQ280‚Äôs output. For printing BIG, every pixel counts, and while none of these cameras come close to the level of detail provided by large-format film, in the current market the iQ280 is the best I can get. Beyond that, having played with their workflow and editing software ‚ÄúCapture One‚Äú, I really do get the complete solution with Phase One.\n\nOf course, some downsides do exist with the iQ2 series and 645DF+ body : fast shooting? NO way! Try the blistering frame rate of 0.7/second for a start. üôÅ So, for events/concerts my Canon gear will still undoubtedly be making an appearance. It‚Äôs also not nearly as weatherproofed either, so my old friends the ‚Äúrain sleeves‚Äù will come in very handy when I stand looking over mountains in a storm!\n\nThe upsides, however, really do outweigh those two issues. The lenses I‚Äôve got are incredibly sharp, and the detail this kit can produce is beyond comparison from what I‚Äôve seen with other systems. The Leaf Shutter (Schneider) lens I have will also allow me to experiment with insanely high flash sync speeds at 1/1600s and while that shutter system adds a lot to the weight, for studio work that‚Äôs definitely something to play with in future.\n\nOf course, what‚Äôs in front of the glass can be just as important as what‚Äôs behind, so I‚Äôve also taken the opportunity to upgrade my filter set. To that end, I had a bit of a splurge with my local Cokin dealer‚Ä¶ üòâ\n\nThe new X-Pro filters I‚Äôve got are a great example of amazing optical engineering. Not cheap, by any means, but the grads, polarisers and NDs I now have really do add something to the images I can capture. Of course, I don‚Äôt always want a full filter frame stuck to the front of my camera so I also grabbed a set of some ultra-thin ‚ÄúPure‚Äù screw-in filters. Made of ‚Äúharmonite‚Äù these things are amazingly slim and have a clarity I‚Äôve never before seen in a standard filter.\n\nSo, all this stuff arrived just in time for my trip to California this week. With Napa, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite and San Francisco ‚Äúin the frame‚Äù, I‚Äôm really looking forward to putting the new Phase One gear through its paces (as I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll put me through mine too!)\n\nOh, and apologies for the lack of updates for the past 3-4 weeks. As you can see, I‚Äôve been a little bit busy‚Ä¶\n\nüòâ"
