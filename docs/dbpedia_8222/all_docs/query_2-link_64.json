        "text": "Fossil Fuels\n\nCoal, the most abundant fuel source in the United States, accounts for most of Georgia Power's generating capacity.\n\nCoal is formed by chemical changes to plant material over a period of many years, converting it to combustible rock composed of carbon and other elements like oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur and nitrogen. Coal is extracted from the ground and transported to Georgia from other states.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nNatural gas generation uses one of America's most abundant resources to produce safe, reliable and clean energy. Natural gas-fueled combined cycle power plants offer one of the cleanest and most efficient methods of producing electricity.\n\nNatural gas is first removed from wells drilled into the ground. It is then treated to remove any impurities before pipelines transport the natural gas to power plants.\n\nSolar\n\nSolar power generation has emerged as one of the most rapidly growing renewable sources of electricity. Weâ€™re proud to work with the US Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force to develop innovative solar energy projects, both on and off base. Our collaborations support military bases across Georgia, as well as federal emergency projects and local communities.\n\nHow solar energy works\n\nThere are basically two types of solar energy that can be used on a home or business: solar electric and solar thermal. Get a better understanding of how each type works."
