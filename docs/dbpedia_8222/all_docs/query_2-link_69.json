        "text": "What does foxglove look like?\n\nFoxglove is a well-known plant across the UK, which produces a spike of purple-pink flowers between June and September. It can grow up to 2m tall and is found in heathland, woodland edges and gardens. This pretty flower is also a valuable source of nectar for bees.\n\nLeaves: oval-shaped and hairy with a toothed margin. The first year plant produces a basal rosette, but older plants show an alternate leaf arrangement on the stem.\n\nFlowers: pink-purple in colour, occasionally white and showing darker coloured spots on the lower lip of the flower. Flowers are tube-shaped and grow on a tall spike. The plant itself can grow up to 2m tall.\n\nFruit/seeds: a capsule encompassing many seeds, which changes colour from green to black when ripening.\n\nNot to be confused with: common comfrey (Symphytum officinale). Comfrey could be mistaken for foxglove when not in flower, as the leaves are similar. However, comfrey leaves are untoothed, meaning they have smooth edges, and foxglove leaves are toothed. Great mullein (Verbascum thapsus) is another plant foxglove might be confused with when no flowers are present. However, great mullein leaves are untoothed and are hairier than those of foxglove.\n\nMythology and symbolism\n\nThe origins of the name foxglove are unclear, but can be traced all the way back to the Anglo-Saxon period. It’s thought the ‘glove’ part of the name is simply due to the flowers looking like glove fingers. Less certain is the connection to foxes. One theory is that people believed foxes wore the flowers on their paws to silence their movements when hunting. Another is that the flower is often found growing close to the earths where foxes raise their young.\n\nThis striking plant has been mentioned in various poems, such as A Nocturnal Reverie by Anne Finch, as well as being the star of poems itself, like the aptly named Foxgloves by Mary Webb."
