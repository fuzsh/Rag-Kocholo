also used to refer to the degree of branching.\n\nrank: in the taxonomic hierarchy, one of the levels assigned to plant groups; these denote relative inclusion relationships, e.g. a family will include a genus or genera, but not vice versa; members of the one rank are not equivalent other than - one hopes - all being monophyletic and are therefore not really comparable; for the main ranks mentioned here, see class, order, family, genus, species (which may well not be monophyletic...).\n\nranunculaceous (of stomata) = anomocytic.\n\nraphe: where the funicle is adnate to the body of the ovule, see also antiraphe, chalaza, embryo sac, integument, lagenostome, megaspore, micropyle, nucellus, pollen chamber, obturator.\n\nraphides: needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate that occur in bundles in the vacuoles of some plant cells, see biforines, c.f. crystal sand, druses, prisms, styloids.\n\nray: (anatomy) in xylem or phloem, a vertically elongated band of often radially elongated parenchymatous cells traversing the conducting elements, see also aggregate ray, tile cells, also heterogeneous, homogeneous and heterocellular, homocellular.\n\nray: of a compound umbel, one of the first series of branches of the inflorescence axis, of an asteraceous flower head or capitulum, a spreading, petal-like floret.\n\nray floret: a monosymmetric flower towards the periphery of a capitulum, esp. in Asteraceae, ligulate, with a split monosymmetric corolla, c.f. disc floret.\n\nray initials: a kind of cambial initial in the vascular cambium, vertical series of low cells the division and subsequent differentiation of which that produce the rays, c.f. fusiform initials.\n\nray parenchyma: radially orientated xylem parenchyma in the wood, see ray type, c.f. axial parenchyma.\n\nreaction wood: wood often with a distinctive anatomy and position formed where a branch joins the stem, see compression and tension wood.\n\nrecalcitrant: of germination, and sometimes also pollen viability, the seed or pollen grain needing to remain hydrated if germination is to occur, there being no dormancy and with no tolerance of drying nor freezing (and often even temperatures below 10o C), sometimes applied to viviparous seeds and cleistogamous flowers, c.f. orthodox, see also after-ripening.\n\nrecaulescent: of axillary branching, a kind of orthotropic/vertical metatopic growth where the subtending leaf is as it were shifted on to the axis produced by its axillary meristem, the result being a \"stalk\" on which axillary bud and subtending leaf/bract are both borne, c.f. concaulescent and horizontal metatopy, also epicaulescent.\n\nreceptacle: the axis of a flower on which the perianth, androecium and gynoecium are borne; in Asteraceae, used to refer to the often swollen and apically flattened part of the stem bearing the flowers and inflorescence bracts; in monilophytes, the part of the sorus bearing sporangia.\n\nreceptacular epigyny: of epigyny, when the floral apex is initially convex, but after gynoecial initiation the periphery of the floral apex expands and raises, forming a basin in the center of which the carpels are borne and on the periphery of which the perianth members and androecium are borne, i.e. epigyny is due to development of axial tissues (Kuzoff et al. 2001), c.f. appendicular epigyny.\n\nreceptacular nectary: a nectary in the flower supplied by branches of the receptacular or androecial vasculature, c.f. gynoecial nectary.\n\nrecurved: curved or curled downwards or backwards, c.f. incurved.\n\nreduced: anther wall development in which the primary parietal layer gives rise to two secondary parietal layers, the outer producing the endothecium only, the inner producing the tapetum only, c.f. basic, dicotyledonous, monocotyledonous, reduced.\n\nreduplicate: of aestivation, valvate, the edges meeting, and although not overlapping, they are recurved, c.f. crumpled, decussate, induplicate, open.\n\nreduplicate: of plicate leaves, esp. in palms, the units of the leaves having their abaxial surfaces facing each other, inverted V-shaped, c.f. foliate, induplicate.\n\nreflectional: on of the basic types of symmetry, as in the identity between a figure and its relection in a mirror, e.g. mono-, disymmetry, etc., c.f. rotational and translational.\n\nreflexed: bent sharply downwards or backwards, c.f. inflexed.\n\nregular (of floral symmetry) = polysymmetric.\n\nreins: of a palm leaf, the ribbon-like band(s) along the sides of the leaf blade hanging from the tips of the pinnae - n.b. the leaf is not strictly bipinnate, even-pinnate, odd-pinnate, pinnate or tripinnate, and reins could be found hanging from a palmate leaf.\n\nreiteration: of plant architecture, when the characteristic construction of the individual is repeated by branch systems that develop on a plant after damage, or sometimes as the result of natural causes.\n\nreniform = kidney-shaped.\n\nrepand = undulate.\n\nreparatory strand: a strand of vascular tissue that fills (\"repairs\") the leaf gap left by the outgoing leaf trace, a branch of the sympodial units making up the central stele of seed plants.\n\nreplum: when placentation is parietal, = a \"false\" septum joining the placentae.\n\nrepent: plant with stem growing along the ground, usually rooting from the nodes, see ascending, decumbent, erect, procumbent.\n\nreproduction: the general process by which new plants are formed, in particular c.f. apomixis, amphimixis.\n\nreproductive nectary: a nectary that is found on the inflorescence or flower or associated structures - a positional definition - c.f. extrareproductive nectary.\n\nresins: lipid-soluble terpenes or phenols, c.f. gums, mucilages, latex, oils, waxes.\n\nresupinate: of floral symmetry, the flower twisted through 180o, e.g. as with the ovary of many Orchidaceae; note that resupination may result in the flower maintaining an inverted (as in Orchidaceae) or \"normal\" position (as in Thunbergia mysorensis - see Bell & Bryan 2008).\n\nresurrection plant: a plant whose leaves can dry out and remain dry for years, and then take in water and function normally when there is rain, c.f. anhydrobiosis, diallagy.\n\nreticulate: in general, forming a network.\n\nreticulate: a term used to describe the surface of a pollen grain, a network-like pattern consisting of lumina or other spaces wider than 1µm bordered by elements narrower than the lumina, whether pilae (gemmate and retipilate are variants) or muri, c.f. baculate, echinate, fossulate, gemmate, foveolate, lophate, metareticulate, psilate, rugulate, scabrate, striate, verrucose.\n\nreticulate: in leaf venation, where the veins join or anastomose (so technically forming cycles), one of three terms that describe the basic organization of venation, see also dendritic and hierarchical;
