        "text": "Well, I did it — I switched to Phase One. The thought had been on my mind for a number of months before I was able to make the investment, and I’d certainly lose some money in the process, but the more I stepped through the advantages and benefits that a switch would net me, the decision became easier. The decision to switch, for me, was a very logical one with a number of reasons — all of which I will cover below.\n\nI want to note that I’ll be framing this comparison through the ownership lens — the experience(s) I’ve had thus far during my time owning each system and what it’s been like to actually live with, own, and use each, so don’t expect too many quantitative comparisons. Also note that this is a relatively apples-to-apples comparison, as I traded my H6D-50c system for the Phase One XF body and an IQ350 back, in what essentially amounts to a sidegrade to the other brand.\n\nBoth bodies have excellent weather sealing — The H6D has been improved greatly over the H5D and previous generations in this regard; grommets and seals everywhere. I used my H6 in some light rain, on the beach with sea spray, and in the dusty desert — and never experienced any issues due to weather.\n\nThe XF and IQ3 back are very dense and industrial in feel due to the construction and materials used; while there are no apparent or exposed signs of weather sealing, it’s certainly there — under a whole lot of metal.\n\nDesign is subjective, so I can’t call either one a winner — It’s simply up to your own preference. For myself, the increased build quality and feel of the materials of the Phase One are the winner here. I’m also a tech-geek, so I can also appreciate the industrial design, though for most, I imagine the Hasselblad is the more aesthetically beautiful camera.\n\nWinner: Subjective. For me, it’s Phase One for its better overall build quality and solid feeling materials.\n\nback to top\n\nEach focusing system has its advantages and disadvantages — The Hasselblad autofocus system is generally regarded as “better” due to their TrueFocus/TrueFocus II feature, which will calculate the camera’s movement during recomposition and apply the focus shift prior to capture. In my experience, TrueFocus works beautifully most of the time, and is a huge help when shooting tighter portraits/headshots.\n\nIn Phase One Feature Update #4, Phase One added similar functionality to the XF body called “AFr” (Autofocus-Recompose). I have not had the chance to test this however, since the feature is only compatible with the newest (and much more expensive) Schneider-Kreuznach “Blue Ring” series of lenses. Preliminary accounts for this feature from the GetDPI forums (hit the link if you’d like to read more) over the last year have been less than stellar with a few reporting it simply does not work.\n\nBoth the H6D and the XF have a single autofocus point in the center of the viewfinder, meaning focus-recompose is the only technique available when placing your subject off-center, making the above AF assist modes a useful feature. Outside of their respective focus-assist modes above, the single-point autofocus on each camera works well. Though the Hasselblad, in my experience, is a bit more accurate, but it may simply be that I’ve not had enough time with the XF yet.\n\nPhase One has, however, made available a hardware update for their autofocus system in the XF via a new AF sensor, dubbed the HAP-2 (HoneyBee Autofocus Platform 2). Getting the new HAP-2 sensor installed requires owners to send their camera bodies back to Phase One to get the new hardware installed. HAP-2 requires the XF body to be running on Feature Update #3 or newer. The HAP-2 upgrade provides the following improvements over the previous HAP-1:\n\nImproved low-light performance — a 2.5 stop increase in autofocus sensitivity\n\nImproved Dynamic Range — 1-stop improvement in autofocus for high-key scenes.\n\nCheck out the HAP-2 Release Notes for more comprehensive information.\n\nThis hardware upgrade option for the XF shows Phase’s commitment in supporting and continually improving/developing their current platform, so your system will grow with you.\n\nThe XF also has some nifty AF features — you can trim (microadjust) your lenses to your specific camera/body/back (a feature not available on Hasselblad bodies, as their camera/back/lenses are all calibrated as one “unit”). Additionally, the XF can save a user-set hyperfocal distance per lens that can recall the setting at the touch of a button.\n\nWinner: Hasselblad. Even with all of the XF’s tricks and AF features, overall I have to give the autofocus edge to Hasselblad since their autofocus — in my experience — was less fussy and just worked. I will have to spend some time with the new Phase to get used to its operation, but on first blush, the Phase HoneyBee autofocus system is not quite as good.\n\nAddendum: I have spent some more time with the XF and the autofocus works very well (I have my XF set up for back-button focus) — in practice, the Autofocus in the XF is just as good as the H6D. However, I still have to give the slightest edge to Hasselblad for their TrueFocus system, until I can experiment with the new AFr feature.\n\nback to top\n\nWe can see that all of the cameras perform about the same from ISO 100-3200, with the exception of the Phase One IQ250, which appears to be about 2/3 stop better in terms of dynamic range from ISO 200 through 1600. At ISO 3200, all of the cameras seem to converge in terms of DR performance, with the exception of the Pentax 645Z, which lags behind the pack by almost 2 stops.\n\nFrom samples I've seen being posted around on facebook groups and other samples online, it seems like the GFX has incredible shadow recovery, and the above chart shows that it seems about 1/3 - 1/2 stop better in terms of shadow recovery than the competition.\n\nI'm wondering if this is simply a difference in the processing; In my short time with the H6D, I've noticed that it has incredible highlight recovery capabilities, but pushing deep shadows can sometimes get noisy in a hurry — this could be a choice on the part of the manufacturer, keeping in mind the camera's intended purpose/audience. While the Hasselblad is primarily a studio and location camera more likely to be used in conjunction with lighting (where you don't tend to push shadows to an extreme amount), being able to pull or recover highlights may be a little more important (hotspots, slightly overexposed areas, etc.) — and the GFX is more of an all-around tool, often used with natural or less-than-ideal lighting conditions, where pushing shadows is more common.\n\nWinner: Draw. It’s all the same to me; I’m not qualified to call one “sharper” or “better” over the other — I suppose if you normally over-expose, the Hasselblad favoring highlights could be helpful…or vice-versa. Below are some of my images from the both cameras in a variety of situations to get a feel for the image quality out of the sensor.\n\nI don’t have enough experience with the Phase One at this point to make a (subjective) call on which of the systems has better lens quality, but my basic understanding of the different lenses offered by each brand is that most of the lens lineup has unchanged optical formulas despite each brand having a “newer” line of lenses.\n\nHasselblad has their HC Lineup (going all the way back to the H1) but they also have newer “Orange Dot” versions of their lenses which remain unchanged optically from the older lenses; the exception being an updated exposure unit (leaf shutter) that is capable of up to 1/2000 shutter speed (and flash sync) as opposed to the max of 1/800 in the old HC lenses; however, the 1/2000 shutter speed will only with H6 (or newer) bodies. On older bodies (H5 and prior), the Orange Dot lenses will net an extra 1/3 stop of shutter speed (1/1000). Hasselblad does have a few optically updated lenses in its lineup, denoted by a “II” (version/mark 2) following their name:\n\nHC 50mm f/3.5 II\n\nHC 120mm f/4 Macro II\n\nTechnically the HC 150mm f/3.2 “N” is an updated design from the original, as well.\n\nPhase One’s Schneider-Kreuznach lenses are regarded as optically excellent, and my experience reflects this — I’ve not seen any real differences — to my eye — between the Hasselblad glass or the Phase glass; they are all able to resolve enough for even the most demanding high-megapixel digital backs. Like Hasselblad, Phase One also has a new line of lenses, denoted by a different, more modern design (to match the XF), and a prominent “Blue Ring” around the lens barrel. Also like Hasselblad, the newer Blue Ring lenses are not optically different than the older (and cheaper) Phase/Mamiya “Silver Ring” lenses. There are some new optical designs in the Blue Ring lineup, though:\n\nSK 35mm f/3.5 LS Blue Ring\n\nSK 45mm f/3.5 LS Blue Ring\n\nSK 150mm f/2.8 LS Blue Ring\n\nPhase One’s leaf shutter lenses are capable of up to 1/1600, with the exception of the new 150mm f/2.8 — that particular lens is only capable of up to 1/1000 leaf shutter. Since the XF has a focal plane shutter as well, the XF is capable of taking any older Mamiya glass, too. The focal plane shutter is capable of up to 1/4000 shutter speed; however when using the FPS with non leaf-shutter lenses, the x-sync will only be 1/125. The FPS can be used in conjunction with leaf shutter lenses to shoot at shutter speeds faster than the leaf shutter’s x-sync (1/1600 or 1/1000). Big advantage for Phase in this department, IMO.\n\nAs expected, the final score is very close; I went into this having loved the Hasselblad in the time I owned and used it, so there is no bias here — I simply made the switch based on the features of the system that appealed to me personally (and some personal reasons, as noted in the next section).\n\nPhase One: 5 points — The Phase One came out on top in the following categories: Build Quality/Aesthetic, Controls, Features, Connectivity, and Workflow.\n\nHasselblad: 4 Points — The Hasselblad bested the Phase in the following categories: Autofocus (by a hair), Handling, Weight, and Media Selection.\n\nDraw: Image Quality and Optics. Arguably the two most important components of any camera system, and it’s a wash. Each system is well-established enough that it really comes down to your own workflow and personal preference.\n\nHandling, features, lens selection, workflow and more all carry different weights for each individual, and should be considered accordingly when making a decision of this magnitude. For me, the extra features that I would certainly make use of, along with the neat “extras” like better build quality, more pleasing (to me) aesthetic, viewfinder options, and workflow, made the choice easy.\n\nThe new Medium Format Mirrorless cameras released in the last few years has certainly shaken up the Medium Format market in terms of perceived value for cameras with “larger-than-full-frame” sensors. When consumers are only looking at spec sheets and are constantly looking to the future for potential improvements (and at a very rapid pace), it’s extremely hard for a low-volume company like Hasselblad or Phase One to compete — we’ve seen plummeting values for Medium Format SLR systems in the last 3-4 years, of which I believe the Fuji GFX and the Hasselblad X1D series are largely responsible. The same goes for the mirrorless landscape and traditional DSLRs, with some considering DSLR’s “dead”.\n\nFor enthusiasts or hobbyists, the GFX (in any flavor) or the X1D checks most of the boxes while being infinitely easier to use and carry. This, coupled with the extremely low (comparatively) price point on the new Medium Format mirrorless cameras and lenses makes MFD more accessible to more people — which is certainly a good thing. The new cameras from Hasselblad (X1D II and 907X) and Fuji (GFX 100) are without a doubt awesome and unique for the enthusiasts, professionals and hobbyists, but ultimately are consumer products and will have a shorter “shelf life” than an investment a system.\n\nThe unfortunate side effect of the recent rapid development in consumer medium format is that the owners of SLR MFD cameras are stuck holding the bag; their investment(s) are no longer strong in such a market. The individuals who tend to purchase the best, most technologically-advanced tool at the time will always be looking forward for the next-best thing, and as such, the service life for consumer products is much shorter, with the development lifecycle for that category being shorter and a new generation of the product typically being released every 1-3 years. The H6 and until recently, the IQ3 — are the most current offerings from each brand — and they were released in 2015. Only until recently had the consumer cameras reached (and surpassed) the level of resolution and image quality of 5+ year old tech from Phase and Hasselblad.\n\nAn investment in a medium format system is a long-term investment, and one that grows with you. The investment required to acquire a Phase or Hasselblad system is significant — you are (either directly, or indirectly) supporting the research & development for these companies to continue pushing the envelope of digital photography, image quality, and resolution. In return, you get the absolute best image quality available; at least, until the technology trickles down to more accessible products. Being invested into a system means you have to be okay with this, as inevitably, your investment will quickly be “outdated” by more modern technology. However, this has no effect or bearing on the quality of the imagery one produces.\n\nOn the bright side, like buying a car, owners that lease or purchase equipment from either brand can (and do) often trade up to the newest tech — both Phase One and Hasselblad have clear trade-in programs and upgrade paths for those invested in the brand. This ensures that your investment qualifies you (should you choose to upgrade to the latest and greatest digital back) to be at the bleeding edge of digital photo technology.\n\nFor professionals, rental businesses, or die-hard enthusiasts and wealthy hobbyists that want a Medium Format “system” that they can invest in, I believe Phase One is the way forward. Seeing Hasselblad’s latest offerings, it seems (to me) that the brand is slowly becoming diluted. Whether the recent product offerings are a result of DJI “ownership” steering the boat off course under pressure for profits (PetaPixel recently posted that DJI may be “cloning” the X1D), or if the more consumer-level offerings were always part of the plan for Hasselblad’s return to form — we’ve yet to see. I appreciate Phase One’s laser-focus on being at the absolute pinnacle of their segment with an unwavering commitment to creating the best product possible for their niche. With a philosophy like that, I felt like my investment is safer with Phase One.\n\nback to top"
