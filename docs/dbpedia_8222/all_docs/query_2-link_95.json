        "text": "PepsiCo Global\n\nLatin America\n\nFor more than 100 years, PepsiCo’s Latin America business has grown to become one of the strongest food and beverage manufacturers in the region by working closely with local entrepreneurs and investing in lasting win-win partnerships with our suppliers and farmers, investors, consumers, and communities.\n\nPepsiCo Latin America sells beverages, salty snacks, cookies, crackers, oats, nuts and seeds throughout the region. The business earned $11.7 billion in annual net revenue in 2023, supports more than 80,000 direct jobs and operates over 40 production plants in 34 countries. Our portfolio includes major global brands such as Pepsi, Lay’s, Quaker, Gatorade, 7UP, Doritos, Cheetos and Ruffles, as well as regional and local brands like Gamesa, Mafer, Tortrix and Kero Coco.\n\nPepsiCo LatAm is led by Paula Santilli, CEO.\n\nPepsiCo Global\n\nEurope\n\nPepsiCo’s businesses have been operating in markets across our Europe sector for more than 80 years, manufacturing and supplying delicious foods and beverages that are enjoyed by millions of consumers each day. Our portfolio of snacks, soft drinks, dairy, juices and grains encompasses world-famous brands such as Pepsi, Lay’s, Doritos, 7UP, Tropicana and Quaker Oats, alongside our much-loved, local and regional brands, including Walkers crisps, Alvalle Gazpacho Duyvis nuts and Agusha baby food. We are now the leading manufacturer of savory snacks, hot cereals and juices in the Europe sector and the second-largest producer of carbonated soft drinks and dairy.\n\nOur Europe team is committed to excellence, innovation and meeting consumer needs, and our commitment to sustainability is at the heart of our business — from the crops we grow through to our manufacturing operations and the packaging of our brands. Over the decades we have invested in our local markets, providing support to farmers through our Sustainable Farming Program as well as partnering with numerous NGOs to improve the livelihoods of communities where we operate.\n\nPepsiCo Europe is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and led by Silviu Popovici, CEO of Europe.\n\nPepsiCo Global\n\nAsia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China (APAC)\n\nThe APAC sector consists of the Asia Pacific, Australia/New Zealand and China regions, offering a number of leading snack brands such as Cheetos, Doritos, Lay’s and Smith’s as well as various beverage brands including 7UP, Aquafina, Mirinda, Mountain Dew and Pepsi.\n\nPepsiCo also sells ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever under the Lipton brand and licenses Tropicana through a strategic alliance with Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp.\n\nPepsiCo APAC is headquartered in Shanghai, China, and led by Wern-Yuen Tan, CEO, Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China.\n\nPepsiCo Global\n\nAfrica, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA)\n\nThe AMESA sector consists of the Africa, Middle East and South Asia regions and features many leading global snack brands, including Lay’s, Cheetos and Doritos, along with local favorites such as Chipsy (Egypt), Simba (South Africa) and Kurkure (India and Pakistan), as well as various beverage brands like 7UP, Pepsi, Aquafina, Mountain Dew, Mirinda and Sting.\n\nThe sector covers a wide span of developing and emerging markets, including the key countries of Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and South Africa. In 2020, PepsiCo acquired Pioneer Foods, a leading food and beverage company in South Africa, adding its robust, well-known brands — among them Weet-Bix, Bokomo and Ceres — to PepsiCo’s portfolio.\n\nThe Pioneer Foods acquisition is key to PepsiCo’s growth strategy across the entire African continent. The AMESA sector is committed to PepsiCo’s vision of sustainable growth, which emphasizes efficient use of sustainable farming practices, energy and natural resources such as water. The sector is also working to create a world where plastic need never become waste by creating public-private partnerships in key markets to collect and recycle post-consumer plastic waste.\n\nPepsiCo AMESA is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and led by Eugene Willemsen, CEO, Africa, Middle East and South Asia.\n\n1972\n\nPepsiCo Enters Soviet Union\n\nIn 1972, Pepsi becomes the first U.S. consumer product to be produced, marketed and sold in the Soviet Union.\n\nPhoto: Nikita Khrushchev enjoys a Pepsi with Donald Kendall, with then-VP Richard Nixon looking on (1959)."
