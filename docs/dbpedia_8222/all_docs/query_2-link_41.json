        "text": "What does ivy look like?\n\nIvy is an evergreen, woody climber which can grow to a height of 30m. It has two different forms â€“ juvenile and mature. It has climbing stems with specialised hairs which help it stick to surfaces as it climbs. Mature forms can be self-supporting.\n\nThere are two native species of ivy in the UK: Hedera helix and Hedera hibernica.\n\nH. helix is the common ivy, which can be found throughout the UK.\n\nH. hibernica is the Atlantic ivy, which is more common in the west of Britain and in Ireland. Both species can climb, but there is a cultivar of H. hibernica called 'Hibernica' which grows along the ground and does not usually climb. This cultivar is often planted as ground cover and can become invasive.\n\nNot to be confused with:\n\nBoston ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidatus) is a North American plant that is widely planted in the UK. It is a member of the grape family and is not closely related to ivy.\n\nPoison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) is another North American plant that is not closely related to ivy. It is a poisonous plant and can cause skin irritation.\n\nWhere to find ivy\n\nIvy is a common and widespread plant in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It can be found in many habitats, including woodland, scrub, wasteland, and on isolated trees. Both common ivy and Atlantic ivy are tolerant of shade and survive in all but the most dry, waterlogged, or acidic soils.\n\nWild ivy found growing anywhere in Britain or Ireland may be either species, although Atlantic ivy predominates in the west of Britain and in Ireland, as suggested by its common name.\n\nIvy is an evergreen plant, so leaves can be seen at any time of the year. It flowers from September to November and its fruits ripen between November to January.\n\nCommon ivy is more common and widespread than Atlantic ivy. It is found throughout the UK, from the lowlands to the uplands.\n\nAtlantic ivy is more common in the west of Britain and in Ireland. It is also found in some parts of eastern England, but it is less common there.\n\nValue of ivy to wildlife\n\nNectar, pollen and berries of ivy are an essential food source for insects and birds, especially during autumn and winter when little else is about. It also provides shelter for insects, birds, bats and other small mammals. The high fat content of the berries is a nutritious food resource for birds and the berries are eaten by a range of species including thrushes, blackcaps, woodpigeons and blackbirds.\n\nIvy is particularly important to many insects before they go into hibernation. Some of the main insect species which forage on the nectar and pollen of ivy are bees, hoverflies and common wasps.\n\nIt is an important food plant for some butterfly and moth larvae such as holly blue, small dusty wave, angle shades and swallow-tailed moth.\n\nMany rare insects are attracted to ivy flowers, including the golden hoverfly.\n\nMythology and symbolism\n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans believed that wearing a wreath of ivy leaves around the head would prevent one from getting drunk. The Roman god Bacchus, the god of intoxication, was often depicted wearing a wreath of ivy and grapevines. Ivy was also a symbol of intellectual achievement in ancient Rome and wreaths were used to crown winners of poetry contests. Wreaths were also given to winning athletes in ancient Greece.\n\nIvy was a symbol of fidelity and so priests would present a wreath of ivy to newly married couples. Today it is still the custom for bridal bouquets to contain a sprig of ivy."
