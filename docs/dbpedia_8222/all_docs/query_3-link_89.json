        "text": "Slightly more than 800 students, in attendance at Kirkwood Elementary School's opening day, were greeted by faculty, staff and administrators, as well as members of Fort Campbell's 101st Airborne Division Band Brass Ensemble.\n\nJust before the students' arrival, principal Frances Ann Camp gathered members of her team for some words of inspiration for the opening of the much-awaited brand new school on the Clarksville-Montgomery County School System.\n\n“Being part of this has been an amazing experience. We have about 800 students and a staff of about 90. I've been working on today's opening since Jan. 2, 2024. It was hard to leave my students and staff at Rossview Elementary, but we are all so excited to be here,\" Camp said.\n\nCMCSS Chief Communications Officer, Anthony Johnson shared some information on the impact the new school will have.\n\n“We are here for the first day at Kirkwood Elementary School, opening its doors today for its first year,” Johnson said. “This completes our three-school campus with Kirkwood Middle opening two years ago and Kirkwood High School opening last year. We're just excited to greet students and families here for the first half-day of the school year.”\n\nThe capacity of Kirkwood Elementary is just over 1,000.\n\nThe opening of the new school brings CMCSS to a total of 46 schools.\n\n“The biggest change for CMCSS this year is the opening of Kirkwood Elementary, and the rezoning it facilitated,” Johnson said. “We rezoned our first phase of elementary schools this year, so, many students will now be attending new schools.\n\n“This also allowed us the flexibility to open, for the first time, an early learning center. St. Bethlehem Elementary will be serving Pre-K families.\"\n\nBurt Elementary has turned into Burt Innovation Center, while Middle College operates at APSU.\n\nJohnson says the new innovation center will allow CMCSS administrators to think innovatively into the future, to explore nontraditional instruction.\n\nStaffing has been a struggle for many school districts in recent years, but this year is off to a strong start Johnson said.\n\n“We are starting in a better position staff-wise than we have in the last three to five years,” Johnson said. “We're about 99% staffed on teachers. Bus drivers have been our biggest challenge in recent years. Three years ago our bus drivers were at about 51% staffing, this year we're starting at about 85% staffing.”\n\nJohnson mentioned that CMCSS is still hiring, and encourages interested parties to visit the CMCSS website. Although enrollment numbers are not determined, he anticipates a student body population of more than 40,000 students in the 2024-25 school year.\n\nCMCSS Director of Schools Jean Luna-Vedder greeted students at the entry with smiles and fist-bumps.\n\n“We are so excited to see all our families here at Kirkwood Elementary,” Luna-Vedder said. “We had a great open house last night, and we're here to welcome all the students this morning. So far, we have had a smooth start to the year. We're excited to get everyone here, and safely back home today, and look forward to our first full day on Monday.”"
