        "text": "Recently Phase One released a brand new Phase One Camera, the XF. It replaces the DF-645 and DF-645 + , which were actually Mamiya camera’s. The XF is engineered and build from the ground up and has many features, but most of all a newly developed focusing system based on a 1Mpixel focus sensor (Honeybee) .\n\nSee my video on this here:\n\nImmediate after the release of the new camera critics were received on the Focusing System. Many were expecting multiple focus points, like on standard DSLR’s. Much to their dislikes, the XF has a single central focus point.\n\nI can’t say that I agree with the critics, as I have been using the new XF and before the 645df+ body. Both have a single focus point, located in the center of the lens. So, allow me to put down some words in defense of Phase One.\n\nThere are several reasons why it is engineered the way it is, and like anything else it is a well considered balance between features and quality.\n\nFocus must be fast, accurate and reliable.\n\nAll Mirror Reflex camera’s (DSLR’s and Phase One) focus either through phase or contrast method. It is measured on a special CCD (focus CCD) and mounted inside the camera body along the normal mirror down light path. After all light travels through the lens, hits the mirror, reflects in the prism and hits the eye on the viewfinder.\n\nThe Focus CCD provides the needed details on contrast to a compute engine which than drives the servomotor in the lens to increase or decrease the focal length. After each small step, the contrast is checked again. Until full focus is achieved.\n\nThose DSLR’s with multiple selectable focus points (Nikon, Canon etc…) use only a part of the focus sensor. The focus sensor is partitioned and each partition matches to the selected focus area on the viewfinder. Hence only a sub set of the pixels (focus sensor) are used to track and hunt the focus.\n\nA Phase One camera (single focus point) uses the full 1 Mpixel focus CCD to calculate and acquire focus. It makes it far more precise and accurate then any DSLR.\n\nFurthermore, the Phase One XF uses a central focus point. This delivers the best and sharpest focus, as optical lenses are at best at their midpoint.\n\nThere is an usage disadvantage of having only a single center focus point , however that is by far outweighed by the superior focus .\n\nShooting with a single central focus point results in centric pictures. Not at all pleasing to look at, as we all appreciate the golden cut or 2/3 rules. Of course you could focus on the eyes of a model, and then lock the focus and reframe to a 2/3 kind of arrangement. That works well in most cases, however one can lose the focus especially with 1.4 or 2.8 lenses as they have a very shallow DOF.\n\nWith a multipoint focus system like the DSLR, it is easier to selected a single focus point at 2/3 of the picture frame and place it on the eye of the model. However the focus will not be that accurate as you are off-center and only a fraction of the Focus Sensor is used.\n\nNever the less, the Phase One single focus point performs far better, and if you can’t get the swing of reframing without loosing the focus then shoot center stage. There is plenty of image pixel real-estate to crop in post processing (50,60, 80 and 100 Mpx image sensors).\n\nThe bottom line is, the Phase One XF central single focus point uses the full focusing sensor resulting in accurate and very fine adjustments , combined with the best optical performance of the lens ( center).\n\nIn the future, we might expect live-view methods. Whereby we will be able to tap on any area on the viewer display to acquire focus. That will be possible without the mirror box and Focus sensor. The image sensor will be used for both the Image Capture and Focus Sensing. Note that Phase One already has an electronic shutter capability.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nOver the last couple of years I have been shooting models. During that time I have seen it all. Novice Models that are lured into bad practices, abused, promises and falls forecasts by dubious agencies and photographers. So here is some advice from an old boy.\n\n“ I am pretty and have the looks, that’s enough”.\n\nHmmm, where did I hear that before? Reality is that those models need to take a look at a fashion or glamor magazine and try to step into the role of those models. Soon they will realize that it is not obvious and requires a lot more then just been pretty.\n\nDo you have what it takes?\n\nFashion, seasons and trends change constantly, as a model you will have to adapt constantly. If you cannot or you’re stuck and rusted away in a certain style or trend then your career will be short-lived.\n\nModels must change their appearance just as trends do. What is “in” this year will be “out” next year. Scouts are looking year around for models that have a completely different look than their predecessors. Many agencies look for edgy models with an intense sense for fashion.\n\nA good agency is always looking for new faces, if you think you have the necessary charisma, take the first steps and visit an approved model agency.\n\nDoes and Don’ts\n\nThere are hundreds of unscrupulous and unprofessional agencies that exploit ignorant and novice models. So be aware, however with a few simple rules you can separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nNever sign anything during your first visit to an agency.\n\nVisit several agencies and compare.\n\nMake a list of those agencies where you feel comfortable.\n\nAlways take someone with you, to ensure your safety during the first meeting. If the agency does not allow you to be accompanied then something is wrong.\n\nDo not show up in your best outfit, be moderate with makeup. Remember, the agency is looking for people with a natural talent. So present yourself as natural as possible.\n\nNever sign a contract without going thoroughly through the contract conditions. Consult a lawyer if in doubt (conditions).\n\nIt may seem nice if one guarantees you work. The reality is that it is not a normal job and therefore there can be no guarantee. If they offer you guarantees for continued work, drop that agency.\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask the commission; that is the percentage of the payment that the agency deducts from your income when completing a job.\n\nAll agencies take a percentage, but the percentage can vary between agencies. Do not accept percentages above 35%, or below 15% (then something is wrong)\n\nQuestion them; ask for samples of their work and references. Including clients and models that have worked for or were a customers to the agency.\n\nResearch the agency that interests you, and find out what other people have to say about them.\n\nThe best advice “Choose a large and recognized modeling agency.”\n\nStarting models are bombarded with all kinds of conflicting advice. Therefore, be extremely careful when gathering advice. It is important that you choose an agency and not the other way around.\n\nPeople who know.\n\nAgencies are best placed to help new models and guide their careers. An agency performs a variety of functions, such as advising and educating, managing the portfolio and providing shoots with customers. In many cases, the agency will also manage the financial side.\n\nThere are dozens of agencies. It is important to approach the proper authorities. Set your expectations for a possible rejection so that it does not become a disappointment.\n\nAgencies find work for their models and present them to potential customers, such as designers and photographers.\n\nAn agent that helps and encourage you to find modeling work, will top off an average rate of 20% – 33% off of your income.\n\nBefore you start approaching agencies you need to determine the type of work you want to do that best fits you . This is determent by your looks, age, height and physique appearance.\n\n“A model without Personality is like a pub with no beer.”\n\nDo you have the right attitude?\n\nAttitude, attitude, attitude. In other words, a pretty face is not sufficient. And just as important as your appearance is your mental approach. If you do not have the right attitude for that particular role, the career will be short-lived.\n\nAim high, and accept that you will not always succeed. Commit for 100% at each shoot.\n\nIt is essential to be hard working, trustworthy and willing to learn. You should be able to follow instructions even if they go against your own ideas.\n\nDo not work to impress.\n\nRealize that the shoot is not about you. You play a role in a much broader project. A role that you have to perform to the best of your abilities, it is essential that you are able to get away and not emotionally involved. Due to the high competitive nature of modelling, accept that you will not always be selected. This is not a rejection, you will have to deal with this and accept it. Just so you can expand your career\n\nThe world is changing\n\nFashion is and continues to change. Where in the past the “super-skinny” models held sway, the current trend is “healthy-slim”. In many cases, the “size zero models” are even banned.\n\nMost agencies charge a minimum body mass index (BMI) of 18. Another development is the growth and reputation of “Plus” models or one size bigger.\n\nThe customer is getting taller and bigger; hence the demand for clothing that fits larger men and women. This means more demand and work for the larger models. It is difficult to predict how the fashion world will change in the coming years. But that change will happen is undoubtedly a fact. It is important that you remain flexible.\n\nWhat type of model are you?\n\nThe word “model” makes one think of images of fashion and catwalks. After all, this is the most famous part of modelling, especially with global superstars such as Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss. However, this work is not the only form of modelling. There are other choices like glamor or maybe you are the athletic type, you may decide to work as a fitness model. Work that suits you best depends to a large extent on your body shape.\n\nHowever, there are other factors you should keep in mind. For example, there is no point in pursuing a glamorous career if you do not want to partial undress (such as lingerie and artistic nude).\n\nIf you are determined to become a fashion model, you must meet certain criteria. A certain height and weight is mandatory and needs to be kept under control once you work. The reason is not just aesthetic; it has a practical side as well. , Fashion designers do not create clothes for specific models. Instead they design clothing with most universal sizes. If you match those sizes, you will always fit in what they produce.\n\nBefore you begin your career you have to decide which direction you want to go. This will help you build confidence and clarity while focusing on your goals.\n\nModel and Portfolio\n\nMany want to be a model, but not everyone has “the skills and charisma” to succeed.\n\nThe key to success is in your hands. There are only two ways to (disregarding scouting) become a model. Either by participating in an “agency” or act as a “freelance” model. For both you must have a professional “portfolio” with quality “pictures”. The portfolio is your business card or sign.\n\nA portfolio should be suitable for the type of model you want to be. Your portfolio should emphasize your good angles and shows versatility with your capacities and capabilities to be put in extra dividends.\n\nThe “portfolio” is an essential tool, a model without portfolio will find difficult or no work. Once you have a professional portfolio you can start marketing. Do not engage with just any photographer; select them in the same way as you would select an agency. To many so-called “photographers” have other intensions and motivations then providing a perfect portfolio.\n\nTo conclude\n\nModelling can be glamorous, with the potential to earn a lot of money in a very short time. But not easy to achieve. Many are called, few are chosen. It’s not just standing in front of the camera, or a riff on the catwalk, it is a “lifestyle.” As a model, you will have to invest a lot of time in yourself.\n\nTaking care of your skin and hair. Remember to take your beauty sleep in time and drink lots of water. Avoid alcohol and smoking, as they affect the skin. Promote yourself with various institutions and companies. It is important to understand that some agencies will approach you positively and others will reject you. This does not mean that you’re not a good model. All what it means is that your profile probably does not match the profile of the agency or it is not what they are looking for at this time. You must have a thick skin and be able to handle rejection.\n\nRemember, the hardest part is the first step. Getting self-confidence and faith in your self. Once you are started it will become easier and easier while you get more recognition within the industry.\n\nThank you for reading, Stephan Fouquaert\n\nWe tend to judge Images of other photographers in a split second. However estimating the quality and value of our own picture is far more difficult and complex.\n\nFortunately, you can judge the quality of your work as long as you are able to be critical.\n\nHow to recognize a good photo?\n\nOver time the initial enthusiasm of a new image is replaced by doubt and mind bottling questions. “ Is this a good photo? , What will other people really think? Should I present it to someone, or should I get more out of it with editing? Maybe I need to use another shot?\n\nThe point is that one should question himself. Maybe you wonder if there’s a method to measure a picture against. Of course you could place a picture on an E-Forum, or a photography club; asking for feedback.\n\nOften pictures are dumped in cyberspace, followed with an avoidable disappointment. Teach yourself first to “ see images “ well before showing them to an audience.\n\nThe question is then; how do I become a better photographer and what makes my picture interesting to others.\n\nThrill of shooting\n\nThe “thrill of shooting” is the first obstacle when assessing own images. The feeling of that decisive moment , when pressing the shutter is in most cases far more exciting than the final result . Months later, when the excitement and recording context has evaporated, the picture has lost its appeal.\n\nThe opposite situation can also occur. A previously ignored picture suddenly becomes very special and you wonder why you have not spotted that picture in the first place.\n\nEven your heart you can get in the way. Especially when you have a special bond with the subject or topic. Babies are a typical example, no matter how bad the picture is. For the dad or mom the picture of their baby is always the best.\n\nPictures have several aspects that you do not see right away. Hence it is good practice to let your images ripe equally, Judge later\n\nI think that there are basically two main pillars of picture assessment; What do you want to portray, and How?\n\nA good picture must have thought of both, and both should be well developed.\n\nLets assume that one masters the “How” skills and technical principles, able to control sharpness, contrast, exposure ,color and composition skills such as the rule of thirds.\n\nWhat you have photographed is as important and assuming that your image is technically good enough, it will make the difference between a boring and interesting picture.\n\nCriticism to the rescue:\n\nShooting in your spare time is in the first place something that you should be happy about. That happiness can be amplified when a picture becomes interesting for others, nothing beats the feeling of been a creator. A little knowledge about what makes pictures interesting will leverage your work. Of course, the latter is different for everyone.\n\nNo, there is no instrument or checklist for the quality of a photograph. Yet models have been developed by art and art historians. Which are basically meant for art criticism. The good thing is that we as photographers can take advantage of it and learn .\n\nThe disadvantage of these models is that they are perhaps immature. Photography is still too young for a well-developed theory of aesthetics in an image.\n\nArt historians are late in turning their attention to the evolution of photography as an artistic form. However, we can ask the question “ Does photography create substantially different aesthetic expectations than other and older art forms? “ .\n\nI don’t think so, the needs are strikingly common to all visual presentations.\n\nTherefore, the most important factors in determining the success of a picture is essentially the same as that of drawings and paintings.\n\nAt the end, it is the human will that fixes the eye .\n\nSo what makes a great picture different? The Six Continua, some call it “criteria of excellence” or even “The six scales”.\n\n“Criteria of excellence”\n\nThese scales run from lowest quality (low) to maximum quality (high). Corresponding numbers do not exist. After all, these continua are definitions based on quality factors defining a photographic image.\n\nThe six scales are: (1) from superficial to deep, (2) from optical to tangible, (3) pattern to idea, (4), from part to a whole, (5) to remarkably universal and (6) of registration to original.\n\nThe first two place the emphasis on the technical quality of an image.\n\nFrom scale three onwards the creativity is at play. If you score high on one of these scales, then you can already conclude that you made an interesting picture.\n\nThe more scales you control, the better. Performs your image on all six fronts well, then you have delivered a masterpiece!\n\nMind you, the scales may not be as easy to use for any type of photography.\n\n(1) From superficial to deep\n\nIt is not about the depth of field , it is all about the volume of the shapes in your image. Lacking volume makes a picture superficial, thin or light. Usually we speak of a “flat” pictures.\n\nShapes and objects in an image should have mass or weight, which gives a photographic image depth. And depth is what a man expects to see – after all through our eyes we perceive depth.\n\nIn other words, as a photographer we have to be able to create three-dimensional volumes. This can also be achieved with different gradations of light. Depth quality should be present in each picture, whether it’s a studio portrait, a landscape or a sports photo.\n\nThe questions to ask : Does my photo has enough depth? For example, did I choose an unique position, or did I shoot from eye level? Is there any perspective in my picture? Do I show shapes with volume or mass?\n\n(2) From optical to tangible\n\nPhotography captures reality from a visual standpoint. Bringing ‘tangible’ reality in an image needs detail and light gradations. A painter has the advantage of the paintbrush bringing light and shadows to perfection with a stroke. Photoshop is a tool that can come to the rescue, but then there should be plenty of visual detail in the original image. Therefore, one should always look for an optimal balance between lights and darks, so as to preserve the visual facts and texture in the image at the moment of the capture.\n\nAdding too much detail, for example with high dynamic range (HDR), is dangerous. Excessive manipulation makes the image artificial, non-photographic. A good picture still feels like the product of vision. In other words, the palpability of origin of an image has to be photographically.\n\nAsk yourself: Has the picture sufficient detail, is there a play of light and darkness? Is subject realistic and made practically palpable?\n\n(3) From pattern to idea\n\nA picture that is completely dedicated to a pattern is an everyday feat for a camera. Simply capture patterns, or only display technology, is soon photographic kitsch.\n\nImages must retain our attention they must mean something. Otherwise we just look at a blank ornament and forget quickly.\n\nSo , search for a meaning , new idea’s. Nature can be aesthetically interesting when natural processes and intervention of the human creates a composition of motifs and finds, think about industrial patterns and nature.\n\nAsk yourself: Do I show more than a technique? Maybe I’m just trying to meet expectations, but lacking own ideas?\n\n(4) From part to whole\n\nA camera can only catch a fragment of the surroundings . The photographer captures a part of a bigger thing, something incomplete. The art is to trick the viewer so that he believes to sees the whole thing. By selecting the important feature of a subject and frame the subject so that it is part of a separate universe. Choosing the essential detail is crucial. It is important that the viewer feels the totality of a situation by only observing a fraction of the scene.\n\nQuestions: Do I show the essentials and no more than that? Are there no disruptive, distracting elements or useless areas in the image? Has everything shown a function? Is the composition OK? Are the various motifs in balance to each other and are “none essential elements been truncated?”\n\n(5) From noteworthy to universal\n\nA camera has relatively easy access to exotic and quirky subjects. Feeding the peoples curiosity with foreign or bizarre situations. But you must do more than capturing grotesque business. And it should not be perverted. Look from a positive angle for universal qualities in people even when they are suffering from exclusion or ugliness.\n\nThis scale is particularly relevant to photojournalism or documentary photography. Capture the decisive moment.\n\nThe questions you can ask : What is the picture all about? Does it tell a story that others can recognize? Does it show the decisive moment?\n\nThings that rank high on the scale of remarkable to universal are fear, anxiety and anger things we all feel as recognizable.\n\n(6) From registration to original\n\nAn ordinary picture shows what was captured at a specific time, it is a simple registration of a moment in time. An original photograph shows a fresh discovery. That means going after something new, refreshing.\n\nIt is not enough for a photographer just to be there with a camera, he/she has to be there as a person. Original photographs are created from a combination of alertness to the unusual – an instinctive recognition of images that tell something new. Be allergic to clichés and stereotypes. Maybe we have seen an object, place or situation a thousand times, so shoot it again as an revelation, a new image of it.\n\nQuestions: Do I have a picture that no one else has? Is it unique and not to common? In other words, Did I made a distinctive, original photograph?\n\nHow to apply the six scales to your own photos?\n\nApplying the whole model on your own recordings will be uncomfortable at first. Try to practice on others, for example; books by famous photographers and publishers. Find strong photos and walk the picture through all scales . Because these pictures already have gone through a selection process, they probably score well on several points.\n\nAt some point you will begin to recognize the big picture.\n\nFor example make a macro photo an of insect. And rate it.\n\nA good macro picture comes to life through the mass of the beast (scale 1). That creature should be naturally sharp and detailed , it comes to life and thus becomes tangible (2). You surprise the viewer with something interesting what he sees normally (3). Show a heavily magnified part of the whole, a universe as large as a matchbox. Hopefully you have thereby made a peaceful composition of the animal against a natural background, without distracting elements (4). In one example show that the world is full of this kind of particular animals (5).\n\nThe biggest challenge is, as with any photo in scale 6: is the photo original? Some critics believe that macro photography is precisely an example of “once is enough”.\n\nFocus on your knowledge\n\nMuch will depend on whether you have created your own, original photograph. Today everyone can use the same sophisticated equipment, your vision as a photographer becomes therefore the distinctive aspect of your creations. The eyes, fingers and wrist of a painter are unique and determine to a large extent his work of art. That is much less in the hands of the photographer around the lens and the shutter.\n\nHowever your visual and intellectual ‘equipment’ is key . A camera has not (yet) an integrated selection mechanism to take a picture at the right time, and does not move automatically to a good position. So the decision to shoot is still a creative act.\n\nGood images are a testament to your knowledge, besides your technical skill.\n\nSearching for evidence\n\nIn short, you must have something to tell, transmit an idea, and thereby demonstrate a wisdom that is different than that of others. It is therefore important to use more and a better framing reality, literally and figuratively, shoot pictures on your own reality.\n\nIt’s true that most of the images are evaluated in a fraction of a second, sometimes more with the stomach than for the purpose. But for a proper assessment of an image you need insight into techniques, plus a broad knowledge of the art form.\n\nThanks for reading, Steve Fouquaert\n\nThe radio trigger paradigm – Broncolor RFS2.1 & Phase One Flash Sync issues\n\nThe Broncolor Move Flash Pack system, and the RFS 2.1 radio trigger seemed a great idea combined with the Phase One 645DF+ camera/IQ160 and leaf shutter lenses. A great combo, allowing flash sync speeds of up to 1/1600 second. And yet there are often surprises.\n\nWhy use flash sync at high speed in the first place ?\n\nWorking in full sunlight, with objects against a bright background requires special measures.\n\nFirst of all we need to adjust the exposure of the subject and secondly we want the keep the background brightness under control. In other words, the objects requires more light, where as the background will require less light.\n\nThe sensor should be exposed in such a way that the object is properly lit while keeping the bright background under control. Who does not know those picture where a person stands in front of a bright sky, and appears like a silhouette without details.\n\nThe only way out is to use a fill-in flash, lighting the subject. But even then the ambient light (bright sky, background) will can be blown out. The reason is simple, the flash duration is very short versus the CDD exposure time (shutter speed). Ambient light will continue to hit the sensor during the shutter open time. If that light is bright it will burn out those area’s despite the fact that the subject is now properly lit. One could increase the shutter speed to reduce the effect of the ambient light, or we could stop down the aperture.\n\nNeither one will do the job; first the shutter speed is limited when using a flash, since the flash sync is typical between 1/64 to 1/250 second and that is still to slow allowing too much ambient light to fall onto the CCD. Stopping down the aperture is an alternative, however it destroys the shallow depth of field.\n\nThere is however a solution, using a camera that is capable of shooting at high shutter speeds and normal flash sync. Not to be confused with hyper sync or high speed sync (see my other write up). Flash sync is defined as the time the CCD is fully exposed with a shutter (curtains) that are fully open.\n\nPhase One 645DF+ Camera’s allow for flash sync speeds of 1/800 second for the focal plane shutter and an additional 1/800 seconds in combination with a leaf shutter lens. Providing whopping 1/1600-second shutter speed sync.\n\nNow we can reduce the shutter open time to reduce the ambient light while retaining a shallow depth of field, right?\n\nYes and no, when I tried the Flash sync with the Broncolor Move pack and the Phase One 645DF+, I noticed that while I was speeding up the shutter, the pictures were losing exposure. The flashback was untouched and set a 600 Watt/s. A faster shutter setting (below or equal to 1/1600sec) affected the exposure of the picture more and more.\n\nIt took me a while before I realized what was happening:\n\nThe Broncolor Move is triggered with a radio transmitter fitted on the hot shoe of the Phase One Camera. It is the RFS2.1. This specific transmitter has a delay of 425 microseconds. Could that affect the loss if exposure?\n\nIndeed , a 1/1600 shutter flash sync speed exposes the full CCD to the light for 625 micro seconds. As soon as the CCD is fully exposed (shutters fully open) the hot shoe creates a short . Flagging that a flash is needed. The RFS2.1 Broncolor transmitter has a transmission delay of the flash to 425 microseconds. That leaves a very small window for the actual flash pulse (200microseconds). The Flash pulse must fit within the remaining 200 microseconds. After that the shutter starts to close . If the flash pulse is exceeding the 200 micro seconds, then that light is lost.\n\nBroncolor Move packs have a flash duration that varies with the selected power as indicated below (figures for eco mode):\n\n1200 watt/s = 2667 microseconds\n\n600 watt/s = 1143 microseconds\n\n300 watt/s =763 microseconds\n\n150 watt/s = 465 microseconds\n\n75 watt/s = 382 microseconds\n\n38 watt/s = 333 microseconds\n\n18 watt/s = 267 microseconds\n\n9 watt/s = 190 microseconds\n\n5 watt/s = 143 microseconds\n\nAs can be seen, a power setting bigger then 9 Watt/s will result in the flash pulse to fall partial outside the 200 microsecond window. Hence the shutter will start to close before the flash is fully completed. The result is an incorrect exposure.\n\nGoing through the same calculation without a radio delay , and using a flash-cord creates a flash window of 625 microseconds. Hence power settings on the pack above 150 Watts will start to have some exposure loss.\n\nOf course at lower flash sync speeds the problem is far less of an issue. The only solution is to use either the flash cord or the build-in profoto radio trigger.\n\nThe V-grip of the 645DF+, contains the radio trigger and can be set to “fast” mode. In the fast mode the trigger/transmitter in the V-grip is constant on and as such does not incur a transmission delay like the Broncolor trigger RFS 2.1 .\n\nShooting with other pack types and radio triggers will have a similar problem, the best thing is always to check the transmitter delay and knowing your flash pulse behavior as outlined in this text.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nSteve\n\nTaking the nonsense out of Flash sync and High Speed Flash sync.\n\nI have been reading several articles on the Internet regarding the Flash Synchronization on DSLR’s and Mid Format cameras.\n\nThere are those that state that Mid Format camera such as the Phase One 645DF+ and others can achieve flash sync up to 1/16000 second, where as 35mm DSLR are limited around 1/250 second.\n\n(Note that these values are just examples and can vary between vendors)\n\nDSLR users state that they can achieve the same. Well reality is that they can and cannot. DSLR’s can use flash at higher speeds then the normal 1/250 second limit by using a special method called “Hyper Speed Sync or High Speed Flash”. Obviously that is not the same as standard flash synchronization.\n\nWhat is flash sync?\n\nIt is very simple, it is the time that the sensor is fully exposed to the light, and hence the shutter is fully open. Meaning that the first and second curtain (in case of a focal plane shutter) are fully open. That time is determent by the shutter speed setting.\n\nA shutter speed set at 1/1000 second, exposes the sensor in full for 1millisecond to the light. Within that time window the flash pulse must ignite and complete.\n\nFlash pulses are powerful bursts of light with a very short duration and defined by a T0.1 and T0.5 value. For example a broncolor move pack produce a flash pulse of 763 microseconds at 300 Watt/s.\n\nAs long as the pulse fits in the window, a proper exposure will be achieved.\n\nWhat is High-Speed Flash sync?\n\nDifferent vendors use different names for this, some call it hyper speed or high-speed flash. It allows for higher shutter speeds then the standard physical limitation of the shutter mechanism. The shutter mechanism in many DSLR’s consists of two mechanical curtains that open and close. And because they are mechanical they have a finite speed to open and close.\n\nNote that today some sensors are equipped with an electronic shutter instead of a mechanical version.\n\nHowever the majority of DSLR’s is equipped with a mechanical focal shutter. The flash sync is limited to 1/64 to 1/250 sec. (variations do exist between the different brands and models).\n\nTo achieve higher shutter speeds, the flash pulse is modified. The Flash is no longer a single high power pulse but is now chopped into multiple lower flash pulses extending over time. The sensor is no longer exposed in full (both curtains fully open) as was the case with normal flash sync. Instead the two curtains move over the sensor with a small opening/gap between them. During this move the flash unit transmits multiple pulses of light so that each part of the sensor is equally lit.\n\nIt is not uncommon to find High-speed flash implementations on DSLR’s up to 1/1000s. However that method only works when a compatible flash unit is used e.g. Nikon SB series.\n\nIs the result the same?\n\nNear equal results can be achieved, that is to say both the high end mid format camera’s with flash sync up to 1/1600sec and the consumer/semi pro DSLR’s can acquire captures at high speed. However there are several other aspects to be looked at.\n\nIt is these aspects that make the difference between a Pro Mid format camera and a 35 mm DSLR.\n\nMaximum Power:\n\nA flashback has a maximum power level by design, that is to say that a flash unit can only produce a certain amount of joules or Watt second. A studio flash pack will produce much more power (e.g. 1200 Watt second) then a standard speed light or the build-in flash in the camera.\n\nIn other words the flash unit is limited in power.\n\nCameras with flash sync at high shutter speeds use the full power of the flash pulse, since the flash only fires once within the capture time.\n\nCameras with High Speed Sync must level out the flash power over multiple mini flashes and time. There is no time to recharge the flash within a capture period. That means that the flash intensity is seriously reduced, and can become an issue in certain light conditions.\n\nIn short, Flash Sync can use the maximum power of a flash unit, High Speed Sync CAN NOT use the full power for the exposure.\n\nBattery Live and Flash power issues:\n\nLets assume the following. An object requires 300 Watt/s exposure with a shutter speed of 1/1000 second.\n\nThe flash sync method when triggered will ignite a single Flash pulse at 300Watts/s\n\nThe High Speed Flash sync method will ignite 4 flash pulses (assuming the physical limit of the shutter mechanism is 1/250s). Each pulse must produce 300Watt/s to equally illuminate the different areas of the sensor. That means that the flash unit must be charged at 1200Watt/second.\n\nHence , High Speed Sync reduces the battery live considerable and limits the Flash power capabilities.\n\nStudio packs:\n\nStudio packs and monoblock flash units generally do not have the capability to generate High Speed Flash pulses. Instead they are engineered around a single short flash pulse with very stable light temperatures and defined T0.1 and T0.5 pulse wave shapes. High Speed Sync camera methods are generally not useable.\n\nSecondly studio packs with battery are often used on location with powerful lights (>1200Watt/s). If a High Speed Sync method was applied, then the pack had to have huge batteries and would become to heavy and to restrictive.\n\nSpeedlight’s typically support High Speed Sync in combination with a branded DSLR. However seriously constrained in power and battery life\n\nMotion Capture:\n\nShooting pictures with flash will freeze the movement of the object independent from the shutter speed (assuming that the ambient light is neglectable. It is the duration of the Flash Pulse that will freeze the movement. It is not uncommon to find flash units with flash durations of 1/10.000 second or 100microseconds.\n\nFlash Sync at 1/1600s (shutter is open 625 microseconds) will freeze the motion in one single instance. That is the moment in time when the flash ignites , locking down the motion for the duration of the flash. If the flash duration was 1/5000 sec then the motion is captured for 200 microseconds.\n\nHigh Speed Flash Sync at 1/1600s with a DSLR with physical shutter limitation of 1/250 second will require (4000 micro seconds/625micro seconds) about 7 mini flashes spread over 4 millisecond (shutter physical speed limitation). That means that different areas of the sensor will be exposed on different times and hence the final picture can look awkward and jerky for fast moving objects.\n\nWhat is better?\n\nA difficult answer, it all depends on how you apply photography. For some the High Speed Sync limitations will not be an issue, where as for others it has serious constrains.\n\nPersonally I use both, for my studio and location work that requires day by night shots with a shallow depth of field I will use the mid format camera capabilities to achieve high shutter speeds with standard flash synchronization. For other events such as real life events, I use my DSLR and speed lights in High Speed Sync mode.\n\nOne thing is fore sure, 35mm DSLR’s do not have the capability that Mid format camera’s have in terms of Flash sync at high shutter speeds. Instead they have a work around to simulate that capability. The results can be similar but the use is very constrained.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nSteve\n\nPhase One digital backs are so versatile, and that is one of the reason why I do like them so much. Some months ago I procured an old Cambo DS Wide technical camera fitted with a 57mm analogue lens and a 4×5 glass plate back.\n\nI decided to create a hybrid system, combining the analogue Cambo/lens with my IQ140 back.\n\nIntended to create a super-duper virtual sensor. The Cambo with the 57mm lens (analogue) projects a circle of light with a diameter of more then 153mm. And since the camera is a technical camera it can shift 20mm left /right and up/down while staying in the projected circle of light. This creates in turn a virtual sensor of 73 mm x 84mm or 14000 x 12172 (170Mpx)Pixels .\n\nOf course I will need to shift L/R-U/D for the ultimate picture (9 shots). Some will say “Not much different then a standard Panorama shot ”, yes indeed. But with that difference that I do not lose any pixels in the stitch processes and everything is tight controlled as the X and Y axis’s are determined by the Technical Camera mechanics.\n\nI had one concern, the resolution factor of the analogue lens (lines per millimeter) and the associated airy disks. But then again I am resolving a view onto a 73mm x 84mm surface versus a 32,9mm x43,9mm sensor. So I can afford to have less effective pixels (defraction). The first test shots are not that bad in terms of resolution.\n\nHowever shooting takes a bit of time and getting used to, as everything is manual. But then again it makes you feel like a real photographer (whatever “real” means).\n\nHere are the processes of taking a shot, and once again the IQ features are so helpful.\n\n[b][i]Placement: (IQ X and Y axis’s on display)[/i][/b]\n\nIt all starts with having a correct vertical and horizontal axes, an easy thing to do as the Cambo has several glass level/air bubble gauges. To be double checked by the IQ’s vertical and horizontal level indicators (backs display).\n\n[b][i]Framing (with the IQ back live view and Horizontal/Vertical level indicators):[/i][/b]\n\nPosition the IQ in the central position of the camera (X=0,Y=0), no shifts.\n\nIn IQ live view , and the lens set to open (button to open the shutter) move the X and Y shift positions of Cambo to +20mm and -20mm; this provides an impression of the total framing. Adjust the tripod position so that the final aggregated capture is what is wanted. In bright environments the aperture needs to be stopped down (higher F number) so that the back does not get over exposed (if the light is to strong, the live view will look awkward with black patches, magenta streaks and lines).\n\n[b][i]Measuring the light (check with the IQ’s preview histogram and burn-out mask):[/i][/b]\n\nWith the ISO set on the DB, measure the light on the subject. I use a seconic 758 lightmeter, this allows me to aim (look through the light meter) at the high and low lights and get the readout of the aperture and shutter speed. Since the IQ has 12.5 stops of dynamic range and the high and low measured values are know the best aperture/shutter speed can be determined. There is nothing to be set on the DB besides the ISO. The lens of the camera is adjusted for aperture and shutter speed as calculated.\n\nFirst test shot to check the exposure:\n\nThe shutter is armed (on the lens) and the “Wake-up” signal is triggered from the little pushbutton on the cord attached to the IQ. Within four seconds, the shutter needs to be triggered by depressing the mechanical shutter release knob on the lens. The lens has a copal shutter and creates the “Capture” signal as long as the shutter is open. Once the shutter is closed, the contact is opened and the IQ recognizes the end of the capture. Checking the light with the IQ is easy, just view the picture and turn on the “high-light” warning mask. The Histogram is the second tool to look at. Adjust, as needed the shutter or aperture.\n\n[b][i]Focus and Sharpness (IQ sharpness mask and live view);[/i][/b]\n\nThe Live view is not the best method to start; I tend to use a “laser based” distance meter as used in construction work ( Bosh DLE50) . It measures the distance between the object focus point and the DB sensor plane. The lens is then adjusted accordingly (distance markers are on the lens) by turning the ring to the right distance. This should get the focus fairly close to where it should be.\n\nThe sharpness is checked in live view on the back while zooming in (on the back – 100%). The lens is fine adjusted if needed (can be hard to see in live view).\n\nThe best verification is an actual test shot and view it with Sharpness mask applied on the IQ (unless you are shooting tethered) .\n\n[b][i]Ready to shoot (LCC and capture one);[/i][/b]\n\nEasy, just shoot nine times (no more camera or back adjustments). One picture per position (moves are with the TC Horizontal and Vertical shift wheels). For each new position, a capture of an opaque plexi glass (Phase One provided) is required. This allows Lens Color Cast correction for each picture taken in post processing.\n\n[b][i]Final;[/i][/b]\n\nAll shots are taken, and the pictures are LCC corrected in Capture One Pro 7.2. Once complete the stitching can start by selecting the 9 pictures (with LCC correction) , click on the top bar right stitch Icon in CO. That will start the Photoshop “Photo merge” process. Note that it only works for CS 3-6. If you use CC it will not work. For CC you can export the pictures from CO and then open CC manual and start the work.\n\nI really have enjoyed this work, however I still wonder what the effect would be with a Digitar Lens.\n\nClick to see in full ( is still a reduced file 2/3 of original – 45Mb , takes some time to load)\n\n[i]First test shot without LCC and only one axis’s movement (3 pict[/i])\n\nComments / recommendations more then welcome .\n\nSteve\n\nConverting a 4×5 analogue Technical Camera to digital.\n\nIntro\n\nI love to shoot architectural structures; a Technical Camera (TC) is a necessity-enabling raise, fall and shift functions for correct registration.\n\nTechnical Camera’s\n\nMany of those TC’s are really for studio work and rather bulky, my preferred TC would be an Arc Swiss or Cambo. A new TC is not really an option, architectural photography is not my full time occupation, hence the return on investment could be years if ever. I opted for a solid second hand analogue TC. There are plenty of TC’s on the market for reasonable prices. Finally I found a Cambo DS Wide from 2006 for as little as 2700 euro. With a Sneider super angulon 5.6/58mm and an 4×5 analogue back with glass plate, view finder and documentation. A good buy for a camera in such an excellent state.\n\nA cunning plan, a super-duper virtual digital sensor\n\nThe intend is to convert the Cambo, more specific replacing the glass plate and mound a Phase One IQ-140 back on it (mid format digital back). The digital sensor of the IQ-140 is 44 mm by 33 mm. The Cambo with Lens provides an image circle that easily covers a 100 mm by 120mm surface. The idea is to use the raise/fall and shift left/right capabilities of the TC to expose the digital back in multiple locations. The Cambo allows for a 20mm movement in each direction from the center place. By taking a shot in each of the 9 positions, I can acquire a real large digital picture of 84mm by 73mm or virtually double the mid format digital sensor format with an abundance of pixels. Lens cast and luminance drop off will certainly be an issue, however that can be compensated with an LCC adjustment. By taking a shot of the white LCC Plexiglas plate for each new position of the back. Lens Cast Correction will be executed in post processing (Capture One 7 Pro) prior to the stich operations of all 9 shots.\n\nMounting a Phase One Digital back.\n\nI contacted Cambo and explained what I wanted to do, so far there was no problem and a special adaptor plate WD614 was available for the PO Digital Back. Not cheap, 870 Euro for a piece of fine machined aluminum. Two weeks later I received the adaptor. I removed the glass plate fixture and mounted the adaptor. It all fitted perfectly. Finally I mounted IQ-140. Ready for the first test. What a disappointment, it was impossible to acquire sharpness. No matter how much I turned in and out the lens.\n\nBack to the drawing table\n\nWhat could be the cause of the lack of focus, there isn’t that much that can go wrong. It’s a matter of simple physics as long as the IQ-140 digital back is in the same exact place as the glass plate. I compared both distances “glass versus adaptor plate”. It turned out that the adaptor plate was 10mm short, no wonder that it didn’t work.\n\nI contacted Cambo and explained the situation; very quickly they confirmed that the wrong adaptor was delivered. The WDS614 is matched for “Digitar lenses” . Since I used an analogue Lens the focal plane is much further then for a “Digitar Lens”, as what I expected. I got two options, change the lens plane and by a new “Digitar lens” while keeping the adaptor or return the WDS614 and obtain the WDS508 matched for analogue lenses.\n\nIt’s not just a matter of money.\n\nA new Digitar Lens will cost 3500 euro, were as the new adaptor plate for the current analogue lens is 330 euro cheaper then the current adaptor plate. However the Digitar Lens will not give the freedom to move around the back as much as with the analogue lens. Since the area of coverage is tuned towards the sensor format.\n\nSome will say that the resolution factor of the analogue lens will not be good enough for a digital sensor as it is limited in the amount of lines it can resolve (film 100x120mm versus a CCD at 44x33mm) , it would require a resolution power which is 3x bigger, expressed in lines per millimeter.\n\nChromatic Aberration is another issue. Yet my plan is to use the analogue lens and a virtual large CCD (IQ140) by moving the IQ140 into nine different positions. That should hopefully compensate the resolution factor issue. The aberration and light fall off will be compensated through the LCC adjustments in Capture One Pro 7. The new adaptor plate is on order, can’t wait to see if my theory will work.\n\nWaking up the Digital Back.\n\nThe next challenge is how to get he IQ140 Digital Back awake. Phase One backs use a dormant architecture, only when a picture is imminent the back is powered on by a Wake-Up signal. Normally that is an electronic and automatic communication between the digital back and the Camera Body. However in this case we are talking about a dumb piece of precise aluminum, the Cambo. There are no electronics. The only available signal is the Exposure / Capture pulse from the Copal shutter in the lens. The Copal shutter provides a DC closure during the shutter “open” state e.g. 1/125 sec. (Shutter is in the lens).\n\nFlagging the Digital Back when the capture/exposure starts and stops.\n\nThe IQ140 digital back requires a second signal called the “Capture Signal” . Identifying when the shutter is open and when it closes, or the end of the capture. The Copal shutter in the analogue lens does exactly that. It places an electrical short for the duration of the shutter time e.g. 1/60sec.\n\nCombing “Wake-up” and “Capture” signals for the Digital back.\n\nThe Digital Back needs both, first a wake-up pulse to activate the Digital back and followed within 5 seconds the Capture signal for the duration of the shutter time. Two states with one control point “ the Copal shutter contact”. The solution is a “two-step cord”, connecting the Copal shutter contact to the Digital Back with a parallel manual Wake-up button.\n\nThe method is simple:\n\nMeasure the light and adjust the camera settings (diaphragm and shutter speed). The Cambo cannot measure; it is done with a handheld light meter.\n\nAdjust the ISO on the digital back if needed and set the wake-up speed to normal (on the IQ series).\n\nArm the shutter on the lens\n\nDepress the “Wake-up” button on the two step cable (this makes an electrical short and the back wakes up.\n\nRelease the shutter within 5 seconds after the wake-up action.\n\nThe Copal shutter creates a second electrical short circuit for the duration of the shutter “open” time and is used as the capture signal on the Digital Back.\n\nLots of fun isn’t it. That is what real photography is all about. I hope to be able to show some captures real soon (once I have the correct adaptor plate).\n\nThe future will tell if I had it right or wrong, although I am convinced that it will work.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nSteve\n\nMy favorite feature of Capture One RAW processing software is the ability to create a website with Capture One Pilot.\n\nSo that during the shoot, people from allover the world can rate and select the pictures over the Internet.\n\nI think it is a great collaboration tool. No more E-mail’s or placement of proofing pictures on another websites and/or cloud infrastructures. It is all under your control.\n\nThe method explains how to create such a feature using your own private Wi-Fi / LAN with an Internet facing router .\n\nSteps :\n\nCreate a URL and Dynamic DNS:\n\n(a)- Obtain a URL for example (http://) mysite.zapto.org , and arrange a DNS (domain name service).\n\nIf you want that clients can surf your C1 webserver (Capture Pilot), the first thing you must do is to arrange for a domain and Hostname. This will allow people to google and / or browse to a name instead of an IP address.\n\nFor example: http://mysite.zapto.org versus 10.11.123.19 .\n\nThere are many free DNS services on the Internet, where you can create your Host and Domain Name. The free service will let you assign a host of your choice such as “mysite” and the domain name “zapto.org” will be limited. Unless you want to buy your own domain name.\n\nThe Dynamic DNS service that I find very good is http://www.noip.com , where you first create an account, once created you will get an E-mail for confirmation.\n\nThen login on the link given in the E-mail and create your host “mysite” and select a free of charge domain name such as “zapto.org” .\n\nSample screen Dynamic DNS setup\n\nThe second thing you need to do is to make sure that your public IP address (that is the IP address that is assigned by your service provider to your internet facing router) is assigned and known to the Dynamic DNS. That means that your public IP address will be coupled to the just created URL “mysite.zapto.org”\n\nYour ISP changes your public IP address at regular times or when you reboot your Internet router (some, use static IP’s such as large cooperations). In order to update the Dynamic DNS service (if your public IP address changes) you will have to configure your router for Dynamic DNS. However there is an easier way, and that is using a little app (harmless) from the http://www.noip.com site called “No-IP DUC” and install it on your mac or pc.\n\nSample screen Dynamic DNS app download\n\nThis app will update the dynamic DNS at regular times, so that you don’t have to worry about changing Public IP addresses. It will even work if you travel to another site.\n\nNow you have an URL that is coupled to your public IP address, and is updated automatically.\n\nSample of a running DUCon your mac/pc,of course your IP addresses will be different\n\nTesting your just created URL:\n\n1. Surf to a NSLOOKUP service like http://centralops.net/co/NsLookup.aspx and fill out the URL you created.\n\n2. Click on the go button and you should see your public IP address popping up. That means that your home router is now reachable with the just assigned URL\n\nDNS Look-up, your IP address and name will be different\n\n(b) -The next step is to forward the http traffic from your Internet facing router to your mac or PC.\n\nThe first thing to do is to make sure that your mac or PC has a fixed IP address, normally it will use DHCP, a dynamic assignment of an IP address to your MAC or PC from a range you specified on your home router. Those IP addresses are called Private IP addresses and look like 192.168.x.x .\n\nLogin to your router: allocate for your PC or MAC a fixed IP address instead of DHCP.(see your router manual, it is an easy thing to do). Then assign to your mac or pc the same fixed private IP address as you did on the router and set the default gateway to the private IP address of your router. (do this under your network properties)\n\nTesting your mac/pc with a static IP address:\n\nTry to google a site, it should work. If not then you might have made an error on the assignment of the private IP addresses.\n\nArrange Port Forwarding:\n\nArrange “port forwarding” on your router. This will allow the traffic that is presented at your router Internet facing port to be forwarded to your Private IP address of your PC/MAC where the C1 Capture Pilot is running.\n\nSelect a port number (is a number that identifies what the next protocol is , for example http = port 80). I recommend to use a free port number that is not assigned to a specific application. Port 9000 is one of them (if you want to use another, google for free port numbers).\n\nLogin to your router and find “LAN servers or NAT/PAT or Port Forwarding” in the menu (check your router manual on port forwarding).\n\nIn the forwarding menu, do the following as per your router syntax :\n\nIncoming port 9000 forward to IP address of your MAC /PC with port 9000 for TCP\n\nBelow a sample of a port forwarding set-up, your might look different.\n\nMake sure that if you have a firewall running on your router that it allows incoming connections. If it does not, then add a pinhole for traffic to your PC/MAC and only for port 9000\n\nConfiguring Capture 1 pilot on the Capture one software\n\n(c)- Almost there:\n\nNow start your C1 application, and configure the Capture One pilot for WEB services. Tick the boxes you like to use (Color,rating). Set a Password and set the Port to 9000.\n\nSet the site name to what you configured in the Dynamic DNS e.g mysite.zapto.org\n\n(d)- Now you are ready to roll, time after time .\n\nInform your clients about the URL http://mysite.zapto.org:9000\n\nDon’t forget the :9000 as that defines the port.\n\nYou can use the little envelope icon to mail out the info to your clients, however that is not really working since it mails out the private IP address of your mac or pc that runs C1. And that IP address is not reachable from the internet, that is why I use a DynamicDNS. It would be great if PO could change this. I will make a feature request on that aspect. Never the less you can still use it and modify the details inside the email.\n\nIt just works great for me. Enjoy"
