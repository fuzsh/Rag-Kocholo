        "text": "OUR HERITAGE\n\nFounded by Donald Wentzel in 1958, Maple Leaf Farms started out as a small duck operation in Northern Indiana dedicated to producing products with \"quality you can count on.” In its first year, the company produced only 280,000 ducks. Today, Maple Leaf Farms has grown its annual duck production to more than 9-12 million.\n\nWentzel was convinced that the U.S. duck industry could grow significantly if the right care was put into it. Although he passed away in 1968, Wentzel imparted this vision to his son-in-law, Terry Tucker, who has been with the company since 1963. Under Tucker's leadership, the company made several strategic moves to grow the business and become more vertically integrated, emerging as a market leader.\n\nIn 2001, Wentzel's grandsons, Scott and John Tucker, were named co-presidents of Maple Leaf Farms and leveraged the company's expertise into new business opportunities.\n\nToday, the fourth generation has joined the family business and together the Tucker family continues to set the direction for the company based on its values and commitment to family, community and, of course, quality products.\n\nMaple Leaf Farms is extremely proud of its heritage and the history we have made to become the leader in the duck industry."
