        "text": "Before we dive right into the different cannabis growth stages, let's cover a few important details about cannabis seeds. You may have heard the very common question, can you tell the sex of a cannabis seed?\" While there's currently no way to determine the sex of a seed by examination, there are companies that produce feminized seeds which are bred to provide a 99.9% chance of growing female.\n\nCannabis seeds remain inactive until they are exposed to water and light. They are relatively strong and survive well in dark, cool places such as refrigerators. It's important to note that if temperatures are too low or fall below freezing, cannabis seeds can become damaged or die. Cannabis plants are generally dioecious meaning that male and female reproductive organs are in separate individuals. However, sometimes cannabis plants demonstrate intersex characteristics and are referred to as hermies.\n\nFemales are the only cannabis plants with the ability to produce buds that can be harvested to smoke, vape, dab, and ingest. Male plants and hermies must be removed before the flowers open to ensure that your cannabis retains it is quality and remains free of seeds. When male or dual-sex plants grow together with females, they pollinate them causing the females to stop using their energy to feed buds and start focusing on producing seeds which results in reduced and sometimes ruined bud harvest.\n\nNow that there's a more clear understanding of cannabis seeds and how to properly care for and maintain, lets talk about the stages of cannabis growth!\n\nCannabis Growth Timeline\n\n1. Germinating: 1-7 days\n\n2. Seedling: 2-3 weeks\n\n3. Vegetative: 2-8 weeks\n\n4. Pre-Flowering: 1-2 weeks\n\n5. Flowering: 6-8 weeks\n\n6. Harvesting\n\nCannabis plants that are cultivated indoors are easily impacted by even tiny fluctuations in climate. Indoor grow rooms and facilities that don't implement air circulation can experience stagnant air pockets, rapid humidity changes, and CO2 depletion. Grow spaces with uncontrolled humidity are at a higher risk of mold, mildew, and pest infestation while CO2 depletion can result in a nutrient lockout.\n\nAir filtration systems exchange and distribute air evenly throughout the grow space to create a well-balanced environment for proper plant development. CleanLeaf grow room air filtration systems are available in series with the systems in each series specifically designed to provide clean room environments, odor control, and smoke removal.
