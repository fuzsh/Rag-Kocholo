The V-Grip Air supports a Profoto Air flash trigger for wireless flash synchronization.\n\nThe 645DF+/645DF supports digital back interfaces including the IQ and P+ series digital backs as well as 3rd party digital backs from Hasselblad, Leaf, and others.\n\nIn 2012, Phase One released two specialty cameras: iXR which is made specifically for reproduction and iXA which is made specifically for aerial photography. Both uses the 645 lenses as the normal 645 cameras. The main difference on this camera is they have no viewfinder and very few mechanical moving parts.\n\nIn 2013, Phase One signed a collaborative distribution agreement with Digital Transitions (DT) to deliver advanced digitization solutions for cultural heritage preservation imaging projects worldwide (Repro camera solutions). This digitization equipment includes a multitude of reprographic equipment and camera stands, specialized stations for book copying, film scanning kits, and various accessories that are used for Phase One digital capture hardware and Capture One software.\n\nIn 2014, Phase One launched a medium format digital back with a CMOS/Active pixel sensor: The IQ250. All Phase One digital backs launched prior to the IQ250 have sensors based on the CCD (Charge-coupled device) technology.\n\nLenses\n\nPhase One Cameras are compatible with the following lenses:\n\nPhase One Digital focal plane lenses\n\nSchneider Kreuznach leaf shutter lenses\n\nMamiya 645 AF lenses\n\nMamiya 645 manual lenses /Phase one XF is not compatible with Mamiya 80mm f1.9/\n\nCompatible with Hasselblad V and Pentacon 6 lenses (via special adapter)\n\nManual Focus Mamiya Lenses Compatible with Phase One\n\nMamiya MF 24mm f/4 Fisheye\n\nMamiya MF 35mm f/3.5\n\nMamiya MF 45mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya MF 50mm f/4 Shift Lens\n\nMamiya MF 55-110mm f/4.5\n\nMamiya MF 80mm f/1.9 (not compatible with Phase one XF)\n\nMamiya MF 80mm f/4 Macro\n\nMamiya MF 105-210mm f/4.5\n\nMamiya MF 110mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya MF 120mm f/4 Macro\n\nMamiya MF 150mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya MF 150mm f/3.5\n\nMamiya MF 200mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya MF 200mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya MF 200mm f/4\n\nMamiya MF 300mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya MF 500mm f/4.5\n\nTC 2x MF\n\nAuto Focus Mamiya Lenses Compatible with Phase One\n\nMamiya AF 28mm f/4.5 Aspherical\n\nMamiya AF 35mm f/3.5\n\nMamiya AF 45mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya AF 55-110mm f/4.5\n\nMamiya AF 75-150mm f/4.5\n\nMamiya AF 80mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya AF 105-210mm f/4.5\n\nMamiya AF 120mm f/4 Macro\n\nMamiya AF 150mm f/2.8\n\nMamiya AF 150mm f/3.5\n\nMamiya AF 200mm f/4\n\nMamiya AF 300mm f/4.5\n\nPhase One branded Lenses, produced by Mamiya\n\nPhase One AF 28mm f/4.5 Aspherical\n\nPhase One AF 35mm f/3.5\n\nPhase One AF 45mm f/2.8\n\nPhase One AF 80mm f/2.8\n\nPhase One MF 120mm f/4 Macro\n\nPhase One AF 120mm f/4 Macro\n\nPhase One AF 150mm f/2.8\n\nPhase One AF 75-150mm f/4.5\n\nPhase One branded, produced by Hartblei\n\nPhase One MF 45mm f/3.5 T/S (Discontinued)\n\nSchneider Kreuznach Lenses for Phase One\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 28mm f/4.5 Aspherical\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 35mm f/3.5 Aspherical\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 40-80mm f/4-5.6\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 45mm f/3.5\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 55mm f/2.8\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 80mm f/2.8\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 110mm f/2.8\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 120mm f/4 Macro\n\nSchneider Kreuznach MF 120mm f/5.6 T/S\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 150mm f/3.5\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 240mm f/4.5 IF\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 75-150mm f/4.0-5.6\n\nSchneider Kreuznach 2X Teleconverter\n\nSchneider Kreuznach Blue Ring Lenses for Phase One\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 35mm f/3.5 Aspherical Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 40-80mm f/4-5.6 Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 45mm f/3.5 Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 55mm f/2.8 Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 80mm f/2.8 Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 110mm f/2.8 Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 120mm f/4 Macro Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach MF 120mm f/5.6 T/S Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 150mm f/2.8 Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 150mm f/3.5 Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 240mm f/4.5 IF Blue Ring\n\nSchneider Kreuznach LS 75-150mm f/4.0-5.6 Blue Ring\n\nDigital backs\n\nIQ4 Series\n\nModelSensor sizexSensor typeResolutionActive pixelsISO rangeDynamic range (Extended Mode / Normal)Frames per Second LS/FP (IIQs FPS)Lens conversion factorDisplayStorageHost connectionReleased IQ4 150MP53.4 × 40 mmCMOS151MP 16-bit14204 × 1065250–2560015/14.5 f-stops1.2 / 1.4 (2.5)13.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreenXQD and SD Card (CFExpress supported as of Firmware 8)USB-C, Ethernet and WiFi2018 IQ4 150MP Achromatic53.4 × 40 mmCMOS151MP 16-bit14204 × 10652200–10240015/14.5 f-stops1.2 / 1.4 (2.5)13.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreenXQD and SD Card (CFExpress supported as of Firmware 8)USB-C, Ethernet and WiFi2018 IQ4 100MP Trichromatic53.7 × 40.4 mmCMOS101MP 16-bit11608 × 870835–1280015 f-stops0.7 / 1.413.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreenXQD and SD Card (CFExpress supported as of Firmware 8)USB-C, Ethernet and WiFi2018\n\nIQ3 Series\n\nIQ2 Series\n\nModelSensor SizeSensor TypeResolution (Sensor+ Mode)Active PixelsISO range (Sensor+ Mode)Dynamic rangeFrames per Second (Sensor+ Mode)Lens conversion factorDisplayStorageHost ConnectionReleased IQ28053.7 x 40.4 mmCCD80 MP (20 MP), 16 bit10328 x 776035800 (140 -

It is the first camera to utilize a USB 3.0 interface. Also, it is the first camera to include a high-resolution multi-touch display, which is similar to the “Retina” screen used in the iPhone 4.\n\nModelSensor SizeSensor TypeResolution (Sensor+ Mode)Active PixelsISO range (Sensor+ Mode)Dynamic rangeFrames per Second (Sensor+ Mode)Lens conversion factorDisplayStorageHost ConnectionReleased odelSensor SizeSensor TypeResolution (Sensor+ Mode)Active PixelsISO range (Sensor+ Mode)Dynamic rangeFrames per Second (Sensor+ Mode)Lens conversion factorDisplayStorageHost ConnectionReleased IQ18053.7 x 40.4 mmCCD80 MP (20 MP), 16 bit10328 x 776035800 (140 - 3200)12.5 f-stops0.7 / (0.9)13.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreenCF up to UDMA 6IEE1394b Firewire800 andUSB3 / USB22011 IQ16053.9 x 40.4 mmCCD60.5 MP (15 MP), 16 bit8984 x 673250800 (200 - 3200)12.5 f-stops1.0 / (1.4)13.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreenCF up to UDMA 6IEE1394b Firewire800 andUSB3 / USB22011 IQ15044.0 x 33.0 mmCMOS50.0 MP(N/A), 16 bit8280 x 6208100 - 640014 f-stops1.21.33.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreenCF up to UDMA 6IEE1394b Firewire800 andUSB3 / USB22014 IQ14043.9 x 32.9 mm,CCD40 MP (10 MP), 16 bit7320 x 548450800 (200 - 3200)12 f-stops1.2 / (1.8)1.253.2-inch 1.5-megapixel Retina-type multi touchscreenCF up to UDMA 6IEE1394b Firewire800 andUSB3 / USB22011\n\nThe P+ series are very similar to the normal P-series digital backs but have higher capture frame rate, better response to long exposure photos, and add Live Preview during tethered use. Also, a new high-resolution LCD screen was implemented with better resolution and luminance.\n\nDigital Backs P+ Series list\n\nDigital Backs P Series\n\nThe Phase One P-series digital backs are self sustained units available for many different camera mounts.\n\nDigital Backs H Series\n\nThe Phase One H-series digital backs are tethered units available for various camera mounts. Digital bacsk connects to computer via standard 6pin IEEE 1394. These series of digital backs were originally released as the “Lightphase”, a continuation of Phase One’s tradition of using the name “phase” in the name of their product. This changed with the release of the “H20″, which was originally called “Lightphase H20″ but the name was changed to “Phase One H20″ for better brand recognition.\n\nScan Backs\n\nPhase One Scan backs are fully tethered digital scan backs. They are using SCSI connection to connect to computer except for PowerPhase FX, which is using IEEE1394 “firewire”. Early models of Phase One scan backs CB6x StudioKit and FC70 PhotoPhase, have external control unit that connected to a computer through NuBus.\n\nRepro camera solutions\n\nPhase One reprographic camera systems and specialized book scanners are purpose-built to provide preservation-level rapid capture of rare books, circulation materials, manuscripts, documents, photographic slides, photographic negatives and photographic glass-plates.\n\nPhase One repro camera solutions include the following products:\n\nPhase One IXR Camera\n\nDT RCam Reprographic Camera\n\nDT RG3040 Reprographic System\n\nDT RGC180 Capture Cradle\n\nBC100 Book Capture System\n\nDT Film Scanning Kit\n\nImaging software\n\nCapture One v8\n\nCapture One 8 PRO\n\nCapture One 8 PRO (For Sony)\n\nCapture One 8 DB\n\nCapture One 8 Express (For Sony)\n\nCapture One v7\n\nCapture One 7 PRO\n\nCapture One 7 DB\n\nCapture One 7 Express\n\nCapture One v6(Discontinued)\n\nCapture One 6 PRO\n\nCapture One 6 DB\n\nCapture One 6 Express\n\nCapture Pilot (available on the Apple App Store)\n\nMedia Pro 1(formerly known as Microsoft Expression Media and iView MediaPro)\n\nCapture One v5(Discontinued)\n\nCapture One 5 PRO\n\nCapture One 5 DB\n\nCapture One 5\n\nCapture One v4(Discontinued)\n\nCapture One 4 PRO\n\nCapture One 4 DB\n\nCapture One 4\n\nCapture One v3.x(Discontinued)\n\nCapture One PRO\n\nCapture One DB\n\nCapture One SE (Discontinued 2004)\n\nCapture One LE\n\nCapture One REBEL (Discontinued 2004)\n\nLightphase Capture 2.x(Discontinued, changed name to “Capture One” from version 2.7)\n\nPortrait One (Discontinued)\n\nPortrait One Executive\n\nPortrait One Lite\n\nPortrait One Sales\n\nProduct release of phaseone in reverse chronological order\n\nPhase One IQ100 – 2016\n\nPhase One XF Camera – 2015\n\nPhase One IQ380 – 2015\n\nPhase One IQ360 – 2015\n\nPhase One IQ350 – 2015\n\nPhase One IQ150 – 2014\n\nPhase One iXU – 2014\n\nPhase One IQ250 – 2014\n\nPhase One IQ280, IQ260, IQ260 Achomatic – 2013\n\nPhase One 645DF+ – 2012\n\nPhase One iXR, Phase One iXA – 2012\n\nPhase One IQ180, IQ160, IQ140 – 2011\n\nPhase One P40+ – 2009\n\nPhase One 645DF – 2009\n\nPhase OneP65+ – 2008\n\nPhase One 645AF – 2008\n\nPhase One P20+, P21+, P25+, P30+, and P45+ – 2007\n\nPhase One P21, P30, and P45 – 2005\n\nPhase One P20 and P25 – 2004\n\nPhase One H25 – 2003\n\nPhase One H101 (H10 11 MP, Hasselblad H1 design) – 2002\n\nPhase One H10 (11 MP) – 2002\n\nPhase One H5 and H10 6 MP (Re-branded Lightphase) – 2002\n\nPhase One PowerPhase FX+ – 2002\n\nPhase One H20 – 2001\n\nPhase One PowerPhase FX – 2000\n\nPhase One LightPhase (645 versions and BB03) – 1999\n\nPhase One LightPhase (BB02) – 1999\n\nPhase One LightPhase (BB01) – 1998/1999\n\nPhase One LightPhase (BB00) – 1998\n\nPhase One PowerPhase – 1997\n\nPhase One StudioKit – 1996\n\nPhase One PhotoPhase (+) – 1995/1996\n\nPhase One CB6x and FC70 – 1993\n\nIf you would like to find more and to see more of my photography work, please visit main part of my London Photographer website.
