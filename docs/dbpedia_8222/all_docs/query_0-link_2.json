        "text": "Advertisement (gone after registration)\n\nSeriously Sinar is almost a non player anymore with issues with the Hy6 in effectively Chapter 11, Sinar is more popular among the European crowd than those in the US which is dominated by Hassy and Phase in sales , rentals and dealer networks. What this does do is create a slightly bigger market share for Phase , gain some knowledge from the leaf engineers and help the bottom line. Sure it does eliminate a competitor but Kodak has been trying to unload this for awhile now anyway and anyone could have stepped to the plate to buy it. It certainly proves one thing with the large investment in Mamiya a few short months ago and acquiring leaf right now . Phase has a lot more backing financially than many folks expected or believed it had. In this down economy this purchase says a whole bunch about there ability to not only ride out the economic storm but actually grow there business. For Leaf owners this brings hope of there existing systems that it will get the warranties and service, support that may have gone south to some other buyer. As a Phase owner myself I see this as a very positive sign that my investment was a sound choice at the time and new and future products will grow. The bad is obviously one less player in the market for the end user and that cuts our options down. Also it squarely tells Leica to be very careful on pricing as it begins to enter this market in a couple months. The economy will NOT be much better when the S2 is released and as I said many times leica can bury themselves before it even hit's the street's if priced incorrectly.\n\nOne thing I can smell a mile away is more aggressive price reductions and products coming out that will entice the 35mm folks to move up to MF at a very aggressive 35mm high end price points. I said this before the S2 needs to be more like a D3x is pricing or a max of 50 percent more. That is about 12k for a body only and I still believe that is the sweet spot for this. As a Phase owner today i would not go over that number by very much at all. I have a option for Hassy or a Phase that is very close right now and/or we will see more product coming in around the D3x or very slightly above it and it is already getting at that point. Now I am sure a few folks would throw some numbers at me right now to dispute that , trust me the posted numbers mean very little when it comes time to actually put a number on a check. Let me also add Phase and Hassy will not be sitting on there arsh waiting for Leica to come out with the S2 and take any market share away either. Hassy has already started major price reductions almost a year ago and so has Phase. This is a doggy dog market that NO one wants to give up any market share, it's just too darn small to begin with. You may even see a lot of loss leaders just to get people moving on a system. Remember you are not only buying a body but a whole system and as buyers we need to do the real math for it. Bodies may come in cheap but lenses maybe expensive once you get in. We as buyers need to see the whole playing field before making any moves.\n\nHassy/Imacon caused some damage to Phase's sales by closing up the H system several years ago. From my understanding, Sinar wanted to copy Hassy's \"success\" so they contracted F/H to build the Hy6 and exclude Phase from the intended-to-be-closed system deliberately ... if all happens as originally planned, Phase will be the only one left without a camera.\n\nUnfortunately, the most precise calculation can be fatally flawed ... there's the \"crappiest\" Mamiya to the rescue.\n\nBuying Leaf (a former Sinar ally) can be considered as a retaliation upon Sinar in a sense, but Leaf was the world's first MFDB manufacturer, they have a lot of expertise in this field and have the longest history using DALSA sensors. These could all be very useful to Phase.\n\nShooting with a Leica or a Rollei etc really is all about self indulgence. The folks who write cheques to buy your pictures couldn't care less what damn camera you use, only end result matters ... Phase and their users know this very well, Mamiya doesn't have the glow of a Leica or a Rollei, so what? Some people claim that Hasselblad are made of plastic, again, so what?\n\nEdited June 28, 2009 by sdai\n\nSimon what are some are not counting on at all or have not even thought about is the Leica S lenses will all look identical, there basically Summarits like the M. Sharp wide open and will will only increase DOF. There are NO Summilux look in any of them coming. No dream and no Mojo. They will look like any other MF glass out there, there are some exceptions in Hassy and Mamiya though and these folks can go back to some old glass for a look. Leica there is no place to go back too. I can bet 99 percent of this forum has not even thought about this. Not saying these lenses are bad in any way , they will most likely be exceptional but as we all know the history like the M and R is not behind it and that old 75 Lux or 80 Lux for example is not in the cards. I'm sure they will have nice bokeh and such but give me a 80 lux or 75 lux look any day over any of them coming. MF does bring some Mojo as a format because it is a big sensor. This smaller sensor could actually hurt them in look of DOF it will be between 35mm and MF. MF as we know has tremendous falloff even at F11 so where will the S lenses with a smaller sensor fit , less falloff. Just some things to think about and I know these lenses should be very good but again we have to look at the flip side of everything.\n\nWith the S2 Leica is trying to create a new niche for themselves. Their marketing plan will be to exploit that niche using Leica (German) engineering, design and optical quality. They will avoid direct price comparisons with existing products whether it be MF back type cameras or the more expensive 35MM DSLRs.\n\nThey will not price the system to compete with the lower end Digi MFs. They wont base it on the number of MPs. It will be a unique product like the M system. It wont be cheap it will be exclusive, aimed at the most successful professional photographers and well-off Leica amatuers.\n\nJeff\n\nJeff they even said they are comparing it directly to Hassy with regards to costs. Frankly they are putting their shoes on before their socks.\n\n* Price will be on the same level as the top cameras in the digital professional segment - like high end solutions by Hasselblad and Phase One\n\n* Body will be below 20,000 Euros...\n\nExclusive in down economic times is certain death and for Pro's like myself price will be a major limiting factor when everyone is downsizing and fighting for every inch of business. Don't let anyone fool ya , business sucks for the working Pro right now. EVERYONE's business is in limbo. I have yet to talk to any working Pro right now that can honestly say business is good and I mean almost everyone. Scary times and after 35 years shooting I NEVER seen business this bad on a whole. Whats worse is our clients are settling for less and that becomes a standard.\n\nI wish them the best and not trying to persuade anyone from buying the S2 at all , but from my seat i am only sending up the big red flag for them. Be careful here the market is NOT what it was when they announced this back at Photokinia and if they are not thinking ahead and truly looking at the industry than they really should. It is not even close to what things appear to be back when it was announced. There simply is a extremely limited market left. For a gear whore like myself I have not put out real money on gear in a long time, I made a even switch to the P30+ from the P25+ but have not spent more than 1400 at one time in about 6 months. And I'm a whore when it comes to buying gear, now think about that and it is really scary. The Canon 5dII and Sony A900 are hardly able to get while the D3x is selling at very low volume, right now 3k seems to be the hot spot and many MF shooters are downgrading back to DSLR's. This is a very bad trend for Leica and selling exclusive products right now is not a safe bet for success. At least from my seat that is the way I see it, I hope I am dead wrong for there sake.\n\nCase in point when a shooter can get a MF system used with a 400 shot count with body and lens in a 31mpx back for 12k value than we have some real issues on new camera pricing. This is Hassy or Phase\n\nEdited June 28, 2009 by guy_mancuso"
