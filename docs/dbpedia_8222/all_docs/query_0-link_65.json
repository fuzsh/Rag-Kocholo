In combination with Capture One CH 12 for Mac and Windows, this facilitates quick and easy camera setup for scanning at a specific PPI resolution, magnification or field-of-view on any copy stand.\n\n[/spb_text_block] [spb_text_block animation=”none” animation_delay=”0″ simplified_controls=”yes” custom_css_percentage=”no” padding_vertical=”0″ padding_horizontal=”0″ margin_vertical=”0″ custom_css=”margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;” border_size=”0″ border_styling_global=”default” width=”1/1″ el_position=”first last”]\n\nColour Accuracy & Superior Detail\n\nThe iXG Camera System uses CMOS sensors in both the iXG 100MP and iXG 50MP models to ensure the highest resolution and lowest noise levels. These sensors produce the most accurate colors and minute details, enabling accurate reproduction for all CH cultural heritage applications. The degree of detail, quality and accuracy of color is crucial for the accurate reproduction of precious books, artworks etc. The iXG 100MP Achromatic model uses the all new Sony 100MP Achromatic sensor, combining the highest possible resolution and class leading wide spectrum sensitivity that are so desired for specialized applications such as multi-spectral and NIR (Near Infra-Red) imaging.\n\nSchneider Kreuznach Optics\n\nThe iXG Camera utilizes integrated Flat Field Optics with the 72mm and 120mm Schneider Kreuznach lenses. This compatibility addresses the needs of flat copy work, particularly useful for libraries, archives, and universities, for example. The Schneider Kreuznach lens design in combination with the digital lens perfection of Capture One CH, offers the highest quality in terms of resolution, flatness, sharpness, distortion and color required for the most demanding reproduction applications.\n\nCapture One CH Software Integration\n\nThe full integration of hardware with our customized Capture One Cultural Heritage software yields an efficient professional workflow and precision results. Through the software, there is complete camera control, reliable performance and expertly crafted RAW conversion algorithms. Disciplines for auto-cropping and aligning of both documents and books is a huge time saver, as is the automated workflow for scanning of negative film.\n\nIndustrial Durability\n\nThe iXG Camera System is designed to work hard and to last. It offers industrial build quality, made with aerial grade aluminum and using the most durable mechanical and electronic components available today. The Reliance Shutter’s longevity allows us to offer a guarantee of one million actuations. And with the iXG 100MP in electronic shutter mode, you can achieve an unlimited number of shutter actuations.\n\nPrecision Focus Control\n\nWith the iXG Camera System you get precise, accurate and smooth motor driven focusing. Position-recording of the lens and camera ensures optimum focus accuracy. Precision focus control with both manual and preset positioning, and contrast-based autofocus sets distance and resolution parameters accurately and reliably. This paves the way for automated setting up of camera position and focus for a specific job in terms of document size and capture resolution.\n\nScientific Tools\n\nThe iXG Camera System is designed to be an open platform for new accessories needed for imaging applications by both existing and new customer segments. For example, with the addition of accessory lighting and filtering, the wide spectrum, infrared, and multi-spectral capabilities of the iXG meet the highest standards required. These iXG capabilities also open the door to sequential imaging and computational imaging, required for both multi-spectral and 3D applications.\n\niXG Camera System Technical Specifications\n\nImaging sensor options – iXG 50MP, iXG 100MP and iXG 100MP Achromatic (See specification for Digital Backs)\n\nLens mount Phase – One iXG Shutter type – Leaf shutter, intergrated in lens (reliance shutter/RS shutter)\n\nShutter speed – 1/250s – 30s\n\nFocus positions – Close range to near infinity, 23 mm max. extension\n\nFocus control – Motorized & encoded, controlled from software\n\nMechanical mounts – Threaded holes at top & bottom with a dedicated L-Bracket\n\nTriggering options – Hand release, host capture from software\n\nFlash Output – Via Secured LEMO connector\n\nLive View / HDMI* – 1920×1080 25p/30p, 1280 x 720 50p/60p\n\nData Storage – USB 3.0 Tethered to Capture One CH, PRO and DB\n\nDimensions (mm) – Focused to infinity: 150 x 120 x 100 / Focused to close range: 180 x 120 x 100\n\nWeight (g) – 2300 (Including 72 mm lens and mounting bracket)\n\nOperational temp range (c) – 10-35 (office environment)\n\nHumidity (%) – 15-80 (office environment)\n\n* Will be available at a later date.\n\nLens Specification\n\nDesigned and manufactured by Schneider Kreuznach delivering the highest quality in terms of resolution, flatness, sharpness, distortion and color required for the most demanding reproduction applications.\n\n[/spb_text_block]"
