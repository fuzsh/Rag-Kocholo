        "text": "Types of Stomata\n\nLast Updated : 03 Jun, 2024\n\nImprove\n\nStomata are small pores on leaf and stem surfaces essential for gas exchange and transpiration in plants. Each stoma is controlled by two guard cells that regulate its opening and closing. The distribution and structure of stomata vary, with dicots having more on the lower leaf surface and monocots having them evenly distributed.\n\nStomata can be classified based on the number and arrangement of surrounding cells, evolutionary development, and developmental origin. In this article, we will study the stomata and its types and functions in detail.\n\nWhat is Stomata?\n\nStomata are small, doughnut-shaped pores on the surface of leaves, stems, and other plant organs. They facilitate gas exchange, allowing plants to absorb carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release oxygen. Each stoma is surrounded by two guard cells that control its opening and closing. This mechanism helps regulate water loss through transpiration, opening during the day and closing at night or under drought stress. Stomata are vital for plant homeostasis, balancing gas exchange and water retention. They are found in most terrestrial plants, with their density and distribution varying according to environmental conditions. These structures are important for plant survival and adaptation.\n\nTypes of Stomata\n\nStomata are classified based on their structure, distribution, and arrangement of guard cells. The details of types of stomata are given below:\n\nBased on the Number and Arrangement of Surrounding Cells\n\nStomata can be classified into several types based on the number and arrangement of the cells surrounding them, known as subsidiary cells. These classifications are important for understanding plant taxonomy and physiology. The main types are:\n\nAnomocytic Stomata (Irregular-celled type)\n\nThe guard cells are surrounded by a variable number of cells that are indistinguishable from other epidermal cells. There is no specific arrangement or pattern to the surrounding cells.\n\nThe surrounding cells do not have any particular size or shape.\n\nThe arrangement appears random and lacks a structured pattern.\n\nExamples: This type is commonly found in many dicot families such as Ranunculaceae and Papaveraceae.\n\nAnisocytic Stomata (Unequal-celled type)\n\nThe guard cells are surrounded by three subsidiary cells, where one is distinctly smaller than the other two. This uneven size of surrounding cells is a defining feature.\n\nThree subsidiary cells surround the guard cells.\n\nOne of the subsidiary cells is significantly smaller than the other two.\n\nExamples: Commonly seen in families like Solanaceae (e.g., tobacco, potato) and Brassicaceae (e.g., cabbage, mustard).\n\nParacytic Stomata (Parallel-celled type)\n\nThe guard cells are flanked by two subsidiary cells that are oriented parallel to the long axis of the stomatal pore and the guard cells.\n\nTwo subsidiary cells are positioned alongside the guard cells.\n\nThe subsidiary cells are parallel to the guard cells and the pore.\n\nExamples: Found in families such as Rubiaceae (e.g., coffee) and Fabaceae (e.g., beans, peas).\n\nDiacytic Stomata (Cross-celled type)\n\nIn this type, the guard cells are surrounded by two subsidiary cells that are oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the stomatal pore.\n\nTwo subsidiary cells flank the guard cells.\n\nThe subsidiary cells are positioned perpendicular to the guard cells and the pore.\n\nExamples: Seen in families like Caryophyllaceae (e.g., carnations) and Acanthaceae.\n\nActinocytic Stomata (Radiate-celled type)\n\nThe guard cells are surrounded by a circle of radiating subsidiary cells, resembling the spokes of a wheel.\n\nMultiple subsidiary cells encircle the guard cells.\n\nThe arrangement is radial, giving a star-like appearance.\n\nExamples: Found in some monocot families such as certain grasses.\n\nBased on the Evolutionary Development\n\nStomata can also be classified based on their evolutionary development, defining the different origins and mechanisms by which they form during plant evolution. The main types are:\n\nHaplocheilic Stomata\n\nThese stomata develop from a single initial cell that divides to form both the guard cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells. This type of stomata development is considered more primitive.\n\nThe entire stomatal complex, including guard cells and subsidiary cells, arises from a single progenitor cell.\n\nThe developmental process is relatively simple and direct.\n\nExamples: Haplocheilic stomata are commonly found in ferns and some gymnosperms.\n\nSyndetocheilic Stomata\n\nIn this type, the guard cells and subsidiary cells develop from multiple initial cells. The development process is more complex compared to haplocheilic stomata.\n\nThe guard cells and subsidiary cells originate from different initial cells.\n\nThis type of development allows for a more complex arrangement of cells.\n\nExamples: Syndetocheilic stomata are typical in most angiosperms (flowering plants), which represent a more advanced stage of plant evolution.\n\nBased on the Developmental Origin\n\nStomata can also be classified based on their developmental origin, which refers to how the guard cells and subsidiary cells are formed during the growth of the plant. The two main types based on developmental origin are mesogenous and perigenous stomata.\n\nMesogenous Stomata\n\nIn mesogenous stomata, both the guard cells and the subsidiary cells originate from the same initial epidermal cell. This initial cell undergoes a series of divisions to form the complete stomatal complex.\n\nThe initial cell, also known as the meristemoid, divides to produce guard cells directly as well as subsidiary cells.\n\nThe development is a coordinated process where the same progenitor cell gives rise to all the components of the stomatal apparatus.\n\nExamples: Common in monocot families such as Poaceae (grasses) and Liliaceae (lilies).\n\nPerigenous Stomata\n\nIn perigenous stomata, the guard cells and the subsidiary cells originate from different initial cells. This means the subsidiary cells are derived from neighboring epidermal cells, not the same initial cell that forms the guard cells.\n\nThe guard cells arise from one initial cell, while the subsidiary cells come from adjacent cells that do not share the same lineage as the guard cells.\n\nThis type of development can result in a more varied and less coordinated arrangement of the stomatal complex.\n\nExamples: Common in dicot families such as Asteraceae (daisies) and Fabaceae (legumes).\n\nFunctions of Stomata\n\nFunction of stomata includes:\n\nAllow carbon dioxide to enter the plant for photosynthesis and release oxygen produced during this process.\n\nIt allows the loss of water vapor from the plant, helping to cool the plant and maintain nutrient uptake.\n\nControl the opening and closing of the pores to regulate water loss, aiding in the plant’s water management.\n\nIt enable the intake of carbon dioxide necessary for photosynthesis, contributing to the plant’s energy production.\n\nSupport cellular respiration by allowing oxygen to enter and carbon dioxide to exit.\n\nGuard cells surrounding each stoma adjust the opening size in response to environmental conditions, optimizing gas exchange and water retention.\n\nIt help the plant respond to changing environmental factors like light, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration.\n\nConclusion: Types of Stomata\n\nIn conclusion, stomata vary in their structure and arrangement, classified into several types based on these characteristics. The main types include anisocytic (irregularly shaped subsidiary cells), anomocytic (no distinct subsidiary cells), paracytic (parallel subsidiary cells), diacytic (two subsidiary cells perpendicular to the stoma), and actinocytic (radiating subsidiary cells). Each type adapts to specific environmental conditions, optimizing the plant’s ability to regulate gas exchange and water loss. Understanding these types help in comprehending how different plants manage their physiological processes effectively.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nDiagram of Stomata with Detailed Explanation\n\nDiagram of Leaf and its Parts\n\nEpidermal Tissue System\n\nTypes of Plant Tissue System and their Functions\n\nFAQs on Types of Stomata\n\nWhat are the Three Types of Stomata?\n\nThe three types of stomata are anisocytic, anomocytic, and paracytic.\n\nWhat are the Three Functions of Stomata?\n\nStomata facilitate gas exchange, regulate transpiration, and maintain water balance in plants.\n\nHow Many Stomata are There?\n\nThere can be thousands of stomata on a single leaf surface, varying based on plant species and environmental factors.\n\nWhat are Stomata?\n\nStomata are microscopic pores found on the surfaces of plant leaves and stems, facilitating gas exchange and transpiration.\n\nHow are Stomata Classified?\n\nStomata are classified based on their subsidiary cell arrangement into types such as anisocytic, anomocytic, paracytic, diacytic, and actinocytic.\n\nWhat is the Second Name of Stomata?\n\nThe second name for stomata is “leaf pores,” reflecting their function as microscopic openings on the surfaces of leaves and stems.\n\nWhat are the Two Parts of the Stomata?\n\nThe two parts of the stomata are the pore and the surrounding pair of guard cells, which regulate its opening and closing.\n\nPlease Login to comment..."
