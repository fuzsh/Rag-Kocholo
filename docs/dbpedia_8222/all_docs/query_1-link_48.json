        "text": "Taxes & Duties\n\nThe listed price of a product does not include delivery charges.\n\nPrices on the website are inclusive of UK VAT at the prevailing rate of 20% if displayed in GBP (£) and exclusive of VAT if displayed in USD ($) or EUR (€),. Regardless of how the prices are displayed through the website, VAT will be applied only to orders shipped to the UK, and will not be levied on orders exported to other destinations. VAT will be levied or deducted from the prices at the checkout according to the shipping destination selected.\n\nPrices are exclusive of all other taxes and duties. All orders are shipped on a DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid) basis, meaning your order may be subject to local taxes and/or import duties levied by your local customs authority. We are unable to calculate the exact amount of import duties and taxes that your order may incur, as these charges are imposed directly by the destination country. Please ensure to check the final price of sale before submitting the order form. If you have any questions about import duties please contact our sales team prior to placing an order. International shipments are accompanied by a commercial invoice stating the value of the individual items in the currency of payment."
