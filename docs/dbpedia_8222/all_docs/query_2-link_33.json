        "text": "A new license is required whenever the business entity changes (such as sole owner to corporation, sole owner to partnership, partnership to corporation, etc.) or when specific changes occur with the business structure. Licenses are associated with a business entity and not necessarily the qualifier. Therefore, licenses are not transferable from one business to another, even if the qualifying individual is the same for both (Business and Professions Code section 7075.1).\n\nCSLB issues licenses to five (5) types of business entities:\n\nSole Owner Licenses\n\nA sole owner license is issued to a specific individual. The license can be qualified by the Owner or an Responsible Managing Employee (RME). The license cannot be sold or transferred to another individual.\n\nPartnership Licenses\n\nA partnership license is issued to a specific General Partnership or Limited Partnership structure. The license can be qualified by a Qualifying Partner or Responsible Managing Employee (RME). A Qualifying Partner must be a General Partner of the partnership structure. An RME is an employee of the company, and not considered a part of the partnership structure.\n\nGeneral Partnership Licenses\n\nLimited Partnership Licenses\n\nCorporate Licenses\n\nNew License Required\n\nLicense Reassignment"
