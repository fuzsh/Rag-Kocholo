p.1 #2 · p.1 #2 · Phase one P30+ versus Aptus 22

Ok, I just had a conversation with a colleague about the New Hasselblad 3. It occurs to me that there is very little known about their own digital back. And indeed, i have not seen a review yet, nor have I seen an image produced by that camera. If any of you know where I can see that info, it would be a great help

If you don't like *working* with the Leaf software, just remember that the output from the Leaf software is much better than using ACR or SilkyPix for the Leaf files, or other third party programs, except maybe Raw Developer, and that you're paying a lot of money for a digital back, so you might as well get used to the software if it gives you superior results.

I am in the same boat as you regarding C1. It's pretty much all I use. I hear nothing but great reviews on the P30.

Phase One uses Kodak chips, Leaf uses Dalsa. The Aptus will probably be recommended over the P30 for beauty and fashion from the users of MFD in this forum.

Where's Frank Doorhof when you need him.

first of all, the chip sizes are different: the aptus22 is considered full frame and the p30 has a crop factor of 1.3X; secondly, if you want higher iso capability, the p30+ goes to iso 1600. the aptus tops out at iso 400: third, the p 30+ uses a microlens array which phase claims aids in moire control. the aptus 22 does not have microlenses, and i can tell you that moire is an occasional problem.

you could convert the leaf files to dng, which is supported by phase one. (yes a little extra step there)

you may want to factor in how you are going to use your back in your analysis/evaluation....studio work, where iso 25, 50 and 100 of the aptus back excel, or natural light and or low light situations where you might want to use the higher iso of the p 30+ to compensate for a f 4.5 zoom for example. is the external battery a concern for you with the aptus? it was a non issue for me, yet i know others who felt it was a drawback. if however you were to go with an afi, the external battery issue goes away. also you really need to evaluate the user interface...the leaf touch screen process with it's okays and check marks or the phase button controls...you may find that your prefer one over the other.

hope this helps.

This is all very helpfull to me thx.

Just got a Hassie H2 with a P30+ Back to try it out.

One question about the .mos files, how do you convert them into dng files?

Johny

if you open the .mos file in camera raw, the save option will allow you to convert and save the file as a dng.

with respect to leaf capture 11 for pc...even though there are people who are using it, leafs official position seems to be it has not yet been publically released....

Well, it seems like I will have to buy a Mac Laptop then... I I have the money left

One more thing:

New development, the guys at Calumet told me that I can eventually buy the H2 witch they give me for testing. The guy here in Belgium thinks that the camera is used extensively, in Holland, where the body comes from, they claim they do not know how many shots he fired !?

Is there a way to find that out. I know it was possible with a Canon Camera.

I don't want to pay a lot of money for a Camera that is used to much !!

THX for the help.

i'm not sure what you mean when you say little is known about the hasselblad back....the technology for the back comes from the imacom "side" of the house,which is far from being a new player in the digital back and scanning arena. the h3 system while under fire for the "closed" path it has taken, has been aroud for just over a year and they recently introduced the h3dII. while i'm not interested in debating the merits of a closed vs. open system, you might want to start by looking at the blad site and in particular looking at products and hasselblad phocus which might shed some light on their hardware/software. i have seen a couple of reviews of the h3: i recall pdn did an indepth review and comparison of the h3system. when i have time i will try to locate the issue it appeared in...

I am more than likely the only one here that has owned both so here goes . Both are great . Both produce images that have better color and detail than the 35 mm and aps sensor cameras . They both have uses and both have limitations . You start at iso 25 on the Aptus and iso 100 on the Phase . 30 seconds at iso 100 on the Leaf will have noise and the noise of the phase is much less . The Aptus is best suited for shots that use iso 25-50 if they are going long . The Phase I have shot 5-10 minute exposures in cold weather and the noise is not bad . The Aptus is a slow shooter and the P-30+ is much faster but neither are suited for fast shooting .

I believe Leaf and Phase both use Dalsa sensors now . The micros lenses on the phase work poorly with large format digital lenses and will produce color casts that will really irritate you . Leaf when shifted for stitching can produce color casts but it can be fixed in photoshop or in Leafs custom gain adjuster .

For fashion the P-30 will be better and it shoots faster as well . The files are very nice . For a while Leaf had the better file and now the tables are turning towards Phase .

As for the H2 body , you couldn't pay me enough to shot one . Go Mamiya or Contax . Mamiya is working on new lenses for the 645 from what I have heard .

I have shot fashion , architecture and landscapes with the P-30+ and love it . I miss the touch screen on the Leaf but I like the Phase file better .
