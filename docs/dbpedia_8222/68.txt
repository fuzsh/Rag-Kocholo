p.1 #1 · p.1 #1 · Leaf's test of Aptus 75 v Phase One P45

http://www.leaf-photography.com/files/Leaf_vs_Phase_2006.pdf

This is quite a bold move by Leaf. I don't agree with the conclusions of every image and the one Achilles' heel of the test is that although the camera, lens and exposure were the same for each back, the capture software used was different. The fact that both were run using default settings is meaningless. Perhaps one application's standard settings includes some sharpening or extra saturation, for example, and the other one does not? Having said all that, and all else being equal, the Leaf does outshine the Phase One.

I'd love to have the opportunity to do this test for myself!

Has anyone tried? If so, what were your findings?

Graham,

Thanks for the interesting lead of this MF back comparisons. I agree with your perspective about the poor standardization of the tests. Sometimes modeling a natural phenomenon is crucial to be perfect with no fudge factors nor poor techniques. But sometimes the existence of the phenomenon does not have to be modeled perfectly to accept the existence of the trend or the significant differences. In this case, I absolutely agree the technique would have been terrific if it was standardized better but the general trend does show favorable outcomes for Leaf in many different areas. If I am in the market for the MF back I would consider the Leaf assuming other factors such as supports and camera compatibility are the same or in favor of my system of choice.

Graham,

I had the opportunity to compare the Aptus 75 and P45 during a trip to Atlana with Chuck Jones. We did a very unscientific test with different lenses, different cameras, different scenes...nothing at all like the linked test. Our conclusions were that the images from both of these backs are top notch and very close. I would say you can't go wrong with either back. I had a predisposition to go with the Phase back because I've been using Capture One for several years and don't relish the prospect of learning new software. Nevertheless, we opted for the Leaf backs based on our conclusion (mostly Chuck's) that the files were just a bit better. Also, the touch screen interface on the Aptus is just fantastic. I do think that the Leaf test might have shown closer results for the two backs if third party software such as Raw Developer had been used. I would say you cannot go wrong with either of these backs, they both deliver amazing files.

Graham,

We experienced a few problems with the H1 which seemed to be firmware related. The camera we tried was way off on color balance. When we tried to take a shot of a grey card for use in post processing we were told the camera couldn't do that without a firmware upgrade. They upgraded the firmware, and the camera froze up, and this was at a Hassy sponsored demo with the reps from Hassy giving the presentation. Total fiasco and very embarrassing for the Hassy guys (great guys by the way). In fairness to Hassy, they are not the only company that puts their product on the market before the bugs are out. But for this kind of price who wants to be a beta tester for them. I will say that the Hassy back has the best display of the bunch. When they get their act together I'm sure they'll be worth considering.

There have been lots of prime Contax 645 kits being sold lately. I can't believe everybody's going Hassy, probably more like they're going to a 35 DSLR. Problem is, that if you are a portrait guy used to a RZ or a 645, composing on a 35 viewfinder is the pits.

John,

I can't believe it either, but it is the case that most of the Leaf backs are being sold with Hassy mounts. Contax mounts are in last place, but I will tell you that the images that we took with Chuck's contax had an entirely different look than those taken with the H1. Same kind of difference that we've seen when comparing the Leica DMR with Canon images, more of a three dimensionality, better micro-contrast, etc. It's those Zeiss lenses. As for camera bodies, seems to me that Hassy and the Contax are at the opposite ends of the pole in terms of camera philosophy. The Hassy is an electronic marvel, lots of buttons, menus, submenus, etc. ala Canon. The Contax is much simpler. For those of us who use and like Leica, the Contax will be much closer to what we've grown fond of. On the other hand, as Guy points out, this is now discontinued gear.
