        "text": "Hi Bill,\n\nBy researching Desert Storm, I have found there is an EXCALIBUR Archivist Project, through the US Army\n\nResearch Lab, using Cray Super Computers. It is a Tape media, with special commands and the User Guide is online.\n\nThe US Army Research Lab is Headquarter in MD, but they have branches listed on wiki. Also a branch in Orlando Florida by CENTCOM, which is most likely NASA Kennedy Space Center. They have a branch at NASA Glenn in Ohio.\n\nThey scan everything before it goes to NARA. They have been doing it since 1994. The US Army Research Lab was activated in 1992. I wish I had one super computer, because it would help me find the missing Desert Storm NBC Logs. But they cost 500 thousand dollars. Your map is most likely digitized, and at one of the Cray sites, if NARA had access then you could find it. Do you remember the Legend of Excalibur?\n\nBill,\n\nThe problem with the EXCALIBUR Project,is that it may brake the \"chain of custody\" to NARA.\n\nRecords and data can be scanned and then lost or destroyed. NARA does not receive the complete evidence.\n\nSo their archive is incomplete and does not portray the actual evidence of history.\n\nNARA should have access to the Cray Super Computer that digitizes and stores all the media.\n\nImagine all the things NARA never received? The chain of custody is important and is always a\n\nmajor legal matter. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency does a lot of ocean topography\n\nand research. But the map was most likely scanned into Excalibur or a Naval equivalent.\n\nI will search the web for the Naval Cray sites.\n\nhttps://insidehpc.com/2015/10/army-unveils-excalibur-cray-xc40-supercomputer/\n\nUnited States Army Research Laboratory - Wikipedia\n\nThe Map may be buried in stone, and only one chosen person can remove it.\n\nNARA has a new Charter for Change, and organizational structure which has a goal\n\nto digitize the holdings by 2019. The only problem, is that everything has been scanned to\n\nthe Crays since 1994. The physical records have already been scanned, then shipped to NARA.\n\nJust think of all the information that has never made it to the Archive? But I still have hope\n\nfor the future. The Legend of Excalibur is also interesting.\n\nExcalibur - Wikipedia"
