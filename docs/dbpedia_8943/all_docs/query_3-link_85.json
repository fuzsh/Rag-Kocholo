        "text": "Developments in Dar al-Islam\n\nOverview of Islam\n\nis a monotheistic religion founded in the 7th century by the prophet Muhammad. Islam is based on the belief in one God () and the teachings of Muhammad as recorded in the , the holy book of Islam. Muslims believe that Muhammad is the last in a line of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and that the Quran is the final revelation from God. Islam is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing religions, and it is the dominant religion in many countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia. Muslims follow a strict code of conduct known as , which covers all aspects of life and includes rules for prayer, fasting, charity, and personal behavior. Islam also emphasizes the importance of social justice and the equality of all believers.\n\nWhat is Dar al-Islam?\n\nis an Arabic term that means \"the abode of Islam.\" It refers to the lands where Islam is the dominant religion and Islamic law (sharia) is practiced. Dar al-Islam is traditionally contrasted with Dar al-Harb, which means \"the abode of war\" and refers to lands where Islam is not the dominant religion. According to Islamic tradition, the goal of Muslims is to spread Islam throughout the world and to establish Dar al-Islam as a global community. In the past, Dar al-Islam was used to refer specifically to the Muslim-controlled territories during the period of Muslim expansion in the 7th to 13th centuries. Today, the concept of Dar al-Islam is often used in a more metaphorical sense to refer to the global community of Muslims and the ideal of a unified Muslim society.\n\nIslamic expansion across North Africa and through the Middle East saw more connections because of trade. Muslim caliphates conquered and often tolerated different beliefs as long as non-Muslims paid a tax called a . According to Islamic tradition, jizya is a form of protection tax that is paid by non-Muslims in exchange for the protection and security provided by the Muslim state. In some cases, the payment of jizya was seen as a sign of submission to Muslim rule, and it was required as a condition of living in a Muslim-controlled territory. In other cases, jizya was seen as a way to allow non-Muslims to continue practicing their own religion without interference. The exact amount of jizya that was required varied depending on the time and place, and it was typically based on the wealth and status of the individual paying it.\n\nThe Battle of Tours, also known as the Battle of Poitiers, was a battle that took place in 732 between Frankish and Islamic forces in the region of Tours, France. The battle was fought between the Frankish leader Charles Martel and an Islamic army that had invaded the region and was attempting to expand its territory. The Frankish forces were able to decisively defeat the Islamic army and halt its advance into Europe. The Battle of Tours is considered a turning point in the history of Europe, as it marked the end of the Islamic conquest of the continent and the beginning of the Christian reconquest. The battle also had significant consequences for the spread of Islam in Europe, as it slowed the expansion of the religion and helped to consolidate the power of the Christian kingdoms in the region.\n\nAl-Andalus was the name given to the territory in the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal) that was ruled by Muslim dynasties from the 8th to the 15th centuries. Al-Andalus was a center of culture, learning, and trade, and it was known for its advanced system of government, its sophisticated cities, and its diverse population. The Muslim rulers of Al-Andalus were influenced by a variety of cultures, including Arab, Berber, and Jewish, and they established a diverse and tolerant society that welcomed people of different religions and ethnicities. Al-Andalus was conquered by Christian kingdoms in the 15th century, but its legacy can still be seen in the art, architecture, and culture of the region. The architecture of and the iron work of Toleda are directly related to this era of Islamic expansion.\n\nThe position of women in Dar al-Islam (the \"abode of Islam\") has varied throughout history and has been shaped by a variety of factors, including cultural, social, and political. According to Islamic teachings, men and women are considered equal in the eyes of God and are afforded equal rights and responsibilities. However, the interpretation and application of these teachings has varied widely across time and place, and women have often faced discrimination and inequality in practice. In some Muslim-majority societies, women have played a significant role in public life, while in others they have been largely confined to the domestic sphere. Women's rights in Dar al-Islam have also been affected by the influence of colonialism, modernizing reforms, and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. Overall, the position of women in Dar al-Islam is complex and varied, and it cannot be reduced to a single, monolithic experience.\n\nPeriphery of the Abbasids\n\nUmayyad Caliphates\n\nThe was the second of the four major caliphates in Islam, following the Rashidun Caliphate. It was founded by the Umayyad dynasty, which ruled from 661 to 750. The Umayyad Caliphate was centered in Damascus, Syria, and it extended its control over much of the Arab world, as well as parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The Umayyads are known for their military conquests and for their cultural achievements, including the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the development of the Arabic language and literature. The Umayyad Caliphate is also remembered for its internal conflicts and for the persecution of certain groups, including the Shia Muslims and the People of the Book (non-Muslim monotheistic religions). The Umayyad Caliphate was eventually overthrown by the in 750.\n\nAbbasid Caliphates\n\nThe Abbasid Caliphate was the third of the four major caliphates in Islam, following the Rashidun Caliphate and the Umayyad Caliphate. It was founded by the Abbasid dynasty, which ruled from 750 to 1258. The Abbasid Caliphate was centered in Baghdad, Iraq, and it extended its control over much of the Arab world, as well as parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The Abbasids are known for their cultural achievements, including the establishment of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, which was a major center of learning and scholarship. The Abbasid Caliphate is also remembered for its internal conflicts and for the decline of its power and influence in the later years of its rule. The Abbasid Caliphate was eventually overthrown by the in the 13th century.\n\nThe Umayyad and the Abbasid Caliphates helped develop and spread Islam from Spain to India. As the Abbasid Caliphate falls to the Mongol invaders, new Islamic powers emerge:\n\nðŸŽ¥Watch: WHAP - The Islamic World\n\n[\n\n](https://app.fiveable.me/ap-world/unit-1-the-global-tapestry/the-islamic-world/watch/0tdXks7BWu6ThWwNjyai)**New Islamic Powers**\n\n-----\n\nCheck out the AP World Unit 1 Replays,** watch the 2021 Unit 1 Cram, or play Unit 1 Trivia **\n\n-----\n\nKey Developments of Dar al-Islam\n\nDar al-Islam, or the \"abode of Islam,\" has seen a number of significant developments throughout its history.
