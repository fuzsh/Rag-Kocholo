        "text": "The historic Damascus Gate of Jerusalem built during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Suleiman, known in Arabic as the Bab al-Amud (Gate of the Column), is one of the main entrances to the Old City of Jerusalem. In modern Hebrew it has been named as the Sha'ar Shechem (Shechem Gate), after the biblical city of Shechem. At one time a road leaving Damascus Gate of Jerusalem led to the ancient city of Damascus, Syria via Sichem. Historically the gate was also known as the Bab al-'Amud (gate of the column), referring to the Hadrian's column built in the first half of the scond century CE. It is the only gate of Jerusalem to have preserved the same name since at least the tenth century (i.e. Bab al-Amud).\n\nThroughout its history, the Damascus Gate has been more than just a military fortification. It has served as a bustling center of commerce and social interaction. The gate leads to the vibrant Arab market (souq) in the Muslim Quarter, where vendors sell a variety of goods, from fresh produce to textiles and souvenirs. This market atmosphere reflects the gate's historical role as a key entry point for caravans and traders coming from the north, including the cities of Nablus (Shechem) and Damascus, hence its name."
