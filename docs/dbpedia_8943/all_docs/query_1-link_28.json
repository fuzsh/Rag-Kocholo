It is located in southwestern Syria and has a long history dating back thousands of years, representing human civilization. Damascus is known for its rich cultural history, busy marketplaces, and scenery that blends modernism with timelessness.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information about Damascus, or you can download our 26-page Damascus worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nHISTORY\n\nDamascus has a long history dating back to prehistoric times. It was a trade and agricultural center in the second millennium BCE. Although there is evidence of civilization in the larger Barada region reaching back to 9000 BCE, no large-scale settlement existed within Damascus’ walls up until the second millennium BCE.\n\nGenesis 14:15 mentions Damascus as existing during the War of the Kings. Damascus (together with Trachonitis), according to the first-century Jewish writer Flavius Josephus in his twenty-one volume Antiquities of the Jews, was founded by Uz, the son of Aram.\n\nDamascus was conquered and governed by several empires and civilizations over the millennia, including the Egyptians, Hittites, Arameans, Assyrians, and Persians.\n\nDamascus was conquered by the Roman Empire under Pompey the Great in 64 BCE. It became prosperous during Roman rule and became a significant commercial town along the Silk Road.\n\nAfter Pompey conquered the region, the Romans completely reconstructed Damascus. The Old Town of Damascus preserves the Roman city’s rectangular arrangement, with two main axes: the Decumanus Maximus (east-west; known now as the Via Recta) and the Cardo (north-south), with the Decumanus being roughly twice as long.\n\nThe city was besieged and seized by Shahrbaraz in 613, along with many Byzantine warriors as prisoners, during the Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628. It remained in Sasanian authority until near the end of the war.\n\nMuhammad’s first indirect association with Damascenes occurred when he sent a letter to Harith ibn Abi Shamir, the king of Damascus, via his associate Shiya ibn Wahab. After the Rashidun Caliphate seized a significant portion of Syria’s countryside during the time of Caliph Umar (r. 634-644), Damascus was conquered by the Arab Muslim commander Khalid ibn al-Walid in August-September 634 CE.\n\nUnder the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE), Damascus was the capital of the Islamic empire. During this time, the Umayyad Mosque (Great Mosque of Damascus) was constructed, considered one of Islam’s holiest shrines.\n\nDamascus fell to the Seljuk Turks and then the Crusaders in the 11th century, but Muslim armies led by Saladin eventually reclaimed it.\n\nIn 1516, it became part of the Ottoman Empire and remained so until the end of World War I.\n\nWhen Syria obtained independence from France in 1946, Damascus became its capital. It has subsequently played an essential part in the nation’s political, cultural, and economic development.\n\nBy January 2012, disputes between the regular army and rebels had reached Damascus’ suburban areas, allegedly preventing residents from leaving or accessing their homes, significantly when security operations increased from the end of January into February. After the fall of IS from Yarmouk Camp on May 20, 2018, Damascus and the whole Rif Dimashq Governorate fell totally under government control for the first time in 7 years.\n\nDamascus entered the Guinness World Records in September 2019 as the least livable city, getting 30.7 points on the Economist’s Global Liveability Index in 2019.\n\nGEOGRAPHY\n\nDamascus is situated on a strategic site 680 meters (2,230 feet) above sea level and about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the Mediterranean, protected by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, provided with water from the Barada River, and at a crossroads among trade routes: the north-south route connecting Egypt with Asia Minor and the east-west cross-desert route linking Lebanon with the Euphrates river valley.\n\nThe climate of Damascus is semi-arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, rainy winters. Summers are scorching, with temperatures frequently exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), although winters are colder and more pleasant, with temperatures averaging 10-15 degrees Celsius (50-59 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nCULTURE\n\nDamascus is one of the world’s oldest continually inhabited cities. As a result, it possesses an enormous number of historical and architectural treasures, including ancient structures, palaces, and religious buildings.\n\nDamascus has a varied religious environment, with considerable Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as well as Christians of many denominations. This diversity in religion has aided in developing a culture of religious tolerance and harmony.\n\nSyrian cuisine is highly represented in Damascus, and the city is well known for its delectable meals. Traditional Syrian foods such as shawarma, kebabs, falafel and desserts such as baklava and ma’amoul are popular.\n\nTraditional Arabic music is prominent, and the city holds many festivals and concerts. The city is also well-known for its conventional Arabic calligraphy and artisan handicrafts.\n\nThe traditional attire of Damascus shows the city’s culture and traditions. Women often wear long gowns and headscarves, while males wear traditional clothes such as the dishdasha and keffiyeh.\n\nPEOPLE\n\nDamascus’s population was estimated to be 2.7 million people in 2004. Damascus had a population of 1,711,000 people in 2011. However, the city’s population was estimated to be 2,503,000 in 2022, rising to 2,584,771 in early 2023. The city’s growth rate surpasses Syria’s, primarily due to rural-urban migration and the inflow of young Syrian migrants attracted by job and educational prospects.\n\nIslam is the most widely practiced religion in the city. The majority of Muslims are Sunni, with Alawites and Twelver Shi’a constituting a significant minority. Damascus is believed to have about 200 mosques, the most well-known of which is the Umayyad Mosque.\n\nThere is also a small Christian community of several denominations, notably Syriac and Armenian. However, a once thriving Jewish population has declined significantly. The population reduction is due mainly to emigration in the late twentieth century as a result of pressure on Syria to let the remainder of its Jewish people, previously restricted with job opportunities, travel, and other restrictions, leave the country.\n\nHISTORICAL SITES\n\nUmayyad Mosque (Great Mosque of Damascus)\n\nThe Umayyad Mosque is one of the world’s oldest and biggest mosques. It was built during the Umayyad Caliphate in the early eighth century. The mosque is known for its beautiful architectural elements, which include a vast courtyard, elaborate mosaics, and a conspicuous golden dome. It has long served as a source of inspiration for Islamic architectural styles.\n\nCitadel of Damascus\n\nThis old castle, perched on a hill in the city, dates back to the Roman and Byzantine periods. It has panoramic views of Damascus and a museum with relics from various ages.\n\nAl-Azm Palace (Qasr al-Azm)\n\nBuilt in the 18th century, this wonderfully preserved palace is an outstanding example of classic Damascene architecture. It is now a museum displaying diverse Ottoman relics, furniture, and art.\n\nMausoleum of Saladin\n\nSaladin, a well-known Muslim military leader instrumental in the Crusades, is buried in the mausoleum. It is a location that is significant in both history and culture.\n\nDamascus Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Damascus across 26 in-depth pages.
