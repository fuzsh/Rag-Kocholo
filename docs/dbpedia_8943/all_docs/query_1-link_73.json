        "text": "During the time of the Umayyad dynasty, the Islamic Empire extended over huge areas and even threatened Europe (with the conquest of Spain). The Umayyad capital was Damascus. In the Land of Israel, the Umayyads established the administrative city of Ramle, and Jerusalem saw a major building push under Umayyad rule. Two important religious structures were built on the Temple Mount, and palaces and a gigantic bathhouse went up next to the Mount. The southern wall of the Temple Mount was rebuilt and the Gates of Hulda were restored. The Gate of Mercy in the eastern wall may also have been built during this time."
