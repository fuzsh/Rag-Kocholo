        "text": "Great Mosque of Damascus, the earliest surviving stone mosque, built between 705 and 715 ce by the Umayyad Caliph al-Walīd I, who proclaimed to his citizens: “People of Damascus, four things give you a marked superiority over the rest of the world: your climate, your water, your fruits, and your baths. To these I add a fifth: this mosque.” Adjacent to the mosque is the tomb of one of the most illustrious Muslim leaders, Saladin, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders.\n\nThere have been religious buildings on the site for thousands of years, and the earliest known relics come from an Aramaean temple dating to about 3000 bce. A 1st-century Hellenic temple to Jupiter was built during the Roman era, and a later church of St. John the Baptist was erected on its foundation. Some Syrio-Roman fragments remain in the structure, as does a shrine supposedly enclosing a relic honoured by Muslims as well as some Christians as the head of St. John the Baptist.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nIslam"
