        "text": "Under the leadership of the Umayyads, Islamic armies conquered the part of North Africa known as the Maghrib—modern-day Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia—between 670 and 711, and then crossed the Strait of Gibraltar to enter Spain. Strong economic and cultural ties dating back to the Roman Empire bound the Maghrib to western Asia. Its fertile fields provided the entire Mediterranean with grain, olive oil, and fruits. Slaves and gold moved from the interior of Africa to the coastal ports, where they, too, were loaded into ships crossing the Mediterranean.\n\nArab culture and the religion of Islam eventually took root in North Africa, expanding from urban centers into the countryside. By the tenth century, Christians had become a minority in Egypt, outnumbered by Muslims, and by the twelfth century, Arabic had replaced both Egyptian and the Berber languages of the Maghrib as the dominant language. Annual performance of the hajj pilgrimage strengthened the ties between the people of North Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Pilgrim caravans converged in Cairo, from which large groups then proceeded to Mecca.\n\nIslamic rule reoriented North Africa. Before it, the Mediterranean coast of Africa formed the southern edge of the Roman Empire, where Christianity was the dominant religion and Latin the language of learning. Under Muslim rule, North Africa lay at the western edge of the Islamic realm, and Arabic was spoken everywhere."
