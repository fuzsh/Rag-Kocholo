Damascus was the capital of the Umayyad Caliphs. During the Umayyad Dynasty, which ruled the Islamic Caliphate from 661 to 750 CE, the capital was located in Damascus, which is now the capital of modern-day Syria. Damascus served as the political and administrative center of the vast Umayyad Empire, which extended from Spain in the west to Central Asia in the east. The Umayyad Caliphs established Damascus as their capital after moving it from Madinah, where the Rashidun Caliphs had ruled before them.
