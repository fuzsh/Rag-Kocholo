Todd married Terri in 1982, and finished up his Associates degree at Miles City Community College. He then went on to get his\n\nMortuary Science degree in Portland Oregon, where he and his wife graduated together in 1984. After graduation, the couple came back to Miles City to work in the family business. Todd has a heart for funeral services, and he is also a visionary. He wanted to expand into other area towns and serve their communities as he has served Miles City and the surrounding areas. As the proper opportunities arose, he was able to take the highly regarded Stevenson & Sons Funeral Home name to many communities. Todd now spends a great deal of his time ensuring that the special care, personal attention and profound respect that are the foundation of Stevenson & Sons Funeral Homes are always honored at all of the different locations. They have two adult children: Tiffany and TJ. Tiffany is married to Ren Gardner and TJ is Married to Haley (Anderson). Tiffany and Ren have four boys.

After becoming licensed, she worked in Pennsylvania until August of 1999. The mountains called her west, so she relocated to Western Colorado where she worked in Delta County Colorado as a mortician and assistant coroner for several years. Michele recently joined the team at Franzen-Davis Funeral Home bringing her experience and passion for helping those in need at a time of loss.\n\nA country girl at heart, Michele loves the mountains, where she enjoys side-x-side riding and snowmobiling.

She is a life member of St. Andrew’s parish in Livingston, has served on the Vestry at St. Andrew’s, has served on several committees and councils for the Diocese of Montana and has represented Montana at the Episcopal Church General Convention eight times.\n\nFormerly the chaplain for Livingston HealthCare Hospice Sandy officiated at many memorial and funeral services.

He and his wife, Kathy, were long-time travelers to the West and they love the mountains and the outdoors. In the early days of their marriage, Mt. Rainier in Washington was their destination. Over the years, as they slowed down, Montana became more and more like home to them. Livingston eventually became the place where they had decided to retire. It just so happened before that time in their life came around, Paul, who is also a Lutheran pastor, was called in early 2015 to serve St. Paul’s Lutheran Church in Livingston . Paul and Kathy have been here ever since. He is also now serving congregations in Lewistown and Mosby. Kathy is a music teacher in the community.\n\nPaul serves as Funeral Director Intern, lead removal technician and facility manager for Franzen-Davis.\n\nFred Amborn is a Retired United Methodist Minister.

Fred and Mary love Montana and continue their adventures exploring Montana’s beauty and discovering its rich history by visiting the historic cities and ghost towns. After serving a ¾-time appointment in Belgrade, Fred retired from parish ministry with 40 years of service, in 2020. Fred reached out to Franzen-Davis Funeral Home with possible part-time employment and has been with us since the summer of 2020. He has worked as a recess aide for East Side Elementary School. As the Funeral Home Chaplain, Fred is available to offer funeral, memorial, graveside, or grief counseling services for those who have no connection to a church; want a non-sectarian service; or desire a non-religious celebration or memorial gathering."
