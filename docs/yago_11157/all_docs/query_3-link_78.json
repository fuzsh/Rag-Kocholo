        "text": "Judy Dickinson, playing her first tournament in a month, shot a 6-under 66 Saturday to lead the LPGA Rail Charity Classic in Springfield, Ill.\n\nDickinson's round of six birdies and no bogeys left her one stroke in front of defending champion Beth Daniel.Daniel, the LPGA's leading money-winner with $613,782, has won three of her last four tournaments and five overall this year.\n\nThree-time Rail champion Betsy King, Kathryn Young, and Sherri Turner were tied at 68.\n\nAfter opening with two pars, Dickinson birdied the par-5 third hole at The Rail Golf Club. She added birdies on the fourth, eighth, 11th, 13th and 14th holes for identical 33s on the front and back nines.\n\nDickinson, married to PGA Senior Tour player Garner Dickinson, rolled in a 90-foot putt to go to 4-under.\n\nAfter consecutive birdies on the 13th and 14th, Dickinson parred out for her leading round.\n\nDickinson's last tournament was The Boston Five Classic Aug. 2-5, where she finished in a tie for 38th.\n\nDickinson, president of the LPGA Players Association, has been a Tour member since 1978, and has not won since the Safeco Classic in 1986.\n\nTurner's round featured a hole-in-one on the second hole.\n\nThe holiday weekend tournament continues with second-round play Sunday and the final round on Monday.At Franklin, Wis., Ray Stewart, a 36-year-old pro still seeking his first win on the PGA tour, fired a 5 under-par 67 Saturday to take a three-stroke lead after three rounds of the $900,000 Greater Milwaukee Open.\n\nStewart, of Vancouver, B.C., was at 16-under par 200 and led three golfers by three shots. Scott Verplank and Morris Hatalsky, who won the GMO in 1983, both bogeyed the final hole and finished with rounds of 67. Billy Mayfair shot a 68 and was also at 203.\n\nAt 204 were 1986 GMO champion Corey Pavin , Hal Sutton and Brian Claar .\n\nAnother 17 golfers were one or two shots further back including defending champion Greg Norman, who shot a 69 and was at 10-under 206, which means Stewart will have a lot of golfers in striking distance on the final day.\n\nStewart tied 1985 GMO champion Jim Thorpe for the first round lead with a 9-under par 63 and shot a 70 in the second round for a one-shot lead over Ken Green, who won the GMO in 1988. He bogyed the first hole, a par 4, when he dumped his tee shot in the bunker but came back with six birdies for a 67."
