(AP) - Judy Dickinson, playing her first\n\ntournament in a month, shot a 6-under 66 Saturday to lead\n\nthe LPGA Rail Charity Classic.\n\nDickinson's round of six birdies and no bogeys left her\n\none stroke in front of defending champion Beth Daniel.\n\nDaniel, the LPGA's leading money-winner with $613,782, has\n\nwon three of her last four tournaments and five overall\n\nthis year.\n\nThree-time Rail champion Betsy King, Kathryn Young, and\n\nSherri Turner were tied at 68.\n\nAfter opening with two pars, Dickinson birdied the par-5\n\nthird hole at The Rail Golf Club. She added birdies on the\n\nfourth, eighth, 11th, 13th and 14th holes for identical\n\n33s on the front and back nines.\n\nDickinson, married to PGA Senior Tour player Gardner Dickinson,\n\nrolled in a 90-foot putt to go to 4-under.\n\nAfter consecutive birdies on the 13th and 14th, Dickinson\n\nparred out for her leading round.\n\nDickinson's last tournament was The Boston Five Classic\n\nAug. 2-5, where she finished in a tie for 38th.\n\nDickinson, president of the LPGA Players Association, has\n\nbeen a Tour member since 1978, and has not won since the\n\nSafeco Classic in 1986.\n\nTurner's round featured a hole-in-one on the second hole.\n\nThe holiday weekend tournament continues with second-round\n\nplay Sunday and the final round on Monday.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
