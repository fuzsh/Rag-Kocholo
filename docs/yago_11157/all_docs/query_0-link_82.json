        "text": "Tobias “Toby” Miller, 77, of Edmond, OK passed away on December 8, 2021 after a short battle with cancer. Toby was born on September 24, 1944 to Alex and Mary Miller in Dickinson, ND. As a young boy, he attended a one-room schoolhouse, Hirschville School, in Dunn County. After graduating from Campus High School in Dickinson in 1963, Toby went on to study computer processing at the Gale Institute in Indianapolis, IN. He then attended Dickinson State University. He had four daughters with his first wife, Judy (McLean) Koffler, whom he married in 1966. He served in the US Navy during Vietnam aboard the USS Bryce Canyon destroyer tender from 1966-1970. After working as a computer analyst at IBM and Westgate in San Diego, he returned to run the family farm in North Dakota in 1974. From 1982-1994, Toby served as the City of Dickinson’s Deputy and City Auditor. Toby married his high-school sweetheart, Jeanne Gilliland, in 1992 and served as the City Manager for the City of Liberal, KS from 1995-2006. He retired in Edmond, OK. Toby had an insatiable work ethic and sly sense of humor. His smirky smile and quick wit kept those around him on their toes. He taught his girls to have gratitude and grit. From DIY projects to database analytics, he was a fixer - always finding creative solutions for whatever problem he, or one of his girls, faced. Toby was soft-spoken, charming and respectful, but also had a mischievous side that included Harleys, Corvettes and some memorable pranks. In his spare time, Toby enjoyed woodworking, fishing, and westerns. He was an animal lover, a highly skilled gardener, and mashed potato master. Toby was also a gold-star grandfather - lovingly nicknamed “Grandpa-Bellyman” and “Grandpa Smurf” for the many zerberts and giggles he invoked. Toby took great pride in raising his daughters, cattle and wheat. He is loved by many and will be missed by all. Toby is preceded in death by his grandson, Alex Tobias Heinrich, son-in-law, Michael Heinrich, brothers-in-law, Curtis Rath & Ron Brost, parents, Alex & Mary, and beloved cocker spaniel, Joe Dog Stoke. He is survived by his wife, Jeanne Miller of Edmond, OK, daughters Kimberly Miller of Hebron, ND, Kelly Castano (Matt) of Sundance, WY, Deanna Harris (Chris) of Oklahoma City, OK, Dawn Walsh (Justin) of Fort Collins, CO, Pam Mowery (Mike) of Edmond,OK, and Lisa Duncan of Oklahoma City, OK. Siblings Marie Brost, Debbie Rath, Mark (Nona) Miller, Bobbi (Danny) Aus, and Rod (Pat) Miller as well as 10 grandchildren, 6 great-grandchildren and many well-loved nephews and nieces. Visitation will be held on Tuesday, December 14 from 12-7 pm. Funeral Services will be on Wednesday, December 15 at 2:00 pm at Crawford Funeral Service Chapel in Edmond, OK and will be live streamed for those not able to attend."
