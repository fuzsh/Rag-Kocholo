        "text": "Following a trial where they were found guilty of the murder of George Lynch, Wolda Gardner and Rickai Dickinson were both sentenced in Supreme Court this morning [Sept 17], receiving life sentences, with the condition they must serve 25 years before being eligible for parole.\n\nMr Lynch, was shot and killed while standing outside a Midland Heights Crescent, Hamilton Parish home at around 10.30pm on May 5th, 2010.\n\nOn the first count of the premeditated murder of Mr Lynch, each convicted man received a sentence of life in prison with a minimum of twenty-five years to be served before they can be considered eligible for any parole.\n\nOn the second count of using a firearm to commit the offence, each man was given a ten year sentence with this sentence to be served concurrent with the twenty-five year sentence.\n\nFor both men, time already spent in custody is to be taken into consideration.\n\nBefore sentence was passed, each man was asked if he had anything to say. Gardner, 34, [pictured] stood and claimed: “I had nothing to do with this crime.” Dickinson, 29, stood and replied: “No.”\n\nBefore handing down sentence, Justice Carlyle Greaves called it a “terrible case” that was a”aimed directly at the heart of our judicial system.”\n\nJustice Greaves said incidents surrounding the murder showed that there had been a deliberate and gang-related attempt to instil fear in both witnesses and members of the jury in a trial that had just ended on the night of the murder.\n\nJustice Greaves said: “Mr Lynch was a man who was making a contribution to society.”\n\nReferring to the fact that both convicted men had criminal records, Justice Greaves said these “are two people who have never made any contribution to the good of mankind. But they get to live on, at the expense of taxpayers including Mr Lynch’s family who are taxpayers.”\n\nSaying he is “bound by the rulings of the Privy Council,” Justice Greaves: “Because of the state of the law in this country, these two will one day walk free. It is no wonder that some say that there is no justice.”\n\nRead More About"
