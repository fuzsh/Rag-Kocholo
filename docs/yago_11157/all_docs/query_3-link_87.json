        "text": "Judy Wood passed away peacefully in her home on June 29th, 2022, with her husband by her side. She had a very hard battle with cancer. Judy was born in Dickinson, ND on May 9th, 1955. She is survived by her husband Allen Ray Wood. Judy owned a Donut Hole Bakery in Williston, ND. She moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana and worked at Kroger Grocery Store in the meat department. Judy was a co-owner of Knotwood Vinyl Products. She was also known as the “fence lady” since she installed most of the vinyl fences. She loved living on the river and being on the water in the pontoon boat. Judy loved music and dancing and could dance all night long. She would dance with her sisters, her husband or by herself. She is survived by eleven sisters, Angie Stockert, Diane Keck, Peggy Jurgens, Carol Carter, Jane Nichols, Mary Ann Johnson, Theresa Jurgens, Audrey Charchenko, Bernie Spradely, Christy Alexander, and Jacinta Skretteberg; and one brother Arnie Filipi. She was also the godmother for Nicholl Wolmarans.\n\nCondolences can be made at heritagefuneralhomellc.com."
