        "text": "March 5, 2020\n\nDear Gardner-Dickinson families,\n\nIn an effort to keep our students, employees and community well, Wynantskill UFSD is working closely with its health and safety consultant to monitor and distribute information released from the New York State Department of Health relating to the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\nThe district is also working diligently to keep the facilities clean and its faculty, staff and students educated on how to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nPlease see the following information from the NYS Department of Health:\n\nA new coronavirus called 2019 Novel (new) Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This virus had not been found in humans before. This coronavirus can lead to fever, cough and trouble breathing or shortness of breath. There are thousands of diagnosed cases in China and new cases being diagnosed in a number of countries including the United States.\n\nWhat do we know?\n\nSince this virus is very new, health authorities continue to carefully watch how this virus spreads. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working hard to learn as much as possible about this new virus, so that we can better understand how it spreads and causes illness. The CDC considers this virus to be a serious public health concern. Based on current information the CDC recommends avoiding travel to China. Updated travel information related to 2019-nCoV can be found here.\n\nHow Does 2019 Novel (New) Coronavirus Spread?\n\nHealth experts believe the virus probably spreads from animals to humans and from person to person. It’s not clear yet how easily the virus spreads from person-to-person. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not currently a concern for the general public and is not actively circulating among New Yorkers at this time. Therefore, there is no need to cancel school or social events, and there is no need for students or school staff to wear surgical masks at school.\n\nPrevention\n\nThere are currently no vaccines available to protect against this virus. The New York State Department of Health (DOH) recommends the following ways to minimize the spread of all respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV:\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\nStay home when you are sick.\n\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash.\n\nRoutinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\nSymptoms\n\nInformation to date suggests that 2019-nCoV causes mild-to-moderate illness and symptoms like the flu, including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.\n\nThis is an emerging, rapidly changing situation. For questions please contact your local department of health or the NYS DOH Novel Coronavirus hotline at 1-888-364-3065.\n\nWe encourage you to keep up to date about 2019-nCoV, its treatment and prevention by visiting the following websites:\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nCDC’s dedicated 2019-nCoV website\n\nNYSDOH’s dedicated 2019-nCoV website\n\nNYSDOH directory of local health departments\n\nNew York State Center for School Health website\n\nWe will continue to keep our community informed as guidance becomes available from the NYS Department of Health.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Thomas Reardon\n\nSuperintendent\n\nLibrary Media Specialist Linda Fecura would like to let families know that the school library has moved to a new eBook app and student account system that is easier for students to use and log in.\n\nThe library is now using the new Sora OverDrive app, which is designed for schools. The new system uses individual student accounts instead of a generic account that was used with OverDrive.\n\nStudents should now log in using their Wynantskill gmail accounts.\n\n“It’s really so much better. It’s much more appealing for students and they can make collections for their accounts,” said Ms. Fecura.\n\nIf parents have questions, please contact Ms. Fecura at lfecura@wynantskillufsd.org.\n\nWynantskill UFSD is pleased to announce the district has partnered with TSL Adventures to offer a before school program at Gardner-Dickinson from 7:30 to 8:00 a.m. for our students starting in September.\n\nTSL Adventures will also offer an afterschool program starting in September at Gardner-Dickinson. The program will replace the current Y-Time program, offering engaging, hands-on activities for our students as well as homework support. It will run after school until 6:00 p.m.\n\nRegistration for both programs will start March 1 at their website www.tsladventures.net. A representative will attend the Monday, Feb. 10 PTA meeting as well as an informational meeting on Monday, Feb. 24 for families who have questions.\n\nFamilies can also email tsladventures@gmail.com with questions.\n\nSuperintendent Dr. Thomas Reardon noted that TSL Adventures, which operates similar programs for other Capital Region schools, started a Pre-K afterschool program at Gardner-Dickinson in December. TSL Adventures was founded by three elementary school teachers with the goal of creating recreational programs rooted in cooperation and interactive play.\n\n“Our goal is to have two programs, one before school and one after, run by one provider. TSL Adventures had done a wonderful job with our Pre-K afterschool program and we’re excited about these new programs,” explained Dr. Reardon. “I’d like to thank the YMCA who has been a fantastic partner and we look forward to keeping our relationship with them for activities like Field Day in the future.”\n\nFormer Siena Saints and Harlem Globetrotters basketball player Tay Fisher visited Gardner-Dickinson School the week of of Jan. 6 to share a positive message with students.\n\nMr. Fisher spent Wednesday with younger students, teaching them basketball moves and talking to them about the importance of supporting each other and similar positive character lessons.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Fisher shared his life story with grades 7 and 8, speaking about challenges he overcame growing up and inspiring students to work hard and stay focused on things that are important to them.\n\n“What is your why? Why do you work hard?” Mr. Fisher asked students.\n\n“To make my family proud,” said one student.\n\n“To change people’s lives,” said another student.\n\nMr. Fisher praised students’ answers and noted how hard he had to work to earn his master’s degree from The College of St. Rose, which took him 10 years to complete because he was always traveling with the Harlem Globetrotters. He noted his motivation was to walk across the stage in front of his parents to make them proud.\n\nMr. Fisher also shared highlight videos of when he helped his Siena Saints team win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Championship as a senior and his time with the Harlem Globetrotters. While he loved traveling the world with the Harlem Globetrotters – visiting all 50 states and 75 countries – Mr. Fisher explained he retired so he could spend time with his wife and child.\n\n“I’m in a new chapter and my family is everything,” said Mr. Fisher.\n\nThank you so much for spending time with our students this week!\n\nMore photos"
