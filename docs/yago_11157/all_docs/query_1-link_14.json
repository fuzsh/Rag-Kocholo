        "text": "Jay Townsend\n\nVictory Is In Honor Of Mentor\n\nSun-Sentinel\n\nNovember 2, 1997\n\nJay Townsend wanted to honor his ailing mentor, and he could not think of a better tribute than to win the same golf tournament his teacher and friend once won.\n\nTownsend did just that when he defeated Rodney Butcher on the third playoff hole Saturday in a dramatic Florida Open finale at Palm-Aire Country Club\n\nTownsend, 35, dedicated the victory to Gardner Dickinson, the seven-time PGA Tour winner who became a popular instructor. Dickinson, 70, uses a wheelchair and is battling the effects of a stroke compounded by heart and kidney problems.\n\n\"It means a lot to me because of that,\" Townsend said. \"I wanted to emulate him.\" Dickinson used to teach Townsend, and they still live in the same Tequesta neighborhood.\n\n\"Gardner's not doing very well,\" Townsend said. \"It's all that time he spent with me at no charge that allows me to be the player I am today, and to provide a living for my family. You can't imagine the depth of knowledge and insight he gave to me.\"\n\nWhen Townsend was 18, Dickinson would invite him out to play at Frenchman's Creek. Townsend was a sponge, sucking up every bit of instruction Dickinson would offer. Dickinson, after all, was one of the game's best teachers. \"We'd spend every day together,\" Townsend said of that summer.\n\nTownsend said he saw Dickinson on Wednesday, the first day of the Florida Open . Dickinson's health problems began in 1989 when he had triple-bypass surgery. He suffered his first stroke four years later. He has also endured kidney problems.\n\nJudy Dickinson, 47, Gardner's wife, has taken a leave of absence from a successful LPGA career to care for her husband this year. She is also taking care of their 8-year-old twin boys. Townsend said he was inspired by Gardner during Saturday's gut-wrenching final round. \"Out on the course, I would picture him,\" Townsend said.\n\nTownsend, a veteran European Tour player, gained some meaningful momentum in his bid to win a PGA Tour card at Qualifying School this winter. He also hopes he made his mentor proud."
