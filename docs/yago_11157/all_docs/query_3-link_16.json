        "text": "Judith Dickinson was born to be an artist.\n\nWhen she was eight, numerous artists saw her talent and offered to teach her.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate to continue my art education through the years working under some top artists, most recently Craig Tennant, Anthony Ryder and Michael Shane Neal,” Dickinson said.\n\nDickinson naturally developed the talent to oil paint portraits in accurate detail, depicting nature and contemporary life.\n\nSouthwest Art Magazine, Art Collector Magazine and Art of the West Magazine have also featured Dickinson’s work.\n\nDickinson said she didn’t go to college for art, where the lessons were on abstract art. She preferred painting realism, so she got her degree in education in Philadelphia at Cairn University but continued to paint when she could.\n\nDickinson brings the emotions and character of a real-life figure or scene to her paintings. She primarily paints portraits of clients and people around the world.\n\nDickinson said she had painted portraits of famous people, such as Judge Judy and Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as paintings of many Christian leaders. She also did portraits for former Colorado Governor Bill Ritter and his wife.\n\n“Portrait commissions are what pays the most,” she said. “Portraits are very hard to do because each person is so different and you’ve got to be right on.”\n\nMove to Colorado\n\nDickinson grew up in New Jersey on 700 acres of wooded countryside with lakes. She moved to Colorado in 1996.\n\n“I do miss the trees, but I love Colorado for the sunshine every day,” Dickinson said.\n\nDickinson moved to Brighton in 2007, and her art career expanded.\n\n“When we drove into Brighton, it was a small town, and many places were boarded up with Christmas decorations that were still up in March,” she said.\n\nDickinson found an 1888 historic home for sale and decorated it with antiques from New Jersey.\n\n“The home was owned by the first sheriff of Brighton, J.P. Higgins, who later became the third mayor. We love the house,” Dickinson said.\n\nDickinson said the city of Brighton offered them the former empty police station to turn into Main Street Gallery to help revitalize downtown.\n\nIts gallery houses Colorado artists, also called the Main Street Creatives, offering art classes and hosting receptions. It also has ten studio spaces.\n\n“We have great teachers teaching 16 to 20 artists, running studios and showing in the gallery. …It’s wonderful that the city enables us to do that, “Dickinson said.\n\nDickinson Art Studio is in the old jail of the police building.\n\n“I come to jail every day to do my art,” she said with a laugh. “I come to my studio six days a week because I love it.”\n\nWork in Africa\n\nDickinson and her husband’s lives changed when they went to work in Africa to start an orphanage in Uganda and work with the pygmy tribes in Rwanda.\n\nWhat inspired Judith and Gary Dickinson to open an orphanage in Uganda? Gary was a professor at a New Jersey University with several African students, and one of them was like a brother to them.\n\n“We were sending money for special projects,” Judith said.\n\nJudith said Gary traveled to Uganda, and a person he helped invited him to come to a remote village to thank him. When he arrived, he found many kids running around.\n\n“This guy was trying to take these children in, they were living off the land and barely went to school. Gary said we can’t do everything, but this is one thing we can focus on, so it’s when he started the orphanage,” Judith said.\n\nJudith continued her passion for painting art and making a living to help sponsor the kids.\n\nJudith said her painting sales went toward her work in Africa, and they continue to work there today. Gary goes three to four times a year, and she goes occasionally.\n\n“A friend told us about a pygmy tribe that lives in poverty, so we went to work with two other tribes that had never learned to read or write,” Judith said.\n\nDickinson said the kids have been in school for eight years now, and they rebuilt their huts. They are being taught how to farm and are receiving clean water and medical care.\n\nDickinson said they took their grandchildren, three sons and their wives to Africa in June.\n\n“They got to see how the other side of the world lives,” she said."
