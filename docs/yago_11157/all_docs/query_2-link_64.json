        "text": "Although he never ran for political office, Walter Gardner Hall has been described as one of the most influential “behind the scenes” leaders in League City’s history.\n\nHall, a longtime League City resident, had a long and distinguished career in banking in the Houston-Galveston Bay Area, but it was the decades he spent in civic service that resulted in extraordinary progress for League City, Galveston County, and beyond.\n\nBanking\n\nIn 1931, Hall became a cashier of a very small bank in League City, and from his modest start he eventually became President and Chairman of the Executive Committee at four banks in the Bay Area—League City State Bank, Alvin State Bank, Webster State Bank, and Citizen State Bank in Dickinson. Hall had a belief that a bank should be an institution of service to the community and practiced this philosophy throughout his entire life—using his banks to assist each city, including League City, to grow and prosper.\n\nPublic Service\n\nWhile Hall expanded his activities in the banking business, he also gave his time and efforts toward developing and improving the condition of League City and Galveston County. Hall was president of the First Board of Directors for the Galveston County Water and Improvement District #2 in League City, during which time the first water and sewer system was built in the city. He also worked to promote water districts in Dickinson, La Marque, Hitchcock, and Kemah. In 1943, he was appointed to the Board of Directors to the San Jacinto Water Authority and elected president, helping to grow the agency for 11 years. Hall is also credited with the incorporation of the Clear Creek Independent School District in 1948 and pushing the incorporation of League City in 1962.\n\nAfter World War II, Hall was named Chairman of the Galveston County Postwar Planning Committee, which started the ball rolling for the extension of the seawalls in Texas City and Galveston, for the county courthouse and jail, for the mainland hospital, and for a road and drainage program.\n\nIn 1961, Mr. Hall was instrumental in getting then Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson and Senator Ralph Yarborough to come to the area to view the damage caused by Hurricane Carla, which resulted in setting up a program that was the fastest disbursement of Small Business Administration money ever accomplished. This provided salvation for small businesses and individuals who had lost their homes in the area.\n\nPolitics\n\nDubbed “Mr. Democrat,” Hall was a politically active liberal Democrat his entire life on both the state and national level and forged a relationship with President Lyndon B. Johnson and congressional leader Sam Rayburn. His influence helped several state and congressional senators and representatives in their political campaigns to get elected or re-elected and served as a member of the State Democratic Executive Committee and as a delegate to numerous state and national Democratic conventions. It is even speculated that he played a role in convincing Lyndon B. Johnson to bring the space industry to the Bay Area, which welcomed NASA in 1963.\n\nCivil Rights Advocate\n\nOne of Walter Hall’s most important contributions didn’t occur in the Bay Area, or in Texas at all—but its outcome was of national significance. Hall helped fund a lawsuit against a discriminatory Mississippi television station in the late 1960s. The suit went to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. Famed judge, Warren Burger—who was sworn in as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the same day—ruled in favor of Hall’s group, Civic Communications Corp. They were eventually awarded the license to operate the station. Hall ensured that Civic Communications Corp. was comprised of black Civil Rights leaders and advocates. The group’s attorney, Martin Firestone, remarked, “Mr. Hall, in my opinion, was primarily responsible for forcing open the door to minority ownership and operation of telecommunications facilities in the country.”"
