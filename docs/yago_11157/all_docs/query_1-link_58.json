        "text": "Wow. Another week of the FedEx Fall swing of the PGA TOUR and another very emotional victory. This time it was Camilo Villegas who won his first title in nine years. He dedicated his win to the 22-month-old daughter that he and his wife, Mia, lost in 2020.\n\nVillegas was entered into the Second Stage of PGA TOUR Q-School presented by Korn Ferry (yes, that is the official name), before his runner-up finish at the World Wide Technology Championship. That finish earned him an exemption into the final stage and then his trip back to the winner’s circle at the Bermuda Championship secured his spot on the PGA TOUR for next year.\n\nThe last few weeks have given us compelling storylines in tournaments lacking the biggest names. The only problem is that you have to watch the re-broadcast on the Golf Channel on Monday because you’re watching football on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThis week the TOUR is on St. Simon Island, GA, for the RSM Classic at the Sea Island Golf Club (Seaside Course). This tournament debuted in 2010 so we’re going back to 1971 and the Atlanta Golf Classic where 135-pound Gardner Dickinson fought off the sizzling temperatures and the game’s heavyweights to win his seventh career title, the first since 1969. Scroll down to read how he did it.\n\nWe lost another prominent member of the tour from the time we cover with the passing of R.H. Sikes. Sikes joined the tour in 1964 after a stellar amateur career where he won the 1961 and 1962 U.S. Amateur Public Links and the 1963 NCAA Individual Championship and played in three Masters. He was named Rookie of the Year by Golf Digest after winning the Sahara Invitational beating Jack Nicklaus, Jack McGowan, and Phil Rodgers by two strokes. He also won the 1966 Cleveland Open and appeared in the Masters four more times as a professional. R.I.P. R.H. Sikes.\n\nHave you ever caddied? Ever have a conversation like this one?

The latest one aired live on Netflix, the Netflix Cup, on Tuesday night from Las Vegas. It teamed up PGA professionals with F1 drivers.\n\nThe broadcast had a lot going on, some good (Marshawn Lynch doing the flyovers, Joel Dahman doing commentary, and the expert trash talking of Max Homa and Justin Thomas), some bad (technical difficulties throughout the broadcast, the creepy Sphere, the lack of a go-cart race between the F1 drivers).\n\nAnd there was also this:\n\nSo, our question this week is simple.

The field included all the superstars of the game but in the first round the only thing hotter than the weather was 24-year-old Johnny Miller of San Francisco who shot a 65.\n\nHe held a two-stroke lead over Ray Floyd, Jack Nicklaus, Dave Eichelberger, and Orville Moody. Lee Trevino was another stroke back tied with Gardner Dickinson while Gary Player was another stroke back at 69.\n\n“I went to the MacGregor factory to have them look at my clubs. They were all haywire. Some were too stiff, some not stiff enough. I was having trouble clubbing myself, and there’s no wonder for it.”\n\nSince a runner-up finish in the Masters in April, Miller had been struggling to get out of a slump.\n\n“I’ve missed the cut the last two weeks in a row,” Miller said to reporters, “and I went to the MacGregor factory to have them look at my clubs. They were all haywire. Some were too stiff, some not stiff enough. I was having trouble clubbing myself, and there’s no wonder for it.”\n\nFor his part, Nicklaus, who was coming off a three-week layoff from the tour, had a warning for the other players telling reporters, “I’m playing very, very well.”\n\nNicklaus backed up his words with a second-round 68 to tie for the lead with Johnny Miller who shot a 70.\n\n“I played all right,” Nicklaus said after his round. “I hit a couple of bad shots on the back nine and I got pretty cautious with my swing.”\n\nBoth Nicklaus and Miller birdied the first two holes and Nicklaus went on to add birdies at the eighth and ninth holes and offset a bogey on 15th hole with a birdie at the final hole. Miller, on the other hand, could do no better than two birdies and two bogeys on the back nine.\n\n“Play was slow because of the heat and several lost balls in front of me and standing in that sun was really hard.”\n\nMiller talked with reporters after his round and said after birdieing the first two holes, “I was off to the races, I thought. But after those two holes, I just didn’t get any momentum. Play was slow because of the heat and several lost balls in front of me and standing in that sun was really hard.”\n\nThe veteran Dickinson added a second straight 68 and stood alone in third place, one shot back of Miller and Nicklaus. The players another stroke back, at 137 included Player, Floyd, Tom Weiskopf and Eichelberger.\n\nThe weather continued to broil in Saturday’s third round as Gary Player came out charging with a 5-under-par 67 giving him a total of 204 and a one-stroke lead over Nicklaus and Dickinson. The final hole provided a slew of action as Player, playing in front of the group of Nicklaus and Dickinson, put his second shot on the par 5 finishing hole into a bunker. Wearing all white in lieu of his customary all black outfits, Player climbed into the bunker, splashed his shot out of the sand to seven feet from the hole and then drained the putt for a birdie.\n\nNicklaus had to scramble for his par after going into the water on the last hole and the 43-year-old Dickinson secured a birdie at the final hole.\n\nAt 207 were Trevino who shot a third round 68, Floyd who shot a 69, and Johnny Miller who shot a 71. Floyd’s round was particularly up-and-down as he finished his round with four birdies and a closing eagle.\n\n“I’ve got to make it interesting,” Floyd quipped after his round. “You can’t just have a dull round.”\n\nOn a hot and humid day with temperatures above 90 degrees that drained energy from all the players, it was one of the oldest men in the field playing in his 14th consecutive tournament of the year who emerged in Sunday’s fourth round. The 135-pound, chain-smoking Dickinson came into the Atlanta Classic in the 53rd spot on the money list with winnings of only $21,439 but he fought off the game’s superstars coming down the stretch.\n\nThe crowd whooped and hollered in support of Nicklaus, Player, and Trevino and overlooked the veteran Dickinson as the back nine turned into a pressure-cooker. At one time or another Dickinson, Nicklaus, and Player held the lead. The drama would come down to the final two holes.\n\nWhile Nicklaus and Trevino played the par 5 final hole, Player and Dickinson were playing the 17th hole. Player had the lead at 13-under-par, Dickinson and Nicklaus were at 12-under-par while Trevino was at 11-under. By this time, Miller had shot himself out of contention on his way to a final round 72.\n\nPlayer, usually one of the best bunker players on tour, bogeyed from the bunker while Dickinson made par from the bunker leaving the two players tied with Nicklaus at 12-under. At the same time, Nicklaus made a two-putt birdie on the 18th to go to 13-under. Trevino’s eagle putt at the last hole, which he needed to get to 13-under, just missed.\n\nBoth Player and Dickinson needed birdies on the last hole to tie Nicklaus. Both men put their second shots into the bunker fronting the green. Player blasted out to seven feet and then missed his birdie putt leaving him at 12-under. Dickinson splashed his bunker shot to two-feet and calmly made his birdie putt to tie Nicklaus and force a sudden-death playoff.\n\nThe playoff began at the first hole, and Dickinson put his approach shot to within 10 feet of the pin while Nicklaus hit his shot over the green.\n\n“It was a good wedge shot,” Nicklaus insisted after the playoff, “but the ball took a bad slip and ran 23 or 24 feet past the flag.”\n\nFrom there, Nicklaus hit a runner that he was able to get up close to the hole, just three feet away, and then stood back to watch Dickinson attempt his ten-foot putt. Dickinson missed the putt and then prepared to go to the next tee swapping out his putter for his driver in his bag before focusing his attention on Nicklaus. But Nicklaus missed the short putt and Dickinson won his first title since 1969. It was the first time he won a sudden-death playoff in three tries. The whole affair boiled down to putting.\n\n“What can I say?” Nicklaus mused. “I thought that little ol’ three-footer was going to break and darn if it didn’t go straight as an arrow.”\n\n“I’ve been having a lot of trouble with my putting,” Dickinson explained after the round. “This was the first time in a long time that I haven’t been plagued by a lot of three-putt greens. Anytime I can avoid that, I’m ahead of the game.”\n\nWith the superstars of the game in attendance, it was a diminutive, 43-year-old veteran who was able to master the heat of the weather to take home the $25,000 first place check in the Atlanta Classic.\n\n“He’s a tough little man,” was all that Nicklaus could say about Dickinson after the playoff.\n\nShare\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Threads\n\nTour Backspin Playlist\n\nLISTEN NOW ON PASTDAILY.COM (player is embedded under second photo)\n\nThanks for reading!
