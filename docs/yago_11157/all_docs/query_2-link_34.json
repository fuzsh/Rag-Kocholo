As a scholar, she was awarded The Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome and a Fulbright Fellowship in support of her research focused on Italian Politics and Political Philosophy.\n\nShe was a faculty member for 17 years (University of South Carolina and The Ohio State University) before moving on into academic administration. Beverly served as a senior academic administrator for 30 years (Dean of Arts and Sciences at Fairfield University, Associate Provost and VP for Internationalization at Pace University, and Provost and Academic Vice President at SUNY Farmingdale State College). During her career she authored and directed $20 million in institutional grants – including the following at Farmingdale: Title III, SSS TRIO, and First in the World FIPSE from the US Dept of Education, Smart Grid from the Dept of Energy, and an NSF S-STEM grant. She also served as Fulbright Advisor at Fairfield, Pace, and Farmingdale, launching competitions and helping more than 60 undergraduate students win Fulbright Scholarships for study and research abroad. She has been recognized for her advocacy in support of students and affirmative action at each of the five institutions where she has worked. She is dedicated to – and has expertise and experience in – increasing opportunities for minority, low income, and first-generation college students.\n\nSince retiring in fall 2020 Beverly has continued to offer (with her husband Robert Kahn) workshops on grant writing at universities across the nation. She also assists individuals in crafting grant proposals."
