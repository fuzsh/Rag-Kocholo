        "text": "The Dickinson Home and Emily’s Room with her Writing Desk\n\nThe Case for George Gould:\n\nNew Day:\n\nMarch 6, 2013: NYC … Grey overcast, one big cloud. Threatening to snow and then rain. Something’s always threatening. Spring, it ain’t sprung yet.\n\nMy uncle was a jellyfish, somehow we’ve grown apart. JD\n\nAIM: This blog aims to examine and help unravel the complex love-life of Emily Dickinson (ED). Much is blank and/or covered in shade. Conflicting interests have removed evidence. Many biographies have been published and have constructed the image of Emily Dickinson that has become the canon, but her actual position regarding romantic love and sex has remained ambiguous. Many enthusiastic writers have either followed one thread or another and created whole fantasies based on very little fact. In their defense, I offer that no clear picture was available to them from actual records. In 1930, Genevieve Taggard, introduced the thesis that George Gould was the actual lover and central figure Dickinson refers to in many of her love poems. Moreover, Taggard offered testimony from various individuals alive at the time that George Gould had asked for Emily’s hand and that Edward Dickinson had effectively terminated it. This valuable work was attacked, denied and most importantly critically ignored. This blog re-examines this case with the added insight of the many written treaties introduced since, and the additional evidence that has since been uncovered including the writings of Dickinson’s previously unknown childhood music teacher, Ann Eliza Houghton Penniman.\n\nEmily Dickinson (ED) as most middle-class, lively, educated women of her time played piano and sang some. New evidence suggests that she took lessons from Ann Eliza Houghton Penniman (EHP) beginning at age 8 years old. Penniman was sixteen at the time. It appears that CDA has evidence that EHP was young Emily’s piano teacher and thus, had early contact and intimacy with the Dickinson family. To me, she should be a very credible witness. Anyone, who gives lessons to children in their own home cannot help but get involved, especially with bright, vibrant young ones as ED was. The Penneman papers are the original work of Carol Damon Andrews. Andrews reports that EHP, the music teacher, states in her memoir or diary :\n\nIn Amherst … I had a class in music: … Emily Dickinson, daughter of lawyer Dickinson, to whom Dr. George Gould of Worcester, was engaged when in college there. Lawyer Dickinson vetoed the whole affair, the Rev. George being a POOR student then, and poor Emily’s heart was broken.\n\nThis is a critical statement around which much hinges and revolves. Is it true? If anyone has any evidence or reason to suggest that it ‘is’ or ‘is not’ true, please come forward and state your case. I have read everything that I could find that pertains and can only say that I believe it to be true. Moreover, I see no reason against it- why should it not be ‘true.’\n\nGeorge Gould: Born Feb. 1827 D. 1899; Lived to 73 years of age:\n\nHe was 3 years older than Emily and lived in nearby New Braintree, up the road from the Houghton Farm . He was a classmate and close friend of Austin’s at Amherst Academy. He visited the Dickinson household at least from 1849 to 1852, and perhaps earlier. Gould was lean, tall and a ready wit. The winter of 1849 was spoken of as “alive with fun” for ED, 19 years old. As a close friend of Austin’s, he entered the Dickinson home as a compatriot, a classmate, a friend. He was known as an excellent public speaker and competed with Austin in rhetorical platforms. His commencement speech was acknowledged in The Franklin and Hampshire Express as abounding in “glowing thought.” She wrote the 1852 Valentine with him in mind.\n\nStriking but, poor!\n\nHe was bright and striking, but poor. His was a charity case at Amherst. His father was a shoemaker, a bootmaker – dirty hand-labor. George worked summers at farm work for money. The lack of money and ‘good’ family, suggested poor breeding to the sober Edward Dickinson. No prospects. This is not what he had in mind for ED. Moreover, he wanted to keep Emily home for his own reasons, for his own care and well being.\n\nGeorge Gould was ‘engaged to Emily’ and Lawyer Dickinson had vetoed it! Little is known about this important episode in the life of Emily Dickinson. Letters from ED to George Gould have disappeared (Gould, late in life, states that he had kept a pack of them for many years). These letters have disappeared. Likely, they were not very much appreciated by his wife of many years. That Lawyer Dickinson rejected George Gould is just what one might expect in this New England society of upwardly aiming Christians. The Dickinson’s were accomplished town people who lived in stone houses on Main Streets and traveled in the best of circles. Emily was Edward Dickinson’s favorite daughter; he had her well-educated and she was charming, capable and musical. Moreover, as the mother became more and more ill, and was less able to do the house chores, both Emily and Lavinia were called upon to keep the household going. Emily did the baking she was good at it. It was Baking is Chemistry after all. For obvious reasons, Edward Dickinson was not prepared to give up his talented daughter to this young man.\n\nGeorge Gould was ‘engaged to Emily’ and Lawyer Dickinson had vetoed it!

The previous year, Emily Dickinson had been retrieved by brother Austin from Mt. Holyoke Female Seminary (later Mt. Holyoke College) in March 1848) and returned home without completing her school year. Something was awry. The explanations given for why she left so abruptly differ considerably. She may have in been poor health (physical or mental?); her father may have needed or wanted to have her at home; she may have asked to come home disliking the discipline-minded teachers or the Religious fervor and the Evangelical teachings current there. By her own admission she was considered of have little “hope” of “accepting Christ” in the clear and Evangelical manner that was popular at that institution at that time. It is unlikely that this was a light event.\n\nThis stage was set. The characters were fixed in time and place. The previous year, Emily Dickinson had been retrieved by brother Austin from Mt.

By her own admission she was considered of have little “hope” of “accepting Christ” in the clear and Evangelical manner that was popular at that institution at that time. It is unlikely that this was a light event.\n\nAlthough, this has been often reported, rarely has it been examined or questioned. This period is critical since no clear state of mind can be established; up until this time, she was said to be a bright, healthy young girl. The fact remains that at 18 years of age, she left school and was home in her father’s house and likely anxious, bored and feeling rather stuck in a cultural mud with a frightened ‘what comes next’ feeling. Modern physiology tells us now, clearly, that the biologically active molecules of adolescence were flowing throughout he body in high concentrations and that boys or men were, likely, on her mind. Austin brings home bright, handsome young friends and ED responds as a healthy young woman might be expected to. Anyone with younger sisters (I had 2 younger sisters) can give support to the notion that they react readily and charmingly to tall and interesting friends. That ED could easily fall under the spell of George Gould is not a great stretch. It is now part of the generally accepted view that Gould was the likely recipient of the notorious ‘Valentine’ that was published in the Indicator. If these facts and events are true, that is, if Emily Dickinson was attracted to and actually engaged to George Gould and that her father somehow put and end to this affair, the consequences could be significant and far reaching for all concerned.\n\nHow charming: Bright young thing, 22 years old, meets bright young thing 19 years old. Summer heat, lively talk, hormones and life ahead unknown but, with all possibilities still open. Human nature would suggest that bonding between ED and GG could very well occur. What happened? Who was the initiator? Was the love mutual? Was there an imbalance in the lover – loved dance? Little documentation exists other than Emily’s Valentine published in the Indicator where Gould was Chief Editor.\n\nNote: Read another section of this blog that discusses the Dickinson poem ‘He touched me.’\n\nHow charming: Bright young thing, 22 years old, meets bright young thing 19 years old.

Little documentation exists other than Emily’s Valentine published in the Indicator where Gould was Chief Editor.\n\nNote: Read another section of this blog that discusses the Dickinson poem ‘He touched me.’\n\nWhat happened to George? Well it appears that he went on.\n\nGeorge Gould graduated Amherst College in 1850 and attended various Seminary Schools (Union Theological in New York 1850-51 ad 1852-53; Andover Theological, 1851.) Upon completing his studies he did not take a position as a minister. He did not settle in\n\nNew England, he left. In 1853 he went west (‘by reason of ill-health’) and worked at building railroads in Illinois and Wisconsin. A minister in the western frontier building railroads with ill-health, why? I suggest that one good reason would be that he was trying to improve his financial position. He was trying to not be poor. When did he get ill, before or after leaving New England?\n\nNo dates, records or witnesses are available that give clear testimony as to the mental states of the various members of the Dickinson household. We do know that George Gould went on to work in the construction of the new railroad lines in Minnesota and Wisconsin territories. His general health is not clearly known. It is suggested that he was frail and concerned about ill-health. He contracted a malignant form of malaria while in the frontier territories of Wisconsin either from the draining of swamps or from other railroad workers, possibly asian migrants from the west coast. It has been pointed out that the now available Master Letters written by ED contain enquiries into the health of the intended. Poor health shadowed Gould all his life, it appears. This may have been a contributing factor in his lack of a more energetic pursuit of his romantic relations with Emily Dickinson. If, he had been rejected by the Father as indicated, I suggest that bruised feelings could well contribute to his general, not feeling well; no records of what happened after the aborted engagement are available.\n\nMoreover, the ‘Master Letters’ suggest to the various academics who have studied them that there likely was one living, red-blooded person who was the intended love object referred to in these letters. Moreover, it has been pointed out that Dickinson repeatedly refers to and made inquires into the ‘health’ of this individual. This tends to suggest that the ailing and worried George Gould could very likely be the intended ‘Master’ in these Letters. These letters had poems written on the reverse sides and could be the reason why they remain; they were simply overlooked. I further suggest that there may have been a clear effort to wipe out the evidence that would shed light on this episode. We do not know if final versions were ever sent or received. This was not a pretty chapter in either the Dickinson or Gould households and could understandingly have been suppressed. Further academic work has noted the apparent time parallels of Goulds European travels, especially in Italy, and dated references in Dickinson’s poetry. A correlation has been suggested establishing the Emily Dickinson had George Gould on her mind. I maintain that he was very likely the intended lover that she remained faithful to and addresses in these un-delivered drafts.\n\nThe soul selects her own society then shuts the door ED\n\nThe soul selects her own society then shuts the door;\n\nOn her divine majority obtrude no more.\n\nUnmoved, she notes the chariot’s pausing at her low gate;\n\nUnmoved, an emperor is kneeling upon her mat.\n\nI’ve known her from an ample nation choose one;\n\nthen close the valves of her attention like stone.\n\nMany ED poems refer to this one, human Lover. She suggests that the soul selects one of many; I suggest that she chose George Gould, a logical choice, both being bright, lively and spiritual – budding intellectuals. It appears logical that the stars had aligned and were set to bind these two individuals as lovers. The lovers, however, became derailed, trapped. Fate stepped in. There were consequences to Edward Dickinson’s veto. Gould’s ego was likely hurt, his health was poor and his confidence damaged. How could he preach of love; how could he regain his self-respect after such a rejection. His extensive travels after school to me are a symbolic wandering and aimless search for guidance and healing. Emily Dickinson’s situation was also frightening and grim. She was alone and suffering with too much aimless time on her hands. Absence might well have made the ‘Heart Grow Fonder.’ Emily sits home suffering while he roams the earth far away. He went to Europe on extended travel – July 1857 to Jan. 1860 presumably to regain his health. Where did the money come from? The Penniman papers state that he “finally married” Ellen Grout, 22 years old in 1862; he was 35 years old at this time. This is the same year that the poetic output of Emily Dickinson is said to reach a peak in poetic output(1862). Is this poetic peak activity a coincidence or is it due to a heightened state of mental excitement or awareness that her man was gone, no longer to be hoped for in this life? Could this be her ‘draught of life’ that is now over, her ‘single dram of heaven.’ Had she been sitting and waiting for her man to come back and now, finally coming to terms with the idea that he is now really gone for good, married to another woman, a younger woman.\n\n‘That love is all there is, Is all we know of love…\n\nT’is fitting that the freight is proportional to the groove.’ ED\n\nThis is among her many observations on Love and the pain involved. Remember the Peter & Gordon lyrics, ‘Please lock me away…and don’t allow the day…here inside, where I hide with my loneliness…I don’t care what they say…I won’t stay in a world without love… Birds sing out of tune and rain clouds hide the moon, I’m okay, here I stay with my loneliness…; could this not be a similar sentiment. I do not mean to cheapen dear Emily Dickinson, nor make her to be sentimental and weak, but I do mean to point out that she was a human and very feeling person, a sensitive, intelligent woman trapped in her time. It is very frightening to be trapped. Sometimes being sensitive and intelligent only serves to make things worse, increases the pain of being lonely and frightened.\n\nNew Data: Thank You, Mike Kelly!\n\nOn the back side of an original poem sheet containing the poem “I suppose the time will come…” (Johnson #1381; Amherst Manuscript #240) there appears to be a draft? or a Letter from George Gould to Emily Dickinson. This letter can be viewed on-line and is difficult to make out. I made a blowup and found it to read as follows:\n\nCandy Rolling II\n\nMr Gould will be happy to see Miss Dickinson at Miss Montagues this evening at (2 or 5) o’clock.\n\nFeb. ( 14 or 18) –\n\nIt would be very useful to know the year that this was written. The Front side contains a poem by Dickinson beginning with ‘I suppose the time will come …’\n\nThe hand writings are different- poem to note. The Gould note suggests a meeting at Miss Montagues between ED and GG planned and likely to have taken place. Moreover, many other meetings may have taken place, who knows? This is only a fragment of suggestive evidence that a relationship between them was beginning, or perhaps ending, one can’t be sure.\n\nWho is Miss Montague? I searched and remain confused. There is an Old Aunt Montague mentioned in an 18 April 1842 letter to brother Austin. There is Zebina Montague, second cousin to Edward Dickinson who is purported to have Epilepsy. There is a Town named Montague in the vicinity of Amherst. There is a Montague place mentioned in a letter to Austin in 1852. Then there is a mention of a Miss Montague as a title that a Dr. Thompson refers to in a letter responding to Emily. In short, it remains unclear who or what Miss Montague is. It might be an alias or secret name. Who knows? It may also refer to a Montague as a Gould relation since Gould claimed a relation to Patrick Henry and the Henry’s were related to the Montagues. Very complicated, but the note is very real.\n\nIt would be very useful to know the year that this was written.

Very complicated, but the note is very real.\n\nMale-friends: I suggest that Emily Dickinson through adolescence and beyond, say till the mid-twenties was essentially bright, lively and healthy. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that she was sexually alive and interested although, perhaps, not very active. If this is true, it is not surprising then that specific boys and men were friends and even objects of her affection or young love at times in her adolescence. Boyfriends is a silly term, I don’t believe even used at the time, but sixteen year old girls have crushes on boys of corresponding age, obviously, more or less. Young girls may even have crushes on older men, slightly older men, Benjamin Newton, her father’s law clerk for example, but not sixty year old men.\n\nThis is an important notion as regards ED. Of course, at various times she likely had many relationships and multifaceted interests and perhaps love interests in various people but, it is important to try to distinguish between them. It might be useful to roughly categorize these relationships as family; mentor and/or practically useful; business; friendship; and love interests. In Emily Dickinson’s case, her poetry was her business! Moreover, I suggest that people who write poetry are searching in some sense for human contacts who understand and who could possibly provide support and direction. I say this from personal experience. Emily Dickinson was looking for love anywhere and everywhere, but did so in a manner in balance with her pride and New England dignity. She was a Dickinson after all, her father’s daughter.\n\nThe current position in this blog (until contradictory evidence is found) remains that George Gould was her primary love interest from when Austin brought him home (1848?) till when he married another woman, Ellen Grout (1862). Of course Emily was interested in other people, other men. While visiting Washington, D.C. she even met a Supreme Court Justice with whom she got along famously, but he was not a serious love interest. Of course, she was interested in Benjamin Newton (b. 1821; d. 1853), a law student in her father’s office and, perhaps, there was even a little love in it. He went on, with his business, married and then died soon after. He was an older, loving mentor-no sex involved. His death was a sad blow for her reflecting on the cruel nature of death around her. Leonard Humphrey was also a probable love interest. He was six years older and already principal of Amherst Academy while Emily attended in her final year, 1847. In the years of 1846 to 1852 she along with Humphrey and Gould were tight and wonderful friends, soulmates, I suggest. They each were brilliant and intellectually involved with each other. They shared books and ideas and fun whenever possible. Humphrey at that time had another love interest and then died of a ‘brain disease’ at 25. This has been thought to have been a brain aneurism, a stroke; in any event. he died suddenly and tragically for Emily.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that death and waning possibilities were surrounding her in the war years of 1862-63, years of increased emphasis on poetry as more serious business. I will try to examine the possible nature of the various love-interests that have been suggested in the literature over the years as time and interest permits.\n\nSummary Evidence:\n\nThe Genevieve Taggard biography: The Life and Mind of Emily Dickinson, A.A. Knopf, 1930 Her central thesis is that George Gould is the intended lover. It includes testimonial evidence that sister Lavinia Dickinson, before her death, (and others including Mrs Maggie Mahar, the servant in the Dickinson household), had confided in Mrs. Aurelia Hinsdale that the Rev. George H. Gould was the intended lover and that her father, Edward Dickinson had forbade the match. I recommend the full biography for a more complete review of the case made by Taggard.\n\n2. The Music teacher, Ann Eliza Houghton Penniman, papers. The excellent case made by Carol Damon Andrews in the New England Quarterly, June 2008.\n\n3. The meeting of Emily and George in Mrs Montague’s house referred to in a note on the reverse side of Candy Rolling (see above), an original poem document of Emily Dickinson in her own hand.\n\n4. The 1850 Valentine:\n\nThis note ran without a by-line in the February 1850 issue of The Indicator, Amherst’s monthly newspaper, as a sort of Valentine. George Gould was the Chief Editor at that time along with 4 others.\n\nTo George H. Gould; February 1850\n\nMagnum bonum, “harum scarum,” zounds et zounds, et war alarum, man reforam, life perfectum, mundum changum, all things flarum\n\nSir, I desire an interview; meet me at sunrise, or sunset, or the new moon—the place is immaterial. In gold, or in purple, or sackcloth—I look not up on the raiment. With sword, or with pen, or with plough—the weapons are less than the wielder. In coach, or in wagon, or walking, the equipage far from the man. With soul, or spirit, or body, they are all alike to me. With host or alone, in sunshine or storm, in heaven or earth, some how or no how—I propose, sir, to see you.\n\nAnd not to see merely, but a chat, sir, or a tete-a-tete, a confab, a mingling of opposite minds is what I propose to have. I feel sir that we shall agree. We will be David and Jonathan, or Damon and Pythias, or what is better, the United States of America. We will talk over what we have learned in our geographies and listened to from the pulpit, the press and the Sabbath School.\n\nThis is strong language sir, but none the less true. So hurrah for North Carolina, since we are on this point.\n\nOur friendship sir, shall endure till sun and moon shall wane no more, till stars shall set, and victims rise to grace the final sacrifice. We’ll be instant, in season, out of season, minister, take care of, cherish, sooth, watch wait, doubt, refrain, reform, elevate, instruct. All choice spirits however distant ours, ours theirs; there is a thrill of sympathy—a circulation of mutuality—cognationem inter nos! I am Judith the heroine of the Apocrypha, and you the orator of Ephesus.\n\nThat’s what they call a metaphor in our country. Don’t be afraid of it, sir, it won’t bite. If it was my Carlo now! The Dog is the noblest work of Art, sir. I may safely say the noblest—his mistress’s rights he doth defend—although it may bring him to his end – although to death it doth him send!But the world is sleeping in ignorance and error, sir, and we must be crowing cocks, and singing larks, and a rising sun to awake her; or else we’ll pul society up to the roots, and plant it in a different place. We’ll build Alms-houses, and transcendental State prisons, and scaffolds—we will blow out the sun, and the moon, and encourage invention.Alpha shall kiss Omega—we will ride up the hill of glory—hallelujah, all hail\n\nYours, truly, C.\n\n5. The 1852 Valentine… To George Gould?\n\nThe poem “Sic transit gloria mundi,” was submitted by William Howland, a friend to ED and intern assistant to Lawyer Edward Dickinson, to the Springfield Republican in 1852.\n\nEmily discovered it and had it removed? I am not clear as to why nor of the meaning of ‘removed’ since it was already in print.\n\nSamuel Bowles, was editor of the Springfield Republican then and likely the initiator of including this publication in his paper.\n\nMy Notes in red.\n\n“Sic transit gloria mundi”\n\n“Sic transit gloria mundi,” (Thus, passes the glory of the world: Worldly glory is fleeting)\n\n“How doth the busy bee,”\n\n“Dum vivimus vivamus,” (While we live, let us live!… Gather ye Rosebuds while ye may…Hey Jude… Do it!…)\n\n“Sic transit gloria mundi,” (Thus, passes the glory of the world: Worldly glory is fleeting)\n\n“How doth the busy bee,”\n\n“Dum vivimus vivamus,” (While we live, let us live!… Gather ye Rosebuds while ye may…Hey Jude… Do it!…)\n\nMy notes in red. Please visit http://bloggingdickinson.blogspot.com/2011/06/2-1852.html The Prowling Bee: Blogging all the poems of Emily Dickinson, by Susan Kornfeld for critique and analysis\n\nThis valentine-poem was submitted by William Howland, an Assistant in the Law Office of Edward Dickinson and published in the Springfield Republican with the preceding introduction:\n\n“The hand that wrote the following amusing medley to a gentleman friend of ours, as “a valentine,” is capable of writing very fine things, and there is certainly no presumption in entertaining a private wish that a correspondence, more direct than this, may be established between it and the Republican.”\n\nIt was submitted by Howland but this leaves it clearly possible, and I suggest likely. that it was written by Emily for George Gould! She was 22 years old and from my estimates just when she was engaged to Gould. It was a statement of exuberance and a sign of her excitement and general happiness.\n\nAs I have discussed in my blogs, her father and brother, Austin, were against her wayward, extravagant behavior and against her relationship with Gould. It is very likely that they all exerted pressure on her to stop this very public behavior and had admonished or disciplined her to prevent further public outbursts. Likely approved for publication by Samuel Bowles since he was the Editor and owner of the Springfield Republican. Bowles was married with children and was very unlikely to be the intended. Bowles admired Dickinson’s writing and was always encouraging.\n\n6. The Master Letters are undated are considered to refer to a single, human lover and whom I further suggest is likely to be George Gould.\n\n7. The many poems of Emily Dickinson referring to a single, living, flesh-and-blood lover suggest the existence of such a person.\n\nJoe DiMattio joedimattio@gmail.com\n\nEmily Dickinson was a Lover:\n\nAgain, to be continued"
