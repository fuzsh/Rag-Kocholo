        "text": "My dog Ben is an American Cocker Spaniel. I got Ben when he was 4 months old from an extremely reputable breeder. Upon bringing Ben home from the breeder, I began to notice that he was extremely shy and lacked confidence when it came to being around other dogs and people other than family members. Wanting to ensure he received the best possible obedience training and help in developing socialization skills, I decided to enroll him in puppy school at the Gardner Animal Hospital. The classes were taught by Karen Rich and Claudia Romard.\n\nAfter a few weeks of training, I started to become impatient with what I thought was the lack of progress in Ben’s development. One week, after class, I spoke with Claudia about my concerns. She encouraged me to stay patient, continue attending class. She stressed the importance of completing homework assignments, consistent handling techniques by all family members and continually applying what was being taught in class.\n\nWell, we stuck with it. The results of Claudia’s methods speak for themselves: Ben graduated from Puppy School, Obedience School, AKC Canine Good Citizen, and AKC Community Canine classes. He is currently enrolled in Therapy Dog Certification Training. None of this would have been possible without the training Ben received from Claudia and Karen.\n\nI would and have recommended the dog training services offered by Claudia and Karen to friends and even strangers that Ben and I come across on our daily walks."
