        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Judy Dickinson leads the field Friday for the start of the LPGA's $200,000 Konica San Jose Classic.\n\nDickinson pulled off an exceptional comeback last week at the $200,000 Safeco Classic in Kent, Wash. After shooting par the first two rounds, Dickinson reeled off rounds of 9-under 63 and 5-under 67 to win.\n\n'The way I started out I was ready to slit my wrist,' Dickinson said. 'Then I went into the pro shop on Friday night and found a new putter. It made a big difference. I think I'm going to give it another chance this week.'\n\nThe victory was her second this year and increased her earnings to $182,907.\n\n'The year has gone along a lot better than I thought it would,' Dickinson said. 'I think I played far too much last year. We had two stops in Japan in the late fall and then we had a tournament in Jamaica in December. Finally, the LPGA season started a week earlier so I was just burned out when the year began.'\n\nThe 36-year-old Floridian says she feels she is at the top of her game.\n\n'I've been very consistent the last month,' she said. 'I won in Rochester. Then I finished third at Atlanta and fourth in Springfield. Now I've won in Seattle.'\n\nFellow pro Juli Inkster says there is another reason for Dickinson's play this year.\n\n'She's a hard worker,' Inkster said. 'Marrying Gardner (Dickinson, a PGA Tour veteran) has done her a world of good.'\n\nDickinson is going to have to top a field that includes local favorites Patty Sheehan and Inkster, U.S. Women's Open champ Jane Geddes, Amy Alcott, Pat Bradley, Betsy King and Hollis Stacy.\n\n'You always have to look over your shoulder for Bradley the way she is playing this year,' Dickinson said. 'Patty Sheehan has always done well here because its a hometown crowd and she gets a lot of encouragement.'\n\nThe 3,192-yard, par-72 Almaden Golf and Country Club course is one of the tougher ones on the tour. The back nine has only two par-3 and the rest are long par-4s and par-5s.\n\n'I think the uniqueness of this course is that it has high bunkers in front of all the greens,' Dickinson said. 'It makes the short game very important.'\n\nThe San Jose stop is the last of the year for the LPGA in the United States."
