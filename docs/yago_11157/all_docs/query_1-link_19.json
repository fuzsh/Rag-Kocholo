        "text": "If Larry Gardner had a superpower, it was listening. He could talk with just about anyone, about almost anything. Within minutes, he’d have you recounting a story about your favorite childhood friend. Or you’d find yourself confessing your “never said this out loud” career goal. Or detailing every moment of your last trip. Through it all, he’d listen with an intensity that conveyed how much he cared—because he did. On September 14, 2022, we lost this great listener. So, please take a few moments to learn a little more about him.\n\nLarry was born in 1953, to Elizabeth “Betty” and Leo Gardner. He spent his early years with his six siblings in New England, North Dakota, along the banks of the Cannonball River. His childhood home was filled with music, and his siblings remember him as a curious playmate who was always game to build snow tunnels, who ate massive bowls of ice cream (that never changed), and who loved to shoot hoops (he was immensely proud to play on his high school basketball team, which won the state Class B championship in 1970).\n\nIn high school, this “gentle giant” (he’d grow to be 6’ 2”) met the love of his life: Marty Odermann. Their relationship is an example of how friendship, hard work, love, love, and more love can create a life that simply can’t be described in words. The two were married in 1973, and from the wide smile on his face in the photos, it’s obvious he thought he was the luckiest person on the planet. (He still had th at smile on his face nearly five decades later.)\n\nLarry attended the University of North Dakota and played football with a group of people that he respected and admired (they won three NCC Championships during his time there). He joined the Army and lived in El Paso, Texas, and Homestead, Florida, with Marty. He helped out on the family farm. He spent many years working in road construction and consulting, and he kept asking questions.\n\nAlong the way, Marty and Larry welcomed four children into their family: Megan, Katrina, Natasha, and Burke. He was incredibly proud of each of them and had a unique way of making sure they knew how special they were. He also taught them to be fearless and to love.\n\nHis grandchildren knew him as “Popeye,” a moniker that brought a smile to anyone who heard Oliver, McKinley, Liam, Fionn, and Onóra yell it in delight upon spotting his tall frame. This was always followed by an incredible bear hug. He was a teller of stories and singer of songs. There was no end to the number of times he could belly flop into a pool or be dunked under water if it would make a grandkid laugh. He always had a stash of Twizzlers to hand out.\n\nAnd while Larry was a warrior on the field and on the court, as a colon cancer survivor and through several heart procedures, he was a warrior again and again throughout his life. He fought exceptionally hard to spend as much time as he could muster with his family.\n\nLarry was also a tremendous mentor and motivator and could convince you to run just a little farther, work just a little harder, and strive to be just a little better. At restaurants, he was notorious for ordering the “chef’s choice” and gladly gobbling up whatever unexpected concoction was brought to the table. He was constantly learning; he read paperback Westerns, and he collected National Geographics. He was very proud of his Irish heritage and his home state of North Dakota.\n\nBut it was Marty who brought him the most joy. In recent years, the two called Colorado home and spent much time traveling the country in their RV, seemingly trying to see every historic spot they could along the way. And they’d bring back stories about their travels that Marty, a talented artist, would use as inspiration to stitch or paint artwork for their home. They embraced life head-on—always hand in hand.\n\nWe all will miss this wonderful man.\n\nWe are celebrating Larry’s life in various ways, including an interment of his ashes in St. Mary’s Catholic Cemetery in New England, North Dakota on October 16, 2022, at 1 p.m., followed by a storytelling session in his memory at Memorial Hall (925 Main St., New England). Coffee and doughnuts will be served. In lieu of flowers, please share your stories of Larry with his family at odermanngardnerfamily@gmail.com. We have also set up a Meal Train to support Marty; you can find more information at mealtrain.com/g9z8nm."
