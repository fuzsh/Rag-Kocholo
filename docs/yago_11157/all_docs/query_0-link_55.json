Notes: Almira wrote about nature, and her textbook, Familiar Lectures on Botany, was first published in 1829. Almira…\n\nRead More\n\nby Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps How often are the beauties of nature unheeded by man, who, musing on past ills, brooding over the possible calamities of the future, building castles in the air, or wrapped up in his own self-love and self-importance, forgets to look abroad, or looks with a vacant stare. Note:…\n\nRead More\n\nLet’s start today off by talking briefly about bolting cilantro. Why does cilantro bolt, and how should you address it? You can help delay when cilantro bolts by planting it in part shade instead of full sun and keeping the plant cool and moist. Heat is a stressor and sensing its own mortality; cilantro will…\n\nRead More\n\nHere’s a little primer on mulch placement. Keep mulch away from the bases of plants and trees. Trees can be harmed or killed by mulching too heavily around the trunk. Perennials and other plants can be smothered or damaged by heavy mulch around the crown as well.

You really don’t need to – I don’t. Here’s what I do: I remove about a quarter to a third of the soil in my containers, and I put it in my potting soil bin. Then, I add a little perlite and…\n\nRead More\n\nAre you planning to grow Sunflowers this year? Five years ago, Hans-Peter Schiffer toppled the Guinness World Record for the third year in a row – growing a sunflower that was 30’1″ tall! Over at the Facebook group for the show, you can check out a time-lapse video of sunflowers growing from seed to seed…\n\nRead More\n\nPlant height is one of the factors often indicated on plant tags.
