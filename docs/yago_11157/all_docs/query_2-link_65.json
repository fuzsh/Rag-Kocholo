        "text": "A GENEALOGICAL MISCELLANY III,\n\nMADISON COUNTY, TENNESSEE\n\nBy Jonathan K. T. Smith\n\nCopyright, Jonathan K. T. Smith, 1996\n\n(Page 16)\n\nMARRIAGE ANNOUNCEMENTS,\n\nJACKSON GAZETTE,\n\nFOR THE 1824-1830 PERIOD\n\nThese data were taken by the present writer from the microfilm copies of the JACKSON GAZETTE, Madison County's second oldest newspaper. A relatively few of the original marriage bonds/licenses of Madison County for the earlier years of settlement survived until the 1930s at which time a project of the federal agency, through the local W.P.A. provided for the compilation of these records. The original marriage records have since disappeared. (In some of the other area counties such early marriage records have been destroyed, hence the enhanced value of marriage announcements published in contemporary newspapers.) These marriage lists were published in the FAMILY FINDINGS, Mid-West Tennessee Genealogical Society's publication, volume one, number 2, April 1969, pages 9-12; ibid., number three, October 1969, pages 39-57. For those marriages announced in the JACKSON GAZETTE and solemnized in Madison County, if a marriage record survived to be copied into the W.P.A. compilation, an asterisk is placed after the announcement entry in this publication. Other information is also given parenthetically. The data from Nashville newspapers are from the NATIONAL BANNER and NASHVILLE WHIG which merged to form the NATIONAL BANNER AND NASHVILLE WHIG. Even so, afterwards the newspaper's name varied somewhat but it was one newspaper. This listing is a slight revision of one previously prepared by the present writer.\n\nJune 19, 1824\n\nCLARISSA daughter of William POLK, Esq. married ANDREW TAYLOR, Esq., June 10; all of Hardeman Co., Tenn.\n\nJune 26, 1824\n\nJANE daughter of Capt.
