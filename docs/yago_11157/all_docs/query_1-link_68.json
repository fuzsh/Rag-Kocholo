        "text": "Wynantskill UFSD is thrilled to welcome Ms. Shannon Toomey as its new principal! Please see a letter to GD families below from Ms. Toomey:\n\nHello Gardner-Dickinson Families,\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself as I assume the role of Principal at Gardner-Dickinson School starting July 1st. I have met many of the students and some of the families over the past few weeks while visiting school, attending the PTA and BOE meetings and during the recent meet and greet. I am already feeling the strength and kindness of this community, both in the warm welcomes I have already received, but more importantly, in the conversations with the amazing children who come to GD every day.\n\nI am thrilled to be joining the team at Gardner-Dickinson School. I am coming from 21+ years as a special education teacher and literacy specialist at Boght Hills School in North Colonie CSD. I have a strong background in behavioral supports and working collaboratively with staff and families.\n\nPersonally, I have two boys, Keene (age 14) and Kade (age 12). My spouse, Becky, is a school counselor and as a family we enjoy many outdoor adventures, including hiking, boating and fishing. During the summer and into the fall, I will work hard to learn as much as I can about all things GD. I hope to be able to meet all the students and families and gain insight into the things that make Wynantskill UFSD great as well as any things you feel could use improvement. I would like to learn what you feel my priorities and focus should include.\n\nI hope to honor all the hard work and traditions already in place at Gardner-Dickinson while also bringing a fresh perspective. I am most interested in establishing strong communication and collaboration among all the stakeholders in the district. One of the most vital aspects of our important work as educators is ensuring that all students feel safe coming to school each day. We will do this by creating a warm and welcoming environment for your child or children, while working together closely and collaboratively.\n\nI will be working set days throughout the summer and plan to attend the PTA meeting on 7/20 and hold a meet and greet beforehand at 5pm. I hope the last few weeks of the school year go smoothly, and that everyone enjoys a fun-filled and rejuvenating summer break!\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to introduce yourself, set up a meeting, or with any questions or concerns. I look forward to working closely with all of you to continue to make Gardner-Dickinson an exceptional school community."
