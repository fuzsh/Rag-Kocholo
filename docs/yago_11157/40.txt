SRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Judy Dickinson, playing her first

tournament in a month, shot a 6-under 66 Saturday to lead

the LPGA Rail Charity Classic.

Dickinson's round of six birdies and no bogeys left her

one stroke in front of defending champion Beth Daniel.

Daniel, the LPGA's leading money-winner with $613,782, has

won three of her last four tournaments and five overall

this year.

Three-time Rail champion Betsy King, Kathryn Young, and

Sherri Turner were tied at 68.

After opening with two pars, Dickinson birdied the par-5

third hole at The Rail Golf Club. She added birdies on the

fourth, eighth, 11th, 13th and 14th holes for identical

33s on the front and back nines.

Dickinson, married to PGA Senior Tour player Gardner Dickinson,

rolled in a 90-foot putt to go to 4-under.

After consecutive birdies on the 13th and 14th, Dickinson

parred out for her leading round.

Dickinson's last tournament was The Boston Five Classic

Aug. 2-5, where she finished in a tie for 38th.

Dickinson, president of the LPGA Players Association, has

been a Tour member since 1978, and has not won since the

Safeco Classic in 1986.

Turner's round featured a hole-in-one on the second hole.

The holiday weekend tournament continues with second-round

play Sunday and the final round on Monday.
