WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - The Miss USA beauty pageant got under

way Tuesday evening as 51 contestants flashing bright smiles

and sporting mid-winter tans competed in swimsuits and evening

gowns.

About 3,000 people gathered at Century II's Convention Hall

for the competition by contestants from all 50 states and

the District of Columbia.

Each category contributes a third of the score that will

determine the 12 finalists, who will be announced Friday

in a national telecast of the pageant on CBS. The other

third will come from personal interviews with an 11-judge

panel.

In Tuesday night's opening, the contestants - all wearing

short, black cocktail dresses - sang about being "right

in the middle" of the United States as they danced and

strutted in front of a U.S. map with Wichita marked with

a neon star.

Contestants said hello to the audience with brief statements,

many of them on their aspirations. Two contestants said

they wanted to someday win the Academy Award for best actress;

nearly a dozen said they are planning careers as broadcast

journalists or television personalities. One contestant

who survived an automobile crash endorsed seat belts.

In the swimsuit competition, contestants wore identical

pink, one-piece suits. They posed in front of a neon rainbow

with puffy clouds projected behind it as the Top 40 song

"Blame It on The Rain" played.

Two preliminary awards were announced.

Photographers covering the pageant picked Miss Mississippi-USA

Stephanie TenEyck as 1990's most photogenic delegate. She

is a 20-year-old University of Mississippi student from

Laurel, Miss.

Miss Minnesota-USA, Janet Tveita, was selected by a vote

of all the contestants as the nicest, most enthusiastic

and friendliest of the 51 women.
