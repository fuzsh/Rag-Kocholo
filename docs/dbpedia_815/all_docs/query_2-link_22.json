        "text": "HOW ISRAELIS EXPERIENCE ROCKET BOMBARDMENT: PART 1: ATTACKS\n\nDamage at Siderot (AP/Ariel Schalit)\n\nI interviewed a recently emigrated American whom I knew and who now arranges for local residents to show visitors launching sites on the grounds of former Jewish communities in Gaza, more or less adjacent to Israel. That is how close the danger is! He provided first-hand reports in more depth than the New York newspapers had, for what is a continuing situation.\n\nA couple of farmers were killed by snipers in Gaza, alongside their farms. [That is what happens with side-by-side living. I never heard of Israelis firing rifles into Gaza at non-terrorists just going about their business. Anti-Zionists who constantly condemn Israel as picking on the Arabs miss Arab aggression.]\n\nAll the rocket news focused on Sderot, near Gaza, until Ashkelon, a bigger city, came within range of the technically improved rockets. [I was on my way to visit people in Ashkelon when the rockets first began striking there.] Actually, thousands of rockets also struck other towns and kibbutzim. Kibbutz Near'am received 750 mortars and Kassam rockets, not gift-wrapped.\n\nWhen the IDF does report bombardment, it often states that they fell on an \"open field.\" That may be a military deception. The IDF won't serve as an enemy artillery spotter who informs the gun crews where the shells land so they can adjust their aim. The \"open field\" may be between a house and a kindergarten, where a rocket struck without injuring anyone.\n\nBut there were people in the house and kindergarten. They were shaken psychologically by the blasts. Many Israeli children are taking tranquilizers. So are some pets.\n\nPeople worry that they will not hear the alarm. Some are afraid to take a shower, lest that be when the attack comes. People in the more dangerous zone drive with seat belts unbuckled and car windows open, so they will be surer to hear the alarm. Parents have to strategize which child to take out of the car, first.\n\nWhen the rocket alarm sounds, Israelis have only 15 seconds to find shelter. Hurry or die! Mothers grab their young children. Usually, they make sure to know where they are. However, one time, a mother couldn't find hers! Her 15 seconds were up. Frantic, she ran into the center of the house, and there was her child!\n\nIn the shelter, children count off the seconds. More cautious mothers do not let them out immediately after the first explosion, lest there be a second one\n\nA mother in Kibbutz Nir Am, which lies between Gaza and Sderot, could not locate her young child when the alert went off, signaling the launching of a Kassam rocket by Palestinian Arab terrorists. A few seconds later she heard a thump, and when she raced to her backyard she found her son there, mere meters from an unexploded Kassam. The Kassam had failed to detonate, because it had landed where earlier downpours turned the ground into mud that absorbed the landing.\n\nSince this near-tragedy occurred on the second day of Chanukah, the boy's mother called it her family's personal miracle of Chanukah.\n\nHOW ISRAELIS EXPERIENCE ROCKET BOMBARDMENT: PART 2: WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.\n\nA leftist kibbutz had favored the expulsion of all the Jews from Gaza. The leftists did not realize that they would be attacked, once the IDF was no longer patrolling Gaza. They had thought that the IDF was just guarding Jewish communities in Gaza. They did not understand that the Jewish communities in the Territories served as a breakwater absorbing the storm from jihad. It is a human tendency to rely upon one's present safety, and to close one's eyes to the approaching menace.\n\n[Same thing happened throughout history. In ancient Greece, a few people tried to warn of the approaching danger from Phillip of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great. People paid no attention. The Macedonians picked off city after city, until Athens was alone.]\n\nUnder bombardment, many leftists finally are realizing that their policies of appeasement failed [as is usual with determined or fanatical enemies.]\n\nMost rocket and mortar firing is ignored by the major media, but an Israeli incursion undergoes intense journalistic scrutiny. Hence, most foreigners get no sense of the constant attacks Israelis experience and of the justification for their attempts to silence the attackers.\n\nUnder both military assault and assault by foreign diplomatic, media, and academia, Israelis feel isolated. They welcome expression of concern for them.\n\nMy source finds that Israelis there do not feel like victims. They endure. But the bombardment does take a toll. This explains the Gaza war, which anti-Zionists profess not to understand.\n\nMembers of Knesset, some of whom live in bombarded towns, often do not respond to local issues such as the rocket rain. Americans assume that Israelis in targeted towns simply need approach their Members of Knesset. But they do not have Members of Knesset. Israel is not divided into constituencies, as is the U.S..\n\nIsraelis elect parties, which pick the Members of Knesset. Parties may have other interests. It therefore is difficult to hold Israeli politicians accountable. Parties there, at least since the time of PM Rabin, do not keep campaign promises to an extent that would surprise Americans. Lacking representative government, Israelis find it difficult to marshal legislative support and its public relations strength.\n\nThe Palestinian Arabs are far more talented than Israelis on public relations. They pose old people in front of rubble, to elicit sympathy (Jeff Daube, representative of Zionist Organization of America in Israel, 12/10). To see a 6-minute video of the rocket situation, enter WWW.UTube.com and search on \"Sderot ordeal.\"\n\nThe major media are more likely to pick up stories about that, than about Israelis. Israelis' houses get blown up, but usually the residents were not in the way at the time. I recall the complaint by one old Arab woman of being tired of her job, which was to sit in front of a destroyed house as if it were hers, but which had not been occupied; it was photogenic. The camera may not lie, but the Palestinian Arab photographer often makes false propaganda for jihad. I have reported that they often stage phony Israeli attacks, including the one on the Al-Dura boy, which attack was widely publicized by credulous media, gravely impaired Israel's reputation, and eventually was proved a fraud.\n\nPALESTINIAN ARAB KIDS TAUGHT HATRED AND MARTYRDOM\n\nToday, Al-Quds TV station in Lebanon broadcast the message that Zionist gangs raided Palestinian Arab villages, to shoot children and the elderly. Based on that, all Palestinian Arabs are gun-wise and war-ready. The greatest joy for a child is to die a martyr, killing Jews. The narrative specifies \"Jew\" (www.imra.org.il, 2/27 from www.memri.org).\n\nBy self-description, practically the whole Palestinian Arab population wants war. Contrast that with U.S. efforts to call the non-Hamas Palestinian Authority leaders moderate and the people as a whole wanting peace.\n\nWhen whole generations are brought up on a series of such war propaganda programs, how can peace be possible until generations have passed?\n\nArab rulers, who disseminate such propaganda, should be suspected of aggression, not Israeli rulers, whose curriculum stresses peace.\n\nOne hears the claim that anti-Zionism is not anti-Jewish. That broadcast and religious quotations from the Palestinian Authority disprove the claim. The propaganda does not differentiate Israeli Zionists from other Zionists and from other Jews, nor soldiers from civilians. Hence the Arab-Israel conflict is a religious jihad, and not a mere territorial conflict.\n\nArmed Israelis do not single out children and the elderly to shoot but to spare. Thus the P.A. case is based on blood libel. P.A. children are being raised on false grounds of hatred. And, hypocritically, they are taught to kill all Jews regardless of age, the very same condition they complain about when they pretend it happened to them.\n\nAnother false contention is that Zionism intended to dispossess Arabs. It asked them to stay in independent Israel, but the Arabs made war and then fled. Now the Arabs blame Israel for loss of their villages that Israel urged them to stay in. Since they started the war, their loss is their own fault.\n\nA Muslim writer recently commented about my piece on Libya that Ghadafi is crazy and misrepresents Islam with his call for jihad on Switzerland. Does the same misrepresentation of Islam apply to Palestinian Arab leaders who urge children to kill all Jews? If so, let moderate Muslims correct the extremism in people who mistakenly claim to speak for their faith. That is the eventual path to peace.\n\nEU POLICY AND DUBAI ASSASSINATION\n\nEuropean foreign policy does not reflect the national interests of the EU.\n\n\"Take the EU's initial response to the killing of Hamas terror-master Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai on January 19. A senior terrorist engaging in the illegal purchase of illicit arms from Iran for Hamas-controlled Gaza is killed in his hotel room. The same Dubai authorities who had no problem with hosting a wanted international terrorist worked themselves into a frenzy condemning his killing. And of course, despite the fact that any number of governments, (Egypt and Jordan come to mind), and rival terrorist organizations, (Fatah, anyone?) had ample reason to wish to see Mabhouh dead, Dubai's police chief Lt.-Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim blamed Israel.\n\n\"Not only did he blame Israel, to substantiate his claims, Tamim released what he said was video footage of alleged Mossad operatives who entered Dubai with European and Australian passports.\"\n\n\"Relying only on Tamim's allegations, EU leaders went into high dudgeon. Ignoring the nature of the operation, the basic lack of credibility of the source of information, and the interests of Europe in defeating jihadist terrorism in the Middle East and worldwide, the chanceries of Europe squawked indignantly...\" British Foreign Office sources told the Daily Telegraph, \"If the Israelis were responsible for the assassination in Dubai, they are seriously jeopardizing the important intelligence-sharing arrangement that currently exists between Britain and Israel.\"\n\n\"It reportedly took the intervention of the highest echelons of Europe's intelligence agencies to get their hysterical politicians and diplomats to stop blaming and threatening Israel. After being dressed down, on Monday, the chastened EU foreign ministers abstained from mentioning Israel by name in their joint condemnation of the alleged use of European passports by the alleged operatives who allegedly killed the terrorist Mabhouh.\"\n\n\"And lucky they held their tongues. Because on Tuesday, Tamim claimed that after the hit, at least two of the alleged members of the alleged assassination team departed Dubai for Iran. It's hard to imagine Mossad officers feeling safer in Iran than in Dubai at any time and certainly it is hard to see why they would flee to Iran after killing an Iranian-sponsored terrorist.\"\n\n\"What the initial European reaction to Tamim's allegations shows is that blaming Israel has become Europe's default foreign policy. It apparently never occurred to the Europeans that Israel might not be responsible for the hit. And it certainly never occurred to them that cutting off intelligence ties with Israel will harm them more than Israel.\"\n\n\"They didn't think of the latter, of course, because Europe has no idea of what its interests are. All it knows is how to sound off authoritatively.\" Even if individual countries wanted to act in their own interests, the new EU treaty subordinates national foreign policy \"to the whims of bureaucrats in\n\nBrussels. \"As for its rhetoric, as the EU's rush to threaten Israel for allegedly killing a terrorist shows, it is cowardly, ineffectual and self-defeating.\"\n\n\"Obviously Europe should favor Israel over a Hamas terrorist. But in its current state of strategic imbecility, no European leader can acknowledge this basic fact. Consequently, Europe may well be doomed.\" (Caroline Glick in www.imra.org.il, 2/27).\n\nMY COMMENT: When an ideology is blind everything else, those who hold that ideology blind themselves. They lack introspection. No longer think for themselves. Ruin the lives of millions and perhaps billions.\n\nIn this and the next article on what Dubai illustrates, Caroline Glick demonstrates that governments often do not act in self-interest, but in their enemies' interest. The shibboleth that governments always act in their own interest misleads people to suppose that the governments of the U.S. deals with Israel out of self-interest when it makes demands of Israel. The same myth leads Members of Congress who sympathize with Israel not to oppose Israeli policies that they think harmful to Israel and therefore to international defense against jihad; they cannot imagine that Israel regimes pursue anti-Zionist policies.\n\nISRAELI POLICY AND DUBAI ASSASSINATION\n\n\"If the Mossad did in fact kill Mabhouh, then the operation was an instance in which Israel distinguished itself from its European detractors by acting, rather than preening.\"\n\nUnfortunately, such instances are increasingly the exception rather than the rule. Over the past 16 years or so, Israel largely descended into the European statecraft abyss. Rather than use rhetoric to explain policies adopted to advance its national interests, successive Israeli governments have adopted policies geared toward strengthening their rhetoric that itself stands in opposition to Israel's national interests.\"\n\nFor example, \"Israel's national interest is to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Today, the only way to secure this interest is to use force to destroy Iran's nuclear installations.\"\n\n\"Given Iran's leaders' absolute commitment to developing nuclear weapons, no sanctions  regardless of how \"crippling\" they are supposed to be  will convince them to curtail their efforts to build and deploy their nuclear arsenal.\"\n\n\"Beyond that, and far less important, the Russians and the Chinese will refuse to implement 'crippling sanctions,' against Iran.\"\n\n\"IN LIGHT of these facts, it is distressing that Israel's leaders have made building an international coalition in support of 'crippling' sanctions against Iran their chief aim. And this is not merely a rhetorical flourish. Over the past several weeks and months, Israel's top leaders have devoted themselves to lobbying foreign governments to support sanctions against Iran.\"\n\n\"Last week PM Binyamin Netanyahu went to Moscow to gin up support for sanctions from the Russian government. This week, Defense Minister Ehud Barak traveled to the UN and the State Department and Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon flew off to Beijing just to lobby senior officials to support sanctions.\"\n\n\"It isn't simply that this behavior doesn't contribute anything to Israel's ability to destroy Iran's nuclear installations. It harms Israel's ability to do so, if only by diverting our leaders' focus from where it should be: preparing the IDF to strike and preparing the country to withstand whatever the aftereffects of such a strike would be. Moreover, by calling for sanctions, Israel contributes to the delusion that sanctions are sufficient to block Iran's race to the nuclear finish line.\"\n\n\"As for the Palestinian issue, it is fairly clear that at a minimum, Israel's interest is to secure its control over the areas of Judea and Samaria that it requires to protect its Jewish heritage and its national security. But it is hard to think of anything the government has done in its year in office to advance that basic interest.\"\n\n\"It is argued that Israel's interest in maintaining good relations with the US administration trumps its interest in strengthening its control over areas in Judea and Samaria that it deems vital. The problem with this argument is that it takes for granted that Israel can determine the status of its relations with the US administration. In the case of the Obama administration, it is abundantly clear that this is not the case.\"\n\n\"President Barack Obama and his senior advisers have demonstrated repeatedly that they are interested in weakening  not strengthening  the US alliance with Israel. This week the administration condemned Israel for defining the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem as national heritage sites. The fact that they are national heritage sites is so obvious that even President Shimon Peres defended the move.\" [Peres was one of the first Israeli leaders to act contrary to Israel's interest.]\n\n\"Moreover, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, reiterated for the millionth time this week that he opposes military strikes against Iran's nuclear installations. That is, for the millionth time, the top US military officer effectively said that he prefers a nuclear armed Iran to an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear installations.\"\n\n\"In the interest of strengthening Israel's ties with a hostile administration, the Netanyahu government has adopted rhetoric on the Palestinian issue that is harmful to Israel's national interests. It declared its support for a Palestinian state, despite the fact that such a state will define itself through its devotion to Israel's destruction.\"\n\n\"It has outlawed Jewish construction in Judea and Samaria, despite the fact that the move simply legitimizes the Palestinians' bigoted demand that Jews be barred from living in Judea and Samaria.\"\n\n\"And it has advocated on behalf of Palestinian leaders like Mahmoud Abbas and Salam Fayyad who refuse to accept Israel's right to exist.\"\n\n\"Indeed, if Israel were to reject the current European model and craft a foreign policy that advanced its national interests, one of its first acts would be to point out that the unelected Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad is not a man of peace.\"\n\n\"Just this week, Fayyad threatened to respond with a religious war to Israel's classification of the Cave of the Patriarchs and Rachel's Tomb as national heritage sites. Last Friday he joined rioters at Bil'in to attack Israel's security fence. Fayyad has taken a lead role in the campaign to implement an international boycott of Israeli products. Over the past couple of years he has sought to take control over the PA's security forces not to fight terror, but to prevent Israel from fighting terror. Finally, since the Hamas victory in the PA legislative elections in 2006, he has overseen the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas.\"\n\n\"In short, Fayyad, a former World Bank employee, is not a 'moderate,' as his supporters in the US and Europe claim. He is a fiscally sound terror financier and sponsor, actively waging war against Israel.\" [That makes him all the more dangerous to the free world.]\n\n\"As for the Palestinians, the situation will not be remedied simply by firing a few incompetent office holders. For 16 years, in the interest of enhancing the country's ties with Europe, and to a lesser degree with the US, successive Israeli governments have ignored Israel's vital national interest in maintaining its control over Judea and Samaria. Indeed, they have preferred Euro-friendly, and Israel-unfriendly rhetoric to the sober-minded pursuit of Israel's national interest.\"\n\n\"To avoid Europe's encroaching fate [at the hands of Radical Islam], Israel must abandon its current course. The purpose of rhetoric is to support policies adopted in the pursuit of a nation's interests. And Israel has interests in need of urgent advancement\n\nMY COMMENT: If Israel did assassinate the Hamas terrorist leader, it should get a medal. The question should not be why Israel did it, but why didn't others try to do it?\n\nContinued devotion to the failed sanctions campaign against Iran may be a way of pretending to do something rather than having to do something with unforeseen and unpleasant consequences. In a world of difficult choices, many politicians do not choose. But not choosing alternatives is choosing the present, disastrous course.\n\nU.S. foreign policy makers blundered in not attempting Iran regime change, when there still was time to work on it. They thought that was bad. Now what do they think?\n\nIn the case of President Obama, who pulls his punches even with sanctions, the sanctions campaign was a way of diverting attention from military action. That inexperienced radical's deceptive ways and his conceit about his own knowledge and capabilities, narrow our choices on critical issues. What that president and his predecessor did to us was dither away alternatives until we are left with military attack by us, which Obama rejects, and nuclear attack by Iran, against an anti-missile defense that Obama rejects.\n\nCompounding our quandary is the lack of scrutiny by media and academia. They are too poor, dependent upon government, or ideologically rigid, themselves. They do not explore the issues sufficiently. They do not enlighten the public.\n\nThe same dissenters who correctly warned of one disaster after another, such as the disasters of Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Lebanon and reliance upon the UN, are ignored when they warn again. Our policy makers haven't the character or intelligence to realize that people who foresaw outcomes before might have insight again.\n\nISRAEL'S HAMAS AGENT\n\nMosab Hassan Yousef, son of a Hamas leader, has just come out with an autobiography of his many escapades as an agent for Israel's secret service. It must be an exciting and revealing book.\n\nMr. Yousef says he was mistreated when the Israelis captured him. After a while, he realized that the captors respected his religious rights, did not again mistreat him, and the Hamas representatives tortured their own people in prison. He began to see who and what really was evil. He decided he must do what he can to stop terrorism, but spared a number of terrorists by arranging for their capture rather than their assassination. Some of them do not realize they owe their lives to him. But he advises Israel not to release terrorists still in captivity, in exchange for one Israeli. Too many innocent lives would perish.\n\nYousef became Israel's most valuable agent in Hamas, not just by having inside information, but by ingenuity and instinct. It was he who discovered a secret echelon really running Hamas. He also turned Christian. When the risk of being discovered by Hamas became too great, he was pulled out and went to the U.S. and a new life (Haaretz in www.imra.org.il, 2/27).\n\nThere is a greatness to that person. All the more regretful that Israelis started by mistreating him.\n\nRichard Shulman is a veteran defender of Israel on several web-based forums.

Jews had lived in Jaffa for thousands of years. [Persecuted by Arabs before statehood, Jaffa Jews founded Tel Aviv.]\n\nThe high bidder was a group of Jews who wanted to build an apartment house for themselves there.\n\nThe losing bid was by Arabs. Some Israeli Arabs and politically motivated NGOs sued over it. They contended that the Arabs are losing a majority in Jaffa [which no longer is a separate city], that Arabs have a housing shortage in Jaffa, and that the purchase somehow discriminates against Arabs and therefore Jews should not be allowed to buy more land there unless they allot apartments to Arabs.\n\nThe judge rejected the petition as in bad faith, merely being self-serving in the name of equality.\n\nCounsel for defense said that the Arab premise is that all of Israel belongs to the Arabs and that Jewish building anywhere is a settlement to be barred. The defense had argued that the Jews won the bid fairly, that they have human rights to buy public land offer and to enjoy land they own [i.e., not have to turn around and offer it to someone else], and the right to live wherever they want to in their own country.\n\nHaving lost in court, Arab activists turned to mass protest and threats of violence. Indeed, the construction site was vandalized.\n\n\"In recent weeks the world Jewish community has been told that Jews are forbidden to live in parts of Jerusalem and the territories. Now Jews are being informed by Arab-Israelis and so called human rights groups that they are also prohibited from live in Jaffa, a suburb of Tel-Aviv that has had a Jewish presence for thousands of years, as well. The battle over Jewish rights inside the State of Israel is truly heating up.\" (www.imra.org.il, 2/25.)\n\nAs I have put it, the Arabs are trying to turn the clock back and renew their fight to take over the country. Their loyalty is questionable. Their immediate goal is ethnic separation or apartheid, with special privileges for themselves. I sense that the courts no longer are ruling almost automatically in behalf of the Arabs, because the Arabs are going too far.\n\nWhen I visited Jaffa on a couple of early trips to Israel, the majority was Jewish. Following the principle of the Arabs' case, should Israel have barred further Arab property acquisition in Jaffa, lest it change the demographic balance? What about Holon and other cities whose balance changed in favor of the Arabs? Should there be neighborhood-by-neighborhood ethnic restrictions, a la apartheid?\n\nWHAT DO IRAN'S THREATS AGAINST ISRAEL MEAN?\n\nIran Missile (AP/Amir Hosseini)\n\nIn the past two weeks, Iran's President Ahmadinejad repeatedly has threatened to destroy Israel. What does he mean?\n\nOn February 25, he said that the eradication of Israel is a \"divine promise.\" He said that Iran would stand with Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian Arab organizations if they were attacked by Israel. He accused Israel of wanting war. Together they would end the Zionist state.\n\nAhmadinejad asserted that Israel makes its moves from a position of weakness (www.imra.org.il, 2/25).\n\nReferring to \"divine promise,\" Ahmadinejad is confirming that to Muslims, this is holy war, not a territorial dispute. The West does not pay heed. It prefers to perceive the conflict as a territorial dispute, rather than as part of a global effort to conquer the world. By perceiving the conflict as territorial, the West, which is more or less hostile to Israel based on obsolete conflicts, can chip away at the territorial integrity of Israel as if solving a problem and appeasing the Muslims. This policy weakens the Israeli bastion of Western civilization.\n\nNo matter what threats emanate from the Mideast, and no matter how much those threats are acted upon, Westerners do not take them seriously, especially when directed against Israel. What Ahmadinejad intends is to destroy Jewish sovereignty and the Jewish people. The UN Charter prohibits one member from trying to destroy another. But who pays attention to the UN when doing so might benefit Israel? All is posturing, all is pretense of ethics.\n\nAhmadinejad covers himself technically by conditioning his threat upon Israel attacking Iran or an ally of it. Self-defense is the false cry of aggressive dictators. Dictators commit aggression in the name of self-defense. But the Muslim notion of self-defense is offense against Israel on the grounds that Israel's very existence as a non-Muslim state on land Islam once had conquered is an act of aggression.\n\nAhmadinejad can manufacture incidents by his proxies and then declare the war he, not Israel, obviously wants.\n\nIn effect, Iran has declared war on Israel. In actuality, Iran has been making war on Israel by proxy and on Iraq by proxy and by some of its own troops. Having threatened to destroy Israel, Israel may not let Iran proceed to develop nuclear weapons with which to do so. Ahmadinejad would call that the aggression that releases any restraint upon Syrian and Hizbullah missiles.\n\nIsrael does not start wars. It either defends itself from aggression or pursues terrorism. It sometimes suffers terrorist abuse for years before reacting. Its whole outlook is for peace whereas the Muslim outlook there is for conquest and domination, actually relishing violence. Arafat was offered a lot, by Israeli negotiators, but preferred Intifada. Arafat's and Abbas' schools teach bigotry and violence, whereas Israeli schools teach tolerance and peace.\n\nHaving spared Hizbullah, Hamas, and Fatah, and having tried to be nice to the Arabs only gets Israel a reputation for weakness among Mideastern aggressors. It is the wrong way to deal with them. It also is the wrong way to appear to the West, which also loses respect for Israel and gives Israel no credit for decency. This is the way of the world.\n\nARE ANTI-ZIONISTS ANTISEMITIC?\n\nHere is a long, satirical essay by Prof. Steven Plaut (2/26, verbatim) on anti-Zionists who deny they are antisemitic. I have a few qualifications to offer. When I was a boy, some fellow Jews were not Zionists or were anti-Zionists. (1) Still existing are ultra-Orthodox Jews who believe that the secular Zionism of the State of Israel is not adequate. I think they have a good point. (2) Some Socialists believed that Jews should help bring about socialism and integrate into their non-Israeli societies. They were unaware of the depth of antisemitism. Their dream failed both as to socialism and to integration. They did not deny the Jewish people's right to re-constitute their state, but thought it unnecessary. Therefore, most of them were not antisemitic about it, but Karl Marx was, the Communists were, and the Far Left still is. Once Israel formed, the bulk of the Socialists upheld its rights. (3) Reform Jews opposed a Jewish state out of fear that their loyalty to their Diaspora countries would be questioned. By distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage, which they toned down, they demonstrated a form of antisemitism. Most of them now accept Israel, but the lingering Reform anti-Zionism that pervaded the New York Times has solidified in it even under its present ownership by converted descendants of Jews.\n\nSay What? Anti-Semites? Who, us anti-Zionists? US? We have nothing against Jews as such. We just hate Zionism and Zionists. We think Israel does not have a right to exist.

He has offered 120 Arab families a switch to the new apartments. They prefer to keep their houses.\n\nThey call the sub-neighborhood al-Bustan; he calls it Gan HaMelech or Kings Garden, because it looks out upon the place where King David was thought to have been.\n\nMayor Birkat thinks his plan would benefit the Arabs. They call him a liar.\n\nThey say they lived there for decades, and own the land. A Palestinian Authority (P.A.) official accuses him of ethnic cleansing. He calls them liars. He said that all their houses were built within the past 20 years, and without permits. (About 20,000 illegally built houses are in Jerusalem.) Those houses' illegality and location is why he chose this area for urban renewal.\n\nThe Arab residents \"and the rest of the world  do not recognize Israel's sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\" They say, \"For us, the occupiers cannot tell us what is legal and illegal.\"\n\nAs background, the New York Times explains that the area historically was a greenbelt. In the 1990s, people started erecting those houses, without the municipality paying heed. In mentioning other parts of Silwan, the newspaper refers to Jewish residents as \"settlers.\"\n\nThe world professes concern about expelling Arabs and replacing them with Jews. Barkat says that Jews are leaving Jerusalem for areas of higher income opportunities and Arabs are leaving the Palestinian Authority and entering Jerusalem for higher income. [Jerusalem pays welfare benefits.]\n\nTaking a business-like approach to solving municipal problems, Barkat denies any hidden political agenda. The Arabs say they fear being squeezed from both directions. One resident accuses the Mayor of wanting to isolate the al-Aksa Mosque to build a Jewish temple (Ethan Bronner, 2/26, A1).\n\nThe New York Times reports people's arguments and sometimes counter-arguments, but rarely identifies facts. It also uses slanted terminology. Let's make some sense of this article.\n\nHaving studied city planning, I can see the sincerity of the Mayor's attempt at municipal beautification and upgrading. Can that approach win Arab approval? No. The Arabs have gotten away with lawlessness by threatening violence too long to be reined in easily now. What may appear a matter of law enforcement and city planning is a religiously motivated struggle to wrest Israel from the Jewish people, aided by foreign countries that don't realize that the same jihadists hate them, too.\n\nThe reporter did not judge whether residents have legal title to the houses and land, but one can figure out who is telling the truth by the background of the area having been a greenbelt until about 20 years ago and the widespread illegality of Arab housing. Did the reporters check aerial photos of 20 years ago?\n\nNY Times articles are replete with Arab assertions that sound impressive but are specious. For example, the statement that occupiers cannot judge what is legal.\n\nFirst, the Arab who said it implies a right (only by Arabs) to steal and build upon public land. Do foreign anti-Zionists favor that land theft? They accuse \"settlers\" of land theft, but what about the 20,000 houses in Jerusalem, alone?\n\nSecond, even if Israel were an occupier, it took control over the area in self-defense, and therefore administers it legally. Should Israel allow chaos?\n\nThird, there was no sovereign owner of the area, there was just the Mandate when Jordan invaded, seized it, then attacked Israel again and lost it in the process. Israel is chief heir to the Mandate. It had a right to annex it.\n\nFourth, the wartime separation of the Old City from the New City had no legal status, so reuniting the two parts of Jerusalem was natural.\n\nFifth, so it does not matter what a hostile, unfair world wants and rationalizes, Israel has legal sovereignty there.\n\nSixth, why don't people ask what is the basis for Palestinian Arab claims to the Old City, since they never had sovereignty over it, they never had a government there, they did not conquer it last, and only recently did they even claim to be a separate nationality, though the PLO Covenant admitted they are not but just Arabs? Do they refer to the UN General Assembly recommendation that Jerusalem not belong to an independent state? By its logic, the Palestinian Authority cannot claim it, if it is supposed to be independent. In any case, that recommendation by the General Assembly, impractical because it makes new states not viable, has no legal force. Incidentally, first the Arabs rejected the recommendation, preferring double or nothing. They got nothing. Now they want to recognize the recommendation, as a first step in conquering Israel. Hypocritical. Do not be deceived by legalistic arguments for what is motivated religiously.\n\nEthan Bronner should not have given unchallenged credence to an Arab's claim that the Mayor wants to replace al-Aksa Mosque by a renewed Jewish temple. There is no evidence for that. It is absurd, because only a powerless religious minority favors that, the government does not. Arabs who talk like that either are venting paranoia or propaganda in behalf of jihad. They who rouse people to riot over such spurious accusations are the fanatical ones, not this hardly religious Mayor.\n\nWhat about ethnic cleansing? I have consulted with the Jerusalem Buildings Dept. on their statistics and with others. The Arab population of Jerusalem has doubled. Arabs and their supporters fabricate hysterical claims of ethnic cleansing there, as they do of genocide in Gaza, where casualties were just a few hundreds out of a million and-a-half. They made similar claims about a battle in Jenin, where their figures were found to have been exaggerated many-fold. They are at war. They make false propaganda. The West should not be deceived.\n\nEthnic cleansing? I recently reported that the Mayor offered to retain many Arabs' illegal houses and one Jews' illegal house in another neighborhood. That is not the act of someone who wishes to oust Arabs. How is it that thousands of Arabs are moving from the P.A. into Jerusalem?\n\nThe Temple Mount was built by Hebrews, as was much of the Old City. They absorbed the Canaanites, and are the aborigines. Jews built the New City, too. To suggest that Jews who move into a different neighborhood of their city are \"settlers\" is to use hostile terminology.\n\nThe same newspapers keep making the same errors of presentation leaving readers with the same misunderstandings. No wonder little progress is made!\n\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL AND THE TALIBAN\n\nMoazzam Begg of Britain, a leading supporter there of the Taliban, was captured in 2001 as an enemy combatant. In 2005, he was released from Guantanamo without indictment. He formed an organization, Cageprisoners, ostensibly a human rights organization. However, he and another senior member speak in behalf of Radical Islamic rule. So what interest has he really in human rights?\n\nNevertheless, Amnesty International (A.I.) has taken him on tours of Europe, where they urge Europe to demand that more prisoners be released and that Europe give them haven.\n\nA.I. hired Gita Sahgal to head its gender affairs unit on her condition that she clean up A.I.s sordid alliance with that terrorist in the name of human rights. As soon as she addressed the matter, they suspended her. She thinks A.I. is too ideological, to the point of not understanding what really is going on. Salmon Rushdie put it, \"It looks very much as if Amnesty's leadership is suffering from a kind of moral bankruptcy and has lost the ability to distinguish right from wrong.\" (Michael Weiss, Wall St. Journal, 2/26, A13.)\n\nThe same thing was said about Human Rights Watch. I think the problem is that these organizations absorb a philosophy of indiscriminate Third World advocacy. They fail to realize that they are fostering the most oppressive, reactionary movements. In this case, a Radical Muslim is exploiting A.I. to appear moderate while promoting his agenda, which is far from moderate.\n\nI believe that people arrested by mistake should get an early hearing to correct the error, and terrorists should not be released. Why should Europe, beset by Radical Islam, should welcome more such people?\n\nLIBYA'S GADHAFI URGES ARMED JIHAD AGAISNT SWITZERLAND\n\nLibyan dictator Gadhafi (AP/Abdel Magid Al-Fergany)\n\nLibyan dictator Gadhafi urges armed jihad against Switzerland. He called Switzerland an infidel state that destroys mosques. He asks Muslims to block the entry of Swiss people and goods. He declared any Muslim who works with Switzerland an apostate. So far, few have accommodated him.\n\nThe latest contretemps may have begun in 2008, when Geneva police arrested his son on the charge of beating two servants. Libya then detained two Swiss businessmen. Libya convicted the pair of violating residency laws.\n\nIn November 2009, Switzerland passed by a large margin a referendum to ban the construction of minarets on mosques. Gadhafi may have been reacting to that vote, when Libya refused to release the two men. This week, A Libyan court voided one man's conviction, and the other started serving a four-month sentence.\n\nSwitzerland now restricts visas to Libyan citizens. Libya reacted by barring some European citizens from entering, and stopped issuing visas to much of Europe, not just to Switzerland. Italy thinks that Libya will renege on a deal to prevent illegal immigrants from departing from Libya for the EU (Wall St. Journal, 2/26, A9).\n\nTit-for-tat diplomatic retaliation seems childish to me. Innocent people get punished that way.\n\nSwitzerland neither destroys mosques nor bans their construction. Its referendum, to which I see little sense, refers only to new minarets. Gadhafi, like many Arab Muslim radicals, has a mixed-up idea of what happened, but readily calls for violence.\n\nRichard Shulman is a veteran defender of Israel on several web-based forums.

The law grants immediate citizenship to would-be immigrants whom it defines as \"Jewish.\" Gentiles may and do apply for citizenship, but for them it is not granted automatically. Some left wing, Jewish protesters call the law racist. Dr. Amy Kaplan, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-founder of the 'Breaking the Law of Return' campaign, calls Arabs who had lived in Israel as discriminated against, because the law of return does not apply to them.\n\nBar Ilan University political scientist Dr. Gerald Steinberg and Hebrew University political scientist Dr. Moshe Maor reject the protest as just another angle in a campaign to overthrow Israel, rather than a legitimate subject. Some of the protesters admit they are gunning for Israel for other reasons.\n\nDr. Maor reminds us that it was the United Nations that recommended a separate state for the Jewish people. Dr. Steinberg added, \"If there was a French group that denied the right of the French to live in France and demanded that the French language be replaced by a kind of international culture it would get absolutely no publicity,\" he added. \"But because it's Israel it gets attention.\" (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/23).\n\nThere is a international movement for denigration, defamation, and disintegration of Israel as a scapegoat on whose innocent back the world loads its self-indulged sins and blames the tarnished goat. (Tarnished with gornisht.) That movement constantly come up with another slander, falsification of history, or peculiar legal slant in order to attack Israel. This is a piling on by bullies that incorporates misguided idealists, people who hate their civilization, Jews who appease the Left in order to be accepted by it, Arabs seeking genocide, and other antisemites.\n\nIn this movement, the self-declared idealists work with totalitarians who commit real and serious crimes against humanity and with real bigots, but fail to repudiate them. What could be more evil?\n\nThe movement is phony. Now let's discuss the law of return, so as leave no doubt about its decency. It is one of the most decent endeavors in history.\n\nAn indicator of ethical belief is consistency in applying it. The anti-Zionist movement lacks such consistency. Consider its human rights and legal concept that the Law of Return is racist. Many countries have a similar law. Do the protesters object to those countries' policies? No. Only to the Jewish state's policy. Then their objection is not on principle about racism, but to what Jews do. Judeophobia!\n\nSome European countries have laws of return (and crosses in their flags). Many Arab states bar Jews from becoming citizens (and Muslim symbols in their flags). Some bar most Jews from visiting. Millions of their people hate foreigners. Some Arab regimes won't admit foreign Arab immigrants as citizens, even their children and for generations. They make Islam the official religion and may bar public display of other religions, just as they did in the middle ages. They may oppress other nationalities and religions, such as the Kurds, Berbers, Copts, Assyrians, to the point of genocide. Come to think of it, equal citizenship in such countries is not that great.\n\nNationalism is natural, though under Islam, less so. Muslim regimes worry about rebellion, so they may repress groups less likely to be loyal to them. Leftists try to apply the principle of national self-determination to western Palestinian Arabs, who are not a nationality, but deny self-determination to the Jews. Inconsistent.\n\nThe re-establishment of the State of Israel was prepared for by the Palestine Mandate, which recognized the Jewish people's historic connection with the Land of Israel (of which it had been deprived by imperialism, not the least of which was Muslim Arab imperialism). The Mandate, endorsed by the UN, encouraged their return. Israel became a place of refuge for millions of persecuted Jews, including from Arab states. It still is needed for that. The law of return merely implements the promise of Zionism, whose purpose of reunification in the holy land and homeland as well as a safe harbor for a world that still persecutes Jews. What could be more humane?\n\nIs the prospect of genocide by Palestinian Arabs far-fetched? No, there is precedent for it. They tried before. Although the UN also recommended a separate Arab state, the Zionists did not ask Arabs to leave for it, they said the Arabs may stay. Instead, the Arabs demanded everything and attempted to murder and expel the Jews, lost, and fled.\n\nHave the Palestinian Arabs reformed? No. They hate the Jews more. They now claim that their own, voluntary flight after their attempt at genocide was instead a Zionist attempt to dispossess them. Remember the strong hold that vengeance has upon the Arabs!\n\nWhat is the claim of the Palestinian Arabs to the area? Is it that ancient Arabs conquered the area? The Hebrews conquered it both before and after them. The Arabs lost control more than a thousand years ago. Nor was it ever an important center to them, including when Jordan re-conquered old Jerusalem in 1948. When World War I ended the Turkish Empire, which had ruled most of the Arabs, the victors let the Arabs have most of the Mideast and the Jews their corner of it. Fair enough, except to the Kurds and Berbers.\n\nNow suppose the law of return were overturned. Millions of Arabs would flood in. They would end Jewish self-determination. Taking their cue from Saddam vis-à-vis the Kurds or Sudan vis-à-vis the black Muslim Sudanese, the new Arab majority probably would expel and murder the millions of Jews there. Jihad would attain a big victory. What could be more inhumane?\n\nIs mass-murder what these anti-Zionists want or cannot foresee? Some principles, they have!\n\nJORDAN TO PROTECT JERUSALEM CHRISTIANS?\n\nKing Abdullah Of Jordan (AP/Michel Euler)\n\n\"Jordan's King Abdullah warned the Archbishop of Canterbury on Sunday that Israel threatens to evict Muslims and Christians from eastern Jerusalem. The king also said Jordan will act to protect non-Jewish holy sites in the Palestinian Authority area,\"\n\nJordan had signed an armistice agreement in 1949 that pledged to keep religious sites accessible, including the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. How well did the King's dynasty protect Christians in Jerusalem when it seized the Old City in 1948?\n\nJordan banned Christian purchases of property in Jerusalem, and required Christian schools to teach the Koran and to close on Fridays instead of on Sundays. Jordan restricted Christian access to Christian holy sites in the Old City and Bethlehem to the Easter and Christmas holy days and only to visiting dignitaries. By 1967, the 25,000 Christians in Jerusalem in 1948 had dwindled to 13,000.\n\nThe Jordanian Army also denied Jews access to their religious holy sites (and expelled all Jews from the Old City). Jordan desecrated the Mount of Olives cemetery.\n\nIn 1967, Israel liberated the Old City and re-opened holy sites to Christians (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/23).\n\nWhat does the King mean, Israel intends to evict Muslims and Christians from Jerusalem? It implies a program of religious apartheid that Israel does not have but that the Palestinian Authority has for Jews and applies gradually to Christians.\n\nWhat is the situation? Some Arabs fleeing the Palestinian Authority sneak into Jerusalem. There would be nothing wrong with deporting them, and much risk with retaining them.\n\nMany Arabs build illegally in Jerusalem as well as in Judea-Samaria and Israel, often on land they do not own. Some Arabs sell land to Jews, at risk of the apartheid Palestinian Authority executing them for it. If word gets out, those Arabs deny the sale. the leftist Israeli prosecutors and judges tend to oust the Jewish purchasers until years of litigation and agitation have passed. Some Jews built on purchased or state land they were allotted, went through most of the stages of permits, but when the Defense Minister arbitrarily and for politics does not not issue the final permit, the Left complains mightily that the illegal houses of Jews should be demolished.\n\nThe local and municipal governments of Israel issue demolition orders for some of those buildings. If the houses are inhabited by Arabs, the inside Left and the outside world call Israel discriminatory. Actually, it is those critics who are discriminatory, wanting Israel to over-enforce laws against Jews and under-enforce laws against Arabs.\n\nNow think of King Abdullah interfering by falsely claiming the building scofflaws need protection and issuing a veiled threat. Isn't that irresponsibly demagogic? Well, that is jihad. Incidentally, much of his armament is purchased by U.S. grants.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAVES MONEY, RISKS LIVES\n\nSmugglers and terrorists tend to traverse deserts and other areas where security is scant. Near the Judean Desert and outside the security barrier, two Jewish communities, Beit Yatir and Shani-Livnah, have been guarded by the IDF for a quarter-century. This week the Army informed the communities that it would stop guarding them by day's end. This was an economy measure.\n\nThe reduction in security there may attract terrorists (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/23).\n\nWhy no notice?\n\nISRAELI REACTION TO DUBAI ASSASSINATION ACCUSATIONS\n\nDubai police chief with photos (AP/Dubai Ruler's Media Office)\n\nEuropean countries have been questioning Israeli ambassadors about forged European passports used by the Dubai hit squad. Much of the media has condemned Israel.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Lieberman notes that the media reports cite no evidence. Although, as per usual Israeli policy, he neither confirms nor denies the accusations, he asks why they accuse Israel and whether the accusation isn't part of Mideastern hostility to Israel http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/23).\n\nThere is sufficient evidence for suspicion but not for condemnation. At least some of the passports were in the name of Israelis from Europe, and Israel once before had used forged British passports, though it later pledged not to.\n\nOn the other hand, the slain Hamas leader had other enemies, they probably would like to implicate Israel.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see.\n\nJ STREET FABRICATED ANTI-ISRAEL SCANDAL?\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry has called the anti-Israel scandal, that a returning J Street tour for Members of Congress laid at Israel's feet, a fabrication.\n\nJ Street claimed that the Deputy Foreign Minister boycotted the delegation and blacklisted it with the government. Then, said J Street, Deputy Min. Ayalon hastily apologized to the group.\n\nBarukh Binah, Foreign Ministry deputy director-general and head of its North America Division, denied there was any apology, because there was nothing to apologize for. Ayalon had not objected to meeting with the group; neither was he on their schedule; nor had he obstructed their meeting with other officials.\n\nA Foreign Ministry officials thinks that J Street exploited the Members of Congress to generate headlines that it could use in fund raising (www.imra.org.il, 2/22).\n\nThere are plots, but just as often there are misunderstandings. Unfortunately, people tend to see deliberate affront in them, when predisposed to dislike the other party. Too soon for a conclusion about this story.\n\nISRAEL ARRESTS BEST P.A. REFORMER JUST BEFORE P.A. WOULD\n\nHere is a long, verbatim story of what the Palestinian Authority really is like, how the U.S. and Israeli politics operate. It is not a pretty picture that Israel's great journalist, Caroline Glick, paints. It demonstrates that the Palestinian Authority is not worth supporting, that it engages in extra-judicial killing for sordid reasons, that the government of Israel and its politics harms the Jewish cause, and that U.S. foreign aid is another instance of government profligacy.\n\nIsrael's is the only government that can force the rest of the world to recognize that Abbas is not an ally.\n\nFahmi Shabaneh is an odd candidate for dissident status. Shabaneh is a Jerusalemite who joined the Palestinian Authority's General Intelligence Service in 1994.\n\nWorking for PA head Mahmoud Abbas and GIS commander Tawfik Tirawi, Shabaneh was tasked with investigating Arab Jerusalemites suspected of selling land to Jews. Such sales are a capital offense in the PA. Since 1994 scores of Arabs have been the victims of extra-judicial executions after having been fingered by the likes of Shabaneh.\n\nA few years ago, Abbas and Tirawi gave Shabaneh a new assignment. They put him in charge of a unit responsible for investigating corrupt activities carried out by PA officials. They probably assumed a team player like Shabaneh understood what he was supposed to do.\n\nJust as Abbas's predecessor, Yasser Arafat, reportedly had full dossiers on all of his underlings and used damning information to keep them loyal to him, so Abbas probably believed that Shabaneh's information was his to use or ignore as he saw fit.\n\nFor a while, Abbas's faith was well-placed. Shabaneh collected massive amounts of information on senior PA officials detailing their illegal activities. These activities included the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid; illegal seizure of land and homes; and monetary and sexual extortion of their fellow Palestinians.\n\nOver time, Shabaneh became disillusioned with his boss. Abbas appointed him to his job around the time he was elected PA head in 2005. Abbas ran on an anti-corruption platform. Shabaneh's information demonstrated that Abbas presided over a criminal syndicate posing as a government. And yet rather than arrest his corrupt, criminal associates Abbas promoted them.\n\nAbbas continued promoting his corrupt colleagues even after Hamas's 2006 electoral victory. That win owed to a significant degree to the widespread public revulsion with Fatah's rampant corruption.\n\nWith Israel and the US lining up to support him after the Hamas victory, Abbas continued to turn a blind eye to his colleagues' criminality. [With] his new status as the irreplaceable \"moderate,\" he allowed his advisers and colleagues to continue enriching themselves with the international donor funds that skyrocketed after Hamas's victory.\n\nSince 2006, despite the billions of dollars in international aid showered on Fatah, Hamas has consistently led Fatah in opinion polls. Rather than clean up their act, Abbas and his Fatah colleagues have sought to ingratiate themselves with their public by ratcheting up their incitement against Israel. And since Abbas has been deemed irreplaceable, the same West that turns a blind eye to his corruption, refuses to criticize his encouragement of terrorism. And this makes sense. How can the West question the only thing standing in the way of a Hamas takeover of Judea and Samaria?\n\nRecently, Shabaneh decided he had had enough. The time had come to expose what he knows. But he ran into an unanticipated difficulty. No one wanted to know. As he put it, Arab and Western journalists wouldn't touch his story for fear of being \"punished\" by the PA.\n\nIn his words, Western journalists \"don't want to hear negative things about Fatah and Abbas.\"\n\nLacking other options, Shabaneh brought his information to The Jerusalem Post's Khaled Abu Toameh.\n\nOn January 29, the Post published Abu Toameh's interview with Shabaneh on our front page. Among other impressive scoops, Shabaneh related that Abbas's associates purloined $3.2 million in cash that the US gave Abbas ahead of the 2006 elections. He told Abu Toameh how PA officials who were almost penniless in 1994 now have tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars in their private accounts. He related how he watched in horror as Abbas promoted the very officials he reported on. And he showed Abu Toameh a video of Abbas's chief of staff Rafik Husseini naked in the bedroom of a Christian woman who sought employment with the PA.\n\nIf Shabaneh's stories were about Israeli or Western officials, there is no doubt that they would have been picked up by every self-respecting news organization in the world. If he had been talking about Israelis, officials from Washington to Brussels to the UN would be loudly calling for official investigations. But since he was talking about the Palestinians, no one cared.\n\nThe State Department had nothing to say. The EU had nothing to say. The New York Times acted as if his revelations were about nothing more than a sex scandal.\n\nAs for Abbas and his cronies, they were quick to blame the Jews. They accused Shabaneh  their trusted henchman when it came to land sales to Jews  of being an Israeli agent. And when Channel 10 announced it was broadcasting Husseini's romp in the sack, Abbas demanded that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu bar the broadcast, (apparently forgetting that unlike his PA-controlled media, Israel's media organs are free).\n\nSHABANEH'S ODYSSEY from PA regime loyalist to dissident is an interesting tale. But what is more noteworthy than his personal journey is the world's indifference to his revelations.\n\nJust as the mountains of evidence that Fatah officials  including Shabaneh's boss Tirawi  have been actively involved in terrorist attacks against Israel have been systematically ignored by successive US administrations, Israeli governments and EU foreign policy chiefs, so no one wants to think about the fact that Fatah is a criminal syndicate. The implications are too devastating.\n\nSince at least 1994, successive US administrations goaded by the EU have made supporting Fatah and the PA the centerpiece of their Middle East policy. They want to receive proof that Fatah is a terrorist organization that operates like a criminal organization like they want  in the immortal words of former EU Middle East envoy Christopher Patten  \"a hole in [their] head.\"\n\nAs for the Western media, their lack of interest in Shabaneh's revelation serves as a reminder of just how mendacious much of the reportage about the Palestinians and Israel is. For 16 years, the American and European media have turned blind eyes to Palestinian misbehavior while expansively reporting every allegation against Israel  no matter how flimsy or obviously false. When the history of the media's coverage of the Middle East is written it will constitute one of the darkest chapters in Western media history.\n\nBut while the American and European allegiance to the fable of Fatah as the anchor of the two-state solution accounts for the indifference of both to Shabaneh's disclosures, what accounts for the Netanyahu government's behavior in this matter?\n\nShortly after the Post first published Shabaneh's story, the PA issued an arrest warrant against him. He was charged among other things with \"harming the national interests\" of the Palestinians.\n\nBut Abbas's henchmen couldn't put their hands on him. Israel had already arrested him.\n\nShabaneh was booked for among other things, illegally working for the PA. It is indeed illegal for Israeli residents to work for the PA. But oddly, although Israeli authorities have known whom Shabaneh worked for since 1994, until his disclosures were made public, they never saw any pressing need to arrest or prosecute him.\n\nOfficial Israel has nothing to say about Shabaneh's information. Rather, in the wake of his disclosures, everyone from Netanyahu to Defense Minister Ehud Barak has continued to proclaim daily their dedication to reaching a peace accord with Abbas. This even as Abbas and his cronies accuse Israel of using the \"traitorous\" Shabaneh to pressure Abbas into negotiating with Israel.\n\nThere are two explanations for Israel's behavior. First, there is the fact that the presence of Barak and his Labor Party in the government makes it impossible for Netanyahu and his Likud Party to abandon the failed two-state paradigm of dealing the PA. If Netanyahu and his colleagues were to point out that the PA is a kleptocracy and its senior officials enable terror and escalate incitement to deflect their public's attention away from their criminality, (as well as because they want to destroy Israel), then Labor may bolt the coalition.\n\nBeyond that, there is no doubt that an Israeli denunciation of Abbas and his mafia would enrage the US and EU. Apparently, Netanyahu  who to please President Barack Obama accepted the two-state paradigm in spite of the fact that he opposes it, and suspended Jewish construction in Judea and Samaria despite the fact that he knows doing this is wrong  is loathe to pick a fight by pointing out the obvious fact that the PA is a corrupt band of oppressive thieves.\n\nShabaneh argues that due to PA corruption, Hamas remains the preferred alternative for Palestinians in Judea and Samaria. In his view, the only reason Hamas has yet to take over Judea and Samaria is the IDF presence in the areas.\n\nThe strategic implications of his statement are clear. Far from being a bulwark against Hamas, Abbas empowers the Iranian-backed jihadist force. The only bulwark against Hamas is Israel.\n\nWHAT THIS means is that Israel must end its support for Abbas. Every day he remains in power, Abbas perpetuates a myth of Palestinian moderation. As a supposed moderate, he claims that Israel should curtail its counter terror operations and let his own \"moderate\" forces take over.\n\nTo strengthen Abbas, the US pressures Israel to curtail its counter terror operations in Judea and Samaria. To please the US, Israel in turn cuts back its operations.\n\nAbbas's men fight Hamas, but they also terrorize journalists, merchants and plain civilians who fall in their path, and so strengthen Hamas. To ratchet up public support for Fatah, Abbas escalates PA incitement against Israel. This then encourages his own forces to attack Israelis  as happened last week when one of his security officers murdered IDF St.-Sgt. Maj. Ihab Khatib. And so it goes.\n\nIt is clear that Barak will threaten to bolt the coalition if Netanyahu decides to cut off Abbas. But if he left, where would he go? Barak has nowhere to go. He will not be reelected to lead his party. And if Labor leaves the coalition, Netanyahu would still be far from losing his majority in Knesset.\n\nAs for angering the White House, the fact of the matter is that by pointing out that Abbas is not a credible leader, Israel will make it more difficult for Obama and his advisers to coerce Israel into making further concessions that will only further empower Hamas.\n\nShabaneh told the Post that he fully expects the PA to try to kill him. But in a way, the yawns that greeted his story are his best life insurance policy. Until the world stops believing that Fatah is indispensable, no one will listen to the Shabanehs of the world and so the PA has no reason to kill him.\n\nJust as the Post was the only media organ that would publish his story, so the Israeli government is the only government that can force the rest of the world to recognize that Abbas is not an ally. But to do that, the government itself must finally break with the fairy tale of Fatah moderation (via www.imra.org.il, 2/22).\n\nAHMADINEJAD PREDICTS END OF CAPITALISM\n\nIran's President Ahmadinejad said, today, that capitalism is on the verge of collapse (www.imra.org.il, 2/22)\n\nMeanwhile, American analysts report that Iran's economy is failing badly. More companies and countries are disinvesting from it since the last time I reported that.\n\nI think that it is not so much that capitalism is collapsing, as that Europe and the U.S. over-restrict it, over-tax it, and over-spend. If they reform, the system would revive.\n\nSYRIA CONDEMNS ISRAELI DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL SITES\n\nSyria condemns Israel's inclusion in its list of national sites to preserve the Cave of the Patriarchs and Rachel's Tomb. Syria called the designation \"aggression\" and a violation of international law (www.imra.org.il, 2/23).\n\nAn over-reaction. \"Aggression\" to renovate and preserve the Hebron site that Israel shares with Muslims? \"Violation of international law,\" although the Oslo Accords name Rachel's Tomb as a Jewish site and recognize the status quo of the Hebron site? (IMRA displayed the relevant portions of the Oslo Accords, 2/23.)\n\nIMRA also provided evidence that the Palestinian Arabs concocted the story of Rachel's Tomb being a mosque. \"The 'Beit-ul-Moqaddas' designation of Rachel's Tomb was first invented in 1996  that's14 years ago.\" The Bible, written a millennium before Islam was declared, describes the burial of the Hebrew patriarchs and matriarchs in Hebron. That Muslims want to consider such sites also holy to them should not mean that they then may bar them to the original people who commemorate them. But the Arabs are exclusivist about it. Hence, the hasty designation of other religions' holy sites as mosques.\n\nIncidentally, IMRA points out that whatever care Israel takes of the sites does not preclude Israel's ceding them as part of a final status agreement. Therefore, the Arab objection to their listing is propaganda and rabble-rousing, unjustified. If Israel did cede them, the Muslim Arabs undoubtedly would deprive Jews of their rights, as threatened by Muslim religious leaders and as practiced by centuries of Islamic rule and by violations of agreements by Jordan and the PLO.\n\nKING SOLOMON'S WALL FOUND IN JERUSALEM\n\nLead excavator points to site (AP/Tara Todras-Whitehill)\n\nHebrew University archaeologists found an 18-foot high, 210-foot long section of a wall built in the time of King Solomon and probably at his direction. It is in the Ophel area between the City of David and the Temple Mount's southern wall.\n\n\"Uncovered in the city wall complex are: an inner gatehouse for access into the royal quarter of the city, a royal structure adjacent to the gatehouse, and a corner tower that overlooks a substantial section of the adjacent Kidron valley.\"\n\n\"'The city wall that has been uncovered testifies to a ruling presence. Its strength and form of construction indicate a high level of engineering', excavation director Mazar said. 'The city wall is at the eastern end of the Ophel area in a high, strategic location atop the western slope of the Kidron valley.'\"\n\n\"A comparison of this latest finding with city walls and gates from the period of the First Temple, as well as pottery found at the site, enable us to postulate with a great degree of assurance that the wall that has been revealed is that which was built by King Solomon in Jerusalem in the latter part of the tenth century B.C.E.,\" said Mazar\n\n\"This is the first time that a structure from that time has been found that may correlate with written descriptions of Solomon's building in Jerusalem,\" she added. \"The Bible tells us that Solomon built  with the assistance of the Phoenicians, who were outstanding builders  the Temple and his new palace and surrounded them with a city, most probably connected to the more ancient wall of the City of David.\" Mazar specifically cites the third chapter of the First Books of Kings where it refers to \"until he (Solomon) had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.\"\n\n\"The six-meter-high gatehouse of the uncovered city wall complex is built in a style typical of those from the period of the First Temple like Megiddo, Beersheva and Ashdod.\"\n\n\"Part of the city wall complex served as commercial space and part as security stations,\" explained Mazar. Within the courtyard of the large tower there were widespread public activities, she said. It served as a public meeting ground, as a place for conducting commercial activities and cult activities, and as a location for economic and legal activities.\"\n\n\"Pottery shards discovered within the fill of the lowest floor of the royal building near the gatehouse also testify to the dating of the complex to the 10th century B.C.E. Found on the floor were remnants of large storage jars, 1.15 meters in height, that survived destruction by fire and that were found in rooms that apparently served as storage areas on the ground floor of the building. On one of the jars there is a partial inscription in ancient Hebrew indicating it belonged to a high-level government official.\"\n\n\" In addition to the pottery shards, cult figurines were also found in the area, as were seal impressions on jar handles with the word \"to the king,\" testifying to their usage within the monarchy. Also found were seal impressions (bullae) with Hebrew names, also indicating the royal nature of the structure.\" (www.imra.org.il, 2/22).\n\nAlthough Palestinian Arabs deny there is evidence for an ancient Hebrew presence there, in order to insinuate their own claims for the area, more and more evidence keeps getting uncovered. I have seen much of it.\n\nYou will note that, as usual, the writing found is Hebrew and not Arabic.

Having reported extensively on both, I am selecting the most novel and exciting points:\n\n\"The NIF raises money from American Jewry to support Israeli causes but often directs its funds to groups and individuals hostile to Israel's existence,\" such as \"Israeli-Arab nongovernmental organizations that openly and unabashedly dedicate themselves to removing Israel's Jewish character\"\n\nThe Israeli group that studied NIF subsidies, \"Im Tirtzu, accused the NIF-supported groups of calling for the establishment of a U.N. committee of inquiry in the first place, supplying it with damning materials during its operation and with praising it and \"stoking the fire\" after the report's publication.\"\n\nThe Goldstone report \"...copied major, politicized distortions of international legal norms habitually made by anti-Israel NGOs; falsely reclassified Hamas personnel as civilian police in order to indict Israel for legitimate assaults upon these forces; and invented non-existent legal obligations of which it then proceeded to find Israel in breach.\" (ZOA, headquartered in New York City and to which I belong, 2/8).\n\nWhat is the significance of those points?\n\nNIF raises funds from people who support Israel, but releases funds to groups that want to destroy Israel as a Jewish state. If Israel no longer were a Jewish state, the Jewish people would lose their sovereign right to direct their national destiny, their sanctuary against persecution, and probably their lives, once they no longer control their country and the Palestinian Arabs, who have tried before to exterminate them, take over the country. That is the \"new Israel\" and the kind of democracy that NIF wants?\n\nThe NGOs are playing the role of a secret manipulator of a willing Goldstone and UN. In praising the UN effort, they are praising themselves, probably without honestly acknowledging it is a joint effort. The revelation of the NGO role exposes the Goldstone report as largely not original and largely the handiwork of groups dedicated to destroying Israel and, as their record confirms, biased. Therefore the Goldstone report does not make a contribution to the problem but a problem out of NIF contributions.\n\nPoint 3 is self-explanatory, revealing that the Goldstone report is of false scholarship, just a hatchet job. Unfortunately, people inclined against Israel seize upon false scholarship for ammunition against the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza.\n\nIRAN: WE WILL STUN THE WEST\n\nIran's Supreme leader Khamenei (AP/Vahid Salemi)\n\nAyatollah Khamenei said that Iran soon will deliver a \"stunning punch\" to the West. Iran already did, by withdrawing its offer to let foreign countries enrich limited quantities of ore. Instead it will do its own enrichment, unsupervised.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, concludes: (1) Iran never intended to compromise about enrichment, just to stay the West's hand by talking about compromise; (2) It now is too late for a gasoline embargo to work; and (3) Only a military option is left (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/9).\n\nEUROPEAN FREEDOM ENDANGERED BY ISLAM?\n\nGeert Wilders (AP/Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\nOn trial for discrimination against Islam, Dutch party leader Geert Wilders says that freedom of speech is on trial and European freedom is endangered by Islam.\n\nHe told my source, \"I'm fighting for one thing: the preservation of our culture, which is based on Christianity, Judaism and humanism  and not on Islam... While Islamization of our society grows, the political elite looks in the other direction and ignores the real problem, namely, the impending loss of our freedom. I am fighting not against Moslems, but against the influx of a totalitarian ideology called Islam.\"\n\n\"Asked if he has been cited for generalizing about Moslems, Wilders responded that he does not talk about Muslims per se: 'I know the majority of Muslims are not terrorists, but are rather law-abiding citizens. Islam is the problem; in Islam, there is no room for anything else but Islam, and therefore at the end of the day, we will lose everything that we stand for. I've visited almost every Islamic country, and I know that wherever Islam is dominant, there is one common denominator, and that is a loss of freedom, especially for Jews, women, non-Muslims, etc. We have to stand up and say that whoever wants to replace our ideology and culture with Islam is not welcome to stay.'\"\n\n\"People must know that I, a democratically elected politician who does not employ violence and the like, am being put on trial for speaking my mind and for making a movie (Fitna) that simply quotes the Koran itself. There must only be one outcome for this trial, and that is a full acquittal  and if not, Europe will pay a heavy price.\"\n\nWilders said that the Israeli-Arab conflict is not, \"as some believe, an issue of territory; if Israel would give back land, nothing would change. In truth, it's a conflict of ideology. Theirs is an ideology of hatred that wants to conquer the free world; Israel is like the canary in our coal mine. We cannot afford to lose Israel.\"\n\n\"He noted that the media in Holland is largely against him, and that his trial is not totally fair: 'Of the 18 witnesses I wished to call in my defense, the court only allowed me three  and even those three will only be heard behind closed doors. How can I defend myself under such circumstances?'\"\n\nHe said, \"Many of our politicians in Europe are simply afraid; they are appeasers... There is a lot of fear and a lot of political correctness, and the only way to deal with this is to stand up and not be afraid and not allow yourself to be intimidated.\" (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/9.)\n\nEstablishments tend to repress dissent rather than debate it. Climatologists' illustrated this. But some totalitarian movements and their ostensibly liberal enablers go the furthest in repression.\n\nMr. Wilders makes a great effort not to defame. Thus his movie quotes Islamic sources and cites anti-democratic Muslim actions. He does not make up anything false. Putting him on trial for telling the truth vindicates his avowed concern.\n\nUCAL IRVINE STUDENTS SHOUT DOWN ISRAELI AMBASSADOR\n\nAs the image of Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren, at left, is projected on the screen, a woman records protesters being escorted out by the UC Irvine police.\n\nUniversity of California Irvine students were listening to a speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren, when some among them heckled so much that his presentation was curtailed and a dozen of them were arrested for disorderly conduct. They called Ambassador Oren a murderer [without evidence].\n\nThe head of the political science department chided the protesters for denying the free speech rights of the hundreds of people in the overflow audience. The protesters interrupted him, too. Two years earlier, they had given Daniel Pipes the same treatment.\n\nAn Israeli parliamentarian called the student disruption the intellectual side of the war. (Actually it is anti-intellectual.)\n\nThe Muslim Students Union pointed out that the UN had condemned Israel more than any other country, and Oren should have been barred. Other people, however, have pointed out that the UN ignores human rights violation in the Palestinian Authority, Sudan, S. Arabia, Syria, and Egypt. (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/9).\n\nThat would account partially for the disproportionate condemnation of Israel.\n\nThere was supposed to be a question-and-answer session. That is when critics could have raised pertinent objections. But that would have given Oren an opportunity to debunk them. They denied the audience an opportunity to hear this. Should students be allowed to wage war on university?\n\nIronic, isn't it, that people who do not believe in civil liberties indignantly but falsely accuse others of violating peoples' civil liberties and, inconsistently, urge us to rescind civil liberties of those people and their American audiences!\n\nISRAELIS REACT TO EXPOSE OF NIF\n\nIn reaction to an expose of New Israel Fund financing of the anti-Israel organizations that contributed substantially to the UN Goldstone report condemning the IDF, the Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, who heads the Labor Party, criticized the Fund for it but does not support an official probe of it, because, he said, the Fund does some good things for Israel, too. The Kadima Party will not propose a probe (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/, 2/9).\n\nTzipi Livni, head of Kadima Party (A.P./Tara Todras-Whithill)\n\nBarak's rationale is not logical. An official probe would verify the facts and could propose a solution that does not prevent good things for Israel but halts the subversion of Israel.\n\nI think that Barak resents his Army's being unfairly criticized, but being anti-Zionist himself, like Kadima, lets fellow leftists proceed to subvert. The Israeli Left is more averse to Israeli protection from subversion than to subversion.\n\n5 REASONS AN AMERICAN WELCOMES IRAN A-BOMBS\n\nREASON 1. IF IRAN GETS NUKES, THE U.S. COULD DEFEAT TERRORISM\n\nDefense analyst Adam B. Lowther at the Air Force Research Institute personally finds that the imminent prospect of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is good for the U.S..\n\nWhy imminent? Iran is preparing to enrich its stockpile of uranium \"in order to power a medical reactor.\" He implies that such enrichment brings the stockpile just a short sprint from the finish line of weapons grade.\n\nObviously, U.S. policy on Iran is failing. Since the policy does not work, he suggests viewing the result as beneficial. He has five reasons. Reason 1: If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it would give the U.S. an opportunity to \"...defeat violent Sunni-Arab terrorist groups like al-Qaida.\n\nWhy an opportunity? \"Iran is primarily a threat to its neighbors, not to the U.S..\" The U.S. could offer those neighbors a nuclear umbrella \"in exchange for economic, political and social reforms in the autocratic Arab regimes responsible for breeding the discontent that led to...\" 9/11. The Arab regimes would have to fall in line, because their petroleum reserves no longer would inhibit attacks on them (NY Times, 2/9, Op.-Ed.).\n\nHow much comfort shall Americans take in Lowther's hedging, that Iran is \"not primarily\" a menace to the U.S.? Suppose either the Arabs or Iran doubt believe U.S. threats to reply to their nuclear aggression with a nuclear attack? Hasn't the U.S. issued deadlines to Iran before, that it did not implement? Isn't President Obama refusing to pre-empt Iran's nuclear weapons?\n\nNor is it true. Iran's stated goal is global dominance after regional dominance. Iran has threatened not only its neighbors but U.S. bases there, Europe, and the U.S.. Nuclear weapons can be delivered not only by missiles and airplanes, but Iran is building longer and longer range missiles, too, as is N. Korea. Does he view our failed anti-proliferation policy a success in N. Korea as an opportunity to get friendlier with China?\n\nI would like to see Arab regimes reform, too. The reforms Lowther recommends are not as directly responsible for 9/11 as religious ideology, which he omits. Apparently he fails to understand the problem. He also does not seem to understand that Iran works with Sunni terrorists, not only with Shiites.\n\nHe wants the U.S. to take on responsibility for: (1) Dictating a new culture to the Arab world; (2) Enforcing a pax Americana by threat of nuclear war. Is that the President George Bush \"new world order?\" Does President Obama want more U.S. responsibility abroad?\n\nLowther depends on unstated assumptions, as do many who propose counter-intuitive, grandiose schemes. Would and could Arab states submit to foreign dictation of their basic culture? Why would they trust the U.S. now?\n\nSuppose the Arabs instead develop their own nuclear weapons, as some already have begun doing? U.S. failure with Iran has stimulated proliferation!\n\nAs if that were not enough, the U.S. is about to sign a nuclear development project with Jordan, although learning about civilian nuclear development is s short step from learning about military development. When the Arabs develop their own nuclear weaponry, what happens to the advantage of U.S. nuclear umbrella for the Arabs?\n\nLowther refers to this umbrella as covering the Mideast. Does he include Israel? Then his plan is to remove military nuclear capability from Israel? Suppose the Arabs then attack and overwhelm Israel with non-nuclear weaponry, including other weapons of mass-destruction, such as nerve gas.\n\nLowther's plan may be well thought out, but such thought is not evident in his Op.-Ed..\n\nREASON 2. U.S. COULD BREAK OPEC CARTEL\n\nThe second advantage for the U.S. that Mr. Lowther sees in a nuclear armed Iran is that by becoming the protector of regional security, the U.S. could break OPEC. In return for protection, the U.S. would demand an end to the cartel's policies that are illegal in the U.S.. Ending monopolistic prices would depress oil prices significantly.\n\nAgain, the U.S. would be dictating, only this time, instead of doing so to end terrorism, good for the world, the U.S. would be doing so for its own financial benefit.\n\nDid Mr. Lowther take into account likely reactions from China and from Russia, which depends on income from selling weapons to the Arabs, paid for by high oil prices, and which depends on exporting oil at high prices?\n\nWhy doesn't Lowther think more broadly and suggest lowering U.S. demand for oil as a sure way to help reduce oil prices? Current profligacy of consumption has raised prices.\n\nREASON 3. PALESTINIAN ARABS & ISRAEL MIGHT RECONCILE\n\nThe third advantage for the U.S. that Mr. Lowther sees in a nuclear Iran is that it might reconcile the Palestinian Authority (P.A.) and Israel. He thinks they might reconcile, because: (1) Israel feels threatened by Iran's nuclear program and the Palestinian Authority Arabs should feel threatened; and (2) An Iranian nuclear strike on Israel would devastate the P.A., too.\n\nSuch reconciliation \"would go a long way to undercutting Tehran's animosity toward Israel, and would ease longstanding tensions in the region.\n\nLowther does not indicate why the P.A. would reconcile with Israel over this. He does not indicate why it should undercut Iran's anti-Israel stance. He does not explain why Muslim regimes are anti-Israel. The \"longstanding tensions\" with the Arabs preceded Iran's clerical regime. Lowther does not seem to recognize that the conflict is over religion, whose doctrine does not change even if his program were implemented. He believes Iran's claim to disapprove of Israel partly because the P.A. is in conflict with it. The claim is a pretext. The Shah of Iran did not disapprove of Israel, despite the Arab-Israel conflict, but the clerical regime that ousted him takes the Islamic religious imperative more seriously.\n\nWould the prospect of an Iranian nuclear strike on Israel worry the P.A.? When Saddam fired Scuds at Israel, Palestinian Arabs cheered from their rooftops, even though Arabs were killed. Terrorists kill more Muslims than do anybody else. Hamas risks its civilians by putting its combatants amongst them. Don't worry, Muslim clerics have told endangered civilians, you'd be considered martyrs, with all the accompanying heavenly rewards.\n\nREASON 4. U.S. COULD SELL ARABS MORE WEAPONS\n\nThe fourth advantage for the for the U.S. that Mr. Lowther sees in a nuclear Iran is: \"a growth in exports of weapons systems, training and advice to our Middle Eastern allies would not only strengthen our current partnership efforts but give the American defense industry a needed shot in the arm.\" Otherwise, our military may decline just when a rising China may threaten us. That catastrophe could be forestalled by a nuclear arming Iran, he writes with gratitude.\n\nHis argument is vague. Who are these partners and what do they want and what does he expect of them? Why would they need still more arms? Not to deal with al-Qaida, which Lowther imagines that U.S. prompting would get them to defeat. Then is it to continue their feuding? Is it to pay a visit to Israel? What wars are he and the military-industrial complex facilitating now?\n\nHis reason 2 was that the U.S. would be able to reduce oil prices. Then with what income would the Arabs purchase more arms?\n\nHalf the arms that the U.S. sends the Mideast our taxpayers pay for. This includes billions to Israel, Egypt, Palestinian Authority, and Jordan. I think the U.S. should discontinue that subsidy, but to be fair, the U.S. should erase Israel's debt to it, just as the U.S. erased Egypt's debt to the U.S.. Israeli high interest on its debt matches the total U.S. aid.\n\nGreater arms sales may help the U.S. arms industry (and, as explained in earlier articles, hobble the rival Israeli arms industry), but it wears out the U.S. economy. In case Lowther has not noticed, the U.S. already is declining. One reason is military over-spending and U.S. over-commitment of the type he envisages. Defense Sec. Gates is trying to curb spending on unnecessary weapons desired by Members of Congress in whose districts those weapons are made.\n\n(Unfortunately, Gates may be going too far. He may be curbing our ability to wage conventional war.)\n\nSuppose the Arabs decide to buy arms from other countries? Increasingly they make their own. Lowther may be counting on income not to be received.\n\nREASON 5. REDUCING PETRO-DOLLAR OUTFLOW\n\nThe fifth advantage for the U.S. that Mr. Lowther sees in a nuclear Iran is: \"stem the flow of dollars to autocratic regimes in the region. It would accomplish this not only by driving down the price of oil (by dictating the decrease) and increasing arms exports, but by requiring the beneficiaries of American security to bear a real share of its cost. And in the long run, a victory in the war on terrorism would save taxpayers the tens of billions of dollars a year now spent on overseas counter-insurgency operations.\"\n\nLowther still contradicts himself by supposing that fewer oil dollars to the Arabs would enable them to buy more arms. By the time he got to this fifth reason, he forgot that his reason 1 was ending the autocracy of Arab regimes. If their autocracy ends, why should they have less money to institute the reforms their people would expect?\n\nSuppose the proud Arabs declare the U.S. demands too onerous and arrogant?\n\nI think that Lowther makes self-contradictory and dubious assumptions. The world does not work so simply as he imagines. The U.S. is not as dominant he supposes, enabling it to institute what theorists dream up without countervailing powers injecting their own influence.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS: HAS OBAMA A SECRET AGENDA?\n\nMr. Lowther does not mention an alternative policy of military destruction of Iran's nuclear facilities. Is that because he actually prefers Iran to gain nuclear weaponry? How much of his defeatist attitude is shared by those who are supposed to develop strategy against threats to the U.S. and institute policy against it?\n\nDid the Obama Administration really want to stop Iran with even non-military measures? Winston Mideast Analysis & Commentary contends that it did not and that both the Obama and Bush administrations wanted Israel to relinquish any nuclear weapons.\n\nEmanuel Winston puts it this way, \"Clearly, Obama came into office with a secret agenda  to protect an expanding hostile Islam by attacking Israel. No doubt, you will recall Obama's blatant lies to the American Jewish community, Evangelical Christians and Americans generally, when in his pre-election speeches, he assured us all that he would continue to support Israel. But, Obama has demonstrated that he is an accomplished liar and sophist. (A sophist is a person who can speak convincingly on either sides of any subject.) Obama not only lies but, has used his linguistic talent to explain away every failure of his policies. Obama's bias against Israel reflects his early Muslim roots.\" (2/9.) [This strong assertion is based upon Obama's statements and behavior, but is not proved.]\n\nHere is some evidence from what Obama told the Arabs on 6/4/09: \"I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. No single nation should pick and choose which nations hold nuclear weapons. That is why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons. And any nation  including Iran  should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That commitment is at the core of the Treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.\" [By that time it long had been obvious that Iran was not abiding by its responsibilities under the Treaty. Therefore, this was lip service, in other words, sophistry, an example of what Winston accuses Obama of.]\n\nObama's dithering may appear as indecision, like many other Obama problems, but Mr. Winston suggests that it deliberately cleared the way for Iran to complete nuclear development.\n\nObama's agenda is explained by Moshe Dann in Israelnationalnews.com, 8/14/06, forwarded by Winston. Obama accepts nuclear proliferation in one sense until there is universal nuclear disarmament, which he is pressing Israel to accept. Israel did not sign the Non-Proliferation travesty. If it did, it would have to open its facilities for inspection and become subjected to pressure to any disarm nuclear weaponry. It would lose its deterrence, whereas violators would not. The loss of Israel's deterrence, combined with Obama's other goal, Israeli withdrawal to indefensible borders, would assure Israel's destruction even by conventional means. Obama's policies, like Bush's, could be called Mutually Assured Destruction of Israel.\n\nHere is what Winston Mideast Analysis and Commentary points out is wrong with complacency and welcoming of Iranian nuclear arming. The notion of mutually assured destruction by nuclear armed foes led to the concept of nuclear assured deterrence. One country would not initiate nuclear warfare with another having a second-strike capability, lest that second strike devastate the aggressor. In addition, as Chinese nuclear testing showed, radiation from a strike circles the globe and can irradiate unintended areas.\n\nNuclear assured deterrence worked, until now. People drew the wrong conclusion about why the policy and concept worked. They generalized that it always would work. More likely, however, it works with certain cultures and not with others. It works with emotionally rational cultures having a survival instinct. The Soviets wanted to live to see their system triumph. The West wants to survive. So does India. Probably Saudi Arabia would want its oil fields to survive and continue providing the ruling class with luxury. Egypt probably would be trustworthy in this, but how long will its regime stave off the influential but Radical Moslem Brotherhood? Israel lives under threat of attack and has been attacked, but withheld use of nuclear weapons it is believed to have, reserving such weapons as a last resort, so that enemies in a position to overrun it know it would the last thing they do.\n\nThe leaders of Iran and Radical Islam have different instincts and ideology. If after a great war, some Muslims are left standing, they would consider that a triumph. If they bring on \"The End of Days,\" they believe that the Hidden Imam would reveal himself, Allah would send all the Muslims to eternal reward, and all the non-Muslims to eternal punishment. Ahmadinejad said he'd welcome this. Once he attained nuclear weaponry, he could not be deterred. Rus"
