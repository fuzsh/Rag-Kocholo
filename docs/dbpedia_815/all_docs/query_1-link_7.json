        "text": "The Changing Campus\n\nThe first classes were held using leased space in the Continental Fire Hall in downtown Houghton. This building still stands and is currently being used for storage. It can be seen on Montezuma avenue, right next to the old Portage Lake District Library.\n\nHubbell Hall\n\nThe first building on campus, completed in 1890, was originally known simply as “The Mining School.” Once a second building was constructed to house engineering disciplines, it became known as “The Science building.” For most of its existence, it was known as Hubbell Hall. Hubbell Hall was demolished in 1968. It was approximately where the MEEM building is currently located. This archival photo can be found in numerous MTU publications.\n\nBy 1928 there were more than a half-dozen buildings on campus. The 1928 Library later became known as “academic offices and the library,” with an addition built to the north. Now it is the home of Social Science, Business, and Education. The Gymnasium, next to Hubbell Hall, currently houses ROTC. The Chemistry and Metallurgy buildings shown are replacements for earlier Chemistry and Metallurgy buildings which burned in 1920 and 1923 respectively. Both Chemistry buildings were known as Koenig Hall. The new metallurgy building would be known as McNair Hall (not to be confused with the current residence hall of the same name).\n\nBy 1955, some of campus has spilled over to the south side of College Avenue. The President’s House (Bldg 9, at the corner of Oak St and Houghton Ave) is approximately where Fisher Hall’s large lecture room, Fisher 135, is currently located.\n\nAround 1970, US41 was routed around campus as a four lane highway. Shortly after this, most of College Avenue through campus was removed.\n\nIn 2002, the Rozsa Center for the Performing was built to the East of Walker Arts Center (which itself was a “remodel” of Sherman Gym). A major building project was undertaken in 2004 between Fisher Hall and the Van Pelt Library to add computer facilities, classroom space, and to improve the Library. Phase II of this work will be a remodelling of Fisher Hall. A second floor walkway connects the new construction and the library.\n\nMichigan College of Science and Technology\n\nFrom 1927 until 1964 the institution was known as the Michigan College of Mining and Technology (MCMT).\n\nA new State of Michigan Constitution was adopted by the MI Constitutional Convention on August 1, 1962. The vote to ratify the new constitution was certified on June 20, 1963 (with 50.2% in favor, 49.8% against). That constitution refers to the Michigan College of Science and Technology in Article VIII, Sec 4, and was to take effect January 1, 1964. The Tech Board of Control had discussed the name change issue prior to this but deferred any action until after the vote on the new constitution.\n\nOn October 11, 1963, the Tech Board of Control was given two resolutions, one to change the name to Michigan College of Science and Technology (MCST) and one to change to Michigan Technological University (MTU). The resolution to change to MCST passed and the one for MTU was not acted upon. The resolution called for the name change to take effect “on January 1, 1964” and to remain “the official name until such time as the Board of Control may select and adopt another name.” However it is not clear that the Tech Board of Control had the authority to change the name of the institution.\n\nThere was no mention of the Board’s action in the newspapers for some time. The first seems to have been almost a month later in the Student Newspaper, The Lode. Following that, a large number of articles, editorials, and letters to the editor appeared pushing for the “University” designation.\n\nOn December 3, 1963, Senate Bill 1016 and House Bill 56 were introduced to the second extra session of the Michigan Legislature. These were identical bills which renamed MCMT to MCST and increased the size of the Board of Control. House Bill 56 was later amended in committee to change the name to MTU rather than to MCST. As originally introduced, these bills were to take effect “on January 1, 1964.”\n\nAlso early in December Senate Bill 1008 was introduced which, after amendment, renamed MCMT to MTU.\n\nHouse Bill 56 (as amended) and Senate Bill 1008 passed and ended up as public acts 21 and 49. Senate Bill 1016 was never passed, presumably because the identical House Bill had already passed. Public act 21 also changes the names of Ferris Institute to Ferris State College, and Grand Valley College to Grand Valley State College.\n\nThe wording regarding the name change is similar in public acts 21 and 49. Quoting from public act 49: “The institution established in the Upper Peninsula known as the Michigan college of mining and technology, referred to in the constitution of 1963 as the Michigan college of science and technology, is continued after January 1, 1964, under the name of Michigan Technological University, …”\n\nThe phrase “after January 1, 1964” was explicitly added by amendment. Possibly this was to avoid a constitutional crisis since the constitution was to take effect “on January 1, 1964,” with the MCST name. However, the wording in the constitution also included the phrase “… by whatever names (MCST) may be hereafter known.” How long “after” the name changes were to take effect is not specified in the legislation.\n\nThe bills were signed into law by governor George Romney on December 27, 1963 and were to take effect immediately. A picture of the bill signing can be found in the 1948 Keweenawan (the MTU yearbook), page 48, as well as in the local newspaper.\n\nAt their February 14, 1964, meeting the Tech Board of Control passed a resolution “ratifying and confirming” the name Michigan Technological University and ordering “that the name Michigan Technological University be used hereafter as the legal and official name of the institution.” Again, it may be the Board of Control overstepped its authority. At the same meeting they considered some new designs for official seals and insignia but postponed action until later. The minutes of that meeting indicate that President Van Pelt thanked the Board of Control members for their support for the MTU name which they had communicated to the state legislature the previous December, though no mention of the subject could be found in the minutes of the Board of Control’s meeting from December. Presumably the support was given as a private communication and not through official action of the Board.\n\nIn none of these is there any mention of Tech having the MCST name for one hour, or for any length of time at all, as a matter of fact. On page 8 of the Daily Mining Gazette of December 31, 1963, before any changes took effect, is a brief report about some students who had purchased rings and sweaters with the MCST name in anticipation of that new name which never happened, and how the students were pleased, rather than disappointed, to have a unique artifact of the process. It is clear that most, if not all, regarded the change in name as being directly from MCMT to MTU and that that was the intention behind the legislation.\n\nFrom The Daily Mining Gazette, December 31, 1963\n\nTech Students Jump the Gun: Name Change\n\nA few Michigan Tech students are having the rare opportunity these days of wearing the emblem or insignia of a college which does not exist despite the fact that the institution represented does have a tradition which goes back more than three-quarters of a century. The students are sporting either sweaters or rings of the Michigan College of Science and Technology, an institutional name which had been projected but which never matured into a realistic title. The unusual rings or sweaters were procured through supposition on the part of their purchasers that Michigan Tech would bear the Michigan College of Science and Technology title Jan. 1. Recent action on the part of college authorities and others, however, have given the onetime Michigan College of Mines the title of Michigan Technological University. On Jan. 1, as a result, this name will apply to Tech thus making it one of the state’s universities. Instead of a regretful purchase on the part of the purchaser, actually he may think of his new ring or sweater as a rare item. The token could well give the student the unusual opportunity of wearing the item of a college which never existed despite the fact that college authorities had approved the title Michigan Tech has had four names during its history. It has been a school, college and, now, a university\n\nWhether or not the Board of Control has any name changing authority is also somewhat vague in the legislation. Within public act 49 is a statement regarding the powers of the Board of Control. After a detailed list which makes no mention of authority regarding the institution’s name, is the statement “All powers customarily exercised by the governing board of a college or university are vested in the board. The enumeration of powers herein is not deemed to exclude any of such powers not expressly excluded by law.” Since many colleges and universities have changed their name due to action of their governing board — a recent local example being the change from Suomi College to Finlandia University — perhaps the board does have name changing power.\n\nHence, it would indeed seem possible that, by a quirk, “on January 1, 1964” our name was MCST (due to the Board action on October 11 and/or due to the new constitution) and then the MTU name took effect only “after January 1, 1964.”\n\n(If you have an artifact from 1963 with the MCST name on it, the MTU Archives would like to hear from you.)\n\nCampus Maps\n\nA current campus map is available. While we provide some examples over the years, older campus maps and other historical descriptions of the campus can be found in a number of places, one convenient location is within the University catalogs, a collection of which can be found at the MTU Archives and Copper Country Historical Collection located within the Van Pelt Library.\n\nFisher Hall\n\nConstruction began on a new Physics and Mathematics Building in 1962. Shortly before the groundbreaking, James Fisher, Jr., passed away. Fisher had been Professor and Department head of Mathematics and Physics for over 40 years, on the faculty for 50 years, and after his mandatory retirement in 1944, he remained active, especially with the alumni association. He was a Michigan Mining School graduate (1893) and Hancock native and he was much respected in the community. In recognition of his contributions to Michigan Tech and the community, the new building was named for him and was dedicated to him when it opened in 1964.\n\nFisher Hall currently houses the departments of Physics and Mathematical Sciences. Up until 2004, it also housed Computer Science. Fisher Hall has a large number of classrooms which are used by many other departments on campus. Of the academic buildings on campus, it is now one of the oldest.\n\nAn addition, named the Kanwal and Ann Rekhi Computer Science Hall, was added during 2003-2004 to the West side of the building (to the left in the picture above) largely to house computer science faculty and classrooms. During the summer of 2006, some of the classrooms and public areas inside Fisher Hall received a much-needed face lift. For a more detailed history of Fisher Hall see Michigan Tech News, 50 Years of Fisher Hall.\n\nStatements of Purpose\n\nExcerpts from the Michigan College of Mines - Statement of Purpose from 1916-17 Catalog\n\nGeneral Statement\n\n\"The Michigan College of Mines was established by an Act of the\n\nLegislature in 1885. The act was entitled 'An Act to establish and\n\nregulate a Mining School in the Upper Peninsula.' The Act vests the\n\ngovernment of the institution in a Board of Control of six members\n\nappointed by the Governor of the State, by and with the consent of the\n\nSenate. Two members of the Board are appointed each alternate year\n\nto serve six years.\n\nSec. 5 of this Act provides: 'The course of instruction shall\n\nembrace geology, mineralogy, chemistry, mining and mining\n\nengineering and such other branches of practical and theoretical\n\nknowledge as will, in the opinion of the board, conduce to the end of\n\nenabling the students of said institution to obtain a full knowledge of\n\nthe science, art and practice of mining, and the application of\n\nmachinery thereto.'”\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\"The concentration of effort on training men for the field of mining,\n\nthe location of the College in a district where its students live in a\n\nmining atmosphere, together with its special methods of instruction,\n\nand manner of using the mining environment, have brought to the\n\ninstitution a large measure of success.\n\nThe College was established for, and exists only for the purpose of\n\ntraining men to take an active part in the development of the mineral\n\nwealth of the state and nation. The concentration of effort on a\n\nparticular line of training has its advantages. . . . . . .\"\n\nExcerpts from the College of Mining and Technology - Statement of Purpose from 1927 Catalog\n\nGeneral Information\n\n\"The purpose of the College, as stated in the law is very broad. 'Said College\n\nshall provide the inhabitants of this State with the means of acquiring a thorough\n\nknowledge of the mineral industry in its various phases, and of the application of\n\nscience to industry, as exemplified by the various engineering courses offered at\n\ntechnological institutions, and shall seek to promote the welfare of the industries\n\nof the state . . .' This act was passed by the state legislature of 1927 and broadens\n\nthe scope of the College in recognition of existing facts. While in the past the\n\ninstruction given at the College has covered the mining and metallurgical fields,\n\nthese branches of engineering are really the application of civil, mechanical,\n\nelectrical and chemical engineering to the business of producing mineral wealth.\n\nThe successful mining engineer and metallurgical engineer require broad\n\nknowledge of all phases of engineering, and as such are really entitled to\n\nrecognition as general engineers, equipped to undertake work in almost any\n\nbranch of the engineering profession. Consequently changing the name of the\n\nCollege and broadening its scope to make it a college of technology, demands only\n\nmoderate additions to its curriculum, and very greatly increases its usefulness.\"\n\nExcerpts from the Department of Physics, Applied Physics, and Geophysical Engineering - Statement from 1965 Catalog\n\nDepartment Head: Professor Stebbins\n\nProfessors: Bacon, Keeling, Longacre, Mitchell, Pratt, Wyble, and Yerg\n\nAssociate Professors: Baldwin, Chimino, Hinzmann, and Shandley\n\nAssistant Professors: Mount and Parks\n\n\"PHYSICS is concerned with matter and energy and their\n\ninteractions, and hence is of fundamental importance in science and\n\nengineering. Advances in knowledge of physics have been accompanied by\n\nbetter understanding of the universe, by new or improved products, and by a\n\nmore effective utilization of natural resources.\n\nPrograms are available for students with high interest and aptitude in\n\nmathematics and physical science to major in physics, applied physics, or\n\ngeophysical engineering. The curriculum in physics is designed primarily for\n\nthose students who plan to do graduate work and then engage in teaching or\n\nresearch. The curriculum in applied physics is rich in mathematics and\n\nengineering science and is technology-oriented, however, it need not be\n\nconsidered a terminal program, since many of the graduates enroll in advanced\n\nstudies. The curriculum in geophysical engineering is designed to provide\n\nenough engineering training so that the graduate may be immediately useful in\n\nthe industry, and also is sufficiently broad and thorough to permit students to\n\ncontinue graduate work in geophysics.\n\nFor the students who establish good records in the undergraduate\n\ncurricula, additional training is strongly recommended. At the graduate level,\n\nprograms leading to the Master of Science degree in physics or in geophysics\n\nare offered.\"\n\nCurricula - Catalog Listings\n\n1891 Admissions Test Questions\n\nHere are two physics-related sections from the Sample Admissions Test excerpted as written (including typos) from the 1891 Michigan Mining School Catalogue.

week; spring term, fifteen hours a week.\n\nTwo terms of fourteen weeks each are spent upon the study of General Physics, including the topics of Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Heat, Light, Magnetism and Electricity. In these two terms regular recitations are required, and the topics are illustrated by the instructor with lectures and experiments. This course closes with a term of six weeks of recitation and laboratory work, in which the student is required to do the work under the supervision of the instructor, the experiments being mostly in the domain of physical measurements, including those of Specific Gravity, Heat, Light and Electricity.\n\nThe method of instruction in this department combines recitations, lectures, laboratory work, and the solution of problems, in such a way as not only to afford the necessary variety, but at the same time to furnish also a constant encouragement to the student to become selfreliant both in his methods of thought and in his work.\n\nIn the laboratory work of this department each student is required to make a sketch and give a description of the apparatus used in each experiment; to put down his data, computation, conclusions, etc, during laboratory hours, in a note book; and, at the close of the laboratory work of each day to leave this book with the instructor for his inspection.\n\nNo student is permitted to take this practical laboratory course who has not passed in the necessary theoretical study and lectures that preceded it.\n\nThe equipment of the Physical Laboratory, which was quite recently begun and which is constantly growing, now contains among other pieces for lecture purposes the following:\n\nMariott’s Apparatus\n\nSavart’s Wheel\n\nAtwood’s Machine\n\nA Large Toepler-Holtz Electric Machine\n\nAn Edison dynamo\n\n5 small electric Motors\n\n1 set Natterer Tubes\n\n2 sets Geissler Tubes\n\n1 Combined Polariscope and Stauroscope\n\n1 Combined Projecting Lantern and Polariscope\n\n1 Lissajou’s Apparatus.\n\n2 Singing Flame Apparatus\n\n1 Tonometer\n\nThe following list embraces a part of the apparatus now contained in the laboratory, for students’ use:\n\n5 Earth Inductors\n\n5 Sliding Coil Magnets\n\n4 Tangent Galvanometers\n\n6 Astatic Galvanometers\n\n4 Single Coil Mirror Galvanometers\n\n4 Double Coil Mirror Galvanometers\n\n3 Dead-Beat Mirror Galvanometers\n\n12 Sets for Kundt’s Experiment\n\n24 Resistance Coils\n\n12 Calorimeters\n\n12 Stem Jackets, “Apparatus A.”\n\n8 Resistance Boxes, range 1 ohm to 11332 ohms\n\n5 Spectragoniometers (Geneva)\n\n6 Benson Photometers\n\n12 Micrometers (ratchet)\n\n13 Spherometers\n\n6 Pierce’s Bridges\n\n1 B.
