Furthermore, when a local school is chosen as a model for study in colleges nationwide, it's time for a community to be proud. Lady's Island Elementary School (LIES) is that school and they are celebrating being on the cover of a just released college text on arts integration. The cover shows student art photographed by Eric Smith of Captured Moments in Beaufort.\n\nIn a book launch event, a crowded room of parents, students and administrators applauded as participating teachers and principal Marvelle Ulmer were given special bound presentation copies of Claudia Cornett's Creating Meaning through Literature and the Arts."
