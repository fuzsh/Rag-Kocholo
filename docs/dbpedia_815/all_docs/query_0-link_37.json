        "text": "Summary The text analyzes the discourse on modernist genius functioning within the critical reception of the works of an American abstract painter Georgia O’Keeffe in the 1910s and 1920s. The aim is to reflect on how the understanding of O’Keeffe as an atypical artist in the masculinized reality of her time influenced the views on the ideal of genius articulated by art critics during the discussed period. The text also aims to revise some concepts regarding the painter’s presence in the artistic world and the position of her artwork therein.\n\nGeorgia O'Keeffe, inspired by the bleak Texan landscape, draws a fissure, line or hole that opens up an unprecedented scene out of nothingness. She composes her blank canvases by ‘filling the space beautifully’. She admitted that: \" Out where the canyon begins … Slits of nothingness are not very easy to paint,\" Perhaps this is why they concretely and metaphorically helped her find her ‘breakthrough’ leaving behind European Modernism. She drew such gaps or spaces again and again to compose and even incarnate many of her most unlikely subjects from pure abstracts or barren landscapes to sculls and clamshells. Her paintings of flowers, pelvic bones, patio doors and abstract forms all present such slivers, slits, cracks, fissures, tears, peelings or other openings that let the viewer experience them from within, or, even, look right through them into the vast empty sky. From her first Special drawing, Blue Lines (1916), to her last oil painting, The Beyond (1972), slits in nothingness - a vision from within and above, from far away and nearby - reveal the graphic approach and unspoken spiritual message of Georgia O'Keeffe."
