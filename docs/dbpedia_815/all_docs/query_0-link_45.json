Saratoga season is still a ques- tion mark. Inclement weather and shuttered casinos have brought sub-par attendance. Track is 2,000 off last year's preem session, and handle considerably lower. However, word has been passed along that the greenfelts are to open tomorrow night (Wed.) and that’s expected to hypo biz. Re-], sort’s attendance is generally be- low last year. Natives say maybe people are healthier or the war scare is keeping them near home- base. The major niteries hope to wind up with a healthy season. Piping Rock opened last night (Mon.) to a 75% house, Morton Downey and Frank Libuse topping. Riley’s Lake House, with a burley-style show, is near > capacity; Lilt St. Cyr at the Helm. The Brook, with ‘Gigi Durston, is way off. There’s no late business any- where. Cafe men expect late shows to develop when the season fully gets under way but at this point local businessmen are wear- ing the look of a bettor who lost eight straight races. Crowds are comparatively parsimonious, most hotels are below capacity, but prices compare with former years. There were times when Albany inns had a bonanza via the Saratoga overflow but no such condition prevails this year. Wise money says, the best ad this resort can have this year would be newspaper reports that wheels are not spinning. Word could be passed along to inter- ested parties later. Senate investi- gation may have frightened many prospective attendees, but it’s gen- erally axiomatic that no matter what, greenfelts will be running at Saratoga, whether okayed or sneak, Buddy De Sylva Biopic Hollywood, Aug. 1.

Pic Prod. •London, Aug, 1. A net deficit of upwards of $11,- 000,000 was estimated by Lord Archibald in a House of Lords de- bate as the cost of British produc- tion during 1949. There were 82 pictures made during the 12-month period at a total budget of approxi- mately $42,000,000. Box office revenue, after allow- ing for admission tax, approached $200,000,000, but British producers received only $20,000,000 as their share. Th&t meant a deficiency in the home market for British pro- duction of over $22,000,000. Gen- erous estimate of overseas earnings was around $11,000,000, which (Continued on page 47) . _ _ . it.. .... » .•„ ‘HOUSES’ TOUCHY TODAY, SO ANDERSON YANKS IT Fearing that it might be “misin- terpreted” in view of present world conditions, Maxwell Anderson has withdrawn his “Both Your Houses” from both professional and amateur performance. Playwright thought he had ^already withdrawn the, work, but learned that it was pre- sented last week at the Berkshire playhouse, Stockbridge, Mass., so he notified his agents of the nix : yesterday (Tues.). , Although the drama was the Pul- 1 itzer Prize-winner of the 1932-33 season, its militant liberal theme might be considered to have sub- versive connotations now. Ander- son figured. That possibility was apparently accentuated by the fact that, for last week’s strawhat pre- sentation, the script was revised here and there to give it a topical value. Whole matter was brought to the author’s attention by A friend who saw the Stockbridge showing. H’wood’s ‘What War?- Who Needs It?’ as Boom Brings Free-Spending Era By ABEL GREEN Hollywood, Aug. 1. Hollywood today is like this: ' ' ' * They’re not* as worried about television. Grosses are perking and seemingly the picture business is not going to resign from the world. Hollywood accepts with grim humor a. crack ascribed to 20th- Fox veepee A1 Lichtman, “As soon as the aircraft factories start work- ing three shifts, watch the return of great showmanship to Holly- wood.” Hollywood today sees hotels booming, almost like the war years; niteries and eateries doing better; people with money worry- ing more about inflation, hence spending now on such material things as building materiel on the theory that it’s a staple. The* Coast is still rather unsure about the war news; looks upon the Korean situation as (1) some- thing akin to a bad dream, and (2) who . needs it? Hollywood today is reveling more than ever in its swimming pools, sunshine, golf, bathing beaches, sunshine, tourists, God’s (Continued on page 47) Hollywood, Aug. 1. Fear that Hollywood’s support of the exhibitor fight against televi- sion may become a boomerang is beginning to haunt film execs. Film industry is afraid that theatre TV, heralded as the boxoffice answer to video, may attain such potency that it will relegate films to a minor consideration in exhibitor opera- tions. Should theatre TV become big as predicted, it’s felt, it may force films into a secondary spot in the- atres and put exhibitors in the driver’s seat in film rental deals, even, for the choicest product. Hollywood execs' attitude to the- atre TV was revealed in an in- formal gab-session on the subject here last week, participated in by William Perlberg, prez of the Screen Producers Guild; Oliver H. P. Garrett, ,exec of the Screen Writers Guild; Art Arthur, exec secretary of the Motion Picture In- dustry Council, and Nathan L. Halpern, theatre TV consultant to the Theatre Owners of America and other exhib organizations. Hal- pern, who headquarters in New j York, was ofi the Coast for a speech Friday (28) to the Southern California Theatre Owners Assn., in which he blasted Zenith Radio’s (Continued on page 6) ream New Faces With Vet Stars To Aid the B.O., Exhibitors Urge Jolson’s US0 Pic Hollywood, Aug. 1.

Webs Screening The four major networks have started the job of screening their personnel to determine the num- ber of eligibles that might be called up for military service. Those facing such calls include a number of key men holding re- . serve status, . such . as . Sylvester L. (Pat) Weaver, NBC’s top tele exec; his aide, Fred Wile; Dave Sutton, CBS’ tele sales exec, etc. Networks want to get some idea as to how they’ll shape up, man- power-wise, should the potential candidates for mobilization be grabbed off. Mickey Rooney lo Top 125G Medicine Show, Boxtops Admish Fee Chicago, Aug. 1. Hadocol, patent medicine con- cern, is picking up one of the big- gest talent tabs in recent years, to plug the home remedy. Gate fee will be a box top of its product. Over $125,000 will be paid out to Mickey Rooney, Connee Boswell, Roy Acuff, Minnie Pearl, Anita Martell, Sharkey’s Dixieland band and a host of clowns for 16-day arena tour of the south starting Aug. 21.

George Bernard Shaw, who was 94 last week, recently got off some cryptic observations on films and TV in a‘ note to Maurice Evans. Actor was interested in doing both “Devil’s Disciple” and “Man and Superman” in pix, and he wrote to GBS asking him whether the play- wright would be interested in sell- ing him the screen rights. Evans figured on doing the pic- tures after his tour next season in “Disciple.” Couple of years ago he did “Man and Superman” both in New York and on tour, and was anxious to star in that, too, in a picture. He wasn’t long in getting a reply from Shaw.. On a per- sonally-handwritten ha’penny^ post- card, GBS dispatched this reply to Evans: “Quite out of the question. The film rights to the -two plays would cost $160,1)00 to start with. Not your job. The film actor who speculates is lost; Films: don’t help plays. They kill them. So does television. Stick to the boards. Keep off the screen.” Major Hollywood studios may be doing the right thing by trying to groom new stars but they aren’t going about it in the righVway, ac- cording to many indie exhibitors. Few of the newcomers with star- dom potentialities yet have the marquee lure to carry a picture on their own, the*exTiibs claim. As a result, they think the studios Should return to the system once featured by Metro of always team- ing a youngster on the rise with an established star. Metro, as well as some of the other big studios, it’s recalled, orig- inally broke in their fledglings either in shorts or B films. Then when the* studio figured they had the necessary background and Ex- perience, they gave them a crack at a top A picture, but slotted them opposite an established player. Robert Taylor, for example, got his first Metro chevrons* in the old “Crime Doesn’t Pay” two-reelers, and both Lana Turner and Van Johnson broke in with the old “Dr. Kildare” series. Mickey Rooney, a member of the “Mickey Mc- Guire” shorts while a kid, gained his first prominence as the star of the “Hardy Family” series. Today the star aspirants are in that transitional phase but the ma- jors, either through lack of time to (Continued on page 53) SHUBERT ‘PASSING SHOW’ HAY BE VIDEO PACKAGE Georgie Price, vet of many Shu- bert revues, is talking with John Shubert to emcee and narrate a “Shuberts’ Passing Show” program for television.

I’ve never picked a Kentucky Derby winner, a maijQr league pen- nant race or an Army-Navy foot- ball game correctly in my life, but that doesn’t stop me from indulg- ing in America’s favorite hobby of making predictions about .almost anything. The trouble with predicting is that it puts the prognosticator out oh a limb. Many times these guys fall off on their face. But one of my inventions is a ^ limb that is shaped like Betty Grabie’S. Any- body who falls off of my inven- tion is just plain careless/ Armed with this invention, back in December of 1947, I went out on a limb with a list of 10 predic- tions about the future of television, in a letter I wrote to a Chicago ad- vertising agency.

Salzburg’s 30th annual Festival of Music and Drama is about to swing intQ gear With opening per- formance of Mozart’s “Don Gio- vanni” with star-studded Vienna Opera cast led by Willem Fuert- wangler. Town is already count- ing up what it believes Will be top tourist take of all time, exceeding even Austria’s previous banner year of 1938. Hotels have been sold solid for miles arourid. Tickets for gll events have been “unavailable” since a . few hours after boxoffices opened in May. It’s Well-known, however, that scal- pers have plenty of ducats for latecomers at; prices ranging from twice to five times the b.ov figure, depending on whether it’s “Don Giovanni” with Ljuba Welitsch and Tito Gobbi; a Yehudi Menuhin concert with the Vienna Philhar- monic (the two top draws) or a chamber music serenade (low on the musical totem pole). The tra- ditional open air “jederman,” as originated by Max Reinhardt in the Cathedral Square, and Oscar KarlweiS' in an Ernst Lothar pro- duction of “The Spendthrift,” by Raimund, are top . dramatic num- bers on the 1950 menu. Town has just gone^through big- gest orgy of repairing, rebuilding and cleaning up since war’s end. EC A dough has been poured into much of this* especially hotel re- habilitation. Scaffolding is still coming down as the streets begin to fill up with license plates from Belgium, Sweden, England, Cali- fornia and Switzerland. Lots of U.

Rushed Into Par Release Paramount is now editing and will rush into early release a one- hour film which, tells the Stories of three Medal of Honor winners and their exploits in the Italian cam- paign of the last war. Par is speed- ing release because of the awak- ened public interest in miltary mat- ters stemming from the Korean crisis. Pic, made in the east with A. J. Richard, head of its newsreel company, as producer, had been planned, however, before the North Koreans went below the 38th par- allel. Large amount of footage for the film came from the U. S. Army’s archives. Balance of pic is derived from Paramount newsreel clips, with footage from both woven to- gether to make a sustained Story, By concentrating on three medal winners, Par execs 'hope to avoid the episodic nature of newsreel compilations. Quentin Reynolds has done the commentary in the film: Pic, which has yet to be given a title, includes in its footage a followup of what became of each medal winner in civilian /life following “the war. Italian campaign, was chosen, it is said, because it is considered the toughest in the European- theatre. WAR SCARE BOOMS U.S. AND LATIN The “one man’s loss is another’s gain” axiom is being vividly dram- Skoal! atized in the current American and Latin-Aiherican tourism. The war has dented Europe, sent Florida booming to a new summer peak, and the fashionable hostelries in Arizona and Southern California now are snarled for accommoda- tions. The management of the Waldorf-Astoria knows of several bridal couples Who were almost lit- erally snatched off deluxe ocean liners arid shipped off for Florida, Puerto Rico, Mexican or Cali- fornian honeymoons instead by doting parents. The airlines are largely credited ! for the Florida boom because of | their excellent campaigns on .cut- l rate passage, package deals, etc. Schoolteachers, clergy and kindred wliite-collar patronage from the Carolinas and Georgia traditionally look advantage of Tlorfda’s Hiovv summer rates* but the war has sent the northerners south in a manner which may finally realize Florida’s hope of becoming 8 summer resort; as well as a winter haven* akin to what has, been happening to the Riviera. Washington, Aug. 1. U, S. Defense Dept, set a far- reaching precedent this week when it nixed a request by the five news- reel companies for release dates on film footage turned over to tlie reels arid television stations. This footage is shot by the Army Signal Corps In Korea and pooled for use by all media* Decision gives the TV field a decided advantage over the reels, 1 since they can rush the clips for early telecasting while the ' reels are bound by semi-weekly* Issue dates. Question never came up before because TV was only in its infancy during the last War, when the reels were customarily supplied with Signal Corps celluloid. Defense Dept, officials in denying the reels* request for specific release dates take the position that news should not be held up but rushed to the public at the earliest possible date* Execs of the five reels have .al- ready decided to cut down on the use of Signal Corps stuff in view of the adverse ruling. They will depend on tfieir own exclusive foot- age and ; are planning to up the number of newsreel cameramen assigned to the Korean front. , In asking for an even news break with video, the reels . claimed that it would insure the widest possible use of the footage, since it is inevi- table that \"the theatres Would cut down on clips which have played on local tele stations several days before. Previously, TV stations had re- quested the newsreel companies for servicing of sequences shot by reel cameramen in Korea. This request was promptly rejected by the reels. Video is sending its own camera- men to the Far East in addition to its being supplied by the Army, Rattle came into the forefront last week, when the five reels each sent Wires to their Washing-: ton reps instructing them .to peti- tion the Defense Dept, for set re- lease dates. The reps thereupon contended With Government offi- cials that the practice of setting no release dates was ^‘sloppy,” They asked for Wednesday release for Monday malceup and Saturdays for Thursday makeup. Signal Corps has been supplying reels and video with 3,000-4,000 feet weekly. The reels, however, have been using far' more of their own stuff than of official Govern- ment clips. y- ■ Hollywood, Aug. 1.

Indie producer Kramer has had numerous deals tossed at him, and as far as can be learned, has listened to all, but signed with no one. Who is associated with Green in the efforts to gain control of the production-distribution setup has not been revealed. Reports are thalf it may be N.

Revolutionary concept for giv- ing producers, writersK directors and’ actors a' tax break 1st behind the plan of Jerry Wald and Nor-, man Krasna in setting up their own indie unit currently. They aim to detour the old capital gains pitfall in favor of a royalty ar- rangement by which creative work- ers in other fields get a tax advan- tage. Wald sees in the new plan a tremendous hypo for indie and semi-indie pic-making. With the break it gives Holly woodites suf- fering under a top tax load, he sees another influx into ' the indie field, such as was experienced at the close of the last war when de- ferments and capital gains be- came tremendously popular. f Such a move would give a fur- ther spurt to Holly wood’s already growing v trend toward semi- autonomous units at most studios, Wald-Krasna deal how being nego- tiated with RKO is on that basis, and there are flocks , of similar ar- rangements at RKO, Paramount, Warner Bros., Columbia, Republic and Monogram. Capital gains setups still exist, but have been waning for several reasons. First has been the de- cline in biz, which has taken as- surances of profits Out o£ indie filmmaking.

Judge Jayne of the Jersey superior, court has ordered a splitup of the part- tier ties* Decision comes after a string of court battles. It repre- sents a victory for RKO since the company started the suit after fruitless dickerings. While the need for a partner breakup is based on the RKO anti- trust consent decree, which , re- quires an end to all joint theatre holdings, Judge Jayne’s ruling is actually founded ori a finding that management has been “paralyzed” Iby the failure of Reade and RKO to get along, in running the 12- theatre chain. With both sides each: owning 50% of the stock, stalemate has followed stalemate in steering ' the circuit, opinion pointed out. Their partnership, court said, \"was born in an environment of re- sentment.” To back this, opinion cites colorful testimony of Reade, Who maintained throughout the trial that RKO picked up the 50% •lice for a bauble because E. F. Albee, then head of RKO, forced the transaction through a threat to bar his vaude acts from the the- atres. At that time, vaude was the big attraction, pix merely fillers. Reade was eloquent in relating his troubles getting along with RKO in excerpts cited in the opin- ion. At one point, he testified on RKO, which operated the theatres: \"They had a new member of the board every Friday. They had a new general manager evei’y Mon- day. They had during the regime of 1931-1943 about 50 executives by name. If you would give me .time, I will tell them to you.” At another point.

Ownership of the pic, “Johfiny Holiday,” released by United Artists, has reportedly been taken over by the Kansas Milling Co., which advanced Alcorn the production coin. “Holiday” is , expected to repre- sent a loss of possibly $600,000. In release for about six months, it has played off slowly and has 3,500 contracts sold for. an estimated gross of $225,000. On that basis it is expected to do a top of $600,- 000 total domestic gross. Out of that comes UA’s distribution fee of WBV Buy-Ups Warner Bros, has suddenly renewed its program of buying up its own common stock, on the open . market as a way of reducing the company’s out- standing shares. From June 26, July 31, Warners picked up 225,600 shares at a cost of $2,- 792,355. Purchases bring the total of outstanding stocks to a reduced figure of 7;070,000 sharers. . Only other major to have embarked on a similar policy is Paramount, which has stead- ily reduced its issued shares by buy-iips during the past three months. Warners gives no reason for renewing the policy dropped several years ago.

Counterclaim to this complaint by Skouras seeks dismissal of the Joelson action be- sides money damages and an in- junction against the four majors. Court battle revolves about the Crotona and Park Plaza theatres, both Bronx Skouras houses, which are in competition with Joelson's Luxor theatre. Skouras claims that RKO conspired with Warners ■■•to. deprive the hjpuses of their first- run nabe status. Warners is ac- cused of using illegal pressure on 20th to go along. Since 1921, counterclaim asserts, Crotona and Park Plaza, have had first-runs in the area. In Decem- ber, 1948,. they were relegated be- hind Joelson’s Luxor because of the alleged conspiracy. Now Skou- ras wants an injunction barring Joelson from seeking any better run and clearance than seven days behind the Park Plaza. Skouras and RKO fought a pro- longed battle over division of their partnership holdings in six Bronx houses. That fight finally ended in a compromise in which an out- side appraiser was brought in. SEN JOHNSON AGAIN sales, is now reporting directly to Kansas Milling. Washington, Aug. 1. Chairman Edwin C. Johnson (D., Colo.) of the Senate Commerce Committee went after Roberto Ros- sellini again last week, this time with a resolution which- would bar any pictures produced by the Ital- ian film director from being dis- tributed in this .country. The resolution expressed “the sense of the Senate that motion pictures which h^ve been produced or directed by persons who U) were active members of the Italian Fas- cist Party or the German Nazi Party, at any time during the pe- riod in which the U. S. was at war with Italy or Germany, respective- ly; or (2) are known to have col- laborated with German S. S. troops, in Germany or Italy at any time subsequent to Dec. 11, 1941, and prior to May 8, 1945, should not be transported in interstate com- merce in the U.

PENTAGON BRASS STUDY KOREAN COMBAT REELS Washington, Aug. 1. , Pentagon high brass is analyzing the military situation in Korea through pictures made by combat cameramen of the . Armed Forces. Much of the footage is offered by Defense Dept, to newsreels and TV stations. Film taken at the Korean front is being flown to the Signal Corps Photographic Center; Long Island City, N. Y., for processing and as- sembling into a Staff Film Report of the Armed Forces for military use only. The finished product is turned over to top-level officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. ,A similar series of Staff Film Reports, made by Signal Corps Army Pictorial Service, contribut- ed to military planning during World War II. The current report is a unified project of all the serv- ices, designed to expedite informa- tion to top-level planners. All pho- tograph services are consolidated under the unification of military agencies. Meanwhile, Army Signal Corps has initiated action to organize a limited number of skilled photo- graphic cameramen into units com- prising one officer cameraman, two enlisted still cameramen and two enlisted m.p. cameramen. These units will be equipped and trained for immediate dispatch to augment Signal Corps cameramen in the field. Buoyancy of film profits in the face of still-sliding gross revenues in the industry is spotlighted again in the nine-month financial report of Warner Bros., turned loose this week. Warners airs a net take of $7,316,000 for the three-quarter vnark, eiid'ed May 27, a whisper lower than $7,363,000 netted by the company in the comparative period of 1949. The take held firm although Warners’ gross dived to $94,504,000 in the current semester against $101,242,000 amassed in three-quarters of ’49. Other film companies have been showing up with similar fiscal re- ports. While the mid-year state- ments offer no explanation for this fact which has been peculiar to the ’50 stretch, the strength of net totals is generally credited to tightened studio , costs. It is understood that the economies of two years ago and more which have been bul- warked in the past 12 months are progressively showing up in the (Continued on page 18) Dietrich Heads Sate Re-Elected at RKO In the first meeting of the RKO board following its renaming by the Company’s stockholders in Dover, Del., all officers of the parent company were elected for another year.

Earnings are equivalent to $1.07 per share on outstanding common against $1.25 last year. Second quarter is down from both the first quarter of this year and the .second stanza of last year. Three reasons for the slide are listed by Dr. Herbert T. Kalmus, Techni prez. Interference with plant operations due to the conver- sion to acetate (non-flam) stock is one cause. Reduction of prices of V 2 C. per foot on certain prints also bit into profits. Speedup of cer- tain machines which will ultimate- ly increase output helped account for the dip. # N. Y. to L. A.

Whatever the change in arrangements may be, MacMillen stressed that he will not consent to upping the share of distribution fees paid over to Kaufman. ELC prez describes the handling of FC product, none of which is new, as “tail-end selling” on which his compapy cannot afford to reduce its fees by forking over a bigger share to the FC assignee. Only 11 films are now left of the group turned over to ELC by FC, it is indicated. Many of the pro- ducers have pulled out -their pix because of the merger impasse.

While MaclVtillen carefully avoids mentioning United Artists, it is evident that a number of producers who heretofore released their prod- uct through \\UA are now eyeing ELC as a possible outlet. MacMil- icn speaks With considerable satis- faction of Aome of the deals which he closed on his latest Wester it trek. In tying up with several producers, his company has been aided by a $1 ,200,000 Syndicate fund used for bankrolling pix. “We’ve come from nowhere in the past year since the Edward Small deal fell through,” MacMil- len said. “The record of the past year justifies our optimism.” ELC chief Was referring to negotiations for the partial takeover of the company by Small which ended in a stalemate. “At tfiat time, we would get a film on Monday and set it for re- lease on Tuesday,” he .. added, “There was a time, not so long ago, when we had exactly two pictures for release; ’Trapped’ and ’Port of N e.W York/ Our situation is so improved that we can hold up a Robert Montgomery film (“Eye Witness”! for three months and a (Continued on page 22) ELC to Operate Although the merger of Lion with Film Classics now looks to be a goner, Eagle Lion Classics will continue to operate in place, of the old EL unit.

Failure of the merger results in Pathe owning 100% of ELC’s put- standing stock.

De- cision to repeat the meets on a re- gional basis was made for both economy and efficiency reasons., By holding a confab in each di- vision headquarters, 20th has found it can save considerable money. Field sales staffers, in- stead of traveling from all parts of the country to a central point, travel only to the city in their ter- ritory, with several execs going out from the homeoffice to address the meets. By holding a series of re- gional meets, moreover, 20th has found it can take time to discuss local problems, which it would be impossible to do if it had one big national meet. Six meets this week are pat- terned after the central division convention held last week in Chi- cago. Speech on upcoming prod- uct made at the Chi meet by sales Veepee Andy W.

Eagle Lion will cut the overhead losses of its shuttered studio by renting stages to indie producers but will make no immediate entry into production itself, William C. MacMillen, EL’s prez, said this week on his return from the Coast. Ultimately his company may, go back into filmmaking if it piles up enough ready cash to do the job right. It will not be hurried into this course merely because it has an idle lot. Partial reopening of the studio was arranged by EL’s topper white on the Coast. He rented space for two days to Irving Allen for pro- duction of a three-reeler on the story of Gilbert & Sullivan, jack Schwartz, indie filmmaker who re- leases through EL, is also taking over stage facilities for at least one pic. MacMillen estimates that his company will take a net rental of $40,000 or thereabouts by reason of these two rentals. However, his company will still bear a loss for the year because the overhead is substantial. His understanding with Schwartz is that EL need hire no (Continued on page 16) Slip in grosses during the past few years, resulting in hard times for indie producers, is reflected currently in the economic' pressure being experienced by independent distribs.

Other indications Of the strain- ing for. economy were* clear in the recent effort at a merger by Eagle Lion and Film Classics arid a simi- lar attempt by Monogram and Lip^ pert Productions. Neither melding was consummated, but the attempts point clearly to the necessity of paring distribution overhead to a minimum to keep heads above water.'

The Bing Crosby-Hopalong Cas- sidy film, “Partners,” has , been shelved at Paramount due to diffi- culties with story fine. Studio has moved up “You Belong to Me,” originally slated to follow “Part- ne i'S,” as Bing Crosby starrer, to fin October start., Shelving is tem- porary. “Belong” is art original by Rob- Ji't Riskin, with screenplay by Charles Hoffman, New attempt ito bolster the box- office through a form of “legalized bingo” was kicked off by Skouras Theatres last week in one . of its houses in Bound Brook, N. J. Idea is an audience participation contest currently being aired over television stations in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, in which theatre patrons can win cash prizes by giving correct answers to ques- tions. Titled “Telephone Game” on TV , the idea is owned by indie program producer Harry Goodman, who sold it on an exclusive basis for theatres to the Skourag chain. Similar to bingo, the game has customers using numbered cards. If they can answer a question correctly, they fill in a space under the num- ber called. Then the first one to have all the spaces filled wins. Theatre management is putting up $100 per week. Winner each week gets $5 and then comes back at the end of six weeks for a chance at the jackpot, which will total the $600 minus the amount previously paid out. According to Goodman, the game, involves no element of chance, and so cannot be legally construed as a lottery. Selznick Releasing Organization for the second time within the past few years is in the process of dis- pensing With most of its staff. Among those leaving SRO are Mannie Reiner, who was to head a new department for distribution in the U.

Selznick is pulling in his horns on all distribution activity and will maintain, only a skeleton organiza- tion.

War Embarr&ssnieiit Changed theatre prospects caused by the Korean* war comes at a time when it may. embarrass efforts of the. Big Five to unsnarl their theatre partnerships -as required by the Government anti-trust de cree. Because wartime generally spells a boost in theatre revenues, the possibility of increased profits is believed likely to make both sides eager to hold on to theatres. In the past few years the majors' main difficulty was this inclination by pards to cling to their houses* hence the hurdle is raised further. Another obstacle which is expect- ed to prove embarrassing is the increased uncertainty which way theatre profits will go, depending as it does on world events. This is likely to hamper negotiations which Are haw a must. ^ . Division of opinion has now- cropped up iri Paramount’s board of directors on whether the com- pany should abandon its plan to unload its extensive holdings . in DuMont Television. One faction is currently pitching for the major to stay in the DuMont; operation and to extend its participation, and possibly its hoidngS; in the TV out- fit. That opinion is being furthered by the expectation of large Gov- ernment war orders for tele sets which would insure DuMont of steady profits for the next few years. Because the price of DuMont stock on the iriarket has fallen along with other TV shares since the Korean crisis, Par has tabled its plan of trading its DuMont shares with its own stockholders. DuMont stocj^ is selling in the neighborhood of 16. Price is not regarded by Par’s directors as right for an exchange whereby a stockholder would tiirn in Para- mount common arid in return re- ceive DuMont shares held by the filin company.

Most insiders are of the opinion that the sessions may result in an- nouncement of plans for the fu- ture, but that it is unlikely that there will be any revelation of backers. Belief has been growing .both in New York and on the Coast that the shape of the deal is considerably different than that supposed arid that little or no money has changed hands. According to UA insiders in a position to know, there has been no evidence as yet of new operating coin having been made available. Such funds are virtually a neces- sity,, since UA’s rental take last week was only around $250,000 (after & comparatively good $280,^ 000 the week before), giving it a net in distribution fees of about $70,000. Operating costs run around $85,000. ; Trade opinion is that while Miss Pickford and Charles Chaplin may have trusted their stock in UA to McNutt, they are by no means out of the picture.

Fresh from huddles with the Rank Organization, indie producer Alexander Paal returned to New York last week after three weeks in Europe. While in Britain he conferred with Rank’s production chief, Earl St. John, on an Anglo- American filmmaking deal. As a result of the . discussions either “Goodbye U.S.A.,” a George Tabori yarn, or another Tabori script with an Egyptian locale may go before the cameras. ; Trekking to the continent, Paal talked over a picture venture with Real Film of Hamburg and also visited Zurich to meet Mme.

Written by Geza Herczeg, the story will be lensed in Anscocolor. Paal, who holds the film rights to Nijinsky’s life, disclosed that Mme.

Secondly, the Treasury Dept, has frowned on some of the capital gains setups, clairriing the partici- pants were not bona fide share- holders in a film, but were using, the arrangement strictly as a tax dodge. Some of them, such as Groucho Marx and Frank Ross, have been forced to pay up on such deals at regular income tax rates rather than the* 25% capital gains tax. Marx got clipped on. “Night in Casablanca,” while Ross got; hit with “Devil and Miss Jones,”’ Wald and Krasna have been as- sured by their attorneys that the royalty plan is not only perfectly acceptable legally, but that it is based on a well-established prin- ciple in book and music publishing. W-K are represented by Pacht, Tannenbaum & Ross. Wald calls it “the ASCAP plan for Hollywood,” borrowing the tag from the Ameri- can Society of Composers, Authors & Publishers. Plan provides that the partici- pants draw a nominal salary for their work. Which is in the nature of an advance by a book publisher to an author. The advance is against future royalties, but if the royalties prove insufficient to cover it, it does not constitute a debt by the author to the pub- lisher, Similarly, the nominal salaries Distributors releasing A films for national telecasting over the Phonevision system can expect an average film, rental of no more than $250,000, Halpern said. Even “under the most favorable condi- tions, it is doubtful that Phone- vision would bring Hollywood film rentals exceeding • $500,000 for its few top films, as compared with $4,000,000 to $5,000,000 for such films from theatres,” he told the exhibs. Phonevision Y ardstick Phonevision figures Were arrived at by Halpern after research based on the assumption of a nationwide Phonevision operation in all areas where there are now stations or applications for stations, and gives the system 100% saturation in set ownership. Yardstick used to ar- rive at the- potential viewing audi- ence was the same as used in radio, which has about 40% of sets turned on at the peak listening time. He made a strong pitch for the- atre TV, predicting a nationwide hookup able to bring Broadway first nights, national sports events, special TV productions and other outstanding entertainment to the- atres all over the country, One fence to be hurdled when this takes place is state and local cen- sorship and the variance between what is permitted on the legitimate stage And in a film theatre. Hal- pern wasn’t pessimistic, however, believing that when the problem is tests were originally required, to • j onst ration will probably be held tomorrow (ThurS.) or Friday. Under previously announced 20th plans, which presumably are still in effect* the company will or- der units to equip 22 Fox- West Coast houses if the . demonstration proves successful. Before those are installed, 20th must devise some riiethod of linking the houses. It is considered doubtful whether the Federal Communications Com- mission will act in time to provide 20th, along with the rest of the film industry* with exclusive the- atre video channels. If so, 20th reportedly will put in a bid to American Telephone & Teflegraph to lease special cables to carry the TV signals from the . point of ori- gin to the 22 houses.

In a report to members, Herman M t Levy, TOA -general counsel, urged exhibs to “proceed with caution.” Levy reported the result of a recent decision of the supreme court of Minnesota, declaring legal a bank night system in Albert Lea, Minn. Basis of the decision was the fact that participants in the bank nights were not required to buy tickets or appear in the the- atre to participate, or to buy tickets to claim their prizes. Minnesota state law declares il- legal any . “scheme for the dis- tribution of property by chance among person* who have paid; or agree to pay, a Valuable considera- tion for the chance.” Court ruling flatly stated the Albert Lea opera- tion did not fall under this defi- nition. . While terming the decision “a very favorable one” for Minnesota exhibitors, Levy warned that it is not “a blanket license for exhibi- tors to operate bank night in other states.” He declared that if ex- hibitors wish to operate bank nights in other state*, they must be prepared to show similarity of laws to the Minnesota law and similarity of operation to the Al- bert Lea system. While\" warning that other state courts might not follow the Minne- sota decision, he said that similar- ity of laws and operation “would certainly warrant affirmative ac- tion on the part of those exhibitors who wish to install bank night.” GUT Mgrs.

Indie operators, who met. here last week for Confabs pre- liminary to the National Allied States Assn, convention, assailed the distribs for “Cushioning them- selves against the shock of the cur- rent business decline by increasing domestic film rentals.” , Boxoffice receipts, ■ the exhib leaders point out* have declined nearly one-third in the last three months over a corresponding pe- riod a year ago. Grinieff Sties Banks Estate Los Angeles, Aug. 1. Jacques Grinieff, foreign film distributor, filed Suit here against the estate of the late Monty Banks for $13,695.

Bulk of the estate of Rex Ingram, Who died July 21, goes to his widow, Alice Terry, former film star, under his will filed here for probate and disposing of more than $200,000 in cash and real: estate. Half the estate is inherited put- right and the rest forms a trust fund from which the widow will draw the income for life. 0 Hollywood, Aug. 1. Production costs on Metro's 1949- 59 schedule have been reduced ap- proximately 20%, while the num- ber of pictures has been increased to 43, a gain of 14 oyer the pre- vious season’s program. This con- dition is the result of Dore Schary’s dictum, announced a year ago— more pictures and more economy in filming. Production huddles on the Para- mount lot, instituted since , the exiting of Henry Ginsberg as stu- dio chief, has resulted in a decision to boost the lot’s annual film out- put to 30 yearly. The upped pace will become effective in October and carry through for the next 12 months. Production boost repre- sents a 50% hoist in output, since the company has been averaging 20 films yearly since the war. Another significant change has followed the Ginsberg resignation. Samuel Briskin, production exec who came to Paramount along with William Wyler, Frank Capra and ! George Stevens When Par ab- sorbed Liberty Films, is playing a big part in laying out the studio’s new production blueprint. Next to Y. Frank Freeman, named to suc- ceed Ginsberg, Briskin has become second in command. Heretofore, Briskin has been in- active in top strategy councils on the Par lot. Currently, he is in close daily huddles with Freeman. Nonetheless, Par may yet take on a production exec Who would work under Freeman. IJnderstood it is ready to ticket One “if the right man comes along.” Significant boost in Par and M-G prod is intended to cut the studios’ big per-picture overhead charges. At the same time, it would keep the. sales force operating on a bet- ter rounded schedule. Frequently in the past, distrib end has found itself short on new product. Metro will continue to make costly productions, Tike “Quo Va- dis T ” fr om time to time, but Js rounding up stories capable of be- ing filmed on limited time sched- ules and on budgets less than $500,- 000 . Another B-K House, Garrick, in Folderoo (Chicago, Aug, 1. Balaban & Katz circuit, which several years ago lost dominance over Loop exhibition, will lose an- other house When the 900* : seat Gar- rick shutters within the next two Weeks. With sister house, Apollo, torn down, the present action leaves the circuit with a scant three Loop houses and only half-interest in a fourth. Garrick, which had been on a reissue policy for over a year, has been .the weakest link in the cir- cuit’s downtown chain. Loss of downtown dominance left the small house floundering. Previous to that, while showing A and B quality picts It had been a potent draw for the circuit. Passing of the Garrick, accord- ing to B & K officials, is attributed to an unfruitful search for suitable first-run product. Dearth of new story material which has been troubling studies ever since the end of the war has been more protracted than at any previous time in film, history, ac- cording to vet story editors. As a result, a number of companies are attempting to generate screen originals by name and semi-name writers, rather than just sitting by as they used to, waiting for : ma- terial to pour in. Being sought particularly by ma- jor lots are homey, little American stories. There are a number of reasohs for this, but prime is the fact that pix on such themes have been outstandingly successful re- cently (“Cheaper by the Dozen,” “Ma and Pa Kettle,” “Father of the Bride”), and so the studios have been given the idea that’s what the public: wants. Second reason is that such yarns have an added value in their time- lessness. They have no political, economic or wartime overtones, so there’s no chance they’ll be out- moded by current, fast-moving events. Also, since they generally use Simple sets and costumes and lend themselves to use 1 of young and unknown players, they are economical to make. Big problem so far as the story eds are Concerned is that most of the published magazine and hook material along this line has insuf- ficient plot. It’s usually nothing but a few incidents and It takes quite a bit of expensive writing at the studio to turn the material into a screenplay. -Likewise there’s a complaint that too much of the published family -type story is overly contrived. 20th-Fox’s eastern story ed, Bert Bloch, has been a leader in efforts (Continued on page 20) To Delay Wallis Pic To Wind -Brave Bulls’ Los Angeles, Aug; 1. gobert Rossen won a legal de- cision over Hal Wallis in superior court, where Wallis had asked Judge William B. McKesson to order Rossen to start work im- mediately on the scripting Of “Sound of Years,” under a contract signed last year. Currently Rossen is working on his Own production, “The- Brave Bulls,” for Columbia release.
