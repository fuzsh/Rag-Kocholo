        "text": "For more than a century this fine old brick house on the North side of Basin Street, not far from the historic Brownville Hotel, has been in possession of the historic Skinner family. It will be recalled that in 1814 there came to Brownville Alanson Skinner, native of Westmoreland, New Hampshire, born May 21 1794, son of Mr and Mrs Timothy Skinner. At Brownville he became a partner of Colonel William Lord in the firm of Lord & Skinner, operators of a foundry and machine shop where they made plows, stoves and other implements of iron and steel.\n\nA little later Mr Skinner headed his own firm of Skinner & Davis. This gave way to A Skinner & Sons, one of whom, Horace Skinner, became the title figure in the succeeding firm of H Skinner & Brothers.\n\nAlanson Skinner, General Jacob Brown and Colonel William Lord were three of the ace pioneer settlers of Brownville. Mr Skinner was married to Miss Mary Woodward September 29 1819. Their son, Horace, was born September 27 1820. Their later children were Mary who married Reverend Luther Rice; James who became a resident of Aurora, IL, and William I Skinner of Brownville. Alanson Skinner was village trustee from 1832 to 1819; town supervisor in 1839 1840 and 1846. In 1836 he was village president and in 1850-1851 he was state senator. In the National Union bank of Watertown he was a large stockholder and several years president. He died June 7 1876.\n\nThe county records show that on May 12 1847 Thomas Y and Mary How sold Horace Skinner one-half the deep garden lot of Hoel Lawrence on the north side of Basin Street for $250. That deed states that the lot was between the Colonel William Lord lot, upon which was the dwelling of Gilderoy Lord, and the Brownville Hotel garden lot. It is more than likely that Horace Skinner, whose wife was the former Miss Harriet Emory, built this substantial eleven-room brick house on the lot that same year. Horace Skinner died October 3 1894 leaving an estate of over $42,000 which included 31 shares of National Union bank stock, $8,000 of Remington Paper company bonds, $2,000 of St Lawrence Paper company bonds and $500 of Watertown Paper company bonds. He willed all of his personal property to his wife and gave her a life-use of the rest, which was to go to their two sons, Cyrus A and Frank W, after her death. Frank W Skinner was named executor.\n\nFrank W Skinner, civil engineer, was graduated from Cornell university in 1879 and became one of the nation's noted men in his profession. He was a consulting engineer on the George Washington bridge. For many years he was associate editor of The Engineering Record and its editor from 1914 to 1916. Also for a number of years he lectured at Harvard, Yale, Brown, Wisconsin, McGill and other universities. His wife was the former Rachel A Sumner.\n\nOn December 25 1932 he died at 74. A son, Alanson B, was a prominent enthnologist.\n\nCyrus A Skinner, born December 7 1865 at Brownville, married Miss Allie May Ingalls of Pillar Point, and for many years was inspector of the Bethlehem Steel company and the Carnegie Steel company. Their sons were Horace M, Rollin I and Ralph E, the latter of whom became secretary of the Harmon Paper company at Brownville, and father of the present owner of this house, Warren I Skinner.\n\nOn June 1 1911 Frank W Skinner conveyed the property as executor of Horace and trustee of Cyrus to the Northern New York Trust company, which, as trustee of Cyrus conveyed it to Rollin I Skinner January 7 1944. On October 30 1946 Rollin I Skinner, Carthage, deeded it to Warren Ingalls Skinner and wife, Martha Kelly Skinner. Warren Ingalls Skinner served in the U S Navy in World War II, is a mechanic for the Ryan Plumbing & Heating company and was married to Miss Martha Patricia Kelly, daughter of Mr and Mrs James J Kelly, 117 Phelps Street, November 28 1943.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nIt was a century ago this coming summer that a tall, slender, brown-haired U S Army officer of 27 suddenly appeared in the beautiful little village of Henderson. He was of quiet, retiring mein, religious in temperament, a stickler for duty and unswerving in the performance of it. Five years before he had been graduated from West Point with George B McClellan and immediately catapulted into the Mexican war's siege of Vera CruZ\n\nNow, in this year of 1851 he was a major and had just been appointed professor of natural and experimental philosophy and artillery tactics at Virginia Military Institute. Suffering from dyspepsia he had come to Henderson for treatment by Dr Lowrey Barney, whom he had but recently met in New York City, and of whom he was to be a six weeks' guest in this Georgian Barney house, daily quaffing buttermilk and eating brown bread in the regimen of the \"cure.\"\n\nThis officer was Major Thomas Jonathan Jackson, born January 21 1824 at Clarksburg, VA, destined a decade after his Henderson visit to become a major general in Confederate army and, while stoically and determinedly rallying his troops when things were going badly in the Civil war's first battle of Bull Run, being pointed to by General Bernard Bee who remarked: \"Look at Jackson, standing like a stone wall.\" Thus he was dubbed \"Stonewall' Jackson, and though he died from mortal wounds suffered in the battle of Chancellorsville he was already one of the. world's immortals.\n\nBut Dr Barney's treatment in 1851 was effective and such a warm friendship sprung up between the two men that Jackson came north during a number of ensuing summer vacations. Native of Rhode Island, Dr Barney was born in 1793 son of Dr Daniel and Abigail Bucklin Barney. Dr Daniel Barney, born at Swansea, Massachusetts, July 2 1768 brought his wife and infant son, Lowrey, to Little Falls in 1791. In 1802 Dr Daniel Barney became one of the earliest physicians in the town of Rutland, but the next year removed to Adams and April 7 1807 transferred to Henderson. In Watertown he became one of the founders of the Jefferson County Medical society December 17 1806 and was at that time made its vice president. He died May 19 1828 prominent as both citizen and physician.\n\nEven more so were his sons, Lowrey and Hiram. In 1811 Lodowick Salisbury had established the first store in Henderson. The next year Lowrey became a clerk there. Later Lowrey studied medicine with his father and December 15 1820 was given a medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons. From Fairfield Medical college he received a similar degree January 6 1823.\n\nIn 1821 Dr Lowrey Barney married Almira Spencer who died in 1838 and one of their children was Marie Louise Barney who at 16 married a Dr Shew, moved to New York to reside at 47 Bond Street and befriend the famous poet-mystery story author, Edgar Allen Poe and his child bride. It was at the suggestion of Mrs Shew and in her home that Poe wrote \"The Bells,\" and after Poe's death October 7 1849 some of his furniture and bric-a-brac acquired by Mrs Shew came to the Barney homestead in Henderson.\n\nThis homestead was built for Dr Barney in 1827-8 he having purchased the one-acre site on the north side of Henderson's Main Street and high above the roadway from Francis Wolley August 13 1827 for $65. In his will, executed August 11 1880 and recorded March 31 1885 Dr Barney having died December 17 1884 specifically gave this house to his daughter, Elva Phaethusa Barney, born May 17 1849 daughter of his second wife, Pamelia Farrell Barney.\n\nAmid the beautiful Barney and Poe antiques Miss Elva Barney lived in the old house until her death, February 18 1937 aged 87 but on June 7 1907 she deeded the property to her niece, Mary Sawyer Houghton, who later married Floyd C Overton of Adams. Mrs Overton was a daughter of the former Mrs Shew who had become the wife of Dr Boland S Houghton after the death of Dr Shew. At the age of 80 Mrs Overton died July 13 1942 and on the ensuing December 28 Rufus W Ripley as her executor, conveyed the old Barney homestead to E June Scott, who in turn transferred it to Edward and Joyce Stuckey on July 12 1947.\n\nLast July 1 Mr and Mrs Stuckey sold the property to Victor A Scott, Henderson garage and service station proprietor, Mrs Bessie E Scott taking joint title with her husband. It is regrettable that in repairing the house Mr Scott removed the kitchen at the rear with its fine fireplace and old Dutch oven.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nUnoccupied for more than a decade this large and rambling 20-room farm house, scene of much social splendor in the Civil war era, is rapidly going to ruin. Into its much faded but once colorful history there is an intriguing thread of mystery. The big framed portrait of Stephen A Douglas, the \"Little Giant\" and Democratic opponent of Abraham Lincoln, that hangs upon the mouldering walls of the broad central hall, types the politics of Hiram Wellington Kilborn, farmer and business man of onetime considerable wealth, said to have built this big, squarish mansion more than a century ago.\n\nThere are still those who recall the tradition of the grand parties of the Hiram Kilborn family which brought stately carriages bearing a couple of scores of the elite of Watertown and were hauled by some of the finest horseflesh in the county. And there are still some who remember when Fred N Kilborn, son of Hiram W and Olive White Kilborn, bred fast trotters by his stallion Deceive and worked them out on his own half-mile track upon the farm.\n\nHiram W Kilborn, who died upwards of half a century ago and is buried in Riverside cemetery at Copenhagen, was descended from Thomas Kilborn, native of Wood Ditton, England, who emigrated to New England in 1635 and settled at Wethersfield, Connecticut. Hiram was the son of Allen and Rhoda Canfield Kilborn, and a sister of Hiram was Nancy, who became the first wife of Edward Swain Massey, who built the stone house which stood where today is the residence of Roswell F Taylor on South Massey Street in this city.\n\nOn December 11 1895 Hiram W and Olive White Kilborn deeded the four parcels that make up the present farm to their sons, Fred N and George D Kilborn. The fortune which Hiram W Kilborn is reputed to have made here and in New York had by then sadly shrunk. Fred N Kilborn continued to reside on and operate this farm, raising fast horses, while his brother, George Darius, mine-owner and metalurgist, became a millionaire in Colorado.\n\nA year before he died on September 28 1912 Fred N Kilborn had left the farm, was a special agent for the S P C A and was residing in the Cottage hotel in Copenhagen. By his will, recorded November 22 1912 he gave his estate including his interest in this old homestead to his sister, Mrs Fannie E Paris, New York City, to whom George Darius Kilborn had deeded his half interest in the homestead two days before. Mrs Paris died in Champion March 27 1914 willing all her property to her brother, Fred, but as he had pre-deceased her the old homestead went to her only heir, her other brother, George Darius Kilborn, to whose estate it still belongs.\n\nGeorge Darius Kilborn was a colorful figure. Born in this big house April 6 1853 he spent his youth there, was graduated from the Brown-Otis college in this city, spent several years in New York managing his father's property, established a laboratory at Rhinebeck for the study of metallurgy and chemical geology, went to Colorado in 1879 to engage in mining, metallurgy and assay work, became managing director of the Empire mine at Cripple Creek, Colonel , built and Operated the first cyanide mill in Colorado, and in 1898 gained control of the famous Isabella silver mine. Three years before, he had married Miss Katherine Wright Anderson at Aspen, Colonel , on November 2 1895. In 1901 he contracted tuberculosis and was several years recovering, but the Isabella mine had made him a millionaire. Then in 1907 to protect a $100,000 loan he was compelled to take over the Nevada State Journal at Reno and for twelve years he was its owner and publisher. In 1919 he retired to reside in Auburn, California, and in the Sierra Nevada mountains a lake is named for him.\n\nPatron of the arts, a lover of horses and dogs he died March 19 1930 willing his widow a life-use of his estate and then providing that after her death the income be employed in the establishment and maintenance of a sanatorium or home for all indigent persons named Kilborn in this big, square house in South Champion. Mr Kilborn is buried in Morningside cemetery, Syracuse, his widow resides in California and the big mansion slowly goes to ruin. The record shows that Hiram W Kilborn bought two of the present parcels of the farm from his parents January 3 1837 one from Jeremiah Chase March 1 1948 and one from George Kelner February 18 1867.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nThe image and info below is from:\n\nhttps://www.stonehousesofjeffersoncounty.org/historic-houses-inventory\n\nIt was on January 3 1835 that Daniel Ackerman, one of the earliest settlers in the town of Brownville's Pillar Point area, purchased a plot of 40.49 acres of land from Thomas W Ludlow and Thomas Ludlow Ogden of New York City for $243.42. On November 17 1836 he paid Washington and Stephanie Coster of New York $178.48 for an adjoining parcel of 50.17 acres. These two parcels constitute the small farm, upon which this low native limestone house stands.\n\nThe house now vacant for some time was built about the time of purchase of the land by Ackerman, and on December 24 1853 he and his wife, Elizabeth, disposed of the place to Joseph Swart for $3,000. There was included in that transaction a third parcel referred to in the deed as a fishing ground which Ackerman had purchased from William and Eleanor Gladwin May 6 1846 but this was disposed of separately at a later date.\n\nJoseph and Catharine Swart kept this house and the two original parcels aggregating 90.66 acres only five years. On November 15 1858 they sold the property to John D Ingerson and on December 31 1858 John D and Mary Ingerson conveyed it to William G Phillips of the town of Hounsfield. Henderson Tuttle, Watertown, bought this farm from Phillips on April 22 1862 and on June 19 of the same year Tuttle and his wife, Sophronia, transferred the place to his brother, Theodore F Tuttle, also of Watertown village. On March 11 1871 Theodore F and Abby Tuttle sold this farm to James Drury for $3,500 and it has since been much referred to as the \"Drury\" farm. The Drurys occupied the property for a decade and on January 1 1881 disposed of it to Gilbert Bradford, prominent Watertown citizen and industrialist, who apparently took it for an investment inasmuch as he never resided there. Born at Hartwick, NY, September 8 1814 Mr Bradford learned card making and blacksmithing as well as becoming an expert machinist. Locating first in Clayton he removed to Watertown in 1838 had charge of the George Goulding & Company machine shop for several years until 1850 there conceived the idea of a portable steam engine, built two, took Charles B Hoard into partnership in the name of Hoard & Bradford and organized the Watertown Steam Engine company. In 1858 he was elected to congress.\n\nMr Bradford died April 4 1885 and on December 11 1895 George W Knowlton as executor of his estate sold this Pillar Point stone house and farm to Andrew Taylor, native of England, who, with James A Reeves, formed the firm of Reeves & Taylor, which built a large cheese factory on Pillar Point in 1885. Mr Taylor, whose daughter, Ella M, married Judge George W Reeves of this city, Pillar Point native, died July 6 1900 willing life-use of this farm to his son, Frank M Taylor, and then to his grandchildren, Floyd E and Mildred E Reeves, Andrew K Taylor and Angie T Gardner, Dexter.\n\nFrank M Taylor died November 13,1931 and December 29 of that year the grandchildren of Andrew Taylor sold this property to the late Mrs Nellie E Poole, first wife of Arthur W Poole of Dexter. On February 3 1944 Mrs Poole sold this place to Ross F Savage and wife, Elizabeth, the present owners, who added it to the adjoining 101.40 acre Gould farm, which they had purchased from the estate of Morris J Gould April 5 1921 and upon which they reside.\n\nThey are considering rehabilitating this sturdy old stone house as a home for their son.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nA face-lifting operation accomplished during the past year has restored this old native limestone house to a closer approximation to its original appearance than it has possessed in a quarter of a century. This face-lifting has included the removal of a verandah which almost completely hid the stonework of the road side of the house, the installation of hardwood floors and modern conveniences and the addition of a large frame kitchen and workroom at the rear. Also the stone walls have been given a thorough cleaning and pointing-up so that the structure has a fresh and almost new appearance. Located on the old Military road's south side in the town of LeRay, a short distance above Pamelia Four Corners, the house and farm has been owned since February 15 1941 by, Mrs Mary L Love, Chicago, who with her husband, William E Love, are engaged in the women's clothes business in the west. And under her ownership the rejuvenation of the old house has been undertaken.\n\nThe vintage of the house is of a century and a quarter ago. In fact its site is part of a farm of 149.44 acres purchased October 9 1824 by Isaac Lawrence of Attorney William H Harrison, New York City, for $991. The house was probably built the next year and November 4 1835 the entire property was sold by Isaac and Mary Lawrence to Jacob Walker of Root, NY, for $3,600. On February 27 1851 Walker disposed of 65 acres of it and buildings to his son, Zephaniah B Walker, the deed containing the provision that the actual transfer should not take place during the lifetime of Jacob.\n\nAt a later date the place came into the possession of Peter Wilbur Slack, a man who, in his earlier years devoted a part of his time to giving singing lessons at Evans Mills, LaFargeville and neighboring communities. He also operated his farm, pressed cider and wine in the basement of his house and in his later years he was adorned with a set of whiskers that came to his belt line.\n\nPeter Wilbur Slack was born March 18 1830. His father, Peter Slack, born at Windsor, Vermont, in 1797 came first to Watertown in 1804 and then moved to the Pamelia area. His wife, a native of Salem, Massachusetts, descended from Mayflower stock. Their children were Mrs Anna Hardy, Peter Wilbur Slack and Marshall B Slack. And when Peter Slack died October 21 1885 he willed his widow, Vestha, a life-use of his estate including the 190-acre farm where they resided. After her death his two sons were to be his residuary legatees. At 22 Peter Wilbur Slack married Adelia E, daughter of Daniel Harter and located in Pamelia, but three years later he purchased his farm on the Military road.\n\nJuly 12 1907 his wife joined him in the sale of the house pictured above and land to Lorenzo J and Alice D Hall who disposed of the place April 14 1914 to Amos D and Lillian E Hicks, now of Evans Mills. It was Mr Hicks who added the large verandah to the house, and it was he and Mrs Hicks who sold the property to the present owner, Mrs Love, seven years ago, retiring to Evans Mills. Mr Hicks, son of the late William and Janet Pickard Hicks of Pamelia Center, was married to Miss Lillian S Amo at Felts Mills January 3 1900. Three sons, Stanley, Carlton and Frederick, were born to them. Mr Hicks is now 74 and Mrs Hicks 70 and in Evans Mills they reside in the house formerly owned by Mrs Hicks' parents. Both Mr and Mrs Hicks have been active in grange, fraternal and activities of the Methodist church. Peter Wilbur Slack was elected a justice of the peace of the town of LeRay in 1858 and served eight years in that capacity.\n\nMrs Love, whose former husband was a Dr Kane of Chicago and now deceased, owns an attractive white house a little further up the Military road on the way to Theresa, and spends part of each year there.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nThese pictures taken June 2015:\n\nStately and classic and well-kept this house draws the attention of every tourist passing through Main Street of the village of Mannsville. By county records title to it can definitely be traced back to July 20 1861 when Philip and Roxana Wheeler conveyed it to Melvin J Earl.\n\nA deed dated December 15 1838 from Daniel and Hetty Wardwell transferring about 170 acres of land in Mannsville to Philip Wheeler for $6,000 states that it is the same farm now in possession of Daniel Wardwell and on which he now resides in said village of Mannsville.\n\nA biographical sketch of Mr Wardwell relates that he resided in Mannsville until about 1860 when he removed to Rome, NY In a similar sketch of Philip Wheeler it is declared that while Mr Wardwell was a member of congress Mr Wheeler purchased the Wardwell holdings amounting to approximately 200 acres, gradually selling off the land until much of the village of Mannsville was built upon it.\n\nThese facts would seem to leave little doubt that this tall-pillared white house was originally the residence of Congressman Daniel Wardwell and that it was probably built in the late 1820's or first 1830's. The lot upon which the house stands is described precisely in all of the deeds from the present back to and including the Wheeler-to-Earl deed of July 20 1861 as consisting of .89 of an acre.\n\nDaniel Wardwell, Democrat who served this district in the house of representatives 1830-1836 during the regime of President Andrew Jackson, was an outstanding north country figure. Son of Colonel Samuel Wardwell, he was born in Bristol, RI, in 1791. In 1815 he was married to Hetty, daughter of Newton and Abigail Maxey Mann, and resided in Rome. In 1817 they removed to Adams and in 1822 to Mannsville where he erected a 600-spindle cotton factory, which operated until it burned February 16 1827. Two and a half years later he was elected to congress and at the end of his service moved back to Rome, where he died in 1878 aged 87. His wife had died 20 years before him.\n\nPhilip Wheeler, who succeeded Judge Wardwell in the ownership of this house, was born June 30 1800 on a 1200-acre tract of the former VanRensselaer estate near Troy. Philip became a Troy merchant and also rafted timber to New York. About 1824 he married Roxana, daughter of Thomas Shepherd and descendant of the Rhode Island Browns of John Brown tract fame. Philip and Roxana Wheeler came to this county about 1825. For 20 years he was a prominent Mannsville merchant, a founder of the Manasville Methodist church and was a vital force in developing the village. He died in 1872 his wife in 1869.\n\nMelvin J and Polly M Earl retained this property but five years, selling it April 17 1866 to Captain John Minar, a seasoned and colorful seaman of the Great Lakes and descendants of him still own the fine old mansion, maintaining it as a summer retreat. Born in Schenectady February 15 1811 Captain Minar was son of John and Catherine Colon Minar. Described as a veritable Hercules, weighing 250 pounds and strong as three men, he sailed the lakes for 40 years rising from cabin boy to master, and then owner of fleets. He sailed with Elbridge G Merrick on the schooner \"Lucinda,\" became part owner and commander of the \"Adriatic,\" the \"Pathfinder\" and others. He was deeply religious. His first wife, Betsey R Blount Minar, mother of his children, died May 16 1860. On February 9 1865 he married Mary Myers Fiske. Captain Minar died April 2 1898 aged 88. Willing his widow a life-use of his property he provided it next go to his children, Walter J Minar, Mrs Fannie R Ford and Elbridge G Minar. But on September 5 1897 he had conveyed the house to the daughter, wife of Reverend James Wallace Ford.\n\nBorn June 22 1852 Mrs Ford became a nationally famed Sunday school teacher, Bible history authority, lecturer and author. She died June 2 1922 directing that this house be kept for use of all her family including her brother, E G Minar, and that her daughter, Mrs Frank R (Marietta Ford) Russell have charge of it. A granddaughter by marriage, Mrs Frances Evans Ford, Washington, D C, is said to be the present owner.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nAn atmosphere of contentment born of a beautiful pastoral scene and the peace and quiet that reigns on a secluded country road is the environment of this wellkept and handsome old house of native limestone. Off the beaten trail, it is located in the town of Champion about two miles north of the hamlet of Champion and a half mile east of Champion Huddle.\n\nMr and Mrs George L Fleming, present owners, acquired it March 21 1935 from Mr and Mrs William A Babcock, now deceased, and state that the house was built in 1812 by Horace Champion and David Rockwood. No Horace Champion appears in the county records, but the house may have been built in 1812 for the Rockwoods were among the earliest settlers in Jefferson County.\n\nAt 21 William Rockwood, New England native, settled in Champion in 1799. The next three of his brothers, David, Asa and Roswell, came on the next year with their father, Reuben. Reuben became one of the overseers of the poor at the first town meeting in 1800.\n\nMr and Mrs Fleming relate that David Rockwood and wife, Raley, sold this house and farm to Elizur Goodrich Jr, in 1825. The county records show that on November 23 1825 David and Raley Rockwood sold three parcels of 50 acres, 33.25 acres and 24.93 acres in this locale to Mr Goodrich for $800 and that on the same date Mr Goodrich paid Asa and Amanda Rockwood $800 for 48 neighboring acres. Eliza C Goodrich joined her husband in the purchase. They were residents of Hartford, Connecticut, and wealthy for that era.\n\nIt is unlikely Mr and Mrs Goodrich ever resided on this farm. It is probable they bought the place as an investment. The county records report that they bought many parcels of farm lands in Jefferson County and always it was noted that they were residents of Hartford, Connecticut. When Mr Goodrich died November 4 1868 his residence was still in Hartford and his estate was estimated not in excess of $400,000.\n\nOn January 31 1878 his executor, Nathaniel Shipman of Hartford, sold this farm to Lysander W Babcock of Carthage, and on May 14 1914 Mr Babcock, then of West Carthage, conveyed it to his son, William Alfred Babcock and wife, Theresa. That deed defined the land as about 180 acres. On March 21 1935 when William A and Theresa Babcock sold to Mr and Mrs Fleming the transfer stated the farm to contain 181.47 acres of land. Lysander Whitfield Babcock, born March 17 1836 relative of Henry Holmes Babcock who founded the carriage business in this city, was married to Mary Jane Merrill November 10 1857. Their son, William Alfred Babcock, their successor in ownership of this house and farm, was born February 7 1860 married Miss Theresa Wagner, New York City, October 1 1884 and died October 24 1936 survived by his daughter, Miss Mildred E Babcock, West Carthage, Mr Babcock having taken residence there after selling the farm to the Flemings.\n\nTwo of the daughters of Lysander W and Mary Jane Babcock now reside in West Carthage. They are Mrs William (Lida B) Chaufty and Mrs Edward (Alfreda B) Harrington. Two other daughters, Mrs W P (Nettie B) Phillips and Mrs Thomas (Lizzie B) Williams are deceased.\n\nUpon acquiring this property Mr and Mrs Fleming removed an eight-room wooden addition placed on the house by the Babcocks about 1886 and furbished it up with wooden blinds. Five years ago Mr Fleming and son, Merlin D Fleming, opened a lumber business and woodworking shop, which they have transferred to the former plant of the Carthage Wood Products company, which they purchased June 7 1950\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\n204 W Main\n\nThomas Y How, of Trenton, NJ, close friend and benefactor of Major General Jacob Brown, Brownville's founder, was Jefferson County's first Princeton graduate as well as one of its very first pioneer settlers. Back at the very beginning of the last century while Jefferson County's 1,293 square miles were still a part of Oneida county, and while Pierre Joulin was the attorney and land agent of James D LeRay de Chaumont, Thomas Y How on April 23 1801 and February 10 1802 bought 1,060 acres in three parcels north of Limerick and Brownville in the Perch River area from Mr LeRay. In later years he bought other lands.\n\nHe is described as a most agreeable companion, a man of great culture and polish, a valuable acquisition to the community, but a man of little business acumen. With him from New Jersey he brought a patrimony of $10,000 and loaned large sums to the Browns of Brownville to help them finance their enterprises.\n\nHistory relates that Mr How engaged Jacob Brown to clear, fit and plant 100 acres for him on the Perch River flats; that Jacob Brown employed \"Honest John\" Brown, father of Aaron and George to do the job with the result that he became known as \"How-job John\" Brown; and that July 9 1802 Jacob Brown wrote his own brother, John, a New York bookseller: \"We this year pay a debt of $2,000 to my good friend How, for clearing and putting in crop of his 100 acres, for it will amount to that sum. The work is in a very forward state.\"\n\nWhen the Brownville library was incorporated February 10 1807 Thomas Y How was one of its founders and most zealous promoters.\n\nOn August 19 1842 Thomas Y How paid Joshua and Betsey Hemingway $1,950 for the lot where this house stands on the south side of Basin Street near Store House Alley in the village of Brownville. It abutted the old military cemetery where War of 1812 soldiers were buried and which was owned at that time by Colonel Edmund Kirby, General Brown's son-in-law.\n\nIt may be presumed that this double house with its two beautiful doorways was on the How site at that time, for on September 10 1838 Hemingway had paid Nathan Rathbun of Maumee, Ohio, $3,000 for the property. Thomas Y How died May 9 1855 willing his widow, Mary M How \"all real estate consisting of two houses and other buildings now occupied by General Loomis and myself.\" The latter was General Thomas Loomis, one of the incorporators of the old Brownville Cotton Factory and one of the first village trustees when Brownville was incorporated April 5 1828.\n\nOn October 9 1863 Mrs How sold the west side of the house to Alonzo Forward for $600. From Forward is passed to Stephen Fair, then to William Penn Massey, who sold to William Gibbs. Gibbs sold to Alfred G Taylor, who deeded it to his daughter, Mrs Anna M Mallett, who died June 21 1933 willing life-use to her daughter, Mrs James E (Hester) Gilmore, whose children will ultimately inherit it.\n\nIn late 1885 Mrs How died at the home of her sister, Mrs Sarah F Benedict, Cleveland, Ohio. July 26 1886 Mrs Benedict sold the east side of the house to Charles P Plumb. March 10 1894 his recorded will gave it to his widow, Sarah A Plumb. Her will recorded May 7 1901 gave it to her niece, Susan E Allen, Decatur, Michigan, who sold to Frank B and Billa M Walrath September 16 1903. Mrs Walrath later died. Mr Walrath passed away September 21 1941. Norman S and Regena W Gurney bought it May 6 1942 sold it to Orville and Genevieve Brownell January 31 1944 who conveyed to Charles and Adeline Brenon and Bertha M Center, present owners, May 28 1947. Almost a quarter acre had been sold off the east side of the lot to former Mayor Fred L Page July 15 1902 by Susan E Allen.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nWell away from the turmoil of traffic and not far from Pamelia Four Corners stands this old house of native limestone on a quiet country road that leads off the old Military highway. The record would indicate that the old dwelling was built about 115 years ago by Stephen VanRensselaer Stewart, although there is the possibility that it was constructed about 15 years earlier by Timothy Brockett.\n\nThe farm of 150.81 acres is made up of four parcels. One of these consisting of 50 acres was sold by James D LeRay to William Stewart Jr, June 11 1819 and on September 1 1835 Stewart and wife, Lucy, conveyed it and 34.96 acres, which they had bought from the Mechanic Fire Insurance company March 6 1830 to Stephen VanRensselaer Stewart for $500. William Stewart Jr, and S V R Stewart were brothers.\n\nOn June 1 1836 Washington and Stephanie Coster, New York, sold to S V R Stewart an adjoining 39.52 acres for $279.51. The fourth parcel of 50.76 adjoining acres had been bought by Timothy Brockett for $304.56 from the Mechanic Fire Insurance company on February 8 1830 and sold to S V R Stewart February 24,1849 for $1,000.\n\nThis price may indicate the house was erected on this parcel and by Brockett sometime after 1830. Otherwise it was built by Stewart shortly after 1835 or 1836.\n\nStephen VanRensselaer and William Stewart were among eight children of William and Caroline Billson Stewart who settled in the town of LeRay in 1811. The senior William Stewart was born in Londonderry, Ireland, in 1768 and at four came with his parents to America. In 1792 he married Caroline Billson and lived in the Cherry Valley for a time before coming to Jefferson County.\n\nStephen V R Stewart helped clear the wilderness in LeRay , became a carpenter and constructed some houses near Pamelia Four Corners. His first wife, Susan Jenkins, died in 20 months and in 1850 he married Sarah Elizabeth VanEpps.\n\nNot much is known of Stephen VanRensselaer Stewart outside of that. He lived near Pamelia Four Corners in the town of LeRay all his life and died September 4 1862 willing this farm with the stone house to his son, Clarence J Stewart, while the house in which he was residing at the time of his death he devised with contents to his widow. One Philander Locke was tenant on this farm at the time S V R Stewart made his will.\n\nClarence J Stewart later removed to Santa Monica, California, and died there August 5 1890 but on December 20 1889 he and his wife, Lilla M, had sold this farm and stone house to Constantine Ganter for $5,000. After C J Stewart's death his widow married C E Johnson of Lisbon, ND\n\nConstantine and Mary A Ganter, real estate dealers, sold this farm to Frank J Miller February 27 1893. Mr Miller's will recorded September 6 1910 gave most of his property to his sons, Frederick W and William J By the will of William J Miller recorded December 3 1915 all of his share went to his brother, Frederick, who the same day sold this place to William E Cable. Mr Cable and wife, Katherine M, disposed of it to Elbie G Hoover November 9 1931 and July 15 1940 the Hoover estate conveyed to the present owners, David and Elrena V VanTassel. Mrs VanTassel is a daughter of Mr Hoover, prominent Evans Mills merchant and farm implement dealer who died suddenly October 3 1933.\n\nThe old house, of quaint design, consists of eight rooms and is located in a picturesque area of the county which yields an unusual number of old stone houses\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nGrist mills, sawmills, cotton and woolen factories and tanneries were essentials to the pioneers who settled Jefferson and the adjoining counties upwards of a century and a half ago, and one of the first Jefferson County tanners was Anson Smith. Smith also was one of the earliest settlers in the town of Rutland.\n\nHe was a resident of that town January 25,1812 the date of his first recorded purchase of real estate in the county. That purchase, made jointly with Eli Smith, from Shubal Butterfield, Watertown, was of slightly more than half an acre on the north side of the mall (Public Square) and carried the right to use so much water from the Butterfield spring as might be necessary to operate their tanning and currying business. But on June 2 1813 Anson and his wife, Polly, sold their half interest to Eli, having on February 22 1813 bought 134.40 acres in the town of Rutland, not far from the Champion line, from Isaac and Anne Bronson. That land was on the south side of the old state road which ran from Watertown through Rutland Center to Champion.\n\nOn May 9 1815 Anson acquired 50 adjoining acres from Goldsmith and Reform Coffeen. There he established a new tannery and also built the brick house displayed above. And he acquired substantial adjoining tracts in ensuing years, some of which he later disposed of. No record of his estate is found in the surrogate's office and the sale of the brick house and and tannery before 1850 undoubtedly means that he left this section of the country.\n\nOn March 18 1840 Anson and Polly Smith sold 100 acres in this Rutland locale to Charles D Smith for $2,000. On November 17 1848 they sold another 100.40 acres to Edwin S White for $1,950 and eleven days later, on November 28 1848 they disposed of 65.03 acres and the tannery to Charles Pool for $2,420. That deed refers to Anson Smith's \"brick dwelling,\" shows that the line of this 65.03 parcel started one chain 87 links from the northwest corner of the brick house and that the tannery was west of it. Pool ran the tannery about 25 years.\n\nThe brick house with its stone wing at the rear was part of the property acquired by Charles D Smith, but on November 10,1851 he and his wife, Sabra, sold it and 159.72 acres to Deodatus Ferguson for $6,388. Deodatus Ferguson, who added an adjacent parcel of 17.81 acres, died November 10,1887 willing his widow, Lura and children, John, Clark, Charles and Laura Ann, a life-use of this property.\n\nHowever, during the next three or four years Charles acquired the interest of the other heirs. By his will, recorded August 1 1902 Charles Ferguson gave all to his widow, Zilpha, and son, Clinton D Ferguson, expressing the desire that they live together and operate the farm. Her will, recorded May 12 1913 gave her son a life-use of her residuary estate and then to C Mortimer Shorey, C William Shorey and Mrs Catherine Greene, brothers and sister. They later transferred their interests in the estate to Clinton D Ferguson and on October 29 1930 Theodore Bond as administrator of his estate, sold this brick house, farm buildings and two parcels of 159.72 acres and 17.81 acres to Jay Frink Staplin, well known Rutland farmer.\n\nIn 1946 Mr Staplin disposed of this property to Nelson Jardin, the present owner, a school trustee in that district, who operates the fram.

Mr Brown, it should be mentioned, was a native of Watertown, son of the late Senator Elon R Brown who was not only one of the great constitutional lawyers of the state but was one of the most powerful leaders the New York state legislature ever had.\n\nMrs Brown, present owner and occupant of \"Shore Haven,\" was the former Miss Agnes Schlemm, born and educated in Germany, daughter of Mr and Mrs Leonard H Schlemm who later came to make their residence in the fashionable Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts. Mr Brown, to whom she was married in Brookline August 15 1914 was a graduate of Bowdoin college and of the New York Law school.\n\nIt was on June 16 1941 that they bought from Mrs Margaret Bowen McHenry \"Shore Haven\" with some 2 1/2 acres of land, its broad, deep lawn rolling down to the bay. The low, wide native limestone house with long, attached garage at the westerly end, luxuriates in an atmosphere of contentment, far from the noise and turmoil of traffic and busy communities.\n\nFor a score of years from 1845 to 1865 this old stone house with its simple entrance, now artistically graced by old carriage lamps on either side, was the home of Charles Wilson, for whom Wilson's Bay was named. Before that the site was part of the farm of Benjamin Tibbett, son of the man for whom Tibbett's Point was named. From the record the odds seem strong that Benjamin Tibbett built this house about 1820 but if not, it was likely the work of Charles Wilson, and the lot upon which it stands was definitely a part of the 599.06 acres, which the state of New York patented to Captain John Tibbett of Troy, on November 18 1800.\n\nIt was for Captain Tibbett, it will be recalled that Tibbett's Point was named, the extreme head of which has become familiar to mariners because of the lighthouse, which the federal government erected there in 1827.\n\nCounty records show that on April 17 1801 Captain Tibbett deeded 200 of his 599.06 patented acres to his sons, George and Benjamin, for a nominal consideration of $15. Then on June 5 1820 Sarah Tibbett joined with her husband, George, in conveying his half interest in the 200-acre parcel of which this house site is a part, plus, some of the patented acreage, to Benjamin.\n\nOn February 5 1833 Benjamin and Elizabeth Tibbett sold this 200 acres and two adjoining parcels to Rowell T Lee and Henry Ainsworth, an old Revolutionary veteran from Vermont and early Cape Vincent settler. March 2 1839 found them conveying the same to Charles and James G Wilson, and February 5 1845 James G and Eleanor Wilson transferred their interest in 150 acres of the 200-acre tract to Charles G Wilson. On November 5 1865 he sold the 150 acres to Thomas VanSchaick for $6,750. VanSchaick retained ownership 47 years and January 9 1912 he and Nancy his wife disposed of it to Dwight M Borland, who on March 1 1920 sold the property to John W Milligan.\n\nNext, on September 12 1928 John W and Katherine Milligan sold off this house and 2.4 acres from the 150 acres to Margaret Bowen who, as Margaret Bowen McHenry conveyed to Philip Hayward Brown and his wife, Mrs Agnes Schlemm Brown June 16 1941.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nUpon \"Brandy Lane,\" a sector of the meagerly traveled route from the old French Settlement of the town of Cape Vincent to the river road that runs frome Cape Vincent village to Clayton, this pleasant native limestone house stands not far from Millen's Bay.

After her death, according to the will of her husband, who died May 6 1943 it is to be divided among their children.\n\nThe farm, of which this house is the manor, consists of three parcels of 24.31 acres, 24.72 acres and 75.42 acres. These all came to Charles E Constance by deed from his father, John Constance dated July 2 1901. The two smaller parcels were transferred to John Constance by Lawrence Constance Jr, and his wife, Barbara, for a consideration of $1,000 on October 25 1858. The large parcel of 75.42 acres was acquired by John Constance from William Rice Parish and wife, Emeline, on February 28 1859 for $3,280 a price which indicates patently that there was a house and buildings on this tract at that time.\n\nMr Parish bought that 75.42-acre parcel from Vincent LeRay de Chaumont through the latter's attorney, Patrick Somerville Stewart, for $347.90 on January 21 1856 that price making it evident that there were no buildings on the parcel at that time.\n\nAll three parcels were originally part of the vast LeRay family holdings in the north country. When the LeRays disposed of the 24.31-acre parcel it is difficult to determine, but on December 8 1849 it was sold by Thomas and Margaret Robbins to Otis P Starkey for $300. On March 17 1855 Starkey and wife, Beulah, sold it to Lawrence \"Costancar\" for $500 and October 25 1858 the latter conveyed it and the 24.72-acre parcel to John \"Costancar\" for $1,000.\n\nThe 24.72-acre parcel was purchased by Lawrence \"Costancar\" from Vincent LeRay through Patrick Somerville Stewart for $277.13 on November 15 1853.\n\nThrough the county clerk's records the name of the family, known as Constance for the past half century, 'is variously spelled \"Constance,\" \"Costancar\" and \"Constancer.\" It is of German origin, the original Jefferson County Lawrence Constance, native of Germany, having emigrated to the French Settlement of the town of Cape Vincent with his wife Elizabeth and children in 1840.\n\nAmong those children was Lawrence Constance Jr, who, upon reaching maturity, was married to Barbara, daughter of John and Elizabeth Smithling of Clayton. Mr and Mrs Lawrence Constance Jr, were the parents of eleven children: Elizabeth, Mary, Theresa, Lawrence, Helen, Edward, Katie, Joseph, Emma, William and John F Lawrence Constance Jr, was a prosperous Cape Vincent farmer for many years, as was his brother, John, to whom he sold the parcels comprising the farm where this stone house now stands. The entire Constance family was one of the substantial old families of the town of Cape Vincent.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nThe Esselstyns were almost as prominent in the development of the village of Cape Vincent as were the LeRays. In May, 1803 John B Esselstyn came from Hudson, Montgomery county, where he was in businses with his brother, Richard M, to settle a mile below Port Putnam. He was joined in 1806 by Richard. They formed J B & R M Esselstyn, built a store and house in 1809 operated a mercantile establishment and lumber business at Gravelly Point, now Cape Vincent, and were leading figures in the community.\n\nTimber, which they purchased from the LeRays, they rafted in enormous quantities to the Montreal market and it is said they were the largest makers of barrel slaves in the country. In the War of 1812 a large amount of their lumber on shore was burned by Major General James Wilkinson's army and more of it was washed down the river. Their store was at the foot of James Street.\n\nWhen Cape Vincent was made a port of delivery March 2 1811 John B Esselstyn was appointed first deputy collector and when a custom house was created April 18 1818 he was chosen first collector. After declaration of the War of 1812 General Jacob Brown commissioned him major in command of the Cape Vincent militia, and government stores were housed in the Esselstyn storehouse.\n\nThe two Esselstyns were charter members of Cape Vincent Lodge, No. 344 F & A M, chartered March 8 1822 John B becoming first master. On August 14 1824 he was a founder of the union library. When he died December 19 1857 his principal heirs included his widow, Clarissa, and son, William. On August 20 1817 John B Esselstyn paid James D LeRay de Chaumont $106 for .66 of an acre of land in the Gouvello Street area of the village down near the waterfront.\n\nHis will, recorded June 24 1858 states that he was giving his son, William, the residence on Gouvello Street, and was naming William, a son-in-law, Simon Howard, and a friend, Philetus Judd, executors.\n\nWilliam Esselstyn and wife, Maria, sold the Gouvello Street residence to Mrs Harriet E Hance of Bloomington, Illinois, for $1,000 on May 2 1860. On April 1 1867 Mrs Hance, wife of S B Hance, disposed of the place to Willard Ainsworth Jr, who mortgaged it for $2,000 to James G Wilson, Picton, Ontario, November 10 1875 and at mortgage foreclosure sale August 21 1888 Attorney William A Nims, referee, conveyed the property to Stewart Wilson Jr, and Jane Wilson, Picton, for $1000. It was later acquired by William W Sheley who, with his wife, Mary E, sold to Mrs Eveline A Clark on September 24 1898 for $2,500.\n\nOn February 7 1900 Eveline A, wife of Charles M Clark, conveyed the place to William Henry Johnson for $2,200 and 40 years later the Citizens bank of Cape Vincent took title from Mr Johnson, a Cape Vincent merchant. Then on July 1 1941 the bank sold the property to Abraham J B Fairburn and wife, Reba Peo Fairburn, present owners, for $1,000.\n\nGraduate of Penn State College and Columbia university, Mr Fairburn served in U S Flying Squadron \"A\" in World War I, became identified with the New York Edison company in 1925 was appointed a member of the Cooper Union Institute of Technology faculty in 1927 and September 3 1931 was married to Miss Reba Marion Peo, daughter of Mr and Mrs Leon L Peo, Cape Vincent. Mr Fairburn's father, the late Reverend John Fairburn, native of England, was for seven years rector of St. John's Episcopal church, Cape Vincent. William W Sheley, farmer, born June 15 1827 in the town of Orleans, was the son of Martin Sheley Jr, and Betsey Weeks Sheley, who came from Herkimer to Orleans in 1820. William M Sheley married Mary E King of Orleans. William Esselstyn died January 3 1880 leaving Maria, widow, and children, John B Esselstvn, Helen M Parker, Clarissa J Dodge and Frances C Kilburn.\n\nWillard Ainsworth Jr, born 1830 son of Willard and Sally Green Ainsworth, married Mary C Herrick, was deputy collector of customs four years, and grandson of the Vermont Revolutionary soldier, Henry Ainsworth, and Hannah Throop Ainsworth.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nIt was about 150 years ago that Bradford Lisk became one of the earliest pioneers of the town of Adams. He chose a location on Sandy creek about a mile and a half from Smith's Mills (Adams village) on the Rodman road. In that area Samuel Fox in June, 1800 made the first clearing in the town of Adams, and at Eliphalet Edmund's house March 1 1803 the first Adams town meeting was held\n\nA little later Bradford Lisk and Francis McKee erected a tannery there and a man named Munn built a tavern. Across the north branch of Sandy creek a bridge was swung, which became known as the Lisk bridge, and althougli it was superseded by a covered structure, which some years ago was replaced by the present steel truss span, it has always been known as the Lisk bridge and the settlement has likewise been Lisk Settlement.\n\nOn November 1 1808 Bradford Lisk bought 127.25 acres from Nicholas Low, New York, speculator in Jefferson and Lewis county lands. Upon this Lisk built his house.\n\nOn September 11 1810 he sold off 23.98 acres to David and Francis Brown and Matthew Brown Jr, all of Rome. On January 1 1818 Lisk and wife Jerusha conveyed off another plot of slightly more than 18 acres to Eli Wright. Later a half acre to David Jones, and then added to a five-acre plot to his own farm. Thus Bradford Lisk was left 90 to 92 acres with his house and outbuildings.\n\nThis property he mortgaged to Maus V V Rosa, wealthy Adams business man, on January 22 1834. To satisfy the mortgage the plaee was sold by Charles D Wright, master in chancery, at mortgage foreclosure sale June 28 1841 to John M Thompson, Hounsfield, son-in-law of Lisk, for $2,200.\n\nThompson and wife Charlotte conveyed it to John H Whipple, Adams merchant January 1 1845 and February 23 1846 John H and Elizabeth Whipple disposed of it to John H and William A Gilbert, Adams. William A Gilbert, Adams, lawyer, banker, assemblyman, Congressman, was joined by his wife Julia April 1 1850 in selling it to Philander Smith, Lorraine. Smith and wife, Adeline M deeded it to Jesse W Smith for $6,000 May 1 1856 and June 8 1872 Jesse W and Priscilla K Smith transferred the 90 to 92 acres with this large brick house to De Witt Strickland, Rodman native for $7,000. Since that time 79 years ago it has been known as the Strickland farm.\n\nBorn in the town of Rodman in 1830 DeWitt Strickland was a son of Rial and Lorinda Gager Strickland. Rial Strickland, schoolmaster and Massachusetts native, was born February 13 1787 settled near Rodman village in 1810 became a fruit grower, was a Whig by politics, served as justice of the peace and was a man of influence.\n\nDeWitt Strickland was a Republican. He served in Company B, 10th New York Heavy Artillery in the Civil War, became a member of the GAR, was a Baptist, on March 18 1863 was married to Samaria C Burnham of Henderson by whom he had three children: DeAlton who died young; Nellie M and William R. Mrs Strickland died September 29 1881 and January 4 1883 DeWitt Strickland married Susan E Simmons for his second wife. He died May 21 1897. A son, Howell G Strickland, city, was born of his second marriage.\n\nWilliam R Strickland, born in Henderson October 26 1864 became the succeeding owner of this old brick house and farm. A business course graduate of Adams Collegiate Institute he was a successful dairy farmer, was a Republican, member of the Lincoln League, Rising Sun Lodge No. 234 F & A M, Adams Grange and January 24 1894 was married to Pearl E, daughter of Nathan Aldro and Emerette A Wright Whitford of Whitford's Comers. Mr Strickland died some years ago. His widow, who died August 15 1947 gained prominence in 1930 by offering this property to the government as a sanatorium for drug addicts, but it was not accepted and is now owned by her only child, Miss Samaria Strickland, Adams, and the farm is operated by tenant. This big house, which once had. fireplaces in each of its two living rooms, overlooks five roads, the Lisk bridge and Sandy creek. Originally the neighboring farm was owned by Joseph L Green, direct descendant of Major General Nathaniel Green, and administrator of Bradford Lisk's estate following the latter's death in 1851\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nSleek, spotless and beautiful this white Georgian house with handsome front entrance, original twelve-paned windows and delicate oval louver in the front gable, stands on the main street of historic Turin and is said to have been built in 1818 by Dr Royal Dwight Dewey. It is now owned by his great-great grandaughter, Miss Helen C Holden, Newark, NY.\n\nOne of Lewis county's earliest physicians, Dr Royal Dwight Dewey was born October 3 1791 in Westfield, Massachusetts, son of Aaron and Sibyl Cadwell Dewey. They later removed to Franklin, NY. There Royal Dwight Dewey resided until 1809 when be began studying medicine with Dr Walter Dewey in Collinsville and was licensed as a physician July 13 1812. As W & R Dewey they practiced there together until 1816.\n\nThat year Dr Royal Dwight Dewey established himself in Turin. Married Melinda, daughter of Stephen Hart March 10 1818 and built this house that year. The same year he was appointed postmaster and justice of the peace, serving several years, and in 1836-7-8-9 served the town as supervisor.

They were parents of six sons and four daughters.\n\nOf the latter Delia married Emery Bennett Holden in 1840 died in 1843 and later Mr Holden, grandfather of the present owner, married Delia's sister Maria continuing residence in this house, Mr Holden operating a drug store next door.\n\nEmery Bennett Holden, son of Asa and Pluma Wilcox Holden, was born in Floyd, Onedia county in 1814 came to Turin in 1834 worked for his uncle, Ozias Wilcox, merchant, later headed E B Holden & Co., drugs and general merchandise.\n\nWilcox & Holden became the successor, followed by Holden & Dewey formed in 1858 Duane Dewey, brother-in-law, being the partner of Mr Holden, and after the death of Mr Dewey, Mr Holden continued the business alone. For some years he had also owned a two-thirds interest in 5,000 acres of Tug Hill timberlands and the Holden sawmill doing an extensive spruce lumber business.\n\nHe was many years a justice of the peace, was a Republican, twice postmaster, several times supervisor, member of the senate war committee during the Civil War, and member of the Turin board of education from its formation in 1869 until his death in 1878. Succeding him in business and the membership of this house was his son, William Duane Holden.\n\nWilliam Duane Holden was born in Turin May 25 1857 was educated there in the public schools and entered his father's store in 1876 joining with his brother E Dewey Holden in forming Holden Brothers to continue the business after the death of their father in 1878. E Dewey Holden's death in February, 1920 ended the partnership and William D Holden carried on the business as sole owner. Learning the printer's trade as a boy, William D Holden operated a job printing office as a young man and in 1883-4 published The Turin Independent as a side issue. He was a Republican, was clerk of the board of supervisors in 1903 village and school district treasurer several years, president of the county Child Welfare board many years, treasurer of the county war chest in World War I, treasurer of the Turin Cemetery association 25 years and director since incorporation. He was a Presbyterian elder, church trustee 40 years, Sunday school superintendent 45 years and superintendent emeritus after 1931. Twice he was commissioner to the general assembly. Often he was delegate to Republican state conventions. In 1915 he was county supervisor of census.\n\nOn October 17 1883 he married Carrie Hunt Lee, daughter of Alfred H and Elizabeth Hunt Lee. Mrs Holden died in December, 1926 and Mr Holden on April 7 1934. Their children are Mrs C Willard Rice, Geneva; W Stuart Holden, Morrisville, and Miss Helen C Holden, Newark.

The opinion also is that he constructed it for his brother, Willard L Eddy, prominent Pamelia farmer, who willed the property to his son, Pitt A Eddy.\n\nTwin brother of James Eddy, Enoch Eddy Jr, was one of ten children born to Enoch and Amy King Eddy, the senior Enoch Eddy having come from Rutland, Vermont, in 1799 to take up land in our town of Rutland to which he brought on his family in June, 1800 to settle. In 1831 Enoch Eddy Sr removed to the town of Pamelia, where his wife died in 1818 and he two years later.\n\nThis long, low, attractive Georgian house with central hall and long, single story wing, all of native limestone, was the home of Willard L and Mary Sheldon Eddy for about 35 years it is believed, and was willed by Willard L Eddy to'his son, Pitt A Eddy. That will was executed February 12 1867 but on October 18 1870 Pitt A Eddy sold the property to Wilson H Countryman, Pamelia, and transferred to the far west, later dying in Portland, Ore. Mr Eddy's wife was the former Huldah Aldrich.\n\nOn April 24 1879 Wilson H Countryman and wife, Betsey A, conveyed the place and its then more than 170 acres of land to Alexander Countryman, who died intestate May 1 1891 and this house and farm went to his two sons, William M and Gershom J Countryman. Shortly thereafter Gershom purchased the half interest of his brother and retained possession of the whole until October 2 1919 when he and his wife, Cora A VanAllen Wood Countryman, disposed of it to Leo Dermady of Cape Vincent. On October 15 1928 Mr Dermady and wife, Alice, conveyed it to James D and Mabel A Mclntyre of the town of Pamelia.\n\nMr and Mrs Mclntyre kept it only until December 6 1930 when they sold it back to Gershom J Countryman. Mr Countryman, however, prosperous farmer, Republican and member of Pamelia Grange, No. 168 died March 6 1932 and on February 25 1938 his estate, represented by his widow and children, transferred it to James Wetmore.\n\nMr Wetmore lived but a short time after acquiring the farm and on April 1 1940 his estate, represented by his widow, Eva L Wetmore, and daughter, Mrs Mildred Wetmore Vrooman, conveyed it to Mrs Cora A Countryman, widow of Gershom. Mrs Countryman then sold the property to Ernest D and Nina M Fitzgerald on May 24 1943. Mr Fitzgerald died shortly after that and by his will, recorded October 26 1944 this place went to his widow. Not long after that she disposed of this stone house, barns and 97.56 acres of land to Roy E Marlowe, the present owner.\n\nFor three-quarters of a century it has been familiar as the Countryman farm, and few people today know anything about the connection of the Eddy family with the property. Both the Eddy and Countryman families are old established ones in Jefferson County. Henry Countryman, founder of the Countryman line in the Pamelia area, came there in May, 1823 to build a shop and engage in the making of carriages. He was a native of Danube, Herkimer county, son of George and Roxana Spraker Countryman, the latter of whom was sister of Robert Spraker, onetime president of the New York Central railroad.\n\nAbout four years before coming to Pamelia, Henry Countryman had been married on October 19 1919 to Elizabeth Walrath of Danube, member also of the well known Walrath family which wrote its name prominently upon the pioneer roster of Jefferson County families\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nThere is a plain beauty about this brick house near the railroad crossing on the westerly outskirts of Evans Mills which never fails to halt the attention of the passerby.\n\nPerhaps the soothing charm of the setting lends more than its fair share to the overall picture. It was probably in 1833-4 that this house was built for William H Granger who, with Ethni Evans, James Anthony, Ruel Kimball, Peter Hoover and others, became one of the earliest and one of the most prominent settlers of the town of LeRay.\n\nGranger, one of the earliest of distillers and tavernkeepers in the area of Evans Mills named for Ethni Evans, joined with Captain Sanderson in the building and operation of a distillery, of which there were then many in the north country, by the little stream at the south end of the village.\n\nTo Elisha and Lydia Steele on February 16. 1830 he paid $254 for 23.09 acres, first of three parcels which constitute the farm where this house stands. The second parcel of 48.43 acres was purchased by him for $658 from Washington and Stephanie Coster, New York City, Jefferson County land speculators, on January 28 1833. The third parcel of 3.33 acres was bought by Mr Granger for $20 on February 2 1833. from Vincent LeRay as assignee of the properties of his father, James D LeRay de Chaumont, thereby completing a farm of 74.85 acres. One of William H Granger's sons, Hezekiah L Granger, who died November 14 1867 served as supervisor of the town of LeRay in 1844-5. Another son, Cleanthus P Granger, who died May 5 1882 was assemblyman from the second of the county's three districts in 1856 and in 1863-4 was supervisor of the town.\n\nAlthough William H Granger did not die until May 6 1872 he conveyed this house and farm to his son-in-law, Horatio N Eddy, and daughter, Ann P Granger Eddy, for $2,500 on March 24 1852. Horatio Nelson Eddy, whose first wife was Philinda Welch, was born October 30 1806 and died April 21. 1891. His father was Enoch Eddy Sr, and a brother, Willard L Eddy, was owner of last week's house. Henry Welch Eddy, son of Horatio Nelson Eddy's first marriage, not only became first representative from Oregon, but had the first apple orchard there, selling his first eight bushels of apples in San Francisco for $500 in gold.\n\nFour children were born of his second marriage, to Ann Phelps Granger, two of whom, Mary E, who married William Cooper, and Sophronia, who married Henry R Larned, later figured in the ownership of this place. Horatio Nelson Eddy died intestate September 21 1891 but pursuant to an agreement made March 1 1883 to sell this property to his daughter, Mary E Cooper, it was conveyed to her by his estate December 3 1891. Eight years later Mrs Cooper died, willing a life-use of this farm to her sister, Mrs Larned, and providing, after Mrs Larned's death a life-use to Mrs Larned's daughter, Mrs Anne Lily Foster, wife of Delevan George Foster, long a prominent Watertown furniture dealer.\n\nMrs Foster, who died September 5. 1949. disposed of this Evans Mills house and farm March 6 1912 to John R Cornwell. prominent LeRay farmer, who died September 19 1938 willing it to his son, George W Cornwell, St. Louis, Missouri, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, with the request that when he sold the place, he give testator's widow, Mrs Bernice E Nims Cornwell, and daughter, Mrs Claude J (Hazel) Ashton, equal shares.\n\nAccordingly on August 22 1939 the property was transferred to Mrs Lucille R Wilcox, city, for a nominal sum, and the same day Mrs Wilcox conveyed it back in equal interests to George W Cornwell, St. Louis, Missouri; Mrs Bernice E Cornwell and Mrs Hazel Ashton the present owners. Mr and Mrs Ashton operate the farm and reside there with Mrs Cornwell.\n\nUndoubtedly it should be mentioned that Nelson Eddy, famed American baritone singer, is related to the Eddy family which was linked with the ownership of the houses of this week and last\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nHaving all of the characteristics of having been one of the earliest of limestone houses to be constructed in Jefferson County, this long idle structure is located only a short distance west of the Clayton state highway. It is on a side road tapping the latter at a point near the old stone Baptist church, just south of Perch river and thence running into the village of Brownville.\n\nThere is little in the record today to show who the original owner of the house was. Until sold comparatively recently to Mason Mosher, the present owner, the property was owned many years by Mrs Marian Balmat Wright, city, widow of Hiram J Wright, prominent contractor and builder.\n\nIt was during the Wright possession that some old newspapers were found in a partition which seemed to indicate vintage of the War of 1812 period, but whether the first owner was George Brown of Perch River, Josiah Bonney or George Bonney is the mysterious question.\n\nIt was on March 7 1911 that Mrs Wright purchased the farm from the late Joseph A and Addie E Hinds. It consisted of one parcel of 234.42 acres less a plot of 31.92 acres, and two small parcels, and plus a parcel of 62.5 acres. Mr and Mrs Hinds acquired it from Msgr. Cornelius J Crowley, now deceased, November 3 1909 and it was in the Crowley ownership from December 7 1897 the Misses Mary and Marion Crowley, city; Miss Nellie Crowley and Mrs Margaret Bowes of Worcester, Massachusetts, and John P Crowley of Flushing being sisters and brother. Prior to that the place had been owned by Constantine Ganter, by Mrs Harriet A Adams, by the Lester S Boynton estate, Mr Bovnton.having bought it from Benjamin Helmer March 26 1894. Mr Helmer bid it in May 5 1873 in foreclosure by Alta E and Aswell C Bonney, minors, vs. Marcellotte Chawgo, administratrix of Abner Chawgo. Chawgo had in turn purchased it from these two plaintiffs April 1 1868 and given them a mortgage in the transaction.\n\nThe April 1 1868 deed to Chawgo mentions the 234.42-acre plot as surveyed December 10 1861 by Alexander Brown, stating that the survey covers two parcels deeded by George and Josiah Bonney to Walter Bonney January 12 1850. Those two parcels consisted of 107.71 acres and 55 acres, the first of which was sold to Josiah Bonney for $619.88 by Henry G Wisner, Goshen, NY, on October 1 1824 and the second one of 55 acres by Mr Wisner to Josiah for $220 on September 1 1829.\n\nThe Chawgo deed of April 1 1868 states that about one acre had been sold off the north end of the farm to Nathan Smith, and .94 of an acre on the west side of the road from the stone church to the widow of Josiah Bonney some time before Chawgo bought the place.\n\nFurthermore, Mrs Betsey M Bonney, widow, on April 1 1868 quitclaimed her right to the remainder of the 234.42 acres.\n\nFrom all this the inference might be drawn that the 107.71 acres and 55 acres bought by Josiah Bonney from Wisner are part of the 234.42 acres and that Bonney built the stone house over 120 years ago. However, Mrs Wright states that the house is on the 62.5-acre plot, which did not become a part of the present farm until March 22 1899 when Rodney H and Martha E Pierce sold it to Mr Ganter for $1,562.50 which throws a different complexion on the origin of the house.\n\nMr Pierce bought this tract from Martin and Maggie Schrodt June 7 1892. They got it from Peter A Helbock December 31 1881. Chester and Catherine Jane Parish sold it to Helbock January 31 1866 and they got it from George Brown, P R, April 4 1860. Brown had bought 108.26 acres in this locale from Henry G Wisner October 1 1824. Did he build this house about that time? Today it stands a shell, the interior having been torn out years ago in an effort to remodel. In the basement were a large kitchen fireplace and bake-oven. If Josiah Bonney built the house, it should be said that he, native of Cape Cod, came to Brownville in 1808 served at Sackets Harbor in the War of 1812 married Betsey Morse of Vermont and died in 1848 at 61.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nLUKE DUNLAY HOUSE IN TOWN OF CAPE VINCENT\n\nImage BELOW...a possibility.

It is on the road which leads off the Cape Vincent-Clayton river road about a mile west of Millen's Bay.\n\nIt is owned by Louis E Doyle, a Cape Vincent farmer, who purchased it and the small farm which goes with it from the estate of William J and Helen R Constance Dunlay, September 21 1946. It has been unoccupied for some time, Mrs Dunlay having died May 3 1942 and her husband in 1913.\n\nThe farm consists of 74.88 acres built up of three parcels, two of which are exact halves of 49.88 acres and title to it was in reality acquired by William J Dunlay from the estate of his father, Luke Dunlay. To make the title good William J Dunlay, as executor of Luke Dunlay's estate, conveyed the place to Victor L Gosier March 10 1900.\n\nTen days later Victor L and Katie Gosier transferred it back to William J Dunlay individuals for $2,938. Luke Dunlay bought the south half of the 49.88-acre parcel from Mary Barrois March 8 1869 for $2,000. She in turn acquired it from John Claude Barrois November 30 1868 and Mr Barrois purchased it from John Branche March 17 1857. Mr Branche in turn got it from Vincent LeRay February 15 1853.\n\nThe north half of this tract was bought By Luke Dunlay from Benjamin Jackson and wife, Hannah, for $1,600 on May 14 1884. It was sold to Mr Jackson by James Carvin October 3 1883 and Mr Carvin purchased it from Vincent LeRay on January 8 1857.\n\nThe other 25-acre tract was bought by Luke Dunlay from George Wegman on September 26 1872. As for the year of construction of this house, which is of native limestone obtained in the area and along simple cottage architectural lines, it is apparently more than a century old, but the name of the original owner is not now known to members of the Dunlay family.\n\nIt may well have been built for Calvin Wright, who acquired a small acreage in that same vicinity from James Parish in 1850 and sold two years later to Terry Connell. If so, it is believed that Mr Connell and his wife, Sally, sold it to Richard Connell, who in turn conveyed it to James E Connell.\n\nIn any event this stone house, in which several members of the Dunlay family were born since 90 years ago, is one of the old and substantial ones in the town of Cape Vincent, and its walls are of a sturdiness promising good restoration possibilities.\n\nLuke Dunlay and his wife, Margaret Russell Dunlay, were natives of County Cork, Ireland and came to the United States in the forepart of the last century, settling in the town of Cape Vincent, where they followed the occupation of farming. One of their children was the late William J Dunlay who succeeded to the ownership of this farm. Another son of Mr and Mrs Luke Dunlay was the late Jay P Dunlay who died at the age of 81 on April 21 of this year. His wife was the former Miss Evadena Lucy Mance and they resided for a time in this house. There one of their three children, Miss Margaret T Dunlay, city, was born.

One may reasonably conjecture that Benjamin Cole built this house before August 7 1837 for it was on that date he and his wife, Charlotte, sold this 180.01 acres and buildings to Walter Fox. On June 18 1838 Fox purchased an adjoining 1.49 acres from Isaac and Betsey Shimmel for $64.50. Then on October 29 1800 he bought another adpacent parcel of 45.95 acres from William C and Mary Gould for $250.\n\nThese three parcels constitute the farm as it is today, but there was an additional parcel of 50 acres, purchased on March 30 1855 by Walter Fox from Nelson and Mary A Jenkins for a nominal sum, which parcel was later sold off.\n\nBecause of the fact that Benjamin Cole received $5,402 from Walter Fox for the 180.09 acres the house must have been upon the farm at that time. And in all likelihood it was erected for Cole at some earlier period.\n\nHowever, Walter and Ruth Fox sold the property to John Dorr November 1 1865 for $14,336. Fifteen years later, on February 6 1880 John and Amelia Dorr, town of Clayton, disposed of the place to the late Constantine Ganter of the town of Pamelia for $7,250. From that time to this, a mailer of more than 71 years, the farm, which lies a short distance outside Pamelia Four Corners on the road running towards Perch Lake, has been owned by the Ganter family. On March 1 1900 Constantine and Mary Ganter conveyed it to thejr son, the late Rubert H Ganter, for a nominal consideration. Then on February 24 1906 Rubert H and Metta E Ganter transferred it to George F Ganter for $1. George F Ganter died March 15 1946 he having moved here from the farm in 1919. Next Charles F Ganter, Syracuse, as executor of the estate of George F Ganter, sold the property to himself and is still the owner.\n\nConstantine Ganter was born in Tutlingen, Wittenberg, Germany, May 17 1847 son of Lukas and Katharine Honer Ganter. He received his education in the schools of Germany. At 20 he came in 1867 to settle near LaFargeville, having already learned the wagonmaker's trade. After his arrival he worked for farmers for a time in that area and then leased this farm, which later he bought in 1880. Still later he acquired other farms and other properties, and in 1903 turned this farm over to his son and moved into this city to devote his attention to real estate, joining with Silas D Ball to form the firm of Ball & Ganter.\n\nOn October 12 1871 Mr Ganter married Miss Anna Zimmcr, a native of LaFargeville, she having been born October 20 1848. Their children were Rubert H, Frederick, George F and Nellie.\n\nThe name of Ganter was onetime attached to the limburger cheese industry of the county, once noted for the quality and quantity of this product. Walter Fox, born in Herkimer county June 12 1838 was a son of Benjamin and Margaret A McNeal Fox, both of Herkimer county. Waller Fox was educated in common and select schools and at the age of 20 removed to Alexandria Bay and entered the employ of H Sisson, merchant. In 1863 he formed a partnership with Sisson, whom he bought out in 1884 after remaining in the store 38 years. Mr Fox married Miss Maria A Hastings in 1865 and they had one daughter who became the wife of the late Dr James Monroe Smith, city.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\n11938 Bishop St Road\n\nApproximately a century old is this huge frame house built for William Pitt Davis on that straight stretch of highway known as Bishop Street in the town of Henderson. Next to the 232-acre farm upon which it stands was the birthplace of George Peck, nationally-famed for many decades as the author of that humorous book, \"Peck's Bad Boy,\" and editor of a newspaper titled \"Peck's Sun.\"\n\nWith its church, school, saw and grist mills, tannery and cluster of houses Bishop Street, in its hey-dey long ago, was a thriving community in itself. And it was on this thoroughfare that Roswell Davis, father of William Pitt Davis, established his farm when, as a young man of 26 he came from his native Lunenburg, Vermont, in 1811. Reputed to have been the first tavern-keeper in the town of Henderson, Roswell Davis, who died in 1848 at the age of 63 was also one of its most historic figures.\n\nSeveral times he was called out to service in the War of 1812 and that service found him at the battles of Sackets Harbor and Big Sandy, as well as participating in that colorful but arduous jaunt in the carrying of the frigate \"Superior's\" huge hempen cable from the mouth of Big Sandy, a distance of 20 miles, in June, 1814 to Sackets Harbor where Henry Eckford was completing the \"Superior\" for Commodore Isaac Chauncey's American battle fleet.\n\nAbout 1840 Roswell Davis also became the owner of the Reuben Putnam farm, in the house upon which was held March 11 1806 the first town meeting after Henderson was set off from the town of Ellisburg, February 17 of that year. In his will executed July 2 1846 Roswell Davis gave to his son, William Pitt Davis, \"all my homestead farm containing about 50 acres upon the East side of the highway running from Bishop Street in Henderson aforesaid to Smithville.\"\n\nThe wife of Roswell Davis was Clarissa Bishop and among their children besides William Pitt Davis were Albert K Davis, a Cleveland, Ohio, lawyer, and Horatio Nelson Davis, who was the father of the famed United States Senator Cushman Kellogg Davis of Minnesota, born in the town of Henderson June 16 1838. William Pitt Davis, born in Henderson town in 1826 original owner of this big house and farm which has never since been out of possession of the Davis family,was a picturesque and adventurous man, who joined the great California gold rush in 1849. He went by way of the Isthmus of Panama, remained a little more than a year, returned to become a Smithville merchant for a short time and then to build this house and establish himself on this Bishop Street farm.\n\nHe married Miss Ermina Eliza Smith, daughter of Harvey and Sarah Bell Smith. On April 21 1851 William Pitt Davis conveyed to the Sackets Harbor & Ellisburg Railroad company a strip of land 1,594 feet long, 1811 acres in area and three rods wide, for a right of way across his farm. Today, some distance to the rear of this big house, can be plainly seen where the tracks were.\n\nAs the years progressed William Pitt Davis acquired several tracts of land in the town of Henderson and he amassed substantial wealth. Jointly, with Arthur J Armstrong, he purchased from Shubel H and Matilda Stevens on April 1 1874 between 60 and 70 acres constituting the islands known as Sixtown Point, with right of way. One of these islands with hunting camp is still known as Davis island and is owned by Attorneys Stanford H and Wesley L Waite of this city, George and Lila Bull and Ernest Shaad, Belleville.\n\nUpon his retirement William Pitt Davis moved into a little house at Henderson Harbor, getting his meals at the Hotel de Snow. On June 14 1906 he fell off a dock and drowned leaving an estate estimated at $10,000 personalty and $26,000 realty. By his will, executed April 6 of that year, he provided that his nephew, Arthur W Davis, Battle Creek, Michigan, son of Albert K Davis, should have a 100-acre farm at St. Charles, Michigan, and 3,000 shares of Dexter Mining & Development company stock.\n\nThe Universalist church of Henderson was given $1,000. This big Bishop Street house and farm went to Edward C B Davis, Detroit, present owner and son of Arthur W Davis. For the past eight years Dewey Phillips has been tenant and C A Whittier, Adams, manager. There were other bequests, and residuary legatees were Amasa Hungerford and Laura Littlefield, nephew and niece of testator who, with his wife, Ermina Eliza Davis, is buried in Elmwood cemetery, Adams.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nOn a quiet country road off the beaten path near Millen's Bay is this almost century-old native limestone farmhouse of Xavier Chevalier, a name which in later years was changed in county history and in records of the county clerk's office to Swallia and Swalia.\n\nThe Chevalier family was of French origin, but came to Jefferson County from the Province of Quebec. Peter Chevalier, born in the latter province, married Catharine Marcott there, removed to the town of Cape Vincent and died there at the age of 40. Their children were Peter, Mary, Frances, Josephine, Eliza, Zoe and Xavier, all probably born in Canada.\n\nAt least history records that Xaxier was, that he located on old road 18 in the town of Cape Vincent and married Sarah, daughter of Nicholas and Elizabeth Cornaire. By occupation they were thrifty Cape Vincent farmers. It is said that they built this house about 1854 but it is likely that they erected it two years earlier than that.\n\nThe farm, upon which it stands, consists of 108.25 acres composed of two parcels. The first of these was bought by Xavier Chevalier on January 27 1852 from Vincent LeRay through the latter's attorney, Patrick Somerville Stewart, for $395.70 and it is probable the stone house was constructed shortly thereafter. The second parcel of 50.86 acres was bought by Mr Chevalier for $141.12 from James LeRay de Chaumont, Marquis de St. Paul, through Patrick Somerville Stewart on February 22 1860. The two parcels adjoin each other and this farm, maintained in trim and excellent condition in its pleasant setting, is now owned by Malcolm E Bates Sr, and wife, Mrs Edna Bates.\n\nXavier Chevalier, whose will bears the name Swalia indicating that he must have changed it to that, died in the town of Cape Vincent November 22,1900 leaving his widow Sarah the life-use of his 50-acre Malar farm and providing that his children should share equally eventually in all of his real and personal property. His property was valued at $9,600 and his children were: John, Rosiere; Joseph, Chetek, Wisconsin; Harriet Aubertine, Rosiere; Clarissa Doyle, Marysville, Ontario; Julia M Kitts, Riverview; Mary Kimmes, Rosiere, and Carrie Mason, Rosiere.\n\nOn October 8 1901 these children and their spouses sold this farm for $5,412 to Adelbert B Kitts, town of Cape Vincent, husband of Julia, and the property became known as the Kitts farm\n\nJulia Margaret Chevalier was born in the township June 5 1854. In January, 1874 she was married to Augustus Charles. To them was born one daughter, Sophia, who became the wife of Marcel S Blanche. Mr Charles died in 1884 and on February 14 1888 his widow was married to Adelbert B Kitts. No children were born to them. Mr Kitts died April 6 1919 and his wife on May 6 1935.\n\nThis farm and stone house then went to her only child, Mrs Sophia E Blanche who, on March 24 1936 sold it to Mr and Mrs Bates, Mrs Blanche's husband, Marcel S Branche, having quitclaimed his interest in the property to her on that same day.\n\nMrs Branche, the former Sophia Charles, was married to Marcel S Branche at Rosiere September 5 1899 and two years ago they celebrated their golden wedding.\n\nOne of their five children, Lewis V Branche, has recently served as supervisor of the town of Cape Vincent. Malcolm E Bates, present owner of this property, is the son of Martin Bates and graduate of the Cape Vincent High school. On December 25 1923 he was married to Miss Edna Babcock, daughter of Mrs G W Babcock, at Glen Park. She is a graduate of the Brownville-Glen Park High school and the Northern Business school of this city. Prior to her marriage she was employed in the office of the Shaughnessy Knitting company. They have a son, Malcolm E Bates Jr\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nThis house is now gone.\n\nThe 1864 Map\n\nThe 1888 Map\n\nBuilt probably well over a century ago by Daniel Bartholomew 2.8 miles from this city on the 101.51-acre farm now owned and occupied by Mr and Mrs Donald S Burns on the Watertown-Brownville, or Coffeen Street road, this bouse has the distinction of being on land of the town of Watertown's first settler.\n\nThat settler was Deacon Oliver Bartholomew, native of Connecticut and Revolutionary war veteran, who had contracted for the land in October 1799. In March 1800 he came on to settle it, Historian Hamilton Child giving the location as1.5 miles from the village of Brownville which location Avell matches the 1.3-mile measurement made by Mr Burns.\n\nDeacon Baratholomew, characterized one of the most exemplary and industrious settlers, came simultaneously with Henry Coffeen and Zachariah Butlerficld, first two permanent seltlers of what is now the city of Watertown. These three, Bartholomew, Coffeen and Butterfield with their families were the only settlers to stay through the winter of 1800-1801.\n\nTheir coming was coincidental with the setting off from Mexico March 11 1800 of the town of Watertown, first known as Leghorn or No. 2 of the Eleven Towns. The next year, 1801 the \"Deacan\" engaged to build a bridge across the river at Brownville that south shore settlers might trade at the store, grist and saw mills of Jacob Brown near Philomel creek. The bridge was finished in 1802 but washed out in 1806 and rebuilt.\n\nDean Baratholomew was a familiar figure on Brownville Streets and conducted Sabbath worship before the formation of a religious society there. He died June 18 1850 aged 92. His wife, Anna, had predeceased him and his residuary estate went to his sons and Daniel Bartholomew.\n\nWhen Deacan Bartholomew came to settle his wilderness land he built a log cabin, said to have been located close to the Brownville road and just west of the present driveway of Mr Burns. May 11 1815 Deacon Bartholmew took title to this farm from Nicholas and Alice Low, of New York City, for $294. On December 22 1825 the \"Deacon\" and wife conveyed it to Daniel and Oliver Bartholomew Jr, for $1,700. Oliver Bartholomew Jr, and wife, Mary, deeded their interest in it to Daniel May 21 1839 for $600 and on December 4 1856 Daniel and Sarah G Bartholomew sold theplace to David H Nellis, town of Alexandria, for $5,000.\n\nUndoubtedly this 14-room house, with its original small-paned windows, some of the original doors and thumb-latches, was in existence then and probably had been since shortly after 1839.\n\nOn January 23 1866 David H and Olive A Nellis disposed of this property to Mary Yale of Watertown for $5,000 and May 22 1886 she sold to Simeon Allison, town of Brownville, for $6,800. Simeon and Helen Allison deeded it to Mrs Winnie E Cole, town of Pamelia, February 26 1906. By the provisions of her will recorded May 4 1937 the old Bartholomew farm and all her real estate went jointly to her three children, Mis. Lloyd H (Ella G) Niles, Pamelia; William J Cole, Watertown, and Mrs Bert (Sadie C) Walrath, Chaumont.\n\nThey sold it to Donald S Burns and wife, Ada O Burns, city on September 22 1939 and they make their permanent residence there, treating it as a country estate, in which they have done considerable landscaping. Mr Burns, assistant engineer in District 7 state highway department, is secretary-treasurer of the Men's Garden club of Watertown. Mrs Burns is past president of the Women's Garden club of Watertown. She was the former Miss Ada Olmstead, daughter of Mr and Mrs Herbert B Olmstead of Auburn. Mr Burns is son of Mr and Mrs Harvey Burns, late of this city. Mr and Mrs Burns call attention to the old cut nails and wooden dowels used in construction of the woodwork of their house, to the ancient construction of the old barn, and to a pair of fire tongs excavated by Mr Burns in his garden.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nDue to its extensive limestone deposits the town of Pamelia claims one of the largest collections of old stone houses in Jefferson County. One of these is the now vacant structure of cottage type constructed probably about 115 years ago. On the so-called Parrish road which runs toward Perch lake from the Bradley Street road at a point about six miles outside this city, it sets on high ground far back from the main highway to command a view across the broad and beautiful valley that stretches before it.\n\nSon of a veteran of the American Revolution, who was captured by the Indians, taken to Canada and sold for whiskey and afterward married a girl named Smith, John tailing was born at St. Johnsville, Montgomery county. He was born in 1812 and came to this county about 1820\n\nHis wife was the former Catherine Elwood and they had five sons and three daughters.\n\nOn March 1 1865 John and Catherine Failing sold their 237-acre farm on the Parrish road, (so named for John L Parrish who had a large stone house there which still stands in excellent condition ) to Daniel Gould for $10,480. The deed states that part of this farm was conveyed to Failing April 16 1835 by Daniel Fox and part of it by Washington and Stephanie Coster, New York City, on the following day.\n\nFor the 109.76 acres bought from Daniel W and Betsey Fox on April 16 1835 Failing paid $1,500 and for the 66.26-acre and 54.46-acre parcels which he purchased from the Costers the following day he paid $1,156.98. They were surveyed in 1809 by Cadwallader Child.\n\nAn April 14 1857 Failing bought a 5.47-acre parcel from Allen G Mathewson of Providence, RI, and there were excepted from the farm two parcels of two and three acres.\n\nDaniel Gould, born near Rutland, Vermont, in 1802 son of John Gould who became one of the early settlers of the town of Pamelia, kept the Failing farm until June 21 1884 when he conveyed it to Madison J Gould of Pamelia for $400 \"and other good and sufficient consideration.\" Then on November 23 1886 Madison J and Lillian Gould sold the property to Joshua Flanders, wealthy Rodman farmer and hay-buyer. Joshua and Stevannah Klock Flanders disposed of the farm to Ball & Ganter, prominent Watertown real estate operators on November 1 1911 and on February 15 1913 they sold it to S Harold Gates, of Adams, the present owner. Evidently there was a cheese factory upon the farm in the early days, for the deed from Madison J Gould and Daniel Gould to Mr Flanders states that only a third interest in this factory is conveyed. Today no cheese factory stands upon the farm, but there is a long and high limestone foundation but a few rods from the old house which may be the ruins of that factory. It is recalled that Joshua Flanders, owner of the farm for 25 years and father of former county Treasurer Earl K Flanders, was at one time so interested in the vaudeville business in this city that he built the former Ornheum theater on Polk Street in 1907 and at the same time paved that street. That theater building has for many years been a storage plant of the W A Sullivan Lumber company on the same street.\n\nSon of Gideon and Mary Snell Flanders, Joshua Flanders was born m the town of Orleans October 3 1852 and died in the town of Rodman March 9 1936. His wife, the former Stevannah Klock born in the town of Lyme April 24 1852 was married to him April 27 1877 and died January 13 1945. She was the daughter of Stephen and Anna Klock.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nEnvironed by a spacious lot of slightly more than an acre, beautifully landscaped with striking flower gardens at the rear, handsome shrubbery and fine old trees on its broad carpet of lawn at the front, is the residence of Mr and Mrs Clyde Lansing Harvey at 126 Paddock Street.\n\nBuilt about 1853 almost a century ago by John Leonard Baker, it remains one of the outstanding old single residence properties in the city. The lot, upon which it stands was purchased by Mr Baker January 21 1853 from Oscar Paddock, Edwin L Paddock and wife, Olive A Paddock, owners of much of the land in that sector of the city's best residential area. In 1865 and 1867 Mr Baker expanded his grounds by acquiring the lots on either side, and until Mr and Mrs Harvey purchased the place from Bernard A Gray, January 12 1950 it was out of the ownership of the Baker family but a few months from the time the house was built.\n\nSon of Jonathan Baker, one of the earliest pioneers of the town of Watertown, John Leonard Baker was born November 26 1824 on his father's farm atop the Baker hill a short distance outside the eastern bounds of this city. He attended district school and worked on the farm until May 1844 when he became clerk in the old Franklin house which stood east of the archway on part of the site of the present Hotel Woodruff. Failing health inspired him to join the crew of a fishing smack August 11 1845 on a 120-day cruise off the Grand Banks for cod, and on his return he became a clerk in the local dry goods store of Truman Keeler. In 1849 he joined Jackson F Woodruff in buying Gilbert Woodruff's grocery at 5 Exchange block. The store burned May 13 of that year and in August, 1852 he sold his interest to his partner joining Keeler in the firm of Keeler and Baker.\n\nIn 1853 John L Baker sold out to his partner, made a trip west, returned to Watertown, became superintendent for J Ball & Company trenching for the Watertown water works. Supervising the construction of the Jersey City waterworks in 1854 he took contract the next year to build the waterworks in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. For five years and seven months beginning June 6 1856 he was Watertown water commissioner and in 1860 built the water pumping main from Beebee's island to William Street. The next year he opened a ticket and insurance office here, bought in 1862 the business of McComb & Chittenden, manufacturers of cigars and dealers in hunting and angling goods. In May 1863 T C Chittenden became his partner. On October 4 1848 Mr Baker married Miss Cornelia Lydia Hewitt.\n\nMr Baker became a director of the Jefferson County Savings bank that year. In 1864 he became undersheriff under Sheriff Nathan Strong and also served under Sheriffs James Johnson and A W Wheelock. He was elected a director and vice president of the Black River Insurance company in March 1872 became undersheriff to Sheriff George Babbitt in 1874 dissolved partnership with Chittenden in 1879 and was joined in business by his son, Frank L Baker. The latter, a graduate of Hope college and civil engineer of the old Sackets Harbor & Watertown Railroad company, incidentally was a founder and first treasurer of the Watertown Electric Light company in 1885.\n\nUpon the death of John Leonard Baker April 12 1883 Frank L Baker acquired an interest in this house, and following his death October 28 1895 that interest went to his two sisters, the Misses Amelia A and Alice M Baker, who owned and resided in the house for many years, during which they took especial pride in their flower garden and accumulated a fine collection of photographs of old stone houses in the county. Miss Amelia A Baker died March 9 1935 aged 83 her sister, Alice M Baker, then becoming sole owner of the house. At 86 she died September 10 1949 willing it to Mr Gray. It is of interest that Jonathan Baker, native of Keene, New Hampshire, whose wife was Dorcas Fellows of Sherburne, Massachusetts, came here February 13 1800 and found the cabins of Henry Coffeen and Zachariah Butterfield, disproving the historical statement that the latter came in March 1800.\n\nMr Harvey, native of Martinsburg, graduate of Syracuse university, is, an attorney and for several years high school principal and superintendent of schools at Hoosic Falls. Mrs Harvey, the former Miss Eunice Louise Bagg, graduate of Rogers Hall, Lowell, Massachusetts, is the daughter of the late Samuel F Bagg, native of Utica, graduate of Hamilton college, and for many years secretary-treasurer of the Watertown Steam Engine company.\n\n<<< Back to Master List >>>\n\nRoswell Petlibone Flower, born a poor boy in the village of Theresa August 8 1833 died suddenly at the Long Island Country club, Eastport, Long Island May 12 1899. He was rated 25 times a millionaire and the only native north coun tryman to have served a full elected term as governor of New York state. Like Silas Wright of Canton, chosen governor of this state at an earlier date, he was a Democrat, but Governor Wright was a native Vermonter. Head of the investment house of R P Flower & company Governor Flower had for some years been king of Wall Street at the lime of his death. Former congressman who had defeated William Waldorf Astor, he was New York state's one-time Democratic leader who had also been mentioned for the presidency. Master financier and major philanthropist he was Watertown's most distinguished citizen. As such his daughter, the late Mrs Emma Flower Taylor, cast his memory in permanency with her gift to Watertown of the Roswell P Flower Memorial library while thefamed sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens deftly recreated his robust physique in ageless bronze.\n\nAnd there still stands at 175 Arsenal Street, the big white house that was for long years his residence and which had originally been owned by his noted father-inlaw, Norris W Woodruff, powerful figure in Watertown's life a century and a quarter ago and builder of Watertown's leading hostelry, the Hotel Woodruff a century ago. This Arsenal Street mansion, owned for 22 years by Jefferson County presents a dignified and little changed exterior while inside it houses the county's juvenile court, board of elections, grand jury, and probation department.\n\nUpon the site of the Flower mansion there once stood a stone house, which Russell and Nancy Sherman sold on March 31 1828 to Norris Woodruff for $2,500. April 10 1824 Sherman had bought the 133-square rod lot from Solomon White. The ensuing November 28 Solomon and Lucy White sold an adjoining vacant lot to Woodruff for $265.\n\nOn January 22 1829 Woodruff expanded his grounds further with a still larger parcel purchased from the Whites for $500.\n\nIt is likely that shortly afterward Norris M Woodruff, native of Litchfield county, Connecticut, replaced the stone house with a more pretentious frame house that became the nucleus of the Flower mansion, for after Governor Flower came into control of it he expanded and improved it extensively.\n\nOwner of 75 per cent of the north side of Public Square, Norris M Woodruff, partner of John Jacob Astor in a Green Bay, Wisconsin, land deal, president of the old Jefferson County bank 15 years, veteran cavalryman of the War of 1812 former chief of the Watertown Volunteer Fire department, died January 16 1857.\n\nHis widow, the former Miss Roxana Terry Bush whom he had married October 5 1817 a few years after the death of Woodruff, became the wife of Judge Stephen Strong and July 28 1862 the Woodruff estate quitclaimed to her its interest in this house. In Mrs Strong's will dated July 13 1876 and recorded December 28 1883 she gave this house and contents to her daughter, Mrs Sarah M Woodruff Flower, wife of Governor Roswell P Flower. In turn Mrs Flower in her will executed December 3 1907 and recorded March 28 1929 gave this property and furnishings to her"
