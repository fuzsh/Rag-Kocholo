I was lucky enough to have been invited to adjudicatethe event, and the turnout was wonderful. Four and one half years ago I was invitedover to Belgium the first time as a show steward, and at the First European Nationalsthere were around 6 total Shetlands. Well that has changed a great deal! This was oneof their smaller shows and I believe there were 12 total Shetlands there and numerouswonderful Miniature Horses. Europe you are doing such a great job bringing in someof the top bloodlines into your countries!The people are wonderful and the show team there had wonderful games and conteststhat were played and enjoyed by the exhibitors. What could they win? A breeding to astallion (very nice I might add) and also a photoshoot from a top European photographer.To those that donated THANK YOU! The comradery over there is outstanding. Nowthe question what is the game? It’s called the match the judge’s card game. The firstone was done for the Liberty Class, and the second game was for a color class! Youpaid for your chance to win! Kind of a great idea for us here in the US, HINT HINT!Here is everyone at the rail ready to be their own judges hoping to win!The exciting news is that next year is the 5th Annual European Nationals and it will beheld in Belgium once again and put on by the American Miniature Horse Friends. Inthe 4 years they have had this show they went from 97 horses in year one to 140+ lastyear. The growth is outstanding!Finally I want to welcome a new committee member. Kevin Lathouwers from Belgiumwas asked a while back by myself and declined because he will be inviting a new littleone into his family very soon! While talking to him again he agreed, and he has somewonderful ideas that I hope we can share with you in the future!I wish everyone well! The shows are pretty much all over, and it is time to think aboutthe future!
