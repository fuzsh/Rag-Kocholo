It held trams of every description, many decrepit and obviously out of use for a long time, but also there were ones like the picture in the advertisement.\n\n\"All these 'ere are two pounds.\" said Alf. \"You can 'ave whichever you likes.\"\n\nSo Wilfred and his older brother, Duncan, bought a tram. How they came to do so, and all that happened to them after that, Wilfred relates, although, as he says, this is \"a story which starts in a world now vanished\".\n\nIn some ways, Wilfred's vanished world is the rosy world of childhood memory. In the 1920s and 1930s, Wilfred and Duncan grew up in a big house in Sussex, cycled the countryside, camped, hunted small animals, collected butterflies and dreamed of owning a tram like the one they had seen advertised in the Daily Mail. But illness, family breakdown and war changed all that.\n\nFamiliar as this scenario might seem, this is no commonplace story. Duncan suffers a bout of meningitis which leaves him dumb, and he and Wilfred learn to communicate through their own sign language; the boys' mother drives off in her Hispano-Suiza car and disappears from their lives, and their father take up with \"a succession of ladies\", none of whom like the boys. Then, in early 1937, Hitler walks into Austria: and Pale Clouded Yellow butterflies invade the Sussex fields. In pursuit of butterflies, the boys trespass on a nearby property and are seized by the gardener and hauled before the owner, Mr Schwayder, who is German. But this is not a spy story.\n\nAs a result of all these events, the boys (now young teenagers) decide to be independent. They scrape together their meagre savings, leave home, and go to London to buy a tram. What they will do with their chosen tram once they have it, they have not considered, let alone how they will get a tram out of the depot without tracks and wires. Alf, the tram-depot foreman, saves their dream by offering them an ancient horse-tram - a 'penny-bumper' - which has wheels which can be taken on the road. And, in a tour of the Acton totters' yards ['totters' were the London rag-and-bone collectors], the boys find an ancient draught horse, used to hauling coal, whose owner no longer wants it.\n\nSo, with the tram comes, first, Homer (the horse) and his inseparable companion, Tiger, the dog; then Hattie, a girl of about the boys' own age; then, by chance, a private tram-line in Worthing; followed by bombs, unofficial signalling duties, a German bomber seemingly shot down by Duncan's catapult, a letter from Winston Churchill, and a visit from the King and Queen.\n\nAll of this sounds fantastic, but the charm of this story is that it could all, just possibly, be true. William Newton tells it so simply and so plausibly that you end up wanting to search for corroborative evidence. And if you do so, I'm sure you will find some, although the details may not be sufficient for you to verify Wilfred's version of events.\n\nWhether the story is truth or fantasy, however, is not important. It is a wonderful story, told by a story-teller who, if nothing else, can embroider facts so imaginatively that you suspend disbelief. It reads like a memoir, and it captures with deceptive simplicity and humour, the adventure, optimism, delights and disappointments of the vanished world of youth. It is a pleasure to read.\n\nHarbor\n\nLorraine Adams\n\nAlfred A Knopf\n\n201 E 50th St, New York, NY 10022\n\nISBN 1400042332X, $23.95, 292 pp.\n\nColetta Ollerer\n\nReviewer\n\nA tale with three prongs: The escape from a life in a homeland that was so desperate, so horrifying that it made the lonely and dreadful prospect of becoming a stowaway look attractive. The frightening and solitary life of an alien in the USA. The terrifying awareness of an illegal that he might be of interest to Federal agencies.\n\nIn several flashbacks we are taken into the military experiences of Aziz in Algeria including the brutal killing of a woman, and his unending fear of being tortured himself by his own comrades and superiors as he watched others in the throes of agony. He trusts no one. \"Now there was nothing Antar (the local warlord) did not believe was his right. There were those among Antar's men who took to depravity the way birds take to air. They had imaginations bloated with ways to inflict suffering, and they saw the permutated hell of their nighttimes as an underground heaven they had never hoped to enter.\" (p157) This was the atmosphere that drove Aziz to escape his country.\n\nHe manages to get back to his family and intends to leave the country but his inability to get the proper papers from his government forces him to take the risk of becoming a stowaway. He is dirty, hungry, cold and without the native language when he drags himself onshore in Boston. A stroke of good fortune brings him to the attention of an Egyptian whose Arabic tongue allows him to provide help. Aziz manages to get in touch with a friend, Rafik, from Algeria who he knows is living in Boston. Rafik is glad to hear from him and he invites him to live at his flat. He knows he must be careful when dealing with Rafik who is known to be untrustworthy but this relationship is the only one he feels comfortable with in Boston. Illegals come and go at Rafik's apartment.\n\nAziz' lack of language skills and his unsettled background left him feeling isolated. He doesn't understand a lot of what is going on \"Mostly, he had no one to discuss most things with, so their weight and importance were all too often equal. Anything could matter. Anything could be anything.\" (p65) He watches people closely in an attempt to better understand this place. He feels invisible but lucky because he is here and not in Algiers where terror is the order of the day.\n\nThe federal agents have numerous meetings to determine if they have a case against Aziz and others who pass through Rafik's apartment in Boston. They decide to arrest them. Those arrested are people who fled the fear and intimidation of life in Algeria only to find themselves faced with anxiety and suspicion in the land they hoped would give them a chance of refuge. The story gives us a glimpse into the lives of these unfortunates and into the Federal agencies charged with their surveillance.\n\nThe Devil in the White City\n\nErik Larson\n\nRandom House Inc.\n\nISBN: 0375725601 $14.95 464 pages\n\nCraig McAndrew\n\nReviewer\n\nHeard the one about the architect and the serial killer? It's not a bad joke, but it is a great book. The architect was Daniel Burnham, the driving force behind the Chicago World's Fair of 1893; the killer was H.H. Holmes, a Svengali-type figure who lured young women to his hotel and did the most gruesome things, the least shocking of which was murder. The two men never met, but The Devil in the White City brings their stories together, and although it reads like a novel, everything is thoroughly researched fact.\n\nThe book:\n\nThe Great Columbian Exhibition of 1893 was Chicago's big chance to shake off its old image as a hog-slaughtering, dirty and dangerous town and to take its place as America's second city. Although the fair's theme gave a backward nod to the 400th anniversary of Columbus bumping into the Americas on his way to India, its vision was futuristic: for the first time, electric lighting, clean water, and planned green spaces could be experienced on a massive scale. Innovations - the Ferris Wheel, the hamburger, an elevated railway, Juicy Fruit gum, the zip fastener and shredded wheat among them - enhanced the feeling that the next century would belong to America. The buildings were monumental, the exhibits eclectic (one example: a map of the USA made entirely of pickles) and the visitors were awestruck. They called it the White City, from the colour of main buildings that were imposing by day, dazzling by night.\n\nMuch of this was down to Daniel Burnham. His can-do reputation for building skyscrapers made him a natural choice as project manager. But we're frequently reminded that he had to push himself to the limit and step on quite few toes to ensure the Fair's success, a job made all the more difficult by economic recession, bickering architects, striking workers, pompous politicians and Chicago's notorious weather.\n\nAs if all this weren't enough to occupy the reader, a parallel story takes us inside the grim world of H.H. Holmes. Capitalising on the advent of the Fair, Holmes built his own hotel to attract single young women who were streaming into the city from across America in search of work, independence and a new life in the big city. One such unfortunate believed she was on the threshold of marriage to this enchanting gentleman; in reality, she was destined for a gas chamber in the hotel basement. She was not to be the last to fall for his charms, but even in death there was no rest. Holmes literally picked over the bones of his victims, selling their remains to medical students eager to examine recently deceased corpses - no questions asked. At first, the benefit for Holmes was financial, but as time passed, the chase, the kill, the post mortem had become ends in themselves. A single-minded detective and a stroke of luck brought Holmes to justice, but even when he realised the game was up, he managed to keep his unsettling cool.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI had a strong feeling that I would take to this book, and from start to finish I was never disappointed. It fairly zings along, both stories proving absorbing, while casting out facts like frisbees.\n\nAlthough Burnham and Holmes are the book's dominant characters, there are walk-on parts for numerous figures who made their own mark on the White City. Buffalo Bill, Thomas Edison, and Scott Joplin are among the famous names, and the description of George Ferris's efforts to debut his eponymous wheel is a story in itself. But the lesser-known characters are also worthy of note. I pitied poor Frederick Olmsted's attempts to landscape the exhibition in the midst of an enormous, muddy construction site and a fit of depression. But I can see how ahead of his time he really was, insisting on natural greenery instead of a regimented collection of flower beds. Then there was Patrick Prendergast, whose descent into madness was to have a shocking impact on the Fair's final days; it's here that Larson's descriptive powers really come into their own.\n\nAs for the serial killer, the author doesn't dwell on the sensationalist aspects of his more grisly activities, but what he leaves to the imagination is far more powerful. Extracts from letters written by a child kidnapped by Holmes are among the most upsetting words I've ever read - a reminder that the worst of human nature may not only be found in our own times.\n\nBut my lasting impression from this book is one of optimism, of Burnham straining every nerve and sinew to achieve the impossible, and the ordinary folk of Chicago bursting with pride at what had been achieved.\n\nThe U.S. edition of the book has the subtitle \"the fair that changed America\" - and that's certainly true, right down to the Pledge of Allegiance which can trace its origins to the exhibition's opening day. Beyond that, the Chicago Fair of 1893 not only showed America how it could be, but how it would be - better living and working conditions, convenience foods, domestic appliances, gadgets and more time for fun. In short, it heralded the prospect of a decent day's pay for a full day's work, a clean, safe environment, and of course the God-given right to eat shredded wheat.\n\nWho would you like this book?\n\nI enjoyed it because of an interest in cities and architecture. But it would equally appeal to readers who are into engineering, politics, social history, horticulture, true crimes; does that leave anyone out?\n\nThe Other Brother\n\nGeoff Elliott\n\nAllen and Unwin\n\nISBN 1741143241 A$24.95 194 pages.\n\nDavid Skea\n\nReviewer\n\nThe Other Brother is the story of Simon Holmes Court, the younger brother of Robert, the West Australian billionaire. Unexpectedly it's a fairly ordinary story of a rather quiet, shy young man making a career first as a wild life protection officer in the then Bechuanaland Protectorate (now independent Botswana). After independence, having to leave the British Crown service, he decided to start up a yacht charter business but first had to find a boat and learn to sail. Unfortunately this enterprise did not prosper so he then decided to make a wild life documentary film whilst sailing round the world. He completed his filming and spent a year or so editing the film footage he had taken but found no takers for the finished film. He then returned to Botswana starting out again as a sculptor.\n\nWhat is puzzling is that in June 1977, at the age of 37, he suddenly disappeared. His vehicle was found abandoned some two days drive away from his home in a remote forest. Moreover the vehicle identity had been defaced as if someone did not want the identity of the owner to become known.\n\nThree years later some girls out cutting twigs to make brooms stumbled across a skeleton which was presumed to be that of Simon. Alongside was a double-barrelled shotgun, one shell still unfired. An inquest was held and the case closed. The official cause of death was found to be an accident or suicide and it was also found that no one else was responsible for the cause of death.\n\nAll of this was reported in the South African press but did not get exposure in Australia where his mother and brother lived. This is not really surprising as he wasn't an Australian or a resident of Australia and his story wasn't unique.\n\nSo how did Elliott get involved? It seems that Elliott began his career as a journalist in Western Australia where, amongst other stories, he reported on the rise of Robert Holmes Court. Later he moved to Europe and then to South Africa, working in Cape Town. A colleague there mentioned that he had gone to school with the Holmes Court brothers and that Simon had disappeared. This was the first time that Elliott knew that there was a younger brother and he became intrigued (obsessed) by the story. This book is the result of the research that followed.\n\nIt would appear that Simon was a somewhat foolhardy young man and early on in his sailing career was 'lost at sea' between Maputo (Loureno Marques) and Durban. Fortune smiled on him and he was rescued by a passing oil tanker. However he had run up a huge debt for the rescue. In settlement for the rescue and towing, and to pay the cost of repairing his yacht, he agreed to a sailing trip up the east coast of Africa, ostensibly a charter trip for two rich tourists. In reality this was electronic surveillance or spying trip where he also honed up his skills as a sailor. Another sailboat and a round the world sailing trip followed, ostensibly to film wild life. Unfortunately his film was not the commercial success Simon had hoped for and he ended up back in Botswana starting a new career as a sculptor. His friends say that he had a natural ability and could have become well known. During this time, he apparently became involved with a married woman who was living apart from her husband. The night before he left there was a tiff she said she needed a breathing space, time alone to work things out. Simon left early next morning for Johannesburg, ostensibly to purchase casting supplies for his business but he never reached there or returned home.\n\nElliott's style is easy to read and my only complaint is where he comes into the story himself as a fictional reporter. As he says, he had trouble with writing this part of the story and this was his way of managing it. All-in-all a light read useful for passing the time on a long air trip.\n\nThe Artist's Quest for Inspiration, second edition\n\nPeggy Hadden\n\nAllworth Press\n\n10 East 23rd Street, Suite 510, New York, NY 10010\n\nISBN: 1581153589 $19.95 279 pages\n\nRose Glavas\n\nReviewer\n\nThe Artist's Quest for Inspiration is a book that will appeal to artists at many different stages of their career and in most artistic fields. If you are creative at any level this is a title that will help you find new ways of being inspired.\n\nThe author offers many suggestions to help you break through any creative blocks such as: journal writing, working with other artists, meditation, and music... just to name a few techniques! Throughout The Artist's Quest for Inspiration you will find highlighted ideas for you to try. One of them that I like in particular goes like this:\n\n'I think creative responses are helped by singing old songs. I know it can lift my mood. Even in private, singing can help you remember incidents from your past that might have drifted off to a corner of your mind's attic.'\n\nThis is NOT a how-to book with step-by-step instructions in using various media or lessons in perspective etc. However, this is a book that will draw on your true creativity and individual offerings to the world that will truly reflect what you have to offer.\n\nThe author has done a fabulous job in providing you with a multitude of 'block' busters that will help you break through any creative barriers you may be suffering from. Even if you don't suffer from this problem The Artist's Quest for Inspiration is bound to provide you with even more energising ideas than you already have! The language is easy to understand and friendly.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone involved in a creative pursuit - particularly if you are looking for new ideas - but also for those of you looking for a fresh approach. I must admit that I don't suffer from a shortage of ideas, but this title certainly gave me a lot more to think about!\n\nMinding Her Own Business: The Self-Employed Woman's Essential Guide to Taxes and Financial Records, 4th Edition\n\nJan Zobel, E.A.\n\nSphinx Publishing\n\nP.O. Box 4410, Naperville, Illinois 60567-4410\n\n630-961-2168 SphinxLegal.com\n\nISBN 1572484551 $14.95 239 pages\n\nPeter Hupalo\n\nReviewer\n\nMinding Her Own Business: The Self-Employed Woman's Essential Guide to Taxes and Financial Records by Jan Zobel is a solid introduction to taxes and recordkeeping for small business owners.\n\nWe learn there are 10.6 million women-owned businesses in the U.S. (48% of all businesses), employing 19.1 million people and generating total annual sales of $2.46 trillion.\n\nDuring her career preparing over 8,000 small business tax returns and teaching small business tax classes, Zobel says she learned that many people women, in particular are frightened by financial and tax issues.\n\nZobel writes: \"Taxes don't differentiate between men and women the complexity of the laws leaves everyone confused! This book was written with the belief that anyone no matter how unfamiliar with or afraid of numbers can learn to take charge of her finances.\"\n\nMinding Her Own Business covers these topics especially well:\n\n* Tracking Expenses\n\n* Understanding What Makes an Expense Tax Deductible\n\n* Car Expenses and Home-Office Expense\n\n* Depreciation and Amortization\n\n* The Importance Of Tracking Business Revenue and Other Sources Of Income\n\n* What Records the IRS Expects You To Keep and How Long\n\n* Financial Statements\n\n* Inventory and Cost-of-Goods Sold\n\n* Retirement Accounts\n\n* Understanding the Audit Process and What To Expect If You're Audited (Yikes!)\n\n* Sole Proprietorship (Schedule C) Taxes\n\n* Self-Employment Tax (IRS Schedule SE)\n\n* Estimated Tax Payments (IRS Form 1040-ES)\n\nNew business owners (and most business owners) operate as sole proprietorships and need to understand the three basic IRS forms for sole proprietor tax reporting and payment. Those forms (Schedule C, Schedule SE, and Form 1040-ES) are covered in detail. One-member limited liability company (LLC) owners also file as if they were sole proprietors.\n\nZobel writes: \"Sole proprietorships file a Schedule C with their tax return, showing their business income and expenses. For this reason, the IRS calls sole proprietors Schedule C filers. Schedule C filers are audited more often than other people because the IRS thinks they may not be reporting all their income. There is less focus on businesses that don't have a lot of cash transactions than there is on businesses, such as restaurants and hair salons, where much of the business is done in cash. Nevertheless, all businesses need to keep good records.\"\n\nZobel does a good job of explaining the rationale behind IRS requirements and explaining tax issues in simple, real-world terms.\n\nFor example, in discussing car expenses, Zobel uses a little drawing showing commuting between home, a regular job, a second job, and a temporary work location to show when car mileage is deductible.\n\nZobel writes: \"When asked how many miles their cars were used for business in the prior year, many taxpayers stare at the ceiling as if the answer's written up there. Some tax preparers call this the PFTA (Plucked From The Air) approach to recordkeeping. It will not stand up in an audit. Business owners sometimes claim that they use their car 100% for business. If you have a deductible office-in-home, 100% business car use is possible if you have another car available for personal transportation. If you don't have a deductible office-in-home, your car generally won't be used 100% for business because you have at least some commuting miles. Often, the business car is also used for a vacation trip or to pick up groceries. True 100% business use is rare for a passenger vehicle.\"\n\nMinding Her Own Business is completely updated for 2005 and covers important tax considerations for today. The deductibility of health insurance premiums to small business owners is discussed, as are education expenses and the lifetime learning credit.\n\nOne of my favorite chapters covers retirement planning for small business owners. With worked examples showing how much an individual could save tax-deferred with SIMPLE-IRAs, SEP-IRAs, and the new one-person 401(k), it becomes clear the newer one-person 401(k) (also known as the self-employed 401(k) or the solo 401(k), among other names) is a particularly desirable option for those entrepreneurs who don't have employees but who wish to maximize their tax-deferred savings.\n\nZobel also discusses the new Saver's Tax Credit which is designed to give a tax credit up to $1,000 to lower-income individuals for a $2,000 contribution made to a retirement account. (My first reaction: What?! A tax credit for low-income people? How did that find its way into the legislation?). Essentially, if you qualify, you can get $1,000 back from the IRS if you contribute $2,000 to a retirement account. As Zobel points out, this tax credit expires in 2006 (You had to know they'd catch it eventually!). This demonstrates the importance of staying current on tax issues. Reading the current edition of Minding Her Own Business and taking advantage of this credit, could instantly get some entrepreneurs $2,000 from the IRS for the next two years.\n\nA great chapter focuses on IRS audits and what to expect if you're audited. We learn that your chances of being audited is very low. Zobel writes: \"In reality, only a small percentage of people are audited each year. Just 1.91% of all Schedule C filers were audited in 2003 but this was nearly triple the rate for other taxpayers. Those who believe their income is too small for the IRS to care about may be surprised to learn that in 2003, 3% of sole proprietors with gross receipts below $25,000 were examined.\"\n\nI think every new business owner who isn't already familiar with business taxes should get a copy of Minding Her Own Business. I highly recommend this book to both men and women, especially entrepreneurs who plan to operate as sole proprietors or as one-member LLCs. Because the book is updated for 2005, I recommend people who own previous editions also acquire a new edition for current information about one-person 401(k)s and other changes affecting entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Culprit and the Cure\n\nSteven G. Aldana, PhD\n\nMaple Mountain Press\n\n935 East 900 North, Mapleton, UT 84664\n\nISBN 0975882805 $24.99, 272 pages\n\nJamie Engle\n\nReviewer\n\nMost everyone knows a healthy lifestyle includes eating right and exercising, yet many people don't eat right or exercise regularly. What will it take to get you committed to a healthy lifestyle? For me, it was Dr. Steven Aldana's book The Culprit and the Cure.\n\nThe Culprit and the Cure clearly connects the dots between a healthy lifestyle and the prevention of chronic diseases, a prolonged life, and a higher quality of life. It also shows you what you need for a healthy lifestyle and how to achieve it. Dr. Aldana, a professor of lifestyle medicine in the College of Health and Human Performance at Brigham Young University, \"read just about every scientific article ever published on nutrition, physical activity, and chronic diseases.\" He uses them to make a convincing case for permanent lifestyle changes and to define healthy nutrition and exercise guidelines. It's his engaging, but matter of fact, presentation that gets your attention. For example, \" approximately 40% of all cancers are caused by the typical American diet, lack of physical activity and obesity, and that cancer is mostly a preventable disease.\" And, \"Chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems to treat, but they are also among the most preventable.\"\n\nHave I heard these facts before? Probably, but study results tend to go in one ear and out the other because the results seem to conflict. One study says, \"Do this,\" and the next one says, \"No, don't.\" Because of his extensive research and background, Dr. Aldana can state,\"17 studies show this, 3 studies show this, and 2 show this. Taking all of them into account, here's what we know.\" I feel like I'm finally getting the whole picture, not just part of it. Having convinced you of the need to make permanent, healthy lifestyle changes, Dr. Aldana next gives you the tools to make them. No quick fixes or meal-by-meal plans. Dr. Aldana doesn't advocate giving up all red meat, or all white breads, or extremes of any kind. He advocates something much more realistic: a balanced diet and regular exercise. He lays out nutrition and exercise guidelines, such as a new food pyramid, and a thorough explanation of why food closer to its natural state is healthier. He gives you a blueprint for planning how to incorporate proper nutrition and exercise as a natural and permanent part of life. You'll find tips on how to overcome obstacles, helping children accept healthier food, setting goals, useful websites, and more.\n\nMaking lifestyle changes happens when you see benefits outweighing the barriers. The Culprit and the Cure had a profound impact on me. It tipped my benefit/barrier scale to the benefit side, thereby changing my life. If I feel barriers creeping back up, I can refer back to the book to reinforce the benefits. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be healthy or raise healthy children.\n\nThe Amateur Marriage\n\nAnne Tyler\n\nKnopf\n\n1745 Broadway, New York, NY 10019\n\n1400042070, $24.95, 320 pages\n\nJulie Merritt\n\nReviewer\n\nWe have all read books that rehash the same tired motif of the fairy tale relationship. Even when these stories are laced with reality, the authors seem to wrap up the stories neatly with a nice ending. Life is not always so tidy or sweet. Anne Tyler graces her readers with a beautiful story that would rival that of a fairy tale, but it is about real life, with real characters with only the most understated notions of glamour.\n\nTyler's gives us her first dose of reality when Michael and Pauline fall in love in the romantic frenzy of early WWII. Young men are running off to enlist in the Army, and young women are busy romanticizing the soldiers' struggle to protect their homeland. Michael enlists in the Army and quickly returns home from boot camp after he is accidentally shot during a training evolution. Although his wound is not serious enough to cripple him, it does keep him from serving abroad.\n\nThere the real journey begins. Michael and Pauline marry without any of the misty-eyed romance of a soldier returning home to his war bride. Their marriage isn't a glorious reunion after angst-ridden months of separation. Instead, it is subdued, entirely human, and far from perfect. Pauline wants more from life than Michael can give her. She is ambitious, manic, and largely unsatisfied with the life her grocery-store-owner husband provides for her. In contrast, Michael seems emotionally distant, content to steer clear of life's many peaks and valleys as he plods through his daily routine.\n\nTyler truly shines as she defines the course of their marriage. A subtle tension ripples just below the surface, and she skillfully hints at the larger problems that inevitably result from the pairing of such mismatched personalities. Tyler recognizes that marriage is a partnership, and that far too many people slip into flawed relationships based on an ill-founded infatuation. Michael clings to an image of his wife seared into his mind during the passion of their initial encounter, all the while longing for a wife who only wants to share his peaceful existence. The quiet desperation that permeates 'The Amateur Marriage' is all too real. Tyler is a first-rate author, and her beautifully drawn novel is a wonderful success.\n\nWhat You Owe Me\n\nBebe Moore Campbell\n\nhttp://www.bebemoorecampbell.com\n\nG.P.

Both are running from violent pasts. Hosanna from the vicious mob that raped her sister and stole her family's farm and Gilda from the death camps of Nazi Germany. Tapping their resilient inner strength, the two women manage to start a small cosmetics company catering to women of color. But their success doesn't last long because one day Gilda simply disappears taking all of the small company's assets with her.\n\nGilda's defection plants a bitter seed of retribution inside Hosanna that lives even beyond the grave and continues to grow inside her youngest daughter, Matriece. Gilda has resurfaced many years later and heads one of the most successful cosmetics companies in the world. Now it's time for Matriece to collect her dead mother's due.\n\nBebe Moore Campbell skillfully revisits a period when black people were migrating to Los Angeles with little more than dreams. It is a story that spans fifty years and all the poignant drama of three dynamic women, their friends, children and lovers. It is tantalizing, edgy, and sexy at times; sure to keep you turning the pages to discover who comes out on top in this corporate drama.\n\nThe Lilypad List\n\nMarian Van Eyk McCain\n\nFindhorn Press, 305a The Park, Findhorn, Forres IV36 3TE, Scotland, UK\n\nwww.findhornpress.com\n\nISBN: 184409037X $14.95 182 pp.\n\nLinda Davis Kyle, Reviewer\n\nwww.writersfriend.com\n\nIn her wonderful book, The Lilypad List: 7 steps to the simple life, Marian Van Eyk McCain helps you to find 'The Way of Consciousness' to simplify on all levels -- not just the \"surface manifestations of the simple life: how to recycle things; live on less money; tie-dye your old T-shirts; clean your windows with vinegar\" as in some other also useful books. But her book delves into the \"most profound level of all\" to help you to align with the \"greater whole of which we are a part, i.e., the Earth\" (p. 115). In inspiring and poetic prose, McCain offers ideas \"upon which to build a life that's simpler, sweeter, and more fulfilling than the one you have been leading up till now\" (p. 141).\n\nIn addition, at the end of her book, McCain suggests additional books to read. Having been a certified psychotherapist for many years, she also shares a self-therapy technique \"to use for peering more deeply into the corners of your unconscious mind,\" and a \"tape measure to estimate the size of your ecological footprint\" (p. 141). The Lilypad List is a must read for anyone on a quest to simplify and revitalize life and restore health to help not only oneself but also to make a difference in the lives of those near and far and to respect and nurture the very Earth itself. Rather than offering a prescription for the simple life, McCain shares the pathway that she has used with the hope that she will \"enable you to create your own, unique prescription\" (p. 152). If The Lilypad List enchants you, you will find McCain's Elderwoman a must read, too. I highly recommend both books.\n\nWhat Does Bunny See? A Book of Colors\n\nLinda Sue Park, author\n\nMaggie Smith, illustrator\n\nClarion\n\nISBN 0618234853 $15.00 32 pp.\n\nLynne Marie Pisano\n\nReviewer\n\nFollow Bunny through a cottage garden in Linda Sue Park's sometimes-rhymed, morning-to-night story. In this colorful garden, Bunny discovers a variety of flowers in red, yellow, purple, green, pink, orange and blue. Maggie Smith's charming watercolor and pencil illustrations drive the reader through the sometimes awkward (though sometimes rich in assonance and consonance) verse with near-rhymes: In a cottage garden/ past the pussy willow/ bunny nibbles tender shoots/ what she sees is---/ yellow!/ Primroses are nestled low/ in their leafy pillows. Surprisingly, this picture book lacks the usual Linda Sue Park polish. Still, little ones may enjoy identifying the bold colors, as well as locating the small insects pictured on each spread.\n\nKnock Their Socks Off: A Freelance Writer's Guide to Query Letters that Sell\n\nMridu Khuller\n\nWritersCrossing.com\n\nhttp://www.writerscrossing.com/queries.html\n\ne-book, $12.95 130 pages\n\nMagdalena Ball, Reviewer\n\nhttp://www.compulsivereader.com/html\n\nIf you are looking to make a living as a freelance writer, you'll need to become very familiar with the query letter. It is the basis of any assignment, from a brief point by point article to a full length non-fiction (and even fiction writers need to produce good queries). Mridu Khuller is the editor of WritersCrossing.com, and has written for hundreds of magazines, websites, newspapers and anthologies around the world. Many of the books targeted to freelance writers come out of the USA, and tend to be just a little bit US-centric (to coin a word). Although Knock Your Socks Off is applicable to writers working anywhere in the world, for those freelance writers who don't live in the USA, the global applicability of the advice and anecdotes is refreshing. Khuller writes in clear, accessible and friendly prose, designed to encourage and inspire new, and experienced freelancers in the art of finding ideas, markets and putting together query letters with those ideas, for those markets, in order to land writing assignments.\n\nKhuller presents a number of \"assignments,\" brainstorming techniques and practical suggestions designed to give you targeted and viable ideas --the obvious basis of any query. The assignments provide activities which will help you understand the limits of your own knowledge, and ensure that, when you do get a sale (as you will if you follow Khuller's advice), your work is relevant to you, for example: \"Make a list of all the jobs you've held previously and for each, come up with an idea that would appeal to a mass audience.\" The idea generation questions in this section are guaranteed block busters, and will provide the basis for magazine articles for the rest of your working career. Some of the suggestions, like itemising your big successes, or noting the compliments that others give you may seem obvious, and they are, but just the process of working through the questions in writing, with article ideas as the agenda, is enough to generate a huge number of fairly original topics. Khuller provides advice on how to ensure that your idea is original too, by using a very common title for one market (like an article about good eating for a pregnancy magazine) and switching the market (an article on your pregnant spouse's diet for a man's magazine).\n\nIf you've followed Khuller's advice in the idea chapter, you will probably already have a number of markets lined up, but Knock Their Socks Off provides a detailed guide to the different types of markets, generally focussed towards the non-fiction magazine markets, both online and print. She also provides links to some of the more respected online market e-zines and instructions on how to set up an manage a market/query database for the huge number of potential markets. Once you have a good list of markets, it is critical to determine whether the piece you are pitching is a good fit for the market and Khuller provides a number of techniques for customising your queries in a way which will be most attractive. She also provides advice on how to obtain and make good use of quotes and expert opinion, with tips on using online websites like Profnet and NewsWise.\n\nThe rest of the book goes into the nitty gritty of putting together an actual query, from the salutation through the lead or hook, the brief, the bio and clips. Throughout the book are examples and anecdotes, quotes from queries that worked, and those that didn't, and tricks for making your queries stand out above others. Hints on using photographs, formatting, e-mail querying, one sentence queries and resubmissions, with a range of real life templates/queries that you can use yourself with a few modifications. Khuller also suggests a workable schedule for ensuring a steady supply of queries goes out (2 queries for each rejection). Although at 130 pages, this isn't a lengthy book, it is a pleasurable, humorous read full of pithy information designed solely to get the reader writing for the potentially lucrative magazine/freelance article market. By the time you've finished Knock Your Socks Off if you haven't already begun the process of writing a series of weekly queries, and receiving a reasonably number of acceptances, you probably aren't serious about being a freelance non-fiction writer.\n\nBeach Girls\n\nLuanne Rice\n\nBantam Books\n\nBantam Dell, Division of Random House\n\nNY, NY\n\nwww.bantamdell.com 1-800-733-3000\n\nISBN: 0553587242 $7.50 428 pp.\n\nMartha Robach\n\nReviewer\n\nWithin the magic circle Emma has drawn in the sand, Stevie, Emma and Maddie chant, \"Beach girls now, beach girls tomorrow, beach girls till the end of time.\" The three girls enjoy blissful summers on the beach at Hubbard's Point, Connecticut, during their youth. But now years later there are only two surviving \"beach girls,\" and they are lonely women whose lives have turned into an emotional wasteland. Stevie Moore, artist and author, after three failed marriages and having \"fallen in love too hard and too wrong,\" lives hermit-like at her beach house on Hubbard's Point until nine-year-old Nell Kilvert bolts past her \"Please go away\" sign, skinning her knees on the rocky path leading to Stevie's door.\n\nNell is the daughter of Emma, who Stevie lost touch with years before. Emma married Maddie's handsome older brother Jack, making Emma and Maddie sister-in-laws. But now Emma is dead. And something that occurred during the traffic accident that killed Emma and seriously injured Maddie a year before has driven a wedge between Jack and his sister. Nell grieves the loss of her mother and the beloved aunt she is forbidden to see and strives to come closer to them through Stevie's beach memories. With Nell, Stevie begins again to feel the warmth of the sun, and that sun glows even hotter when Stevie meets Jack. There is an instant attraction between them, but Jack is bewildered, struggling to cope with his wife's death while building a new life for himself and Nell.\n\nIn Beach Girls, Luanne Rice probes gently but realistically some of life's darkest trials: the loss of one's mother during childhood and the suffering at the end of a marriage. As Stevie, Nell, Jack and Maddie attempt to pick up the shattered pieces of their lives and find a way to fit them together once more, the book progresses like a wander through a maze, with each character allowing his or her feelings to lead them, submerged as they are in the dark substance of life's tragedies. Rice extols the beneficial effects of psychotherapy during deep trauma, and emphasizes the importance of taking care of the environment and all living things. Even when her characters appear to lose all hope of happiness, they are pulled back from the abyss by the bonds of friendship, family and the coherent force of beloved surroundings.\n\nI read Beach Girls at the suggestion of my daughter, who is a big fan of Luanne Rice and eagerly awaits the appearance of her latest novel. Rice is a prolific and popular writer. Her former novels include Dance With Me, The Perfect Summer, The Secret Hour, Safe Harbor, Summer Light and Firefly Beach. The author's in-depth descriptions of emotions and romantic settings will be most appreciated by women, but her topics are universal.\n\nDetailed and lyrical descriptions of New England's beaches draw the reader into the story. A full-moon night on Hubbard's Point is pictured: \" the moon would crown the surface -- a copper-colored orb slipping out of one element into another. It would shimmer, then clarify, turn glowing white, and grow smaller as it rose high in the sky, its light trickling onto the surface of the Sound.\"\n\nThis book is an enchanting, sincere and positive read, with an ending that demonstrates the redemption and solace family, friends, love and nature can bring in times of loneliness and sorrow.\n\nRich Dad's Escape from the Rat Race: How to Become a Rich Kid by Following Rich Dad's Advice\n\nRobert T. Kiyosaki with Sharon L.

Money is serious business. But let's face it -- that's bor-ring! Yet Tim Turtle makes a strong case for achieving financial intelligence when he runs out of money at the amusement park. He thinks the answer to his money problems is to get a job. When Red Rat laughs at him and says he'll never get rich by working at a job, poor Tim is totally confused. But isn't that how to make money? Instead Red Rat shows him the difference between working for money and making money work for him. Based on Kiyosaki's bestselling book \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\", this comic book adventure into the world of finance brings money issues to life. How to find moneymaking opportunities and create assets are explored in ways that are fun and easy to understand.\n\nFluke\n\nChristopher Moore\n\nPerennial\n\nISBN: 006056668X $13.95\n\nTerry Mathews\n\nReviewer\n\nI had a ball reading this book. I've just finished ISLAND OF THE SEQUINED LOVE NUN and THE LUST LIZARD OF MELANCHOLY COVE, too.\n\nChristopher Moore is a New Age Hunter Thompson. Irreverent. Cheeky. Cynical. And thought-provoking.\n\nSet in Maui, FLUKE centers around an expert whale researcher seeing the words BITE ME on the tail of a humpback whale. Of course, he was the only one who saw it and the pictures he took didn't turn out, so he has to prove to himself that he's not going crazy from too much time in a boat.\n\nMoore has filled his book with rich characters, a plausible plot (mostly), and some really wild adventures.\n\nMoore has many gifts, but the one that shines brightest is his skewed view of what most of us see as normal. He makes his readers pause and think: \"Could this really happen?\"\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAlisa's Bookshelf\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Undead\n\nKim Harrison\n\nhttp://www.kimharrison.net\n\nHarper Torch\n\nISBN: 0060572973 $6.99 453 pp.\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Undead is Kim Harrison's follow-up to Dead Witch Walking. The world of this duo is a future Cincinnati which has survived a genetically engineered tomato plague that has exposed 'supernaturals' to the world. The supernaturals have staked out a community called the Hallows. To humans, the Hallows is like Vegas or New Orleans during Mardi Gras - a definite walk on the wild side and tourist trap.\n\nRachel is back with a vengeance along with Jenks, her pixie sidekick, and Ivy, the living vamp. The story begins about a month after the conclusion of Dead Witch Walking. Rachel is still struggling to earn her half of expenses at the church with Ivy. Rachel's new association with FIB - the Federal Inderlander Bureau, police force for humans, finally pans out. On the surface the case appears simple - Sara Jane's warlock boyfriend has disappeared. Normally IS, police force for supernaturals, would handle the case, but they have a 72 hour waiting period. Rachel jumps at the chance to be involved for the money and Sara Jane is Trent Kalamack's secretary.\n\nAs normal, nothing is as it seems. Dan, Sara Jane's boyfriend, may be one in a string of grisly murders of ley line witches. Ley line witches tap into the Ever-After using ley lines for their power. Rachel is at a disadvantage as she failed the ley line witch class she took in college. She is also very leery of the Ever-After due to the demon attack in Dead Witch Walking and the death of her father. Rachel finds many links to Trent, but is unable to find hard proof to satisfy Detective Edden of the FIB.\n\nThe Hallows is the incredible world created by Kim Harrison. The alternate world of the Ever-After with a demon city is very interesting. Rachel finally takes us to Pizza Piscary and we get to meet the master vampire Piscary himself. Kist and his motorcycle are back to torment Rachel. During the course of the novel, we finally get a much clearer picture of what Trent Kalamack is and what his motives are.\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Undead far exceeded my expectations after Dead Witch Walking. The storyline branches out in many directions that are unexpected and thrilling to read. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and am anxiously awaiting the third installment, Every Which Way But Dead due out in July of 2005.\n\nKim Harrison describes herself as born in the Midwest. She has been called a witch, among other things, but has never seen a vampire (that she knows of). She loves graveyards and midnight jazz, and wears too much black.

I highly recommend this wonderfully imaginative series.\n\nThe Autumn Castle introduces use to a group of artist who are currently working under a fellowship which allows them to live at the Hotel Mandy Z. in Berlin, Germany. The fellowship is through a very eccentric artist, Immanuel Zweigler whom everyone calls Mandy Z. Jude, one of the artists, lives with his girlfriend, Christine Starlight. Christine is an American who lived in Berlin as a child. The artists are rounded out by Gerda, Pete, and Fabiyan.\n\nChristine has had a very difficult life. While living in Berlin, she befriended a neighbor child everyone called little May. May and Christine were inseparable. One night, May disappeared and was presumed dead. Christine and her parents moved back to America shortly after May's disappearance. In 1989, she lost her parents in a horrific car accident that left her with horrid injuries. The car accident was caused by another driver who never even paused to see if anyone survived. Life was bleak for Christine until Jude appeared in her life like a knight in shinning armor.\n\nMandy Z. is a very complex and creepy man. He is a world renowned sculptor and is also color blind. Along with being incredibly wealthy, he is also an insane sociopath. He is secretly working on a bizarre sculpture he calls the Bone Wife. This sculpture is not made of marble or any other stone, but of fairy bones. Mandy Z. has a unique gift that allows him to know when a person is really a Fairy.\n\nOne fateful day, Christine injures herself and is transported to Ewigkreis, Fairyland. In this strange land, Christine encounters a talking fox named Eisengrimm and the Fairy Queen. Queen Mayfridh is Christine's childhood friend, May. As children, they preformed a 'blood bond' that allowed Christine to enter Ewigkreis. One characteristic of Fairyland is residents forget about humans and our world once the seasons change. Queen Mayfridh is amazed and intrigued to be reunited with her friend Christine. After Christine returns to the real world, Mayfridh longs for all she lost when she entered Ewigkreis. Soon a plan is hatched to allow Mayfridh to visit the world she left as a child.\n\nThe residents of Hotel Mandy Z. are on a collision course with Mayfridh. She brings out many dark secrets and tempts Mandy Z. to commit unspeakable acts. Mayfridh's visit brings all these horrors and more to pass. Christine, Jude, and the rest are never the same again.\n\nKim Wilkins has created an incredible tale of morality and madness to delight. Her characters are rich and multidimensional. The plot does seem to lag at times, but that is a result of dealing with character development. We get to know the residents of Hotel Mandy Z. and Ewigkreis very intimately. The twists and turns created in the plot are amazing in their ingenuity. This is not a typical Fairytale nor is it a typical fantasy. At the end, Wilkins treats us to a real Fairytale that closes the plot in such a way that you crave more.\n\nKim Wilkins lives in Australia and is the author of numerous books. Her Europa series continues with the Giants of the Frost - available in Australia, and the Snow Witch - to be released July, 2005 in Australia.

Cast\n\nhttp://www.pccast.net/\n\nLuna\n\nhttp://www.luna-books.com/\n\nISBN: 0373802137 $13.95 551 pp.\n\nElphame's Choice by P.C. Cast is a wonderful follow-up to Cast's first novel, Goddess by Mistake. Elphame's Choice is set in the same world, Partholon about 125 years after the events in Goddess by Mistake.\n\nElphame, the great-granddaughter of Rhiannon and the daughter of Etain, the current Goddess Incarnate is struggling to find her way. Born part-human and part-centaur, she is worshiped by the people of Partholon and she hates it. Elphame is a woman - not a goddess. Epona, the Goddess, has never directly spoken to Elphame. As a matter of fact, Elphame has never experienced anything magical except her hybrid looks.\n\nMacCallan Castle, according to Goddess by Mistake was the site of a terrible atrocity. The Fomorians, vampire-like demons attacked the castle, murdered all the men and used the woman as incubators for their children. Fomorians had lost the ability to reproduce and had discovered that human woman could be used for children. These women died a horrible death at the birth of these Fomorian off-spring. With the help of Rhiannon and Epona, the Fomorians were defeated and driven into the Wastelands. MacCallan Castle was destroyed when it was used a funeral pyre for the dead.\n\nElphame has decided MacCallan Castle should be rebuilt. She hopes those who join her endeavor will accept her just as a woman and not a goddess. To assist her in rebuilding the castle are her brother, Cuchulainn, Danann, Stonemaster and centaur, Brighid, a Huntress and centaur, Brenna, a Healer, and many others. This band of young people are hopeful that MacCallan Castle will be a place for them to start over and have a better way of life.\n\nThe Fomorians are not done with Partholon. While the original Fomorians have long since died off of a plague, their children have survived. Epona, in her infinite wisdom, allowed some of the mothers to survive. These mothers loved their children, even though they where fathered by Fomorians. These hybrid children raised by loving mothers fight a constant battle to retain their humanity. Lochlan, their leader, believes in a prophecy told to him by his mother - the hybrid Fomorians will gain salvation from madness with the blood of a dying Goddess. Lochlan believes this to be Elphame - who is also his lifemate.\n\nP.C. Cast has created a wonderful and rich mythology for Elphame's Choice. The intricate characterizations make the book very interesting to read. This is not just as standard romantic fantasy. There are no buxom heroines in distress. Elphame is strong in both character and body. While some parts of the story are traditional romance, most is not. The storyline has a few twists that are not anticipated. The fantasy element of the book is what dominates the storyline. The ending will even surprise most. It is not your typical 'happy ever after.' I enjoyed reading this book.\n\nP.C. Cast is a professional teacher and speaker. Her first book, Goddess by Mistake won the Holt Medallion in the category of best paranormal romance, The Prism Award, and the Laurel Wreath Award for Excellence in Published Romance Fiction. Goddess by Mistake will be re-released by Luna entitled Partholon by Mistake in the fall of 2005. Her other works include Goddess of Spring, Goddess of the Sea, and Goddess of Light.

Hendee\n\nhttp://www.nobledead.com/\n\nRoc\n\nISBN: 045146009X $7.50 405 pp.\n\nSister of the Dead is Barb & J.C. Hendee's third book in the Noble Dead series. Once again, we join Magiere and Leesil on their journey for the truth - no matter where it takes them. Wynn, an apprentice sage, and Chap, a Fay spirit in dog form, round out this intrepid traveling group.\n\nMagiere is a dhampir, half-human and half-vampire. She is a hybrid created for unknown reasons. In Dhampir, Magiere was introduced to Welstiel Massing, a Noble Dead (vampire) who told her she was created to kill other Noble Dead. In Thief of Lives, Welstiel is unmasked and Magiere learns his true intentions - to force her to find an artifact that will allow Welstiel to become human again. Needless to say, Magiere is not one to appreciate being manipulated and has vowed to never help Welstiel in his quest.\n\nAt the conclusion of Thief of Lives, Magiere and Leesil have decided two different treks are in order. Leesil, half-elf and half-human, has just found out that his elvish mother, Nein'a is still alive. Leesil has vowed to find out her fate. He believed his parents were executed after he deserted employment as an assassin to a powerful lord.\n\nMagiere seeks to find out why she was created. Her mother, Magelia was impregnated by a Noble Dead with Magiere the result. Magelia died shortly after Magiere's birth and she was raised by her Aunt Bieja in the small village of Chemest£k in the country of Droevinka. Life was hard for Magiere as the other villagers never accepted her.\n\nLeesil and Magiere decide to head to Chemest£k first as it is closer. This decision brings about much knowledge and even more questions. The events around Magiere's birth are even more complex then anyone had previously considered. The journey is arduous for all and much is revealed.\n\nSister of the Dead is a wonderful addition to the Noble Dead series. While certain mysterious are answered, even more are created. Leesil and Magiere's relationship deepens. We learn more about Chap and what his intentions are. Sister of the Dead leads us on an amazing adventure that will keep you engrossed until the final chapter.\n\nThe Noble Dead series is a mix of high-fantasy and traditional vampire fiction. This makes the series unique and interesting. The fantasy elements are interwoven with the vampire lore. Magiere is a hybrid and as such struggles with her nature. Leesil has similar struggles as he is also a hybrid. The two together present both sides of the mixed genres. This is a series that will appeal to both horror and fantasy fans.\n\nBarb & J.C. Hendee are a husband/wife pair of writers. Dhampir is the first in the Noble Dead series, followed by Thief of Lives, and Sister of the Dead. Traitor to the Blood, fourth in the series, is scheduled to be published in January, 2006. Barb Hendee is the author of another vampire novel, Blood Memories published in 1999. Both authors have written many short stories. They have a website at www.nobledead.com with many extras for the series.\n\nAlisa McCune\n\nReviewer\n\nArlene's Bookshelf\n\nDreams Found\n\nLyn Denison\n\nBella Books\n\nP.O. Box 10543, Tallahassee, FL 32302\n\nISBN: 0931513589; $12.95; 201 pp.\n\nIn Lyn Denison's novel, Dreams Found, Australian carpenter Riley James is a twenty-five year-old woman who has decided to locate her birth mother who gave Riley up for adoption. She has the complete love and support of her adoptive mother, Lenore. \"As I see this, love,\" she continued, \"the most important thing is whether or not you want to contact your birth parents.\" (Page 9) Through some vigorous research Riley finds the woman and makes that all-important first telephone call. \" I was born on September twenty-fourth.\" (Page 13) To which Margaret Easton whispers into the phone, \"My baby girl.\" (Page 13) Thus begins one woman's journey to discover a family she never knew, and at the same time, to meet a young woman, Jayne, who could affect Riley in a myriad of ways. Throughout this passage there are the reassuring confirmations as well as the unexpected pitfalls that serve both to inspire and discourage Riley. Friends, some calmly and steadfastly loyal and another the epitome of outrageous egocentricity, take part as she tries to put into perspective how her life is, should, and will evolve.\n\nDenison has crafted a novel with likable and realistic characters whose exceptionally believable seamless dialogue flows smoothly and effortlessly. Riley James is a proud and out lesbian who sometimes questions whether her birth mother will be accepting of this fact, while at the same time, Riley never denies who she is. Mac Bradford, her straight male best friend, provides the comic relief with his easy self-deprecating swagger and magnetism. Jayne Easton captures the angst and uncertainty of a thirty year-old woman who has followed the corporate and conventional path and the expectations of others for too long and far too intensely. She also is on a journey of rediscovery and renewal. \"Looking back, I suppose I settled .\" (Page 194) It remains to be seen if Jayne can overcome the obstacles in her path and trust in her own judgment. Darren Wardell, Jayne's business partner, exhibits that smarmy, suffocating, and superficial charm of a fundamentally insecure man that wears thin and tedious for most whom he encounters, and that feeble charm increasingly exasperates and infuriates Riley. Their skillfully written pivotal verbal confrontation is one to be savored and re-read with delight.\n\nDenison develops the plot in a sequential, straightforward, and comprehensible fashion. Conflicts are created with just the precise degree of foreshadowing which enables the reader to actively anticipate and participate. Becoming part of any scene is the hope and desire for most readers, and they will be neither disappointed nor dissatisfied here. One can indeed identify with these two main protagonists, Riley and Jayne, and their trials, uncertainties, and aspirations. Events fall so neatly and believably into place that the reader never has to think or utter those five dreaded words, \"Where did that come from?\" In a subdued, yet controlled and quiet style, Denison creates tension and suspense that ring true. These actions never appear to be maudlin, gratuitous, or unwarranted.\n\nLyn Denison's novel Dreams Found is, indeed, undeniably one of those exceptional books that one is reluctant to put down; it truly is an indisputable page-turner. Denison effectively manages to take a rather routine occurrence, seeking one's birth parents, and transforms it into a particularly plausible and richly rewarding narrative. What makes this book so different from so many others of this genre is this author's ability to imbue her characters with such a degree of coherent vulnerability and fortitude that the reader cannot help but be enchanted with them from the very start. The realizations that Riley and Jayne discover, as they examine who they are and desire to be, create empathy within the reader that is both satisfying and enjoyable. This reader is eagerly looking forward to a sequel to Dreams Found for two crucial reasons. First, this novel has only two-hundred and one pages; at times one does feel slightly rushed toward the finale. Secondly, there is undeniably more to explore, amplify, and expand with these attractive and engaging characters. Of course, it could very well be simply a matter of this reader's not wanting a good thing to end.\n\nSaving Grace, Second Edition\n\nJennifer Fulton\n\nYellow Rose Books\n\nPMB 210, 8691 9th Avenue, Port Arthur, TX 77642-8025\n\nISBN 1932300260; $15.95; 167 pp.\n\nDawn Beaumont, a once promising Australian champion swimmer with Olympic aspirations, is again bemoaning the sad state of her twenty-two year-old life to her cousin Trish. It's been six months since Dawn's accident shattered any prospects for an athletic career. To make matters worse, she has returned to her parents' home which causes her to proclaim dramatically, \"It's driving me 'round the bend living at home\" (page 1). Trish explains that she has planned a holiday get-away for Dawn, a return trip to the isolated Moon Island, so that she can relax, strengthen her body, and generally get her priorities in order. Recognizing an opportunity to escape from her parental strangle-hold, Dawn reluctantly accepts her cousin's offer to return to a place which has less than pleasant memories for her. However, at this stage in Dawn's life, any alternative would be better than her present situation.\n\nGrace Ramsay, a thirty-two year-old scientist and savvy career woman from New York City, is on her way to Moon Island where she will be conducting discreet geological studies for Argus Chemco, a worldwide conglomerate searching for a new dumping ground for toxic wastes. Grace, too, has a past, one she has neither accepted nor dealt with. However, this is only one of the reasons why this so very cool and composed woman careens from one meaningless affair to another, consumes far too much alcohol, and is so ruthless in both her professional and personal dealings with others.\n\nThe two women soon find themselves sharing the small island, and this proves to be a challenge for them both. Add to this mix a former lover, an unscrupulous businessman, a casual one night stand, and another's sexual awakening, and you have all the elements necessary to keep you reading until the very last word of the epilogue.\n\nJennifer Fulton has created credible conflicts, both internal as well as external. The main characters, Dawn and Grace, are beset with numerous problems which each can no longer avoid, deny, or escape. Yet these struggles are described through viable actions and believable dialogue. Both women have realistically reached that pivotal point in their lives, and for better or worse, the choices each woman will make will affect more than simply themselves.\n\nThis novel offers well-rounded, three-dimensional characters, not stereotypes or stock players. The secondary characters are endowed with personality, insight, and humor. There are people the reader grows fond of, wants to spend time with, and hopes only the best for like the septuagenarian nurse living alone on a Pacific atoll or the bi-sexual personal assistant who, after having spent only one brief evening of lust with Grace, understands Grace better than Grace cares to admit or even recognize.\n\nFulton's writing style is fluid, fast-paced, and compact yet it is extremely descriptive, \" watching the procession of colors from sapphire to heliotrope to amethyst, until finally the blood-red sun fused with the ocean.\" (Page 35) The diction chosen captures the mood of the scene, \"blinking in the buttercup light of morning\" (page 50). This appreciation for just the right word enhances the narrative, \"In the moonlight, she glowed marble-smooth, her hollows and contours deeply shadowed\" (page 74). Proficiency in word choice too often is a neglected skill. Being able to strike that natural balance between the trite and the florid is a talent which is most evident in this novel. Imagery is not given short shrift here.\n\nEthics, moral principles, integrity, self-worth, acceptance, and societal accountability are some of the themes touched upon in Saving Grace. However, the author has managed to seamlessly weave them throughout the intelligent plotting that the reader never loses sight of the fact that she is reading a true romance novel of two women on a journey of discovery. It is to the author's credit that the reader can so easily read between the lines; there is depth to this novel.\n\nJennifer Fulton's Saving Grace is an enjoyably entertaining and rewarding way to spend a few hours. The exceedingly likable and believable characters find themselves in the midst of various intriguing and startling developments. The delicate convolutions of personal relationships, sexual awakening, and past misfortunes will keep the reader thoroughly engaged and satisfied. Although this novel is Book II in Fulton's Moon Island Series, it is not a prerequisite to have read the first installment. This is an excellent stand-alone novel, complete in its detail and current issues. Saving Grace has all the hallmarks of a well written romance novel: unique setting, superb characters, plausible dialogue, and realistic and exciting sexual depictions. This is a tale that will make you want to pack your bag, buy an airplane ticket, and check into that tropical cottage on Moon Island where you can read the rest of the series.\n\nArlene Germain\n\nReviewer\n\nBethany's Bookshelf\n\nThe Book of Daniel\n\nMary Breeden, illuminator\n\nElderberry Press\n\n1393 Old Homestead Drive, 2nd floor, Oakland, OR 97462-9506\n\n1932762264 $20.00 elderberrypress.com\n\nThe Book of Daniel is an illuminated rendition of Christian Biblical text, chronicling the experiences of Daniel, a man \"greatly beloved\" by God and an excellent role model for today.

It simply isn't possible. / I say they've turned toward the side we call / Invisible. // And like the stars that must incline to set / They too are somewhere out there in the sky; / The eye-lights may go down at times and yet / They do not die. // All lovely or beloved, in black and blue, / To any dawn's immensities disposed / On earth's far side they're seeing through / The lids we closed.\n\nVitamins: Their Role in the Human Body\n\nG.

The cover of her book, Feminine Wiles, is as eye-catching as the covers of popular women's magazines, plastered with headlines that grab your attention and make you want to read what's inside, just like the newsstand magazine covers: Get Intimate With Your Readers. Why Gushing Doesn't Sell. Stark-Naked Interviews - Getting a Woman to Bare Her Soul. Inside, Boetig divides her information into four cleverly-titled sections that will move you from reading women's magazines to writing for them.\n\nIn the first section, The Chase, Boetig tells you how to come up with ideas and how to massage them to fit the magazine you want to sell them to. In addition, she gives you tips on how to write attention-getting query letters, how to do a good interview, how to get permission to tell someone's story, and how to use quotes appropriately and effectively.\n\nThe second section, (The Drama) demonstrates the use and importance of pictures and emotions to illustrate and add oomph to a story, while the third section, (The Main Event) gives several formulas and lists of steps for writing the actual meat of an article.\n\nFinally, in The Bye Lines, Boetig demonstrates showing, not telling, fact-checking, marketing, and other end-of-the-process details. If being published in a big name women's magazine is one of your goals, reading Feminine Wiles will be a great jump-start. In fact, once you've finished, you'll be overflowing with ideas and possibilities. I find it so inspiring that it's one of the books I keep handy for days when I'm threatened with writer's block!\n\nUntil the Last Dog Dies\n\nJohn Laurence Robinson\n\nRiver Oak\n\nc/o Cook Communications Ministries\n\n4050 Lee Vance View, Colorado Springs, CO 80918\n\nwww.CookMinistries.com\n\n1589190211 $12.99 381 p.\n\nUntil the Last Dog Dies is a Joe Box mystery, the second by author John Laurence Robinson. (The third Joe Box title, When Skylarks Fall, is due out from RiverOak in October 2005, and Robinson is currently writing Skin the Cat.) Sadly, the first Joe Box book, Sock Monkey Blues, is currently unavailable, as it was originally published by a Publish-On-Demand company that refuses to return the rights. Robinson is currently in negotiations with said company, and I look forward to eventually being able to read Sock Monkey Blues, too.\n\nMeanwhile, my enjoyment of Until the Last Dog Dies was not hampered much by not having read the first book. A few questions did crop up, but none made a big difference in following what was going on (and most were answered by the end of the book, through the use of back story). Back story is often known among writers as \"infodump\", a pejorative term that means the author took a bunch of material he thought the reader needed to know and inserted it whole. It usually sticks out like a sore thumb and many readers skip over it without a qualm.\n\nHowever, Robinson does it with scarcely a ripple by alternating chapters of Joe's present life as a newly-Christian private investigator with chapters of his past life as a skilled soldier in Vietnam. The story starts with Joe being dragged from sleep by a phone call. It's Little Bit, an army buddy he hasn't heard from in over thirty years, and it isn't good news. A man Joe and Little Bit's unit captured during the war has escaped, according to the terrified Little Bit, and he was gunning for all of them.\n\nJoe couldn't believe it. Martin ten Eyck, the son of a powerful senator, had become a sadistic and talented killer during the war, and after Joe's unit had tracked him down and captured him, he'd been locked up for life in an asylum for the criminally insane. True, ten Eyck had sworn to kill them all, one by one, but he couldn't be out. No one would be that careless with someone that deadly.\n\nBut Little Bit has gotten a threatening phone call and he's sure it was ten Eyck, coming for him. Joe finally hangs up, still unconvinced, only to be aroused a few hours later by a call from Little Bit's wife. Little Bit is dead. He was electrocuted while working on a radio that was still plugged in. The authorities have written it off as an accident, but Joe knows better. Soldiers spend a lot of time talking, and he knows Little Bit was terrified of electricity. No way he'd have been working on something still plugged in.\n\nThen, Joe begins to find out about other deaths in the unit. Vlad, who feared blood and being shot at, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot. Ed, who's afraid of driving and always lets others drive him around, dead at the bottom of a cliff in a car he was supposedly driving. Each man had died in the way he'd been most terrified of, and Joe can't convince the authorities that they were murdered. Then, there are more murders, and now Joe is one of only three men left alive. Time to find out what's going on!\n\nWhen he talks to one of ten Eyck's doctors from the asylum, he discovers that ten Eyck is even more dangerous than before. Over the thirty years ten Eyck has been imprisoned, the asylum treatments have included LSD and unrestricted involvement with the occult. As a result, ten Eyck is possessed by more evil than Joe has ever faced before. He may not be able to stop him from killing again, but - armed with a borrowed gun and backed up by the prayers of the church he attends - he has to try, for it isn't just Joe in danger now, it's everyone he cares about. Will his faith in God, bolstered by prayer, be enough to help Joe stop ten Eyck from killing again?\n\nBetty Winslow\n\nReviewer\n\nBuhle's Bookshelf\n\nWords of Wisdom: Beginning Buddhism\n\nMaster Hsuan Hua\n\nBuddhist Text Translation Society\n\n3106 Crescent Avenue, Unit 7, Marina, CA 93933\n\n0881393029 $12.00 www.bttsonline.org\n\nWords of Wisdom: Beginning Buddhism is an anthology of introductory talks concerning Buddhism by Tripitaka Master Hua, who was born near Manchuria in 1918, became a monk at age 19, and brought orthodox Buddhism to the United States in the 1960s.

Buddhist Writings on Greed, Desire, and the Urge to Consume is an anthology of essays by a wide variety of learned authors that scrutinize the overpowering desire for material items from a Buddhist viewpoint. From how yearning for material things can have a corruptive influence, to the value of Buddhist tools in restoring balance to one's life and wants, to ethical principles of Buddhist consumption (ranging from how to successfully be generous in a consumerist world to Green Power in contemporary Japan) and much more, these essays strike directly to the heart of modern materialism - what it is, how much is too much, and how to put the craving in its place before it escalates into untold misery. Highly recommended; one does not have to be a Buddhist to see the value in moderation in an increasingly advertisement-saturated world.\n\nPeace Begins Here\n\nThich Nhat Hanh\n\nParallax Press\n\nPO Box 7355, Berkeley, CA 94707\n\n1888375450 $14.00 www.parallax.com\n\nPeace Begins Here: Palestinians And Israelis Listening To Each Other by Nobel Peace Prize Nominee Thich Nhat Hanh focuses on the importance of Palestinians and Israelis working together for peace and stability of the Middle East and the world as a whole.

From the obsessive nature of crisis reporting in the media that ignores underlying problems and history, or summarizes them in a backward progression if at all, to propaganda as a tool of empire-building, to the ruthlessness of the police state in so-called \"democracies\" that get their hands as bloody as any fascist, An Ordinary Person's Guide To Empire spares nothing in its effort to show the raw, real, and often vicious truth.

Collected by William Still, the son of emancipated slaves, who helped guide fugitives to safety as an Underground Railroad \"conductor\" based in Philadelphia, The Underground Rail Road collects letters, testimonies, news articles, and reflections upon extraordinary individual journeys to freedom. Collecting these records, let alone participating in the Underground Railroad, was a dangerous endeavor in an era when merely failing to report slave escapes could get one imprisoned or worse. William Still hid his manuscripts in a crypt to protect himself and the people they documented; he never expected to witness emancipation or the opportunity to publish them in his lifetime. The Underground Rail Road remains a classic first-person anecdotal documentary of history itself, and is highly recommended for American history and library collections.\n\nA Century Apart: Maine Then & Now\n\nCindy McIntyre\n\nDown East Books\n\nPO Box 679, Camden, ME 04843\n\n089272613X $28.00 1-800-685-7962 www.downeastbooks.com\n\nA Century Apart: Maine Then & Now is a gorgeous visual and historic tour of Maine's landscapes and cities.
