I have always known that I wanted to pursue a career with some form of creativity. I graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2011 and began working as a graphic designer at a local sign shop.

That’s when I started thinking about photography.\n\nAs professional Wedding Photographer & Videographer team based in the lakes region of New Hampshire, We love to be creative with our photographs as well as video and welcome your input to make your wedding day memories something you will cherish forever!

We have years of experience with photo/video and have been very blessed to have received \"Best of Wedding Photography\" awards in the last few years, with over 50 five star reviews.\n\n​I began photography in early 2015 by offering a few free sessions. Soon my business grew and I was booking numerous family and children photography sessions each month. In the summer of 2015 I began photographing weddings by offering to photograph a wedding for free and now I have seen my business grow from a few weddings a year to being fully booked with weddings nearly every weekend! In 2019 I decided to turn something I was passionate about into my full-time job. Many of my weddings are booked through \"word of mouth\" from some of my amazing clients!

I’m Toni Jones, and I bring a heartfelt passion for photography to every frame I capture. My journey began as an Image Consultant and Personal Branding Specialist, where I honed my skills in showcasing the best of individuals. This experience has been invaluable as I transitioned into photography, particularly in capturing the profound moments of couples’ lives. My approach is personal and intimate. I believe in creating a connection with every client, understanding their story, and reflecting that narrative through my lens. It’s not just about the photos; it’s about the experience and the memories we create during the process.\n\nI started my photography journey as a simple hobby where I carried my camera with me everywhere and took photos of everything. Over time, I began to develop my skills into a more sophisticated / professional style as you might expect for weddings and other formal events. I paired up with a local multi award winning wedding photographer who helped me in refining my skills and taught me the ins and outs of wedding photography and I've never looked back. Since then, I have started my own business as a photographer and take pride in my style and skill as being mostly self taught, candid, emotional and captivating.\n\nElopement & Wedding photographer in the beautiful Upstate NY.
