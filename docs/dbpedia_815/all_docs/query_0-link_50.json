Color television** vast sphere of Jnfotnce as a \"secret weapon\" in championing the cause of the west- ern democracies will be dra- matically highlighted in Europe this month. Oddly enough, color TV’s two •utstanding contributions to date as an \"international torch bearer.” in (1) cementing a \"free world*' concept as opposed to Soviet totali- tarianism; and (2) establishing tinted video as the most revolu- tionary advance of the 20th Cen- tury in the field of medical science, focusses on Europe,, rather than America, during this month and September. Within the next few days the Columbia Broadcasting System un- veils a number of its color tele- vision receivers in the western zone of Berlin — \"across the street\" from the scene of the Soviet-inspired World Festival of Youth, now in progress, which anticipates a turn- out of 2,000,000 from all over the world before the Festival ends. The idea, of luring the kids over hto the western zone with a \"come- on-a-my-house and see color TV\" as the chief halt was cooked up by the State Dept., and the Economic Cooperation Administration. CBS readily agreed to fall in with the plan, as did Radio Corp. of Amer- ica, which will be repnesented by large-screen black and white TV projection, plus a total of 60 of its 17-inch monochrome receivers. Thrf equipment has been in Europe for several weeks, but it was a case of maintaining strict secrecy to pre- vent possible sabotage.

Benny added that he believed there were many artists in the U. S. who would be glad to come over if some “name” personality like him- self undertook to form a troupe and m.c. it. Benny, who showed the strain of his 21 appearances in the Korean “rice-paddy circuit,” said he would be glad to appear on a national radio broadcast with other stars of stage, screen or radio in a bid to drum * up support for the USO- Camp Shows organization. Benay Venuta’s Suggestion Benay Venuta, singer with the Benny show, tossed out another suggestion which might pay off in increased entertainment for Ko- rean troops. Singer pointed out that Hollywood studio rosters are loaded with the kind of talent need- ed for intimate revues on the GI circuit. Miss Venuta opined that if one studio put together a small variety show of a half-dozen or so acts and sent, it off to Korea, other lots almost certainly would follow suit. Singer pointed out that this device would cost the studios very little since they would be using artists already under contract. Other members of Benny’s Car- nival of Stars troupe, which played to 187,000 UN fighting- men in Korea and several thousand more in Japan and Korea, were screen actress Marjorie Reynolds, tap dancer Delores Gay, pianist and accordionist June Bruner, guitar- ist Frank Remlcy from the Phil Harris oreh, and mentalist Harry Kahne.

Johnston is definite- ly set to return to the presidency of the Motion Picture Assn, of America on Oct. 1, according to insiders here. That's the date his leave of absence from MPA A ex- pires. However, informants are not so certain on how long Johnston in- tends to remain at the association’s helm. They figure he’s gained con- siderable stature in the ESA post and it’s long since been reported that Johnston has political aspira- tions. Reason for his ESA bowout is that he feels his job has been done and a successor could take over with a minimum of difficulty. That the former U. S. Chamber of Com- merce president has handled the ESA reins with good results is acknowledged widely. When John- ston was originally appointed there were numerous skeptics who felt the post was too tough for John- ston, that he probably would lose much political favor because of it. There’s one big consideration. j however, in linking Johnston with any possible public office. While he scored as ESA topper, there are some within Republican Party ranks who feel he was too friendly with the present Administration. To what extent his hand-holding with the Truman Administration will impair his political chances is difficult to determine at this time.

SEC Rule Curbs Offers to Buy Out Hughes’ Control Aside from Howard Hughes’ de- mand that he get a profit on his RKO Theatres Shares, a principal item discouraging interest of pros- pective buyers is a regulation of the Securities & Exchange Com- mission. Known as Rule X10B5, this requires any would-be pur- chaser to olTer the same deal to all other stockholders as he offers to Hughes. While a buyer* may be willing to pay more than the market price for Hughes* 929.020 shares, since they’d give him control of the circuit, he almost certainly would not want to give the same amount for each of the approximately 3.- 000.000 other shares outstanding. The RKO Theatres shares can now be purchased on the New* York Stock Exchange for about $3.50. RKO picture company stock is selling at about the same price. Hughes bought them prior to di- vorcement of the two firms at a combined price of about $9 a share. Reps of the millionaire oil drill king, and pic producer are known to have suggested to negotiators for Louis R. Lurie recently that Hughes wants a profit of $3 on the combined shares. Lurie, wealthy San Francisco realty operator, who has been anxious to buy the com- pany. is said to have laughed at the proposal. Lurie has offered $3 .*50 per share for the theatre stock.

IMS STOCK BO) CUES NEW SETUP Disclosure by Atlas Corp., head- ed by Floyd B. Odium, that it has acquired 76.500 shares of RKO Pic- tures common, has resulted in speculation that Odium is again thinking of taking over the film outfit. The stock buy finds Atlas still a small minority holder, compared with Howard Hughes' ownership of 929.020 shares, but the big invest- ment trust may well continue such acquisitions until it has reached the point of threatening Hughes’ control. When that tim* comes, it's be- lieved Hughes would be more in- clined to sell his holdings back to Atlas, the original owner. The 929.020 shares were purchased by Hughes from Odium in 1948 at close to $9 per share. That was for the old parent corporation. Market value has been running about $7, on the basis of about $3.50 per share each of the two new RKO outfits, the product ion-distrib firm and the theatre affiliate. Short time ago an Odium rep was on the Coast and there were rumors he had huddled with Hughes’ associates. Whether they actually talked a deal was not dis- closed. In any event, the indications continue that Odium is interested in re-acquiring control, either by buying up shares on the open mar- ket or via a direct transaction with Hughes. Odium’s Option Even when the sale was consum- mated in '48. Odium indicated he might want to buy back at a later date. Part of the deal then gave Odium an option\"\"\" to re-purchase the shares by way of matching the price offered by any third party. This right of first-refusal has since been questioned by Hughes. He contends that other parties have made offers to buy the stock and Odium declined to meet the price. The Odium position is that the offers were not sufficiently firm to (Continued on page 63) Krim & Co.

On Aug. 1. 1950, the Department issued a statement named 'Tenta- tive List of Essential Activities.\" which included the production, distribution, and exhibition of pic- tures.

Spyros Skouras, in a deposition in Sam Goldwyn’s antitrust suit, categorically denied that either 20th-Fox, of which he is prez, or National Theatres, 20th‘s theatre j subsidiary, had ever entered into j any agreements with a competitor to remove a free and open market for Goldwyn in the Frisco area so latter couldn't get a fair price for his product. * Taking of Skouras deposition, expected to take several days, was completed in one day. Most of the testimony sought by Goldwyn at- torneys had already been provided by Charles Skouras in an earlier deposition. Under questioning by Joseph L. Alioto, attorney for Goldwyn in Frisco. Skouras asserted nobody would take a chance to discuss such a subject as picture allotments. This was in direct answer to a question whether, after the split between National Theatres and Mi- chael A. Naify, and again after sev- erance of the United Artists Thea- tres and National Theatres ioint operations deal, there had been any discussions about allocation of product. Also established by Skouras was that after the dissolution of UAT and NT by the consent decree. UAT prexy, had become a very ac- tive competitor to NT. Skouras maintained there had never been any discussion on a split of prod- uct on the Coast with Naify; no discussion of clearances and no discussion on allocation.

Cities to UPT Atlanta, Aug. 7. The Arthur Lucas estate Friday (3’ sold its interest in five theatre companies which operate houses in 12 Georgia cities to United Par- amount Theatres, which recently merged with American Broadcast- ing Co. The Lucas sale involved theatres in Augusta, Macon, Colum- bus. Athens. Brunswick. Elberton, Buford, Gainesville. Waycross, Barnesville, St. Simons and Moul- trie. Transfer of the Lucas interests — comprising approximately one- fourth of the stock — was completed in New York. Although no figure was disclosed, it is believed that the deal involved a figure around $1,500,000. Frederick G. Storey, vicepresident of Georgia Theatre Co., and one of the trustees of the estate, conducted the negotiations for the sellers. Mrs. Arthur Lucas and the First National Bank of At- lanta are the other trustees. The five companies involved are the Georgia Theatre Co..

A Technicolored, light, bright musical such as this Betty Grable offering should be a good tonic for a flagging boxoffice. Its grossing possibilities are promising. George Jessel has endowed it with five strong production num- bers and six tunes to make it top- notch escapist musical entertain- ment that will please the song-and- <Unce fan. There's a delightfully bawdy air about some of the num- bers and in the playing and direc- tion to sharpen the chuckles. Richard Sale’s direction of his own script, written with Mafy Loos and suggested by an Erna Lazarus- W. Scott Darling story, whip* it along without a slow movement. The dialog crackles with a smart, racy flavor that scores as adult comedy, and the story framework, a backstage affair, is excellent in holding together the tunes and dances. Y»m concerns a star-producer. Paramount has been only mod- husband-wife team that breaks up erately successful in putting the after seven years of marriage be- J»mes M Barrie play. AUce-Sit H. Allen Smith's humorous satire of a cat that inherits a major league ball club, along with $30- 000.000, transfers to the screen in a fairly satisfactory manner. The 94 minutes running time stretches the materia! rather thin, but there are sufficient laughs to fulfill comedy demands. Payoff should be about average in most situa- tions. helped by Ray Milland for the marquees. Both the script and Arthur Lubin’s direction work hard to pad out the running time, resorting to “Women Without Names,’* French import tradeshown in New York last week, was re- viewed in Variety In the Issue of July 12, 1950.

Carey and Ed- die Albert, longtime suitor of Miss Grable, pursue her, and plenty of comedy touches are poured on for laughs as- they try to protect her from a sea-loving nature boy, neat- ly portrayed by Rory Calhoun, and bring back her memory. After Miss Grable proves she can be a star on her own, she and Carey get to- gether again for a happy windup. Title tune kicks off the musical portions, with Miss Grable singing and dancing it with Steve Condos and Jerry Brandow. She does a similar stint on \"Bettin’ On a Man,” also effectively. The real bright sequences in the song-and-dance department, however, are “It’s a Hot Night in Alaska.” flippantly sold in a honky-tonk style, and “No Talent Joe. ’ with plenty of la. added to the rowdy delivery. Big finale piece is “1 Feel Like Dancing,” which comes over beau- tifully after it gets by the overlong back-alley opening portion. Tunes are all by Jule Styne and Leo Rob- in. and are good, although not par- ticularly outstanding. Firstrate support is supplied right down the line by the long cast. Calhoun and Albert, as the prin- cipal featured players, bolster the entertaining deliveries of Miss Grable and Carey. Fred Clark scores as Carey’s attorney, and Lois Andrews, as the gal who caused all the trouble, clicks strongly. Irene Ryan does well by her flittery maid role. Miss Grable gets topflight dance assists from the uncredited terplng of Jack Cole, who staged the hoof- ing. and Gwen Verdon. Musical direction of Lionel Newman reg- isters well, with the exception of the finale number, in which the tcore is noisily jumbled Barrie piece, back from a five-year stay at the Panama Canal digging to become newlv acquainted with their three offspring, teen-aged Mona Freeman, adolescent David Stollery and baby. Latter is ex- plained as having been born during the Panama Canal stay and brought east by her grandparent. It is Miss Freeman, as the in- volved Amy of the play, who adds the most to the fun. Impressed b a “wicked” play she has seen dea take on a very broad turn when Rhubarb Is kidnapped by gamblers so the Brooklyn club will lose, but the cat Escapes in time to make it to the park and win the series for his club. Some fun Is devel- oped in the delaying action staged to hold up the games until Rhu- barb can be found, and best is the well-staged artificial rain-making that floods the field while leaving the rest of New York dry. Human members of the cast are ing with straying mothera, she mis- generally good. Milland has a pip 7. is- takes her own mother’s friendly intentions to Peter Hanson, young doctor, as indiscreet and aims to save her from the “rake.” Some charm is involved in solving this major situation, as there is in re- acquainting parents and children after the long absence but, despite the better moments, overall impact is only mild and the length of the footage is forced beyond story worth. Performances do much to help. Miss Fontaine is able as the flirta- tious mother, and Lund is good as of a drunk scene, resulting from his separation from Miss Sterling, and she fills the demands of her role acceptably. William Frawley, club manager. Miss Holmes. Tay- lor Holmes. Henry Slate, James J. Griffith, Jim Hayward and I,ock- hart, with his brief stint, are others involved in the comedy. Lionel Lindon does in/ expert Job of lensing. and the special photographic effects by Gordon Jennings are skillful.

Sales values include the Technicolor lensing and suc)i| name* •» John Payne ami Forrest Tucker for the action field. Overall entertainment worth would have hit a stronger level had director-scripter Lewis R. Foster made his characters less complicated, used less footage to tell the story and picked up the pace earlier. Pictorlally, the pro- duction by William H. Pine and William C. Thomas treats the eyes with lush color in sea-and jungle- scapes and benefits from Its Flor- i da-location lensing. Underwater scenes were lensed at Weekiwachee Springs in Florida. Incongruous is the jungle hike during which prin- cipals encounter such unlikely New Guinea creatures as a black panther and an anaconda, plus alligators substituting for crocodilea. Payne is an adventuring master of a sleek schooner plying the Pacific islands. Tucker and Robert Lowery covet the boat as it Wits in with their plana to rob a rich gold shipment by having the ship- ment plane crash in shallow, inland waters. A frame gains them posses- sion of the schooner, the plane is crashed, but aboard It is Rhonda Fleming, war widow who has been drowning her bitter memories in drink and a jungle existence. Payne, accompanied by two raacala, Alan Mowbray and John Abbott, set out to recover the gold and rescue Miss Fleming. Trek runs the gamut of standard pulp fiction adventuring. Group battles irate native Fuzzy- Wuzzies, the elements and the flora and fauna of the New Guinea locale before arriving at the plane crash site, then have to trick Tucker and run through another native siege before the return to civilization is accomplished and the two lovers are able to make the finale clinch. It is not believable but has enough chimerical value to rate in the market at which it is aimed. Trouping is up to the demands made by Foster’s script and direc- tion, neither of which is exacting. Payne is a muscular hero and Tucker a likeable heavy. Miss Fleming takes to Technicolor as the heroine, and the Mowbray- Abbott teaming makes for amusing rascality. Lowery, as the crooked plane pilot, is seen only briefly. Frank Kumagai adds welcome chuckles as Payne’s native handy- man. There are several excellent, but uncredited, performances among the remainder of the cast. Script was adapted by Thomson Burtis from his novel. “New Guinea Gold,” and gets good color lensing from Loyal Griggs. Music score by Lucien Cailliet is good and there is one tune used for a story point. It is the title number defied by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. Brog.

Both the screenplav and Douglas Sirk’s obvious direction tip off tha conclusion early so there is no element of surprise in what tran- spires. Sink also mUhandle: soma of the playefe, notably Miss Blyth. who is made to overplay her character.

Roach said that Monogram pub- licity release stating he had sold the tele rights to a N. Y. syndicate, headed by David Stillman, mis- quoted him. He had sold his 50% interest in the series, he added, bur subject to Kerman’s contract, letter bought teevee theatrical re- issue righta from Roach three years ago on a 15-year lease basis. Kerman has the power to sell or distribute to video. Roach's In- terest is only on a profit-sharing basis Roach stated he had sold his interests for less than the $300,000 figure quoted by Mono- Rram. which had bought reissue rights from Auerbach who. in turn, had purchased them from Kerman. There’s still some dispute as to when the series will be released, Roach claiming they were sold on a 1 when available” basis, with Kerman countering he has a letter of availability. Roach said he had received a “substantial” advance, against profits, for selling his in- terest to the Stillman group be- cause he wanted money for video production, mulling a series along the lines of “Gang.”* Just where Mono fits into the picture is anybody’s guess.

Mags for ‘Sun’ Longtime dispute among indus- try advertising and distribution men over national vs. co-op adver- tising came to the fore again this week with disclosure by Paramount of a significant reversal in polity. After five years of steadily veering from national mags toward con- centration on local exhib-placed copy. Par was revealed to be sink- ing $190,000 in national and fan mags on “Place In the Sun.” That’s the heaviest magjexpendi- ture by the company since 1046. Closest approach was on ‘The Heiress” two years ago. when $90.- 000 went into fans and nationals. Most telling point in the switch in emphasis is that the sum is far be- yond what went into “Samson and Delilah” nationally, although more was spent in co-op on the Cecil B. De Mille spectacle. Expenditure does not mark a permanent change In policy, pub- ad chief Jerry Pickman said In New York Monday (6>. It was felt only that this particular picture merited such establishment on a national basis, he explained. Fan mags are getting $40,000 in unprecedented full coverage with double-trucks in color.

That's the only conclusion to be drawn from discussions at the Council of Motion Picture Organi- zations’ Coast roundtable recently and from a new poll of small-town audience preferences. Theatremen and public were equally contradic- tory in analyzing tastes that put coin in the b.o. Exhibs at the Beverly Hills seminar came in with squawks On production of “message” pictures: production of too many westerns and on the industry’s tendency to make pix in “cycles.” When pinned down In each case by production reps at the forums, it developed that various films in all the “squawk” categories had done very good business. Theatre operators were forced to admit that It would be unfor- tunate for Hollywood to be pro- scribed from trying any subject that popped into the head of one of its creative people. To so limit freedom of action in the past, ex- hibs were forced to agree with the producers, would have meant failure to make some of the in- dustry’s J^iggest grossers — from “The Covered Wagon” to ‘The Great Caruso.” In every case, the Hollywood dis- continued on page 13) Triple Header New Haven, Aug. 7.

Y., last week after the company assertedly still refused to grant five workers severance pay. Dismissed more than six weeks ago were Milton Silver. Jack McCabe and A1 Slepp of the publicity de- partment, plus Irving Kerr and Jack Harris in the art depart- ment Union previously held sporadic picketing but reportedly gaow plans frequent demonstrations during the noon hour. It’s charged that al- though Republic had a .contract with the Screen Publicists Guild (now absorbed in SEG) for about 10 years, the firm is now disre- garding It. In meetings with union reps a Republic spokesman ia said to have been \"very bland” about the matter and assured the dele- gates that “it will all be settled.” SEG claims that Rep’s action in dismissing the five workers Is in “direct violation of a provision in a union contract which entitled the employees to severance pay.” It’s understood that the company's at- titude is that when SPG moved into SEG. along with the old Screen Office and Professional Em- ployees Guild, the pact was auto- matically nullified.. Joseph McMahon, secretary of Republic, who handles the com- pany's Dbor relations, could not be reached for comment. Now on va- cation, he’s scheduled to return to N. Y. next Monday (13).
