        "text": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rapid development of its creative abilities, pose the necessary question about of to whom the copyright of these creations is guaranteed should be granted. AI&#39;s stand-alone programs perform different creative functions that result in new copyrightable works, such as composing songs, drawing, or creating new paintings. This thesis seeks to answer this question of who the owner of copyright of works created by AI should be, and how to apply the solution considering the legal requirements for allocating copyright. Part of the research takes a historical approach to the copyright law and AI. Allocating copyright to AI-generated works is a modern challenge faced by legal systems around the world. Copyright law has evolved from the first known disputes, through the protection of publishers and booksellers in the 17th century, to the romantic discourse of the right of author in Europe in the 18th century, to the protection of the right o...\n\nThis chapter focuses on a series of copyright cases between professional photographers and press publishers that followed the emergence of the photographically illustrated press in the United States during the late 1880s and 1890s. Though improvements in halftone printing technology during this period would seem to offer new partnerships between photographers and the press, the early decades of the photographically illustrated press were plagued by contentious copyright cases between them. In these cases, photographers sought to recoup damages from publishers who reproduced their work without permission or recompense. In turn, the press fought to maintain a cheap and ready body of appealing photographs to reprint. To document the rocky merger of photography and the press in the United States, this chapter will examine photographers’ concerns about halftone reproductions as well as copyright cases and legislation that pitted the interests of photographers against those of the press. First, the business practices of professional photographers, such as Benjamin J. Falk, will be considered to understand why many saw the photographically illustrated press as a threat. The chapter will then turn to the 1895 Amendment of the Copyright Act, which press publishers lobbied for in response to photographers’ initial success in pursuing copyright cases against them. Finally, the chapter will examine two copyright cases, Bolles v. Outing Co. (1899) and Falk v. Curtis Publishing Co. (1900), in which the power of the press was further solidified. Though Falk and other photographers sought to constrain the press through the legal system, their strategy backfired and, ultimately, this chapter shows that shifts in copyright law in part permitted the photographically illustrated press to thrive.\n\nArtificial intelligence systems can now produce complex artistic and literary works without human authorial contribution. However, considering the absence of authorship, they are currently not covered by copyright law. In past decades, many scholars argued for their protection but did not thoroughly address their claim under a copyright rationale. Building on this literature, this paper will propose a more comprehensive policy framework for the copyrightability of computer-generated works. It will analyze the Canadian Copyright Act under the foundational principle of the advancement of knowledge, which lies in its economic purpose. This objective focuses primarily on the extrinsic features of works, superseding the ambiguous notion of creativity and thus relegating authorship to a secondary role. Since computer-generated works also share with the public “expressive” knowledge, this paper will suggest allocating exclusive economic rights to the persons who arrange them. It can incent..."
