This issue carries the chapter news reports from more alumnae chapters than ever before.\n\nOur updated AlphaLink reporting system must have worked, because the number of chapters reporting nearly tripled over last year. I am\n\nfully aware that regardless of the worthwhile or trending topics that To Dragma covers, members always want to read news on their collegiate and alumnae chapters. With 135 active collegiate chapters and 160 active alumnae chapters, that can be a big challenge. So it is with pleasure\n\nthat this issue of To Dragma brings you the latest news from 90 of our alumnae chapters.\n\nCollegiate chapters are not being overlooked in this issue either.\n\nAfter the brutal winter most of us experienced, it seemed fitting to acknowledge the chapters and members who gave up personal time during spring break to do something especially meaningful. Alternative Spring Break trips have been popular for years with countless AOIIs contributing. We take an inside look at some of the opportunities that occurred this spring and the rewards that were reaped.\n\nThe Fraternity has been busy too! Four new collegiate chapters have been installed since To Dragma last went to print. Three were the long awaited reinstallations for Phi Delta (U of Wisconsin - Milwaukee), Kappa Delta (Wright State U), and Pi Omicron (Austin Peay State U); and one was a brand new installations for Alpha Epsilon (Wingate U). Growth keeps coming as we colonized at U of Nevada, Reno this spring and have more new colonies coming next fall.\n\nFor Leadership Academy 2015 in February, the Fraternity brought in our Collegiate CPs, VPs of Standards and the Standards Advisers. Because AOII is committed to both the safety of our members and to providing valuable membership experiences, the training of these important officers and advisors was a priority. Programming was designed to help leaders make wise decisions for themselves and their chapters, and how to teach others to make positive choices. The event was extremely well attended and successful.\n\nExcitement is building for Convention this summer in Los Angeles! We hope you will be joining us in person, but if not, you can rest assured that To Dragma will be bringing you the highlights in our next issue.\n\nRegards,\n\nMariellen Perkinson Sasseen\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma\n\nof Alpha Omicron Pi\n\nTo Dragma is the official magazine of Alpha Omicron Pi Fraternity, and has been published since 1905.

Arthritis\n\n2015 FRATERNITY EVENTS\n\nGet ready for a great season of Strike Out Arthritis! fundraising with Alpha Omicron Pi Fraternity! In 2010, AOII began planning community events with professional baseball teams to further the reach of our Strike Out Arthritis! campaign. Money raised through these events goes directly to the AOII Foundation’s Arthritis Fund for arthritis research, awareness, educational programming and resources. This is in addition to money raised by many outstanding collegiate and alumnae chapter SOA! events each year. Here you will find events that are scheduled so far for 2015. Other dates\n\nwill be announced soon - use our social media info below to stay updated! If you would like to plan an event with a team that is not listed here, contact Rachel Boison at rboison@alphaomicronpi. org.

The Foundation provides assistance to families with children battling pediatric cancer.\n\nViewpoint\n\nIt has been an honor to serve AOII and its members during such an exceptional time in our Fraternity’s history. The strength of our organization is at an unparalleled level due to each member’s effort to “Exceed The Expectations” of our 2011-2015 Strategic Plan. Its key initiatives of Member Experience, Membership Growth, Financial Management, and Positioning AOII as an Inter-Fraternal Leader provided a strong guide for our collective efforts over the past four years and the outcomes have\n\nbeen phenomenal! I look forward to sharing this good news in detail at Convention.\n\nWhile Convention is always very special, one of my favorite events during my time as International President has been attending our annual Leadership Academy. It consistently provided an avenue for targeted programming as well as best practice sharing. I feel blessed to have had many meaningful conversations with chapter representatives during this\n\nevent which aren’t always possible during quick visits and/\n\nor other larger occasions. You’ll read about this year’s “To Protect and To Serve” academy which focused on thoughtful programming to assist our members in taking care of one another. At a time of unprecedented consideration given to campus sexual assault and bystander behavior issues, the need for strong resources related to these topics was extremely relevant. As sisters, we must consistently take action to\n\nassist our sisters and not be bystanders. As a fellow National president stated, “It isn’t always easy, but is always necessary.” Ensuring the safety and well-being of our sisters must be our highest priority as we exercise vigilant awareness of situations\n\nin our environment. We must support our sisters who have been victims of assault as we promise one another to be that friend upon whom there is no fear to call. This is a complex issue and one that is not confined to times as a collegian; it is one that may impact alumnae for the rest of their lives.\n\nThankfully, AOII’s connectivity does not occur just during our college years. AOII is a lifetime journey filled with personal enrichment and friendship. In this issue, you will find many examples of the fun and sisterhood associated with joining an AOII Alumnae Chapter. When visiting with alumnae, I am always struck by the longevity and strength of relationships built beyond collegiate chapter boundaries. Whether it is as a bridesmaid, Godmother, career mentor, or simply a wonderful friend, the support of our sisters is what makes AOII so special. I imagine our Founders would be thrilled to see the significant impact of their beloved organization on its members.\n\nAOII is an extraordinary and dynamic organization. I encourage all members to consider expanding their level of engagement to courageously strengthen our Fraternity. It takes each one of us to continue our efforts in advancing AOII to its fullest potential. To the thousands of collegians and volunteers who work tirelessly on behalf of this organization, I offer heart-felt gratitude for your dedicated service. It has been such a privilege to serve our beloved AOII and look forward to celebrating together at Convention!\n\nAllison Allgier International President\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma • 7\n\nFraternityNews\n\nSpring 2015 Colonization\n\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno Delta Nu Chapter\n\n• Colonization Date: March 1, 2015\n\n• Colonizing Officer: Rebecca Herman\n\n• Colonization Team: Rebecca Herman, Sarah Blank, Haley Mruz, Emily\n\nMurray, Mary Kate Sweeney, Heather Hays, Troy LeForge, Whitney Frazier,\n\nDebbie Tam, Liz Pietsch\n\n• Collegiate Chapter Assistance: Delta Sigma, Sigma, Xi Rho, Zeta Theta\n\nFall 2015 Colonizations\n\nRecruitment Ambassador Program\n\nWe are excited to announce the launch of a new program that will provide additional training and support to our collegiate chapter members and alumnae advisers.

Chapters already established on campus include: Alpha Delta Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta and Sigma Sigma Sigma.\n\n8 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nRetained & Engaged\n\nAOII Partners with Phired Up Productions\n\nThe Fraternity has an exciting partnership with our Interfraternal “Phriends” at Phired Up Productions, a company dedicated to growing fraternities and sororities. AOII and Phired Up have developed a custom curriculum for our chapters called Retained\n\n& Engaged. Several chapters were part of a pilot program last fall, and this semester every chapter has been granted access. Retained & Engaged is based on our own membership retention research and greatly supports chapters by not letting issues of disengagement or dissatisfaction with AOII turn into suspended memberships.\n\nWe’ve made accessing the entire program easy! Go to our Fulfilling the Promise website at edu.alphaomiconpi.org to discover application activities that chapters can utilize as an LC, in small groups or committees, or as a full chapter. Each lesson module gives specific and easy instructions for how to facilitate discussions, what to ask, fun videos to watch and ideas for activities depending on the needs of individual chapters. There’s literally a resource map to point you in any direction you need to go! It’s an amazing way to retain and engage our entire sisterhood.\n\nFive Reasons to Celebrate!\n\nCongratulations to Alpha Chi on their 50th Anniversary!\n\nOn the weekend of April 10th–12th, the sisters of Alpha Chi (Western Kentucky U) celebrated their 50th anniversary. Alpha Chi Chapter was installed on May 8, 1965. Grace Houston, Executive Board Vice President, was in attendance for a presentation to recognize the chapter’s special anniversary. An engraved crystal bowl was purchased for the chapter by AOII Fraternity to honor this event.\n\nCongratulations to Upsilon on their 100th Anniversary!\n\nThe sisters of the Upsilon Chapter (U of Washington) celebrated their 100th anniversary on April 10th –12th, 2015. The chapter was installed on September 18, 1915. Amber Countis, Executive Board Vice President, attended their celebration and AOII Fraternity purchased new ritual robes for the chapter to honor the centennial celebration.\n\nCongratulations to Indianapolis Alumnae on their 100th Anniversary!\n\nThe sisters of the Indianapolis Alumnae Chapter in Indiana celebrated their 100th anniversary on April 18th. The chapter was installed on May 1, 1915. Ann Gilchrist, AOII Past International President, was in attendance to recognize the chapter’s centennial celebration. AOII Fraternity purchased a special engraved double brick that will be installed in the Brick Walkway at AOII International Headquarters to honor the occasion.\n\nCongratulations to Chicago West Suburban Alumnae on their 75th Anniversary!\n\nThe sisters of Chicago West Suburban Alumnae Chapter in Illinois celebrated their 75th anniversary on April 26th. The chapter was installed on April 14, 1940. Gayle Fitzpatrick, Executive Board Vice President, was in attendance to honor the chapter’s special anniversary. AOII Fraternity has purchased a special engraved double brick that will be installed in the Brick Walkway at AOII International Headquarters to honor the occasion.\n\nCongratulations to Monroe Alumnae on their 50th Anniversary!\n\nOn May 2nd, the sisters of Monroe Alumnae Chapter celebrated their 50th anniversary. The chapter was installed on May 20th, 1965. Krista Whipple, Executive Board Vice President of Finance, was in attendance to celebrate this chapter’s special milestone. AOII Fraternity has purchased a gift to honor the chapter for this occasion.\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015 To Dragma • 9\n\nSpring Breaks of Service\n\nSince students started organizing and participating in alternative break trips in the early 1980s, millions of hours of community service have benefitted the students volunteering and those they help. With the values of service and leadership emphasized in our Fraternity, it is no wonder that many AOIIs forgo vacations for their spring breaks to spend time helping others. The featured women here who discuss their individual experiences were moved by the impact they made, and hope that you can find inspiration in their trips as well. As does a week on the beach with friends creates lasting memories for college spring breakers, a week dedicated to selfless service also creates lasting memories for those whom they have helped.\n\nTwo AOIIs from different collegiate chapters were united by their desire to help others on a trip providing dental and optometry care to children in rural Panama. Morgan McDowell, Alpha Pi (Florida State U) and Natalie Nuckolls, Lambda Sigma (U of Georgia), both pre-dental students, learned more about their future careers while also learning about a new culture.\n\nMorgan said, ”Coming back to FSU with memories like the ones we made in Panama changes the way other students see spring break. It opens the eyes of college students to the opportunities that are out there for our generation to change the world. While I can use the knowledge I gained in the dental clinics as I matriculate into dental school, the picture is bigger than that. It’s not just about dentistry, it’s about growing as an individual and helping those in need.\n\n“One day, a little girl around five years old was diagnosed as needing several extractions. To treat her, we needed a parent to come. She promised us the next\n\nday she would bring her father back, even though he had work and her mother abandonedtheirfamilyofninechildren.” Morgancontinued,“Wealsodiagnosed several of her siblings, and she made sure we knew her dad would be there for all of their treatments as well. The family showed up first thing the next morning. This five- year-old girl was able to coordinate her entire family getting treatment! When the time came for her extractions, she panicked like any little girl would, and I watched her go from a seemingly responsible adolescent to the child she actually is.\n\n“Serving others brings me the most joy out of any of my endeavors in life. It is so rewarding to give to others, especially when you combine it with something you’re passionate about. I joined a sorority to meet women who felt the same way. The planning and execution of our trip wouldn’t have been possible for me without the opportunities AOII gave me through our philanthropies first.\n\n“Natalie and I ended up being incredibly similar people. We divided into two teams, and she was a leader for her group, holding everyone together with her sweet and genuine personality. It’s incredible that two individuals from two different schools could end up in a rural town in Panama together, and immediately form a bond based on the Ritual that we share and consider a foundation in our lives.”\n\n10 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nLaura Johnson, an Alpha Chi (Western Kentucky U) alumna, gained hands-on experience for her position as a Graduate Assistant in Student Affairs by coordinating an alternative spring break trip to Tuscaloosa, AlabamainMarch. EmilyPride,KelliFleming,andHannahReed,alsoof Alpha Chi, were among the eight students putting up drywall, installing plumbing, and sodding yards for homes damaged by a tornado that ravaged through the college town three years ago.\n\nIn addition to the experience these women gained in home repairs\n\nand carpentry, they also gained an appreciation for their ability to serve others. Laura explained, “Ironically, many students set a goal for the week to appreciate the roof over their head that they have at home and many other blessings, and then throughout the week, we find ourselves actually working on shingling and repairing a roof. Throughout all my experiences, serving others may not sound like the most desirable, but it is the most rewarding. Sometimes I feel selfish about the warmth I get in my heart after a day of serving others. I not only know I am helping others, but it also helps put my life into a better perspective. “\n\nEmily also found a significant personal impact from the trip. “From hearing the stories of people we worked with, I realized that we have been given a set number of days here on the earth, and in an instant all of that can change. Therefore, we need to make the most out of every moment we have been given. I will take back from the trip the power of service. I have been so fortunate and others might have not been as fortunate; it is my duty to them to serve.\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nKayla Spodek, Omega Upsilon (Ohio U) took her passion of helping others overseas as she traveled to Israel to help develop the Negev desert area. “I went with a group of 15 young adults age 18-30 and volunteered at different service sites to help with the rebuild. The goal of the trip\n\nwas to give back to the land of Israel in the area that the original prime minister of Israel, David Ben Gurion, had dreams of building up and having people build their families and work in the Negev.”\n\nKayla continued, “I think the biggest highlight of the trip was seeing the reactions on the children’s faces after we completed a lot of the projects. One of the best memories is when we were building a room and creating some fake grass for the children to have shade under when it became extremely hot during the summer months. They were so excited when it was all finally built that they had such big smiles on their faces and immediately got into the hammock that was attached underneath the roof and started rolling around in the grass.” Kayla and her group also prepared a garden for economically-disadvantaged residents, built benches for children at a kindergarten, made candy baskets to deliver to visitors of a soup kitchen, painted a fence around a farm, and cleared an urban green space.\n\n“Between being an AOII and being on this trip, I have learned a lot about giving back to others. I have learned that it is a huge part of life, and it’s a way of life that should be followed by everyone. By giving back to others, you are able to make a difference in their lives that they might not be able to accomplish if they did not have help from others like myself. By giving back, you are able to really impact someone’s life forever. You are able to get so much out of giving back to others. For me personally, I get a warm feeling in my heart seeing the smiles on people’s faces for the small or big task that was done for them.”\n\nTo Dragma • 11\n\nKatie Alcox of Omega Chapter (Miami U) traveled to New Orleans with a group of students to combine volunteering with fun as they completed several service projects each day of the trip. Two of her highlights include canoeing along a river to pick up trash and preparing 12,250 pounds of turnips for food banks!\n\n“Something I have learned while serving others is that you aren’t always going to see the immediate effects of your work. I say this because a\n\nlot of the service that we did would be considered ‘behind the scenes’ work. For example, we spent a great deal of time working in a food bank preparing and sorting items for them. I think a lot of times when I think of service, I think of helping someone directly, like serving them food, or helping them with their yard work. However, this trip really showed me that there are many way to serve that others don’t usually see that are equally important.”\n\nRochelle Toth, Alpha Psi (Bowling Green State U), had the opportunity\n\nas a Coordinator of Fraternity and Sorority Life at Ohio State University\n\nto be the advisor for a service trip to build habitats for bears at Forest Animal Rescue, a lifetime care sanctuary for non-releasable wild animals in Florida. Among the nine students joining her on the trip was Rochelle’s student employee, Veronica Havran-Vena, Chi Epsilon (Ohio State U). Veronica explained, “The work our very diverse group of students was able to complete in just four days was inspiring. We worked harder each day with the progress from the day before being our competition. One of my favorite parts was being able to share the experience with our advisor and AOII alumna Rochelle.”\n\nDespite the intense Florida heat and long days, the team persevered and found their efforts to be beneficial not only to themselves, but those at Forest Animal Rescue. Rochelle recognized how easily she could apply AOII’s values during the trip. “This was definitely a week were I lived our Ritual every day. I was able to take a step back from my daily routine\n\nand really focus on others. I was able to let my light shine by doing hard physical work that I didn’t think I was capable of and push through to better someone else’s life. “\n\nRochelle added, “Through this trip I was also able to live AOII’s values ofserviceandleadership. Iwasabletoperformserviceeveryday,and not just passive service, but service that I was able to learn from and to directly interact with the people (and animals) that we were serving. I was also able to demonstrate leadership through advising this group of students throughout the trip, not just telling them what to do, but by assistingthemindevelopingsolutionsontheirown.“ Shecontinued, “Not only does it feel good personally to serve others, but to see a difference and the impact that you make on others really is what the experience is about. AOII, as well as this service opportunity, has shown me the impact of the power of one and being the person you choose tobe. Ihavethepowertochoosetobegivingandserving,andtolive congruently with my values, as well as individually impacting others. “\n\n12 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nHaley Cooper and Marisa Turner of Alpha Lambda Chapter (Georgia Southern U) participated in separate volunteer spring break trips working with people with disabilities, but both discovered much about themselves, those they served, and exemplifying AOII’s values.\n\nHaley worked with Community Upliftment for the Mentally Ill (CUMI) in Montego Bay, Jamaica, a group that provides a home for the homeless and opportunities to learn life skills. A highlight of her trip was making bracelets and necklaces with an elderly woman who had been going\n\nto CUMI for over 14 years. The woman was so proud of Haley for her handiwork, and that bonding moment was one of the most touching of Haley’s life.\n\n“I learned that the majority of homeless people suffer from mental\n\nillness. Adultswhosufferfrommentalillnessareverymisunderstoodand treatedpoorly. Thosesufferingfrommentalissuesarestillpeople,they justhappentobedifferent. Itwaslifechangingtobeabletointeractand hear the trials and tribulations of these amazing people. Although my trip was in another country, I experienced many of the problems that we have here in the United States. I can bring back to my campus the value of respecting others, especially anyone with a mental illness. I hope to break that negative stereotype on campus, to combat such negativities about people who cannot help how they were born.”\n\nOf the significance AOII has on her willingness to serve others, Haley said, “AOII was founded on a promise to serve the community, not justeachother. Byvolunteering,Iwasabletoreachoutandservein another country. It was amazing to be able to reach out and learn about a whole new culture and be able to help people within this culture. AOII has amazing values that I always try to live out. However, being able to spread them around the world was a feeling that is indescribable.”\n\nMarisa stayed closer to home by assisting at a camp for disabled people of all ages with the help of students from all over the country. Just as Haley connected with the elderly woman in Jamaica, Marisa made a lasting bond with one of her campers. “One camper in particular touched my heart. She was 23 and had cerebral palsy, and I loved talking with her and helping her throughout the day. Toward the end of the break, she told me at dinner, ‘I want to see you after camp.’ Even though it was a small statement, it meant a lot that she enjoyed spending time with me as much as I did with her.”\n\n“I learned to appreciate even the smallest things in life, such as being able to get out of bed in the morning on my own and even just getting a hair out of my face. Some of my campers couldn’t do those things. I now feel more comfortable around people with disabilities, and I can encourage others to do the same.”\n\nby Kimberly Sons, Beta Phi (Indiana U),\n\nAssistant Director of Education and Resource Development\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma • 13\n\nWhy I Volunteer\n\nIt’s no secret that volunteers are an indispensable part of our organization. At every level, volunteers are dedicating their time and resources into bettering AOII in one way or another. We reached out to a few sisters who put into their own words why giving back to our Fraternity means so much to them.\n\nMarianne Stern\n\nChapter Adviser, Epsilon Chi Chapter\n\nBy volunteering for AOII, I get to make good on the promise I made all those years ago - to further the interests of our Fraternity and to try to be a credit to both the Faternity and my university. I have the opportunity to have a closer relationship with the future of our Fraternity.\n\nI give back because it has given so much to me since I accepted a bid in 1998. It has given me my sisters. It has helped to shape me into the woman I am today. It has fulfilled its promises to me, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to fulfill my promise of Fraternity and love. My AOII sisters were beside me on my wedding day. When my children were born, AOII sisters were the first to hold them after me and my husband. They are the ones I call when I need a shoulder to cry on or to celebrate good news.\n\nJanet Evers\n\nNetwork Specialist-Recruitment, Network 2\n\nClara Tomsula\n\nNetwork Specialist-Alumnae, Network 8\n\nAOII has given me so much. I would not be the leader that I am today without the mentoring I have received as a collegian and alumna. I want to give back and give other women the oppor- tunity to grow. I learn from the collegians, alumnae younger than me, and alumnae older than me. Also, there is a lot of satisfaction in seeing a fellow sister grow.\n\nThe lifelong friendships that I have developed over the years are invaluable to me. Most of my AOII friendships are with women not from my collegiate chapter. I love seeing the com- mon bond we all share as AOIIs.\n\nRene Fitzgerald\n\nNetwork Specialist-Alumnae, Network 6\n\nTo volunteer for our AOII lets me be an example for our younger sisters as well as for alumnae that AOII is indeed a lifetime journey. I have many ‘favorite parts’ of volunteering. I love the personal contacts I have with my alumnae chapters. It is so gratifying to guide them to having successful chapters and to foster the sisterhoods that result.\n\nI keep coming back to guiding alumnae chapters for the sat- isfaction of seeing our sisters continue their dedication to the Fraternity, seeing them living our Ritual and watching their commitment to volunteering in their communities.\n\nI had an amazing collegiate experience. I really developed a love and respect for this organization and what it does for its members. I learned what I was capable of as a leader. This was largely due to the dedicated advisors that worked with my chapter. I give back because I want women to walk away from their collegiate experience having gained from AOII as much as I did.\n\nMy favorite part of advising/volunteering has to be the friendships that I have made with women throughout this organization. When I started serving as a Network Specialist, I knew that I would enjoy getting to know the collegians and working with the chapters on Re- cruitment Plans, Bid Day, and PR plans. What I did not realize is that I would develop amazing friendships with the advisors, network team, HQ Staff and other volunteers. AOII continues to provide me with friendships for a lifetime.\n\nIt has been so rewarding watching each chapter that I work with continue to grow, knowing that I have played a small part in that growth. I truly receive more than I give, and I am always grateful for the role that AOII has played in my life.\n\n14 • To Dragma Issue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nMelissa Schoenfeld\n\nNetwork Director, Network 1\n\nVolunteering for AOII has provided me with many opportunities for personal development, including improving my leadership and networking skills, and the enjoyment of working closely with my network team members. I give back to the Fraternity because I have benefited in many ways from my membership with AOII and I want the same social, educational, and philanthropic experiences to be available for all members.\n\nI am proud of what we can accomplish as an organization. From our collegiate chapters, alumnae community, the AOII Foundation programs, and everything in between, there are many things that keep me involved with AOII.\n\nBrandi Nunnery\n\nAlumnae Chapter President, Nashville Area Alumnae Chapter\n\nThe huge return on investment for volunteering for our Fraternity impacts many aspects of my life, and has so for years. I view the aspects of my life such as church leader, professional leader, and AOII leader as contributory to and influential on each other. I take lessons learned from training, workshops, sisterhood events, fundraisers, and service projects and apply them to other endeav- ors in the big picture of \"my world\" as a servant leader.\n\nI was never an accomplished athlete or musician. I don't have\n\none huge, stand-out talent. And this may sound funny, but I'm \"GOOD\" at AOII. I'm a good sister. I'm devoted to our Ritual and our Founders. I'm a good sorority leader. I believe in the true purpose of our organization. I give back because I know what I contribute to our organization is valuable and worthy.\n\nMegan Morris\n\nNetwork Specialist-Leadership, Network 7\n\nI love volunteering for AOII! I keep coming back because I like being a part of something bigger! I get so much satisfac- tion from partnering with chapters, brainstorming ideas and seeing them accomplish their goals. I feel a sense of pride belonging to such an amazing organization. I truly enjoy helping officers and advisers work through problems, brain- storm ideas and ultimately accomplish their goals.\n\nI believe that AOII definitely helped mold me into who I am today. I greatly appreciated the advisers who helped me as a collegian, and I know how important it is to have someone there to answer questions, be a sounding board, and to help empower the chapter and AAC. I give back because women before me were my mentors, friends and voice of reason in hard times, and I hope to be the same to the collegians and advisers now.\n\nThe sisters I have met near and far keep me coming back. Our love for our Fraternity binds us, and our mutual respect for each other help us flourish in our own lives. I'm inspired by our his- tory, encouraged by our successes, and profoundly thankful for our Fraternity.\n\nChristian Smith\n\nStandards Adviser, Lambda Sigma Chapter\n\nMy favorite thing about advising is meeting all the wonder- ful young women that come through AOII’s doors. The amazing women make me proud to be their sister and to see how they are evolving to become great members of society after they graduate.\n\nI think what keeps me coming back to AOII is knowing that without the wonderful advisors I had during college, my experience as an AOII might not have been as wonderful as it was. So, I hope to be able to be that wonderful advisor for many women and that maybe one day they will give back as an adviser also.\n\nShari Kagan\n\nNetwork Director, Network 3\n\nWhen volunteering for AOII, I feel a sense of purpose greater than myself and my world. My favorite part is when I get to help other sisters. This could be supporting a fellow volunteer as they learn a new role, helping one of my collegiate chapters sort out a problem, helping another sister understand our ritual, or helping a sister make it through a difficult time.\n\nI give my time to AOII because AOII has given so much to me. When I graduated, I joined an alumnae chapter, and the women I met have become some of my dearest friends. I began volunteering for them to support our chapter and to show my appreciation for\n\nall they have done for me in the good times and in the not so good times. Through the offices I held in my alumnae chapter, I began to meet more AOIIs, and I began to serve on a larger scale, giving back to the many women who have become such an important part of my personal support network.\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma • 15\n\nChapter Reinstallation 76th\n\nPhi Delta - University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\n\nOn December 7, 2014, Alpha Omicron Pi happily welcomed our 76th chartered collegiate chapter back in to our order\n\nas the Phi Delta Chapter at the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee was reinstalled. The weekend’s events included a Ceremony of Transition and Rose Reception in addition to the Initiation and Installation Rituals. Presiding over the weekend as the installing officer was Allison Allgier, International President. The newly installed chapter enjoyed celebrating this accomplishment at their Rose Reception with members of\n\nthe UWM community, family, and friends, as well as many alumnae members of Phi Delta Chapter, AOII alumnae, and collegiate members.\n\nThe chapter is represented by the phrase “Friendship – Dignity” as their submotto, and following 10 weeks of bonding and laying the groundwork for their new chapter, 54 women were initiated into Phi Delta.\n\nIn their time as a colony, the women were able to experience AOII sisterhood events, campus and community events, and AOII events with collegiate women and alumnae. Their first Chapter President, Jes Cattle, summed up her experience thus far at the chapter’s Rose Reception. Guests were able to hear about the Phi Delta journey, and Jes wrapped up her time by stating, “When I first joined AOII I searched through various quotes, and one will forever stick out to me, ‘looking in you cannot understand it, and looking out you cannot explain it.’ Hearing\n\nit a short two months later I still cannot explain it, and I think that is kind of the point. AOII has become something that none of us had but now cannot seem to live without. To top off the incredible bond we share, I have the great honor of being Phi Delta’s first Chapter President and I feel like the luckiest person in the world because I have the pleasure of leading this group of talented, beautiful and driven young women.”\n\n16 • To Dragma\n\nIssue No. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nSubmotto:\n\nFriendship - Dignity\n\nCampus & Community Involvement:\n\n• Participated in Polar Plunge supporting the Special Olympics of Wisconsin.\n\n• Participated in AOII’s Delta Rho Chapter Spike Out Arthritis!

Allison Allgier, AOII’s International President, was the installing officer for Pi Omicron Chapter at Austin Peay State University. This was a momentous celebration for our colony women and the many Pi Omicron alumnae who have been looking forward to the reactivation of their collegiate chapter.\n\nThe colony members immediately hit the ground running. The women wasted no time getting involved on campus and in the Clarkesville community. The chapter participated in Austin Peay’s homecoming festivities in the fall semester, in which they came in first place in the float competition, and consistently came together to plan sisterhood events to cultivate the chapter’s bond.\n\nLaken Bowling, Pi Omicron’s Chapter President, said it best during her speech at the chapter’s Rose Banquet, “As a colony member of Pi Omicron, it is important to realize how critical it is for us to keep [our] bond close. We are now the foundation of the Pi Omicron Chapter that will be built on for years to come. As our dear founding sister Stella said, ‘Yours is a noble\n\ntask: To feed your own life, Alpha Omicron Pi’s life, the life of the hungry world, from the good seed just placed within your hands.”\n\nLaken continued “As founding members we promise to feed our own lives with the values of AOII in order to create the best version of ourselves that we can be. We will be there\n\nfor each of our sisters as they build themselves up and will allow no sister to be broken down. It is our job to give back\n\nto Alpha Omicron Pi in all that we do. In bringing new members in so our chapter thrives, in creating an image worthy of our letters, and in our choices that we make throughout\n\nour lives. We will give back to our community and all who cross our paths by being philanthropic. We will always have our sisters who come before us to offer support, advice, and wisdom for all of our obstacles we face. We have our sisters who come after us to hold us accountable for all that we\n\ndo. We are no longer alone, and it is no longer just about us. We are a part of something much bigger than ourselves and this chapter; we are a part of a lifelong sisterhood.”\n\n18 • To Dragma\n\nIssue No. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nCampus and\n\nCommunity Involvement\n\n• The colony placed first in their first Homecoming float competition.

Allison Allgier, International President, served as the installing officer during the Initiation and Installation Ceremonies.\n\nThe chapter kicked off the weekend’s festivities on January 24 with their Ceremony of Transition where Alpha Epsilon’s charter members gathered to celebrate and reflect on their journey from colonization to initiation\n\nand installation. Emily DeHaven, Alpha Epsilon’s Network Specialist- Development, led the transition alongside several of the chapter’s advisers. The following day began\n\nwith the installation of the chapter along with the initiation of members and installation of chapter officers. That evening a Rose Reception was held to recognize the chapter.

They feel it is important for their chapter to have these ideals long after the colony class has completed their collegiate journey.\n\nDuring their time as a colony, Alpha Epsilon was able to experience the many wonderful aspects of being Greek at Wingate and what it means to be a member of AOII. The members participated in sisterhood bonding activities, colony meetings and many University and\n\nGreek wide-events during their colony period. Rebecca Shaw, Alpha Epsilon charter member and current Chapter President, commented on her life-changing experience as a charter member. She said, “My experience within Alpha Epsilon has been phenomenal. There have been many times where we had to come together as a chapter and think about the future of Alpha Epsilon in creative and intentional manners.

If TLC and Food Network ever had a sitcom-child, it would be “What Not to Eat.” Imagine pantry clean-out scenes with minute rice and ranch dressing flying into the trashcan. The food victim would then be educated by natural food chefs, taken on a tour of Whole Foods, and given boku bucks to blow on quinoa and goji berries. But since I have yet to be recruited to start this show, let me give you six simple steps to update your plate.\n\n1. Update Your Wardrobe - Clean Out Your Pantry Throw away the food that is not flattering for any human such as: processed grains, packaged snacks, sugary treats, etc., and replace with healthy alternatives! Food staples like whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, spices, and wholesome condiments will make curating a healthy plate a snap.\n\n2. Accessorize - Try Some New Tools\n\nJazz up your meal by using fun tools like a spiralizer for zucchini pasta, a peeler for carrot ribbons, a grater for lemon zest on salmon, or a mandolin slicer for baking sweet potato\n\nchips! A dish with fun textures is more visually appealing which makes eating it much more satisfying. Even functional pieces like a salad spinner, food processor, and an immersion blender can make smart cooking look and feel effortless.\n\n3. Experiment With Color & Patterns - Make Colorful\n\nFood Choices\n\nGet adventurous by trying vegetables and fruits as they come into season. More colors on your plate means you’re getting a wider spectrum of nutrients (i.e. orange foods have high beta carotene). This helps avoid the monochromatic white meal - definitely a healthy “don’t.” As a rule of thumb, include two to three veggies per meal and get creative with your combos!\n\n4. Switch Up Your Style - Vary Your Cooking Methods Try to use more than one cooking method per meal to keep it fresh and widen your options. Select from steaming, sautéing, baking, broiling, grilling, boiling, roasting, raw, frozen, or chilled depending on the season or the “it” method of the moment. Roasted veggies are killing it on menus this season.\n\n24 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\n5. Spice it Up - Use Seasonings Creatively\n\nThere’s nothing like the perfect herb or spice to turn a drab dish into a fierce crowd pleaser. Spices also come in handy post-cooking allowing you to style a classic dish many ways throughout the week. My favorite way to do this is by making a pot of plain brown rice and pairing it with combos like cinnamon and almond milk for breakfast, shoyu and an egg for fried rice, or cumin with black beans for a side dish.\n\n6. Pick Out Your Outfit The Night Before - Keep\n\nFood Prepped and Ready to Eat\n\nHaving healthy foods prepped for the week is a fool-proof\n\nway to stay nourished despite a hectic schedule. By having\n\nbig batches of soups, whole grains, and beans already made in addition to prepped salad greens, vegetables, and fruit, you have no excuse for resorting to take-out. Make this tip even easier by stocking up on high quality tools like a good knife, cutting boards, and glass containers that keep food fresher, longer.\n\nThat’s a wrap - all you need to know to revamp your meals into a healthier, flawless version of your daily dining experience. Because, yes darling, saying “I just threw this together” never could be so true.

AOII was represented at the meeting by Carole Jones, NPC Delegate; Mary Ann Stark, 1st Alternate Delegate; Kerry Soller, 2nd Alternate Delegate; Lisa Moore, 3rd Alternate Delegate; Allison Allgier, AOII International President; and Troy LeForge, AOII Executive Director. Participants reflected on the accomplishments of the previous year and made decisions to advance the sorority experience. They also enjoyed seeing longtime Panhellenic friends and making new ones — and were inspired and educated by guest speakers.\n\nRegistration opened Oct. 24. In keeping with NPC’s history of empowering women and to observe\n\nUSA Weekend Make A Difference Day, registrants contributed professional apparel and monetary support to Dress for Success Midwest, a program of St. Louis-based nonprofit organization Connections to Success. Additionally, the NPC Foundation hosted the traditional sale of sunflower nametag stickers to benefit the foundation. Attendees bought the stickers throughout the weekend to honor sorority and Panhellenic sisters.\n\nThe annual meeting started with an afternoon town hall session dedicated to trends in higher education and a preview of proposed NPC legislation. The trends segment was presented by Dawn Watkins, Ph.D., a partner and vice president of Plaid, an organizational management firm that focuses on\n\nhigher education and related organizations. A Delta Delta Delta delegation member, she spent 20 years in university administration before joining Plaid. Watkins offered the assembly an engaging and informative overview of developments in and outside the classroom. Legislative Committee Chairman Dana Katz, Alpha Epsilon Phi, led the legislation preview. Bylaws Review Task Force Chairman Corre Stegall, Kappa Delta, reviewed proposed changes to the bylaws.\n\nDinner allowed time for attendees to meet by delegation. Afterward, 2013-15 NPC Chairman\n\nJean M. Mrasek, Chi Omega, opened the meeting officially at the first business session. Vice Chairman Donna King, Sigma Kappa, presented retiring delegation members with the NPC Certificate of Service. Mrasek then gave the state of NPC address, which highlighted the initiatives and achievements of the past year and plans for the year ahead. The evening continued with voting on legislation and ended with\n\na newcomers’ reception and a reception for sponsors, executive directors and inter/national presidents.\n\nSaturday, Oct. 25, began with breakfast meetings for committees, presidents and executive directors. Throughout the day, while delegation members participated in Panhellenics training and discussion, the presidents and executive directors met in their respective tracks — including time allotted to\n\nvisit the 35 vendor exhibits. Lunch was devoted\n\nto recognizing the exhibitors and thanking the eight meeting sponsors. NPC Finance Committee Chairman Lynnda Hoefler, Delta Zeta, gave special acknowledgement to the three diamond-level\n\nsponsors: Billhighway, Herff Jones ~ Greek Division and MJ Insurance Inc. Guest Alesha Barber, Dress for Success Midwest coordinator, presented a snapshot of the significance of her organization’s work.\n\nThe second business session was the last event of the afternoon. Attendees observed a moment of silence\n\nfor NPC sisters who had passed away during the year. Chairman Mrasek introduced guests Buddy Coté,\n\nPhi Gamma Delta, chairman of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, and attorney Tim Burke of Manley Burke. Delegates voted on the remaining legislative proposals, and eight organizations made special presentations, several in honor or memory of women who have given notable service to the fraternal world. Zeta Tau Alpha recognized the late Deb Ensor, alternate delegate and longtime executive director, who was known for her singing voice, among other talents. Each NPC delegation member received a CD featuring Deb singing. Gamma Phi Beta honored alternate delegate and former NPC Chairman Betty Quick, the 2014 recipient of the prestigious Jack L. Anson Award given by the Association of Fraternity/ Sorority Advisors.\n\nNPC hosted its first chapter management summit in conjunction with the annual meeting. More than 60 professionals and volunteers who serve the collegiate sector for the 26 inter/national organizations attended. Although most of the summit’s program took place on Sunday, participants were invited to attend Saturday’s closing business session, and by dinner they had arrived in force to connect with their sisters and Panhellenic counterparts.\n\nAll present had the treat of hearing dinner speaker Patti Johnson, whose message “What’s your wave?” captured the common characteristics of those\n\nwho effect change and challenged the audience to conquer personal fears in the interest of positive action. Johnson, a member of Pi Beta Phi, credited\n\nher life trajectory in part to a sorority sister who encouraged her as a college freshman to run for chapter recruitment chairman. A career and workplace expert, she is CEO and founder of PeopleResults, a change and organizational development consulting firm whose clients have included PepsiCo, Microsoft, 7-Eleven and Frito-Lay. Each attendee received her book “Make Waves: Be the One to Start Change at Work and in Life,” which she autographed later during a reception.\n\nAn evening town hall meeting started with a brief report from NPC Foundation Chairman Janet Dodson, Alpha Sigma Tau. The rest of the session focused on two recent research projects that point empirically to the value of sorority membership. Although the speakers commented humorously about scheduling two statisticians after dinner, their presentations were lively.\n\nFirst, Brandon Busteed, executive director of Gallup Education, discussed the 2014 Gallup-Purdue Index study of almost 30,000 college graduates, which showed a correlation between sorority and fraternity affiliation and subsequent workplace engagement, sense of purpose, loyalty to one’s alma mater, attachment to one’s community, and physical and financial well-being. Busteed, a nationally known speaker and author on education policy and public health, writes frequently for The Chronicle of\n\nHigher Education, Trusteeship Magazine and other publications. He is founder and former CEO of Outside the Classroom, a company that pioneered adaptive online education in alcohol-abuse prevention. He also serves on the national board of directors for Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity.\n\nNext, Patrick Biddix, Ph.D., spoke about “Sorority Membership and Educational Outcomes: Results of a National Study,” which positively correlates sorority membership to several measures of college/university student retention. Dr. Biddix, who conducted the study, is associate professor of higher education and coordinator of the College Student Personnel Program at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. He previously worked as a fraternity/sorority professional at Washington University in St. Louis as well as for his fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, as an educational consultant.\n\nInter/national presidents and the NPC board of directors met on Sunday morning, but for most participants the meeting ended with Saturday’s dessert reception. The gathering was literally and figuratively bittersweet, as Panhellenic friends from across North America enjoyed a final time together, prepared to part and looked forward to working in concert to advance the sorority experience in the year to come.\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma • 29\n\nNational Panhellenic Conference Recap\n\n30 • To Dragma Issue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nLeadership Academy\n\nAlpha Omicron Pi • February 6-8, 2015\n\nDuring Leadership Academy 2015 in Brentwood, Tenn., Chapter Presidents, Vice Presidents of Standards and Standards Advisers learned about the many ways the values of Alpha Omicron Pi impact chapter operations and AOII members. The theme of the event, To Protect and To Serve, illustrated the characteristics of the officer and advisory roles of attendees and set the tone of the weekend’s focus.\n\nThe training weekend was opened with Ritual just before welcoming officers and advisers to the educational event. After dinner, keynote speaker Dr. Will Keim shared his keys to success in life based on values our members share. He spoke on pushing ourselves and our sisters to be better citizens while challenging us all to live our lives to the fullest. Next, the facilitation team presented the values and promises that the Fraternity shares with the universities that host AOII’s installed chapters and new colonies. Before the evening was over, attendees participated in a few activities that helped to discover ways to articulate these values to new audiences such as potential new members, administration and parents.\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma • 31\n\nOn Saturday morning, Chapter Presidents and Vice Presidents of Standards split up for specific training for their respective roles\n\nin the Fraternity, while the advisers headed to AOII International Headquarters for educational sessions. In one presentation, The Big Three: Booze, Books, and Bills, advisers explored how violations of the alcohol, academic and finance policies may be resolved. These three violations are\n\nthe most common reasons that members\n\nare brought to standards meetings. In their second rotation, Coaching versus Managing, advisers spent time discussing the different characteristics of coaching and managing and what situations might call for each approach. A third rotation included time for a guided tour of AOII Headquarters as well as Emporium shopping.\n\nAfter lunch, advisers returned to the\n\nhotel for an afternoon learning block that included topics such as characteristics of\n\na good Alumnae Advisory Council, the role of the standards adviser, resources, risk management, the Standards of Excellence, and evaluating the importance and urgency of a situation.\n\nDuring that time, collegiate officers broke up into groups for five rotations at AOII International Headquarters. In addition to the rotations of The Big Three, HQ Tours and shopping shared by the advisers, officers enjoyed three additional rotations. In the presentation Social Media and Standards, officers discussed how standards protect our members, how viral media can affect the chapter and members,\n\nand tips for preventing social media crises. They learned conversation skills and how to better manage emotions during Difficult Conversations and Discretion. Finally, officers talked through different elements of AOII Ritual to evaluate the values of the Fraternity and how they relate to standards policies in a session called Ritual and Standards.\n\n32 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nAfter officers completed all five rotations and ate dinner, they returned to the hotel for evening training that began with a session on bystander behavior. This was followed by a time for each VP of Standards to meet with her Chapter President and Standards Adviser to talk through what each learned throughout their day of training and what steps they would take when they returned home to their chapter.\n\nSaturday evening concluded with a series of skits representing several possible scenarios in standards meetings. These scenarios illustrated the steps of standards from the invitation to a standards meeting, handling the situation fairly and thoroughly, and with the minutes that would be distributed following the meeting. Following these dramatic interpretations, attendees were given a chance to ask questions about the process and about situations that might arise within their chapter. There was such great discussion that many stayed after the evening concluded to continue to meet with their chapter or with facilitators.\n\nTo Dragma • 33\n\nSunday morning was a bittersweet ending as everyone prepared to depart for home. Despite the many bags that were packed for the journey home, the energy was high as members prepared to share all that they learned with their chapter. The morning began with breakfast and an update on the Retained and Engaged program that all chapters are participating in. Then, Executive Director Troy LeForge spoke on making the experience of membership in AOII exceptional by celebrating new members and their initiation, living up to the standards set forth by our founders, and following through with the mutual promises made by the Fraternity and its members.\n\nLeadership Academy 2015 concluded with closing the meeting in Ritual. Then, as customary for the ending of international AOII events, everyone gathered in the friendship circle and sang the Epsilon Chapter Song.\n\nThough Leadership Academy 2015 was focused on protecting and serving the Fraternity and the members of AOII through our shared values, attendees seemed to share much more. Attendees created new bonds of friendship with sisters from other chapters, gained support from those who have shared experiences, and learned that sisterhood reaches much farther than just within their own chapter.\n\n34 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\n31 collegiate chapters were able to receive scholarships from the AOII Foundation’s Grant Program in order to attend Leadership Academy 2015!\n\nA recorded webinar was sent out to all attendees as a follow up to the education shared during the event. It outlines next steps for success in standards and leadership strategies as well as recapping presentations and learning objectives from the weekend.\n\nLeadership Academy 2015: To Protect and To Serve was partially funded through education grants from the AOII Foundation. In addition to the appreciation to\n\nthe AOII Foundation, AOII also wants to thank all who contributed to Leadership Academy in making it a successful learning experience for AOII’s members, especially\n\n“to stand at all times for character, dignity, scholarship, and college loyalty” The Object of The Fraternity\n\nthose who facilitated the event:\n\nAllison Allgier, Rachel Boison, Paula Daigle, Meredith Dunn, Amy Jo Gabel,\n\nLori Goede, Jodie Hassall, Heather Hays, Melissa Healy, Ally Howard, Alex LeForge, Troy LeForge, Kara Mantooth, Abby Mason, Kaya Miller, Nevena Pehar, Kimberly Sons, Lauren Stern, Hillary Stewart, Sandy Stewart, Lindsay Stoltz, Mary Kate Sweeney, Andrea Theobald and Courtney West.\n\nTo Dragma • 41\n\nSubmit a MIF Online\n\nAs members of AOII, we all play a crucial role in year-round recruitment, and there are many ways that alumna and collegiate members can help chapters reach their full potential. With fall formal recruitment right around the corner, one important way to help is to begin submitting Membership Information Forms (MIFs) for upcoming Potential New Members (PNMs). By taking part in this process, we can help a chapter see the AOII values in certain PNMs who could be outstanding members in the future.\n\nMIFs are recommendations for PNMs that you may know or know of from a trusted friend. They are also for any PNMs who are legacies in order for the chapter to confirm that the PNM is a legacy before recruitment starts. These provide background into\n\nthe PNMs activities and accomplishments. It is crucial for the PNMs and the chapters because of the important role they play in helping support the collegiate chapters. Any alumnae of Alpha Omicron Pi currently in good standing, can submit a MIF for a PNM. Collegiate members may also submit MIFs for any university other than their own. All MIFs should be submitted before formal recruitments, and the earlier the better. This is an easy and important way that everyone can play a role in the recruitment process.\n\nMIFs are fundamental to the formal recruitment process because they help to select exceptional women who will thrive in AOII. With the size of formal recruitment continuing to grow and quotas continuing to rise each year, these forms help PNMs stand\n\nout among the rest and help them have a positive recruitment process. Each year, university Greek systems are growing, and it is getting harder and harder for PNMs to stand out. This is an excellent way to help chapters see the PNMs who have the potential to be the next leaders of the chapters.\n\nThis is an important role for alumnae to provide support in recruitment. While only collegiate members can choose the next members of Alpha Omicron Pi and MIFs do not ensure membership, they help our chapter quickly see the qualities we look for in AOII and these PNMs. The more information a chapter can know about a PNM, the better the process will be when making hard decisions after a recruitment round.\n\nAs we know, recruitment can be stressful for collegiate members and PNMs alike because of the uncertainties of the process. By providing a MIF for a PNM, we can give her a better understanding of the NPC membership process and the benefits before recruitment even begins. The more a PNM understands about recruitment and the more a chapter knows about a PNM, the smoother their recruitment process will be in general.\n\nAOII is made up of exceptional women who are alike in our values but different in many aspects. We pride ourselves on coming together as one and taking pride in all of our different strengths and weaknesses. PNMs are the same - there will be quiet personalities, outgoing personalities, and everything in between. If you know someone who is shy but is an exceptional woman, a MIF can help to express her potential and make her feel more comfortable during recruitment. If you know of a strong leader who is outstanding, help the chapter to know those qualities beforehand so they can be prepared to have meaningful conversations that lead to strong relationships. These forms can help a chapter be prepared for their conversations that make lasting impressions and help PNMs have an all-around better quality recruitment.\n\n36 • To Dragma Issue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nUpdated MIF PRocess\n\nWe have updated the online MIF process this year to streamline the MIF directly to the chapter. Here is how to get started - visit www.alphaomicronpi.org and locate the Membership Information Form under the “Alumnae” tab in\n\nthe toolbar. Access the MIF by clicking the link called “Submit A MIF Here.” The next step will include a chapter locator that allows you to choose the state or provence in which the chapter is located and then choose the chapter you are looking for. When you click on the specific chapter, you will fill out the MIF for the specific PNM, and it will be routed directly to the chapter. You can also find the forms under the “Collegiate Chapter Locator” under the “Collegians” tab in the toolbar. Then, click on the chapter you are looking for, and it will direct you to each chapter’s individual page. The link will be located at the bottom of the page under “Click here to submit your Membership Information Form.”\n\nAnother update to this process is for PNMs. Because many of our PNMs do not know an AOII but they are interested in being considered for AOII, they will ask for recommendations from our alumnae. They can visit our website and find an alumnae chapter in their area by using the “Alumnae Chapter Locator” under the “Alumnae” tab in the toolbar. This will allow them to choose by state or provence and then choose the alumnae chapter that is closest to their home town. They will be able to email the alumnae chapter president and ask for a MIF from someone in the alumnae chapter. This was created to help the process run smoothly and easily for PNMs, collegiate chapters, and alumnae alike.\n\nFor questions, email [email protected] or call AOII International Headquarters at (615) 370-0920.\n\nFrequently ASked questions\n\nWhat materials do I need to write an\n\nAOII MIF?\n\nYou will need to ask the PNM to provide you with her contact information, high school/previous college name and GPA, as well as her high school/college activities and honors. A current photograph is also strongly recommended. If the PNM provides you with a resume, there is a place to attach it electronically, but you should still complete the form by filling in the blanks.\n\nThe PNM gave me a resume and photo. How\n\ndo I submit them electronically?\n\nThe PNM lives in a digital world and she, most certainly, has an electronic copy of the resume and photo she provided. Call or email her to get a digital copy of each so you can easily attach them to the form. Please complete the boxes on the form whether the resume is attached or not.\n\nCan I write a MIF on someone\n\nI do not know?\n\nYes! Our collegiate chapters always welcome the information through a MIF whether\n\nyou know the PNM or not. Gather all the information and submit it to the chapter, just as you would for someone you know. There is an appropriate place on the MIF to indicate whether you know the PNM personally, know her based on a reliable source, or are just providing information as a courtesy.\n\nLocate the MIF in the alumnae area of the AOII website: alphaomicronpi.org\n\nAlumnaeNews\n\nIndianapolis Alumnae 100th Anniversary\n\nAcadiana Alumnae\n\nOur chapter kicked off the fall semester by providing meals for Delta Beta’s recruitment. We continued our “15th of the month” events where we meet at a restaurant, local festival, a sister’s house, etc.. on the 15th of each month to mingle and welcome\n\nall alumnae in the area. Our chapter also organized the Finals Kits Fundraiser for Delta Beta where letters were sent to parents asking them to purchase a finals survival kit for their daughters. Around the holidays, alumnae volunteered their time at Barnes & Noble to gift-wrap for donations to the AOII Foundation. We also held our annual Cookie and Ornament Exchange when we collected toiletries for Faith House and children’s toys for Toys for Tots.\n\nAnn Arbor Alumnae\n\nThe sisters of the Ann Arbor Alumnae Chapter had a fun and active 2014. The various activities and events included getting pedicures, sharing meals at local restaurants, and supporting a local family during the holidays through the adopt-a-family program. We\n\nonce again gathered to make and sign cards to send to soldiers stationed overseas, and we had participants in both the Jingle Bell Run and the Walk to Cure Arthritis at the Detroit Zoo. It was a great year that saw an increase in participation and beautiful new faces.\n\nAtlanta Alumnae\n\nOur chapter offers a variety of monthly sisterhood events and meetings to encourage alumnae to develop friendships and\n\nnetwork with sisters. Our chapter consists of a variety of sisters from all over the country, in all life stages, and in all walks of life. Overall, 2014 was a great year for the Atlanta Alumnae Chapter! In March, we celebrated 80 years with a beautiful luncheon and had a team at the local Walk to Cure Arthritis in May. In August, we brought along our significant others for our annual IIOA event. We had\n\nan awesome time in September at the Atlanta Braves game for Strike Out Arthritis! where we connected with at least eight other collegiate and alumnae chapters for one enormous group picture! We wrapped up the year in December with our Jingle Bell Run team and a fun holiday/Founders’ Day luncheon.\n\nAustin Alumnae\n\nThe Austin Alumnae Chapter had a busy fall 2014! We kicked off the season with a ladies pampering night by getting our nails done at a salon owned by an AOII and holding elections for new officers. We also held a couple of happy hours in different parts of the city to try to include as many sisters as possible. December was a busy month for the Austin Alumnae, as we participated in the Jingle Bell Run in San Antonio, hosted a holiday party while putting together care packages for Sisters for Soldiers, explored the local holiday tradition “Trail of Lights”, and participated in a gingerbread house building competition for charity! We enjoyed hosting Founders’ Day in January and participating in Texas AOII Day with the San Antonio Alumnae Chapter in February!\n\n38 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nBozeman Alumnae\n\nBaltimore Alumnae\n\nThe Baltimore Alumnae Chapter started our new\n\nyear with a dinner meeting and a question: What does itmeantoyoutobean alumna, and what keeps you coming back? For most of us,\n\nit was the excitement of that original bond of sisterhood and a strong belief in the\n\nideals presented to us as AOII collegians. Our philanthropic projects in 2014 were the Jingle Bell Run and painting “believe” mugs for cancer patients. Our business meetings are kept short with plenty of time\n\nto socialize. The Baltimore\n\nAlumnae also enjoy working\n\nwith AOII at Towson U. We are advisors to the chapter, run\n\nalongside them in the Jingle\n\nBell Run, hand out goody bags during finals, and in the spring, participate in the ceremony welcoming seniors to alumnae status.\n\nBaton Rouge Alumnae\n\nThis year, the Baton Rouge Alumnae Chapter decided to “geaux RED” for each monthly event. Our meetings are themed around\n\na word that ends in RED. Events this fall included: centeRED (relaxed ritual), pampeRED (happy hour), savoRED (cooking demo), volunteeRED (arthritis event), and treasuRED (gift exchange). Spring 2015 will bring more RED-themed events: glitteRED (beauty bar), remembeRED (Founders’ Day), gatheRED (girls night), inspiRED (book and wine swap), and empoweRED (Strike Out Arthritis! event). Additionally, we are really happy to be up in membership by 20 percent over last year’s numbers. A couple of new things that we are trying are cross-chapter events and partnering with the Hammond Area Alumnae for our April event. We also now include a small local philanthropic event for each meeting that provides an immediate impact in our community.\n\nBozeman Alumnae\n\nIn 2014, the Bozeman Alumnae Chapter encompassed a diverse membership, with members from the local area, as well as other areas of Montana & the U.S. Alpha Phi’s Founders’ Day Celebration provided an opportunity for alumnae to join with collegiate members in celebration. Social activities included a gathering with Mandy Hedstrom, Alpha Phi alumna, alumnae chapter member and 2013-14 AOII Educational Leadership Consultant. In May, ten Alpha Phi alumnae returned to Bozeman to celebrate 50, 60, and 70-year reunions, and the chapter welcomed them back with rose and wheat corsages. Graduating collegiate members were hosted at a dinner welcoming them to alumna status with an invitation to join the alumnae chapter. At the end of 2014, the chapter hosted a\n\nsocial, Creativity & Canvas, where we shared laughs and made our own pieces of art. Through donations, we presented the collegiate chapter with a new projector and funding for a self-defense class!\n\nBucks County Alumnae\n\nBucks County AOIIs had a busy year. We met often for luncheons at members’ homes and also in local restaurants. One of our\n\nbest activities was going into Philadelphia for the annual Weihnachtsmarkt Christmas market. It is like the European Christmas markets in that the vendors are in small outdoor covered booths, selling Christmas goodies and other items. Naturally this was followed by lunch, and a tour of a Christmas Dicken’s Village in one of the department stores. Interesting and fun!\n\nBuffalo Alumnae\n\nThis fall the co-presidents of the Buffalo Alumnae Chapter, Gretchen Zollendeck and Wendy Evenden, along with Kay Welch, a Network 1 Network Specialist - Alumnae, road-tripped from New York to Milwaukee to attend the Bid Day and Colonization\n\nof Phi Delta Chapter at U of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. It was truly a weekend filled with sisterhood adventures. The BAC adopted Phi Delta, and in December sent handwritten congratulatory notes for each sister being initiated along with a large bag of Hershey kisses for their first official chapter meeting. Fall BAC events included a Strike Out Arthritis! family event and a lively Pokeno Card Party night. Founders’ Day was celebrated with sisters and legacies with a gourmet brunch at the historic Roycroft Inn in East Aurora, NY.\n\nCalgary Alumnae\n\nThe Calgary Alumnae Chapter has made a focus in 2014 of reaching out to all AOIIs, regardless of chapter membership and affiliation. We have held events targeted to different interest\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma • 39\n\nAlumnaeNews\n\ngroups, and have seen a great increase of interest. From doing joint events with Kappa Lambda Chapter (hosting a Bid Day Cookout, Strike Out Arthritis! minigolf, Founders’ Day, the Walk to Fight Arthritis, a Senior Class Welcome Social, and a summer appreciation barbecue) to alumnae events (including our annual Wine Tour and elections, and Christmas Card making), we try to engage as many sisters as possible. AOII is a lifetime commitment, and we try to showcase our dedication to our Fraternity.\n\nCentral Connecticut Alumnae\n\nWe had lots of fun in 2014! Social events included pizza/movie night, a wine tasting, indulging in ice cream, pumpkin/apple picking, and a holiday dinner/gift exchange with Ritual. In the spring, we put Easter baskets together for Life Haven, a temporary shelter for homeless mothers and their young children. In the fall, we participated in the Walk to Cure Arthritis.\n\nCentral Kentucky Bluegrass Alumnae\n\nWhether it is supplying a Final Exam Treat Box for Epsilon Omega, or baking cookies for recruitment, the Central Kentucky Bluegrass Alumnae are always willing to serve. We enjoy our time together\n\nat dinners out, taking a painting class at “Artfully Yours”, and donating our time and funds for the Salvation Army’s Thanksgiving Family Food Drive. In the spring, we will participate in a Strike Out Arthritis! Bowl-A-Thon and begin fundraising efforts toward a local scholarship for a deserving member of Epsilon Omega.\n\nCentral New Jersey Alumnae\n\nEverything is coming up roses in the Garden State, and the Central New Jersey Alumnae Chapter is proud to be part of it! Several members joined the Alumnae Advisory Committee for the newly- installed Gamma Phi Chapter at Seton Hall, and we continue to support Iota Theta at Monmouth and Alpha Nu at Ramapo. We recently enjoyed the Jingle Bell Run, NJ/NYC area Founders’ Day, and Winter Wine Wonderland with the NY/NJ Chapter. The chapter sends bi-monthly electronic newsletters to keep more than 300 area alumnae engaged. We hope to meet more Jersey sisters soon!\n\nCentral New Mexico Alumnae\n\nDuring the 2014 calendar year, the sisters of the Central New Mexico Alumnae Chapter saw many changes. This year, we had two new sisters join the group after moving from Arizona. The group also helped celebrate a sister’s upcoming wedding!\n\nCharlotte Alumnae\n\nIn 2014, we gathered regularly for fun sisterhood activities, including dinners, lunches and pottery painting. We raised money for the Jingle Bell Run for the Arthritis Foundation, and members supported the colonization at nearby Wingate U.\n\nChattanooga Area Alumnae\n\nThis year, has certainly been a whirlwind because, even during our own activities of panda-painting parties and Lookouts’ baseball\n\n40 • To Dragma\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nDenver Alumnae Founders’ Day\n\ngames, we have had the joy in helping establish the Lambda Delta Chapter at Dalton State College. Many of our members are on the AAC and love sharing lifelong fellowship in AOII with new members. We participated in a local Ronald McDonald Bowl-A- Rama fundraiser and learned that while bowling my not be our forte, we still had plenty of laughs! Our annual BYOP (Bring-Your- Own-Panda) Christmas Dinner was a success again this year.\n\nChicago City Alumnae\n\nThe Chicago City AC had an exciting and eventful 2014. We raised $2,000 for the Walk to Cure Arthritis, and one of our members achieved the title of Top Fundraiser! Team AOII of Greater Chicago raised over $1,700 for the Chicago Jingle Bell Run. The CCAC not only supports AOII and the Arthritis Foundation, but also partners with local organizations like Connections for Abused Women\n\nand Children (CAWC). As done in prior years, we collected back- to-school items for CAWC at our Fall Kick-Off BBQ. Many of our sisters attended a cupcake decorating class, which turned into a gender reveal party for one of our expecting sisters! Just before the holidays, we sampled cookies and appetizers at our annual cookie and appetizer exchange. Our calendar is full of events for 2015 that include the Walk to Cure Arthritis, Books and Bottles Speed Dating (idea credit to the New Orleans Alumnae Chapter), and more!\n\nChicago NW Suburban Alumnae\n\nChicago Northwest began the year purchasing and distributing school supplies to needy children at the Apple Tree Campaign sponsored by Palatine Township. Goodie bags were sent to the members of Epsilon Sigma, our adopted chapter, and we helped raise money for scholarships at the Panhellenic Stylin’ For Scholars Fashion Show and Luncheon. Feed My Starving Children is the next event with our Panhellenic sisters to pack food for families overseas. Our meetings this year will include a trip to Sur la Table for cooking demonstrations and a wine tasting party. We always look forward to our Murder Mystery and our annual pot luck in May, when we will also celebrate five members who have reached membership milestones.\n\nChicago South Suburban Alumnae\n\nThis year we focused on juvenile arthritis and spent a productive evening making rice pandas with Cat Smith. Our group was also well represented at the Walk to Cure Arthritis in Midlothian in May. Every year, we have a Christmas auction where we bid on gently used items to support our philanthropies. We truly enjoy meeting, laughing and spending time together as we serve the ideals of Alpha Omicron Pi.\n\nChicago West Suburban Alumnae\n\nWe offer our members a variety of events which include monthly meetings, social events, book club, philanthropic projects, and\n\nIssue no. 2 • Spring 2015\n\nTo Dragma • 41\n\nAlumnaeNews\n\nfundraisers. Sisterhood events are on a day other than the meeting and have included a movie night, build a panda at Build-A-Bear, and volunteering at a homeless shelter. Our garage sale and nut sale were very successful. At each meeting, we try to include an activity that focuses on doing something kind for others. This\n\nhas included making key chains for collegiate new members and collecting non-perishable items for a community food pantry. We are thrilled to celebrate our 75th anniversary this April.\n\nDayton Alumnae\n\nThe Dayton Alumnae Chapter has enjoyed getting to know our local collegiate sisters by holding two combined events per year. Over winter break, we invite the women and their mothers to a tea hosted in the beautiful home of one of our sisters. In the summer, we have fun cooking out with our families at a local park.\n\nDearborn Alumnae\n\nThis is a great time to reconnect with AOII and be part of the freshening of this inspiring 62-year-old alumnae chapter! You won’t want to miss meeting the cheerful and feisty “Mrs. Clara Ford” and learning fun things supporting AOII’s “The Green Expectation” on how to reduce, reuse, re-purpose, and recycle everyday things!\n\nThese fun things ahead support our recent activities including sisters coming together last December sharing our annual salad potluck lunch as we stuffed over 50 holiday stockings for Turning Point Women’s Shelter.\n\nDelaware Alumnae\n\nIn 2014, the sisters in the Delaware Alumnae Chapter supported the Walk to Cure Arthritis in May and with our chapter event, Strike Out Arthritis! with a Tea, raised close to $1,000. We also collected canned goods for the Newark Food Bank and donated over 50 dozen cookies for our soldiers serving overseas. We shared our sisterly love on Founders’ Day with Sigma Tau Chapter and again later as their seniors became new alumnae. A few of our members also won first place running honors while supporting Sigma Tau’s 5K fundraiser for the Jasmine Queen Scholarship. As always, there was time for sisterhood sharing at our Shop ‘Til You Drop luncheon and Post-Holiday Holiday Party.\n\nDenver Alumnae\n\nAs many locals would agree, Denver is the unofficial transplant capital. This year we have welcomed sisters from Philadelphia, Alabama, and California, to name a few. Colorado’s landscape\n\nHammond Area Alumnae\n\noffers many outdoor activities which we have taken advantage of to celebrate sisterhood. From fitness on the legendary Red Rocks, to hiking local trails, or walking through Denver’s beautiful Wash Park during the Walk to Cure Arthritis and\n\nJingle Bell Run‚ there is always a sister to explore the outdoors with. Most important, we have been pleased to support our\n\nlocal collegiate chapter‚ Epsilon Gamma. Working with their outstanding collegiate women to organize the program each year continues to grow our relations while promoting the ideal of life-long sisterhood.\n\nDetroit North Suburban Alumnae\n\nThe sisters of Detroit North Suburban\n\nhave continued to meet for lunch once a\n\nmonth among other activities. We joined\n\nother metro groups for the traditional\n\nfall pot luck, participated in the Jingle Bell Run, and were happy\n\nto welcome two sisters new to our area as members. A highlight of our fall was the meeting at the Cranbrook Institute of Science\n\nto see the first midwest stop of “Women of Vision: National Geographic Photographers on Assignment” exhibit. In the\n\nlast decade, some of the most powerful and important stories published by National Geographic featured the photographic work of a trailblazing new generation of women. As AOII alumnae, we are so proud of the opportunities afforded our sisters of\n\nthe 21st Century as reflected in this exhibit. After viewing, we discussed over lunch the work, vision and encounters behind\n\nthe photographs that revealed the excitement and challenges of photo documentation. As we begin 2015, we look forward to more opportunities to share with our sisters and wish everyone the best in the New Year.\n\nEast Bay Alumnae\n\nEast Bay combined philanthropy with chapter support by creating finals goodie bags for Sigma chapter. We had a great time and\n\nthe fun treats are always welcomed by the busy collegians during finals. Additionally, each spring we take the seniors from Sigma on a fun outing to encourage their participation in Alpha Omicron Pi as alumnae after college. We also award an outstanding senior with\n\na Life Loyal membership. Over the holidays we were able to get together for a cocktail party and ornament exchange. This spring, we are planning a day of wine tasting and sisterly bonding in one of our local wine regions.\n\nEl Paso Alumnae\n\nJanuary 2014 began with our El Paso Alumnae Chapter Installation. Finally after 30 years, the El Paso AOIIs have an alumnae chapter. In August, we invited a local collegian from TCU to our meeting to update us on their recruitment activities. Our fall gathering was a picnic at a local farm with our families, then we enjoyed a magical Christmas social. Member Ellen Eastman invited us to her beautiful home for a traditional candle lighting of their Christmas tree. We helped light the candles and enjoyed the candlelit ambience.

This year, we have been able to spend time together socially for coffee dates, dinner, and our long-standing Third Thursday Lunches. We volunteer not only in the preparatory stages for the Jingle Bell Run in Evansville, but also on the day of the race as many sisters participated. Additionally, we hosted our very first style night, which we hope to expand this coming spring! We have been able to support both Chi Lambda and Beta Chi. One of our most exciting experiences in 2014 was celebrating Bid Day with Chi Lambda!\n\nFort Lauderdale Alumnae\n\nIn 2014, we attended the Palm Beach Walk to Cure Arthritis and Diabetes Walk, as we do every year.

The year ended with our annual Founders’ Day luncheon and auction.\n\nGrand Rapids Alumnae\n\nWe had an excellent year getting reestablished and more than quadrupling our previous membership numbers! Our chapter helped the community by collecting food items at our annual Thanksgiving potluck to donate to our local food bank, and by making Valentine’s Day cards that were distributed to the elderly\n\nat a local hospital. We also had fun celebrating our sisterhood by hosting an event to honor Lambda Eta’s 25th anniversary, as well as paintin"
