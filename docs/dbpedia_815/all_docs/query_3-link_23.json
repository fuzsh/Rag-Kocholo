Dull, very dull they certainly are; two-storied, many-windowed, of dingy red brick or gloomy gray stone; depressing beyond all telling to the eye and mind of the solitary stranger doomed for his sins to drag out a few dreary months in the stagnant—well, let us say—town of Petit St. Jacques. Stagnant—that is the word. Life long ago lay down for a siesta there, and never woke up. Religion is the only thing that seems at all brisk. Many gilt spires point upward to the blue Canadian heaven; a full score of bells clash forth each Sunday, and thrice on that day, and thrice each week-day, the great booming bell of the dim old Cathedral de Nôtre Dame chimes forth the \"Angelus Domini,\" as you may hear in some dreamy, world forgotten town of old France. Beneath its gray stone arches tall pines and feathery tamaracs toss their green plumes in the salt breezes from the stormy gulf, and brilliant-plumaged, shrill-voiced Canadian birds flit among the branches. In the fiercely hot, short-lived Canadian summer grass grows green in the market-places and busiest streets of Petit St. Jacques.\n\n[Pg 10]\n\nIn the summer. But the summer, brief and sweet as a pleasant dream, is at an end; the ides of October are here. Shrill October winds whistle down the wide empty streets; drifts of scarlet maple and orange hemlock leaves swirl in your face; a black frost holds the earth iron bound; your footsteps ring like steel over the unpaved sidewalks; the keen breath of coming winter sets your blood leaping, your eyes sparkling, and lights in dusk Canadian cheeks a hue rosier than all the rouge végétal on earth can give.\n\n\"And the last of October will be Halloween! This is the twenty-ninth—only two days more. Girls, do stop whooping like a tribe of Mic-macs gone mad, and list, oh! list to me. Friday next is Halloween.\"\n\nBut the speaker's voice was lost in the shrieking uproar of five-and-thirty school-girls \"on the war-path.\" Afternoon school was over, the day scholars gone home, and the boarders, out in the playground for the last half-hour's recess before evening study, were rending the heavens with the deafening, distracting din that five-and-thirty of those rose-cheeked, gold-haired, corseted angels alone know how to raise.\n\nIf there was one thing besides its churches for which Petit St. Jacques was famous, it was the establishment of the Demoiselles Chateauroy for young ladies. It stood in the centre of the Rue St. Dominique; and if there was anything to choose in the matter of dulness and respectability among all the dull and respectable streets of the little town, the Rue St. Dominique should be awarded the palm. There were no shops, there were no people; the houses looked at you as you passed with a sad, settled, melancholy mildew upon them; the doors rarely opened, the blinds and curtains were never drawn; prim little gardens, with prim little gravel-paths, shut in these sad little houses from the street; now and then a pale, pensive face might gleam at you from some upper window, spectre-like, and vanish. The wheels of a passing wagon echo and re-echo down its long silence; the very dogs who sneak out to waggle their tails in the front grass-plot have a forlorn and secret-sorrow sort of air. Take it for all in all, you might travel from the St. Lawrence to the Rio Grande and not find another so absolutely low-spirited and drearily respectable a street as the Rue St. Dominique. Indeed, as Miss Sydney Owenson often and justly remarked, it was a very poor compliment to St. Dominique to christen it after him at all. Miss Sydney Owenson was one of the Demoiselles Chateauroy's five-and thirty boarders; and[Pg 11] it may as well be stated here as elsewhere, had made the Demoiselles Chateauroy more trouble, broken more laws, been condemned to solitary confinement oftener, been the head and front of more frolicsome offendings, and, withal, been better loved by both pupils and teachers during the past three years than the other four-and-thirty put together.\n\n\"Miss Owenson is in disgrace every week of her life,\" Mademoiselle Jeanne Chateauroy was wont to observe, taking a surreptitious pinch of snuff, \"and, if strict justice were administered, would be in punishment and disgrace every day of the week; but, ma foi! what would you? It is only high spirits and good health, after all. She keeps the school in a ferment, that is true; there is no mischief of which she is not ringleader, but it is innocent mischief, after all; she has the smile and voice of an angel; it is impossible to be as severe with her as she deserves, and then, Mon Dieu, it is the best heart that ever beat.\"\n\nThis pensionnat des demoiselles of the sisters Chateauroy was situated, as has been said, in the centre of the Rue St. Dominique, fronting directly upon the street—its extensive gardens and playground in the rear. A wooden wall eight feet high shut in this sacred inclosure and its angelic \"jeunes filles\" from the sacrilegious eye of man. In the face of the fierce summer sun, in the teeth of the fierce winter blasts, the twelve green shutters that protected the twelve front windows were kept jealously closed and barred. No prying, curious daughter of Eve might by any chance look out upon the gay and festive dissipations of the Rue St. Dominique—no daring masculine eye might ever in passing glance in. This prison discipline had only existed within the past two years, and a dark and dreadful legend was whispered about through the dormitories in the \"dead waist and middle of the night\" to all newcomers of the reason why. As usual, it was all Sydney Owenson's fault. Perched on top of the highest desk in the school-room, her eager head thrust out of the window, this daring, ill-behaved girl had deliberately winked at a passing soldier from the dingy old stone barracks outside the town. The soldier had winked back again; then this totally depraved Miss Owenson had thrown him a kiss; then this dreadful soldier threw her a kiss, and grinned, and went by. Next day he came again; next day Miss Owenson was perched up on the window-sill, like sister Anne on the watch tower, to see if there was anybody coming. Sent by her guardian-angel, no doubt, at this dreadful juncture, Mademoiselle Chat[Pg 12]eauroy the elder came into the school-room; Mademoiselle Chateauroy's horrified eyes beheld Miss Owenson with all the superior half of her person projecting into the Rue St. Dominique: Mademoiselle Chateauroy's stunned ears overheard these words:\n\n\"I say, Mr. Lobsterback, who is that lovely young officer I saw prancing all you fellows to the English Church last Sunday? All the girls are dying to know, and I told them I would find out. We're all in love with him. Do tell us his——\"\n\nMademoiselle Chateauroy heard no more. To seize Miss Sydney Owenson, to tear her from her perch, to slam down the window, to glare annihilation upon the grinning red-coat, to confront the offender, livid with horror, was but the work of a second.\n\nWhat awful fate befell the culprit no pupil knew—no, not to this day; her punishment was enshrouded in the same dark mystery that envelops the ultimate end of the Man in the Iron Mask. She had not been expelled, that was clear, for that was two years ago; and when questioned herself, Miss Owenson was wont to look for a moment supernaturally solemn, and then go off into a peal at the remembrance that made the \"welkin ring.\"\n\nIt is close upon five on this October evening, when the thirty-five boarders of the pensionnat are disporting themselves in the primrose light of the dying day, under the watchful and weary eyes of Miss Jones, the English teacher. It is a French play, and a very noisy one. \"Brother Hermit, can you dance?\" half a dozen tall girls are chanting, in high, shrill, sing-song French. Shrieks of laughter rend the atmosphere, and Miss Jones covers two distracted ears, and calls frantically, and calls in vain:\n\n\"Young ladies! Oh, dear me! Young ladies, less noise.\"\n\nThe noise grows fast and furious, the chanting rises shriller and shriller, the screams of laughter wilder and wilder. The \"Brother Hermits\" caper about like dancing dervishes gone mad. In the midst of it all, a tall, dark, handsome girl, with a double eye-glass across the bridge of her patrician aquiline nose, comes laughingly up to half-delirious Miss Jones.\n\n\"It's more like a maison de santé, with the lunatics set loose, than a decorous young ladies' school,\" she remarks. \"I say, Miss Jones, where is Sydney Owenson?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Oh, if the study bell would but ring! Go and look for Sydney Owenson in the thick of the mêlée; you'll[Pg 13] be sure to find her; they never could make half so much noise without her. Oh, good heaven! hear that.\"\n\nAnother ear-splitting shriek made Miss Jones cover her bruised and wounded tympanums. The dark damsel laughed.\n\n\"Miss Hendrick!\" screamed Miss Jones.\n\n\"The place unmentionable to ears polite. Don't cry out before you're hurt, Miss Jones. No, Syd isn't there, however they manage to raise all that racket without her. Where can she be? I want to tell her that Friday is Hallowe'en, and that Mrs. Delamere has invited all our class who will be allowed to go to a party at her house.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Miss Hendrick!\" Miss Jones, the English teacher, fixed two suspicious light-blue eyes upon Miss Hendrick's dark, handsome face, and expressed volumes of disbelief in that one incredulous word.\n\n\"Yes, 'indeed,' Miss Jones, and you are not invited, I'm happy to say. You don't believe me, do you? You never do believe anything Cyrilla Hendrick says, if you can help yourself, do you? You see, Mrs. Colonel Delamere happens—unfortunately for you—to be a lady, and has a weakness for inviting young ladies only to her house. That is why, probably, she is blind to the manifold merits of Miss Mary Jane Jones. You're name is Mary Jane, isn't it, Miss Jones? I saw it in your prayer-book. No, don't apologize, please—it's more one's misfortune than one's fault to be born Mary Jane Jones—'A rose by any other name,' etc.\"\n\nAll this, with her black eyes fixed full upon Miss Jones's face, in the slowest, softest voice, an insolent smile on her handsome lips, Miss Cyrilla Hendrick said.\n\nMiss Jones sprang to her feet, passion flashing from her eye, her pale, freckled complexion flushing crimson.\n\n\"Miss Hendrick, your insolence is not to be borne! I will not bear it. The moment recreation is over, I will go to Mam'selle Chateauroy and report your impertinent speech.\"\n\n\"Will you, really? Don't excite yourself, dear Miss Jones. If you palpitate in this way, something will go crack. Tell mam'selle anything it pleases your gracious highness; it won't be the first time you've carried stories of me. Mademoiselle[Pg 14] can get a better teacher than you any day, but first-rate pupils don't grow on every tamarac-tree in Lower Canada. Adieu, dear and gentle Miss Jones! I kiss your ladyship's hands. Sydney! Sydney! where are you?\"\n\nShe walked away, sending her fresh, clear young voice over all the uproar. Miss Jones, the teacher, looked after her with a glare of absolute hatred.\n\n\"I'll be even with you yet, Miss Cyrilla Hendrick, or I'll know the reason why! You have given me more insolence during the past year than all the school together. As you say, it's no use complaining to Miss Chateauroy. You're a credit to the school, she thinks, with your brilliant singing, and playing, and painting; but I'll pay you for your jibes and insults one day, mark my words—one day, and that before long.\"\n\n\"Sydney! Sydney!\" the clear voice still shouted. \"Now, where can that girl be? 'That rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels call Lenore.' Sydney! Sydney-y! Sydney-y-y-y!\"\n\nShe stops, expending all her strength in one mighty shout that rises over the wild, high singing of the French Canadians, \"Frère l'Hermite, savez vous danser?\" It comes pealing to an upper window overlooking the playground, and a girl huddled up cross-legged like a Turk takes two fingers out of two pretty pink ears, and lifts a yellow head from a book to listen.\n\n\"Sydney! Sydney Owenson! Oh, my own, my long-lost daughter!\" cried Miss Hendricks with ear-splitting piercingness, \"where in this wicked world are you?\"\n\n\"Bother!\" mutters the girl in the window, and then the yellow head, \"sunning over with curls,\" goes down again, two fingers return into two ears, a pair of gray eyes glue themselves once more to the pages of the book, and Miss Sydney Owenson is lost again to all sublunary things. They may shriek, they may yell, they may rend the heavens with their unearthly cries, they may drive Miss Jones deaf and frantic—Cyrilla Hendrick, the friend of her bosom, the David in petticoats to her Jonathan ditto, may split her voice in her distracted cries for \"Sydney,\" Sydney is a thousand miles away; nothing short of an earth-quake may arouse her, so absorbed is she.\n\nYes, something does.\n\n\"Miss Owenson!\" says the awful voice of Mademoiselle Chateauroy the elder, and Miss Owenson drops her book and jumps as though she were shot. \"Miss Owenson, what book is that?\"[Pg 15]\n\nA small, snuff-colored lady, with a frisette and a head-dress of yellow roses and black beadwork, confronts her—a very small, very snuff-colored lady, with glancing opal eyes—Mademoiselle Stephanie Chateauroy.\n\nMiss Owenson puts her two hands, the book in them, behind her back, and faces Mademoiselle Stephanie à la Napoleon the Great. She is a pretty girl—a very pretty girl of seventeen or so, with gray, large, innocent-looking eyes, a pearly skin, a soft-cut, childish mouth, and curls of copper gold down to her slim girl's waist.\n\n\"Yes, mam'selle,\" says Miss Owenson, in a tone of cheerful meekness; \"did you call me, mam'selle?\"\n\n\"Why are you not in the playground, Mees Owenson?\" demands, severely, mademoiselle.\n\n\"Oh, well!\" responds Miss Owenson, losing a trifle of her cheerful meekness, \"I'm sick of 'Brother Hermit' and the other stupid plays, only fit for the babies of the première class. Besides, the noise makes my head ache.\"\n\nMiss Owenson makes this remarkable statement calmly. The open window at which she has been sitting is just three feet over the heads of the rioters, and in the very thick of the tumult. Its utter absurdity is so palpable that mademoiselle declines to notice it.\n\n\"Mees Owenson is aware that absence from the playground, in play hour, is a punishable offence?\" goes on mademoiselle with increased ascerbity.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" says Miss Owenson, quite cheerfully once more; \"that's no odds. Nothing's any odds, when you're used to it, and I ought to be used to every species of punishable offences in this school by this time.\"\n\n\"Mees Owenson, what were you reading when I entered this room?\"\n\n\"A book, mam'selle.\"\n\n\"Mees Owenson, what book?\"\n\n\"Oh, well—a story-book then, if you will have it, by a person you don't know—a Mr. Dickens. I know it's against the rules, but it was all an accident—upon my word it was, mam'selle.\"\n\n\"An accident, you sitting here in play-hour reading a wicked novel! Mees Owenson!\"\n\n\"It's not a wicked novel. Dickens never wrote anything wicked in his life. Papa has every one of his books in the library at home, and used to read them aloud to mamma. And[Pg 16] I mean it's an accident my finding the book. It isn't mine; I don't know whose it is; I found it last evening, lying among the cabbages—honor bright, mam'selle! I'll pitch it back there now.\"\n\nAnd then, before Mlle. Stephanie can catch her breath, Miss Owenson gives the volume behind her a brisk pitch out of the open casement, and it falls plump upon the head of her sworn friend, Cyrilla Hendrick.\n\nThere is a moment's pause, and teacher and pupil confront each other. That an explosion will follow, Miss Sydney Owenson fully expects, but what was she to do? Helen Heme's name was on the fly-leaf. Helen Heme was a day-scholar, who surreptitiously smuggled story-books inside the sacred walls of the pensionnat for the private delectation of the boarders. Helen had been threatened with expulsion the next time she was caught in the act \"red-handed,\" so to say, and it was much more on Helen's account than on her own that Sydney Owenson was palpitating now.\n\n\"I coaxed so hard for that 'Pickwick,'\" Sydney thinks. \"I hope to goodness some of the girls will pick it up and hide it outside. I don't mind mam'selle's flare-up—I'm used to it—but I'd never forgive myself if Nell came to grief through me.\"\n\nShe looks up now into mademoiselle's indignant face, clasps two little white hands imploringly, and begins, with that voice and smile mademoiselle herself declares to be the most charming on earth, to wheedle her out of her just wrath.\n\n\"Oh, Mam'selle Stephanie, don't be angry, please. I know it's wrong to break rules, but then I am so tired of the stupid old plays out there, and the girls are so noisy and rude, and my head did ache, and the book was not a bad book—upon my word and honor it wasn't, mam'selle; not a bit like a novel at all, and I did find it among the cabbages last evening, and——\"\n\nMademoiselle Stephanie knows of old that Miss Owenson is perfectly capable of going on in this strain without a single full stop for the next hour. Therefore, without a word, she pulls a letter out of her pocket and hands it to her pet pupil.\n\n\"I will overlook your disobedience this once, petite,\" she said, \"because it is probably the very last time you will ever have a chance to disobey. Read your mamma's letter, my dear; I know what it contains, as it came inclosed in one to me. Chérie,\" mam'selle's voice absolutely falters, \"you—you are about to leave school.\"\n\nSydney Owenson rises to her feet, the great gray eyes dilate[Pg 17] and grow almost black with some vague terror. She looks at her letter—a look of absolute affright, the last trace of color leaving her pearl-fair skin—then at mademoiselle.\n\n\"Papa,\" she falters. \"Oh, mam'selle! don't say papa is——\"\n\n\"Worse?—No, my dear. You poor child, you are as white as the wall. No, papa is no worse—it isn't that—it is—but read your letter, tres chère; it will tell you all about it, and believe me, my dear,\" and mademoiselle lays two snuff-colored old hands kindly on the girl's shoulders, \"no one in this school will regret the loss of its most troublesome pupil more than I shall.\"\n\nShe toddles away and leaves Miss Owenson to read her letter. \"Ah,\" she sighs, \"it is the best, the tenderest little heart in the world, after all. I shall never love another pupil so well. Only a baby of seventeen, and to be married in a month! Hèlas, the poor little one!\"\n\nSydney tears open her letter; it is a lengthy, spidery, woman's scrawl.\n\n\"Owenson Place, October 25, 18—.\n\n\"My Dear Little Daughter:—I have written to the Mademoiselles Chateauroy, telling them to have all things ready for your departure on Monday, the third of November. You are to leave school, and for good. Papa is not worse really, but he thinks he is, and he pines for you. He has taken it into his head—you know how hypochondriacal he is—that he will die before the year ends, and he insists that you must be married at once, else he will not live to see it. Now don't worry about this, Sydney. I know how foolish you are concerning poor papa's whims, and it is only a whim. Bertie is here, came by the Cunard steamer from England three weeks ago, and is naturally all impatience to see you. It is a very absurd whim of papa's, I think myself, this marrying a child of seventeen and a boy of twenty-two; but what use is it my saying so? I was nine-and-twenty when I married Captain Owenson. Still, I am sure, I hope you will be happy; and Bertie is so nice and good-tempered and gentlemanly and all that, that any one might get along with him. Rebecca will reach Petit St. Jacques Saturday afternoon, and you and she will start for home on Monday morning. Papa has actually sent to Paris for your wedding-dress, and pearls, and veil, as though good enough could not have been got in New York City; but it is another of his whims to look down upon everything in this country, and[Pg 18] think nothing fit for you that doesn't come from Europe. I'm sure sometimes I wonder he ever married an American lady, or that he found a school on this continent fit for his only child. I know he would have sent you to the Sacre Cœur at Paris, only he couldn't bear to put the ocean between himself and you. But this has nothing to do with it. So bid the young ladies and teachers good-by, and be ready to start on Monday morning with Rebecca.\n\n\"Your affectionate Mother,\n\nCharlotte Owenson.\n\n\"P.S.—Bertie sends his love and a kiss, he says, to all the pretty girls in the school. He is as foolish as ever, but very handsome and elegant, I must say. Christ Church College has improved him greatly. He wanted to accompany Rebecca, but, of course, I wouldn't hear of anything so improper as that.\"\n\nC. O.\n\n\"P.S. No. 2.—By the by, papa says you may invite your particular friend, Miss Hendrick, if you like, to be one of your bridemaids. He knew her aunt, Miss Phillis Dormer, in England, and her mother comes of one of the best families in Dorsetshire. As if the best family in Dorsetshire mattered in America.\"\n\nC. O.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCYRILLA.\n\nThe first stunning shock of surprise over, a torrent of questions poured upon the blissful fiancée.\n\n\"Oh! good gracious! Oh, Mon Dieu! was she really? Oh, how nice! Oh! c'est charmant? What was his name? Where did he live? How did it come about? What did he say? Was he handsome? Was he rich? Did papa and mamma know? Oh, what a love of a ring, and oh, how splendid it was to be engaged at sixteen! And when, O Sydney! when were they going to be married?\"\n\n\"There! there! there!\" cried Miss Owenson shrilly, breaking away from fifty-six eager, excited faces. \"I am sorry I told you anything about it! One would think I was the only girl in the world ever engaged before. If you leave me alone I'll answer all your questions. Stand off, and let me see. 'His name?' Well, his name is Albert Vaughan—Bertie Vaughan—a pretty name to begin with. 'Where does he live?' He lives at Oxford at present; at least he was on his way back there when I left home. 'How did it come about?' Well, it didn't come about; it was always to be, destined from all time, and that sort of thing. Ever since I can remember anything, I remember being told I was to marry Bertie some day, if I behaved myself—family arrangements, you see, like a thing in a story. 'What did he say?' Oh, well, he just came to me on my birthday, and slipped this ring on my finger, and said, 'I say, Syd, I want you to marry me this day twelve months, or thereabouts, you know;' and I said, 'All right, Bert, I will.' 'Is he handsome?' Handsome as an angel, Helen—brown eyes, brown curling hair, fair complexion, rosy cheeks like a girl, small hands and feet, and the sweetest little love of a mustache! 'Is he rich?' Poor as a church mouse, Cyrilla—not got a sou in the[Pg 20] earthly world; but as I am to have enough for both, that doesn't signify. 'Do papa and mamma know?' Of course they know, goosies! Bertie and I would never have thought of such a thing if papa hadn't told us to think of it. 'And when are we to be married?' Oh, I don't know—not for ever so long. I don't want to be married—it's dreadfully dowdy and stupid. We won't be married for ages—not until I'm old—oh! ever so old—twenty-one, may be. It's nice enough to be engaged, but married—bah-h-h!\"\n\nMiss Owenson pronounced her \"bah!\" with the disgusted look of one who swallows a nauseous dose, and sprang to her feet.\n\n\"I say, girls! let's have a game of 'Prisoners' Base;' I'm dying for a romp. Come!\"\n\nMiss Owenson had her romp until the pearl pale cheeks glowed like twin pink roses, and the vivid gray eyes streamed with laughing light. But from that hour a halo of romantic interest encircled her.\n\nShe had a lover—she was engaged—she would be married in a year. Oh, happy, thrice happy Sydney Owenson! Every month or so came to her a letter bearing the English postmark, dated \"Ch. Ch., Oxford\"—real, genuine love-letters. Mlle. Stephanie shook her head, and passed them over in fear and trembling to her engaged pupil. She had never had such a thing before, and to a certain extent it was demoralizing the whole school.\n\nSix-and-forty youthful heads ran more on lovers than on lessons, on engagements than on \"Télémaque\" or \"Chopin's Waltzes.\" Miss Owenson, as a matter of Christian duty, read those epistles of her young Oxonian faithfully aloud to her six-and-forty fellow-students. On the whole, they were rather a disappointment. They contained a great deal of news about boating on the Isis, riding across country, college supper parties, and a jolly time generally, but very few glowing love-passages to his affianced. Indeed, beyond the \"Dear little Syd\" at the beginning, and \"Your affectionate Bertie\" at the end, they didn't contain a single protestation of the consuming passion which it is to be supposed possessed him.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Sydney was wont to cry out indignantly, when some of the more sentimental young ladies objected to these love-letters on that head. \"You wouldn't have Bertie spooning all the way across the Atlantic, would you? I suppose, Helen, you would like the sort of letters Lord Mortimer [Pg 21]used to write to namby-pamby, milk-and-waterish Amanda Fitzallan, 'Beloved of my soul!' Ha! ha! I fancy I see Bert writing that sort of rubbish to me. He wouldn't do it twice, let me tell you!\"\n\nAs may be seen, Miss Owenson was not in the slightest sentimental herself—not one whit in love, in the common acceptation of the word, with Bertie Vaughan. \"He was the dearest, jolliest old fellow in the world—Bertie,\" she was calmly accustomed to observe; \"and since she must marry somebody sometime, she would rather marry Bert than anybody else, but to go spooning as they did in books—no, not while either of them kept their senses.\"\n\nShe sits very quietly now, the letter on her lap, looking out at that pale yellow, frosty sky—a little pale, and very thoughtful.\n\nGoing to leave school—going to be married! All the old life to end, and the new to begin. And the old life had been such a good life, such a pleasant life; she was so fond of school and of all the girls—well, with about three-and-twenty exceptions. She could never play \"Brother Hermit,\" or \"Hunt the Slipper,\" or \"Tag\" any more—never any more! Married women never jumped skipping-ropes, never played \"Puss in the Corner,\" or got people to swing them until their heels touched the beam in the barn each time! Never! never! It was all dull and stupid, and dowdy, being married. And great tears rose up in Miss Owenson's gray eyes and splashed, one by one, down upon the fatal letter.\n\n\"All alone, Syd?\" cries a brisk voice, and, with a swish of dingy skirts, Miss Hendrick is in the room. \"And a letter—another love-letter! Happy girl! Well, 'blessed are they who expect nothing, for they shall not be disappointed!' of whom I am one. And how is our beauteous Bertie?\"\n\n\"It isn't from Bertie,\" answers Sydney, hastily wiping away the last tear. \"It's from mamma, and\"—a great gulp—\"O Cy, I'm going to leave school!\"\n\n\"Happy girl once more! When and why?\"\n\n\"On Monday, and—to be married.\"\n\n\"On Monday, and be married! Happy, happy, happy girl! I wish I were going to leave school on Monday, and be married. I wouldn't sit by myself in the dark and mope, I can tell you. But what's all the hurry about?\"\n\n\"Read the letter,\" says Miss Owenson, placing it in her hand, and looking out with a woe-begone face at the fast dark[Pg 22]ening evening sky. One, two, three, four, five more evenings may she watch that little white, cold-looking, half moon float up yonder among the tamaracs, five more evenings may she listen to the discordant shrieks of the thirty-four boarders making day hideous, and then never more for all time. And another large tear comes plump down, at the misery of the thought, in her lap.\n\nCyrilla Hendrick reads the letter, and throws it back with an envious sigh.\n\n\"What a lucky girl you are, Syd! A father and mother who dote upon you—a rich father and mother, a handsome young husband waiting for you, and all the freedom and gayety of a married woman yours, at seventeen. While for me—ah, well!\" with a bitter laugh, \"as poor Freddy used to say, 'Life can't be all beer and skittles' for the whole of us.\"\n\n\"Freddy!\" Sydney exclaimed, looking up at her friend with sudden curiosity, \"that is the first time I ever heard you mention any man's name! Who is Freddy?\"\n\n\"Ah, who indeed?\" Miss Hendrick answers with another half laugh. \"'Thereby hangs a tale,' which I'm not inclined to tell at present. But I say again, what a happy girl you are, Sydney Owenson!\"\n\n\"What, because I am to be married next month, Cy!\" Sydney cries, opening her great eyes in unfeigned wonder. \"You can't mean that.\"\n\n\"I mean that, and everything about your life. You are an heiress, you will be a beauty, you have people who love you, you make friends wherever you go. Why, here in school the girls swear by you—even snuffy, priggish, dried-up little Mam'selle Stephanie, in her dreary way, is fond of you. At sixteen you wear diamonds and 'walk in silk array.' While I——\" Again she stopped, with a gesture that was almost passionate in the intensity of its envy. Sydney looked at her in wonder. The bitterness of her tone and words was a new revelation; it was a contrast indeed to the usually cool, almost insolent serenity of Cyrilla Hendrick's manner.\n\n\"While you, Cy,\" Sydney supplemented, \"are ten times over better looking than I am, sing better, play better, paint and draw better, speak four languages, and are the cleverest girl, mam'selle says, she ever had in her school. You have an aunt who is fabulously rich, so everybody says, who has adopted you, and whose heiress you are to be. While, as for being married——.\"[Pg 23]\n\nCyrilla Hendrick laughed, as Miss Owenson faltered and paused, all her easy insouciance of manner returned.\n\n\"While, as for being married, I have only to walk over to St. Jacques Barracks and ask any of the officers, and they will take me on the spot—is that what you want to say, Syd? And I sing well, play well, paint well, and am a famous linguist? Lucky for me I am, since these accomplishments are my stock in trade, with which, until some man does compassionate me, I am to earn the bread I eat.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you.\"\n\n\"Don't you? You never suspected, I suppose, that my brilliant rôle in the drama of life is that of governess?\"\n\n\"Governess! What nonsense, Cyrilla. The rich Miss Dormer's heiress and niece!\"\n\n\"The rich Miss Dormer's heiress and niece! Sydney, would you like to know exactly how much Miss Dormer means to do for her pauper niece, Cyrilla Hendrick?\"\n\n\"If you please, Cy. You know you and your history are darkest mysteries to Mademoiselle Chateauroy's boarders.\"\n\nCyrilla laughed, still standing behind her friend. \"I knew it, chère belle, and mysteries we all like to remain. Let me unveil the darkness to you a little. I was born in Paris eighteen years ago, in a garret—mark that, daughter of Mammon!—and my mother was the daughter of a baronet; my father was the only brother of the rich Phillis Dormer. My father was one of the handsomest men, one of the cleverest men, and one of the most utterly unprincipled men in Europe—a thorough-paced adventurer, in fact, as Aunt Phil takes care to impress upon my innocent mind every time I see her—an out-and-out Bohemian. Before I was twelve years old I had traversed the Continent from one end to the other, and had a smattering of every European language. No wonder I study them with facility now. When I was twelve my father came to England, his native land, and there, in the parish of Bloomsbury, we set up our household gods, and from utter vagabondism went in for moderately respectable Bohemianism. My mother was dead—luckily for her, poor soul!—and I was housekeeper in the Bloomsbury establishment—think of that, Syd—at twelve years old! From that until I was sixteen, I kept my father's house, and I saw more of life—real, genuine life—in those three years than you, mademoiselle—only child and heiress—will ever see in your whole respectable, rich, Philistine existence! Good heaven, Syd! how happy I used to be with my handsome, clever, vagabond father and my poor, dear little Fred.\"[Pg 24]\n\nShe stopped—passionate pain, passionate regret in her face and voice. Sydney Owenson sat listening with bated breath to this marvellous and rather shocking revelation.\n\n\"It was poverty, Syd, but picturesque poverty; that meant truffled turkey and champagne to-day, and a dry crust and a cup of water to-morrow; a seat in the upper tier of a Strand theatre or Astley's circus among the gods of the gallery, big bearded men to take me on their knee, and kiss me, and pet me; men who wrote books, and painted pictures, who wore sock or buskin, who got tipsy on gin and water or Cliquot, as their finances stood. Men who taught me to roll up their cigarettes, and to light them after. By the way, Syd,\" Cyrilla broke off her half-bitter, half-cynical tone, ending in a sudden laugh, \"do you remember the night, after I came here first, that Miss Jones caught me smoking a rose-scented cigarette, a dozen of you standing around in an awestruck and admiring row? She told Mademoiselle Stephanie, as in duty bound, and got me punished. I vowed vengeance, and the vendetta has waged between us ever since.\"\n\n\"I remember, Cy. And what a superior being you seemed to me, to be able to sit there and smoke off four cigarettes without wincing once! Go on.\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\" Cyrilla said coolly, \"there's nothing more to go on about. When I was sixteen, Aunt Phil sent for me, and I bade farewell to old England and my jolly Bedouin life, and came to America, exchanged the tents of vagabondia for the red brick mansion of respectability. She found me half savage, wholly uneducated, according to her notions, and knowing a great deal I would be much better without. She sent me here—unfolded something of my antecedents to horrified ma'm'selle, and I had to pledge myself to keep my disreputable history to myself before I could be taken into this spotless fold of youth and innocence. That is three years ago—I am almost nineteen, and at Christmas I am to leave school for good.\"\n\n\"To go and live with Miss Dormer?\"\n\n\"To go and live with Miss Dormer, in the dreariest, gruesomest old house in America; companion to the crossest spitefulest old woman on earth? Don't be shocked, Syd—she is! I'm to read to her, write for her, play for her, sing for her, sew for her, feed the birds and cats, and run her errands, all for my clothes and keep.\"\n\n\"And her fortune when she dies?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it! She has two wills made, unsigned.[Pg 25] One bequeaths her hundred thousand dollars to endow an asylum for superannuated maiden ladies; the other bequeaths that sum to myself, on condition——\"\n\n\"Well?\" Sydney cried breathlessly.\n\n\"On condition that I'll swear—swear on the Bible, mind!—to do something she wants me to do. I haven't taken the oath yet, and I believe, oath or no oath, she will never trust me an inch farther than she can see me. 'There is bad blood in my niece Cyrilla'\"—Miss Hendrick grows dramatic when she narrates, it is a high-pitched old woman's voice that speaks—\"'all the Hendricks were reprobates—all, every one!' 'Do we gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?' My niece Cyrilla is—fortunately—the last of the tribe, a Hendrick to her finger-tips, and mark my words! my niece Cyrilla will come to no good end.'\"\n\n\"Ugh, how horrid!\" said Miss Owenson, with something between a laugh and a shudder. \"I wonder, thinking that she ever troubled with you at all.\"\n\n\"So do I wonder. She means to utilize me until the final catastrophe comes, and I disappear in the outer darkness to which I was born. It is a wonderful old woman—Aunt Phil! And sometimes, Syd, sometimes,\" the handsome, youthful face darkened and grew sombre, \"when I think of what my past was, when I think of what my father is, when I think of what my future is likely to be, I rank Aunt Phil among the prophets, and believe, with her, that her niece Cyrilla will come to no good end!\"\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nSCHOOL GIRL GOSSIP.\n\nhere is a silence for a while. Cyrilla Hendrick has walked away to the curtainless school-room window, and stands looking out at the pale, chill, twilight sky, where a white moon hangs silvery, a few yellow, frosty, sparkling stars near. The tamaracs shiver and toss their feathery green plumes in the evening breeze, a breeze that bears a prophecy of coming winter even now in its breath. Miss Hendrick's handsome brunette face looks darker and sadder than Sydney Owenson has ever seen it before.\n\n[Pg 26]\n\n\"Ten minutes and the study bell will ring, and this horrid tumult end, for which Dieu merci. Look at them, Syd, 'a motley crowd, my masters, a motley crowd.' Of course, all this I've told you is strictly sub rosa. Mademoiselle Stephanie, poor old snuffy soul, would go out of her senses if she thought I was corrupting her favorite pupil by such improper conversation.\"\n\nShe half-turned around, all her gloom gone, the airy ease of manner, so uncommon in a school-girl, and which constituted this school-girl's especial charm, back. Independently of wealth and social position (and no one on earth thought more of wealth and social position than this waif of vagabondia), she liked Sydney Owenson for her own sake.\n\n\"I promised not to tell, you know, Syd; and, reprobate as Aunt Phil thinks me, I like to keep my word. I have kept it for three years; all those noisy girls think, as you thought an hour ago, that my life, like their lives, has been the quintessence of dull, drab-colored gentility. Your papa was a captain in the English navy once, wasn't he, and is a great stickler for good birth and breeding? I wonder if he would ask the rich and respectable Miss Phillis Dormer's niece to be your bridemaid if he were listening now?\"\n\n\"If papa knew you as I do, he would like and admire you as I do,\" Sydney cried, warmly. \"Who could help it? I never saw a man yet whom you did not fascinate in ten minutes if you chose.\"\n\n\"If I chose?\" Cyrilla laughed. \"Ah, yes, Syd, the men like me, and always will; let that be my comfort. I shall be one of those women whom other women look upon askance, and know as their natural enemy at sight, but men will like me to the end of the chapter. Only be very sure of this, pretty little Sydney.\" She took the pearl-fair face between her two hands, and stooped and kissed her. \"You need never fear me.\"\n\n\"Fear you, Cy? What nonsense! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"This Mr. Bertie Vaughan is handsome, you say, Syd?\" was Cyrilla's inapposite answer. \"Let me look at his photo again.\"\n\nAs a rule Miss Owenson wore her lover's picture and locket affectionately in her trunk, but she chanced to have it on to-day. She snatched the slender yellow chain off her neck and handed it to her friend. She had been touched strangely by Cyrilla's confidence, more touched still by the unexpected caress. They had been good friends and staunch comrades dur[Pg 27]ing the past three years, with the average of school-girl quarrels and make-ups; but never before had Cyrilla Hendrick been known to kiss her or any other creature in the school. She was wonderfully chary of enthusiasm or caresses; set down as \"that proud, conceited thing\" by her fellow-boarders, admired and envied for her superior cleverness and ease of manner, and dark, aristocratic, high-bred face, liked by a few, Sydney Owenson chief among them, and cordially hated by the many. Without knowing why, without being able to reason on the matter, they instinctively felt she was of them, but not like them.\n\nShe came into their midst with her pauper head held well aloft, a sort of defiance in her black, derisive eyes, a sort of superior contempt for them and their ignorance of life in her slight sarcastic smile. Wonderfully reticent for a girl of sixteen, she yet said things, and did things, besides the smoking of cigarettes, that proved that she had lived, before coming here, in a very different world from any they had ever known. The sketchy outline of her life she had given to Sydney Owenson—the sketchy outline only—there were details that might have been filled in, which would have raised every red-gold hair on Miss Owenson's pretty head aloft with dismay. She had seen life with her \"handsome, clever, reprobate father,\" as luckily it falls to the lot of few daughters ever to see it. Bacchanalian nights of gambling, song-singing, wine-drinking, and festive uproar. There was not a capital in Europe which she and her doll had not visited at the age of twelve. She had spent three whole months behind his chair at Baden-Baden, with a pin and a perforated card, and starved and feasted as he lost or won. All the jolly outlaws of Bohemia had lounged in the shabby rooms of \"Jack Hendrick,\" where a perpetual \"tobacco parliament\" seemed to reign. Scions of aristocracy, youthful sprigs of gentility, deep in the books of the children of Israel, made it their headquarters and lounging-place, and lost their last sovereign to their genial host. Clever painters, whose pictures hung on the line in the Royal Academy, had painted \"Little Beauty Hendrick\"—as Cyrilla had been named—painted her as Cupids, as Undines, as Hebes, as gypsies, as angels, as everything a plump, pretty, black-eyed rosebud of a child could be painted. Clever actors gave her orders to their plays, and coached her in small private theatricals. Old Jean Jacques Dando, teacher of the ballet of the Princess Theatre, taught her to dance, and the first violinist taught her to play the fiddle. She could jabber in five different languages at[Pg 28] twelve, and read French novels by the wholesale. Tall booted and spurred military swells had carried her aloft on their shoulders, and taught her to roll and light their cigarettes. Midnight, as a rule, was this little damsel's hour of lying down, and noonday her time of rising up. Then, in the midst of this jolly, vagabond career, came Miss Phillis Dormer's offer and its acceptance.\n\n\"Will you go, Beauty?\" her father said, doubtfully. \"It will be beastly dull without you, but the old girl's rich, and intends to make you her heiress, no doubt. She'll send you to school, and do the handsome thing by you when she dies. Will you go?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I'll go,\" Cyrilla answered, promptly. \"I'll pack my trunk and be ready at once. Freddy says there's a steamer to sail day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Ah! Freddy says,\" her father repeated, still looking at her doubtfully. \"Look here, Beauty! I wouldn't say anything about Freddy, or the rest of 'em over there, if I were you. Just tell the old girl and the other Philistines you meet that you came of poor—poor, but honest—parents you know. Mum's the word about the card-playing and the scampering over the world, and—the whole thing, in short.\"\n\n\"You may trust me, father. I know when to hold my tongue and when to speak. I haven't lived with you sixteen years for nothing,\" calmly says Mademoiselle Cyrilla.\n\n\"No, by Jove!\" Jack Hendrick cried, admiringly. \"You're the cleverest little thing that ever breathed, Beauty! You know on which side your bread's buttered. And you'll not forget the dear old dad, eh, Cy? out there among the purple and fine linen, and your first taste of respectability?\"\n\nSo Cyrilla came and was received by Miss Dormer—a pale, dark girl, tall and slim, quiet, silent and demure. But Aunt Phil had the keenest old eyes that ever sparkled in the head of a maiden lady of sixty, and read her like a book.\n\n\"Ha!\" the old voice scornfully cried; \"you live sixteen years with Jack Hendrick and then come to me and try to take me in with your mock-modest airs! But I'm an old bird, and not to be caught with chaff. You're a very pretty girl, Cyrilla—you take after your father in that—and you hold your beggar's head well up, which I like to see. You take that and your aquiline nose from your mother. Your mother was a fool, my dear, as I suppose you know, and proved her folly to all the world, by running away with handsome, penniless, scoundrelly[Pg 29] Jack Hendrick. She was the daughter of a baronet, and engaged to a colonel of the Guards—Lord Hepburn to-day—and she ran away one night, just three weeks before her appointed wedding, with your father. Ah! well, she paid for that bit of romance, and is in her grave long ago—the very best place for her. But you're a Hendrick, my niece Cyrilla—a Hendrick to the backbone, and a precious bad lot, I have no doubt. I never knew a Hendrick yet who came to a good end—no, not one! and you take care, niece Cyrilla, or you'll come to a bad end, too.\"\n\n\"I dare say I shall,\" niece Cyrilla answered, coolly, seeing in a moment that perfect frankness was best with this extraordinary old fairy godmother. \"My father always taught me that coming to grief was the inevitable lot of all things here below. At least I hope I shall do it gracefully.\"\n\n\"I'm going to send you to school,\" the old lady pursued, \"for three years, and mind you make the most of your time. You are as ignorant as a Hottentot now of all you ought to know, and horribly thorough in all you ought not. I shall send you to the Demoiselles Chateauroy, at Petit St. Jacques—a very strict school and a very dull place, where even you cannot get into mischief. And mind! don't you go contaminating your fellow-pupils by tales of vagabond life! Don't you offend me, niece Cyrilla; I warn you of that.\"\n\n\"I don't intend to, Aunt Phil,\" the girl answered, good-humoredly. \"I shall study hard, and be a credit to you; trust me. I know my ignorance, and am as anxious to shake the dust of vagabondism off my feet as you can possibly be. I shall do you honor at school.\"\n\nShe had kept her word. She was brilliantly clever, and amazed and delighted her teachers by her progress. She was the pride of the school at each half-yearly exhibition; her playing, her singing were such as had never been heard within these walls before. And in the small milk-and-water dramas performed on these occasions she absolutely electrified all beholders. In truth, she did it so well that the Demoiselles Chateauroy were almost alarmed.\n\n\"She goes on more like a real play actress than a school-girl,\" they said; \"it can't be the first time she has tried parlor theatricals.\"\n\nIt was not, indeed. And at one of these exhibitions a little incident had occurred that disturbed Ma'm'selle Stephanie more and more. The rooms were crowded. \"Cinderella\" had been[Pg 30] dramatized expressly for the occasion, and \"Miss C. Hendrick\" came on as the Prince, in plumed cap and silk doublet, acting her part, as usual, con amore, and making much more violent love than ever Mlle. Stephanie had intended to the Cinderella of the piece. As she came gracefully forward before the audience, singing a song, a tall, dashing-looking man, an officer newly arrived from England, had started up.\n\n\"It is!\" he exclaimed; \"by Jupiter, it is!—Beauty Hendrick!\"\n\nMiss Hendrick had flashed one electric glance from her black eyes upon him, and the play went on. People stared, the Demoiselles Chateauroy turned pale; pupils pricked up curious little ears and looked askance at the big trooper. \"He knew Cy Hendrick, and called her Beauty. What did it mean?\"\n\nThe performance over, Major Powerscourt sought out Mlle. Stephanie, and a low and earnest conversation ensued—the gentleman pleading, the lady inexorable.\n\n\"But I knew her in England, knew her intimately, by Jove!\" said the gallant major, pulling his long red mustache in perplexity. \"Just let me speak to her one moment, mademoiselle!\"\n\nMademoiselle was resolute.\n\n\"I would be very happy, monsieur,\" was her answer, polite, but inexorable, \"but it is her aunt's wish that she makes no new gentlemen acquaintances and renews no old ones. What Monsieur the major asks is, I regret, impossible.\"\n\n\"Confound her aunt!\" Major Powerscourt muttered inwardly, but he only bowed and turned away. \"Little Beauty Hendrick! and here! By Jove! it will go hard with me though if I don't see her.\"\n\nSee her he did not. Mademoiselle Stephanie spoke a few low-toned words to her tall pupil. Miss Hendrick listened with downcast eyes and closed lips; then she bowed.\n\n\"It shall be as ma'm'selle pleases, of course,\" she answered, quietly. \"I have no wish to transgress even the slightest of my aunt's commands.\"\n\nWith the words she left the parlors, and appeared no more. Next morning she went for the midsummer vacation to \"Dormer Lodge.\" When she returned, the dangerous Major Powerscourt was gone.\n\nMiss Jones, the second English teacher, had been one of the witnesses of this scene. Miss Jones set her thin lips, and[Pg 31] drew her own conclusions. She hated Cyrilla Hendrick with an absolute hatred,—hated her for her beauty and that indefinable air of haughty, high-bred grace that encircled the girl,—hated her for her bright cleverness and talent,—hated her most of all for her cool impertinence to herself. There was a long debt standing between these two,—a long debt of petty tyrannies on the teacher's part, of serene, smiling insolence on the pupil's.\n\n\"And if the day ever comes, Miss Hendrick,\" Miss Jones was wont to think—\"and I think it will—I'll pay off every affront, every sneer, every scornful smile and innuendo with compound interest.\"\n\nThat day was nearer than Miss Jones dreamed.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\"SO YOUNG, AND SO UNTENDER.\"\n\n\"\n\nell,\" the sweet girlish voice of Sydney Owenson cried, \"have you fallen asleep over Bertie's picture, Cyrilla? What do you think of it?—handsome, isn't he?\"\n\nCyrilla looked up. She had been critically examining the well-looking photographed face of Mr. Bertie Vaughan through her eye-glass, in silence, for the last three minutes. The dark eyes, brilliant as stars, were a trifle short-sighted, black as it is possible for human eyes to be, and consequently the least attractive feature in the very attractive face. She dropped her glass now, and returned the portrait to its owner.\n\n\"Very handsome, Syd; but—you won't be offended, will you?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! Why should I? Go on.\"\n\n\"But rather weak and womanish, rather fickle and unstable, I should say. Not the sort of man to pin your faith to too securely. Men with that sort of mouth and these pretty, girlish dimples in the chin are always weak-minded. You don't mind my saying this, do you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. Poor, dear old Bertie! I think I like weak-minded men, Cy. If he were stern and dignified, and all that, he might think me silly and frivolous, as I am, I daresay, and try to improve me, and not let me have my own way. I should[Pg 32] hate being improved, and I always mean to have my own way. Yes, Cy, I prefer weak-minded men.\"\n\n\"No, you don't, Sydney. You may think so now, but you don't. You want a husband you can lean upon, trust, and look up to. And there are such men, for I've met them—glorious fellows, worth a woman's giving her life for. That's the sort of husband for you, chérie, while I——\"\n\n\"Yes, Cy.\"\n\n\"While I want one who will look up to me—not a Bertie Vaughan exactly—I wouldn't like a fickle man—but a husband whom I can rule, who will let me henpeck him, in short! I couldn't love a man I had to look up to—it's dreadfully tiresome, looking up. And I wouldn't live with a man I couldn't love. It would bore me to have a supreme being for my lord and master. And I never mean to bore myself. Those are my principles.\"\n\nSydney laughed.\n\n\"Mon Dieu! only hear her! One would think she had all mankind by heart. Have you ever met your small, gentle, henpecked ideal, Cy?\"\n\nCyrilla Hendrick did not answer at once, but over her face a smile broke, a smile so soft, so tender, so womanly, that for a moment it transformed her.\n\n\"Yes, Syd,\" she said, softly; \"I have met my ideal, poor, dear little fellow, and loved him well, before I ever saw you. Ah! those were the best days of my life I begin to think; and, like all best things, they are gone forever.\"\n\n\"You can't tell that. To a girl as handsome as you are infinite capabilities lie open, as Carlyle would say. I predict that you will make a brilliant match, Cyrilla.\"\n\n\"I mean to, Sydney. That is why I am here. Every accomplishment, every one of my good looks, are so many steps toward that end. I mean to marry well—that is, a rich man. He may be old as the everlasting hills, he may be ugly as Caliban, he may be vulgar, he may be absolutely idiotic—I will twine roses, like Titania, around his ass's head, and bow myself down, and do homage before him, so that he but possess the bags of ducats. Yes, Syd, my aunt may design me for a life of drudgery in her bleak old house—I mean to marry one of the wealthiest men on this continent before another year ends.\"\n\n\"And henpeck him afterwards?\"\n\n\"By no means. That is my ideal. I won't henpeck my wealthy husband. I shall simply do in all things as I please. But if the fortune of war should go against me, Sydney, and I[Pg 33] fail and come to grief, as Aunt Phil says I shall, I wonder if, under all circumstances, I can count upon a friend in you?\"\n\n\"Under all circumstances, Cyrilla, through good report and evil report, for better or for worse, I will be your true friend always.\"\n\n\"You vow this, Sydney?\" She came closer, the black eyes eager, dark, intense earnestness in her face. \"It is no school-girl promise, made and forgotten in a moment. You mean this?\"\n\n\"With all my heart!\" Sydney exclaimed, carried away by the moment's excitement, her fair \"flower face\" flushing. \"Your faithful and firm friend to the end.\"\n\n\"Shake hands on that!\" Cyrilla said, holding out her own; and the white, diamond-starred hand, and the brown, ringless one met and clasped for a moment firmly and strongly as the clasp of two men.\n\n\"It is a compact between us,\" Cyrilla Hendrick said. \"I have a presentiment that one day you will be called upon to fulfil that promise. There goes the study bell at last.\"\n\n\"And you haven't promised to be my bridesmaid. Will you, Cy?\"\n\n\"Of course. If your father will write to Aunt Phil and ask her. I know she will be delighted to say yes. In common with all virtuous people she has the intensest respect for rich and respectable associations. Apropos of the rich and respectable, we're asked to a small dinner at Mrs. Colonel Delamere's on Friday evening—Hallowe'en, you know. Will you go?\"\n\n\"Only too glad. Who knows—we may see some of the new officers. You've heard that another regiment was quartered at the barracks last week. The colonel may fetch some of them along.\"\n\n\"Ah! pigs may fly, but they're unlikely birds!\" is Miss Hendrick's more expressive than elegant answer. \"No such luck, Syd. Mademoiselle Stephanie, or Mademoiselle Jeanne will be along as usual, to play sheep-dog to us lambs—or, worse still, Miss Jones—and turn to stone any military interloper under fifty with one glance of her Gorgon eye.\"\n\nThe folding doors of the school-room flew open and Miss Jones came in, the four and thirty boarders at her heels. Cyrilla sauntered away to her desk, singing as she went:\n\n\"No singing in study hours. Miss Hendrick!\" cried Miss Jones, sharply, with a flash of her pale eyes.\n\nCyrilla smiled—the smile that always galled Miss Jones more than words, and went humming on her way unheeding.\n\n\"I shall report you to Mademoiselle Chateauroy, Miss Hendrick!\" Miss Jones angrily cried.\n\n\"What! again? Poor Mademoiselle Chateauroy, to be compelled to listen,\" Cyrilla answered, mockingly, taking her seat and her books.\n\nSilence fell. Five and thirty girls bent five and thirty heads over five and thirty books for the space of half an hour—then the loud ringing of a bell, then a simultaneous jump of five and thirty girls on their feet, a hustling of books into desks, doors flung wide, and a marshalling, two deep, Miss Jones at their head, and in strictest silence, down stairs to the refectory.\n\nThe meal was eaten, still in silence,—Miss Jones read aloud some drearily instructive book, then back to the school-room—more study—another half-hour's recreation, and then to their rooms for the night. It was one among Miss Jones's manifold duties, to go the round of the rooms and remove the lights. The chamber of Cyrilla Hendrick and her companion was the very last of the row, but to that room Miss Jones spitefully went first. Miss Hendrick was busily writing out to-morrow's German exercise.\n\n\"What! so soon?\" she cried out. \"Antoinette, look at your watch. Miss Jones must have made a mistake. It's a good ten minutes yet to nine, and I haven't my exercise done.\"\n\n\"It's nine o'clock, Miss Hendrick,\" Miss Jones retorted grimly, seizing the lamp. \"If you are behind with your exercise it is your misfortune, not my fault.\"\n\nShe paused a moment, lamp in hand, and gazed at Cyrilla's indignant face with ill-concealed exultation.\n\n\"You made a mistake this afternoon, Miss Hendrick. I am going on Friday night, in charge of you and the others, to Mrs. Delamere's.\"\n\nMiss Hendrick might be discomfited, never defeated. At a moment's notice she was ever ready to do battle with her foe.\n\n\"Are you, Miss Jones? Poor Mrs. Delamere! But she must expect to pay some penalty if she will ask school-girls.[Pg 35] For myself, I don't mind, but one can't help compassionating Mrs. Delamere—with her natural dislike of canaille, too.\"\n\nIt was a coarser shaft than even Cyrilla was wont to wing. A furious look was her answer. Then, armed with the lamp, Miss Jones had left the room.\n\n\"Mon Dieu! Cyrilla, how impertinent you are!\" the French girl exclaimed. \"Are you not afraid she will report you to mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Not a bit afraid, Toinette; the principal amusement of Miss Jones' life is reporting me to mademoiselle. I don't know what will become of her when I leave school at Christmas, and that healthful stimulus is taken from her sluggish blood. Now, then, Toinette—to bed, to bed!\"\n\nAs a rule, the Demoiselles Chateauroy did not allow their pupils to dissipate their minds by accepting invitations from their friends in Petite St. Jacques.\n\nThere were a few exceptions made, however, in the graduating class by the express desire of parents and guardians. The girls were to quit the pensionnat so soon and \"come out,\" that to accept a few invitations to innoxious tea-parties and dinners could do no great harm. But even on these occasions one of the Demoiselles Chateauroy or one of the under teachers invariably went along to keep a watchful eye on their charges, and see that the masculine element was not too dangerous. It was an understood thing, particularly when an invitation came from Mrs. Colonel Delamere, that no officer under half a century was to put in an appearance.\n\nOn this eventful Friday afternoon, then, destined to make an epoch in more than one of their lives, the young ladies, five in number, with Miss Jones in the rôle of guardian angel, set out at four o'clock down the Rue St. Dominique to Nôtre Dame Street, where resided Mrs. Colonel Delamere, Miss Hendrick and Miss Owenson, as usual, walking arm-in-arm, as usual, also, making a very pretty contrast—a fact which the elder of the two at least very well knew. Cyrilla wore her one best dress—Aunt Phil's Christmas gift, a garnet merino—its rich tints setting off well her richer beauty, a ruffle of thread lace at throat and wrists: for ornaments, brooch and ear-rings of rubies and fine gold. Miss Hendrick had brought these jewels with her from England, and, apart from their intrinsic worth and extreme becomingness to her brunette face, valued them as parting gifts from \"Freddy.\"\n\n\"He gave them to me with tears in his eyes, and nearly[Pg 36] ruined himself, poor little dear\"—Miss Hendrick always spoke of this gentleman as though he were seven years old—\"to buy them. As Mademoiselle Stephanie would say, 'Fred is as poor as mouses of the church.'\"\n\nMiss Owenson, in turquoise blue silk, her drooping, sun-bright ringlets, tied back into a knot of blue ribbon, falling loosely over her shoulders, looked by contrast white and pure and fair as a lily. She wore no adornings, except her shining engagement ring and her chain and locket.\n\n\"I can't quite realize, Syd,\" Miss Hendrick observed thoughtfully, \"that this time next month you will be, as people phrase it, 'a respectable married woman.' And only seventeen years old!\"\n\n\"It does seem absurd, doesn't it?\" Sydney laughed; \"it is absurd. I wish poor papa's crotchet had taken any other form; but since it has taken this, there is nothing for it but obedience. I would do much more unpleasant things than marry Bertie to please poor, sick, hypochondriacal papa.\"\n\nCyrilla looked at her curiously.\n\n\"You are an oddity, Sydney—half child, half woman; I don't quite understand you. Do you love this Bertie Vaughan?\"\n\nSydney laughed again, and blushed—that bright, flitting blush that made her pearl-clear face so lovely.\n\n\"Love?—love, Cyrilla?\" The girl of seventeen pronounced the incisive word shyly, as most girls of seventeen do. \"Oh, well, that's another thing, you see—something, I fancy, one thinks more of at seven-and-twenty than at seventeen. Of love, such as I have read in novels and poetry, I know nothing. I am not sure I ever want to know. As far as I can make out, love and misery are synonymous. No, I'm not in love with Bertie—I'm tolerably sure of that.\"\n\n\"Nor he with you?\"\n\n\"Nor he with me. How could we—only boy and girl? Since I was ten years old, and Bertie fifteen, papa gave us to understand we were to marry some day, and we never made any objections. I like Bertie better than any one I ever knew—that is enough.\"\n\n\"Enough? Oh, you poor child! You like Bertie—yes, and some day, when you are ten years older, the right man (they say there is a right man for all of us, if we only wait long enough) will appear on the scene, and then—and then, Syd, you will wake up and know what love and marriage mean.\"[Pg 37]\n\nOnce more Sydney laughed aloud—her sweet, clear, heart-whole laugh.\n\n\"Cyrilla Hendrick turned sentimental! What shall I hear next? Have you been reading French novels lately, Cy?—that sounds like an extract. Oh, no, Cyrilla!\"—the girl's face grew suddenly grave—\"I am not a bit like one of the heroines of your pet romances. When I am Bertie's wife I will love him—yes, love him with my whole heart; and no man in all this world will be to me what he will. Of love, as you mean it, I know nothing; but that I will be Bertie's true and loyal wife I know as well as that I am walking here.\"\n\nCyrilla smiled—the cynical and most worldly smile that often marred the beauty of her Titian-like face.\n\n\"We will see!\" she said, prophetically. \"Meantime, what a romantic old gentleman your papa must be! I thought that sort of thing, affiancing people in their cradles, went out of fashion two or three centuries ago.\"\n\n\"It is simple enough after all,\" Sydney answered. \"I will tell you how it was, Cy, in return for your confidence the other day. When papa was a very young man, and a middy in the British Navy, he was guilty of some youthful indiscretion—I don't know to this day what—but some act that if brought to the ears of his captain would have disgraced and ruined him for life. Mr. Vaughan, Bertie's father, was second officer of the ship, and Mr. Vaughan came to papa's aid, rescued him from his danger, screened him—saved him, in a word. Papa could do nothing then to prove his gratitude, but in his heart his gratitude was deep and strong. Years and years after, when papa had come into a fortune, and was married, and I was a baby, his turn came. Mr. Vaughan died poor, very poor, leaving Bertie friendless and alone. Papa came forward, sought him out, brought him here, and adopted him as his son. I was one year old, and Bertie six, but I believe even then, Cy, he destined us for each other. He had married mamma in New York—mamma is American, you know—and finally, when his health began to fail, he came and settled there. The climate agrees with him, and mamma prefers it. Bertie was at Rugby at the time, and finally went up to Oxford. I had not seen him for three years before last vacation, when he came over, and, as I told you girls, gave me this ring, and informed me he intended to marry me next year. Of course papa had told him to do it, and I am sure if I must marry, I would rather marry Bertie than any dreadful, strange man. That is the whole story Cyrilla, romantic or not, as you like.\"[Pg 38]\n\n\"H'm!\" was Cyrilla's comment, her black eyes twinkling; \"what a comfort it must be to your papa to possess so dutiful a son and daughter. I am curious to see this docile Mr. Vaughan, and curious, very curious, Syd, to see how this romantic marriage turns out.\"\n\n\"You are welcome,\" Miss Owenson answered, stoutly. \"It will be a modern case of Darby and Joan, I feel sure. When we are married and settled—we are to live at home with papa and mamma, of course—you must come and make me a long visit, and we will look out together for the ugly, old, idiotic, wealthy Bottom the Weaver, you intend to marry.\"\n\nMiss Hendrick laughed, then sighed impatiently—that look of dark discontent Sydney had learned to know long ago over-spreading her face like a cloud.\n\nShe glanced up at her, half-wonderingly, half-compassionately.\n\n\"Cyrilla,\" she said, holding the girl's arm a little closer, \"what a troubled face you wear!—what a troubled face you often wear, as though you were almost sick of your life.\"\n\n\"Almost!\" Cyrilla Hendrick repeated—\"almost, Sydney! Why, there never was a time when I was not sick of my life. I have an infinite capacity for discontent, I think—for discontent, envy, and all uncharitableness. I long for freedom, for riches, for splendor, for the glory of the world, more than words can ever tell. And drudgery, and poverty, and meanness have been mine since I can recollect. But, as you say, Syd, I have a handsome face, and the average of brains behind it, and it will go hard with me, if out in the big, wide world I cannot win for myself a place in the first rank.\"\n\nSydney Owenson gazed at her in increased wonder and perplexity. Her own life ran on like some clear, shining river; the turbid, restless spirit of her bolder friend she could by no means understand. In all things her life sufficed for her, and had from the beginning; with her niche in the world she was amply content. This craving, never-satisfied longing for the unattainable was to her a marvel.\n\n\"We were talking of love a few minutes ago,\" she said, trying perplexedly to work out the puzzle. \"Are you in love, Cyrilla, with Freddy?\"\n\nCyrilla laughed—the sweetest, airiest laugh was Cyrilla's—the clouds clearing away as if by magic.\n\n\"And if I am, Sydney, you don't think, I hope, that has anything to do with it! Oh, no! If I were queen of the universe,[Pg 39] and all the best and bravest of mankind knelt before me, I would single out little Fred Carew and marry him from among them all, and care for him as greatly as it is in me to care for any one besides myself, and make him most exquisitely miserable for the rest of his mortal life, I have no doubt. But with my chronic dissatisfaction with my lot, Freddy, at present, has nothing to do.\"\n\n\"And yet you are fond of him?\"\n\n\"Fond of him? Fond of Fred Carew? Ah! well, Syd, it's one of those things that won't bear talking about. We have said good-by, and said it for all time.\"\n\n\"Who knows? You will one day inherit Miss Dormer's fortune, marry your Fred, and live happy ever after.\"\n\n\"Never, Syd! I opened the mysteries a little the other day. Let me open them still more now. I told you Miss Dormer had agreed to leave her money to me on one condition—that I solemnly swear to obey her in one thing—did I not?\"\n\n\"Yes—well?\"\n\n\"Well—that one thing is, that I am never to marry Fred Carew. Before she signs her will, if I am not already married, I am to swear, in the presence of witnesses, that never, while I live, will I marry poor little Freddy. If I refuse to take that oath, or if I break it when taken, I forfeit every dollar. No more questions, Syd, and get rid of that shocked face. Here we are at Mrs. Delamere's.\"\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\"PART NOW, PART WELL, PART WIDE APART.\"\n\nrs. Colonel Delamere, a fat, fair, and forty matron with the usual comfortable, placid, stall-fed look, came forward in pearl-gray silk to receive her youthful guests. Miss Sydney Owenson, her especial pet, she kissed with effusion.\n\n\"You darling child! how good of you to come so early!\" she whispered. \"And so we are really going to lose you for good!\"[Pg 40]\n\n\"Who told you?\" Sydney demanded, opening wide her gray eyes.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Chateauroy—I called yesterday. Told me you were to be married—a little girl of seventeen! My pet, it's a shame!\"\n\n\"Is it?\" laughed Sydney; \"but a little bird has whispered through the town that Mrs. Colonel Delamere ran away and was married at sixteen!\"\n\n\"So she did, my dear, and a precious simpleton she was for her pains,\" Mrs. Delamere answered, shrugging her ample shoulders. \"Sydney, why did you fetch that shrewish Miss Jones? I have a treat in store for you, girls, but it's against orders—three contraband admirers who are dying to meet my pretty pensionnaires. Miss Jones will be sure to spoil all.\"\n\n\"Poor Miss Jones! she seems to make enemies on every hand. It is war to the knife between her and Cyrilla. Are you really going to introduce the new arrivals? I heard the regiment had come. How nice of you!\"\n\n\"They will drop in after dinner—the colonel dines with them at the mess, and will bring them over afterward. You are to have parlor croquet, and a carpet dance, and go home by moonlight. If only that Miss Jones would not tell!\"\n\n\"How plaintively you speak of that Miss Jones,\" Sydney laughed. \"Let the most fascinating of your military heroes make love to her, Mrs. Delamere, give her his arm home, and so seal the dragon's mouth.\"\n\nMrs. Delamere looked doubtfully across at Miss Jones.\n\n\"Do you think so, pet? But then she is so plain, poor thing, and not so young as she was ten years ago, and though they're all plucky fellows enough, yet I'm afraid they're not equal to it. However, we will eat, drink, and be merry to-night, if we are to die for it to-morrow.\"\n\nAll things went on in a most exemplary way for the next two hours, until the six o'clock dinner ended. Not a red coat, not even a black coat, made its appearance. Games of all kinds, books of all sorts, had been provided by Mrs. Delamere, the jolliest of hostesses, for her young friends. They dined together, waited upon by a solemn, elderly butler, and even Miss Jones was amused and propitiated by Mrs. Delamere's condescending kindness.\n\n\"I really want the poor things to enjoy themselves this evening, my dear Miss Jones,\" she said, confidentially. \"You must[Pg 41] permit them a little extra liberty, and at least one hour more than usual.\"\n\nMiss Jones fixed her dull, glimmering eyes upon the colonel's lady, scenting danger afar off.\n\n\"My orders are not to allow my pupils out of my sight, madame,\" she answered, stiffly; \"and to bring them home positively at nine. It is as much as my position is worth to disobey.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! my dear Miss Jones. I will make it all right with Mademoiselle Chateauroy. Do recollect how little amusement the poor things have, and remember we were once young ourselves.\"\n\nIt was the most unfortunate appeal the good lady could have made. Miss Jones was verging upon the thirties, a period when any unmarried lady may be pardoned for becoming sensitive. Her leaden eyes absolutely flashed.\n\n\"Mrs. Delamere is very kind, but my orders were positive, and it is my duty to obey.\"\n\nShe set her thin lips, and looked across at Cyrilla Hendrick.\n\n\"The military are coming, and I shall spoil your sport, my lady, if I can,\" she thought, vindictively.\n\nMiss Hendrick at the moment was the centre of a circle of laughing, eager faces. They had adjourned to the ample grounds in front of the house, and seated under a great scarlet maple, armed with a pack of cards, Cyrilla was gravely lifting the mystic veil of futurity.\n\n\"I see here, my pretty lady,\" she was drawling in true gypsy tone to Miss Owenson, \"a sudden journey, and a change in your whole life. Here is a fair man, who is destined to cause you a great deal of trouble. Here are tears, a disappointment, a sick-bed, and—yes—a death.\"\n\n\"Cyrilla!\" Sydney cried, her gray eyes flashing indignantly.\n\n\"It is on the cards—look for yourself, and very near, too. Here is a dark man, this king of spades, who follows you everywhere, and a dark woman, who is your enemy, and comes between you and the fair man, and——\"\n\nShe stopped suddenly, as suddenly as if she had been shot. For a voice broke upon them as she uttered the words.\n\n\"I never go in for high stakes, myself,\" said the pleasant, lazy voice; \"say ponies, or monkeys. My exchequer never stands anything higher. My dear colonel, what a charming scene! a veritable group from Watteau, and sitting on straw, like Marjory Daw! These are the young ladies Mrs. Delamere spoke of, no doubt.\"[Pg 42]\n\nThe speaker raised his eye-glass complacently, and stood surveying the \"group from Watteau,\" as though it had been got up for his especial delectation. He had spoken in an undertone, but in the clear, crisp, still air, every word had reached the ears of the fortune-teller. She did not start, she did not look up, a sudden stillness came over her from head to foot. Then she lifted her handsome, high-bred face, and went coolly on.\n\n\"The dark lady is in love with the fair gentleman, and will do her best to part him from you. Whether she succeeds or not is not on the cards, but I see here no end of trouble, disappointment, sickness and tears.\"\n\n\"A very dreary prediction for lips so gentle to pronounce. Fairest fortune-teller, will you not speer my future as well?\"\n\nThe gentleman whose bets never exceeded \"ponies or monkeys\" had advanced, bowing gracefully, smiling sweetly upon the fluttering group. The seeress lifted her eyes from the pack, and glanced up at him with the careless indifference of a practised coquette. But Sydney Owenson saw, and Miss Jones saw, that the faint rich carnation her olive cheeks ever wore had deepened to vivid crimson.\n\n\"Certainly,\" she answered, with perfect sang froid; \"cross the sibyl's palm with silver, my pretty gentleman, and tell me which shall it be—past, present, or future?\"\n\nShe held out her hand, all present looking on in a flutter of expectation, a startled expression upon Miss Jones' vinegar visage, a bland smile upon Colonel Delamere's.\n\n\"The future, by all means,\" the gentleman answered, making search gravely for the silver coin. He found a sixpence, and dropped it with a second Chesterfieldian bow into the extended palm. She shuffled the cards. \"Cut,\" she said, authoritatively.\n\nThe stranger obeyed, a military stranger all saw, though in mufti. Miss Hendrick took up the first \"cut,\" and began to read.\n\n\"This is the knave of hearts—you are the knave, monsieur! This means water—you have recently made a long voyage. There is the queen of spades—a dark lady whom you are to meet soon, very soon. Let me warn monsieur against this young dark lady; she will cause him endless trouble and mischief if he does not cut her acquaintance at once. Here is a blonde lady, the queen of diamonds, immensely wealthy. Look at all these cards that follow her. She will fall in love with the knave if he sets about it properly, and may even ultimately[Pg 43] marry him. She will not be young and certainly not pretty, but, as you see, she has a fortune that is immense, and that is much better for the knave of hearts, and much more to his taste than youth or pretty looks. The dark lady is poor, and really will make monsieur no end of worry whenever she appears. This card certainly means a wedding. Here it all is—monsieur turns his back upon the evil-minded dark lady, marries the queen of diamonds and her money-bags, and lives happy ever after.\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet, bowed low to the gentleman, and turned as if to depart.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" boomed out the big bass laugh of the colonel. \"By Jupiter, that's good—eh, Carew? If she had known you all your life, by Jove, she couldn't have hit home better—hey, my boy? Let me introduce you—Miss Cyrilla Hendrick, Mr. Carew of the —th Fusiliers.\"\n\n\"Carew!\" The gray eyes of Sydney Owenson opened in swift, sudden surprise. She glanced at Cyrilla, strangely startled, but that young lady was bowing as to one she had never seen before—the gentleman with equal gravity.\n\nSydney drew a long breath. After all Carew was not such a very uncommon name. There might certainly be two men in the world who bore it. If she could only hear his other.\n\n\"Freddy, my boy,\" cried the colonel's cheerful stentor tones, \"here is another. Miss Sydney Owenson, Lieutenant Carew.\"\n\nFreddy! She flashed a glance of amaze and delight across at her friend, but the face of Cyrilla Hendrick was beyond her reading. She had turned partly away, with only the usual, half-indifferent, half-disdainful expression on the handsome brunette face.\n\n\"Mr. Carew, Miss Jones,\" says genial Colonel Delamere, and Miss Jones makes a prim, stiffish, little bow. \"Mademoiselle Marie Antoinette Desereux, Madamoiselle Angele Garneau.\"\n\nTwice more does Mr. Carew bestow his graceful court-chamberlain bow and smile on the bread-and-butter school-girls, and then he is free.\n\n\"Two more coming, Rosebud,\" whispers the elderly colonel to Sydney; \"two more—good men and true. Fred Carew and I toddled on ahead. How does Carew compare with le beau Bertie—eh, little pearl?\"[Pg 44]\n\n\"Mr. Carew is very good-looking indeed, sir; not very tall, but that's a matter of taste,\" answers, demurely, Miss Owenson.\n\n\"And a bit of a dandy—eh, my dear? Regardez vous, as they say here, the lavender kids, the shiny boots, the swell hat, the moss-rose in the button-hole. That coat is one of Poole's masterpieces; but I suppose you are not capable of appreciating Poole's chef-d'œuvres. But, with all his Dundrearyism, he's one of the best and most honorable little fellows that ever breathed, is my young friend, Fred Carew.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, that he is. I've known him since he was the size of this cigar. May I light it? Thank you, my dear. Miss Hendrick hit him off to the life—ha! ha! 'Rich wife—not pretty—not young—lots of money'—ha! ha! ha! Clever girl, very, that handsome, black-eyed Miss Hendrick. Couldn't have struck home more neatly if she had been his mother. Hasn't a stiver but his pay—Carew hasn't—best connections going, but no expectations. Terrible flirt, but no marrying man. However, that's nothing to you, my dear. You're booked. Lucky fellow, that young Vaughan. I've heard of him. Ah! you needn't blush—if I were only twenty years younger and a single man. Well! you may laugh if you like, but Vaughan wouldn't have it all his own way. Yes, as I say—as Miss Hendrick said rather—a wife with fifty thousand down is about Freddy's figure. The widow, or the orphan, my dear, doesn't matter which, and the money not selfishly tied up on herself either.\"\n\nThus guilelessly prattled on the colonel, while Sydney laughed and watched her friend with intense curiosity. At least Colonel Delamere did not dream that Mr. Carew and Miss Hendrick had ever met before—no one did except herself. Yes—one other! Miss Jones' leaden eyes might be dull, but they were sharp, and where Cyrilla Hendrick was concerned hatred had sharpened them to needle-points. She had noticed the first start, the first flush of tell-tale color; she had seen for one moment an expression on her foe's face she had never seen there before. The fortune-telling, too, had been peculiar. Did she mean herself by the \"dark lady,\" Miss Jones wondered? Had they ever met before? Had they met before—in England, for example—and was there some reason for keeping that meeting secret? She would watch, and wait, and see.\n\nMr. Carew had joined Miss Hendrick, and walked away by[Pg 45] her side. For a moment neither spoke—the young lady looking serenely before her straight into space, the young gentleman watching her with a curious smile. He was the first to speak.\n\n\"Well, Beauty?\"\n\n\"Well, Freddy?\" Cyrilla Hendrick's black eyes turned from the horizon to his face at last. \"It is you, Fred Carew, then, after all. How in the name of all that is astonishing do you come to be here?\"\n\n\"What!\" Mr. Carew said, lifting his blonde eyebrows, \"do you mean to tell me, Beauty, you did not know I was here?\"\n\n\"Know you were here! Good Heaven! Fred, what a preposterous question. Freddy Carew away from Regent Street and Rotten Row! Fred Carew out of sight of White's Club House and a Bond Street tailor! No—the human mind refuses to take in such an antithesis! I would as soon expect to meet the Czar of Russia in the wilds of Canada as you, Mr. Carew.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Freddy sighs, plaintively. \"You can't feel sorrier for me, Beauty, than I feel for myself. But the fortune of war, my dear child, however cruel, must be accepted by a soldier. Still, since it has brought me to you, I can't say I regret it.\"\n\n\"You knew I was here?—from papa, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Your papa is improving the shining hours in Boulogne, my dear Cyrilla, and has been for the past year. No; I knew you were in Canada somewhere, and that knowledge alone made the thought of my exile endurable. I had no idea we were to meet, until this very day, at mess.\"\n\n\"And then——\"\n\n\"And then our garrulous friend, the colonel—'our old lady,' the fellows call him—let out the blissful secret. 'Capital place, Petit St. Jacques, Freddy, my boy,' says Delamere to me. 'Yes, mon colonel,' I answer. 'Capital place for a man to go melancholy mad or cut his throat, I should say.' 'Not at all,' retorts my superior officer; 'lots of fun—famous for maple sugar and pretty girls. There's a whole seraglio of beauties down there in the Rue St. Dominique, and you're to meet two of the prettiest at my house this evening—azure-eyed, golden-haired Sydney—black-eyed, raven-tressed Cyrilla. Take either, my boy, with my blessing—you pays your money, and you takes your choice.' Need I tell you, Beauty, I woke up at that—at the sound of your name? 'Both beauties, both heiresses, my boy,' pursued the doddering old colonel; 'and an heiress[Pg 46] is just about what you want most, I should say, Freddy.' 'Precisely, sir,' I answer; 'to which do you advise me to lay siege—belle blonde or brunette?' 'Well, my little Sydney, Miss Owenson, is bespoken, I'm sorry to say,' Delamere answers, 'so it must be Miss Hendrick. Eyes like sloes, lips like cherries, cheeks like roses, and the air of a duchess. Yes, by Jove!' cries the vagabond old colonel, smacking his lips, 'the air of an empress. Benedicite, my son, and go in and win.' So I came, Beauty—I needn't tell you how I felt, and you met me as though you had never seen me before. I made sure you knew all about my being here, and were on guard.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" Cyrilla answered; \"when your voice reached me, as I sat there telling fortunes, I was struck dumb. But oh, dear old fellow! how glad I am to see you—how good it seems to meet a familiar face in this desert of Canada.\"\n\n\"Miss Hendrick!\" peals forth a sharp-accented voice; and Miss Hendrick wakes up almost as from a dream at the too familiar sound. \"Miss Hendrick, you are wanted in the drawing-room, to sing.\"\n\nMr. Carew's glass goes to his eye; Miss Hendrick turns half round upon her foe, with her usual air of serene impertinence.\n\n\"Couldn't you take my place this once, my dear Miss Jones?\" (Miss Jones has about as much voice as a consumptive raven.) \"You see I am well amused as it is.\"\n\n\"I must insist upon your returning to the house, instantly,\" cries Miss Jones, in a rising key. \"My orders are, as you know, not to let you out of my sight.\"\n\nShe advances upon them. Mr. Carew, his glass still in his eye, regards her as he might some newly-discovered and wonderful specimen of the British megatherium.\n\n\"But, my dear Miss Jones,\" he begins, in most persuasive accents, with his most winning smile, \"there is really no need of all this trouble. Your natural and affectionate anxiety about Miss Hendrick does equal honor to your head and heart, but, I assure you, no harm shall come to her while she is in my care. I am ready to shield her, if necessary, with my life.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Chateauroy's orders were not to let any of my pupils out of my sight; more particularly Miss Cyrilla Hendrick—most particularly with gentlemen. I shall obey mademoiselle's orders,\" is Miss Jones's grim and crushing reply.\n\n\"It's of no use, Freddy,\" Cyrilla says, in an undertone; \"we must go back and part. I don't care for her,\" motioning contemptuously toward Miss Jones, \"nor for Mademoiselle[Pg 47] Chateauroy either; but I do care for Aunt Phil. To offend her means ruin to me; and the deadliest offence I can give her is to have anything to say to you. Let us go back, and for pity's sake don't speak to me again until you say good-night.\"\n\n\"But, Beauty, this is absurd,\" says Fred, as they turn to retrace their steps; \"don't speak to you again until I say good-night! What ridiculous nonsense! I have ten thousand things to say to you, and I mean to say them in spite of all the Gorgon aunts and grim duennas on earth. When and where will you meet me?\"\n\n\"I will not meet you at all, Freddy. I tell you it is impossible. I am watched more closely than any other girl in the school, and all are watched closely enough, goodness knows. Miss Jones's basilisk eyes are upon me this moment, and Miss Jones will faithfully report every word and look to the powers that be the moment she returns to the pensionnat.\"\n\n\"Hang Miss Jones!\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" says Cyrilla, laughing; \"nothing would give me greater pleasure. At the same time I can't afford to have my misdeeds reported to Aunt Phil; and so, sir, let us shake hands and part.\"\n\n\"Never, Cyrilla, you must meet me, and at once. Appoint some place and time, here in the town, and I will be there, whether it be midnight or mid-day.\"\n\n\"Impossible. I am never permitted to stir outside the gates alone.\"\n\n\"Then, by Jove! we shall meet inside the gates. I will scale the wall this very night, and you steal down and meet me in the grounds. Cyrilla, for Heaven's sake, don't say no, as I see you are going to! It is three years since we met. Have you forgotten all that——\"\n\n\"I have forgotten nothing, Fred—nothing,\" the girl answers almost with emotion; \"better for me, perhaps, if I had. Yes, I will meet you—at least I will try. I risk more than you dream of, but I will risk it. If you can get over the wall of the pensionnat to-night, I will try to meet you in the grounds.\"\n\n\"My darling\"—under Miss Jones' argus eyes, Mr. Carew takes and squeezes Miss Hendrick's hand—\"are your windows high? Do you run any risk in coming down?\"\n\n\"I run risk enough, as I told you, but not of that kind. My room is on the second floor, and there is a tree close to the window, from whose branches I have often swung myself into the playground. Get over the wall about eleven to-night, and,[Pg 48] if it be possible at all, I will meet you. But mind—only this once, Freddy; not even you will tempt me to do it again.\"\n\n\"You will write to me, though, Beauty, and allow me to——\"\n\n\"No letter comes into or goes out of the pensionnat that does not pass under Mademoiselle Chateauroy's scrutiny. No, Fred; there can be no writing and no meeting except this one. Fate is against us, as it has been from the first. We were not one iota farther apart when the Atlantic rolled between us than we will be here together in Canada.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" Fred Carew answered. \"My own opinion is that fate has not brought us face to face in this queer old world-forgotten town for nothing. We shall meet—you and me, 'Rilla, love—and go on meeting, please Heaven, to the end of the chapter.\"\n\nThey had reached the house. Cyrilla went in at once, while Mr. Carew lingered and allowed Miss Jones to join him. The yellow half-moon was lifting her face over the tree-tops, the air was spicy with aromatic odors from the pine woods. Through the open windows came the gay strains of \"La Claire Fontaine,\" the national air of Lower Canada, played by Miss Sydney Owenson.\n\n\"Why should we go in just yet, Miss Jones?\" says Mr. Carew, in his slow, sleepy voice, with his slow, sleepy smile. \"It is a lovely night, a little coldish, but I perceive you have a shawl across your arm; allow me to put it on—you may take cold—and permit me to offer you my arm for a walk.\"\n\nHe removes the shawl as he speaks, and adjusts it as tenderly and solicitously about Miss Jones's angular shoulders as though it had been Miss Hendrick herself; then, still smiling, he offers her his arm.\n\nThe temptation is great. Miss Jones is nine-and-twenty, and not even at nineteen was her head ever turned by the flattering attentions of fickle man; and Miss Jones, albeit the milk of human kindness has been somewhat curdled in her vestal breast by a long course of refractory pupils, is human, very human.\n\n\"Do come!\" says Mr. Carew, sweetly. \"It is really a sin to spend such a night in-doors. The young ladies? Oh, the young ladies are perfectly safe. There is no one there but the colonel and Mrs. Delamere. The other fellows said they would come, but they haven't, as you may perceive. All the better for me, Miss Jones,\" smiles Mr. Carew, drawing her hand within[Pg 49] his arm, \"since it allows me the pleasure of a tête-à-tête stroll with you.\"\n\nA flush, an absolute flush, rises to Miss Jones's sallow cheeks. Yes, since none of those dangerous military men had come, there could surely be no harm in a little walk with Mr. Carew. She coughed a little cough of assent, and meandered away with her subtle tempter.\n\n\"Oh, Cy, look! do look!\" cries Sydney Owenson, springing from the piano. \"Here's richness! Miss Jones and Mr. Carew getting up a flirtation in the moonlight! She nipped yours in the bud, and now she leads him off captive herself!\"\n\n\"Haw, haw, haw! Yes, by Jove!\" booms the colonel; \"Carew has trotted off Miss Jones! The wolf spares the lambs, and makes off with the sheep-dog! Fred Carew turns his back on four of the prettiest girls in Canada, and begins spooning with the old maid! What a capital joke for the mess-table to-morrow!\"\n\n\"A most capital joke,\" says Cyrilla Hendrick; but her black eyes flash as they follow the two retreating figures. She knows as well as that she stands there that he is doing it for her sake, martyrizing himself to propitiate the dragon, but in her heart she loves this elegant, soft-spoken dandy so passionately well, that the bare sight of him flirting with even poor, plain Miss Jones is hateful to her.\n\nThe lamps are lit in the drawing-room; song, and music, and games of all kinds go on. An hour passes, and the truants have not returned.\n\n\"You don't suppose Carew can have eaten her, Dorothy, my love?\" says the old colonel, with a diabolical grin, to his wife. \"Begad! if they're not here in ten minutes, I shall consider it my duty to go in search of them.\"\n\nThey enter as he speaks—Mr Carew calm, complacent, listless, but not looking more bored than customary—Miss Jones with a flush, either of pleasure or night air, still glowing frostily on either pippin cheek.\n\n\"Mr. Carew asked me to explain the process of converting maple sap into maple sugar,\" she explains elaborately to Mrs. Delamere; \"so we wandered down by the grove of maples, and really I had no idea an hour had passed.\"\n\n\"Pray, don't apologize, my dear Miss Jones,\" answered Mrs. Delamere, demurely. \"I am only too grateful to Mr. Carew if he has helped to make your visit agreeable. What! going so soon? Oh, surely not, Miss Jones!\"[Pg 50]\n\nBut it is past nine, and Miss Jones, conscious of having swerved from the stern path of rectitude, is resolute. So the girls flutter up-stairs after wraps, still giggling in chorus over Miss Jones's unexpected flirtation. Miss Hendrick does not giggle, she smiles scornfully, and transfixes her teacher with her derisive black eyes—a glance Miss Jones, for once, does not care to meet.\n\n\"Begad, Freddy,\" says the colonel, when the ladies have left the room, \"I expected it would be a case of love at first sight with you this evening, but I didn't—no, by gad, I didn't think it would have been with the old maid.\"\n\n\"Miss Jones is a most intelligent and well-informed young lady,\" answers Mr. Carew, imperturbably, and with half-closed eyes. \"I am going to see her home.\"\n\nThey flutter back as he says it, and he and the colonel rise. Good-nights are spoken while Mr. Carew draws on his overcoat and gloves, looking very elegant and amiable, and a little vibrating thrill of expectation goes through the group of girls. To whom will he offer his arm? He walks up to Miss Jones as they think it, with the air of its being an understood thing, and once again draws her hand within his coat sleeve.\n\n\"En avant, mon colonel,\" he says; \"we will follow.\"\n\nThe colonel gives one arm to his favorite, Sydney, the other to Cyrilla, and leads the way. The two French girls come after. Mr. Carew and Miss Jones bring up the rear, sauntering slowly in the piercing white moonlight. All the way, along the deathly silent streets, the colonel cracks his ponderous and rather stupid jokes. Sydney laughs good-naturedly, but Cyrilla Hendrick's darkly-handsome face looks sombre and silent. They reach the gates—Babette, the portress, is there awaiting them. Universal hand-shaking and adieus follow. For one second Cyrilla's cold fingers lie in Fred Carew's close clasp, for one second the blue eyes meet the black ones meaningly.\n\n\"At eleven,\" he whispers; \"don't fail.\"\n\nThen the great gates clang upon them, and Babette, yawning loudly, goes in before into the gray, gloomy pensionnat.\n\n[Pg 51]\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nWHY MISS DORMER HATED FRED CAREW.\n\n\"In twenty minutes, young ladies, I will come for the lights,\" is Miss Jones's valedictory, as she mounts up to her own room.\n\n\"Good-night, Cy,\" Sydney Owenson cries, gayly; \"don't dream of that pretty little Mr. Carew if you can help. His mad passion for Miss Jones is patent to the dullest observer.\"\n\n\"Bonne nuit et bonnes rêves, ma belle,\" Cyrilla answers, with rather a forced smile, \"we would all be happier if we never dreamed of Mr. Carew or any other of his kind.\"\n\n'Toinette goes virtuously and sleepily to bed at once, gaping audibly. Miss Hendrick throws off her hat and jacket, draws a volume of Dante, in the original, toward her, with a book of Italian exercises, and sets to work translating. So, the twenty minutes up, Miss Jones finds her.\n\n\"Industrious, upon my word!\" sneers Miss Jones. She is generally worsted in the fray, but she can never by any chance let her enemy pass without a cut-and-thrust.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Jones,\" Cyrilla replies; \"and if I continue to be industrious until I am—well, nine and twenty, say—I may hope to attain the elevated position of fourth-rate teacher in a second-rate Canadian school; I may even aspire to entertain military men, six or seven years my junior, by an hour's dissertation on the art of making maple sugar.\"\n\nShe rises, with a short, contemptuous laugh, and begins to unlace her boots. Another instant, and the door closes behind Miss Jones, and she is alone.\n\nIt is a vividly, brilliantly bright night. The yellow moonshine floods the room as Cyrilla raises the window, wraps a shawl around her, and sits down. 'Toinette's watch, lying on the dressing-table, points to ten. Another hour and she and Fred Carew will be together once more. Her pulses thrill at the[Pg 52] thought. She loves this man; she has loved him since she was ten years old—of all the bliss life holds it holds none greater than his presence for her. The mystery and danger of the adventure, too, have their charm. Life has gone on, for the past three years, so flat, stale, and unprofitable that to-night's excitement and wrong-doing, if you will, possess an irresistible fascination. If it is ever discovered, if it ever reaches Miss Dormer's ears, all is up with her forever—her last hope of Miss Dormer's fortune is gone. And she longs for and covets Miss Dormer's fortune, this school-girl of nineteen, as the blind desire sight. Miss Dormer hates Fred Carew, and all of his name, with a hatred as intense as—even Cyrilla must own—in a retributive light it is just. The story is this—told with what passionate intensity and vivid fierceness by Miss Dormer herself, the girl remembers well.\n\nForty years before, the father of Phillis Dormer had died, leaving a fortune, a widow, and a daughter of eight. Two years passed, and the widow was a widow no longer—she had taken for her second husband good-looking, good-for-nothing Tom Hendrick. Of that marriage came Jack, the father of Cyrilla. If Mr. Tom Hendrick had expected to possess the late Mr. Dormer's fortune, as well as his widow, he was doomed to be disappointed—the sixty thousand pounds were tightly tied up on Phillis. And Phillis, even as a child, was not easily to be wronged.\n\nShe endured the reckless, riotous life of her step-father's house, the daily insolence of her bold, handsome, half-brother Jack, for a dozen years or more; then her mother died, and Miss Phillis Dormer separated herself entirely from her disreputable relations, and engaging a dame de compagnie, set up for herself as an heiress. The wife of the member for her native county brought her out, one or two fine ladies took her up, she was presented at court, ran the round of "
