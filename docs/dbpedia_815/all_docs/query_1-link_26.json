The Investigation of Symptoms in Alzheimer’s Disease: Toward Optimal Strategies of Treatment for the Disease\n\nYasuhiro Kaneda*, Koudai Yogi\n\nIwaki Clinic, Anan, Japan\n\nBackground: Cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is usually accompanied by various behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and dysfunctions in daily activities. In general, it is considered that there is a worsening of functional decline with progressive impairment of cognitive decline in AD, but BPSD are worse in the middle stages with moderate cognitive impairment than those in the early stages with mild cognitive impairment, and even those in the late stages with severe cognitive impairment. For optimal strategies of treatment for AD, it is quite important to make sure the relations between cognitive function and BPSD/activities of daily living (ADL). Therefore, we investigated again these relations. In addition, based on the findings, we present the optimal strategies of treatment for AD.\n\nMethods: The study patients were 114 visited between January 2019 and June 2019 at the Department of Psychiatry, Iwaki Clinic. Patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of AD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-5) criteria. Patients with other types of dementia were excluded from the study. Neurocognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and BPSD and ADL were assessed by the ABC Dementia Scale (ABC-DS). The ABC-DS, a novel assessment tool for AD is an effective tool in assessing symptoms and the severity of AD over time. The 13 items of the ABC-DS are grouped into three domains: domain A, related to ADL function; domain B, related to BPSD; and domain C, related to cognitive function, and the ABC-DS uses a 9-point scale for each question item, with lower scores indicating poorer function. The JMI software (Version 10.0.2) for Macintosh was used to perform the analyses. The clinical assessment scores were compared between the groups by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post hoc comparisons (Tukey-Kramer HSD). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. This study obtains the approval from Japanese association of Neuro-Psychiatric Clinics Study Ethical Review Board, and the data investigated were retrieved from databases and de-identified before data analyses. After data analyses, two cases with successful treatment by antidementia drugs are presented.\n\nResults: The comparisons between three groups of mild (MMSE, >20), moderate (20-11), and severe (11>) cognitive impairment showed statistically significant differences in domain A and C, but not in domain B. However, for 35 antidementia drug naïve patients, the comparisons between two groups of mild and moderate cognitive impairment showed statistically significant differences in domain B, but not for 79 memantine-treated patients. Seventy-nine patients treated with antidementia drugs were as follows: donepezil, 22 (3mg/day, 1; 5mg, 5; 8mg, 1; 10mg, 15) ; galantamine, 32 (8mg, 1; 16mg, 6; 20mg, 1; 24mg, 23) ; rivastigmine, 24 (9mg, 1; 13.5mg, 1; 18mg, 22); memantine, 35 (10mg, 1; 20mg, 34). Among 35 patients treated with memantine, 33 were taking one of three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs). Seven (9%) of 79 patients with antidementia drugs were on antipsychotics, 4 (5%) were on benzodiazepines, 9 (11%) were on hypnotics, 9 (11%) were on antidepressants, 2 (3%) were on mood stabilizers, and 5 (6%) were on Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine. Case: A 75-year old woman. Mild AD. At initial diagnosis, ADAS-cog-J total score was 12.3. Rivastigmine patch started, and was increased up to 18 mg/day. Subsequently, memantine added, and was increased up to 20 mg/day. Rivastigmine was switched to galantamine, and galantamine was increased up to 24 mg/day. After 40-month treatment, ADAS-cog-J total score was 14.0.\n\nConclusions: There is a worsening of ADL decline with progressive impairment of cognitive decline in AD. BPSD are worse in the middle stages than those in the early stages, but controllable by the treatment. To inhibit decreasing of cognitive function in AD, and thus to prevent occurrence of BPSD and aggravation of ADL, it is critical to maintain initial good cognitive function as much as possible, besides early detection of AD and initiation of the treatment. For this purpose, we should always apply monitoring cognitive function under treatment, and manage limited four antidementia drugs effectively: e.g. combining memantine with a ChEI or switching a ChEI to another ChEI.\n\nKeywords: Alzheimer's Disease, BPSD, Neurocognitive Functioning, Neurocognitive Assessment, ADL\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW2. Computerized Functional Skills Training in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Preliminary Results From a Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nPhilip Harvey*, Peter Kallestrup, Lize Tiberica, Sara Czaja\n\nMiller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: Pharmacological interventions aimed at mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been successful to date. Recent meta-analyses have suggested that computerized cognitive training (CCT) may have beneficial effects on cognition in people with MCI. An additional feature of MCI is impairments in everyday functional skills, revealed in particular with performance on tests of functional capacity. Functional skills training is facilitated by in many populations by CCT, while CCT alone often fails to yield functional benefits. This presentation presents the results of a randomized clinical trial of MCI patients and healthy controls where computerized functional skills training (CFST) was paired in half of the cases with CCT.\n\nMethods: Healthy older (age>59) individuals (n=32) and similarly aged individuals who met diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n=26) were randomized to receive 12 weeks of twice-weekly one hour CFST sessions or 12 weeks of two one-hour sessions split between CCT and CFST. The six functional skills trained were technology based and focused on banking, shopping, and medication management.\n\nResults: Paired t-tests found that completion time for all 6 CFST tasks significantly improved from the baseline assessment to the final training assessment in both groups of participants, all ts >4.31, all ps < .001. Average improvement in time to completion was 45%. Further, none of the 6 tasks improved differentially in the MCI and HC samples, as indexed by percentage of improvement from baseline to end of training: all ts <1.66, all ps >.12. Finally, combined CCT plus CFST did not differ from CFST alone on any of the %-change score measures: all t <1.64, all p >.11.\n\nConclusions: Both groups evidenced substantial improvements in functional skills performance. CCT supplementation led to similar CFST gains with half as many CFST training sessions. Importantly, HC participants who received skills training alone required an average of only 6 sessions per task to perfect their performance. Both groups of participants demonstrated improvements in performance across all tasks; MCI participants required more training sessions but learned equivalently. These findings suggest that training interventions can bypass memory impairments in MCI and lead to gains in the ability to perform everyday functional skills.\n\nKeywords: Functional Capacity, Mild Cognitive Impairment due to AD, Technology-Assisted Treatment\n\nDisclosure: i-Function, Inc, Stock / Equity; Verasci, Inc, Consultant\n\nW3. The Effects of Statins on Cognition in Older Women at Genetic Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease\n\nTonita Wroolie, Siena Roat-Shumway, Katie Watson, Natalie Rasgon*\n\nStanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, United States\n\nBackground: It is well established that the apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele (APOE4) and being female are risk factors for late onset AD. Declines in verbal learning and memory are early and prominent cognitive symptoms of conversion to AD. However, it is unclear whether statin use could provide a protection against AD as there are conflicting findings regarding the effects of statin use on cognition. Therefore, this study sought to examine the effects of statin use on cognition, specifically with respect to verbal learning and memory, by APOE4 status in a sample of cognitively unimpaired women at risk for AD.\n\nMethods: Neuropsychological, statin use, and APOE4 data were utilized as a secondary analysis from an ongoing longitudinal study at the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in Arizona. Subjects (N = 149) were cognitively unimpaired women aged 47-75 with a family history of probable AD in at least one first-degree relative. Neuropsychological outcome variables included total learning, immediate memory, and delayed memory scores from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Statin use was defined by whether the study subject was taking a cholesterol lowering drug, including atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, lescol, mevacor, altocor, livalo, zocor, and crestor, at study enrollment.\n\nStatistical Analyses: Linear regression analyses were conducted with age, education, body mass index (BMI), APOE4 status (i.e. presence of at least one APOE4 allele versus no APOE4 allele), and statin use included as model covariates in addition to the interaction term of APOE4 status by statin use.\n\nResults: Statistically significant interactions were found between statin use and APOE4 status in relation to RAVLT total learning and RAVLT immediate memory. Among APOE4 carriers, statin use was associated with a 2-point drop in RAVLT total learning score and a 1-point drop in RAVLT immediate memory. Whereas, in the APOE4 non-carriers, statin use was associated with a 6-point increase in RAVLT total learning and a 1-point increase in RAVLT immediate memory.\n\nConclusions: Differential effects of statin use in women were found in relation to APOE4 status. Statin use in women APOE4 non-carriers was associated with better verbal learning and immediate memory performances whereas statin use in women APOE4 carriers was associated with worse performances on these same tasks. Our findings suggest that sex and APOE4 status are important factors in the consideration of statin use, and if replicated in a larger sample, would inform treatment guidelines for the statin drugs.\n\nKeywords: Statins, APOE4 Allele, Alzheimer's Disease\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW4. Functional Significance of Cortical Cholinergic Circuits in Cognitive Decline\n\nMala Ananth*, Nikhil Palekar, Christine DeLorenzo, David Talmage, Lorna Role\n\nNational Institutes of Health, Stony Brook, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (BFCNs) send extensive projections to the cortical mantle and many subcortical regions of the brain including the hippocampus and the amygdala. These highly branched axonal arbors may be metabolically challenging to maintain, perhaps underlying the vulnerability of cholinergic axons to fragmentation and loss in the aging brain. Indeed, studies of post-mortem brains from patients with severe AD find significant loss of cholinergic fibers compared to their age-matched, cognitively intact counterparts. One region that is known to be vulnerable early on in aging is the entorhinal cortex (EC), a cortical region that receives extensive input from BFCNs. Using the EC as a model of early cortical dysfunction, we investigated the relationship between altered cholinergic integrity and cortical function in aging.\n\nMethods: All studies were conducted in accordance with Stony Brook University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and Institutional Review Board (IRB). In order to investigate the cholinergic system in vivo in humans, we used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with ligand 18F-VAT, a presynaptic cholinergic protein that serves as a marker of cholinergic synapse health. In parallel studies in rodents, we used transgenic mouse models specifically designed to selectively target and visualize the cholinergic system. By crossing these mouse models to an aging model (mouse model that exhibits accelerated aging pathology including amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles) we were able to investigate changes to cholinergic projection profiles and function in this AD-like model. Using specific cognitive tasks that assay cortical function, we can stratify the data on cholinergic system integrity by performance on cognitive tasks.\n\nResults: First, to investigate the relationship between cholinergic system integrity and cortical function in aging in humans, we acquired PET scans in healthy participants and participants with cognitive impairment to visualize and quantify changes in the pattern and density of cholinergic innervation in health vs disease. Our preliminary findings show a decrease in 18F-VAT volume of distribution (VT) in the EC between healthy participants and patients. When we look across a continuum of cognitive score, we also find a significant correlation between cognitive performance and EC cholinergic terminal field density.\n\nTo understand the mechanism underlying altered VAT uptake, we used a rodent aging model that exhibits accelerated aging pathology. Confirming that the aging model mice have impaired performance on an EC-based memory task, we asked whether this was driven by alterations to cholinergic inputs to the EC. Our initial studies demonstrate dramatic fragmentation of cholinergic axonal fibers in EC. Further, we wondered how altered cholinergic input to the EC could change the circuit dynamics, and found elevated baseline firing rate in aging model mice, possibly due to an imbalance to the excitation-to-inhibition ratio. Ongoing studies are investigating the effects of altering endogenous acetylcholine levels using optogenetics and chemogenetics on firing rate and behavioral output.\n\nConclusions: The strength of these studies lies in our ability to apply high-resolution techniques in both rodents and humans to better understand the cholinergic system. Using related markers of cholinergic terminal fields, albeit with dissimilar techniques, has strengthened our view that the highly quantitative information gathered in rodents improves our interpretation of in vivo human imaging and allows us to make specific predictions about what altered VAT uptake can tell us about cognition and cognitive impairment.\n\nKeywords: PET Imaging, Acetylcholine, Aging and Dementia, Translational Neuroscience\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW5. Self-Reported Sleep Disturbances are Associated With Poorer Cognitive Performance in Older Adults With Hypertension: A Multi-Parameter Risk Factor Investigation\n\nJordan Kohn*, Emily Troyer, Robert N. Guay-Ross, Kathleen Wilson, Amanda Wilson, Chad Spoon, Christopher Pruitt, Meredith A. Pung, Milos Milic, Laura S. Redwine, Suzi Hong\n\nUniversity of California - San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States\n\nBackground: Sleep disturbances are associated with low-grade inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, both of which predict poorer cognitive outcomes in aging. Diminished physical mobility and elevated depressive symptomatology are also associated with poorer sleep and increased risk of cognitive decline in older adults. Given the evidence of multi-parameter risk factors in shaping cognitive outcomes, multi-dimensional investigations of how these factors impact cognition in older adults are warranted. In the present, we sought to determine the extent to which self-reported sleep disturbances, metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors, cellular inflammation, depressive symptomatology, and diminished physical mobility were associated with poorer cognitive performance in a cross-sectional cohort of older adults with elevated, though well-controlled, blood pressure.\n\nMethods: Hypertensive, community-dwelling older adults (N = 145, 72.7 ± 7.9 years old; 66% women; systolic BP = 133 ± 18 mmHg) without recent stroke, neurological impairment, inflammatory disorders, or major depression, were recruited for a larger behavioral intervention study. Demographic variables and medication use were recorded via standardized interview. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure were calculated from three consecutive seated measurements at 5 min intervals following 15 min seated rest. Timed Up and Go (TUG) was used to assess physical mobility. Unfasted lipids, glucose levels, and complete blood counts were assessed by commercial laboratory. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors, which include elevated waist circumference, serum glucose, blood pressure, and triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were quantified according to standard clinical thresholds. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and self-reported sleep disturbances using the Short Form Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-SD) Sleep Disturbance Scale. Cellular inflammation regulation was assessed by ex vivo monocyte tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response to 4-hr LPS stimulation, quantified as the percent difference in TNF+ monocytes between LPS-only and LPS+isoproterenol treatment. Cognition was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a threshold of 24/25 was used to differentiate impairment. Six domain-specific MoCA subscale scores were also calculated. Group comparisons were conducted using Chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Univariate correlations between risk factors and cognitive measures were computed using Spearman’s rho, and p-values adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg. Binomial logistic regression was implemented with a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure to determine odds ratios for each risk factor in predicting cognition group membership. Relationships between risk factors and cognitive domain scores were assessed using bootstrapped linear regression.\n\nResults: Of the 145 participants studied, fifty-four (37%) demonstrated evidence of cognitive impairment, and reported significantly greater sleep disturbances than normocognitive individuals (PROMIS-SD: 23.1 ± 0.62 vs. 21.0 ± 0.33; t = 3.01, p < 0.01). Lower MoCA total scores were significantly correlated with age (ρ = −0.23), TUG time (ρ = −0.29), and PROMIS-SD (ρ = −0.27) scores (all adjusted p < 0.05). PROMIS-SD scores were also negatively correlated with visuospatial (ρ = −0.30), executive function (ρ = −0.21), and language (ρ = −0.19) MoCA subdomain scores (all adjusted p < 0.05). In logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and native language, higher PROMIS-SD scores predicted a significantly increased risk of a low (≤24) MoCA total score [OR = 2.00 (1.26-4.87); p = 0.004]. MetS risk factor incidence [OR = 1.59 (0.98-3.12); p = 0.06] and anti-hypertensive medication usage [OR = 1.60 (0.97-3.36); p = 0.07] conferred somewhat greater risk of a low MoCA total score. In multiple linear regression analyses, higher PROMIS-SD scores were associated with significantly poorer scores on MoCA subdomains for executive function (βstd = −0.26 [−0.51 − 0.06], p = 0.005), visuospatial performance (βstd = −0.20 [−0.34 − 0.01], p = 0.04), and memory (βstd = −0.29 [−0.29 − 0.01], p = 0.048).\n\nConclusions: Our results indicate that the deleterious impact of self-reported sleep disturbances on cognitive performance was prominent over other important risk factors in an older hypertensive population, and illustrate the importance of clinician evaluation of sleep in patients with or at risk of diminished cognitive function. Although replication by comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is needed, certain cognitive domains, such as executive function, appear to be more affected by sleep disturbances. Future studies implementing more extensive neuropsychological testing and objective measurements of sleep quality are warranted to further explore these associations.\n\nKeywords: Aging, Cognition, Sleep Disturbance, Hypertension, Cardiometabolic Risk\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW6. JOTROL, a More Bioavailable Formulation of Resveratrol, Shows Potential in Targeting Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Pathology\n\nJessica Dennison*, Claude-Henry Volmar, Karolina Janczura, Natalie Ricciardi, Brittni Walker, Marshall A. Hayward, Shaun P. Brothers, Claes Wahlestedt\n\nUniversity of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, affecting 1 in 10 people over the age of 65. Pathological hallmarks of AD include accumulation of amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles resulting from the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neuroinflammation. To date, all clinical trials involving single target treatments for AD have failed. Recently, a randomized clinical trial with the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe by the FDA) compound Resveratrol (3,5,4’-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) has shown positive indications in AD patients (Turner et al., 2005; Moussa et al., 2017). Resveratrol, a polyphenol antioxidant found in plants such as red grapes, blueberries, and peanuts, has been reported to affect several AD-related and neuroprotective genes via activation of SIRT1. However, the high dose needed due to low bioavailability was reported to cause GI side effects. To address the low availability issue, JOTROL, a new oral formulation of resveratrol that shows significantly better pharmacokinetic properties than non-formulated resveratrol, was manufactured by Jupiter Orphan Therapeutics. We hypothesize that equimolar concentrations of JOTROL, compared to non-formulated resveratrol, will result in greater brain exposure to resveratrol, and more efficacious responses on AD biomarkers. Important, a reduction in dose regimen will likely result in reduced side effects.\n\nMethods: Three-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 3 per treatment group) were administered a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg JOTROL 30 minutes prior to being euthanized and brains harvested. 15-month-old male triple transgenic (APPSW/PS1M146V/TauP301L; 3xTg-AD) AD mice were treated by oral gavage daily with 50 mg/kg JOTROL (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5) for 36 days. Behavior effects were assessed using open field, novel object recognition, and Y-maze, after which mice were euthanized and organs extracted. All experiments were approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted according to specifications of the NIH as outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. RT-qPCR, ELISA and Western blot were performed to analyze inflammatory cytokine expression, enzyme activity and mitochondrial biogenesis. Unpaired Student’s t test was used for comparisons of two means. One-way ANOVA or repeated measures two-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc analyses were used for multiple comparisons. A P value < 0.05 was deemed to be of statistical significance.\n\nResults: Increased bioavailability of resveratrol was confirmed in both rats and mice after oral treatment with JOTROL. JOTROL resulted in 7-fold greater concentration in rat plasma than non-formulated resveratrol (p < 0.05), and a significant increase in resveratrol concentration in mouse brain. In rats, a single oral administration of 50 mg/kg JOTROL significantly increased SIRT1 and α-secretase ADAM10 gene expression in the brain of rats at 30 minutes (p < 0.0001), and significantly decreased Tau gene expression (p < 0.05). In 15-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, JOTROL treatment significantly increased both mitochondrial biogenesis (p < 0.05) and ADAM10 expression in the brain (p < 0.01). We also found increased mitochondrial biogenesis (p < 0.05) and reduced inflammation markers TNF-α and IL-6 in 3xTg-AD mice livers (p < 0.001). These data show that JOTROL can address several AD-relevant targets in aged transgenic mice, supporting a multipronged approach.\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that JOTROL may be beneficial for Alzheimer’s disease through increased expression and activation of neuroprotective genes and suppression of pro-inflammatory genes. We plan on investigating the ability of JOTROL to prevent AD-like pathogenesis in AD mouse models.\n\nKeywords: Alzheimer's Disease, Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease, Resveratrol, Natural Compound, Epigenetics\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW7. Radio-Pharmacologic Perturbation of Alzheimer's Disease Hallmarks\n\nNatalie Ricciardi*, Claude-Henry Volmar, Farzaneh Modarresi, Nadja Andrade, Ines Lohse, Karolina Janczura, Brian Marples, Claes Wahlestedt\n\nUniversity of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: There are currently no available methods to treat, attenuate, or reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the 6th leading cause of death in the United Sates. Traditional therapeutic approaches have mostly targeted the two main AD hallmarks, amyloid and tau pathologies, and have yielded disappointing results. We and others agree that a multifactorial approach is likely to better address the comorbidities present in AD. Previous work from our team has demonstrated that low dose (daily 2 Gy X 5 treatments) x-ray therapy of the brain of double transgenic AD mouse models over-expressing both the amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish and Presenilin 1 dE9 mutations (APP/PS1 mice) decreased plaque load, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and improved performance in the Morris water maze. In addition, we have shown that 3 months intraperitoneal (IP) administration of aged 3xTg-AD mice with the small molecule RGFP966, a selective HDAC3 inhibitor, reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in a brain region-specific and residue-specific manner, and improved performance in a battery of spatial and non-spatial learning and memory paradigms. We show here that low-dose combination therapy (LDCT) of x-radiation and HDAC3 inhibition has both additive and synergistic effects on modulating AD hallmarks.\n\nMethods: Preliminary investigations to study changes in gene expression, APP processing, and pathogenic tau post-translational modifications (PTMs) were performed using the HEKAPPSw cell line. This cell line overexpresses amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the Swedish familial mutation at the beta-secretase cleavage site causing over-production of Aβ peptides which allows us to robustly measure changes in APP processing. Primary microglia from post-natal day 6 C57BL/6 mice and the spontaneously immortalized SIM-A9 microglial cell line have been used to analyze the innate immune response and alterations in phagocytic capacity. Cells were treated with either 1 Gy of x-radiation, 3 μM RGFP966, or a combination of the two for 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. Control treatments included sham exposure in the irradiation cabinet and/or 0.03% DMSO. Additionally, a preliminary experiment was performed with 19 month-old C57/B6 male. The aged mice (N = 6 radiation, N = 6 sham) were dosed with 2% isoflurane (O2 flow-rate 2) for ~7 minutes while they received either whole brain x-radiation at a dose of 1 Gy twice per week or sham irradiation for 4 weeks. All experiments were approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted according to specifications of the NIH as outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence were performed to analyze inflammatory cytokine expression, protein expression, and phagocytosis. One-way ANOVA or repeated measures two-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc analyses were used for multiple comparisons. A P value < 0.05 was deemed to be of statistical significance.\n\nResults: Combined at low doses previously shown not to be efficacious, these two multifactorial treatments show synergistic increase in primary microglia phagocytosis of oligomeric Aβ42 (P < 0.05; N = 6) synergistic increase in neuroprotective sAPPα production (P < 0.05; N = 3) and BDNF gene expression (P < 0.0001, N = 6) and a synergistic decrease in phosphorylated tau at Ser202 (P < 0.05; N = 6). Additionally, combination therapy steers microglial innate immune memory toward a tolerant phenotype as measured by a reduced inflammatory response to Aβ stimulation 48h after LDCT treatment compared to control (P < 0.0001, N = 6). Lastly, 19-month old x-irradiated mice showcased no significant behavioral or motor deficits in open field, Y-maze, and sub-threshold object location and object recognition memory paradigms.\n\nConclusions: While many additional questions remain to be addressed (transcriptomic changes, analysis of blood-brain barrier permeability, cellular metabolism, complementary genetic silencing and overexpression of HDAC3) these striking preliminary results support our hypothesis that radio-pharmacologic perturbation of the genome and epigenome can improve and potentially reverse AD pathology in a synergistic manner. We will continue to explore other epigenetic compounds that are currently FDA approved (i.e. Vorinostat) to maximize the translational potential of this strategy and apply this approach to 9-month old male and female 3x-Tg AD mice.\n\nKeywords: Epigenetics, Alzheimers Disease, Neuroinflammation, Radiation, Low-Dose\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW8. Pilot Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study of Brain Metabolite Changes in Girls With PTSD After Treatment With Group Interpersonal Therapy\n\nAna Carolina Milani*, Chun Zuo, Adriana Correa, Bernd Uwe Foerster, Andrea Parolin Jackowski, Marcelo Feijó Mello, Marc J. Kaufman\n\nUNIFESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nBackground: In the US, more than 250,000 girls and women are subjected to sexual assault or rape each year. Existing data suggest that 40-50% of these individuals will develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition often associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Drug treatments for PTSD are inadequate in 40% of patients and only 20-30% of treated patients achieve full remission. Accordingly, we need a better understanding of the neurochemistry of PTSD to develop more effective treatments. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive imaging method that can be used to assess brain chemistry in vivo in humans. MRS has been used to quantify cerebral metabolites that may play important roles in the neurochemistry of PTSD, including glutamate. However, almost all prior MRS studies of PTSD published to date (32 of 33 by our count) used cross-sectional designs, which are unable to assess brain chemistry changes associated with treatment. Further, most studies used MRS methods that are suboptimal for quantifying glutamate. To overcome these prior limitations, this pilot study acquired multi-echo-time PRESS MRS scans (mTE) from girls with PTSD at baseline and after treatment with group interpersonal therapy (IPT) to study glutamate and other brain metabolite changes occurring over time.\n\nMethods: This study was conducted in five adolescent girls aged 16±1.3 (mean±SD) years old presenting with PTSD to the Brazilian Public Health Service at the Perola Byington Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Clinician-Administered PTSD scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) scores were obtained before and after treatment. Subjects underwent serial clinical assessments and brain mTE scans on a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva scanner with a 32-channel headcoil before and after 15 weeks of treatment with IPT. MRS scans were acquired from an 8 cm3 voxel (2 x 2 x 2 cm) positioned midline over the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus with TR=2000, TEs (24)=30,40,50,60,...,250,260ms, 2048 samples, Bandwidth=2kHz, averages=8, total scan time=8.8 min. Spectra at stepped TEs were summed prior to analysis with LCModel. A simulated metabolite basis set using the same stepped TEs was summed and used for metabolite quantification. The un-suppressed water signal from each voxel was used for eddy current correction and metabolite quantification.\n\nResults: Baseline CAPS-5 scores averaged (±SD) 52.6 ± 16.2 and CAPS-5 scores declined after IPT by ≥20 points in all 5 subjects, indicating meaningful clinical improvement in all subjects. Water-normalized glutamate levels also declined in all 5 subjects while water-normalized myo-inositol levels increased in all 5 subjects (Ps < 0.05, 2-tailed t-tests).\n\nConclusions: This pilot study suggests that clinically-meaningful CAPS-5 score declines following IPT treatment for PTSD may be associated with lower glutamate/water ratios and higher myo-inositol/water ratios. The glutamate effect could reflect normalization of a hyperglutamatergic state and the myo-inositol effect could reflect astroglial proliferation associated with enhanced neural plasticity. These pilot findings illustrate the potential value both of prospective MRS studies of PTSD and of the use of MRS pulse sequences capable of quantifying glutamate. These findings warrant future studies with larger sample sizes to more fully characterize brain glutamate and other metabolite changes associated with PTSD and its treatment, which may help advance development of novel treatments for PTSD.\n\nKeywords: 1H-MRS, Pediatric PTSD, Interpersonal Psychotherapy, Anterior Cingulate Gyrus, Brain MRI\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW9. Trick or Threat: Neural Circuits Balancing Reward-Seeking With the Risk of Predation\n\nFabricio Do Monte*, Douglas Engelke, Leah Olivo, Xu Zhang, John O’Malley, Jose Fernandez-Leon, Sa Li, Gilbert Kirouac, Michael Beierlein\n\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, United States\n\nBackground: Survival depends on a balance between approaching food and avoiding the risk of being attacked by a predator. However, which neuronal circuits integrate reward and fear information remains unknown. Neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) respond to both reward and fear-associated cues, making this region a potential candidate for this integration.\n\nMethods: To test this hypothesis, Long-Evans adult rats previously implanted with guide cannulas, optical fibers or electrodes targeting the PVT were initially trained to press a bar for sucrose in the presence of audiovisual cues (reward cues). Cat saliva was used to induce innate fear responses (predator odor). During a conflict test, predator odor and reward cues were simultaneously presented and rats needed to overcome their fear of predator cues to bar press for food.\n\nResults: We found that rats exposed to predator odor alone exhibited robust defensive behaviors (increased freezing and avoidance responses), compared to controls exposed to neutral odors. Predator odor exposure also increased the expression of the neural activity marker cFos in the medial amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and anterior portion of PVT (aPVT). Single-unit recordings from aPVT neurons revealed three distinct populations of neurons that changed their firing rate in response to predator odor, reward cues, or both, when compared to baseline (Z-score > 2.54 for excitatory and < -1.96 for inhibitory responses). aPVT responses to reward cues correlated with food-seeking behavior and were attenuated during predator odor exposure. Inactivation of aPVT with the GABAA agonist muscimol increased time approaching the food area and reduced time avoiding the predator odor area during the conflict test. Notably, inactivation of aPVT had no effect when the predator odor or the food-seeking tasks were carried out independently. In addition, chemogenetic inactivation of aPVT projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) reduced defensive responses and increased food seeking. Interestingly, predator odor exposure activated aPVT neurons expressing the stress neuropeptide corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF). Our neuroanatomical tracer study showed that aPVTCRF neurons send projections to VMH, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, and ventral hippocampus, with the NAc receiving the densest projection. Slice recordings from NAc neurons demonstrated that photoactivation of aPVTCRF fibers in the NAc elicited large excitatory postsynaptic responses, which were blocked by NMDA and AMPA/Kainate glutamate receptor antagonists. Thus, we speculated that aPVTCRF glutamatergic projections to NAc could play a role in food-seeking regulation. Consistent with our prediction, photoactivation of aPVTCRF fibers in the NAc reduced food-seeking and increased avoidance responses.\n\nConclusions: Taken together, all results suggest that activity in the aPVTCRF-NAc pathway regulates the balance between avoiding threats and searching for rewards.\n\nKeywords: Paraventricular Nucleus of the Thalamus, Nucleus Accumbens, Approach/Avoidance, Fear, Reward\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW10. Lower Translocator Protein (TSPO) Measured With PET in PTSD is Associated With Greater PTSD Severity and Peripheral Inflammation\n\nKelly Cosgrove*, Shivani Bhatt, Gustavo Angarita-Africano, Esterlis Irina, Ansel Hillmer, David Matuskey, Yiyun Huang, Richard Carson, John Krystal, Robert Pietrzak\n\nYale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: Preclinical and clinical studies of peripheral, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain transcription levels of immune markers indicate that innate immunity and inflammatory responses are dysregulated in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In particular, higher levels of peripheral immune markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha have been found in individuals with PTSD relative to controls and associated with greater severity of PTSD symptoms. In contrast, some studies have found lower peripheral immune markers in individuals with PTSD relative to controls, specifically TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma or no difference between groups in many of these markers. The goal of this study was to use positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging to investigate levels of prefrontal-limbic translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of microglia, in vivo in individuals with PTSD compared to controls, and determine how this neuro-immune system marker relates to peripheral immune markers and severity of PTSD symptoms.\n\nMethods: A total of 23 individuals with PTSD (13M, 10F) and 26 trauma-exposed and non-exposed otherwise healthy individuals (18M, 8F) were imaged. All subjects participated in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study and one [11C]PBR28 PET scan with arterial blood sampling to measure the metabolite-corrected parent input function. [11C]PBR28 binds to TSPO. PTSD diagnosis was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5. TSPO levels were quantified with [11C]PBR28 distribution volumes (VT) throughout the brain. There is a single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype, rs6971, which affects affinity of [11C]PBR28 for TSPO. Potential subjects were prescreened for a single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype, rs6971 which affects affinity of [11C]PBR28 for TSPO; individuals who were T/T homozygotes (low-affinity binders) were excluded and genotype was adjusted for in statistical analysis.\n\nResults: Prefrontal-limbic TSPO availability was significantly lower in the PTSD group compared to the control group. Specifically, analysis in primary regions of interest (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) revealed that [11C]PBR28 VT was significantly lower in the PTSD vs. control group (MANCOVA: F5,41 = 2.46, p = 0.05) with insula (F1,45 = 2.16, p = 0.04) and vmPFC (F1,45 = 2.36, p = 0.02) significant after correction for multiple testing. There were no significant differences in TSPO availability between the trauma-exposed and non-exposed healthy control groups. In the PTSD group, lower prefrontal-limbic TSPO availability was associated with lower IFN-gamma (beta = 0.86, n = 14, p = 0.04), and higher CRP (beta = −0.92, p = 0.03) levels, as well as with greater severity of PTSD symptoms (beta = −0.61, p = 0.02), particularly emotional numbing symptoms (beta = −0.47, p = 0.03).\n\nConclusions: Results of this study provide the first known in vivo evidence of neuroimmune dysregulation in PTSD. They further indicate that, in individuals with PTSD, greater suppression of neuroimmune function is associated with peripheral inflammatory markers and greater severity of PTSD symptoms. Collectively, these findings suggest that the neuroimmune system may be a promising target for novel treatment development in PTSD.\n\nFunding: This research was supported in part by National Institute of Health Grants R01MH110674 and the Clinical Neurosciences Division of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD.\n\nKeywords: PET Imaging, PTSD, Neuroimmune, Human Microglia, Brain\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW11. Androsterone and DHEAS are Inversely Associated With Pain Symptoms in Male Iraq/Afghanistan-Era Veterans\n\nSteven Szabo*, Jennifer Naylor, Jason Kilts, Ryan Wagner, Larry Shampine, Gillian Parke, Chris Marx\n\nDurham VA Medical Center/Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States\n\nBackground: Pain symptoms are common among Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans, and many experience persistent pain symptoms despite multiple pharmacological and behavioral interventions. Numerous pharmacological pain interventions are suboptimal in their efficacy and/or side effect profiles, and may have significant addictive potential. Safe and efficacious alternative treatment interventions are thus acutely needed. Emerging data suggest that neurosteroids may have biomarker and therapeutic utility for pain. Although the majority of findings have focused on allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, other neurosteroids may also be involved in the pathophysiology of pain. Identification of endogenous markers associated with pain conditions may lead to the development of new safe and efficacious pain treatments. The current study thus determined the association between serum neurosteroid level (androsterone, DHEA, and DHEAS) and pain symptoms in Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans.\n\nMethods: The current study quantified serum DHEA and DHEAS levels (by radioimmunoassay), and androsterone levels (by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) in a cohort of 484 male Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans. Pain symptoms were assessed by items from the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) querying headache, chest pain, muscle soreness, and low back pain over the past 7 days. Pain scores were dichotomized - participants reporting pain levels of 0 or 1 on an SCL-90-R pain item were designated to the “low pain” condition (i.e. “none” or “a little bit”), while participants endorsing pain levels of 2, 3, or 4 were designated to the “high pain” condition (i.e. “moderate” to “extreme” pain). Poisson regression procedures were conducted for each of the four SCL-90-R pain items and serum neurosteroid levels, controlling for age and smoking (variables previously reported to impact neurosteroid levels).\n\nResults: Associations between pain ratings and neurosteroid levels were examined with linear regression analyses, controlling for age and smoking. Bivariate non-parametric Mann-Whitney analyses examining neurosteroid levels across high and low levels of pain were also conducted. Serum androsterone levels were inversely correlated with chest pain (P=0.03), headache pain (P=0.01), and muscle soreness (P=0.001). Serum DHEAS levels were inversely associated with chest pain (P=0.0004), headache pain (P = 0.0001), and low back pain (P=0.008). There were no significant associations between median DHEA levels and any self-reported pain symptoms.\n\nConclusions: Androsterone, a positive GABA-A receptor modulator, was inversely associated with self-reported chest pain, headache pain, and muscle soreness in male Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans reporting moderate/extreme pain. This finding supports literature demonstrating the analgesic effects of GABAergic neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone. To our knowledge, this is the first report that androsterone, also a GABAergic neurosteroid with characteristics similar to allopregnanolone, is inversely associated with self-reported pain symptoms. Our findings additionally demonstrated that serum DHEAS levels were inversely associated with chest pain, headache pain, and low back pain, providing support for the potential analgesic effect of DHEAS. Together, these results demonstrate that neurosteroids may play a role in the pathophysiology of pain and may be promising biomarker candidates for pain conditions with the potential for therapeutic development. Future research in larger Veteran cohorts are needed to corroborate our findings that lower androsterone and DHEAS levels are correlated with higher levels of self-reported pain.\n\nKeywords: Androsterone, Dehydroepiandrosterone, Neuroactive Steroid, Neurosteroid, Pain\n\nDisclosure: Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Centers of Psychiatric Excellence, Continuous Precision Medicine, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Neurocrine Biosciences, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Consultant\n\nW12. Fear Memory Extinction is Facilitated After Systemic Antagonism of Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (NOP) Receptors: Relevance for Preclinical Models of Traumatic Stress\n\nRachel Taylor*, Isaac H. Jeong, Matthew D. May, Elizabeth M. Bergman, Nicole L.T. Moore, Liana M. Matson, Emily G. Lowery-Gionta\n\nWalter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are limited and clinical studies of new entities often lack efficacy. We have implemented preclinical rodent models of traumatic stress using predator exposure and adverse associative learning, which show similar behavioral impairments to those reported in the clinical literature. The nociceptin/orphanin FQ (NOP) receptor system is implicated in central-mediated processes underlying PTSD, with reported increased levels of nociceptin in cerebrospinal fluid in a rat model of PTSD (Zhang et al., 2012), suggesting targeting this receptor system may have therapeutic potential. The relationship between the NOP receptor and fear memory extinction in preclinical models has yet to be fully characterized, despite reports on other aspects of fear learning and memory (acquisition, consolidation, and reconsolidation) (Ouagazzal et al., 2015; Andero et al. 2015; Rekik et al., 2017).Here, we characterized the effects of NOP antagonism in a rodent model of traumatic stress as well as in fear memory extinction.\n\nMethods: We characterized NOP antagonists (J-113397, 2-20 mg/kg, i.p.; SB-612111, 0.1-4 mg/kg, i.p.) for acute and repeated administration effects in a behavioral test battery (measuring startle response, exploratory behavior, pain, and motor function) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. We also tested efficacy of these same NOP antagonists on behavioral performance recovery following a single-day protected exposure to predators (snake, ferrets, and cats). Finally, we tested the effect of NOP antagonism on fear memory extinction using SB-612111 (1-3 mg/kg, i.p., 1-h pre-treatment) in four, once-daily extinction tests beginning five days after fear conditioning (a single 35-min session of 20, 2-s 1 mA shock + light/tone stimuli pairings presented pseudorandomly).\n\nResults: The NOP antagonists J-113397 and SB-612111 did not significantly degrade baseline behavioral performance at any tested dose, nor significantly alter behavioral recovery following predator exposure. In these experiments, neither NOP antagonist had effects on locomotor behavior. In fear memory extinction tests, SB-612111 (1 and 3 mg/kg) significantly reduced freezing behavior as compared to a vehicle-treated group as early as the first extinction test (p < 0.01), and remained significantly different from the vehicle-treated group across test days (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusions: NOP antagonism facilitates fear memory extinction in rats, suggesting elevated levels of the peptide ligand or its downstream signaling mediators may promote exaggerated fear responses. These results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that NOP-targeted compounds modulate aspects of learning and memory. Despite the beneficial effects of NOP antagonism on fear learning, we observed minimal improvement in behavioral recovery following predator exposure. The present results suggest NOP antagonists may hold therapeutic potential for associative fear memory in patients with PTSD. Importantly, as preclinical fear memory extinction sessions can be likened to prolonged exposure therapy in the clinic, these results suggest NOP antagonism may be a potential therapeutic to use in conjunction with prolonged exposure therapy sessions.\n\nDisclaimer: Material has been reviewed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

A Computational Network Perspective on Pediatric Anxiety\n\nRany Abend*, Mira Bajaj, Daniel Coppersmith, Katharina Kircanski, Simone Haller, Elise Cardinale, Giovanni Salum, Reinout Wiers, Elske Salemink, Jeremy Pettit, Koraly Pérez-Edgar, Eli Lebowitz, Wendy Silverman, Yair Bar-Haim, Melissa Brotman, Ellen Leibenluft, Eiko Fried, Daniel Pine\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Current psychiatric taxonomy segregates pediatric anxiety symptoms into distinct diagnostic subtypes that are supported by behavioral observations and factor analyses. However, typical mixed symptom presentation poses significant challenges for diagnosis, treatment, and research.\n\nReconciling evidence for distinct domains and limited specificity, pediatric anxiety may alternatively be conceptualized as manifesting within a multivariate network of inter-connected domains in ways poorly captured by current classification systems. To evaluate this possibility, we utilize network analytic approaches to characterize pediatric anxiety as a network of symptom domains. Quantifying this network structure could inform our clinical conceptualization of pediatric anxiety, and, accordingly, clinical practice and research.\n\nMethods: Participants were 4,964 youths (ages 5-17 years) from seven international sites, presenting with a wide range of symptom severity (healthy, non-selected, high-risk, or clinically-anxious youth). Participants were assessed using the child-reported Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, a standard measure with strong psychometric properties for dimensionally assessing symptom severity along domains that follow pediatric anxiety DSM diagnostic categories: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder (SEP), social anxiety disorder (SOC), and panic disorder (PAN); additionally, school avoidance symptoms (SCH). We then applied computational network analytic tools to quantify the anxiety symptom network structure by estimating the magnitude of unique associations (edges) among symptom domains (nodes) using regularized partial correlations. Differences between networks were tested using permutation tests of network invariance.\n\nFirst, using the full sample, we examined the extent to which pediatric anxiety manifests as a network of inter-connected symptom domains. Second, we tested whether variation in network structure related to diagnostic status (patients vs. healthy controls). Third, we examined whether variation in network structure related to age (3-year longitudinal assessments) and sex, key moderators of pediatric anxiety expression.\n\nResults: Across analyses, anxiety networks were estimated with high accuracy. First, the full-sample anxiety network featured a highly inter-connected structure; all symptom domains were positively correlated but to varying degrees, with the strongest edges being GAD-PAN (r = .39) and GAD-SOC (r = .31), and the weakest edge being SOC-PAN (r = .04). Second, patients and healthy youth differed in symptom severity (ps < .001 in all domains) but demonstrated comparable network structure (p = .14). Third, network structure differed by sex (p = .038), with females showing stronger GAD-SCH association than males (p = .005). Furthermore, longitudinal data indicated structural changes during childhood (p = .019), with GAD-PAN association decreasing over time (p < .001). Across analyses, GAD and PAN symptoms consistently showed high centrality, indicating their importance within the symptom networks.\n\nConclusions: We show that pediatric anxiety does not typically manifest along one symptom domain; instead, it manifests along multiple, inter-connected domains, accounting for typical mixed symptom presentation. Using a large, heterogeneous sample, we quantify the nature of these inter-domain associations, as well as specific moderation effects by sex and age. These novel findings have important implications for the clinical conceptualization of pediatric anxiety. consequently, these insights could inform the diagnosis, treatment, and study of pediatric anxiety, as will be discussed in more detail in the poster.\n\nKeywords: Adolescent Anxiety, Network-Analysis, Classification, Sex Difference, Anxiety development\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW14. Efficacy of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-Assisted Psychotherapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\nAnees Bahji*, Ashleigh Forsyth, Dianne Groll, Emily Hawken\n\nQueen's University at Kingston, Kingston, Canada\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric condition that can develop following a traumatic experience. PTSD is associated with significant disability, a large economic burden, and despite the range of therapies to treat PTSD, response to antidepressants is limited. A growing body of clinical research suggests the efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in individuals with treatment-refractory PTSD.\n\nMethods: To assess the effectiveness and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reducing symptoms of PTSD, a systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Six online databases were searched from inception to December 2018. Reference lists of relevant articles were manually searched as well as electronic sources of ongoing trials and conference proceedings. Researchers active in the subject were also contacted. Eligible studies included randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials using MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care). We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Two authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Using random-effects meta-analysis with Cochrane’s Review Manager 5.3, we obtained standardized mean differences [SMD] and rate ratios [RR] for reduction in PTSD symptomatology.\n\nResults: A total of 5 trials met inclusion criteria, totaling 106 participants (average age: 35-40 years, 70% female). Studies were rated as moderate in quality. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy demonstrated a high rate of clinical response (RR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.70, 7.06), remission (RR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.37, 5.02), with a large effect size at reducing the symptoms of PTSD (SMD = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.94). Available evidence indicates that MDMA was well-tolerated, with few serious adverse events reported across studies.\n\nConclusions: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy appears to be a potentially safe, effective, and durable treatment for individuals with chronic, treatment-refractory PTSD. However, future studies involving larger samples and longer durations of treatment and follow-up are warranted—and underway.\n\nKeywords: Psychotherapy, Anxiety & PTSD, MDMA, Meta-Analysis\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW15. Prefrontal Noradrenergic and Cholinergic Dynamics Define Global Arousal After Stress\n\nAlfred Kaye*, Jianna Cressy, Manasa Rao, Yulong Li, Jiesi Feng, Alex Kwan\n\nYale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: Across the cerebral cortex, neurons increase their firing when the pupil dilates, reflecting neuromodulatory control of arousal. By recording only the pupil, the global arousal state of neurons throughout the cortex can be inferred. Pupil diameter is believed to relate to noradrenergic state; despite multiple studies relating neuronal spiking activity to pupillary diameter, measurements of neurochemical fluctuations in norepinephrine have been limited by available techniques. Precisely defining the neurochemical basis of dynamic changes in arousal may offer insight into the mechanisms of arousal dynamics and how they are altered by emotional states. We combine measurements of new optical neurotransmitter biosensors with in vivo calcium imaging and pupillary recordings to better define how arousal is altered by stress.\n\nMethods: Mice (sample size n=7-10 in two groups, stress and control) are used in this study with a common experimental design: day 1 - pupillary recordings, day 2 - stress (Stress-Enhanced Fear Learning) or control, day 3 - pupillary recordings post-stress. Four cohorts of animals were used: 1) no brain imaging, 2) in vivo calcium imaging of mPFC neurons (n=458 stressed, n=372 unstressed neurons), 3) in vivo norepinephrine fluorescent sensor imaging (GRAB-NE2h), and 4) in vivo acetylcholine sensor imaging (GRAB-Ach4.3). Simultaneous pupil and imaging datasets were analyzed with spectral analysis, event-triggered analysis of neural response to pupil dilation/constriction events, and a Hidden Markov Model of this time series data. Mice used were male 8-12 week old C57Bl6 mice.\n\nResults: Acetylcholine shows higher correlation to pupillary diameter than norepinephrine (r = 0.64 vs 0.36 p < 0.01). Acetylcholine shows greater coherence with the pupil at infra-slow (<0.2 Hz) whereas norepinephrine shows greater coherence with the pupil at slow (0.3 - 0.5 Hz) frequencies. Stress alters the Ach-NE balance by increasing infra-slow acetylcholine-pupil coupling and decreasing infra-slow norepinephrine-pupil coupling. Acetylcholine and norepinephrine dynamics differ in timing to pupillary events, with norepinephrine lagging acetylcholine by 2 seconds (p < 0.05).\n\nAcute traumatic stress causes more rapid transitions between pupillary arousal states (p < 0.05). These rapid transitions in the pupil reflect shifts in cortical arousal. Population (average) mPFC activity is highly correlated to the pupil (r2 = 0.56), but the neuron-pupil correlation is reduced by stress (p < 0.001). mPFC neuron-pupil coupling is particularly reduced at low frequencies (<0.5 Hz) after stress (p < 0.05). mPFC neuronal activity state transitions occur 0.5 seconds before pupillary state transitions, but this relationship is disrupted after stress.\n\nConclusions: Acetylcholine and norepinephrine dynamics suggest that these neuromodulators function to structure arousal at different timescales. The balance of acetylcholine and norepinephrine is not constant but is plastic, and varies with emotional state. Prefrontal cholinergic dynamics are more reflective of arousal state after stress. Arousal dynamics change after stress, which is reflected in desynchronization of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. Coordinated state-switching between pupil and mPFC neuronal activity is also disrupted after stress. These results extend our previous understanding of stress in modulating arousal states and have implications for the conceptualization of disorders involving stress-induced hyperarousal, such as PTSD.\n\nKeywords: Arousal, Acetylcholine, Norepinephrine, Systems Neuroscience, Optical Biosensors\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW16. Common and Dissociable Effects of Oxytocin and Lorazepam on the Neurocircuitry of Fear\n\nAnn-Kathrin Kreuder, Dirk Scheele, Johannes Schultz, Juergen Hennig, Nina Marsh, Torge Dellert, Ulrich Ettinger, Alexandra Philipsen, Mari Babasiz, Angela Herscheid, Laura Remmersmann, Ruediger Stirnberg, Tony Stöcker, Rene Hurlemann*\n\nUniversity of Oldenburg Medical Campus, Bad Zwischenahn, Germany\n\nBackground: Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (LZP), which target the GABAA receptor system, represent the gold standard of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy; however, their clinical benefit is limited by side effects and addictive potential. Thus, from a clinical perspective, there is an urgent need for developing novel and safe anxiolytics. Notwithstanding an ever-growing insight into the neurocircuitry mechanisms regulating fear, with current concepts emphasizing a key role of the functional organization within the amygdala complex, a guided detection of candidate compounds along their ability to strengthen these inhibitory mechanisms is missing. An emerging target is the oxytocin (OXT) receptor system, given converging evidence of anxiolytic-like properties of OXT in animals and humans. Thus, despite acting via different neurotransmitter pathways, OXT and benzodiazepines may share similar effects on the neurocircuitry of fear. Therefore, the rationale of this ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to map and compare OXT and LZP effects on local and network responses to fear-related stimuli.\n\nMethods: One hundred and twenty-eight healthy male participants volunteered in this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Prior to scanning using a well-established emotional face matching paradigm, participants were administered a single dose of OXT (24 IU), LZP (1 mg) or placebo.\n\nResults: On the behavioral level, LZP caused mild sedation evident in a 19% increase in reaction times. On the neural level, both OXT and LZP inhibited responses to fearful versus neutral faces within the centromedial amygdala (cmA), but showed different effects on intra-amygdalar connectivity. OXT strengthened the coupling between the cmA and basolateral amygdala whereas LZP increased the interplay between the cmA and superficial amygdala. Furthermore, OXT, but not LZP, enhanced the coupling between the cmA and precuneus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.\n\nConclusions: Our data provide first insights into the intra-amygdalar mechanisms of OXT and LZP in humans, thereby facilitating the development of individually adjusted treatment protocols based on the distinct anxiolytic mechanisms of both compounds. Collectively, OXT and LZP dampened responses to fear-related stimuli in the cmA as a common denominator of anxiolytic action, with only OXT inducing large-scale connectivity changes of potential therapeutic relevance.\n\nKeywords: 7T fMRI, Amygdala, Anxiolytics, Oxytocin, Benzodiazepine\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW17. Effects of SRX246, a Vasopressin Receptor (V1a) Antagonist, on an Experimental Model of Phasic and Sustained Threat in Humans\n\nTiffany Lago*, Michael Brownstein, Emily Beydler, Adrienne Manbeck, Alexis Beale, Neal Simon, Christian Grillon, Monique Ernst\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide that modulates both physiological (i.e., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and emotional (i.e., anxiety) responses to threat (Hernández-Pérez et al., 2018). AVP receptors, such as V1a, are heavily expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala (Dannenhoffer et al., 2018), both of which are regions implicated in anxiety (Davis et al., 2010). Until recently, drugs that target vasopressin receptors in the central nervous system were unavailable, leaving limited psychopharmacological treatments for disorders where dysregulation of AVP function may be an underlying neurobiological mechanism, such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders (Rotondo et al., 2016). The development of a novel arginine vasopressin receptor inhibitor, SRX246, by Azevan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now permits the experimental validation of AVP’s role in the regulation of anxiety in humans. This study examined the effects of SRX246 on a translational behavioral paradigm of phasic and sustained aversive states in healthy humans.\n\nMethods: The study used a double-blind, cross-over design. Each healthy volunteer (n = 32, 15M, 17F) received two treatments, placebo (PLC) and 300 mg (180 mg every morning, 120 mg every evening) of SRX246 (SRX), in a counter-balanced order, for 10-14 doses over 5-7 days. The wash-out period was 5-7 days between treatments. The “NPU” threat test was used to probe phasic and sustained threat responses. Threat was induced using mild electrical shocks. The NPU test consists of 3 conditions: Neutral, Predictable, and Unpredictable. During Neutral, participants are safe from shock. During Predictable, a geometric shape (Cue) indicates risk for shock, while the absence of the shape, i.e., No-Cue, indicates safety. During Unpredictable, participants are at risk for shock at any time. Online subjective anxiety ratings and startle amplitudes were converted to t-scores. Measures were analyzed using 3-way ANOVAs, with Drug (SRX, PLC), Condition (Neutral, Predictable, Unpredictable), and Stimulus (Cue, No-Cue) as within-subject factors. Post-hoc analyses included a 2-way ANOVA with Drug (SRX, PLC) and subjective anxiety rating quartiles across treatments.\n\nResults: Regarding Drug effects, SRX had, at a trend level, a main effect on online subjective anxiety ratings (F(1,31)=3.00, p = .09). Anxiety tended to be lower in SRX compared to PLC sessions. To better understand this relationship, additional analyses were conducted after separating participants into 4 groups based on their level of anxiety (Very High, High, Moderate, Low) across all sessions. These exploratory analyses revealed a Drug x Group interaction (F(3,28)=3.79, p < .05). Participants in the Very High group reported lower anxiety with SRX compared to PLC (t(7) = −2.90, p < .05), while those in the other 3 groups reported similar anxiety levels in the SRX and PLC sessions. Inspection of the data also suggests that during SRX, anxiety was lower in the Very High anxiety than the other 3 groups. Drug had no statistical effect on startle. Other findings, not related to Drug effects, validated the task manipulations (Condition, Stimulus). Condition x Stimulus interaction was statistically significant (F(2,62)=31.70, p < .001), indicating higher anxiety ratings during Cue than No-Cue during the Predictable (t(31)=5.87, p < .001), but not Neutral or Unpredictable, condition. Condition and Stimulus had each a significant main effect (Condition: Unpredictable > Predictable > Neutral; F(2, 62)=101.24, p < .001; Stimulus: Cue > No-Cue; t(31) = −1.81, p < .001). Startle analyses also evidenced a Condition x Stimulus interaction (F(2,62)=14.78, p < .001), with the largest increase in startle from No-Cue to Cue during Predictable. Unpredictable had a larger increase from No-Cue to Cue than Neutral at a trend level (t(31)=1.97, p = .06). Here again, significant main effects were statistically significant for Condition (Predictable = Unpredictable > Neutral; F(2, 62)=30.54, p < .001) and Stimulus (Cue > No-Cue; t(31) = −8.23, p < .001).\n\nConclusions: Findings reveal that SRX246, a V1a receptor antagonist, reduces online subjective anxiety in individuals with the highest level of anxiety across all sessions. SRX246 did not modulate physiological (startle) responses to phasic or sustained threat differently than placebo. These data strongly support extending this work to anxiety patients.\n\nKeywords: Vasopressin 1a Receptor Antagonist, Startle, Anxiety & PTSD, Phase II Clinical Trial, Threat of Shock\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW18.

Sex Differences in Lipid Metabolism in PTSD\n\nSabra Inslicht*, Callan Lujan, Sarah Wagner, Sili Fan, Oliver Fiehn, Thomas Neylan, Aditi Bhargava\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States\n\nBackground: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased rates of hyperlipidemia and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). Compared to men, women are at increased risk of PTSD, yet have decreased risk of CVD at ages pre-menopause. However, since the sex difference in CVD risk diminishes with increasing age, it has been hypothesized that the decline in sex hormones associated with ovarian aging may account for loss of protection from CVD risk factors in older women. While the primary functions of ovarian hormones are to control fertility and reproduction, estrogen, progesterone and their metabolites also provide protection from cardiometabolic risks, including ischemic damage, high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride profiles, waist circumference, glucose levels, and hypertensive status. Glucose and lipid dysregulation have been found during the menopause-related decline in estrogen. Testosterone, the primary reproductive male reproductive hormone promotes reproductive tissue development and secondary sexual characteristics in males, is also decreased as a result of stress and aging, and has been associated with diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, low-density lipoprotein, inflammation, and incidence of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and CVD events. Whether sex steroids confer protection from elevated lipids in individuals with PTSD is unknown. This study examined the effect of sex and PTSD on plasma lipid metabolites and the role of sex steroids in this relationship. We predicted higher lipid levels in PTSD vs. controls and in males compared to females. We also predicted that lipid levels would be inversely related to sex steroids.\n\nMethods: Metabolomic analyses were performed on plasma samples obtained from fasting male and pre-menopausal follicular phase female subjects with chronic PTSD (N = 44) and trauma-exposed, age-matched controls (N = 44). Participants were between the ages of 20 and 50, primarily civilians (89%), healthy, free of medications, alcohol and drugs, and limited to one cup of caffeine daily. Plasma samples were assayed for lipid and steroid metabolites using Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 6220 TOF) coupled with an Ultra HPLC. Lipid and sex hormone metabolites were tested for sex and PTSD effects using ANOVA with FDR correction. Chemical Set Enrichment (ChemRICH) analysis, a technique that utilizes structure similarity and chemical ontologies to map was used to visualize metabolite clusters that differed by PTSD status and sex. Lipid metabolites that were differentially expressed in PTSD vs controls were treated as outcomes in logistic regression models with sex steroids entered as mediators in males and females separately.\n\nResults: Sex differences were found in 67 lipid metabolites. In comparing PTSD vs controls, 217 lipid metabolites were altered (mostly upregulated) in PTSD. The majority of lipid alterations in PTSD occurred in men, but not in women (138 vs 42 lipid metabolites). ChemRICH analyses indicated that PTSD was associated with alterations in 8 out of 11 lipid clusters in men, but only 4 in women. In the steroid panel, testosterone glucuronide, a downstream metabolite of testosterone, was decreased in both men and women with PTSD compared to controls (p's < .05). The testosterone metabolites, dihydrotestosterone and etiocholanolone, were elevated in PTSD in both sexes (p's < .05). Testosterone glucuronide accounted for alterations in lipid metabolites in women only. There were no associations of PTSD with estrogens.\n\nConclusions: A metabolomics approach was used to identify lipid and sex steroid metabolite alterations in PTSD in men and women. Complementing previous findings of hyperlipidemia in men and in PTSD, this study further identified sex differences in lipid alterations in PTSD. Metabolites in the testosterone pathway accounted for alterations in lipid alterations in women in particular. There were no associations of PTSD with estrogens, which were expected to be protective. However, conclusions about the role of female sex steroids were limited by the single timepoint blood draw that occurred during the early follicular phase, when estrogen and progesterone are low. Longitudinal assessment over the menstrual cycle would be important to evaluate the role of sex steroids on lipid metabolism in naturally cycling women with PTSD and in older individuals to examine effects of aging. These findings suggest that the testosterone-related compounds may account for sex differences in lipid profiles, potentially leading to differential health risks in PTSD.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, Dyslipidemia, Sex Steroids, Metabolomics\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW20. Neural Circuits Underlying Individual Variability in Avoidance Behavior\n\nElizabeth Cogan, Christina Catavero, Shivaani Mahendar, Zoe McElligott*\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States\n\nBackground: One goal of modern systems neuroscience is to better understand the circuits that regulate distinct behaviors. Approach and avoidance behaviors are of particular interest, as they are useful constructs for the study of motivation and anxiety. It is well known that individual mice can exhibit large differences in avoidance behavior, and that stress experience may further drive divergence in these behaviors. Here we have leveraged this individual variability with an unbiased whole brain anatomical analysis to identify novel circuits that regulate avoidance like behavior.\n\nMethods: Mice – We performed all experiments in male and female DBH::Cre x L10a-GFP mice that were at least 10 weeks of age at the beginning of the experiment. Mice were singly housed, and had food and water ad libitum during the experiment.\n\nNovelty induced hypophasia (NIH) paradigm – As per Bluett et al., Nature Communications, 2017, we expose mice to Vanilla Ensure (VE) in the home cage for 4 days. On day 5, mice are placed in a novel open cage with distinct bedding, VE and a bright light for 30 min. Their latency to drink from the bottle containing the VE, and the total amount consumed is recorded, as a measure of baseline avoidance behavior. Days 6-9 mice area allowed to rest in the home cage. Days 10-11 mice are re-exposed to the VE in the homecage. Day 11 mice received highly aversive stimuli (7 inescapable foot shocks). Day 12 mice are placed in a new novel open cage without bedding, with VE and a bright light. Their latency to drink from the bottle containing the VE, and the total amount consumed is recorded. An avoidance index is made of the latency to drink from the VE bottle in the novel environments on Day 12-Day 5.\n\niDISCO – Brains were cleared and stained for cFos expression using the iDISCO protocol (https://idisco.info/idisco-protocol/).\n\nLight sheet microscopy -- Images were collected using the Lavision Ultramicroscope II light-sheet system and processed using CLEARMAP analysis package.\n\nApproach/avoidance generalization - Marble burying, the elevated plus maze and light-dark box were used to explore if changes in avoidance behavior determined through the NIH assay generalized across other assays. We performed all behavioral assays during the dark cycle.\n\nResults: We found that male and female mice showed a high degree of variability in their avoidance behaviors in the NIH assay following exposure to a highly aversive stimuli (shock). This variability generalized to significant differences across multiple assays of approach/avoidance behavior, suggesting this is a stable response strategy. Furthermore, in our preliminary study we found that male animals who had high levels of avoidance behavior (n=2) showed enhanced activation of multiple limbic and subcortical regions comparison to low avoidance counterparts (n=3). In contrast, the mice with higher levels of avoidance behavior had reduced activation prefrontal cortical regions.\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that both limbic and cortical regions are differentially engaged by stress in mice with variable avoidance behavior.\n\nKeywords: Stress and Anxiety Behavior, Avoidance, Whole-Brain Rodent Imaging\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW21. Meta-Analysis Identifies a Robust Association Between Anxiety Disorders and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)\n\nDorothy Grice*, Behrang Mahjani, Lotta Renström Koskela, Anita Batuure, Christina Mahjani, Magdalena Janecka, Christina M. Hultman, Avi Reichenberg, Joseph D. Buxbaum, Olaf Akre\n\nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including symptoms such as urinary frequency, pressure, urgency, pain when the bladder fills, and syndromes such overactive bladder (OAB), interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS), are commonly reported by patients with anxiety symptoms. In addition, studies in individuals with LUTS have shown that these individuals are more likely to also have anxiety-related disorders. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationship between LUTS and anxiety disorders.\n\nMethods: We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria to conduct a systematic data collection and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, and included all articles referencing at least one relevant anxiety-related diagnosis (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder) and at least one diagnosis related to LUTS (e.g., OAB, IC/BPS). We performed random-effect meta-analyses for anxiety-related disorders with pooled outcomes for LUTS.\n\nResults: We identified 814 relevant articles. After detailed review, 94 articles were chosen for the systematic review of anxiety-related disorders, of which 23 had sufficient data for meta-analysis. The odds ratio for anxiety-related disorders among cases with LUTS was 2.94 (95% CI: 2.40,3.60, P < 0.001). When we excluded PTSD from the anxiety group, the odds ratio for the association between anxiety-related disorders and LUTS was 3.10 (95% CI: 2.47,3.89, P < 0.001). The odds ratio for LUTS among individuals with anxiety-related disorders was 2.76 (95% CI: 1.43,5.34, P < 0.001), consistent with a bidirectional relationship between anxiety-related disorders and LUTS.\n\nConclusions: The results demonstrate reliable associations between anxiety disorders and LUTS. We did not see evidence for sex differences in this association, although the number of included articles was small. This association appears to be bidirectional and clinically significant. There were very limited data exploring the relationship between LUTS and anxiety-related disorders in youth, which should motivate further study in this area.\n\nKeywords: Anxiety Disorders, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW22. Functional MRI Guided Targeting With Interleaved TMS/fMRI Readouts of Evoked Amygdala Responses\n\nDesmond Oathes*, Romain Duprat, Morgan Scully, Hannah Long, Nicholas Balderston, Gabriela Bagdon, Joseph Deluisi, Monica Lyu, Yvette Sheline\n\nPerelman School of Medicine University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: The amygdala is implicated in a variety of affective pathologies and is the focus of research on fear learning in non-human animals. Therefore, a method to non-invasively influence amygdala activity could be a highly valued tool in generating novel neuromodulatory interventions. A pilot TMS/fMRI study (n=14) in our lab suggested that the amygdala could be influenced by fMRI guided TMS and that the direction of fMRI BOLD response in the amygdala evoked by TMS depends on the cortical region where TMS is applied. Focusing on cortical targets that evoked a negative BOLD response in the amygdala (the putatively clinically useful direction), we sought to replicate the pilot results in a larger sample and focused on the most promising cortical zone.\n\nMethods: In a healthy cohort (n=32), we used resting fMRI seeding the basolateral amygdala to find superficial cortical targets with high resting connectivity in the vicinity of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The vlPFC hot spot for each participant varied but was identifiable in each individual FC map. We then applied 71 total single TMS pulses (120% motor threshold) with interleaved fMRI recordings to examine whether an amygdala response could be evoked. Using an identical stimulation and fMRI protocol (TR=2400ms including a 400ms gap in which TMS was applied), we also stimulated the hand knob of the primary motor cortex as a control site.\n\nResults: Using a generalized estimating equation to account for within-subject correlations and including age, education, and stimulation intensity covariates, we found a negative BOLD response in the amygdala that was significantly different from the control site, Wald Chi-Sq=4.92, p = 0.027.\n\nConclusions: This replication extends our pilot work and supports a conclusion that individual fMRI guided TMS can effectively modulate the amygdala non-invasively. We are collecting data on a behavioral study to examine neuromodulation effects through this pathway as well as interleaved TMS/fMRI data in a depressed/anxious patient cohort.\n\nKeywords: Interleaved TMS/fMRI, Amygdala, PFC, Anxiety & PTSD\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW23. HIV Interacts With Childhood Trauma Exposure to Impact PTSD Symptom Severity and Psychophysiological Hyperarousal in African American Women\n\nVasiliki Michopoulos*, Rebecca Hinrichs, Sierra Carter, Igho Ofotokun, Tanja Jovanovic, Gretchen Neigh\n\nEmory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States\n\nBackground: Many people living with HIV (PLWH) experience high rates of childhood trauma exposure, which is a significant risk factor for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). African Americans living in poverty and urban environments tend to be exposed to high levels of trauma, suffer from chronic PTSD, and are at increased risk for HIV infection. It is important to understand how HIV infection interacts with childhood trauma exposure to influence the presentation and psychophysiology of PTSD. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge surrounding how HIV status influences the presentation of PTSD may limit the generalizability of behavioral and pharmacological treatment strategies for PLWH and PTSD. Therefore, the overall goal of the current study was to characterize the extent to which HIV interacts with childhood trauma exposure to influence PTSD symptoms and psychophysiological hyperarousal in traumatized, African American women.\n\nMethods: All participants (n = 89, 29 without HIV, 60 PLWH) were African American women between the ages of 18 and 65 years who were recruited from the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) in Atlanta, GA and provided informed consent. All subjects participated in a clinical interview conducted by a trained clinician on all psychological assessment instruments. Lifetime trauma history was determined by the 14-item Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI), which assesses for experiencing and witnessing traumatic events. Childhood trauma history was assessed via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was used to determine the current PTSD symptoms severity based on DSM-5 criteria. Psychophysiological hyperarousal was assessed by measuring skin conductance level (SCL) at baseline and during the trauma assessment portion of the CAPS using a mobile eSense SCL App for iPad. Usable SCL data was available from 27 participants (6 without HIV, 21 PLWH). ANOVAs controlling for income and HIV viral load (quantified by PCR) were used to assess the effects of HIV status, childhood trauma exposure and their interaction on PTSD symptom severity and psychophysiological hyperarousal (baseline, response to trauma reminder, and habituation over time).\n\nResults: Rates of adult and childhood trauma exposure were not significantly different between PLWH and those without HIV (p’s>0.05). Similarly, sociodemographic variables were not different based on HIV status, including age, education and employment (p’s>0.05). Income level was however significantly greater in PLWH in the current study (p = 0.02). PTSD symptom severity as determined on the CAPS was influenced by a HIV status by childhood trauma interaction (p = 0.05). In women without HIV, higher childhood trauma exposure was significantly associated with greater PTSD symptom severity compared to HIV- women that experienced low levels of childhood trauma (p = 0.001). Similarly, high levels of childhood trauma exposure in PLWH were associated with greater PTSD symptom severity as compared to PLWH who experienced low levels of childhood trauma (p = 0.07). HIV was associated with greater PTSD symptoms severity only in women with low levels of childhood trauma exposure (p = 0.06). There was no impact of HIV status on PTSD symptom severity in women exposed to high childhood trauma (p = 0.46). Similar analyses yielded significant interactions of a HIV status by childhood trauma exposure on baseline psychophysiological arousal (p = 0.05) and psychophysiological reactivity to trauma reminders (p = 0.015). Higher childhood trauma exposure in HIV negative women was significantly associated with greater baseline SCL compared to HIV negative women with low levels of childhood trauma exposure (p = 0.05). There was no effect of childhood trauma exposure on baseline SCL in PLWH (p = 0.69). HIV was associated with lower baseline SCL only in women with high levels of childhood trauma exposure (p = 0.08). In women exposed to low levels of childhood trauma, psychophysiological response to trauma reminders was significantly lower in PLWH compared to women without HIV (p = 0.06). In women exposed to high levels of childhood trauma, HIV was associated with augmented psychophysiological reactivity to trauma reminders (p = 0.06).\n\nConclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that HIV impacts PTSD symptom severity and psychophysiological hyperarousal in African American women in a manner that is dependent on levels of childhood trauma exposure. Given that HIV status impacts PTSD symptoms and baseline and trauma reminder-induced SCL, the current data may have high clinical significance for treating PTSD in PLWH. Ongoing analyses are being performed to directly assess the effects of HIV on fear acquisition, discrimination, and extinction.\n\nKeywords: HIV, PTSD, Childhood Trauma, Women, Psychophysiology\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW24. A Computational, Approach-Avoidance Framework for Predicting Behavioral Therapy Response for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder\n\nRobin Aupperle*, Ryan Smith, Namik Kirlic, Tim McDermott, Elisabeth Akeman, Jessica Santiago, Ashley Clausen, Christopher Martell, Kate Wolitzky-Taylor, James Abelson, Michelle Craske, Jerzy Bodurka, Martin Paulus\n\nLaureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States\n\nBackground: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders, with a 6% lifetime prevalence rate. Although there is significant symptom overlap with major depressive disorder (MDD), a comorbid GAD diagnosis conveys a much poorer prognosis. While cognitive behavioral therapy for GAD is superior to placebo, only 40-60% experience significant improvement. Understanding neurocognitive processes contributing to treatment response could help identify patients likely to be refractory and develop individualized treatment approaches. Given that GAD treatments typically focus on decreasing cognitive and behavioral avoidance and/or to manage internal rumination about potential threat/reward consequences, the ability to successfully arbitrate conflict (make decisions to approach or avoid) could theoretically contribute to propensity for treatment response. Computational approaches utilize mathematical models to precisely and quantitatively represent complex systems and examine the factors contributing to human behavior. Here, we present preliminary results from a study examining whether computational parameters and/or neural activation during approach-avoidance conflict decision-making predicts response to two different behavior therapy approaches for GAD.\n\nMethods: A preliminary cohort of 48 individuals with GAD (41 female; age M = 35.69; 18 with current and 40 with lifetime MDD) have completed an approach avoidance conflict (AAC) task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this task, individuals have to make “approach” or “avoid” decisions when faced with both “punishment” and reward outcomes (exposure to negatively-valenced images/sounds and 2, 4, or 6 cents earning per trial). After baseline assessment, participants were randomized to complete 10 weeks of either behavioral activation (BA) or exposure-based therapy (EBT), conducted in a group setting. Primary symptom outcome was GAD-7 score. Percent signal change (PSC) for a priori bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), amygdala, and striatum regions of interest were extracted for trials in which participants were faced with approach-avoidance conflict decisions. An active inference computational model was used to identify parameters related to the influence of the potential negative image, the potential points, conflict (ratio between these two), and policy precision. Linear regression analyses were conducted in R statistical package with PSC or computational parameters and treatment condition as predictors, post-treatment GAD-7 as outcome, and pre-treatment GAD-7, gender, and age as covariates.\n\nResults: Preliminary analyses indicate that GAD-7 scores declined with treatment, in both treatment groups, with approximately 47% of individuals exhibiting a 50% score reduction. Baseline GAD-7 score related to bilateral amygdala activation during approach-avoidance conflict (Right: t(44)=3.08, p = .004, η2 = 0.17; Left: t(44) = 2.87, p = .007, η2 = 0.15) and greater conflict as estimated within the active inference model (t(44) = 2.03, p = 0.048, η2 = 0.08). Baseline conflict activation within bilateral dlPFC related not only to self-reported difficulty making decisions on the task (Right: rs = 0.30, p = 0.043; Left: rs = 0.34, p = 0.021), but also differentially predicted treatment outcomes for BA versus EBT (Right: t(40) = 3.36, p = 0.002, (η2 = 0.17; Left: t(40) = 1.167, p = 0.007, η2 = 0.13), with greater activation predicting worse outcomes for EBT but better outcomes for BA. Less policy precision as estimated within the active inference model related to better treatment response for depression symptoms across both treatment modalities (t(40) = −3.08, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.11).\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that amygdala activation and greater conflict between approach and avoidance drives is linked to GAD symptoms. However, different factors may be important in predicting outcomes to behavioral therapy. Less precision in one’s model (i.e., greater uncertainty or variability in response patterns) may indicate malleability in terms of updating one’s internal model with therapy. Additionally, activation within the dlPFC, considered important for decision-making and action selection, predicted how individuals responded to the different types of treatment. Increased dlPFC activation during approach-avoidance conflict may relate to greater neurocognitive effort or increased internal model complexity contributing to approach-avoidance behavior. Behavioral activation, by focusing on rewarding outcomes, may in some ways take threat out of the equation, thus relying less on explicit, conflict-based decisions as compared to EBT. Future research using computational tasks to more precisely model aspects of uncertainty in action selection, model complexity, learning rate, and sensitivity to reward/punishment, may have utility for informing precision medicine approaches to cognitive-behavioral therapies.\n\nKeywords: Computational Psychiatry, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Functional MRI (fMRI), Decision Making, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW25. Neuropeptide Y in CSF From Deployed Veterans is Positively Associated With Trauma Exposure but Negatively Associated With Lifetime History of mTBI\n\nRebecca Hendrickson*, Murray Raskind, Elaine Peskind\n\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nBackground: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide neurotransmitter implicated in resilience following traumatic stress. NPY concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been found to be decreased in combat Veterans with PTSD compared to combat Veterans without PTSD or healthy civilians. Animal work has suggested that one mechanism of NPY’s impact on modulating anxiety-like symptoms may be via reducing noradrenaline (NA) release. NPY has also been implicated in either mediating or modulating symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI) including mild TBI (mTBI), although there is evidence the timecourse of these changes may be complex. However, NPY has not to our knowledge been examined in Veterans who have been assessed for both mTBI history and PTSD symptoms, nor in a context where interactive effects between NPY and NA in modulating symptom expression can be assessed.\n\nWe wished to test the idea that both mTBI and traumatic stress may lead to persistent increases in NPY, with lower levels of increase being associated with both increased symptoms of PTSD or postconcussive syndrome (PCS), as well as higher levels of NA release. To do this, we measured CSF NPY levels in a population of post-9/11 deployed Veterans for whom CSF NA, PTSD and PCS symptoms, and lifetime exposure to common traumatic stressors and mTBI had been previously assessed.\n\nMethods: As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of blast mTBI, 66 Veterans (46 with a history of mTBI and 20 without; of the total, 33 met criteria for PTSD) underwent lumbar puncture, and the concentration NPY was quantified using a Millipore sandwich ELISA human NPY detection kit, while the concentration of noradrenaline was quantified using HPLC. PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Lifetime exposure to common traumatic stressors was assessed using the Life Events Checklist (LEC). Exposure to blast explosions and lifetime history of mTBI was assessed using a structured interview. For these analyses, lifetime history of mTBI resulting in loss of consciousness was used as a quantitative measure of mTBI exposure. All analyses were carried out using R, and all statistical tests are two-tailed.\n\nResults: Consistent with our predictions, in a linear model including both trauma exposure and mTBI history, NPY concentration was significantly positively associated total combat trauma exposure (p = .0054), but contrary to our predictions, it was negatively associated with mTBI exposure (p = 0.046). Further, contrary to our predictions, in a linear model including NPY, trauma exposure, and an interaction term between the two, NPY concentration was not associated with NA concentration (p = 0.95 for NPY, p = 0.93 for interaction term). Finally, there were a number of relationships that were in the direction predicted based on previous findings and of a magnitude with the potential to be scientifically significant, but which were not statistically significant: NPY levels were higher (but not statistically significantly) in those with a history of traumatic stress exposure but without a diagnosis of PTSD than in either those with PTSD or trauma-exposed controls. And, in those with a history of traumatic stress exposure, NPY was positively associated (but not statistically significantly) with both PTSD and PCS symptoms while NA was negatively associated (not statistically significantly) with these symptoms across multiple measure types.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that long-term changes in NPY levels may occur following combat trauma, but that the direction of the effect may vary between traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury. These results raise the possibility that repetitive mTBI may contribute to increased risk of PTSD diagnosis or symptoms at least in part by leading to long term inhibition of NPY, thus decreasing its availability to function as a resilience factor following traumatic stress.\n\nKeywords: Neuropeptide Y, PTSD, Veterans, Noradrenaline, CSF Biomarkers\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW26.

Exploring 20% CO2 as a Probe for Human Anxiety and Avoidance Behavior\n\nJustin Feinstein*, Bryan Dawkins, Hung-wen Yeh, Martin Paulus, Murray Stein\n\nLaureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States\n\nBackground: Inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most commonly used methods for safely inducing anxiety in a laboratory setting. Most prior work has focused on inducing panic using a single vital-capacity inhalation of 35% CO2. Much less is known about the anxiogenic effects of inhaling a single breath of lower dose CO2 and how the anxiety response changes following repeated inhalations. This study aimed to develop and test a novel probe for studying human anxiety and avoidance behavior using repeated exposure to a dose of 20% CO2.\n\nMethods: A transdiagnostic sample of 20 male and female participants with high levels of anxiety sensitivity (Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 total score ≥ 29) were recruited across the spectrum of anxiety disorders and compared to a demographically-matched sample of 20 healthy subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03925987\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03925987\"}}NCT03925987).
