        "text": "Vladimir Nabokov biography\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov was born in St. Petersburg, Russia on April 22, 1899, and was the oldest of 5 children. His father, Vladimir Dmitrievich, was a politician and his mother, Elena Ivanovna, was the granddaughter of a millionaire and an heiress. Nabokov was the favorite of his siblings and grew up in the wealthy world of Russian aristocracy. Despite growing up in the tumultuous time surrounding the Russian Revolution, Nabokov lived a comfortable childhood and would spend many summers at the idyllic country mansion in Vyra, where he first discovered his love of butterflies.\n\nThe Russian Revolution— the 1917 revolution that saw the overthrow of the imperial government. The government was taken over by the Bolshevik party. The Russian Revolution saw the conversion of Russia from a monarchy to a communist nation known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). As Nabokov was part of the Russian aristocracy, his family was in danger and were forced to flee the country.\n\nAs most aristocratic children were educated, Nabokov was taught by governesses and tutors until he was sent to Tenishev school—a liberal secondary school— in 1911. While attending Tenishev, Nabokov began to write poetry and verse and wrote his first book of poems, Stikhi, between 1915 and 1916. Nabokov's first book was not very popular or very well-liked. After the October Revolution of 1917, Nabokov's family fled Russia. Nabokov's family moved around Europe while he began attending Trinity at Oxford University in 1919. His family settled in Berlin in 1920 funded by Elena's jewels which they were forced to sell to survive.\n\nAt the university, Nabokov began to write extensively on topics ranging from entomological articles to critical essays to poetry. Nabokov's father was tragically killed during a politically fueled attack against the liberal politician Pavel Milyukov. This event traumatized Nabokov, and accidental death appears often in his books.\n\nNabokov's father was a believer in Jewish rights, was against the death penalty, and favored liberalism. When Pavel Milyukov was holding a Berlin conference in 1922, two extreme rightist gunmen attempted to assassinate Milyukov. Nabokov's father disarmed the first gunman and was shot by the second gunman, ultimately killing him.\n\nWhen Nabokov graduated from Trinity he lived in Berlin and tried to work at a bank. He lasted barely three hours before quitting, so Nabokov began to support himself by tutoring in French and English. Nabokov belonged to the Russian Berlin literary community and continued to write prose and poetry.\n\nin 1923, Nabokov met Vera Evseyevna Slonim at a ball and fell madly in love with her. By 1925 they were married. Vera was also a poet and had intentions of attending the Technische Hochschule in Berlin, but her health was too poor. In 1934 they had their only child, Dmitri.\n\nIn 1922, Nabokov began to publish translations, and in 1926 published his first book Mary (1926) under his pseudonym Vladimir Sirin. By 1934, writing was his established career. As Vera was Jewish and antisemitism was on the rise in Berlin, Nabokov began to search elsewhere to live. After a brief affair with Irina Guadinini in France, Nabokov moved his family to the USA in 1940. They lived in New York and Nabokov began to tutor once more until he found work as a lecturer at Wellesley College in 1941. Nabokov continued writing and publishing post-modernist books such as The Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941) and Bend Sinister (1947). In 1948, Nabokov accepted a teaching position at Cornell University.\n\nDuring his time at Cornell, Nabokov wrote his most famous book Lolita which was internationally successful despite initial difficulties to publish it and it's subsequent banning in France for two years. Lolita and Nabokov's other books created foundations for the Post Modernist movement.\n\nIn the first three weeks of the USA release of Lolita in 1958, the book sold over 100,000 copies.\n\nNabokov left the USA in 1961 and moved to Switzerland with Vera to be close to their son Dmitri who was living in Italy. During this period, Nabokov continued his love of hunting butterflies and writing. In 1977, Nabokov fell ill with bronchitis and on July 2nd died."
