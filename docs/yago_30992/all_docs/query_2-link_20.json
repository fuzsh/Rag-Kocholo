        "text": "Russian-born American novelist, critic, and acknowledged lepidopterist. Vladimir Nabokov wrote both in Russian and English. His best-known novel, Lolita (1955), shocked many people but its humor and literary style were praised by critics. The first version of the story, Volshebnik (The Enchanter), was written in 1939 in Paris. The Enchanter centered on a middle-aged man, who falls in love with a 12-year-old girl and marries her sick, widowed mother to satisfy his erotic desires. He molests the girl in a Riviera hotel while she's asleep, she wakens and he runs into the traffic and dies.\n\n\"Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their nature, which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose designate as 'nymphets.'\" (from Lolita, with an introduction by Martin Amis, Everyman's Library, 1992, p. 17,\n\nVladimir Nabokov was born in St. Petersburg into a wealthy, aristocratic family. His father, Vladimir Dimitrievich Nabokov, was a liberal politician, lawyer, and journalist. The household was Anglophile – Nabokov spoke Russian and English, and at the age of five he learned French. His father taught him to collect butterflies.\n\nNabokov received his education at the Tenishev, St. Petersburg's most innovative school. At 16 he inherited a large estate from his father's brother, but he did not have much time to enjoy his wealth. During the Russian Revolution his father was briefly arrested. Nabokov brought a butterfly to his cell as a present. The family emigrated to Berlin and Nabokov entered Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1923. Vladimir Dimitrievich was murdered in Berlin in 1922 by a Russian monarchist.\n\nNabokov spent 15 years in Berlin, where he worked as a translator, tutor, and tennis coach. From 1932-37 he lived with his wife and son at Nestorstrasse 22 in Wilmersdorf. He won acceptance as the leading young writer in the Russian community. Berlin was for him a city \" \"swarming with ragamuffins\", as he said in the short novel Otchayanie (1936; Despair, 1937). Most of his readers were Russian émigrés – in the Soviet Russia his books were banned or ignored. In his early works Nabokov dealt with the death, the flow of time and sense of loss.\n\nAlready using complex metaphors, his themes became later more ambiguous puzzles – he was a remarkable chess player – that challenge the reader to involve in the game. He had no illusions about publishing realities. ''Readers are not sheep,\" he once wrote in a letter, \"and not every pen (pun) tempts them. Some of my best flops had been ushered in by extravagant (albeit well deserved) praise from eminent critics. The only thing that is of some help to the commercial success of a book (apart from topicality or sexuality) is a sustained advertising campaign, lots of ads everywhere.\" (Selected Letters, 1940-1977 by Vladimir Nabokov, edited by Dmitri Nabokov and Matthew J. Bruccoli, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1989, p. 345)\n\nIn Lectures on Russian Literature (1981) Nabokov wrote that to be a good reader one does not have to belong to a book club, or to any specifix nation or class; the admirable reader does not seek information about Russia inn a Russian novel, \". . . for just as the universal family of gifted writers transcends national barriers, so is the gifted reader a universal figure, no subject to spatial or temporal laws. It is he—the good, the excellent reader—who has saved the artist again and again from being destroyed by emperors, dictators, priests, puritans, philistines, political moralists, policemen, postmasters, and prigs.\" (Ibid., edited, with an introduction by Fredson Bowers, Picador, 1983, pp. 10-11)\n\nIn Zashchita Luzhina (1930, The Defense) Nabokov took the role of a grandmaster and played with the expectations of his readers. The protagonist, Aleksandr Luzhin, is a chess phenomenon, who becomes a character on a giant chessboard. Luzhin finds it increasingly difficult to make the transition from the world of the game to everyday reality. After suffering a mental breakdown, he recuperates slowly with the help of a young woman. Luzhin starts to believe that a cunning opponent is trying to manipulate the moves he makes in his life. He decides to throw himself out of a window and notices that the courtyard below seems to look like a giant chessboard. Luzhin is right: there is an opponent and he is Nabokov himself, who makes the point that the story is an artistic creation.\n\nAs a writer Nabokov gained his first literary success with his translations of some of Heine's songs. Nabokov's first novel, Mashenka (1926), was written in Russia. In 1924 Nabokov married Véra Evseevna Slonim, who came from a Jewish family; they had one son, Dmitri. Nabokov's early nine novels were published under the pen name Vladimir Sirin. These works included The Gift (1937-38), a novel and an intellectual history of 19th-century Russia, and Invitation to a Beheading (1938), a political fantasy, in which the remaining days in the life the central character correspond to the length of his pencil. Nabokov himself wrote everything in longhand. \"I cannot type,\" he confessed in an interview in 1962. Camera Obscura (1933, Laughter in the Dark), about love and obsession in nineteen-thirties Berlin, has been called a sister story to Lolilta. Tony Richardson's film adaptation of the novel from 1969, starring Nicol Williamson and Anna Karina, was set in the swinging London of the sixties.\n\nWhen Hitler released the killer of his father, Nabokov moved to Paris in 1937. There he met the Irish novelist James Joyce. With a loan he received from the composer Rachmaninov, Nabokov moved three years later with his wife and son to the United States – he crossed the ocean on the Champlain, where he had a first-class cabin. He left behind in his Paris apartment a set of European butterflies.\n\nNabokov taught at Wellesley College and Cornell University, delivering highly acclaimed lectures on Flaubert, Joyce, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and others. Among his major critical works are his study of Nikolay Gogol (1944), and translation of Aleksandr Pushkin's masterpiece Eugene Onegin (1964), with commentary. The ten-year-long work was first brought out by Bollingen Foundation in four volumes. Nabokov cautioned against translating rhyme by rhyme: \"can a rhymed poem like Eugene Onegin be truly translated with a retention of its rhymes. The answer, of course, is no. To reproduce the rhymes and yet translate the entire poem literally is mathematically impossible.\" ('Translator's Foreword', in Eugene Onegin: A Novel in Verse by Aleksander Pushkin, translated and with an introdution by Vladimir Nabokov, with a foreword by Brian Boyd, Princeton University Press, 2018, p. xxviii) Nabokov's friend Edmund Wilson, who fully recognized Nabokov's \"virtuosity in juggling with the English language\",\" slaughtered the translation, saying that \"with his sado-masochistic Dostoevskian tendencies so acutely noted by Sartre – he seeks to torture both the reader and himself by flattening Pushkin out and denying to his own powers the scope for their full play.\" ('The Strange Case of Pushkin and Nabokov', The New York Review of Books, July 15, 1965) Anthony Burgess concluded in his review that the translation was \"a massive act of copulation with scholarship.\" (Encounter, May 1965)\n\nIn the United States Nabokov continued his extensive researches in entomology, becoming a recognized authority on butterflies. He also held a modest but official position at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. The job lasted until 1948. \"My loathings are simple: stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music,\" he once said in an interview. \"My pleasures are the most intense known to a man: writing and butterfly hunting.\" (Strong Opinions by Vladimir Nabokov, Vintage Books, 1990, p. 3)\n\nAs a lepidopterist Nabokov was self-taught, but his attitude to scientific work was serious, not dilettantish. Especially he was interested in Blues, the tribe Polyommatini, found all over the world. Later Nabokov estimated that between the years 1949 and 1959 he traveled more than 150,000 miles on butterfly trips. His wife Vera drove their car; Nabokov didn't have a driving licence. Once he had collected his specimens he studied their genitalia. It was one of the best ways of telling one species apart from another. Over 20 butterflies have been named in his honour.\n\nHis years at the museum Nabokov described as the most delightful and thrilling in all his adult life. In his boyhood Nabokov had already made notes on butterflies. His first scientific article in English was 'A Few Notes on Crimean Lepidoptera', published in The Entomologist (February 1920): \"Russia offers a wide and fruitful field of research to the entomologist.\" Changing languages was not easy – as a writer, he also created a new persona for himself.\n\nThe Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941) and Bend Sinister (1947) were Nabokov's first novels in English. The Atlantic and the New Yorker started to publish Nabokov's short stories in the early 1940s. In America, apart from collecting his shorter prose of the 1930s into one book, Vesna v Fial'te, Nabokov published only memoirs and verse in Russian. Conclusive Evidence (1951) was an autobiography, which was later revived as Speak, Memory (1966), set mainly in pre-revolutionary Russia. When the Australian critic and writer Andrew Field planned to write a biography on Nabokov, the answer was: \"I told everything about myself in Speak, Memory, and it was not a very pleasant portrait. I appear as a precious person in that book. All that chess and those butterflies. Not very interesting.\" (Nabokov's Blues: The Scientific Odyssey of a Literary Genius by Kurt Johnson and Steve Coates, McGraw-Hill, 1999, p. 12)\n\nIt took six years before Nabokov finished Lolita, a literary bomb. The English writer Graham Greene cited it among the best books of 1955. Edmund Wilson, Evelyn Waugh, and E.M. Forster did not share his view. With Lolita Nabokov gained a huge success, although it was banned in Paris in 1956-58 and not published in full in America and the U.K. until 1958.\n\nLolita is one of the most controversial novels of the 20th-century, in which the rhetoric of the protagonist both captivates and repels. The story deals with the desire of a middle-aged pedophile Humbert Humbert, the narrator, for a 12-year-old girl. \"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins,\" he starts his story. Humbert is said to be a metaphor for the writer and his art, and for the old world – Humbert is an European expatriate – encountering the new, represented by an American teenage girl, in all its vulgarity. Humbert keeps a prison-diary of his lifelong fascination with pubescent \"nymphets\". The first is Annabel Leigh, who dies of typhus, but then he finds Dolores Haze, his Lolita, in a New England town. She reminds him of the little girl he loved as a boy. During the course of the story, Humbert loses her to Clare Quilty, a playwright and pornographic filmmaker. Humbert kills him and dies in a prison of a heart attack. Lolita dies in childbirth as delivering a stillborn daughter.\n\nStanley Kubrick's film version of the book was based on Nabokov's screenplay. \"I knew that if I did not write the script somebody else would,\" Nabokov said in an interview for Newsweek (1962), \"and I also knew that at best the end product is such cases is less of a blend than a collision of interpretations.\" (Think, Write, Speak: Uncollected Essays, Reviews, Interviews, and Letters to the Editor by Vladimir Nabokov, edited by Brian Boyd and Anastasia Tolstoy, Alfred A. Knopf, 2019, p. 319)\n\nLolita allowed Nabokov to abandon teaching and devote himself entirely to writing. In 1957 Nabokov published Pnin, a story of a hapless Russian professor of literature on an American college campus. Pale Fire (1962) was an ambitious mixture of literary forms, partly a one-thousand-line poem in heroic couplets by John Francis Shade (1898-1959), partly a commentary on them by a mad scholar-critic Charles Kinbote, who insists that he is the deposed monarch of a kingdom called Zembla. \". . . I can do what only a true artist can do,\" describes Kinbote himself, \"pounce upon the forgotten butterfly of revelation, wean myself abruptly from the habit of things, see the web of the world, and the warp and the weft of that web.\" (Ibid., Berkley Books, 1962, p. 195) When Shade is killed, he gathers up the notecards of the poet's last work, and produces 'Pale Fire,' an edition of the poem. Kinbote's commentary on it is many times longer than the work itself and reveas more of Kinbote's own fixations than Shade's poem.\n\nFrom 1959 Nabokov lived in Switzerland, where his permanent home was at the Montreux Palace Hotel. He continued to collect butterflies, which after his death were stored at the Cantonal Museum of Zoology of Lausanne. Nabokov's later works include Ada (1969), a love story set on the planet of Antiterra, a mixture of Russia and America, Transparent Things (1972), and Look at the Harlequins! (1975), in which Nabokov's own life coincides occasionally with the protagonist's, also a writer.\n\nThe writer's son Dmitri has undertook the translation of several of Nabokov's books from these later years. Nabokov himself wanted to be valued more as an American writer than a Russian one. In the Soviet Union he perhaps enjoyed greater fame than in the West. Nabokov died in Lausanne on July 2, 1977.\n\nFor further reading: The Annotated Lolita by A. Apper Jr. (1970); Nabokov's Garden by B.A. Mason (1974); Vladimir Nabokov by L.L.

Both version made Lolita appear older than in the novel but still ran into serious trouble. \"One could argue that this Humbert is no pedophile at all. He is attracted only to Lolita, and it is made quite clear that that is due more to her resemblance to the lost Annabel than to anything pertaining to her age. At no time, for example, does he pay the slightest attention to the many other little girls that scamper about the edges of the story.
