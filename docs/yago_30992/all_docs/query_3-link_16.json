        "text": "My sun, my soul, my song, my bird, my sweetheart, my pink sky, my sunny rainbow, my little music, my inexpressible delight, my softness, my tenderness, my lightness, my dear life, my dear eyes. . . . These endearments and salutations (backed up by a crowded menagerie of surrogates: Goosikins, Poochums, Tigercubkin, Puppykin) suggest a sky-filling ­adoration and, more than that, a helpless dependency. As early as Vladimir Nabokov’s second letter to Véra Slonim, after a couple of months of chaste acquaintanceship, he lays it all before her: “I cannot write a word without hearing how you will pronounce it — and can’t recall a single trifle I’ve lived through without regret — so sharp! — that we haven’t lived through it together. . . . You came into my life . . . as one comes to a kingdom where all the rivers have been waiting for your reflection, all the roads, for your steps.”\n\nAnd so it goes on for over half a century, his ardor — at first sometimes skittishly insecure — gradually modulating into assurance and serenity. Warning: There is one seismic aberration (Paris, 1937), to which we will uneasily return.\n\nVladimir (rhymes with “redeemer,” he has said) was born in 1899, Véra in 1902. They met at a charity ball in Berlin in 1923, an occasion organized by the Russian émigré community — 400,000 strong, and notable for its cohesion, its material penury and its intellectual wealth. Although very different in their origins (he was patrician-artistic, she middle-class and Jewish), they were fair representatives of their high-minded and unworldly colony. That party was a masquerade; and, throughout, Véra’s mask stayed up.\n\nHe immediately had to go off to work on a farm in the South of France. As a devotee of his published verse (much of it confessional), she would have known that he had recently and tormentedly broken up with a girl he hoped to marry. Showing unusual forwardness, she wrote to him until he replied. “I won’t hide it,” begins his opening letter, where she is already ensconced as “my strange joy, my tender night.” Once he was back in Berlin the romance proceeded, on his part at least, without a trace of inhibition. They were married in the spring of 1925.\n\nOne of Nabokov’s most striking peculiarities was his near-pathological good cheer — he himself found it “indecent.” Young writers tend to cherish their sensitivity, and thus their alienation, but the only source of angst Nabokov admitted to was “the impossibility of assimilating, swallowing, all the beauty in the world.” Having a husband who was so brimmingly full of fun might have involved a certain strain; still, the fact that Véra was not similarly blessed is just a reminder of the planetary norm. Indeed, their first long separation came in the spring and summer of 1926, when she decamped to a series of sanitariums in the Schwarzwald in the far southwest, suffering from weight loss, anxiety and depression.\n\nVéra was gone for seven weeks, and Vladimir wrote to her every day. ­Spanning more than a hundred pages, the interlude is one of the summits in the mountain range of this book. He endeavored not only to raise her spirits (with puzzles, riddles, crosswords, which she almost invariably solved) but also to love her back to health — with punctual transfusions of his buoyant worship. Here one finds oneself submitting to the weird compulsion of the quotidian, because he tells her everything: about his writing, his tutoring, his tennis, his regular romps and swims in the Grunewald (for her the Black Forest, for him the Green); he tells her what he is reading, what he is eating (all his meals are itemized), what he is dreaming, even what he is wearing. Also, very casually, almost disdainfully (as befits the teenage millionaire he once was), he keeps noticing that they don’t seem to have any money.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
