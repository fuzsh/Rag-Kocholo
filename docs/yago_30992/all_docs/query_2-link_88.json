        "text": "Lolita is mostly known for it’s controversial plot: The narrator, Humbert Humbert falls in ‘love’ with an underage girl, Lolita, they go on a road trip, the girl gets kidnapped and then settles down while Humbert is locked up in an asylum.\n\nIn ways Lolita is a tragic story but a lot of critics fail to mention that it’s gently humorous as well. This is due to Humbert’s command of the English language. Especially in the beginning when his desires for Lolita are so ridiculous that they border on the cartoonish. Puns, wordplay, unconventional similes and that is only one aspect of Humbert Humbert.\n\nWhile I find Lolita, the character, nothing but a plot device – maybe a representative of a new generations of Americans: brash, the real star of the book is Humbert Humbert, one of the most complex characters in literature.\n\nHumbert desires Lolita, not because he loves her but because she looks like a girl he lost when he was a teenager and although Lolita resembles this lost love, her character is different and Humbert plays the role of the over-spoiling guardian and the perverted lover. Ultimately it is this dual role which leads to his breakdown. Since Humbert is not capable of loving he cannot ever manage to fall in love, only finding replacements. In fact when Lolita is kidnapped and then escapes she writes a letter to Humbert asking for money. As a last attempt Humbert asks her to leave her new husband and join him, to which she refuses. Humbert sends a generous amount as his over-spoiling side takes over.\n\nThe novel ends with both characters dying within close proximity to each other, thus giving the novel a more tragic angle. Both Humbert and Lolita tried to embrace an ideal lifestyle but also failed in the process. Thus Lolita (the novel) is also an attempt to achieve the American dream but due to both protagonists psychological make up the dream slips from their fingers.\n\nThis review was originally on Goodreads"
