        "text": "On May 8, 1923, a young woman appeared before a young man — an emerging poet — at an émigré charity ball in Berlin. Wearing a black Harlequin demi-mask she refused to lower, she proceeded to produce a verse from one of his poems, which she had clipped from the Russian liberal daily Rul’ some months earlier and committed to memory.\n\nHe was instantly besotted.\n\nThe woman was 21-year-old Véra Slonim and the man 24-year-old Vladimir Nabokov, and with this Shakespearean encounter began one of history’s greatest romances.\n\nNabokov had just emerged from the heartbreak of his first great love and was still raw with grief over his father’s death. The encounter with Véra sliced through the thick of this darkness with a luminous beam of possibility — for love, for happiness, for vibrant aliveness. So taken was the young writer with the glimpse of this possibility that he immortalized that fateful moment in a beautiful poem titled “The Encounter,” included in the altogether enchanting Letters to Véra (public library) — one of the best biographies of 2014, which gave us Nabokov’s affectionate bestiary of nicknames for Véra, his clever puzzles and word games for her, and literature’s most entertaining account of food poisoning.\n\nNabokov mailed the poem to Rul,’ where it was published on June 24. Catalyzing their lifetime of passionate love letters was this most exquisite private serenade performed behind the demi-mask of a public text, translated here by Olga Voronina.\n\nTHE ENCOUNTER\n\nenchanted by this strange proximity\n\nLonging, and mystery, and delight…\n\nas if from the swaying blackness\n\nof some slow-motion masquerade\n\nonto the dim bridge you came.\n\nAnd night flowed, and silent there floated\n\ninto its satin streams\n\nthat black mask’s wolf-like profile\n\nand those tender lips of yours.\n\nAnd under the chestnuts, along the canal\n\nyou passed, luring me askance.\n\nWhat did my heart discern in you,\n\nhow did you move me so?\n\nIn your momentary tenderness,\n\nor in the changing contour of your shoulders,\n\ndid I experience a dim sketch\n\nof other — irrevocable — encounters?\n\nPerhaps romantic pity\n\nled you to understand\n\nwhat had set trembling that arrow\n\nnow piercing through my verse?\n\nI know nothing. Strangely\n\nthe verse vibrates, and in it, an arrow…\n\nPerhaps you, still nameless, were\n\nthe genuine, the awaited one?\n\nBut sorrow not yet quite cried out\n\nperturbed our starry hour.\n\nInto the night returned the double fissure\n\nof your eyes, eyes not yet illumed.\n\nFor long? For ever? Far off\n\nI wander, and strain to hear\n\nthe movement of the stars above our encounter\n\nand what if you are to be my fate…\n\nLonging, and mystery, and delight,\n\nand like a distant supplication….\n\nMy heart must travel on.\n\nBut if you are to be my fate…\n\nHis fate she did become — they were married twenty months later and remained together for half a century, until death did them part. So complete was their union that Véra became Vladimir’s de facto editor, assistant, administrator, agent, archivist, chauffeur, researcher, stenographer in four languages, and even his bodyguard, famously carrying a small pistol in her purse to protect her husband from assassination after he became America’s most famous and most scandalous living author."
