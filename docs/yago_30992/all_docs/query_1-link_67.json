Nabokov wrote his books first for himself, second for his wife, and third for no one at all. &ldquo;Without my wife,&rdquo; he once noted, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have written a single novel.&rdquo; &#160; Set in prewar Europe and postwar America, spanning much of the&#160;twentieth&#160;century, the story of the Nabokovs&rsquo;&#160;fifty-two-year marriage reads as vividly as a novel. V&eacute;ra, both beautiful and brilliant, is its outsized heroine&mdash;a woman who loves as deeply and intelligently as did the great romantic heroines of Austen and Tolstoy. Stacy Schiff's  V&eacute;ra  is a triumph of the biographical form.",
