In SAP’s Audimax around 220 participants followed the presentations of OPC Foundation officials, vendors and end users showing their experience with OPC UA. During breaks participants could—besides the excellent catering—speak to UA Experts that lined up the foyer. This event surely strengthen the confidence in UA technology and showed the commitment of vendors and users to go for a new communication standard."
