It has become a destination for people who want their careers and their social lives to flourish. In 2017, U.S. News & World Report confirmed what we already knew—and named Austin the best place to live in the U.S.\n\nMusic is a hallmark of Austin. Its status as the Live Music Capital of the World is backed by 200 live music venues and 2,000 bands and performing artists who deliver amazing shows every night of the week. SXSW and the Austin City Limits Music Festival have brought the city international fame, drawing celebrities and locals alike for an unforgettable music experience.\n\nOver the past decade, Austin has built a renowned food scene. Award-winning restaurants and adventurous food trucks fill the city’s streets and neighborhoods, where chefs plate up classic fare and create new favorites. You might have a hard time deciding whether you want ramen, barbecue or tacos, but one thing’s for sure—it’ll be some of the best you’ve ever had.\n\nWith 300 sunny days a year, Austin is a perfect place to explore the outdoors. Running the hike and bike trail, swimming in Barton Springs, kayaking on Lady Bird Lake or climbing at a greenbelt are go-to favorites. The Central Texas Hill Country offers even more opportunities to get outside, with hiking, mountain- and road-biking, camping and floating the rivers.\n\nWhether you’re a music lover, foodie or outdoor enthusiast, imagine living your best life in the nation’s best city—imagine yourself here."
