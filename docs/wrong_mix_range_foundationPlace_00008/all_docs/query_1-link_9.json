        "text": "WALLDORF and BONN, Germany — Sept. 7, 2023 — SAP SE and LeanIX GmbH today announced that SAP has entered into an agreement to acquire LeanIX, a leader in enterprise architecture management (EAM) software. The planned acquisition helps SAP expand its business transformation portfolio, giving customers access to the full suite of tools required for continuous business transformation and facilitating AI-enabled process optimization. LeanIX, a privately held company, has been a strategic partner of SAP and for SAP® Signavio® solutions for 10 years. Many CIOs rely on LeanIX’s offerings as part of their digital transformation with the RISE with SAP solution.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nWith the intended acquisition, SAP is extending its comprehensive transformation suite to help customers navigate change more easily and permanently improve their business processes. LeanIX complements the transformation capabilities of SAP Signavio solutions and will give SAP customers the unique clarity on IT landscapes that they need to reap the full benefit of business transformation.

Building on our decades of expertise, we’ll embed generative AI to offer self-optimizing applications and processes that can help businesses achieve key goals such as maximizing cash flow while minimizing their environmental impact.”\n\nSAP’s new business transformation solution suite will give customers a comprehensive view of business processes and applications, including overlaying process dependencies and mapping the impact of potential transformations on the IT landscape. LeanIX’s IT landscape transformation capabilities – together with SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite, RISE with SAP, and SAP Business Technology Platform – will enable SAP customers to create a culture of continuous adaptability and improvement. In addition, LeanIX will continue to serve non-SAP landscapes.\n\n“For more than a decade, we have pursued a relentless customer-centric approach, a commitment to superior usability and seamless ecosystem integration and have become a leader in the enterprise architecture management category,\" said André Christ, CEO and co-founder, LeanIX.\n\n“Our strategy is to empower organizations to continuously transform in a rapidly changing business environment.
