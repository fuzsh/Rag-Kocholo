We're there.\"\n\nIt's coming down to the wire as 30 teams get ready to present applications in the first ever Autism at Work hackathon with Dell Technologies and SAP.\n\nThe goal is simple.\n\n\"Work on how to make it even more efficient, more effective, more productive for those on the (autism) spectrum to come in and work in many places,\" Dell Technologies Senior Vice President and True Ability Director Patrick Poljan said.\n\nFrom the hiring process to retention and support, these teams worked on programs to eliminate stereotypes and stumbling blocks to .\n\n\"85 percent of people on the spectrum are unemployed and a great deal of the problem is the interview process.\" SAP Autism at Work Director Jose Velasco said. \"So, what we thought we'd do is create a different path to success for people on the autism spectrum.\"\n\nThe developers are modifying the interview process for companies by not weighing it so heavily on social interaction.\n\n\"To make sure we accommodate this great talent,\" Velasco said. \"Which is very, very abundant.\"\n\nTwo winners will go on to the national 2019 Autism at Work Summit at the Els for Autism Foundation in October, but in the end, organizers say everyone wins as these tech giants create awareness that will change lives and bring better bottom lines for businesses.\n\n\"There is a wave of talent coming at us that we should tap into and be ready to tap into,\" Velasco said."
