Schedule an inspection now.\n\nWhat Causes Foundation Problems in Austin, TX?\n\nThe integrity of every structure depends on a sound foundation. Small cracks and shifts in your foundation can turn into big problems in a hurry, especially here in Texas where our dry climate and expansive clay soils leave homes susceptible to foundation movement. Expansive clay soils respond to moisture changes at an extreme rate compared to non-expansive soils. High or low moisture levels result in the expansion and contraction of molecules, causing upheaval or settlement to the soil directly underneath the home’s foundation.\n\nAccording to a study performed by the University of Texas at Arlington, the damages to infrastructure resulting from structural movement caused by expansive clay soils is close to 9 billion dollars per year! The threat of structural problems is very serious and very real in Central Texas. If you examine the expansive clay soil map and drought conditions provided by the US Drought Monitor, you’ll see that Austin is located right in the middle of a high-risk zone for structural damage.\n\nThe geological and weather-related evidence is validated by the high level of demand for foundation-related services in Travis County. According to Google Trends, a database that tracks Google search activity in various regions, Austin is among the nation’s top 5 most active regions for “foundation repair” search volume.\n\nUnfortunately for property owners, expansive clay soils aren’t the only factor working against your real estate investment. Here is a more comprehensive list of issues that includes the top 5 most common causes of foundation problems in Travis County. This list was determined using data collected from Olshan customers in the region over the past decade.\n\nSeasonal Weather Changes: Periods of wet and/or dry climate can have a volatile effect on the soil underneath your foundation. As the soil expands and contracts, over time, the structural integrity supporting your home can weaken, causing the foundation to settle and crack.\n\nPoor Drainage: Proper drainage management systems are an important component of a healthy home. Too much or too little water near the home can lead to stress. Standing water around your home, large amounts of water dumped by downspouts or a negative slope near the landscape around your home can all cause drainage problems to emerge.\n\nExpansive Clay Soils: There’s little that can be done to avoid the problems caused by expansive soils in Texas. It’s important to address any structural problems early, before the damage gets worse.\n\nTrees and Tree Roots: Believe it or not, a large tree can consume as much as 150 gallons of water per day. When roots are under or near your foundation, the drying process may cause a portion of the soil to shrink. The differential in moisture content below the home may cause one part of the foundation to move more than others. Root barriers, tree removal and foundation watering can often help.\n\nUnder-Slab Plumbing Leaks: Leaking water underneath the slab can create excessive moisture levels deep under the structure, causing the affected area to heave upward and disturb the stability of your slab. Under-slab leaks often go unnoticed. Hydrostatic testing is recommended to check for plumbing issues hidden deep below the property.\n\nOther problems we commonly encounter include:\n\nLateral Movement: Soil movement caused by erosion, sliding or sloughing of soils. Mudslides can be caused by lateral movement.\n\nSoil Compaction: Support materials found underneath the property can fail due to compaction.\n\nFrost Heave: The water that accompanies the soil underneath the property can freeze, leading to expansion and upheaval.\n\nBuilding Defects: Faulty design or construction during the building process can lead to failure.\n\nWood Rot: The wood used in crawl space homes can rot or warp, affecting the stability of the foundation.\n\nDamage caused by structural problems should not be ignored, it’s important to fix the damage early, before it spreads. If you are seeing signs of trouble schedule an assessment with a Certified Structural Technician or reputable Structural Engineer.\n\nHow to Find Signs of Foundation Damage in Austin, TX\n\nRegularly inspecting your home and foundation for signs of damage can play an important role in preserving the long-term performance of the home. Here’s a checklist of the most common signs of foundation problems.\n\nUneven, sagging or warped floors\n\nBowed walls\n\nCracks in walls and ceilings\n\nSeparation of baseboards from walls, especially at corners\n\nCrooked doors and/or doors that won’t open/close properly\n\nCabinet doors that hang askew\n\nWindows that stick (are hard to open and close)\n\nCracked chimney — improper exterior drainage may be the cause of chimney cracks\n\nCracks in exterior walls\n\nBuilding corners that appear separated\n\nPortions of the house that seem to be sagging into the ground\n\nPooling water or swampy spots in the lawn, especially near the foundation\n\nIf you live in Texas, make a habit to check for these items every year. If you suspect you may have a problem, schedule an assessment. At Olshan, our staff not only fixes the damage, we also carefully investigate your property to discover what the underlying problem truly is. We don’t just mask the symptoms, we correct root of the problem to ensure a long-lasting solution.\n\nWhat is the Cost of Foundation Repair in Austin?\n\nThere is a lot of information on repair costs available online, but you’ll find that a lot of it includes data on basement homes and waterproofing. Although the extra space might be nice, basement foundations are just not that common in Texas. That can be a good thing though, as basement homes are vulnerable to a unique set of problems all of their own. What we do have are crawl spaces, and they present their own set of problems.\n\nHere is a very basic outline for estimating cost:\n\nTo establish a rough estimate you will first want to determine if you have a pier and beam, slab-on-grade, or base and block foundation.\n\nNext, a contractor will determine the extent of the problem. A large problem like upheaval will be more costly.\n\nThe type of solution used will also impact the price. First, the contractor will need to determine how accessible the area that needs repair is. Tunneling underneath will often be more costly than other alternatives, like injecting the area between the slab and soil with polyurethane grout. If piers are used, the build materials and the number of piers used will affect the cost.\n\nSpecial considerations will also be made since each home is different.\n\nA repair plan is configured that may include other, related components, such as root barriers, drainage management or tree removal.\n\nOn average, basic foundation repair services range from about $3,500 to $8,000, depending on the extent of the problem and the size of the property. Some homeowners receive a pleasant surprise after an assessment reveals that an extensive repair job is not necessary.\n\nSome homes may simply need preventive maintenance, which could cost between $500 and $3,000. Any company inspecting your foundation should offer a free estimate as well as a warranty for any work performed.\n\nWe have provided some averages based on the jobs we have completed in 2024 so far.
