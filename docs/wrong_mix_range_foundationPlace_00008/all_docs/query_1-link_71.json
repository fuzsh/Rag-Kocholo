        "text": "The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) set forth an ambitious goal of creating a standardized process for applying to use federal data—including highly confidential data sets—for evidence-building purposes. Congress had several reasons for making it easier to find and apply for federal data assets—\n\nSafely expanding access to and use of data, including administrative data, for evidence building can substantially improve public policies and programs\n\nEvidence building is enhanced when data are available to staff at all levels of government, including state and local officials\n\nBusiness and academic communities need timely access to high-quality data to develop insights and analytic tools that benefit citizens, policymakers, and the private sector\n\n\"The OMB shall . . . establish a process through which agencies, the Congressional Budget Office, state, local, and tribal governments, researchers, and other individuals may apply to access the data assets accessed or acquired by a statistical agency or unit for purposes of developing evidence.”— P.L. 115-435 - Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018"
