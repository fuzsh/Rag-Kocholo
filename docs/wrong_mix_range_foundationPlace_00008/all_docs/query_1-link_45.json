HISTOR Y\n\n9. 2.1 History  SAP AG was founded in 1972 by five German engineers with IBM in Weinheim, Germany;  Founders— – Hasso Plattner, – Dietmar Hopp, – Klaus Tschira, – Hans Werner Hector\n\n10. 2.2 History  When an IBM client asked IBM to provide enterprise-wide software to run on its mainframe  The five began writing the program only to be told the assignment was being transferred to another unit  Rather than abandon the project altogether, they left IBM and founded SAP\n\n11. 2.3 History  Without the benefit of loans from banks, venture capitalists, or the German government, SAP began fashioning its software business gradually through the cash flow generated by an growing stable of customers  Development of R/1:  Working at night on borrowed computers, Plattner and colleagues built SAP's client list, beginning with a German subsidiary of the global chemical company ICI and later adding Siemens and BMW.\n\n12. 2.4 History  R/2 in the Late 1970s  In 1978 SAP began developing, and the following year released, R/2 (R for \"real-time\"), a mainframe- based, standard business software suite modules for:  Accounting,  Sales and Distribution  Production  Enabled customers to consolidate their financial and operational data into a single database and reducing costs\n\n13. 2.5 History  Introduction of R/3 in the 1990s  R/3 had been launched with the expectation that it would complement R/2's multinational-oriented niche by extending SAP's reach into the mid-sized, less mainframe- dominated business software market  R/3's release coincided with a growing trend toward corporate downsizing, and even SAP's largest customers began eyeing R/3 as a less labour-intensive replacement for R/2  As a result, in the space of one year (1992-93), the percentage of SAP America's total revenue generated by R/3 catapulted from five to 80 percent  R/2's status as SAP's flagship product dwindled from 95 percent of revenues to only 20 percent.\n\n14. 2.6 History  Foreign Markets in the 1990s  SAP's sales to German companies had fallen to 37%  North American sales accounted for one-third of all revenues;  Asia-Pacific market was expected to reach the same level by the year 2000.  In 1996 SAP relocated most of its marketing operation to its Wayne, Pennsylvania, complex.  Between 1992 and 1996, it opened subsidiaries in South Africa, Malaysia, Japan, the Czech Republic, Russia, China, and Mexico among others  R/3 was available in 14 foreign languages including Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and Thai.\n\n15.

Competitors\n\n23. 5.1 Competitors  SAP vs Oracle:  23rd Nov’10: Oracle sued SAP, alleging that SAP had engaged in copyright infringement by downloading thousands of copyrighted documents and programs from Oracle's Customer Connection website.  SAP admitted that its subsidiary Tomorrow Now had infringed Oracle's copyrights and a jury awarded Oracle record-high damages in the amount of $1.3 billion.\n\n24. 5.2 Competitors  SAP vs Oracle (Continued)  The rivalry is heating up even more following SAP CTO Vishal Sikka’s recent comments that SAP plans to support its flagship Business Suite ERP software on its HANA in- memory database platform by the end of 2012.  Industry observers see this as a move to entice companies to choose HANA over Oracle databases.\n\n25.
