Over 8,500 enterprises worldwide, including more than 75 percent of the Fortune 100 and 99 of the top 100 U.S. business schools, rely on Qualtrics.\n\nWe led Qualtrics’ $150M Series B round in 2014 and co-led their $180M Series C round in 2017. We were thrilled to help them celebrate their $8B acquisition by SAP in 2019. Along the way, we supported the company with pricing advisory as they pivoted from a survey tool to a Customer Experience Platform, and changed the industry."
