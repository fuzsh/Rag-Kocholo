        "text": "BOSTON—June 22, 2023— Bain & Company today announced a global partnership with SAP SE, a market leader in ERP software, to help clients maximize the impact of cloud-enabled business transformations at a critical time when most enterprises are investing in technology migrations but may struggle to achieve their business modernization goals.\n\nTogether, SAP and Bain have developed a strategic approach to drive the successful delivery of cloud-enabled business transformations, including ERP. The approach pairs Bain’s services in C-suite advisory and strategic implementation with SAP’s market-leading expertise in software and cloud solutions to help executives maximize the impact of enterprise technology investments. Through their combined expertise, the companies aim to help clients achieve their business goals faster and achieve full ERP potential.\n\n“While technology is at the heart of every strategic enterprise transformation, Bain’s research shows that large transformations have higher rates of failure,” said Eric Garton, senior partner and head of Global Capabilities at Bain. “As companies are faced with the pressures of having to continuously modernize their business models, leaders will need to invest in tech effectively to succeed. Bain and SAP will address and help solve the complex roadblocks that stand between clients and successful end-to-end solutions, while accelerating results.”\n\nBain and SAP’s joint capabilities will enable clients to create a strategic technology vision, future-proof their technology infrastructure and orchestrate adoption across the organization.\n\n“Together with Bain & Company, we’re confident in the impact that this new framework will provide to customers,” said Scott Russell, Member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, Customer Success. “The power of setting the right transformation vision combined with proven process improvement methodology lays the foundation for technology that makes impact and scales with an enterprise.”\n\nMedia contacts\n\nTo arrange an interview or for any questions, please contact:\n\nBain & Company:\n\nKatie Ware (New York) — Email: katie.ware@bain.com\n\nGary Duncan (London) — Email: gary.duncan@bain.com"
