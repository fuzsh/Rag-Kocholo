        "text": "SAP system consists of a number of fully integrated modules, which covers virtually every aspect of business management. SAP is #1 in the ERP market. As of 2010, SAP has more than 140,000 installations worldwide, over 25 industry-specific business solutions and more than 75,000 customers in 120 countries. Other Competitive products of SAP Software in the market are Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, etc.\n\nWhat is SAP ERP? Why is it Required?\n\nThe following video will explain the need for an ERP software like SAP in an enterprise\n\nClick here if the video is not accessible\n\nThe very fundamental question for any beginners is why Enterprise Resource Planning also called ERP, is required? To answer this, let’s examine this typical business scenario.\n\nSuppose a client approaches a sales team asking for a particular product. The sales team contacts the inventory department to check the availability of the product. To their surprise, the sales team found out that the product is out of stock. So next time this doesn’t happen, they have to introduce an SAP ERP tool.\n\nBefore we actually see in detail, what ERP is and how ERP can help in your business process, we will understand how different departments are involved in the whole business process, right from the ordering of the raw material – to manufacturing goods – to delivering final products to the customer.\n\nHere is the whole process that is followed by any business unit.\n\nClient contacts the sales team to check the availability of the product\n\nSales team approaches the Inventory department to check for the availability of the product\n\nIn case the product is out of stock, the sales team approaches the Production Planning Department to manufacture the product\n\nThe production planning team checks with inventory department for availability of raw material\n\nIf the raw material is not available with inventory, the Production Planning team buys the raw material from the Vendors\n\nThen Production Planning forwards the raw materials to the Shop Floor Execution for actual production\n\nOnce ready, the Shop Floor Team sends the goods to the Sales Team\n\nSales Team who in turn deliver it to the client\n\nThe sales team updates the finance with revenue generated by the sale of the product. Production planning team update the finance with payments to be made to different vendors for raw materials.\n\nAll departments approach the HR for any Human Resource related issue.\n\nThat is a typical business process for any manufacturing company. Some key inferences one could derive from the scenario would be.\n\nIt has many departments or business units\n\nThese departments or business units continuously communicate and exchange data with each other\n\nThe success of any organization lies in effective communication, and data exchange, within these departments, as well as associated third party such as vendors, outsourcers, and customers.\n\nBased on the manner in which communication and data exchanged is managed. Enterprise systems can be broadly classified as\n\n1) Decentralized System\n\n2) Centralized System which is also called as ERP\n\nDecentralized System\n\nLet’s look at Decentralized system first, in a company with Decentralized System of Data Management. There are two major problems –\n\nData is maintained locally at the individual departments\n\nDepartments do not have access to information or data from other departments\n\nTo identify issues arising due to decentralized Enterprise management system lets look at the same business process again. The customer approaches the sales team for a product, but this time around, he needs the product, on an urgent basis.\n\nSince it is a decentralized process, the Sales Team do not have any real-time information access to the productavailability. So they approach the Inventory department to check the availability of the product. This process takes time, and the customer chooses another vendor leading to loss of revenue and customer dissatisfaction.\n\nNow, suppose the product is out of stock, and the Sales Team approaches the Production Planning team to manufacture the product for future use. Production Planning Team checks the availability of the raw materials required.\n\nIn a decentralized system, raw material information is stored separately by Production Planning as well as the Inventory Department. Thus, data maintenance cost (in this case, Raw Material) goes up.\n\nThe raw material information is available in two different departments Inventory as well as Production Planning. When sales team check a particular raw material required to manufacture the product, it shows the raw material is available as per the inventory, but as per the database of the production planning team, the raw material is out of stock.\n\nSo, they go ahead and buy the raw material. Thus, material, as well as inventory cost, goes up.\n\nOnce the raw material is available, the shop floor department suddenly realizes they are short of workers. They approach the HR, who in turn hire temporary employees at higher than market rates. Thus LABOR Cost Increases.\n\nThe production planning department fails to update the finance department on the materials they have purchased. The finance department defaults the payment deadline set by the vendor causing the company loss of its reputation and even inviting a possible legal action.\n\nThese are just a few of many problems with decentralized systems.\n\nSome Major problems with the decentralized system are –\n\nNumerous disparate information systems created individually over time which are difficult to maintain\n\nIntegrating the data is time and money consuming\n\nInconsistencies and duplication of data\n\nLack of timely information leads to customer dissatisfaction, loss of revenue and reputation\n\nHigh Inventory, material, and human resource cost.\n\nThese are some major drawbacks for which we need a solution. Well, the Solution lies in Centralized Systems i.e., ERP.\n\nCentralized System\n\nIn a company, with a Centralized System of Information and Data Management.\n\n1) Data is maintained at a central location and is shared with various Departments\n\n2) Departments have access to information or data from other Departments\n\nLet’s look at the same business process again to understand how a Centralized Enterprise System helps to overcome problems posed by a Decentralized Enterprise System.\n\nIn this case, all departments update a Central Information System.\n\nWhen Customer approaches the sales team to buy a product on an urgent basis. The Sales Team has real-time information access to the products in inventory which is updated by the Inventory Department in the Centralized System\n\nSales Team respond to customer request on time, leading to Increased Revenue and Customer Delight.\n\nIn case, manufacturing is required the Sales Team update the Centralized Database, so that all the department remain informed about the product status.\n\nProduction Planning Department is auto updated by the Centralized Database for requirements. Production Planning Team checks the availability of the raw materials required via the Central Database, which is updated by the Inventory Department.\n\nThus, Data Duplication is avoided, and accurate data is made available. The Shop Floor Team update their Man Power Status regularly in the Central Database, which can be accessed by the HR department.\n\nIn case of shortage of workforce, HR team starts the recruitment process with considerable lead time to hire a suitable candidate at market price. Thus labor cost goes down.\n\nWhile vendors can directly submit their invoices to the Central Enterprise System, which can be accessed by the finance department. Thus, payments are made on time, and possible legal actions are avoided\n\nSAP software is a type of Centralized System. SAP Systems are the most popularly used in ERP software.\n\nKey benefits of the Centralized System"
