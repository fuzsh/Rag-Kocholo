        "text": "SAP S/4HANA opens up completely new possibilities for companies: Among other things, they generate added value with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT) and benefit from real-time analytics. SAP S/4HANA integrates seamlessly with business networks and solutions from other software providers. The software forms the basis for making the right decisions at the right time. SAP S/4HANA is based on the SAP HANA in-memory platform and is available both on-premise and in the cloud.\n\nSooner or later, your company will also be faced with the task of successfully making the transition to SAP S/4 HANA. Unfortunately, many long-standing SAP ERP customers underestimate the challenges involved and the complexity of an SAP S/4HANA project.\n\nEven before the changeover, a multitude of questions need to be answered:\n\nHow do I handle my custom code, i.e., custom developments?\n\nHow can I optimally manage my new SAP S/4HANA system landscape?\n\nWhat downtimes should I expect during the final system changeover (go-live)?\n\nHow long will my code freeze (development stop) last before the changeover and what should I bear in mind?\n\nWhat data must or should be cleaned up and archived as part of housekeeping?\n\nWhat does my new role and authorization concept look like and how do I bring my users into the new system?\n\nHow do I ensure that my new SAP S/4HANA system meets current security requirements?\n\nWhat (technical) requirements do I have to meet in order to convert?\n\nWhich transactions no longer exist in SAP S/4HANA and which will be replaced?\n\nWhat does my SAP Fiori strategy look like?\n\nHow do I deal with my interfaces?\n\nWe will find the right answers to all these questions together with you.\n\nThe options for switching to SAP S/4HANA are as diverse as the SAP user companies. Many SAP customers have not just one, but several SAP ERP systems in use. SAP S/4HANA offers the possibility of merging the individual systems into a uniform system. Often, certain parts of the existing data are to be retained after the changeover to SAP S/4HANA, while other data is not to be taken along.\n\nRequirements of this type are addressed by the greyfield approach, in which the existing landscape is renewed and streamlined (analogous to the greenfield approach), but existing data is partially transferred (see brownfield approach). Greyfield thus represents a mixture of a new implementation and a system conversion.\n\nWith the combination of greenfield and brownfield, companies benefit from advantages such as system streamlining and standardization. At the same time, they do not have to part with all their existing data if they do not see any advantages in doing so."
