Bats Foundation Repair is your best solution to foundation and structural repair issues in Austin. Â We are a locally owned and operated business here to serve your needs. Â Â

Bats Foundation Repair is dedicated to offering uncompromising customer service based upon respect, honesty, and integrity. Â We are members of the Better Business Bureau, and we have over 40 years of combined experience dedicated to foundation repair. Bats Foundation Repair offers a solution to your home's structural needs serving all of Austin and Central Texas.

Bats Foundation Repair maintains one of the best warranties in the industry. Simply put, the piers we install are covered for the lifetime of the structure.

For steel piers, if any adjustments are required during the life of the home due to settling, Bats Foundation Repair will adjust all piered areas at no cost to the homeowner. Our concrete piers are still covered by a lifetime warranty and have zero adjustment charges for the first five years. After five years, there is a nominal adjustment charge.

If you have any more questions on the fine print, feel free to give us a call and we can go over this with you.
