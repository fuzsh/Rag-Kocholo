A veritable dinosaur among IT systems

The SAP R/3 system used to date had been in place for more than 20 years. Not only had a large number of process variations been developed during that time, but the SFS Group has also become significantly larger, more international and more complex over those many years. On top of that, the software provider will only continue to offer support for the R/3 system for a few more years. All these factors prompted us to make the switch to the new version SAP S/4 HANA. This change will enable the SFS Group to

implement the most recent system line for all business processes,

replace the two SAP instances previously in use with a single instance,

reduce the complexity that had arisen over the past 20 years and standardize processes around the globe and

increase efficiency and remain competitive.

80 years of work

With a great deal of passion and commitment and in collaboration with a consulting firm, the in-house project team kicked off efforts to switch to SAP S/4 HANA in August 2020. After a slight delay, the system for the D&L Switzerland division as well as for the Finance departments of another 28 companies in a total of 27 countries successfully went live on the weekend of September 5, 2022.

Majority of project objectives reached

The tremendous efforts of numerous SFS employees over the past few months and years have enabled SFS to lay the foundation for ERP business processes for the next 20 years. From a project perspective, most of the objectives defined by the Group Executive Board were reached during the two-year project phase:

Deliveries to customers could continue unhampered

In-house programming by the IT department was cut by 30%, reducing both time and labor as well as the amount of maintenance required in the future

The processes were standardized to a high degree

The merging of two SAP systems into a single system has cleared its first hurdle

The quality of the financial statements can be maintained in a timely manner

The migration of business processes in other SFS Group divisions is currently in the planning phase and will be implemented in the next few years.
