Aug. 30, 1794, Newark, N.J. - d. Oct. 31, 1848, St. Louis, Mo.), governor of New Mexico (1846).\n\nKeat Chhon (b. Aug. 11, 1934, Chhlong, Kratie province, Cambodia), finance minister of Cambodia (1994-2013). He was also minister of industry and commerce (1967-69), chairman of the National Investment Committee (1993), a deputy prime minister (1993, 2008-13), minister of state for rehabilitation and development (1993-94), and permanent deputy prime minister (2013-16).\n\nKeating, Colin, New Zealand diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1993-96).\n\nF. Keating\n\nKeating, Frank, byname of Francis Anthony Keating II (b. Feb. 10, 1944, St. Louis, Mo.), governor of Oklahoma (1995-2003). A Republican, he was elected to the Oklahoma House (1972) and to the Oklahoma Senate (1974), where he became minority leader. In 1981, he became U.S. attorney in Tulsa, in 1986, assistant treasury secretary, in 1988, associate attorney general - all posts overseeing law enforcement agencies. After that, he went on to be Jack Kemp's general counsel at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. After Senate Democrats refused to act on Pres. George Bush's nomination of him for a federal judgeship, he returned to Oklahoma in 1993 to enter the 1994 gubernatorial election, clearly the party leaders' choice; he was peppered in the primary by state senator Jerry Pierce's charges that he had been out of town too long, but won 57%-29%. The leading Democrat, Lt.Gov. Jack Mildren, failed to get an absolute majority in his primary and was forced into a September runoff, which he won with 59%. Mildren had an additional problem, the independent candidacy of Wes Watkins, former Democratic congressman from Little Dixie. Mildren led right after the primary, but by October, the polls showed something close to an even three-way race. In the final weeks, Keating zoomed ahead. He won 47% of the votes to 30% for Mildren and 23% for Watkins. He had wide margins in the metropolitan areas - 58%-27% over Mildren in Oklahoma City, 60%-27% in Tulsa. He performed with aplomb after the April 19, 1995, bomb leveled the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City. He appeared on the news virtually round-the-clock, and coordinated efforts of federal, state, and local officials in the rescue, recovery, and investigative operations.\n\nP. (J.) Keating\n\nKeating, Paul (John) (b. Jan. 18, 1944, Sydney, N.S.W.), prime minister of Australia (1991-96). His background as an industrial advocate with the Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union led him into Labor politics. Elected to the House of Representatives for Blaxland in 1969, he was president (1979-83) of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and was opposition spokesman on a number of different matters. Acquiring a reputation for sparkling political invective and party loyalty, he was chosen by Prime Minister Bob Hawke to be federal treasurer in 1983. He made his mark with a sometimes bizarre blend of earthy attacks on his opponents and high-level explanations and lectures on the more arcane aspects of economics. He appeared to have the capacity, single-handedly, to both damage and restore the economy. When he described Australia in 1986 as heading for \"banana republic\" status, support for the economy evaporated almost overnight. He recovered to be the architect of a shaky turnaround. As a reward for his loyalty and in recognition of his key role in the 1987 ALP election victory, Hawke unequivocally pronounced Keating as the man he would most like to have follow him as leader. Hawke decided to stay on beyond the 1990 election, but resigned in December 1991, following a party room decision which Keating largely engineered (before Hawke became, in Keating's words, as old as Methuselah). Keating at 47 became the youngest prime minister in Australia's history. He set forth a bold vision of Australia eventually becoming a republic, and he established links with Asia and the U.S. while largely ignoring European affairs. He led the ALP to another election victory in 1993 but was defeated in 1996.\n\nKeating, Paul (John Geoffrey) (b. Aug. 13, 1924 - d. March 13, 1980), Irish diplomat. He was ambassador to Nigeria (1968-70), West Germany (1970-72), and the United Kingdom (1977-78) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1978-80).\n\nKeatinge, Richard Harte (b. June 17, 1825 - d. May 26, 1904), chief commissioner of Ajmer-Merwara (1871-73) and Assam (1874-78).\n\nKebich, Vyachaslau (Frantsavich), Russian Vyacheslav (Frantsevich) Kebich (b. June 10, 1936, Wiszniew, Poland [now Vishnevo, Valozhyn district, Minsk voblast, Belarus] - d. Dec. 9, 2020), chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Belorussian S.S.R./Belarus (1990-94). He was also chairman of the State Planning Committee and a deputy premier (1985-90).\n\nKébreau, Antonio Thrasybule (b. Nov. 11, 1909, Port-au-Prince, Haiti - d. Jan. 13, 1963, Port-au-Prince), chairman of the Military Council of Haiti (1957). He was also army chief of staff (1957-58) and ambassador to the Vatican (1959-60) and Italy (1961-62).\n\nKebzabo\n\nKebzabo, Saleh (b. March 27, 1947, Léré, Chad), foreign minister (1996-97) and prime minister (2022-24) of Chad. He was also minister of commerce and industrial development (1993), public works, transportation, housing, and urban development (1997-98), mines, energy, and oil (1998), and agriculture (1999-2001) and a presidential candidate (1996, 2001, 2016, 2021).\n\nKecmanovic, Vojislav, byname Djedo (b. 1881, Knespolje, Ottoman Empire [now in Bosnia and Herzegovina] - d. March 25, 1961, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina), chairman of the Anti-Fascist Council of People's Liberation (1943-45) and president of the Presidium of the People's Assembly (1945-46) of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nKedikilwe, Ponatshego (Honorius Kefhaeng) (b.

June 4, 1915, Bamako, French Sudan [now Mali] - d. May 16, 1977, Bamako), prime minister and head of state of Mali (1960-68). After World War II he was co-founder and secretary-general of the Sudanese Union, which in 1946 merged with the African Democratic Rally. The combined US-RDA became the leading party in French Sudan. Considered a dangerous anti-colonialist by the French, he was briefly imprisoned in 1946, but two years later he won a seat in the territorial assembly and in 1956-58 served as a deputy in the French National Assembly, becoming its first African vice president and holding a cabinet post in two French governments. Meanwhile, he had become president of the US-RDA and also mayor of the capital Bamako. In the crucial elections of 1957 his party won an overwhelming victory. In the 1958 referendum in which the West African territories had to choose between internal autonomy within the French Community and immediate isolated independence, he successfully campaigned for the community. Eager for a West African federation of former French territories, he could not combat the strong centrifugal forces at work among the soon-to-be-independent nations, especially in wealthy Ivory Coast. He finally settled for a Mali Federation made up only of Senegal and his own Sudan. He became prime minister of the short-lived federation, which could not even agree on a unitary or federal structure and which was also plagued with personality conflicts. When the two territories separated in 1960, he remained president of the government of the Sudan, which then took the name of Mali. He was also foreign minister in 1960-61. He was overthrown in a bloodless coup led by junior army officers on Nov. 19, 1968, and spent the remainder of his life in detention.\n\nM. Keita\n\nKeitel\n\nKeita, Modibo (b. July 31, 1942, Koulikoro, French Sudan [now Mali] - d. Jan. 2, 2021), foreign minister (1986-89) and prime minister (2002, 2015-17) of Mali.

Aug. 16, 1968, Siwani, Haryana, India), chief minister of Delhi (2013-14, 2015- ). He was a backroom manager of India's most popular anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare, who rallied Indians and rattled the government in nationwide protests and hunger strikes in 2011 to push for a powerful ombudsman who could fight corruption. When these protests did not have the desired effect, Kejriwal broke away from Hazare and prepared to launch a political party. The Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party was accordingly launched in November 2012. In the 2013 elections in Delhi, the AAP won 28 of 70 seats and he formed a government with Congress support. He resigned within months, however, after Congress blocked a bill to establish an anti-corruption ombudsman. In 2014 he ran for a seat in the Lok Sabha (Indian lower house) for Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, but was defeated by Narendra Modi, the prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (who became prime minister). In the next elections in Delhi, in 2015, he won a landslide victory with 67 of 70 seats. But the party soon found itself in disarray, beset with personality clashes and competing ambitions. With the AAP's national ambitions having taken a big hit following a series of electoral reverses, he sought to mend fences with Congress in 2018 so as to play a role in an anti-BJP grouping.\n\nKeke, Joseph (Adjognon) (b. Dec. 5, 1927, Avrankou, near Porto-Novo, Dahomey [now Benin] - d. July 1, 2017), justice minister of Dahomey (1960-63). He was also minister of economy and planning (1970-72).\n\nK.

He was also people's commissar of local industry of the Kalmyk A.S.S.R. (193...-37).\n\nKekkonen\n\nKekkonen, Urho (Kaleva) (b. Sept. 3, 1900, Pielavesi, Finland - d. Aug. 31, 1986, Helsinki, Finland), prime minister (1950-53, 1954-56) and president (1956-82) of Finland. At age 17 he fought against the Bolsheviks in Finland's war of independence. From the 1920s he became increasingly involved in the agrarian movement and he was a civil servant in the Ministry of Agriculture in 1927-32. He was a member of parliament for the Agrarian Party (later renamed the Centre Party) in 1936-56 and served as speaker in 1948-50. He was minister of justice (1936-37, 1944-47) and interior (1937-39). A devout nationalist, he took responsibility for the resettlement in Finland of 300,000 Karelians ejected from the U.S.S.R. during the Winter War of 1939-40. In 1940 he was one of only two members of parliament to vote against ceding any Finnish territory to the U.S.S.R. By 1943, however, recognizing that Germany would lose the war, he concluded that a policy of friendly neutrality toward the Soviet Union was Finland's only hope for national salvation. In 1944 he joined the government of Prime Minister Juho Kusti Paasikivi and was a key negotiator in the controversial trials of war criminals. In 1950 he unsuccessfully ran for president, but became prime minister. He served in several coalitions, and was also interior minister (1950-51) and foreign minister (1952-53, 1954). In 1956 he was elected president. The friendly foreign policy vis-à-vis the Soviet Union came to be called the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line. The word Finlandization was coined to depict the situation of a country that is overly compliant to the wishes of a powerful neighbour. Kekkonen continued to be reelected (1962, 1968, 1978); in 1973 parliament extended his third six-year term by an extra four years. An incapacitating illness forced his retirement in 1981.\n\nKelani, Haissam (b. Aug. 6, 1926, Hama, Syria), Syrian diplomat.

Oct. 24, 1911, Kansas City, Mo. - d. Aug. 5, 1997, Kansas City, Mo.), director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1973-78). He joined the FBI fresh out of college in 1940, left to become chief of police in Kansas City in 1961, and was nominated to head the agency by Pres. Richard Nixon in 1973. He inherited an agency shaken by Watergate and in transition after the death of J. Edgar Hoover a year earlier. Kelley survived a minor scandal of his own in 1976, when Pres. Gerald R. Ford announced he would keep Kelley as FBI director despite disclosures that he had accepted window drapery valances and a small cabinet from senior FBI officials for his home. The gifts became an issue in Ford's failed reelection campaign. Kelley brought modern techniques for crime fighting to the bureau and changed its focus to white-collar and organized crime. He served until 1978, when he was succeeded by William H. Webster.\n\nKëllezi, Abdyl (b. Aug. 20, 1919, Tiranë, Albania - d. [executed] May 1977, Tiranë), finance minister of Albania (1948-53, 1954-56).

Dec. 22, 1856, Potsdam, N.Y. - d. Dec. 21, 1937, St. Paul, Minn.), U.S. secretary of state (1925-29). He was also a Republican U.S. senator from Minnesota (1917-23) and ambassador to the United Kingdom (1924-25). The 1928 international agreement renouncing war as an instrument of international policy became known as the \"Kellogg Pact.\" In 1930 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1929.\n\nKellogg, William P(itt) (b. Dec. 8, 1830, Orwell, Vt. - d. Aug. 10, 1918, Washington, D.C.), governor of Louisiana (1873-77).\n\nKelly, Edward Joseph (b. May 1, 1876, Chicago, Ill. - d. Oct. 20, 1950, Chicago), U.S. politician. As chief engineer of the Chicago sanitary district during the 1920s Kelly became a friend of Patrick Nash, sewer contractor, who eventually became the other half of what was widely known as Chicago's Kelly-Nash machine - the Democratic political organization of Cook county. Kelly became mayor of Chicago in 1933 when the Chicago city council elected him to replace Mayor Anton Cermak, who had been assassinated by a bullet intended for President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was elected almost without opposition in 1935, 1939, and in 1943, refusing to run again in 1947. He played a leading role in the Democratic conventions that nominated Roosevelt for his second, third, and fourth terms. Kelly reduced Chicago's debt by $100,000,000 and left the city solvent. He was viewed by many as the prototype of the U.S. big-city political boss - and himself admitted that \"to be a real mayor... you've got to be a boss.\"\n\nKelly, Harry F(rancis) (b.

Kelly\n\nKelly, Petra (Karin), née Lehmann (b. Nov. 29, 1947, Günzburg, Bayern, Germany - found dead Oct. 19, 1992, Bonn, Germany), German politician. She took the name of her mother's second husband, a colonel in the U.S. Army. When she was 13 she went with her parents to the U.S., where she became involved in the protest culture that swept the country during the 1960s, taking part in antiwar and civil rights demonstrations. She worked on the political staffs of both Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy. After her return to Europe she became an official at the European Communities in Brussels and a member of the West German Social Democratic Party (SPD). But her political credo was far to the left of the SPD and made her instead a natural stalwart of the Greens. She was a tireless campaigner against nuclear weapons, nuclear power, and the \"destructive pursuit of economic growth.\" She described the Greens as the \"anti-party party\" and insisted that they would lose their real function and their appeal should they develop into a political party like any other. Her nightmare, as she once put it, was that the Greens would one day poll so many votes that they would have to play a role in government. The Greens wanted the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Western Europe and the withdrawal of the two German nations from their respective multinational pacts. The Greens adhered strictly to a system of rotating leadership, as a result of which she stepped down from the federal chairmanship of the party in 1982. Since the early 1980s, she had been involved with Gert Bastian, an army general who had resigned his commission and had become active in Green politics; their bodies were found about three weeks after Bastian, without explanation, apparently shot Kelly and then himself.\n\nKelsen, Hans (b.

Oct. 11, 1950, Panueli village, Savo island, Central province, Solomon Islands), prime minister of the Solomon Islands (2001-06). Elected to parliament in 1989, he was minister for police and justice (1989-90), housing and government services (1990-93), forests, environment, and conservation (1995-96), national unity, reconciliation, and peace (also deputy prime minister; 2000-01), and forestry (2007-08). He was knighted in June 2001. In August 2001 he was sacked as deputy prime minister over financial irregularities. Nevertheless his People's Alliance Party became the largest party in the December 2001 elections and he formed a government. His tenure as prime minister was a period of great turmoil when militant forces from Guadalcanal and Malaita caused disarray and stopped the already shaky government from functioning. He made the initial move for the intervention by the Pacific Forum-sponsored and Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in mid-2003. In 2007 he was found guilty of ordering a 2002 raid on a Honiara law firm to try to scare Australian lawyers out of the country. In 2008 he was sentenced to six months in jail; he was released Dec. 31, 2008. In 2010-14 he was speaker of parliament.

He was a volunteer in Richard Nixon's presidential campaigns and a special assistant to Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California. In 1970 Kemp capitalized on his football fame to be elected to Congress as a conservative Republican representing suburban Buffalo. He became known for his defense of the Vietnam War and promotion of civil rights initiatives. While in Congress he was a member of the Budget Committee and served as chair of the Republican House Conference. Kemp was an early and forceful advocate of \"supply side\" economics - the theory that lower taxes will stimulate the economy and boost productivity, thereby creating jobs and increasing tax revenue by drawing from a broader base. The Kemp-Roth bill became a cornerstone of President Reagan's economic policy. But Kemp believed the president's advisers lacked the courage to stick with it through the recession. In 1982 he found himself bitterly at odds with the White House that had adopted his economic policy only a year earlier. He ran unsuccessfully for his party's presidential nomination in 1988. On Dec. 19, 1988, he was named by President-elect George Bush to the post of secretary of housing and urban development (HUD), and was unanimously approved by the Senate on Feb. 2, 1989, serving until 1993. He stepped into the limelight on Aug. 10, 1996, when Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole announced that Kemp would be his running mate. Kemp had squared off against Dole in the 1988 presidential primaries, and they were known to be adversaries on several issues. Nonetheless, the two set aside differences and focused on like goals under the motto \"Unity does not require unanimity.\"\n\nKempenaer, Jacobus Mattheüs de (b. July 6, 1793, Amsterdam, Netherlands - d. Feb. 12, 1870, Arnhem, Netherlands), interior minister of the Netherlands (1848-49).\n\nKemper, James L(awson) (b. June 11, 1823, Madison county, Va. - d.

July 19, 1920, Lazy-Orlová, Karviná district, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic] - d. Nov. 25, 1996, Prague), prime minister of the Czech Socialist Republic (1969-70). He was also a deputy premier of Czechoslovakia (1969-70).\n\nKempthorne\n\nKempthorne, Dirk (Arthur) (b. Oct. 29, 1951, San Diego, Calif.), governor of Idaho (1999-2006) and U.S. interior secretary (2006-09). He spent seven years as mayor of Boise (1986-93). In 1992, he was selected to replace GOP Sen. Steve Symms, who chose not to run again. In the Senate, Kempthorne fought against unfunded federal mandates and was considered one of the most conservative of senators. He left the U.S. Senate to win Idaho's 1998 governor's race. A protégé of retiring Republican governor Phil Batt, he frustrated Democrat Robert Huntley and independent Peter Rickards by waging his seven-month campaign mostly from Washington. Kempthorne won 68% of the vote, drawing solid majorities from men and women, young and old, and the rich, middle-income, and poor. He not only claimed Idaho's traditional GOP majority but a quarter of voters identifying themselves as Democrats.\n\nKen (Stephen), Don (b. June 6, 1960), justice minister of Vanuatu (2018-20). He has also been minister of youth development and training (2008), health (2010-11, 2012-13), cooperatives and ni-Vanuatu business development (2011, 2011-12), youth and sport (2014-15), infrastructure and public utilities (2015-16), and public utilities (2023- ).\n\nKendall, Charles Brian (b.

Jan. 27, 1943, Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands), Marshall Islands politician. He served as senator from Majuro and minister of internal affairs until 1986 when he became Marshall Islands ambassador to the United States until 1995. He was elected senator from Majuro again in 1995 and 1999, obtaining the most votes ever cast for a senatorial candidate in the country's history. In 1998-2000 he was justice minister and in 2000-08 minister of education.\n\nKendrew, Sir Douglas (Anthony), early byname Joe Kendrew (b. July 22, 1910, Barnstaple, Devon, England - d. Feb. 28, 1989, Northamptonshire, England), governor of Western Australia (1963-73); knighted 1963.\n\nKendrick, John B(enjamin) (b. Sept. 6, 1857, Cherokee county, Texas - d. Nov. 3, 1933, Sheridan, Wyo.), governor of Wyoming (1915-17). He was also a U.S. senator from Wyoming (1917-33).\n\nKeneally\n\nKeneally, Kristina (Kerscher), née Kerscher (b. Dec. 19, 1968, Las Vegas, Nev.), premier of New South Wales (2009-11).\n\nKengo\n\nKengo wa Dondo, (Joseph Léon), original name (until 1971) (Joseph) Léon Lubicz (b. May 22, 1935, Libenge, Équateur province, Belgian Congo [now in Sud-Ubangi province, Congo (Kinshasa)]), Zairian/Congo (Kinshasa) politician. The son of a Polish father and Tutsi mother, he served under Pres. Mobutu Sese Seko on numerous occasions. He was justice minister (1979-80), ambassador to Belgium (1980-82), prime minister (1982-86, 1988-90), and foreign minister (1986-87), before the transition from one-party rule. He came back as prime minister in 1994 when he was elected by a newly installed majority in the transitional parliament. He was said to have been a consensus candidate who, unlike Mobutu's radical opponent Étienne Tshisekedi, could work with Zaire's all-powerful ruler. His post remained bitterly contested by Tshisekedi, who since being shunted aside in favour of a Mobutu appointee in 1993 claimed to be the only legitimate prime minister elected by a sovereign national conference. He also had many enemies in the president's entourage, especially among those who profited from the country's diamond trade. They were financially damaged in 1994 when Kengo expelled members of the Lebanese community who he accused of oiling the motor of the illicit trade. Mobutu in December 1996 named Kengo as the head of a new crisis cabinet to guide the war effort to retake land from ethnic Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire. Kengo's enemies exploited his part-Tutsi origins to promote popular hatred of the premier. They argued he was not Zairian and so unqualified to lead the country in the war against ethnic Tutsi rebels said to be backed by Tutsi-led armies in neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi. He resigned on March 24, 1997, after Mobutu supported a parliamentary vote of no confidence against him. His downfall came because in political circles he was seen as responsible for the failure of the Zairian army to stop rebel advances. He went into exile in Brussels after Mobutu's fall in May 1997. Charged at the Congolese government's demand with money laundering in June 2003, he returned on Nov. 16, 2003. He was president of the Senate in 2007-19.\n\nKenilorea\n\nKenilorea, Sir Peter (Kauona Keninaraisoona) (b. May 23, 1943, Takataka village, Malaita island, Solomon Islands - d. Feb. 25, 2016, Honiara, Solomon Islands), prime minister of the Solomon Islands (1978-81, 1984-86). From 1968 to 1976 he worked in the civil service as a teacher at King George VI Secondary School, as a district officer and district commissioner in the eastern Solomons, and for a brief period in 1974-75 as secretary to the chief minister. He tried to enter politics as a candidate from Honiara in 1973 but had to wait until June 1976 when he was elected from East 'Are 'Are on Malaita. Soon afterward, after the resignation from politics of Solomon Mamaloni, the man who had seemed destined to be the Islands' first prime minister, Kenilorea, backed by other former public servants in parliament, was chosen as chief minister in his place. In that capacity he led the teams that negotiated both the independence constitution and a financial settlement of $43 million for the Solomons. On July 7, 1978, full independence was achieved, and Kenilorea became prime minister and responsible for foreign affairs. He faced various problems. The Solomons lacked cultural unity, and there was an active secessionist movement in the west; there was not a high level of political awareness among the populace, and there was little enthusiasm for independence in some quarters. There was also a bitter controversy over the granting of citizenship to migrant groups. He was knighted in 1982. In 1988-89 and 1990-92 he was foreign minister. From December 2001 to September 2010 he was speaker of parliament.\n\nKenins, Atis (b. July 28, 1874, Grencu parish, Russia [now in Latvia] - d. March 9, 1961, Riga, Latvian S.S.R.), Latvian politician. He was minister of justice (1931-33) and education (1931-33).\n\nKennan\n\nKennan, George (Frost) (b. Feb. 16, 1904, Milwaukee, Wis. - d. March 17, 2005, Princeton, N.J.), U.S. diplomat. He entered the consular service in 1925, holding posts in Geneva, Hamburg, and Tallinn. In 1933 he accompanied Ambassador William Bullitt to Moscow when the U.S. embassy there reopened. Recalled to Washington in 1937, he spent a year in the State Department before being sent to Prague, where he arrived on Sept. 29, 1938, the day Britain and France signed Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region over to Germany. After a year he was sent to Berlin, where he served as second, then as first secretary to the ambassador. After the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941, Kennan was interned for five months, being repatriated to the U.S. in May 1942. He was then assigned to Lisbon, and from 1944 to 1946 he served as minister-counselor for the U.S. embassy in Moscow. In 1947 Secretary of State George C. Marshall named Kennan director of the State Department's policy planning staff. In that position he oversaw a shift in policy toward the Soviet Union, advocating containment after the wartime years of appeasement (he laid out this policy in an article in Foreign Affairs in July 1947 under the name \"Mr. X\"). In 1949 he became one of Secretary of State Dean Acheson's principal advisers. Returning again to Moscow in 1952, he became U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, but remarks he made during a trip to Berlin that September (when he said that the isolation of a foreign diplomat in Moscow in 1952 was worse than he had experienced in 1941-42 as an interned diplomat in Germany) made him a persona non grata with the Soviets. He left the Foreign Service in 1953, except for a brief return in 1961-63 as ambassador to Yugoslavia.\n\nKennedy, Sir Arthur Edward (b. April 9, 1810, Cultra, County Down, Ireland - d. June 3, 1883, at sea off the coast of Aden), governor of Gambia (1851-52), Sierra Leone (1852-54, 1868-72), Western Australia (1855-62), Vancouver Island (1864-66), Hong Kong (1872-77), and Queensland (1877-83); knighted 1868.\n\nKennedy, Caroline (Bouvier) (b. Nov. 27, 1957, New York City), U.S. diplomat; daughter of John F. Kennedy. She was ambassador to Japan (2013-17). In 2021 she was nominated ambassador to Australia.\n\nC. Kennedy\n\nKennedy, Charles (Peter) (b. Nov. 25, 1959, Inverness, Scotland - d. June 1, 2015, Fort William, Scotland), British politician. He stood in the 1983 general election as candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the \"hopeless\" constituency of Ross, Cromarty and Skye. To widespread astonishment, not least his own, the 23-year-old Kennedy captured the seat from the Conservatives, and entered Parliament as its youngest member. He soon became one of the SDP's most regular performers on radio and television. The majority of the SDP decided in 1988 to merge with the Liberal Party against the wishes of the party's leader, David Owen, but Kennedy stood aside as a potential interim leader of the SDP's pro-merger faction to back Robert Maclennan - ruling himself out as well as a possible leader of the newly merged party, the Liberal Democrats. He became its spokesperson on trade and industry (1988-89), health (1989-92), Europe and East-West relations (1992-97), and agriculture and rural affairs (1997-99). In 1990 he was elected to the titular post of party president, which he held for four years. In January 1999 Paddy Ashdown, who had led the party since 1988, announced that he would step down that summer. Although not as close personally to Prime Minister Tony Blair of the Labour Party as Ashdown had been, Kennedy was effectively the continuity candidate, promising to continue Ashdown's strategy of working closely with Labour on some issues, while opposing it on others. His main contender for the post, Simon Hughes, wanted the party to revert to the traditional Liberal posture of equal hostility to Labour and the Conservatives. In a closely fought contest, the result of which was announced on August 9, Kennedy defeated Hughes on the fourth count, after the other three candidates had been eliminated, by 57%-43%. In 2005 the Liberal Democrats under his leadership won 62 seats, their highest number since 1929. He resigned in 2006 after admitting to a drinking problem. He lost his seat when the Liberal Democrats collapsed in the 2015 election.\n\nD.M. Kennedy\n\nKennedy, David M(atthew) (b. July 21, 1905, Randolph, Utah - d. May 1, 1996, Salt Lake City, Utah), U.S. secretary of the treasury (1969-71). After his two years as treasury secretary, he served two years as U.S. ambassador at large, with cabinet rank, and was U.S. ambassador to NATO from 1972 to 1973.\n\nKennedy, Donald (b. Aug. 18, 1931, New York City - d. April 21, 2020, Redwood City, Calif.), commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1977-79). He was also president of Stanford University (1980-92).\n\nKennedy, Eamonn (Lucas) (b. Dec. 13, 1921, Dublin, Ireland - d. Dec. 12, 2000, New York City), Irish diplomat. He was ambassador to Nigeria (1961-64), West Germany (1964-70), France (1970-74), the United Kingdom (1978-83), and Italy, Turkey, and Libya (1983-86) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1974-78).\n\nE.M. Kennedy\n\nKennedy, Edward M(oore), byname Ted Kennedy (b. Feb. 22, 1932, Boston, Mass. - d. Aug. 25, 2009, Hyannis Port, Mass.), U.S. politician; brother of John F. and Robert F. Kennedy; son of Joseph P. Kennedy; grandson of John Francis Fitzgerald. A Democrat, he was elected in 1962 to fill his brother John's former Senate seat representing Massachusetts; in 1964 he was first elected to a full six-year term, and he was reelected ever since. On July 18, 1969, he accidentally drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, and his passenger, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. In December 1978 Kennedy's differences with the Jimmy Carter administration were dramatically emphasized at the Democratic Party's midterm conference in Memphis, Tenn., when he delivered an impassioned speech for his national health insurance plan, which differed sharply from Carter's attempts to hold down federal government spending. Kennedy appealed to the traditionally liberal soul of the party, and his enthusiastic reception by the Democrats was a sharp contrast to their lukewarm response to Carter's austere program. A \"Draft Kennedy\" movement began in some early primary states, but without overt encouragement from the senator. The change in Kennedy's posture came after the 1979 energy crisis, when adverse reaction to the mass cabinet resignations shocked Democratic politicians and sent Carter's standing in the polls plummeting. On Nov. 7, 1979, Kennedy officially became the third member of his family to run for president of the United States. But his declaration coincided with the start of the Iranian hostage crisis, which drastically raised Carter's approval rating and made criticizing the president a touchy matter. Renewed speculation about Kennedy's role in the Chappaquiddick accident kept him from getting off to a running start. He withdrew from the race during the 1980 convention. He remained an influential champion of liberal causes in the Senate until his death.\n\nKennedy, Geoffrey (Alexander) (b. Sept. 6, 1931, Cottesloe, W.Aus. - d. July 16, 2012), acting governor of Western Australia (2000).\n\nJ.F. Kennedy\n\nKennedy, John F(itzgerald) (\"JFK\"), byname Jack Kennedy (b. May 29, 1917, Brookline, Mass. - d. Nov. 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas), president of the United States (1961-63); son of Joseph P. Kennedy; grandson of John Francis Fitzgerald. He served three terms in the House of Representatives (1947-53). In 1952 he successfully ran for the Senate against a popular incumbent, Henry Cabot Lodge. In 1958 his margin of victory was the largest ever in Massachusetts and the greatest of any senatorial candidate that year. In January 1960 he formally announced his presidential candidacy. Nominated on the first ballot, he declared in his acceptance speech, \"We stand on the edge of a New Frontier.\" The phrase New Frontier was to become attached to his programs. In the general election, he narrowly defeated the Republican candidate, Vice Pres. Richard M. Nixon. Kennedy was the youngest man and the first Roman Catholic ever elected U.S. president. In October 1962 a buildup of Soviet nuclear missiles was discovered in Cuba. Kennedy demanded that the missiles be dismantled; he ordered a blockade that would stop Soviet ships from reaching that island. For 13 days nuclear war seemed near; then the Soviet Union announced that the missiles would be withdrawn. In 1963, while he and his wife Jacqueline were in a motorcade riding slowly through downtown Dallas, Texas, in an open limousine, a sniper opened fire. Two rifle bullets struck the president, at the base of his neck and in the head. He was dead upon arrival at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old Dallas citizen, was accused of the slaying. Two days later Oswald was shot to death by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner, in the basement of the Dallas police station. A presidential commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren later found that Oswald had acted alone.\n\nKennedy, Sir John Noble (b. Aug. 31, 1893 - d. June 15, 1970), governor of Southern Rhodesia (1947-53); knighted 1945.\n\nKennedy, Joseph P(atrick) (b. Sept. 6, 1888, Boston, Mass. - d. Nov. 18, 1969, Hyannis Port, Mass.), U.S. official. He was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (1934-35) and the Maritime Commission (1937-38) and ambassador to the United Kingdom (1938-40).\n\nN. Kennedy\n\nKennedy, Nick, byname of Nicholas Joseph Kennedy, administrator of Ascension (2017-18).\n\nR.F. Kennedy\n\nKennedy, Robert F(rancis) (\"RFK\"), byname Bobby Kennedy (b. Nov. 20, 1925, Brookline, Mass. - d. June 6, 1968, Los Angeles, Calif.), U.S. attorney general (1961-64); brother of John F. Kennedy; son of Joseph P. Kennedy; grandson of John Francis Fitzgerald. He was an attorney at the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice (1951-52), resigning to manage the successful campaign of his brother John F. Kennedy for election as U.S. senator from Massachusetts. He became chief counsel of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (1955-57) and chief counsel of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field (1957-60), in which role he prosecuted Dave Beck and Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters union, who were charged with corruption. He was an efficient manager of his brother John's successful presidential campaign in 1960, and as attorney general pursued a racket-busting policy and worked to enforce federal law in support of civil rights. When John's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, preferred Hubert H. Humphrey for the 1964 vice-presidential nomination, Kennedy resigned as attorney general and was elected senator for New York. On March 16, 1968, he announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination of that year. He advocated social justice at home and an end to the Vietnam War. During a campaign stop in California, he was shot on June 5 and died the following day. The assassin was Sirhan Sirhan (b. 1944), a Jordanian citizen who had lived in the U.S. since 1957.\n\nKennedy, Robert F(rancis), Jr. (b. Jan. 17, 1954, Washington, D.C.), U.S. politician; son of Robert F. Kennedy; nephew of John F. Kennedy. In April 2023 he launched a bid for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination. Mostly known for anti-vaccine quackery, he was more popular with Republicans than Democrats. In October he dropped the bid and announced an independent run. In March 2024 he named as his running mate Nicole Shanahan, wealthy ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin.\n\nKennedy, William (b. Jan. 17, 1766, Bucks county, Pennsylvania - d. Jan. 29, 1851, Easton, Pa.), acting governor of New Jersey (1815).\n\nKennedy-Cooke, Brian (b. Oct. 22, 1894 - d. June 13, 1963), deputy chief political officer of Eritrea (1941-42).\n\nKennett\n\nKenney\n\nKennett, Jeff(rey Gibb) (b. March 2, 1948, Melbourne, Vic.), premier of Victoria (1992-99).\n\nKenney, Jason (b. May 30, 1968, Oakville, Ont.), defence minister of Canada (2015) and premier of Alberta (2019-22). He was also minister of citizenship, immigration, and multiculturalism (2008-13), employment and social development (2013-15), and multiculturalism (2013-15).\n\nKennon, Robert F(loyd) (b. Aug. 21, 1902, near Minden, La. - d. Jan. 11, 1988, Baton Rouge, La.), governor of Louisiana (1952-56).\n\nKenny, Edward Courtenay (b. Nov. 20, 1885 - d. 1956), acting chief commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (1931).\n\nEnda Kenny\n\nKenny, Enda, Irish Éanna Ó Coinnigh (b. April 24, 1951, Castlebar, County Mayo, Ireland), prime minister (2011-17) and defence minister (2014, 2016-17) of Ireland. He turned to politics in 1975 upon the death of his father, Henry Kenny, a long-serving Fine Gael member of the Dáil (lower house). Kenny won a comfortable victory in a special election to fill his father's seat in rural Mayo, and at just age 24 he was the youngest member of the Dáil. He was minister of tourism and trade in 1994-97 in the \"rainbow coalition\" government of Fine Gael prime minister John Bruton. After the collapse of Bruton's coalition, Kenny's stature rose as Fine Gael's declined. Weeks after the 2002 election, which saw the party win just 31 seats, Kenny was elected its leader. He immediately set to restoring the party's fortunes, and Fine Gael made an impressive showing in the 2007 election, capturing 51 seats. Fine Gael's momentum continued to build as Fianna Fáil prime minister Brian Cowen, beset with a banking crisis and a soaring national deficit, was obliged to accept a bailout package of more than $100 billion from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. The Green Party withdrew from Cowen's coalition, and the government collapsed, forcing early elections in 2011. Capitalizing on widespread voter dissatisfaction, Fine Gael won 76 seats, ending 14 years of Fianna Fáil rule. Kenny formed a coalition with the Labour Party and was elected prime minister by an unprecedented 90 votes. His first term in office was dominated by Ireland's economic woes, but after years of gruelling austerity, Dublin took back control of its purse strings and unemployment fell sharply although the country did not return to its \"Celtic Tiger\" heyday. Although he was returned to power as leader of his centre-right party for an unprecedented second time in 2016, this time he had to rely on the goodwill of the opposition to remain there. He always insisted he would not lead his party into a third election but his departure in 2017 was propelled by widespread criticism of how he dealt with a scandal in the police force. He was succeeded as party leader and prime minister by Leo Varadkar.\n\nKent, Edward (b. Jan. 8, 1802, Concord, N.H. - d. May 19, 1877, Bangor, Maine), governor of Maine (1838-39, 1841-42).\n\nKent, John (b. 1805, Waterford, Ireland - d. Sept. 1, 1872, St. John's, Newfoundland), premier of Newfoundland (1858-61).\n\nKent, Joseph (b. Jan. 14, 1779, Calvert county, Md. - d. Nov. 24, 1837, near Bladensburg, Md.), governor of Maryland (1826-29).\n\nKent Hughes, Sir Wilfrid (Selwyn), byname Billy Kent Hughes (b. June 12, 1895, East Melbourne, Victoria - d. July 31, 1970, Kew, Melbourne, Vic.), interior (and works and housing) minister of Australia (1951-56); knighted 1957.\n\nJ. Kenyatta\n\nKenyatta, Jomo, original name Kamau Ngengi (b. Oct. 20, 1891, Ichaweri village, near Nairobi, British East Africa [now in Kenya] - d. Aug. 22, 1978, Mombasa, Kenya), president of Kenya (1964-78). In August 1914 he was baptized with the name Johnstone Kamau. Later he adopted the name Kenyatta, the Kikuyu term for a fancy belt that he wore. In 1922 he joined the first African political protest movement in Kenya, the East Africa Association. In 1925 it disbanded as a result of government pressures, and its members re-formed as the Kikuyu Central Association. Three years later he became its general secretary. In the 1930s he changed his name to Jomo (Burning Spear) Kenyatta. In September 1946 he took up leadership of the newly formed Kenya African Union, of which he was elected president in June 1947. In 1952 the Mau Mau rebellion erupted, directed against the presence of European settlers in Kenya and their ownership of land. On Oct. 21, 1952, Kenyatta was arrested on charges of having directed the Mau Mau movement. In April 1953 he was sentenced to a seven-year imprisonment. In 1960 Kenyan nationalist leaders organized the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and elected Kenyatta (still in detention despite having completed his sentence) president in absentia. He was released in August 1961, and negotiated the constitutional terms leading to independence. KANU won the preindependence election in May 1963, forming a provisional government, and Kenya celebrated its independence on Dec. 12, 1963, with Kenyatta as prime minister. A year later he became the first president of Kenya. His government was consistently friendly toward the West. He made Kenya the stablest black African country and one of the most economically dynamic as well. He died in office.\n\nU. Kenyatta\n\nKenyatta, Uhuru (Muigai) (b. Oct. 28, 1961, Nairobi, Kenya), finance minister (2009-12) and president (2013-22) of Kenya; son of Jomo Kenyatta. He became politically active in the 1990s, being groomed by Pres. Daniel arap Moi. In October 2001 he was nominated by Moi to fill a parliament seat; a month later Moi elevated him to the cabinet as minister for local government. In 2002 he was elected as one of four vice-chairs of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU). Also that year, he was named KANU's presidential candidate - a controversial move engineered by Moi, who was ineligible to stand for another term and wanted someone of his own choosing to succeed him. Moi's machinations backfired, however, as some KANU members left the party to support opposition leader Mwai Kibaki, who handily defeated Kenyatta in the December 2002 elections. Kenyatta then assumed the position of leader of the opposition in parliament. He was elected chairman of the party in 2005. In 2007 he withdrew his presidential candidacy a few months before the election and opted instead to back Kibaki, whose reelection was followed by widespread violence. Kibaki named Kenyatta as minister of local government in January 2008, but in a coalition government formed in April Kenyatta was appointed deputy prime minister and minister of trade. The next year, he moved from trade to finance. In late 2010 he was named by the International Criminal Court as being one of six suspects thought to be most responsible for instigating the post-election violence; he proclaimed his innocence. After the ICC announced charges against him in January 2012, he resigned as finance minister but remained in his post as deputy prime minister. In May 2012 he launched a new party, The National Alliance (TNA), which later that year became part of a multiparty alliance known as the Jubilee Coalition (becoming the Jubilee Alliance Party in 2015 and the Jubilee Party in 2016). He won the 2013 presidential election, defeating Prime Minister Raila Odinga. In 2014 he became the first sitting head of state to appear before the ICC; the charges were dropped later that year. In 2017 he again defeated Odinga; the election was annulled and repeated, Odinga then boycotting the vote.\n\nKeon, Michael (Edward Marcos) (b.

Keravnos (b. Dec. 18, 1951, Larnaca, Cyprus), finance minister of Cyprus (2004-05, 2023- ). An economist who specialized in human resources training, his first public appointment was as labour minister in March 2003. Appointed finance minister in May 2004, he took on a budget deficit which then exceeded 5% of GDP and public debt exceeding 70%. His deficit-busting gameplan included an agreement by civil servants to increase retirement ages and cut down on pension bills, government outsourcing, and slashing overtime pay in the civil service. Based on the pledges to cut the deficit to 1.7% by the end of 2006 and show declining public debt - expected to fall to 66% of GDP in 2006 - Cyprus in April 2005 entered the European Exchange Rate (ERM 2) mechanism, a precursor to adopting the euro, which Cyprus did in January 2008. In August 2005 he resigned to take the helm of a major commercial bank.\n\nKerber, Robert (b. May 21, 1884, Stettin, Germany [now Szczecin, Poland] - d. May 11, 1977, Vienna, Austria), interior minister of Austria (1933-34). He was also minister of social administration (1933).\n\nKérékou\n\nKérékou, Mathieu (b. Sept. 2, 1933, Kouarfa, northern Dahomey [now Benin] - d. Oct. 14, 2015), president of Benin (1972-91, 1996-2006). He served in the French army until Benin (then called Dahomey) became independent in 1960. He was involved in the military coup that overthrew Pres. Hubert Maga in 1967 and led to several years of political unrest; in 1972, Kérékou himself led another coup, after which he assumed the offices of president and minister of national defense. Under his leadership, Benin became a socialist state based on Marxist-Leninist principles. On Sept. 28, 1980, he reportedly was converted to Islam and changed his first name to Ahmed, but this was subsequently denied. Because of widespread protests, the Marxist ideology was abandoned late in 1989 and multiparty elections were scheduled. Kérékou remained president of a transition government established in 1990. Multiparty elections were held under a new constitution in March 1991, and Kérékou was defeated by Nicéphore Soglo. He was the first incumbent African president to be ousted in democratic elections. During five years in the political wilderness, he remained silent as Soglo, a former World Bank economist, helped put Benin's shattered economy back on its feet with a strong dose of free-market economics. But Soglo's personal popularity plummeted. In a 1996 rematch Kérékou defeated Soglo. He promised no major upheavals in economic policy although he attacked Soglo's brand of privatization as selling off the nation's assets at knock-down prices. He chose an ex-rival as his prime minister: Adrien Houngbédji, who was once sentenced to death for plotting against Kérékou's revolution. Houngbédji had finished third in the first round of the election and then rallied to Kérékou. Kérékou's reelection in 2001 was marred by accusations of fraud. He was barred from running again in 2006 by a constitutional limit on seeking a third term as well as by an age limit.\n\nKerem, August (b. Oct. 11 [Sept. 29, O.S.], 1889, Karula parish, Valga county, Russia [now in Estonia] - d. May 28, 1942, Sosva camp, Sverdlovsk oblast, Russian S.F.S.R.), defense minister of Estonia (1931-32, 1933). He was also minister of agriculture (1920, 1923-25, 1929-31) and transport (1926-28).\n\nKerèns, Pierre André Servais (b. July 22, 1780, Mechelen, Austrian Netherlands [now in Antwerp province, Belgium] - d. April 6, 1862, Maastricht), acting governor of Limburg (1831).\n\nKerensky\n\nKerensky, Aleksandr (Fyodorovich) (b. May 4 [April 22, O.S.], 1881, Simbirsk [now Ulyanovsk], Russia - d. June 11, 1970, New York City), head of the Russian provisional government (1917). He was attracted to the Narodniki revolutionary movement and later (c. 1905) joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party. He was elected to the fourth Duma in 1912 as a member of the small Trudoviki (Labour) group, and, unlike some of the more radical socialists, supported Russia's participation in World War I. But in the course of the war tsarist repression increased and Kerensky became increasingly disenchanted with the regime. When the February Revolution broke out (1917), he was offered, and promptly accepted, the posts of vice chairman of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies and of minister of justice in the provisional government formed by the Duma. He was the only person to hold positions in both bodies and acted as intermediary between them. In May, he was transferred to the posts of minister of war and of the navy. When the provisional government was again compelled to reorganize in July, Kerensky, whose dramatic oratorical style appeared to win him broad popular support, became prime minister. He initiated democratic reforms, but they did not go to the core of popular demands for peace and for breaking up the landed estates. Beset from the right and the left, his government was virtually paralyzed. Power gravitated to the Petrograd Soviet and the Bolsheviks finished off Kerensky's government in November (October, O.S.). He escaped to the front, sought vainly to rally armed support for his government, and remained in hiding until May 1918, when he emigrated to western Europe, living mostly in France before moving to the United States in 1940.\n\nKerenxhi, Nesti (b. Sept. 5, 1920, Korçë, Albania - d. 2002, Tiranë, Albania), interior minister of Albania (1948).\n\nKeresztes-Fischer, Ferenc vitéz, until 1929 Ferenc Fischer (b. Feb. 18, 1881, Pécs, Hungary - d. March 3, 1948, Vöcklabruck, Austria), interior minister (1931-35, 1938-44), acting prime minister (1941, 1942), and acting foreign minister (1942) of Hungary. He was also governor of Baranya and Pécs (1921-31) and Somogy (1925-31).\n\nKerim\n\nKerim, Srgjan (b. Dec. 12, 1948, Skopje, Macedonia [now North Macedonia]), foreign minister of Macedonia (2000-01). He was also ambassador to Germany (1994-2000) and to Switzerland and Liechtenstein (1995-2000) and permanent representative to the United Nations (2001-03). In 2007-08 he was president of the UN General Assembly.\n\nKerimbayev, Daniyal (Kerimbayevich) (b. March 29, 1909, Semipalatinsk oblast, Russia [now in Vostochno-Kazakhstan oblast, Kazakhstan] - d. Jan. 6, 1982, Alma-Ata, Kazakh S.S.R. [now Almaty, Kazakhstan]), chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh S.S.R. (1947-54). He was also chairman of the Executive Committee of Kustanay (1940-45), Pavlodar (1945-47), and Severo-Kazakhstan (1954-56) oblasti.\n\nKerimkulov\n\nKerimkulov, Medetbek (Temirbekovich) (b.

(1976-90).\n\nKerin, John (Charles) (b. Nov. 21, 1937, Bowral, N.S.W. - d. March 28, 2023), Australian politician. He entered the federal parliament as member of the House of Representatives for Macarthur in 1972, lost his seat in 1975 when the reformist Labor government of Gough Whitlam fell, but regained another, Werriwa, N.S.W., in 1978. A supporter of Prime Minister Robert Hawke, he was rewarded with the portfolio for primary industry (from 1987, primary industries and energy). With his practical and theoretical economic background, he was a natural, although untimely, choice for the Treasury portfolio when Paul Keating resigned from the government in June 1991, following an unsuccessful challenge for the prime ministership. Kerin's sudden swings of policy direction - on interest rates, for example - often appeared to be the result of sail trimming to meet sectional demands within the Labor Party rather than a considered response to economic forces. Despite Hawke's assertion to the contrary, Kerin admitted that Australia was experiencing its most severe recession in 60 years. On December 6, with his approval rating at an all-time low, Hawke sacked Kerin, only to fall victim some two weeks later to a new leadership challenge from Keating. Kerin then became minister of trade and overseas development (until 1993).\n\nR. Kerin\n\nC. Kern\n\nKernan\n\nKerin, Rob(ert Gerard) (b. Jan. 4, 1954), premier of South Australia (2001-02).\n\nKerkapoly, Károly (b. May 13, 1824, Szentgál, Hungary - d.

In 2010-16 he was CEO of the Austrian federal railways (ÖBB). He was chairman of the Social Democratic Party in 2016-18.\n\nKern, Johann Konrad (b. June 11, 1808, Berlingen, Thurgau, Switzerland - d. April 14, 1888, Zürich, Switzerland), president of the government of Thurgau (1850, 1852). He was also Swiss president of the National Council (1850) and minister to France (1857-83).\n\nKernan, Joe, byname of Joseph Eugene Kernan (b. April 8, 1946, Chicago, Ill. - d.

May 9, 1976, Chicago), governor of Illinois (1961-68).\n\nKernot\n\nKernot, Cheryl (b. Dec. 5, 1948, Maitland, N.S.W.), Australian politician. She joined the Australian Democrats (AD) in 1979 (two years after its founding), in part because she was attracted to an organization that right from the start had set up party administrative processes that were very appealing to women. In an early speech to the Australian Federation of University Women in Brisbane, Kernot recalled that because of the party's relative youth, the Democrats had not formed links with unions, business, or farmer organizations and had never had to battle with the sort of vested interests and entrenched male hierarchies that existed in other places. She was the party's representative in a Young Political Leaders' exchange tour of the U.S. in 1986, and in 1990 she was elected to the Senate on her fourth attempt. In late 1993 Kernot was heavily involved in the successful passage of the historic Native Title (Mabo) legislation, acting as a behind-the-scenes negotiator between the government, the Senate independents, and Aboriginal groups. She became leader of the AD after 81% of the full membership elected her in May 1993 and she became the most popular chief of any Australian political party. In 1994 she launched an \"Inspiring Women\" calendar for 1995, with herself as Miss April under the rubric \"Strength and Courage.\" Kernot said that she hoped the calendar would send the message to women that success and inspiration were not necessarily synonymous with fame and wealth and that happiness was not just about being thin or fashionable. She ended by quoting Emmeline Pankhurst: \"Women will only be truly successful when no one is surprised that they are successful.\" She defected to Labor in 1997.\n\nKerr, Sir John Henry (b. 1871 - d. April 8, 1934), governor of Assam (1922-27); knighted 1922.\n\nJ.R. Kerr\n\nKerr, Sir John Robert (b. Sept. 24, 1914, Sydney, N.S.W. - d. March 24, 1991, Sydney), governor-general of Australia (1974-77). He served with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force in World War II. From 1966 to 1972 he was a judge on the Commonwealth Industrial Court and on the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. Kerr was named chief justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court in 1972; two years later Prime Minister Gough Whitlam offered him the post of governor-general. In 1975 a series of government scandals and policy disputes led to a stalemate between Whitlam, whose Labor Party held a majority in the House of Representatives, and the opposition, which controlled the Senate and refused to release badly needed government funding. He broke with 200 years of tradition and precipitated a constitutional crisis on Nov. 11, 1975, when he used his power as governor-general to dismiss Whitlam's Labor government and compel a caretaker government led by the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, to call a general election. The controversy triggered by these actions continued to plague him. He stepped down as governor-general in 1977, and in 1978 he withdrew his name from consideration for the post of ambassador to UNESCO. He was knighted in 1974.\n\nR.J. Kerr\n\nC.

He served in the Vietnam War in 1966-69 and after his return became a prominent spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. In 1972 he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives, but in 1982 he was elected lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, and in 1984 he was elected to the U.S. Senate (reelected in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008). He was the Democratic candidate in the 2004 presidential election but lost to incumbent George W. Bush. As secretary of state during Pres. Barack Obama's second term, he notably helped draft the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement (from which Pres. Donald Trump withdrew in 2018). In 2020 president-elect Joe Biden named Kerry special presidential envoy for climate.

Also known as a historian, he was created baron in 1861.\n\nKery, Theodor (b. July 24, 1918, Mannersdorf an der Rabnitz, Burgenland, Austria - d. May 9, 2010, Kobersdorf, Burgenland), Landeshauptmann of Burgenland (1966-87).\n\nKeshtmand\n\nKeshtmand, Sultan Ali (b. 1935, near Kabul, Afghanistan), prime minister of Afghanistan (1981-88, 1989-90). He was a member of the Parcham faction of the People's Democratic Party. After the Communist coup of April 1978, he was appointed minister of planning. In August of the same year, he was arrested for plotting against Nur Mohammad Taraki's regime. He was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. After the Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979, he became a member of the Politburo and a deputy prime minister and (until September 1980) again minister of planning, and later was appointed as prime minister. In 1990, he was appointed first vice president, but in 1991 he was dismissed from this position. After his dismissal, he moved to Moscow and subsequently to England. While abroad, Keshtmand, who belongs to the Hazara ethnic group, charged that Afghanistan had been ruled by the Pashtuns and that the minorities had been underrepresented in past Afghan governments.\n\nKesmir, Cemal, until Jan. 1, 1935, Artin Cemal Bey (b. 1862, Ibradi, Ottoman Empire [now in Antalya province, Turkey] - d.

Jan. 2, 2007, Perrysburg Township, Ohio), mayor of Toledo (1971-77). He entered the political arena in 1961 when he unsuccessfully sought a City Council seat. He was beaten again the next year when he ran for state representative, and lost a third time in 1963 in his second bid for council. He finally was elected in 1965, the first in a long string of victories. After four years on council and two as vice mayor, he moved into the mayor's office Jan. 27, 1971, under tough circumstances. Mayor William Ensign and City Manager William Gross had resigned, the economy was faltering, and city finances were shaky. Kessler became mayor through a 13-11 vote in the Democratic Party executive committee to beat Carol Pietrykowski as the party's choice to be appointed to succeed Ensign. A heavy underdog in the 1971 mayoral primary, Kessler lost to Howard Cook by 7,000 votes. But in the general election two months later, Kessler defeated Cook for a two-year term. He was reelected in 1973 and 1975. He helped spearhead the development that remade the downtown riverfront and changed the city's skyline. On the political scene, he was credited for standing up to Bill Boyle, then chairman of the Lucas County Democratic Party, when patronage issues arose. Kessler did not seek reelection in 1977, citing burnout from the 1975 race (when he took a lot of heat because of the relationship he built with the publisher of the Toledo Blade, Paul Block, Jr.), yet ran successfully that November to be clerk of municipal court, holding that post until 1992 and then serving as a member of the Toledo Board of Education in 1992-95.\n\nKessler, Heinz (b.

Nov. 16, 1889, Budapest, Hungary - d. Sept. 7, 1976, Blankenberge, Belgium), Hungarian politician. A union leader and Social Democrat closely watched by the police of the Austro-Hungarian empire, she was elected to the Hungarian parliament in 1922 and represented the city of Szeged until 1948, when she resigned on the forced union of her party with the Communists. Imprisoned from 1950 to 1954, she in 1956 became briefly minister of state in Imre Nagy's revolutionary government. On November 4 the government was deposed by Soviet forces that installed János Kádár as premier. The following day she arrived at the UN in New York to plead for help but the Security Council would not hear her.

At age 14, he was sent as his father's representative to the desert tribes to hear their grievances. In 1932 he was appointed viceroy of the Hejaz, and in 1934 he took part in a war against Yemen led by Faysal, and afterward was made interior minister and Saudi representative at the peace negotiations. In 1939 he left Arabia for the first time to take part in the abortive London conference on Palestine. Regarded as a \"man of the desert,\" he concerned himself with the problems of the Bedouin and took a special interest in desert-reclamation projects through the use of groundwater. His modest personality and reputation for calm reason made him the chief conciliator in the disputes that arose among the large family of royal princes.

Khalid was not given a PPP ticket to contest the October 1993 elections that brought Bhutto to power for the second time, but was afterwards named as rector of Islamabad's International Islamic University. He dissociated himself from active politics and became critical of Bhutto's government in 1996. In November 1996 Pres. Farooq Leghari named the soft-spoken 80-year-old as caretaker prime minister to replace Bhutto, whom he sacked overnight on charges of corruption and misrule. Leghari also dissolved parliament.
