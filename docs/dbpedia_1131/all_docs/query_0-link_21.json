        "text": "Inside: • Mykola Riabchuk on selective justice in Ukraine – page 6. • Metropolitan Constantine Bohachevsky, 1884-1961 – page 8. • An artist to watch: pianist Anna Shelest – page 13. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Ukrainian</strong> <strong>Weekly</strong> Published by the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> National Association Inc., a fraternal non-profit association Vol. LXXIX No. 5 THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY SUNDAY, JANUARY <strong>30</strong>, <strong>2011</strong> $1/$2 in Ukraine Ukraine’s Unity Day holiday manifests divisions in society Olena Harasovska/UNIAN Participants of the Unity Day human chain that stretched across Kyiv’s Paton Bridge to symbolically unite Ukraine on <strong>January</strong> 22. Unity Day, or “Den Sobornosty” in <strong>Ukrainian</strong>, has been a national holiday in Ukraine since 1999, when so designated by a presidential decree. by Zenon Zawada Kyiv Press Bureau KYIV – <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s were disunited as ever on Unity Day, holding three separate rallies in Kyiv on <strong>January</strong> 22, the day commemorating the unification of the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> National Republic (of central and eastern Ukraine) and the Western <strong>Ukrainian</strong> National Republic in 1919. <strong>The</strong> administration of President Viktor Yanukovych organized a rally on Independence Square. Supporters of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko took to St. Sophia Square, the site of the historic declaration, while Arseniy Yatsenyuk gathered those opposed to both leaders at Kontraktova Square. <strong>The</strong> commemoration offered evidence that <strong>Ukrainian</strong> politics has retained its tripolar structure of those supporting Mr. Yanukovych, those supporting Ms. Tymoshenko and those actively opposed to both. <strong>The</strong> division within the opposition benefits the current authoritarian government, observers said. “<strong>The</strong> government is interested in supporting the emergence of other opposition forces,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, board chairman of the Penta Center for Applied Political Research in Kyiv. He added, “<strong>The</strong> government can play off the antagonism between different opposition currents.” Those organizing the rally on St. Sophia Square – where the Act of Union was declared on <strong>January</strong> 22, 1919 – lobbed sharp criticism against former Verkhovna Rada Chair Yatsenyuk of the Front of Change party and his allies for splitting the pro-Western opposition. <strong>The</strong>y shouted “Shame!” at Lilia Hrynevych of the Front of Change party when she addressed the crowd on St. Sophia Square. <strong>The</strong> famous “liubi druzi” (dear friends) who formed the financial backbone of former President Viktor Yushchenko’s political campaign – confectionary magnate Petro Poroshenko and natural gas trader Mykola Martynenko – were also on Kontraktova Square. Soviet-era dissident Bohdan Horyn accused the Yatsenyuk crowd of fulfilling commands from the Yanukovych administration to divide the opposition. “Perhaps Arseniy Yatsenyuk hasn’t matured to the realization that unity doesn’t mean separated national-democratic forces, but their unity for the sake of a grand goal – saving Ukraine at a time of great danger?” he wrote in a column published on the Ukrayinska Pravda website on <strong>January</strong> 25. Meanwhile, those who joined the St. Sophia Square event included opposition leader Ms. Tymoshenko, former Defense Minister Anatoliy Grytsenko, former Foreign Affairs Minister Borys Tarasyuk, nationalist orator Iryna Farion of the Svoboda party, Mykola Katerynchuk of the European Party of Ukraine and Mykola Kokhanivskyi of the Congress of <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Nationalists. <strong>The</strong> event was organized by the Committee to Defend Ukraine, which includes the Batkivshchyna party led by Ms. Tymoshenko, the People’s Rukh of Ukraine led by Mr. Tarasyuk, the Svoboda party led by Oleh Tiahnybok, the Congress of <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Nationalists led by Stepan Bratsiun and the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> World Coordinating Council led by Dmytro Pavlychko. Patriarch Filaret of the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Orthodox Church–Kyiv Patriatch (UOC– KP), whose church is under persecution by the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Orthodox Church–Moscow Patriarchate (UOC–MP), led the Orthodox moleben initiating the event. It was interrupted by Ms. Tymoshenko and her entourage, who arrived late. She Volodymyr Musyak Thousands of <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s gathered on St. Sophia Square to commemorate Unity Day on <strong>January</strong> 22, 92 years after the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> National Republic and the Western <strong>Ukrainian</strong> National Republic declared their unification. drew the crowd’s attention and applause, which grew loud enough to interfere with the prayer and visibly irritate Patriarch Filaret, who kept his distance from the opposition leader for the remainder of the evening. Svoboda nationalists officially endorsed and supported the commemoration on St. Sophia Square, but its activists also attended the Kontraktova Square event, distributing the party’s newspaper and observing the vertep (Nativity Play) being performed there by Bohdan Beniuk, a regarded actor and Svoboda party member. “We sent our people to distribute our Human Rights Watch slams West for ‘cowardice’ on rights issues RFE/RL An international rights group has accused Western powers of not doing enough to pressure abusive regimes to protect basic human rights. <strong>The</strong> 648-page Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, a compendium of human rights abuses reported around the world in the past year, criticizes the democracies for their “soft reaction” to repressive regimes. <strong>The</strong> report singles out the United States, the European Union and the United Nations for failing to put enough pressure on abusive governments, highlighting what it called a “near-universal cowardice in confronting China’s deepening crackdown on basic liberties.” party newspaper,” said Yurii Sytoriuk, the party spokesman. “Why no go there and advertise Svoboda? We used it as party propaganda.” <strong>The</strong> For Ukraine party, a national-democratic force committed to Euro-Atlantic integration, took a similar approach, dispatching its leader Viacheslav Kyrylenko to the event on St. Sophia Square. He declined an offer to address the crowd, instead mingling with participants afterwards. <strong>The</strong> For Ukraine party officially endorsed the Kontraktova event, which Mr. (Continued on page 11) HRW also charged Western leaders, particularly U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, and U.S. President Barack Obama with focusing too much on dialogue and not enough on confronting abuses. It condemns as soft the EU’s response to authoritarian regimes in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, denouncing what it calls the bloc’s “obsequious approach” toward both countries and arguing that leaders of authoritarian governments welcome an emphasis on dialogue because it is likely to “remove the spotlight from human rights discussions.” <strong>The</strong> report coincides with a rare visit (Continued on page 11)"
