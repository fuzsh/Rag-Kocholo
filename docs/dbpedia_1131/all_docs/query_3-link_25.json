        "text": "By Natalya Dvali, Editor\n\nLate in the evening December 2, the Verkhovna Rada approved new members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine headed by Arseny Yatsenyuk. They could not do without scandals: part of people's deputies demanded voting separately for every candidate. Nevertheless, they voted for future ministers \"in batch\". 288 parliamentarians voted for the candidates though the coalition totals 304 deputies.\n\nIt is probably the most ethnically diverse government for the whole history of independent Ukraine. The Cabinet of Ministers includes an American of Ukrainian origin Natalia Yaresko, Lithuanian Ayvaras Abromavichus, and Georgian Alexander Kvitashvili (before the vote, all three of them were granted Ukrainian citizenship under Petro Poroshenko’s decree). Besides, there are not only politicians, lawyers, and economists in the government now, but also financiers, investors, historians, philosophers, and engineers. The GORDON edition presents a brief profile of each of the ministers.\n\nMinister of Finance\n\nPhoto: Natalia Jaresko / Facebook\n\nName: Natalie Ann YARESKO\n\nAge: 49 years\n\nPlace of birth: Chicago, USA\n\nProfession: entrepreneur, investor\n\nQuota: Petro Poroshenko Bloc\n\nI am not an advocate of gender theories in business: it is not gender but professionalism that matters. But there are natural factors that help women in business. For example, their ability to systematize a number of tasks and work with them simultaneously. It is a natural process for a woman who is a wife, a mother and a civil servant at the same time. Unlike men, we are faster in adapting to changes and are more human-oriented at the emotional level. It often helps to solve conflicts and feel more confident both in negotiations, in the quality of a member of the supervisory board and in other business situations.\n\nSource: Investgazeta, 2013\n\nNatalia Yaresko is a cofounder and chief executive officer of Horizon Capital investment company. She was born and grew up in Chicago, in a family of Ukrainians who emigrated to the USA after World War II. In the childhood, she attended a School for Ukrainian Studies, studied Ukrainian culture, and played the bandura.\n\nIn 1987, she got her Bachelor’s degree in Accounting at DePaul University (Chicago, Illinois), two years later she obtained her Master's degree majoring in Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nAfter graduation from the university, she held a number of positions in the economic division of the US Department of State. From 1992 to 1995, she headed economic department of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. Since 1995, she has lived in Ukraine.

Yaresko was decorated with the Order of Princess Olga for her contribution to the development of the Ukrainian economy in 2003.

I left my native Lithuania when I was 17 years old. My Swedish friends and I made one of the most successful investment companies in Eastern Europe from scratch. Today, we make investment in 40 countries with a total capital of about four billion dollars.\n\nWe have long and hard work ahead. Ukraine is one of the poorest and most corrupted countries in the world, it ranks 112th in terms of ease of doing business. We have to be very quick and tough and use the most radical methods.\"\n\nFrom speech in the Verkhovna Rada, December 2, 2014\n\nA partner of the Swedish company East Capital; his company invested in Ukraine more than 1.5 billion UAH as of 2012.

A second step that is extremely important for business is bringing the economy out of shadow. At first sight, it is hard work for several years, but business cannot develop without it – it hardly survives. The number of taxes has to be reduced, the procedure of their payment has to be simplified, and the most corrupted of them, the VAT, has to be abolished. It should be replaced with sales tax\".\n\nFocus , March, 2014\n\nHe graduated from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and the Fletcher School at Tufts University (USA).

Development of a strategy of national information security, management of appropriate resources, protection of national interests, support of the freedom of speech are the functions that require effective and centralized management in the conditions of a military conflict. No agency in the power structure of Ukraine can fulfil these tasks effectively today. Meanwhile, the field of information and communications remains separated, full of contradictions, and influenced by foreign agents; in the condition of geopolitical wars, it becomes a weak spot of the country that the enemies will hit.\"\n\nYury Stets / Facebook\n\nEstablishment of a new agency – the Ministries of Information Policy – caused many disputes among both civil activists and politicians.

Society insisted that the ministry was created especially for Poroshenko’s godfather Yury Stets (President Poroshenko’s wife Marina and Yury Lutsenko christened Stets’ daughter Eva). Supporters of the new agency assure that the Ministry of Information Policy will deal with the implementation of the unified program of information security, opposition to the information aggression of the Russian Federation and prevention of external impact on Ukrainian information space.\n\nStets graduated from Sidor Vorobkevich Chernivtsi School of Arts and Kharkiv State Polytechnic University obtaining the qualifications \"Manager of Information Systems\" and \"Manager of Foreign Economic Activity\".
