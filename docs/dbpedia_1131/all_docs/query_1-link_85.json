This document is an amended complaint filed in a United States federal court. It summarizes that former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and other political opposition members have been arbitrarily arrested and prosecuted in Ukraine in violation of international law. It alleges these political persecutions were carried out by or with the assistance of various defendants, including Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, to benefit themselves politically and financially by eliminating political opposition. It further alleges these actions were part of a larger racketeering scheme involving money laundering and kickbacks to Ukrainian officials related to Ukraine's natural gas dealings with Russia.",
