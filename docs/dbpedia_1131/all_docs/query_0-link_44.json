        "text": "In November 2012, a delegation of writers from PEN International, the world association of writers, visited Istanbul and Ankara to raise long-standing concerns about the state of freedom of expression in Turkey. During the visit, the writers met with Turkey’s then President Abdullah Gül. The discussion was frank. Among the topics raised were: the large numbers of writers then in prison and on trial; the use of anti-terror legislation to stifle dissent; writers who had served years of untried detention; and suppression of the Internet. The meeting was amicable and Gül gave assurances that he was following the situation closely. He made an important observation, that he recognised that freedom of expression in his country was problematic, saying: “There are many good things unfolding in Turkey, but these concerns cast a shadow over the progress we are achieving.“ In November 2014, the Norwegian PEN Centre is presenting a report which explores how the situation for freedom of expression has developed since the visit in 2012. - See more at: http://www.pen-international.org/centresnews/norwegian-pen-launches-comprehensive-report-on-free-expression-in-turkey/#sthash.I82gwfOc.dpuf\n\nIn this paper, I examine online self-publishing literary platforms in Russia from a historical and legislative perspective. Using a mixed methods approach, including digital ethnography, field diary, phenomenological interviews, I trace how the Russian Internet, and particularly literary self-publishing platforms, transformed from a free space without legislation or geographical borders to a limited digital arena controlled by the Russian state. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this transformation was complete: the boundaries of the Russian literary Internet coincided with the geographical borders of Russia. The notion of Runet as a community of Russian-speaking people was broken by regulative acts of the Russian government and a war. Literary and online self-publishing practices, contrary to Soviet samizdat, depend on state legislation due to their commercial nature. Regulatory acts limit authors’ capacities to express their thoughts and feelings in literary work.\n\nThe vision of the writer as the liberal conscience of the world was the cornerstone on which the group now known as PEN international – easily the most prominent human rights literary organization in the world-was founded. When the International PEN Congress was held in Dublin in June 1953, the crusade by its members to uphold the cultural freedom and integrity of writers stood as one of the crucial objectives of the organisation. On that occasion, literary, political and cultural organizations came together to welcome some 439 delegates from thirty-seven PEN centers and twenty-seven countries in Europe, the United States, New Zealand, India, Indonesia, and Japan, and organizers enlisted the support of the President of Ireland in promoting the event. Well-known international writers in attendance including Margaret Storm Jameson, Andre Maurois, Peter Ustinov, Stevie Smith, Neil Gunn, Berthold Brecht and Shizue Masugi. The 1953 PEN Congress highlights the interaction between the literary community and the international fight for freedom of expression during the mid-twentieth-century. Furthermore, PEN’s connections with writers’ worldwide challenges the commonly received notions of a post-Emergency Ireland culturally isolated intelligentsia and a stagnant literary field…\n\nThis paper assesses the Polish search for a new model of press freedom that can, to paraphrase Warsaw Voice editor, Andrzej Jonas, take Poland from its Communist roots to its heavenly dream without getting lost on the way. The study considers first the historical and theoretical contexts to the Polish quest for a new model of free expression. Drawing on intensive interview with more than a dozen Polish journalists--from Poland's largest circulation newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, to Trybuna, one the Polish Communist Party's official newspaper, Trybuna Ludu (Tribune of the People)--this study then examines the distinctive features of the Polish media and their need for a distinctive Polish model. The final section analyzes Poland's first substantive revision of media policy, the new Broadcast Act, and its implication for an emerging press model. Inherent in this discussion will be consideration of the relative utility of Western models of democratic communication for post-Communist nations.\n\nAt the 2014 IWCA/NCPTW Conference, founders of the National Writing Centers Association (now International Writing Centers Association) came together to reflect on the organization’s beginnings, its strategies for institutionalization, and challenges that may still exist. A significant anniversary such as the 30th provides the opportunity for reflection. Additionally, a timeline of the organization’s history is included, which provides important information for historical research.

The only substantial difference between the post−Soviet states and the Soviet Union is that the latter had had a compulsory ideology\". Rather than painting a negative or positive future in conclusion, he reminds that there is a future yet to be shaped.\n\nThis thesis aims to explore the making of Kurdish publishing in Turkey by asking how that field emerged and has been developed under the conditions inimical to the use and reproduction of Kurdish literary language. My exploratory journey into that terrain focuses on both the diachronic development of the conditions of possibilities underlying its emergence and the synchronic dynamics characterizing its conditions of existence. Drawing on both the secondary data collected through archival research and the qualitative data collected through ethnographic one, I argue that Kurdish publishing is situated not simply at the intersection of culture and economy, but rather at the intersection of culture and politics as a form of cultural resistance. Rather than taking this form of resistance as a monolithic one, I use Bourdieu's conception of the field to frame the complexity of the dynamics constituting that form of resistance, and I define two moments characterizing the making of that field: struggle and competition. While the former moment denotes the relations of antagonism between the Kurdish publishers and the state, the market imperative and the predominant public perceptions, the latter one stands for the relations of agonism among the publishers making that field."
