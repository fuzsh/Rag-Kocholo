        "text": "Window on Eurasia: Moscow Patriarchate’s Campaign against Independent Orthodox Gets Nastier\n\nPaul Goble\n\nVienna, May 6 – In its drive to build a tight power vertical in the Russian Orthodox Church, the Moscow Patriarchate has crossed another and dangerous line, employing for the first time the language it has traditionally used for religious sectarians to describe a Russian Orthodox prelate whose only “crime” is his refusal to subordinate himself and his flock to Moscow.\n\nA press release from the Odessa bishopric of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, described the Orthodox community of the Synod led by Metropolitan Agafangel, who has broken with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia now that the latter has established ties with Moscow in truly ugly ways.\n\nThe release said that “the assembly in Odessa [under Agafangel] has the very same relationship to the Orthodox Church Abroad as darkness has to light and as the devil has to Christ.” Indeed, it added, his services recall “Woland’s satanic ball in Bulgakov’s ‘Master and Margarita’” (http://www.pravoslav.odessa.net/?id=462&pages=58&group=0&num_page=0).\n\nIn its report on this May 2nd development, the Religiopolis.org portal notes that this comment is more typical of the ways that the Moscow Patriarchate describes “cult” groups than the way it has typically described Russian Orthodox groups that have so far refused to accept its supremacy (www.religiopolis.org/news/459-tserkovnaja-deklaratsija-antikultizma.html).\n\nUntil now, the Religiopolis.org report says, “toward the activity of such groups, the Moscow Patriarchate and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church” which is subordinate to it “had not launched an anti-religious campaign in relation to other religious communities and even more to Orthodox organizations of other jurisdictions.”\n\nMetropolitan Agafangel’s Russian Orthodox Church Abroad “includes the community of Orthodox believers and priests who refused in October 2006 to accept the Act on Canonical Communion with the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate as signed later by Metropolitan Lavrov.”\n\nAgafangel said at the time that “we have not separated from the Synod led by Metropolitan Lavrov” but that he and many other Orthodox believers abroad could not accept communion with the Moscow Patriarchate. That was too much for Lavrov whose supporters accused Agafangel of links to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nMetropolitan Agafangel and his supporters subsequently formed a Provisional Higher Church Administration of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, which currently is supported by approximately a third of the priests and bishops of the so-called “émigré” church and which seeks to convene a fifth “all-abroad assembly” to define the future.\n\nAgafangel has expressed concerns in messages to his flock that he may be subject to physical attack from the Moscow Patriarchate because of his leadership role in this movement. The vicious commentary from the Odessa bishopric this week suggests that his fears may be all too justified.\n\nWindow on Eurasia: Pushkin Wanted People to Study the Koran, Chechen School Children Told\n\nPaul Goble\n\nVienna, May 6 – Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov has done many things that one might reasonably expect would offend people of good will in Russia, but now he and his administration have taken a step certain to offend many of them: suggesting that Chechen pupils that Russia’s national poet Aleksandr Pushkin wanted everyone to study the Koran.\n\nIn an article in yesterday’s “Gazeta,” Olesya Gerasimenko notes that Chechnya is one of the 19 regions of the Russian Federation in which the foundations of religious culture and civic ethics has been introduced, with 99.64 percent of all pupils there selecting Islam as their course of study (www.gazeta.ru/social/2010/05/05/3362767.shtml).\n\nOnly 73 of the 20,000 students in the fourth class, the Moscow journalist says, have chosen to study Orthodoxy. And that tilt, she continues, is reinforced by two other developments, one that has attracted some attention and another that few Russians appear to know about.\n\nOn the one hand, Chechen leader Kadyrov has said that “in each village there must be a mosque, a hospital and a school,” hardly the commitment of a secular leader or one interested in supporting all “traditional” faiths. And on the other, pupils in the fifth through the 11th classes already study “Waynakh ethnics,” the single subject taught exclusively in Chechen.\n\nIn these classes, Gerasimenko notes, students are taught “how to interact with their parents, meet their obligations and celebration national holidays, in short about the Muslim way of life but not about the religion as such.” And the Chechen authorities have decided that “even children from Russian families must study Islamic culture” in the religious courses.\n\nThe “Gazeta” journalist visited several of these classes. In one, the teacher asked “how was Aleksandr Sergeyegich Pushkin connected with Islam?” One student responded, “He was sent to the Caucasus and then he found he liked Muslims very much, especially the idea that when you believe in God, then everything will go well.”\n\nAnother said that “Pushkin himself wanted to accept the Islamic faith, but he wasn’t able to do so!” And the teacher summed up the discussion: “However things were in fact, we hardly know will be able to find out. This means that Pushkin, like all the prophets, is calling on us to study the Koran,” hardly a message many Orthodox Russians would find comforting.\n\nGerasimenko notes that “in the 30 lessons of the textbook about Islamic culture, there is nothing about Shiites and Sunnis and not a word about Wahhabism.” In general, she says, teachers are to avoid the subject of Wahhabism, although if asked about it, the teachers can say that a Wahhabi is not a Muslim.\n\nWhatever impact these messages have on Muslim children, the way they affect non-Muslims is at a minimum problematic. One Armenian Christian noted that her baptized son was nonetheless being told about Islam and that in his classes, he had been careful not to talk about his own faith.\n\nA local Russian Orthodox priest expressed his concerns about Christian children in Muslim classes. He said many Orthodox believers in Chechnya are asked “why they do not accept Islam and so on.” That represents, he suggests, the actions of what can only be called “a concealed Islamization.”\n\n“You must understand,” he told the Moscow journalist, “that it is one thing to say ‘I’m Orthodox in Ryazan, and [quite] another to say the same thing in Grozny.” That is clearly a reality, but it may not be one that many elsewhere will be happy with and may even lead to a decline in the number of people who support the very idea of religious courses in schools."
