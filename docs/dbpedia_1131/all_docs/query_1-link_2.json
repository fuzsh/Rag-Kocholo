In 2010 Kolobov was a leading executive for the State Export-Import Bank of Ukraine (UkrExImBank).[2]\n\nFrom 29 December 2010 he was appointed the first deputy of the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine.[2][3]\n\nOn 28 February 2012 (by decree of President Viktor Yanukovych) he was appointed Minister of Finance.[2]\n\nOn 25 September 2014 Ukraine opened a criminal probe into Kolobov; he is accused of illegally transferring a $450,000 fee to Russia's state-run VTB Capital as a kickback for the 17 December 2013 Ukrainian–Russian action plan.[4] Five days later a criminal probe into Kolobov was opened for embezzling Ukrtelekom.[5]\n\nSince 3 July 2014 Kolobov is in the international wanted list for abuse of power.[6][7][8]\n\nRussian prosecutors refuse to extradite Kolobov to Ukraine and (according to Ukraine falsely) state that they have not received such a request from Ukraine.[8]\n\nAccording to the interior ministry of Ukraine, Kolobov was arrested on 4. March 2015 in a flat located in the luxury development \"Altea Hills\"[9] near the Spanish town of Valencia.[10] After hearings the Spanish court concluded that Kolobov was innocent and the case was politically motivated [1]. The Spanish police announced that the Kolobov case is politically motivated [2]\n\nHobby\n\n[edit]\n\nKolobov likes playing basketball. He was promoting Ukraine to host EuroBasket 2015 when he was a Minister of finance. In May 2016 Kolobov was appointed a chairman of the Tutorial Council of the Ukrainian Basketball Federation. In May 2016 ex-minister incurred expenses for Ukraine national under-15 basketball team who participated in championship hosted by Spain. Furthermore, Kolobov was called up for Ukraine veterans basketball team."
