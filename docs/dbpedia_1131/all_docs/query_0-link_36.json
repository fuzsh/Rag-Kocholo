UDC 327:355.1(1-071)(477) JEL code Z 18 No part of the book may be copied or reproduced without citing the source In this multi-authored monograph the scholars of the National Institute for Strategic Studies of Ukraine present an unprecedented study of the phenomenon of the world hybrid war, which manifested itself in the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The nature of the hybrid war was analyzed in the context of the global security crisis and was studied as a new type of global confrontation. This monograph is a complex analysis of the causes and preconditions of the Russian aggression against Ukraine with respect to the strategic purposes and special aspects of conduct in various dimensions including military, political, economic, social, humanitarian, and informational. This monograph also presents research of the local success of our country in resisting the hostile plans of the Russian Federation in certain areas. The conclusion reached by this study is that Ukraine is capable of fighting against an aggressor for her sovereignty. The reformation of international security institutions and attainment of balance of power in the new hybrid reality are also addressed in the monograph. This book is meant for politicians, political analysts, senior government officials and scientists in the field of security studies. The research results would also be interesting for academia, representatives of civil society, as well as patriotic and responsible citizens. Ukrainian institute for the future is independent think tank founded in 2016 which works on reports, forecasts and analytics on key issues of Ukrainian development. UIF mission is designing of a successful future for Ukraine, through expert studies and discussions that will promote and contribute the adoption of high-quality political decisions both in Ukrainian and international politics. UIF has expertise in: foreign policy, national security, defense, economics, infrastructure and education.

T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 5 FOREWORD Battle on — and win your battle! God Himself will aid you! Taras Shevchenko Today mankind faces the challenge of hybrid wars, whether we like it or not. These wars will breed the new hybrid world or, to be more precise, the new hybrid world order. We must face these challenges earnestly and accept them as part of the new reality in which we live. Russian aggression against Ukraine became a starting point for the forma- tion of the new hybrid world order. This is not the portrayal of the situation in Ukraine from a Ukraine-centric point of view; instead, we’ve attempted to offer an objective view of the current state of affairs in Ukraine. Just as the as- sassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo released a spring of deep animosities and complicated processes that led to World War I, so the direct annexation of the Crimea carried out by Russia and its following actions in Donbas triggered the new world hybrid war. “There is nothing constant in this world but inconsistency,” wrote Jonathan Swift. The key problem of the current “processual moment” is that many peo- ple, including politicians, experts, scientists and journalists, still perceive the current state of affairs as something temporary in nature. They often han- dle and interpret it as something abnormal, or rather as a “transit phase” on the path to a fundamentally different, “better future”. More importantly, those who have destroyed the world order, which until recently seemed strong and inviolable, have similar thoughts: the Kremlin state apparatus with its political, intellectual and military establishment, can be considered as “elite” only rel- atively. In general, both Russia and the West are clearly ill-prepared to accept this new reality. Whether or not this is a consequence of the inability to comprehend the current moment or is the fear to accept it is another matter. “The real secrets become secrets not because nobody knows about them,” warned Carl\n\n6. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 6 FOREWORD Gustav Jung, “but because nobody understands them”. Meanwhile, this hy- brid war, a sort of paramilitary aggression, is unique due to many parameters. These parameters include: the momentary and imaginative cause at the on- set of the war, deception, the near total moral decay and degradation of many citizens of the aggressor country, aggression that was sanctioned by the per- manent membership in the UN Security Council, and the creation of mass media support to legitimize actions. The application of these methods of “ac- tive measures” of political warfare have resulted in the consequences of untold proportions. The real trouble faced by the aggressor occurs when it attempts to put together the aims and methods of the hybrid “war of the future” with the world realities of the past. Russia is not solely responsible for the destruction of the old world order. Certainly its aggression against Ukraine (and earlier, against Georgia) became the direct cause of everything that is happening now; however, the West bears some responsibility for its policy of “washing its hands of the affair”. Western analysts are increasingly emphasizing the part the West has played. Peter Dickinson1 , aptly noted how the majority of the Western media suddenly went blind as to who the aggressor was in the Ukrainian conflict and what to call the Russian occupation. Alternatively, journalists invented some new words and word combinations whose sole purpose was to avoid the direct naming of the Russian aggression. Perspectives similar to the beliefs held by Robert Kaplan were small solace when he said: “No matter how it would limit the possibilities of Ukraine, no matter how it would complicate the existence of the EU itself, neither the European Union nor NATO will bring Ukraine into the fold... [but] your future doesn’t look grim”. In the meantime, the Western media, with its liberal-democratic world- view and principles, became a victim of the new hybrid reality. Their attempt to approach the political scene in accordance with the democratic standards of peaceful and rational coexistence was ineffective. Meanwhile, Russia was at- tempting to “revalue democratic values” through the lens of its “sovereignty”. By anticipating the classic standards of journalism, which consist of demonstrat- ing at least two views for a given situation, they were able to consciously shift the “objectiveness point” and replace it with an elaborate and massive string of lies, thus turning an objective view of the situation into something absurd. The West began to awaken after the first shock in 2014. It is unclear if the initial attempts to counter Russia were successful. But it is absolutely clear 1 In his piece for the Atlantic Council.\n\n7. T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 7 FOREWORD the West needs to change in order to find an answer. This is a serious matter that few are prepared to handle. The punitive measures levied against Russia were appallingly inadequate for the level of aggression shown and were guided by the logic of the “old world”. And Russia was most likely prepared for the consequences of its actions. On the one hand, from the geostrategic point of view, Russia may intend to destroy the existing world order of the West’s domination of the global arena. A task which Russia is currently managing very well, and from its perspective, its actions are beneficial to restoring Russia’s status as a “superpower”. But on the other hand, from the geohistorical point of view, one of the pur- poses is to return the world back to the reality of the middle of the 20th cen- tury — back to the period of the classic political realism rhetoric (“zones of influence”, “battle of the systems”, “interests balance and power bal- ance”, etc.). In other words, the geopolitical purpose of Russia with the start of the global hybrid conflict was: to destroy the existing world order in order to restore the tension of the Cold War period and to occupy a position of power in this new world order while taking into account the strengthened China. This new world order is being formed before our eyes. Russia’s efforts and actions are playing a significant role in this process. However, the problem is that the new hybrid world (dis)order will have nothing to do with the world order Russia so desperately wants to restore. It will be a world (dis)order with a new distribution of power between the countries and with a new set of hybrid wars, initiated by the new players against the enemies and the former allies alike. The new world order will feature hybrid decisions in problematic situations, often beyond the legal boundaries of the countries, or in the so — called “grey zones” of national and international law, and within hybrid international law as well. It is necessary to understand and accept that the new hybrid world (dis)orderbeingbuiltbeforeusisnotsomekindof“transitionstage”.Itisactually the new reality that cannot be extended from the fundamental reality of the past. Moreover, Russia may as well has no rightful place in this new reality due to Russia’s inefficient economy, inefficient state authority and government, and its outdated vocabulary for ideological description and axiological comprehension. In this new “beautiful world”, the risks for Russia itself have increased immensely as it released the djinn of hybrid war from his bottle and agreed that these new norms and principles of the “geopolitical debacle” apply to it as well. Avoiding the fundamental principles of the world order and violating the norms and rules of international relations, Russia thereby has lost sufficient trust and credibility as a respected international partner. Western sanctions\n\n8. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 8 FOREWORD imposed upon Russia are just the overt response to this trend. Russia’s access to the critically important resources, from financial to technological, is not limited, but their usage is now more difficult. Russia has become sensitive to the instruments and mechanisms, methods and methodologies of hybrid war in the event they are used against itself, espe- cially in the regions that are already of weakened military strength, or whose administration has been abandoned. The most susceptible region, the Russian Far East, is open to Chinese creeping expansion, which could probably start in the near future, and could last for decades. For the time being, Moscow continues to work in its domain of expertise — trying to destroy the existing reality, and it is doing it fairly successfully. It is difficult to compete with Moscow when it comes to destruction. However, con- structive decisions and measures have always been Russia’s weak spot, particu- larly nowadays. The Russian Federation has nothing to offer the world, neighboring coun- tries, or its own citizens. It is significant that the lion’s share of Russia’s pub- lic strategic and analytical documents in recent times almost never refer to the issues of development within the country. There are almost no documents concerning new strategies in its economy, social policy, ethnonational policy, medicine, health care, etc. Instead, there are plenty of “outwardly-oriented” documents concerning the foreign policy, possibilities of returning to force (in all of its aspects) abroad, and analysis of the external foes and allies. In addition, there is no internal political opposition that guarantee the development of the political system and ensure control of government in- stitutions in Russia. There is actually no open political life per se, as it is truly determined by the behind-the-scenes struggle of particular clans and interest groups. The situation closely echoes the famous phrase from the Kill the Dragon film based on Yevgenii Schartz’s play: “Well, if we are not allowed to protest, let us at least debate...” However, even the possibility to argue is being gradually destroyed as well. When it comes to the Russian foreign policy in general, it undoubtedly con- sists of further development of capabilities for waging hybrid wars (as an im- plicit continuation of the policies “according to Clausewitz”) in new regions and on new levels. Moreover, it is not confined to the European arena, but also exerts influence in the Central Asian region as well. However, Ukraine remains the focus of the Kremlin’s foreign policy activities. And it appears Russia’s practical activities will continue to focus on supporting the artificially created pseudo-republics and on continuing the hybrid warfare against our country as they adjust to the changing conditions and developments.\n\n9. T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 9 FOREWORD Russia, as it is today, poses a huge threat not only to its neighboring countries but to itself as well. This threat will persist into the future. Hopes that sanctions could somehow “calm”, “sober”, or “bring it back to normal” are merely illusory and groundless. Hope springs from the logic of “normal countries” behavior under “normal conditions” and a “normal world order”, but “normal” no longer exists. Thus, we can only trust our own powers and decisions. In order to achieve success, it is necessary to discover a new approach and a new reality by slamming the door on past typical decisions taken for granted in all spheres, including the foreign policy, military, economic, media, social policies, etc. Foreign policy strategy changes have been recently noted: “There is a theory that compares intercommunication and cooperation of countries with billiard balls in the sense that foreign policy direction does not depend on the political regime as much as the force and trajectory of the strikes do not depend on the color of the billiard balls. Though in our situation, it is not the case of only the ball color changing, as almost everything has changed, including the table geometry and the character of the force of interaction”. If we are totally honest, our main strategic goal now is not even the ques- tion of whether we are capable of finding a tactically successful response to the hybrid aggression (although it is vital), but rather whether we will be able to grasp and fully understand this new hybrid world, to understand its laws and patterns that until now have appeared to be а total chaos, and how exactly we may apply this newfound knowledge. We should not be long in changing our strategies. Those who fail to change and transform, who refuse to accept this new geopolitical game, who only per- ceive it as the “return of the good old-fashioned Cold War”, will most probably lose, and may even disappear. This moment brings new opportunities. If we are able to build a new and adequate worldview and correct our strategies, we may join the powers trans- forming this new world, however pathetic that may sound. We stand on the verge of deep transformation of our existing political, military, and economic alli- ances. We are beginning to forge new alliances. And we must take this oppor- tunity to search for answers to new and unexpected problems. We have to be more active, more creative, and become more pragmatic in our activity. This is the essential reason for the massive revision of everything that until recently seemed basic and fundamental. This does not mean Ukraine should refuse European and Euro-Atlantic integration. Not at all. But we must fill our perspective of this process with new, more realistic, and more achievable substance. It is also extremely\n\n10. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 10 FOREWORD important to consider how Ukrainian EU and NATO membership is still very distant and unclear. For this reason, it is difficult to prioritize the strategy when few believe we may actually achieve it. It is obvious that goal setting has to change dramatically, despite the permanence of the European and Euro- Atlantic integration vectors. This applies not only to the foreign policy, but nearly all fields. The problem is not that we “cannot see” how our strategies need to change; our problem is whether our current public administration system is capable of implementing this change. And can it act in accordance with change? In particular, are we prepared for strategies that go beyond the boundaries of tra- ditional practices and traditional instruments? As we undergo change, our citizens and government will likely face significant stress. If this issue is brought to the national level of perception, we must ask: Are we prepared (and if we are, when and with what outcome) to exist in the framework of the new hybrid world and to stand against hybrid wars? There is no answer to this question today, but we desperately need to find one. Ukraine is learning about its past while trying to understand its present, and everyone may come to learn about the sphere of national security, voluntarily or not. However, even the world’s hybrid war will eventually come to an end. There will be no winners in this war. Just as the beginning is hard to meas- ure and document, so will the ending lack any kind of a singlular finite event. But this war has already changed a lot in the world in creating its own design of the world’s “hybridization”. Ukraine is at the forefront of our minds as we are seeking to understand the world’s hybrid war, but we must accept that our northern neighbor will always remain our neighbor. We have to ponder the future of Ukraine. How can we start building this future now, under the circumstances of the ongo- ing war? I sincerely hope this complex monograph research, “The World’s Hybrid War: Ukrainian Forefront“ conducted by the experts of the National Institute for Strategic Studies will not only develop a particular “frame- work” for existence in the new hybrid war but will also help unite all con- cerned for the sake of a better future.

CONFRONTATION WITH THE WEST The first evidence of Russia’s foreign policy turning to confrontation with the West and restoration of its own imperial nature was V. Putin’s “Munich speech” in 2007. In it, the President of the Russian Federation not only accused the U.S. and NATO of attempts to build a unipolar world and impose their own “legislative system” on other countries, but also openly demandedthatRussia,asacountry“withathousand-yearshistory”,begiven a leadership position in international policy1 making. 1 Выступление Президента России В. Путина на Мюнхенской конференции по вопросам политики безопасности 10 февраля 2007 года [Speech of Russia’s President, V. Putin, during the Munich Security Conference on February 10, 2007] [Digital source]. — Access mode: http://izvestia.ru/news/321595\n\n13. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 14 The first implementation of these designs was a military attack by the Russian Federation on Georgia in 2008. This attack was not met by anу appropriate and adequate reaction from the international community. Thus, Russia continued moving in this direction in order to restore its ge- opolitical domination. The recent challenges thrown by Russia to the international commu- nity have forever changed the character of relations between the Russian Federation and the West. Russia was seizing the geopolitical initiative by creating problems and provocations to which Western allies were forced to react. This policy of the Russian Federation became a test for the entire inter- national security system, international law and international organizations. The current policy of the Russian authorities is an intent to provoke the authority of the international law system. This sphere of “soft law” was disregarded by Russia long ago. They violated almost all principles and obli- gations set as the foundation for the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE) and systematically failed to abide by the de- cisions of the Parliamentary Assembly for the Council of Europe (PACE). The Kremlin ignored the sphere of “soft law” while simultaneously attempting to change the “strict” and “general” international law in Europe in order to consolidate its regional influence. During the first decade of the 21st century, Russia worked via the legal framework of the security cooperation sphere to promote its agenda of change to the geopolitical bal- ance on the European continent. Verbally, Russia advocates achieving “full unity of Europe, without division lines, through implementation of equal cooperation of Russia, the EU and the USA”. In practice, however, Russia’s intent was to influence the decisions of, European countries and the EU, particularly as they related to politics, defense, and security. Lacking the ability to influence the deci- sions of NATO, and the defense and security policies of the EU member states, the Kremlin intended to gain these rights with the signing of new international legal agreements, particularly through reformation of OSCE by granting this organization a greater legal standing. Thus, Russia’s attempts to maintain and reinforce its regional influ- ence through amendments regulating relations between the countries on the European continent failed. However, it did not stop the Russian top authorities from their revisionist intentions, since international law has practically no enforcement mechanisms the for world powers. The only instruments of influence for the international community are actions\n\n14. RUSSIA’S GEOPOLITICAL MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE Chapter 1 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 15 of the member states taken against the offending states: sanctions, embargoes, etc. For these measures to be effective, they require the polit- ical will and unanimity of all the countries. Since Western countries are based on democracy and pluralism, even decisions to impose sanctions on a third country are subject to discussion. This discussion is further complicated by the Kremlin’s significant informa- tion and propaganda efforts to justify their actions. In this context, the change of the Russian lawyers’ approach to interpre- tation of the fundamental standards and principles of international law be- tween 2014 and 2015 is quite revealing. This is not a case of opposing points of view, but rather a total denial of the previous approaches. This shift is clearly seen with examples of the norms related to the territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, equal rights and self-determination of peoples2 . Of particular concern is the interpretation promoted in the international sci- entific field whose aim is to blur the ambiguity of the content norms and create a hotbed for manipulating information and conscience of citizens in the Western countries. Specifically, а manipulative and propagandistic manifestation of aggre- ssion is the most important component of Russia’s hybrid war against the West. The Kremlin has no intention to engage in a full-scale conflict with the North Atlantic Alliance. It understands that their technological and economic backwardness will result in a definite and quick defeat. Lacking sufficient capabilities to establish even regional dominance, but having ambitious revisionist plans regarding the world influence, Russia made great efforts to disrupt the foundations of power of the Western civilization. One mechanism is destruction of the conventional system of law established dur- ing the period of Western domination. This involved revelation of a large amount of system incompetence, which spread doubts regarding the sys- tem’s effectiveness among countries, and provoked the desire to implement new rules of the world order. Another mechanism used to influence Western voters was erosion of confidence in their constitutional bodies of power and, consequently, in their political systems. Also, the loss of confidence in the ability of law enforcement to protect citizens provoked intolerance, hostility, and aggres- sion towards minorities. In these circumstances, people would feel more alarmed and scared for their “unclear” future and tend to support more 2 Задорожный А.В.

These far right and left represent- atives are often noted for having contact with the Kremlin. Russia acts in several different directions to implement its aggressive strategy. The first step of the Russian Federation to gain a prominent role in international politics was to weaken the opponents and rivals by destroying their unity. The Russian expansion towards Europe was the natural direction taken towards restoring its world superpower status. Without the pos- sibility of acquiring significance as a world superpower in the current world order, Russia contemplated the destruction of the current system of international relations. Hope for outcomes included a split within NATO and European disintegration based on devaluation of the inter- national law system to a state of helplessness and incompetency. Chaos would ensue. The Russian Federation’s authorities set a course for the financial, organizational and informational support of the so-called Euroskeptics in Europe. This entailed numerous far right and some leftist political parties in the EU countries3 . In France, the “National Front” is known to receive funding from Russia4 and shares Putin’s policy in Europe. In Germany, the main apol- ogist for lifting anti-Russian sanctions is the party of the far right popu- list and Euroskeptic trend, “Alternative for Germany”. Some analysts are convinced this party is, in fact, directly supported by V. Putin’s regime5 . In Hungary, it is the nationalist far right “Jobbik” party, whose representative, B. Kova, was even accused of spying for Russia and stripped of immunity by the decision of the European Parliament when he was a MEP6 . In Italy it is the “Lega Nord” (“North League”) party. 3 ZN.UA склало список проросійських партій в ЄС [ZN.UA made a list of the pro-Russian parties in the EU] [Digital source]. — Access mode: http://dt.ua/WORLD/zn-ua-sklalo-spisok-prorosiyskih-partiy-v-yes- 195446_.html 4 Кремль финансирует французских ультраправых The Kremlin finances the French far right forces] [ [Digital source]. — 2014. — November 28. — Part 2. — Access mode: http://ehorussia.com/new/node/10131 5 Putin greift nach der AfD [Putin strives for AfD party] [ Digital source]. — Access mode: http://www.bild.de/politik/ inland/wladimir-putin/russlands-praesident-greift-nach-der-afd-kreml-netzwerk-38690098.bild.html 6 Российский шпион?

The influence of the Russian Federation has grown in other European countriesaswell.Recently,expertsandpoliticalobservershavenotedpro-Rus- sian views in the political circles in: Greece, Slovakia, Hungary, Cyprus, Italy, Serbia, Bulgaria and France. France stands out specifically as both cham- bers of its Parliament adopted resolutions in 2016 that contained a call to lift EU imposed sanctions on Russia. The initiator of the resolution in the Lower Chamber of Parliament was Thierry Mariani, a former Minister for Transport of France and a representative of Nicolas Sarkozy’s “Republicans” Party. Mariani is one of the heads of the “French-Russian Dialogue” associ- ation and is notorious for his scandalous visit to the Crimea in July 20157 . The United States of America and NATO (an organization, where everything is decided by the U.S., in the opinion of Russians) are the sub- jects of special attention in the Strategy of National Security of the Russian Federation adopted by the Presidential decree on December 31, 2015. In this document, the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in particu- lar, are accused of the following: —actions against pursuing the independent internal and foreign policy of the Russian Federation; —attempts to secure their dominance in international affairs and in pursu- ing a policy of restraint against Russia with the use of political, economic, military and information pressure; —weakening the global security system as a result of buildup, moderniza- tion and development of new types of armaments and offensive weapons; —militarization of Russia’s neighboring regions, and creation of a network of U.S. army biological labs there; —enlargement of the Alliance; —retaining the bloc approach while resolving international issues (which, in Russians’ opinion, is inefficient due to the modern migration crisis in the EU); —opposition to integration processes in the Eurasian region, and creation of instability zones there (for example, Ukraine), which has a negative impact on exercising Russian national interests; 7 The co-chair of this association is V. Yakunin, former President of the Open Joint Stock Company “Russian Railways”.\n\n17. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 18 —double standards in the war on terrorism; —involvement of communication and information technologies for achiev- ing their geopolitical goals, including ways of manipulating public opin- ion and falsifying history; —involvement of economic methods, instruments of financial, commer- cial, investment and technological policies for resolving their geopoliti- cal issues and tasks, which leads to weakening of stability of internation- al economic relations and increasing risks for repeated massive financial and economic crises8 . However, as some experts indicate, it is difficult to discuss the existence of the Russian Federation’s real strategic plan of countering the U.S. since the majority of the above-mentioned demands and accusations could fit the definition of Russia’s activity directions. An important component of Russia’s confrontation with the U.S. and NATOaretheRussianFederation’sprovocationsintheseaandairwiththepur- pose of “securing their naval military presence in the strategically important regions”9 . The Russian Federation is also looking for opportunities to display Russia’s strength by militarizing its border regions10 and carrying out massive military training exercises close to the borders of NATO member countries11 . Russia is trying to influence the inner political processes within the U.S. as well. In the light of the recent cyber-attacks against the server of the U.S. Democratic Party, experts on the issues of information security have begun to think more and more that the Kremlin is moving to a new dimension of hybrid war — information space. Analysts affirm that the Russian intelli- gence services back these groups of cyber-criminals. A characteristic feature of the Russian hacker operations over the last six months is the boldness of their aggression: Russian operations in cyber-space now aim not only to steal information but also to transform the information 8 Стратегия национальной безопасности Российской Федерации [Russian Federation's National Security Strategy] [Digital source]. — Access mode: http://www.scrf.gov.ru/documents/1/133.html 9 Отряд «Северного Флота» во главе с авианесущим крейсером «Адмирал Кузнецов» отправился в Сирию [Unit of the “Northern Fleet” led by the aircraft-carrying cruiser “Admiral Kuznetsov” headed to Syria] [Digital source]. — Access mode: http://flot.com/2016/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B423/ 10 В Швеции приняли за провокацию размещение российских «Искандеров» под Калининградом [Deploying of Russian «Iskanders» near Kaliningrad was taken as a provocation in Sweden] [Digital source]. — Access mode: http://www.newsru.com/world/11oct2016/iskanderqvist.html 11 For instance, the “Enduring Brotherhood-2016” military training of the Collective Security Treaty Organization in Belarus served this purpose.\n\n18. RUSSIA’S GEOPOLITICAL MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE Chapter 1 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 19 into a weapon. For example, Russians started to actively falsify stolen doc- uments and publish them to the Internet with the aim of propaganda and disinformation12 . Moscow's perception of the Middle East (within the traditions of the Soviet foreign policy) is a zone of rival confrontation between Russia and the U.S. With its unexpected interference in Syria, the Russian Federation became embroiled in this complicated and tense conflict, be- coming not only a participant in the military actions, but also a subject of international talks aimed at the resolution of the Syrian crisis. Russia also protects its own interests in the Middle Eastern region as one of the biggest exporters of energy supplies in the world13 . Within the Syrian issue, the Kremlin traditionally accused the U.S. of disruption of the Syrian negotiation process and of a deliberate escala- tion of the situation14 . Meanwhile, the Russian media spread information about “the successful frustration of the U.S. plans”15 and also the idea that the involvement of the American military in Syria is yet another failure of the White House’s foreign policy. The unified Europe is even more vulnerable to destabilization in the Middle East. The instability is caused by the difference in the potentials of the eco- nomically developed core and the relatively backward periphery zones (pre- dominantly in the Middle East and Black Sea regions), with their social and economic problems and continuous local conflicts. The current migration crisis and terrorist attacks in the European capitals are just the first indica- tions of future waves of chaos coming from dangerous neighbors. Insufficient attention to the resolution of security issues in the broader region results in increasing the potential difference, and consequently, new crises will arise. 12 Turns Out You Can’t Trust Russian Hackers Anymore [Digital source]. — 2016. — August 22. — Access mode: http:// foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/22/turns-out-you-cant-trust-russian-hackers-anymore 13 Российский генерал-полковник проговорился, зачем Путин убивает людей в Сирии [Russian Colonel General gave away why Putin kills people in Syria] [Digital source]. — Access mode: https://inforesist.org/rossiyskiy- general-polkovnik-progovorilsya-zachem-putin-ubivaet-lyudey-v-sirii/ 14 Комментарий Департамента информации и печати МИД России относительно российско-американских договоренностей по Сирии [Commentary of the Department of Information and Press of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regarding the Russian-American agreements on Syria] [Digital source]. — 2016. — September 27. — Access mode: http://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/ cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/2473662 15 Девис Д.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 20 Developments in recent years in the closest European neighborhood show that the scale of the Middle East challenge was underestimated, while the neighborhood policy adopted by the EU appeared to be ill- conceived, and has thus practically failed. The situation escalated owing to the Kremlin’s destructive geopolitical ambitions and attempts to disrupt the European unity. Another important trend of the Kremlin’s foreign policy expansion is an attempt to create interstate unions, alternative to the Western ones. In this process, Russia first relies on the development of relations with the People’s Republic of China and on securing positions within the coun- tries of the so-called post-Soviet space. The result of these actions is the cre- ation of various associations, such as Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), BRICS, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russia is also increasing its role and cooperation with the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In order to play a more significant part in the Middle East, the Russian Federation has also unsuccessfully tried to form the so-called “small-size triangle” (Russia — Iran — Turkey)16 . 1.2. VICTIMS OF RUSSIAN HYBRID AGGRESSION Before speaking about the hybrid policy of Russia in the post-Soviet space, we must first discuss the Transnistria conflict and the armed con- frontations and wars in the Georgian territory. This policy is being imple- mented with the call to defend the Russian-speaking citizens while simulta- neously provoking inter-ethnic and language-based conflicts. Researchers associate active inter-ethnic destabilization with the former Soviet policy of preventing independent moods in the republics of the USSR. The proof of this thesis can be found in the memoirs of the former KGB head (Soviet State Security Agency) V. Bakatin. In them, he said the State Security Agency was responsible for the formation of “international fronts” in the Soviet republics that demonstrated discontent with the central 16 Россия — США: перехват концептуального лидерства [Russia — USA: seizure of conceptual leadership] [Digital source]. — 2016. — 19 August. — Access mode: http://rusnext.ru/recent_opinions/1471636044\n\n20. RUSSIA’S GEOPOLITICAL MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE Chapter 1 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 21 government of the USSR. This strategy of “divide and rule” resulted in the disintegration of society as it was split into two implacable camps, amid the intense escalation of social tension. Instead of tolerant dialogue and a calm, balanced approach to resolving difficulties and arguments be- tween the republics and the central government, there was a veiled threat. If the republic didn’t obey, it would get an “international front” that would call for strikes, raise the issue of the republic’s borders, and question the legiti- macy of the local authorities. The activity of these “inter-fronts” would then be presented by the State Security Agency as a manifestation of the “peo- ple’s will”17 . These words describe both the Soviet KGB’s sense of policy in the Soviet republics, and the current Russian authorities, descendants from the KGB, with regard to the former colonial republics and independent states today. Georgia. The formal cause for the beginning of the war in the territory of South Ossetia and Abkhazia was their secession from Georgia. On July 23, 1992, Abkhazia restored the Constitution of the Abkhazian Soviet Republic of 1925, according to which it was declared a sovereign state. In August, an armed confrontation between Georgia and Abkhazia began. By the end of September 1993, Abkhazian and Russian military formations controlled the entire autonomous territory. On June 23, 1993, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) “peacekeeping forces”, namely Russian mili- tary units, were stationed in the region as a powerful speaker of ideas and guarantor of the “Russkiy Mir” (“Russian World”). They are still there to this day. The South Ossetia autonomous region was transformed into the Republic of South Ossetia after a series of developments between 1989 and 1991. Beginning in January 1991, a conflict between the Georgian and Southern Ossetian militaries took place. The plan of secession from Georgia was pre- sented by Ossetians as a condition for the nation’s survival. On June 24, 1992, an agreement about the principles of resolving the Georgian-Ossetian con- flict was signed. The agreement later addressed the deployment of “peace- keeping forces” when the leaders of South Ossetia declared their desire to become part of the Russian Federation. The main result of this war was Russia’s legitimization of “cutting off” the Georgian provinces by means of recognizing their independence. 17 Бакатин В.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 22 Revision of the post-Soviet borders in a heavy-handed way was not sup- ported in the world. Based on the reaction shown by other countries, Russia had no allies when it forced the border revision. As a consequence of this war in 1990s, the number of victims reached nearly 20.000 people while the Ossetian economy suffered. People in South Ossetia suffer from poverty and unemployment. Their economy is dependent on Russian emergency loans. In Abkhazia, the level of local tourism has remained unchanged since Soviet times. In fact, the entire tourism infrastructure is practically nonexistent. These days, Russian peacekeeping forces and UN observers are stationed there. In August 2008, the Russian-Georgian armed confrontation continued. An attempt by Tbilisi to restore control over Tskhinvali and the autonomous territory ended in defeat for the Georgian Army after the Russian Armed Forces immediately interceded. The day following the start of the conflict, Russian forces entered South Ossetia with armored troops, mechanized rifle troops and military air forc- es. The counteroffensive was carefully planned and efficiently carried out, which allowed the Russians to win within 48 hours, and force the main Georgian Armed Forces to retreat. On August 10, 2008, Russian troops strengthened their positions in South Ossetia18 . Russian troops continued their offensive, attacking in two directions — to the South of South Ossetia, near the city of Gori, and to the sea ports. They bombarded military air bases in Marneuli and Vaziani, which shut down the radars at Tbilisi International Airport. These offensive actions allowed Russian forces to approach the capital of Georgia making it impos- sible for them to receive outside reinforcements19 . The full-scale invasion of Georgia was stopped only by the efforts of the international community. President Mikheil Saakashvili lost the war. His decision to resolve South Ossetian conflict by force caused significant loss of lives both in Georgia and South Ossetia. However, by making this a military operation, Saakashvili forced the West to intervene and took what should have been a regional conflict to the level of an international one. This ran counter to the inter- ests of Russia, who wanted to preserve its control over the entire Caucasus 18 The Russo-Georgian War and the Balance of Power [Digital source] // Stratfor. — 2008. — August 12. — Access mode: https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/russo_goergian_war_-and_balance_power 19 King C.

On the contrary, the conflict resulted in the deployment of inter- national peacekeepers and establishment of control on the borders between South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In this manner, the danger for the Georgian settlements in the South Ossetian territory was eliminated while the absence of any open armed conflicts post factum made Georgia closer to prospective NATO membership. Additionally, this conflict encouraged Western interest in the issue of stable transit of Caspian oil through the oil pipelines not controlled by Russia20 . In the Georgian conflict, the ideology of the new Russian irredentism was applied. Russia, deployed its troops, having built a moral and legal legitimization for its actions based on the need to help fellow countrymen, who were suffering from the conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia. In recent years, thousands of residents of Georgian territories have received Russian passports and, consequently, became Russian citizens. The Russian Federation recognized the “independence” of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Kremlin’s response to the developments in South Ossetia was asymmetrical in its force and scale, and an open violation of the norms of international law. However, the inconsistent US and EU policy resulted in apparent appeasement of the aggressor, which made it feel free to act. Moldova. Transnistria only belonged to the Moldavian Autonomous Republic of the Soviet Union since 1936 (and since 1940 it became the Moldavian Republic of the Soviet Union). Transnistria is composed of three ethnic groups of similar size: Ukrainians, Moldovans and Russians. The population of the rest of Moldova is more homogenous, and speaks mostly Romanian. At the beginning of 1990s, pro-Romanian moods were widespread among the representatives of the Moldovan political elites. There also existed the idea of uniting Moldova and Romania into a single state, which was ultimately rejected by the political authorities of Transnistria. The main confrontation lines, just as in other post-Soviet republics, origi- nated in the language and ethnic spheres. On August 25, 1991, independence of the so-called Transnistria Moldovan Republic was declared. A short-term armed conflict started 20 Gressel G.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 24 between the separatists and Moldovan regular troops soon after, which culminated in a battle for the city of Bender. After the Transnistrian forces started employing tanks lent to them by the 14th Russian army stationed in Transnistria, the Moldovan side was forced to make concessions and start negotiations. In 1992, the Presidents of Moldova and Russia signed an agreement on suspension of arms, which ended the four-month war and defined Russia as one of the de facto conflict parties. Later negotiations were transferred to the “5+2” format where the “parties” of the process were Moldova and the Transnistria Moldovan Republic, while Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE became mediators. The EU and the USA held the role of ob- servers. According to agreements in 1992, the peacekeeping contingent of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation was deployed to the unre- cognized territory of Transnistria, although it was formally established only in 1995, after transformation of the former Soviet 14th army. In September 2006, the authorities of the so-called Transnistria Mol- dovan Republic, supported by the Kremlin, held the referendum on independence of Transnistria to decide upon its further integration into the Russian Federation. 97% of those who participated in the referen- dum voted “for” it; however, the results were not recognized by Moldova, Ukraine, US, EU, or the OSCE monitoring mission. Later, the represent- atives of the Russian Federation declared the referendum results would not have legal consequences. In 2016, the separatist military and the Russian Armed Forces conducted a joint military exercise simulating a counterattack against the holding of Transnistria by the illegal armed forces. Officially, Chisinau expressed con- cern, and again demanded ithdrawal of the Russian troops from Transnistria. On September 9, 2016, Yevgeny Shevchuk, President of the unrec- ognized republic, signed a decree to implement the results of the so- called referendum of 2006. This gave recognition to the independence of the Transnistria Moldovan Republic, and allowed it to further join the Russian Federation. Officials in Chisinau think it could negatively im- pact negotiations in the region. Despite the “loud” decisions, the situation is currently “frozen”. According to Moldovan legislation, Transnistria is an autonomous terri- tory with special status. A special economic system was formed de facto in the so-called Transnistria Moldovan Republic, as a hybrid of the planned\n\n24. RUSSIA’S GEOPOLITICAL MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE Chapter 1 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 25 economy and gang capitalism. This “gray zone” economy includes abun- dant smuggled goods and illegal financial operations carried out by some Russian companies. The socially vulnerable local population receives sub- sidies from the budget of the Russian Federation. While unrecognized by the international community, Transnistria dual citizenship is allowed; thus, the majority of citizens also have Russian passports. From time to time, negotiations in the “5+2” format continue to be held, but they rarely address fundamental problems, and consequently, do not contribute to resolving the crisis in general. Isolation of the territory cou- pled with the presence of Russian peacekeepers and a military base, work to contain the situation in Transnistria, but they also create preconditions for a possible rapid escalation of the conflict due to the high level of militariza- tion in the region and the Russian-Ukrainian war. After years of confrontation, the two parts of Moldova have been drift- ing apart more and more. While the biggest part of the country is orient- ed towards EU, the residents of the Transnistrian half have a clear Soviet self-identity that has not decreased with time, or rather, it is growing stronger. Soviet symbols have been used up till now — including Lenin monuments and Soviet elements in the official state symbols of the unrec- ognized republic. Transnistria today is considered one of the few successful examples of the “Russkiy Mir” (“Russian World”) model beyond Russia. 1.3. STRATEGIC PURPOSES OF RUSSIAN HYBRID AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE Desovereignization of Ukraine The role, place and scale of Russia’s participation in strategic pros- pects in the modern Ukrainian statehood are determined by the essence of Russian civilizational and geopolitical doctrine established over the last 15 years. The foundation of this model21 consists not of ideological ideas and principles, but of chauvinist ideas about the “inability” of certain peo- ple and the “responsibility” of people to themselves and their fate which 21 Documented in the Strategy of National Defense of the Russian Federation of May 12, 2009.\n\n25. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 26 completely contradicts the principles of international law and the basic standards of the UN regarding the right of nations to self-identification. In short, these ideas could be presented in the following way: • Russia admits that the development of the world order over the last 10 years of the 20th century has been taking place without Russia’s participation, and it ousted the bipolar geopolitical distribution of powers; • the Russian Federation's aspirations to become one of the influence poles and to document these changes in the new “world order”; • the necessity of further regionalization of the multipolar world to ap- prove powerful regional leaders who would play the role of world centers of powers and would fulfill the function of “responsible countries” in historically determined regions; • the revival of Russia as one of the world’s superpowers; • full-scalesubordinationofthepost-Soviet“macro-region”totheRussian Federation as a sphere of its “responsibility” and “vital interests”; • reduction of the geopolitical role of Ukraine, preventing the possibil- ity of its establishment as an independent regional leader with further decrease of its status to a third-world country totally dependent on Moscow; • implementation of forced and demonstrative reintegration of Ukraine, as an example, to the post-Soviet space under the strict leadership and control of Russia based on its “civilization values”; and in case of fail- ure of this plan — maximal destruction of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, identity and state capabilities; • pressure on Ukraine (and other countries) to coordinate their home and foreign policy with the Kremlin and Russia’s interests, and implement- ing this plan by any means and methods available; • discredit of the Ukrainian policy aimed at achieving independence from the Russian Federation; • making it impossible for Ukraine to implement European and Euro- Atlantic integration by creating obstacles for Ukraine towards its Association with the European Union and intensification of cooperation with NATO. Implementation of the above-mentioned provisions is not a chaotic emotional reaction to the external challenges, but rather implementation of Russia’s detailed and carefully designed plan of action.\n\n26. RUSSIA’S GEOPOLITICAL MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE Chapter 1 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 27 For the Russian Federation, Ukrainian accession to the North Atlantic Alliance would mean the final and total loss of Ukraine and Kyiv’s exit from the sphere of the Kremlin’s unconditional control. It would be a colossal defeat for the Kremlin in the international political arena and a huge loss to the U.S., Russia’s main rival in influencing the world polit- ical processes. Besides, if Ukraine and Georgia ally with NATO, Russia will appear virtually surrounded by the Allied countries. From Russia’s perspective, this would create an unprecedented threat to its national security, and would change the balance of power in the region in favor of a possible counterpart. The Russian state authorities also refuse to ac- cept the argument there was transformation in the nature of NATO after the end of the Cold War, and that NATO today serves mostly as an or- ganization for security. Russia is exerting systematic political, economic and military pressure on Ukraine and on the Alliance member states in order to prevent the pos- sibility of Ukrainian Euro-Atlantic integration. Having chosen the con- frontational model of the situation development, Moscow openly uses an extremely harsh rhetoric and military force for achieving its goals, as well as intelligence and mass media, with the purpose of discrediting Ukraine in the eyes of the international community. Besides, the Russian Federation is also taking steps to achieve its objec- tives within Ukraine in order to replace the acting government of the country, to reverse the Ukrainian political course and win the support of the major- ity of society to view Russia favorably. The main purpose of these activities appears to be revenge aimed at raising a puppet regime to power, and creat- ing and preserving the political situation in its favor. The Russian authorities attempt to achieve their objectives through the following measures and steps: • stimulating federalization of Ukraine with further development of a ref- erendum to change the political order; • applying moral pressure on Ukrainian society by demonstrating (with the help of the loyal mass media and agents of influence) the in- ability of the Ukrainian authorities to implement the statehood idea of Ukraine; • supporting protests, and creating conditions to split the nation’s integrity by the principle of regional egoism, and acting in the interests of, regional elites (business and local authorities);\n\n27. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 28 • breaking the balance in the political system of the country and demoral- izing state officials and state institutions in order to prevent them from carrying out their functions properly; • revitalization of secret activities of pro-Russian lobby in the state struc- tures and stimulation of various confrontations, arguments and conflicts within Ukraine with the help of this lobby; • use of a special agent network to discredit the most effective and promi- nent Ukrainian politicians who support statehood and national positions of Ukraine. In case of failure, Russia will try to create “instability zones” in Ukraine, which will lead to a state of “managed chaos” that was often tested by the Soviet Union in the poorly developed countries of Africa and Latin America. Such instability will weaken the political system of the coun- try and create conditions that, in the opinion of the Russian authorities, will grant Russia certain situational advantages and allow for blackmailing or bribing of Ukrainian officials in order to achieve objectives relating to issues of interest for the Russian Federation, trying to implement all the above mentioned methods and ways. Internal political mobilization Demonization of Ukraine in the collective consciousness of Russians has been systematic and deliberate. It would be an exaggeration to say that creation of a hostile image of Ukraine in the course of the recent years did not have prehistory in Russia. Negative images of Ukrainian people appeared spontaneously in the Russian environment due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and pres- ervation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea along with the division of the Black Sea Fleet within the boundaries of independent Ukraine, which at the beginning of 1990s was already considered by many Russians as “rob- bery” and “injustice”. This background, together with the traditionally con- temptuous and arrogant attitude of Russians towards Ukrainians (and for all other people of the former USSR) was exploited by the Russian authorities and developed into the state propagandist anti-Ukrainian policy of hatred right after the victory of the Orange Revolution, when the Kremlin felt its influence was threatened in the post-Soviet period and in its own positions within the Russian Federation.\n\n28. RUSSIA’S GEOPOLITICAL MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE Chapter 1 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 29 The protest rally on Bolotnaya Square in 2012 is often cited as the deter- mining factor for a total and ultimate turn of the Russian policy towards internal consolidation of the authoritarian regime in the Russian Federation and changes in the foreign policy. However, Ukrainians went from the cat- egory of people who were traditionally viewed with negative and arrogant attitudes by Russians to being labeled “enemies”, literally those who pose a threat. Ukrainians experienced this transformation in the minds of av- erage Russians due to the revolutionary developments in 2013 and 2014. According to the recent social surveys conducted by the Levada-Center, in the list of countries allegedly hostile towards the Russian Federation, 72% of Russians gave the first place to the U.S., and the second place went to Ukraine with the score of 48%22 . In 2015, according to the survey of the men- tioned “Levada-Center”, 59% of those surveyed described their attitude towards Ukraine either as “bad” or “very bad”. However, in January 2014, 66% of Russians declared a “good” or “very good” attitude toward Ukraine23 . The technique of creating an “enemy” image of Ukraine and Ukrainians has several components: —the primary mechanism is to deprive the enemy of a human face. In order to achieve it, giving nicknames and labeling are applied. In our case, the au- thorities have used the image of “fascism” formed in the times of the USSR; —as the “enemy” must pose a threat, a characteristic feature of anti- Ukrainian propaganda campaign became the creation of the stable “Ukraine — USA” connection. In this manner, all the negative emotions and fears associated in the minds of average Russians with the U.S., with the additional context of accusing Ukrainians of “treason”, “betrayal” and “corruptibility”, were automatically spread to our country; —denial of identity. Promotion of a long existing idea; the Ukrainian lan- guage and nation are artificial. —denial of statehood and legitimacy of the acting state authorities. Labeling Ukraine as a failed state; —creation of the opposing images of the norm and pathology, when “noble heroes” (Russian soldiers and volunteers) are opposed by “monsters”, “perverts”, “sadists”. 22 Россияне не решили, кто им враги [Russians are uncertain who their enemies are] [Digital source]. — 2016. — 02 June. — Access mode: http://www.levada.ru/2016/06/02/rossiyane-reshili-kto-im-vragi/ 23 Россияне отделяют Киев от украинцев [Russians distinguish Kyiv from Ukrainians] [Digital source]. — 2015. — 22 June. — Access mode: http://www.levada.ru/2015/06/22/rossiyane-otdelyayut-kiev-ot-ukraintsev\n\n29. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 30 Forming the image of an external enemy is the most primitive, yet most effective and quickest way of consolidating society in front of an im- aginary “foreign threat”, and constructing the national identity based on the “friend-or-foe” archetype. L. Godkov, Director of Levada-Center, said there is a specific “combination of culture comprised of fear and hope”24 that covers fulfilment of several social tasks. The first task is mobilization and patriotic consolidation of society. It is actually really hard to be united in any other way due to lack of mutual value categories such as understanding of the nation’s interests, democracy, civil rights and freedoms, etc. The second task is strengthening the leader’s position and usurpation of his or her power. The third task is obscuration of the authorities’ responsibility for the eco- nomic and social problems in the country, justification of corruption and violation of democratic freedoms and rights of the citizens. And the fourth task is intimation of a crisis that leads to intensifying the black-and-white vision of the world within society; making the work for the propagandist machine easier (by appealing to emotions, not the mind), and ruling the masses. The mechanisms of people’s mobilization by transition of the society to the state of an imaginary “war” and the necessity to unite for self-de- fense were well tested and developed in the USSR, and practically inher- ited by modern Russia. The collapse of the USSR did not mean that long ago formed mental peculiarities and characteristic features of the majority of the country’s population would experience revolutionary transformations within a short period of time. The state of an imaginary “war” is a great excuse for the state author- ities to increase their power when they are dealing with internal problems, particularly economic ones, and opportunities for resolution are lacking. All problems are practically reassigned to the enemy as the initial cause and source of trouble (the well-known poster of the Russian retired lady, “Obama, give back our pensions”25 ). Mass mobilization of this type also results in a growth of conservative “communal” feelings while everything innovative, rational and individual 24 Гудков Л.

RUSSIA’S GEOPOLITICAL MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE Chapter 1 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 31 is labeled. As previously noted by A. Rubtsov, the Head of the Center for Studies of Ideological Processes at the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia “three or four years ago had the ideology of modernization and globalization, etc. ... However, nothing came out of it. Everything turned into an idealistic tune, so now we have values, spirit and that kind of things...”26 . The actualization of the image of an enemy indicates crisis in the coun- try and significant social tensions within society the sources of which are still difficult to recognize and rationalize27 . Characterizing the development trends for Russian society in 2005, L. Gudkov noted that “propaganda cannot be efficient if it does not rely on certain expectations and demands of the collective consciousness, if it is not adequate for the already existing ideas, perceptions, legends, stereo- types of understanding of what is happening, to the mythological structures of this kind. To insert something new into the collective consciousness is almost a hopeless cause. This is the reason why dissemination of ideas about the enemy is a consequence of efforts and movement from both sides — interested and relatively rational interpretations of the ruling elites and amorphous, various mass views and ideas, explanations, beliefs, super- stitions, symbols, traditional elements of identification”28 . The operation of Putin’s current propaganda machine is based on those beliefs and tradi- tional images of Russian society. According to the study of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, in 1989 only 1% of those surveyed thought their country had enemies. At the same time, the USA, NATO and CIA did not occu- py the first positions in this “hostile” list, ceding their places to mafia, communists, profiteers and others. However, it related to the feelings of the period when the USSR collapsed. Denial of something Soviet au- tomatically meant denying the most characteristic trends of the Soviet propaganda. But in 10 years, between 1999 and 2002, 65-70% of the citi- zens stated that Russia had enemies, including in the list NATO, China, 26 Русская осень”.

Russians again readily responded to the ide- ological demands of the authorities, and the official propaganda proved again the assumption about the amorphousness of the values of society, the absence of widespread firm beliefs about what is “mutual good” and the paternalistic and infantile mentality of the majority of its citizens. Nowadays, there is a general atmosphere of “hatred towards war, not necessarily war in Syria, or in Donbas, but rather against war in general”30 . In the situation of the imaginary war and Russia’s confrontation with nearly the entire world, consolidation takes place primarily around the leader — the President. V. Putin becomes the “father of the nation”, which allows him to continue to possess his authoritative powers for an in- definite time while this “war” continues. Under these conditions of war, the meaning and authority of the intelligence and security structures often grow, increasing the budget expenses for their maintenance can be justified in the eyes of the society. Thus, in the projection of the Russian Federation’s budget for 2017, the recorded portion of expenses — over 22% — is top secret while most of the social budget expenses are reduced. 29 Ibid. 30 “Русская осень”.

T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 35 Chapter 2 WAR ON HOMELAND FRONTLINES Edited by Kononenko K. AUTHORS: 2.1. Burkovskyi P. 2.2. Dubov D. 2.1. INSTRUMENTS OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE One of the most effective instruments of Russian influence on the for- eign and domestic policy of Ukraine was the establishment of a legal poli- tical lobby in the Parliament and in the executive branch whose purpose was open promotion and support of pro-Russian politicians and political parties during local and national elections. Establishment and development of a network of Russian agents of influ- ence relied on several key factors. First, it was taking place due to the pres- ence of significant shared economic interests of Ukrainian enterprises and companies in Russia. These traditional economic ties began in the Soviet times and included: the expanding presence of Ukrainian enterprises in the Russian internal market, consumption of Russian natural gas and other raw materials at heavily reduced prices, borrowing from Russian banks, developing commercial transborder ties, establishing joint enterpris- es and cooperating in privatization and granting of political protection for “gray schemes” in bilateral trade. On the national level, the most active facilitators of Russian influence were business groups, that controlled the energy sector. Before the Orange Revolution, the most politically active Russian companies were owners of several privatized regional power distribution companies (VS Energy and Energy Standard holdings), big oil importers (Lukoil, TNK) and natural gas importers (Itera, Gazprom).\n\n34. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 36 In 2004, with the founding of RosUkrEnergo, a joint Ukrainian-Russian natural gas supplier whose Ukrainian interest was represented by the entre- preneur Dmytro Firtash, legalization of Russian insiders within the govern- ment and state-owned companies began to form. In the same year, the le- gal non-governmental organization “Russian Club” was founded under the auspices of the Head of the Administration of the President of Russia, Dmitriy Medvedev, and the Head of the Administration of the President of Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk. It was designed to unite Russian and Ukrainian politicians and entrepreneurs for endorsement of the presidential candidate, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. Between 2005 and 2009, the presence of representatives of Russian eco- nomic interests among Ukrainian politicians did not decline despite the fact that national legislative and executive power was controlled mostly by polit- ical parties intent on European integration. To the contrary, it became even more evident. For instance, in 2008, the Ukrainian entrepreneur and share- holder of the Russian Euraz metallurgical holding Valeriy Khoroshkovsky was appointed Head of the State Customs Service. Later, he was appointed First Deputy Head of the SBU (Ukrainian Security Service) and then be- came Head of the Anti-Terrorist Center. Between 2010 and 2013, the appointment of Russian businessmen with close ties to the Russian Federation appeared to be a distinctive trait of the human resource policy in public agencies commanding and controlling the Ukrainian security and military services. Particularly between 2010 and 2011, the SBU was headed by Valeriy Khoroshkovsky. In 2013, this position was held by Oleksandr Yakimenko, who would be later suspected of concealing his Russian citizenship. In 2010, Russian citizen D. Salamatin was appointed CEO of the state-owned Ukroboronprom company (Ukrainian Defense Industry) and subsequently became Minister of Defense. The activity of these insiders, directed to destroy the national security and defense sys- tem of Ukraine, was possible only due to the full support of President Viktor Yanukovich. The political influence of Russian business lobbyists fell considera- bly after the Russian annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The beginning of armed aggression in Donbass resulted from mutual trade and economic sanctions, and the massive escape of the Russian insiders also contributed to a decrease in Russian lobbying influence.\n\n35. WAR ON HOMELAND FRONTLINES Chapter 2 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 37 According to the National Bank of Ukraine data, in 2016 the share of the commercial banks with the Russian Federation capital accounted for 12.3% of the Ukrainian banking system. The international rating agency Standard & Poor’s has estimated the amount of Russian bank loans to Ukrainian borrowers at $15 to $17 billion. Among the largest debt- ors to Russian banks are subsidiaries of the state-owned Ukrzaliznytsya (Ukrainian Railway) and Vyhillia Ukrainy (Coal of Ukraine), which are located on the temporarily occupied territories. The energy sector is another point of serious concern. A number of regional power distribution companies, including one in the occupied city of Sevastopol, are owned by VS Energy, a Dutch intermediary company with Russian beneficiaries; the majority of the regional gas distribution companies belong to Group DF, an Austrian group and a Gazprom’s debtor. In both cases there is a risk that representatives of Russian business would lobby for political rulings to block privatization of state-owned companies or to lift restrictions and allow participation of the Russian capital in their privatization. Also, in the energy sector, Russian companies are expected to collude in protecting mechanisms of the non-transparent price policies and debt relief, which further complicates relations between the Ukrainian government, Western partners, and international financial institutions. Another direction of strengthening the legal Russian presence in Ukrainian politics emerged earlier than the economic one — the establish- ment of close ties between the Russian and Ukrainian leftist and center-left political parties. Since1990s,theCommunistPartyofUkraine,andlateralsotheSocialist Party of Ukraine, openly declared economic, political and security reinte- gration of Ukraine to the Russian geopolitical projects in the post-Soviet space as their program political objectives. Due to the votes of the MPs, members of the Communist Party of Ukraine and the Socialist Party of Ukraine, a number of international agreements complying with Russian interests have been ratified in the Ukrainian Parliament. In fact, in 2004, the support of the Communist and Socialist Parties of Ukraine was crucial for ratification of the Framework Agreement on Creation of a Common Economic Space (between Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan). If its provisions had been implemented, Ukraine would have lost the opportunity to seek association with the EU. In 2010, the ratification of the Agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation regarding\n\n36. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 38 the issue of the Russian Federation’s Black Sea Fleet deployment in the terri- tory of Ukraine became one of the main stages of legalizing the intensive pres- ence of the armed forces and intelligence service of the Russian Federation in the territory of Ukraine. The resulting agreement extended the term of de- ployment of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol from 2017 to 2042. On the regional level, particularly in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv and Odesa regions, the populist par- ties (i.e. the Party of Regions, the Donetsk Republic Party, the Russian Bloc, the Russian Unity and Fatherland parties) were competing with the leftist parties for the right to represent the interests of Russia. In January 2014, the regional leadership of these parties provided organizational and financial support to the Berkut special police force and the “Anti-Maidan” and “For Russian Unity in Crimea” movements. Their activities were used by Russia as a cover-up for the start of the armed aggression against Ukraine. Notably, theleaderoftheRussianUnityParty,SerhiyAksionov,wasillegallyappointed head of the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea on February 27, 2014. He steered administrative and organizational support for an illegitimate referendum held on March 16, 2014 leading to the annexation of the Crimea. In Donetsk, Andriy Purgin, one of the leaders of the banned NGO “Donetsk Republic”, led the seizure of the administrative buildings and later, as the “first Vice Prime Minister”, participated in the organiza- tion of the illegitimate referendum on “independence” in Donetsk region. Despite how the Communist Party was banned by court decision in December 2015, many members of local organizations of the above-mentioned political parties and civil movements were charged with participation in the unrest and cooperation with the Russian intelligence services. Protection of Russian interests still persists as an attractive social and political activity. For example, the third largest parliamentary party in the Verkhovna Rada — Oppositional Bloc, and also some MPs elected in the majority dis- tricts in Odesa, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, adhere to the openly pro- Russian positions. Regarding the civil groups and organizations, the Ukrainian Choice — People’s Right Organization, chaired by the for- mer co-founder of the Russian Club, Viktor Medvedchuk, conduct activities to promote Ukraine’s integration into the Eurasian Economic Union. Another important direction of Russian influence was the use of an entire complex of trans-border ties with the border regions of Ukraine and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea for making networks of vertically\n\n37. WAR ON HOMELAND FRONTLINES Chapter 2 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 39 integrated structures of political influence. These structures consisted of MPs and members of local councils elected in the regional constituencies located in the close vicinity of the Russian border, who attempted to influ- ence the staff composition of the territorial law enforcement departments and to use local economic and administrative resources for mobilizing citi- zens in support of Russian policy. It is worth mentioning that development of these structures between 2004 and 2014 was possible due to the inability of law enforcement to prosecute the organizers of the All-Ukrainian Congress of the Verkhovna Rada MPs of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the local council participants in Luhansk region. The Congress delegates from the central and region- al executive bodies and invitees (including the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, Head of Donetsk Regional Council, Boris Kolesnikov, Head of Luhansk Regional Council, Oleksandr Yefremov, Head of Kharkiv Regional Council, Evhen Kushnariov, Mayor of Moscow, Y. Luzhkov, and representatives of the Russian Embassy) presented an initiative to grant these regions the status of autonomous republics within federal Ukraine and proclaim them the “Southern-Eastern Ukrainian Autonomous Republic”. Beginning in February 2014, these vertically organized network struc- tures of political influence were used by pro-Russian politicians in several southern and eastern regions of Ukraine to organize and promote the sep- aratist movements and prepare the illegitimate referenda on “autonomy” and “independence”. Later, Oleksandr Yefremov, former head of Luhansk Regional State Council and former head of the parliamentarian group of the Party of Regions in the Verkhovna Rada, was arrested and charged with carrying out these activities. A criminal case was opened against Alla Aleksnadrovska, a former MP and member of the Communist Party of Ukraine, on suspicion of separa- tism with evidence of attempts to disrupt the territorial integrity of Ukraine after the Minsk Agreements of February 12, 2015. According to the tes- timony of Oleksiy Bryukhanov, the city governor of Pivdenne in Kharkiv district, the representatives of Ms. Aleksandrovska offered a bribe to mem- bers of the City Council to approve amendments to the Constitution, that would permit local elections for heads of regional state councils and judges. According to the SBU (Ukrainian Security Service), the same proposals were made by A. Aleksandrovska to other heads of city councils in Kharkiv region. Eventually, these addresses were planned to spread the idea that “spe- cial status” laws were necessary in Kharkiv region — “Slobozhanshchyna”.\n\n38. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 40 Meanwhile, the majority of the district MPs from the Oppositional Bloc actively promoted ideas about the “special status” for certain regions. In particular, under cover of legislative initiatives to develop regional econo- mies, laws were drafted on the “special status” of the Zaporizhzhia region and proposed by the MP. A draft law on the “special zone” was also regis- tered in Odesa by Vadym Rabinovich, Mykola Skoryk and Oleksiy Presman. In both cases, the politicians expected to use the failure of the initiatives to provoke and escalate social and political tensions in the regions and mobi- lize supporters for integrating Ukraine with Russia. No less dangerous than the formation of these structures was the activity to support the movements that claimed to have another “special” identity, different from the Ukrainian one in other regions. Thus, risks of separatism were present in the attempts of certain civil movements in Zakarpattia to separate the new “Ruthenian nationality” from the Ukrainians. These risks emerged in 2007 when the Zakarpattia Regional Council, with the support of Viktor Baloha, head of the Secretariat of the President of the Ukraine, recognized the nationality “Ruthenian” in its territory and filed a petition to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to recognize this nationality in legislation. Later, representatives of the “Ruthenian” centers, who had become mem- bers of the Coordination Council of Ruthenian organizations, became active supporters of V. Baloha’s United Center political party. From 2008 to 2015, this political force managed to develop a regional vertically integrated network structure of political influence. It has been controlling many town and local councils in Zakarpattia region. If another internal political crisis occurs, ca- pabilities of such a network in Zakarpattia can be used for violating the state territorial integrity. An example of an internal political crisis could be due to the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, which granted “special status” for certain territories, or in the event of a new armed aggression of Russia, 2.2. MEDIA SUPPORT OF HYBRID WAR As mentioned before, the real start of the information hybrid aggression was in 2007. At that time Russia carried out vigorous activities to strength- en its position in the Ukrainian information and media space by means of\n\n39. WAR ON HOMELAND FRONTLINES Chapter 2 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 41 conventional and digital media, and also used social network topics and messages to prepare the target audience for further armed aggression or to encourage going over to the enemy during the active phase of confronta- tion. One of the instruments used was the activities of the oligarch groups supporting former President V. Yanukovych. These groups used Ukrainian mass media for their personal gains; however, they often used the media for the interests of the Russian Federation as well. In addition, the tradition of inviting editors-in-chief, news anchors and TV hosts from the Russian Federation to Ukrainian channels and newspaper editorial offices compli- cated the response to the escalation of events leading to the confrontation between traditional media and the so-called early citizen. Obviously, the media and propaganda of the Russian Federation worked against Ukraine during the preparation period with the targeting of tradi- tionally pro-Russian industrial regions of Ukraine (that also had close eco- nomic ties with Russia) and also certain target groups in Central, Northern and Western regions of Ukraine. Among these groups of citizens were: pub- lic servants, elderly citizens, and the intellectual and artistic elites. Russia’s presence on social networking sites was also significant (primar- ily, the most numerous and popular in the post-Soviet space Odnoklassniki and VKontakte social media) where various thematic groups and communi- ties have been created, and various pro-Russian messages have been thrown in on the pages of politicized groups. The Russian Federation began to test and improve its technology in 2010, during the internal election campaigns in order to discredit the Russian oppositional forces. The cyber-activity on the preparatory stage was minimal; however, it intensified significantly during the period of Euromaidan, when quasi- independent hacker groups, such as CyberBerkut, acted in the interests of the previous political regime of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. The information and media component of the hybrid war became re- current for the entire Russian aggression in its active phase. Relying on many years of preparation in the informational and psychological brain- washing of Ukrainian citizens, Russia managed to considerably disorganize Ukrainiansocietyintheearlystagesofaggression,andplayonthelongstand- ing destructive topics, to decrease the support of the state authority activi- ties by citizens. Russia’s campaign included partial buying out of Ukrainian media (local and nationwide), use of strategic content (books, TV series, mov- ies, pseudo-scientific and scientific research and studies, etc.), and an active\n\n40. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 42 campaign in social media. In addition, the enemy applied (and continues to apply) methods of electronic warfare, seizure of telecommunication equip- ment directly in the conflict zone, and also carry out partially successful cy- ber-attacksagainstthestateauthorities,orobjectscriticaltotheinfrastructure. TheannexationoftheCrimeawascarriedoutwithactiveinformationand media support and by influencing the media infrastructure of the peninsula. The leading Russian information agencies, federal TV channels and also pro-Russian activists all over Ukraine broadcast and spread messages that discredited the Armed Forces of Ukraine cementing the idea of the Crimea’s inevitable occupation (and pseudo-legitimacy of this process) and discredit- ing the conduct of the Ukrainian authorities. These measures were accom- panied by the seizure of the TV and radio broadcast infrastructure, blocking of certain print publications, TV channels, companies and radio stations, and seizure of internet on the peninsula. Along with the key structures in the security and defense of Ukraine, the departments of courier communication, objects of special and govern- mental communication had also been seized on the peninsula. There were also attempts to disrupt the National system of confidential communication. The aggressor carried out the same activities in the Separate Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk. However, due to the difficulties of implementing the Crimean scenario in Donbass, the occupational forces resorted to stricter and more violent counterattacks to the pro-Ukrainian information sphere. Kidnappings and arrests of journalists, activists, streamers and bloggers took place in order to prevent the circulation of an alternative media picture from the occupied territories. In addition, similar to the Crimea, there were numerous cases of changing sides by employees of TV and radio companies that were seized by Russians. Later on, the same employees started work- ing for the new media created by the Russian terrorist forces. Starting in the summer 2014, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic (with the participation of Russian advisors) began converting the media space of the territories into an “information ghetto” where there was no chance of seeing or hearing an alternative perspective or receiving true coverage of events. Institutionalization of these terrorist structures in the form of puppet administrations and the foundation of the “Ministry of Information of Donetsk People’s Republic” cemented this tendency. Overall, all the key decisions regarding the functioning of the media space іn the occupied ter- ritories were controlled by Russian experts working on a rotational basis.\n\n41. WAR ON HOMELAND FRONTLINES Chapter 2 T H E W O R L D H Y B R I D WA R : U K R A I N I A N F O R E F R O N T 43 Many of the Russian Federation measures were aimed at imposing information and psychological pressure on the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine directly deployed in the zone of an anti-terrorist oper- ation (ATO). It was carried out by seizing control of telecommunications networks (for example, mobile phone connections) and sending SMS, aimed at weakening the martial spirit of the soldiers. There were also several cases of Russians intercepting signals of the military personnel’s mobile devices in order to adjust artillery fire against them. The Russian and terrorist media also had access to print publications and radio production in the conflict zone. This activity continues to this day. The information and media component of hybrid aggression was also realized in other directions other than the areas occupied in the Ukrainian territories. One of them was the territories bordering the confrontation zones. The main goal there was propaganda of ideas of Novorossiya (and “DPR” and “LPR” as their practical realization), futility of resistance, appeal to the economic problems of the region (that allegedly deteriorated due to Kyiv’s policy in the region), and imposing ideas of “Slavic unity”, “common history”, “brotherhood”, etc. As a result, the local population had no clear position regarding the conflict and acquiesced unless their living situations deteriorated directly. The destruction of the Malaysian “Boeing” MH17 by the Russian Federation was an important event in the hybrid aggression. The Russian media coverage reflected the main approach of the Kremlin to the informa- tion confrontation. First, accumulate a large number of different versions of an event (providing the potential plurality of the “truths”). Second, shift responsibility for the tragedy to Ukraine, falsifying “evidence” of the official Ukrainian involvement. And finally, if unable to convince the target audi- ence (except for the internal Russian audience) of their version, withdraw from the process and ignore conclusions of international organizations. An almost identical approach was used by Russia to all information and media actions within the active phase of the hybrid war. The Russian Federation continues to carry out special information operations throughout Ukraine. After imposing broadcasting restrictions for Russian channels, its activity is concentrated predominantly on social media, or on mass media that is only partially regulated (including those distributed for free). These efforts are aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian\n\n42. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES 44 authorities, affecting foreign political discourse and the mobilization pro- cess, restoring full-fledged Ukrainian power to the liberated territories, and working with internally displaced persons (IDP). Strategically, the aim of these activities is an artificial initiation of “Maidan 3.0” — a step con- sidered by Moscow important to weaken Ukraine in the face of unresolved military aggression. These attempts are ongoing. Research of independent analytical groups based on the open data suggests the activity of Russian propagandists has not decreased, especially in social media. A narrow circle of administrators of quasi-ultrapatriotic groups continues their psychologically destructive activity with the help of “bots”, which are aimed at renewal of discussion within Ukrainian society about the necessity of “the third Maidan”. Apartfromtheinformationalandpsychologicalconfrontation,theRussian Federation started to use the cyber-component more actively. In particular, since 2013, the most dangerous type of cyber-attacks against state defense sys- tem have only increased. These attacks are well-documented1 . The attacks were directed predominantly against state institutions and hadtheevidentpurposeofstealinginformation(primarilysecretofrestricted access). In the context of the Black Energy 3 attack, it was first aimed at the crit- ical (energy) infrastructure, and appeared to be successful (the attackers had been preparing it since the end of 2014). It became possible to decrease losses caused by this attack only due to the fact that the responsible infor- mation systems were only partially modernized, which made it possible to reshuffle them quickly to the manual mode. 1 Documented APT-attacks in Ukraine include Snake, Uroboros, Sofacy/APT28, Epic Turla, Black Energy 2 and 3, Armageddon, and others."
