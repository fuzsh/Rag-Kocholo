After he boldly declared he would ask Pope Benedict XVI to consider granting the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Greek-Catholic Church patriarchal status, he opted <strong>for</strong> a tactful approach when meeting face-to-face. He acknowledged that he didn’t mention at all the Church’s decades-long pursuit of a patriarchate during his March 31 private audience with the pontiff, which he described as brief. “<strong>The</strong>re wasn’t and won’t be excessive importunity on this matter, from our end. We will work,” Major Archbishop Shevchuk told the British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) in an interview published the same <strong>day</strong>. “Our visit to the holy father didn’t have as its goal raising the issue about the patriarchate or our longstanding attempts <strong>for</strong> such development and completing the status of our Church.” His stance was quite different just two <strong>day</strong>s earlier in Kyiv, however, when he was asked by a correspondent from the First National Television Network what he planned to discuss with the Pope Benedict XVI. “Obviously we prepared very many points at the Synod which we must present to the holy father. Truly we will say that we are that Church which is developing, and each Eastern Church which is developing is moving towards a patriarchate, because a patriarchate is a natural completion of the development of this Church,” the major archbishop said at his first official press conference, held on March 29. He was referring to the Synod of Bishops held March 21-24. <strong>The</strong> sudden reversal revealed that the otherwise talented major archbishop has already begun the process of learning the ropes of politics and the media, as indicated by both clergy and laity. Major Archbishop Shevchuk was accompanied by several bishops on his five-<strong>day</strong> visit to Rome, including Archbishop-Metropolitan Stefan Soroka of the Philadelphia Archeparchy, Bishop Paul Patrick Chomnycky of the Stam<strong>for</strong>d Eparchy, and Bishop Ken Nowakowski of the New Westminster Eparchy. <strong>The</strong> entourage of bishops agreed that raising the issue of a patriarchate – when presenting the major archbishop <strong>for</strong> the first time – would have been “premature,” Archbishop Soroka told <strong>The</strong> <strong>Weekly</strong>. “It would have been unwise, and (Continued on page 17) Ontario establishes annual <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Heritage Day TORONTO – <strong>The</strong> Ontario Provincial Parliament on March 24 passed a bill that proclaims September 7 each year as <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Heritage Day. Bill 155, the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Heritage Day Act, proclaims an annual <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Heritage Day in the province of Ontario. During the debate of the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Heritage Day Act, members of all three parties – Progressive Conservative, Liberal and New Democratic – rose to voice their support of the bill and to reflect upon the many contributions that <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadians have made to Ontario. <strong>The</strong> preamble to the bill notes: “<strong>The</strong> first official <strong>Ukrainian</strong> immigrants, Vasyl Eleniak and Ivan Pylypiw, arrived in Canada on September 7, 1891. Soon afterwards, <strong>Ukrainian</strong> immigrants began arriving in Ontario in larger numbers and to<strong>day</strong> Ontario is home to more than 336,000 <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadians. <strong>The</strong>re are over 1.2 million Canadians of <strong>Ukrainian</strong> descent across the country. “Many <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s fled their homeland to find freedom from oppression and a better life in Canada. Both Ontario and Canada, by way of the Holodomor Memorial Day Act, 2009, and the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Famine and Genocide Zenon Zawada Father Andrii Soroka (left) of Poland and Bishop Taras Senkiv lead the funeral procession in <strong>Stryi</strong> on March 26 <strong>for</strong> Bishop Yulian Gbur. by Zenon Zawada Kyiv Press Bureau STRYI, Ukraine. – <strong>The</strong> world’s <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Catholics turned their attention to Kyiv on March 27 <strong>for</strong> the enthronement of their new leader, Major (‘Holodomor’) Memorial Day Act (Canada), have recognized the genocide by famine that occurred in Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 under the Soviet Communist regime led by Joseph Stalin. On August 24, 1991, the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Parliament declared Ukraine as an independent democratic state from the Soviet Union. Canada was the first nation in the Western world to recognize Ukraine’s independence. “Ontarians of <strong>Ukrainian</strong> descent have left and continue to leave a historic mark on our province. <strong>The</strong>ir contributions span communities across Ontario and are reflected in our economic, political, social and cultural life. <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadians have played an important role in the development of Ontario into one of the most desirable places in the world to live and have contributed to making Canada the great country that it is to<strong>day</strong>. It is important to recognize and celebrate these contributions.” On March 30 the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadian Congress congratulated the legislature in the province of Ontario and the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadian Congress Ontario Provincial Council (UCC-OPC) on the passage of Canada’s first <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Heritage Day.

Yet it was the <strong>day</strong> be<strong>for</strong>e, in his native city of <strong>Stryi</strong> in the Lviv Oblast, that proved exceptionally symbolic <strong>for</strong> the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Catholic Church. (Continued on page 4) “In the context of the 120th anniversary of <strong>Ukrainian</strong> settlement in Canada, it is appropriate <strong>for</strong> governments to acknowledge the role of <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s as nation-builders in settling this country,” stated UCC National President Paul Grod. “In this regard, I would like to congratulate Gerry Martiniuk, MPP (Cambridge) <strong>for</strong> introducing the bill, and co-sponsors Donna Cansfield, MPP (Etobicoke Centre) and Cheri DiNovo, MPP (Parkdale-High Park). We are pleased that all parties supported this important legislation.” Mr. Grod also congratulated UCC Ontario Provincial Council President Yvan Baker and his executive “on their hard work in making this very important initiative a reality. “ He added, “In this 120th anniversary of <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadian settlement, we encourage the federal government and provinces to take measures to properly recognize the contribution of <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s to building Canada.” <strong>The</strong> <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadian Congress is the voice of Canada’s 1.2 million-strong <strong>Ukrainian</strong> community. <strong>The</strong> Congress brings together under one umbrella all the national, provincial and local <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Canadian organizations."
