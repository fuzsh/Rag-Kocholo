        "text": "\"\"The analysis showed that the Ukrainian media system, like the media in Europe (and the rest of the world), are undergoing the processes of commercialization, tabloidization, and concentration of media ownership. What is specific to Ukraine, however, is that the concentration of market ownership is predominantly conditioned by political and not just commercial interests. The comparison of the Ukrainian media market with the markets in Central and Eastern Europe showed that Ukrainian commercial media have much more in common with the media of south European post-communist countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia) than with the media in Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic. Compared to the “advanced” new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine has not managed to create a large and developed media market, where the high profits of media enterprises can ensure their independence from political interests. Like the countries of Southern Europe and some post-Soviet countries (excluding the Baltic states), Ukraine has an underdeveloped media market with a low advertising budget. As a result, most of its private media are unable to cut the links that make them economically dependent on political interests. As is also the case in the countries mentioned above, the Ukrainian market hosts too many media, further impairing both their profitability and their autonomy. The market “overpopulation” in all of these countries has essentially the same cause—media owners set up or maintain media businesses not in quest of financial success but to exercise political influence. What is specific to Ukraine, however, is the predominance of oligarchs as owners of its media. These industrial-financial magnates are “external” to the media industry, because their main business interests are not in the media but in steel, coal, energy, banking, and other spheres. They see media ownership as a means to further their economic interests, which depend extensively on political decisions. They use the media to gain political weight in order to influence these decisions. Oligarchic ownership of Ukraine’s major media considerably constrains their autonomy. Because they are politics-driven rather than market-driven, Ukraine’s most important media enterprises are anything but politically independent. Significantly, oligarchic ownership of the media enhances the risk of introducing centralized control over the media. When a media market is divided between a few owners highly dependent on politics, it is easier to get their compliance to serve a ruling political group than would be the case if media owners were more numerous and more independent. The past decade of media history in Russia and recent events in Ukraine give convincing proof of this. The Ukrainian media market differs from media markets in Central and Eastern Europe in two other ways. First, the privatization of the media is still incomplete and thus there are a large number of state-owned and municipal media. Second, it is in competition with the powerful presence of a neighboring (Russian) media market supported by a larger readership and a larger advertising budget. Both these features distort market competition in Ukraine and reduce the sustainability of the majority of its players. What is common to the media in Ukraine and such countries as Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, or Albania is that in all of them the state makes recurrent attempts to exert pressure on private media. The means of influencing the media market in Ukraine and these other countries include flawed and frequently changing media legislation and licensing policies, and, in addition, the widespread misuse of the law by the government. An important obstacle to the development of a strong Ukrainian media market is the general disregard for the law in the country. The unhealthy situation whereby the law does not protect freedom of the press, but is used to punish of critically minded media, aggravates the condition of the national media market and restricts the independence and pluralism of the opinions voiced in it.\"\""
