        "text": "Graham Stack in Kyiv for business new europe (www.bne.eu)\n\nJune 11, 2012\n\nQuestions are growing over the role played by Latvia’s Trasta Komercbanka in controversial Ukrainian state tenders in 2011 allegedly involving the embezzlement of hundreds of millions of dollars. According to bneenquiries and the tender documents viewed by bne, companies participating in the tenders were mere creatures of the Latvian bank, which has links to Ukrainian Minister of Energy Yury Boiko.\n\nAs bne previously reported, in March 2011 a UK shell company called Highway Investment Processing won a tender to supply a drilling rig for $400m to Chornomornaftogaz, which is a fully-owned subsidiary of national gas company Naftogaz Ukrainy. Norway’s offshore drilling giant Seadrill later confirmed that it originally supplied the rig to Highway but for only $248.5m, raising questions about the size of the intermediary’s mark-up, and who was the lucky beneficial owner of Highway.\n\nIn two parallel tenders in March 2011, a UK shell company registered at the same address as Highway Investment, Verylux Company, also with unknown beneficiaries, won contracts totalling over $150m to provide supply ships to the same Naftogaz subsidiary Chornomornaftogaz. Market analysts pointed to nearly 100% mark-ups for those deals. Naftogaz has disputed any irregularities in the tenders.\n\nAdding to suspicions that the Naftogaz tenders were rigged, journalist investigations and tender documents show that all shell companies involved in the tenders – both winners and losers – had been set up by the same company service provider, International Overseas Services (IOS). A Ukrainian court, approving a police request to search IOS Kyiv offices in September 2011 in connection with a different money-laundering case, noted that IOS: “specializes in creating offshore companies registered under fictive persons for the purpose of tax minimization and transferring funds to offshore banks.”\n\nAccording to the investigation cited, IOS is run for and by Latvia’s boutique banks – banks that mainly service clients from the former Soviet countries incorporated as offshore companies in the West. Thus, it was no surprise to discover that the winning company in the $400m tender for the drilling rig, Highway Investment, has its bank account at Latvia’s Trasta Komercbanka, the country’s 12th largest by assets, according to the tender documents and ensuing contract as seen by bne.\n\nDistrusting Trasta\n\nRemarkably, or perhaps not, the tender documents that have viewed by bne showed not only that the winner (Highway Investment) in the drilling rig tender had its bank account at Trasta Komercbanka, but that the runner-up in the same tender (New Zealand-registered Falcona Systems) also had a bank account at Trasta Komercbanka. Falcona was runner-up in a parallel tender for supply vessels as well. Ukrainian legislation requires a minimum of two bidders.\n\nbne’s examination of the tender documents shows that Trasta Komercbanka’s involvement runs even deeper. The Falcona Systems tender documents specify that power of attorney over the company was held by a certain Raisa Mykolaivna Dziuba, with passport details provided. bne located and talked to Dziuba, who confirmed her passport details. But far from being an energy industry executive, Dziuba is a real estate agent in Kyiv employed by a minor player AESI International Development. She is currently trying to sell an office and parking space in the downtown “Diplomat Hall” development, as well as a suburban detached villa.\n\nAsked about her connection with Falcona Systems, as evidenced by the tender documents, Dziuba answered simply: “I work for Trasta Komercbanka, I have a contract with them.” Dziuba confirmed in the framework of her relationship with Trasta Komercbanka she formally holds power of attorney for a number of companies established by Trasta Komercbanka clients. Dziuba, who does not speak English, showed no knowledge of Falcona Systems operations, nor of the Naftogaz tender bid, despite being named in the tender documents.\n\nbne established independently one other company for which Dziuba apparently holds power of attorney: Panama-registered Fondberg Trading Inc. The company is listed on the website of a Kyiv travel agent Magic Travel as its “foreign partner”, with Dziuba as its director, and a bank account at Trasta Komercbanka. Dziuba said she had never heard of the company and had nothing to do with the tourism branch – except for frequent trips to Riga.\n\nThe findings may point to Dziuba’s power of attorney for Falcona Systems being fictive and organized by Trasta Komercbanka, which suggests that Falcona Systems is a creature of the bank itself.\n\nThe ultimate beneficiaries of companies that have nominee directors and shareholders, such as Highway Investment and Falcona, exercise ownership through their power of attorney. This document is crucial for banks and counterparties to establish the real beneficiaries of a company in order to comply with know-your-customer legislation. A fictive power of attorney is thus often a sign of foul play afoot. “Of course it is an illegal action,” Anna Dravniece, adviser to the chairman of Latvia’s Financial and Capital Market Commission, tells bne, referring to the creation of a fictive power of attorney. Even if it was solely the company’s initiative – doubtful in this case – the bank is obligated under anti-money laundering legislation to verify the data provided by customers, according to Dravniece.\n\nThe apparent inclusion of a fictive power of attorney in the Falcona tender documents could put into question the results of the tender in Ukraine – and all the more if the power of attorney specified for the $400m winning company, Highway Investment, was also shown to be fictive.\n\nAccording to the tender documents, power of attorney for Highway Investment was held by a certain Pavel Dvulichanskii. None of the contracting parties with Highway Investment questioned by bne have ever reported dealings with anyone of that name. Lacking passport details, bne was not able to establish the identity of Dvulichanksii, who has no public profile, despite being technically responsible for deals measuring hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nTrasta Komercbanka said it could not comment on clients’ arrangements, but assured that the bank played no part in the Naftogaz tenders and connected deals. Highway Investment could not be reached under their advertised telephone number.\n\nThe Ukrainian connection\n\nTrasta Komercbanka’s role in the controversial Chornomornaftogaz tenders is sensitive not just because of questions raised about the bank’s probity, but because of the strong links between Trasta Komercbanka and Ukraine’s energy minister, Yury Boiko, who masterminded the Naftogaz 2011 spending spree.\n\nAccording to the Trasta Komercbanka website, owner of 43.2% of the bank and chairman of the board is Igors Buimisters, a native of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. According to his resume, Buimisters in the first half of the last decade worked in Ukraine as consultant to the management of Naftogaz, which was headed at that time by none other than Yury Boiko.\n\nBritish citizen Charles Treherne, who holds a 9.3% stake in Trasta Komercbanka, according to the bank’s website, and sits on the supervisory board, also has links to energy minister Boiko via Ukrainian gas oligarch Dmitro Firtash. Treherne was deputy chairman of the supervisory board of Firtash’s Vienna-registered Centragas AG. Centragas is the ownership vehicle for Firtash’ 45% stake in the scandal-tainted gas trader Rosukrenergo.\n\nRosukrenergo until 2009 was Ukraine’s dominant private gas trader earning billions of dollars by supplying cheap gas from Turkmenistan to Ukraine, an arrangement established in 2004 when Boiko was head of Naftogaz. Leaked minutes of a Rosukrenergo shareholders meeting from 2004 appear to show Boiko nominated by Centragas to a founding Rosukrenergo shareholders’ meeting. Boiko has in the past denied ties to Rosukrenergo.\n\nThe cosy Rosukrenergo arrangement ended as a result of the January 2009 gas agreements between Naftogaz and Russia’s Gazprom, for which former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko is currently serving a seven-year jail sentence for signing.\n\nIvan Fursin, with 5% in Rosukrenergo Firtash’s junior partner, has a 20-33% stake in Trasta Komercbanka, according to information at the Latvian financial regulator’s website.\n\nTrasta Komercbanka’s links to Boiko, combined with its involvement in the controversial March 2011 Naftogaz tenders he masterminded, where journalists and opposition allege that over $200m went missing, reflect badly on the energy minister. But while questions have been raised in Ukraine over the conduct of the tenders, given the current constellation of power in Ukraine no law enforcement action is likely.\n\nIn Latvia, however, question marks continue to accumulate around Trasta Komercbanka. Apart from its involvement with the controversial Naftogaz tenders, at least two other cases raised eyebrows last year. In September 2011, asset retrieval proceedings by Kazakhstan’s BTA bank against its former owner Mukhtar Ablyazov at the High Court of London found that Ablyazov had diverted $1.5bn of BTA assets via offshore companies to accounts at Trasta Komercbanka, with a Belarusian farmer holding an apparently fictive power of attorney for the offshores involved. And a Ukrainian court in September 2011 found a small Dnipropetrovsk bank had shifted a total of $2bn out of the country via IOS-established companies to accounts at Trasta Komercbanka. “The bank controls all clients operations carefully in compliance with Anti Money Laundering Law. If the bank suspects or finds out that a client acts unlawfully, according to the law it notifies the national authority,” Trasta Komercbanka assured bne.\n\nLatvia’s banking sector is still reeling from the 2011 collapse amid hundreds of millions of missing euros of the country’s 9th largest bank, Latvijas Krajbanka, and its Lithuanian parent bank Snoras, as a result of allegedly illegal activities of its owner Vladimir Antonov. The Krajbanka debacle raised urgent questions about whether Latvia’s regulators are up to the job of handling Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs’ shenanigans. Latvia can ill-afford a repeat performance.\n\nGraham Stack in Kyiv for Business New Europe (www.bne.eu)\n\nThe UN has pinpointed defence exporters in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporozhe as violating arms sanctions imposed on Eritrea, via a UK trading company, according to a bne source. If true, the allegations will add to Ukraine’s notoriety as a recurrent infringer of arms sanctions, and to the UK’s reputation as a no-questions-asked jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to a bne source at the UN with knowledge of the matter, a UK company, Espace Soft Trading, linked to defence plants in Ukraine’s industrial hub of Zaporozhe is considered to have supplied defence technology and training to Eritrea in violation of UN sanctions. Espace Soft is believed to have overhauled the Eritrean Airforce’s Sukhoi fighter planes and providing training to pilots.\n\nEritrea is ranked internationally as one of the world’s worst dictatorships. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions in 2009 due to dictator Isaias Afawerki’s support for the Al-Shabab Islamist militants in neighbouring Somalia’s civil war.\n\nKyiv’s apparent failure to comply with international arms sanctions will heighten fears about the rule of law and state corruption in Ukraine. The unhindered use of UK shell firms to obscure traces of illegal arms deals will also add to criticism of the UK’s lax regulation of company registration.\n\nAccording to bne’s UN source, Espace Soft’s operations in Eritrea were probably linked to Zaporozhe’s state-owned MIG Remont, Ukraine’s leading military aviation overhaul facility. The 2011 report on Eritrea from the UN sanctions committee already outlined suspicions of ongoing servicing of Eritrea’s Sukhoi jets by a MIG Remont team. Neither MIG Remont nor its parent company, state-owned defence holding Ukroboronprom responded tobne questions.\n\nYet bne has been able to confirm the Zaporozhe link for Espace Space. While most past and present company directors listed in the UK documents for Espace Space are nominees (ie. strawmen hiding the real owners), for one month in 2009, perhaps through a filing glitch, a certain Oleg Krasnoselskii of Zaporozhe features as director.\n\nbne has established that Oleg Krasnoselskii is the son of Vitaly Krasnoselskii, the director and owner of the company Zaporozhe Foreign Trade Association (ZFTA). According to its public profile, ZFTA exports military aviation technology, including for MIG Remont, and aims “to boost regional exports to fully load Zaporozhe’s defence industry plants.” In 2005, the US imposed sanctions on ZFTA due to alleged dual-use exports to Iran, accusing Krasnoselskii of “assisting the Iranian missile program.”\n\nVitaly Krasnoselskii in comments to bne called Western-imposed sanctions “a legalised form of trade war”. But he denied any supplies of technology contravening UN sanctions.\n\nUkraine now seems set to be named yet again in a UN report on the sanctions violations. Most spectacularly, in 2009 Somalian pirates seized the Ukrainian-owned merchant vessel Faina – and found it to be stuffed with tanks, weapons and ammunitions bound for South Sudan.\n\nfor Motor Sich Fears\n\nThe Espace Soft website says the company not only supplies aviation maintenance services, but has a sideline in gas turbine power units. This might indicate a link to Zaporozhe helicopter engine and turbine producer Motor Sich – Ukraine’s leading engineering company and also its most traded stock.\n\nKrasnoselskii’s ZFRA previously listed Motor Sich as a partner company. But according to chairman of the Motor Sich advisory board Anatoly Malysh, Motor Sich has nothing to do with ZFRA or Espace Soft, although it admitted it knows of Krasnoselskii’s activities.\n\nAccording to bne sources in the company, Motor Sich might, however, have links to a different murky UK trading company – Hazel (UK) Limited – which also trades with very risky states, especially Syria. Motor Sich does not acknowledge any links to Hazel (UK), which features nominee directors to obscure its beneficiaries.\n\nAccording to documents seen by bne, in 2009 Hazel (UK) held a Ukrainian arms export licence for Syria. A US embassy cable published by the wikileaks website shows US diplomats battling in 2009 to stop Motor Sich overhauling 100 aircraft engines for the Syrian Air Force – with the US threatening “a review of the applicability of sanctions against the Ukrainian entities involved.” According to the leaked cable, the Ukrainian side insisted “there was no basis to oppose the overhaul of aircraft engines.”\n\nIn 2010, Ukraine’s security service then did seize a cargo of dual-use tyres at Zaporozhe airport, being shipped to Syria by Hazel (UK) on Motor Sich planes, according to court records. But as late as April this year, Motor Sich’s director of marketing Vladimir Shirkov in a press interview bemoaned the economic downturn in Syria resulting from the unrest, saying it was causing Syria to cancel orders.\n\nIf a connection to Hazel (UK) is established, the Syrian connection could yet have consequences for Motor Sich, due to the international crackdown on defence supplies to Syria’s brutal regime.\n\nUkraine’s UK corruption link\n\nIt is not just Ukraine that could be embarrassed by the upcoming UN report on Eritrean sanctions, but also the UK.\n\nIn 2009, Ukrainian diplomats provided the UK parliamentary committee on Arms Export Controls a list of UK-registered companies holding Ukrainian arms export licences – to the great surprise of the MPs. The committee concluded: “It is of serious concern that the UK Government was unaware of the existence of a list of UK brokers granted licences by the Ukraine,” and called authorities to “instigate an investigation.”\n\nThe list that so alarmed UK parliamentarians in 2009 included Espace Soft – now accused by the UN of supplying fighter jet servicing and parts to Eritrea’s dictator – as well as Hazel (UK), the supplier of helicopter parts to Syria. The list names other UK brassplates holding Ukrainian licences to supply military kit to Gaddafi’s Libya and nuclear technology to Lithuania, for example.\n\nThree years later and apparently no measures have been taken against any of the companies – despite Espace Soft director Krasnoselskii’s prior record of being sanctioned by the US. According to a wikileaks US embassy cable dating from 2006, US diplomats warned Ukraine that Krasnoselskii’s ZRFA “is not a reputable firm and that just because it has not submitted an export license to your government does not mean it is not exporting items to Iran.” According to the leaked cable, Vitaly Krasnoselskii had met with a front company for Iran’s liquid-fuelled ballistic missile developer in 2005. In 2009, according to the leaked US cables, the US continued to express concerns to Ukraine about Krasnoselskii’s supplying speciality metals to Iran’s ballistic missile program. “It is possible that these activities were taking place without the knowledge of the Ukrainian government,” the cable reads.\n\nHazel (UK)’s apparently unhindered operations in UK, despite its Syrian links, also contrast with the UK’s recent very public measures to stop Russia shipping overhauled helicopters to Syria.\n\nBut the British embassy in Kyiv says that responsibility for such companies lies wholly with Ukraine. “The Ukrainian authorities are clearly aware of these companies, and we would expect the companies to be complying with Ukrainian export licensing laws,” second secretary political Jon Bateson tells bne. “The list… contained a number of brass plate companies, foreign companies that had registered as a UK company, but were not based in the UK, did no trade in the UK and were run by foreign nationals.”\n\nThe UK position seems to ignore a spate of recent publications – such as an “Idiot’s Guide to Money-Laundering” by anti-corruption NGO Global Witness in June – that point to the UK as a leading “secrecy jurisdiction” where foreign wrongdoers set up brassplate companies precisely for the purpose of hiding their tracks – as seems to be the case with Espace Soft and Hazel (UK). Where such “anonymous” companies also hold foreign weapon export licences, almost by definition they are up to no good.\n\nOne further jurisdiction may be implicated: The meat in the UK-Ukraine money-laundering sandwich has traditionally been provided by Latvia’s notorious banking system. Indications are that, in the case of Espace Soft, things may be no different: the company is registered at the same London address as a shell company, Diafall Limited, implicated in 2011 in a major corruption scandal in Ukraine’s state energy sector – where funds were processed by Latvia’s Trast Komercbanka. And Hazel (UK) features on the accounts of a money-laundering carousel company Tormex Limited, held at Latvia’s Baltic International Bank, with the company registered in New Zealand. Tormex Ltd was previously named in a US court case as having laundered money for Mexico’s feared Sinaloa cartel.\n\nGraham Stack in Kyiv for Business New Europe (www.bne.eu)\n\nUkrainian national energy company Naftogaz Ukrainy claims an appraisal provided by oilfield services giant Halliburton justifies the $400m price tag that it paid for an offshore rig in 2011. But a bne investigation finds the Halliburton appraisal, Halliburton_20111117 is less than meets the eye, as the US firm subcontracted rig appraisal work to a one-man band from Alabama.\n\nIn 2011, Ukraine’s national energy company Naftogaz purchased an offshore drilling rig for just under $400m from a UK intermediary company, which previously had acquired the same rig for just $248.5m from Norway’s offshore operator Seadrill. The discrepancy between the prices prompted widespread accusations of corruption on a grand scale, which coming just as Ukraine’s election campaign for parliamentary elections set for October 28 got underway could be a key factor in determining the outcome.\n\nIn a fightback against the allegations, Naftogaz and energy minister officials are now claiming that a valuation of the rig performed by Halliburton confirms the $400m price tag, exonerating them from suspicion.\n\nAccording to the Halliburton letter summarizing the preliminary appraisal results, seen by bne, Halliburton_20111117 the estimated value of the rig, outfitting and engineering work, and transport needed to move it from Singapore to the Black Sea almost exactly matches the sum of $400m paid by Naftogaz at the controversial procurement tender held in March 2011. The winner of the tender was a UK company called Highway Investment Processing, the beneficiaries and representatives of which have never been revealed. The bank account to which the funds were transferred was with Latvian bank Trasta Komercbanka.\n\nNaftogaz management and energy ministry officials are now brandishing the Halliburton appraisal letter as proof that the acquisition of the rig was above board. “The procedure of purchasing the drilling platform, its servicing and technological processes are all subject to an independent audit from Halliburton,” Naftogaz deputy board chairman Vadim Chuprun declared.\n\nUkraine’s energy ministry claimed: “We believe further insinuations about the purchase of the drilling rigs are an instrument of competition for the development of the Black Sea shelf aimed at reducing Ukraine’s energy security.”\n\nSweet home Alabama\n\nThe Halliburton letter subsequently produced by Naftogaz is written in poor English and contains orthographical and factual errors, but Halliburton confirmed to bne it was authentic.\n\nThe letter may not, however, fulfill the expectations placed on it by Naftogaz. It states that Halliburton in fact subcontracted rig appraisal work to a company called Marine Surveyors Incorporated, which deployed a team led by a certain Captain Michael Barrie. According to bne enquiries, the Halliburton letter is misleading in that there is no such company as Marine Surveyors Incorporated – the company Halliburton hired is Captain Michael Barrie’s own set-up: M. H. Barrie & Associates Marine Surveyors, Inc. And according to Barrie, he travelled alone to a Turkish Black Sea port for the rig appraisal job.\n\nAccording to bne enquiries, Captain Barrie’s marine surveyor company is a small local affair based in the US southern port town of Mobile, Alabama, operating since 1994, with Barrie taking on some partners in 1998. Barrie operates from a four-room suite in a dockside office block, with total staff numbering under 10. According to his website, Captain Barrie offers “marine and terminal expertise” with “local knowledge of port operations.” A marine surveyors’ role is to assess vessel and cargo condition mostly for insurance purposes and damage claims.\n\nBarrie’s website does not mention any expertise in offshore energy. Barrie told bne that over the last two years he had indeed taken on some work with jack-up rigs and said that his website is seven years old and needs updating. Barrie acknowledged that his is a “small company” and that this was the first job he had done for Halliburton. Barrie said that Halliburton had refused him permission to comment to bne on any aspects of the appraisal, but indicated he was unacquainted with the appraisal letter’s contents.\n\nHalliburton is the world’s second largest oilfield services company, with a market capitalization of $30bn and workforce of over 60,000, headed in the 1990s by the later US vice president Dick Cheney. The Halliburton press service intended to get back to bne with answers on the appraisal of the “West Juno” rig (now renamed “Petro Godovanets”), but failed to do so within a two week deadline.\n\nWhile the reasons for Barrie’s hiring by Halliburton are unclear, the import of the appraisal letter so feted by Ukrainian officials is equally unclear: the bulk of the difference between the $248.5m sale price to Norway’s Seadrill paid by the UK intermediary, and the $400m purchase price paid by Naftogaz to the UK intermediary, is explained in two lines, both of which refer to data supplied by Naftogaz itself. Thus, according to the letter, “based on the activities information provided by Naftogaz (sic) upgrades to the West Juno rig is (sic) estimated at $57,940,000.”\n\nSecondly, “based on the work volume before rig dry tow requested by Naftogaz, auxiliary costs for engineering work such as cut and reinstall the legs, personnel and engineering is (sic) estimated at $71,380,000.” This item refers to work done on the rig necessary to move it through the Bosporus into the Black Sea. Notably, the Halliburton letter dated November 2011 was actually written before the engineering work was implemented in the winter 2011-2012, with Barrie visiting in April 2012.\n\nNaftogaz did not respond to bne queries about the extent to which the Halliburton appraisal was based on data supplied by Naftogaz itself.\n\nInterestingly, the original contract signed in March 2011 between Naftogaz and UK intermediary Highway Investment, as seen by bne, specified Singapore as place of delivery, not the Black Sea. Thus the price items connected to transit via the Bosporus – $71,280,000 – and also shipping costs of $15m were not included in the original deal between Naftogaz and Highway Investment of March 2011. The place of delivery was shifted from Singapore to the Turkish Black Sea port of Giresun in amendments to the contract made in September 2011, seen by bne. The changes apparently at a stroke of the pen brought over $86m extra expense for Highway Investment, but without any change in the price paid by Naftogaz.\n\nSeptember 2011 was also the month Halliburton signed a framework agreement with Naftogaz on construction, operating and maintaining of oil and gas wells, including an option for servicing the West Juno/Petro Godovanets rig. This agreement sealed what had been a meteoric rise for Halliburton in Ukraine in 2011, with prior agreements in the course of the year signed on confidentiality and cooperation, and Halliburton opening a swanky new office in the prestigious heart of Kyiv. The November 2011 Halliburton appraisal letter thus finishes on a high note: “Halliburton appreciates this opportunity to submit this preliminary report and looks forward to being Naftogaz business partner in developing oil and gas assets in Ukraine.”\n\nAnalysts surmise that Halliburton has now supplanted Schlumberger as Naftogaz’s service partner of choice: as early as 2006, Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company and Halliburton’s traditional rival, signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Naftogaz, and as late as December 2010 Schlumberger won a Naftogaz tender for work on the Subbotinskoe offshore field. Schlumberger told bne, “we cannot confirm their [the previous agreements'] continuing validity.”\n\nRewriting history\n\nHistory is being rewritten not only in Ukraine with respect to the 2011 Naftogaz rig deals. The revenues from the sale of the West Juno rig to Naftogaz went through Highway Investment’s account at Latvia’s Trasta Komercbanka – a bank that appears to have links to Naftogaz Ukraine. Not the least of such links would be the fact that largest shareholder and chairman of the bank’s council, Igor Buimisters, listed on his website biography that he is consultant to the supervisory boards of “Neftgas Ukraine” and also of a Naftogaz joint venture with Poland’s PGNiG called Devon. Neftgas Ukraine is a russified version of Naftogaz Ukrainy.\n\nBut Trasta has now removed the reference to the Ukrainian companies from Buimisters’ bio. Following the deletion, the bank demanded that bne retract its previous statements linking Buimisters to Naftogaz.\n\nThe bank also now claims in hindsight that the reference to “Neftgas Ukraine” never in fact referred to Naftogaz Ukrainy, but to an unspecified privately held company. The bank does not dispute Buimisters’ involvement with the Naftogaz joint venture ‘Devon’. Despite bne requests, the bank has not supplied the address or registration details of the “real” Neftgas Ukraine. Nor does the Interfax Spark database contain details of any such company. But the website bio has generously retained reference to Buimisters’ “doctorate” from Kennedy Western University – an unaccredited US distance-learning college that closed in 2009 after being named in a US government investigation into “diploma mills.”\n\nThe bank’s apparent nervousness comes at a time when Latvian law enforcement agencies are finally making moves to investigate the 2011 Naftogaz tenders and the subsequent passage of money through Latvia. bne has obtained confirmation from the economic crime department of the Latvian state police that an investigation is ongoing, following transfer of materials earlier this year from the state prosecutor’s anti-money laundering office.\n\nSad end to tenders\n\nWhile there appears no end in sight to the controversy over the 2011 Naftogaz Black Sea tenders, in Ukraine an end has been made to the law on compulsory tenders for state companies, which has provided so much help to journalists and so much hindrance to bureaucrats. Without the law, the 2011 Naftogaz spending spree – which totalled roughly $1bn for two jack-up rigs and support vessels – would never have come to public attention.\n\nPresident Viktor Yanukovych, under whose watch the Naftogaz tenders took place in 2011, signed into law August 1 amendments to the procedure for state procurement, freeing state-owned companies such as Naftogaz from holding such mandatory procurement tenders – and thus effectively eliminating any form of public control over vast swathes of the state sector. The government argues that compulsory tenders slow the procurement process and impede state companies’ international competitiveness.\n\nAccording to Oleksiy Shalaisky, founder of the Nashi Groshi website that monitors state tenders for signs of corruption – and who first flagged up the Naftogaz Black Sea tenders in 2011 – this will decimate the number of state tenders held. “State-owned companies account for around UAH300bn ($37bn) of a total UAH500bn ($62bn) state procurement orders,” Shalaisky tells bne. “These will now be excluded from having to hold tenders, and we calculate that the level of minimum kickback will rise to 10%, meaning at least an extra UAH30bn ($3.7bn) will be stolen.”\n\nAccording to Shalaisky, the Nashi Groshi website in little over a year’s work achieved the cancellation of 25 tenders, resulting in over $700m being be returned to the exchequer. “All of these tenders were cancelled exclusively due to pressure from the media. There were no legal faults found in the tender procedure, but following media pressure, the tender winners themselves stepped back from the deals.”\n\nThe media pressure was heightened by independent critical TV station TVi, which runs a feature “Tender News” focusing on corruption suspicions, including the Naftogaz Black Sea tenders. In mid-July, authorities seemed to fire a warning shot across the bows of TVi, launching a criminal case against its CEO on tax evasion charges. The charges were officially declared dropped on August 2 – a day after the changes to the tender laws.\n\nFollowing the elimination of mandatory tenders, Shalaisky now expects a further surge in corruption: “The most corrupt deals were put on hold pending the recent amendments to the law.”\n\nGraham Stack in Berlin for Business New Europe (www.bne.eu)\n\nAugust 30, 2012\n\nA verdict in a lawsuit in San Antonio, West Texas, has put yet another question mark over a controversial $560m Ukraine-Iraq arms deal, hailed at the time of its signing in 2009 as one that would resurrect Ukraine’s ailing defence industry.\n\nThe details are only emerging now, but bne can reveal that a San Antonio jury awarded Texan businessman Howard Lowry in June a whopping $61.75m damages against the Ukraine-US brokers who set up the 2009 deal for cutting him out of it. The court case seems likely to retrigger behind-the-scenes conflicts between Iraqi and Ukraine officials, old and new, over who will earn commissions on the contract.\n\nThe San Antonio lawsuit was brought by Howard Lowry, a US businessman who worked in Iraq following the US occupation in 2003 as a middleman for US companies looking to land orders from Iraqi authorities. Lowry sued and won against Oleg Jankovic, owner of Washington DC-based company Jankovic & Associates, an established lobbyist and intermediary for Ukrainian interests in Washington D.C. Jankovic, who is regarded as close to Democrat senator for Virginia Jim Webb, played a key role in facilitating the 2009 deal between Ukrainian defence exporters and Iraqi officials, and received commission payments for doing so.\n\nBut according to the lawsuit, it was Baghdad-based Lowry who actually set up the initial meetings between Ukrainian representatives, Jankovic and Iraqi officials. Lowry holds a written contract with Jankovic entitling him to 50% of commissions earned by Jankovic on ensuing contracts. But when the full scale of the pending deal became clear in 2009, Jankovic, with the backing of his Ukrainian client, the state-owned arms export company Progres, cut Lowry out of it.\n\nAs a result, the San Antonio court has now made Lowry a breathtaking award of $61.5m damages against Jankovic. The colossal sum is unlikely to be paid in full, as apparently only $112m of the deal’s total price has been transferred by Iraq to date. But Lowry is gunning for as much as he can get in the future “My client has a written contract that entitles him to a share of commissions on payments deriving from the deal, and a clause that stipulates Stockholm as place of international arbitrage,” David Prichard, Lowry’s attorney, tells bne.\n\nWith the apparent resumption of payments on the contract in 2012, the scene is now set for protracted court battles.\n\nThe whistleblower\n\nWhen Kyiv and Baghdad announced in October 2009 that Iraq would purchase 420 BTR-4 armoured vehicles and 6 An-32b transport planes from Ukraine, worth a total of $560m, it seemed Ukraine’s defence sector was finally recapturing its Soviet-era glory days. There was even speculation the deal would be only the first in a total potential partnership worth $2.5bn to Ukraine, as Iraq sought to rebuild its defence capacity.\n\nBut the deal was not enough to rescue the administration of Viktor Yushchenko from ignominy at the polls in early 2010, with Yushchenko taking a miserly 5% in the presidential elections. As soon as the new administration under President Viktor Yanukovych came to power, there was a wholesale replacing of defence sector management and the Iraq deal hit the rocks. Following initial delivery of 26 vehicles after delays in 2011, Iraq officials refused to accept the second batch of 62 vehicles due to technical defects revealed on reinspection in Ukraine 2011-12, according to media reports. Ukraine officials regularly announced imminent shipping of the armoured vehicles, but it never happened.\n\nAccording to former defence officials from the previous administration, fighting a rearguard action via media, the real reason for Iraqi officials’ refusal to accept the second batch of armoured vehicles was that Ukraine’s new leadership were refusing to pay out “commissions” to Iraqi officials under a scheme agreed in 2009.\n\nBut in June it seemed there had been a breakthrough, with Iraqi officials inspecting and accepting the second batch of 62 BTR-4s in Kharkiv, although bne could not get confirmation from Ukrspetseksport as to whether it had shipped. This indicated some compromise had been reached regarding the commissions between Iraqi officials and the old and new Ukraine officials. Total commissions to both sides are put at around 20%, which is potentially worth around $100m over the course of the entire contract.\n\nBut just as the going got smoother, Howard Lowry has now upset the apple cart with his courtroom victory.\n\nLowry had already made a name for himself as whistleblower in 2011 when he passed to the US media salacious details of notorious US private security contractor Blackwater’s appetite for AK-47s, cocaine, steroids and random violence in Iraq. Now he has turned on Ukraine’s defence sector and lobbyists.\n\nAccording to Lowry’s successful lawsuit, he personally organised the initial contacts with Iraqi officials in Baghdad for the Ukrainian intermediaries, Jankovic in Washington DC and his colleague, Mykola “Nick” Karanko from Kyiv. Lowry signed an agreement with Jankovic in 2008 assigning him a 50% share in commissions for any help in closing a deal. But after the initial contact to the Iraqis, Jankovic cut him out of the deal entirely, according to the court.\n\nBackhanders on all sides\n\nThe details of the court case confirm reports that Iraqi officials had a strong personal interest in the deal going ahead in its original form, as negotiated under the Yushchenko administration. According to court documents seen by bne, Ukrainian arms exporter Progres in 2009 arranged to pay commissions via Mykola Karanko totalling around 8% of the contract sum, to Iraqi citizens Mohammaed Jasem Midnf Al Kaabi, Ahmad Mohammed Al Saady and Haider M. Salih Shnawa Al-Musaied, and to Iraqi companies Al Khairat Al Arabia Co. and Wahi Al Abdaa Co. The payments were for the benefit of members of Iraq’s presidential defence procurement commission, according to the court case. A leaked diplomatic cable from the US embassy in Bagdad expressed “concern about corruption” regarding the Ukraine deal, reminding that nearly 50% of Iraq’s defence expenditure was funded directly by the US.\n\nThe US court case, at which Progres’ former deputy head Volodymyr Vladimirov testified, also tellingly revealed that Jankovic and Karanko organised commission payments from Progres in the opposite direction: to Ukrainian “lobbyists”. The court documents record that Progres agreed to pay commissions to Karanko’s Delaware company, Universal Investment Group (UIG). Almost all of the commission payment to UIG made by Progres on the initial down-payment by Iraq was immediately forwarded by UIG to three Ukrainian-owned shell companies, ostensibly for their subcontracted activity as “lobbyists,” under an agreement dated August 20, 2009. The court transcript records Lowry’s attorney Prichard calling the shell companies “fronts for these Ukrainian officials to get bribes.” The defendants obtained a court order preventing disclosure of the identities of the Ukrainian owners of these companies, claiming the information was highly sensitive, according to court records.\n\nA bne source who prefers to remain anonymous, interviewed in Berlin, confirmed the payments to the Ukrainians. According to the source, UIG received a roughly $12m commission payment on the Iraqi down-payment of $112m, and paid just under $10m of this in three roughly equal portions to the Ukraine-owned offshore “lobbyists” – Singapore company UST-Tech Consulting, British Virgin Isles company Hectorian Services and UK company Lanefield Exports. Lanefield Exports at the time was formally owned by Belize companies Milltown Corporate Services and Ireland & Overseas Acquisitions, which media investigations have established are controlled by Latvian money-laundering banks, and are associated with numerous Ukraine corruption cases, including the shipment to South Sudan of armoured vehicles in 2009 on the MS Faina that was hijacked by Somali pirates.\n\nAccording to bne sources, Karanko, the owner of UIG, is an associate of the former head of arms export company Progres, Taras Shiiko. Karanko, one of Shiiko’s 41 Facebook friends, got his start in business running a translation business in Kyiv, reportedly taking on defence sector orders.\n\nAccording to bne enquiries, Shiiko himself was seen as a placeman of Serhiy Bondarchuk, head of Progres parent company Ukrspetseksport throughout the presidency of Viktor Yushchenko 2005-10. Yushchenko made Bondarchuk a “Hero of Ukraine”, the highest state decoration, in the dying days of his presidency. Karanko did not respond to email requests to comment on the court verdict. Jankovic & Associates refused to discuss the case with bne over the phone.\n\nLowry himself says he is now unemployed in San Antonio, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after his return from Iraq, and regards his mega-win as fair compensation. “Since becoming involved with the group, I have received more than 30 death threats,” he tells bne.\n\n“My other job involved going into some of the most dangerous areas in Baghdad in order to obtain intelligence that the military could not,” he also writes in his Linkedin profile. “As such, the ‘proving’ initiations were beyond anything I could imagine that one human being would do to another… Unfortunately, as a private civilian, I have been dumped from my health insurance carrier, and can’t find a shrink that has seen nothing greater than a car wreck.”\n\nWho is Mr Salamatin?\n\nMeanwhile back in Ukraine, the derailed arms deal is overshadowing ongoing root-and-branch centralisation of Ukraine’s previously sprawling and shambolic arms export system. But centralisation is unlikely to bring more transparency, argue critics.\n\nJust as Ukraine’s state finances are being centralised round the shadowy figure of 34-year-old national bank head Serhiy Arbuzov – who rose from regional obscurity to the top financial post in a matter of months, and acknowledges a court has exempted him from holding a personal tax ID “on religious grounds” – Ukraine’s defence sector is centralised around the equally shadowy figure of Defence Minister Dmitro Salamatin. Salamatin, whose career started in the mines of Kazakhstan, and who is rumoured to be the son-in-law of 1990s Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, only took Ukraine citizenship in 2005, at the age of 40, in order to enter the country’s parliament in 2006. And only in April 2010 did he make headlines in politics – in an offence rather than defence role – leading a charge with chairs and fists that injured opposition MPs during a major parliamentary bust-up.\n\nDays after proving his martial prowess in hands-on fashion, Salamatin was made head of the parent arms export agency Ukrspetseksport. Salamatin immediately moved to centralise the organisation, with Ukrspetseksport assuming direct responsibility for implementing all contracts handled by its subsidiaries such as Progres, including the Iraq contract. Salamatin then successfully lobbied the establishment of a state defence sector holding Ukroboronprom, which now controls all 118 defence production plants as well as all export structures. Salamatin promptly moved to head the new monster holding in 2011, until in February 2012 he was made Ukraine’s defence minister – only seven years after swapping Russian for Ukrainian citizenship.\n\nCritics have accused him of acting in Russian interests in “sabotaging” the Iraq contract, but there is no indication that Russia has swooped to steal the deal. But Salamatin’s strategy for the sector indeed mirrors that launched by Russia’s Vladimir Putin in 2004, in centralising both sales and production structures in holdings directly subordinated to the executive.\n\nIn contrast to Russia, however, Ukraine’s defence producers are far more reliant on foreign sales, since cash-strapped Ukraine’s expenditure on arms procurement is close to zero. But that could change: The turmoil breaking out across Ukraine’s key export markets in the Middle East in 2011 and continuing in 2012, along with the threats to the Iraq contract, have undermined hopes for a rapid boost to arms exports. With Salamatin’s move to the defence ministry in February putting him direct charge of procurement, and plans announced that defence production should double through 2017, Ukraine may now be set for a Putin-style hike in defence spending.\n\nGraham Stack in Kyiv for Business New Europe (www.bne.eu)\n\nOctober 6, 2012\n\nThe arrest of opposition parliamentary candidate and financier Ruslan Demchak on money-laundering charges looks at first glance to be another example of mounting political repression ahead of Ukraine’s parliamentary election. But Demchak may have fallen victim to a government tax crackdown rather than electoral politics and, according to bne enquiries, his bad luck may be another man’s poetic justice.\n\nUkraine’s State Tax Service announced September 3 that they had arrested the 38-year-old financier Demchak, owner of mid-sized Ukrainian Business Group, RD Bank and insurance and healthcare assets, in a rare move to prosecute a well-connected businessman for financial offences. Given such an arrest is so extraordinary, pundits have been quick to claim that the real reason for Demchak’s arrest is his work for the political opposition: Demchak was running for parliament in a first-past-the-post constituency against prominent Party of Regions parliamentarian Hrihory Kaletnik, head of the Rada’s agriculture committee. And Kaletnik’s son Ihor is head of the even more influential State Customs Service, making the Kaletnik family one of Ukraine’s most powerful political dynasties.\n\nThis is also Demchak’s version of events. “From the minute of my registration as a parliamentary candidate pressure was brought on me from competitors,” Demchak said in a statement following his arrest. “First of all, they registered a clone candidate Andrei Demchak to deceive voters and take votes off me. A few days later, a smear campaign was launched against me in the media. They started to harass my wife and children with the aim of forcing me to retire from the electoral race. Because I refused to do so, I was arrested during one of my meetings with voters.”\n\nThen on September 7 a Kyiv court ordered Demchak’s custody to be extended for two months. “Everything is being done to prevent me from continuing the election campaign,” Demchak responded. The tax service denied any political component.\n\nFollowing the jailing of key opposition leaders Yulia Tymoshenko and Yury Lutsenko in the last year on what are widely regarded as politically motivated charges, arrests of lower level political opponents would be a sure sign that Ukraine was slipping towards Belarus standards of authoritarianism. “Demchak’s arrest was definitely a result of his parliamentary candidacy, since it was only after announcing his candidacy that he was arrested,” argues Vladimir Fesenko, head of the Penta Center for Applied Political Research.\n\nIt is regarded as Ukraine’s major achievement that it has held successive free and fair elections, following the Orange Revolution that overturned rigged presidential elections in 2004, but fears are growing that the parliamentary election on October 28 could see an end to this.\n\nMud-slinging or money-laundering?\n\nDemchak’s downfall has just accelerated. According to a Demchak aide, as quoted by Ukrainksaya Pravda, as a condition for his release from detention by November 3, Demchak has now agreed to withdraw his candidacy and to sell his bank, RD Bank.\n\nBut while the timing of Demchak’s arrest seems prompted by his candidacy, this does not mean the charges he faces are trumped up. An official complaint against Demchak was filed by two MPs to the General Prosecutor’s Office on August 18, apparently providing the basis for his arrest. According to the complaint, Demchak was “rendering services in converting non-cash funds into cash funds via participants on the securities market” – ie. running what is known across the former Soviet Union as a “conversion centre”.\n\nA conversion centre is an informal financial facility converting companies’ booked funds into off-the-books cash, on an industrial scale and for an approximately 10% commission. The cash then goes to fuel Ukraine’s shadow economy, estimated at around 50% of total GDP, in particular by paying salaries “in envelopes” and thus avoiding payroll taxes. Ukraine’s security service puts the total volume of such “converted” funds at around $7.5bn per year, according to a report leaked in 2011. Two staple tools of conversion centres are fictive securities transactions and fictive import-export operations.\n\nDemchak’s structures have rejected any financial wrongdoing on their part. “RD Bank (member of Ukrainian Business Group) has never and does not engage in laundering funds and any other illegal operations and activity,” the bank said in a statement.\n\nBut bne has obtained independent confirmation that Demchak ran conversion centres, from a source in the central Ukrainian town of Zhitomir. The source, 53-year-old Anatoly Rupeta, accuses Demchak of being a leading operator of conversion centres in Ukraine over a number of years.\n\nBlast from the past\n\nRupeta tells bne he is fighting trumped-up criminal charges of large-scale fraud brought against him by Demchak’s structures, after he inadvertently stumbled across the operation of a massive conversion centre.\n\nAccording to Rupeta, his troubles started in 2007 when the previous owner of the small Zhitomir firm he was running, the head of a local bank’s foreign currency department, died in a car crash. It quickly transpired, according to Rupeta, that the deceased bank executive had been involved in one of Demchak’s conversion operations, via the bank where he worked. And unknown to Rupeta, the firm he had taken over from the bank executive in good faith was at the heart of the scheme, which involved foreign currency accounts at the bank Rupeta says he knew nothing of. “Only days after the car accident – in December 2007 – Ruslan Demchak came to me and explained the whole scheme, drawing a diagram to show me exactly where I stood,” says Rupeta, who retains Demchak’s sketch to this day.\n\nAccording to Rupeta, the scheme that Demchak described had processed $56.9m in 2006-07. “Demchak told me that if I and the widow of the bank executive did not return $2m in money – which I obviously did not have – he would arrange for criminal charges to be brought,” he says, explaining that Demchak needed to bring criminal charges against him to build a case for freezing the widow’s assets.\n\nRupeta tells bne that Demchak’s conversion scheme worked via a $2m foreign currency credit line held by the deceased bank executive, which was secured by guarantees provided by local companies. Offshore firms would transfer dollar funds from Latvian and Lithuanian bank accounts as advance payments on non-existing foreign trade contracts with the Ukrainian companies. The local companies then transferred these funds to pay down the executive’s credit line. The executive then received cash payouts on the credit line, which were then distributed via Demchak’s structures to the scheme’s customers across Ukraine. “And there were a number of people at the bank with similar credit lines,” says Rupeta.\n\nAccording to Rupeta, Demchak made good on this threat to have criminal charges brought when one of the top managers in Demchak’s Ukrainian Business Group (UBG) filed a complaint to police against Rupeta. Demchak’s manager held power of attorney for a UK company, Corpmark Impex LLP, that had transferred funds to Rupeta’s company Magnolia. Corpmark Impex LLP, as well as Panamanian and New Zealand firms, also transferring funds to Rupeta’s company, all featured the now notorious Latvian nominee directors such as Erik Vanagels, Stan Gorin, and Voldemar Spatz, whose names feature in thousands of companies and numerous Ukrainian economic crime cases, including Highway Investment, a company that bne investigations has shown to be involved in the suspicious sale of an over-priced rig to the state oil and gas firm Naftogaz Ukrainy. “The UBG manager even claimed in court he is a personal acquaintance of Spatz,” says Rupeta.\n\nAccording to court documents, prosecutors allege that Corpmark paid Rupeta’s firm Magnolia $6m for a delivery of granite that never happened, with the $6m made as a 100% advance payment, despite the fact Rupeta had signed no contract. “When I point out that I am unknown among local granite producers, the prosecutors say this only proves that fraud was intended from the start,” he says.\n\nValery Fedichin, partner at leading Kyiv law firm OMP, casts doubt on the prosecution case. “It is very unlikely that a legitimate UK company would transfer $6m to a Ukrainian company without a written contract, and especially the whole contract amount in advance,” he says. “Besides, a Ukrainian resident cannot do a foreign trade transaction without any paper work due to Ukrainian foreign exchange controls. So the resident itself would normally be concerned to sign a formal contract.”\n\nFacing the worst\n\nRupeta counts himself lucky not to have been shut up in pre-trial detention for the four years that the criminal proceedings have lasted. But the worst is still ahead – Rupeta is facing a jail sentence of 10-14 years, with a court decision and sentencing expected within the coming year. Ukrainian courts convict 95% of all accused.\n\nFor Rupeta, Demchak’s arrest on money-laundering charges ironically represents a last chance to avoid jail. “The UK company Corpmark Impex itself is long since dissolved,” says Rupeta, “but the Ukrainian courts will continue to grind until told to stop. Even if Demchak has only been arrested for political reasons, because he got in someone’s way, there is poetic justice in this, considering how he set me up.”\n\nDemchak via his press secretary denied any connection to the alleged activities and conversion centres.\n\nKommersant Ukraine reported October 5 that Demchak’s bank RD Bank is now up for sale. The most interested party is a leading Ukrainian political dynasty, though not the Kaletniks this time, but the Klyuev brothers Andrih and Serhiy, secretary of the National Security Council and a member of the National Bank supervisory council respectively, with combined wealth put at $300m by Forbes. According to i>Kommersant Ukraine , Demchak’s bank may be small, but it is attractive to the Klyuevs and others as a national leader in cash handling and cash distribution services.\n\nGraham Stack in Berlin for Business New Europe\n\nOctober 23, 2012\n\nMoldova’s first deputy speaker, Vladimir Plahotniuc, reputedly the country’s richest man and a political kingmaker, could face criminal prosecution in UK on contempt of court charges, according to lawyer Patrick Boylan of Simmons & Simmons, “if a London court finds he is behind the transfer of shares frozen under court order.”\n\nAccording to Boylan, shares in UK company Tomdal Ltd. are believed to have been transferred to a Russian company, despite a London court having ordered an assets freeze during litigation. Plahotniuc features as the economic owner of the company, according to documents obtained by a court discovery order and seen by bne.\n\nTomdal is only one of several UK companies to which share packets in Moldovan banks and insurance companies were ultimately transferred without knowledge of their owners following apparently crooked court decisions in 2010-2011. Plahotniuc was revealed to be the beneficiary owner of all the UK companies, following the discovery order in England and Scotland. Lawyer Boylan is representing Moldovan businessmen Victor and Viorel Topa, who claim that the UK companies now own share packets rightly belonging to them and expropriated in 2010 and 2011 by Plahotniuc.\n\nAccording to Boylan, Plahotniuc has already attempted to claim diplomatic immunity as deputy speaker of parliament in the framework of a Cyprus court case also relating to breach of a court-imposed asset freeze. “The claim was laughable, and the Cypriot court ruled that under international law he would not enjoy sovereign immunity,” Boylan said, who warned that, “English courts take contempt of court very seriously.”\n\nIn February 2012, a London high court judge handed down a 22-month prison sentence to the former owner of Kazakhstan’s BTA bank, Mukhtar Ablyazov, on contempt of court charges relating to breach of an asset freeze.\n\nPlahotniuc has vigorously denied all the Topas’ allegations about his role in the Moldovan “raider attacks”. According to his press secretary Diana Danu, “the topic of the raider attacks was made a subject of a political campaign in Moldova, a smear campaign originating in Moldova, and coordinated by a criminal group led by Mssrs Topa, two business people that have been convicted by a court of law.” Danu says that any documents compromising Plahotniuc were forgeries.\n\nBank robbery\n\nThe waves of dodgy asset transfers labelled “raider attacks” in Moldova started in 2010 and peaked in 2011. “We had held a stake in Victoriabank since 2005 via companies,” Victor Topa tells bne, “but when we attended the shareholders’ meeting in July 2010, we suddenly found out that we no longer owned the shares.”\n\nThe Topas then discovered a whole series of court decisions had been secretly set in motion in the preceding months that had transferred most of their stake to non-resident companies. And hardly they got their breath back than further court decisions in 2011 disappeared the remainder of their shares in Victoriabank, an 18% stake in Moldovan savings bank Banca de Economii, and a controlling stake in Moldova’s second largest insurance company Asito. In all cases, the stakes were shifted to shell companies across the globe; ultimately they were parked with UK companies.\n\nThe Moldovan court decisions all involved alleged million-dollar debts owed by the Topas’ ownership vehicles to previously unknown offshores, which it was claimed were collateralised by the bank shares. They also involved the same court and group of judges, and crudely tampered paperwork including judgments entered post hoc on the bottom lines of the court ledgers for those dates. “On the one hand it was sophisticated, on the other hand it was unbelievably brutal and transparent, and easy to convince an English judge that these court decisions had been fraudulently obtained,” lawyer Boylan says.\n\nBizarrely, for all the shenanigans in Moldova, court discovery orders obtained in England and Scotland as well as Cyprus then revealed that Plahotniuc was down in black and white as economic owner of all the companies that now control the disputed share packets – without any smokescreen use of strawmen or relatives. Since Plahotniuc’s outing as owner of the stakes, moves have apparently been made by at least one of the UK companies, Tomdal Ltd., to sell on the stakes despite the assets freeze. The moves could yet spell trouble for Plahotniuc if he is judged to be their initiator.\n\nAll change\n\nThe Topas are not the only ones hurting. Altogether the “raider waves” and linked transactions saw large stakes in Moldova’s three largest banks, a controlling stake in a smaller bank, and controlling stakes in the two largest insurance companies mysteriously change hands 2010-2012, with no clarity over the new owners. The country’s reformist prime minister, Vlad Filat, called the raiding spree “an attack not only on our banking system, but on our country itself.”\n\nBogdan Tirdea, Moldova’s leading oligarch watcher, says the amounts could be as much as $100m. “There has never been anything like this in Moldovan history.”\n\nFor all of Filat’s outrage, only in one case has the outcome of a raid been reversed: in August 2011, a Moldovan court transferred a blocking stake of just under 27% in Moldova’s largest bank Agroindbank from ownership by a pool of Slovenian financial investors to two Seychelles companies, on the basis of a forged ruling from a Russian court. Agroindbank took a €20m loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2009, with further funding under consideration. The panic among the European diplomatic community in Chisinau was great, and pressure piled on behind-the-scenes. A quick Supreme Court decision in September 2011 resulted in the Agroindbank stake being returned to the Slovenian owners. The EBRD refused to comment on the situation in Moldova despite holding a blocking stake in Victoriabank and being the main creditor to Agroindbank.\n\nDomestic investors have been less lucky than the quick response the EBRD got. Russian banker German Gorbuntsov was worst hit – literally. His 80% stake in small Moldovan bank Universalbank was also transferred by Moldovan court order to a Seychelles company in August 2011. The bank had its license withdrawn in February 2012. Gorbuntsov, who has been accused of money-laundering in Russia, was then shot and badly wounded in London in April this year. Gorbuntsov has said he believes Russian interests were behind the shooting.\n\nThe change of owners in Moldovan companies is still going on, although with less brutal methods. In July, five recently registered Moldovan companies bought 80% of the country’s largest insurance company on the open market from Russia’s Rosgosstrakh, for around $16m. According to information obtained by the Topas, for which there is no independent confirmation, two of these companies raised funds for the acquisitions using as collateral the bank shares parked with the UK shell companies.\n\nAnother Moldovan company that apparently raised funds by collateralizing the disputed stakes, GSER Grup, appears involved in Payza, a global e-payment company that is a successor to Alertpay. Payza CEO Alastair Graham declined to comment on Moldova plans.\n\nAnd following the transfer of the Topas’ 18% stake in state-controlled savings bank Banca de Economii – slated for full privatisation by the government – war broke out between the new unidentified minorities and the state’s interest in the bank, leading to two competing boards elected in April 2011, and an interim solution only reached in August, with the unknown minorities getting two representatives on the board – but still no clarity about their identity.\n\nDemocracy hijacked by oligarchs\n\nMoldova’s democratic breakthrough of 2009, which saw a pro-European coalition replace a conservative Communist regime, stirred hope that Moldova could be a bridgehead for reform in the former Soviet Union. Some progress has been made, but it seems powerful businessmen such as Plahotniuc, behind the scenes during the Communist administration, adroitly jumped ships in 2009 to achieve direct power via democracy. Plahotniuc, who made his money in fuel trading under Communist president Vladimir Voronin, is now first deputy president of Moldova’s Democratic Party, a key member of a ruling Alliance for European Integration coalition that enjoys only a slim parliamentary majority vis-a-vis the Communist opposition. He is regarded as the party’s main financial backer.\n\nThe “bank robberies” pose obvious questions about the rule of law in Moldova, and not about bent judges at commercial courts, but of politicisation or commercialisation of the country’s top legal offices.\n\nTwo weeks after the Topas went public in August 2010 with their accusations against Plahotniuc, Moldova’s Prosecutor General, Valeriu Zubco, after consulting with the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, duly launched criminal proceedings – against the Topas. In October 2011 Victor Topa was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in jail on blackmail charges; Viorel Topa was sentenced in absentia in January 2010 to eight years in jail on fraud charges. Both men, now resident in Germany, say the charges are politically motivated. “The Topas may not have been angels but the timing of the charges makes it clear they were political,” says Tirdea.\n\nPM Filat has acknowledged as much. In an interview on October 16, 2011 in newspaper Timpul, Filat indicated that Zubco was Plahotniuc’s man. “Then there was the vote for the candidate for the post of general prosecutor – Valeriu Zubco. I invited all my colleagues from the Alliance for European Integration to the meeting, looked them in the eyes and asked: ‘Whose man is he?’ I wanted to know what they would tell me, although I already knew then that the post was assigned by quota to the Alliance Moldova Nuestra, but they had given it to the Democratic Party in exchange for getting their man as head of the security service. So the Democratic Party got the post of Prosecutor General.”\n\nFilat in the interview further recalled how during negotiations on the renewed Alliance for European Integration, Plahotniuc made the prime minister wait in the lobby of his hotel Codru while he finished with a girl. “We then discussed the creation of the alliance. They (Democratic Party) tried to make me give them as much as possible, and I hoped that after this they would have satisfied their hunger for state institutions and would be governed by common sense in their work. Unfortunately this has not happened.”\n\n“None of this would have been possible without protection from the very top,” says oligarch-watcher Tirdea. “Plahotniuc controls both the Prosecutor General and the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, and this has been the root of all the evil.”\n\nNovember 12, 2012\n\nGraham Stack in Berlin for Business New Europe (www.bne.eu)\n\nLatvia’s asset recovery vehicle Reverta is gunning for Zhan Khudainatov, the brother of Rosneft deputy CEO Eduard Khudainatov – and possibly for Eduard himself, bne can reveal. According to Reverta, the Khudainatovs have defaulted on loans totaling $78m – and have now resorted to gross fraud to ditch their creditors, lawyers claim.\n\nThe case highlights the conflicts of interest, fraud and corruption at the very top of Rosneft, now the world’s largest listed oil company, and gives an idea of the kind of issues that awaits BP as it becomes a 20% stakeholder in Russia’s new national champion.\n\nReverta, the “bad bank” successor organisation to the nationalized Parex bank, tells bne that a mysterious Swiss company called Krini Holding Limited, linked to Rosneft deputy CEO Eduard Khudainatov and his brother, took out over $100m of loans from Parex through 2008, acquiring a Siberian gas company and building processing facilities. The assets were sold in early 2012 for just over $400m, but most of the loan was never repaid, forcing Reverta to take court action in Russia against the companies and individuals.\n\nThe $400m side-business allegedly sold this year by Rosneft’s deputy CEO Khudainatov – a state executive throughout almost his entire career – encapsulates how the Kremlin’s tightening grip on energy has twinned with officials making vast private profits. This is the elephant in the room that BP will now confront following the deal agreed in October that will see the UK major take a 20% stake in Rosneft following a merger with its Russian joint venture TNK-BP.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nAccording to documents seen by bne, in 2004 Eduard Khudainatov held a general power of attorney for Krini Holding. In 2004, Krini Holding took a loan of $40m from Parex to purchase an energy company Severneft, which held a license issued for a gasfield on the hydrocarbon-rich Yamal Peninsula. Eduard Khudainatov’s brother Zhan than became CEO of Severneft.\n\nKhudainatov at the time was not a private businessman, but CEO of the state-owned Gazprom subsidiary Severneftegazprom, developing the massive Yuzho-Russkoe gasfield also on the Yamal Peninsula. His apparent undisclosed private business interest in the gas branch thus created a glaring conflict of interest.\n\nThere seems little doubt Eduard Khudainatov was the main man at Krini Holding. “We have documents showing a general power of attorney of Eduard Khudainatov for Krini Holding, his personal guarantee for the company and proof that he personally performed a number of transactions on behalf of the company,” says Viktoria Burkovskaya of Moscow law firm Egorov Puginsky Afanasiev & Partners, which is representing the Parex successor company Reverta in Russian courts. “These documents point to Eduard Khudainatov’s close mutual ties with the company.”\n\nRosneft failed to respond to email, fax and telephone enquiries on the matter over the course of a week. Eduard Khudainatov has previously denied any link to Severneft or Severorgsintez, or any linked companies.\n\nIn 2006-08, an affiliate of Severneft, Severorgsintez, took a further $87m in loans from Parex to construct processing facilities on the Yamal Peninsula for gas extracted by Severneft. The loans were guaranteed by Severneft, and Eduard Khudainatov in 2006 provided a personal guarantee for Severneft, according to documents seen by bne.\n\nLoan repayment on the Severorgsintez loan was due to start in 2010, but nothing was paid back. Parex/Reverta started legal moves in Russia to reclaim the debt, one of their 10 largest outstanding loans.\n\nThe Khudainatovs then took very evasive action: in August 2011, Severneft assigned its assets and license to a new subsidiary, Severneft-Urengoy. Severneft and Severorgsintez then simply liquidated themselves, despite the outstanding loan. Adding insult to injury for Reverta, in January Severneft-Urengoy was sold to Russian chemicals giant Eurochem for a whopping $403m, roughly four-times the investments made in license and facilities by the Severneft owners.\n\nSeeing their clients flush with cash while welshing on debts, Reverta took off the kid gloves and filed a complaint of gross fraud against Zhan Khudainatov and other directors of Severneft and Severorgsintez in April 2012 – offenses that carry a minimum five-year sentence in Russia. “The case is at the pre-investigation stage,” says Burkovskaya.\n\nDance of the PEPs\n\nKhudainatov’s rise to riches started when in early 2000 he headed Vladimir Putin’s first presidential electoral campaign in the Yamal-Nenets autonomous district, part of the Tyumen region, where most of Russia’s vast oil and gas reserves are located. And when Putin was elected president in March 2000, he duly named Khudainatov the federal inspector for Yamal-Nenets, tasked with ensuring the Kremlin’s writ ran in the district.\n\nYamal-Nenets soon became the scene of a fierce war waged by the Kremlin under Vladimir Putin and his new Gazprom management to regain control of the huge Yuzhno-Russkoe gasfield, which the previous 1990s Gazprom management had mysteriously divested to private gas trader Itera. In 2002, the company holding the license, Severneftgazprom, was finally returned to the Gazprom fold – and Khudainatov made CEO in 2003. Yuzhno-Russkoe, which went into operation in 2007, is now the main supplier to the Nord Stream pipeline, via which Russia directly supplies gas to Germany under Baltic Sea. Thus Khudainatov’s apparent private acquisition of Severneft in 2004, as alleged by Reverta, seems the flipside to the Kremlin’s tightening grip on the energy sector – and could count as a reward for loyalty.\n\nAnd according to bne enquiries, the counter-party in the Severneft deal was another top state energy official, Semen Vainstok, who was at the time CEO of state oil pipeline monopolist Transneft. Before its sale to Krini Holding, Severneft was owned by oil company Gorizont-Neft and Stroikredit Bank, both closely linked to Vainstok at his old stamping ground of Lukoil-West Siberia, according to company documents seen by bne.\n\nIn 2007, Russia’s accounting chamber investigated Transneft’s finances under Vainstok’s watch. According to the report, as leaked to anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, during Transneft’s construction of the East-Siberia-Pacific oil pipeline some $4bn had been siphoned off by 2007 by structures believed linked to Vainstok, including by Stroikredit Bank.\n\nThe Severneft 2004 deal points to Vainstok’s close commercial ties with the Kremlin’s inner circle buying him immunity. Vainstok left Russia for Israel in 2008, with no criminal charges ever brought. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nIronically, the murky background to the Parex-Severneft loans may also now let the Khudainatovs off the hook – at the expense of Latvian taxpayers who bailed out the bank in 2008. Anti-money laundering legislation demands tight scrutiny of banking arrangements for state executives, known in the jargon as politically exposed persons (PEPs). But Parex before nationalisation in 2008 flaunted the regulations, specialising in dodgy banking services for PEPs. “The bank’s philosophy was that all commercial loans should fund bribery,” former head of international relationships at Parex, John Christmas, tells bne.\n\nThe murkiness means that documentation of the Severneft loans is incomplete. “During change of ownership in 2008, the former shareholders stole certain documents pertaining to key bank deals with Russian customers,” says Reverta. “We suspect some originals of the Severorgsintez collateral agreements have vanished.”\n\nBP’s Sechin question\n\nThe $400m question regarding Eduard Khudainatov is: who pushed his rise to the top, and did they take a cut in the side business?\n\nThe one man who stands out in promoting Khudainatov’s career is Igor Sechin, Putin’s energy tsar, now CEO of Rosneft. In 2008, after the Yuzhno-Russkoe field went online successfully, the then deputy PM Sechin promoted Khudainatov to be deputy head of Rosneft, where Sechin was chairman of the supervisory board. Then in 2009, Sechin made Khudainatov CEO of Rosneft. In March this year, re-elected President Vladimir Putin made Sechin CEO of Rosneft, and Khudainatov – who is reported to refer to Sechin simply as “the boss” – humbly stepped back down to deputy CEO without a murmur of complaint.\n\nSechin for his part in January, when still deputy PM with a remit for energy, obliged state energy executives to disclose their and their families’ assets as part of a belated anti-corruption drive after mass protests in Moscow – but exempted Rosneft from the order. Sechin said Rosneft met with obligations voluntarily but it is not known that Khudainatov disclosed large cash holdings. Rosneft discloses only that Khudainatov holds a stake of 0.0605% in Rosneft, worth $43.5m at current market cap.\n\nAccording to Putin, BP’s recent decision to take a 20% stake in Rosneft and two seats on the board should lead to greater transparency in the company. But the example of Khudainatov’s business interests on the side – a rule rather than exception in Russia – will be a warning to BP of the compliance risks entailed in Russian state business. “Those seats could help us influence corporate governance,” BP’s press service tells bne, but would not comment on what conditionality over hiring they will seek from Rosneft.\n\nGraham Stack in Kyiv\n\nParty of Regions MP Eduard Prutnik sees the need for a Ukrainian Stolypin – both a Kyiv statue to the last reforming prime minister of the Russian empire, as well as a real-life statesman for Ukraine’s troubled present: “erecting a statue to the great prime minister-reformer will create a striking symbol for the need for a course of reforms that will make the people masters of their destiny.”\n\nPerhaps there is one man Prutnik believes has what it takes: Sergei Arbuzov, 36 year old head of the National Bank of Ukraine, and a protege of Prutnik at the turn of the century, when Prutnik was manager of Viktor Yanukovych’s family assets. Arbuzov and associated officials visited Washington DC in October 2012, and positioned themselves, according to their US interlocutors, as a team of “young reformers with a clear if undisclosed plan”, says Sonya Koshkina of Levy Bereg: “like people who have no doubt they will soon be at the very heights of power and don’t have any hesitation to say this. Soon meaning after the October 28 elections.” “I am actively involved in planning and carrying out economic reforms initiated by the president,” Arbuzov acknowledged for his part, in an English-language interview, despite the NBU’s formal independence from the executive.\n\nArbuzov’s pedigree certainly speaks for him: his mother, Valentina, is CEO of the All-Ukrainian Development Bank (VBR), a fast-growing bank owned by the Oleksandr Yanukovych, the younger son of President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nOne ambitious Ukrainian politician has already lost to Arbuzov’s meteoric rise from regional obscurity: Oligarch Valery Khoroshkovsy was fired from his post as head of Ukraine’s security service SBU in January 2012, and moved to the finance ministry. After only six weeks he lost that job to an Arbuzov man, Yury Kolobov and was kicked upstairs to the post of first deputy prime minister, which is prestigious but lacks real levers of power. Humilliatingly for Khoroshkovsky, on November 2, Yulia Nosacheva, a close ally of Arbuzov and Kolobov, took Khoroshkovsky’s place on the supervisory boards of the state-owned banks Oschadbank and Ukreksimbank, distancing him further from state financial flows.\n\nOne other man is afraid for his job: white-haired prime minister Mykola Azarov, whom it is rumoured could be replaced by Arbuzov in the coming weeks. But he will not go without a fight, and is positioning himself with the rising Arbuzov faction against Khoroshkovksy. In comments made internally, but reported by Germany’s most respected daily, Frankfurter Allgemeine, Azarov savaged Khoroshkovsky October 29 for deliberately ruining Ukraine’s relationships with the West by jailing Yulia Tymoshenko, and thus blocking Ukraine’s access to IMF funds.\n\nKhoroshkovsky’s poison pill\n\nBut while Khoroshkovksy may now be bound for a seat on the largely decorative National Security Council, during his last weeks as head of the SBU in November 2011, he left a poison pill for his young rival Arbuzov: an arrest warrant for Arbuzov’s former employer and colleague, Pavlo Borulko, in connection with SBU accusation of large-scale money laundering and even murder.\n\nIn November 2011 the SBU issued an arrest warrant for Pavlo Borulko, prompting the latter to flee Ukraine for Belarus. In April 2012, the SBU then went public with extraordinary charges against Borulko together with MP Oleksandr Shepelev, another well-connected 40-something Donetsk banker, whom they called Borulko’s accomplice: charges of massive fraud 2008-2010, and allegations linking the two to contract slayings that covered their tracks.\n\n“The central investigative directorate of the SBU has uncovered the theft by the owner of the banks Evropeiskii, National Standard and Volodomyrskii, Pavlo Borulko and other individuals, of UAH 620m ($76m) from the Guaranteed Deposit Fund,” read the dry press release. “In 2009-2010, offcials at these banks on the day before their licenses were withdrawn, opened 1339 deposit accounts in the names of fictive individuals. Using the accounts of companies they controlled they transferred non-existent money to the accounts of these fictive individuals.” When the bank was liquidated, the Guaranteed Deposit Fund paid out the fictive deposits.\n\nThe SBU also accused Borulko of conspiring with MP Oleksandr Shepelev to steal repo funds disbursed from the NBU to the value of UAH 315m ($39m) and a further UAH 223m ($27m) in funds from Rodovid Bank, using fictive collateral to obtain the funds.\n\nThat was not all: “In February this year, a witness to the inner circle of Borulko provided the investigation with incriminating testimony against Borulko and an MP, and also mentioned that the the accused had threatened him. In the evening, after questioning, the witness was found dead in his own office. (…) An investigation of premeditated murder has now been opened. On one other witness, who gave investigators important testimony, there was attempted murder using automatic weapons.” In addition, according the SBU, another witness in the investigation fell to his death from a high-rise window.\n\nArbuzov’s Achilles Heel\n\nThe close Borulko connection could still prove be Arbuzov’s Achilles heel in his meteoric rise and his enemies such as Khoroshkovsky will seek to make the most of it: Borulko was the man who gave Arbuzov his big break, after their careers had started together in the late 1990s in the small Donetsk town of Konstantinovka, population 100,000, at the same bank, the local branch of Privatbank. Arbuzov’s mother Valentina, was head of the Donetsk division of Privatbank 1994-2007.\n\nDespite Borulko’s apparently criminal career, It is not clear that Arbuzov ever severed ties with him. Arbuzov refuses to comment on his earlier ties to Borulko.\n\nAccording to the Spark Interfax database, in 2002-2003, Borulko, his patron Prutnik, and their business partner Dmitro Goncharov, together with wives and associates, acquired the tiny Donetsk bank, Donechinna, later renamed as Ukraine Business Bank (Ukrbiznesbank). Borulko himself moved to head Donetsk bank Donechinna in June 2002, the year the bank installed its first autoteller.\n\nBut in November 2002, governor of Donetsk, Viktor Yanukovych, was made prime minister, and took with him to Kyiv his ‘manager’ Prutnik, who became head of the board of the state savings bank Oschadbank. Prutnik in turn took with him to Kyiv his own team, including Borulko who became deputy head of the treasury at the bank, and Yury Kolobov, now finance minister, who became head of the treasury, Borulko’s direct boss. Kolobov and Borulko then took responsibility among other things for disbursal of compensation sums to citizens who had lost their savings in Oschadbank after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Borulko left the bank in 2005, but his continued closeness to the Yanukovych family meant he was made adviser to then prime minister Yanukovych in 2007.\n\nBorulko replaced himself at Bank Donechhinna in 2003 with Sergei Arbuzov, his colleague from Konstaninovka’s Privatbank, who stayed at the bank until 2009. Borulko and Goncharov were listed among the bank’s owners alongside Prutnik until September 2008, when structures formerly run by Prutnik, but already passing under control of Oleskandr Yanukovych, took complete control of the bank.\n\nThus bankers Borulko and Goncharuk were Arbuzov’s employers for six years, while also running a number of other small regional banks. What was Borulko up to in these years? Already in April 2007, Anatoly Brezvin, head of the Ukraine’s tax administration, at an Interfax press conference detailed a massive money-laundering and conversion operation centred on the Donetsk division of Avtokrazbank, closely associated with Borulko, and headed by a close Borulko and Arbuzov associate, Konstantin Krivenko, according to the bank’s public disclosures.\n\nMoney-laundering and murder\n\nBorulko and Arbuzov’s employment in the Konstantinovka branch of Privatbank overlapped with Oleksandr Medvedko, like Borulko a native of the town, heading the prosecutor’s office. By 2002 Medvedko had become Ukraine’s deputy prosecutor general, and from 2007 to 2010 he was the country’s prosecutor general. Konstantinovka is a small place and Medvedko is widely reported to be married to the aunt of Borulko’s wife. In an interview in 2009, Borulko’s business partner Dmitro Goncharov confirmed the two women “were close friends”.\n\nIn 2004 came the Orange Revolution, and the appointment of anti-corruption campaigner Yury Lutsenko to the post of Interior Minister. Lutsenko quickly put together a special unit under police major Roman Erokhin to investigate money-laundering by a network of Donetsk banks. Erokhin was then murdered by hired killers in June 2006. The ensuing investigation linked both Borulko and Shepelev to the killing.\n\nJudgement was pronounced on the killers December 6 2010. http://www.reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/12906450. According to testimony cited in the verdict, Erokhin’s brother, also a top police officer, had been informed by the security service of Arbuzov’s Ukrbiznesbank that Shepelev ran ‘financial groups’ across a number of banks, and was for this reason in conflict with Erokhin. Other testimony said the network was based on Bank Perspektiva, later Unikombank, a bank the SBU has publicly linked to Shepelev.\n\nAccording to the verdict, the group of killers was initially briefed at premises owned by Shepelev, apparently to plan the kidnapping of Dmitro Goncharov – close business parter of Borulko and also co-owner of Ukrbiznesbank – whose contact details were found with the group. The killers claimed they backed out off the Goncharov kidnap attempt due to the fear of armed resistance. “A few days later”, they were approached by an “unknown party” with the proposal to take Erokhin, which they then implemented, kidnapping and then shooting him in leg, head and stomach, and burying the corpse.\n\nConsidering the prosecution’s case was overseen by Borulko’s associate Medvedko, it may be that prosecutors invented the implausible Goncharov kidnapping story to separate Shepelev, Goncharov and Borulko from implication in ordering Erokhin’s murder, after the original Lutsenko-influenced investigation had obtained such evidence. One of the defendants retracted his testimony about Goncharov’s planned kidnapping, saying there had been no such plan and that it had been suggested to him by investigators in return for promised favours that never materialised.\n\nIn June 2012, another notorious contract killing was brought to trial, linked to Shepelev and Borulko: that of Sergei Kirichenko, chairman of Avtokrazbank, disembowelled in a frenzied knife attack January 2003. http://www.reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/25031391. The defendant, a native of Konstantinovka who was directly involved in organising the killing, was found guilty, but given a light sentence of 9 years backdated to 2009. According to the verdict, the killing was ordered by one of the owners of Donkreditinvestbank, likely to have been Shepelev, who has publicly disclosed his ownership of this bank. Analogous to the Erokhin murder case, the prosecution case included a curious preliminary incident in the run-up to the murder: the defendant testified that the same owner of Donkreditinvestbank who ordered Kirichenko’s slaying (Shepelev) had previously paid him for stealing a car from a second co-owner of Donkredinvestbank, indicating the two owners were in conflict with each other. The identity of the second owner whose car was allegedly stolen is unclear, but may have again been Borulko or Borulko’s associate Goncharov, who earlier headed Donkreditinvestbank’s foreign currency department. So the incident may again have constituted an attempt by prosecutors to separate Borulko and Goncharov from implication in the killing.\n\nPrivat doubts\n\nAlthough Oleksandr Medvedko left the prosecutor general’s office in 2010, the Konstantinovka connection is still strong and even growing in top state posts: Yulia Nosacheva, head of the Kyiv tax inspectorate, started her career with Arbuzov and Borulko at Konstantinovka’s Privatbank, and current interior minister, previously head of the tax service, Vitaly Zakharchenko, headed the town’s police at the time.\n\nA further cluster of current top officials worked at other Privatbank branches in the 1990s in Donetsk region, where Arbuzov’s mother Valentina ruled the roost, and also Kharkiv: finance minister Yury Kolobov, his close associate Aleksandr Dubikhvost, head of the NBU’s hard currency reserves department, Roman Maguta, head of Ukraine’s state audit chamber, Viktoria Kononikhina, deputy CEO of state-owned Ukreksimbank, and Konstantin Krivenko, member of the board of Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission, where he heads the Committee on Monitoring, Reporting, Disclosure and Prudential Supervision.\n\nSurprisingly, despite this proliferation of former employees of the Privatbank Donetsk division in top state positions today, Valentina Arbuzova’s then bank enjoyed a far from spotless reputation in the late 1990s when these figures started their career.\n\nAccording to media reports from the time, at a meeting in 1997, the Donetsk regional administration’s committee for combating organised crime, in the presence of top regional and national law enforcement officials, including two deputy heads of the SBU, singled out Valentina Arbuzova for her bank’s money laundering activities, in particular the creation of fictive companies, abuse of loro accounts and hard currency transactions. The regional prosecutor said that criminal cases had been opened against Privatbank officials for implementing money transfers, up to $200,000 dollars per day, on fictive contracts.\n\nIn 1998, in an article published in the government announcer, Golos Ukrainy, Ukraine’s then prosecutor general Mikhail Potrebenko singled out Valentina Arbuzova’s bank as having laundered funds for a major organised crime group, using eleven fictive companies with accounts at Donetsk’s Privatbank division.\n\nThings do not seem to have improved after the turn of the century. The Mariupol branch of Donetsk Privatbank was wracked by scandals 2002-2003, when its head, Tatiana Kudina, was first accused of stealing depositors’ funds, and then of running a huge fraudulent VAT reimbursement scheme.\n\nInternet scam\n\nThe first Internet data communication networks were rolled out through Ukraine in the 1990s by a German joint venture with national telecom fixed line monopolist Ukrtelekom. The joint venture, Infokom, installed the ‘Ukrpak’ network initially for corporate clients, especially banks.\n\nUniquely in Donetsk region, however, Infokom operated through a local partner ZAO DORIS, founded in 1996, co-owned and run by Olesandr Shepelev, represented on paper by his grandmother Maria Shevchenko, and a local strong man, Party of Regions MP Nurulislam Arkallaev, represented on paper by his wife. Infokom and DORIS rolled out a nationwide data network for corporate clients, primarily banks linking up to global payment systems, large companies and government bureaucracies. DORIS faded in importance after the turn of the century, as Ukrtelekom started expanding its own network, but in the 1990s DORIS had a monopoly on internet communications for corporate clients in Donetsk region. Thus Shepelev and Arkallaev effectively ran Donetsk banks’ payment systems around the turn of the century.\n\nPrivatbank was one of DORIS’ clients, and a pioneer in using internet for data transfer. Around 2000, Privatbank in Donetsk introduced the first special payment centres handling households’ payment of utility bills, together with billing the state for the accompanying subsidies, that reached 100% for some classes of consumers, such as impoverished pensioners. Such centres thus controlled data for all local households, including personal data, and handled large financial flows. The first such centre was installed in Konstantinovka, where Arbuzov headed the town’s Privatbank branch.\n\nIn 2002, in the last year of Arbuzov’s employment as head of the branch, media reported a fraudulent scheme apparently run through the bank since 2000, involving the utilities billing datacenter: the scam was based on the centre not reporting deaths of consumers as required by contract, and thus continuing to claim state subsidies for utilities bills of pensioners, frequently as much as 100% of the bill, for years after their death, effectively the classic ‘dead souls’ scam known since Gogol’s times.\n\nThe fourth bank\n\nBorulko and associates may have continued as Achilles heel for Arbuzov even after the latter’s move to Kyiv in 2010. One of the figures closest connected to Borulko’s banks 2008-2009, former chairman of the supervisory board of Borulko’s National Standard, and CEO of his Evropeiskii Bank, Konstantin Krivenko, also originally from the Donetsk Privatbank division, was made adviser to Arbuzov in 2010, immediately before he took over at the National Bank. According to unconfirmed sources quoted by Ukrainskaya Pravda, Krivenko and Arbuzov are godfathers to each others’ children. Krivenko is now a member of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission.\n\nWhile the ‘bank robberies’ that the SBU publicly attribute to Borulko and Shepelev took place 2008-2009, in fact the scheme went into overdrive in 2010, after the Party of Regions came to power and were effectively calling the shots at the National Bank even before the resignation of long-serving head Volodymyr Stelmakh in December 2010.\n\nThe SBU in press communications in 2012 named three banks used in the deposit compensation scheme, but also mentioned a fourth unnamed bank. That bank was Dialogbank, a tiny Dnipropetrovsk bank put under temporary administration by the NBU in 2009. In 2010 extraordinary things happened at the bank. Still under temporary administration of the NBU at the start of 2010, in January 2010, Dialogbank was readmitted to full membership of the GDF, meaning that new deposits would be fully insured. In April 2010 a new investor injected UAH177.5m (22m) into the bank’s capital, and in July 2010 the NBU withdrew administrators.\n\nBy October 2010, the tiny bank’s loan book had grown from UAH 219m ($27m) in April 2010 to 826m ($101m), almost entirely loans made to legal entities. At the same time, deposits expanded from UAH 111m ($14m) in April 2010 to UAH 1092m ($134m) in October 2010, i.e. almost tenfold in 6 months. http://www.bank.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/category?cat_id=84853. While the loans went to legal entities, almost all the new deposits were owned by natural persons, according to NBU data.\n\nIn November 2010, the NBU reintroduced temporary administration. In May 2011, the bank’s licence was withdrawn and it was liquidated – and the process of the Guaranteed Deposit Fund paying out to the ‘depositors’ initiated.\n\nExamination of a number of law suits accompanying the liquidation of Dialogbank 2011-2012 shows that investors acquired the bank in April 2010 using a vehicle, Spetstroiproject-2007, whose owner on paper, was the CEO of Voskhod. Voskhod, a development company that builds and runs the Obzhora shopping mall chain in Donetsk, was co-founded in 2000 by none other than the wives of Oleksandr Shepelev and Vyacheslav Sobolev, former deputy mayor of Donetsk, according to Spark Interfax. Party of Regions MP Nurulislam Arkallaev, Shepelev’s partner in data network operator ZAO DORIS, took a stake in the company in 2006, and in fact is regarded by local sources as its guardian angel from the very beginning.\n\nOne week prior to recapitalisation of the bank in April 2010, Dialogbank had provided loans to five small companies roughly equivalent to the funds then injected into the bank’s capital. The loans thus apparently used to buy the bank in April 2010 were collateralised by a building owned by Arkallaev, at Universitskaya 36a in Donetsk, and the mortgage agreement was drawn up by public notary Victoria Soboleva, ex-wife of Vyacheslav, according to court records. After withdrawal of the bank’s license May 2011, the outstanding loans were settled against the capital injection, which had been declared invalid by the NBU, freeing the collateral from claims by the bank.\n\nArbuzov later claimed that the NBU had cracked down on the scheme. “We understand what happened in this bank and introduced a number of restrictions that prevented implementation of the planned scheme by its organizers,” he told Zerkalo Nedeli in February 2011.\n\nIn fact, court records shows that it was not the NBU, but Khoroshkovky’s SBU which had intervened November 2010, opening a criminal investigation into theft of funds from the DGF in the cases of Dialogbank, Volodmyrsky, Evropeiskii and Nationalny Standard, according to court records. http://www.reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/25773909,\n\nAdditionally, according to information provided by the DGF, it paid out a total of UAH 93m to 927 depositors / natural persons after the liquidation of Dialogbank in May 2011. But a court ruling of 14 December 2011 details that a suspiciously similar number of individual depositors, 920, had transferred their deposits to a Donetsk company Triumf – Servis, one of the five companies receiving loans in April 2010 prior to acquisition of the bank.\n\nhttp://www.reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/20268729\n\nThus apparently a payout was made after all to the organisers of the scheme, despite intervention by SBU and assurances by NBU.\n\nWhile Borulko has fled to Belarus, which appears to refuse to extradite him, Shepelev in October 2012 was still in Ukraine, fighting a parliamentary election as an independent. While it was clear that he would lose, and thus lose his immunity from prosecution, he was playing it cool in an interview he gave to RBK Ukraine in October: “Mr Derevyanko (SBU press secretary) made his announcement seven months ago. Since then, there has been enough time for investigative proceedings. If any criminal investigation was in progress, they would at least have invited me for an interview. (…) For three years rumours have circulated about my implication in various investigations, but if they really wanted to remove my deputy’s immunity, believe me they would have done it along time ago.”\n\nGraham Stack for Business New Europe (www.bne.eu)\n\nWhile Sean Quinn Sr, once Ireland’s richest man, goes to jail in Dublin for diverting assets placed under court injunction, bne enquiries indicate that one of the assets in question, Kyiv’s Ukraina shopping mall, has been pulled into the orbit of the family of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych – and out of the reach of Ireland’s authorities who claim it.\n\nIreland has been following on tenterhooks the slow motion fall of tycoon Sean Quinn Sr, formerly Ireland’s richest man but now a bankrupt jailbird. Part of the action has been set in Ukraine, including the drama’s top-rating “episode”: a hidden camera showing secret talks in Kyiv in January between Quinn family members and shadowy off-camera Ukrainians, which was leaked to press in July. The talks centred on the fate of the Ukraina shopping mall in the heart of Kyiv, which Sean Quinn owned, and which Ireland’s state-owned bank that was set up to try to clean up the mess of bad loans caused by the financial crisis is trying to recover, in lieu of Quinn’s $3.5bn debt.\n\nThis so-called “bad bank”, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC), even used the video recording in court to prove that the Quinns still controlled Ukraina mall, and had thus diverted assets in defiance of court orders. The Quinns argued the video showed that on the contrary they had lost control of the mall, and were begging for payments.\n\nShopping for assets\n\nThe saga started in 2011, with the Quinns facing bankruptcy and attempting to shift ownership of real estate assets across Central and Eastern Europe away from their creditors, as they have admitted. Quinn Holdings Sweden AB held 92.75% of the Ukraina mall. But as acknowledged by the Quinns, they assigned a $45m debt claim against Ukraina to shell companies as a means of asset stripping. The Ukraina shopping mall brings in around $10m in rent per year, and is valued at around $78m.\n\nBut the Quinns, while admitting initial intent to divert assets, say that in the course of the tangled machinations, they were double-crossed and lost control over the mall to local partners due to questionable court decisions in Ukraine.\n\nThe IBRC argues, however, that the Quinns are still calling the shots – and thus in contempt of court injunctions, a criminal offence. A Dublin high court sentenced Sean Quinn Sr to a nine-week prison sentence on November 2, following three-month sentences handed down to Sean Quinn Jr and his cousin Peter Quinn in the summer.\n\nIn December 2011, a Kyiv court recognised the debt claim against the Ukraina mall of Cyprus offshore Lyndhurst. In the following months after the decision, a complex chain of securities transactions saw the Ukraina debt transferred first to an obscure Kyiv brokerage Zenit, and then onto an equally obscure Kyiv brokerage Elegant Invest. In July, a Kyiv court ordered that Elegant Invest be recognised as the successor to Lyndhurst, in the court decision of December 2011 legitimising the $45m debt claim against Ukraina.\n\nPresident of mall Ukraina?\n\nAccording to b"
