        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Authoritarian International\n\nStephen Hall argues that democracies can preserve their norms and values from increasing attacks and backsliding by better understanding how authoritarian regimes learn. He focuses on the post-Soviet region, investigating two established authoritarian regimes, Belarus and Russia, and two hybrid regimes, Moldova and Ukraine, with the aim of explaining the concept of authoritarian learning and revealing the practices that are developed and the sources of that learning. Hall ﬁnds clear signs of collaboration between countries in developing best survival practices between authoritarian-minded elites, and demonstrates that learning does not just occur between states; rather, it can happen at the intra-state level, with elites learning lessons from previous regimes in their own countries. He highlights the horizontal nature of this learning, with authoritarian-minded elites developing methods from a range of sources to ascertain the best practices for survival. Post-Soviet regional organisations are crucial for the development and sharing of these survival practices as they provide ‘learning rooms’ and training exercises. dr stephen g. f. hall is a lecturer (assistant professor) in Russian and post-Soviet politics in the Department of Politics, Languages, and International Studies at the University of Bath.

They were not opposition demonstrators, but came from pro-Kremlin1 groups, such as the All-Russian International Youth Union, Cossack units, and pro-Kremlin parties like the (il)Liberal Democrats. In a show of strength, they marched through central Moscow. These factions united under the anti-Maidan banner. Established by the Kremlin, anti-Maidan incorporates many pro-Kremlin organisations, and its very name provides its raison d’être, to counter a potential Euromaidan on Moscow’s streets. Anti-Maidan highlights a clear example of Kremlin learning. The anti-Maidan case emphasises the aim here to investigate authoritarian learning, and how leaders and political elites look to others both externally and internally to gauge what has worked previously and determine which practices are best for consolidating power. By investigating why and how authoritarian learning occurs and explaining what and when leaders attempt to develop best practices, we provide understanding to how – and when – authoritarian learning happens, and the practices developed. The four case studies chosen are Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. These choices will be justiﬁed fully later but for now a brief explanation serves to help frame how authoritarianism is deﬁned in this book. When Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Vladimir Putin came to power in 1994 in Belarus and 2000 in Russia, both had authoritarian ambitions and tendencies. Before Lukashenka and Putin obtained power, both countries were weak democracies with different elite factions competing for power. Once Lukashenka and Putin took over, they 1\n\nWhile the term ‘the Kremlin’ is quite general and does not detail the nuances of a regime consisting of many different – and ﬂuid – factions, we feel that such terms as the Kremlin and Bankova – in the Ukrainian context – provide a useful shorthand. This is not to say that we are unaware of the nuances and complexity, but for clarity’s sake we use such terms when necessary.\n\nix\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nbegan creating more authoritarian political systems, which took time to fully consolidate. Both had authoritarian tendencies and ambitions and were able to re-shape the political system to create a more hierarchical power system. Power was consolidated – partially at least – by learning from other examples. For instance, Lukashenka spent much time in the early 1990s in Uzbekistan discussing the practices Uzbek president Islom Karimov had used to consolidate power.2 Before continuing, it is necessary to explain why Moldova and Ukraine are included as cases in understanding authoritarian learning. Both states have had leaders who have attempted to consolidate power in their own hands. Examples of this are Vladimir Voronin in Moldova and Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine, who upon coming to power attempted to create political systems that gave them and their allies as much power as possible. To best consolidate power, it is likely that Voronin and Yanukovych looked to established authoritarian regimes – Belarus and Russia among others – to ascertain which practices worked best. Moldova and Ukraine are case studies because elites in each state demonstrated mimetic behaviour, where they look to others for how to act. The term ‘mimetic’ refers to imitation and mimicry and both cases are examples of the mimicry of others. This is a crucial part of authoritarian learning and is represented well by Moldova and Ukraine. Yet authoritarian learning is more than imitation. It involves transmissive copying, where ideas are directly discussed between authoritarian-minded elites. Consequently, authoritarian learning is a mixture of diffusion, copying, and imitation. There has been a gap in the literature on learning for a while, on authoritarian learning speciﬁcally. Much of the literature on political learning has concentrated on democratic learning and has only given a perfunctory analysis as to how authoritarian regimes and leaders with autocratic tendencies learn. Both established autocracies and individual leaders look to internal and external examples to develop best practices to establish their control. With only 10 per cent of the world’s population living in fully established democracies and the other 90 per cent living in weak democracies, semi-authoritarian, or fully autocratic regimes, understanding this process is crucial. Established 2\n\nPersonal Interview: IR39203\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nautocracies need to continue to learn to react to an ever-changing political and economic environment. Similarly, in weak democracies leaders come to power looking at neighbouring autocracies as examples of how to consolidate power. Understanding how these processes operate and determining the practices used to retain power offers ways for Western governments and regional organisations to develop best practices to frustrate the growth of pseudo-democracies. Establishing these practices will help counteract democratic backsliders and reduce opportunities for leaders with authoritarian ambitions to consolidate power. By knowing that authoritarian regimes learn and developing methods to counteract this, Western democracies and international organisations can begin to develop practices to weaken the capacity of authoritarian-minded elites to establish this regime type. For authoritarian regimes and leaders with authoritarian tendencies, learning and adaptation are important for survival. By investigating four post-Soviet3 case studies – or other cases from the same region as each other – it can be asserted that we are only investigating learning, rather than authoritarian learning. It is natural that regimes in a region cooperate with one another. In the post-Soviet context, because networks and connections have existed since the Soviet Union, and regional organisations have been established, this is learning, rather than authoritarian learning. This is one interpretation that is a viable explanation for what is happening in the post-Soviet space. However, there is an alternative explanation. As will be shown, there are speciﬁc lessons being learnt. These are practices to better consolidate power and, in established autocracies, to restrict alternatives that could – if left alone – result in power loss. Consequently, what is being learnt are survival strategies for authoritarian leaders to retain power.\n\n3\n\nIt is with reticence that this category is used. Especially after the most recent events with Russia’s annexation of Ukraine – but even before – the post-Soviet label was an oxymoron. These states have been independent for over 30 years and have become their own entities. The perception of the term post-Soviet implies that the only thing that binds them is the fact that they are successors to the Soviet Union, an event that occurred at the end of 1991. However, for the sake of simplicity the term ‘post-Soviet’ is used here. After all, there is still not better categorisation in existence to combine the cases of Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine other than to use the tired label of post-Soviet.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nThis learning encompasses external and internal examples and takes in cases of failure and success. Authoritarian leaders are concerned with ensuring their survival and look to others for examples of what to do and what not to do. Although the leaderships in Belarus and Russia portrayed the 1990s as a time of internal disunity, they learnt from these failures what not to do. Leaders with authoritarian tendencies will also be concerned by revolutions that either see the demise of established autocracies – the Arab Spring – or happen in the neighbourhood – the 2013–14 Euromaidan in Ukraine – that could become a beacon for opposition to unify around. Similarly, examples of successful authoritarian consolidation will be copied. One example of this is Belarus’s preventive counter-revolution, which began in 2000 and partially served as an example to Russia. Authoritarian leaders will also learn from internal examples. This is especially the case in Moldova and Ukraine. Since independence in 1991, both states have had leaders with authoritarian ambitions, but due to the vagaries of the political system of both no leader has been able to consolidate power for long enough to establish an autocracy. Consequently, leaders with authoritarian ambitions in Moldova and Ukraine will likely look to established autocracies to learn. They will also learn from previous domestic leaders with authoritarian tendencies to ascertain what lessons can be drawn from previous internal failures or successes. Although Belarus is somewhat of an outlier, the other three cases at the very least claim that they are democracies. All four look to what is happening in Western democratic states and learn from these polities. For instance, the Russian government claimed that the 2012 legislation that required non-governmental organisations in receipt of funding from external sources to register as foreign agents was a direct cognate of the American Foreign Agents Registration Act. Leaders in Moldova and Ukraine have tried to keep equidistance between the EU and Russia, with most elites wanting closer integration with the EU. While reforms and legislation may be taken from the EU playbook, their spirit can be re-interpreted to ensure regime survival. Authoritarian learning is not about learning ‘among’ autocracies, but how leaders with authoritarian ambitions develop best survival practices – and these can even come from democratic examples. Therefore, to understand authoritarian learning we need to concentrate on learning ‘by’ leaders with these tendencies. Learning\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\ncan be from established authoritarian regimes, democracies, and internal examples. Here we analyse learning rather than other issues like mimicry. While imitation of legislation and political structures, such as Russia making Sevastopol a federal city as it was in the Soviet Union, is relevant, this book concentrates on learning processes. To an extent imitation is a part of learning, but there are other areas that need to be addressed to best understand authoritarian learning. As shown later, authoritarian learning includes diffusion, emulation, adaptation, policy transfer, and learning and linkage. Authoritarian leaders, whether in established autocracies or wanting to preserve their power, are concerned with survival and use a mixture of diffusion, emulation, adaptation, policy transfer and learning, and linkage to increase their survival chances. While mimicry across the post-Soviet space has occurred regarding legislation and political structures, authoritarian regimes directly learn from one another to aid survival. Direct interaction is not required to induce learning as diffusion, emulation, and adaptation are all crucial authoritarian learning methods. However, as will be shown, there is plenty of evidence of direct interaction, which remains the most important tool for authoritarian learning. Regimes do not just learn from each other but also from domestic examples. The failure of authoritarian regimes can be traced as it often results in revolution and violence, which is easier to see. However, this only tells half the story of authoritarian learning. To truly understand authoritarian learning, learning from success is important too. Retrieving information from authoritarian regimes is difﬁcult, as when evidence does percolate out, it tends to be old. Personnel who were regime members tend to be tight-lipped about the intricacies of the system and few current regime personnel are willing to discuss how the regime increases its survival chances. The authoritarian black box remains shut and the information hidden behind access codes. This makes gathering information a convoluted task. Researchers have difﬁculty understanding the inner workings of these types of regimes and their learning capacity. Gathering evidence of authoritarian learning remains an inestimable challenge and one that involves the researcher becoming a poor man’s Sherlock Holmes to get data. It is possible that there are other explanations for what is occurring. But as the evidence shows here, authoritarian learning, where elites with\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nauthoritarian tendencies develop best practices through learning to strengthen their survival chances, is something that occurs in the postSoviet region and is very real. When starting research on this subject thirteen years ago, I naïvely imagined that authoritarian learning followed the model of a school, at which Nursultan Nazarbaev, Putin, and Lukashenka were either star pupils or teachers telling other autocrats how to establish best survival practices. It turned out the school analogy was incorrect. Rather, it is one of mad scientists who run solitary experiments in their laboratories and then share notes at a monthly – or sometimes annual – conference. This is an apt analogy as not all learning is successful and sometimes leads to regime failure; two test tubes when mixed can cause an explosion. As shown in Chapter 1, there is direct interaction in authoritarian learning, and the role of networks is important. However, diffusion, adaptation, emulation, and experimentation are also crucial. Further naivety surfaced again during my ﬁrst research ﬁeld trip to these four countries in 2016 where I assumed it would be Belarus where interviewees would require anonymity, as it is often considered the last European dictatorship. I felt people would be wary of speaking to an outside researcher who would be followed by the security services and might put interviewees – and himself – in danger. But many Belarusian interviewees did not require anonymity, and nor – disappointingly – did the security services appear to be interested in the research or researcher, at least not openly. Rather, it was in Moldova where interviewees were cautious. As one friend explained at the time, ‘He has ears everywhere.’ This was a reference to oligarch Vladimir Plahotniuc, who until 2019 controlled Moldova from behind the scenes. This explanation clariﬁed why there were more requests for anonymity among Moldovan interviewees than in the other three cases. Authoritarian learning is a fact. As the examples of Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine emphasise, it is different to its democratic counterpart. For instance, leaders with authoritarian tendencies and established authoritarian regimes revert to repression more easily; rely on networks to a far greater extent with only limited central control; and learn from success and failure as well as internal and external examples. While failure compels other authoritarian regimes to learn – as they are concerned with their survival and authoritarian breakdown forces others to quickly adapt – success is\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nrelevant, as other regimes want to emulate a winning model. There are several reasons why this monograph is relevant and timely. The literature on authoritarianism lags that of democratisation. Through tracing learning in four post-Soviet cases, learning processes and convergence can be investigated. Convergence is deﬁned as the merging of distinct attributes. The post-Soviet region has many authoritarian regimes and authoritarian-minded elites. This gives researchers an opportunity to enhance their understanding of authoritarian learning and corroborate the assumption that learning is important for authoritarian survival. As the number of authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes and weak democracies increases globally, understanding how they learn to keep control is important to better understanding how autocrats and proto-authoritarians are surviving and increasing in number. If leaders with authoritarian ambitions share ideas, it helps them consolidate power quickly, making democratisation harder as they become impervious to these efforts. The growing authoritarian challenge could affect processes such as globalisation or democratisation as the only-game-in-town, threatening, reinterpreting, or even reversing these trends. The authoritarian challenge may shape the world and lead to a less harmonious global order. Through investigating learning and consolidation practices the authoritarian learning literature is expanded. Currently, this literature is vague in what constitutes authoritarian learning and has a limited basis in wider learning theory. By establishing a theory of authoritarian learning – even if like democratic learning – the authoritarian learning literature will be signiﬁcantly improved.4 Existing literature has largely focused on interactions between autocracies and their mutual support for one another. There has been little literature speciﬁcally on how autocracies have learnt from the failure of other authoritarian regimes. Existing literature has largely focused on the ‘between’, rather than the ‘by’, which encompasses a range of tactics to improve survival chances. By contrast, analysis of the ‘between’ does not provide all the nuances of how authoritarian learning operates. Through in-depth investigation of the factors behind learning ‘by’, we signiﬁcantly contribute to the existing 4\n\nConversation with Thomas Ambrosio and Andrew Wilson at Aarhus University, 02/12/2016 and many conversations with both afterwards.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nauthoritarianism and learning literature and increase understanding of authoritarian learning. The four case studies of Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine provide excellent examples for understanding authoritarian learning. The investigation of authoritarian learning in the four cases starts in 2000 and ends in early 2021. The year 2000 was chosen as it is the start of Putin’s ﬁrst presidency and was a period when the authoritarian tendencies of President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine came out into the open. In 2001, the Communist Party of Moldova (PCRM), under President Voronin, came to power, and Voronin began to consolidate power. Lukashenka in Belarus had also fully consolidated power by the early 2000s. Therefore, 2000 seemed the most appropriate year to begin analysis. Early 2021 was chosen as the cut-off date as it allows for the 2020 Moldovan presidential elections to be analysed for learning examples. Having brieﬂy explained authoritarian learning and framed how the case studies ﬁt into investigating the concept, analysis of necessary literatures and providing greater explanation of ﬁt will be addressed in the next chapter. Although the analysis ends in 2021, there are a few points that need to be addressed. While it is likely that neither British or Australian prime ministers Harold Wilson and Gough Whitman ever said ‘A week is a long time in politics,’ this misquote attributed to both is relevant to recent events in the post-Soviet space and the four case studies. In August 2020, Lukashenka was re-elected for a sixth term. His victory at 80.1 per cent is of course likely pure ﬁction, as his challenger Svitlana Tsikhanouskaya galvanised a populace against the authorities’ poor handling of the economy and the COVID-19 pandemic. Having experienced state-wide protests, the Belarusian government failed to react and resorted to electoral practices used previously to get Lukashenka re-elected. Relying on repression, the regime appears to have won for now, but increasingly Lukashenka is an emperor with no clothes. Another major event was the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Initially planned by the Kremlin as a short war – reminiscent of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 – the war seems to have been underpinned by faulty intelligence coupled with a tenacious defence by the Ukrainian armed forces. At the time of writing, this has left Russia in a dire predicament. The Russian army has been ineffective, and factions appear to be ﬁghting their own individual\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\nwars. The Kremlin did not expect the collective West to unite in support of Ukraine and issue withering sanctions against Russia. After 2014, Putin began reforming the Russian army into a more effective ﬁghting force, while also reducing economic reliance on the West. However, the invasion of Ukraine has highlighted that fortress Russia was built on sand. Russia may emerge victorious in Ukraine, but if that happens it is likely to be in control of a destroyed country with a populace perceiving Russia as an occupier, as well as a domestic economy in tatters. Having started a war it is unlikely to win, Russia is left in an impossible situation. It cannot afford to withdraw from Ukraine as this would be cataclysmic for Putin’s domestic image, but nor can it win and turn Ukraine into a supportive ally. Consequently, Russia is in a trap of its own making and the regime will continue to fall back on repression. With Russia’s rapidly declining economy, it is likely what little money the regime has will go into repression and propaganda. Putin has always had at least one blind spot regarding Ukraine, having consistently failed to understand that Ukraine is different to Russia. As will be seen, the Kremlin has tried to impose what works in Russia on Ukraine and has been unsuccessful every time. This raises an interesting point for authoritarian learning. Although out of the remit of this book, it is likely that authoritarian-minded elites learn when they feel threatened and that there are many possible threats. Learning is a crucial part of developing best survival practices for authoritarian-minded elites, and, because there are multiple threats at any given time it is like these elites are constantly learning. Consequently, by playing the percentage game, it is likely that authoritarian-minded elites make mistakes and learn the wrong lessons. This can be fatal, but established authoritarian regimes can mostly turn these mistakes around. As will be shown later, social learning is a crucial aspect of learning. According to this theory, people learn from previous experiences and how they were socialised. Russians of Putin’s generation appear to really believe that Russians and Ukrainians are the same people, and this is a holdover from the Soviet period. Therefore, Putin is likely to continue to make the same mistake over Ukraine because he honestly believes that both countries are the same people. Hopefully the violence and death of about 12,000 Russian soldiers in eighteen days will end Putin’s erroneous belief.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\nAnother interesting point in the events in Belarus and Russia is that authoritarian learning may have a time limit. Both regimes have been effective at learning best survival practices over the past two decades. Yet, as the Belarusian example highlights, authoritarian regimes with a long tenure may eventually stop learning. Authoritarian leaders surround themselves with allies and sycophants and so information ﬂows may get stiﬂed, resulting in the top echelons of the regime being unable to react to events or understand changes in society. The Belarusian regime appears not to have reacted to events in 2017 and sleepwalked into the 2020 protests. Similarly, the inner circle around Putin appear to share the same views, and information that does not ﬁt existing perceptions is not passed up the channels of government. The war in Ukraine was allegedly based on intelligence from the security services that stated that Ukrainians were angered at their government and would welcome the Russian army. The ﬁrst part may have been true, but once the Russians appeared and began shelling Ukrainian cities, any dislike of the government in Kyiv quickly dissipated, and Ukraine united against the Russian invasion. Although the Belarusian and Russian regimes have been effective at learning to develop the best survival practices in the past, it is possible that both regimes are experiencing what we term ‘ivory tower syndrome’. For highly personalised regimes, this is a serious problem, as if the leaders do not have all information, they are likely to make mistakes. However, both leaders – especially Lukashenka – are survivors, and Putin has been a planner in the past. Although both regimes were reactive – rather than proactive – they were effective learners. Time will tell whether both regimes can re-develop their learning capacity, but it increasingly appears that both are suffering from ivory tower syndrome and increasingly reliant on repression. There are pointers towards re-invigorated learning – at least on the part of Russia – with the Russian authorities developing repressive tactics for anti-war protests like those used by the Belarusian regime during the 2020–21 protests. While outside the scope of this book, it may point to a return to learning in Russia. It is unlikely that there will be much discussion between Russian and Ukrainian elites – other than negotiating an end to the conﬂict – for the next few years. As will be shown, much learning among authoritarianminded elites is conducted through dialogue. Consequently, a direct conversation appears unlikely for now. Of course, it all depends on the\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\noutcome of the invasion. On the one hand, if Russia manages to win, then a quisling imposed on Kyiv by Moscow is unlikely to do much learning. Rather, they will simply implement diktats from the Kremlin. On the other hand, if Russia is defeated or an independent Ukrainian government exists, then direct dialogue will be unlikely. However, this does not mean that learning will not occur, and that Russia will not be a model for future Ukrainian authoritarian-minded elites to copy. Presently, there are Ukrainian elites who view close association with Russia as the endgame for Ukraine’s foreign policy. Although these factions are keeping a low proﬁle now, they are unlikely not to be involved in politics in the future – unless groups like the Opposition Bloc – For Life are banned. These elites will remain close to the Russian regime and will try to lead Ukraine on a path closer to Russia. Even if these factions are unsuccessful – due to the Russian invasion – Russia can still be a model of how best to consolidate power. Ukrainian elites from all sides of the political spectrum will still emulate and copy what Putin has done in Russia and try to implement some of these lessons in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky came to power in 2019, promising to only be president for one presidential term, but by late 2021 was already making statements about standing for a second term. While efforts to tackle corruption have been made on paper, organisations like the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) have faced pressure, as have journalists and investigative newspapers. Zelensky’s party – Servant of the People – holds a majority in parliament and allies have been put in positions of power. It is possible that by late 2021, Zelensky and his team were looking to the 2024 presidential election and a reelection bid. There was also growing dissatisfaction among Ukrainians. This was due to the perception that Zelensky – who was seen as an outsider – seemed either ineffectual or part of the political elite. The recent moves towards consolidation were likely a preventative response to potential protests. Russia would be an appropriate model to copy and emulate for consolidation. Of course, Zelensky is leader during a time of war and so will consolidate power, due to the external existential threat. The same could be said of his predecessor Petro Poroshenko as well. However, this does not detract from the fact that they must learn best practices from somewhere. This can be done from domestic sources – what worked for other Ukrainian presidents before – or\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxx\n\nPreface\n\nfrom an external source. It is unlikely that Ukraine is a Petri dish for developing ideas to control power. Rather these are taken – and learnt – from somewhere else, either internal or external. Should Ukraine repel the Russian invasion, Zelensky is likely to emerge with immense power and support externally and internally. This will provide Zelensky with an opportunity no other Ukrainian leader has had, the chance to consolidate power. Ukraine, which was once the quintessential ‘pluralist by default’ state, may have become a whole lot less pluralist. With North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership off the table – at least for now – and the fear that the EU may decide in June 2022 to kick the can of Ukrainian membership further down the road, the West will stop being attractive and there will be little incentive to reform and democratise. Time will tell if this scenario happens, but what can be said is that authoritarian-minded elites in Ukraine will continue to look to external and internal sources for developing the best practices for power consolidation. By contrast to the other three case studies, Moldova has not been greatly affected by recent events, although it remains to be seen whether the de facto break-away territory of Transnistria will manage to break away formally. For now, this scenario appears less and less likely as the Russian army becomes further bogged down in Ukraine. In 2019, Vladimir Plahotniuc over-played his hand and tried to blackmail Igor Dodon into staying in the cartel Plahotniuc had created to run Moldova. Plahotniuc’s Party of Democracy (PDM) had close ties with Dodon’s Party of Socialists (PSRM), and both had been negotiating a coalition. But by trying to blackmail Dodon, Plahotniuc had the opposite effect and the PSRM joined the ACUM (Now) Bloc in an anti-PDM and anti-Plahotniuc coalition. Yet, the PSRM – which is pro-Russian – and the ACUM Bloc – which was pro-European – were ideologically opposed, and the coalition of convenience to remove Plahotniuc from controlling the state behindthe-scenes fell apart ﬁve months later. The PSRM pulled the plug on the coalition and formed a new government with the PDM. For a moment, it appeared the cartel was back. However, the coalition lasted less than a year with the PDM withdrawing their support. The PSRM stumbled on as a minority government until the parliamentary election in July 2021. In November 2020, Dodon lost the presidency to the proEuropean Maia Sandu, and in July 2021 the pro-European Party of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxxi\n\nAction and Solidarity won the parliamentary elections. This gave the pro-European elites control of parliament and the presidency. For the most part, out of the four cases, Moldova has recently been the success story: staying out of geopolitics, not experiencing statewide protests, and slowly making progress on democracy. However, there are still questions of how far judicial reform will go, and the current reform proposal does allow for a future government to implement judicial controls. The run-up to the 2024–5 electoral cycle may see the current government attempt to increase their control, and the opposition Bloc of Communists and Socialists still retain authoritarian tendencies. If they survive to parliamentary elections in 2025, they will offer staunch opposition and could win. This would weaken democratic reforms and bring authoritarian-minded elites back to power. The next few years will be an interesting time for authoritarian learning. Authoritarian-minded elites learnt in the past and it is unlikely this has changed. The Belarusian and Russian regimes are likely to re-engage in learning, as this helps with survival. If not, then the results will be cataclysmic for current Belarusian and Russian elites. While both regimes may have reached that ivory tower moment – which is itself interesting for authoritarian learning – this seems unlikely. Similarly, there remain authoritarian-minded elites in both Moldova and Ukraine, and the trend in both countries has been that as time has gone on, incumbent governments have sought to protect themselves from losing elections by developing a palette of best tactics. It is unlikely that this trend will be broken anytime soon. For all the tribulations that have befallen the four case studies in the past three years, authoritarian learning remains relevant, and its investigation has never been more pertinent to better understanding authoritarian survival and consolidation.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWhile readers will ultimately be the judge of its quality, this book is far better than it otherwise would have been thanks to many others who devoted a great amount of time and effort in helping me over the years.

I am grateful to David McDowell and Theresa Callan, whose passion and stark views – having grown up on opposite sides of the Belfast divide – gave me my ﬁrst experiences of political science and a passion that never left. Vitali Silitski inspired this work, but his untimely death meant there was never a chance to meet him. Thomas Ambrosio wrote what effectively became the Bible for this research, Authoritarian Backlash, and there were many meetings and discussions with Tom that helped bring this work to fruition. Tom read earlier drafts and always made time for discussion, and a great amount of thanks goes out to the time he devoted to the book. Similarly, further thanks must go out to various members at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at University College London. Andrew Wilson and Peter Duncan were incredibly helpful and generous with their time and ideas. Both dealt with numerous questions and read many drafts – not all of them relevant – but still had the patience to recommend new avenues to follow. Andrew helped open doors to interviewees and the wider academic world, with one interviewee starting the interview with ‘I am only meeting you because you are Andrew’s student.’ Ben Noble helped form the arguments and Felix Ciută took the argument apart, which resulted in better framing. Special thanks must go to Sherril Stroschein, who set the ball in motion in 2009 by advising investigation of the then new concept of authoritarian learning.

The emergence of the antiMaidan highlights a phenomenon that we seek to address, understanding how, why, what, and when authoritarian regimes learn. Authoritarian learning in the post-Soviet region began with the Colour Revolutions in Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004), and Kyrgyzstan (2005), which rocked the region and alarmed other authoritarian regimes. While the ﬁrst successful effort at countering Colour Revolutions was the May 2005 Andijon massacre – which made Uzbek president Islom Karimov ‘a hero’ to other post-Soviet leaders, such as Russian president Vladimir Putin (Zygar, 2016: 107) – a subtler approach was needed for other post-Soviet regimes who did not have the same coercive capacity as the Uzbek regime or could not afford the repercussions if any news of a massacre seeped out (Levitsky and Way, 2010: 45). One regime had been developing subtler methods for keeping the authoritarian regime in power: Belarus. Since an earlier revolution in 2000 in Serbia, the Belarusian authorities had developed tactics to limit such an event occurring in central Minsk (Hall, 2017b). Former Serbian president Slobodan Milošević and incumbent Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenka had regularly visited one another until Milošević’s fall from power.2 The demise of Milošević worried Lukashenka, especially when protesters in Belgrade shouted, ‘Today 1\n\nDiamond et al., 2016: 17.\n\n2\n\nPersonal interview: IR39203.\n\n1\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n2\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nMilošević, tomorrow Lukashenko.’ Throughout the 2000s, the Belarusian authorities faced protests due to Lukashenka’s fraudulent electoral victories. In response, best practices were developed and adapted throughout the decade, whether that was by inﬁltrating the opposition, using media to galvanise support for Lukashenka (Wilson, 2021a: 194–6), or using regime-controlled candidates at elections to give the façade of competitive elections (Shraibman, 2018) and keep the regime in power. At this time, Belarus became something of a testing ground for devising authoritarian practices and stopping Colour Revolutions (Wilson, 2021a: 209). Throughout the decade, the regime continued to learn and devise best counter-revolutionary practices (Hall, 2017b). State structures such as the Kamitet Dzyarzhaunay Bezopasnosti (KDB)3 have been at the forefront of this learning, highlighted by the dossier the KDB compiled in 2005 on previous Colour Revolutions and Belarusian protests, allowing the regime to devise anti-protest tactics (Korosteleva, 2012: 45). The document’s focus was on the 2004 Orange Revolution, with information compiled by Belarusian embassy staff in Kyiv.4 The Belarusian authorities’ learning has been a constant process, as they adapt to both domestic failures and those of other regimes. After all, authoritarian regimes must continuously learn, as failure is not an option. However, this process of constant adaption is not always successful. For example, during protests in 2006, the Belarusian authorities allowed protesters to set up a tent city with 10,000 demonstrators congregating in central Minsk (Korosteleva, 2012: 39), forcing the government to use extensive force to clear protesters, resulting in increased sanctions from Western states.5 Therefore, during protests in 2010 the regime did not allow protesters to congregate in central Minsk,6 with security forces quick to arrest protesters. The speed and force of the crackdown was a direct lesson from the 2006 failure.7 The Belarusian example emphasises how authoritarian regimes adapt and learn from previous events, and that learning encompasses success 3\n\n4\n\n5 7\n\nTo differentiate the Belarusian security services from its Soviet namesake, we use the Belarusian transliteration.

Learning is not just a Belarusian phenomenon. As Gel’man (2015b: 6) argues, during the 2011–2012 protests, the Kremlin copied Belarusian practices from demonstrations in 2010. A similar point is made by Hall (2017b), who contends that the Kremlin learnt from Belarus’s preventive counter-revolution. There is evidence that authoritarian elites learn. In this book, we draw out questions like what, how, and why they learn, what constitutes authoritarian learning, and when it takes place. This will be analysed in due course, but ﬁrst it will be necessary to deﬁne a few of the book’s key concepts.\n\n1.2 Some Deﬁnitions To better tackle this book’s subject, deﬁnitions of authoritarianism, learning, and authoritarian learning need to be made. While we will deﬁne authoritarianism, the wider literature on authoritarianism will not be analysed in this chapter. Rather, the focus is on authoritarian tendencies, as it is the leaders and personnel, rather than the regimes and institutions, that are of concern here. It is why we analyse patronal politics here to explain why authoritarianism has not consolidated in Moldova and Ukraine but there are periods of attempted consolidation. After deﬁning authoritarianism and authoritarian tendencies, deﬁnitions of learning and authoritarian learning follow.\n\n1.2.1 Deﬁning Authoritarianism Although the focus here is on authoritarian learning, which does not necessarily mean that only authoritarian regimes learn, it is necessary to explain what is meant by authoritarianism. We deﬁne ‘authoritarianism’ as the political system of polities that regularly hold elections but violate these to such an extent that they become mere box-ticking exercises, and in which freedom of association, information access, and freedom of expression are highly circumscribed. This deﬁnition accounts for the two case studies of Belarus and Russia. However, to understand authoritarian learning fully, it is necessary to analyse authoritarian-minded leaders and not just fully-ﬂedged authoritarian regimes. Not all post-Soviet states can be classiﬁed as authoritarian, but there have been attempts by previous and (current) leaders to consolidate power. This is done through learning and copying established authoritarian regimes. Consequently, we need to address the concept\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n4\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nof authoritarian tendencies. This is seen in the example of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who, in the ﬁrst 100 days of his presidency after 2010, set about weakening parliament, bringing the judiciary closer to him personally, and bringing in his clan – or family8 – to positions of power in the state. This allowed Yanukovych to begin to consolidate power, and the regime focused on examples of what Russia had done previously in similar situations, with Yanukovych often saying – when given examples of practices from European states – ‘That’s great, but what about Russia.’9 Glasius (2018: 517) deﬁnes authoritarian practices as ‘patterns of action that sabotage accountability to people over whom a political actor exerts control, or their representatives, by means of secrecy, disinformation and disabling voice’. However, the deﬁnition of authoritarian tendencies used throughout this book is one where leaders try to quickly consolidate power. This explains the situation in Belarus and Russia, as well as periods of attempted authoritarian consolidation by leaders in Moldova and Ukraine. Patronal politics explains how the four case studies operate and function. Hale (2015: 9–10) explained patronal politics as how ‘individuals organize their political and economic pursuits primarily around the personalized exchange of concrete rewards and punishment through chains of actual acquaintance’. Power resides with persons who can enforce it, and these people act as patrons to ‘a large and dependent base of clients’ (Hale, 2015: 10). Within patronal societies, politics ‘revolves chieﬂy around personalized relationships joining extended networks of patrons and clients, and political struggle tends to take the form of competition among different patron–client networks’ (Hale, 2015: 21). Analysing state structures through the prism of patronal politics explains the four political systems studied in this book, and patronal politics accounts for why regimes in Belarus and Russia have held power longer than regimes in Moldova and Ukraine. Hale (2015: 64) differentiates between states with single and multiple pyramids of power. If there is a single pyramid of power, then there is one leader who acts as patron and all patron–client ties are hierarchical. This makes authoritarian consolidation relatively easy, and accounts for how politics operates in Belarus and Russia. By contrast, multiple pyramids of 8 9\n\nNot blood relatives – although also true – but people close to him personally.

This makes it much harder for any one person to gain ascendancy and consolidate power, due to competition. Such a system operates in Moldova and Ukraine, and explains why there are periods of attempted authoritarian consolidation but little success. Authoritarians have found ways to protect themselves (Carothers, 2006; Gershman and Allen, 2006; Krastev, 2006; Schedler, 2002), often acting with conﬁdence and challenging the West (Diamond, 2008; Gat, 2008). One should not just study these regimes but try to understand why they are surviving. Much authoritarian endurance is due to dialogue, emulation, copying, and learning. If democracy is no longer resurgent and authoritarian regimes collaborate to counter democratic norms (Cooley, 2013; 2015; Diamond, Plattner, and Walker, 2016: 4; Koehler, Schmotz, and Tansey 2016) and develop best survival practices, then it is crucial to understand how authoritarian regimes do so – through learning. So, it is essential to better understand authoritarian learning: what it is, how it occurs, why it occurs, and when it occurs.\n\n1.2.2 Deﬁning Learning Learning is a process that weighs the costs and beneﬁts of a particular decision (Breslauer and Tetlock, 1991: 5). Regime learning involves individual and collective learning, making it hard to differentiate what learning is and what it is not (Levy, 1994: 280). A restrictive deﬁnition of learning would show little, but a broad deﬁnition would show too much (Breslauer and Tetlock, 1991: 17). For Braun and Gilardi (2006: 299), learning combines the effect A has on B and analysis of the actions of others. This sequence of processes allows learning to be gauged. Simmons and Elkins (2004) agree that learning happens because people learn from external actors and historical examples; however, both explanations do not cover personal learning. Levy (1994: 296) deﬁned learning as a ‘change of beliefs, skills, or procedures based on the observation and interpretation of experience’. But this is the result of learning. Learning is the process of engagement, leading to the development of beliefs, skills, ideas, and discernment. This deﬁnition explains learning without being too broad or narrow. It is individual- and state-focused, accounts for success and failure, explains knowledge from foreign and domestic\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n6\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nexperiences, and incorporates new knowledge. Therefore, the deﬁnition of learning used here refers to changes of beliefs, skills, or procedures. As shown later, ascertaining a change in beliefs – at least in the case studies – will be hard to investigate. But changes in skills – in how tactics change – and procedures – legislative changes and institution structures – can be shown. This will point to learning and highlight instances of authoritarian learning.\n\n1.2.3 Deﬁning Authoritarian Learning In the 1990s, much research assumed that democratisation would become the political system of most – if not all – states. But the Afghan and Iraq wars – coupled with the resurgence of international terrorism – contributed to a decrease in the promotion of democracy. With events like the Colour Revolutions in the post-Soviet space, which saw the collapse of some authoritarian regimes, other neighbouring autocracies – or as Tolstrup (2014: 2) labels them ‘democracy-inhibiting powers’ – initiated preventive counter-revolution measures to limit the capacity of external democratisation pressures. Learning best survival practices is the best way to limit these stresses. To perform best, autocrats and like-minded leaders must develop appropriate practices for retaining control. Solnick (1998) explained the collapse of the Soviet Union using an analogy of a bank run. As the regime became increasingly weak, state personnel stopped following orders, which precipitated further collapse. In this way, authoritarian-minded leaders must stop all opposition to ensure the bank survives. Ultimately, they must be right all the time, as the opposition only has to be right once. Learning helps this survival by developing methods to stop future bank runs. Using the deﬁnition of authoritarian learning provided by Hall and Ambrosio (2017: 143) – ‘a process in which authoritarian regimes adopt survival strategies based upon prior successes and failures of other governments’ – as a starting point, we add a new dimension to this deﬁnition. Hall and Ambrosio (2017) focus on learning between states, but we see authoritarian learning as incorporating internal learning from examples of success and failure. For instance, Hall (2017a) showed how Yanukovych had learnt from his own failures during the 2004 Orange Revolution when he became president in 2010 – even though he went on to make\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.3 Research Findings\n\n7\n\nother mistakes that precipitated the Euromaidan in 2013. Authoritarian learning is a process of engagement leading to development, and in many circumstances resulting in a change of beliefs, adaptation of skills, and ideas.\n\n1.3 Research Findings There are several key ﬁndings from our analysis of authoritarian learning in the four case studies. Firstly, authoritarian learning had been an under-theorised topic with only a few attempts, principally by Hall and Ambrosio (2017) and Bank and Edel (2015), to conceptualise and explain it. Existing literature stuck with the mantra that because authoritarian states B, C, and D do something like authoritarian state A in a short space of time, there must have been learning. Through an in-depth analysis of authoritarian learning from various perspectives, we have expanded current thinking. We provide a theoretical basis for authoritarian learning that combines experiential and social learning theories and policy transfer, diffusion, linkage and leverage, and lesson-drawing to provide a theoretical basis for authoritarian learning. Authoritarian leaders constantly learn and adapt to stay in power, and they regularly collaborate to develop best practices to remain in power. Second, authoritarian learning is less hierarchical than widely considered by the existing literature. For example, Hall (2017b) found that Belarus was a testing ground for the Kremlin to learn methods developed in Belarus to counter democratisation pressures, thereby stopping a Colour Revolution in Moscow. However, existing literature has concentrated on the notion that Russia dominates the post-Soviet region and dispenses diktats that other post-Soviet regimes follow. This notion of Russian dominance results in concepts like ‘authoritarian promotion’ and ‘authoritarian gravity centres’. For advocates of authoritarian promotion, the Kremlin promotes authoritarianism in other post-Soviet states. Even if true – which is by no means certain – there appears little account for the Kremlin’s seeming lack of interest in promotion, and little to explain how Russia can promote authoritarianism to established authoritarian regimes that have been around longer than Putin has been in the Kremlin. Similarly, for advocates of the concept of authoritarian gravity centres, some authoritarian regimes are magnets for others to learn from. Yet, we show that the hierarchy is far ﬂatter than widely\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n8\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nconsidered, and authoritarian learning is a cooperative process in which best practices are shared. In the post-Soviet region, Russia is the regional hegemon. However, it does not dominate learning, and learns itself from best practices developed by others. Of course, once the Russian authorities instigate policy, other post-Soviet regimes follow, with the foreign agents law being a good example of this.10 However, the notion that other post-Soviet regimes learn solely from Russia does not truly represent the nuances of authoritarian learning. Third, both external and internal networks of authoritarian learning are extensive, with both network types offering opportunities for dialogue, sharing of best practices, and learning. Existing literature on authoritarian learning has not delved deeply into the regional institutions, state structures, or elite networks to determine which are engaged in learning. Rather, current literature often focuses on the presidential level. But as shown here, much learning occurs in siloviki structures, such as the presidential administration, security service, interior ministry, and security council. Although there is a lack of evidence – due to information being simply unavailable – it is likely that regular meetings are held by junior personnel. Consequently, learning occurs at many levels. For now, this is supposition, and future research can address this, but there is information from higher echelons that these are the key learning networks. Fourth, existing literature investigated the inter-state level, analysing interactions between authoritarian elites. However, this misses a key aspect of authoritarian learning: the intra-state level. By analysing intra-state-level learning in the four case studies, we show that there is signiﬁcant inter-linkage between factions and clear opportunities for dialogue, sharing of best practices, and learning. Elite inter-linkage in the four case studies means the elites all know each other, learn from each other, and are concerned with protecting their own power and that of their allies. Regarding Moldova and Ukraine, this has been detrimental to the full democratisation of both states, and it is one reason why the Belarusian and Russian regimes are consolidated authoritarian regimes. 10\n\nThe foreign agents law was passed in July 2012 and requires any organisation – and in later renditions of the law individuals – in receipt of ‘support’ or under the ‘inﬂuence’ of a foreign government to register as a foreign agent. The term ‘foreign agents’ was used in the 1930s under Stalin to jail and torture people accused of being enemy agents.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.3 Research Findings\n\n9\n\nFifth, analysing regional organisations provides a clear understanding of authoritarian learning. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), and the Union State between Belarus and Russia all provide a perfect opportunity for dialogue, information sharing, and learning. The CIS, the CSTO, and the SCO bring members together in training exercises to develop best practices to ascertain which tactics are effective at keeping incumbent leaders in power. In particular, the CIS and the CSTO regularly hold training exercises for members to gauge which methods work best in each scenario. This notion of learning through training is one that is represented by the CIS’s anti-terrorist centre, which regularly holds training exercises to develop tactics to deal with protesters. Although evidence is scant, it is likely that the SCO’s anti-terrorist centre develops similar methods against protesters too. Consequently, regional organisations provide learning through training. These regional organisations hold regular meetings of different committees, thereby increasing networks that exist between post-Soviet states. There are recurring CIS inter-departmental meetings. These become venues for dialogue, as well as opportunities to share best practices and engage in learning. The Union State is crucial for dialogue and learning, as it allows personnel to regularly meet and harmonise legislation, which helps learning. Membership or having observer status of most of these organisations helps the Belarusian and Russian authorities learn and consolidate power. By contrast, Moldova and Ukraine are not members of many of these organisations, which likely affects an authoritarian leader’s capacity to consolidate authoritarianism in both states, as there is less opportunity to learn. It is likely that the role of regional organisations in authoritarian learning is not a post-Soviet phenomenon, but this needs to be investigated in future studies. Sixth, while diffusion certainly plays a role in authoritarian learning, epitomised by the joke that ‘90 per cent of what to do can be found on Google’,11 there is something stronger than diffusion occurring. On the one hand, there is emulation and diffusion, where authoritarian elites decide what to implement and imitate one another by looking at what each other are doing. On the other hand, there is actual dialogue and the sharing of best practices. Elites in Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and 11\n\nPersonal interview: HW29578.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n10\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nUkraine collude and there are strong pointers towards direct dialogue and cooperation on techniques, a much stronger concept than looking at what is occurring elsewhere and implementing accordingly. Of course, this does not detract from the relevance of diffusion, policy transfer, and emulation, which are integral aspects of authoritarian learning. However, there appears to be a concerted effort by authoritarian elites to talk with one another, share best practices, and learn. This is something far stronger than merely looking at what other authoritarian elites do and copying them. Seventh, learning from failure has received much analysis in the literature partly because it is easier to see failure. As authoritarian leaders try not to provide many opportunities for the public to replace them non-violently, their demise is often violent, with mass protests and previous elites imprisoned or dead. Naturally, other authoritarian leaders do not want to share that fate, so they ascertain the causes of failure and develop practices to counter such possibilities occurring domestically. Learning from success is harder to measure for researchers, but it is no less relevant to authoritarian learning. Internal sources of learning are the main sources of learning from success. For example, Vladimir Plahotniuc and Petro Poroshenko – in Moldova and Ukraine respectively – learnt from the success of previous domestic regimes to control power. While success is hard to measure, it is as relevant to authoritarian learning as failure. Eighth, the existing literature has concentrated on the inter-state level. However, to fully understand authoritarian learning, it is necessary to bring in the internal dimension as well. Authoritarian leaders and elites are as likely to learn from internal examples as from external examples. The internal dimension is crucial for understanding authoritarian learning. This is particularly so for Moldova and Ukraine, as current elites in both countries have worked in past regimes and so retain knowledge of past mistakes and successes that can be used for learning in the present.\n\n1.4 What Is Authoritarian Learning? Having brieﬂy deﬁned authoritarian learning in Section 1.2.3 and explained that it is more than ‘a process in which authoritarian regimes adopt survival strategies based upon prior successes and failures of other governments’ (Hall and Ambrosio, 2017: 143) including learning from\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.4 What Is Authoritarian Learning?\n\n11\n\ninternal examples, this section analyses the concept in more detail. We will ﬁrst investigate some of the literature on diffusion, policy transfer, linkage, and lesson-drawing. Then, the different elite networks involved in authoritarian learning will be analysed, which will be shown to be extensive. Treisman (2020) shows that historically most authoritarian regimes begin a democratic transition not because the elite initiates such a process, but because they make a mistake that they cannot control and consequently lose power. Therefore, learning from external and internal examples is a way for authoritarian leaders, or those similarly minded, to reduce the potential for making a mistake that leads to either democratisation or a more open system. However, there is nothing to stop autocratic-minded leaders from learning the wrong lessons. For example, Viktor Yanukovych learnt some lessons from his failure to become Ukrainian president in 2004, which he implemented when he ﬁnally became president in 2010. Leonid Kuchma had not had a party of power or attempted to dominate state institutions. Kuchma had allowed too many competing regime clans. Yanukovych perceived these as mistakes on the part of Kuchma and so strengthened control over state institutions and restricted access to resources for other clans. However, the attempted power grab and ostracising of important factions led to regime disunity and increased support for the opposition. Once the Euromaidan began, elites who were alienated by Yanukovych had their excuse to help depose him (Hall, 2017a). While learning often helps authoritarian-minded elites, it can also result in failure and precipitate collapse. This makes learning a quandary for autocratic-minded elites. Authoritarian learning occurs by combining policy transfer, diffusion, linkage and leverage, and lesson-drawing. Authoritarian-minded elites regularly collaborate with one another on best practices to remain in power. Authoritarian learning is less hierarchical than widely considered by existing literature. Unlike the literature on authoritarian gravity centres – which perceives learning as coming from authoritarian regimes that act as models to lesser regimes (Kneuer and Demmelhuber, 2016; Kneuer et al., 2019), we show that authoritarian learning is more horizontal, with the authorities in Minsk and likely Nur-Sultan, Baku, and Toshkent bringing best practices to the table. Both external and internal networks of authoritarian learning are extensive and offer dialogue opportunities, sharing of best practices,\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n12\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nand learning. Existing literature has not delved deeply into regional institutions or state structures to determine which are engaged in learning. Analysis here shows that presidential administrations, security councils, interior ministries, parliaments, and even ambassadors are involved in learning. In the presidential administrations and interior ministries, there are regular meetings held at senior and junior levels. This provides one venue for learning, and with regular meetings at all government levels, there are many opportunities for learning. Within the four case studies, elites have – mostly – long known one another, learn from each other, and are concerned with protecting their own and allies’ power. Such practices in Moldova and Ukraine have been detrimental to democratisation, and this is one reason why the Belarusian and Russian regimes are consolidated authoritarian regimes. For the case studies, post-Soviet regional organisations are central to understanding authoritarian learning. These institutions provide opportunities for dialogue, sharing information, and learning by bringing member states together in training exercises to ascertain which tactics are most effective to retain power. Regional organisations hold regular meetings, thus increasing the learning networks between post-Soviet states. The Belarusian and Russian regimes are members or observers of most of these regional organisations. These institutions provide learning opportunities and share best practices, thereby helping both regimes with learning and power consolidation. By contrast, Moldova and Ukraine are not members of many post-Soviet regional organisations, which could go some way to explaining why there has been no successful authoritarian regime in either. Diffusion is crucial to authoritarian learning – epitomised by the joke12 that ‘90% of what to do can be found on Google’. There is emulation and diffusion, where authoritarian regimes decide what to do based on what others do, and imitate one another. Then there is actual dialogue and the sharing of best practices. There are strong pointers to direct dialogue and cooperation on strategies and techniques, where regimes go beyond simply imitating what is occurring in another authoritarian state. While learning from success is harder to demonstrate, it is as crucial to understanding authoritarian learning as learning from failure. Similarly, internal examples are as important as external examples for authoritarian-minded elites to learn from. 12\n\nPersonal interview: HW29578.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.4 What Is Authoritarian Learning?\n\n13\n\nThere is a debate within the literature on authoritarian diffusion as to quite what is happening, with different conceptualisations of diffusion put forward. Silitski (2010) labelled collaboration between the Belarusian and Russian regimes an ‘authoritarian international’. While we will show that there is direct dialogue and far more than just governments looking at what other governments do, the idea of an authoritarian international, where authoritarian leaders and elites try to make the world safe for authoritarianism, is too much of a stretch. There has been a wealth of literature on this idea, centred around authoritarian promotion (Brady, 2016: 190; Burnell, 2010; Kurlantzick, 2013; Lankina, Libman, and Obydenkova, 2016: 1603; Melnykovska, Plamper, and Schweickert, 2012; Vanderhill, 2013; 2014; Yakouchyk, 2016). This literature contends that at least some authoritarian regimes – such as China, Iran, and Russia – are promoting authoritarianism to other regimes. While authoritarian promotion is a type of diffusion, with one regime providing lessons for others, it is a very vertical perception of authoritarian learning. As argued here, authoritarian learning is more horizontal than vertical. Similarly, if the notion of authoritarian promotion exists, it is ‘more opportunistic than strategic’ (von Soest, 2015: 624). Yakouchyk (2016) writes about active and passive autocracy promotion, although passive promotion is something of an oxymoron in terms (Tansey, 2016: 147–8). Melnykovska, Plamper, and Schweickert (2012: 750) argue that the Central Asian states are susceptible to Russian and Chinese autocracy promotion, and Vanderhill (2013: 76) contends that Putin helped Lukashenka consolidate power. Examples like these highlight potential failings of authoritarian promotion. Melnykovska and colleagues (2012) fail to explain how the fully consolidated authoritarian regimes of Central Asia required Russian authoritarian promotion. This is also true for Vanderhill’s (2013) analysis of Russia and Belarus. Rather, authoritarian learning is less vertical than authoritarian promotion accounts for. This is also the case for the literature on authoritarian gravity centres. This concept sees authoritarian regimes coalescing around authoritarian models – such as China, Russia, and possibly Singapore – with these models providing learning opportunities for their satellite states. Kneuer and Demmelhuber (2016) and Kneuer and colleagues (2019) are correct to highlight the importance of learning among authoritarian regimes. Similarly, this literature is right to mention that there are some\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n14\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nauthoritarian regimes that likely serve as models for other authoritarian leaders. However, too much emphasis is placed on these authoritarian models, making other states mere satellites with limited independence – unable even to leave the sphere of inﬂuence – other than to learn from the centre. As shown in this book, authoritarian learning is more horizontal than widely perceived in current literature. Certainly, there are authoritarian models that other authoritarian leaders copy, but as Hall (2017b) showed, authoritarian gravity centres also learn from so-called satellites. We follow the notion of diffusion laid out by Ambrosio (2010), where diffusion is a mix of learning from applicable models from across the political spectrum rather than copying everything from a single model regardless of local applicability. While diffusion relies on ‘simple demonstration effects’ (Ambrosio and Tolstrup, 2019: 2746), we show that it not just about analysing what others do and implementing accordingly. Rather, there is regular dialogue and authoritarian learning is heavily networked and horizontal. This will be explained later in the chapter and in more detail in later chapters. As authoritarian-minded elites are concerned with losing power, they will learn from all sources, both internal and external. But they do not just learn from other authoritarian regimes. Rather, it is more nuanced. Concerned with survival at all costs, authoritarians learn from any pertinent examples. Consequently, learning from successes and failures of democracies are also taken into consideration. Political systems and policies developed in democracies have been copied and reinterpreted to help consolidation.13 To better ensure survival, authoritarian leaders will copy successful policies from democracies to placate citizens, highlight that the governments are democratic – or at least modernising – and offer increased legitimacy. Therefore, authoritarian learning is not learning between authoritarians but learning from all sources to better ensure survival. Authoritarian learning occurs through dialogue, emulation, and copying. Regimes learn by analysing internal and external examples of what worked and what failed. Authoritarian learning is continual, as authoritarian regimes must constantly learn to halt anything that could precipitate regime collapse. Therefore, authoritarian learning is about constant 13\n\nPersonal interview: LD03148, who showed how the Russian authorities have consistently changed the electoral system – originally copied from Germany – to ensure electoral victory. Similarly, the 2012 foreign agents law was copied from the American Foreign Agents Registration Act but made more restrictive.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.4 What Is Authoritarian Learning?\n\n15\n\nadaptation, although this adaptation is not always successful. Authoritarian learning is a collaborative process with some regimes acting as testing grounds for others and all authoritarian regimes trying to develop best practices that other authoritarian regimes can use. Consequently, authoritarian learning is highly networked and less hierarchical, with all regimes able to bring ideas and practices to the table for consideration. Regional organisations play a signiﬁcant role in providing dialogue venues, opportunities to share best practices, and ascertain through training exercises what works directly. Therefore, learning is crucial to increasing understanding on why authoritarian regimes persist.\n\n1.4.1 Theoretical Framework The theoretical framework designed for explaining authoritarian learning is explored here and is tabulated to provide clarity on the terminological mess that is the literature on political learning. When studying this literature, researchers use different idioms to mean the same thing. Within this framework we analyse different learning theories that help explain authoritarian learning, assessing experiential and social learning in Table 1.1. Table 1.2 investigates the literature on political learning and shows how parts of this literature help explain authoritarian learning. After investigating theory and political learning, we turn to analysing diffusion and linkage and leverage, as both are crucial to authoritarian learning. Experiential and social learning help explain authoritarian learning as they account for both success and failure. Social learning is relevant as it includes habitus and communities of practice, which are relevant to authoritarian learning, as authoritarian elites rely on their past and networks for learning examples. Diffusion – which is a crucial part of authoritarian learning – ﬁts into social learning theory. Before addressing diffusion, we investigate how authoritarian learning ﬁts into the literature on political learning. We deﬁne political learning as ‘any change in behaviour due to a change in perception about how to solve a problem’ (Haas, 1991: 63). In this literature there is policy transfer, adaptation, and learning. The differences between them are small and we use policy transfer as an umbrella term as it includes both learning and adaptation. Three other literatures of relevance are diffusion, emulation, and lesson-drawing. Each is brieﬂy explained in Table 1.2.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n16\n\nIntroduction: A Contextual Overview\n\nTable 1.1 Theoretical framework of authoritarian learning Theory\n\nExplanation\n\nExample(s)\n\nExperiential learning\n\nIn experiential learning, the learner acquires knowledge by devising questions and investigating those questions to construct meaning (Marin, 2015: 855), combining concrete experience, reﬂective observation, abstract conceptualisation, and active experimentation (Brookes, 1995: 66). It incorporates examples of failure and success (Marin, 2015: 855). Social learning is how a person learns from their social environment. People observe others and learn what to do (success) and what not to do (failure) (Bandura, 1963, 1971: 3).

Each is referred to throughout the book to explain examples used to highlight authoritarian learning in the four case studies. Each is relevant to authoritarian learning, but policy transfer and diffusion are crucial. Authoritarian leaders and elites diffuse information between one another. According to Ambrosio and Tolstrup (2019: 2746), diffusion involves ‘any intentionality on the part of the policy innovator and can occur through simple demonstration effects’. However, as will be shown here, authoritarian learning involves direct meetings and sharing of experiences, rather than simply demonstration effects. While the statement ‘90% of what to do can be found on Google’14 is true, what will be shown is that there is something more happening than the spread of ideas. Lemon and Antonov (2020) correctly highlighted policy transfer in the CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, but we feel that rather than being distinct, policy transfer is a part of authoritarian learning. Emulation is crucial to understanding authoritarian learning, allowing other authoritarian leaders and elites to ascertain what worked elsewhere and act accordingly (Beissinger, 2007: 259). Demonstration effects are important. If it can be demonstrated that something works, it is likely to be copied. Similarly, we show that authoritarian learning is far more horizontal than the literature considers. Kneuer and Demmelhuber (2016) and Kneuer and colleagues (2019) have postulated the concept of authoritarian gravity centres, where some authoritarian regimes – for example China and Russia – are models for other authoritarian regimes. This is indeed the case with economic and political models – especially 14\n\nPersonal interview: HW29578.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nStrang (1991: 325) deﬁned diffusion as ‘any process where prior adoption or practice in a population alters the probability of adoption for remaining non-adopters’.\n\nEffort to match – or even surpass – a policy or practice through imitation.\n\nPolicy-makers draw lessons to achieve best results and learn from others about what to do and what not to do (James and Lodge, 2003: 180; Tosun, 2013: 19).\n\nEmulation\n\nLesson-drawing\n\nExplanation\n\nDiffusion\n\nTypes of political learning\n\nTable 1.2 Learning-related topics and authoritarian learning\n\ndiffused, as restrictive NGO legislation occurred later in Azerbaijan (2013), Tajikistan (2014), Kazakhstan (2016), Ukraine (2017), and China (2017). • Many post-Soviet states copied Russian legislation, although there is no direct policy transfer (Bader, M, 2014).

Bader, Grävingholt, and Kästner (2010: 84) argued that authoritarian regimes have inspired others. However, while these regimes may be models for others, it does not necessarily mean that learning is unidirectional from Beijing and Moscow to other capitals. Rather, we show that authoritarian learning is more networked and horizontal than widely considered. We turn to analysing networks and the actors involved in authoritarian learning.\n\n1.4.2 Networks of Authoritarian Learning Although networks are investigated in more detail later, it is crucial to explain what a network is, and which regional and state institutions are relevant for authoritarian learning. Using Solnick’s (1998) bank run analogy, authoritarian leaders want to restrict any possible regime change. To do so requires that they learn from successful and failed examples to better retain power. As the leader and elites do not want to lose power, they develop best survival practices and have a direct stake in regime preservation and power retention. Consequently, there are extensive networks involved in authoritarian learning. We argue that authoritarian learning is not just learning from external sources, but involves internal examples too. Table 1.3 shows which regional and state institutions, and elite groups are involved in learning in the four case studies at both levels. These networks are crucial to authoritarian survival. Such networks are extensive – especially external networks – with diverse groups involved in learning. Authoritarian-minded leaders and elites, whether in consolidated or unconsolidated regimes, are concerned with remaining in power and so they learn from external and internal examples of success and failure. Learning is constant although not always successful. It is crucial to understand that authoritarian learning is constant, as elites look to preserve power, although it is not always effective. As authoritarian leaders and elites are constantly learning to preserve power and reduce chances of regime collapse, learning networks are extensive. Although we list these networks by state institution or regional organisations, they are likely to cross structures and be less centralised than we represent here. Similarly, many networks overlay themselves on formal government structures that do not necessarily represent these actual institutions. This creates a dichotomy, where networks are both centralised and decentralised at the same time.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nHeavily involved in providing information on what is happening in their own country to the elites in the country of their ambassadorship and vice versa. Many ambassadors – particularly for Russia – had close ties with the elites in the countries they are ambassadors to. This allowed them to give information on what was happening in their own country. During protests between 2015 and 2016, the Ukrainian ambassador to Moldova met interior ministry personnel to discuss the Euromaidan in Ukraine between 2013 and 2014. Embassies play a role with Belarusian and Russian embassy staff allegedly on Kyiv’s streets during the Orange Revolution (2003–4) and Euromaidan (2013– 14) taking notes and sending these back to higher-ups in Minsk and Moscow. Personnel in these institutions regularly meet one another in regional organisations and inter-foreign ministry commissions, allowing for discussion and learning. There are regular meetings between foreign ministries due to state visits too. Agreements to share information are crucial to learning opportunities provided by this institution.\n\nAmbassadors\n\nForeign ministries\n\nInvolvement in external learning\n\nInstitution\n\nTable 1.3 Regional and state institutions and personnel involved in learning\n\nLimited involvement in internal learning.\n\nAs an external network, ambassadors have little role in internal learning.\n\nInvolvement in internal learning\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009089630.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nThere are regular meetings in regional organisations and there are inter-state commissions too.

Consequently, tactics have changed in how interior ministry personnel deal with protests in Moscow and St Petersburg for fear of creating a spiral.
