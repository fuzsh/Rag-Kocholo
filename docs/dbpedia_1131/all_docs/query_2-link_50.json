PARSIPPANY, N.J. – John Demjanjuk, the former U.S. citizen who w<strong>as</strong> appealing his 2011 conviction in Germany on 28,060 counts <strong>of</strong> accessory to murder at the Nazi death camp in Sobibor, Poland, died at a German nursing home on March 17. He w<strong>as</strong> 91. <strong>The</strong> Bavarian police confirmed Mr. Demjanjuk w<strong>as</strong> found dead early that day in his room in a nursing home in southern Germany. He had been suffering from bone marrow dise<strong>as</strong>e and chronic kidney dise<strong>as</strong>e. Mr. Demjanjuk, who through the years w<strong>as</strong> accused <strong>of</strong> being a guard at several Nazi camps, denied that he ever served <strong>as</strong> a camp guard and insisted that he w<strong>as</strong> a prisoner <strong>of</strong> war – a Red Army soldier captured by the Germans. He claimed he w<strong>as</strong> a victim <strong>of</strong> mistaken identity. Mr. Demjanjuk’s German lawyer, Ulrich Busch, underscored that his client “died unconvicted and <strong>as</strong> an innocent man according to European and German law.” Dr. Busch explained that, according to the European Convention <strong>of</strong> Human Rights, anyone charged with a criminal <strong>of</strong>fense is presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law, and in Germany that means once the final verdict is handed down on an appeal. Munich court spokeswoman Margarete Noetzel told the press that, under German law, because the defendant died before his final appeal w<strong>as</strong> heard and because a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, he is still technically presumed innocent. In a statement to <strong>The</strong> <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Weekly, Mr. Demjanjuk’s son, John Jr., said: “My father died a free man, innocent and not convicted since a successful appeal could not conclude upon his death. Over the l<strong>as</strong>t 35 years, the only criminal proceeding that did conclude resulted in an Israeli acquittal. “Since the accusations in Germany, I stated that it w<strong>as</strong> a political farce <strong>as</strong>, at his advanced age and poor health, he could not survive another legal process. As Nazi Germany committed crimes against humanity by killing a forgotten several million Soviet POWs by a tortuous starvation and dise<strong>as</strong>ed death, today’s Germany intentionally chose such a surviving POW <strong>as</strong> a scapegoat to blame <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s for the Nazi crimes by German criminals which historically went unpunished. (Continued on page 4) KYIV – <strong>The</strong> March 18 <strong>vote</strong> in the Kyiv Obl<strong>as</strong>t town <strong>of</strong> Obukhiv <strong>of</strong>fered a hint <strong>of</strong> what to expect for the October 28 national parliamentary <strong>elections</strong> – a n<strong>as</strong>ty, even physical battle replete with fraud accusations, intimidation and violations, both before and on the day <strong>of</strong> the election. <strong>The</strong> day’s antics included an <strong>as</strong>sault committed by a Party <strong>of</strong> Regions national deputy, disputes about the <strong>vote</strong> count and contradictory election law, <strong>as</strong> well <strong>as</strong> allegations <strong>of</strong> fraud techniques such <strong>as</strong> intimidation, denial <strong>of</strong> candidate registration, <strong>vote</strong>-buying, fake exit polls and ballot-stuffing. One <strong>of</strong> the chief contenders for City Council chair, Anatolii Shafarenko <strong>of</strong> the populist UDAR party, w<strong>as</strong> denied access to polling stations to observe, his party reported. <strong>The</strong> nationalist Svoboda Party candidate, Valerii Vorobets, w<strong>as</strong> denied registration altogether in mid-February, in an alleged violation <strong>of</strong> election law. Additionally, “the government used old ‘trusted’ technologies, including so-called ‘carousels,’” UDAR Deputy Chair Artur Palatnyi said in a March 18 press rele<strong>as</strong>e. “What happened in Obukhiv w<strong>as</strong> a warm-up and dress rehearsal for the future parliamentary <strong>elections</strong>.” <strong>The</strong> election w<strong>as</strong> held to select a City Council chair to succeed Volodymyr Melnyk, a Party <strong>of</strong> the Regions member who died in an unusual car accident in October 2011. <strong>The</strong> declared winner w<strong>as</strong> Oleksander Levchenko, also <strong>of</strong> the Party <strong>of</strong> Regions, who reportedly earned 39 percent <strong>of</strong> <strong>vote</strong>s. Voter turn-out w<strong>as</strong> unusually low at 41 percent, which National Deputy Iryna Her<strong>as</strong>hchenko <strong>of</strong> the Our Ukraine- People’s Self-Defense faction said reflected the exhaustion most <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s have for politics. In all, 28,600 <strong>vote</strong>rs c<strong>as</strong>t their ballots at 15 local polling stations, reported the Committee <strong>of</strong> Voters <strong>of</strong> Ukraine (CVU). <strong>The</strong> CVU, led by Oleksander Chernenko, reported no falsifications, overlooking pre-election corruption such <strong>as</strong> the denied registration <strong>of</strong> Mr. Vorobets’ candidacy and the denied registrations <strong>of</strong> representatives from the Front for Change and UDAR – both leading opposition parties – to local election commissions. Mr. Chernenko’s claim <strong>of</strong> “more or less normal” <strong>elections</strong> w<strong>as</strong> not supported by the UDAR and Svoboda parties, <strong>as</strong> well <strong>as</strong> the Spilna Sprava (Common Cause) civic movement and National Deputy Andrii Parubii <strong>of</strong> the Our Ukraine-People’s Self-Defense Bloc. Tymoshenko accused <strong>of</strong> “high tre<strong>as</strong>on” RFE/RL KYIV – A majority in the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Parliament h<strong>as</strong> <strong>vote</strong>d to accuse jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko <strong>of</strong> committing “high tre<strong>as</strong>on” during negotiations on a 2009 g<strong>as</strong> contract with Russia. Ms. Tymoshenko is currently serving a seven-year prison term on charges she abused her <strong>of</strong>fice during those negotiations, which resulted in an incre<strong>as</strong>e in the price Ukraine paid for Russian g<strong>as</strong> imports. Lawmakers <strong>vote</strong>d to endorse a parliamentary investigation claiming that Ms. Tymoshenko’s actions National Deputy Iryna Her<strong>as</strong>hchenko (Our Ukraine- People’s Self-Defense) speaks to the press at the Verkhovna <strong>Rada</strong> two days after she w<strong>as</strong> manhandled by National Deputy Petro Melnyk (Party <strong>of</strong> Regions) at a polling station in Obukhiv, Kyiv Obl<strong>as</strong>t. Indeed, Mr. Chernenko’s credibility h<strong>as</strong> been questioned by political observers ever since his predecessor, Ihor Popov, resigned from the CVU chairmanship in 2009 to join the Single Center party, which is closely affiliated with the Party <strong>of</strong> Regions. Since then, Mr. Chernenko h<strong>as</strong> made <strong>as</strong>sessments on several <strong>elections</strong> which were not considered by numerous political observers and players to be objective. “<strong>The</strong> sociological sampling <strong>of</strong> Obukhiv is a lot better for the opposition than Ukraine’s average, yet the victory w<strong>as</strong> gained by the Party <strong>of</strong> Regions candidate,” Mr. Parubii wrote on his Ukrayinska Pravda blog posted on March 19. “Obviously, the <strong>vote</strong> didn’t occur without falsifications, evidence <strong>of</strong> which is the brutal attack on Iryna Her<strong>as</strong>hchenko by a Party <strong>of</strong> Regions bandit with a deputy’s mandate, <strong>as</strong> well <strong>as</strong> ‘blue sweaters’ and fake exit polls,” he wrote. National Deputy Petro Melnyk <strong>of</strong> the Party <strong>of</strong> Regions violently grabbed the petite Ms. Her<strong>as</strong>hchenko after she refused his demands that she leave a polling station before the <strong>vote</strong> count began. He argued that she didn’t have the right to witness the count, while she insisted she had the right to observe <strong>as</strong> a national deputy. “I realized that neither my status, nor personal relations, will save me from similar behavior by [my] colleagues from (Continued on page 4) UNIAN/Aleksandr Sinitsa “bear signs <strong>of</strong> high tre<strong>as</strong>on.” <strong>The</strong> report alleges that Ms. Tymoshenko acted “in favor <strong>of</strong> a foreign state” because her private company allegedly owed Russia’s Defense Ministry more than $400 million and she possibly faced criminal prosecution. Ms. Tymoshenko’s <strong>of</strong>fice dismissed the accusations <strong>as</strong> “complete rubbish.” <strong>The</strong> European Union and the United States have condemned Ms. Tymoshenko’s prosecution <strong>as</strong> politically motivated.
