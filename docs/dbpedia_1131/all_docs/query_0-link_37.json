        "text": "Citation preview\n\nNote on Transliteration and Translation\n\nThe transliteration system employed in this book is a modified version of British Standard, and is used in all cases except those where convention decrees otherwise. Thus the Cyrillic letter ‘ю’ becomes ‘yu’, ‘я’ becomes ‘ya’, and at the beginning of names ‘е’ becomes ‘ye’ (i.e. Yevgeny rather than Evgeny). For the sake of readerfriendliness the ‘—ий’ or ‘—ый’ at the end of words is rendered simply as ‘—y’ (i.e. Dmitry rather than Dmitrii); similarly, in forenames ‘кs’ has been rendered ‘x’ (i.e. Alexei rather than Aleksei). Diacritics representing the Russian and Ukrainian hard and soft signs have been omitted in proper nouns. Note also that the Ukrainian ‘g’ (‘г’) is pronounced as an ‘h’; thus Lugansk is pronounced as Luhansk, and Tyagnybok is spoken as Tyahnybok. In general, for ease of reading, proper names have been anglicised and the conventional forms applied: thus Oleksandr is mostly given as Alexander, Serhiy as Sergei and Andriy as Andrei, unless the context is clearly Ukrainian. In addition, Kyiv will be rendered Kiev, and other place names will conform to the majority language spoken in the region: thus we will have Lviv, the only one of Ukraine’s ten largest cities with a Ukrainian-speaking majority; but Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov and Odessa, where Russian is the majority language. No political or cultural preference is thereby implied. Transliteration in bibliographical references will largely follow the more precise Library of Congress system (albeit with ‘ya’ for ‘я’ and ‘yu’ for ‘ю’), and so the reader may at times notice variations between the spelling in the text and that found in the references. All translations, unless otherwise indicated, are by the author.\n\nvii\n\nPreface\n\nIn 2014, history returned to Europe with a vengeance. The crisis over Ukraine brought back not only the spectre but the reality of war, on the one hundredth anniversary of a conflict that had been spoken of as the war to end all war. The great powers lined up, amid a barrage of propaganda and informational warfare, while many of the smaller powers made their contribution to the festival of irresponsibility. This was also the seventy-fifth anniversary of the beginning of World War II, which wreaked so much harm on Central and Eastern Europe. The fall of the Berlin Wall 25 years earlier and the subsequent end of the Cold War had been attended by expectations of a ‘Europe whole and free’. These hopes were crushed in 2014, and Europe is now set for a new era of division and confrontation. The Ukrainian crisis was the immediate cause, but this only reflected deeper contradictions in the pattern of post-Communist development since 1989. In other words, the European and Ukrainian crises came together to devastating effect. The ‘Ukrainian crisis’ refers to profound tensions in the Ukrainian nation and state-building processes since Ukraine achieved independence in late 1991, which now threaten the unity of the state itself. These are no longer described in classical ideological terms, but, in the Roman manner, through the use of colours. The Orange tendency thinks in terms of a Ukraine that can finally fulfil its destiny as a nation state, officially monolingual, culturally autonomous from other Slavic nations and aligned with ‘Europe’ and the Atlantic security community. I describe this as a type of ‘monism’, because of its emphasis on the singularity of the Ukrainian experience. By contrast, Blue has come to symbolise a rather more plural understanding of the challenges facing Ukraine, recognising that the country’s various regions have different historical and cultural experiences, and that the modern Ukrainian state needs to acknowledge this diversity in a more capacious constitutional settlement. For the Blues, Ukraine is more of a ‘state nation’, an assemblage of different traditions, but ix\n\nPreface\n\nabove all one where Russian is recognised as a second state language and economic, social and even security links with Russia are maintained. Of course, the Blue I am talking about is an abstraction, not the blue of Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions. The Blues, no less than the Orangists, have been committed to the idea of a free and united Ukraine, but favour a more comprehensive vision of what it means to be Ukrainian. We also have to include the Gold tendency, the powerful oligarchs who have dominated Ukraine since the 1990s, accompanied by widespread corruption and the decay of public institutions. Since independence, there has been no visionary leader to meld these colours to forge a Ukrainian version of the rainbow nation. The ‘Ukraine crisis’ refers to the way that internal tensions have become internationalised to provoke the worst crisis in Europe since the end of the Cold War. Some have even compared its gravity with the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. The world at various points stood close to a new conflagration, provoked by desperately overheated rhetoric on all sides. As I shall describe later, the asymmetrical end of the Cold War effectively shut Russia out from the European alliance system. The failure to establish a genuinely inclusive and equal European security system imbued European international politics with powerful stress points, which in 2014 produced the international earthquake that we call the Ukraine crisis. There had been plenty of warning signs, with President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian Federation’s first leader, in December 1994 already talking in terms of a ‘cold peace’, and when he came to power in 2000 President Vladimir Putin devoted himself to overcoming the asymmetries. The major non-state institution at the heart of the ‘architecture’ of post-Communist Europe, the European Union (EU), only exacerbated the tensions rather than engaging in transformative conflict resolution. The EU represented the core of what in this book I call ‘Wider Europe’, a Brussels-centric vision of a European core that extended into the heartlands of what had once been an alternative great-power system centred on Moscow. The increasing merger of Wider Europe with the Atlantic security system only made things worse. Russia and some European leaders proposed not so much an alternative but a complementary vision to the monism of Wider Europe, which I and others call ‘Greater Europe’: a way of bringing together all corners of the continent to create what Mikhail Gorbachev in the final period of the Soviet Union had called the Common European Home. This is a multipolar and pluralistic concept of Europe, allied with but not the same as the Atlantic community. In Greater Europe there would be no need to choose between Brussels, Washington or Moscow. In the absence of the tensions generated by the post-Cold War ‘unsettlement’, the peace promised at the end of the Cold War would finally arrive. Instead, the double ‘Ukrainian’ and ‘Ukraine’ crises combined with catastrophic consequences. x\n\nPreface\n\nThis book is both personal and political. The Cold War division of Europe is the reason I was born and grew up in Britain and not in Poland, but, even before that, war and preparations for war had scarred the family. In the interwar years my father, an agronomist by profession but like so many of his generation also a reservist in the Polish army, marched up and down between Grodno and Lwów (as it was then called). He told of the 25 kilograms he had to carry in his backpack, with all sorts of equipment and survival tools. The area at the time was part of the Second Polish Republic, and for generations had been settled by Poles. These were the kresy, the borderlands of Europe grinding up against the ever-rising power of the Russian Empire. With the partition of Poland in the eighteenth century, Grodno and what is now the western part of Belarus was ceded to Russia, while Lemberg (the German name for Lwów) and the surrounding province of Galicia became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. On gaining independence in 1918 and with Russia and the nascent Ukrainian state in the throes of revolution and civil war, the various armies repeatedly marched back and forth across the region. In the end the Polish state occupied an enormous territory to the east of the Curzon Line. These were the lands occupied by Joseph Stalin, following the division of the area according to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939. Poland was invaded on 1 September and against the overwhelming might of Adolf Hitler’s armies the Polish forces fell back, only for the Soviet Union to invade on 17 September. My father’s unit soon came up against the Soviet forces, and when greeted initially by the Poles as coming to support them against the Germans, they were asked to disarm. My father escaped to Hungary, but many of his reservist comrades were captured, and eventually murdered in Katyn and other killing sites. My father subsequently joined the Polish Second Corps under General Anders, and with the British Eighth Army fought at El Alamein, Benghazi, Tobruk and then all the way up Italy, spending six months at Monte Cassino. At the end of the war Poland was liberated, but it was not free. Unable to return to the homeland, the family was granted refuge in Britain. In the meantime, the Soviet borders were extended to the west, and Lwów became Lvov. These were territories that had never been part of the Russian Empire, and when Ukraine gained independence in 1991 became the source of the distinctive Orange vision of Ukrainian statehood. Today Lvov has become Lviv, while its representation of what it means to be Ukrainian is contested by other regions and communities, notably the Blues, each of which has endured an equally arduous path to become part of the modern Ukrainian state. As for the political, being a product of an ideologically and geographically divided Europe, I shared the anticipation at the end of the Cold War in 1989–91 that a new and united Europe could finally be built. For a generation the EU helped transcend xi\n\nPreface\n\nthe logic of conflict in the western part of the continent by binding the traditional antagonists, France and Germany, into a new political community, one that expanded from the founding six that signed the Treaty of Rome in March 1957 to the 28 member states of today. The Council of Europe (CoE), established in 1949, broadened its activities into the post-Communist region, and now encompasses 47 nations and 820 million citizens, as its website proudly proclaims. The European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and its additional protocols established a powerful normative framework for the continent, policed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), based in Strasbourg. Russia in the 1990s actively engaged with the EU, signing a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in 1994, although it only took effect on 30 October 1997 following the first Chechen war, and the next year Russia joined the CoE. However, another dynamic was at work, namely the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Also established in 1949 to bring together the victorious Western allies, now ranged against the Soviet Union in what had become the Cold War, NATO was not disbanded when the Soviet Union disintegrated and the Cold War came to an end. This was the source of the unbalanced end to the Cold War, with the Eastern part dissolving its alliance system, while NATO in the 1990s began a march to the east. This raised increasing alarm in Russia, and, while notionally granting additional security to its new members, it meant that security in the continent had become divisible. Worse, there was an increasing perception that EU enlargement was almost the automatic precursor to NATO expansion. There was a compelling geopolitical logic embedded in EU enlargement. For example, although many member states had reservations about the readiness of Bulgaria and Romania to join, there was a fear that they could drift off and become Western versions of Ukraine. The project of European economic integration, and its associated peace project, effectively merged with the Euro-Atlantic security partnership, a fateful elision that undermined the rationale of both and which in the end provoked the Ukraine crisis that is the subject of this book. The failure to create a genuinely inclusive and symmetrical post-Communist political and security order generated what some took to calling a ‘new Cold War’, or, more precisely in my view, a ‘cold peace’, which stimulated new resentments and the potential for new conflicts. It became increasingly clear that the demons of war in Europe had not been slain. Instead, the Ukraine crisis demonstrates just how fragile international order has become, and how much Europe has to do to achieve the vision that was so loudly proclaimed, when the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, of a continent united from Lisbon to Vladivostok. The Ukraine crisis forces us to rethink European international relations. If Europe is not once xii\n\nPreface\n\nagain to be divided, there need to be new ideas about what an inclusive and equitable political and security order encompassing the whole continent would look like. In other words, the idea of Greater Europe needs to be endowed with substance and institutional form. Unfortunately, it appears that the opposite will happen: old ideas will be revived, the practices of the Cold War will, zombie-like, come back to life, and once again there will be a fatal dividing line across Europe that will mar the lives of the generation to come. This is far from inevitable, but to avoid it will require a shift in the mode of political intercourse from exprobration to diplomacy, and from denunciation to dialogue. Thus the personal and the political combine, and this is as much an exploration of failed opportunities as it is an account of how we created yet another crisis in European international politics on the anniversaries of the start of two world wars and a moment of hope in 1989. My father’s generation suffered war, destruction and displacement, and yet the European civil war that dominated the twentieth century still inflames the political imagination of the twenty-first. It is my pleasure to acknowledge the support of the James Madison Trust within the framework of the project ‘New Architectures of Europe’. I much appreciate being an honorary senior research fellow at the Centre for Russian, European and Eurasian Studies (CREES) at the University of Birmingham, which provides access to Russian-language electronic materials but above all to a community of scholars still committed to the best traditions of ‘bourgeois objectivity’. As always, my friends, colleagues and staff at the University of Kent make it a stimulating and congenial place to work, while the partnership with the Higher School of Economics in Moscow adds enormously to our common intellectual endeavour. The list of those who have helped in the preparation of this work is endless, but I would like in particular to thank Nicolai Petro, who generously hosted my visit to Odessa, and my colleagues at the Kyiv-Mohyla University, in particular Andriy Meleshevich and Volodymyr Kushnirenko, who helped make my visit to Kiev so challenging and interesting. I am most grateful to Iradj Bagherzade and Jo Godfrey at I.B.Tauris for the support and encouragement they have given me in the preparation of this book. The production team at Tauris have once again been outstanding, and I would like to thank in particular Alex Billington, Alex Middleton and Sara Magness. David Johnson’s highly informative electronic newsletter ‘Russia List’ has been of immeasurable help in keeping up with facts and opinions as the Ukrainian and Ukraine crises have unfolded, and I am most grateful for his courageous commitment to balance and circumjacence. Everyone involved in the study of this crisis has been criticised by one side or the other and occasionally both, and I have no xiii\n\nPreface\n\ndoubt this will continue. The temper of the times is angry and assertive (what I call ‘axiological’), but only a ‘dialogical’ approach can guarantee the scholarly commitment to hearing the arguments of all positions while holding strong views of our own. This book will undoubtedly rile many, yet only the expression of doubt and the posing of difficult questions will allow Europe to find a path to peace with itself and others. Richard Sakwa Canterbury, November 2014\n\nxiv\n\nC h a pt e r 1\n\nCo u n td ow n to Co n fro n tat i o n On the one hundredth anniversary of World War I and the seventy-fifth anniversary of the start of World War II, and 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Europe once again finds itself the cockpit of a great-power confrontation. How could Europe have allowed itself to end up in this position, after so many promises of ‘never again’? This is the worst imbroglio in Europe since the 1930s, with pompous dummies parroting glib phrases and the media in full war cry. Those calling for restraint, consideration and dialogue have not only been ignored but also abused, and calls for sanity have not only been marginalised but also delegitimated. It is as if the world has learned nothing from Europe’s terrible twentieth century.\n\nS h ad o w s o f w ar\n\nThe slew of books published to commemorate the start of the Great War reveals the uncanny similarities with the situation today. The war cost at least 40 million lives and broke the back of the continent, yet in certain respects was entirely unnecessary and could have been avoided with wiser leadership. If key decision makers had not become prisoners of the mental constructs that they themselves had allowed to be created, and if the warning signs in the structure of international politics had been acted on, then the catastrophe could have been averted. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 could well have remained a localised incident if Europe had not already been poised for conflict. Margaret MacMillan demonstrates in The War That Ended Peace that there were plenty of 1\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\ncontingent factors that precipitated conflict in summer 1914, but the structural factors had been created over the previous two decades.1 A febrile atmosphere of exaggerated moral indignation and ‘axiological’ truths predominated. By this term I refer to the assertion of what are purported to be unchallengeable (axiomatic) realities, not susceptible to debate or repudiation, a central feature also of the present crisis. Geoffrey Wawro’s A Mad Catastrophe exposes the reckless unfolding of the logic of conflict, while Sean McMeekin’s July 1914: Countdown to War is unsparing in its condemnation of all leaders and countries. Christopher Clark’s The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914, an updated version of Barbara Tuchman’s classic Guns of August, shows how none of the actors really wanted an all-out conflict but stumbled into hostilities that destroyed them all in one way or another.2 More specifically, Thomas Otte’s July Crisis: The World’s Descent into War, Summer 1914 shows how the century-old system of great-power politics collapsed in a matter of weeks. He asks ‘how and why the civilized world, seemingly so secure in its material and intellectual achievements, could have descended into a global conflict’.3 Social-Darwinist ideas rendered war a noble and cleansing ideal, but in the end it is the squalidity of the actual war and its catastrophic consequences that are remembered. This is a salutary warning to those who argue that the military-alliance system forged in the wake of World War II will endure into the twenty-first century, in conditions that have changed unrecognisably from those of the bipolar confrontation of the Cold War years from the late 1940s to 1989. The contemporary crisis, of which the Ukrainian events are only one of the most intense manifestations, is very much worse because of the peril of nuclear catastrophe hanging over humanity. Deterrence has averted a global war so far, but that is no guarantee that the recklessness that affected the ruling classes of Europe a century ago will not once again lead the sleepwalkers to war. The actual fighting in 1914 was only an epiphenomenon of a broader cultural and psychological readiness to engage in conflict. Germany had long been demonised in the British press, above all for its perceived challenge to British naval supremacy, while France was still smarting over the loss of Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The list could go on – just as it could today. The groundwork of the Ukrainian conflict has been latent for at least two decades. It was laid by the asymmetrical end of the Cold War, in which one side declared victory while the other was certainly not ready to ‘embrace defeat’.4 Unlike Germany and Japan in 1945, who acknowledged that they had been at fault and used the moment of destruction as the starting point of their transformation into Western-style liberal democracies, Russia did not in the least consider itself a defeated power.5 This did not prevent the alleged victors after the Cold War believing that the Soviet collapse 2\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nvindicated not only the institutions that had been created to wage the struggle but above all the ideology in whose name it had been fought. This gave rise to the triumphalism of the ‘end of history’, which effectively replaced one ideology with another, namely the belief in the inexorable advance of liberal democracy and the ‘European choice’. Marxist historicism was replaced by liberal historicism, the belief that the telos – or purpose – of history was knowable. This rendered all those who resisted (in the Russian case, not so much the substance of the ideas but the manner of their imposition) as not only mistaken but in some way fundamentally evil, thus closing down space for pragmatic debate, diplomacy or even common sense. This helps explain how Europe in 2014 has once again become the crucible of international conflict, harking back to an era that has so often been declared to be over. Today, Ukraine acts as the Balkans did in 1914, with numerous intersecting domestic conflicts that are amplified and internationalised as external actors exacerbate the country’s internal divisions. One of the central themes of this book is the idea that the Ukraine crisis has escalated because of the multiplicity of power centres, contested narratives and divergent understandings of the nature of the post-Cold War order. As outlined earlier, two fundamental processes have intersected to devastating effect: the ‘Ukrainian’ crisis has emerged out of the contradictions of the country’s nation- and state-building since independence in 1991, while the ‘Ukraine’ crisis is the sharpest manifestation of the instability of the post-Cold War international system.6 Here we will briefly outline both, beginning with the Ukraine crisis, with the arguments developed in later chapters.\n\nT h e U k rai n e crisis a n d pr o b l ems o f i n ter n ati o n a l o rder\n\nThe Ukraine crisis reflects the continuation in new forms of what used to be called the East–West conflict, the focus of the next chapter. After the end of the Cold War in 1989–91, as a result of Mikhail Gorbachev’s reform of the Soviet Union, which was based on the ideas of the ‘new political thinking’, no inclusive and equitable peace system was established. The Napoleonic Wars ended with the Congress of Vienna in 1815, when the victors came together to map the shape of a new Europe and established a peace system that effectively lasted until 1914, interrupted by the Crimean War of 1853–6 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1. World War I ended with the Paris Peace Conference, which resulted in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which imposed punitive conditions on what was taken to be a defeated Germany. Russia was not invited to attend at all, having defected from the Allies following the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917 and then having been wracked by civil war between 1918 and 1920. Germany’s refusal to accept the status of a defeated power 3\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nfuelled a powerful revisionist strain that helped propel Hitler to power in 1933. In other words, the way one war ends determines the shape of the next. There was no peace conference after the end of the Cold War, and instead an uneven peace was imposed on Europe. The Soviet Union disintegrated in December 1991, and Russia emerged as the ‘continuer state’, assuming the burdens, treaty obligations and nuclear responsibilities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). As far as Russia was concerned, the end of the Cold War had been a shared victory: everyone stood to gain from overcoming the end of the division of Europe, symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. The institutions of the Cold War in the East were dismantled, above all the Warsaw Treaty Organisation (the Warsaw Pact), but on the other side the institutions of the Cold War were extended. Above all, NATO, established in 1949, sought to find a new role, which it did by going ‘out of area’ (notably in Afghanistan) and enlarging to encompass a swath of former Soviet bloc countries. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined in March 1999, and then in a ‘big bang’ enlargement in March 2004 the Baltic republics (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia joined, followed by Albania and Croatia in April 2009. Despite repeated warnings by Russia that bringing NATO to its borders would be perceived as a strategic threat of the first order, the momentum of NATO enlargement continued. At the Bucharest NATO summit in April 2008 Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual membership: ‘NATO welcomes Ukraine’s and Georgia’s EuroAtlantic aspirations for membership in NATO. We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO.’ However, Membership Action Plans (MAPs) were deferred because of German and French concerns that encircling Russia would be unnecessarily provocative, especially since Gorbachev had apparently been promised that NATO would not advance to the east. From Russia’s perspective, there was no security vacuum that needed to be filled; from the West’s perspective, who was to deny the sovereign choice of the Central and Eastern European states if they wished to enter the world’s most successful multilateral security body? In the end, NATO’s existence became justified by the need to manage the security threats provoked by its enlargement. The former Warsaw Pact and Baltic states joined NATO to enhance their security, but the very act of doing so created a security dilemma for Russia that undermined the security of all. A security dilemma, according to Robert Jervis, is when a state takes measures to enhance its own security, but those measures will inevitably be seen as offensive rather than defensive by other states, who then undertake measures to increase their own security, and so on – in this case provoking the Ukraine crisis.7 This fateful geopolitical paradox – that NATO exists to manage the risks created by its existence – provoked a number of conflicts. The 4\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nRusso-Georgian war of August 2008 acted as the forewarning tremor of the major earthquake that has engulfed Europe in 2013–14. As Mikhail Margelov, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Federation Council, put it, noting the West’s surprise at ‘Russia’s firm stance on Ukraine, given that everything has been pointing in that direction for the last decade’: Since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, the West has failed to forsake the principle according to which only Western interests are legitimate. Nor has it learned the lesson of the events of August 2008, when Russia intervened in the war unleashed by the regime of Mikheil Saakashvili, in order to enforce peace in the region. The Georgian crisis should have made clear to everyone that Russia is not only ready to make its voice heard, but is also prepared to use force when its national interests are at stake.8\n\nThe unbalanced end of the Cold War generated a cycle of conflict that is far from over. An extended period of ‘cold peace’ settled over Russo-Western relations, although punctuated by attempts by both sides to escape the logic of renewed confrontation. This is what I call a mimetic cold war, which reproduces the practices of the Cold War without openly accepting the underlying competitive rationale.9 Structurally, a competitive dynamic was introduced into European international relations, despite the best intentions of both sides. At worst, the revanchists in the post-Communist countries of Eastern Europe, encouraged by neoconservatives in Washington and their vision of global transformation on a global scale, fed concerns about Russia’s alleged inherent predisposition towards despotism and imperialism. The Trotskyite roots of US neocon thinking are well known, and for them the world revolution was not cancelled but only transformed: the fight now was not for revolutionary socialism but for capitalist democracy – to make the world safe for the US. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy: by treating Russia as the enemy, in the end it was in danger of becoming one. NATO thus found a new role, which was remarkably similar to the one it had been set up to perform in the first place – to ‘contain’ Russia. Much of the discussion of the ‘Ukraine’ crisis externalises responsibility – in other words, it looks for a scapegoat. This book argues that the crisis has been generated by structural contradictions in the international system, but for the scapegoaters Russia is, quite simply, held responsible. The corollary is that the West needs to find an adequate response, which means only intensifying the contradictions that provoked the crisis. Thus Andrew Wilson argues that Russia’s alleged ‘covert ambition since 2004 to expand its influence within the Soviet periphery, and over countries that have since joined the EU and NATO, such as the Baltic states’, accompanied by ‘American inattention’, is the root cause of the crisis.10 This sort of analysis, predominant among 5\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nthe Orangists within Ukraine, is wrong-headed in conceptualisation and dangerous in its consequences. It deflects attention from the tensions within the Ukrainian state-building project by externalising responsibility for the country’s failures, and, by demonising Russia, forecloses opportunities for constructive engagement and the solution of common problems, most notably those facing Ukraine itself, but also at the European and global levels. The contrast with post-war Germany is stark, a country that was also ‘contained’, but within the framework of a set of institutions, above all the EU and NATO. Russia has effectively been left out in the cold since the end of the Cold War. There were serious attempts to mitigate the outsider effect, but in the end they were not enough to overcome the security dilemma. In the 1990s there was not much that Russia could do about the asymmetrical end of the Cold War, since it was economically weak and engaged in an intensive period of internal transformation as it became something approximating a market economy. Putin’s accession to the presidency in 2000 coincided with the beginning of an extended period of high prices for raw materials, above all for oil and gas, as China’s boom translated into an insatiable demand for materials to fuel its factories, allowing the West to deindustrialise and to take advantage of an extraordinary period of cheap consumer goods. The Western working classes, and with them the trade unions and other forms of mutuality, were marginalised, allowing corporate capitalism and the financial services to enjoy an extended boom on the back of cheap labour. Although marked by several periods of turbulence, the system thrived – until the great recession. Russia shared in the good years, enjoying annual growth of 7 per cent up to 2008. The state greatly increased its extractive capacities, with tax revenues rising on the back of the defeat of the oligarchic model of capitalism, notably through the ‘Yukos affair’ from 2003 that saw the Yukos oil company expropriated and transferred into the hands of state-owned Rosneft, while its head, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, spent a decade in jail.11 Putin himself stepped down in 2008 after the two terms allowed him by the constitution, and for four years the country was governed by the relatively liberal Dmitry Medvedev. The latter promised to revive the country’s democratic institutions, which had been increasingly suffocated by the system of ‘managed democracy’. Medvedev achieved only modest success, but he established an agenda for the reform of the Putinite system that remains active to this day. In the end it was perceived foreign-policy threats, notably the Western intervention in Libya in 2011, which ensured Putin’s return to the presidency in 2012. In the UN Security Council vote on 17 March 2011 to establish a no-fly zone, Russia abstained, allowing the Western powers to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi by the end of the year. This was another instance of the ‘regime change’ that alarmed Russia so much, and which already had 6\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nprovoked a ‘tightening of the screws’ internally in the mid-2000s, in response to the various ‘colour’ revolutions.12 The Putinite defeat of the oligarchs, accompanied by the humbling of the ‘barons’ in the regions and enormous energy rents, shifted Russia onto a very different path of development from Ukraine. Ukraine endured societal upheaval and political crisis every few years, while Russian stability provided space for economic growth and societal development, but at the price of the heavy-handed tutelage of Putin’s administrative regime. By the time Putin returned to the presidency in May 2012 Russia was much stronger, and ready to assert itself in world politics. What Ickes and Gaddy represent as the ‘missing quadrant’ was being filled in: a strong but ‘bad’ Russia, not the weak and good Russia of the 1990s, the weak and bad Russia presented by its critics, or the good and strong Russia extolled by its friends.13 Oil and other natural-resource rents filled Russian coffers and allowed the Putin administration to co-opt most societal interests. In the wake of the problems exposed by the Georgian war, the armed forces became the object of a grand programme of reform and re-equipping, and in April 2014 Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the military–industrial complex, announced that Russia would invest $560 billion in the coming years in modernising its army and navy, and $85 billion in modernising its defence plants. As will be detailed below, Russia under Putin presented itself as not so much anti-Western as a complement to the West, a type of ‘neo-revisionism’ that sought not to change the fundamentals of international order but to ensure that Russia and other ‘rising’ powers were treated as equals in that system.\n\nW h at is U k rai n e ?\n\nThe path to Ukrainian statehood has been exceptionally long and arduous.14 In the modern era the country has enjoyed only a brief period of statehood following the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917. At a time of revolution and civil war, a precarious independent state was established, but it was overthrown in 1919. With the victory of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin, the country was reconstituted as a federation. Ukraine was one of the founding nations of the USSR in December 1922, and following World War II was granted a seat in the UN (together with Belorussia), even though it was no more than a ‘union republic’ of the USSR. Throughout the vicissitudes of war, division and domination, the idea of Ukrainian nationhood was never extinguished, but it was balanced by commitment to the larger Soviet project, which brought with it industrialisation, urbanisation and the creation of a relatively modern and educated society. 7\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nTwo models of Ukrainian statehood, the monist and the pluralist, have long been in contention. They correspond to the long struggle in Ukrainian history between those who assert that the country is an autochthonous cultural and political unity in its own right, and those who believe that common ancestry in Kievan Rus, a loose federation of East Slavic tribes from the ninth to the thirteenth century ruled by the Rurik dynasty, means that they are part of the same cultural, and by implication, political community. The conversion to Orthodoxy in AD 988 by the Kievan Prince Vladimir the Great, moreover, endowed the modern Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian nations with a shared religion. However, the early Slav state was already fragmenting when the Mongol invasion of 1240 destroyed Kiev and separated the various peoples. Putin’s view that Russia and Ukraine are just two aspects of a single civilisation is widespread in Russia, whereas Ukrainian nationalists argue that their country long ago set out on its own developmental path (more on this later in this chapter). This tension has played out in manifold struggles and conflicts over the centuries. Notably, from the late eighteenth century Ukraine was often described as ‘Malorossiya’ (Little Russia), derived from Byzantine maps that referred to the territory as Lesser Rus or Rus Minor. Malorussianism views Ukraine as an emanation of the Greater Russian identity, and thus from the nineteenth century sought to standardise the country’s language to what had become the Russian Slavic norm. This was the view of Nikolai Gogol, who, although an ethnic Ukrainian, wrote in Russian. This is countered by the long tradition of Ukrainism, which argues that the Ukrainian version of the East Slavic language represents the emergence of a wholly distinct ethnic identity. The name ‘Ukraine’, like the term Malorossiya, derives from cartographical toponyms and is translated literally as ‘borderland’. Taras Shevchenko, who wrote mostly in Ukrainian, is the best exemplar of this tradition.15 In our era, Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a good example of someone who embodied the tension between monist and pluralist conceptions of Ukraine. In his powerful 1990 analysis, Rebuilding Russia, he argued: ‘We do not have the energy to run an Empire. Let us shrug it off ’; but when it came to Ukraine he advocated the creation of a ‘Russian union’ with Ukraine at its heart.16 For Ukrainists, the main challenge of independence is precisely to repudiate such thinking, to rid the country of the ‘imperial’ legacy and to carve out a wholly separate Ukrainian nation, whereas the Malorussian tradition represents an entirely different model of statehood, one that encompasses multiple civilisational experiences, languages and cultures, while respecting the Ukrainian inflection of all of these. The post-Communist struggle for democracy, good governance, economic transformation and civic dignity became entwined in this deep-rooted cultural conflict. 8\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nWinston Churchill once quipped that the Balkans produces more history than it can absorb, and in certain respects this is equally applicable to Ukraine. There is a surfeit of unresolved historical and national issues that remain scabrous and contested, and thus Ukraine has not yet reached the point where it can be considered to have passed Ernest Renan’s test, according to which a nation is made up as much by what is forgotten as that which is remembered. History is raw and alive. For example, the 2014 crisis has brought the notion of ‘Novorossiya’ (New Russia) back into popular discourse.17 Between 1764 and 1917, Novorossiya was a distinct administrative unit of the Russian Empire along the entire Black Sea coast from Transnistria in the west to Mariupol in the east, and to this day remains predominantly Russian-speaking. Equally, there are other historic entities, such as the old Sloboda Ukraine centred on Kharkov, and Zaporozhia focused on Dnepropetrovsk. Overarching this is the constant tension between Eastern and Western influences. As Andrew Wilson puts it: ‘Ukraine’s entire history could be written in terms of its oscillation between the two sides, with the Russians decisively surpassing the Poles in importance only in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.’18 Thus the present contest between ‘Europe’ and Russia is one that goes back centuries, and is a constituent element of Ukraine’s historical DNA (see Map 1). The modern stage of this conflict begins in 1991 with the break-up of the Soviet Union. Contrary to expectations, when the Soviet Union disintegrated it was Russia that led the way. Its Declaration of State Sovereignty on 12 June 1990 was followed on 16 June by that of Ukraine, which stressed the alliance-neutral status of the country. In the all-union referendum on transforming the Soviet Union into a confederation of sovereign republics of 17 March 1991, 70.5 per cent of Ukrainians voted in favour of retaining a renewed union, although in a second question inserted by the Ukrainian authorities, asking whether ‘Ukraine should be part of a Union of Sovereign States on the basis of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine’, 80.2 per cent also said yes. As in all revolutionary situations, time was compressed and events moved at a dizzying pace. The attempted coup of 18–21 August 1991 by a group of conservatives, hoping to undo the drift of reforms towards a more pluralist democracy and decentralised state, acted as the catalyst for the disintegration of the state they were hoping to save. The putsch swiftly unravelled, and in its wake Ukraine declared independence on 24 August. In the last months of 1991 Gorbachev frantically sought to save the union, but the overwhelming Ukrainian poll on 1 December, in which 90.3 per cent voted for Ukrainian independence, inflicted the death blow on the USSR. The traditionalists were discredited, and on the same day the Communist-turnednationalist Leonid Kravchuk was elected Ukraine’s first president with 63 per cent of the vote. On 7–8 December the leaders of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine met in the 9\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nBelavezha Pushcha in the country now known as Belarus and, as founding members of the original USSR, agreed to dissolve the union and establish the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The Soviet Union was dead, and 15 independent states now began their distinctive paths to modernity and nation statehood (see Map 3). Like many modern nation states, Ukraine is an agglomeration of territories, peoples and languages. The newly independent republic encompassed various territories and peoples that had at various points been part of neighbouring states, and comprised a society that had endured massive changes and traumas. When the Russian Empire collapsed in 1917 the population of Ukraine included 32.9 million Ukrainians (67.7 per cent), 5.4 million Russians (11.1 per cent) and 4.3 million Jews (8.8 per cent). The Soviet census of 1989 registered the changes on the eve of the Soviet collapse. Out of a total population of 51.7 million, 37.4 million (72 per cent) were Ukrainians and 11.4 million (22 per cent) were Russians, while the number of Jews had fallen tenfold to 486,628.19 The figures for the 2001 census found that there were 37,541,700 Ukrainians, constituting 77.8 per cent of the population, and 8.3 million Russians (17.3 per cent) (see Table 1.1). Ethnic Russians were distributed unevenly, being concentrated in the eastern and southern regions, comprising 39 per cent of Lugansk, 38.2 of Donetsk, 25.6 of Kharkov, 24.7 per cent of Zaporozhe and 20.7 of Odessa, while in the cities the proportion of Russians is even higher. There are even greater inter-regional disparities when it comes to language use. The 2001 census found that 67.5 per cent stated that their native language was Ukrainian, 29.6 per cent (including 14.8 per cent of ethnic Ukrainians) said it was Russian, and 2.9 per cent named other languages. Russian-speakers were concentrated in the south-east, with 90.6 per cent of people in Sevastopol claiming Russian as their native language, 77 per cent in Crimea, 74.9 per cent in the Donetsk region and 68.8 per cent in the Lugansk region, as well as making up about half the population in several other regions, while Kiev is a preponderantly Russian-speaking city. Surveys reveal that these figures underestimate the proportion of Russian-speakers, with between one-third and a half using Russian at home and in social and professional communication. Once again there are regional differences, with western Ukraine mostly using Ukrainian with some Surzhyk (a mix of Russian and Ukrainian in common use across central Ukraine) and Russian; people in the centre and some southern regions (Mykolaiv and Kherson) mostly speak Ukrainian, but with a large proportion using Surzhyk, with Russian predominating in the large cities, including Kiev; the Donbas (short for Donets Basin, comprising the Donetsk and Lugansk regions) and Crimea are overwhelmingly Russian-speaking; while the other eastern and southern regions of Ukraine are predominantly Russian-speaking, with the common use of Surzhyk and bilingualism.20 10\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nTable 1.1 Ukrainian population census 2001 population (thousands) Ukrainians\n\nAs % of the total 2001 1989\n\n2001 as % of 1989\n\n37541.7\n\n77.8\n\n72.7\n\n100.3\n\n8334.1\n\n17.3\n\n22.1\n\n73.4\n\nBelarusians\n\n275.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n62.7\n\nMoldavians\n\n258.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n79.7\n\nCrimean Tatars\n\n248.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n530\n\nBulgarians\n\n204.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n87.5\n\nHungarians\n\n156.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n96.0\n\nRomanians\n\n151.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n112.0\n\nPoles\n\n144.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n65.8\n\nJews\n\n103.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.9\n\n21.3\n\nArmenians\n\n99.9\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n180\n\nGreeks\n\n91.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n92.9\n\nTatars\n\n73.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n84.4\n\nGypsies\n\n47.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n99.3\n\nAzerbaijanis\n\n45.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n122.2\n\nGeorgians\n\n34.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n145.3\n\nGermans\n\n33.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n88.0\n\n31.9\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n99.9\n\n177.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n83.9\n\nRussians\n\nGagauzians Other TOTAL\n\n48052.3 Source: All-Ukrainian Population Census [website]. Available at http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/.\n\nContemporary Ukraine is the product of many changes (see Map 2). In the southeast the Donbas is the most industrialised. The city of Donetsk was founded in 1879 by the Welsh industrialist John Hughes, and is famous for its mines, oligarchs and football team (Shakhtar Donetsk). Already the 1897 tsarist census revealed that the majority in the Donbas identified themselves as ‘Malorussians’ (that is, Ukrainians), and were not simply Russians who adopted the Ukrainian ethnonym in the Soviet period.21 In other words, despite the extensive links with Russia and ethnic intermingling, the region had an identifiable sense of belonging to the Ukrainian community. This is balanced by the retention of intense historic links with Russia across the border, 11\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nreinforced by common experiences and patterns of economic interaction. The industrialisation of the region in the Soviet period drew in workers from across the USSR, and their detractors in western Ukraine insist that they retain a ‘sovok’ mentality, a dependence on the state and an orientation towards Russia. Nevertheless, opinion polls confirmed that before the war the population of the south-east identified as Ukrainians, but of a special sort. A 2005 Razumkov Centre survey, for example, found that 67 per cent of citizens in Ukraine’s east answered positively to the question ‘Do you consider yourself a patriot of the Ukraine?’ and other studies had similar findings. Separatism barely registered, and the majority considered the Ukrainian state their home, but there were deep-seated grievances – notably over the status of the Russian language in state and educational institutions – accompanied by hostility to NATO membership and geopolitical reorientation to the West. It was the failure to give constitutional form to this distinctiveness and the perception that the February 2014 revolution brought hostile forces to power that provoked the rebellion. In the west of Ukraine, at least three major regions can be identified. The area known as Galicia (currently the regions of Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk) formed part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, and thereafter was ruled by Poland in the interwar years. Western Ukraine only finally joined the Soviet Union in 1944, when taken from the Germans, but for 400 years it had been ruled by Poland and then Austro-Hungary. Lwów was seized by the Soviet Union in 1939 under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August, but two years later was occupied by the Germans (returning to Lemberg), until it was taken by the Red Army in 1944 and integrated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) – as Lvov – becoming Lviv at independence in 1991. The region considered the Russians as invaders and occupiers, deep sentiments that flourish to this day. This is presented as a ‘civilisational’ choice that transcends day-to-day politicking. Transcarpathia was part of the kingdom of Hungary for a thousand years, until 1919, when it was assigned to the newly created Czechoslovakia as punishment for Hungary’s role in the Great War. The region was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1945 and assigned to the Ukrainian SSR. In 1919 Lenin also assigned extensive territories to the east and south to what would become Ukrainian jurisdiction. However, it was Stalin who was the greatest Ukrainian state-builder, adding extensive territories to both the east and the west. In cultural terms, however, in the mid-1930s he reversed the cultural renaissance of the period of ‘Ukrainisation’ of the 1920s, when the policy of korenizatsiya (indigenisation) encouraged teaching and the publication of books in native languages. (For contemporary Ukrainian regions, see Map 4.) The Crimean peninsula is the heartland of Russian nationhood. It was here in Khersones that Prince Vladimir adopted Orthodoxy as the official religion of the 12\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\npeople of Rus. Following the Mongol invasion, the Crimean Khanate ruled the peninsula from 1441, whose territories at one point encompassed a large part of the northern Black Sea littoral. From 1736 Russia started its push to take over the region, prompted in particular by the desire to put an end to the raids on the Slavic parts to the north. Catherine the Great’s push against the Ottoman Empire saw Crimea occupied by Russian forces in 1783, and on 2 February 1784 it formally entered the Russian Empire as Taurida Oblast. In turn, the Tatar population now faced successive waves of deportation, including in response to the threat from Napoleon in 1812, when they were sent to Siberia, and then in 1855, towards the end of the Crimean War, when they were branded as enemy agents and tens of thousands were sent to Turkey. From the 1860s the imperial authorities launched a new wave of deportations, accompanied by attempts to Russify the northern Black Sea region. The worst deportation was Stalin’s, on 18–20 May 1944. The whole population, some 230,000, including 40,000 who had served with distinction in the Red Army, were sent to Siberia and Central Asia, with at least 100,000 expiring en route of hunger and thirst. They had been accused of collaboration with the Nazi occupiers, but given the purges of the 1930s, which had wiped out much of the Crimean Tatar elite, surprisingly few (some 2,000) joined ‘defence teams’ rather than be sent to work in Germany. Tatars now make up 13 per cent of the Crimean population, whereas before the Russian occupation of 1783 they comprised 80 per cent.22 In 1954 the region was transferred from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction, a decision that was contested from the first, above all because Russians made up the majority of the population. The 2001 census revealed that 1.45 million (57 per cent) out of a total population of 2 million claimed to be Russians, 576,000 Ukrainians and 245,000 Tatars, while some 77 per cent were registered as native Russian-speakers. It was the return of Crimea to Russia in March 2014 that transformed the Ukrainian crisis into a major European confrontation (see Chapter 5). The pattern of religious affiliation is equally complex. Some 68 per cent of Ukrainians identify themselves as Orthodox Christians, 7.6 as Greek Catholics (Uniates), 1.9 as Protestants and evangelicals, 0.9 as Muslims, and 13 per cent do not identify with any of the above faiths.23 The Uniates, who observe Orthodox rites but render allegiance to the Pope in Rome, are concentrated in the seven regions of western Ukraine, overwhelmingly in the Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions (Galicia). Orthodoxy itself split in 1989, when the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) once again took on a legal identity, and then in 1992 split away under the leadership of Metropolitan Filaret (who in June 1990 lost the battle to become Moscow Patriarch) to create the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kiev Patriarchate (UOC-KP), with Filaret becoming its Patriarch in October 1995. The 13\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nsplit provoked some undignified tussles over parishes, with about half remaining loyal to Moscow, especially in the Russophone regions, now registered as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP). In 2013–14 Filaret has been an enthusiastic supporter of the pro-European protesters, a stance that has put him at odds with the Moscow-oriented Church. There have been numerous incidents of pressure against Moscow-affiliated congregations following the revolution of February 2014. Although the Moscow Patriarch, Kirill, is often accused of being too close to the Putin regime, when it comes to Ukraine he has sought to steer a path towards reconciliation and dialogue. Thus the fundamental question facing the newly independent Ukrainian state in 1991 was to find an adequate political form in which to institutionalise and represent this diversity. Countries like Belgium and Canada have used federalism to provide a constitutional framework for diversity. Others, like Spain and the United Kingdom, remain unitary but have a great degree of quasi-federal devolution of powers. In the end, after a divisive debate, Article 2.2 of the 1996 constitution declared that Ukraine is a unitary state and that its territory is indivisible and inviolable. Ukraine is far from being the only country facing the problem of managing diversity, but the internal developmental impasse and the incipient new East–West division of Europe that runs across its historically diverse territories has made the task immeasurably more problematic.\n\nT w o m o de ls o f U k rai n ia n state h o o d\n\nI mentioned earlier that there are two contrasting visions of statehood, and ultimately the Ukrainian crisis of 2013–14 is a battle between the two. The first is monist nationalism, driven by the idea that after several centuries of stunted statehood the Ukrainian nation has had to seize the opportunity to join the front ranks of nation states. The Pereyaslavl treaty uniting Ukraine with Russia, signed by Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky in 1654, was to be undone, along with the succeeding centuries of Russianisation, which only in the late nineteenth century turned into a conscious programme of Russification. Ukrainisation entailed above all giving priority to the titular language as the single most important token of nationhood. This form of Ukrainian nationalism affirms the link between ethnicity and the state, although couched in the civic language of modern governance. The tension between nationalising ambitions and recognition that in fact Ukraine is a fragile ensemble of peoples and territories provoked exaggerated fears about the country’s cohesion. For this reason the Ukrainian nationalising elite insisted on creating a unitary state, fearing for the territorial 14\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nintegrity of the country. Thus the monist model is one of integrated nationalism, in which the state is a nationalising one, drawing on the tradition of Ukrainism to fill the existing borders with a content sharply distinguished from Russia. It would be officially monolingual, unitary and culturally specific. The monist vision of Ukrainian statehood draws in part on the ideas of Dmytro Dontsov, a Ukrainian nationalist writer whose radical ideas shaped the thinking of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), established in Vienna in 1929. Like so many of his generation, Dontsov was traumatised by the collapse of the government of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky, in which he served, in 1919. Ukraine’s failed attempt to establish its independent statehood in the period of revolution and civil war radicalised later thinking and influences policy to this day. In the interwar years Ukrainian-populated areas were divided between Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Bolshevik Russia. The Soviet part was granted the institutions of federal statehood, but like the other Soviet republics, this was overlain by the unitary power of what would become the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Dontsov wrote withering critiques of the failure of Ukraine to sustain its independence between 1917 and 1921, including severely personal attacks on the leading Ukrainian figures of that time. He repudiated the socialism of his youth and instead embraced a radical Ukrainian nationalism that excluded the possibility of consensus and cooperation with Russia. He proposed a new ‘nationalism of the deed’ and a united ‘national will’ in which violence played an essential part in overthrowing the old order. He excoriated the Russianism, Polonism or Austrianism of parts of Ukrainian society, and instead advocated the creation of a ‘new man’, who with ‘hot faith and stone heart’ would destroy Ukraine’s enemies. A national culture in his view was sacred and should be defended by all means necessary. Dontsov did not become a member of the OUN but his writings provided much of the inspiration for the movement, and he remains a revered figure today in the pantheon of integral Ukrainian nationalism.24 Liberalism, democracy and the lack of political will were held responsible for the failure to establish an independent Ukrainian state and encouraged a turn to fascism.25 Fascist ideas about national rebirth took deep root, and despite the inherent fractiousness and contradictions of the ideology, Ukrainian ultra-nationalism conforms to Roger Griffin’s definition of generic fascism: ‘bent on mobilising all “healthy” social and political energies to resist the onslaught of “decadence” so as to achieve the goal of national rebirth, a project that involves the regeneration (palingenesis) of both the political culture and the social and ethical cultures underpinning it’.26 While elitism, strong leadership, militaristic values and mass mobilisation are core elements, racism and anti-Semitism are not necessarily part of what Ernst Nolte calls the ‘fascist minimum’. 15\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nIn the early 1930s the OUN, headed by Andriy Melnik, led the resistance to Polish rule. In June 1933 Stepan Bandera became head of the OUN’s national executive in Galicia, territory that became part of Poland after the Great War. Bandera led a vicious campaign against Polish officials and policies. Released from a Polish jail in September 1939, he moved to Krakow, the capital of the German General Government of occupied Poland. Here the OUN split into a more conservative faction headed by Melnik (OUN-M) and a more radical wing headed by Bandera (OUN-B). By the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 Galicia for the first time became part of the Soviet Union. The peace lasted barely two years, and the German invasion of 22 June 1941 was at first welcomed by the Ukrainian nationalist movement, anticipating that Germany would re-establish some form of Ukrainian statehood. Bandera espoused a virulent form of integral nationalism, an exclusive and ethnically centred definition of the Ukrainian nation, accompanied by the murderous denigration of those who allegedly undermined this vision, notably Poles, Jews and Russians, the last of whom in his view were the worst. Bandera’s supporters argue that in fact he advocated an inclusive policy of nation-building, including Jews and others as long as they supported his goals. This is true to the degree that the participation of the OUN in the slaughter of Jews in the early period of German occupation was motivated less by virulent anti-Semitism than by the situational alliance with the Nazis.27 By late 1941 some of their violence was directed against the Germans. The OUN’s goal was the creation of an independent Ukrainian national state to unite ethnic Ukrainians, and they were willing to accept support from any source in pursuance of this goal. Zaitsev defines integral nationalism as a form of authoritarian nationalism that regards the nation as an organic whole and demands the unreserved subordination of the individual to the interests of his or her nation, which are placed above the interests of any other group, other nations, and humanity as a whole.28\n\nThe other side of the coin is the denial of the common historical path of Russia and Ukraine accompanied, in Dontsov’s words, by ‘unity with Europe, under all circumstances and at any price – that is the categorical imperative of our foreign policy’.29 All of this has deep resonance today, although of course intellectual filiation is never direct but a tangled skein of complex interactions. On 30 June 1941, in Lviv, Bandera announced the formation of the Ukrainian state, appointing his associate Yaroslav Stetsko as prime minister. The OUN fought with the Germans, committing atrocities against the Jews, Poles and Russians. Nazi Germany proved a fickle ally, and on 5 July Bandera and his colleagues were arrested 16\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nand they spent the rest of the war in German concentration camps. Bandera was taken to a special wing of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for political prisoners (Zellenbau), from where he was released in September 1944 when the Germans thought that he could once again prove useful against the advancing Soviet forces. Even without him the Banderites (Banderovtsy) organised the Ukrainian Waffen SS Nachtigall and Roland divisions that together with the Galicia division by some estimates were responsible for the deaths of some half a million people, typically attended by extreme brutality. The military wing of OUN-B, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Ukrayinska Povstanska Armiya, UPA), was organised in Volyn in 1943 to fight for an independent Ukraine after the war. In the first instance this entailed a radicalisation of the long-standing Polish–Ukrainian civil war. Beginning on ‘bloody Sunday’, 11 July 1943, the UPA slaughtered some 70,000 Poles, mainly women and children and some unarmed men, in Volyn, and by 1945 it had killed at least 130,000 in Eastern Galicia. Whole families had their eyes gouged out if suspected of being informers, before being hacked to death. After Ukraine was liberated by Soviet forces in summer 1944, the Ukrainian nationalist resistance movement (OUN-B and UPA) continued a partisan war against the Polish and Soviet authorities, apparently with British intelligence service (MI6) support, which lasted into 1949. Bandera himself was assassinated by the KGB in Munich in October 1959.30 When the Soviet Communist overlay disappeared in 1991, what had become a rather large Ukrainian proto-state gained independence. The Soviet institutions of governance were replaced by liberal-democratic forms, and the Soviet economy began the long transition to a market system. However, the traumas associated with the struggle for independent Ukrainian statehood remained etched in the national consciousness. In October 2007 the city of Lviv erected a statue in Bandera’s honour, and dozens of other cities in western Ukraine followed suit. As the leading scholar of right-wing extremism Andreas Umland puts it: ‘The OUN is a – if not the – major historical source of inspiration for all Ukrainophone nationalist parties, especially the more radical ones.’31 At the height of the protests on Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti, henceforth Maidan), the centre of Ukrainian civic life in the heart of Kiev, on 1 January 2014 a 15,000-strong torchlit procession celebrated his one hundred and fifth birthday, a march supported not only by the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party but also by Yulia Tymoshenko’s Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party. All of this was alien and incomprehensible to the large Russophone populations in the south-east, for whom the Soviet period was one of development and progress. It was also the time when the modern Ukrainian state was given its territorial shape by the Soviet Union, encompassing contested territories to the west and east, as well as Crimea in the south. 17\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nThe red and black UPA flag was once again displayed as the symbol of radical Ukrainian nationalism. Monist nationalism draws on a naturalistic, historicist and restitutive narrative of Ukrainian statehood, suggesting that Ukraine has finally come together naturally after the deviations and mistakes of history. As in some other post-Communist states, notably the Baltic republics, the model of state-building is restorative: the attempt to re-establish some lost ideal of what the new state and nation should look like. In the case of Estonia and Latvia, for example, the idea was to return to the pre-war republics, and thus only those who lived there at the time and their descendants gained the automatic right to citizenship. The tens of thousands of Russians who had arrived since to build the new industries and to serve in the armed forces, who now hoped to live out their pensionable years in peace in their homeland, had to win the right to citizenship through language and history tests. Ukrainian state-building also operated with an attenuated restorative model at its heart. Although all those living in Ukraine in 1991 automatically gained the right to citizenship, including many stationed there in the armed forces, the nationalising state was nevertheless biased towards the view that ultimately the society would have to be ‘Ukrainised’, above all through the monolingual imposition of Ukrainian. This view was incorporated, after intense debate, in the 1996 constitution.32 Article 10 was studious in its denigration of the status of Russian: ‘The state language in Ukraine is the Ukrainian language. […] in Ukraine the free development, use and protection of Russian, other languages of national minorities of Ukraine is guaranteed’. The comma after ‘Russian’ was particularly symbolic of the new priorities, as was lumping Russians together with other ‘national minorities’. The new state sought to create its attendant symbolism and myths, but there was no single national narrative. Indeed, much of the discussion over the last two decades has been about the weakness of Ukrainian ethno-nationalism and Ukrainisation, registered by Russophones more as an annoyance than a major impediment. Ukraine developed as a pluralistic community, in which Ukrainian in culture and the arts may actually have diminished. The deep cultural struggle continued, however, with contrasting mythologies, memory politics and calendars of secular saints used as the currency of political exchange. As with so many of the former Communist Eastern European states, nation-building was accompanied by a pronounced cult of victimhood, the seedbed for new conflicts. In particular, the Holodomor (meaning ‘hunger extermination’) was crucial for the nation’s self-identification. More than 2 million died in the famine of 1932–3 in the wake of Stalin’s vicious collectivisation campaign, which saw peasants uprooted from their land and the so-called kulaks (rich peasants) exiled to Siberia. Even as food production collapsed, exacerbated by a severe drought, the Soviet regime continued to export grain to buy machine tools and other equipment 18\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nto push forward the campaign of accelerated industrialisation. The famine affected the heartlands of Ukraine nationhood, and the Stalinist elite may well have sought to destroy the spirit of the nation; but the famine was not restricted to Ukraine alone, with millions more dying in the Kuban and the lower Volga. A further symbol of the Ukrainisers was Bandera, the leader of the OUN from the 1930s. The defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 did not bring peace to Galicia, and the Soviet forces fought a vicious war against the insurgent army of the Banderovtsy. After his death this strain of militant Ukrainian nationalism lived on in the emigration abroad, combined with a pronounced anti-Russian ideology. Stetsko took over the leadership of the Ukrainian government in exile following Bandera’s death in 1959, and led the organisation until his own death in 1986. Many leading Ukrainian nationalists were associated with the organisation, including Viktor Yushchenko, president from 2005 to 2010. The émigré movement inspired the creation of the Captive Nations Committee, which in 1959 persuaded the US Congress officially to acknowledge a Captive Nations Week. This recognised Nazi creations such as IdelUral and Cossackia as being captive, with Russia portrayed as the captor. Irrespective of their ideology, in this tradition Russia is viewed as inherently evil, and thus the fall of Communism did not make the slightest difference: Russian imperialism was considered oppressive before Communism and after.33 This feeds the irreconcilable anti-Russianism of part of the monist nationalist tradition, which has considerable resonance in Washington, impeding constructive and pragmatic relations between the two countries. Yushchenko’s second wife Kateryna, an American citizen, briefly headed the Captive Nations Committee, writing a famously anti-Russian letter to the Washington Times (no longer available online). Her career included working for the State Department and the White House during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, and after Ukrainian independence she was a co-founder and vice president of the US–Ukraine Foundation. Yushchenko was the first Ukrainian president to support the rehabilitation of the OUN and Bandera, its controversial leader. In one of his most divisive acts, on 22 January 2010 Yushchenko awarded Bandera the title of ‘Hero of Ukraine’, a move that was widely condemned, including by the European Parliament and the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Exactly a year later the new president, Viktor Yanukovych, officially annulled the award. A giant portrait of Bandera was positioned to the left of the stage (from the viewer’s perspective) during the Maidan protests, understandably alienating the Russophone population. The struggle for democracy and the ‘European choice’ was overlain by a radical nationalist mobilisation. Equally, Yushchenko made recognition of the genocidal nature of the Holodomor one of the central planks of his presidency. In 2006 the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) 19\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nadopted a resolution referring to the Holodomor as an ‘act of genocide against the Ukrainian people’. The move was bitterly divisive, with the prime minister, Yanukovych, and over 200 MPs from the east abstaining or not taking part in the vote. The next year Yushchenko sought to make Holodomor and Holocaust denial a criminal offence, although parliament did not vote on the bill. On assuming the presidency in 2010, Yanukovych told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) that the Holodomor was not genocide: ‘Recognising the Holodomor as an act of genocide, we think, will be incorrect, unjust. It was a tragedy, a common tragedy of the states that made up the Soviet Union.’ The implication was that the partisans who considered the Holodomor to be genocide were not only condemning the Stalinist regime, but also couching it in anti-Russian terms. Instead of a common disaster for all Soviet peoples, monists made it a uniquely Ukrainian tragedy. The question divided the western from the eastern part of the country and is yet another example of the ‘genocide wars’, which include the struggle over the recognition of the Armenian massacres in 1916 and 1988 as ‘genocides’.34 This was another divisive issue in the debate over the formulation of Ukrainian national identity. The model of integrated nationalism shares some of the concerns of the classic ideas of integral nationalism – the latter denoting the creation along fascist lines of a united people with a single language, culture and mythology – but it is important to stress the differences. Integrated nationalism is fundamentally oriented towards a civic model of state development and is tolerant of diversity and rights. There is little evidence that the civic rights of Russian-language-speakers were systemically abused, even at the height of the mobilisations in 2004 and 2014. As Kuzio argues, civic development and nationalism are not necessarily opposed and can complement each other.35 This is the fundamental argument long advanced by Michael Ignatieff, who distinguishes civic from ethnic nationalism. For him, nationalism can be a constructive force as it brings a people together to create the institutions of a modern representative state, but in extreme forms it can lead to a collective escape from reality in which the rhetoric of noble causes and tragic sacrifices in the name of some primordial entity inflicts agony on others and subverts civic idealism.36 The collapse of Tito’s socialist state in Yugoslavia in 1989–91 unleashed the demons of war and extreme nationalism, and the post-Communist phenomenon of ‘new nationalism’ is now evident in Ukraine. However, civic inclusion was partial and integrated nationalism could not find a formula to include the country’s diversity on a constitutional basis. Ukrainian was the sole state language, and thus all official documents, notices and signs were in that language alone. Not everyone could understand the state documents that they had to read and sign, and even at election time all the instructions are in Ukrainian alone. Such inconveniences and demonstrative assertion of Ukrainism provoked 20\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\na constant sense of resentment. Russian for the most part was not proscribed, but was rendered the language of private life. Ukrainian nationalists like to sneer that Russian is the ‘kitchen language’, not worthy of use in civic and professional life. In practice, even during the protests on the Maidan in 2004 and again in 2013–14, the predominant language was Russian. In addition, plenty of Russian-speakers endorse the nationalising model of state development, as do a certain quotient of ethnic Russians, but at the level of state development the problem remains. Identities are so mixed that the majority of the population comfortably live with multiple identities, yet this represents social adaptation and not the resolution of the political question at the constitutional level. The core of the problem is an ideological one. At the heart of the monist model, as noted, is a restitutive understanding of re-established statehood. In other words, the aim is not to reflect existing realities, above all the different histories of the territories making up contemporary Ukraine, but to restore some idealised vision of that statehood. As we have seen the model is also applied in Estonia and Latvia, where the post-Communist national elites gave automatic citizenship only to those with roots in the pre-war independent republics, while all the rest (overwhelmingly the Russians who had moved there in the post-war years) had to demonstrate their eligibility for citizenship, typically through a language test. Like all ideologies, the restitutive model seeks to impose an external pattern on reality. Not surprisingly, the model of restitutive nationalism could assume highly intolerant forms. At the extreme, it took on aspects of the integral nationalism espoused by the classic fascist movements of the twentieth century. This was the case with the militantly nationalist Svoboda party. Established as the Social–National Party of Ukraine (SNPU), an obvious reference to Hitler’s National Socialist Party, in Lviv in 1991 by Oleg Tyagnybok, Andriy Parubiy and others, the group was distinguished by ‘its openly revolutionary ultranationalism, its demands for the violent takeover of power in the country, and its willingness to blame Russia for all of Ukraine’s ills’. It was also the first party ‘to recruit Nazi skinheads and football hooligans’. 37 In 2004 the party changed its name to Svoboda, replaced its neo-Nazi Wolfsangel (Wolf ’s Hook) official symbol by a stylised trident (the emblem of Ukraine) consisting of three fingers, and Tyagnybok became sole leader (while Parubiy went on to join Yushchenko’s Our Ukraine). Until 2013 they were happily distributing Ukrainian versions of Nazi tracts. In a debate in 2012 about the Ukrainian-born American actress Mila Kunis a Svoboda spokesman, Igor Myroshnichenko, argued that she was not Ukrainian but a ‘Jewess’.38 Anti-Semitism was deeply embedded in the party, but the intensity of its Russophobia was far greater. Svoboda is allied with France’s Front National and the Italian neo-fascist group Fiamma Tricolore. 21\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nThe great recession from 2008 hit Ukraine with particular intensity, exacerbating social and political divisions, redounding to the advantage of right-wing populism. The more mainstream Batkivshchyna party also strongly reflects the monist Ukrainian nationalist aspiration of creating a culturally uniform Ukrainian-speaking nation, by contrast with the pluralist concept of Ukraine as culturally and linguistically diverse. A welter of radical nationalist parties made electoral advances, notably Svoboda. Viacheslav Likhachev rightly predicted ‘the final escape of right-wing extremism from the marginal niche that it occupied for the first twenty years of the political history of independent Ukraine’.39 In the 28 October 2012 parliamentary election Svoboda won 10.44 per cent in the proportional part of the vote, taking 25 list candidates to the Rada and another ten from single-mandate districts. Parliament became a rostrum ‘for the fight against Yids, Russkies, and other filth’.40 A resolution of the European Parliament at that time condemned the party as xenophobic, anti-Semitic and racist. The nationalising agenda could take both a civic and a more harshly accentuated, exclusivist nationalist form. This explains the paradox that even the Ukrainian nationalist parties, unlike their right-wing, populist counterparts in Western Europe, supported accession to the EU. For them, it was not so much the institutional and normative structures of the EU that were attractive, but the Wider European representation of political space. The enlargement of Wider Europe to the post-Soviet area and Ukraine meant pushing back Russian influence and limiting its geopolitical pretensions. In other words, for Svoboda and others of that ilk the EU came to be associated not with the normative values of human rights and good governance, and, above all, with the overcoming of the logic of conflict, but with the projection of Western European geopolitics, reinforced by the power of the Euro-Atlantic security community. The nationalists favour the EU not for its principles but because it embodies a set of interests that increasingly run counter to those of Russia. In other words, the exclusive and proprietary nature of ‘Wider Europe’ amplified the exclusivity of the integrated-nationalism project. The Russophobia of monist Ukrainian nationalism does not acknowledge that Russia was both victim and perpetrator. Russia still has to come to terms with its Stalinist past (just as Britain does with many remaining dark spots of colonialism), but one-sided condemnation by its former ‘fraternal nations’ in the USSR does not help, especially since each of these countries played their part in Bolshevik crimes. Three Soviet general secretaries came from mixed Russian–Ukrainian stock: Nikita Khrushchev – who was born on the Russian side close to what is now the Russo-Ukrainian border, grew up in the Donbas and spent most of his early career in Ukraine – is often perceived as a Ukrainian, especially since his wife, Nina 22\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nKukharchuk, was fully Ukrainian; Leonid Brezhnev, who became the party boss in Dnepropetrovsk, was born there and used it as his political base even when in Moscow; and Konstantin Chernenko, who came from a Russified Ukrainian family born in Siberia. Mikhail Gorbachev is half Ukrainian, as was his wife, Raisa Titarenko. The post-colonial model can shed some light on the tangled history of the two peoples, but the issue of competing identities runs far deeper. Even if one accepts that the Ukrainian nation has its own thousand-year history, distinct but complementary to the history of the Russian nation, the political question of the foundation of relations between the two countries still has to be resolved. The post-colonial model by definition emphasises the self-assertion of the former subaltern element, but this is only the other side of the coin to those who stress the ‘fraternal’ nature of the relationship between the two countries. One stresses separation, the other unity, whereas in fact ‘normal’ relations in the end will only be established through a combination of the two. This brings us to the second paradigm of Ukrainian state development, which I call the pluralist to denote its appeal to broad principles of national inclusiveness. At root, this model proposes that the post-Communist Ukrainian state is home to many disparate peoples, reflecting its long history of fragmented statehood and the way that its contemporary borders include territories with very different histories, but that they all share an orientation to a civic Ukrainian identity. The borders of Ukraine, as we have seen, have changed considerably over the years. In particular, the boundaries of the interwar Ukrainian SSR were very different to those of today. A path not taken is that represented by Vyacheslav Chornovil. He was one of the leaders of the ‘dissident’ movement in Soviet Ukraine, and then the most articulate of the leaders of the national-independence movement known as ‘Rukh’ in the final period of the Soviet Union. Rukh led the movement towards Ukrainian independence, but as with similar movements in Russia, it was quickly marginalised by more powerful players once independence was achieved. Chornovil fought passionately for the rebirth of Ukrainian nationhood, but he was sensitive to the pluralistic nature of the society. His vision of reborn Ukrainian statehood was inclusive and multidimensional, but it was overshadowed by the ‘nationalisers’ and partisans of a narrower monism. Chornovil spent the 1990s on the margins, but was set for a comeback when he was killed in a suspicious traffic accident in 1999. Chornovil’s ideas appealed to all segments of Ukrainian society while challenging the powerful ‘third force’ – the oligarchs. Chornovil remains a hero for those who believe that Ukraine can develop as a confident pluralistic society on good terms with all of its neighbours. 23\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nThus Valentin Yakushik argues that Ukraine is ‘bicivilisational’, with Ukrainians and Russians as equals in the state, together with a rich variety of other peoples, notably Ruthenians, Gagauzians, Hungarians, Jews, Romanians and Crimean Tatars.41 Nicolai Petro refers to the Russian-speaking population as ‘the Other Ukraine’, and stresses that the current tension goes back generations. It is fundamentally a dispute about who gets to define what it means to be Ukrainian. From this perspective Ukraine is not one culture but many; not simply a ‘cleft’ society, as Samuel Huntington put it in his infamous lecture ‘The Clash of Civilizations?’, but a richly diverse society.42 Equally, although the various Orthodox congregations are split, the tension was exacerbated by the myth-making of the nationalisers. For the pluralists multiple religious and linguistic orientations do not represent a danger to the state, as the nationalists would have it, but the opposite: the diversity contributes to a rich and multifaceted culture. This did not necessarily entail turning Ukraine into a federal state, but it did mean that it would have to evolve into some sort of ‘consociational’ entity in which the voice of its multiple identities was given some sort of legally defended constitutional status. The pluralist model argues that all the peoples making up contemporary Ukraine have an equal stake in the development of the country, and thus opposes the nationalising strain, although without repudiating some of its concerns. For example, few would deny the need for special programmes to reassert the centrality of the Ukrainian language, including ensuring that it is taught to all children and can hold its own in further and higher education, the professions and government. This would not necessarily exclude linguistic competency tests for civil servants to ensure that Ukrainian is not overwhelmed by Russian – but it does repudiate the idea that the new state should officially be monolingual. One of the great riches of Ukraine is precisely its diversity, and, as far as the pluralists are concerned, there is no reason why this should not be constitutionally entrenched. The very ‘borderness’ of the country adds to its complexity, not as a problem to be managed but as an endowment to be celebrated. Thus the pluralists condemn the nationalists for failing to find a political form in which this diversity could be embedded in an inclusive constitutional order. The tension between these two representations of Ukrainian state formation has a clearly delineated spatial dimension. The monist view is obviously stronger in the western part of the country, while the pluralist approach is stronger in the east and the south. There is also a cross-cutting temporal dimension, that is, different representations of the past and future. As well as calling for a pluralistic form of statehood, the south-east also appeals to neo-Soviet sentiments, recalling the good times of the Soviet period when jobs were plentiful, welfare (however minimal) was guaranteed 24\n\nCountdown to Confrontation\n\nand the borders between Russia and Ukraine were wide open, with numerous intermarriages and a genuine ‘Soviet’ people beginning to emerge. The change of regime in February 2014 thus played out against the background of already intense divisions. As a recent unequivocal study puts it: ‘the culture, language, and political thinking of western Ukraine have been imposed upon the rest of Ukraine’. The goal ostensibly is the unification of the country, but in fact the objective has been to put down and humiliate Ukraine’s Russianspeaking population. The radical nationalists of western Ukraine, for whom the rejection of Russia and its culture is an article of faith, intend to force the rest of the country to fit their narrow vision.43\n\nThis may be putting it rather strongly, but the division is real.\n\n25\n\nC h a pt e r 2\n\nT w o Eu r o p e s The struggle for the lands between Russia and Western Europe has endured for as long as the modern European state system has existed.1 For centuries Russia and Poland contested a territory with shifting boundaries and evolving identities. In our era Ukraine suffered inordinately from the clash between the two great totalitarian despotisms of our time, Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union. The larger region became what Timothy Snyder calls the ‘bloodlands’ (what are today the modern states of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and the Baltic states) in which some 14 million non-combatants were killed between 1933 and 1945, with Germany responsible for twice as many deaths as the USSR. Even before then, what Snyder calls ‘the Soviet famines’ in the early 1930s saw at least 3.3 million die of hunger in Ukraine and the Kuban as Stalin allowed whole peoples to perish.2 This catastrophe of almost unimaginable proportions affected Ukraine most deeply, and is today represented by nationalists as the Holodomor, the deliberate genocide of the Ukrainian people. As late as 1989 Melvin Croan identified the region as the seismic fault line across the continent.3 It remains so to this day. The Ukraine crisis has signalled the return of the Baltic–Black Sea conflict system, described as ‘the Intermarium’ by Vadim Tsymbursky. It is here that two visions of Europe come into contention: on the one side there is ‘Wider Europe’, with the EU at its heart but increasingly coterminous with the Euro-Atlantic security and political community; and on the other side there is the idea of ‘Greater Europe’, a vision of a continental Europe, stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok, that has multiple centres, including Brussels, Moscow and Ankara, but with a common purpose in overcoming the divisions that have traditionally plagued the continent. Two actual and potential orders in Europe interact and clash in Europe today, generating contestation in the borderlands. 26\n\nTwo Europes\n\nT h e t w o E ur o pes\n\nWider Europe is associated with the year 1989, when the Berlin Wall was torn down and geopolitical fluidity returned to European affairs. The Soviet ‘empire’ collapsed and the former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe once again gained autonomy and sovereignty. For most, joining Wider Europe was the natural choice. This is the model of Europe that is focused on Brussels, with concentric rings emanating from the Western European heartlands of European integration. European integration in the 1950s was inspired by two fundamental principles: of transcending the logic of conflict, above all between France and Germany, and of ensuring equitable well-being for the continent’s citizens. Since the signing of the Treaty of Rome by the six founding members of the European Economic Community on 25 March 1957, the association has grown to encompass 28 members, with the latest entrants coming from the former Communist part of the continent. As the Communist systems collapsed from autumn 1989 onwards, there was a fundamental consensus in countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic in favour of liberal democracy, market reform and, above all, the ‘return to Europe’. There were domestic debates, setbacks and contradictions, but overall political, social and geopolitical goals lined up. The accession wave of May 2004 included not only the Central and Eastern European states of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia, but also the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (together with the Republic of Cyprus and Malta). In 2007 Bulgaria and Romania joined, and in July 2013 Croatia. This was an exemplary manifestation of the ‘Wider Europe’ model of development, and it undoubtedly delivered substantial benefits to the countries concerned. No less important, there was no external resistance at this point to EU enlargement. On its own it posed no security threat to Russia, and it was only later, when allied with NATO enlargement and the aggressive promotion of Western democracy, that expansion encountered resistance. The idea of a ‘Greater Europe’ asserts a different model of European internal politics. Instead of concentric rings emanating from Brussels, weakening at the edges but nevertheless focused on a single centre, it posits a multipolar vision, with more than one centre and without a single ideological flavour. This is a pluralistic representation of European space, and draws on a long European tradition: the vision of pan-European unification. Plans for the integration of the continent have a long pedigree. Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi’s notion of ‘pan-Europa’ before the war, Gaullist ideas of a broader common European space from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Mikhail Gorbachev’s dream of a ‘Common European Home’ transcending the bloc politics of the Cold War era, Nicolas Sarkozy’s idea of establishing ‘an economic and 27\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nsecurity common area’ with the EU to create a new bloc ‘of 800 million people who share the same prosperity and security’,4 and the Valdai Club’s idea of a ‘Union of Europe’, are all moments giving voice to this aspiration. The symbolic date of the second model is 1991, the year in which the Communist system in the Soviet Union dissolved and the country disintegrated. The ‘project of 1991’ is broader than this, however, since it also denotes aspirations for democracy, constitutionalism and international integration in Russia and the other CIS countries. However, unlike the 1989 countries, those on the 1991 trajectory found that very little lined up: certainly, for Russia ‘democracy’ came to be associated not only with the chaos of the 1990s, the rise of the ‘robber baron’ oligarchs and an economic decline that surpassed anything endured by any country in the great depression of the 1930s, but above all with the loss of great-power status and international influence. The various aspirations were orthogonal to each other, provoking confusion over national identity and the country’s destiny. In Russia this ultimately provoked a remedial programme of state activism, the attempt led by Putin to rectify what were perceived to be the internal excesses of the 1990s and Russia’s external loss of status. At its extreme, the remedial programme in March 2014 took the form of the ‘restitution’ of Crimea to Russian jurisdiction, responding to what had long been the deepest sore in Russia’s representation of its territoriality and nationhood. The price to pay for the relatively peaceful and bloodless collapse of the Soviet Union was the entrenched position of the Soviet-era elites, officialdom and corporations. The vast security apparatus remained lodged in the post-Communist Russian body politic like a fish bone in the throat. The siloviki, those with a security service background or affiliation, had already under Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s emerged as a powerful counterweight to the oligarchs, and under Putin pushed for more repressive domestic policies and a more assertive foreign policy. Above all, the fundamental difference between 1989 and 1991 lies in contrasting geopolitical perspectives. Russia considers itself a ‘great power’ and an alternative, although not necessarily adversarial, civilisational and geopolitical pole in world politics. Thus Russia could not simply become part of the ‘Wider Europe’ focused on the EU, let alone slip easily into the Euro-Atlantic security community. It did attempt to join both, but its size, awkwardness, autonomy and aspirations to great-power status prevented any easy integration. Instead, the Greater European idea represented a way of negotiating what in the best of circumstances would have been a complex and difficult relationship. The anti-Communist revolutions of 1989 drew their inspiration and reference points from developments in the West, notably the EU and ultimately NATO. Russia had no such clear direction, with membership of NATO excluded almost by definition 28\n\nTwo Europes\n\nby its own conflicted identity and Western fears of diluting the Euro-Atlantic alliance. Even relations with the EU soured as the Wider and Greater European agendas clashed. Russia was on a different track to the Eastern European states. If the goals were clear for the 1989 countries, in the 1991 countries the Soviet legacy is far deeper and the desired model of social and political organisation far more contested. After over two decades of ‘transition’ and reform, at least 11 out of the 15 countries emerging out of the USSR are authoritarian to one degree or another, including Russia. Even Estonia and Latvia, now members of NATO and the EU, can be charged with serious violations of civic rights as well as tolerating right-wing movements that verge on the fascistic. The tortured history of multiple occupations during World War II, each brutal but in a different way, has prompted virulent ‘memory wars’ today, as each side seeks to impose its own version of the dominant national narrative. These memory wars are one of the central issues that divide Ukraine, reflecting the different historical experiences of various parts of the country. As Russia’s estrangement from Wider Europe intensified, it placed ever-greater emphasis on the Greater European idea. As Yeltsin put it, ‘Europe without Russia is not Europe at all. Only with Russia can it be a Greater Europe, with no possible equal anywhere on the globe.’5 In other words, Russia was a vast and relatively underdeveloped country rich in natural endowments, while Western Europe had advanced technologies but needed energy and other resources. The two complemented each other, but no political form could be found to encompass the two halves of the continent. While the Russian leadership expended considerable effort to devise a new ‘architecture’ for a united Europe, the other countries saw no need for new ideas since, as far as they were concerned, ‘Wider Europe’ was a perfectly viable model, complemented not by Russia but by the US. Among the Greater European plans mooted by Russia was the idea of a new European Security Treaty, announced by Medvedev in a speech in Berlin on 5 June 2008, which called for the creation of a genuinely inclusive security system to ensure that new dividing lines were not drawn across the continent. The initiative was greeted with polite contempt by the Western powers, although the ‘Corfu process’ was established to assess the proposal. In keeping with his original strong European leanings, in a speech in Berlin on 26 November 2010 Putin called for the geopolitical unification of all of ‘Greater Europe’ from Lisbon to Vladivostok, to create a genuine ‘strategic partnership’.6 Eurasian integration was the big project of Putin’s third term, but he insisted that the planned Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) was not an alternative but a complement to European integration.7 Rather surprisingly, given the crisis in Ukraine and the souring of relations with the EU, Putin returned to the idea of creating a free-trade zone from the Atlantic to the Pacific at the Russo-EU summit 29\n\nfrontline Ukraine\n\nin Brussels on 28 January 2014.8 Despite the Ukraine crisis, the Greater European cooperative path of development is not dead. Russia’s Greater European initiatives were typically seen in the West as being little more than a cover for the establishment of a ‘Greater Russia’ by stealth. The Atlantic community is intensely vigilant against attempts to ‘drive a wedge’ between its two wings, North America and Western Europe, and it has been so since various Soviet plans for European security were advanced by Khrushchev in the 1950s. This Cold War view prevails to this day, with the constant fear that any idea emanating outside the NATO system is potentially divisive and dangerous. This also includes a deep ambivalence about the EU taking greater control of its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). This has resulted in the effective ‘militarisation’ of the EU; in the sense that enlargement has become part of the broader process of the expansion of the Euro-Atlantic community, in which security, good governance and economic reform go hand in hand. In other words, EU enlargement paves the way to NATO membership. For historical reasons a number of EU countries are not members of NATO – Austria, Ireland, Finland and Sweden – but even thi"
