The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.\n\nRe: [Eurasia] FW: INSIGHT - UKRAINE - Assessment since Election - Part IV: FSB-SBU marriage\n\nReleased on 2013-04-20 00:00 GMT\n\nEmail-ID 5468830 Date 2010-07-26 19:14:24 From goodrich@stratfor.com To ct@stratfor.com, eurasia@stratfor.com\n\nRe: [Eurasia] FW: INSIGHT - UKRAINE - Assessment since Election -\n\nPart IV: FSB-SBU marriage\n\nOh yea...

Still, we should write on this.\n\nFrom: analysts-bounces@stratfor.com\n\n[mailto:analysts-bounces@stratfor.com] On Behalf Of Antonia Colibasanu\n\nSent: Monday, July 26, 2010 9:11 AM\n\nTo: Analyst List\n\nSubject: INSIGHT - UKRAINE - Assessment since Election - Part IV:\n\nFSB-SBU marriage\n\nCODE: UA111\n\nPUBLICATION: yes\n\nATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR sources in Kiev\n\nSOURCE DESCRIPTION: A Romanian diplomat in Kiev\n\nSOURCE RELIABILITY: B\n\nITEM CREDIBILITY: 2\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Analysts\n\nHANDLER: Lauren\n\nINTERNAL SECURITY\n\nThe SBU's priorities are evolving rapidly since the election and are a\n\ngood indicator of the latest thinking in Kiev. The most spectacular -\n\nand the one which had the greater consequences in operational terms for\n\nWestern intelligence services - was the reorientation, in the literal\n\nsense\n\nof the term, of the organisation itself. Meaning a full reconciliation\n\nbetween Russia and Ukraine's services.\n\nThe reconciliation took place on May 19 in Odessa at a meeting between\n\nValery Khoroshkovsky and Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB (Russian\n\nFederation internal intelligence service). The latter's officers will\n\nagain be authorised to work in Sebastapol to protect Russia's Black Sea\n\nfleet from Western operations. Sources in Kiev indicate too that\n\ninstructions have been\n\ngiven to ease the counter-espionage effort against the FSB, the GRU and\n\nthe SVR on Ukrainian\n\nterritory.\n\nThe top counter-espionage department, which had been focused on Russia,\n\nhas switched its attention to the United States, which, along with MI6,\n\nis now the principal target.\n\nThis movement by the SBU towards its Slav \"big brother\" has been marked\n\nby chance or otherwise by a return to KGB-inspired methods, which I have\n\nheard reports that Valery Khoroshkovsky, who is not from the\n\nintelligence milieu, is following closely via long, almost daily\n\nbriefings.\n\nA recent episode in Lviv attracted particular attention. A local SBU\n\nagent had no qualms about asking Boris Gudzyak, rector of the local\n\nCatholic university, to report to him any students likely to participate\n\nin antigovernment actions. That the principal interested party made the\n\naffair public\n\nis reassuring for Ukraine's democratic reflexes. But that the SBU agent\n\ntook such an initiative recalls that old habits, even 20 years after the\n\ncollapse of the USSR and the disappearance\n\nof the KGB, come back quickly.\n\nIn March, the new head of state dismissed the head of the\n\ncounter-espionnage and internal\n\nintelligence service, the SBU. Valentin Nalivaychenko was close to\n\nformer president Viktor Yushchenko. He has been replaced by one of his\n\ndeputies, 44-year-old Valery Khoroshkovsky,\n\nwho already has several careers behind him. Propelled by Viktor Pinchuk,\n\nson-in-law of former president Leonid Kuchma, he was appointed minister\n\nof the economy and European\n\nintegration in November 2002. He left Yanukovich's government in\n\nJanuary 2004 because of differences with the then government number\n\ntwo...a certain Nikolay Azarov. In the middle of the Orange Revolution,\n\nhe left Ukraine for Russia,where he was appointed number two in the\n\nEvraz metals group, of which he was later to become chairman. He\n\nreturned to Kiev at the end of 2006. First, he was first deputy to the\n\ndirector of the national security and defence council, he was named head\n\nof the customs service in December 2007, then number two at the\n\nSBU in January 2009. He is also close to Dmitry Firtash, who is close\n\nwith the Russian leadership, and with Valery Khoroshkovsky is known for\n\nhis hostility towards former prime\n\nminister Yulia Timoshenko, something which won him favour with the two\n\nViktors - Yushchenko and Yanukovich.\n\nHis appointment as head of the SBU coincided with major changes in the\n\nSBU hierarchy, both at its Volodymyrska Street headquarters in Kiev and\n\nat the head of its regional branches.\n\nContrarily to the general expectation, these appointments do not appear\n\nto be particularly political and have been unanimously accepted within\n\nthe intelligence community, as well\n\nas among the former generals who were close to the outgoing regime.\n\nAmong Khoroshkovsky's deputies, it is worth noting the presence of\n\nVladimir Rokitsky who has become head of\n\nthe service combating corruption and organised criminality. More\n\nsurprising was the appointment of Andrey Kmita as head of protection of\n\nthe state's economic assets. Like\n\nmany representatives of the new regime, he spent part of his career in\n\nDonetsk but, in his case, it was after the Orange Revolution and with\n\nthe task of harassing the local oligarchs. Boris Kolesnikov, deputy\n\nprime minister in charge of organisation of the Euro 2012 football\n\ntournament and right hand man of Rinat Akhmetov, let it be known that he\n\nfound this\n\nappointment incomprehensible.\n\nApart from the SBU, which is by far the biggest Ukrainian intelligence\n\nservice, Yakunovich is also giving attention to the GRU and SVR. In\n\nmid-June he had fired GRU director General Viktor Gvozd. His replacement\n\nis not yet decided but it is likely to be someone close to new defence\n\nminister Admiral Mikhail Ezhel. Finally, on June 18, Yanukovich\n\nappointed a new\n\ndirector at the SVR. Grigory Ilyashov is a deputy of the Regions party\n\nwhose wife, Yelena Lukash is one of the top figures in the presidential\n\nadministration. He holds the rank of major general and, in 1990, took a\n\ntraining course at the KGB institute in Novisobirsk, which suggests that\n\nhe was considered by the KGB a promising prospect and loyal to Moscow.\n\n--\n\nLauren Goodrich\n\nDirector of Analysis\n\nSenior Eurasia Analyst\n\nStratfor\n\nT: 512.744.4311\n\nF: 512.744.4334\n\nlauren.goodrich@stratfor.com\n\nwww.stratfor.com\n\n--\n\nLauren Goodrich\n\nDirector of Analysis\n\nSenior Eurasia Analyst\n\nStratfor\n\nT: 512.744.4311\n\nF: 512.744.4334\n\nlauren.goodrich@stratfor.com\n\nwww.stratfor.com"
