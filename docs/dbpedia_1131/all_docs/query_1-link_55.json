        "text": "Ukraine’s transition from Soviet republic to fully democratic state has been inhibited by these cycles. It is yet to be determined whether Ukraine’s democratic development has been set on a sustainable path in the wake of the 2014 Euromaidan, the process of closer political and economic association with the European Union (EU), and the war in Donbas. There are many reasons to hope this is now the case, but there is also cause for serious concern about the sustainability of current reform efforts and democratic politics.\n\nWritten from the dual perspective of a political philosopher and social analyst, this book is a rich—in many ways, indispensable— source of conceptual information about Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the European Union, and global modernity. Its primary subject is the dirty, hybrid politics of Eastern Europe but even more so, its human substance—those traumatized, depressed and awkward but intrepid, entrepreneurial, and ultimately optimistic women and men whom Mikhail Minakov aptly calls “Post-Soviet Homo Politicus.” Relying on critical theory as summarized by Jurgen Habermas, Minakov illuminates the situation of the “double colonization,” in which the social System ceaselessly formalizes and therefore undermines the human Lifeworld, and the Lifeworld damages the System’s order, creating a chaotic cultural world that resembles “systemic corruption” to outsiders.\n\nThe seminar introduces students to the major issues of Ukrainian nationalism and national identity. What does it mean to be Ukrainian and what are the major variations of Ukrainian identity? What are the origins of the regional split in Ukrainian politics? Was Ukraine a colony under Russian Empire and the Soviet Union? Why are the memories about the massive violence in the first half of XX century divergent in Ukraine? Why is the issue of Russian language presence in the public sphere so politically contentious in Ukraine? How post-Soviet political regime in Ukraine has been perceived by Ukrainian nationalists? What do Euromaidan uprising in 2013-14 and the following war in eastern Ukraine have to do with Ukrainian national identity split and what impact did they have on it? Has Ukrainian nationalism become more civic, unifying and inclusive since 2014? These key issues have not only been recurrent in political discussions within Ukraine but have become important for the recent escalation of geopolitical conflict between US, EU, and Russia about Ukraine. We will discuss these questions in depth with a focus on their diverging interpretations by various groups within Ukrainian society as well as by various kinds of Ukrainian nationalists. The course will be of interest for the student who would like to deepen their knowledge of Ukrainian contemporary politics, history, and culture as well as interested in the international relations around “Ukraine crisis” since 2014.\n\nDuring and after Ukraine’s celebrated Euromaydan (literally: European Square) Revolution of 2013–2014, a whole number of novel Ukrainian political and societal phenomena emerged. One of the most intriguing was the relatively spontaneous and government-supported emergence of volunteer armed units from late spring 2014 onwards, in connection with the start of Russia’s covert paramilitary intervention in Eastern Ukraine. Among the most widely noted of these initially irregular detachments was the “Azov” battalion or regiment, named after the Azov Sea, created, in May 2014, by an obscure lunatic fringe group of racist activists. This paper briefly sketches the origins of Azov, biographies of some of its founders, and particulars of its creation, without touching upon such issues as Azov’s military performance, later integration into the National Guard under Ukraine’s Ministry of Interior, and political development after 2014.\n\nUkraine was established as a sovereign, pluralist and relatively free state within the framework of the post-Soviet 'third wave' of democratisation. Even with the strong impact of Europeanisation, Ukraine's political development was much more diverse than Western-oriented democratisation models, being also strongly influenced by informal power groups and competitive autocratic tendencies. In 2014, Euromaidan provided a revolutionary opportunity for fast liberal democratic reforms, but war, economic hardships, corruption, and divisive identity policies exhausted the post-revolutionary regime's support by 2019. Steps toward a stronger European-style democracy and rule of law were derailed by illiberal and autocratic processes. Since then the Zelenskyy regime has exhibited some signs of reverse Europeanisation, but without deflecting the main course of Ukraine's European orientation. While Ukrainian citizens predominantly respect key democratic values, this respect is not necessarily followed by post-Euromaidan governmental policies and political practice either under president Poroshenko, or under president Zelenskyy. Europeanisation has been important for the development of democracy in Ukraine, and the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement added to the internal impulse for democratic reforms and to limit autocratic tendencies.\n\nAs I strive to show in this chapter, “progressive” Ukrainian media contributed to the tragic post-Maidan developments in the East of Ukraine by adopting the Jacobin practice of marginalising and silencing opponents in the name of progress. By presenting the anti-Maidan movement as an absolute that was outside of the Ukrainian social order, they created the conditions of totalitarian intolerance emerging from the terrain of democratic revolution. As a result, antidemocratic and totalitarian tendencies in post-Yanukovych Ukraine not only reemerged but were even facilitated—a paradoxical outcome for a progressive revolution waged in the name of democracy.\n\nThe research explores Russian-Ukrainian crisis 2014 in order to see (i) how it has impacted Ukrainian identity split between pro-Western and pro-Russian supporters and (ii) the situation with the process of democratic consolidation in Ukraine. The first research question uses data from public surveys and results of presidential and parliamentary elections 2014 and local elections 2015 in order to demonstrate that Ukrainian national identity has become more consolidated in its commitment to integration with the European Union. At the same time, there has been a significant rise of negative attitude towards Russia even in previously pro-Russian regions. The second research question is concerned with the democratic consolidation in Ukraine and whether resolution of pro-Russian vs. pro-Western identity conflict has resulted in enhanced democracy. In order to assess democratic consolidation in Ukraine the research looks at two main indicators post-crisis political party system and public support of democracy. From the analysis of second research question it can be concluded that democratic consolidation has been facing serious impediments in Ukraine and neither Ukrainian political party system nor political elites can be considered as sources of further consolidation of new regime. Public support of democracy has also slightly wavered by 2016 due to tough economic situation, non-decreasing corruption and lack of trust in politicians."
