        "text": "Born in Transylvania in March 1990 and raised in the United Arab Emirates, he graduated in Industrial Design at the Istituto Europeo di Design (Milan) in 2011. His thesis was awarded an Honorable Mention at the 23rd Compasso d'Oro (Targa Giovani). After this experience, he continued his university studies and graduated in a Master of Strategic Design at IED in 2012. After graduation, he began a collaboration, with the Michelin starred chef Davide Oldani. In 2013, the 3M company offered him the opportunity to enrich his cultural background in the Milan Design Lab. All these experiences led him to participate and win the first edition of the BMW Creative Lab, held in 2013. The coveted award gave him the opportunity to join BMW in Munich, and to work with a multidisciplinary team dedicated to creative projects related to the future of mobility. A brief work experience follows for Guzzini, both inside the company in Italy and in the USA, Japan, France and Germany, with the aim of developing new projects. His skills allow him to work in multiple fields of the design industry, creating important synergies between brands and the use of the product itself. In 2015, he opened his studio in Milan and has since collaborated with some of the most important brands in the sector. He is currently a design consultant for different international brands, dividing his time between product and strategic design. Since his return to Milan he has been a professor of Product Design at the Istituto Europeo di Design.\n\nBIG is a group of architects, designers and thinkers operating within the fields of architecture, urbanism, research and development with offices in Copenhagen and New York City. BIG has A reputation for completing buildings that are as programmatically and technically innovative as they are cost and resource conscious. BIG’s recently completed projects including the Danish Maritime Museum (2013), Superkilen (2012), the 8 House (2010). BIG’s first project was in the Copenhagen Harbor Bath (2003), an urban space that transformed the area of Islands Brygge from a rundown harborfront to the recreational and social center of the city. Current projects under construction include: West 57th, a 750-unit residential building in Manhattan; the Vancouver House tower in Vancouver; the LEGO Brand House in Denmark; the Faroe Islands Education Center; the Shenzhen Energy Mansion in China; and a Wasteto-Energy plant in Copenhagen that will double as a ski slope.\n\nArchitect, designer and above all humanist, Carlotta de Bevilacqua has been a force in contemporary lighting since the 1980’s. A pioneer in LED research and implementation, she created the concept “The Human Light” in which lighting encourages not only the well-being of those who live, work and interact with it, but also the planet. As interested in science of light as the sensory experience, de Bevilacqua seeks to create synergy between products and users through accessible, experimental design. A life-force at Artemide for nearly 4 decades, in addition to her own studio she oversees Danese Milano creating minimal, yet elegant, products which further complement the built environment. In addition to widespread recognition for her work, in 2011, she received a Red Dot Design Award for the Algoritmo and Copernico.\n\nDavide Oldani, the creator of Cucina POP - high quality and accessibility - opened his restaurant D'O, in 2003, in his hometown of Cornaredo, near Milan. One year after opening, the world's most authoritative food guides counted him amongst the greatest chefs of contemporary Italian cuisine. Prior to opening D'O, he worked with Gualtiero Marchesi, Albert Roux, Alain Ducasse and Pierre Hermé. In December 2008,Davide Oldani was awarded the Ambrogino d'Oro by the City of Milan. In November 2013 he was invited to Harvard Business School to share his experience as an entrepreneur following a case history about his restaurant which was published in the Harvard Business School Review: the economics professors at the university defined his approach and his organization applicable to many different sectors, not only to restaurants. In March 2015 Davide Oldani will hold a lesson at the University of Business in Paris HEC. May 2014 saw the opening of Davide Oldani Cafè - in the new luxury Piazza at Malpensa Airport, Milan. He has been named Ambassador Expo 2015 and in the same year he took part as speaker at the World Business Forum in Milan In 2016 he inaugurated a restaurant in Manila, and opened his new D’O at Cornaredo*, an evolution of the previous one, where he will be able to create “greater” cuisine, able to be measured against the other cuisines of our country and not only. In the summer of the same year he has been named Food & Sport Ambassador by CONI and selected as chef of Casa Italia for the Olympics Game in Rio de Janeiro. His activity as a designer is born from keen observation of his guests and their habits. Tables, chairs, dishes, tableware and glassware are inspired by the POP cuisine philosophy: simple, functional, elegant.\n\nDavide Oppizzi founded the agency DCUBE.swiss in Geneva in 2001. He specializes in the creation and development of high quality projects related to lighting, greentech and architecture. Light and matter: the constant quest for pure and authentic lines, those that raise the object to a level of timeless aesthetic refinement that is both exclusive and functional, Davide Oppizzi is specialised in the art of lighting, the only way, in his words, to sublimate the matter he works in. Davide Oppizzi’s imagination, his emotional vision of the tangible and intangible world, as well as his expertise in niche areas has brought him to the forefront of the international scene. Global prestige brands such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton or Graff have entrusted him with projects that illustrate the profound link between a being and the surrounding nature, the nature that feeds their inspiration at all times. Davide Oppizzi possesses rare and unique mastery of two worlds that appear paradoxical at first: technology and creative sensitivity.\n\nGiulio Iacchetti’s work focuses on research and definition of new object typologies, such as the disposable “Moscardino” spoon-fork he designed with Matteo Ragni. Iacchetti has been working as an industrial designer since 1992, collaborating with brands such as Alessi, Danese, Moleskine, and Pandora design. In 2009 he was awarded the “Premio dei Premi” prize for innovation, presented by the President of the Italian Republic, for the Coop Eureka project, which introduced design into the large-scale retail trade. In 2012 he launched Internoitaliano, a “factory network” made up of labs across Italy with whom he designs and produces furniture and accessories inspired by the Italian way of living.\n\nMario Cucinella is the founder of Mario Cucinella Architects. With over 20 years of professional practice, MC A has developed a great experience in architectural design, with particular attention to the issues of sustainability and the environmental impact of buildings. Its production has generated numerous recognized projects from product design, to buildings, to urban masterplans. In 2015 he established in Bologna S.O.S. - School of Sustainability, a post-master program aimed at training new professionals in the field of sustainable design. The impact and importance of his work, both from an environmental and social point of view, as an architect and educator, has been recognized with the Honorary Fellowship of the American Institute of Architects (2017) and with the International Fellowship del Royal Institute of British Architects (2016).\n\nTapio Rosenius is the founder and design director of the Lighting Design Collective (LDC). The company is based in three studios in Europe (Madrid, London & Helsinki) and operates globally with a network of collaborators from Miami to Mexico to Hong Kong. LDC specializes in customized architectural lighting solutions and light art with a uniquely integrated portfolio. LDC also creates cutting-edge services such as digital content creation, software development and design strategies. Originally from Finland, Rosenius is a designer and artist whose work has been recognized by numerous awards around the globe in the fields of lighting design, architecture and art. Rosenius holds a Master of Science in Light & Lighting from UCL Bartlett University in London and a Medianomi in Lighting Design from the Tampere School of Arts & Communication in Finland.
