        "text": "Emmanuel, count de las Cases (born June 21, 1766, Languedoc, France—died May 15, 1842, Passy) was a French historian best known as the recorder of Napoleon’s last conversations on St. Helena. The publication of these conversations contributed greatly to the Napoleonic legend in Europe.\n\nAn officer of the royal navy, Las Cases in 1790 emigrated from France to England, where he wrote and published his Atlas Historique . . . (1802), a work that attracted Napoleon’s attention. Consequently, on his return to France (1809) with other Royalists rallying to Napoleon, Las Cases was given a minor position on the council of state and created count in 1810. After Napoleon’s defeat (1814), he returned to England but joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days (1815), following him into exile at St. Helena. For 18 months he recorded his conversations with Napoleon on his principles of warfare, his identification of the French Revolution with the Empire, his political philosophy, and his sentiments on religion and philosophy. A letter of complaint about Napoleon’s treatment led to Las Cases’ deportation and to the seizure of his manuscript by the British government. Forbidden to enter England, he traveled in Germany and Belgium until he was allowed to return to France after the death of Napoleon in 1822. Recovering his manuscript, he published his Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène (1823), which at once became extremely popular. A deputy for Saint-Denis (1831–34; 1835–39), he sat with the extreme left, opposing the rule of Louis-Philippe.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nHistory Buff Quiz"
