        "text": "Daniel Piazza ’21 is a strategic communication major who has taken his love of film to the next level. His short film, Fever Dream, was shown at the Circle Drive-In on Friday, Oct. 11.\n\n“I’ve always loved film for as long as I can remember,” Piazza said. “There’s something I admire about how a film can use every visual and auditory detail to make you feel a certain way. No matter the genre, it always puts me on the edge of my seat in a way no other artistic medium can.”\n\nFever Dream originally started out as a class project for Advanced Television Production (COMM 322). Piazza had the idea of a supernatural phone, and the story only grew from there. “The synopsis would be — a man finds an antique phone, but gets more than he bargained for when he discovers its true nature,” Piazza said. The film was influenced by the works of Dario Argento, John Carpenter, and the original Twilight Zone series.\n\nTwo versions of the film were made. The first one for class, and the second one being a longer, more complete version of the first. “After the first version of Fever Dream received a positive response in class, we got the crazy idea to remake it with better lighting/effects, new scenes, and the originally-planned ending,” Piazza said. “This led to seemingly endless nights at my best friend’s house (who co-directed the film with me), ironing out every detail.”\n\nProduction on the second version took around three months to complete. “One of the most difficult parts was that the entire film takes place at night, leaving only a few hours for us to shoot as the days grew longer throughout spring,” Piazza said. “I had some of the best help and support in the world on this project. I really want to thank everyone involved who helped make this project a reality.”\n\nAs far as the future goes, Piazza’s love of film will never cease. “I would absolutely love to keep making films in the future, and if I get the chance to make it a career I’m going to jump at it.”\n\nSee more student stories like this one in Campus Corner.\n\nThe outlook, skills and training required for jobs in the future will be discussed by Denis McDonough, former chief of staff to President Obama and current senior principal at the Markle Foundation, where he chairs the Rework America Task Force.\n\n“From the White House to the Work Force,” featuring a conversation with McDonough, will launch The University of Scranton’s Humanities in Action Lecture Series, which is sponsored by the Gail and Francis Slattery Center for Humanities. The discussion will be held at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 13, at the McIlhenny Ballroom of the DeNaples Center. The event is free of charge and open to the public.\n\nMarkle is engaged in a nationwide initiative aimed at driving innovations that expand opportunities for employment and broaden ways for all Americans to learn and train for the work of the future, according to its website. The foundation’s Rework America Task Force, which McDonough chairs, is a national initiative to transform the labor market so that all Americans can thrive in the digital economy.\n\nAt the Humanities in Action Lecture, University of Scranton philosophy professor Matthew Meyer, Ph.D., and Scranton Times-Tribune education reporter Sarah Hofius Hall will lead a question and answer session with McDonough. Audience members will have the opportunity to ask questions as well.\n\nAbout Denis McDonough\n\nFrom February 2013 to January 2017, McDonough served as White House chief of staff for President Barack Obama. In that role, he managed the White House staff, as well as cabinet secretaries and agency leaders. He advised the president on domestic policy and national security challenges facing the country, management issues facing the federal government and devised and enforced plans and accountability for performance and goals, maintaining the Obama Administration’s reputation for an effective, ethical operation. He planned and coordinated efforts to recruit and retain key talent – including an unprecedented expansion of technology experts and engineers within the White House and across the federal government.\n\nPrior to his role as chief of staff, McDonough was assistant to the president and principal deputy national security advisor. He chaired the National Security Council’s Deputies Committee. Throughout the 2008 presidential campaign, McDonough served as senior foreign policy advisor for Obama for America.\n\nCurrently, McDonough also serves as senior advisor for technology and global policy for Macro Advisory Partners, a strategic advisory firm which helps to navigate the intersection of global markets, geopolitics and policy. In addition, he is an executive fellow at the University of Notre Dame’s Keough School of Global Affairs, teaching a global policy seminar for graduate and undergraduate students. He serves on the board of directors for Catalyte, the National Democratic Institute and the SAFE Project, and is on the advisory council for the Tent Partnership for Refugees.\n\nMcDonough earned his bachelor’s degree, summa cum laude, from St. John’s University in Minnesota and his master’s degree from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service.\n\nAbout the Gail and Francis Slattery Center for Humanities\n\nIn May 2019, the University established the Gail and Francis Slattery Center for Humanities to advance the University’s liberal arts tradition and enhance the core role it plays in the formation of students to become “men and women for others.” The Center, named after the parents of benefactor and current University Trustee James M. Slattery ’86 and his wife, Betsy, will serve as a national model for humanities in action. Through the Center’s programs, elevated discourse on an array of topics and civic engagement will be encouraged by members of the University community, as well as by residents throughout the greater Scranton area.\n\nFor more information about the Humanities in Action Lecture, call 570-941-7401.\n\nOn Saturday, Oct. 5, the Friends of the Weinberg Memorial Library came together in celebration of their 25th anniversary and the presentation of the 16th Royden B. Davis, S.J., Distinguished Author Award. This year, The New York Times bestselling novelist and classicist Madeline Miller, author of “The Song of Achilles” and “Circe,” received the Distinguished Author Award.\n\n“The importance of a story that stays with you is what I think about when I read your novels,” said Charles Kratz, dean of the library and information fluency, in his opening remarks. “I’m sure everyone in this room has had one of those moments when they’ve finished a reading and said, ‘That story’s going to stay with me forever.’”\n\nFor Miller, Greek mythology is the story that stayed with her forever. “I have libraries in my blood,” she said. When she was young, her librarian mother read her the Greek classics that would inspire her novels decades later. “They resonated with me because these stories felt like really human stories, and they were timeless stories.”\n\nThe character she always returned to was Circe, an anomaly in classic myth. Born a minor goddess on the lowest totem pole of the divine hierarchy, she obtains incredible power on her own through witchcraft. In a world where women were relegated either to merely names or to villains, Circe was neither, disobeying the hierarchical order of the gods without being punished for it and simultaneously enacting vengeance and kindness on Odysseus, the weary war hero who haphazardly lands on her magical island.\n\nIn Homer’s “The Odyssey,” Odysseus spends ten years struggling to return home from the Trojan War and stays for a year on Circe’s island to rest. His narrative is, to Miller, another fundamentally human story: “‘The Odyssey’ is really about this exhausted war veteran who’s desperate to get home to his family, but once he gets home, it’s much harder to reenter his old life than he thought it would be.”\n\nThese two complicated characters meet when Odysseus lands on Circe’s island, and Circe, in her most infamous episode, turns his men into pigs. “In eighth grade, when I was first reading the confrontation between Odysseus and Circe, I was on the edge of my seat,” Miller said. “I wanted to know what was going to happen next – he’s smart and complicated, she’s smart and complicated, so there’s going to be an exciting scene, right? But what actually happens is that Circe tries to turn him into a pig, it doesn’t work. He pulls his sword on her, and she screams and falls to her knees, begs him for mercy, and invites him into her bed all in one breath. And at the time, I was enraged. That’s all this interesting female character gets?”\n\nMiller decided if the myth wouldn’t give Circe the story she deserved, she would have to write it herself.\n\n“Homer calls her ‘the dread goddess who speaks like a human.’ And as a novelist, that implies for me that this is a character who is born a goddess, but has her foot in both worlds. Circe’s story is this very human story of someone who’s born into this family where they really don’t belong and who’s trying to get out – but what’s the cost of getting out? Is it possible to get out? And where are you going once you are out?”\n\nThese questions are why humans retell these stories we’ve known the endings to for millennia, said Miller. Questions of war and questions of family are ideas that resonate with us in perpetuity, and we retell myths to find new answers to the age-old problems mortality brings.\n\nThe University of Scranton’s President’s Business Council (PBC) presented JoAnne M. Kuehner H’01 and Carl J. Kuehner ’62, H’11 with the President’s Medal at its 18th Annual Award Dinner on Oct. 10, at The Pierre Hotel in New York City. Proceeds from the gala, which raised more than $1 million, support the University’s Presidential Scholarship Endowment Fund. Through its past 17 dinners, the PBC has generated more than $15 million for the scholarship fund.\n\n“Of course, our presidential scholars are a University treasure. With tremendous talent, promise and potential, they provide academic leadership to their classmates,” said Rev. Scott R. Pilarz, S.J., president of The University of Scranton in his remarks. Presidential Scholarships are four-year, full-tuition scholarships awarded to incoming freshmen at Scranton with both outstanding records in high school and notable community involvement.\n\nClass of 2020 Presidential Scholar Katherine Musto, Pittston, a biology major in the undergraduate Honors Program, who spoke at the award dinner on behalf of the Presidential Scholars, said the best part about the University is its caring community.\n\n“The Jesuit quotes that are plastered all over various buildings are not just there for show. The faculty and staff truly embody them,” said Musto. “In my sophomore year, my brother Brian passed away after a long battle with cancer. I was in the middle of organic chemistry and a million different responsibilities, and I did not want to attend school anymore. My mom pushed me to go back to campus, and I was blown away by the kindness and support of my professors and peers. If I had gone to any other school, I probably wouldn’t be graduating on the traditional, four-year timeline.”\n\nFather Pilarz referred to the recipients of this year’s President’s Medal as “special exemplars” of the best characteristics of a Catholic and Jesuit education.\n\n“JoAnne and Carl Kuehner are a constant source of inspiration and are among the very best friends to the University and to me. For years, they have opened their homes and hearts to me and many other members of this community,” said Father Pilarz.\n\nThe President’s Medal recognizes individuals who have achieved excellence in their fields and demonstrated extraordinary compassion for others, representing lifetime achievements that reflect the University’s mission of Catholic and Jesuit excellence and service.\n\nFor more information on the PBC, contact Executive Director Timothy J. Pryle ’89 at 570-941-5837 or pbc@scranton.edu, or visit scranton.edu/pbc.\n\nAbout the Kuehners\n\nJoAnne M.

He also holds a master’s degree in engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTogether, the Kuehners have been active, long-term participants and philanthropists in their communities beyond their commitment to Hope for Haiti. They established the Scranton chapter of the Order of Malta and have spent 20 years serving as a knight and a dame in this lay Catholic order whose ministry is to care for the poor and the sick of the world. They were lay chairs for the Wayne-Pike region for the Diocese of Scranton 2018 Annual Appeal. Their commitment to the University, to the Pride, Passion, Promise Capital Campaign and to University leadership was commemorated with the naming of Kuehner Hall in the Loyola Science Center in 2012. In the fall of 2018, the University also dedicated “A Place of Solitude” on the second floor of McGurrin Hall, an enclosed space featuring a running fountain and a living wall that provides a quiet, welcoming area for students, faculty and staff to reflect, pray and discern. The space was dedicated to JoAnne’s and Carl’s parents, as well as to the parents of PCPS Dean Debra Pellegrino, Ed.D. The Kuehners, who reside in Lake Ariel and Naples, Florida, have four children, 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nHear them speak here.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Campus Corner, our campus blog, which you can read here.\n\nOne of the options for Residential Learning Communities (RLCs) is the Global Exchange program. This program provides an opportunity for domestic University of Scranton students and international and exchange students to live together and make connections across many cultures.\n\nThe program is for juniors and seniors at the University. Three students who want to live together can apply for the program for a chance to live with an international/exchange student. We spoke with a group that participates in the Global Exchange program. The four apartment residents are Nica Manasseri '21, Tori Gainey '21, Lauren Friedrich '21 and Andrea Lo '20.\n\nTheir regular roommate set to be part of this apartment is abroad for the semester, so this created the perfect opportunity for the group to welcome Lo to live with them for the semester.\n\n“We wanted to meet more people and experience different cultures,” Gainey said.\n\nLo is an exchange student from Taiwan who studies English literature at the University.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to come to the U.S. and study for a short time. I looked at my school’s study abroad programs and this is closest to New York, which was important to me because my mom has a friend living there. It thought it would be easier to be close to someone,” Lo said.\n\nStudents in the program live in an apartment on the first or second floor of Pilarz. All participating apartments are on the same floor, which allows for programs among the apartments. Throughout the semester (or year, depending on availability and preference), each apartment hosts an event to share food, traditions and customs of their exchange/international students. These events allow students to learn about various cultures.\n\n“Our program is going to be bubble tea and Korean fried chicken,” Gainey said.\n\nThis apartment group has meshed well with Lo.\n\n“I like how much we have in common with Andrea. She likes memes; I like memes,” Manasseri said.\n\nThe four have also found and discussed the many differences between their home countries.\n\n“This is Andrea’s first Pumpkin Spice Latte,” Gainey said while pointing at Lo’s Starbucks drink.\n\n“It’s really good!\" said Lo. \"As for the other food here, I don’t hate it. I do miss the food at home, though. I often cook noodles for myself in the apartment,” Lo said.\n\nSomething that Lo does prefer in the states is the teaching and class style. “The professors teach differently. In Taiwan they only lecture, which is boring. Here the professors want students to think critically. I like the way professors teach classes here much better,” Lo said.\n\nRead on in Campus Corner, here.\n\nA newly established fellowship at The University of Scranton will honor two highly-regarded community leaders from the region, Sondra and Morey Myers, J.D. Through their generous support and tireless work, both have encouraged civic engagement and cultural excellence for the betterment of the University, the city of Scranton, and the country.\n\nThe Sondra H’87 and Morey Myers H’12 Distinguished Visiting Fellowship in the Humanities and Civic Engagement, housed in the University’s Slattery Center for the Humanities, will help to advance the University’s efforts to bring renowned scholars, artists, and thinkers to Scranton to share their work and enrich cultural and civic activity at The University and in Scranton.\n\n“Sondra and Morey Myers represent the profound potential inherent in the humanities to enable and encourage civic engagement for the good of others,” said Rev. Scott R. Pilarz, S.J., president. “Their work has enriched the life of the University and the lives of so many in our community and nation, and we are proud to name a fellowship in the humanities in their honor as part of the Slattery Center for the Humanities.”\n\nIn August 2018, University of Scranton philosophy professor Matthew Meyer, Ph.D., and David N. Myers, Ph.D., Sady and Ludwig Kahn Professor of Jewish History, UCLA, and president, New Israel Fund, initiated the effort to begin a fellowship in honor of his parents. Through what Dr. Myers calls a “labor of love” and the support of the University, the fellowship has raised $450,000 to date through the generous support of dear friends, family and associates of the Myers’.\n\nDr. Myers said the extraordinary response “honors his parents’ lifelong commitment to the humanities and civic engagement in service of democracy, justice, and enlightenment in society.” He said the support also affirms the University’s strong commitment to the humanities.\n\n“A university can never be seen as isolated and disconnected. It can and must be deeply committed to society and its betterment,’ said Dr. Myers.\n\nThe fellowship will be formally launched on Thursday, Oct. 24, at a lecture by Wayne Winborne, executive director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University-Newark, which houses the largest archive of jazz history in the world. The lecture, which is presented free of charge and open to the public will begin at 5 p.m. in the Moskovitz Theater in The DeNaples Center.

A girl from Texas, Soldaña knew nothing more about the Middle East than that it was the place where the Bible took place. “We didn’t even have hummus at the grocery store,” she joked.\n\nOnce in the Middle East, Soldaña was overwhelmed with the culture of hospitality that welcomed her. As strangers opened their homes, beds, and hearts to her, she felt what she called a “holy envy” for their type of love.\n\nIn her travels, she visited a monastery outside Damascus where she met Rev. Paulo Dall’Oglio, S.J., who had founded a religious community dedicated to interreligious dialogue between Muslims and Christians. Fr. Paulo was the Ignatian Values in Action Lecture speaker in 2011.\n\nUnder Fr. Paulo’s guidance, Soldaña, embarked on the 30 day Ignatian Spiritual retreat in the desert. While contemplating the incarnation, Soldaña said, she realized that she didn’t believe that God became man and was terrified. She spoke to Fr. Paulo that night who reminded her that “the presence of God in our lives is scary,” but that Mary said yes to God, and so must we.\n\nSoldaña said yes in the desert, and fell in love with Christ.\n\nSoldaña also spoke of her relationship with a female sheikh, who taught her about Islam. She said her relationship with this muslim teacher made her love her own christianity more. The interactions between the women of different faiths, she said was like the Visitation from the Gospel of Luke. “Something in me leapt up and something in her leapt up.”\n\nSoldaña also told about falling in love with her now husband, Frederik, who at the time was a novice monk.\n\nAbout half-way through the lecture, the Soldaña’s tone and content changed. While The Bread of Angels, she said, was a story about how she fell in love, the Syrian civil war that followed the book’s publication was about staying in love. Fr. Paulo, she said, had stressed in his teaching the importance of fidelity after falling in love. After war broke out, Fr. Paulo and Soldaña’s sheikh were exiled from Syria. Fr. Paulo returned illegally in 2013, was kidnapped, and is presumed dead. In war, Jesuits “stayed in love.”\n\nSoldaña continued to share stories of “hidden saints” who, in the spirit of Middle Eastern hospitality, continued to open their doors to strangers and were shot for it. She told of a family who opened a pharmacy in their garage where they became famous for sharing medicine for the soul as well medicine for the body. She told of people who looked around the destruction of war, and made new and beautiful things out of the rubble.\n\nAt the conclusion of the talk, Soldaña called the students from Scranton to be witnesses. “Learning to see,” she said “is probably the most important thing in your life.” She called listeners to notice beauty in a world that seems to have lost its way; to “look into the broken world with the eyes of creation;” to build, from the destruction we find, something better and to “fall in love every day.”\n\n“Fall in love, stay in love, let all of your lives be love stories,” she said.\n\nThe University of Scranton’s President’s Business Council (PBC) will present JoAnne M. Kuehner H’01 and Carl J. Kuehner ’62, H’11 with the President’s Medal at its 18th Annual Award Dinner Thursday, Oct. 10, at The Pierre Hotel in New York City.\n\nJoAnne M.
