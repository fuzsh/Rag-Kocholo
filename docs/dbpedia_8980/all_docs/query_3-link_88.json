        "text": "Kahlil Gibran was born in 1883 in Mount Lebanon, what is today part of Lebanon. Gibran immigrated with his mother and siblings to the United States in 1885 and went to school in Boston.\n\nHe later returned to his native land before coming back to the States in 1902 while displaying a talent in art and writing. In 1904, he made the acquaintance of Mary Haskell, who helped finance his artistic interests in Paris from 1908 to 1910.\n\nAs Gibran’s artistic works became more popular, his writings, too, would have a profound impact on the world.\n\nIn 1923, he wrote perhaps his most famous book, \"The Prophet.\"\n\nThis book has been translated into more than 20 languages and has sold millions of copies worldwide.\n\nGibran’s essays on life’s gifts has been one of my all-time favorite reads in the quietness of a night, or when the wind blows, the thunder echoes and the rain falls gently upon my tin roof in some mystical cadence.\n\nIt is a book that is both soothing and provoking.\n\nThe story begins as the prophet, Al Mustafa, is waiting on his ship to depart the village of Orphalese and he is filled with sadness.\n\nAnd from a sanctuary appears Almitra, a seeress, who proclaims Al Mustafa a prophet of God and begs of him to share with the village people who have gathered his knowledge of those things between birth and death.\n\nAnd Almitra said, \"Speak to us of love,\" and the prophet, before a people filled with stillness, said in a great voice:\n\nWhen love beckons to you follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep …\n\nI always enjoyed reading those words of Gibran because they seem so raw and meaningful as he provides a view far beyond one’s horizon.\n\nA gift at my wedding contains a phrase on a blue stained glass piece from Gibran’s answer of love at Orphalese:\n\nAnd think not you can guide the course of love, For Love if it finds you worthy shall guide your course.\n\nI’ve walked by this stained piece of glass on my night stand for some 54 years and give thanks I’ve been found worthy.\n\nGibran’s words are shared through the voice of Al Mustafa, as he answers questions of the high priestess and other villagers on the subjects of life.\n\nHe provides short essays on many human topics:\n\nAnd a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.And he said:Your children are not your children, They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.\n\nThen a rich man asked, Speak to us of Giving.And he answered:You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give. There are those who give with joy and that joy is their reward.\n\nThen a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.And he answered:When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.\n\nThese reflecting lines represent but a brief glimpse of Gibran’s full essays. There is much more to consider as he discusses a range of human desires.\n\nWhile reading \"The Prophet,\" I always sit in awe at the thoughtfulness and wisdom that flows from Gibran’s pen.\n\nThen a judge said to Al Mustafa, speak to us of Crime and Punishment.And he said:And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.\n\nAnd a Youth said, speak to us of Friendship.And he answered saying:Your friend is your needs answered. He is your field which you sow with love and reap with Thanksgiving. And he is your board and fireside.\n\nThere is so much more to evaluate in these essays than the literary lines I have selected. Gibran’s visions and descriptive verses are ones that can be appreciated far beyond your imagination as they are reviewed.\n\nThen a priestess said, Speak to us of Prayer.And he answered saying:You pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance.And as Al Mustafa concluded his discourse and boarded his ship,Almitra stood remembering in her heart his saying,A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.And he departed.\n\nPete Waters is a Sharpsburg resident who writes for The Herald-Mail."
