        "text": "Below are several of San Diego State University's featured graduates from the class of 2012, which includes 9,973 degree candidates.\n\nCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS\n\nJessica Davis, 29, M.A., Philosophy\n\nJessica Davis believes philosophy can save education. Her Ideal School Foundation promotes the creation of philosophy-based charter high schools that encourage clear, critical thinking and lively debate.\n\nDavis had a difficult time finishing high school and didn’t even consider college. Although testing identified her as a gifted student, she grew disillusioned with the disconnect between public schools and real life.\n\nEventually, Davis realized that to change education, she would need credentials. And now she has them — a B.A. and M.A. in philosophy from SDSU, plus acceptance to the prestigious Ph.D. program at Teachers College Columbia University. (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\n“My vision is a network of schools in which every student flourishes,\" she said.\n\nRawan Elhalaby, 21,\n\nB.A., Political Science; Minor in History and Honors Interdisciplinary Studies\n\nRawan Elhalaby has built on a life-long interest in political and social movements and a deep desire to inspire people to action and applied it toward a bachelor's degree in political science. She's also minoring in history and interdisciplinary studies.\n\nWhile at SDSU, she became actively involved in cultural and political organizations on campus, such as the Muslim Student Association and Justice for Palestine, but she also took time to tutor refugee students at the International\n\nRescue Committee. She will graduate Summa Cum Laude and hopes to pursue a graduate degree in public administration and then working for a non-profit organization. (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\nNicole Ganz, 22, Double Major, B.A., Political Science, B.A., Communication\n\nA Compact Scholar from Eastlake High, Ganz found her niche at SDSU through Associated Students. Government and civics seem to be in her blood, as she interned in the office of a current San Diego mayoral candidate in addition to running and winning the position of Lobby Corps Officer for the California State Student Association, advocating on behalf of every student in the CSU system.\n\nAfter graduation, Ganz hopes to begin a career in local government for the City of San Diego. However, she would also like to teach high school government and instill the importance of government and advocacy for every individual into her students. (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\n\"My time in AS and as a YMCA Youth Advisor has solidified in me a desire to work in a field of civic engagement.\"\n\nCOLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\n\nMiles Bower, 30, M.B.A., Sports Business MBA Program\n\nBower may have felt somewhat out of place as an \"old man on campus,\" but this former Marine officer had already seen and overcome a number of challenges. After serving for six years and three deployments to Iraq, he left the Marine Corps in 2009 and started working in sports marketing. SDSU's history of supporting veteran students played a key role in his success.\n\n\"That's why I chose San Diego State. As opposed to just implementing veteran-service programs, it truly seemed that people at SDSU had taken the time to understand the issues specific to our community.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Bower plans on using his sports business education to organize adventures and road races in support of veteran-focused charities, as well as working on his own business to promote military marketing programs for sports organizations. (Hometown: Paoli, Penn.)\n\nMelissa and Michael Keane, 22 and 56, B.S. in Accounting, M.S. in Accounting\n\nAccounting runs in the family for this father-daughter duo. Michael earned his bachelor's degree in accounting at SDSU in 1981, and then returned to earn his master's degree while Melissa was earning her bachelor's. They will graduate together on May 19.\n\nMichael has run a private CPA practice in San Diego since September 1989, one month before Melissa's birth and is currently a member of the board of directors for a local community bank as well as the Mizzen Mast captain on the Star of India, the oldest active sailing ship in the world located in San Diego's harbor.\n\nMelissa plans to follow in her father's footsteps and start her own business as well — born out of her hobby of crocheting handmade crafts for babies and children. (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\nCOLLEGE OF EDUCATION\n\nLindsay Goulet, 22, B.S., Social Science (in preparation for the Single Subject Teaching Credential)\n\nLindsey Goulet came to SDSU through the Compact for Success program, a partnership with the Sweetwater Union High School District designed to offer students guaranteed admission to the university.\n\nInspired to create a positive change in her community, Goulet decided the best way to carry on the legacy of empowerment given to her by her high school teachers was to become an educator herself.\n\nGoulet will earn her bachelor’s degree in social science and plans to pursue a teaching credential in high school science and physics. Ultimately, she hopes to find a teaching position in the South County so she can give back to the community that inspired her.(Hometown: National City, Calif.)\n\nMalia Green, 29, B.S. Child Development, Minor in LGBT Studies\n\nMalia Green chose to attend SDSU for two reasons — diversity and community engagement. The former Marine Staff Sgt. joined the military at age 17 and left the service after seven years to focus on family and education. Her son had begun attending preschool, and seeing his excitement, she enrolled in a introductory child development class at a community college. The rest is history.\n\nShe fell in love with the subject, and transferred to SDSU in 2009 — where she has been very active in a number of student organizations. In addition to maintaing her status on the Dean's List, she volunteers teaching art class to elementary students, provides support to deployed Sailors and Marines through the Helping Hands Volunteer program, and works with the SDSU Youth Violence Research Lab to help implement curriculum in high and middle schools to combat bullying. Eventually, she hopes to secure a career working with at-risk LGBT youth. (Hometown: Alexandria, Va.)\n\n\"My goal? At the end of the day, I want to be able to go home and say I made a diference in someone's life today.\"\n\nLeslie Thompson, 63, M.A. Educational Technology\n\nEarning a graduate degree while teaching at an American school in Saudi Arabia can be a difficult obstacle, but that is exactly what Leslie Thompson accomplished from thousands of miles away.\n\n\"Completing the program entirely online means I've never met any teachers or students face to face, but between email, Skype, Adobe Connect, Moodle and Blackboard, I was able to plug in and stay connected to work on long-term projects as efficiently as though I was right there in San Diego.\"\n\nShe has seen the world while taking classes, attending classes while visiting locales such as Mumbai, Kuala Lumpur, Cairo, Bangkok and London, to name a few. During all this, the program that she began in fall of 2009 has given her the opportunity to do more than 20 hands-on projects directly related to her present position and goals for her professional future. (Hometown: Sacramento, Calif.)\n\nJoseph Michael DeAngelo Young, 22, B.A., Interdisciplinary Studies (Multimedia, Journalism and Educational Technology), Minor in International Studies.\n\nYoung has attended SDSU since 2007, and in that time, served as web editor for the Daily Aztec, and was the recipient of the Ozzie Roberts Scholarship in 2010 from the San Diego Black Journalists Association. Admittedly introverted, he has worked at length and with success to \"put himself out there\" more than he had before.\n\nFor his last semester, he made the decision to leave his comfort zone and go abroad. That led him to Hamburg, Germany, where he is working on a research project and taking classes at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. His most immediate goal upon graduation is to help his brother and sister with their studies — both at San Diego State. (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\n\"Now that I've had a chance to see the world outside of my normal routine, I have a strong interest in keeping that going and traveling the world.\"\n\nCOLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n\nLevi Lentz, 22, B.S., Mechanical Engineering\n\nLevi Lentz is the first in his family to go to college, and he has made the most of his years at SDSU.\n\nNot only is he the only SDSU engineering student to ever be elected into all five all-disciplinary honor societies, he won the Italian Machine Tool Design Award from the Italian Trade Commission and performed research into manufacturing systems — all while paying his own way.\n\nThe 2012 Homecoming King and College of Engineering valedictorian will attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology next semester to pursue a master’s degree in mechanical engineering en route to a Ph.D. (Hometown: Escondido, Calif.)\n\nJose Alonso Navarro, 21, B.S., Aerospace Engineering\n\nJose Alonso Navarro knew he wanted to earn a Ph.D, but recognized he would have a tough road.\n\nAfter emigrating from Mexico at age 8, his teachers mistook his inability to speak English well as an incapability to learn, which eventually fueled his passion to succeed.\n\nWhile at SDSU, Navarro completed an internship under NASA’s chief technologist, Mason Peck, at Cornell University. As an undergraduate, he has worked in the SDSU Combustion and Solar Energy Lab, furthering his research by working on the design of the control systems for a solar simulator.\n\nHis graduate studies will take him to the University of Wisconsin, where he will pursue a Nuclear Engineering doctoral degree and hopes to eventually work at NASA as a researcher. (Hometown: Guadalajara, Mexico/San Diego, Calif.)\n\nPhillip James Patague, 24, B.S., Civil Engineering\n\nThis Summa Cum Laude graduate is focused on a bright future of helping others. He tutors his classmates, holding study sessions weekly. He received the \"Quest for the Best\" Vice Presidential Student Service Award and the Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering Outstanding Graduate Award.\n\nCivil service is a huge focus for this civil engineer, as well. As president of the Chi Epsilon Civil Engineering Honor Society in Spring 2011, he mandated volunteer efforts for members, participating and organizing efforts in canyon and park cleanups, and took time to talk to K-12 students about the engineering fields. (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\n\"I'm going to focus my graduate studies in such a way that those fields will help me contribute to the world the most. My ultimate goal is to help underdeveloped communities through environmental remediation and minimizing structural damage.\"\n\nIsmael Reveles, 23, B.S., Aerospace Engineering\n\nHelping others to be whole again is an idea Reveles takes to heart, almost literally. His future plans will take him into the field of biomechanics and prostheses, building on his education in SDSU's Bioengineering Lab where he's researched applications of artificial cardiac muscle actuators in rehabilitation for stroke victims.\n\nHe hopes to be part of the group of scientists who will develop the first functional robot arms, and will join a group of students to present research findings on the topic at the University of Washington this month, as part of a three-university partnership to develop a center for research in prosthetics and rehabilitation devices.\n\n“The work is geared mostly for military vets and amputees, but it can also be used for kids with cerebral palsy. They may have the limb, but it’s not functional. But With an assistive device, they can be functional again.”\n\nThe first-generation student serves as president of the SDSU chapter of the Society for Advancements of Chicanos and Native Americans in Sciences. He’s also co-president of an engineering society that recently organized a week-long \"build-off\" program called \"Engineering in the Barrio.\" (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\nCOLLEGE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\nJia Huang Jia Huang, 23, B.S., Public Health\n\nJia Huang may have come from a difficult socio-economic upbringing, but she learned from experience and by watching her family the power of dedication and focus. She will build on her experience at SDSU on her way to the medical profession.\n\nSince coming to SDSU, she has been actively involved in health education, reaching out to students to raise awareness on a number of health issues such as STDs, domestic abuse and birth control. She has also volunteered at the ER at Alvarado Hospital, which strengthened her passion to serve and inspire awareness amongst underserved populations.\n\nShe has been on the Dean's List since Fall 2007, and recently earned the School of Public Health's Outstanding Undergraduate. She plans to apply for medical school in hopes of building relationships with patients and empowering them to lead healthier lifestyles through a blend of medicine and health education. (Hometown: San Francisco, Calif.)\n\nCOLLEGE OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES AND FINE ARTS\n\nDiana Crofts-Pelayo Diana Crofts-Pelayo, 21, B.A., Journalism, B.A., Spanish, Minor in Interdisciplinary Studies\n\nThe first-generation Mexican American was told from an early age by her great-grandmother \"Si lo puedes ver, lo puedes lograr\" — \"If you can see it, you can achieve it.\"\n\n\"Reporting is my passion and I strongly believe that I can help make the world a better place through media.\"\n\nDouble-majoring in journalism and Spanish, Crofts-Palayo has been on the Dean's List every semester, earning a 3.9 GPA throughout and accepted into several honors societies across disciplines.\n\nShe didn't waste any time pursuing her passion. While studying at SDSU, she also worked as a staff writer for the Daily Aztec, and interned at both KPBS and NBC7 San Diego. (Hometown: San Diego, CA)\n\nArlene Cagayat De Guzman, 23, B.A., Journalism with an Emphasis in Public Relations, Minor in Political Science\n\nDe Guzman may have been an undeclared major up until her junior year at SDSU, but when she completed her general education courses, it became clear the communications field was for her. At first, she set upon journalism, but after taking a class with Professor Bey-Ling Sha, she realized it would have to be public relations, and declared that emphasis.\n\nDuring her time at SDSU, De Guzman served as the Vice Chair for AS Cultural Arts and Special Events, an organization she's been involved with since her freshman year. She was also a Compact Advisor for the Compact Scholars Program, a member of Andres Bonifacio Samahan and the Asian-Pacific Student Alliance, and involved with the Public Relations Student Society of America.\n\nShe has overcome a number of obstacles in her life, including the financial loss of her home in 2008. However, her family would not let circumstances get the better of them and through hard work and financial planning, moved into another home in less than six months. The lesson of diligence and effective management of money would not be lost on her. After completing a three-month internship and impressing company officials at BAM Communications, she was hired to work as their Marketing and Social Media Coordinator in April. (Hometown: San Diego, Calif.)\n\nRoxanne and Sierra Ellison, 22 and 23, B.A., Television, Film and New Media\n\nRoxanne and Sierra Ellison seem like two peas in a pod. They will both graduate from the College of Professional Studies and Fine Arts with the same major; they were doubles partners on the SDSU Women's Tennis Team; and they have earned awards both on the court and for their studies.\n\nThe pair will play professionally after graduating, continuing their doubles success on the pro circuit.\n\nRoxanne earned Mountain West Scholar Athlete honors each of her four years at SDSU, and will graduate summa cum laude as the Outstanding Graduate for the Theatre, Television and Film Department.\n\nSierra is a three-time All Conference Doubles player, receiving the Cissie Leary sportsmanship award in 2011, and was a finalist in the TableReadMyScreenPlay at the Sundance Film Festival.
