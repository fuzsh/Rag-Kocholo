        "text": "Tony Shalhoub is one of Green Bay’s most famous native sons, but how his family came to Wisconsin and the struggles they endured to get here is a story even he didn’t fully know.\n\nHe learns of their journey during a new episode of “Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr.” that airs at 7 p.m. Feb. 9 on PBS.\n\nShalhoub, best known for his Emmy Award-winning roles on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “Monk,” is one of 20 celebrities on Season 7 of the series in which DNA experts and genealogists explore the ancestry of featured guests. The one-hour episode, titled “The Shirts on Their Backs,” also tells of the immigrant roots of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” star Christopher Meloni.\n\nBefore delving into Shalhoub’s family history in Lebanon, viewers get a snapshot of his childhood in Green Bay, including actual family snapshots.\n\nRELATED: Tony Shalhoub talks about growing up in Green Bay, Lombardi-era Packers\n\nThe second youngest of 10 children born to Joseph and Helen (Seroogy) Shalhoub, he grew up with six sisters and three brothers in a three-story house on a corner lot on Doty Street. His dad worked as a meat peddler selling from a refrigerated truck. The siblings often entertained each other with play acting — always guaranteed a built-in audience.\n\nHis older sister, Susan, frequently did plays at the all-girls Catholic school she attended, and when they needed a child for a production, they recruited young Tony. He got his first taste of live theater when he was in the “King and I” at age 6 and “Carousel” at 7 or 8.\n\nThe 67-year-old Shalhoub, a Green Bay East High School graduate, credits his family for being a grounding presence in his life and helping him navigate the sometimes choppy waters of Hollywood.\n\n“The challenges of this kind of career, there were times when it was not going well or in my mind maybe not going well enough, and my family was really there to support me, to encourage me, to remind me of what was really important, and I think without that, the stress and the negativity would’ve probably consumed me, but they didn’t allow that to happen,” he told Gates.\n\nShalhoub knew that his father, Joseph, came to Ellis Island on a boat from Lebanon at age 8 after he and his siblings lost their parents during World War I. He honored him and the courage of all immigrants in his acceptance speech when he won the Tony Award for his role in \"The Band's Visit\" in 2018.\n\nHe knew much less about how he had become an orphan. The “Finding Your Roots” episode uncovers the hardships of his grandparents — war, famine, disease and locust plagues — in Lebanon.\n\nAfter their deaths, it was Joseph’s older sister, just a teenager at the time, who would eventually get the four siblings to France, where they set sail to New York to join relatives in Wisconsin, including Green Bay. It was a journey that took three months.\n\n“She was a hero,” Shalhoub said of the woman he knew as his aunt later in life. “There was sort of a gentleness, a softness about her, motherly and warm and loving and squishy, but boy in her core, in her spine there was steel.”\n\nThe show also explores the family history of his mother, Helen Seroogy, who was not an immigrant. She was born in Wisconsin.\n\nShalhoub’s great-grandparents, Rucas and Anastasia Seroogy, brought the family to America from Lebanon in the 1890s. Shalhoub never knew how it was they ended up in Green Bay, which had few Middle Eastern settlers at the time, but he gets his answer in the episode, thanks to an article from the Brown County Historical Society published in the Green Bay Press-Gazette in 1999.\n\nThe promise of good work in the area changed their original plans and they eventually settled in De Pere. Rucas would go on to become what Gates calls the \"ultimate American immigration success story,\" laying the groundwork for future generations.\n\nIt's not mentioned specifically in the episode, but it is Rucas and Anastasia's great-grandsons, brothers Joe and Jim Seroogy, who still operate Seroogy's chocolates, the business started in 1899 in De Pere.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Green Bay archives department provided citizenship papers, land records, maps of the family home, probate records and court case files used in the episode."
