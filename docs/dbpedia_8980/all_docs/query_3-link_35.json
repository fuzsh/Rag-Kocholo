        "text": "via GIPHY\n\nKelly Roncace | For NJ.com\n\nLocal heroes\n\nThe Garden State's 21 counties are not created equal when it comes to producing celebrities. While Essex County is a literal fame factory, other areas have hardly any household names to claim. Here are our choices for the biggests name from each of the state's 21 counties, along with a list of runners-up. Note: We only considered celebrities who are still alive, and who spent most of their formative years here. If you disagree with any of our choices, or think we forgot someone, let us know in the comments below. — Kelly Roncace\n\n(File photo)\n\nKelly Roncace | For NJ.com\n\nAtlantic County: Benjamin Burnley\n\nBenjamin Burnley, founder and lead singer for Breaking Benjamin (\"The Diary of Jane,\" \"Give Me a Sign\") straddles two counties, having been born in Atlantic City but having spent some of his childhood in Ocean City.

In 1967, she moved to Manhattan and has since released 11 studio albums, as well as two award-winning memoirs.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nProfessional wrestler King Kong Bundy was born in Atlantic City, graduated from Washington Township High School, and now lives in Glassboro.\n\n(Photo by Joan Marcus)\n\nKelly Roncace | For NJ.com\n\nHudson County: Nathan Lane\n\nHudson has quite a few familiar faces, but Nathan Lane, actor of stage and screen, takes the top spot for celebs in this county.

But that person is actress Vera Farmiga, a very successful actress who currently can be seen in theaters portraying Lorraine Warren in \"The Conjuring II.\" She was born in Clifton and raised in a Ukrainian-American community in Irvington. At 12, she moved to Whitehouse Station, but she attended St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic School in Newark.
