        "text": "Robert Louis Geddes, FAIA (December 7, 1923 – February 13, 2023)\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nRobert Louis Geddes was born on December 7, 1923, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Louis J. Geddes (born Goldberg) and Kate Geddes (born Malmed), both of Ukrainian-Jewish descent. Raised in Ventnor City, New Jersey, Geddes attended John Burroughs Middle School in Los Angeles and graduated from Atlantic City High School in 1941. He began his higher education at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to Yale University in 1942. His studies were interrupted by his service in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II from 1942 to 1945. After the war, Geddes resumed his education and earned an M.Arch. from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1950.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1953, Geddes co-founded Geddes Brecher Qualls Cunningham (GBQC) Architects in Philadelphia, later expanding the firm to Princeton. Prior to this, he briefly worked for Hugh Stubbins, Jr. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under his leadership, GBQC gained national and international recognition, winning several competitions and awards. Notable projects include the Pender Labs at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Police Headquarters, and the Liberty State Park master plan. His best-known work is the Dining Commons, Birch Garden, and Academic Building at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\n\nUrbanism\n\nGeddes contributed significantly to urban design, serving as a consultant for the Philadelphia Center City Plan and the Third Regional Plan of New York. GBQC won first prize in the Vienna-South urban extension competition and their master plan for Liberty State Park was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. Geddes also worked on projects such as the Hudson Yards in Manhattan and co-founded Princeton Future, focusing on urban development in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nEducation\n\nGeddes taught architecture and civic design at the University of Pennsylvania from 1951 to 1965 before becoming the first Dean of the Princeton University School of Architecture. During his tenure (1965-1982), the school became a major center for architectural ideas, and he played a crucial role in admitting women into the program. He also taught at New York University as the Henry Luce Professor of Architecture, Urbanism, and History, where he connected architecture with the humanities and social sciences. Geddes is known for his influential undergraduate course \"Buildings, Landscapes, and Cities\" and co-authored the Princeton Report on Architectural Education.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n\nGeddes married Evelyn Geddes in 1947, and they had two children. The couple remained married for 73 years until Evelyn's death in 2020. Robert Geddes passed away on February 13, 2023, near Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 99.\n\nSelected Works: Architecture\n\nPender Labs, Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania (1958, demolished 2003)\n\nSydney Opera House, Sydney, Australia (Second place in design competition, 1955)\n\nPhiladelphia Police Headquarters (1960)\n\nCaesar Rodney Residence Hall Complex, University of Delaware (1966)\n\nHill Hall, Rutgers University–Newark (1967)\n\nInstitute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey (1970–72)\n\nCorning, New York Main Street Renewal (1972)\n\nStockton University (then Richard Stockton College) (1970–76)\n\nArchitects Housing Company, Trenton, New Jersey (1975)\n\nRutgers University–New Brunswick, Piscataway campus (Psychology building, 1975)\n\nRutgers University–New Brunswick, Livingston campus (Student Center, 1985)\n\nTrexler Library, Muhlenberg College (1988)\n\nPrinceton Community Housing (1989)\n\nEnvironmental and Health Science Laboratory, Mobile Oil Corporation Technical Center (1989)\n\nSelected Works: Urbanism\n\nVienna-South urban expansion (1972)\n\nLiberty State Park, Jersey City, New Jersey (1974–84)\n\nPhiladelphia Center City master plan (1988)\n\nGeddes was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and received numerous honorary doctorates and awards throughout his career, including the Architecture Firm Award for GBQC in 1979. His legacy in architecture and urbanism remains influential through his projects, teachings, and writings.\n\nAlan Gussow (1931 - 1997)\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nAlan Gussow was born on May 8, 1931, in New York City but grew up in Rockville Centre, NY. He attended art classes at the Pratt Institute before graduating from Middlebury College in 1952 with a degree in Literature. In 1953, while studying painting at Cooper Union, he was awarded the Prix de Rome, becoming the youngest recipient of the award at that time. Gussow studied at the American Academy in Rome from 1953 to 1955, during which he was influenced by artists like Paul Klee, Arshile Gorky, and Stuart Davis. He also learned printmaking from Stanley William Hayter.\n\nCareer\n\nArtistic Development\n\nGussow's artistic career, which spanned nearly half a century, was characterized by a blend of abstraction and representation, with nature as his primary subject. His early works in the 1950s and 1960s were traditional landscapes, painted from a separate vantage point. However, he eventually connected the energy of his art with the energy he experienced in natural settings, developing a unique perspective influenced by the Abstract Expressionist movement and artists like Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline.\n\nIn the 1970s and onwards, Gussow's works captured deeper, more personal encounters with nature, reflecting sensory experiences such as smells, tastes, and tactile sensations. His later pastels, as described by Holland Cotter in The New York Times, suggested both flowing water and fingerprint patterns, illustrating the intimate link between man and nature.\n\nNotable Exhibitions and Projects\n\nGussow's first solo museum show was in 1961 at the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts in Hagerstown, MD. Over his career, he had more than 50 one-man exhibitions and participated in over 60 group shows internationally. His work was represented by the Peridot Gallery and Joan T. Washburn, and later by the Sid Deutsch Gallery, MB Modern, Gavin Brown's Enterprise, and Babcock Galleries.\n\nA pivotal moment in Gussow's career occurred in 1980 when he was profoundly moved by aboriginal art during a trip to Australia. Inspired by the role of art in these communities, he began to experiment with art as a process rather than a product. His 1982 International Shadow Project, which involved 15,000 people painting silhouettes in the streets of 400 cities worldwide on the 40th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombings, exemplified his belief in the artist's duty to connect people to their shared potential to change the world.\n\nActivism and Conservation\n\nGussow was a dedicated environmental activist. In 1965, he played a key role in preventing a proposed Con Edison plant that would have destroyed Storm King Mountain in the Hudson Valley. He co-founded the Citizen's Committee for the Hudson River and brought Senator Robert F. Kennedy to the Hudson to highlight the river's environmental dangers. Gussow testified before Congress on environmental issues and advised Senator George McGovern during his presidential campaign.\n\nAs a consultant for the National Park Service, Gussow implemented the Artist in Residence program in the National Parks. His advocacy extended beyond his art, contributing significantly to conservation efforts.\n\nTeaching and Writing\n\nGussow was an active teacher for 40 years, playing a significant role in establishing the fine arts program at the Parsons School of Design, where he taught until 1968. He also taught at Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Massachusetts, Middlebury College, and the University of California, Santa Cruz, holding positions in both the Environmental Studies and Art Departments.\n\nGussow authored numerous articles, essays, and monographs. His book, A Sense of Place: The Artist and the American Land (1972), paired works by American landscape artists with their writings, and his 1993 publication, The Artist as Native: Reinventing Regionalism, inspired major gallery exhibitions.\n\nPersonal Life and Legacy\n\nIn 1956, Gussow married Joan Dye, a researcher for Time magazine who later became a nutritionist and chair of the nutrition department at Columbia Teacher's College. They lived in the Hudson River Valley, where they became avid organic gardeners. Gussow maintained a studio in his New York home and made annual painting trips to Monhegan Island, ME. He passed away from cancer on May 5, 1997, in Piermont, NY.\n\nGussow's legacy as an artist, conservationist, and educator continues to inspire, with his works and environmental efforts leaving a lasting impact on both the art world and natural conservation.\n\nTitle: New Roles for Environmental Designers\n\nWilliam Johnson, FASLA\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nWilliam Johnson was born in Lansing, Michigan. He pursued his interest in landscape architecture at Michigan State University, where he graduated in 1953. Following his military service, Johnson furthered his education by completing a Master of Landscape Architecture (M.L.A.) at Harvard's Graduate School of Design (GSD). During his time in Cambridge, he worked under the influential landscape architect Hideo Sasaki and served as an instructor at the GSD.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nIn 1961, Johnson returned to the Midwest and co-founded the firm Johnson, Johnson and Roy (JJR) with his brother Carl and Clarence Roy. The firm's master plan for the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor exemplified their integrated approach to planning and analysis. Johnson's core design philosophy emphasized fitness, harmony, and community involvement, which became hallmarks of JJR's projects.\n\nAcademic Contributions\n\nJohnson began his teaching career in 1958 as a professor of landscape architecture. He was appointed Dean of the School of Natural Resources at the University of Michigan in 1975, a position he held until 1983. In 1988, he was named Professor Emeritus. His commitment to education was a constant throughout his career, influencing countless students and professionals in the field of landscape architecture.\n\nLater Career and Collaborations\n\nAfter his tenure at JJR (1961-1975), Johnson continued his practice as William J. Johnson Associates from 1980 to 1992. His work focused on campus, resort, and community planning, as well as parks and recreation projects. In 1992, he formed a partnership with Peter Walker, leading to numerous national and international commissions.\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nWilliam Johnson was named a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1973, recognizing his significant contributions to the field. In 1986, he was awarded the ASLA Medal, the highest honor given by the organization, for his outstanding achievements and enduring influence on the profession.\n\nLegacy\n\nWilliam Johnson's legacy is marked by his innovative approach to landscape architecture, his dedication to education, and his influential designs that prioritize community involvement and environmental harmony. His work continues to inspire future generations of landscape architects.\n\nSusana Torre\n\nSusana Torre (born 1944) is an Argentine-born American architect, critic, and educator, whose career has spanned New York City (1968–2008) and Carboneras, Almeria, Spain (since 2009).

Torre, an economist, and Amelia E. Silva, a school teacher. After her father's death when she was eight, the family relocated to La Plata. Torre pursued her architectural studies at the Schools of Architecture and Planning at Universidad de La Plata and Universidad de Buenos Aires, receiving her diploma in 1968. She represented Argentina at the 1967 International Design Conference in Aspen, Colorado, and won a fellowship from the Edgar Kaufmann Jr. Foundation, enabling her to travel and study across the United States. Upon returning to Argentina, she established the Design Department at the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes in La Plata, the first of its kind in Latin America.\n\nCareer in the United States\n\nTorre returned to the US in 1968 to conduct postgraduate work on computer applications in architecture at Columbia University. In New York City, she became associated with The Museum of Modern Art’s Department of Architecture and worked on a research project on New Urban Settlements at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies.\n\nIn 1972, Torre joined the faculty of SUNY at Old Westbury, where she developed the Art Department’s first design curriculum. The following year, she co-founded the Archive of Women in Architecture of The Architectural League of New York. In 1977, she organized and curated the first major exhibition of American women architects and edited the accompanying book, Women in American Architecture: A Historic and Contemporary Perspective. This groundbreaking work opened at the Brooklyn Museum and toured the US and the Netherlands. Torre also co-founded Heresies: A Feminist Journal on Art and Politics and contributed to several issues.\n\nArchitectural Practice\n\nTorre established The Architectural Studio in New York City in 1978. One of her early projects, the Law Offices of art collector Harry Torczyner, was recognized by the American Institute of Architects as one of the memorable spaces of the 1970s. Her practice is noted for its intense theoretical, ethical, and civic approach to architecture and urban design, blending cultural, social, and regional themes.\n\nAmong Torre’s notable projects are Fire Station Five in Columbus, Indiana; the Ellis Island park proposal; the Clark and Garvey Houses in The Hamptons, New York; and the renovation of Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia University. Her Fire Station Five, completed in 1987, was the first firehouse designed to integrate women into the firefighting force, setting a precedent for similar designs nationwide.\n\nAcademic Contributions\n\nTorre's academic career includes leadership roles such as Director of the Cranbrook Academy of Art (1994–95), Chair of the Parsons School of Design Architecture and Environmental Design Department (1991–94), and Director of the Architecture Program at Barnard College, Columbia University (1982–85). She has taught at numerous prestigious institutions including Columbia University, Yale University, and the University of Sydney. Her pedagogical approach emphasizes environmental responsiveness, cultural and physical context, and sustainable design practices.\n\nLater Life and Legacy\n\nIn 2008, Torre completed a residential community of seven seafront houses in Carboneras, Spain, where she currently resides with her husband, writer and sociologist Geoffrey E. Fox. Torre continues to influence the field of architecture through her design work, writing, and theoretical contributions.

Around 1950, he established his own practice in the San Francisco Bay Area. Esherick was also a long-time professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1989, he was awarded the AIA Gold Medal, recognizing his significant contributions to the field of architecture. Esherick's work followed in the tradition of Bay Area architects such as Bernard Maybeck and William Wurster, designing hundreds of houses that emphasized regional traditions, site requirements, and user needs.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 1938, Esherick married Rebecca Wood, an architect he knew from Pennsylvania. About ten years later, Rebecca designed their home in Kent Woodlands with Joe consulting. The house's modern style featured a huge gabled roof and large glass walls. In 1946, Rebecca earned her architectural license and worked with Joseph on various projects while raising their three children. The couple divorced in 1951.\n\nContribution to Berkeley's College of Environmental Design\n\nIn 1959, Esherick co-founded the College of Environmental Design (CED) at the University of California, Berkeley, along with William Wurster and Vernon DeMars. The CED brought together architecture, landscape architecture, environmental planning, and city planning, becoming a hub for influential figures like Christopher Alexander, Catherine Bauer, Galen Cranz, Donlyn Lyndon, Roger Montgomery, Charles Moore, and William Wilson Wurster.\n\nEsherick Homsey Dodge & Davis (EHDD)\n\nIn 1972, Esherick reorganized his office to focus more on commercial and academic projects, forming Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis with longtime associates George Homsey, Peter Dodge, and Chuck Davis. The firm won the 1986 Architecture Firm Award and continues today as EHDD Architecture. In 1976, Esherick was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1990.\n\nLegacy and Major Works\n\nJoseph Esherick was the nephew of American sculptor Wharton Esherick.
