        "text": "When hypersonic aeronautics and space exploration meet, European engineers dream of a future fast-track return-ticket to space. The momentum is growing for a new generation of aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound and passengers dashing from Brussels to Sydney in just three hours. However, we are still years away from civilians traveling routinely again at the speed of sound. An incipient air travel revolution aims to reduce both time travel and fuel consumption. Faster travel would bring space closer. ESA is looking at the challenges and opportunities in the air and space industries to build vehicles flying at hypersonic speeds in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and beyond. ESA continues to identify synergies tics space sectors and pinpoint technological locks for hypersonic vehicles on Earth and in space. A two-day workshop in Germany earlier this spring brought together industry, academic and agencies experts from the aeronautics and space sectors. ‚ÄúWe did not aim at providing concrete solutions but rather to first identify challenges and technical dependencies between fields. This is a starting point to enable future reusable hypersonic vehicles for an Earth-to-orbit hub,‚Äù says Didier Schmitt, ESA‚Äôs Future Preparation Group leader. Bringing experts together served as a technical kick-off to leapfrog technologies for a vehicle taking astronauts to low Earth orbit. As many as 70 experts raised key questions and challenges to overcome. ‚ÄúWe called for both industries to learn about each other‚Äôs showstoppers. To deliver a transformational change, reusable is the key word. Concepts for hypersonic reusable vehicles include lifting bodies designs for European crew access to space and landing on a runaway or landing pad,‚Äù explains Didier. #ESA #Space #Hypersonic\n\nExactly one year after the the announcement of the European Space Agency - ESA #astronaut \"class of 2022\", the reserves came together this week for briefings at the European Astronaut Centre, on the German Aerospace Center (DLR) campus in #K√∂ln. These are my four daily shortform video-diaries combined into one, originally published each evening on my Instagram and twitter feeds during that week. [This meeting just happened to coincide with the UK Space Conference #UKSC2023, which I was sorry to miss.] It was a very interesting week with a lot of topics covered so I wanted to share my enthusiasm and to help raise awareness of the diverse range of things the space sector has expertise in. But equally... as an employee of the UK Space Agency, I feel that this kind of #ScienceCommunication is also a form of public accountability and professional responsibility. I am part of the #CivilService, and all these facilities are supported by public investment, so it's important that society can see and, to some small degree, participate. So, while these videos received only 'likes' in the dozens and 'views' in the hundreds (I'm hardly insta-famous!) I was very heartened to read this particular reply to my final day's video by twitter user David Wolf: https://lnkd.in/eEWyX-Hg ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì \"Outreach in action üë©üéì Updates like this are an amazing way of sharing the experience of an astronaut's journey. Whether it's the exciting, thrilling stuff üë©üöÄ or the more mundane üë©üíª; it's always interesting to see these posts.

It was expected to launch tonight at 10:34 p.m. ET. TechCrunch reports: There are backup launch opportunities on May 7, 10 and 11. After years of delays and over $1 billion in cost overruns, the mission is set to be Boeing's first attempt to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. Once the issue is resolved with the upper stage, the United Launch Alliance Atlas V will carry the CST-100 Starliner capsule to orbit along with the two onboard astronauts -- Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams -- from Florida's Cape Canaveral at 10:34 PM local time Monday evening. The mission also marks the first time ULA's Atlas will carry crew. The rocket boasts a success rate of 100% across 99 missions. (ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.) The astronauts would now dock at the station at the earliest on Thursday, where they would remain for at least eight days. The two astronauts will return to Earth in the capsule no earlier than May 16. If all goes to plan, Boeing will be able to finally certify its Starliner for human transportation and begin fulfilling the terms of its $4.2 billion NASA astronaut taxi contract. That contract, under the agency's Commercial Crew Program, was awarded in 2014. Elon Musk's SpaceX was also granted a contract under that program, for its Crew Dragon capsule, and has been transporting astronauts to and from the ISS since 2020.

In 2022, high-ranking representatives of European Space Agency - ESA announced that they would make space travel possible for everyone and thus probably initiate a rethink - in keeping with the motto \"#Space4All\" - physical impairment should no longer be an obstacle to becoming a (para)astronaut. In a major campaign and a complex selection process, the perfect candidate for this pioneering project was to be selected - the British leg-amputee former Paralympian and doctor John McFall prevailed, a milestone (probably the most personal for him) had been reached! From now on, the scientific and practical part of the unique feasibility study began - to find out whether/to what extent a physical impairment has any effects in space/under space conditions. Over the last two years, John has completed countless training courses at the European Astronaut Training Center in Cologne, which physically non-impaired selected astronaut candidates also have to complete as part of their basic training. The results were always evaluated by a (space) medical expert panel. On July 19, 2024, the time had come for the decision of #ESA - after completing all tests and training and the corresponding analysis and weighing up of the results: John McFall's physical impairment is not an obstacle to a stay in space! A decision with far-reaching personal and social consequences, I am convinced. Of course, there is no date set for John's first space flight yet, but I especially congratulate him on everything he has achieved so far and the #ESA for having the courage to actually live the motto \"Space4All\" and thus contribute to the inclusion and equality of physically impaired people, not only in science but also in society as a whole!üöÄüë©üöÄ\n\nüöÄ Europe is back in space! European Space Agency - ESA has confirmed the success of the first flight of the #Ariane6 rocket. üòÆ üëè The new model lifted off yesterday at around 21:00 Polish time. The flight lasted 3 hours and consisted of three stages. üë©üöÄ ‚ú¥ The new rocket is designed to replace the now retired Ariane 5, which was used for 27 years in more than 100 space flights. It made its last flight in July 2023. The first flight of #Ariane6 is therefore a milestone for ESA and an opportunity for Europe to regain its independence in space. üöÄ We're writing about it because we're excited as Europeans, but also as residents of Wroclaw, üé• because cameras from Scanway, a company based in Wroclaw, were on board! Their task was to record key phases of the European rocket's flight. The data acquired and provided by Scanway Space will be used by the European Space Agency - ESA for detailed analysis and optimization of future #Ariane6 flights. ‚ú¥ Congratulations and we are happy that the universe has opened up for Europe again! üì∑: European Space Agency - ESA official\n\n\"#Poland signs #agreement to #fly #astronaut on #AxiomSpace #ISS mission-Poland has become the second #European #SpaceAgency #memberstate to reach an agreement to fly an astronaut on a #private #mission to the #InternationalSpaceStation. Axiom Space said Aug. 9 it signed an agreement with Poland, in #cooperation with #ESA, to fly an astronaut from that nation on a future mission to the ISS. The announcement did not disclose the identity of the astronaut or when that person would go to the station. ‚ÄúCooperation with ESA and Axiom Space is an important step in the #development of both the #Polish #spacesector and #science,‚Äù said Waldemar Buda, #Poland ‚Äôs #minister of #economic #development and #technology, in a statement. ‚ÄúA Polish astronaut will have the opportunity to test the most advanced Polish technologies.‚Äù At a June 29 briefing after a #meeting of the #ESACouncil, the agency announced that #Poland was increasing its #subscription to agency programs by 295 #million euros ($320 million) which included the #flight of a #Polish #astronaut to the #ISS, but did not disclose additional details about those plans. The most likely #candidate for the #flight is Slawosz Uznanski, who was selected as a reserve astronaut by ESA last November and is the only Polish member of ESA‚Äôs astronaut corps. He was among 11 people ESA picked as reserve astronauts, who will not join the astronaut corps on a full-time basis but be available for selected flight opportunities. Another reserve astronaut, Marcus Wandt, was selected in June to fly on another Axiom Space mission to the ISS through an agreement involving Axiom, ESA and the Swedish National Space Agency #SNSA first announced in April. Wandt is expected to fly on Axiom‚Äôs #Ax3 mission to the ISS in early 2024. ‚ÄúPoland will be the second ESA-sponsored nation to send an #astronaut on a #commercial #human #spaceflight mission, establishing a growing #network of #nations in #Europe eager to #explore the #benefits of #microgravity and positioning the region as #pioneers of #commercial #space,‚Äù Michael Suffredini, president and chief executive of Axiom Space, said in a statement. The agreements by Poland and Sweden with Axiom Space are part of growing interest in human spaceflight in Europe. Walter Villadei, an #Italian Air Force pilot who flew on a #VirginGalactic #suborbital #flight in June, had previously trained as a backup for #Axiom ‚Äôs #Ax2 mission to the station in May and is expected to be named to a future Axiom mission. The #Hungarian government announced last November it is spending $100 #million for its own private astronaut mission to the ISS. Both the #Italian and #Hungarian efforts are taking place, for now, outside of ESA, but the agency sees them as signs of #growing #interest in #human #spaceflight in #Europe.\"... space news"
