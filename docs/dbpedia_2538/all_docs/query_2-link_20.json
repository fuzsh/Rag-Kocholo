        "text": "Ethics, Compliance, and Governance: A Technology Association of Oregon AI & Data Community Conversation on Thursday, March 21st at Moss Adams. Are you feeling the buzz around #ai but struggling to find clear guidance on using or building AI tools and systems safely and ethically, while taking advantage of the power of AI? What best practices are organizations adopting now around the ethics and safety of AI? What questions should you be asking? What should you do now to prepare for possible laws and regulations? You are invited to join in this conversation. RSVP today:\n\nWhile the debate is still overly vague due to the reliance solely on principle-based frameworks, there's a nod here toward the importance of context when assessing AI risk. Ethics can look very different when AI is implemented in a business versus a public sector environment. The actual harm that an AI system can cause depends heavily on when, where, and how it's being used. Similarly, there's such a narrow focus on the technology itself that other critical elements, such as policy, training, and management, need to be prioritized. If you're a leader charged with implementing AI, consider looking to NIST's Risk Management Framework as a starting place for planning.\n\nToday our CTO Jay Nanduri spoke on a panel at Seattle University‚Äôs Ethics & Tech Conference about how technology can responsibly help the healthcare industry. Jay shared this guidance, which also informs how we‚Äôre training the Truveta Language Model: ‚ÄúAn AI model is only as good as the data it‚Äôs trained on; if the data has bias, the model will have bias. So we need to take great care to ensure the most diverse, representative, quality data possible, to ensure our models are not biased.‚Äù\n\nThis is hands down my favourite survey we're run this year! How empathetic can artificial intelligence be? What services do consumers trust AI to handle and what are their thoughts on AI-generated content? Learn more about trust, ethics, and consumer perceptions of artificial intelligence in this research report.\n\nNew Episode Alert: AI Unleashed - Navigating Business and Ethics with Giovanni Leoni üöÄ Join Jack and the Head of Business Strategy & Development at Credo AI: Giovanni Leoni, for a journey into the heart of AI's impact on business and ethics. From accelerating insights to navigating the need for governance and understanding potential EU regulations, this episode dives deep into the critical balance between innovation and responsibility. Giovanni sheds light on how AI can drive resource optimization and create abundance, while also tackling the challenges of deepfakes and the quest for truth in the digital age. Don't miss this insightful exploration at the crossroads of technology and ethics. Tune in now and let's unleash the potential of AI together. https://lnkd.in/difXBGZc #SCIPodcast #AIUnleashed #BusinessEthics #ArtificialIntelligence #aipower #humanizingbusiness üåêüí°"
