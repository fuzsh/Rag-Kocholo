(1) A monitor may reproduce no more than two excerpts of up to a maximum of 10 minutes each of any CBRA program, as well as the portion of CBRA signal on which the excerpt is embedded.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), in any given year, up to a maximum of 10 per cent of excerpts of CBRA programs provided to all government users on audiotape, 10 per cent of excerpts of CBRA programs provided to all government users on videotape, 10 per cent of excerpts of CBRA programs provided to all government users on other physical media, 10 per cent of excerpts of CBRA programs provided to all government users pursuant to subsection 7(1) [listening over the telephone], 10 per cent of excerpts of CBRA programs provided to all government users pursuant to subsection 7(2) [email attachments] and 10 per cent of excerpts of CBRA programs provided to all government users pursuant to section 8 [database access] may exceed the limits set out in subsection (1).\n\n6. A monitor may provide to a government user copies, on any physical medium, of an excerpt made in accordance with section 5.\n\n7. (1) Subject to subsection (3), a monitor may allow a government user who requires immediate access to listen over the telephone to a recording of an excerpt made in accordance with section 5.\n\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), a monitor may send to a government user who requires immediate access a video excerpt made in accordance with section 5 as an email attachment with a resolution no greater than 320 pixels by 240 pixels and with a frame rate no greater than 15 frames per second.\n\n(3) The number of CBRA items provided pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) each year cannot exceed 10 per cent of the total number of CBRA items the monitor provides to all government users in any year.\n\n8. (1) Subject to subsection (2), a monitor may include transcripts and video excerpts of CBRA programs in a password-secured database.\n\n(2) The operation of a database referred to in subsection (1) shall be subject to the following conditions:\n\n(a) only excerpts made in accordance with section 5 or received in accordance with section 10 shall be included in the database;\n\n(b) excerpts shall have a resolution no greater than 320 pixels by 240 pixels and a frame rate no greater than 15 frames per second;\n\n(c) excerpts shall be removed from the database no later than six months after they are broadcast;\n\n(d) a government user may download an excerpt; however, a monitor shall not allow anyone to reproduce, perform, communicate (which includes broadcast, download, email or transmit), display, distribute or make available any excerpts by any means whatsoever, although a government user may circulate them internally by means that are strictly internal;\n\n(e) CBRA shall be entitled to review and approve all security and other elements of the database and the monitor’s provision of viewing access to excerpts, to determine whether access can be provided without excerpts being reproduced, performed, communicated, displayed, distributed or made available; and\n\n(f) CBRA shall have free access to the database for the purposes set out in paragraph (e) and in order to determine the contents of the database at any given time.\n\n(3) The number of excerpts downloaded pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(d) cannot exceed 10 per cent of the total number of CBRA items the monitor provides to all government users in any year.\n\n9. A monitor may create and make available to government users monitoring notes, summary notes or transcripts of CBRA programs in any form.\n\n10. A monitor is entitled to do an act described in sections 6 to 9 with respect to any CBRA item it receives from a commercial media monitor acting pursuant to a CBRA licence.\n\n11. (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (4), a monitor shall destroy anything it possesses or controls that was made pursuant to sections 4 to 9 no later than six months after the day the relevant program or signal was broadcast.\n\n(2) A monitor shall destroy a transcript or copy of a transcript of a CBRA program no later than 10 years after the day the transcript was made.\n\n(3) A monitor may keep monitoring notes and summary notes of a CBRA program indefinitely.\n\n(4) A monitor may, with the authorization of a CBRA broadcaster, keep anything made pursuant to this tariff that embodies a program or signal that is owned or controlled by that broadcaster.\n\n12. (1) This tariff entitles a monitor to provide or make available CBRA items or services related to CBRA items only to government users.\n\n(2) Before a monitor provides or makes available any CBRA item to a government user, the monitor shall ensure that the government user has agreed in writing to the following conditions:\n\n(a) the government user shall use CBRA items only for its own private, non-commercial internal review and analysis;\n\n(b) the government user shall not perform, reproduce, communicate (which includes broadcast, download, email or transmit), display, distribute or make available any part of a CBRA item by any means whatsoever, but may circulate internally a CBRA item by means that are strictly internal;\n\n(c) the government user shall not copy, show or provide any part of a CBRA item to any other person, except as the monitor may specifically authorize in the case of reproductions of paper copies of transcripts;\n\n(d) the government user shall not use any part of a CBRA item in connection with any legal, regulatory or administrative proceeding, political campaign or meeting of a political nature, for marketing, advertising, publicity, endorsements or promotional purposes, or for any purpose that is contrary to law;\n\n(e) the government user shall not use a CBRA item in any manner that is not allowed pursuant to this tariff; and\n\n(f) the government user shall acknowledge that all rights, including copyright, in an excerpt or transcript of a CBRA program are the sole property of the relevant CBRA broadcaster.\n\n(3) A monitor shall not knowingly provide or make available a CBRA item to anyone who intends to contravene any of the terms set out in subsection (2).\n\n13. A monitor shall ensure that any CBRA item it provides, any computer interface used to access a database and any email message to which an excerpt of a CBRA program is attached has a clear statement, label or video lead-in stating the following:\n\n“Copyright protected and owned by broadcaster. Your licence is limited to private, internal, non-commercial use. All reproduction, broadcast, transmission or other use of this work is strictly prohibited.”\n\n14. A CBRA broadcaster, or CBRA at its direction, may, by notifying a monitor in writing, restrict the use of a CBRA item if the broadcaster believes that this could raise a legal issue or result in liability.\n\n15. (1) If a CBRA broadcaster broadcasts a correction, clarification or similar statement regarding the content of a CBRA program, a monitor, upon receiving a written notice to that effect, shall immediately provide a copy of the statement to each government user who had access to a CBRA item derived from that program.\n\n(2) No royalties are payable with respect to any CBRA item in respect of which a statement is supplied pursuant to subsection (1).\n\n(3) A monitor shall be entitled to deduct from its CBRA-related monitoring costs the costs it incurs to make and send any statement supplied pursuant to subsection (1).\n\nROYALTIES\n\n16. (1) Each semester, a monitor shall pay to CBRA a royalty equal to 14 per cent of the monitor’s CBRA-related monitoring costs for the previous semester.\n\n(2) Royalties payable pursuant to subsection (1) shall be paid no later than the first day of the third month of the semester.\n\n(3) Royalties payable under this tariff are exclusive of any federal, provincial or other governmental taxes or levies of any kind.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS\n\nReporting Requirements: Monitors\n\n17. (1) When a royalty payment is due, a monitor shall also provide to CBRA the following information in respect of the previous semester:\n\n(a) the name and address of the monitor;\n\n(b) the name, call letters and network affiliation (if any) of each CBRA signal monitored;\n\n(c) the monitor’s CBRA-related monitoring costs and the royalties attributable to each CBRA signal; and\n\n(d) the monitor’s CBRA-related monitoring costs and the royalties attributable to each CBRA program.\n\n(2) Within 60 days of the end of a year, a monitor shall provide to CBRA, with respect to that year, a list of government users and sufficient information to determine the monitor’s compliance with subsections 5(2) and 7(3).\n\nErrors\n\n18. A monitor that discovers an error in any information provided to CBRA shall promptly provide the correct information.\n\nReporting Requirements: CBRA\n\n19. (1) Subject to subsection (2), CBRA shall, upon request, provide a monitor with an updated version of the list of CBRA signals set out in the Appendix.\n\n(2) If the information set out in subsection (1) is available on a website that is updated at least once a month if required, CBRA may, instead of complying with subsection (1), provide the monitor with the information required to access that website.\n\nRecords and Audits\n\n20. (1) A monitor shall keep and preserve, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and for a period of six years from the end of the relevant year, accounts and records from which CBRA can readily ascertain the amounts payable and the information required under this tariff, including\n\n(a) the calculation of its CBRA-related monitoring costs;\n\n(b) each time a monitor uses or provides a CBRA item, the name and address of the government user and the call letters of the signal; and\n\n(c) each time a monitor uses or provides a CBRA item, the title of the program, as well as the date, time and duration of the item.\n\n(2) CBRA may audit these records at any time, on reasonable notice and during normal business hours.\n\n(3) If an audit discloses that royalties due to CBRA were understated in any semester by more than 5 per cent, the monitor shall pay the reasonable costs of the audit within 30 days of the demand for payment being made.\n\nConfidentiality\n\n21. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), information received pursuant to this tariff shall be treated in confidence, unless the monitor that supplied the information consents in writing to the information being treated otherwise.\n\n(2) Information referred to in subsection (1) can be shared\n\n(a) to comply with this tariff;\n\n(b) with CBRA’s professional advisers, if their rules of professional conduct require them to treat the information in confidence or if they agree in writing to maintain such information in confidence;\n\n(c) with the Copyright Board;\n\n(d) in connection with proceedings before the Copyright Board, if CBRA has first provided a reasonable opportunity for the monitor providing the information to request a confidentiality order;\n\n(e) to the extent required to effect the distribution of royalties, with a CBRA broadcaster; or\n\n(f) if required by law or by a court of law.\n\n(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to information that is publicly available, to information obtained from someone other than the undertaking and who is not under an apparent duty of confidentiality to that undertaking or to information that has been aggregated so as to prevent the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.\n\nAdjustments\n\n22. (1) Subject to subsection (2), adjustments in the amount of royalties owed by a monitor (including excess payments), as a result of the discovery of an error or otherwise, shall be made on the date the monitor’s next royalty payment is due.\n\n(2) A monitor may deduct any amount owed to it from its next payments to CBRA until no money remains owed to it.\n\nInterest on Late Payments\n\n23. (1) Any amount not received by CBRA by the due date shall bear interest from that date until the date the amount is received.\n\n(2) Any amount found to be owing to CBRA, through an audit or otherwise, shall bear interest from the date it was due until the date the amount is received.\n\n(3) Interest shall be calculated daily at a rate equal to one per cent above the Bank Rate effective on the last day of the previous month (as published by the Bank of Canada). Interest shall not compound.\n\nAddresses for Notices\n\n24. (1) Anything that a monitor sends to CBRA shall be sent to 4115 Canyon Walk Drive, Ottawa, Ontario, K1V 1P8 or to any other address of which the monitor has been notified in writing.\n\n(2) Anything that CBRA sends to a monitor shall be sent to the address provided by the monitor in accordance with paragraph 17(1)(a) or, where no such address has been provided, to any other address where the monitor can be reached.\n\nDelivery of Notices and Payments\n\n25. (1) A notice may be delivered by hand, by postage-paid mail or by fax.\n\n(2) A notice or payment mailed in Canada shall be presumed to have been received three business days after the day it was mailed.\n\n(3) A notice sent by fax shall be presumed to have been received the day it is transmitted.\n\nAppointment of Designate\n\n26. (1) Any person that CBRA designates to receive a payment or notice shall have an address in Canada.\n\n(2) CBRA shall notify a monitor at least 60 days in advance of such a designation or of any change therein.\n\nExemptions Regarding Below-Threshold Media Monitoring Costs\n\n27. (1) In this section, “total media monitoring costs” means the monitor’s gross costs for the monitoring, fixation, reproduction, use or provision of any program or signal, as well as for any research or activity that relates to any such program or signal. Those costs include, without limitation, (i) salaries and wages of all staff and managers, (ii) operating expenses, including equipment, leases, rent, office supplies, software leases or licences and telephone and network charges, and (iii) capital expenditures, including computers, video-recorders and other equipment. They exclude applicable taxes, actual out-of-pocket cost for recording media, their labelling and delivery charges, and any amount paid by the monitor to a commercial media monitor acting pursuant to a CBRA licence for any CBRA item.\n\n(2) Subsections (3) to (7) apply in a year to a monitor that, no later than January 31 of that year, delivers to CBRA a statement certified as accurate and signed by a senior officer of the monitor that in the officer’s good faith view, the monitor’s total media monitoring costs for that year shall be less than $100,000 and that the monitor wishes to avail itself of section 27 of this tariff.\n\n(3) A monitor that complied with subsection (2) shall provide the information set out in paragraph 17(1)(d) only if the monitor has that information.\n\n(4) Paragraph 20(1)(c) does not apply to a monitor that has complied with subsection (2).\n\n(5) As soon as its total media monitoring costs exceed $100,000 in the relevant year, a monitor that has complied with subsection (2) shall notify CBRA of this occurrence. That monitor shall not be entitled to avail itself of this section for the rest of the relevant year and shall instead comply with the other provisions of this tariff.\n\n(6) A monitor that has complied with subsection (2) and that has not delivered a notice pursuant to subsection (5) shall deliver to CBRA, on or before January 31 of the next year, a statement certified as accurate and signed by a senior officer of the monitor setting out the monitor’s total media monitoring costs for the relevant year.\n\n(7) A monitor that complied with subsection (2) and whose total media monitoring costs for the relevant year exceeded $100,000 may not avail itself again of subsection (2) without the written authorization of CBRA.\n\nGENERAL\n\nIndemnity\n\n28. (1) A monitor shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless CBRA, CBRA broadcasters and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, licensees and assigns from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, cost, damage or expense including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees that they may incur if\n\n(a) the monitor breaches any provision of this tariff;\n\n(b) the monitor does any act protected by copyright that is not authorized by this tariff;\n\n(c) the monitor uses a CBRA item after having received a notice pursuant to section 14; or\n\n(d) a monitor’s government user breaches any condition set out in subsection 12(2).\n\n(2) A monitor’s obligations pursuant to subsection (1) are not affected by the right of approval granted to CBRA pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(e).\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1), CBRA or the relevant CBRA broadcaster may avail itself of any recourse it may have against a government user who breaches any condition set out in subsection 12(2).\n\n29. CBRA shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the monitor, its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, licensees and assigns from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, cost, damage or expense including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees which they may suffer or incur by reason of a failure by CBRA to comply with this tariff or of an inaccuracy in the information supplied pursuant to section 19.\n\nDefault\n\n30. (1) A monitor whose royalties CBRA has not received within five business days of the date the royalties are due pursuant to subsection 16(2) is not entitled to do any of the acts described in sections 4 to 10 from the first day of the semester in respect of which the royalties should have been paid until the monitor pays the royalties and the accrued interest.\n\n(2) A monitor that fails to comply with any other provision of this tariff is not entitled to do any of the acts described in sections 4 to 10 as of five business days after CBRA has notified the monitor in writing of that failure and until the monitor remedies that failure.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nCALL LETTERS OR NAMES OF TELEVISION AND RADIO SIGNALS OF CBRA BROADCASTERS\n\nTELEVISION\n\nCFAP\n\nCFCF\n\nCFCM\n\nCFCM-DT\n\nCFCN\n\nCFCN-TV5\n\nCFEM\n\nCFER\n\nCFER-TV2\n\nCFGS\n\nCFHD\n\nCFJC\n\nCFJP\n\nCFJP-DT\n\nCFKM\n\nCFKS\n\nCFMT\n\nCFPL\n\nCFQC\n\nCFRE\n\nCFRN\n\nCFRN-TV6\n\nCFRS\n\nCFSK\n\nCFTF\n\nCFTK\n\nCFTM\n\nCFTM-DT\n\nCFTO\n\nCFVS\n\nCH5248\n\nCHAN\n\nCHAT\n\nCHAU\n\nCHBC\n\nCHBX\n\nCHCH\n\nCHCO-TV\n\nCHEK Courtenay/Comox/ Campbell River/CH13\n\nCHEK Port Alberni CH11\n\nCHEK Sook CH13\n\nCHEK Victoria CH6\n\nCHEM\n\nCHET\n\nCHEX\n\nCHEX-TV 2\n\nCHFD\n\nCHLT\n\nCHLT-DT\n\nCHMG\n\nCHMI\n\nCHNM\n\nCHNU\n\nCHOT\n\nCHRO\n\nCHVC\n\nCHWI\n\nCICA\n\nCICC\n\nCICI\n\nCICO\n\nCICT\n\nCIHF\n\nCIII\n\nCIIT\n\nCIMC\n\nCIMT\n\nCIPA\n\nCISA\n\nCITL\n\nCITO\n\nCITS\n\nCITS-DT\n\nCITV\n\nCITY\n\nCIVI\n\nCIVT\n\nCJCB\n\nCJCH\n\nCJCO\n\nCJDC\n\nCJEO\n\nCJIL\n\nCJMT\n\nCJNT-DT\n\nCJOH\n\nCJON\n\nCJPM\n\nCJPM-TV1\n\nCKAL\n\nCKCK\n\nCKCO\n\nCKCS\n\nCKCW\n\nCKEM\n\nCKES\n\nCKLT\n\nCKMI\n\nCKND\n\nCKNY\n\nCKPG\n\nCKPR\n\nCKRN\n\nCKRT\n\nCKSA\n\nCKVR\n\nCKVU\n\nCKWS\n\nCKY\n\nCSCN-DT\n\nABC Spark\n\nAboriginal Peoples Television Network\n\nAction\n\nAddik TV\n\nAnimal Planet Canada\n\nBBC Canada\n\nBNN Bloomberg\n\nBook Television\n\nBravo!\n\nCanal D\n\nCanal Vie\n\nCartoon Network\n\nCASA\n\nCinépop\n\nCMT\n\nComedy Gold\n\nCooking Channel\n\nCosmo TV\n\nCP24\n\nCrave\n\nCrime + Investigation\n\nCTV News Channel\n\nDeja View\n\nDisney Channel EN\n\nDisney Channel FR\n\nDisney Junior\n\nDisney XD\n\nDiscovery\n\nDiscovery Science\n\nDiscovery Velocity\n\nDIY Network\n\nDTOUR\n\nE!\n\nELLE Fictions\n\nESPN Classic Canada\n\nFairchild TV\n\nFashion Television\n\nFood Network Canada\n\nFXC\n\nFXX\n\nFYI\n\nGlobal News: BC1\n\nGusto\n\nH2\n\nHBO Canada\n\nHGTV Canada\n\nHistoria\n\nHistory\n\nIFC Canada\n\nInvestigation (Canal d’investigation)\n\nInvestigation Discovery\n\nLCN\n\nLifetime\n\nMaTV\n\nMax (Musimax)\n\nMétéoMédia\n\nMovie Time\n\nRewind (Movieola – The Short Film Channel)\n\nMTV\n\nMTV2\n\nNat Geo Wild\n\nNational Geographic Canada Channel\n\nNick Canada\n\nOMNI Regional\n\nOWN\n\nOutdoor Life Network\n\nPrise 2\n\nRDS / RDS2\n\nRDSI (RDS Info)\n\nRewind\n\nSeries+\n\nSHAW TV\n\nShowcase\n\nSilver Screen Classics\n\nSlice\n\nSN2\n\nSpace\n\nSportsnet\n\nSportsnet One\n\nSportsnet 360 (The Score)\n\nStarz\n\nStingray Juicebox\n\nStingray Loud\n\nStingray Retro\n\nStingray Vibe\n\nSuper Écran\n\nTalentvision\n\nTECH TV\n\nTeletoon English\n\nTeletoon French\n\nThe Comedy Network\n\nThe Weather Network\n\nTreehouse TV\n\nTSN / TSN2\n\nTVA Sports\n\nViceland\n\nVrak TV\n\nW Network\n\nW Movies\n\nYOOPA\n\nYTV\n\nZ (Z Télé)\n\nRADIO"
