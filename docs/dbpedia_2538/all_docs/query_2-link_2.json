        "text": "ClickSoftware CEO: Amazing momentum\n\n24/02/2014, 14:59\n\nRon Steinblatt\n\nMoshe BenBassat talks to \"Globes\" about how his SaaS product is taking off.\n\nClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CKSW), a provider of automated mobile workforce management and optimization solutions for the service industry, has had steady double-digit revenue growth and handsome net profits in the past few years. However, something changed in 2013: it published a revenue warning and swung to a loss, underwent upheaval in its executive, and its share price fell to a three-year low.\n\nClickSoftware has taken 2014 by storm. In January, it announced that revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013 would be higher than expected, and later provided higher than expected full-year guidance for 2014, which boosted the share price. If that were not enough, last week, it made the largest ever acquisition in its history.\n\nIn an interview with \"Globes\", ClickSoftware founder and CEO Dr. Moshe BenBassat explains the change in the company's revenue model, which caused last year's volatility, how the acquisition fits in with the company's strategy, and why COO Hannan Carmeli left the company two months after being appointed co-CEO.\n\n\"Most of our customers to date generated between $500,000 and $2 million revenue for us from software sales and upgrades. Before 2013, the big companies did not buy our cloud software solutions, through which we offer as Software as a Service (SaaS) on a use basis, even though it was part of our products offering,\" says BenBassat.\n\n\"Last year began slowly, but the momentum in the last quarter was amazing. We signed with 19 customers, including 10 in the cloud. Not only did more than half of the new customers choose the cloud service, but in an ordinary quarter, we would normally sign up 8-12 new customers.\"\n\nThis change, in which more customers switched to ClickSoftware's SaaS cloud offering, had an major effect on the company's revenue. Instead of a large one-time payment from the buyer of the software, the company has switched to receiving small, but steady, monthly payments over time, similar to a leasing contract.\n\nAs a consequence, ClickSoftware's revenue guidance in early 2013, which projected $120-125 million revenue (up to 25% growth over 2012), turned out to be overoptimistic, resulting in two revenue warnings later in the year.\n\n\"In early 2013, we didn’t know that the flow of customers to the cloud would increase at the expense of legacy systems. This took us by surprise. In addition, the nature of the deals, which were smaller, had an effect,\" says BenBassat explaining the gap between the guidance and actual results. \"Altogether, we added 24 cloud customers during 2013, which was strong growth compared with the nine customers in 2012. This helps us create future revenue flow, while we continue sales to our traditional customers, which will also contribute to growth in 2014.\"\n\nThe increase in cloud customers during the fourth quarter boosted ClickSoftware's share price. \"The capital market will not judge us on the basis of our revenue in dollars, but on the number of new customers,\" says BenBassat.\n\n\"Globes\": Will the change in the revenue structure change the expenses structure?\n\nBenBassat: \"We're running all the cloud infrastructures on Amazon servers, on the basis of use. There is congruence between what we charge the customer and the amount we pay Amazon. This is a variable expense in line with variable income.\"\n\nAlthough ClickSoftware's revenue did not increase in 2013, its expenses did, resulting in a GAAP-based net loss of $4.2 million. \"In 2013, we established offices in Brazil and Russia. There is no revenue yet, but there will be an impact in the coming years. In Russia, we work with Moscow City Telephone Network (MGTS), the city's largest telephone company. In Brazil, we work with Oi Group, the country's largest infrastructure company, and with Nextel.\"\n\nClickSoftware had $58 million in cash at the beginning of 2014, and in mid-February, the company decided to use it. It announced an acquisition that demonstrates how it is pinning its hopes on the cloud as its future growth engine. ClickSoftware announced the acquisition of US company Xora Inc. for $15 million in cash.\n\nWhy did you decide to acquire this company?\n\n\"Xora is an important strategic addition, which will boost our repeat income from cloud services. The combination of ClickSoftware's services, which target the high end of the mid-sized enterprise market with Xora's ready for use customized solutions, which target the lower end of the small and mid-sized enterprise market, will achieve our goal of offering a complete portfolio of products that meet all business needs of companies of every size.\"\n\nBenBassat adds that the acquisition \"will greatly expand our distribution channels.\"\n\nComplicating the decision-making process\n\nIn June 2013, ClickSoftware announced a change in its leadership, following more than 30 years in which BenBassat served as chairman and CEO. The company announced that president and COO Hannan Carmeli would begin serving as co-CEO alongside BenBassat. Their division of labor, according to the statement, would be, \"Dr. BenBassat will focus … on product innovation and strategic marketing, while Mr. Carmeli will … manage all field operations.\"\n\nCarmeli had worked with BenBassat for 17 years, since the days when the company was known as IET, and some investors understood his promotion as a smooth transition for passing the baton to him. But the tango as co-CEOs was very brief.\n\n\"Hannan and I worked for many years together, and we thought it would be possible to work as co-CEOs. After two months, we saw that this was a hindrance to decision-making at the company, and we decided that it was better for one man to make the decisions,\" explains BenBassat.\n\nCarmeli, who realized that there no way to go higher in the company, decided to leave. Another change in ClickSoftware's leadership in the past year was the appointment of Israel Borovich, a controlling shareholder in Knafaim Holdings Ltd. (TASE: KNFM), as chairman, after serving as a director for many years.\n\nClickSoftware has been periodically mentioned as a candidate for acquisition by one of the world's large software companies.\n\nIf a buyer offers a good price for the company, would you advise the board of directors to sell it?\n\n\"There are settled rules for this matter. If an offer is made, the board of directors must respectfully consider it.\"\n\nHave there been offers in recent years?\n\n\"I cannot comment on that. It's confidential. A party submitting an acquisition offer does so under a confidentiality agreement.\"\n\nPublished by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on February 24, 2014\n\nClickSoftware Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Xora Inc.\n\n--Acquisition Extends ClickSoftware's Leadership in Cloud-based Solutions for Mobile Workers; --Considerably Broadens Distribution Channels via Major Carriers; --Strengthens Small & Medium Size Businesses (SMB) Offering\n\nBURLINGTON, Mass., Feb. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- ClickSoftware\n\nTechnologies Ltd. (nasdaqgs:CKSW), the leading provider of automated mobile workforce management and optimization solutions for the service industry, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xora Inc., a cloud-based market leader in mobile workforce management, by merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the consideration for the transaction is approximately $14.7 million in cash, plus working capital and cash adjustments. The closing is subject to certain closing conditions and purchase price adjustments, and is expected to occur in the coming weeks.\n\nXora, Inc., based in Mountain View, California, provides software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for companies whose success depends on the productivity and efficiency of 'always mobile' workers. Xora delivers its solutions to more than 130,000 users and is one of North America's largest providers of mobile workforce management solutions. The company was recognized by Frost & Sullivan in 2012 with the Market Share Leadership Award for its intuitive StreetSmart application that helps companies, across a wide variety of industries, to more effectively manage the activities and performance of their employees in the field. Among Xora's distinguished partners are US leading carriers such as Verizon, AT&T and Sprint.\n\nThe combination of Xora and ClickSoftware creates a company with breadth and depth for a much bigger market under one roof. ClickSoftware strengthens its leadership position by offering customers a broader range of cloud-based mobile workforce management apps. Xora benefits from ClickSoftware's international presence and access to service resource optimization products. This acquisition will also extend ClickSoftware's market reach into the SMB (Small and Medium Businesses) market and opens a distribution channel through leading wireless carriers. ClickSoftware, which was already managing the largest community of mobile workers, will now add the 130,000 users of Xora to its more than 500,000 user base and will distance itself further ahead from the competition.\n\n\"The acquisition of Xora is an important and strategic addition to our mobile workforce management business and accelerates our cloud recurring revenues,\" said Dr. Moshe BenBassat, ClickSoftware's Founder and CEO. \"The visions and cultures of both companies are perfectly aligned, bringing together the management of mobile workers, tasks, and physical assets such as equipment and vehicles. By combining ClickSoftware's sophisticated, highly configurable offerings for the large and higher end of the mid-size enterprise market with Xora's suite of configurable, ready-to-use solutions for the lower end of the mid-size and small business market, we achieve the strategic objective to offer a complete portfolio of best-in-class mobile apps for all business roles, in all size companies, in all industry verticals. Xora's extensive and long term experience selling packaged apps through the wireless carriers like AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, considerably expands our distribution channels. We welcome Xora's CEO Anne Bonaparte and her technology savvy professional team to the ClickSoftware family.\"\n\n\"I am very excited to have Xora become part of ClickSoftware and our future together. Our companies share a focus on customer success, leading-edge technology and innovation,\" said Anne Bonaparte, Xora's CEO. \"Becoming part of the ClickSoftware team serves to extend Xora's impact and global reach.\"\n\nResearch from Frost & Sullivan indicates that the market for Mobile Workforce Management Solutions will continue to grow, and estimates that annual North American revenues will grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 40.5% to reach almost $3 billion by 2018. The research also indicates that market penetration remains low, with 45% of businesses planning to introduce or expand mobile application deployment over the next three years (Source: Mobile Workforce Management Market: Prepackaged Mobile Field-Based Worker Applications in North America, Frost & Sullivan report NC4B-65, December 2013). The acquisition of Xora is intended to enable ClickSoftware to quickly expand its access to this growing market and extend its market leading position.\n\n\"Combining ClickSoftware and Xora is just the type of acquisition that will contribute to the high rate of growth in the market of mobile workforce management solutions. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity in this market, and this acquisition positions ClickSoftware to reap a healthy portion of it,\" said Jeanine Sterling, Principal Analyst at Frost & Sullivan. \"There are a multitude of benefits that make this development between two market leaders a mutual win, mostly based on synergies in product capabilities, target markets, and channel relationships. Our mobile enterprise applications research shows a steady migration of customers toward cloud-based solutions. This deal will accelerate ClickSoftware's ability to satisfy this preference -- with both its new and embedded customers. Distribution relationships should also expand in a good way. Xora has created and nurtured strong channel partnerships with Tier 1 wireless carriers, which should nicely complement ClickSoftware's own partner and distribution efforts, providing a mutual opportunity to expand distribution.\"\n\nManagement Conference Call ClickSoftware will host a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. EST to discuss this transaction, as well as answer questions from the investment community.

ClickContact enables automatic, on-going communication with the customer throughout the service lifecycle, including real-time communication on the day of service, thereby reducing the uncertainty of the technician's expected arrival time.\n\nRelated Quotes\n\nSymbol Price Change\n\nCKSW 7.03 +0.29\n\n{\"s\" : \"cksw\",\"k\" : \"c10,l10,p20,t10\",\"o\" : \"\",\"j\" : \"\"} Integrated with ClickContact, BackFlip's solution for ISV's is designed to help service organizations improve customer service by enabling timelier and more convenient communication with their customers, service agents and technicians. ClickSoftware partnered with BackFlip Software to provide service organizations the ability to offer an improved level of service and a superior customer experience by offering bi-directional, personalized multi-channel customer interaction. With both companies' solutions based on Service Oriented Architecture, integration was developed using industry standards and open API's.\n\nBy providing multi-channel communications, service organizations demonstrate respect for their customers' time and increase customer loyalty and satisfaction. Real-time appointment confirmations provided by ClickContact allow service organizations to offer their customers minimal appointment windows so that they are no longer \"chained\" to the service location waiting for the service technician to arrive. While dramatically improving the customer experience, ClickContact also helps service businesses reduce customer \"no-shows\" which require a costly second technician visit to complete the work order.\n\nThe new ClickContact solution also enables service organizations to offer their customers the ability to book and manage their own service appointments via a self-service module. Users can also select their preferred means of communication through which they would like to receive notification messages and interact with the service organization. As a result, service providers and their customers now have complete visibility into the process and a seamless and easy way to interact and communicate with their end-customers. Thus, the combined ClickContact and BackFlip solution offers the customer more control of the service experience and offers the service provider significant efficiency gains by reducing the volume of calls into the call center.\n\n\"BackFlip capabilities enable us to offer our customers a more comprehensive service management solution including end-customer bi-directional communications and control of the service experience,\" said Hannan Carmeli, President and Chief Operating Officer at ClickSoftware. \"By facilitating better communication between the customer and the service organization before the time of service, customers are better informed about the upcoming visit and more satisfied. Costly customer no-shows are also greatly reduced.\"\n\nBackFlip is the first communication service to provide a secured multi-channel environment for user-to-system and system-to-user communications through voice, instant messaging, text messaging, mobile browsing, enterprise and consumer portals, RSS feeds, IP Phones, desktop widgets and email technologies.

The bank is also deploying ClickAnalyze Insight to gain detailed information on service efficiency and identify opportunities to improve future performance.\n\nWith more than 30,000 employees across thousands of locations in over a dozen states, the bank has a dedicated team of technicians responsible for telephone set maintenance, router installation, and repairing everything from laptops to desktops, network switches and data servers. Job urgency ranges from routine maintenance to emergencies affecting thousands of employees. Previously, the company occasionally struggled to efficiently schedule its field technicians using a manual system, sometimes causing employees and/or customers to wait.\n\n\"You don't typically think of banks as having large field service teams, but a national bank's field technicians help to keep customer-facing and internal systems operating at peak performance,\" said ClickSoftware Vice President of Marketing Operations Simon Morris. \"This sale not only validates ClickSoftware's fast-growing sales channel, but it also highlights our commitment to delivering a mid-market solution that makes it easy and affordable to take advantage of mobile workforce optimization.\"\n\nClickIMRS provides the automated scheduling and work order management that takes the guesswork out of determining which technician with what skills to send to which job when. The software deploys rapidly because it was designed and configured specifically to meet the needs of installation, maintenance and repair services. ClickIMRS features pre-configured scheduling and mobile functionality that virtually eliminates the expense, time and effort typically required to custom-design and program schedules.\n\nThe mobility features in ClickIMRS will ensure the bank's IT managers and field technicians have the most updated information about job status, priorities, history, location, etc. The solution wirelessly connects field service technicians via their handheld devices to job ticket information for field activities and tasks. Technicians can also quickly update dispatchers and managers as to job status, location and delays.\n\nStreet-level-routing features ensure field technicians take the most efficient routes between jobs to increase productivity and reduce travel time. The bank will use ClickAnalyze Insight business analytics software to enable managers to track key performance indicators such as arrival time, productivity, second visits, travel time, etc. They'll use that information to measure performance and identify trends that could become problematic down the road.\n\nThis regional bank relies on authorized ClickSoftware value-added reseller Diabsolut, Inc. for software implementation, training and support.\n\n\"We deal with many clients who struggle with the burden of under-utilized field personnel, excessive usage of their fleets, and the ever-increasing cost of fuel,\" said Diabsolut President and CEO Joe Diab. \"With their tightening budgets, there is a pressing need to do more with less. Our newest client shares these challenges and prefers to remain nameless, as they strongly believe that ClickIMRS will permit them to have a clear competitive advantage over their competition.\"\n\nClickSoftware's Mid-Market Move Gathers Momentum With Global VARs, Customers\n\nThursday July 10, 10:11 am ET\n\nClickSoftware's Comprehensive Field Service Management and Optimization Software for Mid-Sized Companies Delivers Affordability, Fast Deployment\n\nHOUSTON, July 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- A bigger global sales channel, more customers and a growing need for comprehensive field service optimization software for mid-size service organizations are driving momentum for ClickSoftware for Installation, Maintenance and Repair Services (ClickIMRS), announced ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CKSW - News) today at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference. This momentum underscores ClickSoftware's commitment to delivering automated decision support and optimization technology that helps service organizations with anywhere from 20 to 500 mobile resources boost productivity, increase revenues and cut costs.\n\nClickIMRS is the industry's first affordable, comprehensive field service management and optimization software that can be deployed in less than 70 days. Previously, mid-sized companies with up to 500 field resources were forced to choose between rudimentary manual/paper-based systems that often led to scheduling problems and enterprise software they couldn't afford. ClickIMRS bridges the gap, enabling these companies to increase jobs per day, ensure on-time arrival, reduce time per job, minimize travel, respond to emergencies more efficiently and strengthen customer relationships.\n\nA growing list of authorized ClickSoftware channel partners, including Diabsolut Inc., Aspective, Green Beacon and TSI have recognized the gap in the market that ClickIMRS addresses and are selling and implementing this solution. \"The market is ripe for ClickIMRS as mid-sized companies have struggled to increase their customers' satisfaction and loyalty while sustaining growth and profitability,\" said Joe Diab, president and CEO of Diabsolut. \"ClickSoftware has broken new ground with software that deploys quickly and easily, and fits within these companies' budgets.\"\n\nPre-configured for mid-sized companies\n\nBecause of the size of their service operations, large companies often customize the integration of ClickSoftware's ServiceOptimization Suite with their complex infrastructures, which can extend deployment time. ClickIMRS deploys in 70 days because it comes pre-configured to help mid-sized companies improve key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time arrivals and reduced customer complaints. Essentially, ClickIMRS enables mid-size service organizations to use best-in-class service optimization tools.\n\n\"The big advantage ClickIMRS has over other solutions is that it delivers out-of-the-box automated scheduling that mid-sized companies have long needed,\" said Steven Carr, president of TSI, ClickSoftware's newest reseller. \"Providing dispatchers with real-time information to make smart scheduling decisions will help these companies deliver on their service promises to customers.\"\n\nSome of the key features of ClickIMRS include:\n\n- pre-configured scheduling application with online and\n\noptimization capabilities;\n\n- online appointment booking optimization;\n\n- street-level routing geographic information system (GIS)\n\nsolution;\n\n- re-configured reporting based on most critical KPIs;\n\n- business-oriented configuration so companies can tune the system\n\nto their needs;\n\n- expedited data import utilities to speed deployment;\n\n- order management module that creates work orders from customer\n\ncalls and works with scheduling application to match a technician and\n\ntime to each customer call; and,\n\n- standard integration plug-ins for leading CRM and enterprise\n\nresource planning solutions.\n\n\"For more than 10 years, we've developed an expertise in selling and deploying complex workforce optimization solutions for the enterprise. We recognized, however, that to be successful in the huge mid-market sector we needed a product and a go-to-market approach that could address the typical attributes and acquisition/deployment habits of these companies: limited budgets, small windows for deployment and a need for robust workforce management software,\" said ClickSoftware COO Hannan Carmeli. \"ClickIMRS fits the need, and our channel go-to-market strategy proves attractive to Customers and candidate partners alike. We are extremely encouraged by the market response to this latest initiative.\"\n\nScottish Water Selects ClickSoftware to Improve Workforce Planning and Scheduling\n\nWednesday June 4, 8:00 am ET\n\nSolution Will Form Part of Their Field Force Transformation Program Designed to Enable the Water Utility to Increase Visibility and Control Across the Business While Improving the Productivity of the Field Resources\n\nBURLINGTON, Massachusetts, June 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (NasdaqCM: CKSW), the leading provider of mobile workforce management and service optimization solutions, today announced that Scottish Water has selected ClickSoftware's ServiceOptimization Suite to improve scheduling capabilities in Scottish Water's service organization.\n\nScottish Water is the fourth largest water and waste water services provider in the United Kingdom, serving around 5 million customers in 2.3 million households. . By implementing optimized scheduling, street level routing and real time analytics, Scottish Water is looking to improve visibility and control of their field workforce, drive down its operational costs and improve the level of service it gives to its customers.\n\n\"Customer service is at the very heart of everything that we do and we are always looking for ways in which we can improve the quality of service to our customers and overall efficiency,\" said Raymond Smith, Application Development Manager at Scottish Water. \"We conducted an extensive market evaluation of advance scheduling and workforce management suppliers through the European Journal and it soon became evident that ClickSoftware had the utilities domain expertise, functional capabilities, proven track record and vision to meet our needs both now and into the future.\"\n\nScottish Water will be implementing ClickSoftware's packaged solution for water companies. ClickSoftware for Water Utilities is a pre-configured application for handling all the different aspects that water and/or waste water companies are facing: from generation (water reservoirs), through infrastructure and distribution of the water, up to meter operations and meter reading. The solution enables companies to effectively balance the costs of maintenance (pro-active work) and break-fix (reactive work). In addition, the solution creates the ability to provide service that is compliant with current regulations, while also allowing customers to do more with existing resources and in line with corporate service goals and objectives.\n\nThe introduction of dynamic, real-time optimized scheduling will enable the vast majority of scheduling decisions to be handled automatically. This will allow the dispatchers to focus on the exceptional cases that require human intervention. At the same time, Scottish Water will be able to provide their customers with a greater level of service via narrow appointment slots that they will be able to commit to.\n\nAs well as optimized scheduling and street level routing, they will also be deploying ClickAnalyze Reports which is a tool that will allow Scottish Water stakeholders to create real time operational performance reports, monitor field force performance in real time, control service operations, including service level, customer appointments, associated costs and service revenues. These reports can be produced by each stakeholder easily within minutes.\n\n\"We recognized that our existing CRM/ERP solution had taken us as far as it could from an automation perspective but we wanted to move to the next level with real-time decision-support and optimization. This is particularly important as Scotland became the first country to introduce a competitive framework for the business water and sewerage sector,\" said Raymond Smith of Scottish Water. \"As well as the dynamic scheduling, ClickSoftware's Service Optimization Suite provides us with the ability to integrate forecasting and workforce planning capabilities enabling us to improve the service delivery process still further,\" he continued.\n\nAs part of the business transformation programme the ClickSoftware Water Package will be integrated to Scottish Water Work and Asset Management and CRM System. All planned maintenance as well as reactive work will be optimized. The solution is planned to be deployed across 6 business streams including Repair and Maintenance, Electrical and Mechanical, Network Service Operative, Choke Squads, Reinstatement, and Sludge Management.\n\n\"We are delighted to welcome Scottish Water into our customer community,\" said Dr. Moshe BenBassat, founder and CEO of ClickSoftware. \"With revenue potential all but capped by rigid service areas, doing more with less is important in the water utility industry. ClickSoftware is fast establishing itself as the mobile workforce management solution of choice for water companies across the UK and beyond. Our pre-configured packaged solution creates the ability to provide service that is compliant with current regulations, while also allowing companies to do more with existing resources and in line with corporate service goals and objectives\"."
