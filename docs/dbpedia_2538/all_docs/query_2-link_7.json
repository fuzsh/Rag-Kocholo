        "meta_description": "The family of Donald Sommerfeld is sad to announce his passing away on Friday, November 12 at Cypress Regional Hospital, Swift Current with his wife of 68 years, Marie, at his side.  Donald was born to Peter P Sommerfeld and Mary (Marquard) Sommerfeld in Wymark, Saskatchewan on May 25, 1929.  Donald grew up on the family farm north and east of Wymark, the second youngest in a family of five.  He shared many stories of fun, adventure, hard work and family relationships from those years.  Donald met the woman who was to become his wife when Marie Friesen came to Wymark as the Grades 5-8 teacher in 1951.  Donald and Marie were married on August 2, 1953, and welcomed their baby daughter, Gayle Brenda, one year later.  They buried an infant daughter, Wenda, the following year and welcomed their son, Terrence Donald to complete their family the year after that. Donald is predeceased by his parents, Peter and Mary Sommerfeld, his siblings Helen (Henry) Derksen, Flora (Leonard)Dyck, Art (Mary), infant sister Linda and youngest brother, Gordon. He is survived by his wife Marie, sister-in-law Anne Sommerfeld, brother-in-law Walter (Hilda) Friesen, and nieces and nephews.  Donald leaves to mourn his passing his children, Terry (Tracey) and their children, Joshua and James, and his daughter Gayle (Michael Epp) and their children Sara (Brian McGrath), Jared (Yvonne), Mark (Kristie), Derek (Haley) and Brett Donald; and great-grandchildren Patrick, Ciara and Rylynn McGrath, Rose and Hazel Epp, Samuel, Grace, Henry and Rory Epp, and Hudson and Maddyn Epp.\tDonald started his working life on the farm at a young age, helping with chores and the livestock.  He farmed with his father and brothers, working off the farm as a carpenter in the winters.  Donald enjoyed working at the Farm Center of the Pioneer Co-op, and also worked for Ham Motors and JD Farm Equipment.  In 1982, along with his partners Al Siemens and John Penner, they started Parkside Memorial Funeral Home.  An avid community member, Donald joined Kiwanis, serving a term as president and playing violin with the Kiwanis Kords.  He also served as a director of the Pioneer Credit Union and was a member of the Barbershop Quartet, Swift Current Chapter. Donald and Marie traveled extensively; visited their children and grandchildren; and warmly hosted many family gatherings.  His children and grandchildren received many gifts from his carpentry workshop over the years, items which have now become treasured keepsakes. His family would like to thank the staff at the Cypress Hospital for the wonderful medical care Dad received; and would especially like to thank the staff at Cypress House who provided kind and compassionate care for Dad during the last month of his life.  He learned to call Cypress House his home and appreciated all that was done for him there. Donations in memory of Donald may be made to “The Night Watchman” radio broadcast of CKSW 1464 Taylor Drive Swift Current, SK S9H 1M9. A private family celebration of a life well-lived will be held at Parkside Memorial Funeral home on Sunday, November 21, 2021. Funeral arrangements are in care of Parkside Memorial Funeral Home – Ryan Cappelle & Hayden Cappelle.",
