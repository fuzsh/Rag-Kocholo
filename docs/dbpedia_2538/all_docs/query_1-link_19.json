        "text": "Where does this data come from?\n\nYour summary is generated based on Google’s Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)—a public dataset of real user experiences for millions of websites. CrUX collects data only for Chrome browser users who opted in (excluding devices with the iOS operating system). The set is updated daily and aggregates the previous 28 days of data.\n\nHow do I read this report?\n\nThe Core Web Vitals Assessment section shows if your page or site passes the Core Web Vitals. The 75th percentile means that 75% of recordings were lower than showcased Web Vitals values (e.g. 75% of page or site visitors had Largest Contentful Paint of 2.5s or less).\n\nThe overall values are categorised as good, to improve or poor. Below, with a breakdown of each metric performance, you can see the percentage of good and poor user experiences and determine where you should make improvements.\n\nWhy there is no data for my site?\n\nYour site has to have enough traffic to be included in the CrUX report. New sites are added to the dataset every day, so keep checking in the future or try running a report on the entire domain. In the meantime, you can also monitor Core Web Vitals in Calibre!\n\nHow do Core Web Vitals impact SEO?\n\nGoogle evaluates pages based on content, relevance, quality, engagement metrics and many other factors. Core Web Vitals are a page ranking signal for your pages. To give your site the best chance of ranking above your competitors, you should ensure that your Core Web Vitals fall within the recommended thresholds.\n\nHow can I improve Core Web Vitals?\n\nThere are numerous ways to improve Core Web Vitals. The best way is to continuously monitor site speed (with tools like Calibre) and follow actionable advice tailored to your context. If you don’t know where to start, read our Getting Started with Web Performance and get actionable advice for specific metrics, such as Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, Total Blocking Time, and Interaction to Next Paint."
