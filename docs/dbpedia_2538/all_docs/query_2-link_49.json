The 10.0 release moves EPM best practices beyond the finance department to managers throughout the company, helping people make risk-aware decisions that can positively impact enterprise-wide performance. The announcement was made at SAPPHIRE(R) NOW, being held in Orlando, Florida, May 15-18, 2011.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20110126/AQ34470LOGO)\n\nAs companies need to decide and act with increasing speed, now more than ever they should ensure that all decision-makers are guided by the same game plan and have a full understanding of potential risks involved. The 10.0 release of SAP(R) BusinessObjects(TM) EPM solutions fills this need by allowing users across the company to contribute to managing enterprise performance. The new release can also take advantage of SAP(R) In-Memory Computing technology, enabling more detailed and agile planning scenarios that can dramatically increase people's ability to sense and respond to changes as they occur. Moreover, with new mobile capabilities people can get this real-time performance data on any kind of mobile device.\n\nThe EPM solutions open the next chapter of SAP's business analytics vision, which is to enable people to make timely decisions that are well-informed and guided by corporate strategy, the current state of the market and the company itself. SAP has been releasing a set of tools to power this shift in the way people work:\n\n-- In December, SAP launched the SAP(R) In-Memory Appliance software (SAP HANA(TM)), which lets people analyze huge amounts of data in real time and any level of detail. -- In February, SAP launched the culmination of three years' development in business intelligence (BI) and enterprise information management (EIM) software to help ensure people base their decisions on real-time information that is reliable, easy to consume and apply, and available on any mobile device. -- In March, SAP launched solutions to help organizations move governance, risk and compliance (GRC) practices out of the hands of a few so everyone in the organization can participate in mitigating risk and helping to increase corporate compliance. -- Beginning in fall 2010, SAP introduced its family of SAP(R) BusinessObjects(TM) analytic applications and has continued to build out the portfolio for specific industries and lines of business.\n\nThe 10.0 release of EPM complements these tools by helping organizations ensure that central corporate strategy and an understanding of risk guide all decisions and actions. This enables companies to achieve goals with greater speed and fewer resources.\n\nCompanies Move Beyond Traditional Utilization of EPM Applications\n\nWith new, shared user interfaces that offer a seamless experience across many applications, learning curves are reduced and people can quickly become productive with the tools. New features include:\n\n-- BI workspaces with embedded EPM content to more easily track key performance indicators (KPIs). -- Delivery to mobile devices and the platforms they run on so that even people on-the-go can gain visibility into how their organizations are performing, analyze different scenarios, update plans and collaborate with colleagues. Using mobile devices un-tethers workers and provides them more interactive ways to explore data and plan for the future with gesture-driven actions for scenario planning. -- New bill of materials (BoM) costing to link EPM activities down to the production level. -- Business area scorecards for areas such as customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and human resources (HR) for better alignment across the organization. -- Automated variance analysis, saving time in determining root causes between plan and actuals, and predicting possible future scenarios. -- Deeper integration between EPM and GRC applications delivers risk-adjusted planning capabilities. -- Extended capabilities for financial consolidation, including consolidation monitoring, enhanced control and validation capabilities, incremental consolidation and new journal features. -- Deeper integration with the SAP NetWeaver(R) technology platform, the SAP(R) ERP application and SAP BusinessObjects solutions -- as well as support for non-SAP environments -- help improve manageability, reduce total cost of ownership and empower people to better support the business.\n\nFaster Financial Close\n\nIn addition, the 10.0 release encompasses the new SAP(R) BusinessObjects(TM) Disclosure Management application, designed to be able to establish a collaborative, flexible and compliant process for filing financial and non-financial statements and regulatory disclosures, as well as corresponding extensible business reporting language (XBRL) submissions. It helps organizations ensure a timely, accurate financial close process with decreased risk. Collaboration capabilities and integrated workflows let customers work quickly across organizational hierarchies, geographies and systems to manage approvals and deliver statements to stakeholders in required output formats.\n\n\"GEA is very excited about the release of SAP BusinessObjects Disclosure Management as part of its 10.0 EPM release,\" said Dr. Hans-Jorg Harth, head of Group Reporting, GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft. \"We were able to introduce the solution into our business in a very short timeframe thanks to its highly intuitive user experience, which required little upfront training. Our team is now able to collaborate and work in parallel on the creation of our financial statements with full confidence that we are working with the current version, complete with a full audit trail. As a result, we have been able to realize significant time savings during the final publication and formatting of our regulatory reports.\"\n\nEPM For the Whole Company\n\nSAP BusinessObjects EPM solutions are recognized by leading industry analysts as delivering one of the most complete and mature sets of solutions for the office of finance, spanning strategy management; planning, budgeting and forecasting; financial consolidation; and profitability and cost management. The 10.0 release, however, extends these leading EPM capabilities to new groups of users beyond the office of finance. In fact, many features of the new EPM release already power a number of newly launched SAP BusinessObjects analytic applications designed for role-specific users in diverse industries and lines of business.\n\nBuilding on the previous release of the SAP(R) BusinessObjects(TM) Spend Performance Management and SAP(R) BusinessObjects(TM) Supply Chain Performance Management applications as well as a number of industry-specific planning applications from the SAP BusinessObjects portfolio, the 10.0 release encompasses new offerings such as the SAP(R) BusinessObjects(TM) Sales and Operations Planning rapid-deployment solution, which helps sales and operations teams establish a single, unified plan to drive their businesses forward. Using the SAP BusinessObjects Planning and Consolidation application, it provides an easy-to-implement tool for consolidating data, supplying predefined analytics and managing sales and operations planning processes.\n\n\"As is the case with many of our contemporaries in the highly competitive apparel and footwear industry, our challenge is to quickly gain insight into our financial and operational performance to help drive strategic decisions throughout our organization,\" said David Roberts, corporate manager, Financial Planning and Analysis, Under Armour Inc. \"Implementation of SAP BusinessObjects Planning and Consolidation has been a huge needle-moving initiative, which has helped us improve production of detailed financial models rapidly, analyze performance and 'what if' scenarios on the fly and disseminate information throughout our organization at the appropriate level based on audience, with ease. We are extremely excited about the 10.0 release, which will build upon our existing financial models by adding the ability to perform greater scrutiny of margins, partner/vendor performance and global financial performance with consolidations.\"\n\n\"The new release of our EPM solutions and analytic applications reinforce our market leadership and bring SAP's vision for business analytics full circle,\" said Bryan Katis, vice president, Enterprise Performance Management Solutions, SAP. \"This is the latest example of how we are working to deliver solutions that help individuals, teams and entire business networks unlock valuable knowledge to uncover new opportunities, anticipate change and make better decisions as a whole to achieve remarkable results.\"\n\nFor announcements, blog posts, videos and other coverage during the event series, visit the SAPPHIRE NOW newsroom.

These new devices offer secure data storage using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) authentication for industrial, consumer, computing and embedded applications with flexible key management features and secure counters. AES is a symmetric-key encryption standard adopted by governments and cryptographic experts around the world.\n\nThese security features are available in two devices compatible with standard serial EEPROMs, one supporting I2C and the other supporting SPI. This allows system developers to add security to existing systems without retooling their printed circuit board. This direct replacement can extend the life of a system's architecture by including security features within the hardware to make the system more secure than software implementations. The new secure devices also extend a current system's security into the future with the AES-CCM (AES in Counter and Cipher block chaining modes with message authentication code) authentication.\n\n\"There is a current void in the consumer, medical and computing sectors for increased security in microcontroller-based applications,\" said Kerry Maletsky, cryptographic product line director, Atmel Corporation. \"Atmel helps fill this void by enabling developers to simply replace their serial EEPROM with the new ATAES132. These devices offer world-class hardware protection for keys and data to help system developers easily integrate a higher level of trust in their system. Features like non-reversible monotonic counters and the ability to securely move keys on and off the chip provide a level of system flexibility not previously available.\"\n\nThe Atmel ATAES132 development kits can be plugged into a variety of Atmel AVR(R) or ARM(R)-based development kits for a complete project solution. All Atmel ATAES132 devices support 2.5V to 5.5V supply voltages and consume less than 250nA standby/sleep current.\n\nFor more information on Atmel CryptoAuthentication products, please visit the following link: http://www.atmel.com/products/cryptoauthentication.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe Atmel ATAES132 devices are available now in 8-pin SOIC , TSSOP and UDFN packages.

(NasdaqGS: CKSW), the leading provider of automated workforce management and optimization solutions for the service industry, today announced that the UK's largest water and wastewater services company, Thames Water, has selected the ClickSoftware ServiceOptimization Suite. Thames Water identified ClickSoftware's workforce management and mobility platform as the key technologies to ensure significant improvements in the efficient use of its workforce, its assets and the quality of service that it provides to its customers through optimized scheduling of its 2,000-strong field force and contractors.\n\nThames Water is under significant, industry-wide pressure from the Water Services Regulation Authority (OFWAT) to deliver value for its 13.8 million customers' money during the current five-year Asset Management Planning (AMP) period. The most effective way to comply with OFWAT whilst improving customer service levels is by optimizing the activities of its 2,000 field-based staff.\n\n\"Workforce management technology will give us the edge in maximizing the performance of our field operations and, at the same time, help to reduce our back office costs and meet our regulatory commitments,\" said Andrew Bilecki, Chief Information Officer at Thames Water.\n\n\"Following a rigorous European tender process, we selected ClickSoftware as it is the best fit for our functional and technical requirements. Given the rapid mobility advancements over the last couple of years, we wanted to ensure we had the best mobile solution in order to mobilize SAP processes into the field and support our workforce with the right data at the right time,\" Bilecki added.\n\nThe ServiceOptimization Suite will provide a full, integrated view of activities across the entire service chain. Prior to selecting ClickSoftware, Thames Water had been using a variety of solutions to manage its mobile workforce. As part of the SAP Workforce and Asset Management Information (WAMI) transformation program, Thames Water selected ClickSoftware's ServiceOptimization Suite including ClickMobile built on top of the Sybase Mobility Platform.\n\nClickSoftware's mobility solution built on top of the Sybase Mobility Platform will enable Thames Water to mobilize SAP asset management processes, ensure tight integration with their ESRI GIS system and allow them to capture timesheets and asset related data from the field. In addition, the mobility solution has tight integration to ClickSoftware's ServiceOptimization Suite ensuring that the decision-making and optimized dispatch process becomes fully automated. This approach will lead Thames Water towards becoming a real-time service enterprise - a concept pioneered by ClickSoftware.\n\nIt is envisaged that ClickSoftware's mobile field service platform will be a leap forward for field communications and the business.\n\n\"ClickMobile allows us to bring the significant investment we have made in SAP enterprise technology to our service technicians in the field,\" said Phil Barker, WAMI Program Director at Thames Water. \"Information about consecutive jobs is automatically pushed to technicians' mobile devices, including any notes from previous visits, site maps, and asset data. Through the integrated workflows, work orders, timesheets, customer information and asset inspection data can be fed back into SAP's Asset Management and CRM system. The field technician will also have access to the back office systems via ClickMobile in order to better service the customer, for example creating appointments and follow-up orders from the field or completing customer satisfaction surveys,\" he added.\n\nThe mobile solution will also allow field supervisors to monitor in real time their team members' daily progress, help supervisors provide scheduling assistance to the field workers, complete crew timesheets, download attachments and manuals, capture and upload digital photos and run performance management. The ClickMobile and SAP Portal will be tightly integrated and therefore field technicians will be able to run, from ClickMobile, self-service functions such as holiday requests, knowledge management and collaboration.\n\nThe proven scheduling and mobility applications from ClickSoftware running directly on the industry's leading mobility infrastructure from Sybase (An SAP Company), will make a significant contribution to the predicted cost savings and operational efficiencies through reduced administration and freeing up time for technicians to concentrate on field operations and customer service. For wireless connection management and VPN, ClickMobile will be utilizing the BirdStep SafeMove application. For device management and security Sybase Afaria is tightly integrated with ClickMobile.\n\nClickContact will provide better end customer communication and service through email, SMS, telephone and the availability of narrow appointment windows to customers via the Thames Water website. ClickSchedule will automatically optimize the deployment of resources for proactive and reactive maintenance, making sure that the right engineer arrives at the appointed time with the skills and tools to get the job done first time. ClickLocate will give dispatch teams clear real-time visibility of all technicians' locations and provide field workers with lone worker capability and therefore back office staff are able to monitor workers and their safety and raise the alarm if the mobile worker is in potential danger. ClickAnalyze will then collect all operational data and provide executives and management with insight into where operations can be progressively improved creating further scope for cost efficiencies.\n\n\"Our optimized scheduling and planning solutions have, for a number of years, been the de facto choice for organizations with large, complex mobile workforces. The selection of our workforce management and mobility platform is further evidence that when it comes to supporting enterprise mobility programs, ClickSoftware has the most complete technology, experience and methodology to ensure their success,\" said Dr. Moshe BenBassat, Chairman and CEO of ClickSoftware. \"We look forward to working closely with Thames Water to ensure they meet regulatory commitments, improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction,\" he added.\n\nClickSoftware now operates in seven out of the twelve UK water and sewerage operators.\n\nAbout ClickSoftware\n\nClickSoftware is the leading provider of automated workforce management and optimization solutions for every size of service business.

Announces 2011 First Quarter Financial Results and Restatement of 2010 Financial Statements to Account for Warrants as LiabilityContinued Progress with Mobile Device BusinessGross Profit and Gross Margin Increased Year-over-Year\n\nSHENZHEN, China, May 16, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- SinoHub, Inc. (\"SinoHub\" or the \"Company\"), , an electronics company whose main growth driver is manufacturing and distributing custom, private-label mobile phones, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.\n\nFIRST QUARTER 2011 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\n-- Total net sales declined slightly year-over-year to US$38.0 million in the first quarter of 2011 versus US$38.6 million in the first quarter of 2010.\n\n-- Gross profit was US$7.7 million compared to US$7.1 million in the same quarter in 2010. Gross margin was 20.3% compared to 18.4% in the first quarter of 2010.\n\n-- Cash used in operations was US$4.4 million, compared with US$38,000 in the first quarter of 2010.\n\n-- Net income was US$3.54 million, representing a slight increase from US$3.45 million in the first quarter of 2010.\n\n-- Net income per basic and diluted shares were both US$0.12, down from US$0.13 per basic share and unchanged from US$0.12 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nNet income for the first quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2010 were affected by a restatement to properly account for certain terms of the Company's outstanding warrants issued on March 2, 2010. See \"Restatement Concerning Warrant Liability\" below.\n\nRESTATEMENT CONCERNING WARRANT LIABILITY\n\nThe Company has determined that its historical financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010 included in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") require restatement to reflect the proper accounting for 816,670 common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with its March 2, 2010 private placement (the \"2010 Warrants\") as a derivative liability rather than as permanent equity.\n\nThe Company is in the process of preparing amendments to the Form 10-Qs and Form 10-K for the prior periods noted above and plans to file those amendments with the SEC, reflecting the restatements required relative to the 2010 Warrants. Further information concerning the restatement is detailed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011 and in the Company's May 16, 2011 Current Report on Form 8-K relative to this matter.\n\nThe Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011 incorporates corrections made in response to the accounting error described above by restating the Company's financial statements presented therein for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The corrections to the quarterly information contained in such Form 10-Q had no impact on the Company's previously reported operations or cash flows for the periods being restated.\n\nThe results reported in this press release and the financial information attached hereto are based upon the changed accounting for the 2010 Warrants as the same is to be restated in the planned amended periodic reports to be filed with the SEC.\n\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS:\n\nCommenting on the results, SinoHub's CEO, Mr. Harry Cochran said, \"We are pleased with the continued growth of our ICM business and improving gross margins. As the Company evolves, it is important to maintain focus on the evolution of the mobile device market and on our ability to deliver on orders for new products and in new geographies. As such, we continued to strategically shift our focus to the long-term development of the ICM business. Our top-line performance was impacted by a decrease in sales from our ECSS business segment related to our strategic shift towards a greater ICM focus, and a challenging year-over-year comparable as the first quarter of 2010 was uncharacteristically strong. The startup year for our factory (April 2010 - April 2011) went well, but we still recorded losses for that subsidiary, resulting in increased income tax expense compared to the first quarter of 2010. This impact is a function of the investments made in support of our new growth initiative, and a normal part of starting up a manufacturing operation. More importantly, the strong growth of our ICM business confirms the value of our business model to deliver custom designed mobile phones to distributors and operators that give them a competitive advantage in their local markets using our joint design process. In 2011, to further capitalize on growth opportunities from our ICM segment, we plan to begin production of our own brand of mobile phones for sale in China.\"\n\nFIRST QUARTER 2011 FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nNet Sales\n\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2011 were US$38.0 million, representing a decrease of 1.6% from US$38.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of electronic components in the ECSS business segment. Sales in the ICM business segment in the first quarter of 2011 were US$16.4 million, up 156% over US$6.4 million in the first quarter of 2010 based on increased sales of mobile phones and on sales in the contract motherboard manufacturing business which did not exist in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nNet sales from the electronic component sales and supply chain management services segment (collectively ECSS) for the first quarter of 2011 were US$21.5 million, a year-over-year decrease of 33.2% from US$32.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by shortages in the supply of electronic components in the first quarter of 2011 and the fact that in the first quarter a number of ECSS customers became ICM customers and began to purchase finished goods from the Company as opposed to components.\n\nGross Profit and Margin\n\nGross profit for the quarter was US$7.7 million, up 8.5% from US$7.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. Gross margin for the quarter was 20.3%, up from 18.4% in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating cost and expenses, including selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, professional services and other operating income, were US$3.2 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% from US$2.5 million in the first quarter of 2010 due primarily to the costs associated with the factory which did not exist in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nIncome from Operations\n\nIncome from operations for the quarter was US$4.5 million, or 11.8% of sales, as compared to operating income of US$4.6 million, or 11.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2010, the higher gross margin being offset by increased costs associated with manufacturing.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company recorded US$1.5 million of income tax expenses in the first quarter of 2011, versus the US$1.0 million of income tax expenses it recorded in the corresponding period in 2010. The reason for the large increase is that taxes are accrued by subsidiary. There was a loss in the manufacturing subsidiary in the first quarter of 2011 that offsets profits from other subsidiaries on consolidation with no corresponding tax offset.\n\nNet Income\n\nNet income attributable to SinoHub's shareholders was US$3.54 million, compared to US$3.45 million in the first quarter of 2010 due primarily to the impact of US$511,000 in income from changes in the adjustment for warrant derivative liability during the first quarter of 2011 compared to an expense of US$44,000 for such item in the first quarter of 2010 (after restatement) which was offset in part by a higher tax accrual during the first quarter of 2011. Net margin was 9.3%, as compared to 8.9% in the first quarter of 2010. Net income per basic and diluted shares were both US$0.12, down from US$0.13 per basic share and unchanged from US$0.12 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010, based on 30.2 million and 30.3 million weighted average, basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of March 31, 2011, the Company had US$14.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase from US$4.5 million as of December 31, 2010 resulting from net proceeds of US$10.4 million raised through a sale of equity in March of 2011. The Company had working capital of US$69.5 million on March 31, 2011, up from US$57.5 million at the end of 2010, and a current ratio of 1.8 to 1 on March 31, 2011.\n\nAs of March 31, 2011, the Company had approximately US$5 million available to borrow under its credit facilities.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2011, the net amount of cash used in the Company's operating activities was US$4.4 million, compared to US$38,000 in the same period in 2010, which was mainly attributable to the increase in inventories and accounts receivable.\n\nAs of March 31, 2011, inventories were approximately US$20.0 million and accounts receivable were US$49.3 million, compared to approximately US$14.6 million and US$45.7 million on December 31, 2010, respectively. The increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from lower collections in the first quarter of 2011.\n\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK\n\nSinoHub has begun a strategic initiative to develop its own mobile phone brand in China, the world's largest mobile phone market. There are several examples of companies, the most notable being Tianyu in Beijing, that have executed this strategy successfully. The Company will continue to make and sell private label, custom design mobile phones for distributors and operators elsewhere. We believe the strategy to create our own brand in China, where a marketable brand name is necessary for success, combined with our strategy of using our joint design process to create mobile devices that give our customers competitive advantage in their local markets, will expand our market opportunity, help drive margin improvement and create a more defensible position for our Company.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nSinoHub's senior management will host a conference call at 7:00 am (Pacific) / 10:00 am (Eastern) / 10:00 pm (Beijing/Hong Kong) on Monday, May 16, 2011 to discuss the Company's 2011 first quarter financial results and recent business activity.

SenSage also announced today an expanded alliance with Cerner to offer a new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based version of P2Sentinel(TM), Cerner's enterprise clinical system auditing solution.\n\nBy combining the existing ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use benefits of P2Sentinel with the flexibility and affordability benefits of SaaS, this offering will help drive a higher level of compliance across the industry, particularly among smaller hospitals with IT resource constraints and tight capital expense budgets. This approach relieves each customer from the need to buy equipment and instead they can leverage P2Sentinel logging and auditing services for a fixed monthly fee to help enable providers to achieve HIPAA compliance and to help with the HIPAA requirements for auditing related to ARRA HITECH.\n\n\"We're honored that Cerner has named SenSage one of its key partners, based on our success working together to keep confidential patient information safe and secure, and help Cerner clients meet important healthcare compliance requirements,\" said Joe Gottlieb, CEO of SenSage. \"Whereas we normally sell SIEM and Log Management solutions as a separate, horizontal layer of security infrastructure, with Cerner, we are able to embed this technology so that security and compliance are intrinsic to the primary applications running the business of healthcare. This new SaaS version of P2Sentinel based on our scalable multi-tenant SIEM software broadens our collective reach in the healthcare market and will accelerate the industry compliance that is central to healthcare reform initiatives.\"\n\nCurrently, more than 75 healthcare organizations use Cerner's P2Sentinel powered by SenSage, a comprehensive event logging and auditing solution for tracking end user access to confidential patient data. P2Sentinel assists in identifying security violations and providing long-term forensic security analysis by correlating activities from Cerner(R) solutions and clinical system infrastructure elements such as PCs, printers, databases, networks and user authentication systems. P2Sentinel is a critical component of any healthcare organization's efforts to assure authorized access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI).\n\nThis joint SenSage-Cerner solution aggregates, monitors and investigates security events while also helping healthcare organizations achieve compliance with HIPAA and the newer HITECH Act. It allows compliance officers to determine who has accessed patient data in a quick, secure and efficient manner and provides a single auditing and reporting tool that is capable of receiving auditing data from both Cerner Millennium(R) and other third-party clinical systems. The reports can be exported and emailed to an organization within minutes, detailing a security event.\n\n\"Being able to quickly track how patient information is accessed at any given time is critical for our healthcare clients - they need to be able to demonstrate they are in compliance with the Security requirements of both HIPAA and the HITECH Act,\" said John Travis, Cerner senior director of regulatory and compliance. \"Over the years, our clients have addressed this requirement more efficiently because of our ability to integrate SenSage's scalable SIEM and log management capabilities within our solutions. With this new hosted model, we can offer these capabilities in a cost effective manner to smaller healthcare organizations that have limited IT resources but still need to ensure sensitive patient data is safe.\"\n\nMore information about the P2Sentinel solution powered by SenSage can be found here: http://www.cerner.com/solutions/Hospitals_and_Health_Systems/Cerner_Technologies/Security/\n\nAbout SenSage\n\nSenSage(R), Inc. delivers unified Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and log management systems that are open to all event data types, scale to petabytes, minimize storage costs and perform sophisticated data analysis. Hundreds of customers worldwide leverage patented Security Intelligence solutions from SenSage to identify, understand and counteract cyber-threats, fraud and compliance violations.
