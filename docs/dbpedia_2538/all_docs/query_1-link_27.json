        "text": "Our goal of coexistence with society and nature has been deeply rooted in our corporate culture since Suntory was founded in 1899. Driving for positive change has always been part of our DNA. This goal translates into our value of Growing for Good, which means that by growing our business sustainably and responsibly, we contribute to a better world. We recognize that the road to a sustainable future is long and complex, but we are determined to keep moving forward. You can read more about our sustainability goals and progress in our latest sustainability report that we published on World Environment Day here: https://lnkd.in/e64uTbRB #GrowingforGood #WorldEnvironmentDay #GenerationRestoration #Sustainability\n\nIt was fantastic to attend the Sustainability Leaders Summit, Auckland yesterday and be in a room with so many other #sustainability professionals. There were lots of really valuable conversations about many of the challenges and day-to-day experiences we share. From how to successfully educate and engage senior decision-makers while remaining empathetic and patient, or how to communicate behaviour change initiatives to thousands of staff and customers and using the right language for the right audience, to being conscious of your own health and wellbeing while grappling with the knowledge of what the science is telling us about the state of our planet. It really is a big job that requires a huge set of skills. However, despite the benefits of attending, I can not stay quiet about the #singleuse coffee cups that were being used...FFS! Yes...there were single-use coffee cups being given out at a Sustainability LEADERS Summit! It was so jarring to see them there, and so deflating to see my fellow sustainability professionals using them. Especially considering there were reusable mugs sitting within a few strides of the coffee cart. Yes, it was just one event, and yes you may have only used one cup. But how is that any different to a business saying \"we don't need to reduce our emissions or reduce our resource use, we are only one business.\"? We are all in this together and we all have to make changes to how we live, do business, and attend summits! We really need our sustainability leaders to be modelling those changes. Rant over. See you next year."
