I am happy to participate in this application which I believe will have a positive impact on commercial radio, and given this technological development, it is important to license and regulate it in Canada expeditiously.\"[4]\n\nCSR's application and two others were approved on June 16, 2005; CSR's service, XM Radio Canada, launched on December 1, 2005.\n\nHildebrand owns three radio stations in the city of Saskatoon through Saskatoon Media Groupâ€”which are separate from Golden West.[5]\n\nIn February 2021, the company acquired the Steinbach-based Summit Organizational Development.[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
