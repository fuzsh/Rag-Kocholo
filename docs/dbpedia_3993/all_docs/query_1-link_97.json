        "text": "1) Journeys Artist craftspeople and designers are sometimes inspired by journeys they make. Aboriginal artists have made paintings to document their travels and to define the Australian landscape. Richard long constructs artwork in the landscapes he visits. Franklyn Rodgers’ installation ‘The Elders’ combines image and the recorded spoken word to explore the experience of Afro-Caribbean's who moved to Britain during the mid-twentieth century. Research appropriate sources and make your own work in response to one of the following: EITHER (a) travel OR (b) between here and there OR (c) life’s journey\n\n‘Red & White Domes’ ‘Temple Gardens’ Paul Klee (1879-1940) Born in Münchenbuchsee, Switzerland, and is considered both a German and a Swiss painter. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included expressionism, cubism, and surrealism. Paintings inspired by his travels to other countries."
