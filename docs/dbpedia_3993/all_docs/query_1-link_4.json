Once you've seen them you want to see them again and again.\" Lucian Freud\n\nLucian Michael Freud, (8 December 1922 – 20 July 2011) was a British painter. Known chiefly for his thickly impasted portrait and figure paintings, he was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time.His works are noted for their psychological penetration, and for their often discomfiting examination of the relationship between artist and model."
