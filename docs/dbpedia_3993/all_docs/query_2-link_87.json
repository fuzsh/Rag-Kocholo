        "text": "Lucian Freud was justly the most celebrated British figurative painter of the late 20th century. He was thought of primarily as a painter of portraits but, though his subjects were often well-known people, he was no society portraitist in the manner of Sargent or Boldini. His purpose was not to flatter and the starkness of his images, many of them highly detailed nudes, have few precedents in the art of the human form.\n\nSo early was Freud's reputation established - while he was a teenager - that for almost all his career he was able to paint on his own terms and only what he was interested in. ''My work,'' he said, in a remark at once typically truthful and egotistic, ''is purely autobiographical. It's about myself and my surroundings.''\n\nThe results of this subjective outlook divided the critics and the public. For many, Freud was a master of capturing the quintessence of a sitter, his paintings being, as he said, not like people but of people. Though his stature was perhaps increased by his having few great contemporaries, he was hailed as the heir of Rembrandt and Hals, both of whom he greatly admired.\n\nOthers found the stern intensity of Freud's scrutiny unsettling and too uniform, thinking his paintings revealed not their subjects but his view of humanity. His pictures were said not to celebrate the differences between individuals but their melancholy similarities - a view reinforced by the anonymous titles he gave many of his works, as if they were exercises rather than pictures of real people.\n\nFreud consorted with high and low society. He had many beautiful and well-born lovers, some of whom sat for him, while perhaps his most celebrated model was a grossly fat homosexual nightclub dancer, Leigh Bowery; indeed, Freud painted few men who were not homosexual, saying he admired their courage.\n\nLucian Freud was born in Berlin on December 8, 1922, the middle brother of three. His father, an architect, was the youngest son of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, and his mother was the daughter of a rich grain merchant. He grew up in a house near the Tiergarten, being schooled at the Franzosisches Gymnasium and holidaying on his maternal grandfather's estate. The rising tide of anti-Semitism in Germany prompted the Freuds to move to England in 1933.\n\nFreud was sent to Dartington Hall, a progressive boarding school, from 1933 to 1937, and then for a year to Bryanston, from which he was expelled for disruptive behaviour, said to have culminated in his driving a pack of foxhounds into the school's chapel during Matins.\n\nHe devoted most of his time at Bryanston to riding and to drawing, in which he was encouraged by Sigmund Freud's gift of some prints of Brueghel's paintings. At 15, Freud enrolled at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, but in 1939, dissatisfied with the school's classically oriented curriculum, he moved to the East Anglian School of Painting. That year, he took British nationality.\n\nBy now, Freud had been recognised as a prodigy. He took a studio and cultivated a bohemian image, stalking wartime London in a fez and fur coat, a bird of prey perched on his wrist. Among his other eccentricities was the refusal for many years to have a telephone in his studio; until the late 1980s, friends could contact him with any certainty only by telegram.\n\nIn 1942, Freud enlisted in the merchant navy and served for three months before being invalided out. But his brief service confirmed his instinct that he would find such raw milieux attractive and stimulating. When he returned to London, he rented a studio beside the Grand Union canal, the border between working-class Paddington and better-heeled Little Venice.\n\nFreud was given his first exhibition in 1944. By now, he was concentrating on painting rather than drawing, working in a style some thought influenced by surrealism. Thus the subject of Quince on a Blue Table (1943-44) is somewhat overshadowed by the baleful zebra's head that thrusts from the wall above the table. Freud, characteristically, denied being influenced by another style.\n\nFrom 1946 until 1948, Freud lived and painted in Greece and France. When he returned to England, it was to begin teaching at the Slade and to marry Kitty Garman, the daughter of sculptor Jacob Epstein.\n\nGarman became the subject of his first important series of portraits, notable for their flat contours, stylised line and stark lighting. This culminated in portraits of two of his closest friends - Francis Bacon, whom he painted on copper, and photographer Harry Diamond. The Diamond portrait brought Freud the Arts Council prize at the Festival of Britain, for which he was the youngest artist given a commission.\n\nFreud divorced Garman in 1952 and the next year he married Lady Caroline Blackwood. They were divorced in 1957 and she later married the poet Robert Lowell, who in 1977 was found dead in a New York taxi with his arms clasped around Freud's portrait of her. She died in 1996.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Freud had begun to pull away from the neo-romanticist contemporaries and evolved a style of work that sharply divided the critics.\n\nMost of the best-known works he executed in the next 40 years were of nudes, rather vulnerable figures usually placed against a white sheet on an iron bed or on an old Chesterfield sofa in Freud's studio.\n\nFreud sometimes ascribed the change in his style to a conversation with Bacon in which he was urged to put more of his own life into his work. Some critics concluded that what was going into the work was Freud's dissatisfaction with his own life. In particular, Freud's soured romances were said to have left him with a contempt for women that made him paint them as a voyeur.\n\nYet if there was no outright affection for humanity in Freud's work, there was no hostility, either - rather, evidence only of an unwearying fascination with the human form and of a striving to be faithful to it in all its moments, by turns sullen, proud and tender.\n\nFreud displayed a distinct feeling for the latter, notably in portraits painted in the 1980s of his elderly mother, of his daughter, Bella, and in compositions featuring dogs, such as Double Portrait (1985-86), in which the hand of a sleeping subject cups the muzzle of a similarly drowsy hound.\n\nFreud continued to paint into old age, among the most remarkable of his later works being the full-length naked self-portrait Painter Working (1993), which seemed to depict him as an elderly satyr, shod, almost comically, in a pair of ancient fell-walking shoes. It was a rare explicit glimpse of Freud himself in a body of work that otherwise was introspective only by proxy.\n\nBetween May 2000 and December 2001, Freud painted the Queen, with controversial results. In May 2008, his 1995 picture Benefits Supervisor Sleeping was sold in New York for $33.6 million, a record for a work by a living artist. Freud was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1983 and a member of the Order of Merit in 1993.\n\nIt is difficult to be precise about Lucian Freud's progeny but there appear to be at least 13. He had two daughters by his first marriage. He had four children by Suze Boyt, one of whom is the novelist Rose Boyt; by Katherine McAdam, he had two sons and two daughters; by Celia Paul, he had a son; and he had two daughters by Bernadine Coverley, the writer Esther Freud and the fashion designer Bella Freud.\n\nTelegraph, London"
