        "text": "LUCIAN FREUD HAS BECOME a figure of popular myth, an artist poised between the underworld and the aristocracy, a kind of slumming Faust who prowls lowlife pubs and eats woodcock for breakfast.\n\nHe is wrapped in secrecy, gives his telephone number to no one, has no nameplate or number on his front door.\n\nIn Britain, Lucian Freud's name appears on any connoisseur's list of the country's greatest 20th-century artists, along with Stanley Spencer and Henry Moore and Francis Bacon; abroad, he is only selectively admired. A critic for Le Monde, reviewing a Freud exhibition at the Pompidou Center last year, described him as painting flesh like badly carved ham. Other reviewers derided his conscious emulation of Old Masters, his occasional use of easel portraiture and gilt frames.\n\nCritics in America have been more effusive. In the opinion of Robert Hughes, the art critic of Time, Lucian Freud is simply ''the greatest living realist painter.'' John Russell, the chief art critic for The New York Times, went even further: Freud is ''the only living realist painter,'' he suggested, reviewing a show at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington last year. ''As a witness to human nature in the second half of our century he has no equal, whether in Britain or elsewhere.''\n\nThere remains, beneath the surface of all such statements, the feeling of pleading a cause. Freud's work is easy to admire, difficult to like. But then so are many great paintings. Freud used to admire openly the work of Francis Bacon, a once-close friend, and he owns one of Bacon's key works, the embracing couple inspired by Eadweard Muybridge's wrestlers. Other equally uncompromising English painters, like Edward Burra, may have shaped the younger Freud's vision with their disaffected embrace of lowlife; Stanley Spencer's hawk-eyed nude portraits of himself and his wife offer another obvious comparison (one which Freud himself rejects). Freud has been connected to the ''School of London,'' the group of painters that includes R. B. Kitaj, Michael Andrews, Francis Bacon, Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach, though none of these artists have much in common except their allegiance to figuration and a palette that tends to the murky.\n\nThis kind of painting is in great demand of late. After years of discreet dedication, Frank Auerbach recently represented England at the Venice Biennale, and the prices of these artists have soared. A Lucian Freud rarely comes on the market, and the list of hungry patrons is long. But recently, two small oils, neither very special, were auctioned. A portrait from 1966 fetched $470,000; a more recent painting, ''Seated Figure,'' brought $385,000.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
