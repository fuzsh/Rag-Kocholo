        "text": "Summary of Leon Kossoff\n\nAt a time when Conceptualism and Minimalism were dominating the contemporary art scene, Kossoff emerged from within a group of radical figurative painters who became known as \"The School of London\". Their approaches varied significantly, with Kossoff's work standing out for its heavy impasto style (referred to by one critic as being like \"icing on a cake\") form which his images appear to physically materialize. Kossoff's paintings ask the viewer to consider simultaneously the image, and the texture and application, of the paint itself. Kossoff was a proud Londoner (he was in fact the only member of the group to be born and bred in London) who's cityscapes focused predominantly on the blitzed post-war city and its dusty construction sites. He complemented his cityscapes with a series of portraits, usually of family and close friends, which Kossoff executed with the expressive and tactile force that was to become his trademark.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nEmerging in the mid-1970s, Kossoff, with the likes of Frank Auerbach, R. B. Kitaj, Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon, represented a new generation of British art school painters. \"The School of London\" amounted to an afront to the prevailing avant-gardes and revitalized international interest in figurative painting. Indeed, Kossoff is cited as one of the chief influences on the revival of figurative art as seen in the rise of the late '70s/early '80s movements of Neo-Expressionism and New Spirit Painting.\n\nKossoff is recognized for the almost primeval ferocity with which he applied his paint. His style featured heavily reworked paintings and powerful drawings that caught the downcast mood of post-war London. But later works see the artist abandoning his preference for grays and browns. Moving into the 1990s, his outlook on life was no less subjective, but perhaps more spiritual as he turned towards a lighter color palette. His celebrated series of Cherry Tree paintings were a tribute to the changing seasons but also to the \"tree of life\" itself.\n\nThe publicity adverse Kossoff spoke of his love for London through his unromantic and uncompromising art. Richard Kendall of the British Council, summed him up thus: \"His work has affinities with European expressionism, but also has particular English qualities: reminiscent of Sickert and the Camden Town Group of painters with an attachment to the everyday and least picturesque aspects of urban life\".\n\nHaving become friends in the 1950s, Kossoff and Frank Auerbach shared a close bond that lasted some 70 years. The pair remained dedicated to figurative art as other movements came and went and the similarities between the two artists is often picked up on by critics and historians. But while Auerbach's preference was to paint on canvas, and his painting can lean closer toward abstraction than his friend's, Kossoff's painting style was so dense he usually opted to paint on board since it could better support the sheer physical weight of the paint.\n\nThe Life of Leon Kossoff\n\nImportant Art by Leon Kossoff\n\nBiography of Leon Kossoff\n\nChildhood\n\nLeon Kossoff was born and raised in the inner London borough of Islington. He was the second of seven children born to working-class Russian-Jewish immigrants. His father, Wolf, a baker, and his mother, Rachel, had moved to London at the start of the century having fled religious persecution in the Ukraine. Kossoff recalled, \"there wasn't much culture [in my family] and artists were considered wastrels\". Kossoff's first significant encounter with art came at the age of nine when he encountered Rembrandt's A Woman Bathing in a Stream (c. 1654) at the National Gallery. He said later, \"I don't know what struck me about it [...] But somehow that painting opened up a whole world to me - not a world of painting so much as a way of feeling about life that I hadn't experienced before\".\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, children were relocated from inner London to the safety of rural England. The thirteen-year-old Kossoff was taken in by the Bishop family who lived in the market town of King's Lynn, Norfolk (about 100 miles north of London). It proved a good move for Kossoff given that the Bishop's strongly encouraged Kossoff to maintain his interest in art. He still longed for his childhood home, stating later: \"The strange, ever-changing light, the endless streets, and the shuddering feel of the sprawling city linger[ed] in my mind like a faintly glimmering memory of a long-forgotten, perhaps never experienced childhood\".\n\nEducation and Early Training\n\nKossoff returned to London in 1943, where he studied commercial art at Saint Martin's School of Art, and evening life drawing classes at Toynbee Hall adult education centre. From 1945-48 he completed military service in the 2nd Battalion Jewish Brigade of the Royal Fusiliers, and served in Italy, Holland, Belgium, and Northern Germany. Frank Auerbach was a Jewish war orphan (his parents having perished in the death camps) and was given a job at the Kossoff family bakery on Calvert Avenue (Auerbach served on the bread counter; Kossoff on the cakes counter). Historian Alistair Smart wrote, \"In time, the pair would leave the bakery behind and develop long, successful careers as artists, careers that are frequently considered in parallel. Auerbach (repeating a well-known quote by Georges Braque who was reflecting on his working relationship with Pablo Picasso) claimed they 'were like two mountain climbers roped together'\".\n\nKossoff (with Auerbach) returned to his studies at Saint Martin's in 1949 but failed an important exam due to his wanting drawing technique. But both he and his friend had already become disillusioned with the College's academic leanings. As Auerbach said in an interview in 1990, \"Leon and I were perhaps a bit rougher than the other students [...] We wanted something ... not so linear and illustrative\". At Auerbach's suggestion, the pair transferred to Borough Road Polytechnic where they took evening classes with the painter David Bomberg, onetime member of the British avant-garde group, the Whitechapel Boys (they took their name from the Whitechapel Library where they met). The pair studied under Bomberg between 1950 and 1952, and as arts editor Michael McNay explains, Bomberg encouraged Kossoff to establish an \"intense visual and emotional engagement with the subject\", and to seek out what Bomberg often called \"the spirit in the mass\". For his part, Kossoff stated that watching Bomberg draw made him feel like he had finally \"come home\" as a painter.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1953, Kossoff also worked out of a studio in Mornington Crescent (in Northwest London), before moving into a space in Bethnal Green (in London's East End). Smart tells us that there are a total of eight portraits of Kossoff by Auerbach, and three by Kossoff of Auerbach painted during the decade. Auerbach recalled \"I would sit for an hour and Leon would paint me, and then Leon would sit for an hour and I'd paint him - and so we went on all day, turn and turn about ... I've forgotten how many days a week we did it, maybe two. It may have taken about two years for Leon to finish two paintings of me ... and [the same] for me to finish two paintings of Leon\". Smart observes that both men had developed \"a habit of applying and then scraping away innumerable layers of paint in the creation of a single work - until, finally, he was satisfied with the result. Often those results have surfaces so thickly encrusted they recall the icing on a cake\".\n\nIn 1953 Kossoff married Rosalind (also known as Peggy) and took up a position at the Royal College of Art, where he studied for the next three years. In his final year, he was given an exhibition at Helen Lessore's Beaux Arts gallery, which was perhaps one of the most important commercial outlets for British artists in the post war decades. Indeed, the exhibition proved instrumental in launching his career.\n\nBy 1959, Kossoff was teaching at three London arts institutions: the Regent Street Polytechnic, Chelsea School of Art, and Saint Martin's School of Art. During this time he moved his studio to Willesden Junction (Northwest London) and, having rued that \"photography has made it difficult for us [figurative painters] to experience the presence of painting\", continued to paint with Auerbach, and to exhibit variously with Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, R. B. Kitaj, and Keith Critchlow. Kossoff created paintings with a near hyperbolic intensity with paint layered so thickly the image buckled under its own weight. As Andrea Rose, former director of visual arts at the British Council, observed, \"There is a sense of struggling with this huge weight of lead paint [...] in quantities I think nobody had used before, and I think the struggle for him was trying to make this viscous material response to what he was feeling about what he was seeing\".\n\nMature Period\n\nIn 1976, Kitaj curated the now famous \"Human Clay\" exhibition at London's Hayward Gallery. It has gone down in history as one of the turning points in late 20th century art. The \"Human Clay\" catalogue featured an essay by Kitaj in which he introduced the term \"School of London\". The definition referred to a cadre of London-based artists including Kossoff, Auerbach, Kitaj, Freud, Bacon, and David Hockey (who was, in fact, based in Los Angeles). Collectively they had countered the fashion amongst avant-gardists for Minimalism and Conceptualism and reinvigorated the critical fortunes of figurativism.\n\nThe School of London artists frequently met at the Colony Room Club in Soho, a somewhat insalubrious members-only drinking club (founded by artists' model Muriel Belcher in 1948). The introverted Kossoff, however, attended infrequently, preferring to spend his time in his studio, wandering the streets of London, or at home, or at the public swimming baths with his wife and young son. However, Kossoff and Freud did form a close connection based on their shared belief that direct observation was crucial to their art, with both men committed to drawing and painting from real life. Commenting on his similarities to Freud, critic Clare Hurley wrote \"Like Lucian Freud, grandson of psychoanalysis's founder Sigmund who had likewise taken refuge from Nazism in London, Kossoff was known for always working with a model, never from a photograph. His models, often friends or family members, sat for hours, days, even years for his portraits. Kossoff remarked that 'every time you look, you see, you experience something different. In the end, the differences amount to a sort of presence.' Perhaps both artists' insistence on creating presence by returning again and again to a model that was always changing owed something to their common experience of displacement, loss and absence\".\n\nLate Period and Death\n\nKossoff finally received the full recognition he deserved in 1995 when was selected as the artist to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale. He did not win over every critic, one dismissed him as \"irrelevant\"; another described his work as \"a footnote to history\", but in 1996 London's Tate Gallery held a triumphant retrospective of his work. Now moving into his twilight years, Kossoff's palette became softer and his work more in tune with nature and his own mortality. This shift is most evident in a series of paintings focused on a single, and ailing, cherry tree. Reflecting on his career, Kossoff insisted that his life's work had \"been an experiment in self-education\" and that even in the later stages of his life he still did not \"seem able to do a drawing\".\n\nKossoff was a private figure, declining to give interviews, or even have his face shown in publicity materials. He was modest, too, ignoring career recognition from the state by turning down a CBE medal. Kossoff continued to produce (albeit more intermittently) and exhibit work, both nationally and internationally, until he passed away due to complications of a stroke in 2019, at the age of 92. He was survived by his wife, their son David, four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\n\nThe Legacy of Leon Kossoff\n\nAs a member of the School of London, Kossoff undertook the critical work of re-examining painting during the post-war period, and championing figurative painting at a time when abstraction was gaining popularity. Says art critic Jonathan Jones, \"Whatever it is that makes art profound, they [The School of London] have it. They are the true heroes of modern British art\". On an individual level, Kossoff is today recognized as one of Britain's preeminent figurative painters. Art critic Roberta Smith referred to him as one of \"the most accomplished painters of the late 20th and early 21st century\" and suggested that he had been \"unfairly overshadowed by fellow British artists like Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, thanks in part to their colorful personal lives\".\n\nSmith contends that \"Kossoff's greatness lies in the extreme way he pits the two basic realities of painting - the actual paint surface and the image depicted - against each another [...] First there is the startlingly heavy, even off-putting, impasto of his oil paint, which sometimes seems more ladled on than conventionally applied with a brush (even a big one), and which gives his surfaces an almost topographical dimension. Then there is the reality of his images, initially swamped in paint, that ultimately battles its way to legibility through a process that thrillingly slows and extends the act of looking\". Speaking shortly after the artist's death, finally, critic Tom Teicholz endorsed this sentiment: \"Kossoff reminds us of the tonic and potency of rebuilding and that art can be a celebration unto itself\".\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Leon Kossoff"
