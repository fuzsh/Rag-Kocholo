The exhibition brings together around 50 works, many from private collections and a number have not been seen publicly for several decades.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nLucian Freud is considered as one of the foremost 20th century British painters, he was the grandson of Sigmund Freud and arrived in Britain in 1933 after leaving Germany to escape the rise of Nazism. Freud moved to London in 1943 and over the next few years he became closely involved with the London arts scene, and formed a close friendship with fellow artist Francis Bacon.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nThe start of the exhibition contrasts his first major self-portrait, Man with a Feather, 1943 alongside his late work Self-portrait, Reflection, 2002.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nThe second section at Freud’s explores his early works, including his drawings and sketchbooks. They reveal that Freud uses his own self-image in a playful way with the mythological guise of Actaeon (Self-portrait with Antlers), 1949 and as a character in illustrations for plays and stories such as Flyda and Arvid, 1947.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nFreud’s work from the 1950s began to take his self portraits and painting much more seriously illustrated by Hotel Bedroom, 1954 and Self Portrait 1956.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nUnusually, Freud often used mirrors to capture his self image which allowed him to change his perspective which is seen in Hand Mirror on Chair, 1966 and Interior with Hand Mirror (Self portrait), 1967.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw Freud’s artistic reputation rising in the UK and internationally and his work gained a self assurance and a new honesty,\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nReflection (Self-portrait), 1985 possesses the penetrating stare for which Freud was famous. In 1993, Freud completed Painter Working, Reflection, 1993 which exposes his ageing body, depicting himself naked but for a pair of boots.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nThe section entitled Reflections in the Studio show Freud’s portraits of other people, including a large scale painting of his son, Freddy Standing, 2000-1.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nSome of the final self-portraits, show the artist now in his 80s, world weary but defiant his face gaunt and built up with thick layers of paint.\n\n© 2019 Visiting London Guide.com – Photograph by Alan Kean\n\nAlthough many artists have portrayed their life’s journey in self portraits, Freud has an unusual relationship with his self image. He stated that “ I don’t accept the information that I get when I look at myself and that’s where the trouble starts” and ” I am not very introspective but I was very shy, so I tried to overcome it by being exhibitionistic.”\n\nThis fascinating exhibition explores these contradictions in Freud’s self portraits, the viewer traces the artist’s life from his youthful playfulness to the sombre reflections of ageing. Strangely considering his family connections, Freud is more concerned with the physical than the psychological. Known as an intensely private man, it is his portraits which are the vehicle that exposes him to the world outside his studio.\n\nVisiting London Guide Rating – Recommended\n\nFor more information and tickets, visit the Royal Academy website here\n\nLondon Visitors is the official blog for the Visiting London Guide .com website.

Self-portraits by world-renowned artists including Rembrandt, Rubens, Artemisia Gentileschi, Lucian Freud and David Hockney but also includes images of artists by their friends, fellow artists and pupils. One of the highlights of the exhibition is the most reliable surviving likeness of Leonardo da Vinci by his student, Francesco Melzi.\n\nPortrait of the Artist contains over 300 objects, including paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and decorative arts ranging in date from the fifteenth to the twenty-first century.\n\nThe exhibition provides evidence that images of artists increasingly appear from the fifteenth century onwards and was linked how artists were perceived in society during the Renaissance. Rather than being perceived as a talented craftsman, artists began to see self-portraiture as a way to demonstrate their talents and a way for self-promotion.\n\nThe first objects in the exhibition consider how self-portraits and portraits of the artist familyand friends were crucial for the artist to practice their skills. Often this drawings were not intended to be seen by a wide audience and were often given away. Self portraits in this section by Rubens, David Hockney and Lucien Freud illustrate how these informal drawings can often expose characteristics of the artists that are not exposed in a formal painting.\n\nFrom these drawings, artist would sometimes undertake a full self-portrait painting to show to potential patrons or customers. How artists portrayed themselves was crucial to appeal to a specific audience. One of the first celebrity British artists was Joshua Reynolds who quickly understood the benefits of self promotion.\n\nMany artists would include in their portraits, friends or family members. In the late eighteenth century, children and animals were often included the pictures to provide evidence of the artist in a family setting.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, artists painted each other either as an homage to the other artist or as a visual record of their friendship. Rubens portrait of his pupil Van Dyck provides evidence of their mutual respect and friendship.\n\nThe fame of certain artists led to portraits of artists being collected from the sixteenth century onwards, Charles I was one of the first people to actively collect and display portraits of artists. By the late 1630s he owned at least twelve portraits of artists, three of which were hung together in his private Breakfast Chamber at Whitehall Palace. Rarely a member of the Royal Family will paint a portrait of an artist, an example in the exhibition is the Duke of Edinburgh’s portrait of artist Edward Seago and Seago’s portrait of the Duke.\n\nGradually artists began to include their self-portrait in a number of ways which affirmed their status. Sometimes the picture may include the artist painting within a landscape or a studio. Landseer even manages to include his dogs into his self-portrait.\n\nIncreasingly it becomes common for artists to use a self-portrait as a way to explore different roles using clothes, props and setting. Some artists took this even further by including themselves in multi-figure narrative scenes. During the Renaissance, several artists included their image within an altarpiece and would sometimes include the person responsible for the commission.\n\nOne common theme from the Renaissance was artists who presented themselves as outsiders to society, the image of artists has the tortured genius added to their mystique. Artemisia Gentileschi‘s unusual self-portrait is perhaps an indication of the difficulty of being a female artist in a period dominated by male artists.\n\nThis fascinating and enjoyable exhibition illustrates the many aspects of self-portraiture and how the role of the artist changed considerably after the Renaissance. Many artists became celebrities in their own time and like today’s celebrities were very particular about their image in front and behind the picture. It is this complexity of motives and inspiration for self portraits that provide many of the themes in the exhibition.\n\nVisiting London Guide Rating – Highly Recommended\n\nFor more information or book tickets, visit the Royal Collection website here\n\nLondon Visitors is the official blog for the Visiting London Guide .com website.

The vast majority of works in the exhibition are from private collections and seldom on public display, therefore the exhibition is a rare opportunity to see Auerbach important works.\n\nThe exhibition in the first six galleries is chronological and provides the possibility of seeing how the artists work has developed over time. His work in the 1950’s was dominated by portraits and building site, the post war building boom in London saw a city rebuilding after the destruction by bombing. It was a process that fascinated Auerbach who painted a whole series of urban landscapes such as Building Site, Earl’s Court, Winter 1953.\n\nEven from the earliest paintings, Auerbach’s trademark style of paint very thickly applied is evident, the depth and texture offers an almost 3D quality that gives the works an unusual quality that engages the viewer in unique way. Depending on where you stand determines a particular viewpoint, a very close inspection usually leads to a loss of definition.\n\nFrom the dark and often sombre tones of the paintings of the 1950s, those in the 1960s seem an explosion of colour in which North London landmarks and regular sitters are painted again and again. However if the subject matter is repetitive, the paintings always offer something new and different. Large works from the 1960s include E.O.W, S.A.W. and J.J.W in the Garden II 1964 and The Origin of the Great Bear 1967-68, a landscape set on London’s Hampstead Heath.\n\nMany of the paintings of the 1970s and 1980s follow the same themes but gained attention and led to Auerbach representing Britain in the 1986 Venice Biennale (1986) and sharing the Golden Lion with Sigmar Polke. If this success was an official recognition of his talents, for the wider public he was not widely known except for his association with Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Leon Kossoff. Sporadic exhibitions and shows over the last 25 years have enhanced Auerbach’s reputation whose lifelong commitment to his own particular style has gained the respect of many contemporary painters.\n\nWalking through the later paintings, it is clear that Auerbach is one of those painters whose work needs to seen in the flesh, photographs flatten the depth and texture which lessens their dramatic effect. Auerbach is also very difficult to categorise, his work is sometimes considered impressionistic but it seems too loose a title for his particular style. Auerbach’s long term relationship with his location and his sitters brings an intensity to his work developed through constant attempts to get the picture ‘right’.\n\nAuerbach had considerable input into the first six galleries working in conjunction with the curator of the exhibition and selector of the last two rooms, Catherine Lampert, who has had a long working relationship with Auerbach, and has sat for him in his studio every week for 37 years.\n\nThis exhibition, a retrospective of one of Britain’s most inventive and original artists will introduce Auerbach to a new audience and gives considerable insights into his particular style that has often been very labour intensive, the final picture can sometimes require 30, 50 or perhaps 200 separate versions before the final image suddenly emerges.\n\nVisiting London Guide Rating – Highly Recommended\n\nIf you would like further information or book tickets, visit the Tate Britain website here\n\nFrank Auerbach\n\nTate Britain\n\n9 October 2015 – 13 March 2016\n\nAdult £16.00 (without donation £14.50)\n\nConcession £14.00 (without donation £12.70)\n\nUnder 12s go free (up to four per parent or guardian)\n\nFamily tickets available (two adults and two children 12–18 years) by telephone or in the gallery\n\nLondon Visitors is the official blog for the Visiting London Guide .com website.

Rubens and His Legacy: Van Dyck to Cezanne brings together masterpieces produced during his lifetime, as well as major works by great artists who were influenced by him in the generations that followed.\n\nOne of the aims of the exhibition is to show that Rubens was a more versatile painter than most people realise, in some ways the success of his ‘Rubenesque’ women have obscured his achievements in religious and mythological scenes, landscapes and portraits.\n\nTo illustrate his wide range of abilities, the exhibition is centred around six themes; power, lust, compassion, elegance, poetry and violence. Each theme has paintings and drawings that clearly portray the many influences of Rubens to the following generations.\n\nThe first room considers Ruben’s influence on the English landscape tradition, notably works by Constable such as Cottage at East Bergholt, (c.1833) can be compared to an idealised Belgian countryside by Rubens Evening Landscape with Timber Wagon, (1630-40.)\n\nThe Poetry and Elegance themes charts Rubens influence through his assistant Van Dyck and into the English portrait tradition especially the works of Gainsborough, Reynolds and Lawrence.\n\nOne of the highlights of the show is Tiger, Lion and Leopard Hunt, (1616), it is a painting that is awash with violence and action which demonstrates the struggle between life and death is often brutal and cruel. In the same room, Edwin Landseer’s The Hunting of Chevy Chase (1825-6) plays out a similar drama and the works of Delacroix show the Rubens influence in the type of composition and the sense of action.\n\nThe exhibition moves from action and violence into Contemplation with a religious Triptych, Lamentation ‘Christ in the Straw’ which influenced the religious art of Murillo and Delacroix, and Love with The Garden of Love, (c.1633) . This painting greatly influenced many French painters of love and intrigue in similar settings especially Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard.\n\nAlthough the exhibition illustrates the often direct influence of Rubens onto 18th and early 19th century art, within the Lust theme we see influence into rather more unexpected areas. There is no doubt that Rubens is one of the great painters of the nude incorporating a lustiness and eroticism that have seldom been bettered. It was this art of the flesh that especially appealed to the Impressionists of the late 19th, early 20th century, most notably Renoir, Manet and Cezanne. The exhibition also show two similar depictions of Roman martyr St Cecilia, one by Rubens and the other by Gustav Klimt.\n\nRubens talent was recognised by the most influential people of his time, he worked for the Kings of England and Spain and the Queen of France. His original works, prints and reproductions were in huge demand and there is little doubt in his time, he was one of the most famous artists in the world.\n\nHe also exercised considerable power with numerous connections to people of influence, his iconic ceiling for Banqueting House in Whitehall is said to have brought about the peace between England and Spain. He was certainly held in high regard being knighted in both England and Spain, his drawings for the Banqueting Hall and Marie de Medici are shown in the exhibition.\n\nRather strangely, considering his influences, Rubens towering reputation was attacked in the 18th and 19th century and it become fashionable to knock the great artist. Lord Byron, William Blake and Ingres seemed to have been the main culprits leading to pro and anti Rubens factions.\n\nThis exhibition reminds us, not only that Rubens was a great artist but his wide range of influences to other artists from seventeenth century right up to the present day has often been underestimated. Rubens is the core thread that brings all the various schools together within the exhibition and provides a show of surprising variety and vitality.\n\nThere is also a gallery curated by Jenny Saville RA called La Peregrina, a response to the exhibition that pays tribute to Rubens’s influence right up until today. Alongside new work by Saville herself are paintings by Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Sarah Lucas, Lucian Freud and more.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be one of the must see exhibitions of 2015, and there will a number of events celebrating Rubens and others in the exhibition.\n\nVisiting London Guide Rating – Highly Recommended\n\nFor more details of the exhibition and to book tickets, visit the Royal Academy website here\n\nLondon Visitors is the official blog for the Visiting London Guide .com website.
