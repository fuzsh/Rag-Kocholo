        "text": "This term, I will continue with my painting practice. My project will sort of carry on from last term in terms of theme but I will be moving into figurative work.\n\nIdeas/themes to explore:\n\nportraiture and figurative painting\n\nJuxtaposition of painting styles in one painting\n\nThe value of painted portraits/figures in the age of photography\n\nUsing the process of painting to explore and depict the ‘inner person’, going beyond the superficial\n\nExploring personal identity through the process of painting\n\nContextual research\n\nLucien Freud\n\n‘Lucien Freud’s paintings can be considered in terms of a preoccupation with the relationships between paint as a material substance, figurative images of particular individuals, and personal identity.‘ (Portraiture: Facing the Subejct page 7)\n\nLucian Freud, renowned for his unflinching observations of anatomy and psychology, made even the beautiful people (including Kate Moss) look ugly. One of the late twentieth-century’s most celebrated portraitists, Freud painted only those closest to him: friends and family, wives and mistresses, and, last but not least, himself. His insightful series of self-portraits spanned over six decades. Unusual among artists with such long careers, his style remained remarkably consistent. Perhaps inevitably, the psychic intensity of his portraits, and his notoriously long sessions with sitters have been compared with the psychoanalytic practice of his famous grandfather, Sigmund Freud.\n\nHis early career as a painter was influenced by surrealism, but by the early 1950s his often stark and alienated paintings tended towards realism. Freud was an intensely private and guarded man, and his paintings, completed over a 60-year career, are mostly of friends and family. They are generally somber and thickly impastoed, often set in unsettling interiors and city scapes. The works are noted for their psychological penetration and often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model.\n\nAndrew Salgado\n\nLondon-based artist Andrew Salgado deals with questions of masculinity in his paintings of male figures, which strike a tenuous balance between abstraction and figuration. Salgado resists the term portraiture to describe his work, noting that his paintings strive to capture psychology more than likeness. “I am concerned with the political and social and psychological aspects that operate extra-diegetically to my subject (that is the content) and then in terms of the form of the work,” the artist has said. His works evoke a mood that suggests both aggression and vulnerability—two feelings elicited by an act of violence committed against the artist in 2008. The formal properties of paint are central concerns to Salgado, who employs the visceral materiality of oil paint and the expressive potential of color to create a sense of frailty and potency.\n\n‘I am interested in how the luxurious, silky qualities of oil paint predominate as the fundamental manner to approach the works. This work seeks to distance itself from a literal figurative foundation to engage with an exploration of colour, reduction of forms, and triumph of substance as seductive, overt, and playful. By reducing the literalness of the image in preference of a sensual painted surface, I hope to create work that engages with a continuously forming language of painting and representation.’\n\nThis description matches some of my own aims for my paintings in this project, regarding the relationship between representation and painterly language.\n\nSteve Huston\n\nI have looked at, and got inspiration from this artist purely because I like the aesthetic value of his figurative paintings and the painterly style he uses. His works are poetic, poignant and masterfully powerful and his figures are iconic archetypes of masculine and feminine line and form.\n\nMao Yan\n\nThe contemporary art world tends to favour Chinese artists who use a blatantly “Chinese iconography”. Defying this aesthetic, portrait artist Mao Yan’s work seems to borrow much from the traditional European sensibility. With close visual ties to Rembrandt, Delacroix, and Goya, Mao’s haunting portraits succinctly captures the internal psychology of his subjects.\n\nProminently featured in Mao’s exhibition are six recent portraits of Thomas Rohdewald, an émigré to China who has appeared in the artist’s work over a hundred times. His wistful portrayals of men stand in sharp contrast to his direct, sensual renderings of women.\n\nChinese contemporary art critic Li Xian Ting once listed Mao Yan in ‘Exploration of Realism’ as the representation of Chinese Neo Realism and described his works as ‘portraying an era of disappearing faces’. Mao’s portrait figures transcend race, sex, personality and personal characteristics and are further on combined with humanities, historical elements and so on to become personal spiritual icons. Mao’s concentration and exploration on portrait studies transcends themes of contemporary art practices and has become one of the small groups of artists who doesn’t focus on concepts, behavior and new media, but concentrates on the possibility of reviving language and themes of classical painting. Mao’s oil paintings have been marked as an upgrade in Chinese contemporary oil portraits and his iconic spiritual portraits also established his irreplaceable status in contemporary China.\n\nHe deletes context, often rendering background without any defining characteristics. The idea is to explore painting itself, its mood-making powers, its transformative effects. The defining element in this paradigm is the artist’s soul, not the subject’s.\n\nI note that one of the techniques he uses in his paintings is a limited colour palette, often limited to black/white and one other colour. I may experiment with this in my own work.\n\nCesar Biojo\n\nCesar Biojo defines his work as the controlled result of multiple accidents; the coexistence of two opposites: creation and destruction. Biojo starts with the figurative— constructing a character—and when he feels it is perfect he destroys it with the abstraction of extra paint and spatula rips and drags. The result is a perfect imperfection: a focus on the fragility and ephemerality of the human existence that asks if we were perfect for a moment? And then reassures you yes… but that moment has passed.\n\nAgain, this is another artist with an interesting approach to the relationship between representational painting and the expressive qualities of paint itself.\n\nDevelopment work\n\nExperimenting with painting styles/combinations – the formal qualities of the paint\n\nFigurative compositions\n\nExploring identity through painting\n\nExperimenting with subjects\n\nThe process of painting a subject forces you to study them for a prolonged duration, thus making it possible to go deeper, beyond surface appearances, and capture the essence.\n\nTo start with, I will do a few experimental pieces in the form of self portraits (figurative)\n\nJuxtaposition of realism and gestural/expressionist painting styles within a painting. In these first two paintings, I chose to paint the face and hands realistically and the rest of the body in a more expressive manner.\n\nIn this next piece, I decided to paint the face and other areas in a gestural manner and the torso realistically.\n\nUsing a male subject\n\nAgain, I am experimenting with using different styles and painterly mark making within figurative painting. Experimenting with painterly language to create a visually rich representation of the figure, as to express the value of painting today, where photographic images are rife.\n\nUsing classmates as models\n\nAlso starting to make my own canvases to achieve better quality\n\nExperimenting with different expressive painterly languages and styles within figurative painting.\n\nAn attempt to go beyond surface appearance of a person\n\nFrom the paintings I produce on hand made canvases, select a few (3 or 4?) which are most successful, to be considered as final pieces.\n\nFirst piece – I am quite pleased at how this has turned out, although the subject was not willing to show as much flesh as I would have liked, so I ended up having to paint more clothes instead of the human body. I feel that I definitely need to develop my approach to painting the background to my paintings, as at the moment I am not sure what the best approach is. I also feel that the transition to making my own canvas has definitely helped to improve the quality of my work.\n\nI like some aspects of this painting, but feel that my rendering of the torso, and to some degree the face, let it down a bit, as they are not convincingly three dimensional or realistic. I painted the background in a gestural, painterly manner, but still feel like this is not very effective or complementary to the painting as a whole. Perhaps the background is too busy, and so detracts some of the attention away from the figure. It also feels like the figure has just been superimposed onto the background, rather than belonging to it.\n\nExperiment with minimalist colour palette\n\nAfter looking at Mao Yan’s work, I decided to experiment with a concept he used which is to use only 2 colours within the painting – white mixed with red or black for example. He says this is to shift the focus solely onto the brush strokes and painterly effects. After completion, I am still unsure as to whether this is something I will consider incorporating into a figurative painting. I feel like the limited colour reduces the expressiveness of the painting.\n\nNext painting on self made canvas\n\nThis painting is based on another photoshoot of a classmate. I made the decision to change the scale slightly, so that the figure appears more close up, cropping it to head down to stomach. I think is a better format, as shown by the painting, which I feel is the most successful I have done so far. I am also pleased with how I have successfully incorporated different painting styles, and created smoother transition between them, from the head down. I also felt I needed to develop the background from the first 2 paintings I did, trying to make the figure belong to the surrounding more – I think the background here works better than in the previous paintings.\n\nGoing back to painting myself\n\nFrom the success of the previous painting, I decided to carry on with the format i.e head down to pelvis. I am pleased with the result, in terms of quality of the rendering and also the mix of painterly styles within the painting.\n\nAfter feedback from a tutor, I decided to go back to one of my paintings and re-work a couple of areas. I worked on the torso area in an attempt to make it look more three dimensional and also the background, trying to make it so that the figure ‘belongs’ to its setting. I feel that by making these alterations, I have improved the painting.\n\nIn terms of feedback for my paintings so far, a few people have commented on how they convey a sense of unease and awkwardness, which is probably due to the nature of posing semi-nude for a photograph. I think that this sense of awkwardness is key to creating intrigue , which I feel is beneficial to my work and something I plan to continue with.\n\nI decided to increase the size of canvas for the next painting – 23×40 inches. This creates a more elongated shape, and so allowed me to paint from the head down to the top part of the legs.\n\nThis is the final painting I produced for this project. I do feel like this is probably the most successful piece, and that my paintings have steadily developed throughout the project. I seem to have arrived at a style of composition that I feel works well, and a painterly style which meets at least some of my project aims.\n\nOne of my original aims was to try to reveal some kind of inner truth about the subjects through the paintings – however, on reflection, perhaps the paintings reveal more about me, as the artist, more than the subjects I am portraying.\n\nI have really enjoyed this term’s project and intend to carry on with this theme next term."
