        "text": "Lucian Freud & Vasily Kandinsky – Looking at colour\n\nThe two painters that I have chosen to write about are Lucian Freud and Vasily Kandinsky. I find both these artists work inspirational and on viewing an exhibition of Freud’s work as a young child in the early 1970’s I knew I had to paint and paint people. Both painters but especially Freud have been influential to my work over the years, although I love Kandinsky’s work and can sit for hours viewing it, his style is very alien to the way I work naturally however this doesn’t mean I don’t wish I had his inspiration and talent and sometimes would dearly love to be as ‘free’ with colour, composition and style as he was.\n\nThe two artists had very different informative years and upbringing, Lucian Freud was born in December 1922 in Berlin and was the second son of Ernst Freud. Ernst was the son of the revered Sigmund Freud the renowned psychoanalysis. He grew up within a close family unit in an affluent area of Berlin and he is quoted as saying when asked about his famous lineage;\n\n‘You know how laughter often seals your memory of someone? Well he made me laugh a lot’ (Smee, 2007.p9)\n\nFreud had a very bohemian upbringing and schooling which suited his personality as from a young age he had ambition to become an artist and spent most of his childhood drawing unlike his brothers who were more conventional in their studies. His grandfather Sigmund used to visit the family from time to time and bring Lucian prints by Durer, Brueghel and other prominent artists.\n\nKandinsky in contrast didn’t decide to become an artist until aged thirty in 1896, although similar to Freud he also had a privileged upbringing his Father was a successful tea merchant and was able to pay for private schooling for his son. Kandinsky was highly intelligent and studied to become a lawyer and took a position of Professor at Moscow University where he taught until he suddenly decided his vocation should be that of an artist after seeing an exhibition by Monet in 1895, he particularly was influenced by Monet’s haystack pictures, Kandinsky felt the paintings weren’t just representations of Haystacks they spoke of light and colour,\n\n‘I had the feeling that the subject of the picture was in sense the painting itself…and I wondered if one couldn’t go much further along the same route’ www.encyclopedia.com\n\nHis dramatic change in vocation was going to be a complete contrast to the lifestyle that he already knew,\n\n‘He never acted the part of the Bohemian, always cutting a dash with his dapper appearance and smart suits’ Keevill (2005, p.10)\n\nOne of the most influential people in Freud’s career was Cedric Morris who along with fellow artist Arthur Lett-Haines ran the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing. Freud enrolled at the school aged sixteen after failing to find inspiration at the Central Arts and Crafts School in Holborn. He painted Morris on several occasions one of the more famous portraits is in Tate Britain.\n\nFreud has used a very green tone on the skin of Morris which makes Morris’s complexion look almost sallow; when you look at Freud’s later work he still uses the green tone in the skin tones of his models, although not in such a bold way, it is more subtle in later work, the use of this green tone I feel makes his work instantly recognisable. The cool colours used in the Cedric Morris portrait in the background help the sitter who is positioned very centrally in the picture to stand out in his pink/red shirt. Although it doesn’t show well in this reproduction of the painting, Freud has used the same green tone directly behind the sitter on the floor as he has in areas of the face. The blue roll neck jumper worn underneath the shirt links all the areas of cool blues together, if the jumper wasn’t there I don’t think the painting would work as well; it gives cohesion to the overall colour composition. Freud acknowledged Morris as his mentor and stated,\n\n‘When I was sixteen I went to Cedric Morris’s art school…Cedric taught me to paint and more important to keep at it…He did not say much, but let me watch him work, I have always admired his paintings and everything about him’ (www.tate.org.uk)\n\nFreud’s work over the years has developed but his main focus throughout has been people and animals. His concentration and desire to paint the people he loved, from his wives, his children, Grandchildren to his beloved whippet Pluto, show a desire to produce paintings that demonstrate his impulse, he is quoted as describing his work as,\n\n‘Autobiographical …it’s all to do with hope and memory and sensuality and involvement really’. (Smee, 2007.p23)\n\nIn my eyes all his portraits are a triumph. Smee (2007) states, ‘Freud preferred the literal to the abstract’ (p.14). Maybe this is why I have always been drawn to Freud’s work as I too prefer to paint ‘literally’ rather than abstractly or from my imagination. However I do feel inspired when viewing abstract work of other artists, I think this may be my love of pattern, this could be why I like Kandinsky’s work so much as he uses geometric pattern a lot in his work.\n\nOne of my favourite Kandinsky paintings is Women in Crinolines, painted in 1909.\n\nThe women have been painted without much detail other than their outline, the use of colour is fantastic and you can see the influence that Kandinsky’s recent exposure to Fauvism has had on his work. He uses a limited palette, a mixture of cool and warm colours but takes the tonal values of the colours to their maximum, his brush strokes, although it can’t be seen on this flat image are not consistent throughout the painting, which gives it a certain energy, your eye just darts in and out of the painting all the time. I feel that some of the women in the painting actually look like pieces of topiary in the garden where the painting is set. Although this replication of the painting makes it seem like there is black in certain areas there isn’t its actually very dark blue. The painting is set in a garden in the Bavarian Alps, at the time Kandinsky was part of the formation of a new group of artists called the ‘New Society of Munich Artists’, Kandinsky not only surrounded himself with not only fellow artists but with dancers, musicians and art historians, it is suggested that he felt it would give him a more rounded view of art and culture. Kandinsky was living in Munich at this time which at the time was one of the major artistic centres of Europe.\n\nBoth artists had a determination and drive to create and perfect their art, Gowing (1982) describes Freud’s determination with his painting as ‘Painting has for him the character of his appetite…sharp eyed appreciation which is also a kind of possessiveness’. What Gowing is saying is true, it has been documented that Freud never had a day off; he painted every day including Christmas Day, his determination and drive to achieve and his love for painting stayed with him throughout his career. Paul Klee one of Kandinsky’s fellow students at Munich Academy stated of his friend that,\n\n‘He used to mix his colours on his palette with the greatest diligence and scholarliness’ www.encyclopedia.com\n\nKlee joked that he was so fastidious that Kandinsky could have painted in evening dress, not your typical Bohemian artist.\n\nOne of my favourite paintings by Freud as I have many, which shows his sensitivity and use of colour, is in a private collection but can be seen in reprints of Freud’s work within books. The portrait is called, Sleeping Nude and was painted in 1950, it depicts a young woman reclining on a bed half covered by a blanket, and within the background you can see a fireplace and a wall which has a painted dado rail. The background has been painted in tones of white to black; these tones have also been incorporated into the bed, mattress and blanket. The woman has been painted so finely, her skins tone is almost like porcelain, which is accentuated by her flame red hair. The grey tones are reflected on her left breast where there would be reflection from the mattress and also on parts of her torso. The subtlety of Freud’s use of the grey cool tones is incredible and is balanced so well against the warmer skin tones and redness of the woman’s hair. This painting was in the original exhibition that I was taken to see as a child and the image has stuck with me as even when I look at it today I still think it looks quite macabre but beautiful at the same time.\n\nBoth the artists I have chosen represent to me how differently colour can be used to express your emotions onto a flat surface. Freud’s literal interpretations of the people he loved still move me and inspires me to paint portraits and Kandinsky’s use of colour and shape also inspires the rest of my work.\n\nBibliography:\n\nWeb pages:\n\nwww.encyclopedia.com\n\nwww.tate.org.uk\n\nwww.wasillykandinsky.net\n\nBooks:\n\nGowing.L.
