It is an attempt at a record. I work with people that interest me, and that I care about and think about, in rooms that I live in and know. Lucian Freud\n\nWhat do I ask of a painting? I ask it to astonish, disturb, seduce, convince. Lucian Freud\n\nI remember Francis Bacon would say that he felt he was giving art what he thought it previously lacked. With me, it’s what Yeats called the fascination with what’s difficult. I’m only trying to do what I can’t do. Lucian Freud\n\nI used to find death much scarier when I was younger – I had more to lose. Now, when I see old people driving slowly I want to shout at them. They should live a little more because it’s nearly over for them anyway. Lucian Freud\n\nI paint people not because of what they are like, not exactly in spite of what they are like, but how they happen to be. Lucian Freud\n\nI have a hatred of habit and routine. And what dogs love is just that. They like regular everything, and I don’t have regular anything. I have a timetable, but no routine. Lucian Freud\n\nThe longer you look at an object, the more abstract it becomes, and, ironically, the more real. Lucian Freud\n\nI am only interested in painting the actual person, in doing a painting of them, not in using them to some ulterior end of art. For me, to use someone doing something not native to them would be wrong. Lucian Freud\n\nI want paint to work as flesh, I know my idea of portraiture came from dissatisfaction with portraits that resembled people. I would wish my portraits to be of the people, not like them. Not having to look at the sitter, being them. As far as I am concerned, the paint is the person. I want it to work for me just as the flesh does. Lucian Freud\n\nWhen I look at a body it gives me choice of what to put in a painting, what will suit me and what won’t. There is a distinction between fact and truth. Truth has an element of revelation about it. If something is true, it does more than strike one as merely being so.
