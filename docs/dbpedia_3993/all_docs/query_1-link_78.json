        "text": "Born 1958 USA, Fred Hatt is an artist working in figurative drawing, painting, experimental video, photography, body art, and performance, while exploring light, movement, energy, and the emergence of beauty from chaos. According to the artist, ” For me what is important is not conceptual or iconographic content, but process and practice. Drawing from life is the core practice for a multi-media career that crosses the boundaries between performance and visual arts, between traditional craft and contemporary technologies.Whether making a drawing, a video piece, a photograph or a performance, the focus is on the perception of energy and its expression through light and form, movement and gesture”.\n\nFred Hatt has been influenced by Lucian Michael Freud. Freud was a German-born British painter. Known chiefly for his thickly impastoed portrait and figure paintings, he was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time. His works are noted for their psychological penetration and their often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model."
