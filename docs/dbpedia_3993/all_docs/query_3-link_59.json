        "text": "Summary of Michael Andrews\n\nMichael Andrews stands out as a distinctive figure in 20th-century British art for his ability to weave complex psychological and environmental themes into his work. Known for his versatile style, which ranged from haunting portraits to expansive landscapes, Andrews captured the essence of his subjects with a unique blend of realism and abstraction. His paintings often reflect a deep engagement with the natural world and human experience, and his later work is imbued with a contemplative, almost spiritual quality. What sets Andrews apart is his meticulous attention to detail, his ability to evoke profound emotional and intellectual responses through his use of light, color, and composition and his detailed and eclectic source material.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nAndrews' preoccupation with the human figure reveals his deep fascination with the complexities of social interactions and the subtleties of personal identity. This interest allowed him to focus on themes of isolation, connection, and the passage of time in his work. Whilst in his earlier \"party pieces\" these themes are more obvious, some of his later art uses nature as a metaphor for human interactions or contains smaller, more symbolic figures.\n\nAndrews' keen observation and meticulous depiction of outdoor settings, from the vistas of the Australian outback to the rugged landscapes of Scotland, reflect his deep reverence for nature. Through his work, Andrews invites viewers to consider their relationship with the environment, highlighting the interconnectedness of life and emphasizing both the impermanence and continuity of the natural world.\n\nIn his later years, Andrews underwent a significant transformation in his methods of painting, most notably by creating images through spraying paint onto his canvases. This allowed him to achieve a more atmospheric and ethereal quality to his work. This experimentation can be seen as a forerunner of aerosol art and it influenced a generation of artists who saw the potential of the technique to convey mood and ambiance in innovative ways.\n\nThe Life of Michael Andrews\n\nImportant Art by Michael Andrews\n\nBiography of Michael Andrews\n\nYouth\n\nMichael Andrews was the second child of Thomas Victor Andrews, an employee of Norwich Union Insurance, and Gertrude Emma Green. He was raised in a devout Methodist household and attended the City of Norwich School. During his final year, he took art classes in the evenings and on Saturday mornings, studying oil painting with artist Frank William Leslie Davenport, a member of the Norwich Twenty group of painters.\n\nEducation and Early Training\n\nAfter school, Andrews completed his National service, spending most of the two years in Egypt, where he used his free hours to paint watercolors. Immediately afterwards, he enrolled in the Slade School of Fine Art, where he studied under William Coldstream, William Townsend, Lawrence Gowing, Lucian Freud, and Francis Bacon. His peers and friends included Victor Willing, Keith Sutton, Diana Cumming, Euan Uglow, and Craigie Aitchison.\n\nIn 1953, he was awarded a scholarship in painting to the British School at Rome. Here, Andrews befriended Italian film director Lorenza Mazzetti, and painted a portrait of her at the Spanish Steps. Mazzetti then invited Andrews to co-star alongside Eduardo Paolozzi as a feaf character in her film Together (1955), which was shot in London.\n\nMature Period\n\nIn 1959, Andrews' painting A Man Who Suddenly Fell Over (1952), created while he was still a student at Slade, was acquired by the Tate. Calvocoressi notes that this was the beginning of Andrews' \"whole interest in human behavior\". According to Andrews, the semi-autobiographical painting was about \"the complete upsetting of someone's apparently secure equilibrium and about their most immediate efforts at recovery and their attempt to conceal that they have perhaps been badly hurt or upset\".\n\nDuring the 1950s, Andrews became enamored with London's party scene. Though shy and self-conscious, he frequently joined fellow artists Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, and Francis Bacon on social outings at the Colony Room, a private members' club. Arts correspondent Paul Levy explains that \"This dingy, smoke-filled, one-room, after-hours Soho drinking club was run by the hard-boiled Muriel Belcher, who, if you were male and she liked you, called you either by a girl's name or by the rudest of all four-letter words\". Andrews painted a mural in the club, as well as executing a painting, Colony Room I (1962), which depicted a party scene there.\n\nAndrews' paintings of the next decade or so were similar \"party pictures\", which curator Richard Calvocoressi describes as \"paintings about human beings losing their self-consciousness, losing their inhibitions, [and which] kind of portray society in a state of delirious disintegration\". In 1958, Andrews had his first solo exhibition at London's Beaux Arts Gallery (where he had a second show in 1963). That same year, he began teaching at Slade, and at the Chelsea School of Art, though he admitted he did not enjoy teaching. Around this time, he was sharing a studio with Irish painter Patrick Swift.\n\nIn 1961, Andrews relocated to his own studio space in London. In 1963, he began living with June Keeley, a woman whom Levy calls \"warm\" and \"pretension-deflating\". The two later married, and had one daughter, Melanie, in 1970. Following Andrews' death, Melanie shared warm memories from her childhood, such as her father teaching her to swim in a lake in Scotland. This moment was later turned into a painting by Andrews titled Melanie and Me Swimming (1978-79). Though his party-going days were behind him, Andrews continued to see his School of London artist friends, such as Freud, who would spend Christmas Day with the Andrews family each year, insisting on watching The Wizard of Oz.\n\nLate Period and Death\n\nFrom around 1970, Andrews' work shifted in tone, as he was increasingly inspired by Zen Buddhism. He stated, \"Zen is active meditation (painting in my case) leading to sudden enlightenment which is unself-- or selfless-- consciousness which is realising things just as they are: interdependent. [...] You don't lose individuality or identity by dropping your idea of concept of yourself (your ego) or by acknowledging the fact of interdependence; on the contrary it becomes subtle and unrestricted. That's my understanding anyway.\" He ceased to paint portraits, and focused instead on landscapes.\n\nWhile he continued to paint scenes of London and the surrounding areas, art critic John Russell explains that \"from 1975 onward, Scotland seized Mr. Andrews's imagination, in part for its stern and often tumultuous history, in part for the austere and geometrical ritual of deer stalking in castle country\". Andrews and his wife took their daughter to vacation in Scotland every summer, where they stayed on a friend's estate in Perthshire. Andrews developed an interest in deer hunting, of which he painted several scenes. Calvocoressi notes that in these works, Andrews was concerned primarily with the relationship between man and nature.\n\nIn 1978, Andrews relocated to Geldeston on the Norfolk/Suffolk border, before moving to the Norfolk village of Saxlingham Nethergate in 1981. He said of the town \"I like the antiquity of it. I was terribly affected by the fact we are living in a 7th-century village (a favourite century of mine)\". In 1983, he took a trip to Ayers Rock in Australia, which became the subject of several of his sketches and paintings. In 1988, Andrews served on the Board of Trustees of The National Gallery in London, although he found the journey from Norfolk to be cumbersome, and did not complete his term.\n\nDuring this period, Andrews moved away from the heavy impasto favored by the School of London artists, instead using a spraygun to apply thin layers of acrylic paint, and even at times leaving parts of the canvas bare. Throughout his career, Andrews shared qualities with his School of London peers, such as his preoccupation with the human form and with landscapes, particularly the relationship between mankind and the natural world. As Moorhouse and Tufnell note, \"it was his firm conviction that some sense of the world and our place within it can be formed from reflecting on human nature. [...] Even when people are not physically present in his work - as in his paintings of balloons, fish and certain landscapes - his images are redolent with human significance\". Yet, as curator Richard Calvocoressi argues, \"in many ways, Andrews was very different from the other painters in the [the School of London]. They were studio-bound artists, painting portraits and claustrophobic interiors. But with Andrews, after a certain date, there are few portraits, and practically no self-portraits. He spent most of the Seventies and Eighties painting big, wide landscapes\".\n\nIn 1991, Andrews had his first and only New York show, at the Grey Art Gallery of New York University. The following year he moved back to London to a flat in Battersea, near the Thames. The river was the subject of his final work, Thames Painting: The Estuary (1995). Shortly after moving back to London, he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He underwent surgery in 1994, but died the following year. His funeral was held at St. Mary's Church, Battersea, and he was buried in Perthshire.\n\nThe Legacy of Michael Andrews\n\nCompared to his School of London peers, such as Francis Bacon, Leon Kossoff, and Lucian Freud, Andrews and his work was much less well known. Tate director John Rothenstein once stated that he \"was in danger of being taken for a rumour rather than a person\". This is due, in part, to his shy, even reclusive, personality, and in part because he worked painstakingly slowly, had a relatively low output over the course of his forty-year career, and exhibited infrequently. Nevertheless, as curators Paul Moorhouse and Ben Tufnell recognize, Andrews as \"one of Britain's leading post-war painters\" whose work \"was characterised by intensity of observation and exacting technical virtuosity\".\n\nFreud, in fact, saw Andrews' limited production as a positive, once stating that \"Andrews is such an economical painter, he only paints masterpieces\". Art critic Matthew Collings writes that \"The scenes [Andrews] summoned up from lively and exciting surfaces were dreamy and a little weird, like visions: faces, furniture, landscape, decorations, a drunken mood, the London glamour scene. All this but with richly elusive literary associations, too, as if his model of painting was that it should also be a bit like a book\". Art critic John Russell asserts that \"No living painter was better at taking a well-beaten subject and giving it a whole new spin\". Andrews' dreamlike creations and surreal landscapes went on to influence the Magic Realism of artists like Scottish painter Peter Doig.\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Michael Andrews"
