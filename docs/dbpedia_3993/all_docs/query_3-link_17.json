        "text": "In the history of European Art during the first quarter of the twentieth century many Art movements adopted a manifesto, few survived for long or were adhered to by more than one or two devotees. By mid-Century they had been abandoned and the centre of the Avant-Guard had shifted from Paris to New York. But in London in 1954, one artist wrote his own manifesto. Lucian Freud wrote ‘Some Thoughts on Painting’ for the July 1954 edition of Encounter magazine. It would remain his only written publication, but he would continue to work by its principles all his life, even through changes in style and technique. In ‘Some Thoughts on Painting’ he starts by telling us that his object in painting is to move the senses and give an intensification of reality. With this principle in mind, he would work in relative obscurity for many years until he emerged as one of the great painters of the century. Why is 1954 such a pivotal year for Freud, why is the painting ‘Hotel Bedroom’ so significant, and how did this one magazine article set the tone for a lifetime’s work?\n\nFreud tells us in ‘Some Thoughts on Painting’ that the Painter ‘makes real to others his innermost feelings about all that he cares for’ (Freud, 1954), and it is true that he never used professional models; his subjects tended to be friends, both male and female, lovers, wives, daughters, his mother. To some sitters he is tender, to others it is often said that he is brutal, even cruel in his depiction of them. If indeed, ‘A secret becomes known to everyone who views the picture through the intensity with which it is felt’, (Freud, 1954) then that is quite evident in his 1954 double portrait of himself and his second wife, Lady Caroline Blackwood, who was the eldest daughter of the 4th Marquess of Dufferin and Ava. It is a painting which would prove to be a pivotal point in the artist’s career and mark a significant change in painting style and practice. After this work he would not sit to paint again, ‘Once I stood up I never sat down again’ (Quoted in Feaver, 2002, p.28). After this work he would abandon the use of fine sable brushes and a linier style and take up Hog Hair brushes and adopt a more painterly approach which would lead to the heavy impasto which he is best known for. He would also stop drawing for many years. ‘The idea of doing paintings where you’re conscious of the drawing and not the paint just irritated me,’ he said, ‘… you could tell what a good draughtsman I was from my painting [they said] … but I thought if that’s all true, I must stop.’ (Quoted in Smee, 2008, p.5)\n\nIn the painting entitled ‘Hotel Bedroom’ (1954) we see Caroline lying in bed; she is apparently clothed under the sheets. Gone is the carefree young woman of ‘Girl in bed’ (1952) or ‘Girl Reading’ (1952) , painted when the couple first eloped to Paris and Freud was still married to his first wife Kitty Garman. Now we see a woman who appears old before her time; her hand presses into her cheek in an attitude of anxiety, little finger at the corner of her mouth gnawing at the finger nail. Freud talks about the aura given out by a person being as much a part of them as their flesh (Freud, 1954), and that is in evidence here: Caroline stares into space contemplating the hopelessness of her situation, how the thrill of the start of the affair had descended in to misery. How many hours has she lain there, endlessly posing for a man whose obsessive way of working compels his model to be there, in that pose, whether he is painting her or not? He may be painting the bed sheets or the view out of the window, the basin on the table in the room across the street opposite, or the other figure in the room, but he still requires his model to be present.\n\nAccording to Freud the presence of the model impacts upon the very atmosphere, the air, around the subject. Two human beings can be as different as a candle and an electric light bulb. The way in which the artist observes and perceives this atmosphere in turn affects the feeling a painting gives out (Freud, 1954). These ideas are not new in Freud’s time of course. The Impressionists had been concerned with the relationship between light, tone and colour and capturing their effects on the atmosphere. To capture the effects of light with any conviction it is necessary to develop an understanding of tone and the ability to analyse a subject in terms of the lightest, darkest and mid-tones in between. Freud developed into a highly skilled tonal painter, employing a limited pallet to describe the relative darkness or lightness of his subject in great detail.\n\nSo, we become aware that in ‘Hotel Bedroom’, Caroline is there under his intense gaze as he studies every facet of her skin, her hair, her fingernails, and painstakingly attempts to reproduce the effects of light that he observes in paint with his fine sable brushes. ‘The painter’s obsession with his subject is all he needs to drive him to work’ (Freud, 1954), he tells us, and work obsessively is what he undoubtedly did right until the end of his long life. He needs to communicate his feelings about the ‘object’ with such intensity that his feelings become infectious; this, he says, is limited and even denied to those who use the language of purely abstract forms, ‘depriving themselves of provoking more than an aesthetic emotion’ (Freud, 1954).\n\nFor a man whose life appeared to be driven by his passions and emotional mood swings he makes what must be a counter-intuitive statement when he says that ‘…the painter needs to put himself at a certain emotional distance from the subject….’(Freud, 1954). Here, the whole atmosphere seems to be emotionally charged. Freud himself lurks in the background, a figure in the shadows, menacing, brooding but at the same time sad. This is a narrative piece, it tells us all we need to know of the state of the relationship, a piece of theatre and quite unusual in Freud’s work in that he, himself, is one of the players in the scene. It is perhaps the only painting in Freud’s canon to carry such a clear narrative.\n\nA comparative piece is perhaps the painting ‘Large Interior, W9’ (1973), which shows the artist’s mother Lucie Freud seated in front of his bare breasted lover who is lying on a bed behind. The scene suggests, perhaps, an elderly physiatrist and her patient. Under the chair in the foreground is a mortar and pestle which, for some, has sexual connotations in a Freudian manner. But this scene differs from ‘Hotel Bedroom’ in that, on this occasion, the two people were not in the room at the same time. Freud has contrived a situation, a sort of Freudian masterpiece. Freud had kept his mother at a distance for many years. It was not until after the death of his father, when his mother had attempted suicide, that Freud let her back into his life. His mother, he felt, had always been far too interested in what he was doing and who he was seeing, even going as far as asking his girlfriends for his love letters, so here he puts his mother in the same room as a presence in the relationship between himself and his lover. The Freudian implications are endless.\n\nFreud painted his Mother many times during the last years of her life. “I started working from her because she lost interest in me; I couldn’t have if she had been interested” (Feaver p.27). In ‘Some Thoughts on Painting’ Freud says that a subject kept under close observation will reveal all. Perhaps his constant observation of his Mother was an attempt to reveal some kind of truth, about her, or about himself. Are these paintings a kind of Freudian self-portrait?\n\nWhen Freud painted himself he was as brutal, even more so perhaps than he was to his sitters. So, to what extent is ‘Hotel Bedroom’ a self-portrait? The mirror is the medium for self-portrait, so is this a mirror image? Does that account for the shadowy nature of the figure of Freud? It is not easy to decipher but it may account for the odd juxtaposition in the composition. Perhaps the whole piece was painted as a mirror image. Many self-portraits try to disguise the artist and camouflage his true identity, dressing up and theatricalizing and acting a part as Rembrandt did. Like Rembrandt, Freud also painted himself throughout his life, recording the ageing process, and Freud was equally anti-narcissistic. Rather than flattering himself he emphasized his ageing, deepening the lines on his face mapping his decay. But rather than an intense examination of himself, the Lucian in ‘Hotel Bedroom’ appears to be a player in a scene. It is the relationship between the two people that is scrutinised here.\n\nCaroline disliked the painting. She complained that her husband had made her look old before her time, a complaint not unusual for Freud’s sitters. Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire said the same about Freud’s portrait of her, Woman in a White Shirt (1956-7) (Auerbach, 2004). The relationship between Caroline and Lucian didn’t last and they divorced in 1958.\n\nWhat Freud was doing in the 1950s cannot be said to be anything approaching the mainstream in the world of Fine Art. Painting the human figure or producing paintings with narrative content was not fashionable amongst those who considered themselves as the Avant-Garde. Due to the second world war the centre of the Art world had shifted from Paris to New York, where Greenburg’s theories about painting had bolstered the rise of Abstract Expressionism and decreed that it was impossible for an ‘advanced’ artist to paint a portrait. The Modernist influence of Picasso, Matisse and Kandinsky was still prevailing in Europe. The rise of Abstract Expressionism seemed unstoppable. The representational artists in Britain seemed out of touch, an anachronism. In 1949 Alfred Munnings, then President of the Royal Academy, had made a notorious and ill-advised speech (some say a drunken rant) against the rise of Modernism. Broadcast live on the BBC, Munnings had accused his fellow artists of shilly-shallying and invited Sir Winston Churchill, who was sitting next to him at the R.A. annual dinner, to join him in kicking Picasso’s arse (Booth, 2010, p7). Munnings career and reputation did not survive the incident. Prominent thinkers and writers were hailing a new era in painting. Theologian Etienne Gilson, delivering the 1955 A.W. Mellon Lecture in Fine Art said that ‘Painters can never again indulge in the easy pleasures of imitational or representational art’, and that painting had been forced to submit to a ‘Cure of abstractionism’ (quoted in, Wood, 2009). And even though E.H. Gombrich could not abide what he saw as the smug post-war consensus amongst the educated elite, that abstraction had vanquished figuration once and for all, even he could not foresee a return to figuration when writing in 1956 (Wood, 2009).\n\nFreud’s assertion that what the painter is attempting is an act of creation, painting in the hope that ‘the picture might spring to life’, the so called ‘Pygmalion’s Power’ referred to by E. H. Gombrich as the artist’s attempt to rival creation itself was seen as archaic and belonging to a previous century and was totally unfashionable by the mid-twentieth century (Wood, 2009). Freud understood, however, that this aspiration was always doomed to failure. Freud was aware that he could not deliver reality ‘but only a coded message about reality’ (Bryson, 1983, p.21), but he needed to continue in the attempt because ’this great insufficiency’ (Freud, 1954) is what drove him on.\n\nHe was not alone, though, in his continued devotion to representational painting. The so-called London School artists, most notable amongst whom was Francis Bacon along with Frank Auerbach, Freud’s closest friends, continue to paint the figure and represent the world as they saw it. In fact, Freud and Bacon, who had first met in 1944, become almost inseparable by the early 1950s. Caroline complained that she saw as much of Bacon as she did her husband. Bacon, for one, had managed to buck the trend towards abstraction and was gaining an international reputation. Bacon would prove a key influence in Freud’s move away from a linear style to a more painterly one. Bacon encouraged Freud to be more daring, more spontaneous. Freud didn’t want to paint like Bacon, it was his personality that affected Freud. Bacon believed the paint itself carried the form, and he packed a lot into a single brush stroke (Feaver, 2007, p.21). Bacon was able to convey real meaning, and this is what Freud took from Bacon.\n\nFreud saw that paint itself counted for everything in Bacon’s work as it did for Auerbach. Their approach was quite different though. Bacon would apply paint thinly and quickly onto the un-primed back of the canvas and finish a work in a morning. Auerbach would take a long time to paint many layers, creating a thick impasto, giving his work an almost sculptural quality. These influences became ever more intense over the years and lead to the most famous works by Freud, the monumental naked portraits. The influence of Bacon and Auerbach added to Freud’s ‘intensification of reality’ (Freud, 1954) result in the shockingly frank and sculptural works, Leigh Bowery, seated (1990) , Benefits Supervisor Resting, (1994) and Leigh Under the Skylight, (1994).\n\nFifty years after writing ‘Some Thoughts on Painting’, Lucian was asked to take another look at it to see if he would add anything. On re-reading it he said that, ‘I left out the vital element without which painting can’t exist: Paint. Paint in relation to a painter’s nature. One thing more important than the person in the painting is the picture’. (quoted in Feaver, 2007, p.37).\n\nLucian Freud is now considered to be most influential figure painter of his generation. Today, figure painting has re-emerged as a significant force in contemporary art and Lucian Freud is sited by artists such as Jenny Saville whose monumental nude self-portraits show all the imperfections and realities of human flesh. Another is Cecily Brown’s near sexually explicit paintings which show the influence of both Freud and Bacon. And we should also include the giant sculptures of Ron Mueck, whose recreations of naked humans on an enormous scale surely take their lead from Freud.\n\nWe see therefore that what is at the heart of the work of Lucian Freud is the intensity of his gaze and the depth of his feeling, these are the elements that set him apart.\n\nIn 1954 in a hotel bedroom in Paris Freud would begin to leave behind one way of working and start to move towards an approach which would go a long way to fulfilling the objectives which he sets out in ‘Some Thoughts on Painting’. A large part of which would take the form of a close examination of himself through the study of those around him, the Freudian personality bending everything ‘…entirely for his own use and pleasure’ (Freud, 1954). Throughout his long life he would continue to examine the ‘aura’ of the human animal going far beyond the mere aesthetic, putting even his mother under the same scrutiny as himself. His wish to make work that ‘doesn’t merely remind us of life but take on a life of its own’, (Freud, 1954) would cause him to be isolated, even alienated from the Avant-Garde elite for many years. But finally, it was his ability to create a physical presence on canvas by the way he used paint, which made it ‘…spring to life’ (Freud, 1954).\n\nReferences\n\nAuerbach, J (2004) ‘Lucian Freud Portraits’, (Film) Jake Auerbach Films Ltd.\n\nBooth, S (2010) ‘Sir Alfred Munnings’, Philip Wilson Publishers Ltd.\n\nBryson, N (1983) ‘Vison and Paining. ‘The logic of the gaze’, Yale University Press.\n\nFeaver, W (2002) ‘Lucian Freud: Life into Art’.
