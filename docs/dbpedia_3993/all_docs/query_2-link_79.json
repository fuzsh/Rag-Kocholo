Here’s this week’s edition of things I’ve enjoyed, hoping they might inspire your own work too…\n\nNew exhibition\n\nEXHIBITION: Lucian Freud: New Perspectives National Gallery, London, until 22 January\n\nThere is a new Lucian Freud exhibition at the National Gallery, London. This video gives a great insight into some of the iconic pieces at the show.\n\nAnd if you can’t make it to a live exhibition, no worries; this research shows how 3-minutes of online art viewing can significantly increase your well-being!\n\nI’ve been listening too…\n\nPODCAST: Death of an Artist\n\nWas the famous minimalist sculptor Carl Andre involved in the death of his up-and-coming artist wife Ana Mendieta? A new podcast series from art historian Helen Molesworth revisits the trial of sculptor Carl Andre.\n\nAndre was charged with murder and the art world split in two. Host Helen Molesworth revisits Mendieta’s death and the trial that followed, and interrogates both the silence and the protest that have accompanied this story ever since\n\nWhat’s on my Easel…\n\nMarket Day Peaches New Acrylic Course..coming soon!\n\nJust putting the finishing touches to a NEW morning painting still life course. This time we introduce fabric and a glass vase alongside some fab peaches in a bowl. I’ll send out a launch-week offer in the next couple of weeks.\n\nYou can see the first two in the series here:\n\nMorning Paintings: Modern Still Life\n\nMorning Paintings: Cornish Seascape\n\nHave a creative week!"
