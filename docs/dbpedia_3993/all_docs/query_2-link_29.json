        "text": "‘I’ve always wanted to create drama in my pictures, which is why I paint people. It’s people who have brought drama to pictures from the beginning. The simplest human gestures tell stories.’\n\n‘The way you paint yourself, you’ve got to try and paint yourself as another person.’\n\nThis week I have chosen to feature Lucian Freud’s self-portrait partly because it is a painting that I have loved since the first time I saw it many years ago, but also as a result of viewing a BBC programme about Freud’s life and work; Lucian Freud: Painted Life. This documentary, along with an exhibition of Freud’s Portraits at the National Portrait Gallery, was begun in collaboration with Freud but finished after his death on the 20th July 2011.\n\nFreud is best known for his huge full-body nudes of models, these being his friends, family, lovers or selected sitters. His paintings were often completed after hours, days, weeks and months of observation and studio time, painted directly from life, meaning that models often had to pose for hours at a time. This gave Freud ample time to reveal the moment when ‘the model looks most like himself’ – not only capturing a physical resemblance, but also the individual in their entirety, the internal in the physical in the image. Also the artist represented in the person they are painting, so Projects himself onto the model. But his paintings provide a psychological record of Freud’s life, recording his closest companions and his vision of his personal relationships.\n\nWhilst these provided a reflection of the artist himself it is his self-portraits which grant the viewer an intimacy unattainable in his paintings of others. Reflection (Self-Portrait) was painted in Freud’s later years when he was in his sixties and is one of a series of self-portraits he completed throughout his career. It is an intense painting and the result of meticulous observation and self-scrutiny, Freud was turning his artistic vision upon himself, a process he still found challenging. Reflection on his own life, ‘youthful arrogance gone’. tumultuous personal life, divorce in 1959, drank heavily, involved in brawls, many lovers and children, man of passions and charm.\n\nThe portrait focuses only on his head and upper torso, (we can assume that he is naked but not know), and it is a vision of the artist in the act of painting. His head casts a shadow over his chest, lit from above, highlighting the contours of his face. I can’t be sure if this was one of the artist’s day (natural light) or night (artificial) paintings. All attention is focused on this face as the background is almost empty, composed of shades of brown, swept with brush strokes equal to those in on his torso. This figure is not melding with his surroundings, but is composed of similar matter. The whites of his eyes are not white, but instead the same dull brown of the wall, almost as if we are seeing straight through him. There is a strong sense of presence despite his gaze being focused somewhere else.\n\nThis is a result of Freud’s handling of the paint which is one of the great elements of his work. Concentration on flesh, thick heavy and coarse (impasto), giving his head a solidity against the smooth flatness of the wall behind him. Freud would often clean his brush after each stroke so the colour would remain constantly variable.\n\nGuardian art critic Jonathan Jones describes him as a ‘truth-teller’ with an ‘uneasy portrayal of the human condition’, and in this way my thoughts are brought to Francis Bacon, one of Freud’s contemporaries, friends and sitters. Bacon’s work records the tortured inner experiences of people, bodies twisted, contorted, obliterated with elements exaggerated above others, gasping mouths straining with teeth. This inner becomes the outer, the surface, His portraits are of individuals, one of whom is Freud, who features in a number of Bacon’s paintings, including his triptych, Three Studies for a Portrait of Lucian Freud (1965). They are dark and nihilistic portrayals of humanity, with faces like hacked meat, almost unrecognisable as human but also distinctly marked and shaped by their yearning and beleaguered humanity. The body becomes thought, feeling and suffering embodied.\n\nIn constrast Freud’s portraits of his sitters focus on the surface, the skin and hair, the closest he came to the contorted figures of Bacon is his self-portrait of 1963. Realist painter. This is what Self-Portrait (Reflection) records in such a rich way. The skin represents the experience of the body, life is etched into the faces, the wrinkles, the sun damage. Observational intensity.’He said he used mirrors in order to paint the person he could not see in his mind’s eye, to try and see himself in unexpected ways.’ – this was Freud’s way of revealing a truth. Introspective.\n\nStrrong composure, dark eyes, black like holes in the face, if the eyes are the window to the soul Freud’s was certainly not full of sweetness and light. Sense of unease, a tension in the painting, his gaze could simply be him focusing on his own image in the mirror, back to paint, so it is not only a reflection of the artist but also of his own creation, it is an image of a painting being painted. It is also tempting to imagine that his gaze is that of a man thinking and considering, what? Life, art, himself. Not only is he painting himself but he is also ruminating on the act of self-representation. This was a subject that we know Freud took into consideration and had to weigh up, to paraphrase the documentary: ‘he found self-portraits difficult as he did not want to portray himself too well or too badly.’"
