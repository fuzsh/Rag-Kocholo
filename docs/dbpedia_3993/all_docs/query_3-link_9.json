        "text": "Louise Liddell, former model for Freud\n\nI find it hurts to look at this latest painting. An old man's vanity is just excruciatingly painful. I was grateful to have been painted at a time when his powers were at their greatest.\n\nJonathan Jones, Guardian art writer\n\nLucian Freud can do anything he likes because he is a genius. If he painted this model not kneeling at his feet but murdered with his palette knife that would be fine with posterity - and at 82 posterity is all he has to worry about. Is it touching? Is it creepy? Neither - it is a great painting.\n\nWomen really do fall at Freud's feet to have him portray them - Kate Moss, the Queen; he's not some filthy old fantasist. Yet far more striking than the model's adoring pose is the mess of paint on his studio wall that takes the form of a burning bush, the mystical cloud in which God appeared to Moses. The flesh and the spirit, and painting's doomed attempt to reconcile them - those are Freud's themes in this masterpiece. What the woman is to him, and he to her, will never be disentangled.\n\nSuzanne Moore, columnist\n\nI think it should be called Hidden Artist, Crouching Woman. Is it narcissistic? It certainly does make him look younger than he actually is. When you look at her pose, she could be making a speech or she could be angry, like she could be shaking somebody off herself, I can't say. I like his work but I'm just not a fan of women crouching at people's feet.\n\nI hate to be a cliched feminist but it is a power relationship with a man in clothes and a woman without her clothes, which he has also emphasised by the fact she barely comes up to his knees. It's strange to me that she's so small, childlike almost - she's smaller than the painting that he's painting, which says something. Maybe it should actually be called Hidden Anger, Crouching Woman.\n\nRosie Boycott, journalist\n\nI think it's wonderful. I like the way his women are strong, tough and earthy, the opposite of airbrushed, and this woman is no different. There's this air of her being supplicant, but she's also getting on with her own stuff - you don't get the impression she's gazing up at him, maybe she is tugging on his trousers or talking to him, but she's not just sitting on the floor waiting to be painted. Yes it's narcissistic, but isn't all painting? Yes, he's creating her as he wants her to be. But I don't think he puts women on pedestals, and I don't think he is any worse to women than he is to men. I hope people don't go on about him being 82 and she a young woman. If it keeps him young and keeps him painting, I'm all for it.\n\nSandy Nairne, director, National Portrait Gallery\n\nThe pose is certainly unusual and gives the strange feeling of coitus interruptus. It does bring into question - and, I think, subverts - the idea of the woman sitter being the subject of the artist's gaze and therefore our gaze: here you have the model admiring the artist rather than the other way around.\n\nThere's a playful element to it - the very title has a note of playfulness. I get the sense he was intrigued by this idea of creating the studio. This is a studio with a capital S, with the paint, the rags and the sense of the play between the model and artist and the complicity between them.\n\nI think any self-portrait is extremely narcissistic, but you can't help but separate it from questions of consciousness: we look at it and stand in the place of the artist and it brings questions about ourselves.\n\nAdrian Searle, Guardian art critic\n\nThe artist is a dog lover. Perhaps he has mistaken the model for a faithful labrador. But the pose is so unlikely and ambiguous that I can't make head nor tail of it. I find it psychologically unconvincing, theatrical. Her hand is closer to his wallet than his cock. Her other hand is around his ankle. Maybe she's holding him like this to stop him falling over.\n\nIt isn't so very long since Freud painted himself old, raddled and naked, a sort of vainglorious and possibly impotent old man waving a palette knife in the air. I see this painting in somewhat the same vein, as a self-mocking image. There he is, stooped among all the rubbish in his studio. He's not looking at us, but in a mirror (the composition of the painting-within-the-painting is reversed).\n\nPerhaps the model is imploring the artist to give it a rest: \"Let's stop now Lucian, you're making yourself ill.\"\n\nShami Chakrabarti, director, Liberty\n\nAt first glance, of course I noticed the inequality between the man and the woman. He's dressed and she's naked at his feet, pulling at his leg. But on reflection, I think it's a really sad painting and it's clear that that's not a real woman. Whatever the painter says, she's not a person here - she represents something else in his life. So I don't feel angry or outraged.\n\nI see one person in this picture and that's the artist with something nagging at him - something potentially beautiful and vulnerable, but also an obligation, a nuisance. Is it an inspiration or is it a burden? Ultimately this is a slightly sad, troubled portrait of an artist who doesn't feel perhaps quite the way he did.\n\nSarah Dunant, novelist\n\nI was hoping to see the visual equivalent of Auden's Wedding Cake Left Out in the Rain. Instead, I found something that was both poignant and witty. It would have been delicious if Freud had been naked and the model fully clothed. It's a mixture of the poignancy of old age and the continual creative arrogance of genius. I think it is self-mocking, but it could have been more dangerous.\n\nNatasha Walter, writer\n\nWhen I first looked at this picture I just saw it as a glorifying depiction of the powerful male artist and the adoring model, who is wound like a vine around his upright figure, and I was alienated by that. It is alienating if you just see it as Freud's celebration of his power to charm younger women into taking their clothes off to be painted and also to get into bed - and undoubtedly he does have that power. But maybe it isn't just about that. There is some thing about the painter's uncertain stance and the woman's importunate sensuality that may give some of the energy of the work back to her.\n\nThis picture sent me back to look at Painter and Model 1986, in which a clothed artist stands in a room with a naked male model. His physicality, the flaccid weight of his penis and the rosy tone of his balls next to the whiteness of his thigh, seem to be what her gaze is directed at and what he is there to provide for her. There is often something coldly objectifying about Freud's work, but it would be absurd to pretend this chilly viewpoint is only directed at women.\n\nTracey Emin, artist\n\nIt definitely isn't me."
