        "text": "Lucian Freud, “known chiefly for his thickly impastoed portrait and figure paintings,…was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time. His works are noted for their psychological penetration, and for their often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model” ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian_Freud)\n\nAfter studying his work we were challenged to create a portrait alluding to his style and approach to painting a figure. My daughter in her prom dress with her piercing gaze was a perfect subject for me."
