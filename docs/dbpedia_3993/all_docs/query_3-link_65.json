        "text": "Research point 1\n\nDo some research into artists’ self-portraits. Some artists – most notably Rembrandt and van Gogh – painted numerous self-portraits, but there are plenty of other examples. Choose five or six self-portraits that particularly appeal to you. Try and choose examples that cover a broad time span and a range of painting techniques. Look carefully at these and make notes in your learning log. For example, does the artist portray himself or herself as an artist? What is the purpose of the self-portrait? What impression is the artist trying to convey? What impression is actually conveyed? If possible, compare your chosen self-portraits with portraits of the same sitter by other artists. What does this comparison tell you?\n\nI chose not to go so far back in time as Rembrandt with this research, as I have already looked at several aspects of Dutch still life and genre painting earlier in the course. I will start at Vincent van Gogh and look closer at more modern artists instead.\n\nVincent van Gogh (1853-1890)\n\nVincent van Gogh possibly painted so many self- portraits simply because he had difficulties finding a model willing to sit for him. This is only speculation from the image that I have of the painter from various biographies, documentaries and recently the animated movie “Loving Vincent” (2017) that he was a misunderstood and lonely man.\n\nI particularly like this “Self portrait with bandaged ear” from 1889:\n\nIt is a very classical portrait composition, but then the surprising bandaged ear and the sad story behind that are painted with curious honesty. The typical and so special Van Gogh brushstrokes are clearly visible. Between the thick coat, the furry cap and the background, the painting expresses so many different textures. I like that a canvas is visible behind the figure- Van Gogh is portraying himself as an artist here, which I find gives hope- he can find a way to channel the pain that led him to cut off an ear into painting.\n\n(Image from: Theartstoryorg. 2018.

Available from: http://www.theartstory.org/artist-van-gogh-vincent.htm)\n\nEgon Schiele (1890-1918)\n\nI am fascinated by Egon Schiele’s expressive figure paintings and drawings, and especially by his ruthless self-portraits. This “seated male nude (Selfportrait) is just so strong it is disturbing- the contorted pose, the burning red eyes and nipples, the vulnerable nudity and then the missing feet- altogether these covey a feeling of extreme anguish and discomfort, and vulnerability . There is such a strong sense of loss of direction with no feet on the ground and no other reference in the background, just a white canvas. Egon Schiele was only 20 years old when he painted this!\n\n(Image from: Leopoldmuseumorg. 2018. Leopoldmuseumorg. [Online]. [4 February 2018]. Available from: http://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/leopoldcollection/masterpieces/35)\n\nEgon Schiele only lived til he was 28 years old, but he created an incredible amount of works (over three hundred oil paintings and several thousand works on paper), among them a huge amount of self portraits. I keep discovering new fascinating ones I haven’t seen before. The skin tones range from greens and yellows to pinks often with colour accents on the eyes, nipples and genitals. The hands dominate many works, tense, gnarled, contorted like the whole figures too. His self portraits are often openly sexual, sometimes he paints himself masturbating.\n\nOne of my favourites of Egon Schiele’s self portraits is this dishevelled young and lost figure:\n\nHis gaze and the tension of the pose are so intense they seem electrical! I love the clear but unexpected composition, the crooked lines , the subtle but bold colour patches and the hand left to the imagination. I think here he looks so young and although tortured or in anguish, there is also strength and determination in his gaze and although it is a nude, it is not necessarily sexual. It is interesting how the missing hand becomes a dominant element in my imagination.\n\n(Image from : Metmuseumorg. 2018. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, ie The Met Museum. [Online].

Available from: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/483438)\n\nFrida Kahlo (1907-1954)\n\nAnother artist whose many self- portraits have a strong impact on me is Frida Kahlo. Her paintings are whole stories of her life and dreams and fantasies. I have a really hard time choosing only one painting , so I will keep three that I mention here, all mixing reality and imagination, transporting us into a dreamworld.\n\nThis painting , “The wounded deer” shows a deer pierced by arrows with Frida’s face:\n\nFrida suffered immense pain after a bus accident, and had several operations to alleviate the pain, that were mostly unsuccessful. She also suffered from her tumultous relationship with her twice husband artist Diego Rivera.I like this combination of portrait and animal, how Frida still holds her head strong with the immense crown, despite the injuries to both her graceful body and her heart.\n\nI believe even if you don’t know the personal story behind this painting- this feeling of a heart ripped open and roots growing over and in her is something you can relate to. I am fascinated by the ecclectic, bright Mexican colours in many of Frida’s paintings, but note that I have chosen two paintings with rather subdued earth colours here, except for the red blood on the deer and the orange dress here.\n\nThis painting is called “The two Fridas” and I include it because it speaks to me personally- very often I feel like two different sides of my personality want completely different lives and I even live on two different continents:\n\nHere the traditional Frida, with her heart ripped open, holds the hand of the modern Frida, heart visible but intact.\n\nWhen I look at Egon Schiele’s work, I am mesmerized by the way he expresses the figures. Frida Kahlo’s works in this rather naive Mexican folkstyle touch me in a different way. It is not so much the way the painting is composed or constructed that I admire, but the whole story that is told with it. I want my own paintings to tell stories and I want to allow myself to venture into fantasy worlds.\n\n(Images from: Fridakahloorg. 2018. Fridakahloorg. [Online]. [4 February 2018]. Available from: https://www.fridakahlo.org)\n\nLucien Freud (1922-2011)\n\nIn many of his self portraits, Lucian Freud painted a realistic close up of his face , with an expression showing the strain or concentration of looking intently while painting. I found this “Self portrait with two children” from 1965 really special. The angle with a very low viewpoint of himself towering in the foreground, the round lamps in the ceiling and the two small children in the background already tell a whole story of connection/ disconnection and different ways of looking. Lucian Freud’s expression is rather cold or anguished and it feels disturbing how he is towering so huge above the tiny children.\n\nI love the reduced colour palette with still so much precision and detail and the genius of the skill with which this is painted. The detail of the face and the light colours of the hand let them stand out and guide the gaze from the hand to face and back again to the children.\n\n(Image from Wikiartorg. 2018. Wwwwikiartorg. [Online]. [4 February 2018]. Available from: https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucian-freud/reflection-with-two-children-self-portrait-1965)\n\nYayoi Kusama (b. 1929)\n\nRecently, I had the opportunity to visit an installation by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama at the Triennal in Melbourne, Australia- a whole room covered in flower stickers. Yayoi Kusama is most famous for her installations involving polka dots or polka dots on naked people in different settings.\n\nI was happy to discover that she also has created colourful, playful series of self portraits – also with dots of course.\n\n“Self-Portrait 2008, is a work of brights and darks whose eyes are like mesmerising mazes in a portrait that demonstrates the construction of identity, pointing towards the simultaneous workings, in the making of a self, of notions of individual and aggregate.”"
