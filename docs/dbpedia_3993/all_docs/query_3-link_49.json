        "text": "LONDON — In 1993, the British painter Lucian Freud, who had just turned 70, took on one of the boldest projects of his career: producing a full-length portrait of himself in his birthday suit. He stood naked and painted in the top-floor London studio where he had spent so many of his waking hours.\n\n“Painter Working, Reflection,” is now considered by critics and art historians to be his greatest self-portrait. It shows him standing in unlaced boots , facing the viewer and brandishing his palette knife the way an aging warrior would a dagger.\n\n“I felt very uneasy doing it,” he told an interviewer just before the painting was unveiled. “Seldom got so fed up with a model. But I thought, after putting so many other people through it, I ought to subject myself to the same treatment.”\n\nThe portrait was a highlight of the Freud exhibition that opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in December of that year. And it is sure to be a highlight of “Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits,” which will be at London’s Royal Academy of Arts (Oct. 27 through Jan. 26), before opening at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston on March 1.\n\nThe exhibition brings together more than 50 Freud self-portraits — paintings, drawings and etchings — from public and private collections, some of which have not been seen in public for years. It is loosely chronological and organized in six sections.\n\nThe show was first proposed to the Royal Academy by Mr. Freud’s longtime studio assistant (and frequent portrait subject) David Dawson , who had discussed the idea of such an exhibition with Freud on several occasions. The artist died in July 2011 without seeing the result, and no such exhibition had been attempted until now.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
