        "text": "Before the invention of photography artists had no other option when making portraits but to work directly from another human being. This being so, a portrait was a study of mass in spacetime. A sitter would have to 'sit', i. e. would have to engage in close contact and collaboration with an artist. In fact, because as a process it took so long, sometimes substitute sitters were employed or models that sat in for kings and queens because important people were always busy. This person of high status, would then re-appear at opportune moments to have their features recorded in more detail.\n\nHowever since the invention of photography, many portraits have been made by copying photographs and these are no longer studies of mass in space and time, they are about the transfer of a flat image recorded in an instant, to another surface, using much slower methods. The grid is often used to trap or capture one image and is then used to transfer it to another grid, thus ensuring that nothing has moved out of place during the transfer.\n\nThe older method was about confronting reality and re-creating it, so that as someone looked at a portrait something of the struggle to comprehend existence was revealed, the copying of photographs simply reveals the ability to invest time in a reproduction process. It is therefore about the personal interest of the copyist and little about a confrontation with another being.\n\nThe National Gallery is hosting the exhibition 'Lucian Freud: New Perspectives' at the moment and it is on until the 22nd of January, if any of you are interested in portraiture, this is a must see exhibition. When Freud had no one else to paint he would use himself as the model and that of course involves looking into a mirror. The image that opens this post being a good example of how you can surprise yourself when catching a view of your image in a mirror leaning against a wall. This is Freud's attempt to escape the trap of the mirror/window, instead of looking out to a passive view, the mirror is made more active, it looks back and in turn Freud appears to activate the mirror through some sort of extramission vision.\n\nLucien Freud: Detail\n\nIt is useful to look at a detail of Freud's painting. Look at how everything is slightly off balance. The mouth tilts to the left, the chin juts out and bends very slightly off the horizontal, patches of paint find their way over an envisioned mass, you can feel his solid grasp of form as his paintbrush lays down each mark, he is in effect constructing this head as a mass or lumpen thing, even though it is a solid that is always slightly moving. In doing this he re-created an experience and for myself as an observer I have to take a much slower time to read his marks, time that is divided up by his planar aware paint patches.\n\nThis type of approach begins with a grasp of the head's mass.\n\nLucien Freud: Etching\n\nIt is easier to see how Freud worked if you look at one of his etchings. The process of etching means he had to clarify his marks and as you can see from the image above he feels for the mass of the head by using marks that make changes in response to planar direction. This is what makes us so certain that this individual was drawn from life and not copied from a photograph. A photograph is flat and there is no mass to grasp. These planes or surface directions are though never quite still, they overlap and interpenetrate, because no matter how still the sitter, they will always be in movement because the artist is himself having to look and it is in the looking that movement is generated. As you look to one side of the nose your gaze becomes active in assessing the planar movements towards an eye, but in order to assess these you need to drop your gaze down towards the cheek. These constantly roaming eye movements allow you to eventually stitch together a solid idea of the head. Within this complexity of looking is something we call 'accuracy' or 'likeness' and an ability to also catch this at the same time as the experience of the looking, is what makes Freud such as powerful painter.\n\nSo how can someone starting off on the journey to become a portrait painter begin the process of learning the skills of looking at a head and a grasp of the mass/space complexity of experiencing someone over a long time period? There are methods that can help wean you off photographs and make you more aware of how to record the process of looking at solid objects but these usually demand of a would be portrait painter time spent investing in the skills of three dimensional construction.\n\nArtist's studios used to always have classical busts from which apprentices were meant to begin developing their drawing skills. The issue about drawing from sculpture is that the sculptor has already simplified the form for you. This can be a useful experience, because it helps the drawer to 'see' how forms can be drawn, the sculpture in effect clarifies the complexity of life. However classical busts are expensive and so many artists rely on purpose made 'planar heads'.\n\nYou can buy them ready made, and some have even been designed by other artists specifically for the purpose of helping artists become more aware of the planes that underpin a three dimensional grasp of the head's mass.\n\nA planar head\n\nAn Asaro Head\n\nThe Asaro planar head was developed by the artist John Asaro, the left side of the model head is a simpler variant of the right side, this allows you to explore how a growing complexity can carry different levels of emotional effects.\n\nMost students will begin by simply using cardboard to make a model. If you need a support to construct one over, you can buy cheap polystyrene display heads for wigs from Amazon for £1.99 and then using ideas of planar simplification you can construct your own heads to work from.\n\nFrom Burne Hogarth: Drawing the human head\n\nThe drawings made from planar heads are though very crude and the next step is to practice drawing from life, this may be from your own head seen in a mirror or much more usefully from other people prepared to sit for you. But try and keep in mind the understanding of planes that you now have. The drawing above is from Burne Hogarth's classical 'how to' drawing book, and you can see the influence of the planar thinking. Hogarth's book is a typical example of teaching constructive drawing where you start by creating simple shapes or abstractions to represent elements of the subject you are drawing.\n\nIt might seem a long way from a master such as Freud and a 'how to' drawing book but if you place two images side by side you can see their relationship.\n\nTwo approaches to drawing mass\n\nThe difference is that Freud's drawing is much subtler, he relies on looking and feeling for the form more than using a planar formula to establish the solidity of the head. But remember the drawing on the right is for students. The nose and mouth feel stuck on rather than being understood as gradual changes in surface direction, but I hope you can see how working in this way you begin with a firm grasp of the mass and solidity of the head. In technical terms this is the constructional method. The constructional method allows you to think in terms of shapes, tone and line; this degree of abstraction helps you overcome your brain’s pre-conceptions about what things look like. For instance when drawing a leg that is very foreshortened it is very hard to get it to look right, but if reduced to simple forms it becomes much easier. You can also get things in the right place before you add detail. This is a vital lesson, likeness in a portrait often comes at the very end not at the beginning. You can also get a clear idea of the most important areas of light and dark on the face. Instead of infinite gradients of tone, you have created planes that are facing or not facing the light source. This means you can quickly establish the key elements around which you will build a portrait and more importantly in your own mind you can picture the head's physical reality as a graspable entity and not the slippery, hard to understand flat thing that emerges from a photograph.\n\nIf however as a student you still feel that you want to work from photographs, my advice is to convert the photograph into a solid object and to then begin trying to make a portrait.\n\nA very simple way is to begin folding the photograph. Within a few seconds you have a more three dimensional object that can even be put on a shelf."
