        "text": "The postwar figuration had a particular development as the majority of artists devoted themselves to abstraction as a way to avoid presenting the human figure after the Holocaust. Nevertheless, some artists remained loyal to the traditional genre of portraiture by adding layers of personal experience and observing the female and male bodies differently.\n\nOne of the most prolific representatives of postwar figurative art is Lucian Freud. The grandson of the leading 20th-century scientist, the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, arrived with his family from Nazi Germany to London in 1933. During the war years, he attended Goldsmiths College, but also served in the British Merchant Navy.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Freud gained international fame, worked as a tutor, and his style was characterized by an impeccable observation of his subjects whether those were people, animals, or even plants. The artist belonged to a loose group of individual artists named the School of London that was active during the boom years of abstract painting and in contrast to abstract expressionism. Besides Freud, among the active proponents in the group were Ronald Brooks Kitaj, Francis Bacon, Leon Kossoff, Frank Auerbach, Michael Andrews, Reginald Gray, and few others.\n\nCurrently on view at Tate Liverpool is a grand scale retrospective of Lucian Freud portraits and the first in the North West in over thirty years. Titled Lucian Freud: Real Lives. Through a selection of his best-known paintings and etchings as well as photographs, this exhibition explores all the aspects of his lasting practice to highlight his technical virtuosity and justify Freud’s reputation as a master of modern portraiture.\n\nRevisiting Freud’s Domains\n\nBy closely observing Freud’s astonishing paintings, we can understand how important different interactions with people were for him, despite the fact this artist was a very private person. Throughout a prolific career spanning more than six decades, Freud painted remarkable explorations of the human form, mostly of friends and family, and psychological states while being saluted for an almost discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model.\n\nHis early works were produced under the great influence of Surrealism, but by the early 1950s, his alienated paintings moved to realism. These works were characterized by thick impasto, mostly somber, and often set in almost eerie interiors and urban landscapes. Freud was known for working from life studies and for being very strict with his models. The artist once famously said:\n\nMy work is purely autobiographical. It is about myself and my surroundings... I work from the people that interest me... I use the people to invent my pictures with, and I can work more freely when they are there.\n\nThe Works\n\nAs already mentioned, the exhibition brings together some of his most iconic works, including portraits of sitters such as performance artist Leigh Bowery, his first wife Kitty Garman, his friend, and long-time studio assistant, the painter David Dawson, and his mother, Lucie Freud. These representations of people illuminate either their vulnerability while being nude or their humanity. For this occasion, all of the Freud works held within the Tate collection are united, including the paintings Girl with a Kitten (1947) and Girl with a White Dog (1950–1).\n\nReal Lives also brings outstanding examples of the artist’s etchings starting from his early experiments of the 1940s to a number of the increasingly large and complex compositions the artist made after rediscovering the medium in the early 1980s. Freud applied a non-traditional, painterly approach to printmaking by using the etching plate like a canvas.\n\nBesides Freud’s works, the exhibition also includes a selection of photographs that cast a new light on his career and private life and reveal the influx of these two elements. In the 1950s, Cecil Beaton captured Freud at the start of his career and this image is in sharp contrast to the ones taken by Bruce Bernard and David Dawson from the early 1990s to 2010 that show the artist in the studio.\n\nLucian Freud Portraits at Tate Liverpool\n\nAfter all being said, the impression is that the current show curated by Laura Bruni, Assistant Curator Tate Liverpool appoints the innovation of one of Britain’s great realist painters by underlining not only his craftsmanship in using any medium but also a continuity in exploiting the genre any way he could.\n\nLucian Freud: Real Lives will be on view at Tate Liverpool until 22 January 2022."
