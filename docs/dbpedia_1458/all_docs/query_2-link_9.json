        "text": "Chelsea Kline is no stranger to struggle, whether as a poor teenage mother or a nontraditional college student. But this time, she appears to have gotten a lucky break.\n\nThe political newcomer went from challenging a 27-year incumbent and recent Senate president to having a clear shot at the state Senate seat formerly held by Stan Rosenberg, D-Amherst.\n\nBut Kline, 40, of Northampton, said she is not counting on gliding into the seat.\n\n\"I will take nothing for granted,\" Kline said in an interview Friday. \"I'm planning on earning every vote and running a very strong campaign.\"\n\nRosenberg resigned from the Senate, effective Friday, after the Senate Ethics Committee released a damning report that found Rosenberg allowed his husband Bryon Hefner to meddle in his Senate business and did not prevent Hefner from engaging in sexually inappropriate behavior toward people involved with the Senate.\n\nThe report was released Wednesday, one day after the deadline for candidates to file signatures with city and town clerks to run for office in 2018. Kline, a Democrat, was the only one who filed to challenge Rosenberg.\n\nKline announced her campaign in March, after Rosenberg stepped down from the presidency amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault by Hefner. A criminal case against Hefner is ongoing.\n\nNorthampton Mayor David Narkewicz asked state officials for a two-week extension to allow additional candidates to file nomination papers. But the signature deadline is written into state law, so it would take special legislation to change it.\n\nKline said she does not expect lawmakers to extend the deadline, in which case the only way to challenge her would be to mount a write-in campaign. But she said, \"If anyone is interested in running, jump in, the water is fine. I'll be running a very strong campaign.\"\n\nKline is a political neophyte, having never held elected office. She is an appointed commissioner on the Hampshire-Franklin Commission on the Status of Women and Girls, which was established about a year ago.\n\nIn an interview, Kline stressed her background as an activist for social justice and reproductive rights. \"I'm someone who's been looking out for marginalized people and vulnerable people for a long time now,\" Kline said.\n\nKline was living outside of Washington when she had a child at 19 years old. At the time, she was working as a nanny, attending community college and relying on food stamps.\n\n\"It was not easy to make a living and put food on the table,\" she said.\n\nKline moved to Northampton in 2001 to help her mother, who had cancer, get health care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nShe was accepted into the Ada Comstock Scholars Program at Smith College, which helps women of nontraditional college age complete their bachelor's degree with flexible scheduling, academic advising and other assistance. Kline attended Greenfield Community College, then graduated from Smith College.\n\nKline later got a master's degree from Harvard Divinity School, with a focus on women, religion, gender and sexuality. According to her biography, she has been active in numerous organizations that focus on women's health, including teen parent mentorship, the Feminist Majority, La Leche League and others.\n\nShe has worked at Bay Path University since 2012, where she directs multiple programs geared toward helping adult women attend college.\n\n\"Because I'm somebody who has struggled, I have lot of compassion for those struggling now,\" Kline said.\n\nKline said she was inspired to run for office because she wants to \"rebuild the social safety net\" and strengthen Western Massachusetts. Her platform includes fighting for a $15 minimum wage, advocating for more transportation options in Western Massachusetts, fully funding public schools, pushing for single payer health care and taking a \"compassionate approach\" to opioid addiction.\n\n\"It's all about strengthening Western Mass. and demanding more from Beacon Hill,\" Kline said.\n\nShe just organized her campaign committee in March, so she has not yet filed a campaign finance report.\n\nThe 2018 election comes amid a national culture shift, in which women are becoming increasingly vocal about problems of sexual harassment in the workplace. Kline, who is on the board of directors of the Women's Fund of Western Massachusetts, said she believes it is important for women to take leadership roles.\n\n\"When a young parent or single parent looks at government, they should be able to see someone there and know that person speaks for them, understands where they're coming from,\" Kline said.\n\nShe said the need for female representation is not only about gender, but about \"understanding from the inside out what your constituents are experiencing and really care about.\"\n\nKline is married to her husband Greg and has three children."
