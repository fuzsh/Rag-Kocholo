As a result, many business districts were buzzing with people while social distancing and supporting local businesses. To create the tactical placemaking projects there were several key sources of funding to implement these projects including funding from funding directly from municipalities, the Barr Foundation, the Solomon Foundation, MassDOT, MassDev, and crowdfunding. This winter was a great time to pause, reflect, evaluate, and improve on the placemaking and tactical urbanism projects implemented in 2020.\n\nMONDAY, DECEMBER 14TH, 2020 | WATCH\n\nThe City of Boston launched a process to update the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO) that A Better City has been very engaged in through an Efficient and Resilient Buildings Policy Working Group made up of A Better City and Green Ribbon Commission Commercial Real Estate Working Group members. The City is interested in engaging all covered building owners, managers, tenants, and other parties as part of this process.\n\nIn the City's 2019 Climate Action Plan Update they committed to developing a building emissions performance standard. A building emissions performance standard sets carbon targets for existing buildings that decrease over time (You can check out the recording from the public presentation on the standard here).\n\nThursday, November 5th, 2020 | SLIDES | WATCH\n\nIn light of current market realities, proactive management of energy spending is a key lever for organizations to reduce costs and limit budget uncertainty.

You can view the presentation here and read the entire recap here.\n\nOn February 12, A Better City hosted a meeting about the findings from the recently released Carbon Free Boston report, and the next steps the City is planning to build on these findings. The Boston Green Ribbon Commission was asked by Mayor Marty Walsh to undertake this report. They selected the Institute for Sustainable Energy at Boston University to conduct the deep research, modeling, and analysis of the buildings, electric power, transportation, and waste sectors to understand their greenhouse gas emission contributions and potential pathways to reach the City’s carbon neutrality goal by 2050. Read the event recap here and view the slides here.\n\nOn November 14th, A Better City welcomed global transit experts to discuss lessons learned in reimagining and rebuilding regional rail systems as part of the Partners in Public Dialogue series at the Old South Meeting House. Read the entire event recap here and review the slides here.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 17, a full house of commercial facility owners and managers, and energy storage experts and vendors joined A Better City, Boston Green Ribbon Commission, and Sustainable Buildings Initiative members and partners at Wilmer Hale for a panel event and the launch of A Better City's new report, Harnessing the Power of Energy Storage in Boston's Commercial Buildings.\n\nAttendees heard from expert speakers on two panels. The first panel explored current Massachusetts policies, incentives, and the economics for energy storage systems in Boston.\n\nPanelists\n\nJamie Dickerson, Policy Analyst at NECEC (moderator)\n\nKavita Ravi, Director of Emerging Markets, MassCEC\n\nJason Burwen, Vice President, Policy, Energy Storage Association\n\nTodd Olinsky-Paul, Project Director, Clean Energy Group\n\nThe second panel highlighted examples of cutting-edge projects recently implemented in the Boston area that utilize financing models ranging from direct ownership to shared savings agreements.\n\nPanelists\n\nMike Kelinberg, Head of Section-Distributed Energy Resources/Storage, DNV GL (moderator)\n\nSteve Tuleja, President, Alternative Power Source Inc.\n\nBob Gohn, Director, Product Management, NEC Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\nDave Herbert, Director, EnerNOC Inc., an Enel Group Company\n\nPanelists shared key storage use cases for commercial buildings, including demand management, grid services, and emergency power for resiliency. They underscored that energy storage provides commercial building owners with flexibility to deliver power where and when it is needed at a given time. One of the key takeaways from the discussions is that energy storage has reached a tipping point where many commercial building owners in Boston can realize cost effective paybacks on installations by taking advantage of current incentives and available technologies. Increased deployment of energy storage, particularly when paired with renewable energy, will also help the City of Boston reach its ambitious carbon reduction goals.\n\nEVENT MATERIALS\n\nPanel Summary\n\nEvent Presentation\n\nA Better City’s Sustainable Buildings Initiative and the Green Ribbon Commission’s Commercial Real Estate Working Group, managed by A Better City, hosted a panel discussion and building tour exploring the role of net zero energy and net zero emissions buildings in meeting the mayor’s commitment to make Boston carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nFacilitator\n\nJohn Dalzell, Senior Architect, Boston Planning and Development Agency\n\nPanelists\n\nSeth Federspiel, a Net Zero Energy Planner, City of Cambridge\n\nJill Kaehler, a Project Leader and Lead Designer, Behnisch Architekten\n\nJacob Knowles, Director of Sustainable Design, BR+A Consulting Engineers\n\nOpening and Closing Remarks\n\nBob Biggio, Senior Vice President for Facilities and Support Services, Boston Medical Center\n\nAmy Longsworth, Director, Boston Green Ribbon Commission\n\nevent materials\n\nPanel Summary\n\nEvent Presentations\n\nA Better City is managing the development of conceptual design proposal for retrofitting Phillips Square (Chinatown). For these efforts, we partnered with the Boston Transportation Department and Boston Planning and Design Agency, and hired Stantec to provide design consulting services. In March and May, the project team convened two design charrettes with the local community, including members of the project’s advisory group, made up of leaders from Chinatown-based community organizations. The City of Boston plans to implement a semi-permanent version of the finalized conceptual design proposal in summer of 2017. This pilot will help us test the conceptual urban design this summer and evaluate its success before committing to a permanent transformation of the site. The next design charrette will take place the second week of June 2017.\n\nEVENT MATERIALS\n\nPhotos\n\nMassachusetts has a wealth of knowledge in the placemaking work, but it is often undermined by the lack of communication and collaboration among those regulating, financing, and implementing placemaking projects. The Routes to Placemaking Workshop aimed to bridge these gaps by convening experts and providing a temporary platform for peer-to-peer learning. Consisting of a networking session, short presentations, and breakout discussions, the Routes to Placemaking Workshop focused on unpacking a selection of placemaking strategies typically employed to improve community spaces.\n\nEVENT MATERIALS\n\nWorkshop Agenda\n\nWorkshop Summary\n\nThis event reviewed the A Better City-facilitated Joint Solar Power Purchase Agreement--the largest renewable-energy project ever to be constructed in the U.S. through an alliance of diverse buyers\n\nFacilitators\n\nGary Farha, President & CEO, CustomerFirst Renewables\n\nMiriam Posner, Director of Energy & Environmental Policy, A Better City\n\nPanelists\n\nKen Alston, Special Advisor to the Secretary for Finance, U.S. Department of Energy\n\nEmil Avram, Director of Business Development, Dominion Resources\n\nBob Biggio, Vice President Facilities & Support Services, Boston Medical Center\n\nTerence de Pentheny O'Kelly, Engagement Manager, CustomerFirst Renewables\n\nJoe Higgins, Director of Infrastructure Business Operations, MIT\n\nAmy Longsworth, Director, Boston Green Ribbon Commission\n\nPam Messenger, General Manager, Friends of Post Office Square\n\nFrank O'Sullivan, Director of Research, MIT Energy Initiative\n\nRemarks\n\nAlan Leventhal, Chairman & CEO, Beacon Capital Partners\n\nTony Sharon, Deputy Executive Vice President, MIT\n\nMaria Zuber, Vice President for Research, MIT\n\nPlacemaking is a people-centered approach to the planning and design of public space.
