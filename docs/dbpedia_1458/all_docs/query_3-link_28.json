        "text": "We pause to note with sadness the passing of my old friend Stanley Rosenberg.\n\nA man both of his time and ahead of his time, Stanley combined the impassioned delivery and imagination of a performer with the deep understanding required of a healer. Raised in the grit of Philadelphia (giving him a groundedness he never lost), he served the Danish community for many years with refined bodywork and sensitive teaching. Thank you for your teachings, Stanley – you will be missed.\n\nTom Myers, from Tokyo, Feb 2, 2023\n\nEditor’s note: Here is an excellent talk on osteopathy by Dr Stanley Rosenberg:"
