        "text": "BOSTON (AP) - The Latest on sexual misconduct allegations surrounding state Senate President Stan Rosenberg’s husband. (all times local):\n\n9:25 p.m.\n\nThe Massachusetts Senate has voted to have the Senate Ethics Committee investigate sexual misconduct allegations surrounding the husband of former Senate President Stan Rosenberg.\n\nThe Senate Monday night also voted to authorize the committee to hire a special investigator to conduct the probe.\n\nThe Senate elected Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harriette Chandler to serve as acting Senate president during the investigation.\n\nRosenberg announced earlier Monday he would take a leave of absence from his responsibilities as Senate president. He has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported last week several men had accused the Amherst Democrat’s husband, Bryon Hefner, of sexual assault or harassment.\n\nThe investigation will focus on whether Rosenberg knew about Hefner’s alleged behavior, or if Hefner had any clout when it came to matters before the chamber.\n\n___\n\n8:05 p.m.\n\nMassachusetts Senate Majority Leader Harriette Chandler has been elected acting Senate president during an upcoming investigation into sexual misconduct allegations surrounding the husband of fellow Sen. Stan Rosenberg.\n\nThe announcement came late Monday after a nearly eight-hour Democratic caucus held behind closed doors at the Statehouse.\n\nRosenberg announced earlier Monday he would take a leave of absence from his responsibilities as Senate president during the investigation. He has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported last week several men had accused the Amherst Democrat’s husband, Bryon Hefner, of sexual assault or harassment.\n\nRosenberg says Hefner is seeking professional help.\n\nThe Senate is expected to appoint an independent investigator whose focus likely would be on whether Rosenberg knew about Hefner’s behavior or if Hefner had any clout when it came to matters before the Senate.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nMajority Leader Harriette Chandler says she expects to serve as acting Massachusetts Senate President during an upcoming investigation into sexual misconduct allegations surrounding the husband of Sen. Stan Rosenberg.\n\nThat announcement came late Monday after a nearly eight-hour Democratic caucus held behind closed doors at the Statehouse.\n\nRosenberg announced earlier Monday he would take a leave of absence from his responsibilities as Senate President during the investigation. He has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported last week that several men had accused the Amherst Democrat’s husband, Bryon Hefner, of sexual assault or harassment.\n\nThe Senate is expected to appoint an independent investigator whose focus likely would be on whether Rosenberg knew about Hefner’s alleged behavior, or if Hefner had any clout when it came to matters before the Senate.\n\n___\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nTwo of the state’s top law enforcement officials say they’re prepared to investigate sexual misconduct allegations against the husband of Democratic Massachusetts Senate President Stan Rosenberg.\n\nAttorney General Maura Healey and Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley, both Democrats, are asking anyone with information about the allegations to contact either of their offices.\n\nThe two said in a written statement Monday that they are committed to providing every survivor of sexual assault with what they called “a safe, respectful, victim-centered environment.”\n\nEarlier Monday, Rosenberg, a Democrat, agreed to step aside as leader of the chamber during an investigation into the allegations surrounding his husband, Bryon Hefner.\n\nSeveral men told The Boston Globe that Hefner sexually assaulted or harassed them.\n\n___\n\n11:40 a.m.\n\nA spokesman says Massachusetts Senate President Stan Rosenberg has agreed to step aside as leader of the chamber during an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations surrounding his husband, Bryon Hefner.\n\nRosenberg had previously planned to remain on as Senate President but recuse himself from all matters related to the investigation. But on Monday he informed colleagues just prior to a Democratic caucus that he would not serve as president during the probe, though he will remain in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate is likely to vote Monday to authorize the appointment of an independent investigator whose focus likely would be on whether Rosenberg knew about Bryon Hefner’s alleged behavior, or if Hefner had any clout when it came to Senate matters.\n\nRosenberg has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n____\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nThe Massachusetts Senate plans a special session to discuss sexual misconduct allegations lodged against the husband of Democratic Senate President Stan Rosenberg.\n\nThe Senate is likely to vote Monday to authorize the appointment of an independent investigator whose focus likely would be on whether Rosenberg knew about Bryon Hefner’s alleged behavior, or if Hefner had any clout when it came to Senate matters.\n\nRosenberg has not been accused of wrongdoing. He expressed shock over the allegations and maintained Hefner exerted no influence on the Senate.\n\nRosenberg has promised to recuse himself from any matters related to the investigation but otherwise will continue to preside over the Senate.\n\nSeveral men told The Boston Globe that Hefner sexually assaulted or harassed them.\n\nRosenberg said Hefner will soon enter treatment for alcohol dependency."
