        "text": "Stanley Jay Rosenberg, M.D. of Newton, Massachusetts, passed away peacefully at home on September 9, 2020. As a physician, he was admired by patients and colleagues for his compassion and dedication to teaching. As a father and grandfather, he was adored for his complete and unselfish love, support, advice, and the humor with which he approached every situation. As a husband, he was a loving companion, hiking partner, and best friend for over 59 years.\n\nStan was born on July 13, 1937 to Harold and Marion Rosenberg of Boston, MA. He was raised in Dorchester and West Roxbury, MA and attended Boston Latin School, graduating in 1956. Stan prepared for a career in medicine by studying for a B.S. in Chemistry and Biology at Tufts University, graduating Magna Cum Laude in 1960. During his freshman year he met Maxine Lavine, who would later be his wife for over 59 years. He then attended the Yale University School of Medicine. Maxine joined him in New Haven after their marriage in 1961, where they celebrated the birth of their daughter Phylis and then their son Harold. Stan graduated M.D., Cum Laude, from Yale University School of Medicine in 1964. Their son Daniel was born while Stan was in the Public Health Service in Albany, NY in 1967.\n\nStan’s professional life was marked by his care and compassion for his patients, his dedication to teaching and mentoring generations of gastroenterology fellows, and a passion for improving the quality of care for patients. After graduating from Yale, Stan did residencies at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, served in the US Public Health Service, and completed his fellowship in the gastroenterology department of the Boston University School of Medicine. In 1971 he entered private practice in gastroenterology. In 1989, Stan joined the full-time faculty of the Beth Israel Hospital, where he remained until his retirement in 2015. Throughout his career he maintained a strong affiliation and involvement with teaching programs at Beth Israel Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. From 1971 until his retirement he held appointments as an Instructor, and then Assistant Professor of Medicine, at the Harvard Medical School. His clinical activities were primarily in general gastroenterology, with special interest in esophageal disorders and endoscopy. He was the Director of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy at the Beth Israel from 1985 through 1996 and was the acting Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology from 1994 through 1996. He also served as the Director of Quality Assurance and GI Endoscopy Training Director. Stan was the co-author of a number of published papers and studies, including as the primary author of a paper in the highly respected journal Nature. Even after his formal retirement he continued to practice, working with the Maven project to bring his expertise to under served communities.\n\nStan’s personal interests were driven by his family, an enjoyment of the outdoors, and a love of music. Family hiking trips to the White Mountains in New Hampshire led to a lifelong love of hiking and the outdoors. Stan and Maxine traveled the world, hiking in mountains all over North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. He loved sharing these experiences with old friends and those he met along the way. As an adult, he fulfilled his ambition to learn the oboe, and in the process became passionate about the mission of the All Newton Music School to bring musical instruction and experiences to the community. He volunteered at the school for many years and served as the President of the Board of Directors from 1984 to 1987.\n\nStan was always an interested listener, a trusted advisor, a steadying presence, and a beloved friend to his children and grandchildren. His caring and humor in difficult situations, his gratitude for the blessings of his life even when dealing with personal setbacks, and his constant care for the well-being of his family and friends have served as an inspiration for all who knew him. He will be deeply missed.\n\nStan is lovingly remembered by his wife, Maxine Lavine Rosenberg; his daughter and son-in-law Phylis and Joseph Crosby; his son Harold Rosenberg and daughter-in-law Melora Goosey; his son and daughter-in-law Daniel and Sheri Rosenberg; his grandchildren: David Brunet, Corine Rosenberg, Raquel Goosey, Joshua Brunet, Jacob Rosenberg, and Ethan Rosenberg; his brother and sister-in-law Lewis and Paula Rosenberg; and his brother and sister-in-law Kenneth and Carol Rosenberg."
