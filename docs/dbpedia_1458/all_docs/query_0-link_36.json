        "text": "You have probably heard that emotional intelligence is important for leadership, and that leadership is important to success in science and research. If true, wouldn't that mean that emotional intelligence is linked to success in science and research? BUT, a quick internet search turns up very few hits on the idea. Over the next several weeks, I'll be sharing insights from reading, watching, and listening about effective leadership in R&D, emotional intelligence in leadership, and links across the ideas. Let's see what connections we find between our emotions, behaviors, and implications for students, workers, and leaders in scientific research and development. Sources could include research (very limited at this point), personal accounts, blogs, case studies, forums, podcasts & interviews, whitepapers, books, and more. The purpose of this exercise is to raise our awareness of key concerns around emotions, interpersonal interactions, and decision-making in the science labs and workplaces and how awareness of ourselves and others can make us better directors of our interactions, decisions, and ultimately, the results of our efforts! This week, we're starting with a piece called \"Do we need emotional intelligence for research?\" in the blog entitled \"Walking in my science shoes\" by CHUA Ngee Kiat, who recently earned his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics in Australia. https://lnkd.in/gqmPH4DB He writes, \"Emotional intelligence isn’t something I find in many scientists. After all, we are not trained to have these skills honed but it doesn’t mean they aren’t important.\" He asks, \"How would emotional intelligence (EI) look like for an average PhD student?\" and gives you some concrete examples of high EI and low EI in interactions with research colleagues and supervisors. He closes with key questions you can ask to test yourself on 5 pillars of emotional intelligence: - Self-awareness - Self-regulation - Motivation - Empathy - Social skills Enjoy the graphic in this post. Stay tuned for more insights over the coming weeks! #emotionalintelligence #leadershipskills #scientificresearch #R&DLeadership #labculture #selfawareness #phd\n\nSemifinals Articles: Entrepreneurial Management Article 1 Organizational studies scrutinize how individuals prepare facilities of organization, practices, and approaches, resulting in social interactions and institutions that influence people. Organizational studies comprise diverse areas that deal with various aspects of organizations. The investigation is establishing organizational transformation. Historical tendencies and ideas are also incorporated in the examination to demonstrate the relationship between the traditional, current, and future organizational structures, practices, and methodologies. Here are some areas of analysis: Social psychology, an area of psychology, merges principles from psychology and sociology to better comprehend human interaction. Sociology studies people's interactions with their social cultures or environments. Anthropology is the study of society with a directive to learn about people and their roles. Organizational culture is a collection of conventions and values an organization's workers hold that distinguishes it from opponents. Organizational ecology discusses the influence of social, economic, and political events on the related success and variety of organizations and the changes that occur over time inside the organization. Organizational Psychology employs psychological theories and concepts to understand the behavior of individuals inside organizations and their work lives. Organizational theory envelops several methods of organizational study. Organizations are social entities of individuals that are together and organized to meet a need or achieve a common objective.

No hard feelings: I've enough experience splitting hairs between excellent candidates from the other side not to take it personally, plus it's really a bit too early for me to be looking. I left with a good impression of the organisation, having been treated with respect throughout, including being offered feedback. I'm not well-practiced in competency-based interviews so I was particularly keen to hear back. One comment in particular stuck out: that I had not been specific enough about my individual contribution, and too often referred to things that 'we' had done, rather than what I had done. Oof. That was an interesting one. Most of my writing and thinking at the moment is academic, where first person writing is tolerated, but definitely not encouraged, so partly it's just a quirk of speech. But also, what I least enjoy about PhD work is how solitary it is. As is the nature of modern work, pretty much everything I am proud of has been a team effort. Chatting with the lovely Lenny, he wondered whether gender affects responses: are women less likely than men to claim their individual achievements? Particularly when, as is common with women, I'd say one of my biggest strengths at work is being the glue. And then there's the whole idea that what you're best at is what you do effortlessly, and therefore struggle to break down: you just do it, you don't really think about how. Anyway, in response to the feedback I have been given, I'll be booking some time with the careers service and my lovely Women in Transport mentor to think about how I can identify my special contribution so that I can be more successful when I apply to similar roles in the future. See - progress already!\n\nCompanies today need staff who can think independently and possess vital soft skills like work ethic, effective communication, teamwork, creativity, empathy, and leadership. These skills pave the way for career and life achievements, and they are irreplaceable by AI. In a time when artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming classrooms and shaping future workplaces, educators must emphasize the value of being human. This unique human aspect is precisely what future employers are seeking. Despite the surge in automated technologies, there's a growing demand for individuals who excel in soft skills—attributes that machines cannot replicate. For example, consider a scenario where a team must navigate through a complex project requiring negotiation, empathy, and creative problem-solving. While AI can manage tasks and analyze data, the human touch understands emotions, leads with compassion, and fosters collaboration that leads to success. The imperative to nurture these skills begins now, ensuring our students are not just prepared for the future workforce but are indispensable to it.\n\nThinking, Fast and Slow is a classic psychology book by Daniel Kahneman that delves into the two modes of human thinking: the fast-intuitive System I and the slow-rational System II. Through vivid examples and experiments, the book explains the cognitive biases and errors that people often make in decision-making and judgement, and suggests ways to improve decision-making and thinking by becoming aware of these biases. It is an important source of inspiration for understanding the human mindset, for improving decision-making skills, and for improving the quality of life. Reading this book was able to provide me with insights that are valuable for decision making and strategic planning. As a student, this book can help you understand and deal with challenges in the business environment and improve your decision-making and analytical skills. 1. Strategic Decision Making: In business, the quality of decisions is critical to the success of a business. By understanding the System 1 and System 2 modes of thinking, you can better identify potential cognitive biases and be more deliberate in making strategic decisions. 2. Marketing: In marketing, understanding consumer behaviour and psychology is crucial. Through the study of this book, you can gain a deeper understanding of how consumers make purchasing decisions so that you can better design marketing strategies. 3. Team Management: As a future business leader, you will need to lead teams and make important decisions. This book provides valuable insights into team decision-making and collective intelligence to help you use your management skills more effectively in a team environment. Thinking, Fast and Slow will not only help you gain a deeper academic understanding of psychology and decision science, but will also provide you with important thinking tools and skills for your future business career.\n\nFascinating Discovery: Predictability in Human Behavior Recent research conducted by Northeastern University has unveiled a remarkable insight: an astounding 93% of human behavior is predictable. This finding is not merely an academic observation; it represents a pivotal understanding in the fields of psychology and behavioral science with profound implications across various aspects of life and work. Why do some individuals lead with boldness while others excel in creating a serene environment? The exploration into human behavior has identified four core behavior types that provide a framework for understanding our actions and interactions: Red Behavior: Characterized by assertiveness and drive, these individuals are often seen leading the charge towards new ventures and challenges. Yellow Behavior: Known for their optimism and enthusiasm, they excel in inspiring and motivating those around them. Green Behavior: With a focus on harmony and support, they play a crucial role in maintaining balance and understanding in groups. Blue Behavior: Detail-oriented and analytical, they provide the deep insights and thorough planning necessary for success. This categorization serves a greater purpose than simple identification; it offers strategic insights for improving conflict resolution, enhancing communication effectiveness, and fostering meaningful relationships. Key Advantages: Mastering conflict resolution techniques. Achieving superior levels of communication. Developing deeper and more significant relationships. By understanding and recognizing these behavior types, individuals can significantly improve their interpersonal skills, leading to more effective leadership and team dynamics. This journey towards understanding human behavior is not just about academic interest; it's a tool for personal and professional development, enabling us to adapt, grow, and lead more effectively. Elevate your understanding. Transform your approach.

When you're looking for personal and professional growth, understanding the mechanics of behavior change is crucial. B.J. Fogg's Behavior Model offers a fascinating lens through which we can examine how behaviors are initiated and sustained. At its core, the model presupposes that three elements must converge for a behavior to occur: *Motivation *Ability, and a *Prompt (or Trigger) But how can we apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios? Whether you're a leader aiming to inspire your team, a professional looking to instill new habits, or a marketer trying to influence consumer behavior, Fogg's model provides actionable insights into the complexities of human behavior. Motivation: Understand what drives people to take action. Is it the desire to gain pleasure or avoid pain? Perhaps social acceptance or the fear of rejection? Ability: Simplify the action. If a behavior is too hard, no amount of motivation will make it habitual. How can we make desired behaviors easier to adopt? Prompt: Identify the right triggers. Without a prompt, the desired behavior is unlikely to occur. What timely cues can lead to the behavior we want to see? By dissecting the elements of the Behavior Model, we gain a deeper understanding of how to effect meaningful change. This insight is invaluable not just in personal development, but also in designing products, services, and environments that encourage positive behaviors. I invite you to dive deeper into B.J. Fogg's Behavior Model and explore how it can be applied to foster growth and change in your personal and professional life."
