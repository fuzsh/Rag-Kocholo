        "text": "Northampton City Council President Ryan O'Donnell had been running for state representative from the 1st Hampshire District -- until Sen. Stan Rosenberg resigned.\n\nO'Donnell said Monday that he will instead pursue a write-in campaign for Rosenberg's state Senate seat. The House seat formerly held by the late Peter Kocot had four people running. The Senate seat has only one candidate.\n\n\"This post is too important to be filled without an election, without democratic discussion and debate,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nRosenberg's resignation has created an unusual dynamic in Massachusetts politics, as numerous politicians and aspiring politicians debate whether to jump into a race after the filing deadline already passed.\n\n\"A lot of different folks are taking a look at this,\" said Springfield political consultant Tony Cignoli. \"They never would have considered it with the incumbent still in the seat.\"\n\nRosenberg resigned Friday in the wake of an ethics report, which found that Rosenberg allowed his husband, who has been accused of sexual misconduct, an inappropriate level of access to Rosenberg's Senate work.\n\nThe ethics report was released one day after the May 1 deadline for candidates to file signatures with city and town clerks to run for the seat. The only candidate to meet that deadline was Democrat Chelsea Kline. Now, the only way for anyone to challenge Kline is to run a write-in campaign.\n\nAsked Friday about the prospect of other candidates running for the seat, Kline said, \"If anyone is interested in running, jump in, the water is fine. I'll be running a very strong campaign.\"\n\nThe Hampshire, Franklin and Worcester District includes Northampton and 23 towns.\n\nNorthampton Mayor David Narkewicz last week suggested extending the signature deadline by two weeks. But that would require special legislation, which legislative leaders did not support.\n\n\"We've never done that in history,\" said Senate President Harriette Chandler, D-Worcester, adding, \"Frankly, there is one person who managed to get their papers filed in time.\"\n\nNarkewicz said Monday he accepts Chandler's decision, after she told him she was worried about setting precedent. For example, former Framingham Rep. Chris Walsh died of cancer May 2, similarly leaving his district with no Democrat on the ballot.\n\nKline was the only one willing to challenge Rosenberg, a 27-year senator and former Senate president. But with a powerful incumbent out of the race and a political newcomer as the only contender, even a write-in campaign holds some appeal.\n\nO'Donnell said he thinks highly of Kline. But as a former director of the government reform advocacy group Common Cause in Maryland, he also feels strongly about good government and the need for competition. \"We need democratic participation and debate,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nO'Donnell said he is entering the race as a progressive candidate, with platforms that include increasing public school funding, supporting a tax hike on income over $1 million, reforming campaign finance and voter registration laws and ensuring equity among regions, races and economic divides.\n\nWhile no other candidates have yet announced their intention to run, many local activists are talking about the race and seeking new candidates - including some who are already running for other offices.\n\nNatalie Blais is running for the 1st Franklin House seat currently held by retiring Rep. Stephen Kulik. She held a day-long kickoff tour of the district on Saturday and said a number of supporters asked her to consider running for the open Senate seat instead.\n\nBut, Blais wrote in an email, \"While I am humbled by this outpouring of support, I am running for State Representative because I want to put my extensive public service experience to work for the people of the MA First Franklin District.\"\n\nAmherst lawyer and former governor's councilor Peter Vickery said a couple of people have asked him to run. \"I've respectfully declined,\" Vickery said. \"I'm running for Amherst Town Council, and that's the only thing I'm running for.\"\n\nThe most experienced state representatives from Rosenberg's district - Rep. Stephen Kulik, D-Worthington, and Rep. John Scibak, D-South Hadley, have both said previously that they plan to retire when their terms are up.\n\nRep. Solomon Goldstein-Rose, of Amherst, who won his seat as a Democrat then became unenrolled, said he is \"not actively considering\" running for Senate. He is focused on his re-election campaign against two Democratic opponents.\n\nBut, Goldstein-Rose said, \"If no one else I consider would be effective comes forward by weeks or month from now, I might reconsider it.\"\n\nOne of the Democrats challenging Goldstein-Rose is Eric Nakajima, chairman of the Amherst-Pelham Regional School Committee member. Nakajima said he is not considering a run for state Senate, but is focused on the state representative race.\n\n\"The whole thing's unfortunate,\" Nakajima said. \"For our district, we're just going to have to get organized, hopefully have a robust debate this fall and move forward.\""
