Rosenberg is now separated from his husband, Bryon Hefner, who is accused of sexually assaulting several men.\n\nAlso this week, confusion over what a new policy when it comes to enforcing federal marijuana laws in states that've legalized the drug. The Springfield police sent conflicting signals, saying they would follow state laws, but also cooperate with federal investigations.\n\nAnd finally, UMass researchers looking into problem gambling in the state presented some early results to casino regulators. One striking finding: that many people move in and out of problem gambling status within a given year.\n\nGUESTS:\n\nMike Dobbs, managing editor, Reminder Publications\n\nMatt Szafranski, editor, Western Mass.
