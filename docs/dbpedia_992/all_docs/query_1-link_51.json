        "text": "Cleanroom Air Filters\n\nCleanroom filtration utilizes unique chemistry to remove critical contaminants at a lower pressure drop. VaporSorb™ cleanroom chemical filters deliver greater than 95% removal efficiency. Implementation is easy in front/rear access frame banks, side access housing units or ceiling fan units.\n\nCaerus™ Coating Technology\n\nCaerus™ family of ALD coatings are deposited at low temperatures with superior film quality. Our Caerus coatings are highly conformal, dense, pinhole-free and exhibit homogeneous microstructure. The coatings have excellent adhesion and provide outstanding corrosion and etch resistance properties. They are also characterized by superb electrical voltage stand-off and exceptional trace metal diffusion barrier layer characteristics.\n\nPegasus™ Coating Technology\n\nPegasus™ series coatings are a family of precision-engineered PVD coatings tailored for Fluorine and Chlorine plasma etch applications. Our Pegasus coatings are deposited at low temperatures and can be deposited on aluminum, alumina, stainless steel and other commonly used substrate materials, with superior adhesion. These coatings provide etch resistance, low particle generation, and oxidation resistance.\n\nSurface Mount Gas Filters\n\nAvailable with stainless steel or nickel filter elements, Wafergard® gas filters provide ultimate process protection, superior corrosion-resistance, and excellent compatibility with inert, hydride, and reactive gases. The surface-mount design consumes less space on gas panels and reduces parts inventories and variations.\n\nGraphite Grades\n\nWe offer a wide range of graphite materials as well as post processing and machining capabilities to meet the demanding requirements of semiconductor processes. You can choose the right graphite for your application by grain size (one, five and ten micron) and all grades are sold in bulk form or as a custom machined components for specific applications.\n\nPremium Graphite Components\n\nOur graphite is tightly controlled to produce materials that have a uniform microstructure and the right balance of strength, grain size and hardness to offer optimum performance for your intended applications."
