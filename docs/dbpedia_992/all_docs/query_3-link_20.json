        "text": "By Joe Roberts\n\n4 min read\n\nWhat is a linear foot?\n\nA linear foot is 12 inches in a straight line. Using the term “linear” indicates that you are measuring in a straight line. Anytime you measure something in a straight line in the United States, you’re measuring how long that thing is in linear feet.\n\nLinear feet differ from square feet and cubic feet, though. And whether you’re measuring your yard, your moving truck, or the length of your fence, it’s important to know how and when to use these different measurements. Taking proper measurements is also an essential part of filling out a home inventory for your moving company.\n\nKeep reading to learn all there is to know about linear feet, square feet, and cubic feet. Along the way, we’ll also throw in a few conversion charts to help with all the math you’ll need to correctly measure your stuff.\n\nThe full picture\n\nHow to measure and calculate a linear foot\n\nIf you have a ruler or a measuring tape with markings in one-inch increments, you’re ready to measure anything in linear feet. Remember, a linear foot is 12 inches in a straight line.\n\nA linear foot measured on a ruler and two measuring tapes.\n\nIf you measure something and it’s 12 inches long, it’s one linear foot in length. If it’s 24 inches long, that’s two linear feet, etc. The nice thing is that most tape measures have markings for feet as well as inches, so you may not even need to do the calculations yourself.\n\nBut just in case your measuring tape doesn’t have markings for feet or you’re using a 12-inch ruler for all your measurements, here’s a handy conversion chart to make the math easy:\n\nInches to linear feet conversion chart\n\nInches\n\nLinear feet\n\n12 inches1 linear foot24 inches2 linear feet36 inches3 linear feet48 inches4 linear feet60 inches5 linear feet72 inches6 linear feet\n\nOf course, not all measurements can be nicely divided by 12. For example, if your dining table is 63 inches long, you won’t be able to write down its dimensions using only feet.\n\nFor situations like this, find the closest number divisible by 12 to the object’s length, calculate how many feet that is and write it down, and then write down how many inches are leftover. The length of the table from our example would be written as “5 feet 3 inches” or “5′3″.”\n\nWhen to measure in linear feet\n\nUse linear feet to measure anything in a straight line. If you need to know the length of a rug, the width of a bookcase, or the height of your child, linear feet will do the trick.\n\nReady to move?\n\nCompany\n\nCompany type\n\nMove.org rating\n\nPacking & loading services\n\nPricing\n\nDiscounts\n\nLearn more\n\nProfessional mover\n\n4.8\n\nYes\n\n$$$\n\n10% Move.org discount, military personnel, seniors\n\nGet a QuoteProfessional mover\n\n4.5\n\nYes\n\n$$$\n\nNone\n\nGet a QuoteProfessional mover\n\n4.8\n\nYes\n\n$$$\n\nSeniors\n\nGet a QuoteMoving container company\n\n4.6\n\nNo\n\n$$\n\n25% Move.org discount, military personnel\n\nGet a QuoteMoving container company\n\n4.5\n\nNo\n\n$$\n\nMove.org readers, military personnel\n\nGet a Quote\n\nWhat is square footage?\n\nSquare footage is used to measure the area of a flat surface. It can tell you how big your yard is, how much floor space your bed will take up, and how much wall space you’ll need for all your concert posters.\n\nWhen you calculate square footage, you actually use linear feet as part of the math.\n\nTo begin finding the square footage of an object or space, measure its length in linear feet. Then, measure it in one other direction. You only need to take two measurements to find square footage, but which measurements you should take depend on what you’re measuring.\n\nTo find a wall’s square footage, measure its length and its height. Similarly, to know how much wall space a piece of decor or furniture will take up, measure its length and its height. To find the square footage of your kitchen floor or learn how much floor space something will take up, measure its width and its length.\n\nOnce you have these two measurements, multiply them by each other. The product is the object’s or space’s square footage. For example, if your garage is 10 feet wide and 16 feet long, the area of your garage floor is 160 square feet.\n\nThis is an example of how to calculate the square footage of a flat surface that's 10 ft. long x 16 ft. wide.\n\nThe math for calculating square feet can be a bit trickier than measuring linear feet, so you’ll probably need a calculator, but here’s a conversion chart that illustrates how to do it:\n\nLinear feet to square feet conversion chart\n\nDimensions in linear feet\n\nSquare footage\n\n5 feet long x 10 feet tall50 square feet2 feet wide x 7 feet long14 square feet20 feet wide x 25 feet long500 square feet28 feet wide x 60 feet long1,680 square feet\n\nWhen to measure in square feet\n\nUse square feet whenever you need to know the total area of a flat surface or the footprint of a piece of furniture. Square footage can tell you how big a rug is, how much floor space your coffee table will take up in your living room, or how large your patio is.\n\nWhat if an object or space is round?\n\nCalculating the square footage and cubic footage of round objects requires more complex math, so you should only really do it with a calculator. Here are some handy calculators that can find the square footage and cubic footage of round objects for you.\n\nWhat is cubic footage?\n\nCubic footage is used to calculate a container’s volume and how much room an object will occupy in a container. In short, it can tell you how much stuff you can fit into things like boxes, cabinets, rooms, moving trucks, and storage units.\n\nTo find the cubic footage of a space or an object, you’ll once again start by measuring linear footage. This time, though, you’ll measure in all three directions: length, width, and height.\n\nOnce you have all three dimensions, you’ll multiply them together. The product is the cubic footage. For example, if a moving truck’s cargo compartment is 10 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high, the compartment is 360 cubic feet in volume.\n\nThis is an example of how to calculate the capacity of a moving truck's cargo area in cubic footage.\n\nNow, the numbers involved in cubic feet get pretty big, and the math can be a little too tricky to quickly do in your head, so use a calculator when trying to find an object's cubic footage. To illustrate exactly how to do this, here are a few examples:\n\nLinear feet to cubic feet conversion chart\n\nDimensions in linear feet\n\nCubic footage\n\n2 feet long x 5 feet wide x 10 feet tall100 cubic feet7 feet long x 10 feet wide x 6 feet tall420 cubic feet10 feet long x 15 feet wide x 5 feet tall750 cubic feet\n\nWhen to measure in cubic feet\n\nFAQs about linear feet and other measurements\n\nA linear foot is 12 inches in a straight line, which is why it is called a “linear” foot.\n\nA square foot is a flat area that measures 12 inches long and 12 inches wide, a perfect square. The entire area of a square foot is 144 square inches.\n\nA cubic foot is a three-dimensional space that measures 12 inches long, 12 inches high, and 12 inches wide, like a cube. The volume of a cubic foot is 1,728 cubic inches.\n\nThere are three linear feet in a linear yard, so a yard is 36 inches long.\n\nA meter is 3.28 feet—about 39 inches—in length. This makes a meter only slightly larger than a yard. For quick conversion between feet and meters, use this calculator.\n\nRecommended resources\n\nLooking up measuring info because you’re planning a move and need to know how big your stuff is?
