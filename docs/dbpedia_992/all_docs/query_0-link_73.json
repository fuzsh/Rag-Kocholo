        "text": "Dimple pre-aggregates your data based on the dimensionality defined in your code. This means that you need some way to distinguish the rows in your data, otherwise they will be aggregated. You should think about what makes a row different from another row and capture that in the data. For example I have assumed that they are observations and numbered them:\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < chartdata.length; i += 1) { chartdata[i][\"Observation\"] = i; }\n\nThen referenced this new dimension in the series arrays:\n\nvar s = myChart.addSeries([\"Observation\", \"Tyre\"], dimple.plot.line);"
