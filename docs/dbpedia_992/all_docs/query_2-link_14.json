        "text": "In my discussions about photographing the Milky Way and in conversations I see happening online, a common first question is “What lens should I use for Milky Way photography“. Much has been said on this topic (astrobackyard.com has a great discussion on the topic) from a technical point of view, meaning which lenses have the lowest distortion of stars (for things such as lens coma), the least barrel distortion, the least vignetting, etc, but what I want to talk about here are the artistic reasons you might choose one focal length over another, and give you some examples. Frankly, I think when most beginners are asking the above question, what they’re really wanting to know is “What focal length should I use to photograph the Milky Way“, rather than necessarily which lens, because they’re thinking of an end result – what lens will make my end result look “right”. They haven’t even gotten to “why do my stars look like airplanes” or “why are all my corners dark”, yet – but that of course will come.\n\nNow, why would you choose one focal length over another when photographing the Milky Way? As we move from really wide focal lengths, say 14mm, to a much more narrow focal length, like 50mm, the core of the Milky Way will appear much larger in the sky, making your sky (in my opinion) more dramatic. There is some give and take though, because if you want to have room in your scene for a foreground object, as you get narrower and narrower with your focal length, you’ll have to give up parts of the sky to make it all fit. Some people may choose a really wide lens because they want to show a lot of the Milky Way but also want to show a lot of foreground. Conversely, you may want to frame one particular object in the foreground with a very specific part of the night sky. I’ve put in a lot of examples below so that you can see how the end result changes. Pay particular attention to how much of the sky you’re seeing at each focal length, and also how complex or basic your foreground needs to be to accommodate everything (don’t read basic as bad here, basic compositions can be very compelling when done right, and I would argue are easier to pull off than very complex foregrounds as the viewer has too much competing for their attention in the frame).\n\nOne more quick comment. As you look at the images below, try not to get hung up on the amount of detail in the sky, color in the sky, or other aesthetics like that. The images below span a good bit of time, and how I capture and process my images has changed quite a bit. The thing to pay attention to here is how much of the band of stars are visible, and how big of a scene it seems to be.\n\n–Dan Thompson\n\n14mm is where most people start when photographing the Milky Way. It gets you a lot of sky and plenty of room for foreground objects. In case you weren’t 100% sure, the Milky Way is the band of stars in the sky (okay, technically it’s the entire sky, because we can’t see past our galaxy standing here on earth with out telescopes, but you get the idea) and what people refer to as the core, is the larger, brighter section, right of center in this picture. The C shape, and then the long dark finger that extends out above the core in this image is known as the Dark Horse nebula. If you follow along the top half of the band to the left, you’ll then come to what appears to be a missing spot (I call this the blowout – I don’t know if it has a real name). Just left of that you’ll notice what looks like a dark hashmark, and then to the left of that another brighter area that almost looks smeared. As you scroll on down, pay particular attention to all those objects, and what starts disappearing as you get narrower and narrower.\n\nAlright now, you’re probably thinking, wait a minute… this is a narrower focal length but somehow I can see more of the Milky Way. Perhaps in that way this is a bad example but I want to bring this up here quickly. As the year progresses here in the Northern Hemisphere, the Milky Way core will set on the horizon, just like the sun sets in the evening. Note here that while you can see further up the band of the Milky Way, the Dark Horse is now almost touching the ground, so because of the time of year, we’ve traded what was the far right-hand side of the Milky Way in the image above (which was basically obscured by trees), for a little more at what is the top of this image, but ultimately you’re seeing slightly less of the overall body of the Milky Way.\n\nThe real point I want to make here is the use of vertical orientation in stead of horizontal. Again, here in the Northern Hemisphere, as the year progresses, the Milky Way goes from being strung out sideways across the sky, like in the image above this one, to being very vertical in the sky like this image here. Note how much blank sky there is in the image above this one, versus how the vertical orientation here eliminates a lot of that, but also limits what you can put in the foreground up close. This type of camera alignment can be leveraged for very tall foreground objects, like the cactus above, and to accentuate the vertical oriented band of the Milky Way that appears in our sky in the Northern Hemisphere in late summer, early fall.\n\nThe horizontal 24mm image and the 22mm image were shot very close to one another as the crow flies (same mountains in the background essentially, just closer to them), which is to say it’s at the same longitude again. Note how the extra part of the Milky Way to the left of the dark hashmark is now gone, and the right-hand side of the Milky Way past the core is almost all but gone here as well.\n\nI’ve included here also an example of a 24mm image in vertical orientation, for comparison. This is later in the Milky Way season also, though one month earlier than the cactus image above. In this image you can see that the hashmark is chopped off, but we could have seen a little more of the bottom of the Milky Way, had it not been for the very large butte in the foreground. In vertical orientation at 24mm, when the Milky Way is vertical in the sky, it all but fills up the frame.\n\nTo me, if you want to know what focal length is best for photographing the Milky Way, it’s somewhere between 18-24mm. The sky is nice and dramatic, but you’ve still got room to move around a bit with your foregrounds. That’s just my opinion, let’s keep going!\n\nAt 40mm, we’re really starting to have to sacrifice things in the sky or the foreground. As you can see, at 40mm, the body of the Milky Way takes up the entire frame, and you’re just barely fitting in the entirety of the Dark Horse nebula and the core of the Milky Way. This took very careful planning to pull off. To set this up, I had to find an object that was on a hill (the hay bale), so that I could get below it and aim the camera upwards, so the sky would actually line up behind my object. This particular field is rolling, which helped, but without the benefit of being able to physically move the bales, I still had to walk all over the field trying to find one that would line up just right. This image is also admittedly a compromise. I had a hard time finding a subject that would work at all, beyond just the mountain tops (see the next two scenes), so it was particularly challenging. If you live in an area with a lot of open, flat spaces, perhaps it would be easier, but here in the foothills of the Smokies, it was tough."
