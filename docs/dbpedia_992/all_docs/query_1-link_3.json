        "text": "Introduction\n\nScan length, patient centering and positioning impact both image quality and radiation dose associated with CT scanning [1]. Scan length beyond the intended anatomy of interest may lead to unnecessary radiation dose and risks detection of incidental lesions which can require further testing and elevate patient anxiety [2]. Patient mis-centering interferes with adequate functioning of beam-shaping filters and lead to under- or over-estimation of radiation dose across the cross-section of the body anatomy being imaged [3]. The latter is often associated with asymmetric and increased image noise and artifacts. Position of arms by side of the body during chest CT scanning is associated with artifacts and increased image noise despite an increase in radiation dose with automatic exposure-based modulation of applied tube current [4].\n\nMost CT scanners and scan procedures demand close attention to patient positioning, centering and selection of scan length. Inappropriate patient positioning and centering can lead to increased image noise and artifacts that can compromise detection of incidental pathologies besides leading to greater than necessary radiation dose to the patients. These details represent non-trivial aspects of scanning that enable highest level of service and best hope for radiation dose optimization while retaining diagnostic quality of CT, a modality that contributes to the largest fraction of radiation dose from medical imaging. However, demands and anxieties of a pandemic like the ongoing COVID-19 infection can challenge or impede attention of CT technologist to these details over concern for personal safety and need to maintain minimum contact and maximum social distancing.\n\nImaging tools such as CT and radiography were and are being heavily used in the ongoing pandemic in patients with known or suspected infection, and that brings imaging personnel such as the CT technologists in close patient contact and increases their risk of contracting the virus. With adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and precautions such risks can be reduced, but scarcity of such resources has been reported across the world [5]. Although prior studies have reported on variations on applications and radiation doses of CT in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis [6], to our best knowledge, there are no publications on how the practice of CT scanning has unfolded and how it has affected associated radiation doses. Thus, the purpose of our study was to assess centering, scan length, and positioning of patients undergoing chest CT for suspected or known COVID-19 pneumonia and to investigate their effect on associated radiation doses.\n\nDiscussions\n\nOur multicenter, international study found substantial variations in radiation doses associated with a single-phase, chest CT examinations performed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia despite nearly identical distribution of patient age and cross-sectional effective diameters. We report frequent and greater mis-centering in most patients included in our study at all four participating facilities from Asia, Europe, North and South America. In comparison, prior studies in non-COVID-19 chest CT examinations reported mixed results. For example, Eberhard et al. [9], Akin-Akintayo et al. [10], and Habibzadeh et al. [11] reported mean mis-centering distances of 10.6, 17, and 16 mm, respectively (compared to 17.6–22.6 mm in our study). Conversely, mis-centering in our study was lower than 24.9 mm reported by Li et al [12] and similar to 19 mm mis-centering distance in a study from Saltybaeva et al [13]. The extent of mis-centering in our study is likely related to lack of attention to centering, or lack of awareness on importance of good patient centering among CT radiographers/technologists at the participating sites. It is likely that such lack of attention was compounded by an intent to minimize patient contact in a setting of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough the effect of arm position on radiation dose associated with chest CT has been reported [14], its frequency and effect on scan length and mis-centering observed in our study has not been studied. We report that patients with arms by their side during chest CT are more likely to be mis-centered, scanned over longer area, and receive higher radiation dose. Although relationship between increased scan length and positioning of arms could have been coincidental, it is important to note that when arms are positioned by the side of the body, they project on the chest in the lateral planning radiograph and can affect delineation of posterior costophrenic recesses and lower lungs which are difficult to see on the anteroposterior or posteroanterior planning radiographs. Relationship between mis-centering and arm positioning may be coincidental or related to the fact that positioning of the arms by the side of the patient impairs technologists’ ability to judge the center of patient’s chest. Although we could not specifically assess the reason for chest CT with arms by the side of the body, it is likely that the higher frequency of arms by the side resulted from a combination of shoulder pain/arthropathy, presence of multiple lines and tubes in sick, ventilated patients, as well as from an attempt to minimize patient contact [15]. Likewise, longer than necessary scan lengths, notably extending below L2 or L3 vertebral body level increased the associated DLP.\n\nA weak correlation between the scan length and DLP (r = 0.446) was likely related to the fact that most participating sites (3/4) used automatic tube current modulation which adapts tube current to patient size. As patient size (measured with effective diameter) was not correlated with the scan length, the tube current and therefore the applied radiation dose (CTDIvol at fixed tube potential) varied independently of the scan length and led to a weak correlation with scan length.\n\nThe chief implication of our study is the extent of variations in patient centering and scan lengths in patients undergoing chest CT for suspected or known COVID-19 infection. Such efforts can help of being better image quality with less artifact and aid in radiation dose optimization regardless of the clinical indication for scanning (with or without COVID-19 infection). It is imperative that imaging departments and hospital provide high quality PPE to CT radiographers/technologists so that they can serve with full confidence as the frontline workers involved in treating patients with contagious or communicable diseases. When available, technologists should change the table height from the console room without entering the scan room if they notice mis-centering on the planning radiographs. Our study also calls for enhanced effort from the CT industry to bring automatic centering and patient positioning techniques into real-world scanners regardless of their make, model, and year of installation. Two main CT vendors have reported on capabilities of automatic patient positioning software and hardware options to reduce mis-centering and select appropriate scan length. Li et al [12] reported on use of planning radiograph-based automatic patient re-centering technique in 2007 (GE) although unfortunately, their technique was never commercialized. More recent publications describe a commercially available, artificial intelligence-based technique (Siemens) for automatic patient centering and scan length determination on some of its scanners [13]. While these vendors deserve kudos for their efforts to identify with the issues and come up with excellent solutions, more is needed from them at the time of the current and future pandemics in an era of globalization and shrinking distances, so that we can maintain better CT image quality, reduce radiation dose, and make scanning safer for our CT technologists without requiring them to pay extra attention to details (centering and scan length prescription) where automated techniques have a proven track record of success [12], [13]. CT vendors can also help reduce mis-centering and over-scanning by displaying their extent as well as their effects on image quality (such as increase in noise or artifacts) and radiation dose to the patients undergoing CT. On our part, we have conveyed findings of our study to the respective facilities so that CT technologists can pay more attention to patient positioning, centering and prescription of optimum scan length.\n\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, our study was limited to one or two CT facilities per country and a small number of patients and may not reflect a universal or common practice. Since, all participating CT facilities represented large, referral hospitals, we cannot comment on frequency and effect of mis-centering, arm position, and scan length on smaller CT facilities. Second, radiation doses across different CT facilities cannot be compared across different sites due to substantial differences in scanner technologies in these facilities. Third, we did not assess the effect of arm position or mis-centering on diagnostic quality of the exam since those effects have been documented in prior studies [14]. Fourth, we did not have information on patient location at the time of scanning from all facilities. Thus, we cannot establish if hospitalized or critical care unit patients with advanced or complicated disease have higher frequency of mis-centering, arms by the side of their body, and longer than necessary scan lengths. Fifth, manual measurement of mis-centering can lead to errors despite our attempt to double-check each measurement. We did not have access to any automated software or method of estimating mis-centering from CT images. Sixth, we did not have access to patients’ weight at the time of scanning from 3/4 CT facilities. Instead, we used effective diameter as a surrogate for patient size which is a better marker of cross-sectional size than body weight. However, a lack of significant differences in radiation doses (summarized in ) at some facilities for patients with different effective diameters may have been related to inadequate sample size or arbitrary classification of effective diameter (≤30 and > 30 cm). Seventh, none of the participating facilities recorded their patients’ height; this complicates comparison of scan length and DLP. However, information on vertebral body levels at scan start and end locations helped us compare scan lengths and DLP across different facilities. Finally, due to retrospective nature of the study, we could not capture the information on change in scan parameters and radiation doses as a result of patient mis-centering."
