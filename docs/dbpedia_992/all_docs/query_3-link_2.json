        "text": "Area is the amount of surface a two-dimensional shape can cover, measured in square units. The SI unit of area is the square meter (m2), which is a derived unit.\n\nCommon Units of Area\n\nSquare millimeter (mm2) can be visualized as a square that is 1 mm on each side (or 1 mm x 1 mm).\n\nSquare centimeter (cm2) can be visualized as a square that is 1 cm on each side (or 1 cm x 1 cm).\n\nSquare meter (m2) can be visualized as a square that is 1 m on each side (or 1 m x 1 m). Square meters are used in intermediate applications, such as calculating the area of a room to purchase the right amount of carpet.\n\nHectare is a special name for 10,000 square meters (m2), which can be visualized as a square that is 100 m on each side (or 100 m x 100 m). Larger areas within a city neighborhood or the size of a farm can be measured in hectares (ha).\n\nSquare kilometer (km2) can be visualized as a square that is 1 km on each side (or 1 km x 1 km). Square kilometers typically measure very large areas.\n\nEveryday Areas\n\nResources for Students and Teachers:\n\nMetric Rainfall Calculation Activity and Rainfall Rates (US Geological Survey). How much water falls during a rain storm? Choose an area and a rainfall amount (mL) to determine the volume of water (L) that fell from the sky and was delivered onto that area. You'll be surprised about much rain really does fall during a rainstorm. A variety of common rainfall rates (mm per hour) are described.\n\nSI Prefixes. In the metric system of measurement, designations of multiples and subdivision of any unit may be arrived at by combining with the name of the unit the prefixes. (NIST)\n\nCalculate Area. Become familiar with methods used to calculate the area of common objects. (NIST)\n\nSI Volume. Explore resources to become familiar with units used to measure volume, including the liter. (NIST)\n\nSI Units Card Deck (SP 1297). This activity offers a fun way to enhance understanding of the International System of Units, including the defining constants, base units, derived units with special names, and prefixes.
