        "text": "Standard units of measurement support readability and accuracy. Express precise values for users by combining numerals with the correct unit symbol.\n\nUse the standard units of measurement\n\nAustralia uses the metric system for most quantities:\n\nThe modern form of the metric system is the International System of Units (SI).\n\nAustralia also uses some non-SI legal units of measurement, which are listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the National Measurement Regulations.\n\nThe National Measurement Institute oversees Australian units of measurement. The governing legislation is the National Measurement Act 1960.\n\nDon’t use the non-SI legal units of measurement for international content. The exception is when you have checked that users will understand and accept them.\n\nRules for units of measurement:\n\nPunctuation: don’t place a full stop after a unit of measurement.\n\nCapitalisation: use capitals only if the unit represents a proper name.\n\nPlural and possessive: units don’t have a plural or possessive form.\n\nStart of a sentence: write out the unit in full.\n\nSpacing: use a non-breaking space between the number and the unit.\n\nExample\n\n‘m’ for metre\n\n‘kg’ for kilogram\n\n‘W’ for watt\n\nAccessibility requirements\n\nMeasurements and units can include:\n\nsymbols (for example, ‘μ’ for ‘micro’)\n\nsuperscript (a number, letter or symbol placed above a line – for example, the ‘2’ in ‘km2’).\n\nUnless they are coded correctly, symbols and superscript may be inaccessible for some people who:\n\nhave low vision\n\nuse screen readers to access content.\n\nInsert symbols and superscript with tools such as:\n\nUnicode\n\nLaTeX\n\nMathematical Markup Language (MathML).\n\nThese tools make mathematical equations and symbols accessible, including for screen readers.\n\nEnsure both symbols and superscript can be enlarged without loss of content or functionality. Don't use images of symbols or superscript.\n\nResources:\n\nW3C math home\n\nCreating accessible math with MathML\n\nAn introduction to LaTeX\n\nLaTeX & MathML\n\nWCAG quick reference: 1.3.1 Info and relationships – level A\n\nWrite numerals with units of measurement\n\nUse numerals, not words, for numbers when you are referring to a unit of measurement:\n\nAlways use numerals next to a unit of measurement.\n\nInclude a non-breaking space between the number and the unit.\n\nLike this\n\n5 t\n\n5 tonnes\n\nNot this\n\nfive t\n\nfive tonnes\n\nUse symbols for common units of measurement\n\nYou don’t need to spell out units of measurement, even for the first use, if they’re well known and users will know what they mean.\n\nExample\n\n‘mm’ for millimetres\n\n‘cm’ for centimetres\n\n‘km’ for kilometres\n\n‘km/h’ for kilometres per hour\n\nSpell out units of measurement the first time you use them if users won’t immediately understand them. After that, use the symbols.\n\nExample\n\nThe noise from the building site was 120 decibels (dB). Workers in the nearby office preferred a limit of only 50 dB.\n\nDon’t combine symbols and words for units.\n\nLike this\n\nQueensland is 1,853 million km2 in area.\n\nNot this\n\nQueensland is 1,853 million square km in area.\n\nSI prefixes for large and small quantities\n\nInternationally accepted prefixes and their symbols make it easier for users to read, understand and compare numbers. Use them in government content.\n\nTable 1 details common prefixes and their symbols.\n\nA complete list of prefixes and symbols is available at The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).\n\nTable 1: Commonly used prefixes for SI units Prefix Symbol Factor Extended form tera T 1012 1,000,000,000,000 giga G 109 1,000,000,000 mega M 106 1,000,000 kilo k 103 1,000 hecto h 102 100 deca (also ‘deka’) da 101 10 deci d 10-1 0.1 centi c 10-2 0.01 milli m 10-3 0.001 micro µ 10-6 0.000001 nano n 10-9 0.000000001\n\nNote: the International Bureau of Weights and Measures uses ‘deca’ but this is spelled ‘deka’ in Schedule 3 of the National Measurement Regulations.\n\nExample\n\n63 megalitres is 63,000,000 litres\n\n0.001 metre is 1 millimetre\n\nDon’t use non-standard units.\n\nLike this\n\nThere was 5 μg of active ingredient in each capsule.\n\nHe measured 50 mL of water.\n\nNot this\n\nThere was 5 mcg of active ingredient in each capsule.\n\nHe measured 5 dL of water.\n\nData storage and transfer\n\nThe prefixes for data storage and transfer work differently to those used for SI units. ‘Byte’ (B) is the unit of storage and data transfer speed. For this purpose, use:\n\n‘kilobyte’ for 1,000 B\n\n‘megabyte’ for 1,024 kB\n\n‘gigabyte’ for 1,024 MB\n\n‘terabyte’ for 1,024 GB.\n\nUnits of time\n\nDays, years, hours and minutes measure time. These are not SI units. Spell them out in full – unless they’re in a table, list or chart and are easy to understand.\n\nExample\n\nI have been working in the public service for 12 years.\n\nHe started in the new department 20 days ago.\n\nThey sent the report in the last 15 minutes.\n\nUse symbols for units that are derived from time measurements, such as speed.\n\nExample\n\nThe speed limit for urban areas in NSW is 50 km/h.\n\nPut a non-breaking space between numbers and units\n\nPeople will read the number and its unit as a measurement only if the 2 components sit together. To do this, use a non-breaking space between numbers and their units of measurement.\n\nWithout a non-breaking space, a unit could reflow to the next line. This would separate it from the quantity, making it difficult for users to understand the information being presented.\n\nAlthough this is important for all content, it’s more likely to happen on smaller screens, such as those on mobile devices.\n\nLike this\n\nThe post should be at least 1.5 m tall.\n\n[The sentence has a &nbsp; inserted between ‘1.5’ and ‘m’.]\n\nNot this\n\nThe post should be at least 1.5\n\nm tall.\n\n[A bad line break between the measurement and its unit]\n\nBy convention, some industries don’t have a space between the quantity and the unit. Many 750 mL bottles of wine, for example, have the volume 750mL printed on the label.\n\nCheck the preferred style if you are writing for a specialist application.\n\nDon’t add ‘s’ for plural forms\n\nSymbols for units of measurement represent both the singular and the plural forms. Don’t use an ‘s’ to show plural with the symbols for units.\n\nLike this\n\n56 km\n\nNot this\n\n56 kms\n\nCompare measurements using the same units\n\nMake it easy for users to compare quantities. Use the same:\n\nunit and prefix\n\nnumber of decimal places.\n\nLike this\n\nThe Green Wattle Creek fire burnt almost 3,000 km2, of which more than 1,000 km2 was national park.\n\nThe smaller jug held 1.5 L and the bigger jug held 2.0 L.\n\nThe piece of wood was 140 mm by 1,320 mm by 20 mm.\n\nNot this\n\nThe Green Wattle Creek fire burnt almost 300,000 ha, of which more than 1,000 km2 was national park.\n\nThe smaller jug held 1,500 mL and the bigger jug held 2 L.\n\nThe piece of wood was 14 cm by 1.32 m by 20 mm.\n\nOnly use non-SI units if the user understands them\n\nThere are other units that are also Australian legal units of measurement but are not SI units. They’re listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the National Measurement Regulations.\n\nThese non-SI units are not all legally accepted in every country. Use them only if users will understand them. Some units, such as the nautical mile, are for use only in Australia. Table 2 details common examples of other legal Australian units.\n\nTable 2: Examples of other commonly used legal units in Australia Quality Name Symbol sound intensity decibel dB area hectare ha length nautical mile n mile mass tonne t time day d time hour h time minute min velocity knot kn volume litre L or l blood pressure millimetre of mercury mm Hg work and energy kilocalorie kcal\n\nNote: ‘litre’ can be represented as ‘L’ or ‘l’, depending on the type of content and who will be using it. Most government content should use ‘L’ as it’s clearer to users (‘l’ can be confused with ‘I’ and ‘1’).\n\nAvoid imperial units\n\nDon’t use imperial units of measurement in Australia unless you have a specific reason, such as:\n\nin quotations from historical documents\n\nwhen writing for readers in countries (particularly the United States) where imperial measures, or elements of them, still apply.\n\nExample\n\ngallons for volume of fuel\n\nbarrels for volume of oil\n\ninches for the size of a screen\n\nfeet for the altitude of a plane\n\nIt’s good practice to also provide the equivalent quantity in SI units when that helps users.\n\nExample\n\nIn the 1970s, the speed limit for highways in many states of Australia was set at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h).\n\nRelease notes\n\nThe digital edition consolidates information from the sixth edition about measurement and units. It links to external sources for more detailed information.\n\nThe digital edition follows advice from the sixth edition about including a space between the number and unit of measurement.\n\nThis is contrary to the recommendation in the Content Guide, which recommended omitting the space between number and measure.\n\nThe Content Guide had no information about imperial units.\n\nHelp us improve the Style Manual\n\nDid you find this page useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nPartially\n\nDo you have any other feedback?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nIs your feedback about:\n\nthis page\n\na different page\n\nmultiple pages\n\nTell us the name of the page or copy and paste the URL link\n\nSelect the answer that best describes your feedback:\n\nI can't find the information I'm looking for.\n\nI need more detail to answer my question.\n\nThere are errors in the guidance.\n\nThe topic I'm looking for is not in the Style Manual.\n\nI am having a technical problem.\n\nMy feedback is about something else.\n\nEnter your feedback here:\n\nDo you work for government?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nEmail\n\nWe cannot reply to individual questions and requests for help.
