        "text": "Hi Seema,\n\nYes, I understand that the Exchange rate is of DEC type.\n\nMy idea would be to add a characteristic infoObject to your infocube and load the exchange rate value.\n\nThis way, the data will not get aggregated at the infocube level.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a new DSO for storing Exchange rates for Documents and build a Composite provider on top of your infocube and DSO.\n\nBr, Harish\n\nHi Seema,\n\nTry to manage this case in the start routine. In the start routine (transformation from DSO to Cube) change the SOURCE_PACKAGE in such way that only the first item should have the exchange rate and remaining item's exchange rate should be zero. Make sure to use the semantic group (Sale order and Item) in your DTP. If you opt this then you have to do a full load every time.\n\nAnother way is to make exchange rate as a characteristic. Create exchange rate info object of type Char and add it in the cube. Map this filed in the transformation from DSO to Cube with exchange rate from DSO.\n\nThis will solve your problem.\n\nRegards,\n\nSatya."
