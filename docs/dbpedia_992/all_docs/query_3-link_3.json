        "text": "If you glance around, you'll see that we are surrounded by different geometric figures. Perhaps you have a table, a ruler, a pencil, or a piece of paper nearby, all of which can be thought of as geometric figures.\n\nIf we look again at the ruler (or imagine one), we can think of it as a rectangle. In geometry, the sides of this rectangle or edges of the ruler are known as line segments. A line segment is one of the basic geometric figures, and it is the main component of all other figures in 2D and 3D.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, let's have a look at how the books define a line segment:\n\n\"A line segment is a section of a line that has two endpoints, A and B, and a fixed length. Being different from a line, which does not have a beginning or an end. The line segment between points A and B is denoted with a top bar symbol as the segment ABâ€¾\\overline{AB}AB.\"\n\nReturning to the ruler, we could name the beginning of the numbered side as point A and the end as point B. According to the definition, this actually corresponds to a line segment with a beginning and an end (endpoints A and B) and a fixed length (ruler's length).\n\nBut what if the line segment we want to calculate the length of isn't the edge of a ruler? Great question! Another way to determine the length of a line segment is by knowing the position (coordinates) of its endpoints A and B.\n\nThis implies that a line segment can be drawn in a coordinate plane XY. This coordinate plane representation of a line segment is very useful for algebraically studying the characteristics of geometric figures, as is the case of the length of a line segment.\n\nIn the sections below, we go into further detail on how to calculate the length of a segment given the coordinates of its endpoints."
