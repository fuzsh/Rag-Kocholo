        "text": "Standard Units:\n\nYou are probably familiar with a lot of these measurements. Length is about a distance. These distances answer questions with \"how far?\", \"how long?\", and \"how high?\".\n\n1 foot = 12 inches (inches are usually divided into sixteenths on a ruler)\n\n1 yard = 3 feet = 36 inches\n\n1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet = 63,360 inches\n\nMetric Units:\n\nThe basis of length units for the metric system is the meter. 1 meter is about( but not totally! ) the same length of 1 yard.\n\nYou already read that the metric system is based on units of ten so here's a starter list, but they go on forever.\n\n1 centimeter = 10 millimeters\n\n1 meter = 100 centimeters = 1,000 millimeters\n\n1 kilometer = 1,000 meters = 100,000 centimeters = 100,000,000 millimeters\n\nConversion:\n\nYou're going to have to go back and forth with units. Converting inches into centimeters and\n\nfeet into meters is a regular thing in math and science classes. Here are a few conversions.\n\nTechnically you only need one conversion, but sometimes it's easier to use one closer to the\n\nvalues you want.\n\n1 inch = 2.54 centimeters = 25.4 millimeters\n\n1 foot = 30.48 centimeters\n\n1 yard = 0.91 meters\n\n1 mile = 1.6 kilometers\n\n1 millimeter = 0.04 inches\n\n1 centimeter = .39 inches = 0.0325 feet\n\n1 meter = 3.28 feet\n\n1 kilometer = 0.62 miles\n\nExample:\n\nSo if I'm going to run a 5 Kilometer race over the weekend, how many miles will I run? Answer: 3.1 miles"
