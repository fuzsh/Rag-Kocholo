        "text": "Reference value of length\n\nA unit of length refers to any arbitrarily chosen and accepted reference standard for measurement of length. The most common units in modern use are the metric units, used in every country globally. In the United States the U.S. customary units are also in use. British Imperial units are still used for some purposes in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The metric system is sub-divided into SI and non-SI units.[1][2][3]\n\nMetric system\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Metric system\n\nSI\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: International System of Units\n\nSee also: Orders of magnitude (length)\n\nThe base unit in the International System of Units (SI) is the meter, defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1‚ÅÑ299792458 seconds.\"[4] It is approximately equal to 1.0936 yd. Other SI units are derived from the meter by adding prefixes, as in millimeter or kilometer, thus producing systematic decimal multiples and submultiples of the base unit that span many orders of magnitude. For example, a kilometer is 1000 m.\n\nNon-SI\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the centimeter‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units, the basic unit of length is the centimeter, or 1‚ÅÑ100 of a meter. Other non-SI units are derived from decimal multiples of the meter.\n\nName Symbol SI value fermi fm femtometer √•ngstr√∂m √Ö 100 picometers micron Œºm 1 micrometer Norwegian/Swedish mil or myriameter 10,000 meters x unit xu 0.1 picometer\n\nImperial/U.S.\n\n[edit]\n\nThe basic unit of length in the imperial and U.S. customary systems is the yard, defined as exactly 0.9144 m by international treaty in 1959.[2][5]\n\nCommon imperial units and U.S. customary units of length include:[6]\n\nthou or mil (1‚ÅÑ1000 of an inch)\n\ninch ( 25.4 mm)\n\nfoot (12 inches, 0.3048 m)\n\nyard (3 feet, 0.9144 m)\n\n(terrestrial) mile (5280 feet, 1609.344 m)\n\n(land) league 3 miles (4,800 m)\n\nMarine\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition, the following are used by sailors:\n\nfathom (for depth; only in non-metric countries) (2 yards = 1.8288 m)\n\nnautical mile (one minute of arc of latitude = 1852 m)\n\nAviation\n\n[edit]\n\nAviators use feet for altitude worldwide (except in Russia and China) and nautical miles for distance.[citation needed]\n\nSurveying\n\n[edit]\n\nSurveyors in the United States continue to use:\n\nchain (22 yards, or 20.1168 m)\n\nrod (also called pole or perch) (quarter of a chain, 51‚ÅÑ2 yards, or 5.0292 m)\n\nBuilding trades\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Australian building trades adopted the metric system in 1966 and the units used for measurement of length are meters (m) and millimeters (mm). Centimeters (cm) are avoided as they cause confusion when reading plans. For example, the length two and a half meters is usually recorded as 2500 mm or 2.5 m; it would be considered non-standard to record this length as 250 cm.[7][8]\n\nSurveyor's trade\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican surveyors use a decimal-based system of measurement devised by Edmund Gunter in 1620. The base unit is Gunter's chain of 66 feet (20 m) which is subdivided into 4 rods, each of 16.5 ft or 100 links of 0.66 feet. A link is abbreviated \"lk\", and links \"lks\", in old deeds and land surveys done for the government.\n\nScience\n\n[edit]\n\nAstronomy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Astronomical system of units\n\nAstronomical measure uses:\n\nEarth radius Rüú® ‚âà 6,371 km[9]\n\nLunar distance LD ‚âà 384402 km.[10] Average distance between the center of Earth and the center of the Moon.\n\nastronomical unit au.

This is often a characteristic radius or wavelength of a particle. Some common natural units of length are included in this table:\n\nAtomic property Symbol Length, in meters Reference The classical electron radius re 2.817940285(31)√ó10‚àí15 [13] The Compton wavelength of the electron ŒªC 2.426310215(18)√ó10‚àí12 [13] The reduced Compton wavelength of the electron ŒªC 3.8615926764(18)√ó10‚àí13 [14] The Compton wavelength (or reduced Compton wavelength) of any fundamental particle Œªx The Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom (Atomic unit of length) a0 5.291772083(19)√ó10‚àí11 [13] The reduced wavelength of hydrogen radiation 1 / R‚àû 9.112670505509(83)√ó10‚àí8 [13] The Planck length ùìÅP 1.616199(97)√ó10‚àí35 [15] Stoney unit of length lS 1.381√ó10‚àí35 Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) unit of length lQCD 2.103√ó10‚àí16 Natural units based on the electronvolt 1 eV‚àí1 1.97√ó10‚àí7\n\nArchaic\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: English units of length\n\nArchaic units of distance include:\n\ncana\n\ncubit\n\nrope\n\nleague\n\nli (China)\n\npace (the \"double pace\" of about 5 feet used in Ancient Rome)\n\nverst (Russia)\n\nInformal\n\n[edit]\n\nIn everyday conversation, and in informal literature, it is common to see lengths measured in units of objects of which everyone knows the approximate width. Common examples are:\n\nDouble-decker bus (9.5‚Äì11 meters in length)\n\nFootball field (100 yards in length)\n\nThickness of a human hair (around 80 micrometers)\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nHorse racing and other equestrian activities keep alive:\n\nfurlong = 1‚ÅÑ8 mile (201.168 m)\n\nhorse length ‚âà 8 feet (2.4 m)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of conversion factors ¬ß Length\n\nList of examples of lengths\n\nList of unusual units of measurement ¬ß Length\n\nMedieval weights and measures\n\nOrders of magnitude (length)\n\nSystem of measurement\n\nUnits of measurement\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
