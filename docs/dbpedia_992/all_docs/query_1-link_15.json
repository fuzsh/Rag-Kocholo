        "text": "Measurement scale indicating the fitting size of a shoe\n\nA shoe size is an indication of the fitting size of a shoe for a person.\n\nThere are a number of different shoe-size systems used worldwide. While all shoe sizes use a number to indicate the length of the shoe, they differ in exactly what they measure, what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Some systems also indicate the shoe width, sometimes also as a number, but in many cases by one or more letters. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g. men's, women's, children's, sport, and safety shoes). This article sets out several complexities in the definition of shoe sizes. In practice, shoes are often tried on for both size and fit before they are purchased.\n\nDeriving the shoe size\n\n[edit]\n\nThe length of a person's foot is commonly defined as the distance between two parallel lines that are perpendicular to the foot and in contact with the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel. Foot length is measured with the subject standing barefoot and the weight of the body equally distributed between both feet.\n\nThe sizes of the left and right feet are often slightly different. In this case, both feet are measured, and purchasers of mass-produced shoes are advised to purchase a shoe size based on the larger foot, as most retailers do not sell pairs of shoes in non-matching sizes.\n\nEach size of shoe is considered suitable for a small interval of foot lengths, typically limited by half-point of the shoe size system.\n\nA shoe-size system can refer to three characteristic lengths:\n\nThe median length of feet for which a shoe is suitable. For customers, this measure has the advantage of being directly related to their body measures. It applies equally to any type, form, or material of shoe. However, this measure is less popular with manufacturers,[citation needed] because it requires them to test carefully for each new shoe model, for which range of foot sizes it is recommendable. It puts on the manufacturer the burden of ensuring that the shoe will fit a foot of a given length.\n\nThe length of the inner cavity of the shoe. This measure has the advantage that it can be measured easily on the finished product. However, it will vary with manufacturing tolerances and only gives the customer very crude information about the range of foot sizes for which the shoe is suitable.\n\nThe length of the \"last\", the foot-shaped template over which the shoe is manufactured. This measure is the easiest one for the manufacturer to use, because it identifies only the tool used to produce the shoe. It makes no promise about manufacturing tolerances or for what size of foot the shoe is actually suitable. It leaves all responsibility and risk of choosing the correct size with the customer. Further, the last can be measured in several different ways, resulting in different measurements.[1]\n\nAll these measures differ substantially from one another for the same shoe. For example, the inner cavity of a shoe must typically be 15 mm longer than the foot, and the shoe last would be 2 size points larger than the foot, but this varies between different types of shoes and the shoe size system used. The typical range lies between 1⁄2 to 2⁄3 inch (12.7 to 16.9 mm) for the UK/US size system and 4⁄3 to 5⁄3 cm (13.3 to 16.7 mm) for the European size system, but may extend to 1⁄4 to 3⁄4 inch (6.4 to 19.1 mm) and 2⁄3 to 6⁄3 cm (6.7 to 20.0 mm).\n\nLength\n\n[edit]\n\nSizing systems also differ in the units of measurement they use. This also results in different increments between shoe sizes, because usually only \"full\" or \"half\" sizes are made.\n\nThe following length units are commonly used today to define shoe-size systems:[citation needed]\n\nThe Paris point equates to 2⁄3 centimetre (6.67 mm; 0.26 in). Whole sizes are incremented by 1 Paris point; this corresponds to 3.33 millimetres (0.131 in) between half sizes. This unit is commonly used in Continental Europe, and Russia and former USSR countries.\n\nThe barleycorn is an old English unit that equates to 1⁄3 inch (8.47 mm). This is the basis for current UK and North American shoe sizes. \"Today in America, the sizing generally adheres relatively closely to a formula of 3 times the length of the foot in inches (the barleycorn length), less a constant (22 for men and 21 for women). In the UK, shoe sizes follow a similar method of computation, except that the constant is 23, and it is the same for men and women\".[2]\n\nMetric measurements in millimetres (mm) or centimetres (cm), with intervals of 5 mm and 7.5 mm are used in the international Mondopoint system (USSR/Russia and East Asia).\n\nSince the early 2000s, labels on sports shoes typically include sizes measured in all four systems: EU, UK, US, and Mondopoint.\n\nZero point\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sizing systems also place size 0 (or 1) at different locations:\n\nSize 0 as a foot's length of 0. The shoe size is directly proportional to the length of the foot in the chosen unit of measurement. Sizes of children's, men's, and women's shoes, as well as sizes of different types of shoes, can be compared directly. This is used with the Mondopoint system (USSR/Russia and East Asia).\n\nSize 0 as the length of the shoe's inner cavity of 0. The shoe size is then directly proportional to the inner length of the shoe. This is used with systems that also take the measurement from the shoe. While sizes of children's, men's and women's shoes can be compared directly, this is not necessarily true for different types of shoes that require a different amount of \"wiggle room\" in the toe box. This is used with the Continental European system.\n\nSize 0 (or 1) can just be simply a shoe of a given length. Typically, this will be the shortest length deemed practical; but this can be different for children's, teenagers', men's, and women's shoes - making it difficult to compare sizes. In America, the baseline for women's shoes is seven inches and for men's it is 7⁠1/3⁠ in.; in the UK, the baseline for both is 7⁠2/3⁠ in.[2]\n\nWidth\n\n[edit]\n\nSome systems also include the width of a foot (or the girth of a shoe last), but do so in a variety of ways:\n\nMeasured foot width in millimetres (mm) - this is done with the Mondopoint system.\n\nMeasured width as a letter (or combination of letters), which is taken from a table (indexed to length and width/girth) or just assigned on an ad-hoc basis. Examples are (each starting with the narrowest width):\n\nAAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE is the typical North American system and follows the brannock device standards, per the system B is narrow, C is regular, D is medium, E is wide, EE is extra wide and so on. The unlettered D size is the norm for men and B for women.\n\n4A, 3A, 2A, A, B, C, D, E, 2E, 3E, 4E, 5E, 6E (variant North American).\n\nC, D, E, F, G, H (common UK; \"medium\" is usually F but varies by manufacturer—makers Edward Green and Crockett & Jones, among others, use E instead, but one maker's E is not necessarily the same size as another's).\n\nN (narrow), M (medium) or R (regular), W (wide), XW (extra wide).\n\nFor children's sizes in North America, typical letters used are M or B (medium), W or D (wide), EW or 2E (extra wide).\n\nThe width for which these sizes are suitable can vary significantly between manufacturers. The A–E width indicators used by most American, Canadian, and some British shoe manufacturers are typically based on the width of the foot, and common step sizes are 3⁄16 inch (4.8 mm).\n\nFoot Width Conversion - approximation[3][4][5][6] N-M-R-W\n\nsystem\n\nNorth American\n\nsystem\n\nNorth American\n\nvariant\n\nUK\n\nsystem\n\nGerman\n\nsystem\n\nSS (super slim) AAAA 4A S (slim) AAA 3A N (narrow) AA 2A B (\"narrow\") E (\"very slim\") N (narrow) A A C E M (medium) B B D (\"Standard\") F (\"slim\") M (medium) C C D F R (regular) D D D F W (wide) E E E (\"Wide\") G (\"comfort\") XW/EW (extra wide) / WW (wide wide) EE 2E EE H (\"strong\") UW (ultra wide) / WWW EEE 3E EEE J (\"super wide\") UW (ultra wide) / WWW EEEE 4E K XXW (extra extra wide) EEEEE 5E L XXW (extra extra wide) EEEEEE 6E M\n\nDifficulties\n\n[edit]\n\nThere could be differences between various shoe size tables from shoemakers and shoe stores. They are usually due to the following factors:\n\nDifferent methods of measuring the shoes, different manufacturing processes, or different allowances[1] even when the same system is used.\n\nAn indication in centimetres or inches can mean the length of the foot or the length of the shoe's inner cavity.\n\nDiffering amounts of wiggle room required for different sizes of shoes.\n\nFor wide feet, a shoe several sizes larger (and actually too long) may be required and may also result in inconsistent size indications when different typical widths are attributed to specific shoe sizing systems.\n\nSome tables for children take future growth into account. The shoe size is then larger than what would correspond to the actual length of the foot.[7]\n\nConversion tables available on the Web often contain obvious errors, not taking into account different zero points or wiggle room.\n\nAlthough shoe size systems are not fully standardised, the ISO/TC 137 had released a technical specification ISO/TS 19407:2015 for converting shoe sizes across various local sizing systems. Even though the problem of converting shoe sizes accurately has yet to be fully resolved, this standard serves as \"a good compromise solution\" for shoe-buyers.[8][9]\n\nCommon sizing systems\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nShoe size in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan and South Africa is based on the length of the last used to make the shoes, measured in barleycorns (1⁄3 inch) starting from the smallest size deemed practical, which is called size zero. It is not formally standardised. The last is typically longer than the foot heel to toe length by 1⁄2 to 2⁄3 in or 1+1⁄2 to 2 barleycorns, so to determine the shoe size based on actual foot length one must add 2 barleycorns.\n\nA child's size zero is equivalent to 4 inches (a hand = 12 barleycorns = 10.16 cm), and the sizes go up to size 13+1⁄2 (measuring 25+1⁄2 barleycorns, or 8+1⁄2 inches (21.59 cm)). Thus, the calculation for a children's shoe size in the UK is:\n\nchild shoe size (barleycorns) = 3 × last length (in) − 12\n\nequivalent to:\n\nchild shoe size (barleycorns) ≈ 3 × foot length (in) − 10.\n\nAn adult size one is then the next size up (26 barleycorns, or 8+2⁄3 in (22.01 cm)) and each size up continues the progression in barleycorns.[10] The calculation for an adult shoe size in the UK is thus:\n\nadult shoe size (barleycorns) = 3 × last length (in) − 25\n\nequivalent to:\n\nadult shoe size (barleycorns) ≈ 3 × foot length (in) − 23.\n\nAlthough this sizing standard is nominally for both men and women, some manufacturers use different numbering for women's UK sizing.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the UK system is followed for men and children's footwear. Women's footwear follows the US sizings.\n\nIn Mexico, shoes are sized either according to the foot length they are intended to fit, in cm, or alternatively to another variation of the barleycorn system, with sizes calculated approximately as:\n\nadult shoe size (barleycorns) = 3 × last length (in) − 25+1⁄2\n\nequivalent to:\n\nadult shoe size (barleycorns) ≈ 3 × foot length (in) − 23+1⁄2.\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the traditional system is similar to British but there are different zero points for children's, men's, and women's shoe sizes. The most common is the customary system where men's shoes are one size longer than the UK equivalent, making a men's 13 in the US the same size as a men's 12 in the UK.\n\nCustomary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe customary system is offset by 1⁄4 barleycorn, or 1⁄12 in (2.12 mm), comparing to the UK sizes. The men's range starts at size 1, with zero point corresponding to the children's size 13 which equals 24+3⁄4 barleycorns or 8+1⁄4 inches (20.96 cm).\n\nHowever, most US manufacturers are using greater offsets, such as 1⁄2 and 1 barleycorns.[11] Therefore in current practice, US men's size 1 equals 25 barleycorns, or 8+1⁄3 in (21.17 cm), so the calculation for a male shoe size in the United States is:\n\nmale shoe size (barleycorns) = 3 × last length (in) − 24\n\nequivalent to:\n\nmale shoe size (barleycorns) ≈ 3 × foot length (in) − 22.\n\nIn the \"standard\" or \"FIA\" (Footwear Industries of America) scale, women's sizes are men's sizes plus 1 (so a men's 10+1⁄2 is a women's 11+1⁄2):\n\nfemale shoe size (barleycorns) = 3 × last length (in) − 23\n\nequivalent to:\n\nfemale shoe size (barleycorns) ≈ 3 × foot length (in) − 21.\n\nThere is also the \"common\" scale, where women's sizes are equal to men's sizes plus 1+1⁄2.\n\nChildren's shoes start from size zero, which is equivalent to 3+11⁄12 inches ( 11+3⁄4 barleycorns = 99.48 mm), and end at 13+1⁄2. Thus the formula for children's sizes in the US is\n\nchild shoe size (barleycorns) = 3 × last length (in) − 113⁄4\n\nequivalent to:\n\nchild shoe size (barleycorns) ≈ 3 × foot length (in) − 93⁄4.\n\nAlternatively, a Mondopoint-based scale running from K4 to K13 and then 1 to 7 is in use.[12] K4 to K9 are toddler sizes, K10 to K13 are pre-school and 1 to 7 are grade school sizes.\n\nBrannock Device\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Brannock device\n\nThe Brannock Device is a measuring instrument invented by Charles F. Brannock in 1925 and now found in many shoe stores. The recent formula used by the Brannock device assumes a foot length of 2 barleycorns less than the length of the last; thus, men's size 1 is equivalent to a last's length of 8+1⁄3 in (21.17 cm) and foot's length of 7+2⁄3 in (19.47 cm), and children's size 1 is equivalent to 4+1⁄4 in (10.8 cm) last's length and 3+7⁄12 in (9.1 cm) foot's length.[13][14]\n\nThe device also measures the length of the arch, or the distance between the heel and the ball (metatarsal head) of the foot. For this measurement, the device has a shorter scale at the instep of the foot with an indicator that slides into position. If this scale indicates a larger size, it is taken in place of the foot's length to ensure proper fitting.[7]\n\nFor children's sizes, additional wiggle room is added to allow for growth.[7]\n\nThe device also measures the width of the foot and assigns it designations of AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, EE, or EEE. The widths are 3⁄16 inches apart and differ by shoe length.[13]\n\nSome shoe stores and medical professionals use optical 3D surface scanners to precisely measure the length and width of both feet and recommend the appropriate shoe model and size.[15]\n\nContinental Europe\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Continental European system, the shoe size is the length of the last, expressed in Paris points or 2⁄3 cm (6.67 mm), for both sexes and for adults and children alike. The last is typically longer than the foot heel to toe length by 4⁄3 cm (13.33 mm) to 5⁄3 cm (16.67 mm), or 2 to 2+1⁄2 Paris points, so to determine the shoe size based on actual foot length one must add 2 Paris points.\n\nBecause a Paris point is 2⁄3 of a centimetre, a centimetre is 3⁄2 Paris points, and the formula is as follows:\n\nshoe size (Paris points) = 3⁄2 × last length (cm)\n\nequivalent to:\n\nshoe size (Paris points) ≈ (3⁄2 × foot length (cm)) + 2\n\nThe Continental European system is used in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,[16] Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain,[17] Sweden, Switzerland, and most other continental European countries. It is also used in Middle Eastern countries (such as Iran), Brazil—which uses the same method but subtracts 2 from the final result, in effect measuring foot size instead of last size[citation needed]—and, commonly, Hong Kong. The system is sometimes described as Stich size (from Pariser Stich, the German name for the Paris point), or Stichmaß size (from a German name of a micrometer for internal measurements).\n\nMondopoint\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mondopoint shoe length system is widely used in the sports industry to size athletic shoes, ski boots, skates, and pointe ballet shoes; it was also adopted as the primary shoe sizing system in the Soviet Union,[18] Russia,[19] East Germany, China,[20] Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, and as an optional system in the United Kingdom,[21] India,[22] Mexico, and European countries. The Mondopoint system is also used by NATO and other military services.\n\nThe Mondopoint system was introduced in the 1970s by International Standard ISO 2816:1973 \"Fundamental characteristics of a system of shoe sizing to be known as Mondopoint\" and ISO 3355:1975 \"Shoe sizes – System of length grading (for use in the Mondopoint system)\".[23] ISO 9407:2019, \"Shoe sizes—Mondopoint system of sizing and marking\",[24] is the current version of the standard.\n\nThe Mondopoint system is based on average foot length and foot width for which the shoe is suitable, measured in millimetres. The length of the foot is measured as horizontal distance between the perpendiculars in contact with the end of the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel. The width of the foot is measured as horizontal distance between vertical lines in contact with the first and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints. The perimeter of the foot is the length of the foot circumference, measured with a flexible tape at the same points as foot width. The origin of the grade is zero.\n\nThe labeling typically includes foot length, followed by an optional foot width: a shoe size of 280/110 indicates a foot length of 280 millimetres (11.0 in) and width of 110 millimetres (4.3 in). Other customary markings, such as EU, UK and US sizes, may also be used.\n\nBecause Mondopoint takes the foot width into account, it allows for better fitting than most other systems. A given shoe size shall fit every foot with indicated average measurements, and those differing by no more than a half-step of the corresponding interval grid. Standard foot lengths are defined with interval steps of 5 mm for casual footwear and steps of 7.5 mm for specialty (protective) footwear. The standard is maintained by ISO Technical Committee 137 \"Footwear sizing designations and marking systems.\"\n\nEast Asia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Japan, mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea, the Mondopoint system is used as defined by national standard Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) S 5037:1998 and its counterparts Guobiao (GB/T) 3293.1-1998, Chinese National Standard (CNS) 4800-S1093:2000 and Korean Standards Association (KS) M 6681:2007.\n\nFoot length and girth (foot circumference) are taken into account.[25] The foot length is indicated in centimetres; an increment of 5 mm is used.\n\nThe length is followed by designators for girth (A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE, EEEE, F, G), which are specified in an indexed table as foot circumference in millimetres for each given foot length; foot width is also included as supplemental information. There are different tables for men's, women's, and children's (less than 12 years of age) shoes. Not all designators are used for all genders and in all countries. For example, the largest girth for women in Taiwan is EEEE, whereas in Japan, it is F.\n\nThe foot length and width can also be indicated in millimetres, separated by a slash or a hyphen.\n\nSoviet Union (Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States)\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorically the Soviet Union used the European (Paris point) system, but the Mondopoint metric system was introduced in the 1980s by GOST 24382-80 \"Sizes of Sport Shoes\" (based on ISO 2816:1973) and GOST 11373-88 \"Shoe Sizes\" (based on ISO 3355:1975), and lately by GOST R 58149-2018 (based on ISO 9407:1991)\n\nStandard metric foot sizes can be converted to the nearest Paris point (2⁄3 cm) sizes using approximate conversion tables; shoes are marked with both foot length in millimetres, as for pointe ballet shoe sizes, and last length in European Paris point sizes (although such converted Stichmaß sizes may come 1⁄2 to 1 size smaller than comparable European-made adult footwear, and up to 1+1⁄2 sizes smaller for children's footwear, according to ISO 19407 shoe size definitions). Foot lengths are aligned to 5 mm intervals for sports and casual shoes, and 7.5 mm for protective/safety shoes.

The standard has also been adopted as Russian GOST R 57425-2017.\n\nThe standard is maintained by ISO/TC 137, which also developed ISO/TS 19408:2015 Footwear - Sizing - Vocabulary and terminology; in development are companion standards ISO/TS 19409 \"Footwear - Sizing - Measurement of last dimensions\" and ISO/TS 19410 \"Footwear - Sizing - Inshoe measurement\".\n\nShoe sizing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe adult shoe sizes are calculated from typical last length, which is converted from foot length in millimetres by adding an allowance of two shoe sizes:\n\nEUR shoe size = L + 2 × 6.66 6 ¯ 6.6 6 ¯ = 3 20 × L + 2 UK shoe size = L + 2 × 8.4 6 ¯ 8.4 6 ¯ − 25 = 3 25.4 × L − 23 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{EUR shoe size}}&={\\frac {L+2\\times {6.66{\\bar {6}}}}{6.6{\\bar {6}}}}={\\frac {3}{20}}\\times {L}+2\\\\[3pt]{\\text{UK shoe size}}&={\\frac {L+2\\times {8.4{\\bar {6}}}}{8.4{\\bar {6}}}}-25={\\frac {3}{25.4}}\\times {L}-23\\end{aligned}}}\n\nwhere L is foot length in millimetres.\n\nDirect conversion between adult UK, Continental European and Mondopoint shoe size systems is derived as follows:\n\nL = 20 3 × ( EUR shoe size − 2 ) = 25.4 3 × ( UK shoe size + 23 ) EUR shoe size = 1.27 × ( UK shoe size + 23 ) + 2 UK shoe size = EUR shoe size − 2 1.27 − 23 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}L&={\\frac {20}{3}}\\times \\left({\\text{EUR shoe size}}-2\\right)={\\frac {25.4}{3}}\\times \\left({\\text{UK shoe size}}+23\\right)\\\\[3pt]{\\text{EUR shoe size}}&={1.27\\times \\left({\\text{UK shoe size}}+23\\right)}+2\\\\[3pt]{\\text{UK shoe size}}&={\\frac {{\\text{EUR shoe size}}-2}{1.27}}-23\\end{aligned}}}\n\nUsing these formulas, the standard derives shoe size tables for adults and children, based on actual foot length measurement (insole) in millimetres. Typical last length ranges are also included (13 to 25 mm over foot length for adults, 8% greater than foot length plus 6 mm for children).\n\nExact foot lengths may contain repeating decimals because the formulas include division by 3; in practice, approximate interval steps of 6.67 mm and 8.47 mm are used, and sizes are rounded to either the nearest half size or closest matching Mondopoint size.\n\nAdults' shoe sizes Foot length Mondopoint EUR UK US (mm) (cm) (inch) 5.0 mm 7.5 mm 6.67 mm 8.46 mm 0.3 inch 210.0 210 210 33.5 211.6 8+1⁄3 2 3 213.3 21+1⁄3 34 215.0 215 215.9 8+1⁄2 2.5 3.5 216.6 21+2⁄3 34.5 217.5 217.5 220.0 22 220 35 220.13 8+2⁄3 3 4 223.3 22+1⁄3 35.5 224.36 8+5⁄6 3.5 4.5 225.0 225 225 226.6 22+2⁄3 36 228.6 9 4 5 230.0 23 230 36.5 232.5 232.5 232.83 9+1⁄6 4.5 5.5 233.3 23+1⁄3 37 235.0 235 236.6 23+2⁄3 37.5 237.06 9+1⁄3 5 6 240.0 24 240 240 38 241.3 9+1⁄2 5.5 6.5 243.3 24+1⁄3 38.5 245.0 245 245.53 9+2⁄3 6 7 246.6 24+2⁄3 39 247.5 247.5 249.76 9+5⁄6 6.5 7.5 250.0 25 250 39.5 253.3 25+1⁄3 40 254.0 10 7 8 255.0 255 255 256.6 25+2⁄3 40.5 258.23 10+1⁄6 7.5 8.5 260.0 26 260 41 262.46 10+1⁄3 8 9 262.5 262.5 263.3 26+1⁄3 41.5 265.0 265 266.6 26+2⁄3 42 266.7 10.5 8.5 9.5 270.0 27 270 270 42.5 270.93 10+2⁄3 9 10 273.3 27+1⁄3 43 275.0 275 275.16 10+5⁄6 9.5 10.5 276.6 27+2⁄3 43.5 277.5 277.5 279.4 11 10 11 280.0 28 280 44 283.3 28+1⁄3 44.5 283.63 11+1⁄6 10.5 11.5 285.0 285 285 286.6 28+2⁄3 45 287.86 11+1⁄3 11 12 290.0 29 290 45.5 292.1 11+1⁄2 11.5 12.5 292.5 292.5 293.3 29+1⁄3 46 295.0 295 296.3 11+2⁄3 12 13 296.6 29+2⁄3 46.5 300.0 30 300 300 47 300.56 11+5⁄6 12.5 13.5 303.3 30+1⁄3 47.5 304.8 12 13 14 305.0 305 306.6 30+2⁄3 48 307.5 307.5 309.03 12+1⁄6 13.5 14.5 310.0 31 310 48.5 313.26 12+1⁄3 14 15 313.3 31+1⁄3 49 315.0 315 315 316.6 31+2⁄3 49.5 317.5 12+1⁄2 14.5 15.5 320.0 32 320 50 321.73 12+2⁄3 15 16 mm cm inch 5.0 mm 7.5 mm 6.6 mm 8.46 mm 0.3 inch Foot length Mondopoint EUR UK US\n\nChildren's shoe sizes Foot length Mondopoint EUR UK US (mm) (cm) (inch) 5.0 mm 6.6 mm 8.46 mm 8.46 mm 118.53 4+2⁄3 19.5 3.5 4 120 12 4+3⁄4 120 20 4 4.5 123.3 12+1⁄3 4+5⁄6 125 20.5 4.5 5 126.6 12+2⁄3 5 21 5 5.5 130 13 5+1⁄12 130 21.5 5.5 133.3 13+1⁄3 5+1⁄4 22 6 136.6 13+2⁄3 5+1⁄3 135 22.5 6 6.5 139.7 14 5+1⁄2 140 23 6.5 141.816 5+7⁄12 7 143.3 14+1⁄3 5+2⁄3 23.5 7 7.5 146.6 14+2⁄3 5+3⁄4 145 24 7.5 150 15 5+11⁄12 150 24.5 8 153.3 15+1⁄3 6 155 25 8 8.5 156.6 15+2⁄3 6+1⁄6 25.5 8.5 9 160 16 6+1⁄3 160 26 9 163.3 16+1⁄3 6+5⁄12 26.5 9.5 166.6 16+2⁄3 6+7⁄12 165 27 9.5 10 169.3 17 6+2⁄3 170 27.5 10 10.5 173.3 17+1⁄3 6+5⁄6 28 10.5 11 176.6 17+2⁄3 7 175 28.5 11 11.5 179.916 18 7+1⁄12 180 29 11.5 183.3 18+1⁄3 7+1⁄4 29.5 12 186.6 18+2⁄3 7+1⁄3 185 30 12 12.5 190.5 19 7+1⁄2 190 30.5 12.5 13 192.616 19+1⁄3 7+7⁄12 31 13 13.5 196.6 19+2⁄3 7+3⁄4 195 31.5 13.5 1 200 20 7+5⁄6 200 32 0.5 1.5 203.3 20+1⁄3 8 205 32.5 1 2 206.6 20+2⁄3 33 1.5 2.5 210 21 210 33.5 2 3 (mm) (cm) (inch) 5.0 mm 6.67 mm 8.46 mm 8.46 mm Foot length Mondopoint EUR UK US\n\nSize marking\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is recommended to include size marking in each of the four sizing systems on the shoe label and on the package. The principal system used for manufacturing the shoe needs to be placed first and emphasized with a boldface.\n\nThe standard includes quick conversion tables for adult shoe size marking; they provide matching sizes for shoes marked in Mondopoint, European, and UK systems.
