        "text": "SPINNER Antenna Monitoring System - protect your broadcast infrastructure\n\nAll over the world radio and television broadcasters rely on their transmission systems operating unfailing around the clock, including patch panels, feeder cables and dipoles. The infrastructure itself is generally robust, but in the long run can be damaged and disturbed sustainable through RF overloads, incorrect installation or environmental influences (e.g.: UV radiation, ice, strong wind).\n\nSPINNER's Antenna Monitoring System (AMS) was developed to detect and pinpoint potential malfunction sources, like minimal arcing, compromised insulation or water ingress as early as possible. Thus, the whole broadcast transmission system can be prevented from greater damages, for example degraded RF-components, fire or even a complete off-air situation. All conspicuous events are continuously and reliable recorded in the AMS control unit and can be checked from anywhere via a user-friendly web interface, which also can be used to easily configurate the AMS system setup. A detected failure triggers an alarm both locally on warning LEDs and remotely via a SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) interface.\n\nAll AMS system components are engineered for indoor installation and can be integrated simple and fast, even in already existing broadcast sites.\n\nThe AMS band 2 U-link 1 5/8\" USL-D IL1 ensures optimal performance for signal transmission between transmitter and antenna in broadcast stations.\n\nThis U-Link (for SPINNER patch panels) provides an AMS detector. It is responsible for detecting arcing and water ingress. Minimum one AMS detector is required for each antenna line.\n\nOutstanding RF characteristics, best possible passive intermodulation and VSWR\n\nThe AMS band 2 U-link 1 5/8\" USL-D IL1 enables you to transmit high-frequency signals reliably and flawlessly with optimum protection of your sensitive equipment in a power range up to 20 kW @ 108 MHz.\n\nThe protection class is IP 50.\n\nIt supports the use of the following frequency bands : Band 2\n\nThe positive characteristics are briefly summarised: AMS Detector, to be mounted on SPINNER Patch Panels.\n\nBenefits of the AMS"
