Separate conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted for all drivers and in four diagnostic‐specific subgroups.\n\nResults\n\nThe study found a weak but statistically significant increased risk of all collisions being associated with a medical contact within 1 month before the collision, for all drivers (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.11) and for drivers with diabetes (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11).\n\nConclusion\n\nOlder drivers who have a collision are more likely to have been in contact with a physician shortly before the collision. These findings suggest that there might be an opportunity to detect medical conditions that put older drivers at higher risk of collision; however, further research is needed to assess the potential effectiveness and practical modalities of screening.\n\nBy 2030, one‐quarter of the population in the member countries of the Organization for Economic Co‐operation and Development will be aged 65 years and older.1 Ageing of populations in industrialized countries implies an increase in the proportion and number of older drivers. In the USA, for instance, there were 19.9 million older drivers in 2002, and their police‐reported collision involvements are expected to increase by 178% by 2030.2,3 The proportion of licensed drivers aged 65 years and over is expected to increase from 12.6% in 2000 to 22.1% in 2030 in Australia, 12.6% to 20.0% in the USA, 15.7% to 23.5% in the UK, 16.1% to 25.8% in France, and 12.6% to 22.8% in Canada.1 In 2001, in the province of Quebec, there were almost one million people aged 65 and over (13.3% of the population), of whom 32.5% had a driving license.4,5 In this province, there were 4065 severe vehicle collisions; 13% involved older drivers, who were also involved in 15% of lethal collisions.\n\nMany studies have assessed the relationships between age and the risk of collision. In 1995, Foley et al6 showed that age was not significantly associated with the risk of collision, but many other studies supported the suggestion that age was associated with being involved in a collision.3,7,8,9,10 Even if age were clearly associated with the risk of collision involvement, the association is not strong enough to predict which drivers will actually be at higher risk of being involved in a collision. Nevertheless, the increase with age of the prevalence of medical conditions that may impair driving ability could logically put older drivers at higher risk of collision.11,12,13 Many studies have shown that there is a high prevalence of cognitive impairment in older drivers involved in vehicle collisions; older drivers with dementia (Alzheimer's type) are also at higher risk of vehicle collision.14,15,16 Studies on driving resumption after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) found that a subject who suffered from severe TBI has a significantly higher risk of being involved in a road traffic collision.17,18 Many authors have suggested that these patients should be assessed for both mental and physical status before they resume driving.17,18\n\nConsequently, some countries, states and provinces have adopted standard or age‐based license renewal procedures,19,20,21 and adoption of similar policies is debated in some countries in Europe.22 These procedures are often simple administrative renewal of the license; in other places, applicants must perform tests such as vision tests or even road tests when specific medical conditions are present.19,20,21 In the USA, in‐person license renewal was related to a lower fatality rate among the oldest drivers, with the relative incidence decreased by 17%.23 However, other studies assessing mandatory evaluations targeting older drivers to prove their fitness to drive23,24 or education programs25 did not show a reduction in collisions or an increase in safety of older impaired drivers. The extension of similar interventions raises many issues. Beyond the validity of the tests, one key problem is to define the best opportunity for assessing ability to drive—for example, early diagnosis among all drivers in the general population or at the time of driver license renewal (systematic screening) or assessment during medical contacts for other reasons (case‐finding); another is to decide what would be the role of health professionals in the detection and reporting process.\n\nAssuming that any contact with a physician could be an opportunity to reach drivers with medical conditions associated with unsafe driving and thus detect drivers at risk of vehicle collisions, we performed a case‐crossover study to estimate the association between a medical contact and the risk of road vehicle collisions in a population of older drivers from the province of Quebec, Canada.\n\nMethods\n\nParticipants\n\nAll older drivers (licensed drivers aged 65 years and older) from the province of Quebec, Canada, with a valid driving license and involved in a vehicle collision from 1988 to 2000 were eligible for this study. Eligible drivers were identified using the databases of the Universal Quebec Automobile Insurance Agency (SAAQ) and the medical file of the Quebec Health Insurance Agency (RAMQ). The SAAQ is responsible for driver's license registration and recording reports of motor vehicle collisions. Its databases, available from 1985 to 2000, contain information on the driver (age, sex) and allow the validity of the driver's license to be checked. They also contain information on collisions (date, kind of road, environmental conditions, severity, and number of victims involved). We obtained medical data from the RAMQ, which is responsible for healthcare services for the province. These databases provide information on the practitioner (specialty, class, and establishment), on the act (code, date, and amount) and on the diagnosis (code). In all databases, drivers have a unique identifier and it was possible to cross‐check information on both collisions and medical visits.\n\nDesign\n\nThe case‐crossover design26 is appropriate when a brief exposure (medical contact) is associated with an increase in the risk of an acute event (the collision). Each driver is his/her own control, and therefore confounding due to fixed characteristics of the driver is eliminated.\n\nTime of collision\n\nBecause the RAMQ databases were only available from 1988, only collisions after 1988 were considered for inclusion. The time of collision (index date) was defined as the date of the first collision that occurred between 1988 and 2000. To provide equal availability of control time periods to all subjects (see the definition of control periods below), the index date was to be preceded by a collision‐free period of at least 12 months. In a first analysis, we considered all first collisions. As severe collisions are unlikely to be under‐reported,27 we also restricted a secondary analysis to severe collisions, defined as lethal collisions and collisions resulting in hospitalization for at least one person involved. We finally analyzed severe collisions adding material damages greater than $C500.\n\nHazard and control periods\n\nWe defined the risk period as the first 1‐month period preceding the index date. We used as control periods the four 1‐month periods preceding the risk period. We compared exposure to a medical contact during the risk period with exposure during control periods (fig 1 ).\n\nFigure 1 The case‐crossover design used in the study of the association between road vehicle collisions and recent medical contacts in older drivers from the province of Quebec, Canada (1988–2000).\n\nAssessment of exposure\n\nFor all periods, drivers who had been in contact, at least once, with a physician (hereafter called medical visit) were considered as exposed, whatever the diagnosis associated with the visit. Because the exact time of the visit is not reported in the databases, we excluded visits on the day of the collision, to identify only exposures that occurred strictly before the time of collision. Subgroups of drivers potentially at higher risk of unsafe driving14,15,16,17,18,28 were also defined, according to diagnostic codes of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD‐9), as: (1) patients with diabetes (ICD code 250.0–250.7 and 250.9–251.1); (2) patients with dementia (ICD code 290.0, 290.2–290.4, 331.0, and 331.2); (3) patients with psychotic disorders (ICD code 295.0–295.9, 297.1, 301.0, and 301.2); (4) patients with consequences of TBI (ICD code 800.1, 800.3, 801.1, 801.3, 803.1, 803.3, 804.1, 804.3, 850.0, 851.0, 851.1, and 907.0).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe used a conditional logistic regression to estimate the risk of vehicle collision in drivers who had been in contact with a physician before the collision.29 We conducted separate analyses for: all collisions, severe collisions only, and severe collisions or material damages greater than $C500. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated for all drivers and for drivers in the four diagnostic‐specific subgroups. As the numbers in the diagnostic‐specific subgroups of dementia, psychotic disorders, and consequences of brain injury were small in the group of severe collisions only (fig 2 ), the results are not presented in this paper. Finally, sensitivity analyses were carried out using different lengths and number of control periods. All the analyses were performed using SAS software V.9.\n\nFigure 2 Numbers of drivers and collisions included in the study. *Drivers excluded because aged less than 65 years (median 60, interquartile interval 57–62) and 52 subjects with coding errors; **slight collisions and collisions resulting in material damages equal to $C500 or less.\n\nResults\n\nStudy population\n\nThere were 434 389 collisions recorded by the SAAQ from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 2000 (fig 2 ). Almost 83% of drivers involved were men with a mean (SD) age of 66 (7.5) years. Most collisions resulted in material damages greater than $C500 (62.3%), 3% were considered to be severe collisions, and fewer than 1% were lethal.\n\nWe included in this analysis 111 699 vehicle collisions, including 3318 severe collisions, recorded from 1988 to 2000 (table 1 ). These collisions were most often located in business areas and resulted in material damages greater than $C500. The mean age of drivers involved was 71 (0.5) years, and 80% were men. These 111 699 collisions resulted in 33 051 victims, 86.5% of whom were slightly injured. The characteristics of collisions and drivers did not differ between the four diagnostic‐specific subgroups, except for the group of drivers with dementia, where the mean age was higher (74 (5.8) years). Detailed descriptive characteristics of drivers in diagnostic‐specific subgroups are available upon request to the authors.\n\nVariableAll collisions (n = 111 699)Severe collisions only* (n = 3318)Severe collisions or material damages > $C500 (n = 74 941)Collision severity Material damages (⩽$C500)18 364 (16.4)NANA Material damages (>$C500)71 623 (64.1)NA71623 (64.1) Injury without hospitalization18 394 (16.5)NANA At least one hospitalized victim2802 (2.5)2802 (2.5)2802 (2.5) Lethal516 (0.5)516 (0.5)516 (0.5)Victims involved All33 051 (100.0)6618 (100.0)6618 (100.0) Slightly injured28 590 (86.5)3849 (58.2)3849 (58.2) Seriously injured3849 (11.6)2157 (32.6)2157 (32.6) Dead612 (1.9)612 (9.2)612 (9.2)Sex (men)89 301 (80.0)2730 (82.3)60095 (80.2)Age Mean (SD)71 (5.0)72 (5.3)71 (5.0) Median (interquartile interval)70 (67–74)71 (68–75)70 (67–74)At least one medical contact Risk period60 556 (54.2)1780 (53.6)40 341 (53.8) Control periods58 219 (52.1)1746 (52.6)38 786 (51.7)\n\nMedical contacts\n\nFifty four percent of all drivers had at least one medical contact during the month preceding the collision (compared with 52% during at least one control period). The frequency of medical contact in the risk period was higher in drivers with dementia (66%) and drivers with diabetes (60%). For drivers with diabetes, the frequency of medical contact in the control periods was the same as in the risk period (60%), whereas drivers with dementia were most often exposed during the control periods (71%).\n\nThere was a weak but statistically significant increased risk of all collisions associated with a medical contact within 1 month before the collision, for all drivers and for drivers with diabetes (table 2 ). This weak and statistically significant association was also observed for severe collisions or material damages greater than $C500, for all drivers and drivers with diabetes. In the group of severe collisions only and in the other diagnostic‐specific subgroups, there was no significant association between the risk of collision and recent medical contacts.\n\nnOR (95% CI)*p ValueAll collisions All drivers111 6991.10 (1.08 to 1.11)<0.001 Drivers with diabetes16 1021.07 (1.03 to 1.11)<0.01 Driver with dementia4030.94 (0.73 to 1.21)0.62 Drivers with psychotic disorders3921.13 (0.88 to 1.47)0.33 Drivers with consequences of brain injury811.31 (0.76 to 2.33)0.33Severe collisions only† All drivers33181.05 (0.97 to 1.13)0.26 Drivers with diabetes4980.93 (0.75 to 1.15)0.51Severe collisions or material damages greater than $C500 All drivers74 9411.10 (1.08 to 1.12)<0.001 Drivers with diabetes10 6631.07 (1.03 to 1.12)<0.01 Driver with dementia2341.02 (0.73 to 1.42)0.92 Drivers with psychotic disorders2371.04 (0.75 to 1.44)0.70 Drivers with consequences of brain injury511.18 (0.60 to 2.34)0.63\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nChanging the length and number of study periods did not affect the results, except when a risk period of 2 months was matched with two control periods (table 3 ).

The same result was observed in the group of severe collisions or material damages greater than $C500, but not in the group including severe collisions only. Thus, older drivers who have a collision, especially those with diabetes, are more likely to have been in contact with a physician shortly before the collision.\n\nStrengths and potential limitations of the study\n\nThe case‐crossover design is efficient, as it does not require a control group and, as each case is his/her own control, it neutralizes possible confounding effects due to long‐lasting characteristics of the driver.26,30 One limitation of this design is the assumption that exposure to potential confounding due to unstable factors other than the exposure of interest is the same in both risk and control periods. For instance, we implicitly assumed that drivers had the same driving patterns in both the risk and control periods. If study subjects did not drive during the control periods, they were obviously not at risk of being involved in a vehicle collision, resulting in a possible overestimation of the association between medical contacts and the risk of collision. However, we think it more plausible that, if the risk of collision were related to aggravation of a medical condition, older drivers would be more likely to decrease their driving just before the collision. Indeed, drivers often adopt self‐regulation strategies whenever they are aware of their diminishing ability to drive,31,32 therefore would be more likely to stop driving during the risk period, resulting in an underestimation of the association.\n\nAs we did not know the exact time of collision, we excluded drivers who had been in contact with a physician on the day of the collision, to avoid misclassification related to the inclusion of medical contacts that actually occurred after the collision. By doing so, we probably also excluded drivers who had a medical contact just before the time of collision. The exclusion of these drivers, who were plausibly at higher risk of collision, may have led to an underestimation of the association between relevant medical contacts and the risk of collision.\n\nKey points\n\nAlthough older drivers seem to be at higher risk of collision per mile driven, many authors suggest that, instead of age itself, it is the increase with age of medical conditions that may impair driving that could put older drivers at higher risk of collision.\n\nRecent medical contacts (within 1 month of a collision) were significantly associated with an increased risk of collision for all drivers and drivers with diabetes.\n\nAny medical contact could represent an opportunity to detect medical conditions that put older drivers at higher risk of collision.\n\nFurther research is needed to assess the potential effectiveness and practical modalities of potential systematic screening programs to detect unsafe driving caused by medical conditions.\n\nIn a case‐crossover design, the total hazard period is defined as a time interval after a trigger, when the subjects experience an increased risk of the outcome.30 This hazard period may be divided into several periods of different degrees of excess risk. The risk period corresponds to the period when the incidence rate of the outcome is supposed to be increased. In our study, we assumed that the length of the risk period, in which a medical contact was hypothesized to be associated with a vehicle collision, was 1 month. The sensitivity analyses performed indicate that this length of risk period used with four matched control periods was a satisfactory design in this population of older drivers from Quebec. However, beyond the effect on statistical significance, it is obvious that a medical evaluation repeated monthly to detect drivers with at‐risk medical conditions would not be possible in practice.\n\nOne reason why some associations were not statistically significant is the lack of statistical power in three of the diagnostic‐specific subgroups. Indeed, numbers in the subgroups of dementia, psychotic disorders, and consequences of TBI were very small. Thus, a screening program targeted at a rare diagnostic‐specific subgroup to prevent a rare event, such as a collision, would necessarily have a weak effect.\n\nConclusion and implications for prevention\n\nOur findings suggest that there might be an opportunity, during routine medical visits, to detect medical conditions that put older drivers at higher risk of vehicle collision. However, a medical contact, defined as a medical visit, is only an indirect indicator of the opportunity to detect high‐risk older drivers. The actual detection implies that the medical visit should include an evaluation of driving competency, but reliable, valid, and applicable screening tools to predict actual ability to drive remain to be developed. Published studies suggest that only on‐road assessment tests are reliable and valid tools for determining driving competency.15,33,34,35,36,37 However, these tests are time‐consuming, expensive,22 and not necessarily appropriate for older drivers because they are based on driving skills sometimes over‐learned by the older driver.35,37 In the hypothesis that reliable and valid tests could be developed, other issues need to be resolved before a screening program could be implemented. Firstly, it needs to be decided whether the role of the physician would be based on a voluntary or mandatory reporting system; the level of mandate could dramatically modify the participation of physicians. Secondly, once unsafe driving is detected, it is not obvious what would be the most effective intervention to reduce the risk of collision. Different kinds of interventions, more or less restrictive, have been suggested in the literature, including educational or training programs, driving restrictions (geographic areas, time and day limitations), and complete ban on driving. Uncertainty about the effectiveness of these interventions is due to the negative effects potentially related to driving restrictions.35,38 In the specific case of older drivers, potential negative consequences of a reduction in driving opportunities could be an increase in dependency, isolation, and depression.37,39,40 Ultimately, a screening program should be recommended only if the positive effects outweigh the negative effects. This uncertainty is a likely reason why recent studies have recommended helping older drivers to maintain ability to drive safely rather than simply removing authorization to drive.25 Whatever the kind of intervention and context of implementation, the ability to demonstrate that a medical contact is associated with an increased risk of collision could thus represent an opportunity to detect drivers potentially at risk of collision, and remains an important step for policy making.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was done as part of the PhD thesis of the first author, directed by the last author.
