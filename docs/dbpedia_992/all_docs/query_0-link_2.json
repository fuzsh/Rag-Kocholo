That 10% quirk reduction is much more significant than is intuitive, because the way it's programmed into the game yields increasing returns (i.e. it's not \"faster cooldown,\" it's \"cooldown reduction.\") The only 'mech I can think of in the heavy weight class that runs those kind of numbers is the Crael, and that's at the cost of using spread weapons with much more limited range.\n\nEven an AC/2 build will drop from 18.26 DPS all the way down to 13.79. That's still a loss of 24.5% of your original DPS, though you can add an LPPC to help defray the loss at middle ranges. This is an overall nerf, but the numbers for long-range guns weren't so egregious - so it looks like they added the velocity nerf to help mitigate the long-range DPS loss.\n\nEdited by Void Angel, 18 May 2024 - 02:20 PM.\n\nPS: I calculated the /2-caliber autocannon using standard ACs because jam length doesn't reduce with weapon cooldown, so the comparisons will be off - I'm not even sure you'd get an overall dps increase with UACs, but of course you use UACs for the burst.\n\nSpheroid, on 18 May 2024 - 12:12 PM, said:\n\nWhat the hell is going in in Cauldron world?

The HAG heat is right back to where it was last year where more or less everyone agreed it was to good for the damage it dealt.\n\nsince then, clan DHS have been nerfed and HAGs have had a significant portion of their damage converted to splash. they can certainly still farm damage, but they're rather inefficient when it comes to actually killing things.\n\ncougurt, on 18 May 2024 - 02:12 PM, said:\n\nsince then, clan DHS have been nerfed and HAGs have had a significant portion of their damage converted to splash. they can certainly still farm damage, but they're rather inefficient when it comes to actually killing things.\n\nFrom what I understood about the HAGs if anything they needed more spread or PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO TWIST\n\nand i'm also totally against the clan heat sink nerf, It was stated on the cauldron discord to stop clan laservomit, well now IS has laservomit too so why? Also i still see clan laservomit... even more so beam laser vomit. and now PGi is adding heat disspation to every mech as if to compensate for that heat sink nerf, I dunno if it does or not.\n\nVoid Angel, on 18 May 2024 - 12:47 PM, said:\n\nPS: I calculated the /2-caliber autocannon using standard ACs because jam length doesn't reduce with weapon cooldown, so the comparisons will be off - I'm not even sure you'd get an overall dps increase with UACs, but of course you use UACs for the burst.\n\nwhat burst? uac2's have no burst IS uac5 has no burst. the only uacs that have burst are the clan UAC 5 10's and 20's\n\nor do you mean the doubletap?\n\nOn that note I think clan uac 5 should fire one bullet like the IS one.\n\nEdited by KursedVixen, 18 May 2024 - 03:12 PM.\n\nInnerSphereNews, on 17 May 2024 - 05:40 PM, said:\n\nWarhammer IIC\n\nWHM-IIC-BL:\n\nIncreased Jump Jet initial thrust to 100% (from 10%)\n\nWhile I appreciate any attempt to try to make the Bludgeon actually playable, the only thing that will make the mech worth while is more hard points.

I mean, swapping out pods is the Omnimech thing.\n\nKursedVixen, on 18 May 2024 - 02:39 PM, said:\n\nor do you mean the doubletap?\n\nYeah, the burst of fire, not the actual multi-round weapon characteristic. UACs of all calibers jam fairly quickly, so sustained DPS is harder to calculate for them. (But by no means should the Clan UAC/5 be two tons lighter, one slot smaller, slightly superior in range and have the same firing characteristics as the Inner Sphere's heavier, bulkier equivalent.)\n\nHAGs had a bit too much damage for their heat originally. Now that they've had time to collect game telemetry from the splash-damage nerf, it shouldn't be surprising that HAGs' heat efficiency has been restored.\n\n\"Warhammer IIC\n\nWHM-IIC-BL:\n\nIncreased Jump Jet initial thrust to 100% (from 10%)\n\nVictor\n\nAll Variants:\n\nIncreased Jump Jet initial thrust to 100% (from 15%)\n\nVTR-9B-Li (LGD):\n\nAdded 100% Jump Jet initial thrust\n\nAdded 15% Jump Jet burn time\n\nHighlander IIC\n\nAll Variants:\n\nIncreased Jump Jet initial thrust to 100% (from 15%)\"\n\n-initial trust from 15% to 100%....but why?
