One atmosphere of pressure will support a column of mercury that is 760*mm high. i.e. 1*atm-=760*mm*Hg ....And thus we can use the length measurement to represent pressure...We also realize that we must use \"Absolute temperature\", where \"Absolute Temperature\"-=\"\"^@C+273.15*K. So we solve for V_2=(P_1V_1)/T_1xxT_2/P_2, and clearly the RHS gives an answer with units of volume....... And so........ (771*mm*Hgxx2.44*L)/(295*K)xx(226.1*K)/(350*mm*Hg).... ~=4*L Of course, I could have reduced each pressure measurement to units of atm, but the increase in volume is consistent with a decrease in PRESSURE, and the moderate decrease in temperature. Do you see how the units cancel in the expression to give an answer in \"litres\", i.e. as required for a \"volume\"?",
