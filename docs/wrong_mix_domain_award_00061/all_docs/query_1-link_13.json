        "text": "(1893–1981). The American scientist Harold Clayton Urey won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1934 for his discovery of the heavy form of hydrogen known as deuterium. He was a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb and made fundamental contributions to a theory of the origin of the Earth and other planets that is now widely accepted.\n\nUrey was born on April 29, 1893, in Walkerton, Indiana. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1917 from Montana State University in Missoula. In Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1923 to 1924, Urey assisted in Niels Bohr’s basic research on the theory of atomic structure. Urey taught at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., from 1924 to 1929 and at Columbia University in New York City from 1929 to 1945. From 1945 to 1981 he held a series of professorships at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, the University of Chicago, and the University of California in San Diego.\n\nUrey’s deuterium research began in the 1920s when he distilled some liquid hydrogen, concentrating its deuterium form. In 1931 he and his associates announced their discovery of heavy water, composed of an atom of oxygen and two atoms of deuterium. He also separated radioactive isotopes of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, and examined their properties.\n\nDuring World War II he directed a research program at Columbia that became a vital part of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic energy program in the United States. Urey’s group provided the fundamental information for the separation of the fissionable isotope uranium-235 from the more abundant isotope uranium-238 and investigated methods for concentrating heavy hydrogen and separating boron isotopes.\n\nAfter the war his work with the heavy isotope oxygen-18 led him to devise methods for determining ocean temperatures as long as 180,000,000 years ago. This led him to study the relative abundances of the elements on Earth and to develop a theory of the origin of the elements and of their abundances in the sun and other stars.\n\nUrey theorized that the early atmosphere of the Earth was probably like the atmosphere now present on Jupiter—rich in ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. One of his students, Stanley Miller, working in his laboratory at the University of Chicago, demonstrated that when exposed to an energy source, such as ultraviolet radiation, these compounds and water might react to produce compounds essential for the formation of living matter (see extraterrestrial life).\n\nUrey suggested that the planets of the solar system may have developed from a gaseous disk rotating around the sun and that the disk, in combination with gases from the sun, may have broken into fragments and begun to condense. In 1952 he published his theory in The Planets: Their Origin and Development.\n\nIn 1960 Urey made recommendations in support of space exploration to determine the origin of the solar system and the possibility of life on other planets. He died on January 5, 1981, in La Jolla, California."
