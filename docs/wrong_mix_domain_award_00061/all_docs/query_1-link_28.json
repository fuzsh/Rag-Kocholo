        "text": "Whereas, the hydrogen molecule is rather a minor part of chemistry; and such a thing as the diatomic molecule OH, trying to explain what its electrons are doing, isn’t much concern to chemists. And just because it started with fragments of chemical molecules, I think it less popular at the time. This is my point of view about it. But you see at this time — now I was worrying about this in ‘29, when as you will remember, we discovered heavy hydrogen in the fall of ‘3l."
