        "text": "AKA Harold Clayton Urey\n\nBorn: 29-Apr-1893\n\nBirthplace: Walkerton, IN\n\nDied: 5-Jan-1981\n\nLocation of death: La Jolla, CA\n\nCause of death: Heart Failure\n\nRemains: Buried, Fairfield Cemetery, Fairfield Center, IN\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Atheist\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Chemist\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Discovered Deuterium\n\nAmerican chemist and physicist Harold C. Urey studied under Niels Bohr at Copenhagen, and is best known for his 1931 discovery of deuterium (heavy hydrogen, the isotope of hydrogen, with one proton and one neutron in its nucleus). He later said he had hoped that this discovery \"might have the practical value of, say, neon in neon signs\", but its principle use has proven to be in nuclear fusion reactions. Urey won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1934, and also isolated heavy isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, conducted respected research in astronomy, geology, and biology.\n\nDuring World War I he worked as for the Barrett Chemical Company, preparing toluene for the manufacture of trinitrotoluene (TNT). In 1930 he was co-author of Atoms, Molecules, and Quanta, the first widely-used English-language textbook on quantum mechanics and atomic and molecular systems. He was conducting classified research into development of atomic weapons even before World War II, and became a key figure in the Manhattan Project. Working with a team of scientists, he developed the Urey diffusion method to separate uranium-235 from uranium-238.\n\nWithin months of the atomic bombing of two cities in Japan, however, Urey authored \"I'm A Frightened Man\" in the widely-read Collier's magazine, outlining the dangers posed by this new technology. He became a more politically controversial figure in 1952, when he wrote a letter to President Harry S. Truman in support of his colleagues, Morton Sobell and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been accused of espionage. He later became active with the Union of Concerned Scientists, expressing concern about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the safety of nuclear power generators.\n\nThe Miller-Urey experiment, conducted by Urey's graduate student Stanley Miller in 1953, showed that numerous amino acids necessary for life can be easily produced by heating and agitating ammonia, hydrogen, methane, and water in an airtight container. This \"primordial soup\" experiment contributed to now-widely accepted theories explaining the origins of the Earth and other planets.\n\nThe son of a Christian minister, Urey became an atheist early in his adulthood. He is the namesake of an asteroid, a lunar crater, and the Urey Prize of the American Astronomical Society, awarded annually since 1984 to honor outstanding achievements in planetary science by a young scientist. He was outspoken in his belief that life on other planets is probable, and that humans cannot possibly be the most intelligent species in the universe.\n\nFather: Samuel Clayton Urey (Church of the Brethern minister, b. 1866, d. 1899)\n\nMother: Cora Rebecca Reinsehl Urey\n\nWife: Frieda Daum Urey (b. 1898, m. 12-Jun-1926, d. 1992, three daughters, one son)\n\nDaughter: Gertrude Elizabeth Urey Baranger\n\nDaughter: Frieda Rebecca Urey Brown\n\nDaughter: Mary Alice Urey Lorey (b. 2-Dec-1934)\n\nSon: John Clayton Urey (optometrist)\n\nHigh School: Kendallville High School, Kendallville, IN (1911)\n\nUniversity: Teacher's Certificate, Earlham College (1911)\n\nTeacher: at three public schools in Indiana and Montana (1911-14)\n\nUniversity: BS Biology, Montana State University (1917)\n\nTeacher: Chemistry, Montana State University (1919-21)\n\nUniversity: PhD Chemistry, University of California at Berkeley (1923)\n\nScholar: Theoretical Physics, University of Copenhagen (1923-24)\n\nTeacher: Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University (1924-29)\n\nTeacher: Chemistry, Columbia University (1929-34)\n\nProfessor: Chemistry, Columbia University (1934-45)\n\nProfessor: Chemistry, Enrico Fermi Institute, University of Chicago (1945-52)\n\nProfessor: Ryerson Professor of Chemistry, University of Chicago (1952-58)\n\nProfessor: Chemistry, Oxford University (1956-57)\n\nProfessor: Chemistry, University of California at San Diego (1958-70, emeritus 1970-81)\n\nTeacher: Scrimps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA (1958-81)\n\nHoneywell Research Chemist, Barrett Chemical Company (1917-19)\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science\n\nAmerican Association of University Professors\n\nAmerican Astronautical Society Fellow\n\nAmerican Astronomical Society\n\nAmerican Chemical Society\n\nAmerican Geophysical Union Honorary Fellow\n\nAmerican Institute of Chemists Honorary\n\nAmerican Philosophical Society 1935\n\nAmerican Physical Society\n\nArgonne National Laboratory 1946-58\n\nBritish Chemical Society Foreign Member\n\nCosmos Club\n\nFederation of American Scientists Life Member\n\nFranklin Institute Honorary\n\nGeological Society of America\n\nInternational Association of Geochimica and Cosmochimica\n\nInternational Astronautical Academy\n\nInternational Platform Association\n\nMellon Institute Honorary\n\nMeteoritical Society Fellow\n\nNational Academy of Sciences\n\nPhi Beta Kappa Society\n\nRoyal Astronomical Society Foreign Member\n\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain Foreign Member\n\nRoyal Society Foreign Member\n\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences Foreign Member\n\nUnion of Concerned Scientists\n\nJournal of Chemical Physics Editor, 1933-40\n\nManhattan Project 1940-45\n\nNobel Prize for Chemistry 1934\n\nWillard Gibbs Medal 1934\n\nDavy Medal 1940\n\nBenjamin Franklin Medal 1943 (by the Franklin Institute)\n\nCongressional Order of Merit 1946\n\nNational Medal of Science 1964\n\nRoyal Astronomical Society Gold Medal 1966\n\nArthur L.
