This is just one of the questions that fascinated the scientist Harold Urey, and it was in his laboratory that scientists reproduced for the first time the conditions of the ancient earth and found a way that the chemicals of life might have been formed there. Today, Dr. Urey is examining rocks brought back by astronauts from the moon.\n\nDr. Urey has worked in many fields—chemistry, physics, biology and astronomy—always eager to learn and grow. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of deuterium, a heavy kind of hydrogen.\n\nThe story of Dr. Harold Urey's fascinating life and work is told here with the help of Dr. Urey himself, who provided the authors with information and photographs.\n\nFrom the dust jacket"
