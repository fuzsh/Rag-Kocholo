Pieces broken off upper and lower blank corners of front wrapper. Torn along top 1/2\" of spine, with small piece broken off upper gutter of front wrapper. Piece broken off upper corner of rear wrapper. Small piece broken off upper blank corner of first leaf (1/2). I have included a few photos showing the chipping. Despite these chips, I still consider this a Good copy. But you decide for yourself. I can email more photos, as well as a .pdf scan of front and rear wrappers. Just ask me for them. First Edition. SIGNED BY HAROLD C. UREY (on front wrapper). Offprint of Harold C. Urey's Nobel Lecture, delivered February 16, 1935. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1934 was awarded to Harold Clayton Urey \"for his discovery of heavy hydrogen.\" \"Elements occur as various isotopes, variations of elements with different atomic weights. Harold Urey wondered if the smallest atom, hydrogen, had different isotopes, and he calculated how they ought to be constituted if that were the case. By distilling liquid hydrogen, a hydrogen isotope was extracted in 1932 that was twice as heavy as regular hydrogen. It was called deuterium. Water that contains deuterium, so-called heavy water, proved to have other chemical properties that differed from regular water, and in various ways deuterium became significant in nuclear technology\" (Nobel Prize website). - \"Some Thermodynamic Properties of Hydrogen and Deuterium.
