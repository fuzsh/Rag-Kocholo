        "text": "Jill Spalding attended the Spence School in New York, Miss Porter’s School in Farmington, Ct., Harvard and Sarah Lawrence. Every summer she accompanied her mother and step-father, the “violinist’s violinist” Nathan Milstein, on tour through Europe and briefly attended school in Gstaad, Switzerland.\n\nShe apprenticed in London then worked as a reader for Gallimard in Paris where she collaborated on a book about Joachim Patinir for Robert Laffont and undertook the first draft of her 3-volume History of Luxury. After a stint with Venture Magazine, writing for Frank Zachary about such as Karim Aga Khan (photos by Slim Aarons), she moved to London to succeed Joan Didion as Literary Editor, then Features Editor, of British Vogue under the formidable Beatrix Miller, where she worked with Cecil Beaton, Norman Parkinson, David Bailey, Barry Lattigan. She pulled in the first Nobel Laureates to write for Vogue (Sir Peter Medawar and Karl Popper), and published such new talents as Tom Wolfe, Michael Crichton and Christy Brown. After Teddy Goldsmith tipped her off to the eroding environment, she proposed a breakthrough feature on ecology, a word then so foreign even Miss Miller had to look it up and, after four days in Morges, Switzerland, head of the IUCN, published 16 pages in the now famous “blue issue” alerting Vogue readers to the depletion of wildlife and resources. As a consequence, Vogue UK stopped advertising wild fur while she teamed up with the founders of World Wildlife, delivering change collected from the Panda placed outside her flat to their fledgling headquarters.\n\nJill then married award-winning filmmaker Philip Spalding, and moved with him and their two sons to Los Angeles where she worked for the next 17 years for UK, US and Australian Vogues, writing on art, nutrition, Hollywood and profiling such as Fidel Castro, Nancy Reagan, Hunter Thompson, Timothy Leary. Under her editorship, Vogue was among the first to publish the work of the young Robert Mapplethorpe, Herb Ritts, David Hockney, and first to feature John Travolta and Frank Gehry.\n\nThe Spalding residence at 216 South Westgate, former home of Greta Garbo, became known for its soup nights, the first Monday of each month, when an extended list of such as Olivia Newton John, David Hockney, Ed Moses, Bill Al Bengston, Ed Ruscha, Peter Alexander, Rachel Ward, Elizabeth Taylor, Shakira and Michael Caine, David Bowie, James Woods, Joan Collins…dropped by for a soup, salad and brownies in the garden – all who confirmed by the previous Saturday were welcome between seven and ten. Between articles Jill wrote two books; the best-seller Only the Best and Blythe Spirits.\n\nWhen the boys set off for Exeter and Hotchkiss she moved to New York, wrote a column for Frank Magazine and restaurant reviews for Vogue Entertaining and Travel. She launched an internet radio show for PS1-MOMA on WPS1.org, called Miami on My Mind, which focusses on the Florida art scene. She also resumed work on The History of Luxury, reduced by the exigencies of publishing to one volume, which she hopes to publish this spring. Her sons Seth and Matthew are both in San Francisco; Seth is married to Barbara Spalding and have three children, Eve, Luke, and Catherine, and is with the noted hedge fund, Passport Capital. Matthew has earned his PHD in psychology and is exploring the impact of eastern thought on health and well-being."
