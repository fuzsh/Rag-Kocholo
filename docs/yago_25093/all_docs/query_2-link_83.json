        "text": "Beloved mother, grandmother, and great grandmother passed away peacefully in Saginaw, Michigan, on Sunday, February 18th, 2024, at the age of 82. Karen was born on January 29th, 1942, in Chelsea, Michigan, to the late Charles & Mary (Wale) Loomis, and was a 1960 graduate of St. Louis High School. After graduating, Karen met Thomas Spaulding through a “wild” group of friends and the couple would soon be inseparable. They married on February 4th, 1961, and spent nearly 60 years together. He preceded her in death on December 20th, 2020. Many years after graduating, Karen earned a certificate from Delta College and worked as a medical transcriptionist for numerous places throughout the greater Saginaw and Grayling areas, retiring after many years of hard work and attention to detail before moving to Higgins Lake with Thomas. She was also a prominent “Avon lady” in the area, a member of the Eastern Stars, and a parishioner in the Methodist church. In her free time, Karen was an avid reader, making quite a collection of romance and mystery novels. She also enjoyed sewing and she maintained quite the vinyl collection, of which Barbara Streisand and Johnny Mathis were her favorites. Karen was a great cook and baker, renowned for her famous potato salad and banana cake. She kept the company of many animals throughout the years, especially her beloved cats, and was the happy grandmother to many “fur babies.” Karen loved wintering in Gulf Shores, Alabama, with Thomas, and the couple treasured the friendships of many people met throughout the years. She is remembered as being a kind, loving, and outgoing woman who always had a smile on her face.\n\nKaren is survived by children Mike (Terri) Spaulding, Julie Spaulding, and Mary Spaulding; grandchildren Jason (Skylar) Spaulding, Bryan Spaulding, and Jakob (Kat) Spaulding; and great grandchildren Kathryn Spaulding and Charlotte Veda Spaulding; as well as many nieces, nephews, other family members, countless friends, and treasured “fur babies.”\n\nKaren was preceded in death by her loving husband Thomas, brother Phillip Loomis, stepmother Peg Loomis, and many beloved aunts and uncles."
