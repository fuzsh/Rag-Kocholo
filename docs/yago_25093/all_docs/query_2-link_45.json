        "text": "It's with great sadness and broken hearts that we must announce the passing of PHIL SPALDING\n\nPhil passed away at home on Sunday, 5th February 2023.\n\nPhil was, and will forever be, a loving son, brother, dad, husband and a very proud grandad.\n\nDuring his life, Phil became a hugely talented and extremely prolific bass player, recording and performing around the world with many established artists and on countless hit records.\n\nPhil never underestimated or forget his fans and believed the fans had made it all possible. He always gave them his time, generously.\n\nIt's incredible to see the outpouring of love on social media for a man who touched so many people's lives, all over the world, not only through his music but also through his extensive charity work.\n\nWe'd like to thank everyone for the many warm messages of sympathy and condolence we've already received, and for your kind support, love and respect for a man who was definitely one of a kind!\n\nPlease continue to share your memories of Phil on social media: it's a great source of comfort and strength to us all at this sad and difficult time.\n\nAnd please continue to play Phil's music!\n\nKeep Rockin'!\n\nLots of love to you all - Helen Spalding"
