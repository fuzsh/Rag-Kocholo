        "text": "American actor (born 1960)\n\nGrant Aleksander (born Grant Aleksander Kunkowski; August 6, 1960)[1] is an American actor. He is best known for playing the role of Phillip Spaulding on the CBS Daytime soap opera Guiding Light, off and on from 1982 until the show's cancellation in 2009. He received a Soap Opera Digest Award and four Daytime Emmy Award nominations for his role on Guiding Light.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAleksander was born in Baltimore, Maryland and raised in Timonium.[2] He is the youngest of three sons.[1] He attended McDonogh School, where he played football. He became interested in acting after a drama teacher encouraged him to try out for a school play.[3] After high school, he enrolled at Washington and Lee University, where he starred in productions of The Owl and the Pussycat, The Glass Menagerie, The Crucible, and Hamlet. He also appeared on stage in Baltimore, starring in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. He left Washington and Lee to study at New York University and the Circle in the Square Theatre.[4] He eventually returned to Washington and Lee, earning his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Theatre in 2012.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter moving to New York, Aleksander worked as a waiter and tried modeling. He appeared in an ABC Afterschool Special, A Very Delicate Matter, in 1982.[3] He landed his big break when he was cast as Phillip Spaulding on Guiding Light. He initially played the role from 1982 to 1984, before leaving to pursue other opportunities.[2]\n\nAleksander landed guest starring roles on Hardcastle and McCormick, Who's the Boss?, and The Fall Guy. He appeared in the TV movie Dark Mansions and the film Tough Guys. Returning to soaps, he had a brief stint as DJ Phillips on Capitol in 1986.[3][6]\n\nHe returned to Guiding Light as Phillip Spaulding in 1986 and stayed until early 1991.[7] He decided to leave due to burn out from the show's fast paced schedule, as well as grief from the recent deaths of his parents.[2] In 1993, Aleksander joined the cast of the ABC Daytime soap opera All My Children as Alec McIntyre.[8] He stayed with AMC until 1996.\n\nAleksander returned to Guiding Light in 1996 and continued playing the role of Phillip until 2004, when he was abruptly dismissed from the show.[9] Media reports speculated on a number of possible reasons, including his high salary, and allegations that Aleksander was temperamental or had been feuding with the actress who portrayed his love interest. Aleksander said the dismissal was storyline dictated.[10]\n\nAfter being killed off, it was revealed in May 2006 that Phillip Spaulding was still alive. However, the character didn't appear on camera again until Aleksander returned in February 2009.[11] He stayed with Guiding Light until its final episodes in September 2009.\n\nDuring his time away from Guiding Light, Aleksander directed episodes of As the World Turns.[11] In 2006, he appeared in the film The Big Bad Swim, co-starring with Paget Brewster.[12] He also had a role in Fields of Freedom, a historical film about the battle of Gettysburg.[10] In 2008, he guest starred on Life on Mars, playing a soap opera doctor.[13]\n\nAleksander joined the cast of the web series Tainted Dreams in 2013, playing Adam Clark.[14] In late 2014, he returned to Washington and Lee University as a Guest Artist in the first \"Dick Sessoms Honorary Production\" of George Bernard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's Profession.[15] Aleksander starred in Mary, Mary at Cape May Stage in 2015.[16] He also appeared Off Broadway in Perfect Crime in May and June 2019.[17]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAleksander met his wife, attorney Sherry Ramsey, when they were cast in a play together as students at Washington and Lee University.[2] They were married on September 19, 1987.[3]\n\nAleksander and his wife have rescued many animals and are supporters of PETA.[2]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1986 Tough Guys Bartender at Mickey's 2006 The Big Bad Swim Paul Pierson Fields of Freedom\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1982 ABC Afterschool Specials Larry Milligan Episode: \"A Very Delicate Matter\" 1982–2009 Guiding Light Phillip Spaulding Contract role 1985 Who's the Boss?
