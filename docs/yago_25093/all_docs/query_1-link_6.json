        "text": "For tv_universe\n\nTo the casual observer, Springfield is an ideal place to live but to those who residents who are aware of the Spauldings' dicier dealings it can also be a dangerous place.\n\nIn a town like Springfield, it's hard for anyone to keep any secrets. Olivia Spencer and Natalia Rivera have a complicated history. At first bitter rivals, then reluctant acquaintances, then fast friends and finally lovers. Things aren't as easy as they seem. At various times Olivia and Natalia were both involved with members of Springfield's most influential and nefarious family, the Spauldings. They have to navigate their feelings for each other while trying to make a mostly-honest living.\n\n(So, basically, it went from a Soap Opera with a lesbian subplot, it's now half mob drama and lesbian drama)\n\nNatalia was a down on her luck kid with a kid of her own once upon a time. Using her deceptively naive angelic good looks she was employed by the Spaulding family to locate rivals, snitches or double crossers and report back. These days she's trying to lead a much less eventful life and the Spauldings transferred her to the accounting department to work with Olivia Spencer and eventually left with her also. In the third season, Natalia is fiercely loyal to Olivia and has unexplored feelings toward her which she attempts to tamp down by dating Frank.\n\n**\n\nOlivia was ambitious and ended up getting entangled in the Spaulding family. At different times she was involved with patriarch Alan Spaulding and eventually married Phillip Spaulding. She worked in many different areas before starting in and finally taking over the accounting department, working her magic with the legitimate money and the less than legitimate money. When she divorced Phillip she managed to end up with a hefty settlement which gave her the financial means to purchase and revive The Beacon, a hotel and business center. She manages to not incur the wrath of the Spauldings for leaving because she's the mother to the oldest grandchild, Emma. Olivia is in love with Natalia in season three but encourages her to be with Frank because she thinks she's being selfless.\n\n**\n\nEmma is twelve and is quite precocious. She knows and understands how the town is run despite the fact that her mother, Olivia, would rather keep her out of it. Both Phillip and Alan, however, intend for her to some day take over the family business. Emma is also the one who understands and knows that Olivia and Natalia are meant to be together.\n\nDoris is the mayor of Springfield and personally runs the town cleanly even though she judiciously looks the other way on the Spauldings' business. She becomes close with Olivia when they bond over their mutual attraction to women that they're both striving to conceal. Doris is very vocal with Olivia that she needs to fight for Natalia.\n\n**\n\nRafe is Natalia's son and has been in juvie for three years but has recently come back to town. Rafe quickly falls in with the Spauldings, as any eager young criminal is wont to do. He distrusts Olivia immensely because he doesn't understand why the Spauldings let her carry on after leaving the fold and worries that she'll get his mother hurt.\n\n**\n\nAva is Olivia's oldest daughter. Olivia had gotten pregnant in high school and put the baby up for adoption. Ava found her after she was eighteen and moved to town to be close to her biological mother... or so she says. Is she who she says she is or could she be working for the Spauldings' rivals... or worse, an undercover cop digging up everyone's dirt?\n\nFrank seems to be the least corruptable resident in Springfield. Natalia is attracted to that aspect of him because she feels like she could have a semblance of a normal life with him which is why she agrees to marry him. Despite really wanting to be happy with him she leaves him at the altar because she realizes she can't live a lie. Frank spirals into a depression and gets himself into hot water with the Spauldings.\n\n**\n\nJosh and his brother Billy are long time enforcers for the Spaulding family. Josh is one of Olivia's oldest and closest friends. Predominantly bros, he and Olivia occasionally engage in a friends with benefits situation. She eventually confides in him her feelings for Natalia and joins Doris in encouraging her to go for it.\n\n**\n\nBlake is the local real estate agent who is tuned into everything going on in town, partaking in and spreading most of the gossip. Olivia and Natalia's feelings for each other manage to go under Blake's raydar because she chalks it up to friend drama when Olivia gets drunk and makes a scene at Natalia's bridal shower. When Olivia and Natalia finally get together they do everything they can to stay away from Blake. Ava gets a job working for Blake in the real estate office.\n\nPHILLIP SPAULDING Til Schweiger\n\nALAN SPAULDING Jeff Bridges\n\nBUZZ COOPER Jason Bateman\n\nBILLY LEWIS James Woods"
