        "text": "When I was talking about the ten “old friends” I’d like to see on Guiding Light the other day, I enjoyed the comments that followed and the dialogue about those old favorites. India was at the top of my list.\n\nAs September gets closer, I’ll definitely be strolling down Springfield’s memory lane, and there’s one actor in particular who I thought merited an honorable mention. He was, as the title of this post says, the right guy at the wrong time.\n\nI’m talking about John Bolger, who played Phillip Spaulding for two years, from 1985 until Grant Aleksander’s return in late 1986.\n\nOf course, Aleksander is the quintessential Phillip, and it’s hard for any of us to see anyone in the role but him. (It’s why the show wisely didn’t recast when Aleksander was either unable or unwilling to return over the last few years.)\n\nI think many Guiding Light fans shared the same feeling I had about Bolger – he wasn’t quite Phillip, but we liked him all the same. He’s an engaging actor and he did great, solid work at Guiding Light. I often wish he’d have been cast as another character on GL.\n\nBolger’s Phillip led to a slightly different Spaulding family during that time: Mary Kay Adams and Aleksander had great chemistry as India and Phillip; Bolger and Adams had glorious chemistry.\n\nBolger’s Phillip came across as more patrician – a younger Frasier Crane, if you will – and the scenes between India, Phillip, and Beverlee McKinsey’s Alexandra were often filled with Noel Coward-esque dialogue.\n\nI’m reminded how different Bolger was when I saw this video on YouTube. I’d forgotten all about it.\n\nIt’s quite un-Spaulding behavior from Phillip and Alexandra, as well as Reva being……well, Reva. (Red dress sold separately.)\n\nThe 80s – gotta love ’em!\n\nI have to admit, I’ve always had a crush on John; he’s a handsome man with movie-star, leading man looks. But he’s a great actor, as well. He was phenomenal in Parting Glances, one of the best and earliest movies to take a look at gay men living together and loving each other.\n\nAnd he’s done great work at One Life to Live and Another World, where he was also woefully underused. He’s been on tour with Dirty Dancing for the last several months, and he’s slated to make more appearances on General Hospital this summer.\n\nNot only will we get to see him on screen (as Mayor Garrett Floyd) but we’ll also get to see the much-missed, much loved Emmy winner Martha Byrne as Mayor Floyd’s wife Andrea. I may actually have to watch these scenes on GH. (Yes, the sound you heard was hell freezing over!)"
