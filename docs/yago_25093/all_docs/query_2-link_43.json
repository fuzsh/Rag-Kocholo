        "text": "LEWISTON — Phillip Spaulding, 70, formerly of Cumberland, New Gloucester, Lewiston and Barre, Vt. died Jan. 22 at the Marshwood Nursing Care Center in Lewiston following a massive stroke. A true sports fan until the end, he died just after kick off on Sunday, Jan. 22 while watching the New England Patriots playoff game on TV.\n\nSpaulding was an avid outdoorsman and suffered his first stroke in 2006 shortly after bagging his first elk while hunting with friends in Dillon, Mont. While being airlifted back to Maine he asked if the EMTs would bring the elk along with them on the plane. His favorite place to hunt was Eustis, and he could be frequently found telling stories at the Trail’s End Lounge with a whiskey in hand or at New Gloucester’s King & Bartlett Fish and Game Club where he enjoyed duck and deer hunting. He was a member of Ducks Unlimited, the Wild Turkey Federation, Operation Game Thief and the Elks Lodge.\n\nSpaulding was born in Barre, Vt. and graduated from the University of Vermont before moving to Maine to begin a career as a certified public accountant with Baker and Adam, which later became Peat, Marwick and Mitchell. He also worked for Brooks and Albin before opening his own practice. He shared an office with friend and fellow accountant Ron Taliento in Westbrook and served both corporate and individual clients for many decades.\n\nHe was married twice, is a father of four and a grandfather to five. His family also included an extended circle of friends far and wide. Among these many friends, the family wishes to express special gratitude to Jim Brownrigg, Dave Landry, Ron and Mary Taliento and Fred Thurston for continuing to be there for Spaulding throughout a series of increasingly debilitating strokes over the last five and a half years.\n\nSpaulding is survived by his sister Linda Dutcher and her husband John; children Brian Spaulding and his wife Carolyn, Jana Spaulding, Stephanie Rogers and her husband Chris and Elizabeth Ray and her husband Tony; grandchildren Nick and Ben Rogers, Calvin and Charlotte Ray and Sophia Spaulding; former wives Dotty Spaulding and Mimi Spaulding; his companion in recent years Diane Jambird; and several nieces, nephews, cousins, friends and former clients who will remember him for his generous spirit and fun-loving nature.\n\nAt his request, there will be not funeral or memorial service and his ashes will be scattered in the spring by his family.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Spaulding’s memory may be made to Maine Operation Game Thief, P.O. Box 2684, Augusta, ME 04338.\n\nSidebar Elements\n\nSpaulding"
