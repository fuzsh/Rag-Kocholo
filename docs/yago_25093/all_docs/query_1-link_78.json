        "text": "Tragically, Reva was presumed dead after, suffering from postpartum depression, she drove her car into the Florida waters. Harley Davidson Cooper, Marah and Shayne’s nanny, helped a devastated Josh through his grief. Surprisingly, Josh fell for Reva-like Harley, but he put their relationship on hold to find out if Reva was really alive in Italy.\n\nThe Land of Wishes, Hopes, and Dreams\n\nJosh Lewis returned to Springfield — sans Reva — for a family wedding. He was hospitalized after a fire broke out on Fifth Street and fell for his nurse, Annie Dutton. Josh and Annie fell in love and planned to be married.\n\nHello, Reva… and Dolly\n\nJosh and Annie were both visited by a woman they believed to be Reva. In reality, it was an apparition that a comatose Reva was somehow generating. Josh learned Reva was alive for real right after marrying Annie. He and Reva had a reunion on the Spaulding jet that quickly disintegrated into a blame game — Josh didn’t know Reva had had amnesia; Reva recalled Josh would often judge her mistakes.\n\nBelieving her kids preferred Annie, Reva made the choice to marry Buzz (it didn’t last) so Josh would stay with Annie. But the younger woman saw that Josh still loved Reva. She had a break from reality and after failing to frame Reva for her unborn baby’s death, Annie kidnapped Reva and tried to kill her by trapping her on a pilotless plane.\n\nJosh believed Reva had died. He couldn’t live without her so he had he cloned! Then, the real Reva, who had survived, came home. Finding their way back to each other, Josh and Reva wed… again but ‘always’ wasn’t in the cards.\n\nOlivia\n\nReva discovered she’d once lived as a woman named Catherine, who wed into royalty on the island of San Cristobel during her lost years. Josh, realizing Reva had unresolved feelings for Richard, the man who fathered her son, Jonathan, let her go.\n\nHe then took up with Olivia Spencer and asked Reva for a divorce. There were plenty of sparks between them, but Josh and Olivia’s relationship fell apart after she had an affair with Alan. Also, Josh realized something that viewers always knew — he was still in love with Reva. They were married for a third time — heading for a Guiding Light record!\n\nAlas, Josh became obsessed with turning Shayne into a pro baseball player, leading to disharmony in his and Reva’s marriage. Things got worse after he collided his car with Shayne’s, derailing his baseball career in the process.\n\nNext, Josh faced a rival for Reva in Jeffrey O’Neill, a double for the late Richard. But Josh stood by Reva when her angry son Jonathan came to Springfield. Reva’s restlessness and Josh reconnecting with Olivia led to yet another divorce. Josh and Reva signed the papers — and then tore them up! They knew they were destined to be together.\n\nThe Next Best Thing for Josh Lewis\n\nReva pushed Josh away because she was diagnosed with cancer and she didn’t want to burden him. Josh moved on to someone new. After years of seeing Reva having close relationships with his father and brother, Josh fell for Cassie, Reva’s sister. He and Reva split, but he raced to her side just in time to witness Reva’s miraculous recovery. Still, Josh chose to propose marriage to Cassie, Reva’s sister, who said yes.\n\nAlways, Bud\n\nJosh turned not to Cassie, but to Reva, whom he was still legally wed after he was imprisoned for shooting Alan. They even made love during a conjugal visit. Josh was freed when Alan’s real shooter confessed, yet still wed Cassie. But it wasn’t legal as his divorce papers from Reva weren’t correctly filed.\n\nJosh and Cassie faced conflict over her demon-like son, Will, and Josh’s unresolved feelings for Reva and split. Josh asked Reva to meet him by the lighthouse in a year if she wanted a future together. Twelve months later, Reva showed up. Together, Reva, her son Colin (with Jeffrey), and Josh rode off into the sunset together to share a happy future – always — as Guiding Light left the airwaves.\n\nVideo Credit: Josh Hawkins"
