        "text": "Paul Hollywood is reportedly set to marry Melissa Spalding at the same resort in Cyprus where he married his ex-wife.\n\nThe 57-year-old TV star has been dating the pub landlady for the last three years, and he's now preparing to tie the knot after he was recently spotted at the Anassa Hotel in Cyprus.\n\nA source told The Sun newspaper: \"People privately think it’s odd he’s ­marrying here because he has so many memories of his first wife connected to the hotel.\n\n\"He gets treated like royalty by the owners, but what must Melissa think? She’s following in the same footsteps where he had another woman on his arm.\"\n\nPaul - who is best known for appearing on 'The Great British Bake Off' - actually lived in Cyprus during the 1990s and he even worked at the hotel as the head baker.\n\nThe TV star was living in the country when he met his ex-wife Alexandra. The couple tied the knot in 1998 but split in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul reportedly proposed to Melissa over Easter.\n\nHowever, the TV presenter made a concerted effort to keep the news quiet for some time.\n\nA source previously told The Sun newspaper: \"Paul proposed some months ago, but they have been keeping it very quiet since then. It’s only in the past month that she has begun wearing her engagement ring out in public, and sharing their news with friends.\"\n\nDespite this, the couple didn't have any plans to tie the knot at the time.\n\nThe source insisted: \"There are no wedding plans in place yet.\""
