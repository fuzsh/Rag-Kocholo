        "text": "The second of the three Valentine Weddings tonight is Billip – Beth (Elizabeth Ann) Raines and Phillip (Phillip Granville) Spaulding who were married Feb. 14, 1991.\n\nThe photo to the left is the three generations photo from the wedding, Lizzie, Lillian, and Beth. This was the first and only on screen Billip wedding although they are together and engaged many other times. To get to this stage both Phillip and Beth had to come back from the “dead.” Beth had disappeared and Alan, believing she really was dead, faked evidence so Phillip would go on. Beth reemerged years later as an amnesiac, hysterically mute mime. When Phillip finally got her back, her boyfriend during her amnesia, architect Neil Everst, committed suicide and framed Phillip for Neil’s murder. Phillip faked his death with Rick’s help to gain time to prove his innocence. After Phillip was cleared of the murder, he and Rick were convicted of charges based on what they’d done to prove his innocence. They had a brief period of happiness and they were shipped off screen to a happily ever after in Arizona, that came undone when Phillip returned at the LAM wedding.\n\nThe brunette in pink as the bridesmaid is Sam Marler, Phillip’s biological sister. She was paralyzed when she was forced to jump from the car that Reva drove off the bridge. Reva drives off a bridge (and off the show) in 1990:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/reva-drives-off-the-bridge\n\nBeth shoos everyone out because “This dress deserves an entrance.” And it does. Plus Beth’s hair is beautiful. Many people who only knew Beth after her 1998 return will be surprised by how much stronger and forceful Beth is. Really after everything Beth went through it was amazing she was still standing by that point.\n\nMindy is at one of the worst places of her life and frankly I think now this particular version of Mindy’s problem was that she was just so selfish. I mean two of her best friends are marrying after 10 years and Mindy is totally making it about her. Mindy is currently having an affair with Roger who Alex believes is her loving and faithful husband. Roger actually does have some feelings for Alex, but feeling emasculated by Alex’s power and money, wanted a worshipful, nubile young thing and settled on Mindy who thought they’d eventually be married and have a life together. Mindy eventually did get pregnant, but lost the baby and her current chance with Rick which was just starting to look good again over her involvement with Roger. At this point Mallet knows, but Alexandra doesn’t. The show attempted to replace the strong male friendship between Phillip and Rick by pairing up Frank and Mallet who are currently running a private eye firm down the hall from Mindy’s design studio loft.\n\nPhillip had impregnated Beth before he faked his death and Beth and Rick married to help carry off the story that Phillip was dead, one of three times Phillip had gotten pregnant a woman Rick was either married to or in love with. Alan isn’t there because he is currently in prison, something he will use as a question to test Loreli.\n\nThe flower girl is Michelle. Not sure what current Ed-Maureen fight is, but he’s missing a golden opportunity to remind Maureen of their anniversary.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0iAR7bLZsE [Part 1]\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi75hy4DesY [Part 2]\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6izqOvjNVg [Part 3]\n\nUPDATE: It wasn’t labeled the same, but I just realized part 4 was also there.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUQYgSzIKtA [Part 4]\n\nTags: A.C.
