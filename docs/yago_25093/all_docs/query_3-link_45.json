        "text": "LASSING J.\n\nR. L. Spalding died in 1897, a resident of Marion county, leaving his wife and six children surviving him. He owned a farm of two tracts of land, containing about 375 acres. His wife and children lived upon and used this land until 1903, when she died, leaving surviving her the six children, of whom Agnes had married Bernard Cecil. She was over 21 years of age. The remaining five were minors; their ages ranging from 19 years, the oldest, to 8 years, the youngest. Their mother left a will in which she made her father, E. H. Boarman, testamentary guardian for her children. He also qualified as statutory guardian. The land is thin land, fencing was poor, and it is shown that the farm was much depreciated in value and rented for not exceeding $150 per year. E. H. Boarman, the grandfather, brought suit in the Marion circuit court, wherein he sought to have said land sold for the purpose of reinvesting the proceeds going to the minors in approved securities which would yield a better income. In this suit which was filed September 2, 1905, the guardian is plaintiff, and all of the children, including Agnes Cecil and her husband, Bernard Cecil, are made defendants. Following the filing of this suit, summons was served upon the adult defendants and also upon the infant defendants over 14 years of age, and upon the plaintiff as guardian for those under 14 years of age. On September 29, 1905, on motion of plaintiff P. K. McElroy, a regular practicing attorney at the Marion county bar, was appointed guardian ad litem for the infant defendants, Mary Belle Spalding, Mary P. Spalding, Mary Catherine Spalding, Joseph Leonard Spalding, and Mary Fannie Spalding. Summons was served upon the guardian ad litem for the infant children. At the January term, 1906, an amended petition was filed. This amendment recited that the mother of these children had attempted to make disposition of this land by her last will, and he asked that the court declare so much of her will as related to the real estate null and void. Proof was taken in support of the allegations of the petition. At the February term, 1906, of court the guardian ad litem filed his report for the five infant defendants, in which he stated that after a careful examination of the pleadings, exhibits, and proof, he was unable to make defense for them, and that he believed it to the interests of the infant defendants that the land be sold and the proceeds reinvested for their benefit; that the interests of his wards be protected. At the same term of court the plaintiff filed a second amended petition, in which he recited that after the death of his daughter, the mother of these children, he appeared in the county court of Marion county for the purpose of qualifying as executor of her will, and also as guardian of the children; that he executed bond, as he believed, as guardian; that he acted under his qualifications as such, supposing that it was regular and in due form; that thereafter he discovered that he had executed bond as executor, and not as guardian; that upon making this discovery, and on January 22, 1906, he executed bond as guardian for the children, for whom he had been acting theretofore under the belief that he had already executed bond. In this amendment he ratifies, adopts, and approves all the steps theretofore taken, and prays as in the original petition.\n\nAfter filing this amended petition the case was submitted for judgment on the pleadings, exhibits, and proof, and the court adjudged the defendants the owners of the land described in the pleading, directed it to be sold on the ground that it was indivisible, and the portion of the proceeds belonging to each infant to remain a lien upon the land until such infant arrived at full age, or until some one qualified in the circuit court as guardian. In obedience to this judgment, the land was sold by the master commissioner of the Marion circuit court, and at the September term, on September 25, 1906, he made report of his sale of same to J. C. and Joe Phillips for $2,300, and he filed with his report of sale the bonds, due in one and two years from the date of sale for the purchase price. On the 28th of September the report of sale was confirmed. At the same term of court this order confirming the report of sale was set aside, and the purchasers were permitted to file the following exceptions to the report of sale:\n\n..."
