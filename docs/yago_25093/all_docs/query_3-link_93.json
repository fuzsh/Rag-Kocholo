        "text": "The US Soccer Hall of Fame credits Dick Spalding with scoring the first goal for America in an international soccer tournament, in 1916.1 Newspaper articles at the time indicated that it was John Heminsley, not Spalding.2 Regardless, Spalding was considered one of the best soccer players in America while at the same time honing baseball skills that would land him in the National League with the Philadelphia Phillies as an outfielder in 1927. Soccer teammate and good friend Jimmie Wilson would become the lynchpin each step of the way in Spalding’s baseball career.\n\nCharles Harry Spalding was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 13, 1893. His father, also named Charles Harry Spalding, was listed as a builder in the 1910 federal census.3 His mother, Elizabeth Gibson Spalding, died in 1895 when he was two years old.4 When he was 4 years old, his father married Fanny Poultney.5 (For some unknown reason, Charles Harry became known as “Dick” to the sports world.)\n\nGrowing up, the young Spalding began his baseball career as a pitcher for Potter Grammar School. Upon graduation from grammar school, he enrolled at Northeast Manual Training, where – as a freshman – he was captain of the soccer team. He continued to play baseball, but mainly as an outfielder. At the end of his freshman year, he joined Lighthouse, a settlement house that served the needs of the Kensington area residents.6 He was “an unpaid diamond chattel and soccer hand.”7\n\nThrough his high school years, Spalding developed his soccer skills while playing for Lighthouse’s Kensington Boys Club team. During baseball season he played for several different amateur teams. After high school, Spalding’s soccer career began to outpace his baseball career. By 1912, at the age of 19, playing halfback for the Boys Club, he was lauded as a star of the then amateur American (Soccer) League.8\n\nFor the 1913 baseball season, the 20-year-old Spalding played for the semipro Stetson A.A.9 The 1914 soccer season found him playing for Victor A. C. of Philadelphia. Considered an underdog, Victor A.C. won a National Cup tournament against the favorite Disstons team, whose “efforts were rendered fruitless by the clever defensive work of . . . Spalding.”10\n\nIn 1915, Spalding worked as a clerk and played baseball for Station B of the Pennsylvania Railroad. After the end of baseball season, he joined and starred for the Disstons soccer team.11 In mid-February 1916, the Selection Committee of the American [Soccer] League selected Spalding to play for the All-Americans against the Anglo-Saxons, a team comprising players who were trained in England and Scotland but were active players in the American League. The game was billed as an international match.12 In the game, Spalding scored a goal and “led the attack” as the All-Americans beat the Anglo-Saxons 2–1.13 (While not a true “international” game, perhaps this is where the Soccer Hall of Fame determined Spalding made the first “international” goal.)\n\nFor the 1916 baseball season, Spalding decided to leave the Pennsylvania Railroad squad in favor of the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania team.14 Prior to the start of the 1916 soccer season, he was selected to the true U.S. “international” soccer team, whose first game on foreign soil was held in Sweden. The American team, representing the United States Football Association, tied Sweden 1-1. Spalding, using the first name Harry, “served the American team with conspicuous effectiveness. He repeatedly earned the applause of the crowd.” The only American goal – the first one scored abroad – was tallied by John Heminsley.15\n\nShortly after the American team returned to the United States, the Philadelphia Inquirer (using both Harry and Dick as first names) reported: “Although Harry Spalding has signed a form for Bethlehem for next season, he has not yet decided if he will play with the Steel Workers, . . . but they will be able to hold Spalding for the cup matches provided ‘Dick’ decides to assist one of the local teams the coming season.”16 (Spalding did decide to play for Bethlehem but told a sportswriter, “he was so much bruised from his hard games in Sweden that he would be unable to don togs for several days.”)17\n\nAfter a successful soccer season with Bethlehem, Spalding joined Chester for the 1917 Delaware County League baseball season.18 In this semipro circuit’s championship series, Spalding’s single started a two-run rally to win the second game against Frank “Home Run” Baker’s Upland team.19\n\nEarlier, with World War I raging, Spalding had registered for the draft on June 5. He enlisted in the Naval Reserves on March 28, 1918. On April 1, he began his active duty assigned to the Cost Accounting Department at the 4th Naval District Headquarters in Philadelphia. Spalding remained on active duty until March 21, 1919. He received an honorable discharge with the rank of Chief Yeoman on September 30, 1921.20\n\nWhile in the Navy, Spalding continued to play both soccer and baseball – often at overlapping times. His teammates on the Navy baseball team included Bob Shawkey, Morrie Rath, and Jing Johnson. On the soccer side, Spalding was quickly added to the Navy Shipbuilders All-Star team.21\n\nWhile playing for the Shipbuilders, Spalding signed a contract with New York Ship, of Camden, New Jersey, where he agreed to assist the New York team in the National Cup and American Cup Tournaments. Spalding intended to join the New York Ship team full-time after his release from the Navy.22 In early April 1919, he was selected to represent the Delaware River Shipyard Soccer League for a game against Bethlehem. Also selected was his friend Jimmie Wilson.23\n\nIn May, while still enlisted in the Navy, but no longer on active duty, Spalding joined the semipro baseball team of the E. G. Budd Manufacturing Company.24 By summer, he had moved on to the semipro Norristown Professionals team.25 In a game against the Cuban Stars, Spalding made a spectacular catch to take a home run away from Cuban star Pelayo Chacón (father of Elio Chacón).26 After the war ended, Bob Shawkey “begged [Spalding] to sign with the New York Yankees.” He declined.27\n\nFor the 1919 soccer season, Spalding, playing for the Merchant Shipbuilders, was considered the best fullback in the country. Even so, he took on the coaching duties for the Swarthmore College Garnets Soccer team.28 With Swarthmore, Spalding had the task of developing a first-time team into a competitive one. There were no expectations, yet he was able to bring the players to a winning level. Swarthmore finished the season by capturing the “championship in the Pennsylvania State League without a defeat.”29\n\nDespite his strong reputation, Spalding was left off the roster for the 1920 All-American Soccer Team that represented America in the Olympics. Instead, after playing a few baseball games for Germantown A. A.,30 he moved on to play for Home Run Baker’s Upland team.31 Upland played only on Saturdays and Sundays; thus, he was able to work for the Bethlehem Steel Works during the week.\n\nIn late 1920, instead of joining the Bethlehem soccer team, Spalding was allowed to sign with Wolfenden Shore in the Allied First Division.32 With Wolfenden, he played against the Chinese National team but was “never really tested.”33 In early December, Spalding was named to a local Philadelphia All-Star team called the Wanderers.34 On December 27 he “changed teams again. This time he signed with Erie A. C. of Erie, New Jersey.”35 In February 1921, Spalding was selected on the “pick of New Jersey” All-Star team.36 Though beloved by Philadelphia soccer fans, after a game against Eire, one sportswriter wrote: “our own ‘Dick’ Spalding had the habit Saturday of tripping the player when he had beat him with the ball.”37\n\nSpalding started the 1921 baseball season with the Norristown Professionals.38 By mid-June he was playing semipro ball for Chester.39 On off days, he joined the Millville, New Jersey team.40 When soccer season began, Spalding played for the Harrison New Jersey Soccer Club.41\n\nThe 1922 baseball season found Spalding playing for the South Phillies, where he hit .329 in 62 games.42 He was selected to an All-Star team that was scheduled to play against traveling Negro League teams.43 With the South Phillies’ season coming to an end, Spalding joined Viscose for the Delaware County League Championship. He drove in the winning run in the fourth game, giving Viscose a three games to one lead in the series.44 During the 1922 soccer season, Spalding played and coached for several teams.\n\nOn November 29, 1922, Spalding married Mary Elizabeth Vanneman. They had no children.45\n\nAfter trying to gain Spalding’s services during the 1922 baseball season, the Simmons Bedmakers of the outlaw Chicago Mid-West league were able to sign him for the 1923 season. The announcement of his signing described him as follows: “Dick Spalding, known throughout Eastern base-ball circles as one of the hardest-hitting and fastest fielding outfielders in the ranks of professional baseball.”46 While Spalding hit well from the start, it was a strikeout that endeared him to many Bedmakers fans. In a June 9 game he swung at a wide pitch for strike three. When the ball eluded the catcher, Spalding, with his speed, was able to reach second base before a play could be made.47 A strong July, in which he hit .400, brought his average up to .311.48 As the season progressed, Spalding continued to win praise for both his hitting and his fielding.\n\nAfter the baseball season, Spalding, along with friend Jimmie Wilson, joined the (Philadelphia) Wolfenden Short soccer team.49 However, neither showed up to play when Wolfenden started its season.50 By early December both Spalding and Wilson were back playing with Lighthouse.51 However, Spalding was not able to finish the season with Lighthouse after he was declared ineligible because of his professional status.52\n\nSpalding returned to the Simmons Bedmakers for the 1924 baseball season. He started strongly but was sidelined for several days in mid-season after he was hit in the knee with a pitch.53 Less than a week after the knee injury, he returned to the lineup. On September 26, a Kenosha (Wisconsin) Evening News article claimed that Spalding was one of ten former major-league players on the Bedmakers roster.54 (This was three years before evidence that he had any major-league activity.) He finished the season with a .301 batting average.55\n\nSpalding decided against returning to the Bedmakers for the 1925 baseball season. Instead, he joined the independent Brooklyn Bushwicks.56 He finished the season with Camden (New Jersey).57 Spalding returned to Camden for the 1926 season. By summer he was considering offers from three International League teams as well as two American Association teams – both circuits were Class AA, then the highest minor-league level. Instead, Jimmie Wilson convinced him to try the major leagues.58\n\nOn February 16, 1927, at the age of 33, Spalding signed a contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. Sportswriter S.O. Grauley wrote, “He has been playing ball for many years and is regarded as one of the best outfielders in the independent ranks. He rejected many offers from various big-league clubs during the last few years.”59 In spite of competition from Cy Williams, Freddy Leach, Al Nixon, and others, Spalding worked his way into the starting outfield at the start of the season.60 Although he had to adjust to a much higher quality of pitching than he had previously faced, he hit .296 for the season. Even more impressive, he led all National League outfielders with a .992 fielding average.\n\nThanks to his successful season, Spalding – identified as Charles – was added to the “roll of renown,” which recognized Philadelphia-area players who had “made good” in the major leagues.61\n\nSpalding had seriously injured his leg sliding into third base during the last game of the 1927 season.62 Nonetheless, Phillies manager Burt Shotton planned on having him in the 1928 Phillies outfield.63 With the start of spring training, Spalding reported early to continue rehabbing his leg. After the first practice, he reported, “My leg still feels stiff and there is a catch in it that bothers me.” Still, though not certain, he felt it would eventually return to normal.64 While working to rehab his leg, Spalding suffered a charley horse that slowed his progress.65\n\nThe day before opening day, Spalding was released by the Phillies when it became apparent that his leg would not return to normal. With his release, Spalding stated, “I’m a little afraid of my ankle yet. I wish I could forget it. . .. I believe it would have been better if I had broken it . . . but I guess I ought not complain for I had one year of the big show, something that millions of youngsters long for and never get.”66 In discussing his ankle, Spalding stated, “Two weeks ago I had to have it reset. The doctors told me that when it snapped back in place a year ago it had not hit the socket evenly. The ligaments were out of place, so I had it jerked out again.”67\n\nShortly after he was released by the Phillies, it was reported that the Boston Braves were interested in signing him.68 When that did not happen, Spalding agreed to manage Harrowgate, a semipro team from the Harrowgate area of Philadelphia. His intention was to be a playing manager once his ankle was better.69 Before he had a chance to manage that club, however, Spalding returned to the major leagues. He signed as an emergency outfielder with the Washington Senators (Nationals).70\n\nSpalding got a single in his first game with the Nats, as a substitute on May 25. He started in left on May 27, spelling Goose Goslin. Goslin was back in the lineup the next day, but Spalding subbed for him again because manager Bucky Harris felt he needed to replace Goslin’s weak throwing arm with Spalding’s strong arm.71 By early July, Harris was utilizing Spalding as a substitute baserunner.72 On July 11, Spalding replaced Sam Rice, who had been injured the day before, in the Washington lineup.73 He went 3-for-5 and started the following day as well.\n\nThat proved to be Spalding’s last game in the majors. When the Senators decided to “get along with one reserve outfielder,” he was handed his unconditional release on July 17. It came despite a .348 batting average in 23 at-bats and handling all nine fly balls hit in his direction without an error. 74\n\nSpalding was out of action for only a week when he was signed by the International League’s Baltimore Orioles, who planned for him to be a starter in the outfield.75 A Baltimore sportswriter recognized Spalding’s first week with the Orioles by writing, “The injection of [Spalding] into the Orioles’ line-up seems to be the signal for a lot of pep and hitting to be put on display.”76 Two weeks into his Orioles career, Spalding was hitting .440 and was given credit for improvement of the rest of the team’s hitters.77 Manager Jack Dunn stated, “Spalding is one of the prettiest hitters I’ve ever seen and when his sore arm rounds into shape he’ll be a top-notcher.” 78\n\nHowever, the arm did not “round into shape.” As the season progressed, Spalding was often lauded for his hitting while questions were asked about his fielding and throwing ability. Then, on August 20, he injured his ankle and had to leave the game.79 After missing a game, Spalding returned to the field, legging out a triple on the bad ankle.80 After 58 games and a .348 batting average, Spalding was selected, along with other International League stars, to play a series of postseason games, including games against the Negro League Baltimore Black Sox.81\n\nEven after his strong hitting performance, Baltimore did not include Spalding on its reserve list, thus making him a free agent.82 For the 1929 baseball season, he signed with another International League club, the Buffalo Bisons.83 Starting in center field, Spalding got off to a quick start, hitting .444.84 In early May, he was removed from the lineup for a few days so he could get his arm treated and rest it. He’d had arm problems through spring training and the first few regular games.85\n\nEven with that obstacle, Spalding continued to hit. On May 25, he had the league’s fifth-best average at .353.86 Yet overall, the ongoing arm issues made him expendable. On July 6, the Rochester Red Wings purchased Spalding’s contract. When the purchase was announced, a Rochester sportswriter commented, “Dick, being quite a slugger and base runner, although not possessed with the best throwing arm . . . will fill in nicely as a reserve.”87\n\nBaltimore Evening News sportswriter Leo Doyle described Spalding as “the weak link of Rochester’s chain of flycatchers,”88 Yet Rochester fans didn’t think so when after eight games, he was hitting .481.89 As it developed, Spalding continued to hit well and throw poorly for the balance of the season. He hit .301 (95-for-316) in 106 games overall for Buffalo and Rochester,\n\nThe Red Wings, led by manager Billy Southworth, won the International League title. Rochester then lost the “Little World Series” to the American Association champion, the Indianapolis Indians.90 Immediately after the “Little World Series,” Rochester informed Spalding he was being released.91 He thereupon joined Jimmie Wilson on a barnstorming tour.92\n\nThough Spalding was free to sign with any team in 1930, there is no evidence that he played baseball. Instead, it appears he spent the spring refereeing soccer games and the fall bowling.93\n\nSpalding returned to the semipro ranks for the 1931 season, playing for Camden.94 In a July game against the major-league Philadelphia Athletics, his fielding was “noteworthy, scampering all over to bag seven pretty putouts.”95 There was no reference to arm problems,\n\nAnother notable game took place in August, when Spalding joined the semipro Frankford Legion team for a match against the Hilldale Negro League team. Frankford won 6-5.96\n\nSpalding rejoined the Camden Skeeters for the 1932 season.97 While playing for Camden, he also played for Raphael A.A. of the Philadelphia League in a game against Hilldale.98 And, time permitting, he again put on his spikes for Frankford Legion.99\n\nIn February 1933, Spalding indicated that he planned to play the upcoming season “if I find I have a pair of legs.”100 Apparently, his wheels were okay – he returned to play with Frankford Legion.101\n\nIn 1934, Spalding returned to the major leagues – not as a player, but as a coach for his friend Jimmie Wilson, who had been named manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. According to Wilson, Spalding, while signed to coach, would be called upon as an emergency catcher if needed. Wilson claimed Spalding “is the best left-handed catcher that ever played the outfield.” Wilson jokingly went on to say he hired Spalding because he had a big nose “that I can punch when I lose a ball game.”102\n\nAt the start of spring training, Spalding was named the “official timekeeper” during practice. In order to do this job, Wilson bought him an alarm clock and told him to keep it in his back pocket.103 While in spring training, the Phillies put on a show to benefit the Milk Fund for undernourished children. During the show, Spalding, dressed in a pair of violet pajamas, sang “Alice Blue Gown” until players, dressed as waitresses, “pelted him with cabbage leaves, lemons, kumquats and oranges.”104\n\nWhile coaching the Phillies, Spalding and fellow coach Hans Lobert initiated a baseball school for young players from local Philadelphia teams. The players would spend part of a day learning baseball fundamentals and part of the day playing games in Phillies Park (a.k.a. Baker Bowl). The first day of “baseball school” was a wild success: 238 kids showed up to meet and learn from Spalding and Lobert.105\n\nDespite a seventh-place National League finish, Wilson was retained as manager for the 1935 season. He was allowed to keep both Spalding and Lobert as coaches.106 As the season progressed, Wilson told them that neither had “made a mistake this season in. . .handling of the men on the bases,” and that each could manage as well as he did. He added, “as long as I have a job managing you will be my assistants if you [want].”107\n\nAlthough his 1935 Phillies again finished in seventh place, Wilson was retained to manage the club in 1936, and Spalding remained on his coaching staff. After the Phillies finished the 1936 season in last place, Spalding resigned in order to take a position with a bank.108\n\nFour years later, Jimmie Wilson signed a contract to manage the Chicago Cubs in 1941. He immediately signed Spalding to be his assistant, not as a coach, but to “tutor young players.”109 During spring training 1941, Spalding, “who chucked over a purchasing agent’s job to help his buddie,” stated, “[For] four years, I did my spring training at smokers and banquets. It took me a few weeks to start thinking correctly. But I’m on the right track now.”110\n\nAfter the 1941 Cubs finished sixth, Spalding returned to the Cubs for the 1942 season. During spring training, he was seen “carrying a ball bag in one hand and a portable typewriter in the other.”111 Spalding returned to the team’s coaching staff in 1943. After the close of that season, he turned to scouting for the Cubs.112\n\nIn 1949, while still in that role, Spalding headed a traveling baseball fundamentals clinic, sponsored by minor league baseball. It was designed to help youth and high school coaches to “better instruct” their players.113\n\nAt that time, he was suffering from cancer. After fighting the disease for over a year, Charles H. “Dick” Spalding died on February 3, 1950.114 He was buried in the Northwood Cemetery in Philadelphia.115\n\nWhile baseball mourned his death, the soccer world celebrated Spalding’s life. That same year, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis biography was reviewed by Darren Gibson and Rory Costello and fact-checked by Russ Walsh.\n\nSources\n\nIn addition to the sources cited in the Notes, the author also consulted Baseball-Reference.com and the Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball.\n\nNotes\n\n1 www.nationalsoccerhof.com/players/dick-spalding.html.\n\n2 “American Soccers Play Tie Contest,” Sun (New York, New York), August 17, 1916: 13.\n\n3 1910 United States Federal Census.\n\n4 Charles Harry “Dick” Spalding (1893-1950) – Find A Grave Memorial.\n\n5 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., Marriage Index, 1885-1951.\n\n6 Founded in 1893 by Esther Kelly, the Lighthouse, located in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, has served as a settlement house with the mission to provide educational, recreational, and economic improvement programs to families. https://www.hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid1970lighthouse.pdf.\n\n7 “Spalding Leaped from Lots to Stardom in Big Leagues,” Newspaper and date not identified.
