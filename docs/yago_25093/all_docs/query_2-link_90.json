        "text": "“Most people hate their jobs, but this has been so much fun,” said Grant Aleksander (left, in 1999), who until Sept. 18 plays Phillip Spaulding on “Guiding Light,” (he has had the role on and off for 27 years) at the final wrap party for the longest running show in history. While buckets of tears were shed on Wednesday night at the Paley Center for Media, there were also plenty of laughs.\n\nRunning from 1937 on radio and hitting TV in 1952, “GL” is the only show to live long enough to have multigenerational characters and viewers, and only 200 fans were lucky enough to score tickets. The rest packed into a room and wept via closed circuit.\n\nWhen asked about his least favorite story line, Michael O’Leary (Dr. Rick Bauer for 26 years) joked with real-life best pal Aleksander about a time long ago Rick was to give Phillip a stuffed lamb to remember him by since he was leaving town. Written into the script was a scene where Rick would throw the stuffed lamb at the wall in frustration that his best friend was leaving him, fall to the ground on his knees crying, and then proceed to surgically sew up the lamb (He is a doctor, after all.) “I was like, ‘Seriously, what’s with the lamb?'” he said. Laughing hysterically and patting his leg, Aleksander replied, “Reginald! The lamb! I wish he were here now!”\n\nKim Zimmer (right in 1987, Reva for 26 years) talked about what it was like doing the show in the ’80s: “It was fantastic! They had money to burn, baby! They’d spend $750 on a blouse. We had big everything — big hair, big shoulder pads…”\n\n“And then there were the ladies,” chuckled Aleksander. There was always an element of humor on “Guiding Light,” even in moments where an actor would forget a line, he could often ad-lib with a quick smile, and the audience took comfort in the fact that the actors weren’t taking themselves too seriously. “Being perfect is no fun,” said Gina Tognoni (Dinah Marler).\n\n“I’ve been rejected by every different type of woman on this show — black, white, old, young, hearing-impaired. Maybe now I’ll have better odds,” joked O’Leary, who has done stand-up comedy and added comic relief to a show that has dealt with everything from cancer, cloning and gastric bypass surgery to rape and twins by two different fathers.\n\nThe therapeutic nature of the soap opera was apparent at the party. One man gave “a shout-out” for helping him survive several gastric bypass surgeries; one woman talked about how a story line helped her through the recent death of her husband.\n\nIt’s hard for actors who have had such a long gig to move on. But don’t worry too much. Tina Sloan, who has played Lillian Raines for 26 years, is focusing on her one-woman stage show, “Changing Shoes,” which starts next month in Atlanta. Zimmer, half of one of the most famous couples ever in daytime — Reva and Josh (Robert Newman, now in off-Broadway’s “Sessions”) — has a new agent and plans to jump back and forth between New York and LA until she finds her next job.\n\n“‘Guiding Light’ has a very resilient group. These people will continue to pursue … and succeed in telling stories and telling the truth,” said Tognoni."
