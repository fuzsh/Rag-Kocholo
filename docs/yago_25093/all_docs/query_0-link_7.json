There are more people around than I’ve specifically named. Fell free to mentally insert any favorite I’ve skipped. Feel free to write in what your fav is doing.\n\nBauer BBQ 2017 by Robansuefarm Part 3\n\nScene 12\n\nBack in the kitchen, a commotion sounded at the door. Rusty Shayne and Wanda Hite arrived bearing the necessities for Oklahoma BBQ. Rusty had made the trip up from his ranch near Tulsa. He barely got his load down on the kitchen table before Mindy threw her arms around his neck.\n\n“Melinda Sue,” he said happily. “Are you doing as well as you look?”\n\n“As fine as an Oklahoma sunrise. How are you doing?”\n\n“Oklahoma is still less fun without you, but the ranch is doing fine.”\n\nRick came in a pulled a grimace. Most of Mindy’s ex-es he didn’t much mind. In fact his best friend Phillip was one of them, but Rusty was the one whose relationship went back with Mindy longer than Rick’s. They had grown up together as kids. It was her one relationship that he felt might be as strong as theirs. Rusty and Mindy had grown up together as kids. Rick was happier when he stayed down in Oklahoma where he belonged.\n\nRick swallowed and walked over with his hand extended. “Rusty,” he said. “Thanks for bringing the Oklahoma BBQ. I know it makes Mindy happy and people have come to expect it now.”\n\n“Don’t mind me and Earl. We make no never mind.”\n\nMindy jumped in. “Wanda, now you know we see you and Earl a lot more often than we do Rusty.”\n\nWanda helped balance her load on the back of a chair as she paused. “Where do you want us to set up?”\n\nBilly came in. “Rusty, what are you doing by letting Wanda stand there with a heavy load. I’ll take that.”\n\nDuring this exchange and the ribbing, a woman with long, black hair pulled into a tight bun. She was dressed too formally for the party in a black suit. She quietly worked her way behind the happy group and edged into a dark corner of the patio.\n\nScene 12B\n\nThe Indian motorcycle continue to drive south. He passed a green highway sign saying, “Springfield 172 miles.” He gunned it around a black suburban and hurried on.\n\nScene 13\n\nBeth and Phillip had the art auction entries each set up on their own easel along the edge of the patio. Each had a number that matched a description in the glossy printed guide.\n\nClarissa Marler and Maureen Reardon had the children’s art station all set up. They grabbed kids who arrived early and set them to work on the mural.\n\nMindy had come out to make sure her fashion drawing she’d donated for the auction looked right, but she had been caught by the sight of the kids playing. It yanked at her heart reminding her of the baby she’d lost and the children she and Rick never had.\n\nRick had caught Mindy’s expression across the patio and came up behind her. “It looks like they could use some help. Why don’t you dig in there?”\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“I know so. No one spreads sunshine like you do.”\n\nLooking cheered up, Mindy dived into the kids. She started helping a girl make a dog she was painting look a little less like park bench.\n\nThe woman with the tight bun had reached the artwork going straight to the painting from the Spaulding attic. She looked the painting over very carefully. She moved back into the shadows and pulled out her cell phone. She pressed a saved number. “It’s definitely THE painting…..No, not yet. I will try to get it before the auction starts. She abruptly ended the call.\n\nScene 14\n\nMolly Spaulding came rushing into the Bauer kitchen nearly running into Blake and then Buzz in the process. Her dad, Alan-Michael Spaulding, was hot on her heels. “God Dad, stop hovering. I go to college for heaven’s sake. I don’t need you looking over my shoulder all the time.”\n\n“Princess, will you wait up. I wasn’t hovering I was….”\n\nBoth continued through the kitchen and out the back door to the patio.\n\nLucy came in a troubled expression on her face. Frank intercepted her with a hug. “What’s going on, Sis?”\n\nWaving towards the door, “You heard. Molly thinks Alan-Michael has been overly protective and it’s smothering. You know he always was protective, but lately…”\n\n“Did something happen?”\n\n“Well, he went to visit Hope earlier this month…I’m afraid she’s not doing well. Alan-Michael can’t do anything to help her so he’s determined to keep up safe. He knows I can take care of myself, but he’s even been a bit hover-y with me and he’s way overboard with Molly. Then there was her boyfriend.”\n\n“What about him?”\n\n“Tom got a little aggressive with her, enough so she filed a police report.”\n\n“Oh, what did you say his last name is? Does he go to Springfield U with Molly?”\n\n“Yes, he goes to Springfield U, but don’t worry about putting the fear of God into him. Besides making it clear that him that putting hands on a woman like that was NOT acceptable, he also specifically made him aware at the might the Spauldings could bring down on his head. After Brent, Alan-Michael isn’t taking any chances.”\n\n“None of us do,” Frank said pulling Lucy in for a big brotherly hug. He silently gave a prayer of Thanksgiving that it had turned out as well as it had. “I’m glad he’s watching out for both of you.”\n\n“He’s watching over us all right, but it’s driving Molly nuts. When I was her age I was conning people out of jobs and almost ready to decide who I was going to marry. He’s got to give her some space before she does something crazy to assert her independence, and if there’s one thing Alan-Michael and I know about acting out and doing extreme things to get our way….I hope Molly can avoid learning about it.”\n\nLucy bit her lip and looked out the door in the direction that Alan-Michael and Molly had gone.\n\nScene 15\n\nBridget hurried through the Bauer living room towards the front door. Lillian and Buzz were sitting on the couch talking. “Is she here yet? Kat just texted she was almost here.”\n\nBridget through open the door and there stood Kat looking stark and formal. Bridget paused, and then both women broke into laughter as they hugged each other. Bridget wrapped her arm around Kat’s shoulders. “You’re looking great, Kat. It’s been way too long. What’s it been since we saw each other? Oh, at least a year since you came to visit us in Oakdale.”\n\n“It’s been even longer since I’ve been back to Springfield.” Kat looked back at the open door. “Paul, Hamp, get in here.” Kat shared an exasperated look with her best friend. “You keep thinking it will get easier as they get older — it doesn’t.”\n\n“Tell me about it. Peter’s out of college now and I still worry about him….and he still doesn’t pick up after himself.”\n\nBoth women were laughing together when Paul and Hamp walked in, Hamp pulling the door shut behind them.\n\nHamp looked rebellious. “I still don’t see why we had to come here to celebrate the fourth. The guys and I had pitched in on some fireworks and now I’m going to miss them setting them off.”\n\nKat walked over to Hamp. “Because the Bauer BBQ is the best time to visit Springfield. It’s the one time when the whole town is together and I want you to meet some of your Grandpa Hamp’s friends. You never got to meet him and I want them to help you get an idea of what he was like. I want you to see his club. Plus this is where I finished growing up. You’ll just have to put up with it. Besides here’s Bridget. You like Bridget don’t you?”\n\n“Ya, Bridget is fun.”\n\n“Thanks…I think.”\n\n“Plus your Uncle Billy is here. He was Grandpa Hamp’s best friends. He can tell you about when they played football together.”\n\nPaul broke in with a smile. “Billy’s here? Where?”\n\nBridget answered, “Right before you got here he was out watching them set up the grill. I’ll walk you back there….Oh before we do that I want you to meet Lillian and Buzz. Kat, you remember them.”\n\n“Of course…. Boys, Buzz here makes the best non-Bauer burger in town. When I was your age, I used to hang out at his restaurant, the Fifth Street diner, all the time. And this is Lillian she’s the best nurse anywhere.”\n\nBuzz shrugged one shoulder, “Not the greatest….”\n\nLillian interrupted. “That’s nice of you to say, Sweetie.”\n\n“These are my boys Paul and Hamp.”\n\nLillian added, “Oh, I see their resemblance to Hamp. Now I think Bridget told me that you were married to Paul Frasier’s son. Ed Bauer has told all about your grandfather. He was one of Ed’s mentors and a great surgeon before he got promoted to administration, but you want to talk about Hamp. Have fun today.”\n\nCommercial Break 3\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

Michelle thinks Pedro knew too much. Danny just hopes that Carmen stays away. He tells Michelle he is a bit concerned that Alan hasn’t called him about a job yet. Michelle reminds him that Beth just died and he probably has a lot on his mind. Claire comes in and tells Danny and Michelle that they can’t trust Alan. She tells them that Alan kicked her out. Danny thinks Claire shouldn’t have made appointments for Alan without his knowledge. Claire tells them she was just trying to help. She tells them that Alan is a control freak. Michelle wonders if that ruined things for Danny as well. Danny tells them he is going over to see Alan after the memorial service. Michelle says she is going as well after they get a babysitter. Claire offers to sit with Robbie but Michelle doesn’t want her to. Claire tells her that she is homeless but she doesn’t bite. She only tells Claire that she is sure she will land on her feet. At the Spaulding Mansion: Alan comes in to meet Danny and Michelle. Danny tells him that he was worried when he didn’t hear from him because he was under the impression Alan wanted to hire him. Alan tells Danny that paranoia doesn’t become him. He was impressed with his spunk and confidence the other night and if he wants the job, he is Spaulding’s new Director of Corporate Security. They thank Alan and leave. Alan picks up the phone and tells someone to handle the situation with Gus Aitoro. Back at the Bauer House: Michelle and Danny talk about how they can celebrate his new job. They kiss and head inside. When they step in the kitchen Carmen is holding the baby and says hello to both of them.\n\nFri., Aug. 31, 2001 – At the Bauer House: Danny and Michelle come in to find Carmen holding Robbie. She tells them she paid the sitter and told her that she was Robbie’s grandmother and the girl left. Michelle is terrified and Danny asks her to stand back. He goes to Carmen and tells her to let him have his son. Carmen holds on to Robbie and tells Danny she has already lost so much time with him and Robbie and she wants to make up for that. She tells Danny that she loves the baby already, he reminds her so much of Danny as a boy. She would never hurt him. Michelle reminds her she tried to kill Robbie when she was pregnant. Carmen tells her that was unfortunate but she has realized how precious life is now. Carmen finally hands the baby to Danny. Danny hands Michelle the baby and tells her to stay back. He picks up the phone and calls the police. Carmen tells Danny that she came back to turn herself in so he should go ahead and call the cops. Carmen tells Danny she gave him life and will always be a part of him. She just wants a chance to be part of his life and know her grandson. Just then Frank shows up and is surprised to see Carmen. Danny tells him that Carmen is there to turn herself in. Carmen tells Danny he should let go of his grudges. Danny tells Frank to get Carmen out of there before he really kills her. Carmen and Frank leave and Danny kisses Michelle and Robbie. Michelle is still shaken and doesn’t want to let the baby go. Danny tells her that this changes everything. He was looking forward to starting over with his new job at Spaulding and now Carmen comes back and ruins it. He tells Michelle that Carmen will be splashed all over the news and that means the press will be hounding them too. He also thinks that Carmen won’t stop harassing them. Michelle tells Danny that Carmen has tried to kill her twice and has framed both of them as well as tried to destroy their relationship and she has always failed. They are stronger than she is and their love has conquered everything she has tried. Michelle is sure that Carmen will not succeed whatever her latest scheme is. She tells Danny to focus on his new job because they have nothing to fear from Carmen. At the Police Station: Frank has Carmen is an interrogation room. He gives her paper and pen and tells her to get writing. She asks him what he expects her to confess to. He tells her that she can start with where she has been and how Jennifer Tarver’s body ended up in the water after she helped Carmen. Carmen wants to make a call first. She takes the phone and makes her call. She tells the person on the other end who she is and that she would like to talk to them. Frank is trying to lean on Carmen when Gus arrives. Carmen tells Frank she called Gus instead of a lawyer. Frank tells her that Gus isn’t a lawyer. Gus says he studied law but didn’t take the bar exam. Carmen says he is a PI and she wants to speak to him alone. Frank leaves and Gus tells Carmen that Frank is right; she needs a lawyer not a PI. She says she needs someone with pull and she knows he is still very much a special agent with the FBI and she wants him to cut her a deal.\n\nMy Comments:\n\nAs much as it freaks me out just as much as Manny to see Carmen holding Robbie this really is one of my favorite Carmen-Manny scenes. It came out of almost nowhere except that Carmen – much like Beetlejuice – shows up if you talk about her too much. It was a nasty shock when we were being promised a Manny celebration sex scene which are always the best. That said I just adore how Manny act as a team on this, how Danny steps forward to deal with Carmen knowing Michelle is her hot button, signaling Michelle to stay back and let him handle it, staying perfectly calm and even smiling not to upset Robbie or Carmen while she held their son. I think it shows a lot of Carmen’s mindset too. She still doesn’t like Michelle, but her actively trying to kill her is pretty much over. Carmen really does want to be part of Danny and Robbie’s lives. I think she still nutso and acting for reasons other than motherly/grandmotherly love, but this family side IS part of Carmen. I’m so sorry they went all the way to attempted murder of Michelle with Carmen. That threat just below the surface while they go head to head was a lot more entertaining in general. Sadly that was something that is never restablished in the Stablan Manny era, part of it was the plot and writing, but also because somehow Joie’s Michelle just had a better animosity chemistry with Carmen than Nancy’s Michelle ever did.\n\nDanny trusts Carmen so little now he wants the entire room at least between Carmen and Michelle or Robbie. This is ground down a bit over time and I don’t really think it should have been, but I think this was the perfect level of concern for Manny to have over her. Then there is one of my absolute favorite bits of action having gotten Carmen on the other side of the table Danny moves everything off of the counter so she won’t have a weapon. The knife block is one thing, but he also moves the canister with things like whisks, ladles, and a spaghetti scoop. I like to picture what Carmen might have done with a spaghetti scoop. It just cracks me up. I think that Danny didn’t just call the police. I think he called Frank specifically. Sadly the Danny-Frank friendship will fall away somewhat from this point on as Manny move further into the Spaulding storyline, but will remain viable and present until the stupid Danny-Marina storyline kills it. Just one more reason that awful storyline was so, SO wrong. I’m glad Frank got credit for the Carmen bust though. Frank was an excellent community policeman, I think he was a pretty good chief, but as someone solving mysteries? It just wasn’t his strength so I’m glad he got a major collar. Then it’s great after Danny was strong when he needed to me to reveal such weakness to get Michelle’s comfort here. SO excellent.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

I went straight to a screen test because they knew I had that body of work with General Hospital. Working with Jay Hammer [Fletcher Reade] was awesome. We had such chemistry. I recently came across a picture with Jay where he’s hugging me and I had the most genuine smile. I was just so happy. I wish they had developed our storyline further, but there was a change in producers and writers, and Claire gave birth to Michelle and gave the baby to Ed and Maureen, and the next thing I knew I was off the show.

It took me WAY past the end of July to finish this fanfic which just tells you it’s time to get started on yours for next year NOW! Tell me what YOU think Bauer BBQ 2017 will be like and share. I also should mention I have a thing about people not doing the bridal march properly. If anything looks ungainly it’s just stomping down the aisle like you were walking anywhere else, so I spell out the proper steps.\n\nBauer BBQ 2014 by Robansuefarm Chapter 4\n\nThe crowd slowly shifted from the Bauer patio through the hedge to the Spaulding backyard. Rick led the way over the flat part of the lawn. It had rented white folding chairs set up in two groups with a white carpet runner up the middle between the two groups. The chairs were all faced in one direction facing the white wood trellis covered with red roses. A small string ensemble softly began playing background music. The guests gradually settled down and even the whispers trailed off as the music picked up in volume and intensity. A side door opened in the Spaulding Mansion and a group of men emerged. Most of them were wearing tuxedos. Ray lead the group wearing his clerical robes. Behind him came Frank Cooper, Phillip Spaulding, Rick Bauer, and Robbie Santos. They filed past slowly taking their places in a line in front of the arbor. Again the music hit a chord and the French doors opened again and this time Danny Santos came walking out to take his place beside his son and best man, Robbie. He just couldn’t quit smiling. He grinned back down at his son who was bursting with pride at his special role as best man. Danny resisted rumpling his hair because Robbie was trying so hard to act grown up. He looked up over Robbie’s head at his friends. Rick who he now considered his brother and he was happy to say the affection and connection was now returned. Beyond him was Phillip Spaulding. There had always been a sort of respect and connection between the two men and Phillip and Danny’s relationship had grown over the years. After they had returned to town and Danny accepted the job at Spaulding Enterprises they had grown quite close. He and Michelle had been included in the Four Musketeers social sphere since their return and while he once never would have believed it, he felt part of that group. The last one of his groomsmen was Frank Cooper, who had long been one of his best friends, Danny did turn away and suddenly grimaced at the thought of how lost he’d gotten during Michelle’s amnesia. How could he have betrayed his good friend like that? Reaching out to Frank’s daughter in his desperate search for normalcy, he wouldn’t have blamed Frank if he’d never forgiven him and he thanked God that he had.\n\nDanny was distracted by the flash of color when Michelle’s cousin Bridget moved from her position at the table with the reception book to her seat beside her husband, Dylan Lewis. Danny’s eyes locked on the far side of white carpet runner. He heard his daughter giggling behind the hedge. The string quartet struck up playing “Too Busy Being in Love” and Chelsea Reardon, Michelle’s aunt, began to sing.\n\n♪♫♪ If I had taken the time\n\nTo write down a few lines\n\nEvery time that you crossed this heart of mine\n\nPut them all in a book\n\nHow much time would that have took?\n\nBut words and years have a way of slipping by\n\nOh no, too bad\n\nThere goes the chance that I had ♪♫\n\nI could have written a play so sweet and so funny\n\nGiven old Mr. Shakespeare, a run for his money\n\nWritten the words to the prettiest tune\n\nThat would never leave a dry eye in the room\n\nMy only excuse for not doing enough\n\nWell, I was too busy, being in love\n\nYes, I was too busy, being in love\n\n♫♪♫ Brand new phrases appear\n\nEvery time you are near\n\nAll these words you inspire after all these years\n\nBut I never reached for a pen\n\nBreak the mood that I’m in\n\nBefore I knew it, the words were gone again\n\nOh no, too bad\n\nThere goes the chance that I had ♪♫\n\nI could have written a play so sweet and so funny\n\nGiven old Mr. Shakespeare a run for his money\n\nWritten the words to the prettiest tune\n\nThat would never leave a dry eye in the room\n\nMy only excuse for not doing enough\n\nWell, I was too busy, being in love\n\nYes, I was too busy, being in love\n\n♫♪♫ I could have written the poem to make young lovers crazy\n\nI could have written a movie for Hepburn and Tracey\n\nThe most beautiful song and it starts with your name\n\nWritten my way into fortune and fame\n\nBut I have no regrets for not doing it now\n\nWell, I was too busy, being in love\n\nYes, I was too busy, being in love ♫♪♫\n\nAs the words to the song ended and began again the second time through as an instrumental, Hope appeared and took her time centering herself on the white carpet. She paused and giggled again, Danny wasn’t sure if it was because she was so happy or because his little drama queen wanted to make sure that all attention on her before she started down the aisle. She took a breath, grinned, and started down the aisle taking loooong steps in the proper bridal march; right step, together, left step, together, right step….. As she went she sprinkled pink rose petals along the aisle in her fluffy, light pink dress. She arrived at the end of the aisle and stepped over to the far side next to the groomsmen.\n\nNext down the aisle, dressed in a matching dress only in a dusky rose, came Beth. Step right, together, left step, together, right step… Beth also carried a short, dark haired beauty, the latest pride of their love, Danielle. Danielle was the other flower girl, but had proven very definitely at the rehearsal that she couldn’t be trusted walking down the aisle either alone or with her big sister. Beth was about halfway down the aisle when the next lady in pink appeared around the hedge, it was Drew, Michelle’s maid of honor from their church wedding at Casa Santos. They hadn’t really been close before that, but they had grown close over the next few years and had kept in touch even after she moved to New York and they had moved to California. Drew was beaming and had a calm, contentment she had never shown before having finally made peace with her marriage, the lies and hurts of her childhood, and made her faith a strong tenant in her life. Beth had reached the altar and moved to her place at the far end. When Drew hit the middle point of the aisle, the final bridesmaid, Michelle’s step-sister Blake took her turn to walk down the aisle. When Blake hit the assigned point, Mindy, Michelle’s sister-in-law and matron of honor, started down the aisle in her matching dress. Mindy followed down the aisle and moved into her matron of honor position and put Dani down and held her hand. Dani showed that she could be just as much a center of attention as her big sister as she wore her matching light pink dress. She smiled at the audience did her best expression that she always used on her daddy when she wanted him to give her something and then she stuck her hand down and grabbed the hem of her skirt and yanked it up revealing her special lace lollies as the audience broke into general laughter. Accepting she’d had her due, Dani dropped her hand and fastened her eyes on where she remembered her mommy reappearing last night at the rehearsal.\n\nThe music changed and began the bridal march and just like that Michelle stepped onto the end of the white runner. The fluffy white dress focused on its sweetheart neckline and made a shawl collar and a flowing skirt that ended mid-calf. A narrow pink sash of pink encircled Michelle’s waist and tied behind. Around her neck was a gold chain, three charms hung from it, a locket with Maureen’s photo inside, a third grade spelling bee winning charm, and a charm shaped like the house they had finally built at Laurel Falls. Michelle’s hair had been twisted into an updo and was covered by a Mantea. It was the one from their Church wedding and while their feelings of that event were twisted by his family’s involvement, the service had still meant a lot to both of them. After all, it was that ceremony that kept that bound to each other through all eternity in the eyes of the Church. During the annulment separation, it had been the one piece of clothing of Michelle’s that Danny had kept. They felt it was an important tie to a part of their past.\n\nIt had been hard on Danny and Michelle both to spend the night before the wedding apart, they had always hated to spend a night apart, even before their fake marriage had turned real. It was worse than ever now when they were used to cuddling and ….. more…. every night in their California king size bed. Their eyes met across the garden and then Michelle’s face broke like the sun in their secret smile. Bill Lewis stepped up beside her and she came down the aisle on his arm.\n\nMichelle and Danny were so focused on each other that everyone else faded into the background. Danny took Michelle by the hand and they kneeled beside each other facing Ray in his role as their priest. They vaguely heard Ray say, “Who gives this woman in marriage?” and Bill answer, “On behalf of her parents and myself, I do.” They both missed it, but Bill winked at them as he said the myself part.\n\nRay started. “We are here today to celebrate the renewed marriage of Daniel Santos and Berta Michelle Bauer Santos.” He bestowed on the crowd a welcoming smile. “Michelle and Danny have had a little trouble getting this right.” Another smile, met with a chuckle from the audience. “This is the seventh time they have come together before God and dedicated their lives, their hearts, and their sacred honor to each other. While they separated on several occasions, they have always honored their vows. During their original pre-cana, Danny and Michelle discovered just how closely their desires were for the same type of marriage, the same type of life and while they faced many challenges they have created that life for themselves and their children.”\n\nAs one Michelle and Danny turned to look at their children in turn, to Robbie who was standing beside his father as his best man, to Hope and then Dani who were serving as flower girls. Their children beamed back at them.\n\n“Danny and Michelle have written their own vows.”\n\nMichelle handed Mindy her bouquet. They stood and faced each other.\n\nDanny cleared his throat. “Michelle, I know we took the scenic route to get where we are.” More laughter from the audience and he waited until it ebbed before he continued, “We both had a lot to learn to get this far. This is OUR life, OUR family, and we need to be willing to fight for it to be what we want. I mean you look innocent and beautiful and soft and pink, but underneath you’re like steel. I always knew you had that in you. It’s one of the reasons I fell in love with you. You never really gave up on me deep down and so you never really let me give up on myself, not quite all the way and we made it, baby. I look around now and I can’t believe what we’ve built together. I knew I was lying to you that day by the park bench when I told you I could never be happy in your life, but I had no idea just how wonderful it could be. Thank you, my beautiful wife for all eternity.”\n\nMichelle replied, “Danny, a few years ago, I was talking to Marah and when I got home I wrote what I said down and kept it because it was so right. I’ve taken it out to read while times were difficult and I want to share it with you now.” Michelle unfolded and smoothed the faded and crinkled piece of paper. She looked up at Danny as her hand slightly shook. She smiled, “Remember I dropped my vows on our first wedding day. I’ll try to do better today…..Looking back I wouldn’t do a thing differently because you are worth it. It’s like we’re on some kind of a journey. Sometimes you lose direction, sometimes it’s me, but we’re supposed to be traveling together. I know that in my bones, sometimes it’s the only thing I do know, but I am sure, so wherever we end up together I know that’s where I want to be. Thank you, my handsome husband for all eternity.”\n\nThey stood and Michelle turned to the audience, letting go of one of Danny’s hands and turning him with her. “And I want to also thank all of you for being part of our special day. This is the third time we’ve recited vows on July 4th. Ray has been there for all three times.” She paused turning to smile back at him before continuing. “The first time we said our vows on this day we skipped the Bauer BBQ to do it, but the other two times we’ve been here and that’s better. The Bauer BBQ is very special for our family. The tradition of marking Independence Day as an important occasion dates back to my Great-Grandfather Papa Bauer. He and Mama Bauer were immigrants and truly appreciated the gift that was the United States. The party got a little bigger under my Grandma Bert whose apple pie recipe I always make for this day. Finally my parents, Ed and Maureen turned it into the celebration it is today. A celebration of family, friends, and the Springfield community. A place where everyone is welcome, old connections are refreshed, and where we celebrate the spirit of this country. A lot of you who knew me then questioned my choice when I wed Danny the first time, but you were wrong. It scared me so much I was afraid to admit, but the first time I looked into Danny’s eyes I saw my soul, his soul, as one and that’s what I still see. I also see so much love and that’s a love we share with all of you. I recently read a quote that made me think about Grandma Bert’s apple pies. Love is not a single pie (p-i-e), hand out your 8 slices and you’re done. Love is pi (p-i), irrational and never ending. Thank you for being here to day to help celebrate our irrational, never ending love.” Michelle turned back to Danny, re-clasped his hand and they shared their secret smile.\n\nDanny whispered, “That’s perfect, you’re perfect.”\n\nRay cleared his throat bringing attention back to him and said, “The ceremony of marriage in which you come to be united is one of the first and oldest ceremonies in the entire world, celebrated in the beginning in the presence of God himself. Marriage is a gift in that we give ourselves totally to one another. I believe that marriage is a gift given to comfort the sorrows of life and to magnify life’s joys.”\n\n“Marriage is the clasping of hands, the blending of two hearts, the union of two lives into one, and your marriage must stand, not by the authority of the State, nor by the seal on your wedding certificate, but by the strength and power of the faith and love you have in one another.”\n\n“Repeat after me.”\n\nDanny grinned, “I think we’ve got this.” He grinned at Michelle. She had handed her bouquet to Mindy and then clasped both of Danny’s hands.\n\nDanny looked deeply into her eyes and vowed,”I, Danny, take you Michelle, to be my lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish; from this day forward until death do us part.”\n\nRay added, “Danny, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? Forsaking all others, be faithful only to her so long as you both shall live?”\n\nDanny had never looked happier when he said, “I do.”\n\nLooking just as serious, Michelle vowed in turn. “I, Michelle, take you Danny, to be my lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish; from this day forward until death do us part.”\n\nRay responded, “Michelle, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Forsaking all others, be faithful only to him so long as you both shall live?”\n\nMichelle replied, “I do.”\n\nRay continued, “Having this kind of love in your hearts for one another, you have chosen to exchange rings as the sign and seal of the promises you are making to one another today. Rings are very large in their significance. They are made of a precious metal and precious stone, and that reminds us that love is not cheap or common; but indeed love is very costly and dear to us. These rings are also made in a circle and their design tells us that we must keep love continuous throughout our whole lives even as the circle of the ring is continuous. As you wear these rings, whether you are together or apart for even just a moment, may these rings be a constant reminder of the promises you are making to one another this day.”\n\n“Danny, will you please take this ring and place it upon the finger of Michelle’s left hand, and holding her hand in yours, please repeat this promise to her saying after me: With this ring, I seal my promise, to be your faithful and loving husband, as God is my witness.”\n\nDanny repeated, “With this ring, I seal my promise, to be your faithful and loving husband, as God is my witness.”\n\nRay looked at Michelle, “Michelle, will you please take this ring and place it upon the finger of Danny’s left hand, and holding his hand in yours please repeat this promise to him saying after me: With this ring, I seal my promise, to be your faithful and loving wife, as God is my witness.”\n\nMichelle repeated, “With this ring, I seal my promise, to be your faithful and loving wife, as God is my witness.”\n\n“Michelle and Danny, you have come here today before us and before God and have expressed your desire to become husband and wife. You have shown your love and affection by joining hands, and have made promises of faith and devotion, each to the other, and have sealed these promises by the giving and the receiving of the rings. Therefore, it is my privilege as a minister and by the authority given to me by the State of Illinois, I now pronounce that you are husband and wife. Danny, you may kiss your the bride.”\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce to you once again Senor and Senora Santos.”\n\nMichelle let out a little shriek as Danny suddenly swept her off her feet, with one arm under her knees and the other around her waist. He spun around to face the audience and as Michelle’s arms automatically came around Danny’s neck and he kissed her soundly.\n\nAuthor’s Note: I said at the beginning that I was withholding my initial author’s note and now you can see why. Danny and Michelle were getting ready to renew their vows at the Bauer BBQ 2014. Danny spent the night at the Bauer House to honor the tradition of not seeing the bride before the wedding. Michelle I’m sure noted that got him out of working at the BBQ and Danny responded it meant he had to make sure everything for the wedding was ready. The special thing Robbie carried in first was his tuxedo. Michelle went in from the BBQ to get ready for the wedding. Michelle and Danny are FINALLY living in their Laurel Falls House because we’ve all agreed not to mention or think about Tattoo Tony ever, ever again so it isn’t strange for them. The kids are going to spend the night at the Bauer House to watch the fireworks with Rick and Mindy, so Danny and Michelle can head out to the Springfield Inn to make some fireworks of their own. And I think then they will finally go to Majorca, but they’ll take the kids.\n\nI put in dialogue from several key Manny scenes and referenced several others. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nThat’s what I think happened at Bauer BBQ 2014. If you want to imagine what will happen during Bauer BBQ 2017.
