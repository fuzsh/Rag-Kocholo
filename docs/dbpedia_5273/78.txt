Day 19 - Crayon Candles

This is one of our most favorite reframing projects to date! These crayon candles are a great way to give a new purpose to something everyone has access to.

With the darkest day of the year almost upon us, our annual Winter Solstice celebration will be a day without electricity. Friends of ours gave us the idea a few years ago, and we’ve celebrated with only candlelight ever since. We spend the day in gratitude for the light that is available, and the time we get to spend together by the candle and firelight.

This candle making process was really quite easy. After gathering all of the broken crayons we could find, we used a knife to slit the labels and peeled them off.

Once all the crayons were naked, we spread them out on a baking sheet to see all of the colors (and keep them contained for our toddler).

Then we got to color sorting into each jar. This was a great game to play as a family, and was fun to explore all of the different tints and shades of each hue.

For wicks we used birthday candles, and learned later in the process, that they don’t need to start in the jars. It’s much easier to stick them in after the rest of the crayons are melted.

We then used our biggest stainless steel fry pan to simmer some water on the stove, hot enough to create our water bath for melting the candles. Overall they were on the stove for about 90 minutes, and we checked them regularly. We lost our first wicks in the initial melt, and stuck a second birthday candle in after we turned off the heat and before the top began to harden.

This is a fun family project that you can start and finish in an evening, and you can make just a candle or two at a time, not everyone has a giant crate of broken crayons. Let us know how it goes!
