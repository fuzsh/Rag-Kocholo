        "text": "But before you reuse or recycle all your old crayons to make Rainbow Crayons or any of the other craft projects you may want to keep some of the old crayons on hand for the tots. Using broken crayons to draw with helps children develop the correct pincer grip. Because the crayon is short it forces little fingers into the beginning of a tripod grip. It’s even better when they use the broken crayons on a vertical surface.\n\nConstruct and Then Use a Solar Oven to Make Recycled Crayons Craft Projects\n\nThis activity lends itself to many teachable moments. During our interaction we discussed the greenhouse effect, we talked about the economics of cooking using solar energy (free!) versus using other resources that are finite. This is the perfect lesson in recycling, conservation, and alternative energy sources.\n\nUse Crayons to Create Color Block Candles\n\nThese vibrantly colorful candles make fantastic DIY gifts while they reuse broken crayons to make the beautiful colors.\n\nMelted Crayon Art Project Tutorial\n\nThese gorgeous melted crayon works of art have been all over the Internet. They’re not that hard to make and really fun, although they take a lot of time\n\nPut Old Crayons to Good Use By Making Rock Art\n\nThis method of decorating rocks is super durable (Ours have been outside looking fabulous for years now.) and the children think the melting colors are magical.\n\nCrayon Stained Glass\n\nWhat do you get when you add old crayons to waxed paper? You get beautiful stained “glass”, of course!\n\nMelted Crayon Art and Pointillism\n\nThis method of painting with melted crayons is an interesting invitation for the children to explore art concepts and textures. The results are quite beautiful.\n\nRainbow Crayons Are A Fun Way to Reuse and Recycle Old Crayons\n\nGather up all of your broken crayons, and cut them into small pieces. (An adult will need to complete this step. Or you can try to break them with your fingers for a sensory activity.\n\nPreheat the oven to 250 degrees.\n\nFill the muffin tin or silicone mold with an inch-thick layer of crayon pieces.\n\nBake 15-20 minutes, or until the wax is melted.\n\nAllow the tin or mold to cool; then pop out the crayons, and they’re ready for use.\n\nWe had so much fun making ours that we made more for some non-candy Valentine’s treats!"
