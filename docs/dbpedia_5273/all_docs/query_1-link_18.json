        "text": "\"But we kindergarteners cannot hide from older kids forever. We must make peace with them. Trade Yipper cards and play together.\"\n\nâ€“ Chief Colors with Broken Crayons\n\nChief Colors with Broken Crayons is chief of the kindergarten Crayoned Tribe at Gallagher Elementary School.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nGallagher Elementary School is the wise chief of the Crayoned Tribe who believes in making peace with older students when they have not done anything bad towards kindergarteners. He has two advisers following him around. Outside of school he goes to the same soccer practice as Eggbert Eggleston, and whose father takes them out to ice cream afterwards.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGallagher Elementary School arrived in his camp after Sits in Corner captured Numbuh 2 and played a game of \"duck duck goose\" to drop the fourth grader into a pit of paste. He demanded to know what was going on, to which Sits in Corner told him the fourth grader was found in kindergarten territory, the gymnasium. The Chief asked Numbuh 2 is he was there to take their milk money, like the fourth grade president did earlier that year. Numbuh 2 informed him that James Nixon McGarfield was no longer fourth grade president, but instead Eggbert Eggleston was now the leader. The Chief mentioned how his father knew Eggbert's father, and that he takes the Chief and Eggbert out to ice cream after soccer practice. When Sits in Corner continued to press for Numbuh 2's punishment, the Chief showed understanding for his resentment of older kids after they gave Sits in Corner atomic wedgie long ago. But he still said they should make peace with the older kids, ordered Numbuh 2's release and allowed him to exit the gymnasium.\n\nHe later signed a peace treaty with President Eggbert in the school cafeteria, a neutral territory. Afterwards, the two leaders blew bubbles from pipes in the kindergarteners' camp, danced in the gymnasium and had a shared feast in the cafeteria (Operation: M.E.S.S.A.G.E.).\n\nTrivia[]"
