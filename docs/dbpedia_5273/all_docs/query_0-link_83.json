        "text": "Hello my good people! Please forgive my long absence, things have been crazy in my corner but I am hopeful that all will return to normalcy soon.\n\n“Broken crayons still color” I came across this quote some weeks ago and it spoke to me. You know how you might be going through something and you stumble on a sentence or a scripture somewhere that suddenly makes your burden much lighter? that’s what happened to me when I read this quote on my friend’s BBM update.\n\nThe fact that a crayon got broken somewhere along the way doesn’t mean it should be thrown away or discarded. The effectiveness of the crayon is not in its shape or size or whether it is intact or not its in the fact that it can still color. So maybe some happenings in your life has chipped away chunks of your self esteem, or the fact that it is the end of the year and you have little or nothing to show for it as compared to your friends and family who achieved a lot of mile stones, it can be anything that has made you feel broken inside, but do not despair, yes you might be broken but you can and will still color!\n\nDon’t write yourself off just yet, don’t close the book of your life because it seems like there are no chapters left to write, if only you know how blessed you are…the mere fact that you are alive today translates into the fact that there is hope for you. The dead has no hope, no prospects, no future, they are over and done with. You on the other hand have a lot to look forward to, avenues to learn and grow and so many opportunities coming your way, all you have to do is believe. I know this sounds like a cliche, but it is one hundred percent true.\n\nBroken crayons still color, broken dreams can still be rebuilt, never say never.\n\nHave a beautiful week!\n\nPhoto Credit: Google"
