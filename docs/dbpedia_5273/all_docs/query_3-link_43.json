        "text": "I just played this game all the way through yesterday, and it's so freaking fun and addictive. After beating all the levels, I spent half an hour just setting up this one shot from the very first level:\n\n(The five red circles at the bottom are the apples from the tree.)\n\nI also found out that if you overlap many shapes on one hinge, they go crazy and start spinning all over the place. Makes for some unusual puzzle solutions.\n\nIs that CP Deluxe? I've played the original, but I don't recall that stage at all.\n\nIt is a quite fun game. One thing I enjoyed was trying to see if I could create blocks to allow me to by-pass all the obstacles in the course at once. Okay, so I don't knock myself off, I have to put this huge block back here behind me, then I have to build this massive ramp, then drop a block on top of myself and hope that I have enough speed to climb up this incline...hehehe.\n\nP.S. Linkage\n\n[EDIT:] This is super awesome! They have come so far since the original!!\n\nYep, it's Deluxe. I tend to do a lot of wrap-the-ball-up, tie-it-to-a-weighted-pulley solutions.\n\nThe physics aren't entirely true, though...I tried revamping it as an executive ball clicker, and when I swung one apple down it would just hit the others and stop dead.\n\nFor anyone who never played it, the original didn't allow any type of shapes except rectangles. Also there was no level editor. And a lot fewer levels.\n\nAnd who cares if the physics aren't 100% true to life? It's a game heheh.\n\nQuote from: Oliwerko on Mon 12/01/2009 18:40:20\n\n...not to mention the incredible mashine series...\n\nOoooo, yeah, those were the days.\n\nAnyway, this new version of CP really looks promising, and I fondly remember the original. Sounds like a nice thing to spend a paycheck on, could any of you users give some \"biased suggestions\"?\n\nIt was hella fun. I even went back and played the levels over again after finishing. You don't find out about the special ropes and hinges and stuff you can draw until you're already partway into the game (unless it was in the instructions and I just didn't read it ), so it's cool to go back and try again knowing all the tricks. And I almost never play through games twice, so there you go, biased opinion!\n\nPlus the music is really beautiful.\n\nThe Full Version comes with 70 levels according to the web-site.\n\nThere have been some hard levels which require some brain-power, but once you figure them out, and trying different solutions, you feel a real sense of accomplishment.\n\nPlus, it is fun to try different things and watch them go completely haywire and not work.\n\nFor me, it was a blast to play yesterday after buying the full version, and then trying to work on my own levels.\n\nedit: Thank You Strange Visitor for bringing this to my attention."
