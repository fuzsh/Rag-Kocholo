        "text": "Will crayons melt in the sun? If so, how long will it take?\n\nWe set out to find the answer to that question one day with a melting crayon science experiment.\n\nIt took a bit of patience and some problem solving. But, in the end, our science brains found an answer.\n\nDisclosure: There are Amazon Affiliate and other affiliate links in this article which means, at no additional cost to you, we could receive compensation for our recommendations.

The girls thought they would melt.\n\nWe also talked a bit about the things that would help the crayons melt. We determined that we needed to put our crayons out in the bright sunlight.\n\nSet up your melting crayon science activity\n\nWe found all of our broken bits of crayons and put them in a silicon muffin tin. I found the silicon works the best, because it is easy to pop the crayons out of later.\n\nOnce we had our muffin cups filled, we took it all outside and found one of the sunniest spots in our yard.\n\nWe left the crayons bits outside for about two hours before we checked on them for the first time.\n\nThe main reason we waited that long was because while it was sunny, the temperature was only around 80 degrees F.\n\nThe crayons would melt, but slowly.\n\nIf you’re doing this on a hotter day, check it sooner! I’d recommend checking after the first 30 minutes and then every 30 minutes after.\n\nWe had some melting after 2 hours, then started checking every hour.\n\nWe recorded each of our observations on our science experiment recording sheet.\n\nAfter several hours, we had partially melted crayons and we wanted to try to speed up the process.\n\nWe did some brainstorming and decided to put our crayons in our car which was sitting in the sun.\n\nThe hot car did the trick and our crayons finished melting. Make sure you have an adult and oven mitts to remove your muffin tin from the car. It’s as hot as an oven!\n\nOur conclusion\n\nWe took our melted crayons inside and let them cool.\n\nIn the meantime, we wrote our conclusion. Yes, crayons did melt in the sun. The higher the temperature, the quicker they will melt.\n\nAfter the crayons cooled and hardened, we popped them out of the muffin tray and tried them out. Our melting crayons science activity was a success!\n\nYou may also like one of these science experiments:\n\nChemical Reactions with Pennies\n\nHockey Science Experiment\n\nHot Chocolate Science\n\nMy favorite resource for science at home\n\nHave you ever tried Green Kid Craft kids?
