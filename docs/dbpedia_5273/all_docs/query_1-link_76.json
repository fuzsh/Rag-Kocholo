        "text": "Want to make DIY crayons? Use these simple steps to get started!\n\nOur DIY crayons began with a little problem.\n\nAs my boys were doing art outside on our driveway, the crayons began to melt! Before we knew it, crayons were soft, and the colors started mixing. I guess that is what happens in July. (sigh)\n\nSo, we made lemonade out of lemons, and these DIY crayons are a home run!\n\nRELATED: Art is a large part of our every day play. We store everything we use in the Art Cart.\n\nGive life to broken crayons.\n\nSure, using broken crayons is a great way to help improve pencil grip. But once you notice more crayons in the bin than being used, bring them back to life with this fun indoor activity!\n\nRELATED: We keep these 20+ Craft Supplies on hand for endless art!\n\nAll three boys were eager to help.\n\nAfter scooping the crayons out from where they had melted, we placed them all onto the table.\n\nSome were still warm, which the boys thought was pretty neat.\n\nEven my toddler was sure to be included! It takes a steady hand to peel off each wrapper, so I was on the sidelines to help along the way. They eventually gave up on the peeling, so I pulled us all in for the homestretch. Making DIY crayons is worth it, but does require some work.\n\nRELATED: Have a big kid at home? Don’t miss out on viewing our activity cards for BIG KIDS!\n\nHow do you make homemade crayons?\n\nBefore we dive in, read this tip:\n\nThe number of crayons in each section should be equal amounts. Our blue crayons had too many and needed more time. They also bubbled over to the bottom of our oven. Next time I will place foil on the rack to prevent overspill.\n\nGather broken crayons you have around your house.\n\nFind a muffin tin or silicone trays that you do not eat from. – Either will work!\n\nBrainstorm how you want to create each new crayon. Will you blend the colors? Keep each crayon within the same color family? Perhaps you may make a homemade primary-colored crayon? Get creative!\n\nHave your children help you peel off the backing of the crayons.\n\nPlace the different pieces of crayon into the tray.\n\nPreheat the over to 200 degrees. I wait on this step because peeling and sorting the crayons took us a few days to complete. We worked in small amounts of time.\n\nPlace the muffin tin into the oven for 12-15 minutes watching the crayons melt.\n\nOnce melted, have an adult remove the DIY crayons from the oven.\n\nPut the tray on a rack to cool.\n\nOnce cooled, the homemade crayons will pop out and are ready to be used!\n\nMaterials to make homemade crayons are kept simple.\n\nDays with Grey is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program.

You can also use silicone molds to create your crayons!\n\nWe love making crayons with our alphabet and LEGO molds that are listed below.\n\nmuffin tin\n\nsilicone alphabet mold\n\nsilicone heart mold\n\nLEGO molds\n\ncrayons\n\nThese DIY crayons took a few days to make, and that was perfectly okay with me.\n\nIt takes some concentration to peel off each label. We did a handful of crayons at a time, then took a break.\n\nHaving more crayons to peel is the perfect way to regroup. After a cranky morning, we gathered back around the table to finalize the crayons in each colored section.\n\nOnce the crayons were ready to use, they were a fun new way to color!\n\nWhen will you make your own DIY crayons?"
