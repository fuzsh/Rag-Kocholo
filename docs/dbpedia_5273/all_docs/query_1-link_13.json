I had them hold two crayons at the same time, one in their palm, and one in their fingers. Then I had them draw a shape (I had circles and rainbows) with one color, manipulate the crayons in their hand to switch to the next one, and draw with the other color.\n\nThis was a challenge for all of the kids that I worked with, and I thought it would make a great home activity for the kids to do over school breaks. I made some circle paper, and some rainbow paper, and I made a home program explaining what they were supposed to be doing.\n\nMaterial:\n\nSmall broken crayons\n\npaper\n\nhome program (optional)\n\nSkills:\n\nFine motor\n\nIn-hand manipulation\n\nhandwriting\n\nSave"
