        "text": "Who doesn’t love a game of Jenga®?! It is my favorite go-to game when I am trying to build rapport with new students. It is one of those easy, light games that doesn’t call for too much thinking, allowing kids to talk freely while they play. I’ve heard some entertaining stories and have learned so much about my student’s lives during friendly games of Jenga®!\n\nNot only does Jenga® help kids to relax and open up while talking with me, but Jenga® also reveals so much about my students. Their approach to the game, how they handle losing or making mistakes, their ability to follow directions; this game allows you to gather so much information about your kids in such a short period of time.\n\nJenga® is my Favorite\n\nIf I haven’t made it clear, I love having Jenga® in my school counseling office. One summer day I decided to combine my love of Jenga® with my love of teaching calming strategies and this beauty was born.\n\nI got to feed two birds with one scone on this one; I updated a game for my office and I got to spend the afternoon crafting with my four-year-old. He actually surprised me and was quite good at gluing the labels to the Jenga® blocks.\n\nI am definitely going to outsource some crafting tasks to him in the future. Good help like this is hard to find! We knocked this craft out in about 45 minutes even with production coming to a screeching halt every time a squirrel or dog would walk by.\n\nCheck out the pictures below for the step-by-step guide on how we made this calming strategy Jenga® game!\n\nStep-by-Step Guide\n\nYou can download the labels from my TeachersPayTeachers store bit.ly/CalmingJenga\n\nThat’s pretty much it! Super easy and fun craft that takes your Jenga game to the next level!\n\nThat’s it! That’s all that stands between you and having your very own calming strategies Jenga® game! You can download the labels in my TeacherPayTeachers store or by clicking here –> bit.ly/CalmingJenga\n\nI am so excited for school to start in August so I can use these with my students! Do you have a favorite go-to game you play with students?
