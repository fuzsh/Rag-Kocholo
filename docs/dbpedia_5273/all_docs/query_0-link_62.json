        "text": "Recycling is an important concept to teach children so they are aware of the value of repurposing resources they use, even in the classroom! You can teach awareness of recycling with something as simple as creating crafts with used crayons. I just love this Melted Crayon Craft for Christmas because not only do children get a first-hand experience of repurposing old crayons, but they also get to see the value in reusing things. What better time of year to recycle than at Christmas!\n\n*Pair with our Gingerbread Centers and Activities for Pre-K & Kindergarten!\n\nMelted Crayon Craft for Christmas\n\nYour children are going to “ooh and aah” when they see the transformation of a pile of broken crayons and what it turns into. You might even marvel at it yourself! So let’s grab some broken crayons and get started!\n\nSupplies Needed:\n\nCrayons (use old broken crayons)\n\nChristmas cookie pan\n\nX-acto knife\n\nHow to Make Recycled Christmas Crayons\n\nRemove papers from old broken crayons. The easiest way is to slice through the paper with an X-acto knife (adults only).\n\nAdd them to a pile and let your kids have fun peeling the labels off. Labels should come right off. Some older crayons may have a small amount of glue residue left behind, just rub it off.\n\nIf needed, soak crayons as we did with our Halloween crayons to remove the wrappers.\n\nBreak crayons into small pieces. Sort by like colors, add to bags or small bowls, and set aside.\n\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees and fill the Christmas pan with broken crayon pieces. Make sure to fill each space to the top.\n\nPlace pan in the oven for 8-10 minutes or until the wax is completely melted. Remove pan from oven and let cool on the counter for 25-30 minutes.\n\nRELATED RESOURCE: December Sight Word Games and Centers\n\nPlace cooled pan in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. Cold crayons will pop right out of the mold.\n\nYour crayons are finished and ready to use!\n\nLet your kids color with them to create beautiful Christmas coloring pages, or give them as gifts!\n\nIn the classroom, I like to give each of my students one as a gift, or we use them for writers workshop to create fun pictures with.\n\nHowever you use them, your kiddos are sure to love them!\n\nWant unlimited access to even MORE of our activities and resources?
