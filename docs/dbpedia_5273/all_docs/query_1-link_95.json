        "text": "With Halloween just around the corner, you may be planning a fall party with your students, or looking for some ideas for party favors for your own kids to hand out. Even if you don’t have a classroom party coming up, one thing you likely do have in your room is old or broken crayons lying around. Instead of throwing them out – recycle them into fun party favors like these Halloween melted crayons! Kids will love coloring with them and taking them home for something special to keep. Don’t celebrate Halloween? Just apply this same concept to a fall pumpkin version!\n\n*Pair with our Halloween Centers and Activities for Pre-K & Kindergarten!\n\nHalloween Melted Crayons\n\nPrep for this Halloween project is simple! You really only need just a few supplies to start melting crayons and making new fun crayon shapes!\n\nCrayons (preferably old or broken ones)\n\nHalloween silicone mold\n\nOven access (They are best to make at home and then bring to school, but you could have your kids help you prep by breaking up the crayons – they enjoy that!)\n\nMaking the Halloween Melted Crayons\n\nReady to make some old crayons new? Start by placing the old crayons in a large bowl and filling it with warm water.\n\nLet them soak for 20-30 minutes and begin removing the wrappers. Repeat soaking if needed until wrappers are completely removed.\n\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees and pat the crayons dry. Then break the crayons into smaller pieces and place them in the silicone molds.\n\nRELATED RESOURCE: October Print-That’s It! Kindergarten Math and Literacy Printables\n\nOnce the broken crayons are in the silicone molds, bake for 8-12 minutes or until melted.\n\nWhen they are melted, remove them from the oven and let them cool.\n\nYou should see fun, swirly colors like the picture above if you used mixed crayons.\n\nOnce they are cooled, pop the crayons out of the molds and they are ready to use!\n\nYou can hand them out to your students as is, or put them in baggies with a fun Halloween pencil, toy, or treat – however you wish.\n\nYour kids will love coloring with these and watching the colors change as they work their way through the fun shaped crayons!\n\nWant unlimited access to even MORE of our activities and resources?
