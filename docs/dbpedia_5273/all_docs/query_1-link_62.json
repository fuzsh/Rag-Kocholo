What a better day than to share our DIY Rainbow Crayon Play Dough recipe? It’s one of our many crayon play dough recipes that we have here on the site.\n\nWe first made our crayon play dough recipe to go along with a book activity that called for purple play dough. But when the kids started playing with this dough every single day? I loved it for the fine motor benefits. My kids just thought it was cool to make play dough from old crayons. I knew we had to make a few other colors.\n\nAnd that turned into every color of the rainbow.\n\nThis Crayon play dough recipe is so easy, that you’ll want to make it in every shade, too.

I didn’t get a chance to take many action shots. With the heat of the stove, hot oil, and chopping up the crayon bits, this is a job for the mamas or papas rather than helpful kids. Older children certainly could do this recipe. I wasn’t able to take pictures while making our dough. 🙁\n\nYou can see how the crayons were chopped in our Harold and the Purple Crayon post that inspired more colors of play dough. Start by chopping up your crayons into pieces. This is where your broken crayons will come in handy.

If you read our Harold and the Purple Crayon post, you saw that we used 2 and a half chopped up crayons for the full recipe as well. When I halved the ingredients, I kept the amount of crayons and we got bright, bold colors for our dough. Perfect for playing!\n\nFirst, chop up 2 and a half crayons.\n\nIn a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (flour, salt, cream of tartar)\n\nNext, heat the oil in a pan. Add the chopped crayons. Stir until the crayons are completely melted. Slowly stir in 2 cups of water while stirring. Certain types of crayons will either make a clumpy and gooey looking liquid. Other types will make a smooth liquid once the water is added. Either way is fine. Just keep stirring.\n\nSlowly, stir in the dry ingredients. The dough will pull together in a ball over the heat. Once the dough pulls together, dump it out onto a cutting board or counter. Let the dough cool until you can tolerate kneading. Knead the dough for a few minutes until smooth.\n\nRELATED READ: Play Dough for Proprioception\n\nThis dough is such a soft dough but is it is still a great way to incorporate fine motor skills and strengthening in a vividly colorful way.
