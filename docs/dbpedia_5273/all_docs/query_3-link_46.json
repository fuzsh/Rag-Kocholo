But when he opens his box of crayons, he finds only letters, all saying the same thing: His crayons have had enough! They quit! Beige Crayon is tired of playing second fiddle to Brown Crayon.

The only obstacle was that I couldn’t think of a thing. I looked around the room for my answer… hoping somehow that it would be written on the wall or the desk or the floor, I suppose. There was my battered old computer, but I didn’t think kids wanted a book about that. There was a stack of bills, but I knew moms and dads wouldn’t sleep well after reading that bedtime story.\n\nBut then I saw them, like a beacon on a hill… there, on my desk, sat an ancient box of my old crayons next to the hula girl pen holder my grandpa had left me in his will. I didn’t remember buying the crayons, or even why I had them. I didn’t have kids yet, so they were definitely my crayons. And at the time, I couldn’t for the life of me remember the last time I had colored. Crayons are so ubiquitous, aren’t they? They just show up everywhere, under couch cushions, behind the dresser, in the junk drawer. But here was a box I’d aparently kept with me, moving them with all my office stuff from apartment to apartment. So yeah… there they were. And I just knew they had a story to tell.\n\nI’d been writing dialogue for movies and TV for over ten years at that point and thought, hmm… what if I draw on my strengths? What if I gave each crayon a monologue about how they felt about my coloring habits? I bet they’d give me an earful.\n\nSo I poured the crayons out on the table and decided to let them each tell their own tale. The crayons on my desk that night looked exactly like their counterparts in the book eventually would. Peach had it’s wrapper peeled off, blue was stumpy and clearly a favorite, purple was unused and just seemed especially fastidious to me. And that’s how it went all down the line. Each crayon told me their story and I dutifully transcribed their praises, complaints and concerns.\n\nIt’s a funny thing. I’m a sentimental type and I kept those crayons, even to this day. And since I wrote the manuscript all those years ago, I’ve continued moving them from apartment to apartment and finally to our current home, where they still keep me company in my studio.\n\nThe companion to the #1 blockbuster bestseller, The Day the Crayons Quit!\n\nDuncan’s crayons sure are a colorful bunch of characters! Having soothed the hurt feelings of one group who threatened to quit, Duncan now faces a whole new group of crayons asking to be rescued. From Maroon Crayon, who was lost beneath the sofa cushions and then broken in two after Dad sat on him; to poor Turquoise, whose head is now stuck to one of Duncan’s stinky socks after they both ended up in the dryer together; to Pea Green, who knows darn well that no kid likes peas and who ran away—each and every crayon has a woeful tale to tell and a plea to be brought home to the crayon box.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nA Wall Street Journal Best Children’s Book of 2015 / A TIME Magazine Top 10 Children’s Book of 2015\n\n“Highly anticipated (yes, even for adults)” —Entertainment Weekly\n\nWinner of the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Picture Book of 2015!\n\nA Wall Street Journal Best Book of 2015!\n\nOne of Parents Magazine‘s Ten Best Children’s Books of 2015!\n\nA Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year!\n\n“Funnier than the creators’ original blockbuster.”–Parents Magazine\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n“Mr. Daywalt’s text blends with Mr. Jeffers’s illustrations to make a picture book that will have children clamoring for more crayon adventures.”—The Wall Street Journal\n\n“Continues its predecessor’s pleasing, goofy conceit…Once again, both Daywalt’s text and Jeffers’ illustrations are endearing.”—New York Times Book Review\n\n“By telling stories from the points of view of crayons, giving voices to the small and ignored, Daywalt and Jeffers have created two books that offer plenty of charm and fun, but also make children feel deeply understood.”—The Boston Globe\n\n* “A masterwork of humor and design . . .

I remember getting a call from my publisher after The Day the Crayons Quit came out and he asked me if I had any ideas for a sequel. I told him that sadly I did not. I had only intended the book to be a one off. He was sad, because publishers love sequels to blockbuster books, and said for me to call him if inspiration struck.\n\nNot too long after that, inspiration did indeed strike.\n\nWhile walking into my living room one morning, cup of coffee in hand, I saw that my pug dog Sam had thrown up all over the rug. Sam, you see, loved to eat things he shouldn’t eat, and then throw them up in as many hidden little places around the house as he could, like some kind of awful aberration of the Easter Bunny.\n\nAnd on this day, he’d eaten crayons.\n\nAnd thrown them up.\n\nOn our light beige carpet.\n\nI stood there looking at the not-quite-a-rainbow-mess in disgust, when my wife looked over and saw my expression, and asked what was wrong.\n\n“Ughh,” I sighed, “Sam ate something and threw up on the rug again. Crayons this time.”\n\n“Ewww,” she replied, “I’ll get the carpet cleaner.”\n\n“Wait!” I said, “That’s it!”\n\n“That’s what?”\n\n“That’s my next book!” I yelped gleefully, “If the other crayons were all bent out of shape over how they were being used, imagine how THESE ones feel??!”\n\n“Good,” she said, “then you can clean it up,” and she handed me the cleaner and the paper towels.\n\nAnd that’s how The Day The Crayons Came Home was born. After cleaning up Sam’s mess that day, I would go on to write of all the poor crayons in our life that we’ve lost, abused and broken over the years. I felt it was the least I could do for them.\n\nAnd boy did Duncan get an earful.\n\nThe ending of the book came to me from the philosophy of my parents. Dad was a fireman, and mom was a nurse and they spent their lives caring for people. And they always told me to help people and make room for them if they needed it. We had a great number of people who stayed with us over the years, my parents helping them out while they were down on their luck. And that’s what I wanted Duncan to do. I wanted him to provide a loving home for the crayons, as well as the respect they deserved. So for that part of the book, thanks Mom, thanks Dad. I love you guys.\n\nThe Legend of Rock Paper Scissors is a laugh-out-loud hilarious picture book and superhero style origin story for the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors!\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nNew York Times Bestseller! 5 Starred Reviews! \"Will have listeners in stitches.\" —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\n\nNew York Times Bestseller! 5 Starred Reviews!\n\n\"Will have listeners in stitches.\" —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\n\n\"Purely absurd, sidesplitting humor.\" —Booklist (starred review)\n\n\"Demands bombastic, full-volume performances.\" —Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n\"Perfect for a guffawing share with younger sibs or buddy read.\" —BCCB (starred review)\n\n\"The sort of story that makes children love to read.\" —School Library Journal (starred review)\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n★ “Cheeky humor and prideful asides will have listeners in stitches.

They would both simultaneously say, “One, two, three, GO!” Then one would cheer victoriously and the other would groan or say, “Okay, best out of three!”\n\nThe game sounded super familiar, so I looked in the rear view mirror and asked Abby, “Are you guys playing rock, paper, scissors?”\n\nAnd she said, “Yeah Dad! It’s this new game we invented at school!”\n\nI laughed and explained to them that I used to play it too. I also told them how the game was older even than me, older even than their Lola, (their grandma)! It totally blew their minds. I realized then and there that I wanted to write a fun superhero-style origin story for this game that’s as old as the ages.\n\nWhen BB-8 is separated from his master, Poe Dameron, on the lonely desert planet of Jakku, he has no choice but to keep rolling. It’s all up to him to get a top-secret map back to the Resistance so they can find Luke Skywalker and save the galaxy from the evil First Order.\n\nIt’s scary to have a big job when you’re just a little droid on your own. But BB-8 isn’t alone for long. As he speeds across the sand, BB-8 meets all kinds of strangers who need his help. Should he do good things, as Poe always told him, or will that get in the way of his mission?\n\nSee how everyone’s favorite little astromech droid makes friends and foils enemies in this funny and exciting new Star Wars adventure!\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nMy Inspiration for the book\n\nI saw the first Star Wars film in the theater in 1977 when I was seven years old, and it was one of the main reasons I wanted to become a storyteller when I grew up. So when Disney called and asked if I wanted to write a piece of THE FORCE AWAKENS in picture book form, I couldn’t say yes fast enough! I love all the Star Wars characters, but BB-8 especially. There’s a pureness and a kindness to him. I think he has one of the strongest moral compasses in the entire series, so I knew I wanted his journey on Jakku to be one of kindness, empathy and self sacrifice. I wanted him to give things up for others at every turn, and at the very moment when he thinks all is lost, the universe steps in and rewards him for all of his sacrifices.\n\nA thank you gift from Drew to all the children who have loved and supported his work, this special book has letters, games, ornaments, a poster, and even a pop-up Christmas tree!\n\n'Tis the season for all of us to write our holiday wish lists.
