        "text": "After 27 years, the crayon color dandelion is taking a retirement, making way for an upstart in the blue family, officials with the crayon company Crayola said on Friday.\n\nThis was not the first time the company has retired colors.\n\nIn 1990, eight shades — maize, lemon yellow, blue gray, raw umber, green blue, orange red, orange yellow and violet blue — were retired and eight new ones, including the yellow hue known as dandelion, were introduced. In 2003, four other colors were taken out and four new ones introduced.\n\nCrayola this week counted down the days leading up to its formal announcement of dandelion’s retirement on Friday and posted teases on social media that sounded more like a promotion about the pending demise of a soap opera character: “One will say goodbye!”\n\nHeather Brame posted that she was watching the announcement as it was broadcast live on Facebook. “Sitting here watching this Crayola announcement instead of cleaning,” she wrote. “We are supposed to be adults but we are all here waiting to know what crayon is leaving.”\n\nThe strong attachments to a color came as no surprise to Mark Bieri, a manager at DaVinci Artist Supply on West 21st Street in Manhattan.\n\n“People are very attached to a particular color,” he said on Friday. “It’s very personal.”\n\nHe said when a manufacturer discontinues a particular paint color “there’s always a reaction.”\n\nAs for the staying power and interest in crayons, Mr. Bieri noted that adult coloring books have gained a following. And then there are the childhood memories evoked by holding a box of crayons, as Mr. Bieri was doing during a telephone interview.\n\n“I remember having a large box of colors like this as a kid,” he said. “When you open that box, it has that nostalgic smell.”"
