Make these melted crayon hearts today.\n\nAre you looking for an easy way to upgrade your kid‚Äôs class valentine cards this year? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve used the store bought boxes of valentines more times than I can count but this year I was feeling crafty. Plus I found a cheap heart shaped silicone mold at Walmart so I thought what the heck, let‚Äôs make some DIY Valentine‚Äôs Day Cards. Using some cheap supplies including old crayons, a heart shaped mold, and a printer you can make the cutest melted crayon heart valentine‚Äôs day cards ever.\n\nThese melted crayon hearts are a great alternative to candy valentines, which I know all teachers appreciate. So grab your bag of broken crayons (we all have them in the back of a drawer somewhere) and let‚Äôs make Melted Crayon Hearts this Valentine‚Äôs Day.\n\nCheck Out More Melted Crayon Art Ideas Here!\n\nEasy Tip to Remove Crayon Wrappers\n\nOk, before we get started, let me tell you I almost gave up on this project. After about 5 minutes of peeling the paper off of our crayons, I quickly turned to Pinterest for any sort of crayon paper peeling hack. I wish knew this simple hack to remove crayon paper before I got started for the sake of my finger nails and my sanity.\n\nSo here‚Äôs a tip to save you the headache! Make sure to soak your crayons in some warm water for about 5 minutes before attempting to peel the paper off. The warmer the water the better. After the crayons soak for a few minutes, the paper should peel right off!\n\nHow To Make Melted Crayon Hearts\n\n1. Peel paper off of crayons and break or cut them into small pieces.\n\n2. Fill a heart shaped silicone mold with the broken crayons. Here‚Äôs where you can get creative with your color combinations. I just mixed all of the crayons together but you can sort your crayons into various color combos for each melted heart if desired.\n\n3. Bake the crayons in the heart shaped mold at 250¬∞F for 10-15 minutes or until the crayons are fully melted.\n\n4. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before popping the crayon hearts out of the mold.\n\nThe Cutest Valentine‚Äôs Day Cards Ever\n\nNow that you‚Äôve made these fun melted crayon hearts, it‚Äôs time to make Valentine‚Äôs Day cards. Kids love coloring with the heart shaped crayons and I love that this is the perfect alternative to candy valentines. Grab the free printable Valentine‚Äôs Day cards here! Print and cut out the desired number of Valentines. Then, simply use a small dot a hot glue to attach the crayon heart to the card.\n\nI bought these clear self sealing cellophane bags to put our melted crayon heart valentines in. Just incase the crayon hearts pop off of the valentine, the bag keeps everything together!( 4√ó6 inch bags are the perfect fit for these free printable valentines day cards!)\n\nYour kids will love these melted crayon hearts!
