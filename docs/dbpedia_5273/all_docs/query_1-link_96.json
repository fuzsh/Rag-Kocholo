It’s also an art and science activity too.\n\nI’ll be honest, I’ve been guilty a time or two of wanting to just get rid of those old broken crayons. Purchasing a fresh new box with all its colorful and equal-sized glory is so tempting.

Let them dry and harden.\n\nAren’t these melted crayons gorgeous?\n\nHow to melt crayons in the microwave\n\nStep 1: Peel the paper crayon wrappings from each crayon.\n\nStep 2: Break crayons and place the crayons in a paper cup.\n\nStep 3: Put the mold into the microwave for about 4 minutes. How long it takes depends on your microwave. It could take longer or shorter than 4 minutes. You want to make sure your crayon is in a liquid form before you take it out.\n\nStep 4: Pour the melted liquid into your silicone molds.\n\nStep 5: Once they are hard and dry you can pop them out.\n\nTo make them cool off faster you can pop them into the freezer for 30 minutes.\n\nHow to remove the wrapper from crayons\n\nYou can peel them off dry with your fingers.\n\nAdd them to a bowl of water and let the water soften the paper so it’s easier to peel.\n\nUse a knife to cut off the paper.\n\nAren’t these melted crayons gorgeous?

This is when something cannot be reversed back to what it was.\n\nCrayon Silicone Molds\n\nOne thing that’s great about silicone crayon molds is that you can create crayons according to a variety of themes.
