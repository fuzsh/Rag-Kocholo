        "text": "Hope you’ve had a good Christmas,\n\nand my present to you, an extra long episode\n\nof WRUTSL, reflecting a rather tricky period\n\non a personal level from mid to late 2007.\n\nWell, in the months just before I was sectioned,\n\nI thought it was the best period of my life,\n\nand over-optimistic radio listening habits\n\nwere partly to blame.\n\nAfter being given recovery meds, I realised\n\nthat things were not all rosy, and my manic state\n\nmeant I had to spend one more year at university,\n\nhaving been taken ill for the first semester\n\nin late ’07.\n\nWhich wasn’t a bad thing in hindsight,\n\nbut when you’re on a massive low,\n\nit’s hard to see any positives.\n\nThis is also the only episode this series where\n\nwe’ll be heading North so enjoy it for what it’s worth.\n\nAnyway, let’s begin our festive flow through\n\nthe radio of almost ten years ago.\n\n(Goodness it’s shot by…)\n\nStarting off in Sheffield and Hallam FM’s\n\n“School Years” introduced with the\n\nNatasha Bedingfield inspired ID from the\n\nReelworld custom that had been airing\n\nfor a couple of years.\n\nSwiftly followed by a clever sounding sweeper\n\ninvolving one of the JAM “Metroline” resings\n\nfrom over a decade earlier.\n\nThe use of old jingles prompted a chat on\n\nJinglemad, which in turn lead to the discussion\n\nof a short lived jingle package for Hallam FM\n\nin mid 1999 by Jonathan Colling’s Octagon Music,\n\nas heard below.\n\nhttps://robinblamires26.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/8sidestohallam.mp3\n\nYep, just the right amount of EQ and modulation\n\non those vocals.\n\nReplacing a TM Century package, the brief was\n\nto fit in better with the music played, but the\n\npresenters hated it, and even Colling himself\n\nthought the melody logo sounded like a football chant.\n\nStill, at least the then programme controller\n\nAnthony Gay learned from it, as he’s now\n\nrunning Reelworld Europe in Salford.\n\nReelworld back in ’07 had recently resung the\n\nHallam package for Essex FM, their first proper\n\njingle package since the days of ALFA’s\n\n“Power Positive” custom, which in turn\n\nhappens to be my most-searched-for\n\nholy grail jingle package.\n\nWhich is interesting as the man behind that,\n\nformer Essex Radio PD Paul Chantler, made\n\na surprise visit back to Essex FM, (now in\n\nChelmsford) in August that year, to surprise\n\nMartin Day and his “Random iPod” for a BBC 2\n\n“Lakesiders” reunion series, transmitted almost\n\nexactly a year after it was filmed.\n\nAnd filmed exactly a week before I was sectioned.\n\nI wouldn’t like to think “The Boss” was\n\npart-responsible for my over-optimistic\n\nradio thoughts around this time, but we’ll\n\ngo onto that later in the blog when he tipped\n\nme off to a happy place in Hull…\n\nYou could suggest that Martin’s “Random iPod”\n\nwas the first of the many “lets play random old songs\n\nbecause it’s Friday!” strands now commonplace\n\non radio, predating Moyles’ Golden Hour, the Nixtape,\n\nand not forgetting Steve Wright’s “Serious Jockin”.\n\nNot matter how hard we try to do so.\n\nAt 2.35, a Saturday afternoon with Sam (Impey)\n\nat Mix 107 in South Bucks, a presenter whose\n\nlove of radio started after being driven to school\n\nin a 2-Ten FM Black Thunder.\n\nMix 107 the station, started off on AM,\n\nliterally called ElevenSeventy AM.\n\nAttempting to borrow a cue from 210, let’s say\n\nthey ended up the same way as the Reading station’s\n\npresent state on 210 meters.\n\nYou have to love The Local Radio Company’s\n\n“Big Fun Weekend” branding exercise, which\n\nsounds like something Chris Moyles would have\n\nmade a spoof trailer for in his drivetime days\n\nat Radio 1, devoting a whole weekend to the hits\n\nof Mark, Jason and Phil.\n\nWait, they had more than one?\n\nI’ve broken my own rule in this episodes of\n\nnot including my own on-air mentions though\n\nthere’s a good reason in this case.\n\nSam happened to be another element of my\n\n“happy summer” as she was a radio student\n\nin the year below me, and in the last week of\n\nbroadcasting before Summer, I asked if she wanted\n\nto help co-host my summer soul special, as she\n\nwas stuck in a day-job during the rest of the week.\n\nAt the time I thought it was the best radio I had ever made.\n\nThough as you’ll hear above, it’s probably\n\nno surprise as to why I later got sectioned…\n\nI was longing for the “magic” to return, confident\n\nit would rekindle again back at uni in September\n\nbut it wasn’t to be.\n\nThe fortunes of Mix 107 fared even worse,\n\nwith Sam losing her show to networked TLRC\n\nprogramming the following year, (defeating the\n\npurpose of the company name) and the station\n\nshutting down altogether on July 1st 2009.\n\nThe rather swift exit can be heard here, and\n\nOFCOM weren’t in a rush to push the off switch,\n\nwere they?\n\nIt meant Jazz FM had to find new studios, as on\n\nbeing sold from GMG, they broadcast from\n\nMix 107’s High-Wycombe building.\n\nThough that’s something we’ll cover\n\nin greater detail in episode 12.\n\nSave for a brief return in front of the mic\n\nat Folkestone’s Academy FM in 2011, Sam’s\n\nnow switched to working behind the scenes\n\nat the rather swish sounding Monocle 24\n\nonline radio station.\n\nWednesday the 18th of July 2007 saw BBC staff\n\nget a massive bollocking from Director General\n\nMark Thompson over their competition cover ups,\n\nwhich from midnight that night saw all of them\n\nsuspended, pending a “strategic review”.\n\nShows ranging from Jo Whiley on Radio 1,\n\nLiz Kershaw on 6 Music, and as revealed later on,\n\neven Tony Blackburn’s show on BBC London had\n\nbeen caught out deceiving listeners, by faking\n\nwinners, and running supposedly live competitions\n\nin pre-recorded shows.\n\nAnd this was just the radio side of the deception.\n\nMy first immediate thoughts were\n\n“well Steve Wright’s fucked then…”,\n\nand 8 years on “The Big Quiz” still hasn’t\n\nmade a return to the airwaves.\n\nIf anyone was being punished it was the\n\nviewers/listeners, subjected to poor substitutes\n\nand compromises such as “Celebrity Popmaster”\n\nas mentioned in the last blog.\n\nWith regards to Radio 1, it came at very bad timing,\n\nmidway into the 2007 “Six Weeks Of Summer”\n\npromotion, which carried on as normal but with\n\nthe DJs themselves undertaking the tasks as mentioned\n\nat 7.12, over the impressive “Fresh Prince” inspired bed,\n\nfrom a set of six (one per destination) from Music 4.\n\n(You’ve got to also love the Radio 1 sonic logo\n\nplayed by ice cream chimes)\n\nEven worse timing when taking into account\n\nthis, from that very morning’s “Carpark Catchphrase”.\n\nhttps://robinblamires26.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/cpc-1807071.wav\n\nFamous last words and so on.\n\nLuckily for Moyles, him and the team would be\n\nheading off on their two week summer holiday\n\nthat Friday, where on return they would be\n\nintroducing a few new features, much needed\n\nwhat with the inadvertent suspension of Roy Walker.\n\nOne of them trailed at 9.35 over the rather cute\n\nsounding theme tune to the CBeebies series\n\n“Charlie And Lola”, being another feature\n\nseemingly “borrowed” from the channel,\n\n“Birthday Corner”.\n\nAs you’ll hear later on, the theme for\n\nBirthday Corner itself was just as cute.\n\nIt’s rather amusing, knowing that later in\n\nthe year, one of the team would star in a show\n\non CBeebies himself, with newsreader Dom\n\nplaying the voice of traffic reporter “Zorst”\n\non the Saturday morning series “Space Pirates”.\n\nWhich had an even better theme tune, as penned\n\nand sung by Busted keyboard player Chris Banks,\n\nand released as a Christmas single championed\n\nby Moyles, but to little chart success.\n\nThough it did spawn a rather impressive remix\n\nfrom Chris Banks himself, showing off the endless\n\npossibilities of Pro Tools in action.\n\nDom’s own feature bows out after\n\njust over three years, the final “One Road Travel”\n\nat 11.35.\n\nShortly followed by the rarely used (moreso after\n\nthe Golden Hour started) “Back in two weeks!”\n\nshow closer, and it must be said that Jo Whiley’s\n\n“Helloooo!” at 13.49 although not as regular an occurrence,\n\nwas far less painful than Fearne Cotton’s “Mooorniiiing!“.\n\nOne of many reasons I went off the show\n\naround 2010, not to mention Tina Daheley\n\nscreaming “It’s McFlyDaaaaayyyy!”.\n\nI happened to be at Yalding House myself on that\n\nvery wet July Friday, observing behind the scenes\n\nof Newsbeat where the mood was still upbeat and\n\nthe team, especially Georgina Bowman and\n\nstudio manager Derek Knight were really delightful.\n\nDominic Byrne was nice too, but sadly the\n\nthen editor Rod McKenzie was missing in action\n\nthat morning.\n\nI’d no idea I’d be working with one of their\n\nformer staff Micky Curling 6 years later,\n\nthough it’s worrying, knowing that I may be\n\na worse radio anorak than he is.\n\nIf you’re reading this Micky, we’ll be heading\n\nto one of your old radio haunts in Reading shortly.\n\nBefore that, a brief stopover North once again,\n\nand BBC Radio York’s Friday night Soul Show\n\nhosted by Jamie Wilkinson at 13.58.\n\nDeprived of such a show on BBC Radio Kent,\n\nthis was an enjoyable listen, of which I was tipped\n\noff by a mate at uni who was a producer at\n\nRadio York, nowadays producing Jo Whiley\n\non BBC Radio 2.\n\nThe jingles are by Maximum Production who at the time\n\nalso produced IDs for BBC Radio Lincolnshire,\n\nand BBC Radio Gloucestershire amongst others.\n\n2007 also saw the evolution (in loose terms)\n\nof GCap’s “OneNetwork” with new station logos\n\nthat bore the slogan “Haven’t You Heard?”\n\nand what was quite an oddity for many ex GWR\n\nstations, a sung jingle package produced by\n\nMusic 4 that began airing from the 1st of August.\n\nBoth those subject areas are talked about\n\nin detail in this blog, though there is audio in this\n\nepisode of the jingles being used on Reading’s\n\n2-Ten FM at 17.15, which fitted well into the name,\n\ndespite the logo sounding identical to that\n\nof Real Radio.\n\nThough in fairness to Sandy, the logo did\n\nalso appear years earlier, on the Vibe custom\n\npackage for Bradford’s “The Pulse”.\n\nThe news and traffic intros oddly enough weren’t\n\nadapted to fit each station, with all of them\n\nkeeping the same three note logo.\n\nThe package itself was co-written by Dave Bethell,\n\nwho also became the OneNetwork male imaging\n\nvoice, replacing Dave Kelly after 7 years.\n\nThough the voice of Flynn on CBBC’s “50/50”\n\ndid occasionally re-appear on some stations.\n\nHosting breakfast during this period were\n\nFoxy and Tom, AKA John Fox and Tom Rhys,\n\npoached from Viking FM the year before after\n\na four year stint at breakfast in Hull where they\n\ntook over from “Hirsty’s Morning Glory”.\n\nThey even brought along their “Chas And Dave”\n\ninspired jingles also produced by Music 4, which\n\nremained until the OneNetwork package went to air.\n\nIt’s a good thing they didn’t join GCap two years\n\nearlier when Neil Fox was still present, as he\n\nsupposedly had a thing about people within the\n\nCapital Group sharing his surname, with Mark Fox\n\nat Invicta FM having to change his on-air name\n\nto the even more ironic Mark Anthony.\n\nIn November that year Tom parted company,\n\nand eventually newsreader Guiliano Casadei\n\nbecame Foxy’s right hand man, with the duo\n\nnowadays heard on breakfast at Birmingham’s\n\nFree Radio.\n\nOn-air promotions for the “Fugitive” competition\n\ncan be heard at 20.42, a much reprised competition\n\nthroughout the decade even heard on EMAP\n\nand UKRD stations at one time.\n\nAt 23.40, a station that became a trigger in the\n\nongoing build of my over-optimism, the newly\n\nlaunched KCFM for Hull and East Yorkshire\n\nbroadcasting on 99.8, and online, going on air\n\nfittingly enough on Yorkshire Day,\n\nthe 1st of August 2007.\n\nThe station named after Kingston Communications,\n\none of the backers and telecom providers\n\nto the Hull area.\n\nI was told about the station via Paul Chantler,\n\na shareholder who knew too well that I loved jingles,\n\nand in the same way as his station in Southend did\n\n7 summers earlier, they were an entrance to\n\na radio station that felt equally amazing to\n\nlisten to, and feel involved with.\n\nDespite being as far away as possible from the broadcast area.\n\nThey’d followed the lead from Viking Radio\n\n23 years earlier by launching with a really strong\n\nID package, though rather than nip down\n\nto nearby Selby, they went to Dallas and the\n\nTM Studios (or JonesTM as they were in 2007)\n\npurchasing a resing of “KVIL Signature”\n\nwritten a couple of years earlier for\n\nthe station in Dallas, Texas.\n\nViking FM at the same time were airing\n\na custom package also from TM,that\n\nlater ended up near my neck of the woods\n\nresung on KMFM, and fitting in well.\n\nBack on subject and the KCFM jingles were\n\na very good set of IDs filled with transitions,\n\nsolos, real instruments, fantastic chord progressions,\n\nand a warmth throughout.\n\nNot to mention the inclusion of jock cuts.\n\n(And shouts!)\n\nKCFM made prominent use of sung jingles on air,\n\neven to segue two songs together, especially as\n\nthere were no sweepers or voiced IDs.\n\nI initially thought that Chantler had an influence\n\non the jingles though as pointed out by TM’s then\n\nhead honcho Chris Stevens it was Station Manager\n\nTim Jibson, and Head Of Presentation Al Dupres\n\nwho chose the jingles and wrote the lyrics,\n\nwhich apparently took four months to do so!\n\nDupres even using the opportunity to have\n\na couple of the cuts sung with his name personally!\n\nAs well as the KVIL package, there’s also a nice\n\ncustom news intro that can be heard at 27.43.\n\nHaving heard the KVIL news intro on the demo,\n\nit’s understandable as to why they went for\n\ntheir own one.\n\nAn almost similar situation to the one demoed\n\nfor BBC Radio 2 from LA, nine years earlier.\n\nThe one that went on air, being a prime example of\n\na great news intro.\n\nThough when I did get sectioned, I was woken up\n\nby subconsciously hearing the KCFM news intro\n\nin my sleep, even though I didn’t have\n\nany internet access.\n\nThat aside, it may be my favourite TM Century\n\njingle package resung for a UK station, apart from\n\nof course Invicta FM’s “Steamroller” IDs.\n\nAs mentioned a few times in this blog, the jingles\n\nare just part of what adds up to a really good\n\nradio station, and KCFM seemed to have it all on launch.\n\nWhat some viewed as maybe too ambitious\n\nand too big judging by how the station fared over\n\nthe years to come.\n\nThese included a 24 hour local news service,\n\n(which itself was scaled down by December ’07),\n\nand sports commentaries of Hull City football,\n\nand Hull FC Super League rugby matches from the\n\nKC Stadium as well as Hull Kingston Rovers over\n\nat the KC Lightstream Stadium.\n\nThat and a very wide selection of music\n\nthroughout the day containing lesser\n\nheard surprises from all decades.\n\nAt the time it became pretty much my\n\ngo-to station, choosing to listen to little else,\n\nwhich at the time felt very out of character.\n\nThe first of the presenters heard is Steve Jordan,\n\npoached from Magic 1161 to host breakfast,\n\nand the Thursday night 80s show\n\nwhich we’ll hear later on.\n\nA sort of old-school sounding breakfast show\n\nwith sound effects a-plenty (28.08), which\n\nwhen listening post-meds, isn’t too comfortable\n\na listen.\n\nPrior to sectioning however, it sounded like\n\nthe best radio ever.\n\nSteve at 25.00 presides over an interview with\n\nJon Culshaw, a veteran of Viking FM along with\n\nmany other KC presenters, who comes across\n\never warm, even if the impressions lacked wit.\n\nAt the time, “Dead Ringers” had finished\n\nit’s television run in a not untimely manner.\n\nIt was funny to start with on the radio, but it\n\nsoon became a case of too many sketches\n\nstating the obvious, as ridiculed brilliantly\n\nby Richard Herring in his “Menage A Un” stand-up.\n\nNot to mention a reliance on “If in doubt,\n\nthrow in some random song lyrics“.\n\nTraits still prevailing in the revived series\n\non BBC Radio 4.\n\nAs well as Culshaw, the then England football\n\nmanager and utter twazzock (“wally with the brolly”\n\nis far too kind) Steve McClaren was one of the special\n\nguests on launch, officially opening\n\nthe station’s studios.\n\nHe was probably stopping off in Hull, before\n\ngetting a ferry to Holland in order to brush up\n\non his Dutch accent.\n\nAt 31.07, we hear from mid-morning presenter\n\nClare Westwood formerly of Stray FM and TFM.\n\nShe reminded me of former CBBC presenter\n\nKirsten O’Brien, and it was nice to hear a\n\nfemale presenter on mid-mornings\n\nwith the warmth that Jo Whiley and\n\nEdith Bowman could only dream of.\n\nAlthough the audio was recorded on a Friday,\n\nClare would soon be hosting a shorter show\n\non that day of the week, owing to a syndicated show\n\nfrom Dave Lee Travis.\n\nThankfully, his slot was taken over by\n\nTony Blackburn the following January.\n\nAround the same time, Clare was moved\n\nfrom the rather lengthy 10am-2pm slot to\n\na 1-4pM afternoon show before departing\n\nthe station altogether one year to the day\n\nit launched, in August 2008.\n\nI’ve still got the rather nice e-mail\n\nshe sent me, on the day of her departure.\n\nOther presenters on launch included\n\n“Crown Jules” with the Rock Show and\n\nnewcomer Rosie Madison, now co-hosting\n\nThe Danny Mylo Show on Pulse 1 in Bradford.\n\nA trail for Al Dupres’s show can be heard at 33.29,\n\nwhere to start with the station used the promo\n\ntheme from the jingle package a bit too literally,\n\nas it’s also heard to trail both Steve Jordan’s show\n\nat 46.19 and future KCFM programme\n\ncontroller Shaun Tilley’s Sunday evening\n\nretro chart show at 44.17.\n\nThey didn’t even attach the end tag to them,\n\nthough it was used as a stand-alone jingle.\n\nThey did start airing more individual sounding\n\ntrails within a few months, with a very funky\n\nsounding one for Claire’s All-Request Lunch,\n\nwhich itself can be heard taking place at 38.54.\n\nAfter overnight and sports presenter\n\nMatthew Rudd says goodbye on his nightly\n\nmid-evening sports phone-in at, Steve Jordan’s\n\nback at 48.58 with his first “Night At The 80s”.\n\nI bet Rudd at the time was thinking\n\n“it should have been my show”…\n\n(Do give his “Forgotten 80s” show a listen\n\non Absolute 80s on Sundays if you get the chance.)\n\nThis show was one of the most popular\n\non KCFM, with lots of e-mail and phone requests,\n\nfor lesser heard 80s tunes.\n\nI got a few on myself, including on the first\n\nshow Level 42, though we’ve already had one\n\non-air mention this episode.\n\nOne caller heard at 51.26, asks for a spinning of Journey,\n\nwhich had quite a following in Hull, years before\n\nits resurgence at the end of the decade.\n\nThe heightened excitement of listening to KCFM\n\nas a standalone station did become too big a cause\n\nof what lead to me going really bonkers\n\nlater on that August.\n\nAfter coming out of hospital I started listening\n\nmore moderately and in my comedown state\n\nI realised that maybe it wasn’t all that exciting\n\nin rainy autumnal conditions.\n\nWhich may have been a real reflection of\n\nwhat Hull was like.\n\nI seem to remember them playing Mika’s\n\n“Happy Ending” a fair number of times,\n\nwhich added to the unsettled feeling.\n\nIt was to get worse in 2009, as in June that year,\n\nthe station was bought out by the Lincs FM group\n\nin a rich twist of irony, as they’d failed to win\n\nthe Hull license with their own bid “White Rose Radio”.\n\nAlthough the name didn’t transfer, many\n\nhallmarks of the group did over the course\n\nof a year with Steve Jordan being the\n\nfirst casualty, departing breakfast (and the\n\n80s show) after two years in August 2009.\n\nThe music policy was tightened, live sports\n\ncoverage and specialist shows were ditched,\n\nand by 2010 the superb TM jingles were replaced\n\nby a package from S2 Blue, not the same one\n\nas their sister stations, but retaining\n\nthe same melody logo.\n\nAll traces of individuality were removed,\n\nin spite of Lincs FM’s policy of no networked\n\nprogrammes, a trait that someday\n\nthey’ll finally have to admit defeat.\n\nEspecially as they’re a shadow of the entertaining\n\nstations they once were, when Duncan Newmarch\n\nand Maria Richmond were on there.\n\nNo wonder they’re now at the BBC.\n\n8 years on, only one presenter from the original\n\nline-up remains at KCFM, proof overall that\n\ngood things never stand still in radio.\n\nBut would they still be good if they did?\n\nJust look at Chris Moyles.\n\nWhilst everything was happy in Hull back in\n\nAugust ’07, further down South, Capital Gold\n\nand Classic Gold were to merge together as “Gold”\n\nfollowing Gcap’s purchase of the former GWR\n\nAM stations from Unique.\n\nThe on-air changeover was presided with\n\nnot too much fanfare, at 7pm on Friday\n\nthe 2nd of August.\n\nThe launch itself with Greg Edwards is heard at 56.20,\n\nand to start with little change on-air was made\n\nto the Gold brand, even retaining the Music 4\n\nCapital Gold news intro.\n\nGreg lasted for about another year, before\n\nbeing dropped in Autumn ’08 eventually\n\nreappearing on Jazz FM for a short period\n\nin 2010 standing in for Robbie Vincent on\n\nSunday mornings whilst he was ill.\n\nNowadays Greg can be found on DAB station Mi-Soul.\n\nThe biggest changes to the network were\n\nat breakfast, with the local breakfast shows\n\non the former Capital Gold stations dropped\n\nin favour of local voice-tracked afternoon shows ,\n\nwhich themselves were eventually dropped by 2010.\n\nThis was in favour of a networked breakfast show\n\nfrom Kid Jensen and Erika North, the female half\n\nretained from Classic Gold whilst Tony Blackburn\n\nwas given his marching orders.\n\nBlackburn still had his Saturday lunchtime\n\nsoul show on BBC London but also managed to\n\nfind a new radio home, and within my reach\n\nwhich we’ll hear shortly.\n\nThen again, as shown in this clip of Tone\n\nat that year’s Sony’s it could have been far worse.\n\nThe knowing jokes towards his former station\n\nof residence may explain why he didn’t transfer\n\nover to Gold.\n\nAs for Gambo’s little quip, I’m guessing “Sexyback”\n\nwas the song he would be singing this year\n\nif anyone’s speeches dragged on.\n\nChris Moyles is back from holiday at 57.13, with a\n\nnew set of jingles, introduced to coincide with\n\na new set of features.\n\nI wasn’t a big fan of the “Morning Rock” IDs used\n\nfrom August ’07 to December ’08, as they sounded\n\nrather pub-rock, and lacked the anticipatory\n\nbuilds from the last set as heard at 8.56.\n\nThough maybe that was the intention, as the\n\nbigger suits at Radio 1 had an influence on the\n\nmusical direction of the IDs, possibly wanting\n\na more raw, rocky, and less showbiz feel\n\nto the new jingles.\n\nThe first show back from holiday was a rather\n\nunusual set up, with Comedy Dave on a live\n\nlink up from home, as his soon to be second\n\nwife Jayne had given birth to little Nicole,\n\nwith more jingles specially made\n\nfor the occasion at 1:03:43.\n\nNicely timed too, for the arrival at 58.40 of\n\n“Birthday Corner”, of which the jingle shares\n\nmusical similarities to the old Aquafresh\n\nad from the late 80s (as resurrected 20 years later)\n\nand a certain window advertisement that we’ll\n\nbe hearing later on…\n\nThis item was supposedly introduced as\n\na response to “market research” that the show\n\nwasn’t appealing enough to young mothers\n\nwith toddlers, so the rather cute (if not tongue\n\nin cheek) feel to it, hopefully pleased all.\n\nIt was rather odd that in the post-phone in\n\ncompetition suspension, Moyles now encouraged\n\nlisteners to send in birthday cards that wouldn’t\n\neven be seen, let alone not getting read out on air.\n\nThe feature was dropped in early 2008,\n\nthough made a one off return in the run up\n\nto the final show, five years later.\n\nThough regarding it’s resemblance to CBeebies,\n\nit would be a taster of what was to come when\n\nsectioned, as watching the channel was my\n\none way other than radio, of staying calm.\n\nAlong with CBBC which just four days before\n\nI was let out, changed their idents, and saw\n\nthe departure of another crush from that era,\n\nGemma Hunt, who herself is now on\n\n“Swashbuckling” on CBeebies.\n\nIf you’ve never seen it, imagine a pirate\n\nthemed “Fun House” for pre-school children\n\nwith Melanie and Martina replaced by\n\npirate pantomime vilains “Cook”,\n\n“Line” and “Sinker”.\n\nFunny how along with “Space Pirates“, two of\n\nCBeebies best ever shows are of a nautical theme.\n\nWhich I suppose is ironic, considering the\n\ntime period of this episode is almost 40 years\n\nto the day when the Marine Offences Act\n\nwent into place.\n\nAlso heard at 1.01.22, another new item of which\n\nthe jingle was better than the feature itself,\n\n“Who Knows Dom”.\n\nThe short-lived replacement for\n\n“One Road Travel” later resurfaced as\n\n“Just Ask Dom” when the show moved\n\nto it’s 6:30am start time in October.\n\nAt 1.07.05 Tony Blackburn’s back, with a new show\n\nat KMFM on Sunday afternoons between\n\n4 and 7pm, pre-recced but not voice-tracked.\n\nKM were quick to promote Blackburn for\n\nall his worth, as shown below in this\n\nbackpage article from the Extra newspaper.\n\nPreceding him is Spencer James with the\n\nweekend request slot “The KMFM Takeover”\n\nlater borrowing a cue from Corinne Bailey-Rae\n\nand renamed “Put My Record On!”.\n\nThe nature of the preceding show and Blackburn’s\n\nbeing pre-recorded means it’s entirely fine that\n\nThe Style Council’s “Long Hot Summer” got played\n\ntwice within 20 minutes that afternoon.\n\nNot so good if you’re one of those types who\n\nloved Paul Weller in The Jam and as a solo\n\nartist, but not the sophisto-pop in between.\n\nTony’s show took over from the “A List” chart\n\nwhich was abandoned altogether by the end\n\nof 2007, partly due to the loss of Bailey’s as\n\nsponsor, and Global Radio who had just brought\n\nthe Chrysalis network having their own\n\nprogramming ideas.\n\nListening to the first show that weekend felt\n\neven better, with the weather holding a rare\n\nspell of bright sunshine for that summer,\n\nnot least with high temperature tunes\n\nto match, where as well as the Style Council,\n\nthere was also that of Bobby Goldsboro’s\n\never-saucy “Summer The First Time”.\n\nA tune that caused amusing embarrassment\n\non my part a few years later when interviewing\n\nBluey from Incognito.\n\nHaving previously hosted a breakfast show\n\nsponsored by Danish Bacon, Blackburn’s vegetarian\n\nprinciples wouldn’t have been hurt by the Britelite\n\nWindows ad at 01.10.10, and the return of the Wurzels,\n\nwith the infamous 3 Little Pigs song, now adapted\n\nfor the Kent-based window outlet.\n\nAnother West Country accented ad can be\n\nheard at 01.16.42, and to hear them again only\n\nheightened my daze of believing radio of\n\na golden age was back.\n\nI would use the term “radio like it used to be”\n\nbut we all know that’s a ridiculous concept altogether.\n\nMainly because radio didn’t used to\n\nbe voice tracked all the time…\n\nThe new show was sponsored by P&O Ferries,\n\nwhich still remains the case 8 years on, as\n\nTony still hosts Sunday afternoons on KMFM,\n\nthough the show’s format has changed to\n\none of number ones from over the last 30 years.\n\nIn 2007, Blackburn’s Sunday show was more of\n\na freewheeling affair, “opening up his record box”\n\nand repeatedly going on in his usual manner\n\nover how “we don’t play all the same songs\n\nlike all the other stations!”.\n\nHe’s also heard speaking over his music bed,\n\nstill used to this day on his BBC London and\n\nvarious shows, “Soul Brothers” from the Bruton\n\nmusic library, as penned by Jean Pierre-Fabien.\n\nIn an interview with the Radio Magazine in 2008,\n\nBlackburn spoke about his frustration of radio\n\nstations repeatedly playing the one ABBA song,\n\n“Dancing Queen”.\n\nAs he didn’t play that song to death every week,\n\noh no, he played “Knowing Me Knowing You”\n\nevery week, as heard at 01.11.24.\n\nA classic case of “Pot Kettle Blackburn”.\n\nSeriously though, as with KCFM, listening to\n\nthe show after coming out of sectioning, didn’t\n\nfeel as exciting as when it started that August,\n\nand it did get repetitive.\n\nBut a presenter who’s still a good listen now\n\nand again, especially when hosting Pick Of\n\nThe Pops, where it’s safe to say that Fluff’s\n\nfamous theme tune has now become Tony’s\n\nvery own.\n\nHe won’t be escaping easily from this episode.\n\nKMFM in ’07 as a whole was getting better,\n\nwith specialist music shows at weekends\n\nsuch as Richard Walters Rock Show on Fridays,\n\nand Chris Finn’s chillout show on Saturday nights.\n\nThere was also the arrival of new jingles in October\n\nfrom TM Studios, resung from “PLJ ’07”.\n\nThe original custom was a good package,\n\ntaking a heritage melody logo dating back over\n\n45 years, and making it relevant to present day\n\nmusic, with the IDs themselves written\n\nby Barry Young.\n\nIn addition to the PLJ cuts, were a couple of\n\nmore traditional sounding IDs for Tony Blackburn,\n\nresung from a package penned by jingle veteran\n\nBruce Upchurch called “Miami’s Coast”.\n\nThe same man behind the KVIL package\n\nas used by KCFM.\n\nStation PD Rik Scott (who also c0-produced the rather\n\ncrazy sweepers with vintage Blackburn JAM acapellas\n\nin this selection) can be heard showing off\n\nthe jingles below.\n\nhttps://robinblamires26.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/1222495867_542_ft65667_kmfm-jonestm_plj07_miamicoast.mp3\n\nThe new jingles showed signs of a better sounding station,\n\nif a bit rocky for the format, first airing not long after\n\narriving in Maidstone.\n\nHaving taken over what used to be CTR 106.5\n\nthat September, KMFM was indeed everywhere.\n\nA year later the jingles switched to a more\n\nconsistent sounding resing of Viking FM ’06\n\nas written by Dave Bethell, who penned a few\n\nadditional cuts for KMFM during his short stint\n\nas a presenter in 2009.\n\nAnd credit to both Rik and Rob, two people who\n\nto this day are of a rare breed in radio, with an\n\nunderstanding of really good on-air identification.\n\nNot least as Rik has been voicing the intro jingles\n\nfor this very series.\n\nBack in ’07 Kirstyn Read can be heard at 01.17.13,\n\nin her long running Sunday evening show.\n\nShe shortly moved to the Friday night 80s Show\n\nas well as co-hosting KMFM Ashford’s Breakfast\n\nshow with John “Webbo” Webster.\n\nAt 1.18.18, a brief illustration of what radio genuinely\n\nsounded like whilst I was recovering in hospital\n\nfrom hypomania.\n\nJames Waters (ex SGR Colchester in the 90s) making\n\na farewell speech from Sheppey community radio\n\nstation BR-FM , a station that he helped launch\n\nless than a year earlier.\n\nAccompanied by the theme tune to a TV show,\n\nthat many radio presenters can only dream\n\nof replicating.\n\nI’m no one to talk, as the key cause of me\n\ngoing bonkers, was trying to find the sound effect\n\nadapted for the gunge tank, from the BBC Sound\n\nEffects Library.\n\nI’ve managed to find it in the clear since, and at one time it used to be\n\nthe alarm clock on my smartphone.\n\nA bit too effective maybe?\n\nThat said, there are many other audio rarities\n\nfrom radio which were also part of the cause,\n\nthat I am still yet to find…\n\nI later ended up working alongside Waters\n\nfor a few years at my current station CSR FM\n\nin Canterbury, where it’s fair to say it was\n\nrather raucous, and at times a little too hard\n\nto handle.\n\nSomething both of us have realised in hindsight.\n\nThough from the Sheppey station just over\n\nfive years later, this on-air resignation\n\nis even worse, with another Edmonds influence\n\nat the beginning, as also heard in episode 2.\n\nThe only tears I’m getting when listening to it\n\nare those of hysterics.\n\nAs of typing, Waters has relocated back not too\n\nfar from Sheppey, on Sittingbourne\n\ncommunity station SFM.\n\nOne month later and it’s 40th birthday\n\ncelebrations galore at BBC Radio 1 and 2.\n\nStarting off at 1.19.19 with JK and Joel, followed by\n\na few trails for Radio 2’s special day, this should have\n\nbeen something I was supposed to get excited about,\n\nbut in my post-med comedown, listening felt like\n\na chore in itself.\n\nTony Blackburn joins Moyles live in the studio at 1.22.00,\n\nwhere for the first half hour they attempted to\n\nrecreate the first show by playing all the records\n\nin exactly the same order, but settled down\n\nshortly afterwards into general anoraking.\n\nAnd with no better person, than Tony’s first producer\n\nand eventual controller of Radio 1, Johnny Beerling,\n\n(1.30.10) the man who wrote the lyrics to many\n\nof Radio 1’s Dallas sung jingles including\n\nthe infamous “Glasgow Square” from the 1984 package,\n\nresung from “The Best Show” originally written\n\nfor Denver’s KIMN.\n\nIt’s weird with Tony in the studio, as they\n\nintroduced the “Best Sound” jingles on-air\n\na week after he departed Radio 1.\n\nJust two days after the broadcast, I met Blackburn\n\nin person, at a book signing at Bluewater, in spite\n\nof the side effects of my illness rendering me\n\nunable to stay still for more than 10 seconds.\n\nScrew you Risperdol.\n\nThis photo says it all, though we have met\n\na few times since.\n\nMoyles wasn’t happy on joining Radio 1\n\nten years earlier, at the lack of on-air\n\ncelebrations for the station’s 30th birthday,\n\nbut having adapted a more mainstream\n\napproach than in 1997, they were more than\n\nhappy to include a few remixed jingles\n\nin their 40th anniversary imaging.\n\nIt was also around the same time that Moyles\n\nresurrected “The Golden Hour” having done so\n\ntwo years previously out of pure indulgence\n\non a canal boat outside broadcast.\n\nFrom mid-October onwards the item, and it’s\n\nmany vintage Radio 1 jingles became a Friday\n\nfixture of his breakfast show, as well as the\n\nshow as a whole given an extra half-hour,\n\nstarting at 6:30am.\n\nThe day I was let out of hospital happened\n\nto be the same day that the schedule changes\n\nfor Autumn ’07 were announced at Radio 1,\n\nwith the surprise departure of JK and Joel\n\nafter three years at the station.\n\nThey would be replaced on early breakfast\n\nby newcomer Greg James fresh from student\n\nradio at just 21 years old, who won best male\n\nat 2005’s Student Radio Awards.\n\nTaking over from them on the chart\n\nwere Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates,\n\nor more realistically, Reggie Yates,\n\nand Fearne, sometimes…\n\nThey were possibly brought in as the warm up\n\nfor Radio 1’s contribution to what ended up\n\nbeing the BBC’s stillborn strand aimed\n\nat teenagers “BBC Switch” which featured\n\nthe questionable choice of Kelly Osborne\n\nas the new host of the Sunday Surgery.\n\nSwitch was eventually dropped altogether in 2010\n\namid the cuts in the BBC’s “Delivering Quality First”\n\nplan, though the departure of Switch prompted\n\nno mass protests outside of Broadcasting House\n\nto save it.\n\nFurther changes at weekends from October ’07\n\nincluded Vernon Kay reduced to one show on\n\nSaturday mornings, and Dick And Dom\n\ntaking over the Sunday morning “lie-in” slot\n\nwhere they always seemed to be playing “Gipsy Woman”\n\nby Crystal Waters.\n\nThe duo from Da Bungalow were to radio presenting\n\nwhat JK and Joel were to children’s television presenting.\n\nNot as good at it, as they were (and still are)\n\nin their main professions.\n\nJK and Joel can be heard in snippets from their\n\nfinal show at 1.33.04, which I can remember listening to,\n\nand desperately trying to stay still in my\n\nrecovering manic state.\n\nAlthough the whole day had been video-streamed\n\nfrom breakfast the live stream was stopped after\n\n4pm which even the pair themselves questioned on-air.\n\nWhilst Moyles had been blessed with Tony Blackburn\n\nin the studio, and Zoe Ball and Sara Cox hosted a\n\ndouble-header before them, JK and Joel had to make do\n\nwith pre-recorded interviews of Bruno Brookes\n\nand Mark Goodier reminiscing on their respective\n\nmemories of hosting the chart in a special edition\n\nof “The Retro”.\n\nIt wasn’t as entertainingly nostalgic as it\n\ncould have been, though maybe the bosses\n\nwanted the duo’s departure not to be too indulgent,\n\nas Moyles had done more than his fair share\n\nof wallowing in Radio 1’s past.\n\nJK and Joel later mentioned in an interview\n\nin the Guardian that their departure came\n\nas a result of over-ambition, as due to their\n\nhectic TV filming schedule, they wanted out\n\nfrom earlies, with sights set on Edith Bowman’s\n\nafternoon slot.\n\nIn an ideal world, it would have been a return\n\nto the whimsy provided by the Dundee woman\n\nand Colin Murray, but it wasn’t to be,\n\nwith Edith and her movie babble languishing\n\nfor two more years.\n\nThe chart itself that week saw the usual array\n\nof odd entries, including Phil Collins’\n\n“In The Air Tonight” after its performance\n\nby the drumming gorilla in the Cadbury’s ad,\n\nand Jonny Trunk and Wiseby’s “The Lady’s Bras”.\n\nA 30 second song championed by Scott Mills,\n\nbased melodically around the library track “The Gonk”.\n\nDo give the album “Dirty Fan Male” a listen\n\nif you get a chance.\n\nThe duo’s final moments, were rather poignant\n\nespecially with the farewell link done dry, and Joel’s final words\n\npaying homage to Bruno Brookes, (and possibly former\n\non-air rival Simon Hirst during his stint on Hit 40 UK).\n\nIt felt like a moment where a public figure had\n\ndied, and sort of put a downer on the birthday celebrations,\n\nthat day, despite being followed by Annie Nightingale,\n\nand Annie Mac immediately after.\n\nJK and Joel would return to the radio in 2008 when\n\nthe ever delightful David Lloyd snapped them up at\n\nVirgin Radio where they spent just over half a year\n\non weekend mid-mornings.\n\nAs for the chart as a whole, Radio 1 not only\n\nushered in new presenters, but a new imaging\n\npackage for the show, made by IQ Beats in Seattle,\n\nlasting for over four years on air.\n\nSo that rounds off a rather bonkers selection\n\nof radio, from what was a bonkers period in life.\n\nThe final episode and blog in this series\n\n(and possibly forever) will be up before 2015 is out,\n\nand it’s going to be more than a little honest.\n\nDouble figures, and dial twiddling as per usual\n\nas we enter the 10th episode of WRUTSL\n\nlooking back at the radio of the “innocent”\n\nhalf of 2007.\n\nBefore radio got caught misbehaving itself\n\nand deceiving listeners who in actual fact,\n\nwere gullible enough to enter the competitions\n\nthey had very little chance of winning even if\n\ntheir entries were counted.\n\nAnd on a personal level, it was the period\n\nbefore I went bonkers.\n\nWe start off with a station that has resulted\n\nin many people feeling as if they’re trapped\n\nin 1987 when listening.\n\nA top of hour junction at London’s Heart\n\nwhich by now was sharing shows bar breakfast\n\nand drive with the Midlands stations.\n\nHence the launch of a network-wide ID package\n\nfrom IQ Beats, containing a series of themes\n\nbuilding up to those three immortal words\n\n“This Is Heart”.\n\nAnd I must say, I really liked this ID package and\n\nthe station as of then, as it represented the busy\n\nbut lively mood of London.\n\n“Club Classics” was always a listening staple in halls,\n\nor at mates’ houses via their Sky box before\n\na Friday night out in Central.\n\nBy the end of ’07 Heart would be owned by\n\na different company altogether, not that you’d\n\nhear a difference on air, unlike at sister station LBC.\n\nA new news jingle for 2007 at Radio 1 at 2.12\n\nretaining the melody logo, but sounding\n\nless lively and more authoritative than the last.\n\nThis lasted 4 and a half years on the station albeit\n\nwith a few (slightly unecessary) remixes.\n\nEntering his fourth year at Breakfast at 2.54,\n\nChris Moyles with the first airing\n\nof “The Brand New Cheesy Song” recorded\n\nalong with all the other new jingles at Abbey Road.\n\nThe song may have been introduced as a holding\n\ndevice, as Moyles had a habit of arriving in the studio\n\nseconds, or quite often minutes, after the show\n\nhad started.\n\nIt became hard to envisage the show starting\n\nwithout it, even if earlier audio in this series\n\nproves otherwise.\n\nAnd still to this day on Radio X, well, the first\n\nthirty seconds anyway, as part of a gag that they\n\nsupposedly forgot to drop after the first show.\n\nThe full version (and variants) can be heard\n\non the Music 4 website, taking great influence\n\nfrom the many station songs commonplace\n\non independent local radio back in the 80s,\n\nwith Radio Aire 1981, and most definitely\n\nViking Radio 1984, being two key influences.\n\nAnd the lyrics over the years would become\n\neven more ridiculous than, “# Hull, birthplace\n\nof Amy Johnson“.\n\nNew talkover beds were introduced including the\n\nswing sounding one at 4.39, and another more upbeat\n\n“retro” theme, that was later adapted for Moyles’\n\nChannel 4 “Quiz Night” series in 2009.\n\nThe show’s closing theme (12.53) was also updated\n\nwith the addition of strings, so stirring, it was\n\nenough for Moyles to play them solo, the day\n\nafter recording them in November ’06 as heard below.\n\nhttps://robinblamires26.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/moyles-strings.mp3\n\nYou can’t help but just weep on hearing them.\n\nThe new year saw the much awaited return\n\nof Carpark Catchphrase heard at 6.21, this round\n\nleft on tenterhooks due to running short of time\n\nas often became the case.\n\nThis was probably the early origins of “The Quiz Elephant”\n\nnoise as stolen from another show.\n\nThough like the “Cheesy Song” it’s hard to imagine\n\na time when Carpark Catchphrase was played\n\non a Friday, as the Golden Hour was brought back\n\nnot long after this period.\n\nAt 3.59 we hear a cleverly constructed/gritty sounding\n\ntrail for Colin Murray’s late night show.\n\nMost of the tunes in there as you’d guess\n\nhave a theme of “Movin” apart from the one\n\nat the end, Evening Session favourite “AM 180”\n\nby Grandadddy which by now was used as the\n\ntheme for Charlie Brooker’s “Screenwipe”.\n\nWith Radio 1 increasing its specialist output\n\nfrom late 2006, Murray, since September was\n\ncast away from the shackles of afternoons\n\n(much to the disappointment of many\n\nlisteners), and now hosting the late evening\n\nMonday to Thursday slot.\n\nThus meaning the end of Lamacq Live, but\n\nthe host stayed at Radio 1 for a couple\n\nmore years.\n\nI still can’t think of that show without visualizing\n\nthe BBC TV trail for it on launch 8 years earlier,\n\naccompanied by the Verve’s “Lucky Man”.\n\nLammo, also a regular contributor to the Murray\n\nhosted Fighting Talk on 5 Live, having recently\n\ntaken over from Christian O’Connell who had\n\njoined Virgin Radio’s breakfast show after\n\n5 years on XFM’s.\n\nWith Murray being Radio 1’s first regular late night\n\nhost since the death of John Peel, each night took\n\na different agenda with Wednesdays being\n\ndocumentary night.\n\nAs I was taking a university module in radio\n\ndocumentaries and assembled features\n\naround the time of the show’s launch,\n\nI listened to the first one in that slot about\n\nillegal raves, and it sounded as if Radio 1 were\n\nafraid the mere mention of the word\n\n“documentary” would be a big turn off\n\nfor its audience.\n\nTo the point that it was split into two halves\n\nwhere at the end of the first, Murray was heard\n\nexclaiming with excitement; “On what sort of\n\ndocumentary would you hear “Loaded”\n\nby Primal Scream?”\n\nIt wasn’t all bad, as Tuesday nights saw the\n\nmuch treasured “Black Hole Of Radio 1”\n\nlater renamed “Audio Bully”\n\nA listener suggested soundscape (or mash up)\n\nof songs blended with speech from films and\n\nTV shows as well as the occasional theme tune,\n\nperfectly suited for that time of night.\n\n50 Cent Vs Thomas The Tank Engine you say…?\n\nShortly before leaving the BBC for talkSPORT\n\nin 2013, Colin hosted a similar series on 6 Music\n\nwith themed soundscapes, the highlight being\n\na 30 minute journey from love to hate, starting\n\noff with The Divine Comedy’s “Songs Of Love”\n\nand finishing with Napalm Death’s “You Suffer”.\n\nMick Brown and the Capital Gold London\n\nbreakfast show is heard at 13.59.\n\nA show and station that at the time I was\n\nheavily analysing as part of a practical radio module\n\nat uni, where I was the host of a two hour assessed\n\noldies show, presented as if it was broadcast\n\non the soon to be twilight-destined Capital Gold.\n\nOnly that within the team, we had to make\n\nour own jingles rather than simply half-inch the\n\nones by Vibe that were still being used.\n\nI’ll spare you from hearing the show itself,\n\nbut here’s one of the ads which at the end sounds\n\nlike a bollocking from the headmaster.\n\nSplit into two groups, the other opted for\n\na soul format to be broadcast on Smooth FM,\n\na station which was also in transition mode.\n\nAs I was hosting a show of the same genre on the\n\nstudent radio station at the same time, it was fun\n\nto observe, and difficult to avoid helping out\n\nthe music team, when given a spare moment.\n\nThat, in spite of the group being marked down\n\nfor leaning too close to Smooth’s station-wide\n\nmusic policy, with the lecturer confused as to\n\nwhy The Crystals, and The Drifters would be\n\nplayed on a soul/funk show.\n\nThe module was of such a high, that the one in\n\nthe latter half of the semester on podcasting\n\nfelt like a comedown, the stresses of it lead\n\nto me having to go home for a weekend,\n\nin what unbeknownst at the time, was\n\nmy “first mental outburst” that year.\n\nOne of which a very tiny low, ignited\n\nthe fuse of what soon became a gradually\n\nelevating high.\n\nA nice twist on the “guess the year” competition\n\nat 22.33, ditching the whole premise with\n\n“Play Your Charts Right”.\n\nAn item later “borrowed” by Radio 1’s\n\nMatt Edmondson, though to be fair\n\nthe game itself was loosely adapted from\n\nthe British version of the gameshow “Card Sharks”.\n\nThis edition recorded on the 79th birthday\n\nof the show’s host with an impression to boot.\n\nThe music bed spoken over by Brown at 25.09 is\n\nthe rare-groover “Six Million Steps” by Rhanni Harris,\n\nand it’s fair to say that Mick had a fair few cool-sounding\n\nspeaking-over tracks, including at one time “Chime”\n\nby The Orbital.\n\nSadly, Brown was to be a victim of the merger\n\nwith Classic Gold to “Gold” in August ’07,\n\nlosing his breakfast show to one that was networked.\n\nThe host made a statement on his final show,\n\nreflecting on how Capital’s original studios on\n\nEuston Road felt like a radio station, whereas the\n\ncurrent Leicester Square location (on the verge\n\nof becoming “The Death Star”) resembled an\n\naccountants office.\n\nThough the shorter-haired half of Pat And Mick,\n\ndid find a radio refuge, back at Radio Brick Lane.\n\nNo he didn’t, he moved to Solar Radio indulging\n\nin his love of soul music, eventually resurfacing\n\non Radio Jackie in South London.\n\nDean Martin, heard at 27.25, survived the shake-up\n\nat Gold continuing to host the evening request\n\nshow up to 2014, when Gold became an jock-free\n\nstation apart from at breakfast, and disappeared\n\nfrom AM apart from in London, switching to\n\nSmooth Radio.\n\nAt 32.55, a technical cock-up, handled with the\n\nmost well-thought back-up plan.\n\nKen Bruce in early May that year, presenting\n\nhis show live from a cruise liner alongside\n\nthe winning bidders of a prize in the 2006\n\nChildren In Need auction.\n\nThe O/B equipment had a tendency to repeatedly\n\ndrop out after a certain length of time,\n\nthough luckily, newsreader Charles Nove is\n\non hand with a spare copy of the questions\n\nto keep the game going.\n\nAnd fair dos on both the sporting contestants\n\nwinning the DAB radio.\n\nI could sympathise with the whole situation,\n\nas at uni we’d been blessed with our own O/B device\n\n“Scoopy”, a provider of similar frustrating unreliability,\n\nand labelled by many students as “a piece of shit” .\n\nIt could have been that very device Ken Bruce was using.\n\nElsewhere at BBC Radio 2, Chris Evans by now had\n\nsettled into Drivetime where after a shaky start\n\nin April ’06, just six months after joining the\n\nstation on Saturday afternoons, he had managed\n\nto make the slot his own, and was a far more\n\nlikeable character on air, than the laddish one\n\nat Virgin 5 years prior.\n\nJohnnie Walker meanwhile was moved to\n\na Sunday teatime slot replacing a pensioned-off\n\nEd Stewart, though Walker would still be Wogan’s\n\nfirst choice of stand-in over his many holidays\n\nfor the next three years.\n\nFurther changes to the weekday schedule came\n\nin April ’07 when Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie\n\nwere joined together with a nightly show from\n\nOxford Road on Mondays to Thursdays, introducing\n\nfeatures such as “The Chain” introduced by\n\nthe voice of Gordon Burns, and still running\n\nto this day on their BBC 6 Music show.\n\n“Congratulations Caller!”\n\nIt’s surprising how they haven’t been sued\n\nfor the feature by Comedy Dave…\n\nThe new show meant certain Radio 2 specialist\n\nshows were either moved, shortened, or in some\n\ncases dropped altogether with Nick Barraclough\n\ndeparting Radio 2 and moving to the new\n\nSmooth Radio at GMG to host their new country show,\n\nwhich lasted just over a year.\n\nSimon Mayo’s Monday night album chart,\n\nalso bid farewell that month.\n\nAs for Ken Bruce, if that trip to sea wasn’t\n\nembarrassing enough, Popmaster fell victim\n\nin July to the BBC’s suspension of competitions.\n\nIt was swiftly replaced by “Celebrity Popmaster”\n\nwhere for the rest of ’07, Bruce spent 20 minutes\n\nevery morning trying to control two over-excited\n\ncelebrity contestants who knew very little about music.\n\nNot helped that they weren’t even given\n\nthe “5-4-3-2-1” if strapped for an answer.\n\nIt was a situation more awkward, than the\n\nshort-lived premise of getting the two callers\n\nhead to head with each other at the same time,\n\nbut due to the BBC’s “strategic review” of competitions,\n\nthey couldn’t abandon the celeb premise as quickly.\n\nBruce even admitted his frustration surrounding\n\nthe item in his “Tracks Of My Years” autobiography\n\npublished two years later.\n\nWe finish our first spell in ’07 with another\n\n10 Hour Takeover, recorded from Whit Week\n\nand four days before leaving uni in London\n\nfor a second summer, this time on a high.\n\nProbably too big a high by this stage.\n\nRadio 1’s latest arrivals Dick and Dom kick it all off\n\nat 42.54, who at the time filled the Friday\n\nearly breakfast slot for JK and Joel.\n\nWho in turn were in Dick and Dom’s old television haunt\n\nof Saturday mornings, but with an hour long show\n\n“Hider In The House“.\n\nA series involving children trying to dupe\n\ntheir parents by smuggling a celebrity (loosely)\n\ninto their house, and attempting 8 messy challenges\n\nover two days without getting caught.\n\nSeeing that show later in the year whilst\n\nrecovering from hypomania was a harsh reminder\n\nof how in the two years I was caught up in\n\nthe university bubble, Saturday morning television\n\nas a generation once knew it, had disappeared.\n\nA situation that took quite a while to accept,\n\nbut after writing a nostalgic lookback,\n\ncharting the genre’s 30 year history, I moved on from it.\n\nMaybe there’s hope for my radio obsession\n\nbecoming less so, when this series has finished.\n\nThe 2007 Takeover saw Chappers and Dave\n\nholding the fort from 10am until 1, Edith Bowman\n\nin her usual afternoon slot at 45.37, and\n\nthe Chuckle Brothers themselves rounding\n\nit off from 4 until 7pm.\n\nJK and Joel were in their element hosting the\n\ntakeover, but due to circumstances that we’ll\n\nfocus on in more detail in the next episode,\n\nRadio 1’s 5th outing would be their last.\n\nAnd there’s a good chance that by September ’07,\n\nthe station-wide trail finishing this episode at 47.13\n\nas soundtracked by Reverend and the Makers\n\nwould be put out to pasture.\n\nIt’s only going to get more chaotic, and in the\n\ncase of my own listening habits of the time,\n\nunrealistic, as you’ll hear from the latter half of ’07,\n\nin the penultimate episode of WRUTSL.\n\nWelcome to episode 9, reflecting on what was\n\nan odd year, as I appeared to have not just\n\nlost perspective on the outside world of radio,\n\nbut the outside world as a whole, after falling\n\ninto the university bubble.\n\nNot even a summer back home in Canterbury\n\ncould do any long-term damage to the daze,\n\nthough I have managed to find some interesting\n\naudio from ‘o6.\n\nStarting off with something even older,\n\nChris Moyles in his Radio Aire days, resurrected\n\non-air in revenge for the daily pre-show item\n\n“Joel Gold” with Joel Hogg to give his real name,\n\nhaving his early 90s local radio past exposed\n\nto the truckers of Great Britain.\n\nAlso heard is Moyles’s UK sung JAM Turbo Z Cut 10\n\nresing of which he goes into interesting detail\n\nof the story behind it at 6.56.\n\nYou’d think his uncle would have coughed up enough\n\nfor a Dallas resing rather than UK singers\n\nand Steve England’s sonovox.\n\nWith regards to how Joel adapted his radio name\n\nfrom the bespectacled wrestling commentator\n\nJim Ross, I reckon the duo missed a trick of\n\nbilling themselves as “JK and JR”.\n\nIt’s not like Jason King has ever been mistaken\n\nfor the lead singer of Jamiroquai…\n\nJK and Joel had the last laugh a month\n\nlater, when stepping in to host the show at\n\nthe last minute when Moyles didn’t show up\n\nbecause he was mourning Leeds United’s\n\nmishap in Cardiff the day before.\n\nWatford had beaten them 3-0 in the Football\n\nLeague Championship play-off final, costing\n\nLeeds a place in the next season’s Premier League.\n\nThey’d even ordered streamers and compiled\n\ncelebratory montages for the occasion,\n\nwhich in the usual behind the scenes\n\ntradition of the show, did get played\n\non-air in parts.\n\nI remember it being the same morning\n\nI left London for Canterbury, so I was sharing\n\nsimilar pain despite not being a Leeds fan myself.\n\nThough my university campus wasn’t too far\n\nfrom Watford in nearby Harrow.\n\nA round of “Celebrity Tar-zaaan” can be heard\n\nat 7.18, once again another item where the jingle is\n\nmore entertaining than the premise.\n\nYet the item as a whole sounds a lot less half-arsed\n\nthan most of the competitions done on\n\nthe show at Radio X.\n\nThe item lasted until around late Spring 2007,\n\nresurrected a few years later as “Celebrity\n\nRaspberry”, an aural summing-up of the show\n\nby that period.\n\nCelebrity Tar-zaaan lasted far longer on the show\n\nthan “Beep Beep Busters”, quietly dropped\n\nin March that year, and as mentioned in the last\n\nepisode’s blog, the last 20 or so minutes of the show\n\nnormally involved general mucking about, quite often\n\nwith vintage theme tunes from the Master Mix Box Set.\n\nIncluding at 10.07 a moment similar to Ray-Von’s\n\n“Guess The Intro” quiz in Phoenix Nights.\n\nWe head way out West at 11.27, and Tim Pryor\n\nstanding in over the Easter DIY weekend\n\nat Somerset’s Orchard FM.\n\nI’ll make no secret in saying that Tim was my\n\nbest mate in my first year at university,\n\nboth of us sharing similar views as to\n\nhow commercial radio could be better,\n\nespecially with it being a difficult time\n\nfor that part of the radio industry.\n\nNot helped by the ongoing frustration of those\n\nin the business, seemingly capable of talking\n\nat length about what makes really good radio,\n\nbut incapable of actually doing so.\n\nWhich is why I’m now writing this blog…\n\nIn fairness, that’s not a weakness exclusive to\n\njust commercial radio.\n\nTim was two years above me, and ahead of\n\ngraduating with a first, had managed to bag\n\na job as a broadcast journalist at sister station\n\nLantern FM in Barnstaple.\n\nThough as you can hear, he was a presenter first,\n\nand would occasionally be asked to cover at both\n\nLantern, Gemini, and indeed Orchard,\n\nwhere he was an important part of their\n\nAll-Stars football team.\n\nI can remember chatting to Tim on MSN after\n\nthe show that evening, (dating this period\n\nperfectly) and he was being a little hard\n\non himself as most good jocks are sometimes.\n\nIt hasn’t stopped him progressing, as nowadays\n\nhe can be heard as co-presenter on breakfast\n\nat BBC Radio Jersey.\n\nOne of the jingles for the DIY weekend can be heard\n\nat 16.28, soundtracked by Jim Blake’s “Dirty Weekend”\n\nfrom the ever-popular “Cheeze” CD in the Extreme\n\nMusic Library.\n\nOrchard FM was one of the better sounding Gcap\n\nstations at the time, though they had been\n\npart of the group for over five years,\n\nand had been given more time to bed in,\n\ncompared to Invicta who were still struggling.\n\nThe South West stations were almost sold\n\noff towards the end of ’05, but the sale was\n\nabandoned due to the bids that were offered\n\nbeing too low.\n\nFurther changes to the OneNetwork came\n\nin the Autumn where in need of retaining\n\na more clearer identity within the stations,\n\nthey reverted back to the old GWR strapline,\n\n“Today’s Best Mix”.\n\nAnd you thought Global were bad for going backwards…\n\nAt 15.19, a trail for Hit 40 UK, though minus the voice of Hirsty.\n\nBy this stage the show was going strength to strength\n\nin how it sounded, with the addition of a sung ID\n\npackage, which by no surprise may have been\n\nintroduced under the influence of the host.\n\nSadly Hirsty’s reign would be curtailed in Autumn ’06\n\nwhen after ditching the Smash Hits Chart (along with\n\nthe magazine) only three months after Robin Banks\n\ntook over as host from Mark Goodier, EMAP’s\n\nBig City stations would be taking the Hit 40\n\nfrom mid October.\n\nEMAP bosses weren’t happy about their\n\nstations in Yorkshire broadcasting (and trailing)\n\na show hosted by one of their biggest competitors\n\nat breakfast, with the highest audience for a\n\ncommercial radio breakfast show\n\noutside of London apparently.\n\nReplacing Hirsty would be Lucio, formerly of XFM\n\nand had just taken over drivetime at Capital Radio,\n\nswapping stations with Richard Bacon.\n\nIronically for Hirsty, his own station Galaxy 105\n\nwouldn’t even be taking the chart after his\n\ndeparture, with the launch of UBC’s “Fresh 40”,\n\nan urban chart hosted by Dynamite MC (and not\n\nMs Dynamite as speculated on online radio forums),\n\nthat also aired on the Kiss stations, including the new\n\nKiss 105-108 that had recently taken over\n\nfrom Vibe FM in East Anglia.\n\nThere’s wasn’t the only new chart on Sundays,\n\nas earlier in the year, “The A List” launched,\n\nan AC chart hosted by Nick Snaith and\n\nMelanie Sykes (later replaced by Gail Porter)\n\nwhich began airing on stations such as Heart,\n\nCentury FM, Real Radio, and on KMFM.\n\nSponsored by Bailey’s, it was a rather complicated\n\nchart combining singles, albums, DVDs,\n\nMP3 downloads and so on, to find the best selling\n\nartists as opposed to individual releases.\n\nUltimately this was a short-lived experiment\n\nby commercial radio to provide different\n\ncharts for different formats.\n\nIt was sad that a really good host was made\n\nto leave due to industry politics, and Hirsty’s\n\ndeparture from Hit 40 did no favours in terms\n\nof ratings, with JK and Joel at Radio 1 getting\n\nmore listeners, although both them\n\nand Hirsty were really good mates.\n\nAnd Hirsty wasn’t too gutted, as he later\n\nrevealed he would rather host a breakfast\n\nshow allowing him to do what he wanted\n\non air as opposed to the tight running of\n\na chart countdown.\n\nAs for JK and Joel at Radio 1, their chart had settled\n\ndown from being an entertainment magazine,\n\nfocusing more on the countdown itself,\n\nwhilst still retaining “The Retro” competition.\n\nThe on-air imaging had also been given a refresh,\n\nstill by Music 4, but with the main theme\n\nin a lower key.\n\nIn January ’07, further changes to the chart as\n\na whole saw the addition of downloads from\n\nany album track or compilation now valid\n\nfor entry, of which I can remember Joel getting\n\nexcited about in a live link-up from Radio 1,\n\non BBC News 24.\n\nThe Chris Moyles Show were quick to pick up\n\non the trend, with Moyles begging listeners\n\nto download Billie’s “Honey To The Bee”\n\nresulting in it buzzing up to number 17\n\nin the official Top 40.\n\nIt was the first of many attempts by the show,\n\nof what talkSPORT producer and renowned chart\n\nexpert James Masterton refers to as\n\na “twatty chart campaign”.\n\nFollowing on from an Easter in Somerset,\n\nthe comedown commences back in London at 18.29\n\nwith Iain Lee, whose LBC show was now blessed\n\nwith its own set of themes from IQ Beats,\n\nsounding rather like a US cop show from the 70s.\n\nI loved them myself, similar in style to the\n\nBespoke Music Jazz FM jingles from a few\n\nyears earlier, but with more punch, and\n\ncool chord progressions.\n\nIain’s not so subtle digs towards “Aunty Nana\n\nRaeburn” were certainly not put on, as apparently\n\nshe could be really difficult behind the scenes.\n\nLee on the other hand was genuinely a really\n\nnice guy away from the mic, and not as abrasive\n\nas his on-air persona could be at times.\n\nIf you went to his “Vs Radio” stage show\n\nearlier this year, you’ll understand how nervous\n\nhe is about listeners’ adoration for him.\n\nTriple M still made up for the last half hour of\n\nthe show between 6 and 6:30pm, where halfway\n\nthrough, Iain would normally play a song parody\n\nor musical skit from a listener, and at 19.23\n\nwe hear a concoction laying into regular\n\ncaller Yasser.\n\nMoyles returns at 21.13, choosing as usual not to talk,\n\nbut sing about his RAJAR success in the second\n\nquarter of ’06, with his show now the most\n\nlistened to breakfast show in London.\n\nThis time through the use of some resung\n\nCapital FM jingles by Vibe Music as they\n\nwere then, and I’m surprised Capital had\n\nthe guts to return to Music 4 a couple of\n\nyears later, in hope of their audio imaging\n\nbringing back listeners.\n\nAt 24.22, Iain Lee returns with “Sunday Night Triple M”.\n\nThe final half-hour of Iain’s daily show\n\nhad now been given a whole three hour show\n\nlate on Sundays in mid 2006, with Agent Chris\n\npresent, but having no control whatsoever\n\nover the phones.\n\nThe suitably haunting theme tune for the\n\nSunday show is Danny Elfman’s “Breakfast Machine”\n\nfrom the movie “Pee Wee’s Big Adventure”\n\nQuite often it could take a while to get going,\n\nbut when it did, it was brilliant, not least with\n\nanother caller laying into Charlie Wolf\n\nat 28.07 with more than colourful language.\n\nThe Boston broadcaster was soon dropped\n\nfrom talkSPORT, who at the same time brought\n\nin George Galloway, and the ever dignified\n\nJon Gaunt, after a fiery departure from\n\nBBC Coventry And Warwickshire only less than\n\na month from returning to the station.\n\nPretty soon you soon got callers on Triple M\n\nsinging “Bring Back Charlie Wolf! Sack That\n\nMuppet Gaunt!” to the tune of “Knees Up Mother Brown”.\n\nIf anything, LBC and Iain Lee’s show especially\n\nwas a good indicator of what was going on at\n\ntalkSPORT, without having to listen to those\n\nright-wing idiots on AM.\n\nAt 29.00, a few bits from a show in late July with\n\nno presenter, giving callers free reign over\n\nLondon, including one making use of the old\n\nJeff Wayne penned LBC news intro from\n\nthe mid 80s.\n\nOne that often made an accidental appearance\n\non many other ILRs, had the jock faded\n\nup IRN too soon.\n\nIn early 2007, Iain Lee was moved from drive\n\nto a better suited timeslot of 7-10pm weeknights,\n\nwith the show renamed “Iain Lee’s Good Evening”,\n\nallowing more calls, and fewer interruptions\n\nfor news and traffic.\n\nTriple M carried on as usual on Sundays, but in\n\nearly November that year, Lee departed LBC,\n\nafter struggling to blend in with the news-heavy\n\nagenda laid on by the station’s new owners,\n\nGlobal Radio.\n\nNo I’ve never heard of them either.\n\nLee followed in the footsteps of his old bosses\n\nDavid Lloyd and Paul Sylvester, joining Virgin Radio\n\nin early 2008, and surviving the switch\n\nto Absolute Radio the following Autumn later promoted\n\nto weeknights, until another departure in November 2011.\n\n“Agent Chris” meanwhile, or Christian Mitchell\n\nto give his real name is still at LBC to this day,\n\nnow producing Nick Ferrari at Breakfast.\n\nOver five years after retiring from the airwaves,\n\nAlan “Fluff” Freeman died at the age of 79\n\non the 27th of November, with Chris Moyles\n\npaying tribute to the great man, the morning\n\nafter at 32.15, with a few revealing behind the scenes\n\nstories from when he worked with the\n\nbroadcaster at Capital Radio a decade earlier.\n\nIt’s hard to think of any other presenter,\n\nlet alone a radio presenter, but someone who\n\njust hasn’t had a bad word said about them by anyone\n\nor a bad word to say himself about fellow colleagues.\n\nAfter a half-arsed countdown from Comedy Dave\n\nat 40.21, a tribute to Fluff from Capital Gold as broadcast\n\nlater on that evening, at 45.00 blending anecdotes from\n\nfellow DJs and musicians, with the final\n\nPick Of The Pops Take 3, broadcast on the station\n\n10 years earlier, I’m guessing not long after his abrupt\n\nannouncement of defection to Radio 2, as touched on\n\nearlier by Moyles.\n\nFluff’s passing possibly prompted the BBC\n\nto start thinking that they were in need of a\n\nmuch more prestigious host on Pick Of The Pops,\n\nthan someone who was an inferior replacement\n\nto Fluff, as he was to Danny Baker on “Pets Win Prizes“.\n\nSo that’s 2006 done and dusted, and next time,\n\nwe enter the most craziest of all years in the series\n\non both a radio level, and on a personal level.\n\nYou’re more than welcome to relive it\n\nwith me if you wish.\n\nWelcome to episode 8, looking back at a period\n\nwhen I started a radio production course at\n\nuniversity just outside of London and feeling\n\nlike an amateur alongside fellow future radio giants.\n\nIt was good fun though, and whilst an experience\n\ndeveloping a social life, and a purpose to it\n\nvia my time on the student radio station,\n\nI felt I learnt far more about the medium\n\nvia student radio than what was taught\n\non the course itself.\n\nPodcasts being uploaded in Real Player format?\n\nIn fairness, it’s common on any academic course\n\nto miss the zeitgeist of what is happening outside\n\nthe lecture rooms, let alone creative possibilities,\n\nand the changes taking place in radio over those\n\nfour years made me relish the creative freedoms\n\nwithin student radio.\n\nBut creative and fun radio still survived in places,\n\nand we start this episode with Hirsty’s Daily Dose\n\nfrom Yorkshire’s Galaxy 105 in August ’05.\n\nThis was recorded the day after I’d met\n\nSimon Hirst at a Jinglemad meet up in\n\nLondon, and also got to meet Katy Hill outside\n\nCapital FM later that evening after they’d\n\ndone the chart.\n\nI have to say that she may be the nicest woman\n\nin radio I have met, even going as far to finishing\n\nher personal phone conversation just to say\n\nhello to us.\n\nSuch a pity about the circumstances\n\ntwo months later that saw her sudden\n\ndeparture from both the chart and Capital FM,\n\nwith Hirsty going solo, despite the fact he did\n\na really good job of it.\n\nThe same goes for this, even if Hirsty herself claims\n\nthat features such as “Hole In The Headline”,\n\ncomplete with it’s own DIY jingle at 2.39,\n\nwere some of the worst radio ideas ever.\n\nFar too modest, especially as Have I Got News For You\n\nhave gotten mileage out of a similar item\n\nfor over 25 years.\n\nThe features (and their jingles) over the decade\n\nof the Dose progressed, with “He Said She Said”\n\nbeing one such favourite.\n\nAnd I claim full responsibility for the audio\n\nof the Bullseye toy at 6.56, having brought one the\n\nprevious day and thinking “he’s gonna love this!”.\n\nHirsty’s theme tune, as heard at 6.05, is a remixed\n\nversion of “Rabbit And Hutch” from the V Library,\n\nstill used today on her BBC Radio Manchester show.\n\nWhilst popular in Yorkshire, I never really got into\n\nthe Dose myself, though like the Chris Moyles Show\n\nit was all down to the listener bedding in, and\n\ndeveloping a relationship with Hirsty, Danny Oakes,\n\nJoJo etc, and getting their humour.\n\nAnd you cannot fault the fact that it ran successfully\n\nfor 11.5 years on air, cruelly curtailed via Global Radio’s\n\nmisconception that listeners wouldn’t be interested\n\nin Simon Hirst’s transition to becoming Stephanie.\n\nAt 12.28, a rather infamous radio station, Radio London.\n\nA commercial station broadcasting from above\n\na building society in Frinton attempting to recreate\n\nthe heyday of the much loved pirate, with the\n\naddition of many vintage JAM jingles.\n\nThey later bought a set of TM jingles resung\n\nfrom “Big Time Radio” made 10 years earlier for\n\nWPLJ in New York.\n\nBig L was a station seemingly set up to satisfy\n\nthe wet dreams of owner Ray Anderson, a man\n\nforever in mourning since the Marine Offences Act\n\nwent into place.\n\nWith presenters such as Mike Read, and Diddy\n\nDavid Hamilton on board it was fully bound for\n\n“Smooth Sailing”.\n\nA highly successful sound it wasn’t, with very low\n\nlistening figures and the station only being kept\n\nalive via two businessmen with very deep pockets.\n\nReadie can be heard at various points, including\n\nan apology for playing “Wordy Rappinghood” by\n\nthe Tom Tom Club at 14.26.\n\nIronically one of the fellow presenters at the community\n\nradio station I volunteer at, uses the very song for his\n\n“Word Of The Week” feature, which is essentially\n\n“Call My Bluff” on the radio.\n\nWithin a few months the BBC took issue,\n\nsoon getting hold of the rights to the Radio London\n\nbrand name, and the Frinton station became solely\n\nknown on-air as Big L.\n\nWhilst it would be 10 years before they\n\nre-introduced the name station wide,\n\nit gave Tony Blackburn free reign to play\n\nthe old PAMS Radio London jingles\n\non his Saturday lunchtime soul show\n\nat BBC London.\n\nBig L’s jingles on the other hand, ended up sounding\n\ncrudely truncated, as you’ll hear in future episodes.\n\nNot to mention being humiliated on television,\n\nvia a 2007 Channel 4 documentary with Harvey\n\nGoldsmith attempting to reverse their failing\n\nprospects but to no avail.\n\nIf you want to see the worst display of people\n\nmanagement in radio, look no further than\n\nthe expert in tosspottery that is Chris Vezey.\n\n(Though I’d love to try his chilli, preferably\n\nwithout the onions)\n\nGary Williams may not have been the best\n\nbreakfast presenter, but that does not excuse\n\nthe rotten example of snooping on Vezey’s part,\n\nwhich makes Paul Chantler in “Lakesiders”\n\nseem far less tough.\n\nIt certainly spoke volumes regarding an\n\non-air tea party, as it reminded me of the identical\n\ngoings on at my student radio station at the time,\n\nwith regards to cliquey management.\n\nNot to mention my own on-air flaws, as I was\n\ninsistent on using my own JAM and TM jingles\n\non-air, which on a backwards perspective\n\nsounded ridiculous.\n\nJust listen to this for proof.\n\nhttps://robinblamires26.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/rb-jingles05.mp3\n\nThough as we’ll hear later in the series,\n\neven presenters in the bigger world of radio,\n\nbelieved that them and their close-harmony IDs\n\nwere of higher value than the rest of the station.\n\nBeing involved heavily in student radio, did cause\n\nme to lose perspective on what was really going on\n\nin the bigger world of radio, so it came as a shock\n\non returning to Canterbury that Christmas\n\nto hear Invicta FM under GCap transformed\n\ninto a GWR clone.\n\nMaybe that’s a bit unfair, as there were one or two\n\nformer GWR stations that did sound better than in\n\nEngland’s vandalised garden, and to be quite honest,\n\nthe swift transformation in Whitstable made the\n\nEssex FM takeover by GWR from 5 years earlier\n\nseem rather quaint.\n\nIt was more torturous having to hear it played at work,\n\nwhere they’d switched from KMFM, because on Invicta\n\n“it now plays more 80s songs!“.\n\nForced listening being one of the reasons why I\n\nleft that role not long after.\n\nThe strapline was indeed “The Best Mix Of The 80s,\n\n90s and Today” and saw presenters outside of\n\nbreakfast reduced to tight links and irritating teases\n\ninto ad breaks, trying hard not to mention\n\nthe artists names.\n\nGcap had been making their mark, with former\n\nLeicester Sound programme controller Craig Boddy\n\nbrought over to Whitstable, and changes to the\n\non-air sound that had been taking place\n\nsince September.\n\nLong serving presenter Simon West suddenly\n\ndisappeared in November, with co-presenter\n\nClaire Lawson moved to a 10-2 mid-morning slot,\n\nand Dave Bethell given an even longer timeslot\n\nfrom 2-7.\n\nFormer mid-morning host Neil Faraday\n\nhad also departed.\n\nThe Fridge remained in its usual timeslot\n\nwith Stephen Sullivan though he had his work\n\ncut out with an extra show on Friday nights.\n\nThe long running evening show seemingly\n\ncarried on, instead of the station opting for\n\n“Music Control” that aired on the rest of\n\nthe network.\n\nThough certain features like GCap’s “Back In\n\nThe Day” were also substituted for Invicta’s own\n\n“guess the year” feature “We Love (insert year)”\n\nheard at 20.38, later replaced by “The Invicta Years”.\n\nThey also strayed away from inserts such as\n\nMark Dennison’s competitions during daytime,\n\nand a revival of Simon Bates’ “Our Tune” as broadcast\n\non the other OneNetwork stations at lunchtimes.\n\nAnd the cherry on the top of this stale gateaux,\n\nGraham Torrington and Late Night Love, commencing\n\nin Kent in November, replacing the superior Jonathan Miles,\n\nwho moved to the now-defunct Capital Life on DAB.\n\nThe group news intro, adapted for the station\n\ncan be heard at 15.45 with Dave Wartnaby (nee Kelly)\n\nannouncing many familiar place names.\n\nIn the old GWR manner of justifying the mere\n\nmention of locations at the top of the hour,\n\nas a reflection of local radio.\n\nThe traffic ID at 19.18 however was one shared\n\nby Capital FM, and true audio anoraks will\n\nrecognise the car horns half-inched from\n\nSouthern Sound’s 1983 launch jingle\n\npackage by David Arnold.\n\nAs we’ll hear later on, Capital would be exempt\n\nfrom the programming style of the OneNetwork,\n\nthough the station itself under GCap would soon\n\nbe sounding very little like Capital as we knew it.\n\nAt 17.38, it’s James Heming and The Morning Zoo,\n\ncarrying on as usual with co-presenter Ali Wheeler\n\nwho had been there since Spring ’05.\n\nThe audio comes from their final show of 2005,\n\nthough this time the following year, it would be the\n\nfinal show as “The Morning Zoo” dropping the\n\nmoniker after 11 years, and switching to\n\n“James and Ali in the Morning”.\n\nAli playing centre stage at 18.20 as part of “The Morning\n\nZoo Kazoo”, a game later re-created by your’s truly\n\non an audio diary I made last year on our family’s\n\nXmas excursions.\n\n(The song that Ali’s tooting, “Don’t Let The Bells End”\n\nby The Darkness)\n\nThe jingles station-wide were a bit of a mess,\n\nwith Wise Buddah resings of Johnny Vaughan’s\n\njingles for the breakfast show (later dropped in\n\nLondon post relaunch) and a single Groove Addicts\n\nID from the 2003 package starting off each hour\n\nafter the news.\n\nThough it was quite a surprise to hear the\n\nXmas jingles from what was Invicta’s greatest\n\njingle package by Century 21, brought back to\n\nthe airwaves at 20.22, 15 years after they were\n\noriginally made.\n\nThey emerged via presenter Dave Bethell, who as\n\na composer for jingle producers TM Century got\n\nthe green light to remix the “Steamroller” jingles\n\nand it was so good hearing the classic melody logo\n\nfrom the station back on the air.\n\nThey simply cut through clearly, set to a\n\npresent-day backing beat, but retaining the\n\nunmissable punch that made them memorable\n\nin the early 90s.\n\nIt would have been great if they expanded on\n\nthe idea further in 2006, and they sounded far\n\nless garbled than when Capital tried doing\n\nthe same with their 90s jingles in late 2002.\n\nIn the long run however, it was disappointing\n\nto hear the station sloping, after a two year\n\nperiod where Invicta was seemingly getting better.\n\nMinor improvements took place after Christmas,\n\nwith the return of a drivetime show, or to give it\n\nit’s name “Kent’s Home Run” hosted by Neil Kefford,\n\npoached from Leicester Sound, and now on course\n\nto reaching his tenth anniversary in the timeslot.\n\nTravel reporter Andy Walker was also back on\n\nSaturday nights, with the ever-lively\n\n“Party Invicta”.\n\nThough by then he’d departed from road\n\nreporting, swapping the early starts after\n\n5 years for afternoons, handing the reigns\n\nto future Newsbeat reporter and overall\n\nsports nut Ben Mundy, who rather fittingly\n\nalso hosted “The Score” on Saturday afternoons.\n\nDeep down however, the station’s prospects\n\nwere pretty bleak.\n\nOh and that Coca Cola ad at 25.36…\n\nClever or confusing?\n\nElsewhere in Kent, KMFM now broadcasting on DAB,\n\nand online from most sites, were making\n\nchanges of their own.\n\nEarly ’06 saw a new evening show across\n\nEast Kent hosted by Chris Finn at 29.12, followed\n\nby a brand new late show hosted by Neil Faraday\n\nat 33.40 who since departing Invicta the previous\n\nautumn, had now come full circle,\n\nback at KMFM.\n\n“Late and Live” aimed to be different from\n\nall the love songs and dedications shows\n\nairing at the same time, and Neil appears\n\nmore than a little excited about it’s prospects.\n\nEspecially as he’d also have his work cut out\n\nhosting Ashford breakfast soon after.\n\nThe audio was recorded the night before\n\nI headed back to London oddly enough,\n\nand it did sound like things were improving\n\nin that timeslot.\n\nNeil’s show later got extended to 7pm,\n\nof which I can remember hearing\n\nthrough my portable radio whilst\n\nin hospital in September of ’07.\n\nIt was a little like listening to Tim Stewart\n\non Invicta FM in that same time slot 14 years\n\nearlier, not least as Gabrielle was guesting\n\non the show in both respects.\n\nKM’s IQ Beats jingles are still in use,\n\nbut with a slightly altered news intro at 28.38.\n\nOne of the others at 32.23 bares a melodic\n\nresemblance to the Phats and Small edit\n\nof Simply Red’s cover of “Ain’t That A Lot Of Love”.\n\nA tune initially recorded as a duet with\n\nTom Jones for his “Re:Load” album, and what\n\nquite frankly should have been “Simply Welsh”.\n\nThough as mentioned earlier, IQ Beats played\n\nto their strengths at housey-disco sounding IDs,\n\nas proved with their LBC and Heart packages.\n\nAlso worth mentioning the trail for Russ Lowe’s\n\nCanterbury breakfast show at 26.52, with “the voice”\n\nhimself Rik Scott, in the common case of one\n\nof the radio station’s presenters also doubling\n\nas the identification voice.\n\nA trait that’s had no influence on me whatsoever…\n\nAnd good to hear the vocals of Steve Butler at 27.22\n\non the Express Garage ad. A voice synomynous\n\nwith British radio jingles and ads.\n\nReturning to London at 38.07, and a short stopover\n\nat Smooth FM with Peter Young’s review\n\nof 2005’s soul tunes and reissues.\n\nPreceded by the short-lived “Sleep On A Bed Of Dreams”\n\njingle for the Dreams showrooms which that previous\n\nChristmas had become the sing-along-favourite\n\nat the holiday house my family stayed at.\n\nBy now I had drifted away from PY’s show,\n\nand had discovered stations such as Solar Radio,\n\nwhich played that sort of music all the time.\n\nThough as touched on earlier in the series,\n\nit didn’t necessarily mean they had many\n\ngood presenters, the worst being Junior Giscombe,\n\nwho shouted his way through the show,\n\neven playing his own songs!\n\nThe man who could have become the new\n\nStevie Wonder, but ended up as the\n\nnew Delbert Wilkins.\n\nAnd you thought his nephew Richard Blackwood was annoying…\n\nThere were one or two better presenters\n\non Solar, including the odd guest appearance\n\nfrom PY himself where he was much better\n\nsuited than on Smooth.\n\nNot helped by a gamble of grabbing the rights\n\nto live matches at Chelsea FC (39.51), Smooth London’s\n\nfortunes throughout 2006 weren’t looking good,\n\nnow with less listeners than they were as Jazz FM.\n\nDespite performing better in the North West,\n\nanother change in format was approaching.\n\nFollowing their purchase of the Saga stations,\n\nGMG issued a request from OFCOM to broaden\n\nout Smooth as an easy listening station\n\naimed towards over 50s.\n\nTheir request was upheld, and in March 2007\n\nSmooth FM and Saga relaunched as Smooth Radio,\n\nwith an almost new station line-up\n\nbut retaining Peter Young’s soul show\n\nin London.\n\nOther presenters included the surprise return\n\nof “The Boss In London”, the late Mike Allen\n\nhosting nights, and Mark Goodier on mid\n\nmornings in his first daily presenting gig\n\nin 10 years.\n\nGoodier being no stranger to GMG, having hosted\n\nthe Real Top 40 on Saturdays at Real Radio\n\nfrom Spring 2006.\n\nThis time round, the first song on all stations\n\nwas “A Star Is Born”.\n\nThe Smooth Radio relaunch was accompanied\n\nby a quite frankly grotesque TV ad campaign\n\nwhere Buddy Holly morphed into Diana Ross,\n\nwho in turn morphed into Rod Stewart.\n\nBut despite ditching mellow soul and R&B\n\nduring the day, the London station was still\n\ncontractually committed to a number of hours\n\nper week of jazz, an issue we’ll touch on\n\nlater in the series.\n\nNot helped by Mike Chadwick’s “Saturday Night\n\nExperience” switching in ’07 from Smooth to\n\nthe new DAB station “TheJazz” launched on\n\nChristmas Day 2006 by GCap, hoping they\n\nwould do for jazz what Classic FM did\n\nfor their respective genre.\n\nEven implementing a series of sonic IDs\n\nfrom David Arnold with a jazzy arrangement\n\nof the long standing Classic FM motif.\n\nThey could have used the equally memorable\n\none for Jazz FM, but GMG may have thrown\n\na wobbler.\n\nI can remember being on a visit to the GCap studios\n\nas part of my radio course not long after theJazz\n\nhad launched, and got a lot of stick from then\n\nproducer Matt Deegan over a blog I had written\n\nthe night before about both that,\n\nand sister station “Chill”.\n\nAnd you thought what I’m writing now is bollocks…\n\nAs I had a dreadful throat that day, I couldn’t even\n\nrespond back properly but it was funny, and indeed\n\nvery much deserved in hindsight.\n\ntheJazz wasn’t successful as hoped, and ahead of\n\nthe buyout by Global, was shut down in early 2008\n\nwith sister DAB station Planet Rock also under\n\nthreat but later saved by a consortium.\n\nChill also survived, though it was taken off DAB\n\nin 2009, much to the delight of my parents who\n\nhad to sit through it, what with it being\n\nmy station of choice during very serious hypomania.\n\nBack in early ’06, GCap were in a far buoyant mood,\n\nwith the much hyped relaunch of Capital Radio\n\non Monday January the 9th heard at 40.39.\n\nThe relaunch was disastrous, resulting in a\n\ncomplete lack of personality, and identity\n\nfor the station, with the presenters referring\n\nto it on air as “Capital Radio”, but the jingles\n\n(made in France by Soniic Design)\n\nsinging “Capital, as heard below.\n\nhttps://robinblamires26.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/capital_london_imaging_only_2006.mp3\n\nThe big selling point was that of shorter ad-breaks,\n\nwhich meant more of them positioned\n\nwithin the hour, but fitting in\n\nlonger music sweeps, as well as a bigger\n\nnews team following their well received\n\ncoverage of 7/7.\n\nAlas, the new Capital sounded confused, and it\n\nwas only the first of many relaunches over the\n\nfollowing three years that saw even more\n\nlisteners leaving the station, no longer aware\n\nof what it was meant to be.\n\nIt may have been an attempt to regain it’s past\n\nhistory, but with a more crowded London dial\n\nthan 20 years ago, that strategy soon vanished.\n\nManaging Director Keith Pringle and\n\nProgramme Controller Nik Goodman\n\nwho oversaw the relaunch left the station\n\nin April, with ex GWR programmer Scott Muller\n\njoining from Nova in Sydney, and taking over\n\nas Capital PC shortly after.\n\nThe station was relaunched as “Capital 95.8”\n\nin March ’07, bringing in personalities such as\n\nBam Bam, hosting an evening slot after\n\nbeing fired from Kiss 100’s breakfast show.\n\nThe jingle package was also changed to a\n\nrather abstract sounding one from Wise Buddah.\n\nMoyles returns at 42.33, also with new jingles\n\nbut unlike Capital not completely unfamiliar\n\nfrom what went before.\n\nThe 2006 theme was titled “Morning Glitz” adapted\n\nfrom the ones on the New York visit as heard in the\n\nlast episode and bringing brashness back to Radio 1.\n\nBy this period the show had started giving\n\nguests their own “Good Morning” acapellas,\n\nwith the former Leeds United manager David O’Leary\n\nbeing the first recipient.\n\nThe most memorable was probably Davina McCall\n\nthough Keith Chegwin went one step further by\n\nmaking his own one.\n\nAt 44.41, the short-lived replacement for Carpark Catchphrase\n\n“Beep Beep Busters” as hosted by… Roy Walker.\n\nThat was the first flaw of the rather complicated\n\nradio version of the ITV teatime quiz show, which\n\nhad already been parodied on the show years ago,\n\nwith the funnier and more cutting “Blob Busters”.\n\nThat said, the clip I’ve included from February,\n\nis probably even ruder, especially as Chris didn’t\n\nhave his buzzer ready to cut out the expletive\n\nthis time round.\n\nI’ve no idea why he got so carried away on\n\nthat instance, as surely there’s worse things\n\nthan a desperate sounding caller, capable of\n\nwinding him up to the point of accidentally\n\nlapsing into the vernacular live on air.\n\nThe chaos of it all means they run short of time,\n\nthough I find the noise used at 48.22, funnier\n\nthan “The Quiz Elephant” they later introduced.\n\nAKA the Time’s-Up sting from Millionaire.\n\n“Beep Beep Busters” was quietly dropped\n\nfrom the show at the end of March, and for\n\nthe rest of the year the last part of the show\n\nwas more of an excuse for free-wheeling\n\nand a lot of random TV theme tunes.\n\nThough Roy Walker wouldn’t be absent from\n\nThe Chris Moyles Show for too long.\n\nWith that in mind, interesting how all the\n\nhosts of Blockbusters on television,\n\nwere all radio broadcasters.\n\nAnd we head 0ver at 49.01 to the former home of\n\nits inaugural host, LBC 97.3 with Iain Lee now\n\npromoted to an even longer “afternoon wireless\n\nshow” lasting from 3-6:30pm.\n\nThis was part of another refresh of the\n\nschedules with Anna Raeburn now on\n\nearly afternoons, and Gary King hosting\n\nLBC’s Big Quiz every evening from 7pm.\n\nLee had established “Jerk It Out” by The Caesars\n\nas his main theme, as later adapted by\n\nSam and Mark on their CBBC series “Big Friday Wind Up”,\n\nmainly due to first line of the song.\n\nWhilst the extra half hour was a welcome\n\naddition, not many listeners were appreciative,\n\nincluding the rather bitter Perry heard phoning\n\nat, 49.33.\n\nThough it turned out that Perry may have had\n\nthe last laugh in the end as Iain was suspended\n\nfor a day, due to his slightly colourful retort after\n\nthe caller hung up second time round.\n\nAnd yet the BBC feel it’s less offensive for that sort of\n\nretort to air on their own channel via Clive Myrie,\n\nbut labelling a homophobic bigot for what they\n\nwere, that counts as a sacking offence.\n\nBack on track…\n\nDespite the show lasting three and a half hours,\n\nproducer Christian Mitchell AKA “Agent Chris”\n\nwas still only contracted to three hours\n\nallowing the final half hour to be devoted\n\nto Triple M – “Mick’s Mental Mayhem”\n\nowing to a typo.\n\nOriginally done on the last half hour of the\n\nFriday show, this feature was similar in style\n\nto Tommy Boyd’s “Human Zoo” on talkSPORT\n\nmany years ago, allowing callers to be put\n\nstraight through to air and given free reign\n\nof London’s airwaves.\n\nProvided they didn’t swear or say anything\n\nlibellous, to which they’d be subjected to the\n\nseven second delay, which lead to awkward\n\ninstances when Iain and the team had to wait\n\nfor it to build up again.\n\nA short burst of Triple M highlights can be heard at,\n\n53.11 and this particular selection resulted in me\n\ngetting a good mark at university, when used in an\n\noral presentation about TV, Radio and Everyday Life.\n\nIt also spread word about the show, which was\n\nquite a popular listen amongst fellow students\n\nat the time.\n\nMore of the same to follow in Episode 9.\n\nMid to late ’05 is the stopping point of WRUTSL\n\nepisode 7, where on the verge of returning to London\n\nto start a university course on the box of noise,\n\nI was getting into the habit of searching round\n\nthe online dial of the big city.\n\nThough as we’ll hear, a lot of it was changing,\n\nincluding where we start, with Richard Bacon’s\n\n“Go Home Show” on Capital FM, blending in\n\nnicely with his former Big Breakfast co-star\n\nJohnny Vaughan on breakfast.\n\nA well-thought title considering many within\n\nthe city would be crazy to drive at that time,\n\nBacon, a big radio man, just a few weeks into\n\nhis arrival, added to his brassy Wise Buddah\n\nhour openers, probably a first for Capital,\n\nsome Dallas sung jingles!\n\nResung from the a range of PAMS packages,\n\nthe more relaxed cut at 2.53, comes from the “Naturally”\n\npackage, which also happened to be used on\n\nMetro Radio in 1974, the first ILR to buy an\n\nAmerican jingle package in spite of Musicians\n\nUnion restrictions.\n\nNotice how they sing “Capital Radio” signifying\n\na hint of things to come at the station.\n\nAt 3.30, in the run up to the 2005 General Election,\n\nanother commercial radio get together was\n\nin order, but this time only for 90 minutes\n\non a Sunday morning with UK Leaders Live.\n\nHosted by Krishnan Guru-Murthy and\n\nMargherita Taylor, all three leaders of the\n\nmain political parties would face listeners\n\nquestions and what with the\n\npre-interview packages, be judged\n\non their music taste.\n\nFurther ILR simulcasts followed with two\n\nannual outings of “UK Music Week” which\n\namazingly I have no recollection, let alone\n\naudio of whatsoever.\n\nThough that may be down to them taking\n\nplace in the late spring of both 2006 and\n\n2007, at a time when I was heavily bogged\n\ndown in less than professional radio\n\ngoings-on of my own at university.\n\nWith the rise of Global Radio and their\n\nstance of doing things their way and for\n\nthemselves only, it was to be the last of\n\nsuch get-togethers.\n\nOn returning back to the John Wilson Business park\n\nat, a “Robot Rock” induced tease for “4 Tunes For A Fortune”.\n\nA competition that recurred for many years at the station\n\nthough this would probably be the last outing pre GCap.\n\nOh we’ve missed you. A trail for the Chris Moyles show at 11.53.\n\nAs there’s more from the show itself in\n\nthe series than there are trails, I thought\n\nit would be nice to hear just one, showcasing\n\nthe efforts of Radio 1’s station sound guys\n\nwho for 8 years had to listen back every day\n\nto grab highlights in the hope of enticing listeners.\n\nUnlike most local radio breakfast shows using\n\nthe otherwise tired trail technique, this managed\n\nto actually provide a reason to listen\n\nand occasionally, provide the laughs.\n\nAnd no it wasn’t intentional to include Moyles\n\nmimicking a cowboy, followed by PY doing the same\n\nat 15.47, after playing “Bonanza Ska“.\n\nA ska version of either the theme to the Western series\n\nor that song from Disney’s “Pinocchio”.\n\nFollowing the departure of Tony Blackburn’s\n\nReal Party Night in March, PY took over the\n\ntimeslot on Saturday nights, in addition to\n\nhis Sunday show.\n\nThe four hour “Funky Saturday Night” was a more\n\nupbeat affair than on Sundays, but sadly this was\n\nonly a temporary measure as the Sunday show itself,\n\nwould end up being moved to Saturday evenings\n\nwhen Smooth FM finally arrived in London that June.\n\nIt was enjoyable while it lasted, with PY on both\n\nSaturdays and Sundays, even if I did dip out for\n\nan hour on the Saturday to watch that evening’s\n\nepisode of Doctor Who.\n\nRichard Searling in the North West also hosted\n\nan extra show during this transitional period,\n\nthough on Real Radio, the boss himself John Myers\n\nunder the moniker of John Morgan took over\n\nthe Real Party Night.\n\nThe late Saturday night schedule was even\n\nmore complicated around this period,\n\nas Mike Chadwick’s show changed from\n\n“The Cutting Edge” to “The Saturday Night\n\nExperience”, and went out on 100.4 only, whilst\n\nin London, David Dunne formerly of Kiss 102\n\nlooked after the Cutting Edge in the last\n\nfew weeks of Jazz FM.\n\nThe jingles as heard throughout, were altered\n\nin preparation for the change, with the addition\n\nof the tagline “London’s Smooth Favourites”.\n\nPY’s final link in his inimitable style can be\n\nheard at 19.09, following one last dedication to\n\nToby Walker, whose superb “Soulwalkin” site\n\ncan be found here.\n\nI actually own a copy of “Strictly For Grown Ups” on\n\nvinyl, quite a special bit of plastic, not least as\n\nit was one of the first records I heard played by PY.\n\nI initially thought he sung it himself at first!\n\nThe lyrics just match his humour to a tee.\n\nAt 20.24, a brief appearance by Mark Walker,\n\nthe then programme controller of Jazz FM 102.2,\n\nbrought in since the changes in 2003, and in fact\n\nthe last voice to be heard on the station before\n\nthe name change.\n\nThough he can be heard now on the current Jazz FM,\n\nhosting afternoons.\n\nA few voices departed the station in the run up\n\nto the Smooth handover including Nicky Horne\n\nwho returned to Capital Gold, and Paul Gambacinni\n\nwho had hosted “The Jazz 30” countdown.\n\nThis saw the arrival of the late Kevin Greening,\n\nas heard at 12.27, and Angie Greaves, now at Magic 105.4\n\nand another of the nicest radio peeps I’ve\n\nhad the chance of meeting.\n\nShe was particularly courteous at last year’s\n\nRadio Festival in Salford, when I was in a bit of\n\na panic over the sudden absence of a certain\n\nradio producer who I knew really well.\n\nNot content with her duties at Smooth alone,\n\nGreaves also hosted an afternoon phone-in\n\non London’s LBC.\n\nAnd on that note, a tease of what’s to come later\n\nin this series at 20.44, Iain Lee on his first ever\n\nshow for LBC, starting off on a Friday, Saturday\n\nand Sunday slot between 10pm and 1am.\n\nAfter a less than successful year on Channel 4’s\n\nburnt out breakfast show RI:SE, Lee had stood in\n\non LBC throughout ’04 and was rewarded with\n\na regular timeslot that I quickly caught on to,\n\nlistening online in Canterbury after we’d\n\njust got wi-fi internet.\n\nLee’s show was less political in it’s agenda,\n\nand he had a team of callers known as\n\n“Correspondents” such as a video games\n\ncorrespondent, an “Ugly” correspondent,\n\nand a “TV Times In Human Form” correspondent.\n\nWhenever they popped up to give an\n\nupdate, they would be introduced by\n\nthe George Fenton penned BBC News outro\n\nfrom the 90s.\n\nWhich unintentionally included the LBC\n\nmelody logo within that sting.\n\nIf you listen hard enough.\n\nOther musical interludes popped up randomly,\n\nincluding on one instance, a burst of Neil\n\nDiamond’s ever-rousing “Beautiful Noise”.\n\nA song that along with The Killers’\n\n“Indie Rock And Roll” and the theme tune\n\nto “Charlie And Lola”, has the lesser-\n\nheard convention of a key-change\n\ngoing down in scale.\n\nLBC had been relaunched two years earlier\n\nafter being purchased by Chrysalis, switching\n\nthe rolling news service to AM, and\n\nre-inventing phone in shows on FM\n\nwith the tagline “Real Life Real London”.\n\nThe track playing under Lee is “Trick Me”\n\nby Kelis, though he also used a remix of\n\n“Finally” by CeCe Peniston as his theme as well.\n\nOther presenters made use of instrumental\n\nhooks of pop songs to introduce their shows,\n\nwith overnight host Bill Buckley opting\n\nfor Level 42’s “Something About You“.\n\nThe jingles were also rather nice, overseen\n\nby “Heather Jingles” AKA Chris Lowrie,\n\nand IQ Beats in Seattle.\n\nThey set the mood of a dim-lit London\n\nat night, with a housey-disco mood to them,\n\nwhich Global probably weren’t too sure about\n\non purchasing the station two years later.\n\nLee’s dedication to the show, including a\n\n14 night continuous stint standing in for\n\nClive Bull in August as well as his own show,\n\nsaw him promoted from weekend nights\n\nto drivetime in October, billing as\n\n“The Three Hour 4 Til 7 Iain Lee\n\nAfternoon Wireless Show”.\n\nTherefore allowing me to spend\n\nweekend nights out in London,\n\nthough weekend nightlife at university\n\nitself was more or less non-existent with\n\neveryone else going home at weekends.\n\nAt 23.03, we witness the arrival in London\n\nof 102.2 Smooth FM.\n\nUnfortunately I mislaid my recording of\n\nJazz FM’s London closedown, many years ago,\n\nthough they wound up on Friday the 27th of May\n\nwith their last song being less forward looking\n\nthan in the North West, Ella Fitzgerald\n\nand “Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye”.\n\nA prophecy on the less than certain\n\ncircumstances on the London station,\n\nwhich GMG chief executive John Myers\n\nstated had never made a profit during\n\nit’s 15 years on air as Jazz FM.\n\nThough that’s not necessarily true, as the\n\ncompany were in fact breaking even under\n\nthe late Richard Wheatley in charge, mainly\n\ndue to the station’s record label and Hed Kandi,\n\nwho continued to advertise on the station,\n\nas well as broadcasting their Saturday night\n\nshow of soulful house music.\n\nAlthough still going now, it’s safe to say\n\nHed Kandi died with the old Jazz FM,\n\nhaving gone more commercial and\n\neventually bought out by Ministry Of Sound.\n\nFounder Mark Doyle left to set up his own\n\nlabel “Fierce Angel” with soulful house\n\nleaning more towards that inspired by\n\nthe earlier days of Hed Kandi, reappearing\n\non the relaunched Jazz FM in 2008.\n\nAs explored in this article, it wasn’t an easy period.\n\nJazz FM became an internet only station\n\nbroadcasting non stop music via two rooms,\n\n“Red” and “Blue” on the former\n\neJazz.fm website.\n\nThe test broadcasts for Smooth FM commenced\n\nimmediately after, with the first song ironically\n\nbeing X Factor winner (even more ironic)\n\nSteve Brookstein’s version of “We’ve Only Just Begun”.\n\nThe launch sequence from Tuesday 7th of June\n\ncan be heard at 23.43, identical in structure\n\nto the one in the North West only substituted\n\nwith London place names, and very well constructed,\n\neven if the “24” sound effect may be\n\nover-dramatising it a bit.\n\nThough did they slip it in because listening\n\nto the station would feel like “the longest\n\nday of my life”?\n\nIn a departure for GMG the first song on\n\nSmooth London isn’t Barbara Streisand,\n\nbut Sade, as cued by special guest Lemar\n\nwhose own song was used to promote the\n\nnew station in the TV ads.\n\nThe Bespoke jingle package was adapted from\n\nthe one used in the North West with the addition\n\nof new soulful sounding cuts to fit in better\n\nwith the London area.\n\nThough sadly jarrring with the jazzier stuff,\n\nheard at 37.23.\n\nTwo indicators that GMG were treading more\n\ncarefully in the big city, cautious that the Jazz FM\n\nbrand was more popular there than up North,\n\nand gradually realising that what may work\n\non the radio in Manchester, may not go down\n\nas well with listeners in London.\n\nA similar situation to the early days of CTFM\n\nin my home town almost a decade earlier, of\n\nsetting up a radio station and aiming towards\n\nan audience that doesn’t exist.\n\nThe jazz requirements remained in place with\n\nSarah Ward’s evening show still present at 37.42,\n\nbut now renamed “The Smooth Selection”.\n\nPY also made a return in his new Saturday slot\n\nfrom 6 until 9pm, which following listener\n\ndemand also brought the Soul Cellar with him,\n\nmaking up the final hour of the show.\n\nHe responded to listeners congratulating him\n\non his new show in the usual witty manner;\n\n“What do you mean good luck? I’ve been on this station for 15 years!”\n\nThat’s PY through and through.\n\nThe station as a whole however was nothing\n\nto write home about, partly because London\n\nwould again soon be my home from the Autumn.\n\nJoking aside, one industry figure was optimistic\n\nabout the station’s arrival, describing it as\n\n“a good competitor for Magic and Heart”.\n\nOr to put it in other words, a battle of the blands.\n\nIt may explain why during my four years in London,\n\nI listened to very little commercial radio from the city.\n\nWe’re back in the Garden at 38.52, starting\n\nwith Dave Bethell promoting “Party In The Park”,\n\nwhich by now had upgraded from “Party In The Dark”.\n\nDave, a veteran of the area now a fully fledged\n\npresenter at Invicta FM following in the footsteps\n\nof his dad.\n\nFollowing Dave at 42.00, a slick-sounding\n\n6 Music-esque coming up trail which was\n\na really nice addition at the time, and a factor\n\nthat GCap may not have been too happy with,\n\nprobably because of its individuality,\n\nand the shows trailed had a reason for you to listen.\n\nRather than just the prospect of Adele coming up next.\n\nThe positive sounding station wasn’t to last,\n\nwith GCap slowly rearing their head,\n\nand the programming aspect falling towards\n\nthe GWR side of the business.\n\nProgramme controller Max Hailey was\n\nlet go in June 2005, (at an unfortunate time,\n\nthe week before 7/7 apparently) and by the\n\nend of ’05, Invicta would sound like a different\n\nstation altogether.\n\nNo more “Think About It Thursday”, that’s a given.\n\nOther side effects of the merger included\n\nthe selling off of 106 Century FM\n\nin the East Midlands to Chrysalis, with it\n\nbecoming the third Heart station\n\nin their network.\n\nOcean FM in Hampshire around this time\n\nbegan distancing itself from the Century format.\n\nIn late 2006 the remaining Century stations\n\nin the North East and North West were sold\n\nto GMG and back into the hands of John Myers,\n\nwho rebranded them back into Century Radio,\n\nwith resings of the Real Radio jingle package.\n\nThey went fully fledged as Real Radio in April 2009,\n\na few months after Myers’ departure, though it all went\n\nfull circle in 2014 when Global Radio got hold of\n\n(most of) the GMG stations after two years\n\nof hold-seperate.\n\nKMFM returns at 51.48, dropping the hyphen\n\nfrom its name, and with a new set of jingles\n\nintroduced in late 2004 from IQ Beats,\n\nresung from their Century FM package,\n\nalong with a few custom cuts.\n\nThe new jingles were a step-up from the\n\nprevious package, but both them, and a new\n\njazzed up logo (but also including the KM symbol),\n\ndid little "
