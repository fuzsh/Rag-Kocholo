        "text": "Things aren‚Äôt always quite as they seem. In the video below, you can see the morning sun breaking through, brightening the sky, when in reality, i had to stop filming, as at this very moment there was a sudden rain shower. During my 30 year time in the world of asset finance, I have lost count of the number of times that clients are tempted by an alternative offer, seemingly cheaper, only to then discover there are hidden fees, payments in advance etc, making the offer not quite as good as it first appeared. I believe in offering fairer finance, making the offering clearer and easier for the client to see the full picture. I also offer a free service to my clients where, if they are about to sign another company‚Äôs finance agreement, I cast another set of eyes over it, to make sure there are no ‚Äúgrey areas‚Äù What can I fund for you?\n\nPossibly the most accurate monologue of #lactation in the #USA. Great, couple things; #Feeding and #pumping has legal protection. The Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act says so. This includes; üöΩ - The pumping space cannot be a bathroom. ‚è≤ - In almost all situations, employers with fewer than 50 employees must provide the required \"break time\" and space. üë©üè´ - Legal right to receive pumping breaks and private space to nearly 9 million more workers, including teachers, registered nurses, farmworkers, and others. ‚öñ - If your company is not complying, you can file a lawsuit. üòë - Smiling is optional. Navigating pregnancy, birthing, and the 4th trimester is beyond hard work; the USA doesn't make it any easier. Get pumped about the #PumpAct, a positive win in the lactation space ‚Äì it's time to milk its benefits fully. üí¶ #niptips #InnovationinLactation #milkmade\n\nAnother example of unlocking the power of music in sports... The ability to 'soundtrack your sport' in this new era is going to become increasingly important when trying to resonate and engage with younger generations like Gen Z and Gen Alpha. It is fascinating to see increasing amounts of fan engagement strategies being underpinned by music. In 2022, we saw FC Barcelona's Partnership with Spotify bring the worlds of music and football together. 2023 saw the British Basketball League's Unbeatable Anthem tap in to the notion that young people today are more interested in sports lifestyle and culture than they are the sports itself. They tapped in to their cultural equity and ability to shape urban identity. Wolves Records was a ground-breaking new venture as the first-ever UK football team to launch a record label! Music is no longer about background noise or innings breaks. It is so much more than a spend - it's a valuable investment. It's a powerful asset that resonates with fans across generations. In this new era of sports, it is going to be important for sports and events to find their place in that landscape. What's the sound track for your sport?\n\nNew Post: Ring of Fire: Fury vs. Usyk Boxing Livestream ‚Äî How to Watch the Fight Card Live Online - https://lnkd.in/dAwh7HXR - All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors.
