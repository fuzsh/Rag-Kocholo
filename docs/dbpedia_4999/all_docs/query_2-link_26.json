        "text": "Overview\n\nStirling is one of Scotland’s greatest stone castles – an icon integral to how we understand the nation’s story. The castle peaked in importance in the 1500s, but its volcanic crag has been fortified since ancient times.\n\nGenerations of Scottish monarchs have enlarged, adapted and embellished Stirling Castle. Explore its three main enclosures, and then admire the refurbished Royal Palace – childhood home of Mary Queen of Scots. The palace’s lavish design drew on European Renaissance fashions to show off James V’s power and good taste.\n\nWe have recreated the palace interiors as they may have looked when the Scottish king’s grand scheme was complete.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Great Hall\n\nThe Great Hall is the largest medieval banqueting hall ever built in Scotland. Completed for James IV in 1503, it has four pairs of tall windows at the dais end, where the king and queen sat. The exterior walls are a distinctive colour, rendered in Royal Gold harling, as they would have been in the 1500s.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Royal Palace\n\nSplendidly decorated and furnished, the palace of James V recalls the years when the castle was the childhood home of Mary Queen of Scots. Costumed interpreters set the 1500s scene and talk about the palace and the intrigues which took place within its walls.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Chapel Royal\n\nThis elegant chapel was built in just seven months on the orders of James VI for the baptism of his son and heir Prince Henry. Dating from 1593-4, it was one of the first Protestant kirks in Scotland and also the last royal building at the castle.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Great Kitchens\n\nPies, puddings, venison, salmon, prime beef – only the very best was good enough for royalty. See what life was like for the men, women and children who prepared the feasts for kings and queens, and baked the daily bread for servants.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nQueen Anne Gardens\n\nThere may have been a royal garden here since the 1400s and the flat lawn was turned into a bowling green in the 1620s. Shade beneath the lovely beech tree which is over 200 years old. You can also enjoy the family trail in the Unicorn Garden.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Stirling Tapestries\n\nIntricate and beautiful, this set of seven hand-woven tapestries hangs on the walls of the Queen’s Inner Hall in the royal palace. They are closely based on the Hunt of the Unicorn series which were created in the early 1500s. The huge new tapestries were created in a 13-year, £2 million project.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Palace Vault\n\nThe palace vaults have fun, interactive exhibitions especially for younger visitors. Have fun and find out about the music, paints, tools, fabrics and jokes of the 1500s.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Castle Exhibition\n\nExplore the Stirling Castle story, from the earliest times to the present day. Discover how the castle changed times eight times in 50 years, delve into story of the mysterious medieval burials beneath a lost royal chapel and find out about the castle’s impressive artists.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nStirling Heads Gallery\n\nThe Stirling Heads are one of Scotland’s great art treasures – metre-wide 16th-century oak medallions carved with images of kings, queens, nobles, Roman emperors and characters from the Bible and Classical mythology.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe Access Gallery\n\nDiscover parts of the castle that are hard to access with displays, images and interactives. Find out about the royal palace and the many crafts involved in creating its sumptuous furniture and décor.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nRegimental Museum\n\nThe links between Stirling Castle and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders reach back through 200 years of distinguished service. Home to a wealth of military treasures and artefacts, the museum brings the rich cultural links of one of Scotland’s great Highland regiments to life.\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nTest your castle knowledge\n\nTake our fun fact-finding quiz. Available in English, French, Gaelic, German, Italian, Japanese, Scots, Simplified Chinese and Spanish)\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nThe King's Knot and Royal Park\n\nEnjoy majestic views of the King’s Knot and Royal Park, which were once royal properties associated with the castle. Imagine the great battles that took place around the castle as you look towards the southern Highlands and the Ochil Hills.\n\nTours\n\nDiscover the people and events which have shaped the castle's past with a tour.
