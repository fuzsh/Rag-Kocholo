Unfortunately Sue McKenzie is no longer performing at this show.\n\nMade possible with support from British Council.\n\nPlease note that this show has a mix of floor and standard unreserved seating.\n\n“JAZZ-BẢN ĐỊA” (Indigenous Jazz) is a concept about a music genre, a style seemingly shaped by the serendipitous encounter between the Jazz saxophonist Quyền Thiện Đắc and the creative group of musicians Đàn Đó. The journey with jazz music of Jazz saxophonist Quyen Thien Dac influenced by his family’s traditional musical background. His musical path involved persistent study and research abroad. After graduating from the Hanoi Conservatory of Music, he earned a scholarship to Berklee College of Music in the United States, followed by a master’s degree at Malmo University in Sweden. His return to Vietnam brought a foundation of Western knowledge along with ambitious thoughts about paving the way for a jazz style with the spirit of Vietnamese soul.\n\nĐàn Đó will be collaborating with 3 Scottish musicians for this unique concert as the culmination of a week-long residency in the Highlands:\n\nTom Bancroft – drums\n\nAli Levack – whistle/pipes\n\nJames Mackay – guitar\n\nĐÀN ĐÓ Facebook\n\n7:00 pm doors, 7:30 pm start time\n\nOver 14s, under 16s accompanied by an adult over 18\n\nYou may also like\n\nFERGUS MCCREADIE TRIO Plus India Blue\n\nFri 21st June at 7:00pm\n\nMackintosh Church\n\nMore\n\nKYOTO JAZZ MASSIVE Plus Rebecca Vasmant\n\nFri 21st June at 7:30pm\n\nOran Mor\n\nMore\n\nGlasgow Improvisers Orchestra with ORPHY ROBINSON\n\nSun 23rd June at 1:00pm\n\nSt Lukes\n\nMore\n\nNice n Sleazy Buy Tickets Remove from My Festival\n\nWed 19th June at 7:30pm\n\nNorman&Corrie\n\nPlus Juliette Lemoine & Chris Amer\n\nNorman Willmore & Corrie Dick plus support from Juliette Lemoine & Chris Amer\n\nNorman&Corrie, the Scottish musical duo, have swiftly built a reputation for delivering captivating concerts filled with spontaneity, heart, and an extraordinary connection that defies their youth. Their performances consistently leave audiences feeling uplifted and inspired. These two musicians are dedicated to breathing new life into ancient melodies for the contemporary world. With deep respect for their shared heritage, they bridge the gap between tradition and innovation, infusing ancestral melodies with modern production techniques and instruments.\n\nTheir unique setup, featuring a drum kit, saxophone, and organ foot pedals, combined with expert sound design, results in music that’s both vibrant and firmly rooted. Norman and Corrie are immersed in the folk and jazz scene, Corrie performing with Dinosaur, Jacob Collier, and Rob Luft, and Norman working with The Peatbog Faeries and Beth Orton. Together, they bring to life a project that reflects their shared Scottish identity. As ECM recording artist Huw Warren notes: “Their sound is enticing and thoughtfully matches the content, offering a new form from separate musical styles.”\n\nWhile challenging traditional notions of folk music, Norman&Corrie hold dear the qualities that have made this genre timeless: honesty, resilience, and a deep connection to life’s stories. With diverse backgrounds and a spirit of exploration, their performances transport listeners to a time when life moved at a slower, more deliberate pace, using drones, ancestral melodies, and field recordings to create an immersive experience. In a significant milestone, they’ve received support from Creative Scotland to establish a residence in Shetland, where they’ll learn from tradition-bearers and explore archives of scores and recordings. This creative journey will be documented, leading to the release of their debut album and a companion documentary in 2024.\n\nMartin Green (Lau) – “It is a rare and wonderful thing to encounter genuinely original music, the salt-bite of the North Isles is thrust head-first into a brave new experimental world. Here we have two musicians transcending both jazz and folk; utterly in control, and creating a singular voice like no other”\n\nAdrian Utley (Portishead) – ‘Thank you Norman and Corrie for these beautiful interpretations. You are so authentic and speak of old music but are genuinely contemporary to my ears. Powerful and assured.\n\nRuth Goller (Melt Yourself Down, Sam Amidon) -“Waking up in cold rainy Helsinki this morning, listening to this music, I felt loved, warm and connected to the world around me, although finding myself in foreign lands. I love the soft sounds embracing me. The folky meldies take me back to my second home, the fields where I walk everyday and look over the horizons. The drones allow me time to be, to think and not to rush to whatever is coming next, then rhythms remind me to carry on with my head high and to think positive.

They have already been championed by Jazz FM (playlisting debut single ‘Ruptura’ for six consecutive weeks and counting) and BBC Radio Scotland, all of which lead to Mama Terra signing with Acid Jazz.\n\nMama Terra recreate songs from the classic album ‘Head Hunters’ by Herbie Hancock, in their own sound, that they first performed live to great acclaim for Jazz FM as part of their classic album series to celebrate the album turning 50 years old.

Ticket buyers will be refunded via their ticket outlet.\n\nJim Mullen with Peter Johnstone and Alyn Cosker\n\nTwo generations of grooving Scottish jazz mastery combine in this mouthwatering prospect. Jim Mullen is one of the most distinctive guitarists in jazz, a player whose instantly recognisable thumb-picking style and soulful, bluesy phrasing have an almost vocal quality. A native Glaswegian, Mullen moved to London in the late 1960s and worked with Cream lyricist Pete Brown before joining acid jazz godfather Brian Auger’s Oblivion Express and soul-funk band Kokomo. A period in New York led to work with the Average White Band and flautist Herbie Mann and the formation of the hugely popular, long-running jazz-funk band Morrissey-Mullen with saxophonist Dick Morrissey. Mullen has since played and recorded with a host of top names including big-swinging pianist Gene Harris, blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon and Chicago folk-jazz poet Terry Callier, who described Mullen as “God”.\n\nPeter Johnstone’s reputation as a Hammond organ virtuoso has grown with the formation of his International Organ Quartet, featuring New York vibes marvel Joe Locke, saxophonist Tommy Smith and drummer Alyn Cosker, and his work with guitarist Nigel Price and saxophonist Paul Towndrow. Already internationally acclaimed as the phenomenal pianist with the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra and Tommy Smith’s ‘Coltrane’ quartet, Johnstone is a former Young Scottish Jazz Musician of the Year and a Yamaha Scholarship holder whose keyboard creativity is unfailingly exciting and spontaneous.\n\nWith a range of experience that includes gigs with Steely Dan guitarist Larry Carlton, singer Carol Kidd, pop-soulsters Hue & Cry and Gaelic folk rockers Capercaillie, Alyn Cosker is one of the most in-demand drummers in the UK. As well as providing the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra’s dynamic heartbeat, he leads his own group and is an accomplished composer with two albums under his own name.\n\nYou may also like\n\nHAMISH STUART BAND\n\nSat 22nd June at 7:30pm\n\nOran Mor\n\nMore\n\nMAMA TERRA HEAD HUNTERS\n\nThu 20th June at 7:30pm\n\nSt Lukes\n\nMore\n\nFERGUS MCCREADIE TRIO Plus India Blue\n\nFri 21st June at 7:00pm\n\nMackintosh Church\n\nMore\n\nOran Mor Buy Tickets Remove from My Festival\n\nFri 21st June at 7:30pm\n\nKYOTO JAZZ MASSIVE\n\nPlus Rebecca Vasmant\n\nWith support from Rebecca Vasmant (DJ set)\n\nKYOTO JAZZ MASSIVE is an innovative project led by two hugely influential DJs and artists among the Japanese music scene in Shuya Okino (Kyoto Jazz Sextet & owner of The Room in Shibuya) and Yoshihiro Okino (owner of Especial Records).\n\nRevealed and named KYOTO JAZZ MASSIVE by Gilles Peterson in the early 90’s, the DJ duo formed by OKINO brothers, pioneered Japanese club jazz and crossover music worldwide. In 1994, their first production came out, a compilation entitled “KYOTO JAZZ MASSIVE V.A.”. But their breakthrough came while signing their first single “ECLIPSE” on the German label Compost, followed in 2000 by their milestone album “SPIRIT OF THE SUN” ! KJM gained international recognition, as both critics and audience acclaimed their innovative crossover style, blending electro, jazz, house, funk and broken beats.\n\nIn 2004, they formed the “Kyoto Jazz Massive Live Set” featuring Vanessa Freeman and Tasita D’Mour on vocals, which performed throughout Europe and Asia (from the Tokyo Crossover Jazz Festival to the North Sea Jazz Festival). Thereafter, numerous collaborations and remixes were released as well as several EP’s, earning them the reputation of outstanding producers.\n\nIn the meantime, Shuya Okino followed his own path, as a recognized DJ, traveling all through the globe and also producing a number of successful artists such as Mondo Grosso, Sleep Walker, Cosmic Village, Hajime Yoshizawa, ROOT SOUL and DJ KAWASAKI. He even made a name for himself as a writer, with three successful books “What makes a good DJ”, “The first Jazz Club book” and the business book ‘Filter your thinking for success’.\n\nIn 2006, he finally released his first remarkable solo album “United Legends”, for which he invited ten vocalists and ten producers only communicating using Email. This unprecedented technique of making music has made it of special interest to the music scene.\n\nWith “Destiny” in 2011, Shuya made it big by bringing together Navasha Daya (Gil Scott Heron’s niece), N’Dea Davenport, Clara Hill, Divinity and Pete Simpson. The single “Still In Love”, the Rose Royce’s disco hit cover, is a banger, played by many DJ’s around the world, Giles Peterson for BBC Radio One, Kevin Beadle, Patrick Forge among many others. Several remixes of “Still In Love” were even compiled as a special release on Defected Records.\n\nSince 2015, Shuya Okino revives the Kyoto Jazz brand under the name Sextet, producing two magnificent albums with spiritual and straight ahead jazz influences inspired by the likes of the great Pharoah Sanders.\n\nBut it was not until 2022 that Kyoto Jazz Massive returned with their (only) second and long-anticipated album. The wait has definitely been worth it as Kyoto Jazz Massive have once again delivered another incredible genre-defying recording that continues to be forward looking. With “Message From A New Dawn”, KJM offers an ultimate vision of a modern, deep and jazz dancefloor crossover, including elements of house, afrobeat, soul and funk. Not to mention the irresistible voice of Vanessa Freeman and the exceptional participation of legendary Roy Ayers!\n\nAfter a 15 years hiatus away from the European stages, Shuya Okino decided to support KJM’s new release with a small tour in the UK and France, pulling up a brand new line up. Led by Shuya Okino and featuring Vanessa Freeman on lead vocals, this powerful backing band based in Paris and named Echoes Of A New Dawn Orchestra, has provided outstanding performances and sold out several shows in Paris New Morning and London Jazz Cafe, followed by acclaimed participation at Southport Weekender and We Out Here festivals in 2023.\n\n2024 will be Kyoto Jazz Massive 30th anniversary, promising and announcing several live celebrations across Europe, along with brand new material and recordings such as a collaboration LP with The Echoes Of A New Dawn Orchestra, including their amazing rendition of KJM classic broken house anthem, Substream.\n\nShuya OKINO (musical director, vocal, percussions)\n\nVanessa FREEMAN (lead vocal)\n\nIndy EKA (lvocal)\n\nAgyei OSEI (vocal)\n\nJean-Baptiste PALIES (drums)\n\nCarel CLERIL (bass)\n\nEli FROT (keyboards)\n\nKevin LEBELLEC (guitar)\n\nOlivier MICONI (trumpet, keys)\n\nJames MÜLLER (percussions)\n\n7:30 pm doors, 7:30 pm start time\n\nOver 14s, under 16s to accompanied by an adult over 18\n\nYou may also like\n\nNIMBUS SEXTET with Special Guests\n\nSun 23rd June at 7:30pm\n\nNICE N SLEAZY\n\nMore\n\nBLACK SABBATH MODE\n\nThu 20th June at 7:30pm\n\nNice n Sleazy\n\nMore\n\nMAMA TERRA HEAD HUNTERS\n\nThu 20th June at 7:30pm\n\nSt Lukes\n\nMore\n\nOran Mor Buy Tickets Remove from My Festival\n\nSat 22nd June at 7:30pm\n\nHAMISH STUART BAND\n\nHamish Stuart Band (no support – playing two sets)\n\nHamish Stuart is a British guitarist, bassist, singer, composer and record producer. He was an original member of the Average White Band between 1972 and 1982, a Scottish funk and R&B band that had a series of soul and disco hits. They are best known for their million-selling instrumental track Pick Up the Pieces, and their albums AWB and Cut the Cake. The band has influenced others, such as the Brand New Heavies, and been sampled by various musicians, including the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, TLC, The Beatnuts, Too Short, Ice Cube, Eric B. & Rakim, Nas, A Tribe Called Quest, Christina Milian, and Arrested Development, making them one of the sampled acts in history. In 1975, the single Pick Up the Pieces, taken from the #1 AWB album, reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song knocked Linda Ronstadt’s You’re No Good out of #1 and sold over one million copies. It was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America. It also prompted The J.B.’s, the backup band of the “Godfather of Soul”, James Brown, to record and release a song in reply, Pick Up the Pieces, One by One, under the name AABB (Above Average Black Band). It was both a tribute to AWB’s knowledge of funk and a tongue-in-cheek play on the Scottish band’s name.\n\nThereafter, Hamish Stuart went on to work with Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan and David Sanborn. He wrote Atlantic Starr’s 1986 hit If Your Heart Isn’t in It and songs for Smokey Robinson, Jeffrey Osborne, George Benson and Diana Ross. He joined Paul McCartney’s band (where he switched between guitar and bass as necessary with McCartney) for McCartney’s 1989 comeback album, Flowers in the Dirt, and appeared on several other albums and Sir Paul’s world tours of 1989 and 1993. After collaborating on numerous albums for other artists, he recorded his first solo album, Sooner or Later, in 1999.\n\nIn 2006, Hamish Stuart toured as the bass player with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. He joined Starr again for a 2008 tour, where he performed Pick Up the Pieces and Work to Do. He once again toured with the band in 2019 playing those songs plus Cut the Cake. And will be touring again with Ringo in the US May/June and Sept/Oct 2022.\n\nIn July 2015, Hamish Stuart reunited with two of his Average White Band bandmates to form The 360 Band. This is in essence one half of the original Average White Band and they released an album titled Three Sixty in 2017. Amish and his group have been performing live together along with supporting musicians.\n\nIn recognition of his unique contribution to music, in 2016, Hamish Stuart was awarded with a BASCA (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors), Gold Badge award. Now known as the Ivor Novello Awards, the awards, which were founded in 1974, recognize exceptional people from across the industry who have made a unique contribution to British music. Among the 12 individuals to also receive Gold Badges were The Kinks legend Ray Davies, singer Dame Cleo Lane and composer Neil Brand.\n\nHamish Stuart – vocals and guitar\n\nJeremy Stacey – drums\n\nSteve Pearce – bass\n\nAdam Phillips – guitar\n\nJim Watson – keys\n\nJim Hunt – sax\n\n7:30 pm doors, 8:00 pm start time\n\nOver 14s, under 16s to accompanied by an adult over 18\n\nYou may also like\n\nkitti’s Caledonian Songbook\n\nFri 21st June at 7:30pm\n\nSt Lukes\n\nMore\n\nKYOTO JAZZ MASSIVE Plus Rebecca Vasmant\n\nFri 21st June at 7:30pm\n\nOran Mor\n\nMore\n\nMAMA TERRA HEAD HUNTERS\n\nThu 20th June at 7:30pm\n\nSt Lukes\n\nMore\n\nSt Lukes Buy Tickets Remove from My Festival\n\nSat 22nd June at 1:00pm\n\nBEN SHANKLAND TRIO\n\nBen Shankland with Chun-Wei Kang & Ali Watson\n\nWinner of 2023 BBC Radio Scotland Young Jazz Musician of the Year, Edinburgh-born pianist and composer Ben Shankland is, despite his young age, already gaining recognition on the UK jazz scene. He began his musical journey studying classical piano and bassoon, which greatly developed his general musicality before finding an interest in jazz in his teens. Before long, he was hooked and began honing his craft as a member of Scotland’s finest youth jazz orchestras, with mentorship from pianists John Turville and Alan Benzie, and saxophonists Tommy Smith and Mike Williams.\n\n​\n\nCurrently, he performs with his trio regularly around the country, exploring his original compositions with Ewan Hastie and Chun-Wei Kang. He is also active as a solo pianist, an interest which developed out of his classical background and inspiration from the music of Fred Hersch. In addition to his work as a leader, Ben has performed and recorded as a sideman in various bands with fellow young musicians.\n\nAlongside his primary focus in improvised music, Ben continues to perform in the classical world. Notably, he recently accompanied BBC Young Musician 2022 percussionist Jordan Ashman in an award-winning recital, and was the soloist in three performances of George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue with the Edinburgh Youth Orchestra. His ability to engage and connect with audiences at his young age truly sets him apart as one to watch in the years to come.\n\n‘Easeful harmonising and sureness of touch leave one eager to hear more from Shankland in the future’\n\n– Scottish Jazz Space\n\n‘He is the perfect all-round musician, thoroughly grounded in the history and feel of jazz.’\n\n– John Turville, Jazz Pianist\n\n‘Great effervescence and jazz creativity’\n\n– Tommy Smith, Jazz Saxophonist\n\n1:00 pm doors, 1:30 pm start time\n\nAll ages, under 16s to accompanied by an adult over 18\n\nYou may also like\n\nNorman&Corrie Plus Juliette Lemoine & Chris Amer\n\nWed 19th June at 7:30pm\n\nNice n Sleazy\n\nMore\n\nFERGUS MCCREADIE TRIO Plus India Blue\n\nFri 21st June at 7:00pm\n\nMackintosh Church\n\nMore\n\nMARIANNE MCGREGOR & BRIAN KELLOCK\n\nSat 22nd June at 8:00pm\n\nThe Griffin\n\nMore\n\nThe Glad Cafe Buy Tickets Remove from My Festival\n\nSat 22nd June at 1:00pm\n\nFaye MacCalman\n\nand DAVID BOWDEN\n\n‘Providing food for thought on what jazz is and can become’ – Kevin Le Gendre (British Council, BBC, The Independent)\n\nFaye MacCalman is a performer, composer-songwriter and improviser on saxophone, clarinet, voice and electronics.

Her lyrics are prominent and raw whilst her gentle accompanying guitar and layered vocal harmony wraps you in a blanket and hugs you. Her sound is influenced by her classical vocal roots, by the storytelling of folk artists and by contemporary urban tales and ambient sounds, culminating in a modern, hushed and intense experience that soothes yet soars.\n\nPippa graduated from the Royal conservatoire of Scotland in 2022 with a degree in Mezzo-Soprano voice, initially aspiring to be an Opera singer her passions naturally led her to song-writing and composition. She found her true belonging in the pubs, clubs and venues of Glasgow’s thriving contemporary music scene. Her debut EP, “Sisters,” was launched in September 2023 as a set of four stripped back and reflective tracks. Pippa writes, “Sisters is about my constant journey of understanding what womanhood means to me. It’s an interrogation of the women in my life, and the intricacies of being a young woman in her early 20s. It’s about how my mother raised me, how she upset me, how she loved me. It’s about friendship, understanding love, and being a woman in love. It’s an ode to the messy, and the beautiful. It’s about sisters.”\n\nPippa was one of the 5 nominated artists for the Sound of Young Scotland in the 2023 Scottish Album of the Year awards and listed as an exciting upcoming act in 2024 by The List magazine. Radio Scotland’s Vic Galloway named her as a Top 25 Artist to watch in 2024.\n\nYou may also like\n\nFaye MacCalman and DAVID BOWDEN\n\nSat 22nd June at 1:00pm\n\nThe Glad Cafe\n\nMore\n\nMICHELLE WILLIS TRIO\n\nWed 19th June at 7:30pm\n\nThe Glad Cafe\n\nMore\n\nkitti’s Caledonian Songbook\n\nFri 21st June at 7:30pm\n\nSt Lukes\n\nMore"
