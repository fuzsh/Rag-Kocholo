        "text": "The Glasgow High School Site-Based Decision-Making (SBDM) Council is set to hold a special-called meeting on Thursday, August 8. The meeting will address a range of significant issues impacting the school community, from policy amendments to new business initiatives.\n\nThe agenda for the meeting is packed with important topics, beginning with the call to order and roll call, followed by the introduction of guests. After the approval of the meeting agenda and the minutes from the May 22, special-called meeting, the council will move on to previous business, including the SBDM special election.\n\nIn the new business section, the council will review several critical documents and acts, such as the Kentucky Open Records and Open Meetings Act, KRS 158.195, and KRS 158.183, which pertain to managing government records and ensuring transparency. Additionally, there will be discussions on SBDM training and the establishment of regular meeting dates and times.\n\nA major part of the meeting will be dedicated to approving the final master schedule and reviewing the Comprehensive School Improvement Plan (CSIP). One of the most anticipated discussions involves amendments to the student handbook, particularly regarding dress codes. The proposed changes outline specific guidelines on student attire, emphasizing the need for appropriate dress that does not distract from the educational environment. The amendments address the length of shorts, skirts, and jeans, as well as stipulations on tops, accessories, and the prohibition of certain items like trench coats and spiked accessories.\n\nThe council will also review and potentially approve new by-laws and policies, along with the Extended School Services (ESS) plan. Upcoming overnight trips for the baseball team and the Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) will be considered as well.\n\nThe finance section of the meeting will cover budget finalizations, including the SBDM budget, Title I funds, and Career and Technical Education (CTE) funding. Following these discussions, the council will enter into a closed session as required by state law, to discuss recommendations for hiring new staff in the band, math, and instructional assistant departments.\n\nReturning to open session, the council will address staffing needs, specifically in the physics/math area, before opening the floor for audience comments. The meeting will conclude with setting the date for the next meeting and adjournment.\n\nThe special-called meeting promises to be a critical session for Glasgow High School, setting the stage for the upcoming academic year and ensuring the continued smooth operation of the school. Community members and stakeholders are encouraged to attend and participate in this important event."
