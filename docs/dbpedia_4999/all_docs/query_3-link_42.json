        "text": "üëã I‚Äôve made quite a few new connections recently so wanted to do a quick reintroduction. Before founding Research Your Way Ltd in 2019, I was an academic in the UK and Ireland for 18 years. I‚Äôm a mixed-methods social scientist which means I have experience of a huge variety of tools to draw upon in evaluations and consultations. I love collaborating on projects. I was inspired to work in social research and evaluation by Mark Llewellyn. He was a great mentor during my undergraduate degree and was my line manager at Opinion Research Services, where I worked before re-entering academia to take up a Marie Curie Fellowship at University College Cork in 2006. I decided to leave academia (again!) in 2019 for a variety of reasons which I talk about quite a lot in the free Facebook Group I run: https://lnkd.in/eZA_6Ehu You can read more about why academics are choosing to leave academia in a recent Nature article I was quoted in (link in the comments). I really love the evaluation and impact projects I do with charities, social enterprises and organisations. It's wonderful to see the passion that people have to improve people's lives and communities. Some of my work also involves partnering with universities to support and develop research impact, knowledge exchange networks and co-designed projects. Oh, and a random fact about me: I have published two children‚Äôs books! My academic research focuses on family migration, often using participatory methods with children. I put this insight into the books, one of which was co-produced with my daughter. I love helping to make sure that research and evaluation make a difference - for individuals and communities. If you need this support, do get in touch. #Evaluation #SocialResearch #AcademicCareers #ResearchImpact #AltAc\n\nThe Power of Our Community: WE Today, we wanted to share a fundamental truth that lies at the heart of our company, \"We Study, We Grow\" - the importance of community a.k.a. WE. Communities provide a unique foundation for growth and success. They are places where ideas are born, where support is readily available, and where collective knowledge thrives. Here's why we are so passionate about building and nurturing our \"We Study, We Grow\" community: - Support System: In our community, we find support, encouragement, and motivation. We celebrate each other's wins and offer a helping hand during challenging times. - Knowledge Sharing: Knowledge is power, and within our community, we have a wealth of expertise to tap into. Sharing insights, experiences, and best practices elevates us all. - Networking: Building meaningful connections is essential for students. Our community serves as a powerful networking platform, connecting us with like-minded individuals and potential partners. - Innovation: The synergy within our community fuels innovation. Collaboration sparks creativity and leads to groundbreaking solutions. - Collective Growth: As \"We Study, We Grow,\" so does our community. Together, we create a ripple effect of positive change, not only for ourselves but for those around us. Let's keep nurturing and expanding our \"We Study, We Grow\" community because together, we're not just building a company; we're creating a movement that empowers individuals to grow! Let‚Äôs grow together! #CommunityBuilding #Community #WeStudyWeGrow #EducationMatters #TogetherWeSucceed\n\nWhat do those working in the UK research system think are the benefits of - and the barriers to - increasing public involvement and engagement in R&D? And what are the solutions and trade-offs we should consider if we are to develop a truly society-centred, long-term vision for R&D in the UK? These are some of the questions Campaign for Science and Engineering explored with 50 organisations from across sectors, disciplines and places, to support our #DiscoveryDecade People's Vision for R&D project - a deliberative dialogue exercise exploring society's stake in R&D. Today we've published a report summarising what we heard, all of which will inform the materials for the public discussions in May. üí° Just some of the benefits of public involvement included identifying new research questions, challenging norms within R&D, and building stronger connections between researchers and public audiences ‚è± But there are barriers, including a lack of time and resource, and imbalances in opportunities that prevent truly inclusive involvement üí≠ Participants recognised the need for a fundamental culture change - which needs time, space and support - alongside increased honesty and transparency, prioritisation and long-term funding We also gathered 2Ô∏è‚É£ 0Ô∏è‚É£ 0Ô∏è‚É£ amazing examples of ways in which the public are already involved or engaged in research - from co-design to communication, strategy-setting to citizen science. Learning about these has been amazing - and I'm keen to add to the list, so if you have a favourite project send it my way! Finally, a huge thank you to everyone who took the time to share their expertise with us. You can read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eNC-EK7m\n\nüåü Thank You for Joining Us at the Seeds of Tomorrow Workshop Day! üåü We had an incredible day and we hope you did too!

Rather, they develop a training program purposely intended to help them build the skills and practices required to successfully complete the marathon they registered for months in advance. Equity, diversity, and inclusion work is no different. Like a marathon, it requires the same intentionality, the same stamina, and the same commitment to training. Through this 2-part workshop series, participants will be introduced to a number of skills and practices required to participate in the ongoing marathon of social justice. More specifically, participants will learn how to support shared experiences of dignity by focusing on relationship-building and communication with the overall goal of intervening in systems that reduce access and opportunity. Intended to move beyond content-based EDI training, this workshop is meant for individuals who have started or are strongly interested in doing this work within their organizations and are open to recognizing there may be a disconnect between their good intentions and the ways those intentions may be experienced by folks from historically excluded (or equity-denied) groups. Presenter: Nathan Viktor Fawaz (they/them) is working on a PhD in the Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation at the University of Alberta. Nathan is especially curious about ways we can think about being together that are affirming, equitable, and non-exiling. Their writing, speaking, artwork, and workshops all ask questions about how people can be together with dignity. Nathan‚Äôs work is supported in part by funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Time Commitment: The workshop consists of two 3-hour sessions. Registration Closes November 9, 2023 #InMotionNetwork #EquityAndDiversity #SocialJustice #RelationshipBuilding #CommunicationSkills #EDItraining #AccessAndOpportunity #NonExiling #DignityForAll #SharedExperiences Image description: A blue background with, \"InMotion Network Presents: EDI: A Social Justice Marathon - presented by Nathan Viktor Fawaz\". The description states, \"Are you ready to embark on a journey toward equity, diversity, inclusion? Just like preparing for a marathon, it takes intentionality, stamina, and commitment. Join us for a two-part virtual workshop series where you will learn essential skills for engaging an ongoing social justice marathon on Thursday, November 16 9 AM to 12 PM mountain standard time and Thursday, November 30 9 AM to 12 PM mountain standard time.

I could hear the pitter-patter of thick, heavy, Scottish raindrops as I gathered my laptop and headed to my office; careful to dodge rogue deer enroute. Sooooo why the heck was I up and about so early, with only the dark highland sky twinkling above me? To deliver a workshop for The Community Collective, ofc! üéä The UK to Australia time difference isn't the most friendly in the world, and sometimes you've gotta do hard things (like deliver a workshop at 6am). Here's why I said yes: - Paz Pisarski is an AMAZING community builder and I ‚ù§Ô∏è collaborating with fellow women founders who are building impactful products - It's tricky to tap into ecosystems on the other side of the world. This was an awesome opportunity to expand my network and start planting solid roots in the Aus / NZ scene - Creating workshops always helps me get more clear in my own mind. Untangling concepts. Simplifying thinking. Creating frameworks. This workshop was no exception üå∂Ô∏è - Teaching is fun! You get to help share your knowledge and learnings, AND have fun photo momentos like this one üì∏ It was a blast, and the barrage of messages post-workshop saying how helpful / novel / clarifying it was makes the 5am start totally worth it. PS: permission to finish early today? Granted ‚úÖ PPS: any guess what my instructions were for the pic? üòÖ\n\n‚ÄúAttending the AONN+ MidYear Conference virtually would have been great, but I also knew I would love the opportunity to network with people in person. So, I decided to just submit the scholarship application and see what happened. I thought that the application would be complex but that wasn‚Äôt the case at all. I think I completed it in about 10 minutes. It was a really quick and easy process. At the conference, the most enjoyable part was connecting with navigators and administrators from other systems. I found that regardless of their educational background or professional position, we all talked the same language and shared the same challenges. It was a relief to know that other people are dealing with the same things, and I enjoyed being able to bounce ideas off others. Everyone at AONN+ was very welcoming. And honestly, once you get to the conference, you feel like family. You're instantly connected with the people who are attending, and you get a wealth of knowledge. The networking opportunities are endless. I met so many people and exchanged business cards the whole time. To anyone thinking about applying to come to an AONN+ conference on scholarship, I would say definitely go for it. It has been a great experience.‚Äù Brittany McArn, Financial Navigation Manager, FirstHealth of the Carolinas Scholarship applications for AONN+‚Äôs 2024 Annual Conference are now open!
