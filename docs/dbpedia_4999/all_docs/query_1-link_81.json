        "text": "Coming Soon \"March 2024\"\n\nThe Panacea brand are launching a brand new Country Station called Panacea Country\n\nLaunched in 2020, Panacea originally produced and provided syndicated shows for radio stations all over the world who were wanting a high quality Jazz Funk or Soul Radio Show for their stations. In December 2022 the production team decided to branch out to fill a big gap in the UK with the music they embraced. In early January 2023 Panacea Radio was born. Panacea Soul became the new name as the music genre widened to include specialist shows for Northern Soul, Motown, Reggae and a weekly Smooth Jazz Top 30 chart show.\n\nSo what makes Panacea Radio different? Panacea Radio has an excellent team of presenters who share a passion for the music we play. We play music 24/7 but with presenter dialogue and interaction. Panacea Radio is available on a number of platforms including Amazon Alexa (Ask Alexa to Load Panacea Radio) and our Panacea Radio App, Free to download from your app store. Panacea Soul plays Jazz Funk, Soul plus special shows for Northern Soul, Motown & Smooth Jazz.\n\nMany people ask â€œWhere did the name Panacea come from?\""
