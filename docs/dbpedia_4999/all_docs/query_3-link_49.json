Where possible these issues are rectified at each quinquennial review. The following document lists the current STATS 19 variables, issues with quality, their usage and possible solutions.\n\nSTATS 19 data quality issues\n\nSTATS 19 form design research project\n\nTransport Research Laboratory were commissioned by Transport Scotland to review the currently used versions of the STATS19 form by the legacy police forces in Scotland and produce a new form that incorporates recommendations for improvement that could be potentially rolled out nationally to help improve the quality of the personal injury road accident data collected in Scotland. The report was published on 14 May 2015.\n\nThe report details the methodology used, findings from a literature review and consultation with stakeholders as well as details about the design and testing of the proposed form. All consultation participants’ comments have been anonymised to protect confidentiality.\n\nRoad accident data collection – form design research project\n\nA copy of the 2015 Illustrative STATS19 form produced as part of this project is also available\n\n2015 Illustrative STATS19 form\n\nSafety Camera Data\n\nRoad traffic accident and causality data collected by Police Scotland via the Stats 19 form is further validated by partners in each safety camera partnership and then submitted to the Scottish Safety Camera Programme Office.\n\nSpeed data is collected either via fixed speed loops located in the road surface or by means of mobile speed monitoring equipment.\n\nOffender data is recorded on the safety camera partnership back office system. Aggregated figures are then submitted to the Scottish Safety Camera Programme Office via audited forms.\n\nScotStat is a network for users and providers of Scottish Official statistics. It aims to improve communication amongst those interested in particular statistics and facilitate the setting up of working groups on specific statistical issues. There are two Transport and Travel related ScotStat Committees:\n\nTransport and Travel Statistics Advisory Committee, and the\n\nLiaison Group on Road Accident Statistics\n\nBoth meet about once a year with members being consulted by e-mail, between meetings, where necessary e.g. for consultation, to follow up on discussion from meetings, to notify of changes to work strands.\n\nIf you are keen to find out more about work relating to Transport and Travel Statistics or any other facet of the work of the Scottish Government Statistics Group, you can register with ScotStat to receive updates.

It meets periodically to discuss such statistical matters.\n\nRemit\n\nBackground to the formation of the group\n\nThe notes in this section are based upon the points made in the first section of a paper entitled \"Need for Liaison and Current Issues\", which was prepared for the first meeting of the group, which was held on 27 June 1989. They have been updated several times since with the latest revision in May 2012.\n\nThe group was established because there was a need for general liaison on road accident statistics for Scotland, covering both the \"STATS19\" system and other statistical matters on road accidents. It was to meet periodically to discuss such statistical matters.\n\nThe group was set up to discuss any problems with the \"STATS19\" system. One particular aim was to ensure that the information for Scotland flows smoothly to the main databases - within The Scottish Government, the Transport Scotland Statistics branch's statistical database (covering all injury road accidents) and the Road Network Management and Maintenance Division's SERIS database (covering trunk road accidents); and the GB-wide injury road accidents database held by what is now the Department for Transport (DfT). The group could also consider aspects of police or local authority sources if that were required.\n\nIn addition to discussing the \"STATS19\" system, it was hoped that the group would comment on improving other sources of information on road accidents, and provide feedback on the statistics published by The Scottish Government / Transport Scotland in \"Reported Road Casualties Scotland\" and its Statistical Bulletins.\n\nObjectives of Group\n\nThe main objectives specified for the group are as follows:\n\nTo improve data quality\n\nTo liaise on current STATS19 system.\n\nTo examine any changes proposed by GB on STATS19 system.\n\nConsider any problems affecting the smooth updating of existing computer databases.\n\nReview use of current published statistics on road accidents in Scotland.\n\nConsider topical issues/problems with the data as they arise\n\nAs the Scottish Government statistician dealing with Road Accident statistics is also the statistician for transport statistics in Scotland, it was also stated that other transport statistics matters could be raised and discussed if there were sufficient general interest.\n\nThe group will report relevant issues to DfT and a representative from DfT will attend meetings. The group will also be represented on the Standing Committee for Road Accident Statistics (SCRAS).\n\nMembership\n\nFrom the Police Forces and Councils which send the data to Transport Scotland\n\nNB: if some/all of the computing work is done for one of these bodies by another organisation, it is expected that the body which is represented on LGRAS will keep the other organisation informed.\n\nInspector Brian Poole (Road Policing Management support)\n\nSergeant Stevie White (Police Scotland)\n\nMr Steven Sellars (Fife Council)\n\nBeverley Harkins (Fife Council)\n\nSally McKenzie (Police Scotland)\n\nEliana Clark (Police Scotland)\n\nTina MacLucas (Police Scotland)\n\nMark Hollinsworth (Police Scotland)\n\nMichael McDonald(Police Scotland, Dumfries & Galloway)\n\nFrom users of the data\n\nVacant (Senior Accident Investigation Officer, Falkirk Council)\n\nDavid Scott (Scottish Police Authority)\n\nMr Richard Gerring (Highland Council)\n\nMr Stuart Geddes (Stirling Council)\n\nCarlyn Fraser (Clackmannanshire Council)\n\nSandy Allan (RoSPA, also Secretary of SAPC)\n\nMr Paul Middleton (WDM)\n\nMichael McDonnell (Road Safety Scotland)\n\nMr David Connolly (SYSTRA)\n\nFrom Transport Scotland\n\nAndrew Paterson, Transport Statistician (Chair)\n\nTony Christie, Social Research\n\nJohn Galilee, Team Leader\n\nLinzi Pidgeon, Scottish Safety Camera Programme\n\nMr Andrew Knight, Transport Statistics branch (Secretary)\n\nStuart Wilson, Transport Scotland Trunk Roads Network Management\n\nAmy Wilson, Trunk Road Network Strategic Road Safety\n\nBertrand Deiss, Road Safety policy branch\n\nFrom other organisations\n\nCOSLA: represented by Vacant: who also represents SCOTS (see above)\n\nDepartment for Transport (observers):\n\nDelphine Robineau, Road Accident Statistician\n\nPaul Baden\n\nAdditional distribution of LGRAS papers and minutes\n\nTransport Scotland will send copies of the papers for, and the minutes of, LGRAS meetings to its full list of Road Accident Statistics contacts.\n\nMeetings\n\nMeeting documentation of the ScotStat Liaison Group on Road Accident Statistics including agenda, minutes and associated papers.\n\nLGRAS Agenda, minutes and papers, 15 March 2018\n\nPrevious meetings\n\nDate Agenda Minutes Papers 6 June 2016 Agenda Minutes\n\nTransport Scotland: Statistics team update LGRAS (16) 2\n\nRoad Safety Research Projects LGRAS (16) 3\n\nReviewing Timeliness of Road Casualty Statistical Reporting LGRAS (16) 4\n\nScottish Safety Camera Programme site selection LGRAS (16) 5\n\n18 May 2015 View View\n\nUpdate on action points from 2014 LGRAS (15) 2\n\nTransport Scotland: Statistics team update (15) 3\n\n16 May 2014 View View Update on action points from 2013 LGRAS (14)1\n\nStats 19 data quality issues – template LGRAS (14)2\n\nTransport Scotland update LGRAS (14)3\n\nTransport Scotland Road Safety Research Projects LGRAS (14)4\n\nStats19 Form design research project LGRAS (14)4 Update on action points from 2012 LGRAS (13) 01 10 May 2013 View View Transport Scotland developments over the last 12 months and upcoming work LGRAS (13) 02 Transport Scotland road safety research projects LGRAS (13) 03 10 June 2011 View View\n\nEstimating under-reporting of Road Casualties in Scotland LGRAS (11) 01\n\nTransport Scotland Road Safety Research Projects LGRAS (11) 02\n\n7 June 2010 View View\n\nAction Points\n\nUK Statistics Authority assessment of GB and Scottish STATS19 collection LGRAS (10) 01\n\nScottish Government Road Safety Research LGRAS (10) 02\n\n2008 Review of Reported Road Casualty Statistics (STATS 19) -

For some users this publication provides the main source of transport data and everything they require. For others with an interest in specific areas of transport it provides contextual information for their work e.g. historical trends, road lengths, vehicle registrations or data on other types of transport for comparison purposes. For example Police Scotland use car registrations and road length to put their own data into context.\n\nReported Road Casualties Scotland (RRCS) is the key source of data for those working in road safety. Data is used to inform road safety campaigns e.g. on speeding or drink driving. There are also regular casualty reduction targets which have been set by the Scottish Government that require to be monitored. It is also used by Police Scotland to check for problems in their areas and respond accordingly e.g. to focus on young drivers. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary use the data to identify questions for the forces. Costs data that is published is used to estimate the savings from preventing accidents due to policy intervention or road design e.g. by the police or by transport planners. The figures and data are also used by Transport Scotland's Accident Investigation and Prevention Unit.\n\nOther publications are produced in a web only format, including a .pdf file to enable users to print a document where required. Transport and Travel in Scotland (TATIS) and Key Reported Road Casualties provide advance headline figures from the main publications earlier in the year.\n\nBus & Coach statistics used to be published as a separate publication but has now been combined with Scottish Transport Statistics. The data is obtained from the Scottish Household Survey and the Department for Transport. It is used in Transport Scotland to inform policy, funding (including concessionary fares and the Bus Service Operators Grant) and local initiatives and is also used by operators, their representative organisations and Regional Transport Partnerships to promote and improve bus travel across Scotland e.g. looking at fare indices and passenger numbers / distance travelled.\n\nUp until recently there were two other publications which were based on survey data, looked at personal travel and provided more detail behind the figures published in STS. These were the SHS travel diary publication and Household Trends which published the results of the travel questions in the SHS.These have now been combined with TATIS.A National Travel Survey - Scotland Results publication which published the Scottish results from the National Travel Survey has now been discontinued as DfT no longer collect data for Scotland. The Scottish Household Survey data provides insight into travel behaviour which can then be used to assess the impact of interventions (policy or schemes) on particular demographic groups. This information is used by Transport Scotland, transport consultants and those working in particular sectors to look at actual and potential modal shift, for example moves to active travel. A review of the SHS was carried out in Summer 2010 and a summary of responses is published here.\n\nAccessing Transport Statistics\n\nThe range of users of transport statistics is broad and user needs vary. Consultation with users and discussion at user group meetings has identified a number of issues relating to the use of statistics, some of which are listed below:\n\nAccessibility (Publication / Data source vs Topic): Some users access transport statistics from particular publications, others have a focus on a particular topic e.g. road casualties. The structure of publications and the website attempts to cater for both routes into the figures. Changes have been made to publications in recent years to improve accessibility and reduce duplication. Positive feedback has been received from users on the progress made and further changes will be made in consultation with users.\n\nWeb vs Hard Copy publications: Many users are happy with a web publication, others prefer a hard copy. For the two larger publications, STS and RRCS, a hard copy is produced. For all publications a .pdf is provided on the website to enable users to print a copy if required. The size of this file is kept as small as possible to enable users with slower internet connections to access the file.\n\nCurrency of data: Some users have identified issues around time lags between period end and availability of data. Whether using administrative or survey data, there is a necessary time lag between the period end, the receipt of data and the completion of quality checking. We seek to minimise this time whilst maintaining a balance with data quality in order to meet user needs. The publication timetable is consulted on regularly and changes have been made in recent years to improve data availability e.g. through the publication of headline figures earlier in the year with the detail following later and from 2011 onwards the publication of Reported Road Casualties was brought forward from November to October at the request of users. The move to web publications will also enable more frequent and / or faster updates to data series.\n\nCommentary vs data: Some users require commentary and explanation of trends, patterns etc. Other users are familiar with the data and are less interested in the commentary. Publications attempt to strike a balance and the move to web publications should require fewer resources and enable more analysis of the data to be carried out. For example RRCS 2009 includes an article comparing the statistics published with numbers from other similar data sources.\n\nOther issues are identified in minutes of user group meetings (see below).\n\nEngaging with Users\n\nTransport statistics have 2 main user groups, (Transport & Travel Statistics Advisory Committee (TTSAC) and Liaison Group on Road Accident Statistics (LGRAS), which meet on an annual basis. The memberships were originally derived from the ScotStat register but have evolved over time. The remit, membership, papers and minutes from previous meetings can be found on our website.\n\nThe minutes reflect discussions on the publication format, content and timing of publications.\n\nIn addition to the annual meetings, users are regularly contacted by email to inform them of publications dates and consult on statistical plans and any relevant issues.\n\nOther engagement\n\nTransport Statistics also engages with users and providers of its statistics in other ways - for example:\n\nMeetings with some of the main individual suppliers and users of the data\n\nEvents like the annual Scottish seminar organised jointly by the Transport Statistics Users' Group and Napier University Transport Research Institute, and the Scottish Household Survey User Day\n\nConsultative e-mails sent to the ScotStat Transport and/or the TRi/TSUG e-mail lists\n\nOccasional surveys of users of its outputs, through questionnaires included in the publications and made available on the website.\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results - All editions\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results 2011/2012 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished March 2014\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results 2009/2010 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished March 2012\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results 2007/2008 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished April 2010\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results 2004/2005 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished January 2007\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results 2002/2003 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished April 2005\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results 1998/2000 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished April 2002\n\nNational Travel Survey: Scottish Results 1995/1997 Publication\n\nPublished March 1999\n\nScottish Household Survey: Travel Diary Results - All editions\n\nScottish Household Survey: Travel Diary 2012 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished November 2013\n\nScottish Household Survey: Travel Diary 2011 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished November 2012\n\nScottish Household Survey: Travel Diary Results 2009/10 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished November 2011\n\nScottish Household Survey: Travel Diary Results 2009 Publication; Datasets\n\nPublished November 2010\n\nScottish Household Survey: Travel Diary Results 2007/2008 Publication; Datasets\n\nNote figures in the Travel Diary bulletin do not exactly match the bulletin as figures were revised slightly post-publication.
