        "text": "Next month Heart Scotland and Capital Scotland are introducing new schedules with new voices live from Scotland seven days a week.\n\nThe move is part of a major investment in Scotland, with an expansion of Global’s broadcast centre in Glasgow including a new creative hub that will produce live radio, visualised content and podcasts for Global Player, as well as housing Global’s Scotland Tech Hub.\n\nOn Heart Scotland there will be a new breakfast show hosted by Des Clarke and Jennifer Reoch, weekday mornings, 6.30am to 10am. The move sees Des Clarke return to breakfast radio in Scotland, having most recently been on Heart Drive. He previously hosted Breakfast for 13 years on Capital, Galaxy and Beat 106.\n\nCapital Scotland’s new breakfast show will be hosted by Fat Brestovci and Tallia Storm, 6am to 10am. This is singer and social media star, Tallia Storm’s first radio presenting gig as she joins broadcaster Fat to host the show.\n\nIn addition to the breakfast show there is a fresh new schedule across the whole day for Heart Scotland which also sees broadcaster Amy Irons joining to present a new mid-morning programme, live from Glasgow 10am to 1pm. Cat Cubie also joins to present a new afternoon show.\n\nThe new Heart Scotland Drive programme, 4pm to 7pm will be presented by David Farrell, who joins from BBC Scotland. At the weekend, Grace Nicoll will present a new afternoon show 12 noon to 4pm.\n\nCapital Scotland’s new schedule also includes Robyn Richford joining to host mid-mornings 10am to 1pm, Ryan Borthwick presents the new afternoon show 1pm to 4pm and Katy J remains on Drive, 4pm to 7pm. At the weekend, Jonny Campbell will host 9am to 12 noon.\n\nAshley Tabor-King OBE, Founder & Executive President of Global, said: “I’m delighted that we are bringing listeners more choice with shows coming live from Glasgow, hosted by a combination of our much-loved presenters and exciting new talent.\n\n“What’s more, the broadcast centre will be significantly upgraded to become a creative hub in Scotland, with fully visualised studios and a production centre for creating podcast, social and digital content.”\n\nJames Rea, Director of Broadcasting & Content at Global, said: “This is an amazing team of presenters with brilliant personalities and these changes will make what we do even more relevant to the lives of audiences in Scotland. It’s great to see Des Clarke return to breakfast radio alongside Jennifer Reoch on Heart and I’m certain Fat and Tallia Storm will bring great energy to the Capital team.”\n\nCapital Scotland is owned and operated under a brand licence by Communicorp UK. Mark Lee, Communicorp UK’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “Our new Scottish talent will bring new and exciting content within an already fantastic station. Combined with the best hit music from the Capital brand, our place as the Official Radio Partner of the OVO Hydro, and our existing relationships within live music, it will further cement our position as Scotland’s Number 1 Hit Music Station.”"
