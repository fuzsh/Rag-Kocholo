        "text": "Published: 28 November 2023\n\nFestive partygoers are being urged to plan their journeys home in advance to ensure the perfect end to an amazing night out.\n\nCouncil officers in high-vis jackets will be on hand to offer advice and support to anyone who has become separated from friends, has lost their mobile phones or need directions. They'll be supporting officers from Police Scotland who will be on the look-out for any alcohol fuelled crime and antisocial behaviour.\n\nAnd the city's famous Street Pastors will also be on patrol to help anyone in need. A Safe Zone has also been set up at the Tron Church in Nelson Mandela Square where anyone vulnerable due to excessive alcohol consumption will be taken by the team and minor injuries can be treated.\n\nHome Safe Marshals will also manage taxi queues at Nitezones in Gordon Street, Sauchiehall Street, George Square, Byres Road and Shawlands Cross.\n\nAll the partners will be in contact with each other via radio links and will also be in touch with the City Operations Centre at Eastgate.\n\nAs the festive fun ramps up, the safety team has issued a few tips to help people ensure their nights out are memorable for all the right reasons.\n\nLise Fisher of Glasgow City Council which runs Best Bar None Glasgow said: \"The city's amazing pubs, clubs and restaurants will be exceptionally busy, the closer we get to Christmas.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to flock to Glasgow from across Scotland to celebrate in style in coming weeks and we want to ensure everyone has a brilliant time before heading home safely.\n\n\"Sometimes the excitement of arranging your night out can overshadow more mundane preparations like planning the journey home. But when it's lashing with rain and you've missed the last train, you'll wish you'd planned ahead!\"\n\nTips include:-\n\n• Ensure your mobile phone is fully charged before heading out\n\n• Choose a rendezvous point with friends in case you get separated\n\n• Arrange your transport home in advance by pre-booking a taxi, checking the time of the last train or bus home or locating the nearest Nitezone to your chosen venue.\n\n• Pace your alcohol consumption and keep money in reserve to pay for your journey home\n\n• Check out the city's Best Bar None venues where staff are trained to safeguard vulnerable people. Best Bar None Glasgow\n\nCommunity Inspector Jonathan Watters of Police Scotland said : \"With Christmas approaching the city centre is becoming busier. Together with the city council, we are working to keep people safe and build stronger foundations for our communities which help deliver the shared outcomes of Glasgow City Council and Police Scotland.\n\n\"We are working closely with all partners to ensure shoppers and revellers enjoy a safe visit to Glasgow City Centre.\n\n\"The party season is a great time but it's important to drink responsibly.\n\n\"We will be carrying out visits to licensed premises to reduce crime and will take appropriate action against alcohol related violence and anti-social behaviour.\n\n\"We aim to ensure everyone has a very happy and safe Christmas and New Year.\""
