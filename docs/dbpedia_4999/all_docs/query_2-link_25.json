        "text": "ScotRail has warned travellers ahead of a \"busy weekend\" as Rangers is set to face Motherwell.\n\nThe travel company reminded customers that a temporary timetable is currently in place.\n\nThis is \"due to fewer drivers making themselves available for rest day working, as is their contractual right, while pay talks are ongoing with the trade union ASLEF\".\n\nDespite this, ScotRail said it will run as many carriages as possible.\n\nOn Saturday, Rangers will play Motherwell at Hampden Park, kicking off at 3pm.\n\nMore seats will be added to trains to and from Mount Florida but fans using those services should expect queuing times to be longer, allow extra time for travel, and are advised to make their way to the station after the match to travel back to the city.\n\nREAD NEXT: Glasgow train line to be closed for one day - see affected stations\n\nThose going to the Edinburgh Festivals also were asked to expect crowds and plan ahead.\n\nAs with last week, Sunday’s timetable will also be significantly reduced and customers are advised to check the ScotRail app or website to get the latest information. This will be updated by Friday, August 9.\n\nPhil Campbell, ScotRail Customer Operations Director, said: “This is another busy weekend for travel across Scotland’s Railway and we are doing everything we can to help customers get to the football match at Hampden and the events in Edinburgh.\n\n“Customers are reminded that with the temporary timetable currently in place, there are fewer services than normal in operation. But to support both the football at the national stadium and the Edinburgh Festivals, we’ve made changes to our services, including extra seats and services and late-night trains to get people to and from Edinburgh.\n\n“With trains expected to be busier than usual, we’re encouraging everyone to allow extra time for travel and check their journey in advance via our online journey planner.\n\n“Buying return tickets before you board using our mTicket system on our mobile app will help your journey run smoothly.”"
