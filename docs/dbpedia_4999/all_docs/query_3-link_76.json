        "text": "The Glasgow Psychological Trauma Service (GTPS) accepts referrals from GPs, Mental Health Teams, Social Workers, Community Addiction Teams and Third Sector Organisations. Please use the referral form to refer to our service.\n\nAt the GTPS we consider the difficulties and needs a person is presenting with currently and the impact of their experiences, rather than the extent of trauma experiences that the person has been subjected to in the past, when we are making decisions about whose needs match our service. Please be aware of this when filling in the referral form; we will prioritise information on current symptoms, clinical needs and the impact that this has on the person’s functioning, rather than an extensive description of the trauma the person has experienced.\n\nPlease note our service is currently delivering our clinical services on a ‘digital first’ basis, delivering digitally/remotely as well as face to face, where clinically indicated. Please include the client’s preference in the referral form and whether they have digital access.\n\nIf you would like to refer someone to the service, or are considering doing so, we would encourage you to telephone us to discuss this before completing the referral form. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays there is a staff member available for consultation. Please note, we do not accept self-referrals. Should you wish to be referred to the service please discuss this with your GP or other services you are involved with.\n\nFollowing Referral\n\nFollowing referral, there will be a team discussion to ensure the client’s current needs meet our service criteria and that it appears the right time for the client to engage in assessment and potential intervention. If, from the information available in the referral form, a person’s need does not appear to meet criteria for our service the referral will not be accepted. If we feel another mental health service might be more appropriate, we will liaise with them in the first instance, to provide more seamless access to the appropriate service.\n\nIf the referral is accepted by GPTS, the referrer and GP will be notified and the person will be placed on our assessment waiting list. When they reach the top of the assessment waiting list, the client will then be invited for assessment which will take place over one or more sessions. This can take place via video call or telephone appointments. We can also offer face to face appointments if required. Please note that unfortunately we currently have long waits for assessments due to the impact of Covid-19 on the service and staffing capacity.\n\nIf we decide that the client is suitable for our service, a treatment plan will be agreed with the client and information provided on what the client can expect from our service. We make every effort to see people as quickly as possible but please note that there are unfortunately currently long waiting times before starting treatment.\n\nIf following assessment it is indicated that GPTS is not the most appropriate service for someone, the reasons for this will be explained and advice about other options given. It may be that another service will be more suitable, or that it is simply not the best time for the individual to be starting trauma focused psychological therapy. If another service seems more appropriate for the individual’s needs, then we will make a referral to that service if possible or request that the appropriate person does with a summary of our assessment and recommendations.\n\nIf someone you have referred requires immediate support with their mental health while on the assessment waitlist we would recommend you contact their GP and/or local CMHT.\n\nTrauma can be described as “resulting from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual’s functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being” (SAMHSA, 2014).\n\nA trauma can be an event or experience that is deeply distressing to someone. Often this can affect the way someone thinks, feels and behaves. It can also cause bodily reactions such as insomnia and tension. In many cases, traumatic events can impact on relationships with others.\n\nExamples of traumatic events are below:\n\nDeath\n\nRoad traffic accident\n\nFire\n\nRape\n\nSexual assault\n\nPhysical assault\n\nLoss\n\nWitnessing a traumatic event\n\nNatural disaster\n\nThe types of trauma listed above are single, discrete events that can occur suddenly and without warning. If it is a single, one-off, unexpected event, it is called a Type 1 trauma.\n\nSome types of trauma can occur on multiple occasions and over a longer period of time. The person may anticipate what is going to happen but be unable to do anything about it, and so this ongoing anticipation of threat can have an impact on how they perceive themselves, others, and the world. If the trauma happens on multiple occasions, it is called Type 2 trauma, or complex trauma. Many Type 2 traumas can be interpersonal in nature.\n\nBelow are some examples of Type 2 trauma:\n\nDomestic abuse, including coercive control\n\nChildhood abuse (sexual, physical, emotional, neglect)\n\nTorture\n\nComplex trauma, another term for Type 2 traumas, can be defined as long-term, interpersonal abuse, occurring on multiple occasions and often beginning early in life (Herman, 1997).\n\nComplex trauma often produces feelings of fear, sadness and despair that can be difficult to manage and control. Often these feelings start suddenly and can become very powerful and often feel overwhelming. Therefore the brain tries to find ways to manage these feelings in the context of ongoing abuse and then when trying to process these experiences. This can result in behaviours or coping strategies that may feel like the only option the individual has at the time, and perhaps even helpful in the short term, but if using these long-term or all the time it becomes less useful and can lead to other difficulties. There are a wide range of behaviour or coping strategies someone may use as a result of experience complex traumatic events, for example using substances problematically, self-harm, dissociation, self-isolation.\n\nOur early experiences of care can often affect how we feel about ourselves and impact on the relationships we form with other people. People who experience abuse in what is meant to be a caring relationship can often feel that it is their fault and think badly about themselves. They may also believe that all relationships will be similar and accept this or believe that it is better to be alone. Some people report that experiencing one traumatic event after another can make them feel powerless and helpless and there is no point trying to get help because there is nothing they can do. Complex trauma can also affect people physically. This is because traumatic events normally trigger biological reactions within our bodies. Symptoms may include insomnia, concentration difficulties, muscular aches and pain, tiredness, palpitations, headaches and stomach problems. In some cases people may be diagnosed with physical difficulties, such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, fibromyalgia, migraines or pain\n\nIn the period following a traumatic event, it is normal to experience some symptoms of PTSD. The brain tries the ways it knows how to respond to and cope with a traumatic and overwhelming event or events, and so many of the symptoms a person can experience are normal reactions to abnormal events. For the majority of people, these resolve over time. However, some people’s symptom may endure and start to cause significant difficulties in their everyday life.\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nSome people develop PTSD after a traumatic experience. Some of the symptoms include the person having dreams or unwanted pictures or images of the trauma coming into their mind, or the person may find they cannot remember the traumatic event(s). They may feel like the trauma is happening again and experience the same sensations and distress as they did the first time. They may find that they try to avoid all things that are related to the trauma. This may include not talking about the trauma or avoiding people or places that remind them of the trauma. Other symptoms include jumpiness, feeling irritable and difficulties sleeping. Many people also experience mood difficulties such as anxiety, depression or anger.\n\nComplex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD)\n\nCPTSD is more likely to develop after repeated experiences of trauma or if trauma happened early in life, because of the psychological impact of these trauma experiences.\n\nA person with CPTSD has the symptoms of PTSD, alongside the following difficulties, which can cause a significant impact on their functioning day to day:\n\nFinding it hard to understand or manage emotions which can be overwhelming and frightening at times;\n\nFinding relationships difficult to manage and feeling that other people can be difficult, hurtful or dangerous; and\n\nFeeling bad about themselves, often feeling ashamed or to blame for what has happened.\n\nTraumatic events may produce feelings of fear, loss, abandonment and isolation. These feelings can affect mood. Because trauma is often associated with danger and vulnerability, some people may experience symptoms of anxiety (e.g. shakiness, trembling, tension, palpitations, and dizziness).\n\nPeople may also experience dissociation. Dissociation is a wide ranging experience, and may include feeling numb and disconnected from yourself and/or the world, or being unaware of time passing or lacking memories from events you know have happened.\n\nCPTSD is more likely to develop after repeated experiences of trauma or if trauma happened early in life, because of the psychological impact of these trauma experiences.\n\nCPTSD is now recognised as a mental health problem in the ICD-11 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (11th Revision). (WHO, 2018).\n\nWe offer a range of different assessment and treatment options for CPTSD. Treatment recommendations will be offered based on expert clinician assessment. Treatment can be offered individually or in groups or using a combination of these. Service user preferences and needs are taken into account when planning treatment.\n\nBefore treatment at GPTS commences you will be asked to consider this consent form.\n\nOur service utilises a phase based approach to working with individuals who have are experiencing CPTSD, as recommended by both Cloitre et al (2002) and the NHS Education for Scotland Psychological Therapies ‘Matrix’ guidance, which provide recommendations regarding delivery of psychological therapy in Scotland. This model recommends that, in the first phase, treatment aims to create a sense of safety, security and emotional stability by improving sleep, emotional regulation, mood and understanding about the impact of trauma through psycho-educational materials. This phase is often called “safety and stabilisation”. Phase two of treatment, also called “reprocessing” involves talking in detail about the individual’s traumatic experiences. This helps to reduce re-experiencing symptoms such as nightmares and flashbacks and also improves a person’s mood. Phase two may also be referred to as “remembering and mourning”, and can also include a focus on recognising loss and learning from early experiences, as well as understanding and making meaning from those experiences. Phase two may also consider a person’s identity and how the traumatic experiences have impacted this. Phase three of treatment focuses on the person reclaiming their life, reconnecting with valued activities and their community, and looking forward to a life less dominated by trauma.\n\nTreatment plans are idiosyncratic and collaborative so it may be that people only need some not all of these aspects of work. For some people, the first phase of treatment may be sufficient to meet their needs, or may be all they are ready or able to do. Other people may not require a phase-based approach and can proceed quickly to processing trauma memories. The treatment plan is tailored to an individual’s needs.\n\nSafety and stabilisation can be delivered individually or in a group.\n\nTreatments offered will vary according to the recommendations of clinical assessment, but they may include:\n\nTrauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT)\n\nTF-CBT uses cognitive-behavioural techniques that have been shown to help individuals overcome trauma-related difficulties. It is designed to reduce negative emotional and behavioural responses following trauma. The therapy addresses upsetting beliefs and attributions related to traumas people have experienced and provides a safe environment in which people can talk about their traumatic experiences and learn skills to cope with life stressors.\n\nEye Movement Desensitisation Therapy (EMDR)\n\nEMDR is a psychotherapy that helps people process and recover from past experiences that are affecting their mental health. It involves bilateral stimulation using eye movements or tapping etc with talk therapy in a specific and structured format. This supports people to process difficult memories while keeping themselves in the present moment. EMDR helps people process negative images, emotions, beliefs and body sensations associated with traumatic memories that seem to be stuck. EMDR helps people to see things from a different perspective and relieves symptoms. There is still a requirement within EMDR to talk about the trauma the person has experienced.\n\nNarrative Exposure Therapist (NET)\n\nIn NET, with guiding and directive help of the therapist, the person will be asked to talk about the trauma in the context of their whole life story in detail while re-experiencing the emotions, cognitions, bodily, behavioural, and sensory elements associated with traumatic events. As well, the person will talk about positive life experiences. This process allows people to ease the difficult emotional response they experience when remembering the traumatic events and to change the meaning traumatic events have, which in turn leads a reduction in PTSD symptoms.\n\nSchema Therapy\n\nSchema Therapy targets schemas; a term used clinically to describe unhelpful patterns of thinking and behaviour that interfere with having an individual’s needs met and impact on their ability to maintain relationships, and can negatively affect emotional well-being. The aim of Schema Therapy is to help people to recognise behaviour patterns they would like to change, understand the underlying cause of this behaviour, and change their thoughts and behaviours so they are better able to cope with relationship challenges or emotions in healthy, productive ways. It can also help people to process traumatic events, and heal the impact of needs that were unmet in their childhood.\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)\n\nACT is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy that creatively uses values and mindfulness skills to help reduce psychological suffering and to build a meaningful life. This happens through: learning new psychological skills to reduce the impact of difficult emotions and cognitions so they no longer push people around, hold them back or get in the way of their life goals; clarifying the person’s values (how they want to treat themselves, others and the world around them) and use these to guide their actions and enhance their life; and focus attention on what is important to be able to fully engage in whatever activity they chose to do.\n\nCompassion Focused Therapy (CFT)\n\nCFT aims to help promote mental and emotional healing by encouraging the person to be compassionate towards themselves and other people. CFT was developed to combat high levels of shame and self-criticism that often comes hand-in-hand with mental health difficulties. Compassion, both toward the self and toward others, is an emotional response believed to be an essential aspect of wellbeing.\n\nArt Psychotherapy\n\nArt Psychotherapy is a psychological intervention which facilitates expression through art within a safe and containing relationship with an Art Psychotherapist.\n\nArt Psychotherapy provides a different way for people to communicate, understand and work with their trauma –related difficulties. Using art materials can offer a way to express thoughts, feelings and to help the person think about past experiences which have been difficult to speak of in words alone. Together the person and the Art Psychotherapist will begin to understand and process emotions stemming from trauma.\n\nPeople do not need to be good at art to do art psychotherapy. Making artwork can help people to become more aware of their thoughts and feelings. The process of creating art in therapy can allow a person to work through the trauma with the therapist.\n\nOccupational Therapy\n\nOccupational Therapy provides practical support to empower people to recover and overcome barriers preventing them from doing activities that matter to them. Using activity, Occupational Therapy can help achieve peoples’ goals and where possible improve their mental wellbeing and increase confidence. This work can be done individually or in group settings. Occupational Therapists work in partnership with the person to support recovery and improve their quality of life. In partnership with the Forestry Commission, The Anchor’s Occupational Therapist runs the Branching Out group.\n\nBranching Out aims to provide opportunities to experience relaxation with a reduction in symptoms intensity and levels of distress; opportunities to experience pleasure and enjoyment in nature based activities; opportunities to develop an enhanced sense of self, an increase in self-confidence and self-esteem; opportunities to reconnect with previously valued activities and roles; opportunities to experience increased interpersonal and social competencies as a result of involvement in an activity based group.\n\nSafety and Stabilisation groups\n\nThe GPTS currently offers Safety and Stabilisation groups. The most commonly run group is called Safe Place to Cope (SPTC).\n\nSafe Place to Cope (SPTC)\n\nThe SPTC group aims to promote skills to enable those seeking asylum and victims of trafficking to manage distress and regulate emotions following cumulative trauma. Although it is provided in a group format, there is no requirement for people to disclose anything about their own experience of trauma. Attendees are supported to develop resources and problems solving skills in mastering distress linked to trauma they have experienced, as well as support resilience and develop a sense of connectedness with their community.\n\nSurvive & Thrive Group\n\nSurvive & Thrive is a group-based educational course which provides a ‘Phase one’ treatment for people who have experienced complex trauma and have mental health needs arising from this. In the group, people learn about the common responses to the experience of complex trauma, and ways to manage common symptoms. Although it is provided in a group format, there is no requirement for people to disclose anything about their own experience of trauma. It has been developed by the NHS in Scotland and is widely available across most NHS boards in Scotland. The GTPS can provide access to this phase 1 psychoeducational group following assessment, through NHSGGC Glasgow Psychological Therapies Groups Service.\n\nAccordion title 1\n\nThis is a placeholder tab content.

It is important to have the necessary information in the block, but at this stage, it is just a placeholder to help you visualise how the content is displayed. Feel free to edit this with your actual content.\n\nIt’s usually helpful to reach out to people you trust, tell them how you are feeling/ask for advice. If this does not feel right for you right now we recommend that you make an appointment with your GP to discuss what’s going on for you. There are also a number of other services you can contact by telephone or email/online that can be helpful and are listed below.\n\nSome people find Breathing Space helpful. This is a confidential telephone line where you can talk to someone about the things you are finding difficult. The telephone number for Breathing Space is 0800 83 85 87. They are open all weekend and during weekdays from 6.00pm to 2.00am.\n\nThe BSL interpretation service is available during the Breathing Space phoneline opening hours of:\n\nMonday to Friday: 6.00pm to midnight\n\nSaturday and Sunday: 8.00am to midnight\n\nIf English isn’t your ﬁrst or preferred language you can still phone Breathing Space.\n\nBreathing Space uses the interpretation service, Language Line, to support callers who cannot, or prefer not to, speak English.\n\nLanguage Line is private, confidential and free to use.\n\nTo use Language Line\n\nPhone Breathing Space on 0800 83 85 87\n\nTell the advisor that you need an interpreter\n\nTell the advisor the name of your preferred language\n\nOnce you’re connected to an interpreter you’ll have a three way conversation with Breathing Space.\n\nLanguage Line is available during the Breathing Space phone line opening hours of:\n\nMonday to Friday: 6.00pm to midnight\n\nSaturday and Sunday: 8.00am to midnight\n\nOther people prefer to use The Samaritans, though interpreters are not available. Please note, this is not an NHS service. You can call them at anytime on 116 123. You can also email The Samaritans though they may take up to 24 hours to reply to emails. Their email address is: jo@samaritans.org\n\nThe government website Clear Your Head has helpful tips for looking after yourself when you feel stressed.\n\nIf you need support with your mental health while you are on our assessment or treatment waiting list you can seek support from the service that referred you or your local CMHT via your GP. If you are on our treatment waitlist or in treatment and struggling, you can call or email and ask to speak to our duty worker who will be happy to support you. Please note the duty service is only available Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 9am and 5pm.\n\nIf you need to speak to someone more urgently you can call 111. You can also access an interpreter on 111.\n\nStrategies\n\nBelow is a summary of some strategies you can use to help manage your symptoms of CPTSD, particularly when you notice that your mind is going back to difficult memories or if you are becoming worried about the future. These are called ‘grounding strategies’ and they allow you to feel calmer by helping your mind to connect to the present moment, by focusing on something around you, using one or all of your senses. Using your senses is a good way to remind your mind, how now is different from the past, and can create some distance between you and overwhelming feelings. It can also help you focus on what you can do in this moment to make yourself feel better and so provide a sense of control.\n\nThings to Smell – aromatherapy oils / perfumes / smelling salts / Vicks\n\nTry to keep oil on tissue under pillow or in a pocket and use it when you have the sensation of memory coming or after waking from a nightmare. It is important that the smell is not associated with any traumatic or upsetting memories.\n\n(Smelling salts are particularly good when a person has such a severe flashback that they do not respond to others calling them. They do not smell pleasant, but are preferable to leaving a person in a flashback).\n\nThings to See – look around and really pay attention to the details – describe what you see (how many different colours can you see? Which patterns can you see? Describe a photograph or picture to yourself out loud)\n\nThings to Hear – listen to noises around you (how many different noises can you hear?) or listen to the radio or TV. Play some comforting music.\n\nThings to Touch – soft toys, pebbles, pinecones, stress balls, a soft blanket, cuddle your pet, splash water over your hands or face. . Notice the texture, temperature, shape and patterns. It can be helpful to carry a small object with you, like a pebble, to use when you need.\n\nThings to Taste – drink of water, some strong tasting food – only after some grounding has already taken place\n\nThings to Distract You. Afterwards engage in some enjoyable or comforting activities to help to keep you in the present moment and to change your focus and mood – e.g. talking with somebody supportive, talking about the present and things you are interested in and enjoy (e.g. football, friends, and activities in your daily life now)\n\nLooking after our physical health\n\nOur physical and mental health are closely related to each other. The basic building blocks of health: sleep, a balanced diet, and gentle exercise are very important when recovering from traumatic events. Healthy routines can be particularly difficult to manage when experiencing post-traumatic stress, for instance nightmares may disrupt sleep, and poor sleep may make eating well and exercising feel more difficult. If we are sleeping badly, eating poorly, and staying inactive, it can mean we have much less energy and focus for doing the things that might help our recovery from trauma. Attending appointments, practising new coping skills, studying or work, or navigating complex legal proceedings all benefit from getting these building blocks of health as strong as they can be. We can take small steps to improve our mental well-being.\n\nHere are some links to resources that may help you get ideas of where to start:\n\nIf you would like to explore more helpful strategies and practices like these, and understand why they are helpful then please see the section “Resources for coping with the impact of trauma”."
