        "text": "Listen up beauty buffs! The TikTok viral Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum has been discounted in the Look Fantastic sale.\n\nHydrating and plumping, Skin Tok girls say it gives them \"the prettiest glow.\" Usually as much as £45 on sites like Space NK, or £38.31 in the Sephora sale, the B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum is now the cheapest we can find at Look Fantastic, coming in at just £32.25.\n\nThe popular Drunk Elephant product is packed with ingredients like pro-vitamin B5 and pineapple ceramides that work to deliver continuous hydrating and plumping benefits. What's more, a unique complex of watermelon rind, apple and lentil helps to smooth the look of fine lines, so it acts as an anti-ageing serum too.\n\nDrunk Elephant’s B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum drenches skin in a thirst-quenching cocktail of hydrators, summoning a plump and dewy finish. It promises to offer benefits all day - because this skin care technology works to lock in moisture, perfect for dry skin.\n\nYou can apply the Intensive Hydration Serum to your face, neck, chest, or hands - any place that's needing increased hydration. Not just for dry skin girlies, this serum is ideal for anyone thanks to its pH of 5.7 - which matches the skins naturally weak acidity.\n\nTikTok's Amanda Rennick described the serum as \"like drinking water on a hot summer's day\", adding that it's \"super lightweight, hydrating and so illuminating.\"\n\nWith a 4.63 out of five star review on Look Fantastic, it's no surprise that the Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum is so popular in the skincare world. This reviewer said: \"Amazing! Skin feels really soft and hydrated after using this! Highly recommended!!\"\n\nWhile another delighted user added: \"Everything about this product is sooooo good!!! hydrates my skin (i can get really bad dry skin) and has sorted it.. works wonders, tad pricey but 1000 per cent worth it.\"\n\nThis shopper said: \"Must be onto my 7th bottle of this. Great all round moisturising serum. And perfect for DE smoothies.\"\n\n\"Smoothies\" is a term that beauty buffs use to describe mixing multiple products that compliment each other. Since pro-vitamin B5 is well known to complement vitamin C, Drunk Elephant recommend mixing the Hydration Serum with the C-Firma Fresh Day Serum, priced at £70.\n\nThis Drunk Elephant shopper said: \"I can see why it’s trending on Tiktok, really hydrating.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"I love that this serum combines sodium hyaluronate with other hydrating ingredients. It goes on beautifully and you can feel how hydrated it makes your skin straight away. Also sits well under makeup.\"\n\nWhile most of the B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum reviews were glowing, one customer wasn't too impressed, writing: \"Lovely hydrating formula however I think there are other hydrating serums on the market that do the same for a lot less.\"\n\nIf you're searching for a product that's not as pricey, the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Face Moisturizer is reported to be a pretty good 'dupe' for the Drunk Elephant Hydration Serum. It's just £24 at Boots.\n\nElsewhere, the BYOMA Hydrating Serum is just £12.90 on Amazon. Alternatively, the e.l.f. SKIN Holy Hydration! Triple Bounce Serum costs £11.99 at Superdrug.\n\nDon't miss out on the coveted Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum while it's reduced by a massive 25 per cent. You won't find it cheaper than at Look Fantastic - so head there now."
