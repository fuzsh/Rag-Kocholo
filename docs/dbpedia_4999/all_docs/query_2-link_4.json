        "text": "Glasgow band Twin Atlantic have paid tribute to their roots and the city that prepared them for worldwide success.\n\nFrom playing their first gig at Glasgow's Bloc+ to the \"spiritual experience\" of playing at the Barrowlands, lead singer Sam McTrusty says being from Glasgow gave the group the \"edge\" they needed.\n\n\"If you can work in a bar on Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow, you can get up on stage and deal with hecklers.\" he said.\n\nNow, the group are preparing to enter a new phase of their career following the departure of drummer Craig Kneale and the upcoming release of their new album, Meltdown.\n\n\"We were, from day one, hyper aware that nothing's going to get handed to us.\"\n\n\"We are the underdogs, we need to work twice or three times as hard as other bands down south.\"\n\nSam used his experience of working in bars across the city to prepare the group for gigs in the early days.\n\nThe band played their first gig, a \"dummy run\" at Bloc+ where Sam worked ahead of a show at the Buff Club.\n\nWhen success came calling and the band were signed by an American record label, McTrusty stayed true to his roots, singing in his now trademark Glaswegian accent.\n\n\"The accent thing, it's always been like 50/50,\" he said.\n\n\"Like anybody else growing up, I used to sing with the kind of faux American accent.\n\n\"When I started writing my own songs, I felt really embarrassed doing that accent.\n\n\"But then, when we started getting played on the radio or getting some record sales, they tried to convince me to like tame it to be more mainstream.\"\n\nThe decision paid off though with the band going on to support Biffy Clyro, Blink 182 and My Chemical Romance.\n\nThe trio went on to see recognition when their 2014 single 'Heart and Soul' was premiered by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 as the hottest record in the world.\n\nThe band continue to feature as a mainstay of the Scottish music festival scene, playing this summer at the Belladrum festival's 20th anniversary.\n\nDespite now living in Canada with his wife and two daughters, Sam, 36, speaks fondly of the Glasgow venues that played a part in the bands formative years.\n\nRecalling the band's first experience playing at Glasgow's Barrowlands, Sam said it felt like a \"weird spiritual experience\".\n\n\"The Barrowlands is just so difficult to separate from being the best one for us, because it's where we've played the most.\" he said\n\n\"My grandparents, who are turning 90 this year, used to go there on nights out. So when you're in there, and your family's all born and raised here, itâs not like you're playing a gig.\n\nPerforming in what he calls the \"heartbeat of the city\" Barrowlands, Sam said he couldn't stop \"hyperventilating\" and crying.\n\n\"It pure caught me off guard just because of the weight of all we'd achieved.\"\n\n\"I think we've headlined it like sort of ten times or over, definitely double figures anyway so thatâs really special to us.\"\n\nThe band continue to pay tribute to the city in their music, from the naming of their 2016 album GLA to featuring Glasgow fans and venues in the music video for 2015's 'Fall into the Party'.\n\nReviving some of their best memories from around the city, the band have partnered with Ticketmaster to create a short film, \"The Sound of... Glasgow\", external, about the move from Glasgow's grassroots venues to the forefront of the Scottish music scene."
