The Callanish Stones, dating from about 2900 BC, are the finest example of a stone circle in Scotland 3. The Butt of Lewis has been recorded as being the UK’s windiest spot 4. The Outer Hebrides is home to more than 7,500 fresh water lochs, which is almost a quarter of all the lochs in Scotland 5. The waters around Lewis were believed to be home to a water-spirit, or ‘Kelpie’, called Seonaidh, who could only be pacified by throwing a cup of beer into the sea\n\nEducation:\n\nThe Outer Hebrides has a close knit community of schools. Western Isles Council is responsible for four secondary schools across the islands: the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway (around 1,000 students), Sir E Scott School in Tarbert ( approx. 187 students), Sgoil Lionacleit in Benbecula (approx. 256 students) and Castlebay in Barra (approx. 52 students).\n\nScottish Gaelic is still a predominantly spoken language in the Outer Hebrides, with more than 50% of the population fluent in the language. Because of this, there are six primary schools where lessons are taught in both English and Gaelic. Bernera, Breasclete, Castlebay, Lochdar, Leverhulme Memorial and Sgoil an Taobh Siar have Gaelic Schools Status.\n\nFind out more about the school system in Scotland\n\nFind out more about universities in Scotland\n\nLocal industries:\n\nTourism is by far and away the mainstay industry in this region. It generates £65m in economic value for the islands, sustaining around 1000 jobs and is one of the key growth sectors in the islands’ economy. The islands receive 219,000 visitors per year; 930 accommodation providers are directly supported by tourism, and hundreds of other businesses depend on the visitor economy.\n\nOther commercial activities centre on crofting, fishing and weaving which includes the manufacture of Harris Tweed and the area offers potential in renewable energy generation.

Each island is connected by a causeway, bridge or ferry making the journey through the islands a truly unique experience.\n\nTravelling around Outer Hebrides can be achieved by driving, cycling or using public transport, and the islands are connected to the mainland by plane and ferry. The islands are more accessible than ever, with five UK airports reaching Stornoway (Lewis), Benbecula and Barra.\n\nThe outdoors:\n\nWhether you enjoy sea-based activities, are much more comfortable on dry land, or prefer to get up into the mountains, the Outer Hebrides offer something for everyone. Fast and fun downhill mountain biking might be your thing – or exploring one of Scotland’s most incredible long-distance trails, the Hebridean Way.\n\nSurrounded by stunning coastline, the opportunities for activities are endless.

Shetland belonged to Denmark until 1469, when Princess Margaret of Denmark married James III of Scotland – the Islands were part of her dowry 2. The Islands played a secret role in WWII, when ordinary fishing boats formed the ‘Shetland Bus’ – transporting munitions, supplies, and even rescuing refugees 3. Shetland boasts an ancient civilisation that predates the Vikings and the Picts, with Neolithic archaeological sites which date back to 2500 BC 4. The Shetland Isles are located around 160 km (99 miles) closer to Norway than they are to Edinburgh 5.

Fish farming also continues to go from strength to strength, with around 25,000 tonnes of salmon, mussels and other shellfish produced each year. Despite the downturn in North Sea oil production, investment in the oil and gas sector continues unabated, with plans underway to expand and upgrade existing infrastructure at Sullom Voe oil and gas terminal.\n\nShetland’s unique climate and terrain has also yielded many small-scale but profitable food and drink, and textile industries. Its rugged landscape is ideal for rearing livestock, in particular Sheep, which thrive off its nutritious vegetation. These free-roaming flocks provide a bountiful supply of exceptionally soft wool used by local weavers to create Shetland’s world-famous Fair Isle patterned knitwear, not to mention remarkably tender and sweetly flavoured lamb.\n\nFind out more about working in Scotland\n\nTransport:\n\nGetting around Shetland is easy.

It is also teeming with wildlife. From orcas and puffins to the famous Shetland ponies and dolphins, opportunities to spot Shetland’s wild inhabitants are all around. Species like whales and otters are rarely sighted, but seals are easy to spot, while in summer you can witness millions of nesting seabirds including guillemots, razorbills, fulmars and kittiwakes at the cliffs of Sumburgh Head, Hermaness and Noss.\n\nFurther inland, miles of undulating wilderness unfurl to reveal serene lochs populated by wading birds, birds of prey circling overhead, and in the summer months, a myriad of colourful and delicate flowering plants, many unique to Shetland. Come during winter and you might be lucky enough to see that most spectacular of natural phenomena, the ‘mirrie dancers’, what Shetlanders call the aurora borealis or ‘Northern Lights’.\n\nLeisure:\n\nOne of Shetland’s biggest draws has to be the sheer wealth of outdoor activities available. With 900 miles of coastline and plenty of hills to explore, Shetland is made for walking, hiking and cycling. The calm and crystal-clear coastal waters are perfect for kayaking and diving, while anglers are spoilt for choice with more than 300 lochs. Yachting is another popular pastime, especially in summertime, with sailing regattas held regularly.\n\nThe islands also boast an event-packed calendar with Up-Helly-Aa season in January, the world-famous Viking fire festival, Shetland Boat Week in August, and the weeklong Fiddle Frenzy in October.

The tight-knit, diverse community, abundant natural beauty and unspoiled environment also make this a highly desirable place to live.\n\nAlthough there are over 100 islands, only 12 are inhabited, so whether you are a full-time or seasonal resident you can expect properties to be priced at premium in more urbanised areas with quick access to local amenities.
