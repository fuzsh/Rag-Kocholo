        "text": "Smooth Radio recently announced a shake-up of presenters and shows, with Simon Bates losing out to Andrew Castle, who hosts a brand new breakfast show for London from 6am every morning. The station’s new strapline is ‘your relaxing music mix‘. Andrew will also present Andrew Castle Meets on Sunday evenings on the Smooth network, where he will interview a big name celebrity.\n\nKate Garraway launches her mid-morning show on Monday 3rd March and will be heard weekdays 10am – 1pm on Smooth. Paul Phear will present weekday afternoons from 1pm to 4pm, while Anthony Davis will stay on as presenter of The Smooth Drive Home in London from 4pm, Monday to Friday.\n\nChris Skinner will present The Smooth Sanctuary every weekday evening from 8pm and adds the Great British Songbook to the Saturday night schedule. Anthony Davis returns on Sunday evenings with the Great American Songbook show. Classical pianist Myleene Klass hosts Saturday mornings from 10am to 2pm.\n\nWhy the change?\n\nWhile the station’s operator will hope to attract more listeners with well-known faces, the move will doubtless leave avid listeners of Simon Bates and Lynn Parsons somewhat disappointed. Smooth Radio’s facebook page has been inundated with messages for Simon Bates and negative comments on the new presenter line-up.\n\nMeanwhile, Gold’s facebook comments page was recently removed following negative posts, linked to the anticipated reduction in Gold’s service.\n\nThe refresh has happened following the purchase of GMG Radio by Global Radio, owners of Classic FM, Capital FM, Gold, Heart and Xfm.\n\nWhat’s happening to Smooth on national DAB radio?\n\nSmooth Radio are re-introducing local shows for breakfast and drivetime. This means that the national feed of Smooth Radio on national digital radio will close, with AM frequencies currently broadcasting Gold switching to Smooth Radio. In areas where there’s already Smooth Radio on FM and Gold on AM (mediumwave), Gold will hang around. That’s London (1548 MW/AM), Manchester (1458 MW/AM) and East Midlands (945/999 MW/AM).\n\nGlobal Radio have opted to replace Smooth Radio with “ A service featuring music from the 70s, 80s and early 90s with particular appeal to audiences aged 35-54“. This may turn out to be a refreshed version of Gold, or a sub-brand of the operator’s Heart or Smooth stations (Ed’s note: Wouldn’t it be great if it were something a bit different like Xfm? Jon Holmes at breakfast, Josh Widdicombe on Saturdays… the UK is missing a new-rock station).\n\nIt’s worth checking out Gold radio’s apps on mobile, or grab yourself an internet radio to keep listening, when Gold leaves AM and DAB in many areas. The author has just bought a Pure One Flow and it’s a very reliable receiver with the new firmware version 3.2 – look out for our review soon. Scroll down to the bottom of this article to find out how you can check in with Gold on your tv.\n\nHow do I continue to get Smooth on DAB?\n\nIf you’ve lost Smooth on your DAB radio, it’s because it has moved to local multiplexes (bundles of stations).\n\nIf you were listening in and around London up until Monday, March 3rd, your DAB radio would have been picking up Smooth on a national multiplex. We reckon it’s going to steal Gold’s DAB slot on London II, block 12A, so you will may need to retune your DAB radio – usually easy to do if you’ve got a Pure, Revo or Roberts, but a bit of a palava on lesser-branded sets.\n\nHINT: If you see one or more station names on your DAB radio like this: ?Smooth, you haven’t found the “correct” Smooth to tune in to. Look for the label on your radio that just displays Smooth. Your radio has remembered the old national broadcast of Smooth; you can delete the ?Smooth label by selecting “trim station list” in the radio’s options menu.\n\nHow can I get Smooth Radio on FM?\n\nIf you can’t still can’t get Smooth by re-tuning or re-scanning, chances are you’re out of its coverage area on DAB (check the list further down this page of where you should be able to get it), so you’ll have to look for it on FM instead, using your trusty old FM set.\n\nDid you find this information useful?\n\nYou can buy me a coffee (or half a cup) with the link below – thanks!"
