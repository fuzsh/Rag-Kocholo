        "text": "Two blocks of grazing land\n\nLocation\n\nChapel Farm is nestled in the picturesque rolling countryside about 3 miles west of Kilmacolm, a conservation village situated in Inverclyde. Kilmacolm lies 18 miles to the west of Glasgow and is renowned as one of the most affluent villages in Scotland, lying on the north side of the beautiful Gryffe Valley. The village caters for all ages and has a broad range of social activities often centred around the local golf, tennis, squash and bowling clubs. Kilmacolm has its own primary school and the renowned St Columba’s independent school is based here. Transport links are also available for Glasgow’s highly regarded private schools which include Glasgow and Kelvinside academies, The High School of Glasgow, Hutchesons’ Grammar, St Aloysius and Craigholme School for Girls. Retail shopping and a range of supermarkets can be found in both Port Glasgow (6 miles) or Johnstone (7 miles).\n\nThe scenic countryside around Kilmacolm offers excellent trout and salmon fishing opportunities. Outdoor enthusiasts can also enjoy the Sustrans cycle track, which provides routes to Greater Glasgow and central Scotland. Glasgow International Airport is around 13 miles from the property and the M8 offers swift commuting links to the commercial hubs of central Scotland. Kilmacolm offers a frequent bus service while rail connections are to be found in Port Glasgow or Johnstone.\n\nGlasgow has earned a reputation as one of the UK’s leading retail cities, offering a range of shopping complexes including Braehead, Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn and the St Enoch Centre. Cultural experiences include the newly refurbished Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum, Riverside Museum, Glasgow Science Centre, Royal Concert Hall, various theatres, the Burrell Collection (within Pollok Country Park) and a variety of other attractions.\n\nDescription\n\nFarmland extending to approximately 85.6 acres (34.6 hectares) within two distinct blocks, separated by the road leading from Chapel Farm, past Clachers and onward to High Mathernock. Whilst this is a registered public road, it is not maintained by the Council and is no longer a through road due to being impassable at Clachers (but accessible from both ends to this point). The land is a mixture of classes 4(2) and 5(3) with private or natural water sources.\n\nThe land rises from 118m to 190m at the highest point, and provides good grazing and outwintering for livestock. The private water source and collection tank for Chapel Farmhouse is located on the hill and if lot 2 is sold separately, the appropriate rights will be reserved to use and maintain this.\n\nAcreage: 85.6 Acres\n\nDirections"
