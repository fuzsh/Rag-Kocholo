        "text": "Radiotherapy to the head and neck causes temporary (or acute) side effects. Side effects can be mild or more severe, depending on the size of the area being treated and the length of your treatment. They are usually more severe if you have radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy.\n\nSide effects usually begin after about 2 weeks of radiotherapy. They continue to develop for up to 2 weeks after treatment ends, before slowly improving. Most people notice an improvement 6 to 8 weeks after radiotherapy has finished.\n\nRadiotherapy for head and neck cancer can also cause late effects. These are side effects that do not go away, or that develop months or years after treatment.\n\nThe skin on your face and neck will slowly redden or darken and may feel sore and itchy. This usually starts after about 2 weeks of treatment. The skin may get dry and start to peel. Or the area may become moist. You may be given non-stick dressings to cover the area.\n\nThe radiotherapy team will give you advice on how to look after your skin. They can prescribe creams, dressings or painkillers if needed. A skin reaction may be at its worst 2 weeks after treatment, but should start to improve after this.\n\nTips for looking after your skin\n\nWash your skin gently with soap or aqueous cream and lukewarm water. Gently pat it dry. Only use soaps, creams and lotions that your radiotherapy team recommends.\n\nAvoid wet shaving for a time, as your skin will be very delicate.\n\nTry to wear loose, cotton clothing, as this is less likely to irritate sore skin. Avoid anything with a stiff or tight collar.\n\nProtecting the skin from the sun\n\nThe skin in the treated area will be more sensitive to the sun during and after radiotherapy, especially in the first year. Cover up with a hat and a soft cotton or silk scarf around your neck to protect your skin. Use sun-protection cream with an SPF of at least 30 after any skin reaction has gone.\n\nYour mouth and throat are likely to become sore after a few weeks. You may develop mouth ulcers or a mouth infection. Your doctor, radiographer, nurse or dentist will tell you what to look for. Keeping your mouth clean can help to prevent an infection.\n\nYour doctor or nurse will prescribe treatment for any infection, and painkillers to take regularly. Towards the end of radiotherapy, your mouth may be very sore and it can be painful to eat. You may need strong painkillers, such as morphine. Your doctor or specialist nurse can discuss this with you.\n\nWe have more information about coping with mouth problems.\n\nYour dietitian will see you regularly to make sure you get enough nutrition and calories each day. You may need to be fed through a tube if you cannot eat and are losing lots of weight. This is only until treatment is finished and your swallowing is back to normal. You might get back to eating normally a few weeks after radiotherapy has finished. But it may take longer than this.\n\nTips for looking after your mouth and teeth\n\nBrush your teeth or dentures with a small, soft toothbrush after each meal using fluoride toothpaste and gel.\n\nRinse your mouth daily with a non-alcohol-based mouthwash, prescribed by your doctor.\n\nUse a salt or sodium bicarbonate mouthwash at least 4 times a day. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to 900ml of cooled, boiled water. Your radiotherapy team may have a certain mouthwash they recommend you use as well.\n\nIf your dentures are uncomfortable, you may need to leave them out for a few weeks. But speak to the radiotherapy staff first, as this may affect how your radiotherapy mask fits.\n\nRadiotherapy reduces saliva, which helps protect your teeth from decay. After radiotherapy, you are more likely to get tooth decay. It is important to continue looking after your mouth and teeth.\n\nYou should see your dentist every 3 to 6 months and a dental hygienist when your dentist suggests. If problems are found early they are often easier to treat.\n\nRadiotherapy can change the consistency of your saliva. It may become thicker, stringy and sticky, like mucus. It may also build up in the mouth and throat. Tell your nurse or doctor if your mucus is not white or clear (discoloured). This may be caused by an infection.\n\nYou may feel the need to spit often to get rid of the mucus build-up, so it is a good idea to keep tissues with you. Rinsing your mouth regularly can help.\n\nUsing a sodium bicarbonate mouthwash may help clear thick saliva. Ask your specialist nurse for advice about the type of mouthwash that is best for you, and how to prepare it.\n\nSometimes mucus build-up can cause coughing, especially at night. Using a nebuliser regularly, and especially before bed, may help. A nebuliser changes liquid medicine into a fine mist or spray, to help to loosen the mucus. Your nurse or doctor can prescribe a nebuliser and explain how to use it.\n\nChanges in your saliva may improve within about 8 weeks of radiotherapy finishing. But sometimes it continues for several months or longer. Tell your doctor or nurse if this happens. They may be able to prescribe medicines to help."
