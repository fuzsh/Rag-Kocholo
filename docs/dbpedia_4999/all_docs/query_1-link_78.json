        "text": "Gold radio is returning to DAB in many areas on 14th September 2015. If you recall, it was dropped last year in favour of newcomer Smooth Radio, causing a bit of an uproar from dedicated listeners. Gold then dropped most of its popular programmes, leaving just weekday and weekday breakfast alongside a jukebox service for the rest of the day.\n\nNever mind, though, as if you like sixties and seventies music – a genre poorly served by UK radio stations – you can tune in to Gold on DAB digital radio not just in London, East Midlands, and Humberside, where the station is already broadcast on DAB, but also in ‘new’ areas: [Edit: 14th Sept] Central Scotland region – including Edinburgh & Glasgow [Edit 16th Jan 2017 – Note that Gold is NO LONGER AVAILABLE on DAB in Edinburgh & Glasgow due to the expiry of a carriage contract – it was decided that carriage in Central Scotland is no longer cost-effective); Ayr, Bournemouth, Cambridge, Cornwall, Exeter, Torbay and North Devon, Kent, Norwich, Peterborough, Plymouth, Reading & Basingstoke, Southend & Chelmsford, Sussex Coast, Swindon and Birmingham. Manchester listeners can also search out the Gold DAB service, as the station simulcasts its mediumwave broadcast on the digital platform, alongside mediumwave services in greater London (1548 MW) and 954/999 MW in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Keep an eye out for ‘Gold’ in your station list and don’t be afraid to do a retune your DAB radio to see if it pops up in the above areas.\n\nComing to DAB for the first time in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire will be Chill, playing chillout and relaxing ambient music: look for ‘Chill’ in your station list, here. Gold already broadcasts in the East Midlands, so you’ll get a new station here.\n\nGold is jukebox in style pretty much around the clock, with nonstop classic hits, ads and news, but you can still tune in to The More Music Breakfast Show With Tony Dibbin from 06:00 to 10:00am weekdays and, at weekends, David Andrews plays takes the helm from 08:00am to 12:00pm. If nonstop sixties and seventies music is your bag, tune in after 10:00pm on weekdays for two hours back to back from these two decades.\n\nSTOP PRESS (14th Sept 2015): Read about how you can hear Gold radio now in many parts of Scotland and England – it’s back!\n\nIf you’ve been tuning around while the ads are on Gold radio, there’s a good chance you won’t have heard the announcements that in all areas apart from London, Manchester and the East Midlands, Smooth Radio is taking over Gold’s frequencies on DAB and AM. There’s more information in our article here about the changes, which will happen on Monday 24th March. Yorkshire, too, has had a reprieve, as it appears Gold will continue to be broadcast on the region’s DAB digital multiplex until its closure in 2015.\n\nSo, if you find that the only way to tune in to Gold in your area of the country is via your tv box (Sky Channel 0121, Virgin Media Channel 959 and FreeSat Channel 722) but are looking for another way to carry on listening to the revised, jukebox-style Gold, you could think about getting an internet radio, if you don’t fancy tying up your PC or tablet on Gold’s app. You can then add Gold to your favourite list of stations on your internet receiver and listen to its output over the internet.\n\nWhat’s the cheapest option?\n\nCurrently, a Q2 tip ‘n’ tilt internet radio is available for £35 delivered, in a white finish. There’s also a black version for £35 delivered (just look under the list of retailers to find it at this lower price) and a green one for £38. The idea with the Q2 tip ‘n’ tilt is that you firstly connect it to your PC to store a handful of favourite stations on the radio, then unplug from your PC and you’re up and running, having entered your network’s key and password (usually found written on the underside of your router). The advantage of the Q2 is that is has its own built-in rechargeable battery and unlike may radios that require a separate rechargeable battery pack, you can move the Q2 around the house, as long as it’s in range of your wi-fi broadband connection.\n\nIf you don’t mind spending a bit more and want a really reliable internet receiver, the Roberts Stream 83i offers an easy way to start listening to radio stations over the internet. You’ll have access to thousands of internet stations from around the world and literally hundreds playing sixties music, like Absolute Radio 60s, Radio 10 Gold 60s and 70s, British Sixties Radio, Sky.fm’s 60s rock and Radio Sixties 78 from across the water in France, to name a few.\n\nThe author of this blog has a Pure One Flow and, with the latest software running on the radio, it’s a top-notch way to listen to podcasts, streaming radio and catch-up services. The wireless range of the radio is about ten metres with a couple of plasterboard walls in between, but you could buy a wireless range extender to boost your wi-fi signal around the house.\n\nIf you want a little more research, check out our top 3 internet radios feature.\n\nAnd don’t forget, you can also listen to the radio via your PC or tablet, UK RadioPlayer app on iOS, Android or WindowsPhone smartphone.\n\nDid you find this information useful?\n\nYou can buy me a coffee (or half a cup) with the link below – thanks!\n\nGold (radio) has unveiled its forthcoming weekday changes to the schedule, thanks to updated listings information on its website for Monday, 24th March. It’ll be available in far fewer places on mediumwave and DAB digital radio.\n\nYou can also get an internet radio if you want to listen online to Gold, if you find you’re no longer in the station’s revised coverage areas of London & Home Counties, East Midlands or Manchester from March 24th.\n\nAvid listeners will doubtless lament the loss of the presenter rollcall – let’s face it, the station sound won’t be the same by any stretch of the imagination. The station’s schedule seems to infer it will carry less advertising breaks, which is great if you’d rather back-to-back music, but you could stick on a sixties or seventies CD instead, if you find you can no longer receive Gold via your traditional tranny.\n\nWhere has Gold radio gone?\n\nIt has disappeared from many am(mediumwave) and DAB frequencies from 24 March, replaced by Smooth Radio. It hangs on to a few frequencies where Smooth is already broadcast on FM. It’ll still broadcast sounds of the sixties and seventies – and look out for the new seventies, 80s and 90s station due to start on national DAB digital radio, soon.\n\nAnyway, here’s the Monday schedule shamelessly purged and edited from the Gold website:\n\n6am\n\nThe More Music Breakfast Show With Tony Dibbin\n\nJoin Tony for more music in the morning, History or Mystery, The Rock n Roll Alarm Clock and guess the Golden Year at 9am.\n\n10am\n\nGold’s 10 In A Row\n\nGold plays 10 hits in a row commercial free.\n\n1pm\n\nGold’s Number 1’s At 1\n\nThis Gold with 60 minutes of massive Number 1 hits – nonstop!\n\n2pm\n\nGold’s 10 In A Row\n\nGold plays ten hits in a row, without any ad interruptions\n\n4pm\n\nThe Gold Rush\n\nThe greatest hits of all time plus travel, news, weather, finance and sports news for the drive home\n\n8pm\n\nGold’s Music Marathon\n\nPlaying the greatest hits of all time nonstop and uninterrupted\n\n10pm\n\nGold’s Nonstop Sixties\n\n60 minutes of Sixties hits, nonstop\n\n11pm\n\nGold’s Nonstop Seventies\n\n60 minutes of Seventies hits, back-to-back\n\nmidnight\n\nNonstop Gold\n\nPlaying the greatest hits of all time, continuously throughout the night\n\nIt sounds as if Gold radio will be dropping weekday and weekend presenters outside of its breakfast shows from 24th March 2014, confirmed by a response from Gold’s PR team, following a query submitted by a Gold listener to its facebook page.\n\nTony Dibbin presents the Breakfast Show from 6am to 10am every weekday morning, with David Andrews looking after Saturday breakfast from 8am to midday, and Tony taking back the helm from 8am to midday on Sunday.\n\nAfter that, for the majority of the time, it’s back-to-back music as Gold switches to jukebox-only mode, and would appear to be losing presenters such as Dean Martin, Andy Peebles, Shaun Tilley, Eamonn Kelly and Paul Coyte. Let’s hope that the new, national DAB digital commercial station “featuring music from the 70s, 80s and early 90s with particular appeal to audiences aged 35-54”, pencilled in for an imminent launch, might make use of at least a few (if not all) of these presenters, their experience and talent.\n\nIf you haven’t heard, Gold will only be available on traditional analogue radio in Greater London (1548am/MW), Manchester (1458am/MW) and Nottingham & Derby (945am/MW & 999am/MW). It will also broadcast on DAB digital radio in London and in the East Midlands, however the London signal will reach many parts of the home counties, thanks to DAB transmitters at Alexandra Palace, Arkley, Bluebell Hill, BT Tower, Colindale House, Crystal Palace, Guildford, Hampstead, Harrow Weald, Hemel Hempstead, Leatherhead, Stoke d’Abernon, Mount Vernon, Otford, Reigate, Richmond Hill, Shepherds Bush, Shooters Hill, Sidcup, Staines, Uxbridge and Zouches Farm. It’s worth doing a rescan from an upstairs room if you can’t get (or haven’t tried getting) Gold in west Kent, Surrey and West Sussex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Buckinghamshire and other counties surrounding London.\n\nWith the reduction in presenters, it’ll be interesting to see the appetite from loyal listeners for the continuation of the station. Even more illuminating will be the new 70s, 80s and 90s station on Digital One due to launch soon.\n\nDid you find this information useful?\n\nYou can buy me a coffee (or half a cup) with the link below – thanks!\n\nSTOP PRESS (14th Sept 2015): Read about how you can hear Gold radio now in many parts of Scotland and England – it’s back!\n\nThinking of tuning into Gold over the next few weeks? Well you’d better do so while it’s still easy to pick up on DAB and mediumwave, as the station’s frequencies make way for a refreshed Smooth Radio.\n\nThe station is losing many of its frequencies across England and Wales on Monday 24th March 2014, but if you’re lucky enough to live in and around Greater London (1548am/MW), Manchester (1458am/MW), Nottingham & Derby (945am & 999am/MW) you can still hear Gold on analogue radio. It will also broadcast on DAB digital radio in Greater London and in the East Midlands, as Smooth is already available on FM and DAB in these places, so won’t be taking its slots here. Yorkshire, too, has had a reprieve, as it appears Gold will continue to be broadcast on the region’s DAB digital multiplex until its closure in 2015 – however, it’s not broadcast on AM(MW) or FM in the region.\n\nWill Gold still be available in my area on DAB?\n\nSeveral reports suggest that it might continue on DAB in south Wales on the South-East Wales multiplex, but unless Smooth takes spare capacity on the multiplex, it’ll simply be swapped for Gold, which is on the multiplex at present. It’s a similar situation for other multiplexes, with Smooth replacing Gold where the station currently broadcasts, except for the three regions given above.\n\nIf you’re at home and in reach of a Smartphone, you can download the station’s own app, tune in via the UK RadioPlayer or TuneIn via PC or smartphone (including WindowsPhone on your Nokia 520 or similar), get yourself an internet radio (useful if you also want to seek out alternative sixties and seventies music radio stations) or dial up Sky Channel 0121, Virgin Media Channel 959 and FreeSat Channel 722.\n\nTrouble is, infrequent listeners may wonder what on earth is going on when they dial up their favourite provider of 60s and 70s rock and pop, only to find out it has been swallowed up by a female-friendly mix of soft ballads and easy listening.\n\nIf you’re in the two DAB coverage areas listed above, you may want to dust off your DAB and do a re-tune, to see if you can pick up Gold on digital once again.\n\nWhy is Gold leaving DAB? A station with Smooth Radio’s appeal is easier to promote to female stay-at-home listeners (and sell to advertisers) than a rock and pop station aimed predominantly at men. The station’s operator is gambling on attracting many more listeners to a new Smooth Radio, offsetting a substantial loss of Gold listeners.\n\nWhile the changes don’t make much sense for the loyal listener, in pure economic terms more listeners mean greater revenue, leading to a more successful commercial station.\n\nDid you find this information useful?\n\nYou can buy me a coffee (or half a cup) with the link below – thanks!\n\nSmooth Radio recently announced a shake-up of presenters and shows, with Simon Bates losing out to Andrew Castle, who hosts a brand new breakfast show for London from 6am every morning. The station’s new strapline is ‘your relaxing music mix‘. Andrew will also present Andrew Castle Meets on Sunday evenings on the Smooth network, where he will interview a big name celebrity.\n\nKate Garraway launches her mid-morning show on Monday 3rd March and will be heard weekdays 10am – 1pm on Smooth. Paul Phear will present weekday afternoons from 1pm to 4pm, while Anthony Davis will stay on as presenter of The Smooth Drive Home in London from 4pm, Monday to Friday.\n\nChris Skinner will present The Smooth Sanctuary every weekday evening from 8pm and adds the Great British Songbook to the Saturday night schedule. Anthony Davis returns on Sunday evenings with the Great American Songbook show. Classical pianist Myleene Klass hosts Saturday mornings from 10am to 2pm.\n\nWhy the change?\n\nWhile the station’s operator will hope to attract more listeners with well-known faces, the move will doubtless leave avid listeners of Simon Bates and Lynn Parsons somewhat disappointed. Smooth Radio’s facebook page has been inundated with messages for Simon Bates and negative comments on the new presenter line-up.\n\nMeanwhile, Gold’s facebook comments page was recently removed following negative posts, linked to the anticipated reduction in Gold’s service.\n\nThe refresh has happened following the purchase of GMG Radio by Global Radio, owners of Classic FM, Capital FM, Gold, Heart and Xfm.\n\nWhat’s happening to Smooth on national DAB radio?\n\nSmooth Radio are re-introducing local shows for breakfast and drivetime. This means that the national feed of Smooth Radio on national digital radio will close, with AM frequencies currently broadcasting Gold switching to Smooth Radio. In areas where there’s already Smooth Radio on FM and Gold on AM (mediumwave), Gold will hang around. That’s London (1548 MW/AM), Manchester (1458 MW/AM) and East Midlands (945/999 MW/AM).\n\nGlobal Radio have opted to replace Smooth Radio with “ A service featuring music from the 70s, 80s and early 90s with particular appeal to audiences aged 35-54“. This may turn out to be a refreshed version of Gold, or a sub-brand of the operator’s Heart or Smooth stations (Ed’s note: Wouldn’t it be great if it were something a bit different like Xfm? Jon Holmes at breakfast, Josh Widdicombe on Saturdays… the UK is missing a new-rock station).\n\nIt’s worth checking out Gold radio’s apps on mobile, or grab yourself an internet radio to keep listening, when Gold leaves AM and DAB in many areas. The author has just bought a Pure One Flow and it’s a very reliable receiver with the new firmware version 3.2 – look out for our review soon. Scroll down to the bottom of this article to find out how you can check in with Gold on your tv.\n\nHow do I continue to get Smooth on DAB?\n\nIf you’ve lost Smooth on your DAB radio, it’s because it has moved to local multiplexes (bundles of stations).\n\nIf you were listening in and around London up until Monday, March 3rd, your DAB radio would have been picking up Smooth on a national multiplex. We reckon it’s going to steal Gold’s DAB slot on London II, block 12A, so you will may need to retune your DAB radio – usually easy to do if you’ve got a Pure, Revo or Roberts, but a bit of a palava on lesser-branded sets.\n\nHINT: If you see one or more station names on your DAB radio like this: ?Smooth, you haven’t found the “correct” Smooth to tune in to. Look for the label on your radio that just displays Smooth. Your radio has remembered the old national broadcast of Smooth; you can delete the ?Smooth label by selecting “trim station list” in the radio’s options menu.\n\nHow can I get Smooth Radio on FM?\n\nIf you can’t still can’t get Smooth by re-tuning or re-scanning, chances are you’re out of its coverage area on DAB (check the list further down this page of where you should be able to get it), so you’ll have to look for it on FM instead, using your trusty old FM set.\n\n102.2 fm – London\n\n100.4 fm – North West\n\n105.2 fm – Scotland\n\n97.5 / 107.7 fm – North East\n\n105.7 fm – West Midlands\n\n106.6 / 101.4 fm – East Midlands\n\nHow can I get Smooth Radio on other frequencies?\n\nYou’ll be able to tune into Smooth on many of Gold‘s old frequencies on MW mediumwave/AM:\n\nBerkshire and North Hampshire (1431/1485)\n\nBristol and Bath (1260)\n\nCambridgeshire (1332)\n\nDorset and Hampshire (828)\n\nEssex (1359/1431)\n\nGloucester (774)\n\nHampshire (1170/1557)\n\nHerts, Beds and Bucks (792/828)\n\nKent (1242/603)\n\nNorthamptonshire (1557)\n\nNorfolk (1152)\n\nNorth Wales and Cheshire (1260)\n\nPlymouth (1152)\n\nSouth Wales (1305/1359)\n\nSuffolk (1170/1251)\n\nSussex (1323/945)\n\nWiltshire (936/1161)\n\nYou should be able to pick up Smooth in the following DAB digital radio coverage areas:\n\nBath and Wiltshire\n\nBedfordshire\n\nBournemouth\n\nBuckinghamshire\n\nBristol and Bath\n\nCambridge\n\nExeter and Torbay\n\nGreater London\n\nHumberside\n\nKent\n\nLeeds\n\nLeicester\n\nNorwich\n\nNottingham\n\nNorthamptonshire\n\nPeterborough\n\nPlymouth\n\nReading and Basingstoke\n\nSouth Hampshire\n\nSouth Wales\n\nSouth Yorkshire\n\nSouthend and Chelmsford\n\nSussex Coast\n\nSwindon\n\nIt’s a major disappointment if you’re into the sort of music Gold currently plays – but Gold is still around on Freesat: 722, Sky: 0121, TalkTalk TV: 611, Virgin Media: 959, Virgin TV (ex Telewest only): 941 (South West only), WightCable Audio Channels: 2\n\nSmooth can be heard on digital tv on the following channels: Sky Channel 0128, Virgin Media Channel 916, Freeview Channel 718 and Freesat Channel 732\n\nDid you find this information useful?\n\nYou can buy me a coffee (or half a cup) with the link below – thanks!\n\nWhy can’t I get LBC or Xfm on DAB radio any more in my area?\n\nSTOP PRESS (14th Sept 2015): Read about where Xfm has gone and likely reasons why you can’t receive its successor, Radio X.\n\nTwo regional multiplexes have closed, which means there’s no room on their equivalent local multiplexes for either LBC or Xfm to fit on. The same problem applies to Real Radio XS, UCB and Gold in the North-East of England and Real Radio XS, UCB and local community station Mountain FM in South Wales and The West.\n\nIf you’re on the South Wales coast, it’s worth seeing if you can pick up Xfm from the North-Devon DAB transmitter. Chances are, the station won’t be broadcast in Devon forever, but if you’re missing your wake-up call, it’s worth a try.\n\nThe issue is also one of finances: it’s a large investment and a long contract duration for even the biggest station operators to place each of their brands on DAB, therefore they need to consider whether they’ll make enough revenue from advertising to justify the outlay. It’s easier to sell advertising when there’s an equivalent local FM station covering the same broadcast area as DAB, as listeners numbers will inevitably be higher. Unfortunately “niche” stations on DAB tend to have fewer listeners, particularly when they originate “out of the area”.\n\nBackground\n\nConsolidation, consolidation, consolidation – it’s what the radio industry is going through at the moment. Following today’s news that Bauer Media (of Key 103, Clyde 1 and Heat Radio fame) is acquiring Absolute Radio with a cornucopia of “decades” brands, let’s hope there’s room for a decent nationwide modern rock brand (with witty, real, live talking presenters, not voicetracked garbage and shallow links) to take the place of Xfm whose availability on digital radio is being cut back, due to a squeeze on the space now available on DAB thanks to the closure of two huge multiplexes with extensive coverage of the North-East of England and South Wales and the West of England.\n\nSimilarly, since the historical rebrand of Talk Radio to talkSPORT (and its more recent repositioning as a 24-hour nonstop football-and-other-sports talk station), LBC has stolen the baton from disenfranchised listeners and has been busily entertaining expats and hooked talk radio fans in Scotland, South Wales and the North-East for many years since the rolling news service DNN (remember that?) was dropped, as an alternative speech station needed to meet regional license requirements.\n\nThese two stations became quasi-national brands thanks to the rollout of regional DAB multiplexes and attracted a relatively small but extremely loyal following.\n\nWay back in 2007 a second national commercial multiplex was advertised and 4DigitalGroup were awarded the license to operate stations such as the new talkRADIO, to sit alongside talkSPORT, and Original, an album-track-driven station from an overseas operator. Unfortunately, due to the economic downturn, plans for new radio stations were binned.\n\nHad the regional multiplexes been extended to cover as wide an area as this proposed second multiplex, the stations on it might have attracted more listeners as a result of better and dependable coverage, and certainty for listeners that they’ll receive the same stations whether they live in South Wales or South Shields.\n\nFast forward to today – in this period of closures, consolidation and lack of clarity – and we have yet more uncertainty and confusion for loyal listeners than ever before. They don’t really care for the mechanics as to why they can no longer access their station on DAB, they just know it’s going to be a pain to switch to internet radio or a less-reliable app and will either turn off or look elsewhere for their audio entertainment."
