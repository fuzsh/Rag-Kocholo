        "text": "Nadz’s passion for travel and adventure has seen him kissing a shark, visiting the palaces of Kings, absorbing great architecture and taking to the natural springs all whilst filming in 50 degrees heat. Nadz made his name presenting travel films, lifestyle features and documentaries across local, national and international television and radio. Broadcaster Nadz has reported from across the globe, interviewed the stars at our biggest events and found fame presenting a wide range of magazine programmes as well as music, showbiz and style output.\n\nAt the age of 15, Nadz won a modelling competition that he knew nothing about as his sister had sent in his photos without telling him. Nadz was soon the subject of local press interest, appeared on the cover of a youth magazine and was taken on by a modelling agent. TV stardom soon followed. Nadz filmed documentaries in Dubai and Egypt in which he uncovered the country’s hidden heritage.\n\nNadz brought the sounds of Asia to a huge audience when he hosted weekly worldwide music programme Wagwan and covered London Fashion Week for Fashion TV where, as well as getting the gossip from the designers and checking out the catwalk, he interviewed some of our brightest stars including Jennifer Saunders, Anne Robinson and Janet Street-Porter. Not only that, but Nadz even had a role in film, King of Bollywood starring Sophie Dahl and Om Puri when the team from Mumbai filmed in London.Nadz’s creative talents have spilled in all directions as he has written and published two books, released two albums of chillout music and several singles.\n\nNadz’s desire to bring not only our own popular culture but also fascinating stories from around the world to an audience in his own trendy and laid-back style is what gives him that uniqueness and it is his versatility that is the secret of his success.\n\nNikki’s joined Sunrise Radio as a complete newbie to radio without any prior experience!\n\nBorn in Calcutta, half Punjabi – half Bengali, she’s got the best of both worlds! Nikki is a massive Bollywood junkie and is obsessed with her Punjabi and Bollywood tracks! Nikki is a huge cricket fan and has been playing competitive cricket since she was 8 years old. She currently plays for Surrey CCC and also has a degree in Economics. She’s an absolute foodie and loves to try new dishes and explore new restaurants! She also loves to travel, if she had it her way, she would be going away every month! When not doing radio, Nikki who claims to be in a quarter-life crisis is currently working within sports broadcasting and social media.\n\nStarting off in the early 80’s San-j Sanj pioneered the daytimer club scene as a DJ and Promoter. Not resting on his laurels Sanj fulfilled one of his other dreams by going into music production, his first 12 inch single; titled Xzecutive, sold around 4000 copies on white label thus making Sanj (Xzecutive) the first ever Brit-Asian DJ to release a 12 inch single. This led to a turning point when Sanj alongside his brother Amit signed a contract with Multitone Records in 1990 to remix their vast Bhangra and Bollywood catalogue, the result was Extra Hot 1, now known as a milestone in remixing, Sanj followed this up with Garma Garam 1, remixes of Amitabh Bachchan songs – This is known to be the first ever Bollywood remix album. The early 90’s for San-j Sanj were extremely busy with International tours, recording albums. By the late 90’s San-j Sanj introduced Bollywood music to his live sets, even though it was ahead of its time the movement had begun. By 1999, Sanj launched the first ever Bollywood Club Night in London – Escapizm @ Bar Chocolate playing a mix of Bollywood with club beats such as Garage, Drum and Bass, House and RnB, dubbed as BomBass. The club night was appreciated, this resulted in Sanj becoming resident DJ for Kuch Kuch Nights launched at Bar Bollywood – the night since has become the longest running Bollywood club night in Europe, celebrating 16 years in 2016. Next for San-j Sanj was a stint in radio with Westside Radio and BBA, it was from here that Sanj was noticed for his radio ability and swiftly moved to the newly branded Club Asia in 2001. Sanj broadcasted “The Show With No Name” this show, was the first on commercial radio to have a mix of Indian and English songs; the mix of music was so successful that it became the sound for the station. Sanj was headhunted in 2003 by the BBC Asian Network and worked on the chart show for 18 months. In 2005, San-j Sanj returned to Club Asia and also launched his club night 2WiCE as SPiCE, this club night became the biggest weekly Bollywood club night in London, running for over two years. 2007 – Sanj was chosen as the London champion to curate Soho Road to Punjab which was an exhibition based mainly on how Bhangra developed in London. Whilst juggling his DJ career, radio and events. Sanj has mentored and nurtured many names that have made it in the industry.\n\nBorn in Calcutta, raised in Delhi and now a Londoner, Shabnam graduated with a First in Political Science from the prestigious Miranda House, but opted for a media career at 21 as she read for a Masters at LSR. Beginning with All India Radio, she also did Commercial Radio (Times FM/Radio Mirchi, Radio Midday) and National TV as a primetime newsreader for ZEE News. Shabnam was one of the pioneers of Internet Radio in the 90s (Radio Asianet). Her fluency in Hindi/English proved to be a real asset on stage, hosting lifestyle shows/ music gigs and scripting/voicing for Star, Sony, Zee, TWI, Doordarshan and National Geographic. She wrote for Hindustan Times and Cosmopolitan. In 2002, Shabnam moved to London and joined Sunrise Radio – hosting a show on weekdays and the weekend Top20. Later, she spent six exciting months in India for a travel show on Belgian TV (INDIA FOR BEGINNERS) showcasing India for European audiences. This lead to her first book, Snapshots From Home. Currently, she is working on a novel and guiding walks for foodies in London’s Brick Lane when not on Sunrise! Married with two children, Shabnam loves Bollywood, travel and food in equal measure\n\nRaj Ghai has been in the media game for some time now. He never reveals exactly how many years for fear of giving away his age! He’s probably best known in the industry as a publicist and has worked with a number of celebrities worldwide. During his career he has produced music albums, worked as a music journalist, presented on radio and also hosted TV shows on both Asian and mainstream channels! He currently presents his weekly ‘Desi Beat’ show on Colors TV as well as the breakfast show on Sunrise Radio of course. He’s an avid cook and is regarded by some as a restaurant and food reviewer or critic. Being a ‘foodie’, Raj Ghai also co-presents a fun online weekly cookery show called ‘Easy Cooking Made Difficult’ – the name says it all. Raj keeps himself busy by also running his own record label and media agency and is currently developing his own food brand! Raj has a dog. He also has a fish tank with no fish!\n\nI am a Television & Radio presenter, and an ‘Energy Alignment’ Coach. It may sound corny but, connecting with a wide range of people from across the globe is one of the reasons I love what I do. I would probably fail miserably to hold down, for more than a few months, a job that lacks this!\n\nThe person you hear on radio or see on the telly is quite possibly not the real me – even I don’t know who that is! (Not sure I should’ve told you this) My family would probably describe me as: Polite, (they have no idea!), empathetic, caring, charitable and far too busy, a health freak obsessed about organic foods, and a chatterbox who easily loses track of time (30mins later and still explaining why she loves the colour yellow!) I love hanging out with positive peeps who practice empathy and carry with them a natural high for life, constantly motivating others to do well. I will always have time for these champs. Hot and spicy food is my weakness…like, seriously HOT!\n\nI have so many strengths they should have named me Samson! On second thoughts…he was a man, and Greek, so scrap that :-/ (The hair is probably the only thing in common – sorry Samson!) Love what you do, and do what you love…and you’ll never work another day in your life 😉"
