        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nI recently took a vacation to the UK and traveled to Glasgow, London, and Inverness by train.\n\nMy trip to Glasgow was affected by strikes, and bad weather caused crowding on my train to London.\n\nDespite some stressful rides, I was grateful for the ability to travel without renting a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn my first-ever visit to the UK, my partner and I traveled by train from Edinburgh to Glasgow, London, and Inverness.\n\nI've taken Amtrak rides before, but I'd never experienced the railway system in the UK.\n\nAll of our trips began at Edinburgh Waverley railway station in Edinburgh, Scotland, which is the second-largest train station in the UK, according to RailEurope.\n\nIn total, I traveled by train for 1,200 miles and 20 hours during my visit to the UK.\n\nWe used the ScotRail and LNER mobile apps to book our tickets.\n\nWe took ScotRail for trips within Scotland, and LNER (London North Eastern Railway) to get to King's Cross in London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA round-trip ticket from Edinburgh Waverley to Glasgow Queen Street cost £28, or around $34.\n\nThe 45-mile journey took a little under an hour. It seemed similar to the hour-long, $40 ride from Manhattan to the town of Cold Spring in upstate New York that friends of mine have taken on the Metro-North Railroad.\n\nOn my train to Glasgow, most of the seats were arranged around tables in sets of four. It wasn't very full, so I had plenty of room to spread out. I appreciated how the table seating made the small space feel less cramped. The train didn't have as many cars as the Amtrak or Metro North trains I've taken, and the cars themselves felt a bit smaller, as well.\n\nThe train's bathroom was similar to one on an airplane.\n\nThe small cubicle featured an automatic sink, soap dispenser, and hand dryer, which prevented the mess that paper towels can create.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI enjoyed taking in views of the Scottish countryside along the way.\n\nBefore I knew it, the train arrived at Glasgow's Queen Street station in the center of town.\n\nI figured I'd take my time sightseeing in Glasgow and book a train when I was ready to return to my friend's apartment in Edinburgh. That was a mistake.\n\nScotRail's website said that the last train from Glasgow to Edinburgh usually leaves close to midnight, which would have given me plenty of flexibility. However, I hadn't been following the local news about striking railway workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI almost got stranded in Glasgow because railway workers were striking that day, causing stations to close early.\n\nI was perusing exhibits at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum around 4:30 p.m. when I decided to check train times for the evening. I was shocked to see that the last train was leaving in an hour, not 11:53 p.m as I had previously thought. I rushed back to the station, booking myself a ticket as I ran, and snagged a seat on a crowded car.\n\nIn my research later, I learned that an industrial action held that day by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) was part of a months-long dispute between the union, the government, and rail companies over salaries and working conditions.\n\nIn a classic tourist mistake, I had missed the company's memo advising people to only travel if necessary during the industrial action due to \"very limited services.\"\n\n\"If you have to travel, you should expect disruption and plan ahead,\" ScotRail's website said.\n\nOops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur five-hour, 400-mile journey to London was disastrous due to inclement weather.\n\nThe four trains before ours were canceled due to flooding from heavy rain. That meant our train ended up containing four trains' worth of passengers.\n\nA representative for LNER told Insider that customers were advised against traveling that day due to the impact of the extreme weather, and that LNER made ticket purchases valid for the following day when services were restored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur seat reservations were no longer valid because of overcrowding.\n\nConductors told people to sit wherever they could find a seat since there were so many people on the train. We got there 15 minutes early, but there were no seats left.\n\nAn LNER representative directed Insider to the company's seat guarantee scheme, which allows passengers to receive a refund if they reserved seats but then find that none are available.\n\nThere was also no food service because workers couldn't get through the aisles.\n\nNormally, I would have been able to scan a QR code and have snacks or drinks delivered directly to my seat. That wasn't possible on this trip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many people on board, the bathroom was a mess.\n\nIt was difficult to even get to the bathroom because of all the people crammed in the aisles. When I finally squeezed past the crowds, I found an overflowing garbage can and toilet paper strewn all over the sink and floor.\n\nUsually, bathrooms are regularly cleaned and checked for soap and water supplies, according to LNER.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter standing for an hour and a half, we transferred to a different train that had more room.\n\nThankfully, our ride from London back to Edinburgh went smoothly.\n\nRound-trip, the train ride cost £132 (around $162).\n\nThough it was the most expensive train ticket of our vacation, our trip to London was more cost-effective than Amtrak routes of a similar distance in America. For example, a 300-mile Amtrak ride from New York City to Portland, Maine, takes almost seven hours and can range between $69 and $167 each way, according to the travel booking site Wanderu. Our LNER trips to and from London were almost two hours shorter despite being 100 miles longer, and they cost about as much as a one-way Amtrak ticket in total.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur four-hour trip to Inverness was my favorite train ride by far.\n\nI made sure to check local news to ensure that our trip to Inverness wouldn't be impacted by an industrial action or weather.\n\nThe trip cost £36.60, or around $45 — much cheaper than Amtrak rides I've booked of the same length.\n\nHot chocolate from the trolley was the perfect complement to the scenic snow-capped mountains we passed along the way.\n\nAs we climbed further into the Highlands, we began to see gorgeous mountain ranges, rushing streams, and some adorable Highland cattle. I did get some reading done, but I spent most of the ride taking in the scenery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe accessible bathrooms on the train were spacious and clean, and they even included a full-length mirror.\n\nThe doors to the bathroom opened and closed automatically with the touch of a button.\n\nThe journey back to Edinburgh from Inverness at dusk was one of the most beautiful train rides I've ever taken in my life.\n\nEven with the headaches we encountered on our other rides, trains are still a great way to see some stunning landscapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nUK\n\nAdvertisement"
