        "text": "Also Oxygen!\n\nhttps://glasgowradio.co.uk\n\nNo sign of \"Oxygen\" on the Glasgow Small-scale mux.\n\nOn their website there is some blurb stating.... \"Oxygen Radio UK is a truly unique and distinctive brand specifically targeting Glasgow, flavoured with popular music from the 1980’s to today’s current hits.\"\n\nThat means it is up against Clyde 1, Clyde 2, Nation, Smooth, Pure, GO Radio plus current hits on Heart and Capital. That's 8 stations playing much-of-a-muchness although Clyde 2 is 'Greatest Hits' from the 80s, 90 as is Nation with a 'classic hits' format.\n\n0\n\nHad a listen last week , so been on mux before 1st.\n\nSounded good.\n\nSo now we have\n\nNation ,. Go, Pure,. The Max, Beat 106,\n\nClyde 1, Capital, Smooth, Heart ,\n\nCentral, Kingdom, , Forth 1, ..\n\nLike Tv , it's getting ridiculous.\n\nToo much the sameo sameo.\n\nNation, Go & Pure join = 1 station\n\nCentral +Kingdom join=1station\n\nThe Max if going to be a Rock Scotland and Beat a dance Scotland but it's getting a bit cluttered especially around the Glasgow area but what do I know.\n\nAlong with all the community stations accross the country and Bauer and Global playing mostly the same pop pop pop ,. If you want variety I guess Internet radio is the way to go.\n\nWhen local dab spreads access the country, maybe The Max will join them and compete with the big players but at the moment it's just another station sameo sameo.\n\n0\n\nHad a listen in yesterday and rather enjoyed it. It's certainly a solid enough sounding station with an edgy, spicy, guitar led playlist and suitable sung jingles. Alec Horsburgh on yesterday afternoon doing his thing blending the sports chat and results with music knowledge, always a good listen, and Tom Russell sounding very happy back on air on his Rock Show last night.\n\nBill Young's Talking Football returns to weekday evenings- sure is a choice of weekday football listening in the west at that time now!\n\nMy guess is that the business proposition here is the same as Go had in mind when it first came along 5 years ago which is that high DAB carriage costs are eliminated by carriage on the trial MUX, yet still reaching a substantial potential audience, and the main overhead only really being the DJ and staff wages, so this way the sums are more likely to stack up and it is all more sustainable.\n\nSure is a competitive marketplace though and nowadays arriving back in the Glasgow area and tuning around feels a bit like arriving in New York!\n\n0\n\nSure is a competitive marketplace though and nowadays arriving back in the Glasgow area and tuning around feels a bit like arriving in New York!\n\nVery true! So, lets have a recap what is available in the Glasgow area market from a Glasgow area studio:\n\nThe Max - DAB digital radio SS DAB mux\n\nGO Radio - DAB digital radio Central Scotland Regional mux\n\nPure Radio - DAB Central Scotland Regional mux\n\nNation Radio* - 96.3 FM and DAB SS DAB mux\n\nClyde 1 - 102.5 FM and DAB Glasgow region mux\n\nClyde 2 - 1152 AM and DAB Glasgow region mux\n\nCapital - 106.1 FM and DAB Glasgow region mux\n\nHeart - 100.3 FM and DAB Glasgow region mux\n\nSmooth - 105.2 FM and DAB Glasgow region mux\n\nCeltic Music Radio - 95FM and DAB SS mux\n\nRevival FM - 93FM and DAB SS mux\n\nSunny Govan Radio - 103.5 FM\n\nInsight Radio - 101FM\n\nAwaz FM - 107.2 FM and DAB SS mux\n\nRadio Ramadhan 365 - 1530AM and DAB SS mux\n\n*Nation Radio does not have a studio in Glasgow, but a couple of DJs live in Glasgow and are v/t home working. Station playout centre is near Cardiff, South Wales.\n\nStudios outside the Glasgow city boundary, but receivable within Glasgow\n\nCamGlen Radio - 107.9 FM\n\nPaisley FM - 107.5 FM and DAB Glasgow SS mux\n\nPulse 98.4 - 98.4 FM\n\nCumbernauld FM - 106.8 FM\n\n0\n\nSo in frequency order excluding BBC ...\n\n93.0. REVIVAL FM. GLM\n\n95.0 CELTIC MUSIC GLM\n\n96.3 NATION SCOT GLM\n\n98.4 PULSE 98.4 GLM\n\n100.3 HEART G+W\n\n100.7. REVIVAL FM. 101.1 INSIGHT. GLM\n\n102.5 CLYDE 1 FM G+W\n\n103..5 SUNNY GOVAN 105.2 SMOOTH SCOT G+W\n\n105.7 CAPITAL SCOT G+W\n\n106.8 CUMBERNAULD FM\n\n107.2. AWAZ FM GLM\n\n107.5. PAISLEY FM GLM\n\n107.9 CAMGLEN\n\n1530. RAMADHAN. GLM THE MAX GLM OXYGEN GLM\n\nGLM - Glasgow Local Mux\n\nG+W - Glasgow + West Mux\n\nSo do you reckon The Max is from the same people of the original Rockport. ?\n\nAlso in Edinburgh,. They have their share of community stations but not a Nation type station to compete against Forth . Why is that ? Although Kingdom comes through on 96.1 quite a bit.\n\n0\n\nAlso in Edinburgh,. They have their share of community stations but not a Nation type station to compete against Forth . Why is that ? Although Kingdom comes through on 96.1 quite a bit.\n\nWhen an Edinburgh city licence was advertised and issued, it went to Talk 107 which failed and closed down. The frequency was never re-advertised and eventually went to a community station somewhere in the vicinity.\n\nNation on 96.3 was very much a \"one-off\" - a single licence advertised and awarded years after any others due to the closure of the previous Paisley licence. It's not likely to be something that will ever be repeated.\n\n0\n\nSo do you reckon The Max is from the same people of the original Rockport. ? Also in Edinburgh,. They have their share of community stations but not a Nation type station to compete against Forth . Why is that ? Although Kingdom comes through on 96.1 quite a bit.\n\nCity of Edinburgh does not have a community station as such, except of BFBS (was Garison Radio on 98.5 FM). However, in Midlothian there is Black Diamond FM and Crystal FM. East Lothian has East Coast FM and Radio Saltire. They all overspill in some small ways in different parts of Edinburgh, but no Edinburgh service.\n\nLearn more about Nation Radio (Scotland) on DS search. Up to 870 posts on 35 pages!\n\nAs for The Max, many of the same people in programming were with previous versions of RockSport. However, it is a new company and director. RockSport closed and went in liquidation. Format is similar.\n\n0\n\nSo do you reckon The Max is from the same people of the original Rockport. ? Also in Edinburgh,.

Format is similar.\n\nLeith FM had a good Edinburgh signal, but I suppose the reason why there's no Forth 1 alternative is because ofcom are yet to hand out a trial mux license for the lothians?\n\nThe alternatives to Forth 1 are Capital on 105.7 and Heart on 101.1 FM. On DAB there is Kingdom, Central, Pure, GO and dozens of others, but none are Edinburgh based. Do remember that the Forth 1 TSA is just 1.2m - the market is not big enough to support another stand-alone commercial station as Nation has found in the Glasgow market with 1.9m.\n\n0"
