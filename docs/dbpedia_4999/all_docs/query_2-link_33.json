        "text": "A versatile small holding within an attractive and accessible rural location\n\nLocation\n\nChapel Farm is nestled in the picturesque rolling countryside about 3 miles west of Kilmacolm, a conservation village situated in Inverclyde. Kilmacolm lies 18 miles to the west of Glasgow and is renowned as one of the most affluent villages in Scotland, lying on the north side of the beautiful Gryffe Valley. The village caters for all ages and has a broad range of social activities often centred around the local golf, tennis, squash and bowling clubs. Kilmacolm has its own primary school and the renowned St Columba’s independent school is based here. Transport links are also available for Glasgow’s highly regarded private schools which include Glasgow and Kelvinside academies, The High School of Glasgow, Hutchesons’ Grammar, St Aloysius and Craigholme School for Girls. Retail shopping and a range of supermarkets can be found in both Port Glasgow (6 miles) or Johnstone (7 miles).\n\nThe scenic countryside around Kilmacolm offers excellent trout and salmon fishing opportunities. Outdoor enthusiasts can also enjoy the Sustrans cycle track, which provides routes to Greater Glasgow and central Scotland. Glasgow International Airport is around 13 miles from the property and the M8 offers swift commuting links to the commercial hubs of central Scotland. Kilmacolm offers a frequent bus service while rail connections are to be found in Port Glasgow or Johnstone.\n\nGlasgow has earned a reputation as one of the UK’s leading retail cities, offering a range of shopping complexes including Braehead, Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn and the St Enoch Centre. Cultural experiences include the newly refurbished Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum, Riverside Museum, Glasgow Science Centre, Royal Concert Hall, various theatres, the Burrell Collection (within Pollok Country Park) and a variety of other attractions.\n\nDescription\n\nChapel Farmhouse is a traditional stone and slate, two storey farmhouse with adjoining and adjacent traditional stone buildings providing storage and stabling, as well as a general purpose portal framed shed with a concrete floor. Accessed from the adjacent minor public road (which provides access to one other property), the house is south facing with generous enclosed gardens and outstanding countryside views. Included within the package is approximately 14.6 acres (5.9 hectares) of grazing land providing a privacy buffer around the property, suitable for keeping horses or other animals.\n\nThe property is presented over two floors as shown on the accompanying floorplans and is understood to have been significantly extended and remodelled in the 1950’s to create the home you see today. The main front entrance leads into a generous reception hall from which all accommodation is accessible. The southern elevation of the house has a sizeable sitting room which benefits from triple aspect windows, providing a wealth of natural light, and also has an open fireplace. There is a small office off the sitting room, with a door leading to the south facing front garden. The kitchen/ breakfast room has a range of floor and wall units and benefits from an electric dual oven AGA. There is space for a small dining table and chairs and a drying pulley is suspended from the ceiling. Off the kitchen there is a boot room with an exterior door to the parking area beside the road. Off the main hall there is also a family bathroom. The remaining ground floor accommodation, which extends into the northern elevation of the house (on a slightly higher level with three steps up), features a bedroom (which would make a great office with fine views over the surrounding countryside), dining room and a family room (could be a further bedroom).\n\nOn the first floor there are three further bedrooms and a bathroom.\n\nAdjoining the house is a a wood store and garage (which could potentially be extended into subject to appropriate consents) and opposite the house on the other side of the road there are further traditional buildings with original stable stalls and a wood store. Finally there is a secure steel portal frame building with a concrete floor which could be used for a variety of purposes including livestock and equestrian use, or as a workshop/general storage.\n\nThe L shaped house and garage sit within attractive gardens which are bounded by a stone dyke and post and rail fencing. There is a south facing patio which extends round to the west side of the house, and there are lawns to the south and west punctuated by mature trees and shrubbery providing a charming backdrop to the private garden with countryside views.\n\nFarmland – There are 14.6 acres (5.9 hectares) of farmland surrounding the property, divided by the two adjacent roads, as shown on our accompanying sale plan. The land is split into six enclosures and is a mixture of classes 3(2), 4(2) and 5(3) according to the James Hutton Institute of Soil Research. The land is currently used for grazing purposes but could be cut for silage or hay. The lower fields are generally level, whilst the top fields are sloping, rising from 117m to 145m above sea level. The fields are watered by private water supply or natural sources.\n\nAcreage: 14.6 Acres\n\nDirections"
