Guardian Media Group plc (âGMGâ) today announces that it has conditionally acquired Saga Radio from Saga Group Limited for an undisclosed sum.

Saga Radio currently operates three radio services in the UK, based in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Glasgow, with a fourth due to launch across the North East in 2007. Also included within the acquisition are the digital radio assets of Saga Radio.

Together the four services will broadcast to a population of some 9.5 million adults. The three Saga stations on air currently attract 849,000 adults and deliver 9.7 million listening hours, with significant opportunities for future growth.

Following this acquisition GMG Radio now owns 12 major FM stations covering the majority of the UK population.

Programming growth from this acquisition and the recently acquired Century stations, coupled with expected growth from smooth fm following the format change in London, will support the continued expansion of GMG Radioâs scale in the UK commercial radio market.

Carolyn McCall, Chief Executive of Guardian Media Group plc, said:

“This further expansion of our radio division will help to ensure the continued success and growth of GMG.

“The addition of these stations to the portfolio gives GMG Radio real scale and confirms its status as a major player in the UK radio market.”

John Myers, Chief Executive of GMG Radio, added:

“These are four good stations that fit well within our group and with dual housing and re-branding we can deliver powerful synergies.

“Furthermore, our format change in London will allow us to develop a near-national brand aimed at an older demographic. Alongside this, we expect that our successful Century and Real Radio stations and the launch of our new North East station in 2007 will ensure that GMG becomes the third largest radio group in total hours by the end of next year with a broad appeal to all adults over 25.

“It is our intention to re-brand the Saga stations in due course, to a name yet to be announced.”
