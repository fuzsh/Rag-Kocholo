Sustainability? Of course!

Franz Ziel GmbH has been located in a rural area since its foundation almost 40 years ago.

Living in and with nature is a matter of course here and so environmental and climate protection has always been an integral part of the company philosophy for FZ as well.

Almost 10 years ago – long before the current sustainability discussions – innovative solar & heat pump technology was used in the creation of Plant 2 in order to cover the energy requirements to the maximum with ecofriendly, climate-friendly and renewable energies.
