Franz Inc. and Geoscience Experts Recognize the Growing Importance of Semantic Knowledge Graphs for Earth Science

OAKLAND, Calif., April 22, 2019 â In celebration of Earth Day, Franz Inc., an early innovator in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and leading supplier of Semantic Graph Database technology for Knowledge Graphs, today recognized how AllegroGraph, its semantic knowledge graph technology, is playing an essential part in making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) for the geoscience community. Since the current understanding of earth science processes is largely based on earth observation and numerical model data, making this data FAIR for all geoscientists and technologists is critical to facilitate future knowledge discovery about planet Earth.

Collecting, storing, monitoring and analyzing data from the core of the Earth up to the atmosphere provides critical knowledge about the planet and how living things interact with it. Scientists and technologists gather information about Earth from a range of sources, including: satellites, air- ground- and ocean-based sensors, physical sample data, etc., which are all recorded at a variety of temporal and spatial resolutions and need to be represented on the web for the global scientific community to access and use. AllegroGraphâs unique semantic graph capabilities allow diverse and complex data sources to be easily integrated with full search and cross-dataset queries possible.

"Our most pressing global environmental challenges cannot be solved by a single organization," said Dr. Annie Burgess, Lab Director, Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP). "Scientists require data collected across multiple disciplines, which are often managed by many different agencies and institutions. ESIP is a community of data and information technology professionals dedicated to ensuring those data are FAIR. To assist with that goal, the unique semantic graph capabilities of AllegroGraph are leveraged with the ESIP Community Ontology Repository, a community platform to manage and exchange terms and vocabularies that assists scientists to publish, discover and reuse data."

Barefoot Networks Uses Franzâs Allegro CL to Drive Artificial Intelligence in Networks

OAKLAND, Calif., April 16, 2019 â Franz Inc., an early innovator in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and leading supplier of Common Lisp (CL) development tools along with Graph Database technology for Knowledge Graphs, today announced that Barefoot Networks uses Franz Allegro CLÂ® (Allegro Common Lisp) in the design of the Barefoot Tofino series programmable switch chips to enable Artificial Intelligence, solve complexity, drive superior performance and power efficiency within networks.

"At Barefoot Networks we use Lisp (via Allegro CLâs Enterprise class development environment) in the design of our Tofino series of programmable switch chips," said Patrick Bosshart, CTO and Co-founder, Barefoot Networks. "Important to us are basic features of the language like its ability to manipulate symbolic data, to represent programs and create embedded languages. We have created embedded languages for building design netlists, and for the gate placement and routing phases of physical design. All of these have the expressive power of lisp seamlessly included. We build custom module generators and layout compilers on a scale significantly larger and more complex than industry standard approaches, which we believe gives us significant competitive advantages in chip area, performance and power efficiency."

"The best software programmers in the world choose Common Lisp since it is the most exciting language for deploying Artificial Intelligence solutions. Lisp delivers powerful symbolic computing capabilities and its unique homoiconicity simply makes learning systems more powerful that other programming languages," said Dr. Jans Aasman, CEO of Franz Inc. "We are pleased that Barefoot Networks has tapped into the power of Allegro CL to apply the benefits of Artificial Intelligence to the future of programmable networks."

Franz and Semantic Web Company Partner to Create a Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph

September 13, 2018 - Franz Inc., an early innovator in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and leading supplier of Semantic Graph Database technology, AllegroGraph, for Knowledge Graphs, and Semantic Web Company, developers of the PoolParty Semantic Suite and leading provider of Semantic AI solutions, today announced a partnership to develop the Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph. This project is the first aimed at connecting all the works from a public figure and turning the linked information into a searchable and retrievable resource for the public.

The Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph project will organize and semantically link the vast knowledge domain surrounding Noam Chomsky, the founder of modern linguistics, a founder of cognitive science, and a major figure in analytic philosophy as well as an American linguist, philosopher, historian and social critic. Chomsky is currently an Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona. He has received many awards including Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American Psychological Association, the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, the Helmholtz Medal, the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award, and the Ben Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science....

Franz’s CEO, Jans Aasman to participate on a panel for a "Conversation on Data Privacy in a Rapidly Growing Connected World of Intelligent Machines"

June 1, 2015 Franz Inc.’s CEO, Dr. Jans Aasman, will participate on a panel for a "Conversation on Data Privacy in a Rapidly Growing Connected World of Intelligent Machines" being organized by the Netherlands Office for Science & Technology (NOST) June 23rd at the offices of the Consulate General of the Netherlands in San Francisco.

For everyone of us, the implications of sharing private information on social media are pretty much clear cut, be it perhaps for the lack of clarity of the user agreements and privacy statements that go with those social media. What many people donÃÂt realize is how much of our data is floating around as we use our devices, ranging from cell phones to cars. And this situation will become more complex rapidly as those devices are becoming more intelligent and interconnected. At the same time, having all this data floating around provides great opportunity, for example for diagnosing illnesses, detecting fraud and making educated infrastructure decisions. So the timing is right for having a balanced Conversation on Data Privacy. See here for additional information about the event, and here to register to attend...
