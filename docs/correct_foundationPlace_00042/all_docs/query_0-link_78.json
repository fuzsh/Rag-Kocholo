        "text": "First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley 2407 Dana St, Berkeley, CA 94704\n\nEnjoy the enchantment of musical storytelling as Berkeley Symphony presents a captivating concert bringing literature to life. Witness the West Coast premiere of Joel Puckett's orchestral song cycle, featuring the extraordinary tenor Nicholas Phan, inspired by Walt Whitman's poetic childhood account. Immerse yourself in the whimsical melodies of Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream, capturing the essence of one of Shakespeareâ€™s most revered comedies. These works are bookended by an extraordinary fusion of Langston Hughes' epic poem and Laura Karpman's interdisciplinary creation, Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz, Part 1 and Part 3, conveying a rich blend of American voices.\n\nBerkeley Symphony is excited to announce the collaboration with the Urban Jazz Dance Company to bring ASL interpretations for this entire concert, including the pre-concert chat!
