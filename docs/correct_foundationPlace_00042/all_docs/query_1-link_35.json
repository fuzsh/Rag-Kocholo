        "text": "I'm well overdue on providing an update. Stealth Startup does create a lot of curiosity. I started my own company (3PL Hub - website is not much to look at.... yet!) officially in Jan 2024, even though I incorporated in Aug 2023 and had some eCom clients outside of work hours. (BTW, I don't recommend trying to start a business in your off hours if you are a full-time sales leader and have young kids - that's another story) üêø! Hey ADHD guy.... back on topic. What am I doing? 1. I'm consulting for numerous eCommerce brands in the US & Canada. Giving logistics advice. Is your 3PL right for you? Can you use a different courier mix, reduce costs but keep service high? Do you need someone to run fulfillment, inventory and shipping analysis? Do you need an (3PL swear word incoming) RFP put together? I've completed 10 so far since January and have 8 active currently. 2. I am consulting some logistics companies, providing GTM guidance, marketing & sales advice. I still am a beachhead advisor with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise - a group of people I just adore working with Sasja Smit, Franz Klein & Angela Ferguson to name just a few. 3. I am doing some recruiting (more on that below) Why? A guy's gotta eat, oh and I love logistics. I fell into this industry back in 2012 officially, and have learned to love it like most of you, via Stockholm syndrome üòÅ While helping others via consulting, I am building product no. 1 and then product no. 2, product no. 3, and eventually product no. 4 (which is very exciting). So, there is much more to come from me in this space. I have some products that are going to make many eCom & logistics people's lives easier. Good things take time. üêø! Recruiting! Looking for a new sales role, send me a confidential DM if any of the below are interesting: - Sr. AE, eCom courier sales, fully remote based in Canada - Sr. AE, eCom fulfillment sales, fully remote, US based Looking to fill a role within a logistics organization with a talented individual? Let me know if you'd like intros to any of the following people that are looking for remote roles: - Director of Customer Service/ Director of Account Management/ Director of Sales Engineering (this person is INCREDIBLE! A lot of 3PL experience and a wonderful human being. Would be a great future VP of CS/Account Management) - Head of Partnerships (eCom fulfillment background as well as knowing their way around international courier like the back of their hand) - Enterprise Account Manager (extensive experience in eCom fulfillment & account management) - C-level WMS exec (massive WMS knowledge, product expert, pre-sales engineering, consulting. Is high-level. They have owned full company direction and P&L as a CEO, too)"
