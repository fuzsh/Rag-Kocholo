        "text": "ATLANTA, GE\n\nAlso known as “The Silicon Valley of the South”, Atlanta has gone in the past few years from being an up-and-coming tech city to becoming the Southeast’s tech capital and a top US tech hub in its own right.\n\nLong gone are the dark days of the dot-com crash, which in the late 1990s led to the implosion of early Internet companies and left Atlanta’s tech scene moribund.\n\nThe 2000s saw the city engaged in a decade-long phase of reconstruction as the telecom and networking companies of the previous era left room for a new ecosystem of tech companies dedicated to payments and financial services, cloud-based business solutions and internet security.\n\nSome of the top tech companies from Atlanta’s Renaissance include well-known success stories like MailChimp, Internet Security Systems, Pardot, AirWatch, ClearLeap, Damballa, Cardlytics, Kabbage, Calendly and Pindrop.\n\nThanks to a series of founding events like Venture Atlanta and BIP Capital, investments returned to local entrepreneurship, putting in motion a process that would turn Atlanta into the center of a hub-and-spoke network of startup cities reaching out the whole way to Birmingham, Nashville and New Orleans.\n\nTwo decades later, the results are there for everyone to see, as Atlanta is now making it consistently on the top spots of the most prestigious tech rankings.\n\nLast year, the Atlanta metro area was ranked No. 1 growing tech hub in the U.S. by CompTia for the second year in a row.\n\nThe Atlanta Tech Hub also made it at No.4 for cybersecurity and fintech, No.7 for data centers and No.8 in the rankings of global start-up ecosystems (just behind London, one of Europe’s top tech hubs, and ahead of Austin, TX).\n\nAtlanta also secured the top spot of CompTIA’s Diversity Tech Index, boasting the second-largest tech community of people of color in the nation.\n\nThere are three main reasons why the Atlanta Tech Hub’s reputation has kept rising in recent years: growth potential, diversity, and affordability.\n\nTech Jobs in Atlanta\n\nAs of 2022, 10,696 tech companies are based in Atlanta, which were responsible for 109,263 job openings last year.\n\nAlthough this was slightly down from 2020 – when 113,935 job openings were advertised – the number of new tech jobs available in Atlanta is forecasted to grow by 8% in the next five years.\n\nRecovery is already on the horizon as the overall Atlanta economy added an impressive 10,500 new jobs in July 2022 alone.\n\nWith 272,869 tech workers calling Atlanta home, nearly 1 in 10 local residents is employed in the tech industry, which accounts for 13.6% of the overall economy (CompTIA).\n\nRoughly 36% of Atlanta’s tech workforce is either Black or Hispanic – second only to San Jose.\n\nThis is a reminder that Atlanta is at least a decade ahead of America’s transformation into a majority-minority society, and the country’s top tech companies have taken notice.\n\nTechnology Companies in Atlanta\n\nRecent years have witnessed big tech companies like AirBnB, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft expanding their presence in the Atlanta area to meet their commitments to diversity and inclusion.\n\nFor example, payments giant Visa has recently opened a new office in Midtown Atlanta, and its chief diversity officer is based here.\n\nOn top of that, Apple has recently committed to investing $100m into a series of projects aimed at encouraging diversity and entrepreneurship among Atlanta’s youth.\n\nThis includes the construction of the Propel Center, a $25m educational center where students will receive training in a variety of tech areas, including artificial intelligence, agritech app development, augmented reality, design and social justice.\n\nThe hype surrounding the Atlanta Tech Hub is understandable: over the past decade, more than a dozen companies founded or based in Atlanta have grown to become unicorns, namely businesses valued at $1bn or more.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, last year the Atlanta metro area maintained its position as one of the top 10 cities in the country with Fortune 500 headquarters. Overall, 16 Atlanta-based companies made the list, including giants like Home Depot, UPS, Coca Cola, Southern, WestRock, and Delta Air Lines.\n\nBesides hosting some of the nation’s biggest tech companies, Atlanta remains a top go-to city among job seekers because of its start-up ecosystem.\n\nGrowth here is driven by an intricate network of incubators and accelerators such as the Atlantic Tech Village, a 300-strong network of startups that have created over 7,300 tech jobs and raised $1.2bn in capital funding.\n\nAtlanta’s startup ecosystem is healthy and varied, with the software and fintech sectors booming.\n\nSome of the top software companies in Atlanta are Convoy, AptAmigo, Secureworks, BetterCloud, OutSystems, Ebix, Onetrust, Mailchimp, Salesloft, Movius, and Pindrop.\n\nNotable fintech and blockchain companies based in Atlanta include Kabbage, Greenlight, RoadSync, Patientco, Bakkt, GreenSky, BitPay, Paymentus, and Reibus International.\n\nLifestyle and Cost of Living\n\nThere’s more to Atlanta than its large supply of job openings and tech establishments.\n\nLifestyle is yet another reason why tech workers are choosing to move here.\n\nThe cost of living in Atlanta is about 1% lower than the national average, with tech workers here earning a median annual wage of $88,914 (CompTIA).\n\nIn an area where the median home value rounds up at $300,000, Atlanta is a much more affordable option than leading tech hubs like San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY.\n\nAre you looking to take the next step in your career or looking to hire tech talent or set up a new office here?
