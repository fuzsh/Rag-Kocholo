No nursery, no maintenance department, just a young man and his aspirations to build and install awesome landscapes. What started as a summer job turned into one of Idaho’s most successful landscape, maintenance, and garden center companies.\n\nWhat Our Customers Are Saying\n\nStaci Woodland\n\n19:40 20 Jun 24\n\nI was surprised by the lack of help within this garden center. I have been at many others where the employees check on you, offer their assistance, and share expertise and advise on plant selection. This nursery was lacking in these areas. I purchased some roses and discovered after planting that they came from the nursery with Black Spot fungus.\n\nPaul Egert\n\n21:47 18 Jun 24\n\nWonderful experience working with Emily on our landscape design and selection of trees and bushes. Dillion and team did a excellent job on the install. I really appreciated that Emily also came out to help with the placement of the product and helped with install. I'd highly recommend Franz Witte for your gardening needs.\n\nAndy Flores\n\n00:42 13 May 24\n\nGreat greenhouse. Used to be in Boise, but is a fantastic addition to Nampa. It’s huge and lots of options.\n\nAdrienne “GreatAdi” Chaplin\n\n01:23 28 Apr 24\n\nThey seemed to have anything you'd want. Whether you're a beginner or a master gardener. The staff was really helpful to this beginner.\n\nMadison Matteo\n\n22:36 22 Apr 24\n\nUpdate the jokes !! Best part of everyone’s drive when they go past.\n\nRebecca Sullivan\n\n20:26 10 Apr 24\n\nNice job planting my five new shrubs! Excellent job by professional landscapers. The plants look very healthy. Dylan and Jess were wonderful. Thanks!\n\nronald conley\n\n21:20 25 Mar 24\n\nBeautiful with lots of stunning plants, and amazing nicknaks. A little on the high end in the price, but we still bought items!! Worth the time to stop and just wonder around.\n\nPeggy Roth\n\n02:21 03 Dec 23\n\nWent to Franz Witte for the first time today and Loved my experience. Desi and Natalia were the best at helping me with my purchases. The best customer service I've had in a long time. I'm new to the area and always look for a garden center and I found it.\n\nRandy Miller\n\n17:35 26 Nov 23\n\nLove coming here.\n\nJulie Combs\n\n21:09 29 Sep 23\n\nCarrie Hawkins\n\n04:06 17 Sep 23\n\nGrateful to Nate at Franz Witte for the expertise and education he provided us while tree shopping. Super helpful!\n\nChris Killian\n\n22:05 12 Sep 23\n\nI always find something at your beautiful store. I picked up a Pumpkin Dulce Candle and some small Ceramic Mushrooms for my house plants and a Bee bath basket with succulents. I can’t have my pollinators drowning. I was excited to have the praying mantis saying goodbye on my way out:)\n\nLuanna Rozentals\n\n01:12 04 Sep 23\n\nLovely shopping experience. Good quality plants. A little pricy though.\n\nTeena Lewis\n\n19:57 14 Aug 23\n\nGreat staff and wonderful plants\n\nLisa Storrs\n\n19:19 07 Aug 23\n\nWe recently purchased a new build home. Need less to say we were given the basics in our front and backyard. Patrick came out and worked up a design to get some life and curb appeal into our home! The crew came out and were very professional and courteous! Seeing my front and back yard come to life has been amazing! From the growth of the trees and plants to the lighting at night... Thank you Patrick and crew for may more years of enjoyment!! -Jason and Lisa\n\nCarol Lofsvold\n\n21:46 07 Jul 23\n\nEverything possible to tease your garden senses.\n\nSkeeter Meyers\n\n22:59 28 Jun 23\n\nWonderful nursery and gift shop! Knowledgeable about plants and friendly staff!\n\nBenjamin Munoz\n\n19:44 27 Jun 23\n\nFinally had a chance to stop by and check everything out! Lots of options and great stuff!!\n\nBen Hunter\n\n19:52 27 May 23\n\nThe staff at Franz Witte are so kind and helpful! My wife and I bought a magnolia tree and planned to pick it up the next day. I forgot my receipt when I came to get it and the were more than happy to look up my order to verify it. With my broken thumb I wasn’t able to load the tree in my trailer by myself, so a gentleman helped me get it out to my car and get it all loaded up. Thanks Franz Witte!\n\nJack Jensen\n\n15:38 03 May 23\n\nDylan Mick came and installed some beautiful trees at my new home. He was on time, kind, helpful, and extremely professional and thorough. He took the time to understand what I wanted done and made sure that my expectations were met with exactness. I can’t give him and his crew high enough praise. If this was on a scale on 1-10, I would give him a 20. Franz Witte has a superstar employee in Dylan and we truly appreciate the experience he gave us.\n\nPattie Waters\n\n20:01 30 Apr 23\n\nPrices a little steep but best selection of yard pottery and decor in the valley.\n\nNolan Boyle\n\n03:26 18 Feb 23\n\nI went to Far West and picked out a tree. They loaded the tree while I went in to pay. The ladies at the counter were so rude while I tried to use a voucher from Idaho Power that I eventually walked out and had them unload the tree. I then went to Franz Witte and found a much nicer and bigger tree for a lower price! The staff was friendly and excellent with no issues using the Idaho Power voucher.\n\nNorthern Star HOA Management\n\n20:51 09 Nov 22\n\nThe Franz Witte commercial team handles the landscaping maintenance for several subdivisions we manage. Our rep, Sydney G, has been awesome to work with. We also love working with Joe G. They are both responsive and their customer service is great! Thanks Franz Witte team for a great landscaping season - we look forward to another great year working with you to take care of the subdivisions we manage.\n\nTracy Krylo\n\n21:49 10 Oct 22\n\nUPDATE: 10/10/22 Today I spoke with Jeffery (sorry if I'm misspelling your name) and she was wonderful. She was able to honor the website flyer and I got my cute yard art. She even helped us pick out another plant for your yard. She went over and beyond and was so very gracious. We love the selection there and will be adding more plants to our yard soon.10/8/22 Today was the first day I was disappointed after visiting Franz Witte. I went with the purpose of buying a piece of yard art I had seen because their flyer and website said all non metal yard art was 40% off. When I was there I was told it didn't include the one I wanted. The flyer and website said nothing about any exclusions so I felt they should have honored the advertisement. I notice now the non metal yard art has been removed from the website and the flyers were thrown away when I was there.\n\nKathy Henderson\n\n16:16 13 Aug 22\n\nWorth the drive just for the home and garden decor and smelly good soaps, lotions and candles. And I give them 10 stars for preserving that fabulous barn and the 2 silos. ❤️\n\nNancy Barrick\n\n05:01 12 Jul 22\n\nLove this store! The selection of plants along with fun decorative items is amazing! The staff is very helpful\n\nBird Fleck\n\n00:21 07 Apr 22\n\nStaff was really nice and showed me around a bit. They do seasonal plants and they have cold weather plants right now. They do have classes which seems really cool. They didn't have many herbs and that's why I gave 4 stars. I was hoping there would be more options. Pretty gift shop and they had a lot of pots and garden decorations.\n\nMichelle T\n\n22:25 30 Oct 21\n\nLove the tranquil space, fun decor, and friendly staff. I’ve bought many plants and supplies here, and always leave with a dirty chai latte w/ vanilla in my hand from the coffee truck. I have unfortunately had issues with pests in 3 of the plants I bought there, so I have to remember to inspect the plants VERY thoroughly before buying and quarantine an extra long time just to be safe. I wish they would do more to control pests, particularly for their indoor plant selection. But besides that issue, I love this place and will continue going often for everything it has to offer, even if I have to take my magnifying glass with me.\n\nNancy\n\n19:34 04 Oct 21\n\nWOW !!! I am Not from here but travel from out of state to visit my Sister in Meridian. She brought me here a couple of months ago and I just had to come back ! This is the most Amazing Nursery I have been to ! I love how they kept the Silos and other buildings when purchasing this ranch. There is such a positive energy that flows around here. The plants are very unique and gorgeous. Same with the displays. I fell in love with the Metal Iron Birds for Sale . The Gift Shop is such a pleasure to browse in !On my next visit I plan on going to their Store in McCall . Plan on taking time to browse through here!\n\nKim Huska\n\n23:19 11 Sep 21\n\nBeautiful set up. Plants & shrubs easy to find. The employees were very helpful and outgoing. Finn is very knowledgeable. Have us some awesome suggestions.\n\nMichael Hunt\n\n20:10 27 Jul 21\n\nStopped in looking for a bonsai plant for a gift. Found one which we had repotted. Turned out well. Walked around looking at the abundance of trees and plants. Very pretty setup which is expanding.\n\nMaryalice Pfeiffer\n\n22:17 25 May 21\n\nI recently visited their new location.. it is absolutely gorgeous. The staff acknowledged me right away and offered any help I could want but also made me feel free to just browse and enjoy the new nursery. Well it is way more than a nursery. A lot of gift items.
