Each Fisher House is between 7 and 21 suites and can accommodate 16 to 42 family members. They feature a spacious common kitchen, laundry facilities, spacious dining room and a living room with a library and toys for children. Newer houses are 100% wheelchair accessible and include elevators. A Fisher House is a temporary residence and is not a treatment facility, hospice, or counseling center.\n\nDownload House Directory"
