        "text": "I. Interested in Submitting a Request for Federal Funding? The Time is Now!\n\nBoth the House and Senate have released final guidelines for “earmarks” in the 2024 government funding process. Nonprofit organizations and state and local governments interested in submitting requests for funding have a short window in which to develop and submit requests to their Members of Congress for consideration.\n\nWe encourage requestors to review our full program guidance. This companion document includes deadlines and sample timelines for this year, and some changes to the programs.\n\nBack to top\n\nII. FY24 Process at a Glance\n\nTiming\n\nThis process is for funding to be made available in the 2024 fiscal year. The exact timing of when funds are released to successful applicants will depend on Congress and the agency involved.\n\nUncertainty\n\nThis year’s process has significantly more uncertainty than previous years: the House and Senate have different rules (more on that below), and those differences will have to be worked out before funding bills can be passed.\n\nHouse vs. Senate\n\nThe House and Senate have different open subject areas for requests. See below for more information.\n\nMarch 10\n\nMost requests must be submitted by March 10th.\n\nBack to top\n\nIV. How to Submit an Earmark Request\n\nInterested in submitting a request? Here’s your to-do list for the next week:\n\n✅ If you have not already, identify your Members of Congress and review their websites (or call their DC offices) to see if they are accepting requests for Community Project Funding in the House or Congressionally Directed Spending in the Senate. Your Member may also provide additional guidance or opportunities to ask questions.\n\n✅ Review the list of Eligible Accounts for FY24 and determine which may be good fits for your project.\n\n✅ For requests through the House, start gathering evidence of community support (for more information, see our full DIY Earmarks guide).\n\n✅ Prepare your request form.\n\n✅ Prepare any materials your Member’s office may need to review with your request (for example, nonprofits should be ready to provide copies of their nonprofit status paperwork and 990s).\n\n✅ March 10th: be prepared to submit your request for funding. Deadlines will vary by office, with a large number requiring requests by March 10th.\n\nBack to top"
