Introduction As the network has grown, along with it there has been an increase in the number of software tools and applications to navigate the network and make use of the many, varied resources which are part of the network. Within the past two and a half years we have seen a widespread adoption of tools such as the archie servers, the Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS), the Internet gopher, and the Worldwide Web (WWW). In addition to the acceptance of these tools there are also diverse efforts to enhance and customise these tools to meet the needs of particular network communities. There are many organisations and associations that are focusing on the proliferating resources and tools for networked information retrieval (NIR). The Networked Information Retrieval Group is a cooperative effort of three major players in the field of NIR: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Association of European Research Networks (RARE) and the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI), specifically tasked to collect and disseminate information about the tools and to discuss and encourage cooperative development of current and future tools. The purpose of this report is to increase the awareness of NIR by bringing together in one place information about the various networked information retrieval tools, their developers, interested organisations, and other activities that relate to the production, dissemination, and support of NIR tools. The intention is to make this a \"living document\". It will be held on-line so that each section may be updated separately as appropriate. In addition, it is intended that the full document will be updated once a year so that it provides a \"snapshot\" report on activities in this area. Whilst the NIR tools in this report are being used on a wide variety of information sources including files and databases there remains much that is currently not accessible by these means. On the other hand, the majority of the NIR Tools described here are freely available to the networked Research and Education community. Tools for accessing specialised datasets are often only available at a cost. It should be noted that in many ways networked information retrieval is in its infancy compared with traditional information retrieval systems. Thesaurus construction, boolean searching and classification control are issues which are under discussion for the popular NIR Tools but as yet are not in widespread use. However it should be said that, with the vast amount of effort that is currently going into the NIR field, rapid progress is being made. Much work is currently being done on expanding some of the NIR tools to include Foster [Page 2] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 handling of multimedia information services. Progress has also been made in the discussions on classifying and cataloguing electronic information resources. 2. How the information was collected The information contained in this report was collected over the network from the contacts for each NIR Tool or Group using two templates: - the NIR Tool Template, included in Appendix A; - the NIR Group Template, included in Appendix B. The contents of these templates were discussed by the NIR WG in Boston (July, 1992) and subsequently on the email list. (See the Section on the NIR-WG for details of how to join this mailing list.) The initial draft report was discussed at the NIR Working Group in Washington (November, 1992) and updated and added to at subsequent WG meetings. Before the final submission as an RFC the individual templates were reviewed by independent reviewers from around the world. Their efforts are acknowledged in Section 9. The NIR Tool template was used to collect the information necessary to identify and track the development of networked information retrieval tools. This template asked for information such as how and where to get the software for each NIR Tool, documentation, demonstration sites, etc. The main part of the template has been completed by the main individual responsible for the tool. Sections of the template (e.g., on clients) may have required completion by others. The NIR Group template requested information on the aim and purpose of the group, the current tasks being undertaken, mailing lists, document archives, etc. 3. What is covered?

Overview of the types of NIR Tools The following is an overview of major networked information retrieval (NIR) tools available on the Internet. There are many excellent books which discuss the Internet and NIR Tools in detail. Such books include \"The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog\" by Ed Krol and published by O'Reilly and Associates, Inc and \"The Internet Guide for New Users\" by Daniel Dearn and published by Meckler. The number of these NIR tools is large and growing quickly. Certain techniques reappear regularly and seemingly different tools may perform similar tasks, allowing a simple classification of projects encompassing most of the existing tools and services. Foster [Page 5] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 The classification presented here is only one possible ordering. The goal is to define in broad outlines what can be done with particular tools, realizing that users will always find novel unanticipated ways of applying them. Interactive Information Delivery Services (Gopher, World Wide Web) Basic Internet services such as electronic mail and anonymous FTP can be used to share information across the Internet, but neither allows simple browsing and neither is particularly easy for the newcomer to learn to use. Gopher and the World Wide Web (W3) are two recent developments that attempt to make it easier to distribute information over the Internet. Both allow the user to browse information across the network without the necessity of logging in or knowing in advance where to look for information. The Gopher project was first developed at the University of Minnesota to provide a simple campus-wide on-line information system. Gopher represents information as a simple hierarchy of menus and files. It has limited capability to recognize different types of files, allowing, for example, the display of selected types of image files. Gateways to other services are provided (usually in a manner that is transparent to the user). The underlying Gopher protocol is simple, and has facilitated the creation of freely available clients for use on a variety of hardware platforms and operating systems. The more recent Gopher+ protocol adds the ability to provide documents in alternate forms (PDF, PostScript, RTF, Word). These features and the ease of installing and administering gopher servers has led to an explosive growth of gopher sites since its initial deployment. As of November 1993, there were over 2200 known servers. World Wide Web relies on hypertext; formatted documents are displayed, and hypertext links within the document can be selected to travel from the current document to another. W3 allows a user to annotate documents (using hypertext links), provides gateways to other services, and has multimedia support (for example, on appropriate hardware platforms it can intermix text and images in a displayed document). There is a range of free W3 clients, supporting many environments. World Wide Web was originally developed at CERN for the High Energy Physics Community. Gopher and WWW share a maintenance problem in that there is no automated way to update links to other documents when those documents are moved or removed. Foster [Page 6] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 Directory Services (WHOIS, X.500) Directory Service tools are intended to provide a lookup service for locating information about users (often referred to as White Pages), or services and service providers (Yellow Pages). For example, a White Pages service might be used to locate an electronic mail address, given a name and organization, while a Yellow Pages service could be used to locate an online library catalog or file archive site. One of the first directory services deployed on the Internet was WHOIS, a simple White Pages service created to track key network contacts for the early DARPA-sponsored incarnation of the Internet. A number of sites currently operate WHOIS servers, based on a range of extensions and enhancements to the original model. WHOIS enjoys the advantages of simplicity and the presence of WHOIS client software on a preponderance of Internet-connected hosts. Work is underway on a more powerful protocol, known as WHOIS++, which is backwards-compatible with WHOIS. The X.500 Directory Service is a much more ambitious Directory project that has been under development for a number of years under the aegis of ISO/OSI. Implementations, concerned primarily with White pages services, are available in the public domain and from commercial sources. There are LDAP based X.500 clients available for most major platforms, as well as a LDAP based gopher gateway to X.500. Despite years of effort, there is still no single White Pages Directory Service for the entire Internet; Yellow Pages services remain even less well developed and deployed. The cost of setting up the service is one obstacle; maintaining the required databases is even more daunting. Indexing Services (archie, Veronica, online library catalogs) There are several Internet-based projects that build indexed catalogs of information to facilitate searching and retrieval. The first such services provided network access to library card catalogs, with more recent projects indexing network-based information. archie: The archie service began as a simple project to catalog the contents of hundreds of ftp-accessible online file archives. The archie service gathers location information, name, and other details describing such files and creates an index database. Foster [Page 7] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 Users can contact an archie server and search this database for files they require. The archie service is accessible through a range of access methods, including telnet, stand-alone client programs running on a user's own machine, gopher, WWW, or via electronic mail. The initial implementation of archie tracks over 2,100,000 filenames on over 1,200 sites around the world (as of November 1993). There are about 30 (geographically distributed) archie servers. Both commercial and freely available versions of the archie client software are available. Work continues on extending the archie service to provide additional types of information. The latest version is being used to provide a prototype Yellow Pages service and directories of online library catalogs and electronic mailing lists. Veronica: Veronica arose as an attempt to do for the world of Gopher what archie did for the world of ftp. A central server periodically scans the complete menu hierarchies of Gopher servers appearing on an ever-expanding list (over 2000 sites as of November 1993). The resulting index is provided by a veronica server and can be accessed by any gopher client. Online library catalogs: A large number of libraries make their computerized library catalogs available over the Internet. Most are available through telnet sessions in which the user connects to a specific address and logs in using a specific login name. Some are also available through other tools, such as Gopher. Text-based Indexing Services (WAIS) WAIS: Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) is a system for indexing and serving information in a network-based environment. It is distinct from indexing tools such as archie and veronica in that it is used to index text-based target documents on a server, as well as descriptions of the contents of a server. A WAIS server allows the administrator to set up an index of the documents (or resources) to be published. The user employs a WAIS client to attach to a particular WAIS server, and specifies a search pattern which is matched against the server's index. In Foster [Page 8] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 early WAIS clients, searches are specified as simple natural- language queries; common (\"stop\") words are removed, and Boolean \"ORs\" are implicitly added between the remaining list of words. Matching documents are rank-ordered according to a simple statistical weighting scheme which attempts to indicate likely relevance. The user may choose to view selected documents, or further refine the search. The results of one search may be used to successively refine future searches (\"relevance feedback\"). Gopher clients can also access WAIS servers via a transparent gateway. Both freely available and commercial versions of WAIS servers and clients are available. Current work is attempting to add Boolean expressions and proximity and field specifications to queries. There are currently (as of November 1993) some 500 registered WAIS databases with an estimated 2000 additional databases that are not yet registered. There are approximately another 100 commercial WAIS databases. 6. NIR Tools This section contains detailed information about the various NIR Tools. It is ordered alphabetically. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= ALEX Date template updated or checked: 19th March, 1994 By: Name: Vincent Cate Email address: vac@cs.cmu.edu ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NIR Tool Name: Alex Brief Description of Tool: OVERVIEW: The Alex filesystem provides users and applications transparent read access to files in anonymous FTP sites on the Internet. Today there are thousands of anonymous FTP sites with a total of a few millions of files and roughly a terabyte of data. The standard approach to accessing these files involves logging in to the remote machine. This means that an application can not access remote files like local files. This also means that users do not Foster [Page 9] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 have any of their aliases or local tools available. Users who want to use an application on a remote file first have to manually make a local copy of the file. There is no mechanism for automatically updating this local copy when the remote file changes. The users must keep track of where they get their files from and check to see if there are updates, and then fetch these. In this approach many different users at the same site may have made copies of the same remote file each using up disk space for the same data. Alex addresses the problems with the existing approach while remaining within the existing FTP protocol so that the large collection of currently available files can be used. To get reasonable performance long term file caching is used. Thus consistency is an issue. Traditional solutions to the cache consistency problem do not work in the Internet FTP domain: callbacks are not an option as the FTP protocol has no provisions for this and polling over the Internet is slow. Therefore, Alex relaxes file cache consistency semantics, on a per file basis, and uses special caching algorithms that take into account the properties of the files and of the network to allow a simple stateless filesystem to scale to the size of the Internet. USER'S VIEW: To a user or application, Alex is just a normal filesystem. Any command that works on local files will work on Alex files. Since Alex is a real filesystem, nothing needs to be recompiled and no libraries are changed. Thus, users can apply all of their existing skills and tools for using files. The user sees a filesystem with a hierarchical name space. At the top level (/alex) there are top-level Internet domains like \"edu\", \"com\", \"uk\", and \"jp\". Each component of the hostname becomes a directory name. Then the remote path is added at the end. If the user does a \"ls /alex/edu/berkeley\" he sees some machine names such as \"ucbvax\" and \"sprite\" and some directories on berkeley.edu. From the \"ls\" it is not clear what is where. The user may or may not be aware of host boundaries. INFORMATION PROVIDER'S VIEW: Alex is implemented as a user level NFS server. NFS was chosen because it makes it easy to add Alex to a wide range of machines. Most machines can simply use the mount command. Foster [Page 10] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 The model of usage is that there is one Alex server running at each institution (though this is not required in any way). Users mount the local server which caches files for users at that site. Any information put into any anonymous FTP site becomes available via Alex. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Contact(s): Name: Vincent Cate Email address: vac@cs.cmu.edu Postal Address: School of Computer Science 5000 Forbes Ave. Pittsburgh PA, 15213 Telephone: +1-412-268-3077 Fax: +1-412-681-1998 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Help Line: At this time Alex is a one person project (Vince). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Related Working Groups: Maybe the FTP working group. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sponsoring Organization / Funding source: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Information Science and Technology Office, under the title \"Research on Parallel Computing,\" ARPA Order No. 7330.

The current version serves a collection of filenames found at anonymous FTP sites, as well as a smaller collection of text descriptions for software, data and other information found at anonymous FTP archives. Additional databases are under development. User's View: Users run a client program to connect to an archie server and issue search commands to find information in an archie database. In the case of an anonymous FTP filename, this information can then be used to fetch the file directly from the archive site using the `ftp' command. To the user, archie could be seen as a `secondary source' of information which, because of the high cost of locating and serving, would not otherwise be available. The user searches the archie databases through either a telnet session to a machine running an archie server, or by using a stand-alone client program (which uses the Prospero protocol for sending and receiving requests). There is also an email interface which allows users to send and receive search requests via electronic mail. Freely available archie clients exist for most operating systems and can be fetched using anonymous FTP from most of the current archie servers. There are also gateways to the archie system from many other NIR tools, including Gopher, WAIS and WWW. An X.500 interface to archie is currently under development. Information Provider's View: There are two types of information providers who would be interested in archie. Primary information providers are interested in having a summary of the information provided by their service tracked by an archie server. Secondary service Foster [Page 15] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 providers, or those sites wishing to provide a \"value-added\" service for the Internet can elect to run an archie server at their site to provide a useful service to users, to raise the profile of their institution on the Internet, or to provide market differentiation (for commercial service providers). The archie system is of particular utility serving information where there are many sites to be searched and/or where the cost of searching each site is high. For example, there are currently over 1,200 anonymous FTP sites on the Internet, and the number continues to grow. Searching for a specific filename at a single site may involve scanning hundreds, or even thousands of filenames. Thus, most operators of anonymous FTP archives welcome the fact that archie indexes and serves the names of all files available from each site tracked. Information Types Supported: The archie system allows the gathering and serving of arbitrary information types, although the current system serves only freeform text and a dedicated text format for filename listings. Internally, the archie system now supports a WAIS search engine and frontends for Gopher, WWW and WHOIS++ for accessing archie information through Gopher clients is now being tested. Additional collections of information to be served by the archie software will be announced. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Contact(s): Name: Archie Group, Bunyip Information Systems Inc.

Archive: not known ------------------- Name: alt.internet.services Description: This newsgroup is for people interested in Internet-related services, with a focus at the user level. Announcements and discussions of issues related to archie are presented here, as well as discussions of more general issues relating to Internet services. Archive: not known ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Protocols: What is supported: The current archie system clients use the Prospero protocol for communication with the search engine on the archie server. Freely available clients are available which include source to perform this communication for those wishing to implement additional clients. The archie server is capable of building arbitrary databases, using arbitrary search and access engines and the current release ships with the public domain implementation of WAIS. We expect future archie servers to serve information using this protocol. The current server system assumes the TCP/IP protocol suite is available, and in particular the ftp protocol for data gathering. The archie system can be accessed through systems operating the Gopher, WAIS and WWW (HDDL) protocols. A gateway from the X.500 system is under development. Foster [Page 19] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 What it runs over: The Prospero protocol implementation runs over its own implementation of a reliable datagram protocol based upon UDP. Data gathering runs over the TCP/IP protocol suite. Other NIR tools this interworks with: Prospero, Gopher, WAIS, WWW. Future plans: The archie system became a commercial product in October, 1992, marketed by Bunyip Information Systems Inc.

McCahill Email address: mpm@boombox.micro.umn.edu ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NIR Tool Name: Internet Gopher Brief Description of Tool: The Internet Gopher protocol is a client/distributed-server document search and retrieval protocol originally developed at the University of Minnesota. Gopher was originally created as a fast, simple, distributed, campus-wide information search and retrieval system; ease of use and implementation has made Gopher increasingly popular on the Internet. Since its original release, many folks on the Internet have contributed to its growth, submitting patches, servers, clients, and linking their local servers into the worldwide network of Gopher servers. Gateways exist to seamlessly access a variety of non-Gopher services such as ftp, WAIS, USENET news, Archie, Z39.50 (1992 rev), X.500 directories, Sybase and Oracle SQL servers, etc. In addition, an \"archie for gopherspace\" called Veronica (very easy rodent-oriented net-wide index to computerized archives) has been developed at the University of Nevada. Veronica makes it easy to search for items in gopherspace by title. The gopher protocol is often described as \"fiercely simple\"; it is connectionless (stateless), and uses TCP reliable streams. A client connects to a server using TCP, and sends a one-line text \"selector string\". The server responds by returning the item (a file, a directory listing, or a link to some other service) corresponding to the selector string and immediately closing the connection. Items in directory listings are returned as a series of lines terminated by carriage-return line-feed. Each item (line) is defined by a one- character tag to specify the item type, a display string or item-name that the client should display to the user, and a number of tab delimited fields to specify the selector string, host domain name and port number. Because of its simple and connectionless nature, gopher servers make very minimal demands on their host machines and gopher clients are extremely easy to implement. The users view the Gopher world as a series of networked hierarchical directories much like a familiar filesystem. However, the links define a graph rather than a simple rooted tree. Links in the Gopher graph may define services other than simple files or directories; these include cso (qi) servers, telnet sessions, links to other Foster [Page 27] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 gopher servers, and links to gateway servers. The information provider's simplest view is that files and directories below a certain root directory on their machine are all visible and available for retrieval by gopher clients. More features like long names, item types, links, and gateway services are available to the more sophisticated information provider. Servers and clients run on most popular hardware, including Macs, UNIX boxes, PC-DOS boxes. The Internet Gopher name is copyright (c) 1991-1992 by the University of Minnesota. The Internet Gopher protocol is described in an informational RFC (1436) available at better RFC archives everywhere. Extensions to the base gopher protocol allow for associating meta-information with gopher items, alternate views of documents (i.e., text, postscript, rtf, etc.) and electronic forms. Collectively, these extensions are referred to as Gopher+. Gopher+ is upward compatible with the orginal gopher protocol. The gopher software may be retrieved from numerous Gopher or FTP archive sites, including the University of Minnesota Gopher server, the Info-Mac Archive Gopher server, and by anonymous FTP from boombox.micro.umn.edu and sumex-aim.stanford.edu. As of December 1993, about 1/3 of the approximately 4800 Gopher servers on the internet support Gopher+. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Contact(s): Name: The Internet Gopher Development Team Email address: gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu Postal Address: Microcomputer & Workstation Networks Center 152 Shepherd Labs 100 Union Street SE.

People can be specified by first, last, or login name. Their place of work can be described by name and/or the city/state/country. Netfind provides textual information about people, when it is able to locate such information. It is not a directory in the usual sense of the word. Rather, it searches for people using a number of Internet services and heuristics about how to locate user information. Because of the techniques it uses, Netfind can locate information about more people than any other Internet user directory - over 5 million people in over 9,000 domains worldwide when last measured. You can use the University of Colorado Netfind server by telnet to bruno.cs.colorado.edu: login as \"netfind\" (with no password). Help screens providing more detailed instructions and technical information are available there.

It can be used to organize references to files as if they were on your local system, without the need to physically move them. Prospero provides access to existing directories and indices that can be used to find files of interest that are available from Internet archive sites. Among the indices available is the archie database and a gateway to all Gopher menus, files, and searches. We hope to have WAIS indices and World Wide Web documents online in the near future. Prospero also provides a mechanism to make directories and indices available to end-users and applications in a format that allows information from different sources to be integrated into a coherent whole. Prospero does not interpret the data that it organizes. It does provide mechanisms to retrieve the data, but the display and use of the data is up to the user's application. Prospero is intended to serve as infrastructure that integrates information from a variety of sources and supports a variety of user applications. Prospero allows fine grained authorization of requests to all objects, including directories and indices. Prospero supports the authentication of clients through four mechanisms: (a) simple client assertion of the user's identity; (b) a trusted port mechanism similar to that used by the Berkeley UNIX R commands; (c) a simple cleartext passwording mechanism; (d) Kerberos (version 5). The maintainer of an ACL chooses which of these mechanisms he or she wishes to accept as proof of the client's identity. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Contact(s): Foster [Page 63] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 Name: Info Prospero (preferred contact address) Email address: info-prospero@isi.edu -------------------------- Name: Clifford Neuman Email address: bcn@isi.edu Postal Address: U.S.C.

Note that the name prospero.tar.Z refers to the most stable release (currently Beta version 5.1). If you want the latest version of the server (which includes the Gopher gateway), you should retrieve it by version number; the name for the latest version is prospero-alpha.5.2.tar.Z Location of more information: Contained within the release. Latest version number: Alpha Version 5.3 Brief Scope and Characteristics: The server allows the maintainer to make directory information available about selected portions of the server's filesystem, such as anonymously FTPable files. The server also is used to publish information from other databases, such as Archie. The server also allows users and maintainers to store their own customized organizing views of the namespace. Release Alpha.5.2 of the server includes a gateway feature which treats all Gopher servers as a Prospero database. Approximate number of such servers in use: 50 General comments: Future plans: We have a prototype NFS server that makes Prospero queries, but it is not yet ready to release. We plan to develop a gateway similar to the existing Gopher gateway feature for World Wide Web. There is also active work being done on exporting WAIS indices through Prospero in a way similar to the way the archie database is exported. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Clients: Date completed or updated: 1st November, 1993 Platform: UNIX Foster [Page 67] RFC 1689 Networked Information Retrieval: Tools and Groups August 1994 Primary Contact Name: Clifford Neuman and Steven Augart Email address: info-prospero@isi.edu Telephone: +1-310-822-1511 Client software available from: Via anonymous FTP: PROSPERO.ISI.EDU, /pub/prospero/prospero.tar.Z Via Prospero: /releases/prospero/prospero.tar.Z, in the \"#/INET/EDU/ISI/swa\" virtual system. Note that the name prospero.tar.Z refers to the most stable release (currently Beta version 5.1). If you want the latest version of the clients (which includes the Prospero menu browser), you should retrieve it by version number; the name for the latest version is prospero-alpha.5.2.tar.Z Latest Version number: Alpha Version 5.2 Brief Scope and Characteristics: We provide two client interfaces. The older one is a command-line client, which can be configured to use the same syntax to navigate through the Prospero namespace that a user uses to navigate through the UNIX filesystem. (\"cd\", \"ls\", etc.) The newer one is a menu- based file and directory browser similar to the UNIX Gopher client. General comments: Archie clients also make queries in the Prospero namespace, so all Archie clients are Prospero clients too. They are better described in the Archie report. Future plans: We are working on enhancing the menu browser client to allow users to remotely customize and update virtual systems. We plan to develop a Prospero hypertext browser. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Demonstration sites: A guest virtual system is available on PROSPERO.ISI.EDU. However, to use it, you must compile the Prospero command-line client on your own machine. Instructions for using it come with the Prospero distribution.
