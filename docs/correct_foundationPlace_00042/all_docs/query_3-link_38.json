        "text": "‘When I was 24 years old, I was hired as a model by a sportswear company located near my house; it was a leading company in the global ski and tennis sector. I used to always dress well, read fashion magazines and stay updated on the latest trends. In this way, I gradually moved towards the future and at the age of 25, I made my decision: I wanted to make colored cashmere sweaters, only for women, in line with contemporary style. I had the impression that it was a very innovative idea. I was firmly convinced of the idea of producing high-quality garments that reflected Italian craftsmanship and manual skills, items that were certainly expensive but not excessively so, designed for a market segment called “absolute luxury”. I’ve always believed that to do something special you have to focus on a single project that is your lifelong dream.\n\nI still hold dear the memory of that good man and great professional whom I asked to sell me about twenty kilograms of ecru-colored cashmere yarn, a sufficient amount to make about sixty sweaters. With a fatherly gesture, he told me that he would have certainly sold them to me, then he said something that still moves me deeply, “You’ll pay me when you earn your first money. I know you, you’re a good young man”. Unfortunately, he suffered a serious illness in early old age and I didn’t have the chance to thank him as much as I would have liked.\n\nA special moment was when I went to a dyeing plant and met Alessio for the first time, perhaps one of the greatest experts in cashmere dyeing. I brought him six women’s cashmere sweaters and I asked him to dye them in six different colors, which were not too bright, however. At first his sharp reply was, “You’re crazy to dye cashmere in these colors”. For most of the morning I tried to convince him in every way, begging him to do as I asked. In the end he told me, “Let’s give it a try, but I can’t guarantee the result”. This was undoubtedly the most important moment in my life. I owe a lot to this man: a joker, an idealist, a dreamer who was very devoted to his roots.\n\nI had read in a specialized magazine that in Trentino Alto Adige customers ordered and paid in a timely manner like nowhere else in Italy. I set off on my journey right away, and my first customer was Albert Franz from a beautiful little town near Bolzano called Naturno, who was the owner of a boutique and who is still a customer of ours today. Mister Albert was a strong man, who was more or less my dad’s age and had a beautiful family. His behavior was exemplary from the start: professional, accurate, rigorous and humane. There was affinity between us, as well as esteem, so we started working together. Without any doubt I will always remember in my heart his first order for fifty-three cashmere sweaters.\n\nI also hold loving memories of Vincenzo, one of my first customers who lived and worked in Milan. He used to talk to me about Puglia, his homeland, about his tormented arrival in Lombardy, about living in a wooden shack until it was knocked down by the strong winds, an episode that was so unbelievable that it ended up in the newspapers. I used to listen to him, drawn by the charisma of a good soul: his words flowed smoothly. One day, he made a very significant order and said to me, “This is the money, I want you to use it for your business”; it was a lot of money, I was speechless: to understand my state of mind just think about those tough early years and the little amount of money that I managed back then. Instinctively, regardless of my own personal interest, I asked him what guarantees he thought I could give him, since I had no money or possessions. With a benevolent smile on his face, he told me, “I have five brothers, and with me it makes six, and then there’s my father and my mother; and we all believe in your entrepreneurial and moral skills, we believe in you. This is enough for us; so don’t worry about the money, just keep your head down and work without worries, and that’s all”. That type of situation really unleashed my skills and made me want to surpass myself. And that’s what I did.\n\nI believed in creating valuable items without causing any harm to Creation, or as little as possible. I imagined products that could be just as gratifying for the wearers as they were for the workers who made them, I imagined people working in a beautiful workplace: a place where workers had pleasant and relaxing breaks, where the artisanal dimension reigned supreme. I wanted human relations to respect humanity and truth, and wages to be sufficient to live a dignified and serene life. The working atmosphere that I imagined was a peaceful one where creativity could be unleashed. I imagined making profit, indeed, but based on ethics, dignity and morality, trying to give form to the fascinating relationship between “profit and giving back” that made me feel, in my own small way, as a custodian of Creation.\n\nWhen the right time came, Federica and I decided to get married and go live at her house in Solomeo. During those early years, my successes were only limited but they seemed extraordinary to me. I started thinking about moving my tiny factory, which back then was located in the suburbs of Perugia, to new headquarters. And Solomeo came to my mind; I couldn’t stand seeing this small ancient hamlet so degraded and neglected and one day, instinctively, I thought I’d try to purchase the tower and medieval castle. I was enchanted by those buildings, which bore the marks of their long history, they seemed eternal to me, the perfect headquarters for my small company, right in the heart of this picturesque medieval settlement.\n\nOne of the circumstances that, among those that happened to me, best symbolizes the sense of life were the touching negotiations for the purchase of the Solomeo castle. At the time I was still a young man, and in front of me was the owner of the castle, a man whom I had heard was a very amiable person but very firm and unyielding in his convictions. Mine, after all, was an almost desperate attempt. Unexpectedly, the meeting had a magic effect, it uncovered a kindness of spirit that we had in common, shared feelings and desires. It took great and sincere efforts, but in the end, when the owner understood that I wanted to preserve the castle in its entirety and turn it, over time, into a place for the benefit of humanity, he agreed to sell it. My dreams were his dreams; they were big, visionary dreams. Perhaps he saw in me someone who could pursue something that he could no longer pursue because he didn’t have the strength or the time to pursue it, and he cared about me.\n\nIt was one of the first times I experienced the tangible importance of dialogue, and the fruits borne from speaking in a straightforward and honest way and from sharing key values: human respect, custodianship, preserving traditions, industrial product quality. People must not only be respected in form, but most importantly in substance. As I said, I believed that people should work in special workplaces as close to nature as possible. I believe it is useful to pass on humanistic values, such as the family, spirituality, craftsmanship and agriculture, because in them lie the roots of the future.\n\nConfucius thought that restoring ancient rituals and using proper language were essential to favor the progress of humanity. He used to say, “I transmit, but I don’t create”. So it is not about nostalgia for the past, it is about authentic values in which we find all the answers we are looking for in order to shape our future. That is why I have always felt like a sort of guardian, like a \"ferryman\" between the past and the future, even to this day.\n\nThen came a time when I had to start thinking about how I wanted to communicate my idea of industry and its values: the little advertising we did in fashion magazines focused on themes representing Italian culture, village life, dignity, respect, education, kindness and the value of the custodianship of places. In May 1996, we released a photo depicting father Gualtiero – a Franciscan friar, who was a dear friend of mine –, model Letizia and I, while looking at some ancient books belonging to the priceless library contained in the Franciscan monastery of Monteripido, near Perugia. We came up with a beautiful caption expressing the positive atmosphere of the moment, a real dream for that year. It read, “We need a new Humanism”.\n\nIn the small hamlet, restoration works were completed. The quality of life of its inhabitants seemed amiable to us, in the medieval castle people worked in a pleasant and friendly working environment. We thought it was normal to have no difference in remuneration between blue-collar and white-collar workers, we thought it was fair to have slightly higher than average wages or even a bit higher for those with artisanal skills. We used to hold assemblies every three months to talk about everything, from more general company issues down to the smallest detail. Every single aspect, no matter how minimal, was analyzed. For example, we gave great importance to lunch breaks in the company’s restaurant, which serves traditional Umbrian dishes. In the morning, the working day started at 8:00 A.M. for everybody. Nobody had to clock in or out. In the evening, the working day ended at 5:30P.M. These are fair concepts, in my opinion, universally sound ones.\n\nThen the first important interviews started with international publications that were curious about what was happening in that small and until then little known Umbrian town: how could people work well in a medieval hamlet? How could this ancient castle be more efficient than a functional and cutting-edge facility? The Internet was still far from its current development and people thought we were pretty isolated, because today’s economy requires real-time connections. The building had many internal stairs, small rooms, and its walls were inalterable because many of them were decorated with frescoes. Actually, the workplace worked perfectly and, although it was unsuited for the hasty pace of modern times, it was suited in the spirit, and that’s what mattered most."
