        "text": "We’re excited to announce that Fortinet has received the prestigious Red Dot Product Design Award for our FortiGate Rugged 70G with Dual 5G Modems next-generation firewall (NGFW). This award recognizes products with exceptional design and underscores Fortinet’s commitment to excellence in product engineering that enables its industry-leading technology to support even the most space-constrained and extreme operational technology (OT) environments.\n\nFortinet is the only cybersecurity company to receive this award for an industrial NGFW. This feature-packed appliance includes industry-leading, high-performance threat protection and the added functionality of dual 5G modems to enable high-availability for mission-critical networks. It is designed to operate in environments subject to extreme temperatures, dust, vibration, and shock to support industrial locations and protect critical manufacturing and infrastructure from cyber threats. At the same time, its compact DIN-rail mount and fan-less design provide an intricate balance of industrial design and security functionality.\n\nFortiGate NGFWs are specially designed to converge networking and security with unified management to simplify cybersecurity for OT infrastructure and enable secure connectivity to enterprise IT and wide-area networks. They deliver enhanced secure networking capabilities, high availability 5G connectivity, and private 5G integration for OT environments while supporting OT-specific applications and communication protocols.\n\nBacked by the latest fifth-generation Fortinet security processing unit, the FortiGate Rugged 70G with Dual 5G Modems leverages FortiGuard AI-Powered Security Services and delivers high availability through dual 5G cellular modems. Designed to operate in remote environments, this rugged appliance is packed with cybersecurity features that can securely connect everything from electrical substations to autonomous fleets.\n\nAll FortiGate Rugged NGFWs run on the FortiOS operating system. FortiOS supports comprehensive critical security and networking functions—including OT-specific features—enabling it to serve as the foundation of the Fortinet Security Fabric. As an OT Security Platform, they are uniquely able to meet the demands of a wide range of industrial applications and protocols, supporting more than 80 industrial protocols to secure critical infrastructure in many industries. The FortiGate Rugged 70G with Dual 5G Modems combines these features with a compact design, rugged features, and high availability for extreme industrial networking environments.\n\nAbout the Red Dot Award\n\nEvery year, the Red Dot Award for Product Design honors products with exceptionally high design quality. The award is based on the decision of the Red Dot jury, which assesses submissions based on the four basic principles of good design: the quality of function, the quality of seduction, the quality of use, and the quality of responsibility. The 2024 Red Dot jury comprises 39 experts from 20 countries on four continents. Entries from 60 countries were tested and evaluated by the jurors across 51 product categories, including computer and information technology. Past winners include Apple, Ferrari, Logitech, Thule, and other world-renowned brands.\n\nRecognition of Innovation\n\nThis latest recognition from the Red Dot Design Award is a testament to Fortinet’s history of—and commitment to—design innovation. With over 1,300 global patents (and counting), Fortinet has more than twice as many patents as comparable cybersecurity companies. And as a leading vendor in the cybersecurity industry, Fortinet secures over 755,000 of the largest enterprises, OT networks, critical infrastructure, service providers, and government organizations worldwide. Enterprises depend on Fortinet, with over 70 percent of Fortune 100 companies and nearly 70 percent of Global 2000 companies using Fortinet security products.\n\nFortinet continually earns leadership positions across dozens of industry analyst reports, with over 100 analyst reports validating Fortinet across networking and security. Fortinet has also been acknowledged in eight separate Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ reports, including for network firewall, SD-WAN, single-vendor SASE, SSE, enterprise wired and wireless LAN, security information and event management (SIEM), endpoint protection platform, and access management*. We believe this continued recognition is a testament to our unique approach of converging networking and security through a single operating system (FortiOS) and cybersecurity platform (the Security Fabric).\n\nLearn more about the Fortinet portfolio of rugged FortiGate NGFWs.\n\n*Gartner References:\n\nMagic Quadrant for Security Service Edge, Charlie Winckless, Thomas Lintemuth, Dale Koeppen, Published 15 April 2024\n\nMagic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms, Evgeny Mirolyubov, Max Taggett, Franz Hinner, Nikul Patel, Published 31 December 2023\n\nMagic Quadrant for Security Information and Event Management, Pete Shoard, Andrew Davis, Mitchell Schneider, Published 10 October 2022\n\nMagic Quadrant for SD-WAN, Jonathan Forest, Naresh Singh, Andrew Lerner, Karen Brown, Published 27 September 2023\n\nMagic Quadrant for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure, Tim Zimmerman, Christian Canales, Nauman Raja, Mike Leibovitz, Published 06 March 2024\n\nMagic Quadrant for Network Firewalls, Rajpreet Kaur, Adam Hils, Thomas Lintemuth, Published 19 December 2022\n\nMagic Quadrant for Access Management, Henrique Teixeira, Abhyuday Data, Nathan Harris, Robertson Pimental, Published 16 November 2023 (Mentioned in the Honorable Mentions section)\n\nMagic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE, Andrew Lerner, Jonathan Forest, Neil MacDonald, Nat Smith, Charlie Winckless, Published 16 August 2023\n\nGARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally, Magic Quadrant is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates and is used herein with permission.
