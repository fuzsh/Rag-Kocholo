        "text": "âThe COVID-19 pandemic has been an opportunity for many of us to rethink our priorities in life. Reiterating that if our family members, friends and colleagues are healthy â it is just priceless. My deepest sympathy goes to those who have lost a loved one.â\n\nâWe're in this together. Roche, as one of the few companies at the forefront of the response, has entered into several collaborations to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. And weâre working closely with governments, healthcare authorities and the public health communities to ensure the availability of our medicines and diagnostics.â\n\nâThe values that my wife and I are passing on to our five children can be summed up with the phrase âDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.â This includes respect, fairness and a sense of shared responsibility for society.â\n\nâIt is a privilege for us that we can still rely on the founding families as loyal majority shareholders who want a healthy company to pass on to the next generation. This commitment allows the long-term mindset that is key for an innovative business such as ours and has become a cornerstone of our culture.â\n\nâI am a firm believer in the concept of role models as a leadership tool. Employees pay close attention to their managersâ behaviour. They have a feel for whether or not the managers practise what they preach.â\n\nâEven the most ground-breaking innovation is useless if it never reaches the patients. Our aim at Roche is for every person who needs our diagnostics and medicines to be able to access them, no matter where they live.â"
