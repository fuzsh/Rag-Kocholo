        "text": "Franz Inc. and Geoscience Experts Recognize the Growing Importance of Semantic Knowledge Graphs for Earth Science\n\nOAKLAND, Calif., April 22, 2019 â In celebration of Earth Day, Franz Inc., an early innovator in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and leading supplier of Semantic Graph Database technology for Knowledge Graphs, today recognized how AllegroGraph, its semantic knowledge graph technology, is playing an essential part in making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) for the geoscience community. Since the current understanding of earth science processes is largely based on earth observation and numerical model data, making this data FAIR for all geoscientists and technologists is critical to facilitate future knowledge discovery about planet Earth.\n\nCollecting, storing, monitoring and analyzing data from the core of the Earth up to the atmosphere provides critical knowledge about the planet and how living things interact with it. Scientists and technologists gather information about Earth from a range of sources, including: satellites, air- ground- and ocean-based sensors, physical sample data, etc., which are all recorded at a variety of temporal and spatial resolutions and need to be represented on the web for the global scientific community to access and use. AllegroGraphâs unique semantic graph capabilities allow diverse and complex data sources to be easily integrated with full search and cross-dataset queries possible.\n\n\"Our most pressing global environmental challenges cannot be solved by a single organization,\" said Dr. Annie Burgess, Lab Director, Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP). \"Scientists require data collected across multiple disciplines, which are often managed by many different agencies and institutions. ESIP is a community of data and information technology professionals dedicated to ensuring those data are FAIR. To assist with that goal, the unique semantic graph capabilities of AllegroGraph are leveraged with the ESIP Community Ontology Repository, a community platform to manage and exchange terms and vocabularies that assists scientists to publish, discover and reuse data.\"\n\nRead more\n\nBarefoot Networks Uses Franzâs Allegro CL to Drive Artificial Intelligence in Networks\n\nOAKLAND, Calif., April 16, 2019 â Franz Inc., an early innovator in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and leading supplier of Common Lisp (CL) development tools along with Graph Database technology for Knowledge Graphs, today announced that Barefoot Networks uses Franz Allegro CLÂ® (Allegro Common Lisp) in the design of the Barefoot Tofino series programmable switch chips to enable Artificial Intelligence, solve complexity, drive superior performance and power efficiency within networks.\n\n\"At Barefoot Networks we use Lisp (via Allegro CLâs Enterprise class development environment) in the design of our Tofino series of programmable switch chips,\" said Patrick Bosshart, CTO and Co-founder, Barefoot Networks. \"Important to us are basic features of the language like its ability to manipulate symbolic data, to represent programs and create embedded languages. We have created embedded languages for building design netlists, and for the gate placement and routing phases of physical design. All of these have the expressive power of lisp seamlessly included. We build custom module generators and layout compilers on a scale significantly larger and more complex than industry standard approaches, which we believe gives us significant competitive advantages in chip area, performance and power efficiency.\"\n\n\"The best software programmers in the world choose Common Lisp since it is the most exciting language for deploying Artificial Intelligence solutions. Lisp delivers powerful symbolic computing capabilities and its unique homoiconicity simply makes learning systems more powerful that other programming languages,\" said Dr. Jans Aasman, CEO of Franz Inc. \"We are pleased that Barefoot Networks has tapped into the power of Allegro CL to apply the benefits of Artificial Intelligence to the future of programmable networks.\"\n\nRead more\n\nFranz and Semantic Web Company Partner to Create a Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph\n\nSeptember 13, 2018 - Franz Inc., an early innovator in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and leading supplier of Semantic Graph Database technology, AllegroGraph, for Knowledge Graphs, and Semantic Web Company, developers of the PoolParty Semantic Suite and leading provider of Semantic AI solutions, today announced a partnership to develop the Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph.
