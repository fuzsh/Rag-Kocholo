Naber has proved, together with collaborators, the rectifiable structure for singularities of geometric equations, including nonlinear harmonic maps, minimal hypersurfaces and spaces with lower Ricci bounds. This direction of analysis has led to the resolution of several open problems and conjectures, including the energy identity for Yang Mills and the L2 curvature conjecture. In another direction, Naber has settled, together with coworkers, a variety of open problem on spaces with lower Ricci bounds, including the codimension four conjecture and the Milnor conjecture.\n\nDavesh Maulik, Ph.D.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDavesh Maulik works in algebraic geometry, with an emphasis on the geometry of moduli spaces. In many cases, this involves using ideas from neighboring fields such as mathematical physics, symplectic geometry and representation theory.

He works to understand the capabilities of the quantum computers and quantum communication devices we will build in the future, and in the process, he creates connections to other areas of theoretical physics, mathematics and computer science. He has developed quantum algorithms for solving large systems of linear equations and hybrid classical-quantum algorithms for machine learning. Harrow has also contributed to the intersection of quantum information and many-body physics, with work on thermalization, random quantum dynamics and the “monogamy” property of quantum entanglement.\n\nDaniel Jafferis, Ph.D.\n\nHarvard University\n\nThe research of Daniel Jafferis spans many areas of quantum gravity, string theory and quantum field theory. Current directions include understanding bulk observables in holography and extracting lessons for de Sitter spacetime, precisely formulating the statistical ensembles encoding the pseudo-random aspect of chaotic conformal field theories, understanding entanglement entropy in string theory, finding physically realizable quantum systems that exhibit features of emergent gravity, and formulating and resolving the overcounting problem of semi-classical black hole microstates. The overarching goal is to find the full formulation of the laws of physics, in particular the fundamental framework that describes quantum gravity in an expanding universe.\n\nDavid Kaplan, Ph.D.\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nDavid Kaplan is a theoretical physicist proposing extensions to the standard models of particle physics and cosmology and finding new ways to test them experimentally. He has discovered models of a naturally small cosmological constant and Higgs mass, classical solutions for firewalls in general relativity, and causal modifications of quantum mechanics. He has also found testable models of dark matter, dark energy and dark radiation. He has proposed algorithms to discover both heavy and long-lived particles at colliders, as well as techniques for discovering dark matter and new elementary forces using new technologies in novel ways.\n\nNorman Yao, Ph.D.\n\nHarvard University\n\nNorman Yao’s research combines ideas from atomic physics, condensed matter and quantum information, with a focus on proposing laboratory realizations of novel strongly-correlated phenomena. He is known for his work on non-equilibrium phases of matter, ranging from time crystals to Floquet topological phases. Yao’s recent work has contributed to our understanding of ergodicity in many-particle classical and quantum systems, as well as strategies to avoid this fate.

She works in close collaboration with experimental researchers to iteratively test and refine novel mechanistic hypotheses using repeated rounds of model development, calibration and refinement. In turn, the biological problems she studies drive the development of new theory and methodologies.\n\nLeonid Mirny, Ph.D.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nLeonid Mirny combines biophysical modeling with analysis of large genomics data to address fundamental problems in biology. Mirny aims to understand how long DNA molecules of chromosomes are folded in 3D, and how this 3D organization is used by living cells. The Mirny group has proposed that DNA is folded by molecular motors that perform “loop extrusion.” The loop extrusion hypothesis has been confirmed experimentally and has revolutionized our understanding of chromosomes across all organisms. Now, Mirny aims to understand how cells use this and other physical mechanisms to regulate its genes, repair DNA and maintain epigenetic memory.\n\nEugene Chiang, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nEugene Chiang is a theorist with interests in all things planetary. He has worked on proto-planetary disks, post-planetary debris disks, orbital dynamics and planetary atmospheres. A current focus is determining the properties of planets still accreting from their parent disks, to help interpret observations and place planet formation on an empirical footing.\n\nPhilip Hopkins, Ph.D.\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nPhil Hopkins is a theoretical astrophysicist working on a range of problems including galaxies, stars, planets, dark matter and black holes. He has pioneered development of novel high-resolution numerical computational simulations to study complex multi-physics astrophysical systems, in particular those where microphysical and macroscopic astrophysical scales are strongly-coupled. His group has played a crucial role in constraining and testing different dark matter models, understanding the origins and nature of super-massive black holes and quasars, explaining why stars and galaxies have the masses and structure we observe, and exploring the physics of relativistic particles in interstellar gas.\n\nVinod Vaikuntanathan, Ph.D.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nVinod Vaikuntanathan’s research is in the foundations of cryptography and its applications to theoretical computer science at large. He is known for his work on fully homomorphic encryption, a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables complex computations on encrypted data, as well as lattice-based cryptography, which lays down a new mathematical foundation for cryptography in the post-quantum world. Recently, he has been interested in the interactions of cryptography with quantum computing, as well as with statistics and machine learning.\n\nSantosh Vempala, Ph.D.\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nSantosh Vempala has made fundamental advances in the theory of algorithms: for sampling high-dimensional distributions, computing the volume of a convex body, optimization over convex sets, randomized matrix approximation, as well as basic problems in machine learning. In many cases, these were the first polynomial-time algorithms and co-evolved with insights into high-dimensional geometry and probability. Recent highlights include proving that sufficiently sparse linear systems can be solved faster than matrix multiplication (Ax=b, the workhorse of modern computation); extending sampling methods to non-Euclidean (Riemannian) geometries to make them faster (leading to practical methods in very high dimension); pioneering techniques for algorithmic robust statistics (immune to adversarial corruptions); and developing a rigorous theory of computation and learning in the brain in a biologically plausible model (how does the mind emerge from neurons and synapses?). He continues to be puzzled by whether an unknown polytope can be learned in polytime from samples, whether its diameter is bounded by a polynomial in its description length, whether its volume can be computed in polytime without randomization, and whether the answers to these questions will be discovered by humans or by AI.\n\nVirginia Williams, Ph.D.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nVirginia Vassilevska Williams' research is broadly in theoretical computer science, and more specifically in designing algorithms for graphs and matrices, and uncovering formal relationships between seemingly very different computational problems. She is known for her work on fast matrix multiplication, both in co-developing the world's fastest algorithm and in proving limitations on the known techniques for designing matrix multiplication algorithms. Williams is also one of the original founders and leaders of fine-grained complexity, a blossoming new branch of computational complexity.\n\n2022\n\nIvan Corwin, Ph.D.\n\nColumbia University\n\nIvan Corwin works at the interface of probability and mathematical physics with a particular interest in exactly solvable probabilistic models and stochastic partial differential equations. Much of his work has focused around the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation and its universality class.\n\nNick Sheridan, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\nNick Sheridan's work centers around Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture, which posits a deep relationship between symplectic topology and algebraic geometry. Working mainly on the symplectic side, he has developed tools for proving the conjecture and applied them to prove the conjecture in a number of cases, most notably the quintic threefold. In cases where the conjecture is established, Sheridan has given applications to enumerative geometry and symplectic topology.\n\nRead More\n\nWei Zhang, Ph.D.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nWei Zhang is a number theorist working on automorphic representations and arithmetic geometry. He studies special values of zeta and L-functions and their relation to periods and heights of algebraic cycles on moduli spaces over global fields. A focus of his research is various high-dimensional generalizations of the Gross-Zagier formula. In particular, Zhang proposed the relative trace formula approach, which has led to many new deep questions relating the harmonic analysis on spaces with a group action over local fields to the arithmetic intersection theory on local Shimura varieties.\n\nChenyang Xu, Ph.D.\n\nPrinceton University\n\nChenyang Xu works in algebraic geometry, with an emphasis on understanding the structure of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. With his collaborators, Xu led the establishment of a rich algebraic K-stability theory for Fano varieties, crowned by the novel construction of projective K-moduli spaces parametrizing Fano varieties. The new algebraic method invented by Xu and his collaborators, largely built on the minimal model program in birational geometry, also provides a solution to the algebraic Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for all Fano varieties, and a radically new singularity theory.\n\nEhud Altman, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nEhud Altman studies quantum many-body phenomena in condensed matter and quantum information systems. He is known for introducing dynamical renormalization group methods to describe many-body localization and for establishing the nature of large-scale fluctuations in exciton-polariton condensates. Altman’s recent work has contributed to elucidating the role of quantum information, entanglement and chaos in the dynamics of many-body systems. With collaborators, he introduced the notion of Krylov complexity as a holographic-like principle for quantum operator growth in generic systems and helped to understand information phase transitions in quantum circuits using tools from field theory and statistical mechanics.\n\nMichael Levin, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nMichael Levin’s research combines ideas from condensed matter physics, quantum information and mathematics with a focus on the theory of topological phases of matter. In one line of research, he has constructed exactly solvable lattice models that realize a general class of two-dimensional strongly interacting topological phases. These lattice models have become a useful theoretical tool for studying anyons. He has also introduced a way to probe topological phases using entanglement entropy, which has given rise to new numerical methods. Recently, Levin has made contributions to the theory of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological matter, both in equilibrium and in periodically driven systems.\n\nMariangela Lisanti, Ph.D.\n\nPrinceton University\n\nMariangela Lisanti is a theoretical astroparticle physicist studying the nature of dark matter. Her research is interdisciplinary and often involves application of novel data science techniques or collaborations with experimentalists and observers. Lisanti helped to pioneer the use of simplified models in Large Hadron Collider searches, proposed new directions for dark matter experiments and developed original analysis methods for studying dark matter annihilation in gamma rays. Most recently, Lisanti has been harnessing data from astrophysical surveys to probe the fundamental nature of dark matter and map its distribution in the Milky Way.\n\nRead More\n\nDouglas Stanford, Ph.D.\n\nStanford University\n\nDouglas Stanford works on quantum gravity and its connection to quantum mechanics, mainly in the context of simple toy models of black holes. He and his collaborators showed that black holes exhibit the butterfly effect and used this as a starting point to explore chaos in quantum many-body systems. Stanford’s recent work has focused on aspects of black holes that appear in tension with the rules of ordinary quantum mechanics and, in particular, on the search for spacetime effects that can resolve the tension.\n\nRead More\n\nJesse Thaler, Ph.D.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nJesse Thaler is a theoretical particle physicist who fuses techniques from quantum field theory and machine learning to address questions in fundamental physics. His current research focuses on maximizing the discovery potential of the Large Hadron Collider through new theoretical frameworks and novel data analysis techniques. Thaler is an expert in jets, which are collimated sprays of particles copiously produced at colliders, and he studies the substructure of jets to enhance the search for new phenomena and illuminate the dynamics of gauge theories.\n\nOlga Dudko, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of California, San Diego\n\nOlga Dudko is a theoretical physicist who explores the phenomena of the living world. Her research is driven by the notion that deep, physics-based conceptual approaches can encompass living-system complexity. The theory of single-molecule force spectroscopy developed by Dudko and collaborators has been widely used for extracting activation energies and rate constants from experiments on conformational transitions in biological macromolecules. Recent areas of research include the spatiotemporal organization of chromosomes, virus-host cell interactions and neuronal communication. Dudko’s research strives for a unifying understanding of disparate biological processes through analytically tractable theories that reveal unifying principles and are predictive in experiments.\n\nJoshua Weitz, Ph.D.\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nJoshua Weitz explores how viruses transform the fate of cells, individuals, populations and ecosystems. In collaboration with experimentalists, his research in viral ecology has revealed latent structures of virus-host infection networks, identified principles underlying the therapeutic use of viruses against bacterial pathogens and shown how repeated infections catalyze the diversification of complex virus-microbe communities. Weitz's recent and ongoing work on pandemic dynamics examines how behavior change and asymptomatic spread shape outbreaks and can be used to inform data-driven interventions.\n\nRead More\n\nAlex Schekochihin, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Oxford\n\nAlex Schekochihin is interested in the fundamental nature and practical implications of turbulence in plasmas. His main contributions have concerned the physics of turbulent dynamo (believed responsible for much of the observed cosmic magnetism), the free-energy cascade and the interplay between microscale instabilities and mesoscale dynamics in astrophysical plasmas from galaxy clusters to solar wind, and mechanisms for “phase transitions” between low- and high-transport states in fusion devices. Recently, Schekochihin proposed a theory of fluidization of collisionless plasma turbulence, owing to suppression of Landau damping by stochastic echoes. This has led to his ongoing interest in the general problem of turbulent relaxation and universal equilibria in collisionless plasmas.\n\nTracy Slatyer, Ph.D.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nTracy Slatyer is a theoretical physicist working at the interface of particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics, seeking clues to the mystery of dark matter in astrophysical and cosmological data. She was a co-discoverer of the giant gamma-ray structures known as the “Fermi Bubbles” and has done influential work on new theories of dark matter and possible effects of dark matter interactions from the early universe to the present day.\n\nShayan Oveis Gharan, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nShayan Oveis Gharan’s research exploits deep tools from mathematics, such as the theory of real stable and log-concave polynomials, spectral graph theory and high-dimensional simplicial complexes to design and analyze algorithms for discrete objects. He is known for his results on improved approximation algorithms for classical optimization problems such as traveling salesperson problems, as well as his analysis of the mixing time of Markov chains to efficiently sample from complex probability distributions such as the uniform distribution over the bases of a matroid.\n\nShachar Lovett, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of California, San Diego\n\nShachar Lovett works broadly in theoretical computer science and related mathematics. He focuses on the study of structure and randomness, and how they are pivotal to our understanding of efficient computation. One facet of Lovett’s work is discovering the mathematical structures that underlie efficient computation, such as combinatorial structure in complexity theory, geometric structure in machine learning and algebraic structure in coding theory. Another facet is understanding the power of randomness in computation. Structure and randomness can be seen as complementary, and Lovett’s work aims to identify the fracture lines between structure and randomness, towards a better understanding of computation.\n\nGregory Valiant, Ph.D.\n\nStanford University\n\nGregory Valiant works at the intersection of algorithms, information theory, learning and statistics to understand how to extract as much information as possible from data in various fundamental settings. What information can be inferred if the amount of data is sublinear in the support size or dimensionality of the distribution in question? How do restrictions on the amount of available memory affect the time or amount of data required to learn or optimize? Can we make learning and estimation algorithms robust to outlying training data or settings where the test and training sets are dissimilar?\n\n2021\n\nGuido De Philippis, Ph.D.\n\nNew York University\n\nGuido De Philippis works in geometric measure theory, calculus of variations and partial differential equations. His main interest is the understanding of regularity (or lack thereof) of solutions of geometric variational problems, ranging from minimal surfaces to free boundary problems. Recently, in collaboration with Filip Rindler, he obtained a fine description of the structure of the singular part of measures satisfying a linear partial differential equation (PDE) constraint. By suitably choosing the PDE constriction, the result allowed a number of open questions to be solved: extension of Alberti’s rank-one theorem to the space of bounded deformation (BD) functions, converse of the Rademacher theorem and structure of Lipschitz differentiability spaces.\n\nJune Huh, Ph.D.\n\nStanford University\n\nJune Huh studies discrete objects using geometric methods. An unexpected relation between combinatorics and algebraic geometry found by Huh was used in his proof of Read's conjecture in graph theory. In recent works, he and his collaborators proposed a more general framework that tightens the connection between the two seemingly disparate fields. This led to proofs of several other long-standing problems in combinatorics, such as the ultra-log-concavity conjecture of Mason and the top-heavy conjecture of Dowling–Wilson.\n\nLin Lin, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nLin Lin is an applied mathematician working in electronic structure theory. With collaborators, he has developed efficient, accurate and scalable algorithms in Kohn–Sham density functional theory, localization theory, many-body perturbation theory and quantum embedding theory. Several new methods have been adopted by electronic structure software packages widely used in quantum chemistry, quantum physics and materials science. Recently, Lin has contributed to neural network-based methods for accelerating molecular simulations, as well as quantum algorithms for solving high-dimensional linear algebra problems with applications to electronic structure calculations.\n\nAssaf Naor, Ph.D.\n\nPrinceton University\n\nAssaf Naor’s research focuses on analysis and geometry in high dimensions, with emphasis on understanding the structure of metric spaces, including the extent to which they can be realized in “nicer” geometries. He harnesses such insights for a variety of applications in several areas of pure mathematics (analysis, geometry, probability, combinatorics, group theory), and also in order to chart the possibilities and limitations of algorithms. Much of Naor’s work makes progress on the long-standing Ribe program, which is a web of conjectures and analogies between linear and nonlinear geometries that is inspired by a classical rigidity theorem of Ribe.\n\nRead More\n\nXie Chen, Ph.D.\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nXie Chen studies exotic topological phenomena that can emerge in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. Her work uses ideas and tools in quantum information to explore topological states of matter and study the relationships between them. She discovered and systematically constructed symmetry-protected topological phases in strongly interacting systems in two and higher dimensions. She proposed methods to classify and detect anomalies in symmetry-enriched topological phases. Recently, Chen’s work on fracton phases generalized the notion of phase and universality to properly capture the unusual “beyond topology” phenomena discovered in certain quantum error-correction codes.\n\nRead More\n\nShanhui Fan, Ph.D.\n\nStanford University\n\nShanhui Fan works broadly on photonics theory. Fan has made fundamental contributions in temporal coupled mode theory, non-reciprocity as induced by dynamic modulation, photonic gauge potentials, waveguide quantum electrodynamics, solar cell light trapping theory and daytime radiative cooling. Recently, he has been working on concepts of synthetic dimensions as a way to explore Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological physics in photonics.\n\nPeter Graham, Ph.D.\n\nStanford University\n\nPeter Graham is interested in the fundamental laws of nature. Motivated by long-standing mysteries in particle physics and cosmology such as the weakness of gravity and the nature of dark matter, he proposed several new theories for these open questions. Additionally, he helped pioneer the use of ultrahigh-precision technologies for experimentally probing these questions. With experimental colleagues, he proposed novel approaches for detecting dark matter, new forces and gravitational waves. This gave rise to experiments using techniques from atomic physics, nuclear magnetic resonance and quantum information which are poised to shed new light on our universe.\n\nRead More\n\nSurjeet Rajendran, Ph.D.\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nSurjeet Rajendran has invented new experimental methods to detect gravitational waves, dark matter and dark energy. These methods are being implemented by many laboratories around the world. He has also developed theoretical tools to solve outstanding problems of particle physics such as the hierarchy and vacuum energy problems via cosmological evolution. His recent theoretical interests have been in identifying novel gravitational phenomena within general relativity, permitting new experimentally testable approaches to resolving cosmological singularities and solutions to the black hole information problem.\n\nRead More\n\nL. Mahadevan, Ph.D.\n\nHarvard University\n\nL. Mahadevan is a professor of applied mathematics, physics, and organismic and evolutionary biology. His work attempts to understand motion and matter at the observable scale of “middle earth” by integrating experiments, theory and computation. Areas of interest include the patterns of shape and flow of inanimate matter and the dynamics of sentient living matter that can self-organize, perceive and act. His publications range over subjects such as the geometry and physics of soft materials, the mathematics of origami and kirigami, the morphodynamics of cells and organs, and the ethology of collective behavior.
