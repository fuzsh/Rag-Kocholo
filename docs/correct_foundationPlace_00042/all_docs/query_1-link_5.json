        "text": "In addition to working with other organizations, HFI has undertaken the restoration of a number of other sites which include:\n\nArchambault House (circa 1850) – 603 rue St. Denis. Now privately owned.\n\nThe builder of this house, Auguste Archambault, was one of the last mountain men. At the age of 12 he joined William Reed, Dennis Julien, and James Scott Reed in establishing trading posts with the indigenous Utes community, the first post established by white men in what is now Utah. At 27 he was serving as a guide for John Fremont in a reconnaissance party, as well as serving under him in the Mexican War. He and his wife Amanda (Piera), a daughter of Florissant’s first settlers, were married in St. Ferdinand’s Church in 1848 when Amanda was 18. Together they had 13 children, two of which died at birth. This home is unique because it has the original summer kitchen, brick privy, well house, and sheds. There are several ghost stories and legends associated with this house. A portrait of Auguste and Amanda is on display at the Gittemeier House\n\nMyers House & Barn (1867) – 180 Dunn Rd., Occupied by private owner and a wool shop.\n\nIn 1867 John B. Myers, a Pennsylvania native who had settled in Calhoun County, Illinois, bought 50 acres of land on what is now Dunn Road. He married a French immigrant, Adaline Mottin, and had three children with her. While the house was under construction in 1869, he died of pneumonia at the age of 48. His wife was pregnant with their third child. He left no will, and Adaline spent thirteen years dealing with his estate in probate court. She finished the construction of the house, a Victorian Greek Revival structure that is architecturally unique in Florissant. The house changed multiple owners after her death in 1926 and was threatened with destruction by the expansion of I-170 in the 1970s. However, organizers from the community and Historic Florissant, Inc. were able to negotiate an alternative route with the Highway Department and saved the structure.\n\nPeters House (1912) – 990 rue St. Francois, Restored and sold to private owners.\n\nJoseph Peters was a prominent citizen of Florissant. He served as mayor, president of Florissant Bank, founder of Citizen’s Bank of Florissant, and founder of Florissant Cannery and Creamery. He also was an avid horticulturist who cultivated unique and unusual plants on his properties. Historic Florissant rescued this house from the bulldozer in the expansion of Florissant Bank in 1979. Once called an eyesore, now properly restored, it is a charming old house that reminds us that St. Francois was always a mixed street with commercial and residential properties.\n\nDeLisle Building (1878) – 298 rue St. Francois, Restored and sold for commercial use.\n\nLeon DeLisle was a conductor on the West End Narrow Gauge Railroad and operated one of the first hotels and taverns in this building. In a St. Louis Post Dispatch article dated Dec 9, 1928, Leon was described by Mrs. James Franciscus as being a “conductor who gallantly assisted the passengers up the narrow steps to the tiny platform. He made grotesque faces, sang songs, and jigged for the babies. He always wore a red rose in his buttonhole.” This entire block was known as DeLisle Square which included a park area for picnics and three buildings; a “round house”, a pavilion, and this structure which was a tavern and hotel. On a Sunday, visitors would arrive in Florissant by train, attend church at St. Ferdinand, walk to the DeLisle Hotel to purchase a picnic lunch, and meet with friends in the park nearby. It was operated at different times by Charles Delisle, John Creely, Chris Autzen, Ben Raup, Tobias Geno, Nick Majors, and others.\n\nCougot Log Cabin in Tower Court Park – owned by the City of Florissant.\n\nThis cabin is believed to have been built prior to 1850 by trappers. It is one of two owned and donated by Dr. Leo and Nita Cougot to Florissant Valley Historical Society and then transferred to Historic Florissant Inc. In 1959 the city wanted to build a water tower on the property. One of the cabins was beyond saving so it was destroyed and used to preserve the cabin you see standing today. Historic Florissant, Inc. and volunteers restored the cabin during the 1980s. Its only heat is from the fireplace and there is no electricity or water.\n\nAll of these buildings were endangered but have been preserved through the efforts of Historic Florissant, Inc. Each is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places or on the Florissant Landmark Register. Historic Florissant Inc. is proud of its accomplishments which were made possible by the support of the community and countless dedicated volunteers. Their hours of service and financial assistance represent a debt that can never be paid. Their only reward comes from knowing that they have made an important contribution to their community.\n\nFranz Gittemeier was born in Rebbeke, Westphalia, Germany in 1826. He immigrated to the United States in 1850. Gertrude Gerling was born in Prussia in April of 1833. She came to the United States in 1857 and Franz and Gertrude were married in Holy Trinity Church in St. Louis on September 25, 1858.\n\nFranz hired out as a farm hand near Bridgeton, Missouri but soon decided to go to the California gold fields. He worked in the mines for seven years and returned to Florissant with enough gold dust to buy fifty acres of farmland and build the two story brick house where he and Gertrude raised ten children.\n\nA hard worker, Franz prospered and eventually owned 500 acres of land. According to family legend, each of his ten children received a farm and $10,000 on his death on September 7, 1891. Gertrude died on March 15, 1908.\n\nThe descendants of Franz and Gertrude Gittemeier are many; they have been leaders in the fields of business, religion and politics–men and women who added strength and character to the Florissant community.\n\nIn 1938, Mrs. Mae Pondrom, another prominent name in Florissant history, purchased the property. Her descendents occupied it until Shell Oil Company acquired it for commercial development in 1990. The farmhouse was slated for destruction and the bulldozer was at the front door. Because the community expressed its desire to preserve the house, Shell asked Historic Florissant, Inc. to assume the responsibility of restoring and maintaining the house. The house and sufficient land to meet city requirements were given to Historic Florissant with the provision that the exterior restoration be completed within one year.\n\nArchitect Philip Cotton, Jr. was selected to direct the restoration. Albert Gettemeier, a great-grandson of Franz was the restoration contractor (some of Franz’s descendants changed the spelling). Borrowing the money, Historic Florissant Inc. met their deadline. The office, bookstore and Resource Center of Historic Florissant Inc. are now located in the Gittemeier House and the remaining space is used as a house museum."
