        "text": "1896\n\nEngelbert Franz, at the age of 15, immigrated to the United States to work in his uncleâs bakery in Portland Oregon; United States Bakery.\n\n1898\n\nEngelbertâs brother, Joseph Franz, immigrated to the United States to work alongside his brother. Their brother Ignaz immigrates one year later to work alongside them.\n\n1906\n\nEngelbert, Joseph, and Ignaz purchased the Ann Arbor Bakery, NW 16th and Glisan where bread deliveries were made in horse-drawn wagons.\n\n1907\n\nThe Franz brothers saved up and acquired their uncleâs bakery - United States Bakery at East 7th & Burnside, and the decision was made to keep and use the United States Bakery name.\n\n1909\n\nThe brothers purchase the rights to the Butter Nut Bread name. Sales expand to Salem and The Dalles, Oregon.\n\n1912\n\nUnited States Bakery expands and the bakery at NE 11th and Flanders was built. We are still baking there today and it is the home of the iconic spinning bread loaf!\n\n1913\n\nEngelbert's son Joe is born in the living quarters above the bakery. Around this time trucks begin to replace horse drawn wagons.\n\n1920s\n\nThe name transition from the United States Bakery to Franz Bakery begins. Bread also starts getting sold in paper wrappers.\n\n1947\n\nNew buildings and machinery are added at the 11th and Flanders bakery, turning it into one of the most modern in the country.\n\n1997\n\nFranz purchases Gai's Northwest Bakeries in Seattle, Washington, and Sourdough breads are added to the Franz lineup."
