        "text": "Burkburnett, Texas — After achieving 88% percent growth over the last three years, HomeWell Franchising Inc. ranked once again in the Inc. 5000. This list represents the nation’s fastest-growing private companies in the American economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent businesses.\n\n“The accomplishment of building one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S., in light of recent economic roadblocks, cannot be overstated,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. “Inc. is thrilled to honor the companies that have established themselves through innovation, hard work, and rising to the challenges of today.”\n\nThis is HomeWell’s second time to be included in Inc.’s prestigious ranking after joining it for the first time last year. It’s an honor that CEO Crystal Franz does not take lightly.\n\n“We are elated to be included again in this distinguished ranking and listed among so many thriving small businesses and private companies. Ultimately, I believe this recognition speaks to the caliber of our franchise owners, as their commitment to the families and communities they serve drives HomeWell’s growth. We will continue to provide them with the resources they need to further their impact and excel in their local markets.” — Crystal Franz, CEO of HomeWell Franchising, Inc.\n\nHomeWell Care Services, franchised through its parent company, HomeWell Franchising Inc., provides trusted, quality non-medical home care while offering entrepreneurs a path to successful business ownership. HomeWell franchise owners are well-equipped to distinguish their service offerings and hit the ground running from launch through plug-and-play brand initiatives, expertly designed Signature™ Programs and personalized support from franchise business coaches.\n\nSince 2018, HomeWell has signed over 35 new owners and expanded its footprint in over 25 new states. At its current pace, it expects to have more than 100 HomeWell Care Services franchises in 2023.\n\nThe franchise also recently launched a second buying option to eliminate a financial barrier in starting a HomeWell agency. For a limited time, entrepreneurs can take advantage of the Zero Initial Franchise Fee buying option, which waives the initial franchise fee and allows them to invest these funds into their businesses instead.\n\n“The future certainly looks bright–not just for HomeWell but for the entrepreneurs who want to capitalize on the tremendous growth we’re seeing in home care,” says CEO Franz. “As we continue expanding our footprint and service offerings, we’re concurrently scaling our efforts to reach more families who need quality care options for their loved ones. There has never been a better time to join HomeWell’s franchise network and make a real difference in so many lives.”\n\nAbout HomeWell Franchising Inc.\n\nHomeWell Care Services®, franchised by HomeWell Franchising Inc., provides personal care, companionship, and home maker services for seniors and other homebound individuals, so they can remain safely in the comfort of wherever they call home.

To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2018. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2021. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2018 is $100,000; the minimum for 2021 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to four decimal places. The top 500 companies on the Inc. 5000 are featured in Inc. magazine’s September issue. The entire Inc. 5000 can be found at https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2022.\n\nAbout Inc."
