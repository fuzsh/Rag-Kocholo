Don't miss the Franz Inc.'s Dynamic Objects(Lisp)for Bioinformatics Panel Session Developing novel algorithms and applications in bioinformatics is often a matter of bringing together diverse datasets and computational approaches in new ways. Although there are many competing programming options available for bioinformaticians, Lisp provides some powerful advantages. Join us for a briefing on current conditions and opportunities within the bioinformatics industry. Learn more about some of the unique solutions and innovative applications Lisp has to offer, and receive free Lisp development tools. Date: Sunday August 20th, 2000 Time: 11:30 - 1pm Location: Los Angeles/Santa Barbara Room LUNCH WILL BE SERVED Please RSVP(if possible)via email or visit the Franz Inc.
