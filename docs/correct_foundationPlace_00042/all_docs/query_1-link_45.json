        "text": "Now in his eighties, Tom Owen is known as Louisville’s famed historian. With megaphone in hand, he has been giving walks, tours, and lectures for decades—at least forty years for Leadership Louisville Center. Vice president Aaron Miller says “no one knows more about the history of our city than Tom, and the thing that makes him so special is his passion in teaching this history to others.” He goes on to say, “our mission is to inspire and equip leaders to be better and to do better, and there are few Louisvillians who have done more to fulfill that mission than Tom.”\n\nBeyond a historian, Owen has been a leader on many fronts: he has led congregations as a minister, he certainly led as a politician as an Alderman and member of Metro Council, and of course he even ran for Mayor back in 1998.\n\nThis cartoon captured the essence of Tom Owen, Louisville’s head cheerleader—even though he would lose the race to Dave Armstrong.\n\nAnd he’s still cheering for Louisville.\n\nAs we partner with Kentucky Humanities for this program, executive director Bill Goodman had this to say: “Tom represents everything good about life in Louisville—pride in the city, outstanding public service, knowledge about history of place, and old-fashion character and humor. Kentucky Humanities couldn’t be prouder to be involved in celebrating his life.”\n\nPlease join us March 21 to celebrate Tom Owen and thank him. Click here to buy tickets to be part of such a special evening for Louisville, for the Frazier, and for Tom.\n\n“The night will be a gathering of folks who have touched my life over many decades,” Tom says. “Can you imagine how good it feels to have been involved in the life of your hometown in so many ways? I expect the occasion to further my appreciation for friends and our entire community.”\n\nYou’ll hear it a lot on March 21, but let me start by saying it now: thank you, Tom Owen.\n\nAlso in this week’s Frazier Weekly, we are counting down to Abraham Lincoln’s birthday and Valentine’s Day, there’s some Kentucky flavor at the Super Bowl, and please consider signing GLI’s pledge as we commemorate Black History Month.\n\nThis Week in the Museum\n\nFrom the Collection: Lincoln and Union Generals Bandana, c. 1864\n\nHappy 214th birthday to President Lincoln!\n\nOne of the most notable and well-remembered presidents in US history for his determination to preserve the Union and abolish slavery, Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky.\n\nThough born in a small log cabin, Lincoln rose from his humble origins to become a lawyer, a legislator, and a skilled politician. By the time of his presidential campaign in 1860, his anti-slavery views were already causing dissension among southern states. Confederate attacks broke out shortly after he assumed the presidency, the start of a costly and bloody civil war.\n\nThis handkerchief, or bandana, dates to Lincoln’s term as President during the Civil War, c. 1864. The printed fabric depicts five carte-de-visite portraits of President Lincoln and four generals: John C. Fremont, whom Lincoln gave command over the Department of the West at the outset of the war; General George McClellan, who commanded the Department of the Ohio; General Henry Halleck, who commanded the Department of the Missouri and served as General in Chief of the Armies of the United States; and General Franz Sigel, a German-American officer who rose through the ranks to the position of Major General by 1862 and lead the Shenandoah Valley ranks against Confederate General Stonewall Jackson.\n\nWhile this artifact could date to 1862, the later date is likely given the fact Lincoln, Fremont, and McClellan were presidential candidates in 1864. Bandanas, a fashion that came to Europe and the Americas from India, often served as symbols of endorsement or allegiance to a particular group or person as early as the American Revolution. Throughout the nineteenth century, bandanas such as these showed public support for political figures, especially presidential candidates. Today, bandanas that portray President Lincoln from the late 1800s are quite rare.\n\nVisit our permanent exhibition The Commonwealth: Divided We Fall to see more artifacts related to Abraham Lincoln and the Lincoln family on display.\n\nFrazier Staffer’s Book I See Lincoln’s Underpants Hits Shelves\n\nLeave it to our curator of guest experience at the Frazier, Mick Sullivan, to have us pondering questions like boxers, briefs, or bloomers? It’s all in the name of history, folks, and Mick is all about making history engaging. His new book titled I See Lincoln’s Underpants is his second book and promises to be as fascinating as his first book The Meatshower, which details the true story of meat falling from the sky in Bath County, Kentucky, in 1876. Both books can be purchased in the Frazier’s Museum Store!—Rachel Platt, Director of Community Engagement\n\nIt’s a safe bet that Abraham Lincoln never got new underwear for his birthday, which happens to be later this week, on February 12. I can say this with some certainty because his practical homemade underwear made a few surprise appearances during his lifetime.\n\nInspired by these revealing moments, I spent years looking for other stories of notable people and their underwear. I’m happy to say Heart Ally Press has just published this collection of underwear tales as a book! The title is I See Lincoln’s Underpants: The Surprising Times Underwear (and the People Wearing Them) Made History.\n\nAs the book is aimed at middle-grade readers and families, plenty of adults are also enjoying glimpses into the lives, impact, and dresser drawers of Kentuckian and inventor Garrett Morgan, swimmer Annette Kellerman, Marie Antoinette, Al Capone, Buster Keaton, and more. Underwear is not the main character of each story, but it always makes a surprising appearance.\n\nIt’s available in the Frazier’s Museum Store and online, if you’d like a copy!\n\nEveryone who attended got to try their very exclusive Bourbon, 78 Legends, honoring the year that they won the NCAA Championship. I’m not sure which one I enjoyed more: the Bourbon or all of the great stories the panelists shared about their years playing at UK!\n\nOur next Bourbon program—held Friday, February 17—will feature two single barrel selections from New Riff distillery and two tastings from Ten20 brewery. We hope you come and bring your best friend or your Valentine for a great night out at the Frazier!\n\nYou can find out more about that event here.\n\nJohnson County Native Chris Stapleton to Sing National Anthem at Super Bowl LVII\n\nWith the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs playing in the Super Bowl this Sunday, it’s understandable that many Kentuckians might feel left out in the cold.\n\nWe will not have the Bengals to root for this time around. Also, besides Kansas City reserves Darian Kinnard and Phil Hoskins (both former Kentucky Wildcats), the only locals we could root for are former Cincinnati Bearcats Travis Kelce, a tight end for the Chiefs, and his brother Jason Kelce, who plays center for the Eagles.\n\nStill, one Kentuckian is a lock to suit up and perform for the Super Bowl.\n\nIt’s the latest achievement in the career of an exceptional, yet humbly cool, Kentuckian. As a country music artist and songwriter, the eight-time Grammy winner Stapleton is as accomplished as Tom Brady—and he’s forgotten neither his roots nor how to have a good time, to boot.\n\nIn the aftermath of the flooding that ravaged Eastern Kentucky last summer, Stapleton casually lent a hand during the recovery efforts. Like fellow Kentuckian Charles Booker, Stapleton has gotten down in the hood, as well as in the holler. All of this is natural for an artist who is as at home closing out Bourbon and Beyond as he is with just ordering room service with his wife and kids to wind down at a hotel on the night before the Grammys.\n\nIndeed, Chris Stapleton is a Kentucky boy through and through, someone that we all can cheer for and be proud of this Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nBridging the Divide\n\nGLI Senior Director of DEI Dana Johnson on Racial Equity Pledge\n\nMore than 170 businesses have signed Greater Louisville Inc.’s Racial Equity Pledge—and Dana Johnson is hoping for 500 by the end of the year.\n\nAs GLI’s senior director of diversity, she is passionate about her work. It is also deeply personal to her: you’ll find out why in our interview.\n\nThe pledge started in the spring of 2021 in response to the racial justice movement of 2020. We talk about goals, change, learning together, and knowing perhaps we may not always get it right. The Frazier History Museum has signed the pledge, and as our president Andy Treinen stated, “We signed it to hold ourselves accountable in doing the important work to move ourselves forward as an organization—and to be part of an effort to make our community a better place.”\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the pledge, you can reach out to Dana at djohnson@greaterlouisville.com. Any time is the right time to talk about the pledge—but during Black History Month, it’s especially poignant. Here we go."
