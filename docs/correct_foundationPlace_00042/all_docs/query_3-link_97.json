        "text": "A pedigree (family tree) reconstruction tool for natural populations.\n\nAllele frequency analyses:\n\nHeterozygosities\n\nPolymorphic Information Content (PIC)\n\nExact Hardy Weinberg Test\n\nTest for Null Alleles\n\nExclusion probabilities: Estimate the power of your marker suite.\n\nFRANz is flexible, you CAN (but don't have to!) incorporate available prior knowledge:\n\nKnown sub-pedigrees (e.g. mother-offspring arcs) or fullsib groups\n\nThe sex and years of birth and death of individuals\n\nSampling locations (pairwise distances or coordinates)\n\nSampling rate (number of unsampled males and females)\n\nMost other tools assume that you know all or most of these.\n\nUser friendly: FRANz uses this prior knowledge to generate the lists of candidate parents internally. Once you have your data in a FRANz input file, you are almost done. A GUI for input file generation is available on our website.\n\nCan handle data with typing errors and missing alleles.\n\nEstimation of the number of unsampled candidate mothers and fathers.\n\nFRANz is fast: It was written for data sets with thousands of individuals. It supports modern CPUs with multiple cores.\n\nAvailable for Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\nOpen Source: Obtain FRANz under the GPL Version 3.\n\nIf possible, try to compile FRANz. Supporting the different versions of the major operating systems is difficult, but the source code should always work. If you have trouble compiling the code on Linux or Mac, please contact us. Download the latest stable source code from SourceForge.net:\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/franzpedigree/files/\n\nAlternatively, get the newest code from github:\n\nhttps://github.com/lima1/franzpedigree/tarball/master\n\nThen unzip:\n\nThen compile:\n\nFor multicore CPUs (requires GCC >=4.2 or ICC).\n\nFor Leopard or newer, you can either download the installer or you can compile the source package (this works with older Mac OS X Versions as well).\n\nTo compile the source package, you need the Apple Developer Tools. To enable OpenMP, you have to compile FRANz with gcc-4.2 (or newer) or Intel's ICC. GCC 4.2 is available on Leopard:\n\nMake sure that you use gcc or icc for OpenMP; on newer Mac versions, you have to install the command line tools in XCode 4.3 or newer.\n\nOn Tiger if you don't want to install a recent compiler (e.g. from finkproject.org):\n\nIf you want to install FRANz on Windows, you can use the installer available from our website. Currently, only the single CPU version is available for Windows. Linux and Mac are still the recommended platforms.\n\nTo compile the source package, you will need something like Cygwin (this should give you the multi-core Version) or MinGW (there are experimental releases with OpenMP support). Make sure that FRANz is compiled with -DWIN32. Otherwise at least the progressbar will not work.\n\nOnce you have your data in the input format, analyzing it should be easy. There are some Perl scripts in extras/input to convert Excel (saved as CSV-file) or migrate data. There is also an user friendly CSV to FRANz converter available on the FRANz website.\n\nAlso check the manpage\n\nAllele frequencies with partially missing genotypes. CERVUS ignores the rare cases with partially missing genotypes (e.g. 123.?) in the allele frequency calculation and we followed this strategy. This can cause problems for rare alleles.\n\nMost of the problems are related to wrongly formatted input files. If you get a segmentation fault, please if possible try to re-compile with --enable-debug. Then start FRANz in the GNU debugger:\n\nThen run the program with the same set of paramaters:\n\nAfter the segmentation fault, type backtrace and send us the output with your bugreport:\n\nAny comments, questions, critics or suggestions are gratefully received. So please don't hesitate to contact us! We would be happy to help. Your feedback will help us improving this software.\n\nmarkus@bioinf.uni-leipzig.de\n\nCopyright 2008-2010.
