        "text": "Stuart Babcock\n\nJ.D. 2024\n\nStuart Babcock is a second year J.D. candidate at Yale Law School. As a LEAP Fellow, he is broadly interested in advancing animal welfare in agricultural, scientific, and wild contexts. Before matriculating at Yale, Stuart attended Northwestern University, where he earned a B.A. in Mathematics and a B.M. in Music Theory, and Boston University, where he earned an M.A. in Neuroscience. Between stints in school, he worked as a software engineer and as a patent professional. In the animal space, Stuart has volunteered with Faunalytics, a data-driven animal advocacy non-profit, and the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, a natural history museum with a focus on connecting Chicagoans to nature. He hopes to leverage his technical background as he continues to explore legal avenues to advance animal welfare.\n\nHannah Beath\n\nM.P.H. 2023\n\nHannah Beath is a second-year Master of Public Health candidate in the Health Policy department with a concentration in Climate Change and Health. She is particularly interested in the intersection of health and climate policy and how to leverage communication strategies to increase support for policy intervention, particularly in the Southern United States and Southern Appalachia, where she is from. As a LEAP fellow, her research will explore the relationship between health co-benefits, environmental regulations, and animal rights through a policy lens.\n\nElinor Case-Pethica\n\nJ.D. 2023\n\nElinor is a J.D. candidate at Yale Law School. She received her undergraduate degree in studio art from Wesleyan University in 2017 and spent several years working in curation and contemporary art research prior to starting law school. Her introduction to the animal welfare and rights movement was through this curatorial lens, confronting issues of cultural expression and exchange in the Guggenheim’s Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World exhibition, which was widely critiqued for its inclusion of artworks that incorporated live animals. Elinor looks forward to investigating how human interactions with animals unsettle the perceived divide between the natural and the cultural, particularly as it pertains to farming and food systems.\n\nKevin Chen\n\nJ.D. 2023\n\nKevin is a J.D. candidate at Yale Law School. He is broadly interested in issues at the intersection of environmental justice, political economy, and international security. As a LEAP Fellow, Kevin hopes to explore the role of animal law and policy in increasing corporate and government accountability for transnational environmental harms. Prior to law school, he worked as a research assistant at the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation, where he developed curricula and supported community-led research on nuclear contamination in the San Francisco Bay Area. He holds a B.A. in Anthropology and Economics from Columbia University.\n\nHuangrui Chu\n\nM.S. 2024\n\nHuangrui Chu is a graduate student at the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH). He is currently the research assistant for the bird collision. As a LEAP fellow, he hopes to dig into this research to make yale a bird-friendly environment. Prior to Yale, he also joined the Bird Collision Project at Duke Kunshan University (DKU) and visualize the bird collision data based on DKU’s campus map. Huangrui holds a bachelor's degree in data science from Duke Kunshan University.\n\nIlaria Cimadori\n\nPh.D. 2027\n\nIlaria is a second year PhD student at the Yale School of the Environment. Her interest in animal protection motivated her master's thesis research project. In particular, she carried out a policy effectiveness assessment of four prominent conventions protecting biodiversity with African Elephants as a case study, analyzing data on African Elephants in four countries to see how effective these conventions were at protecting the population over the years. During her PhD, she would like to focus her research on new bio-technologies regulations and how they may impact animals and the environment. During her free time, she volunteers at the animal shelter of her hometown. She also has a background in languages and international relations.\n\nAlice Courtright\n\nS.T.M. Yale Divinity School 2023\n\nAlice Courtright studies theology and literature at Yale Divinity School, with a particular interest in the environmental humanities. She received her BA from Yale in English literature and creative writing, and her MDiv from Sewanee’s School of Theology in Tennessee. After seminary, Alice served as an Episcopal priest in New Hampshire for five years. As a LEAP fellow, Alice will explore ideas around animals, suffering, motherhood, longing, and the environment in her poetry and prose.\n\nMargaret Cyr-Ohngemach\n\nJ.D. / M.E.M. 2024\n\nMargaret is a first year Joint Degree JD/MEM student at Yale School of the Environment and Pace Law School. Her professional interests include supply chain & grid decarbonization, circular economies, food/agricultural policies and ending cruel confinement. Her scholarly interests pertain to advancing and expediting rights of nature and rights of nonhumans in a generally anthropocentric society with a rapidly declining natural environment and ecological milieu. Margaret is engaged at YSE via the Center for Environmental Law and Policy, and at YLS through the Environmental Protection Clinic. Outside of school, Margaret enjoys hiking, yoga, trying new plant-based foods, skiing/snowboarding, and snuggling her two black cats.\n\nDiego Ellis Soto\n\nPh.D. (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology) 2024\n\nDiego's work lies at the intersection of using emergent technology and satellite imagery to study ecology and conservation biology. His dissertation aims to understand how sudden changes in the environment can lead to drastic responses of wildlife across the globe and whether, in turn, we can learn about environmental change through a bird’s eye view of animals themselves. For this he primarily analyzes large amounts of animal data collected from GPS collars to link these with environmental variables. He is currently exploring whether we can use animal-collected meteorological information (collected through on-board sensors deployed on animals) to predict weather. Another chapter of his dissertation assesses whether extreme events – from heatwave events up to lockdowns occurring during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic -- lead to long-term changes in wildlife behavior across the world. More broadly, Diego has been interested in bringing the humanities and the sciences closer together for the past ten years. Specifically, Diego is interested in showcasing how technology allows us to see the world through the lens of animals themselves, from their individual movements, to the sounds animals make, to an animal music opera he is currently working on. He hopes that such artistic expression increases public appreciation on the beauty of animals in the wild and the dangers they face during their day to day voyages in response to increasing human pressures and warming climates. Diego’s work has been covered by numerous news outlets, including the New York Times, BBC, ABC News, the Spanish news outlet EFE, Yahoo News, and more. He received a B.Sc. in Environmental Sciences from the University of Trier, a M.Sc. in Biological Sciences from the University of Konstanz, and a M.Sc. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Yale.\n\nGrace Engelman\n\nJ.D. 2025\n\nGrace is a first year J.D. candidate. Prior to law school, she worked for a holistic public defense organization in New York City and assisted clients with the civil legal issues that resulted from their contact with the criminal legal and family regulatory systems. She received her BA in philosophy from Brown, where she studied alternatives to retributive punishment. As a LEAP fellow, she hopes to link her background in public defense to topics in animal law and policy. She is interested in the intersection between labor justice, environmental justice, and factory farm abolition.\n\nKristy Ferraro\n\nPh.D. (Forestry & Environmental Studies) 2024\n\nKristy is a fifth year Ph.D. student in the School of the Environment. Her dissertation work focuses on how large non-human mammals impact nutrient and carbon cycles, specifically in northern ecosystems. More broadly, she is interested in how humans think about and conceptualize non-human animals, and understating how conservation scientists use, and speak on behalf of, non-human animals. Kristy received a B.S. in Philosophy and Environmental Geoscience from Boston College and an M.Sc. in Earth and Environmental Science from Vanderbilt University.\n\nRobin Happel\n\nM.E.M. / J.D. 2023\n\nRobin is a joint law student with Yale and Pace University. Previously, she worked with Earth Law Center supporting rights of nature language, and additionally served as a legal intern for the IUCN World Conservation Congress and as a member of the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund. She is a signatory to the Youth for Nature Manifesto as part of the UN Environment Programme's Major Group of Children & Youth, and additionally certified in biodiversity law through UNEP and as a Protected Species Observer under BOEM. Before starting law school, she worked in a paleontology lab and as a research assistant for the Bronx Zoo.\n\nVivian Hawkinson\n\nM.E.S.c. 2023\n\nVivian's current research uses agent-based models to examine how changes in habitat availability, connectivity, and livestock herding practices in the American West alter grey wolf, ungulate, and livestock spatial and behavioral patterns. The aim is to understand contingent landscape factors that predictively lead to or diminish carnivore-livestock conflict. As the grey wolf population continues to rebound and an increasing number of wolf packs establish home ranges across the Western United States, it will be necessary to understand what features on the landscape contribute to occurrences of conflict and what grazing practices livestock owners might implement to mitigate potential instances of predation. By contributing to this field of knowledge Vivian hope to ease financial burdens faced by livestock owners, encourage long-term, sustainable wildlife movement patterns, and assist in the recovery of the narrative surrounding grey wolves.\n\nSarah Hirschfield\n\nJ.D. 2025\n\nSarah Hirschfield is a J.D candidate at Yale Law School. She is interested in animal ethics, animal-welfare arguments for veganism, and impact investing. She received an MPhil in Philosophy from the University of Cambridge as a Gates Cambridge Scholar. Sarah holds a B.A. in Philosophy from Princeton University, where she co-founded the Princeton Vegan Society.\n\nA.J. Hudson\n\nJ.D. 2023\n\nA. J. Hudson is a JD candidate at Yale Law School and a recent MESc graduate of the Yale School of the Environment (2019). Before law school, A.J. spent five years teaching and eventually helped to found a public high school in one of the most disenfranchised, polluted, and over-policed neighborhoods in New York City. His legal work at Yale Law School seeks to redefine and redirect the body of environmental law towards the objectives of human and non-human rights, the aims of the climate justice movement, and the pressing needs of the marginalized communities he has served through the establishment of environmental minimums which protect human and non-human interests in tandem. This is both a pedagogical and professional project that pushes environmental law curriculums toward asking uncomfortable questions about systemic inequality that has been ignored for decades and challenges environmental practitioners to examine the failures of the conservation movement for people of color.\n\nMomoko Ishii\n\nPh.D. 2025 (Environmental Engineering)\n\nMomoko Ishii is a third-year PhD student of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering. Her research foci include bio-based synthetic materials and CO2 utilization. She is interested in human-animal interactions and responsible ways to engage with non-human species.\n\nEui Young Kim\n\nJ.D. 2025\n\nEui Young is a J.D. candidate at Yale Law School. She has a B.A. in philosophy from Yale College. Her interests include effective altruism, factory farming, and plant-based meat. She worked at New Haven Legal Assistance before starting law school.\n\nRebecca Landau\n\nJ.D. 2024\n\nRebecca is a JD candidate at Yale Law School.
