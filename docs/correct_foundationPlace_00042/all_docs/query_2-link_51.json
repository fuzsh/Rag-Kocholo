        "text": "The National Organic Chemistry Symposium (NOS) History\n\nThe National Organic Chemistry Symposium is the premier event sponsored by the ACS, Division of Organic Chemistry. The idea is to highlight recent advances in organic chemistry with a schedule that provides for open discussion of the science of organic chemistry. The NOS history is documented here to the best of our abilities.\n\nThe First National Symposium on Organic Chemistry was held in Rochester, N. Y., December 29 to 31, 1925, under the auspices of the Rochester Section and the Division of Organic Chemistry of the American Chemical Society.\n\nOver the years, the Division has collected photos from the various events and maintained an academic family tree of Symposium Speakers. That information and a historical perceptive, published in the Journal of Organic Chemistry, are all available for those who would like to know more about the rich history of the NOS.\n\nAcademic Family Trees of the NOS Speakers\n\nPictures for the History of NOS\n\nHistory of the NOS (Fenlon/Myers) J.
