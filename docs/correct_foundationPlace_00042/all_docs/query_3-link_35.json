        "text": "Franz Hardy serves as the Co-Managing Partner of the Denver office. He is a trial attorney with over two decades of experience. He has an active state and federal trial court practice, in addition to handling numerous precedent-setting appeals.\n\nFranz works closely with clients to develop a sound legal strategy. While recognizing that most cases resolve, he believes that creating an early litigation plan often times results in favorable resolution. This strategy involves the efficient and effective use of pre-trial tools and, if necessary, ultimately prepares the matter for trial.\n\nFranz has held various leadership positions within in the legal community, including as past president of the Denver Bar Association, past president of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Colorado, and former chair of the University of Colorado Law School Alumni Board. He has served and continues to serve on several non-profit boards. Further, as Co-Chair of the firm’s Diversity Committee, he is responsible for guiding the firm’s award-winning commitment to diversity and inclusiveness across the country.\n\nFranz is a frequent author and lecturer on various topics affecting attorneys and the practice of law, including ethics, privileges, confidentiality, and diversity."
