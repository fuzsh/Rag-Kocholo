(K&S) is the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of semiconductor assembly equipment. The company offers comprehensive assembly solutions to its many customers worldwide, including wire bonding equipment, packaging materials, and test interconnect products. According to the company, its wire bonders are used to connect very fine wires—made of gold, aluminum, or copper—between the bond pads of a semiconductor die and the leads on the integrated circuit package to which the die has been attached. K&S has an extensive network of 33 worldwide facilities which offer a wide range of sales, service and applications development. Although the company is headquartered in the sleepy town of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, it has facilities in such highly diverse and far away locations as Israel, Taiwan, China, and Switzerland. In fact, approximately 80 percent of the company's total sales volume is generated overseas.\n\nCompany Origins in 1951\n\nLike many other firms, the history of Kulicke & Soffa Industries begins with the biography of its founders, Fred Kulicke and Albert Soffa. Kulicke and Soffa were both educated as engineers and started working as employees for Proctor Electric upon their graduation from college. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Proctor Electric was a well-known company specializing in consumer electronics products. Ever since the end of World War II, with the growing prosperity of the American economy, the general public had been clamoring for more sophisticated consumer electronics products in order to make their lives more convenient. In order to meet this burgeoning demand, engineers like Kulicke and Soffa were hired to design consumer products. Shortly after the two men became employees of Proctor Electric, they found themselves designing such products as cake mixers and electric irons. In fact, it was a project to design electric irons that brought Kulicke and Soffa together for the first time.\n\nKulicke and Soffa were extremely ambitious and entrepreneurial young men, not satisfied with designing electric irons for a large company not their own. As the two men became more acquainted with one another, and started discussing their dreams and ambitions for the future, not surprisingly they discovered they had much in common. A close friendship developed as the two men worked on various projects at Proctor Electric and, after a short time, Kulicke and Soffa decided to strike out on their own and establish a custom engineering business. In the steamy month of July 1951, Fred Kulicke and Albert Soffa put their ambitions on paper and formed a partnership that was destined to last until one of them died. Thus Kulicke and Soffa Industries was born.\n\nThere was only one problem, and not a small one at that. The two men didn't have much money to start their business with. So they did what they could to raise the necessary funding, including raising loans from friends and acquaintances and pooling their own meager resources to begin operations. They established themselves in a small one-room office and began designing solutions to manufacturing problems by automating processes, while at the same time repairing broken machinery in order to pay the monthly rent and phone bills.\n\nWith their combined energy and technical ingenuity, Kulicke and Soffa aggressively contracted numerous small businesses and manufacturing firms throughout the greater metropolitan area of Philadelphia. When a packing firm approached them to stuff their sausages, the two entrepreneurs devised a machine to standardize and stuff sausage into casings in mass quantities. When a retail manufacturer asked them to design a machine to stretch kidskin for ladies' gloves, Kulicke and Soffa were only too happy to oblige with an innovative machine resulting in a significant increase in productivity and thus higher sales. Additional designs during their first years of business including innovative machines for cleaning beer cases as well as machines made to standardize the size of hamburger patties. In just of few short years, K&S became known as one of the most innovative and reliable custom engineering firms on the East Coast.\n\nBy 1956, K&S had been in business for five years. What transpired that year was to change the direction of the company's endeavors forever. The Nobel Prize in Physics was given to three engineers working at Bell Labs for the development of a semiconductor chip. Before the Nobel winners even returned home from the award ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, the manufacturing division of Bell Labs, Western Electric, had decided to contract Kulicke and Soffa Industries to develop the equipment necessary to efficiently manufacture these early versions of semiconductor chips. The two partners, thrilled with the contract, agreed to it almost without hesitation. Then reality started to sink in, and Kulicke and Soffa realized what they had agreed to, namely, accepting the challenge of connecting microscopic wires from the transistor die in the semiconductor chip to the leads on its package. Within a few months, to the surprise of the electronics industry, Kulicke and Soffa had met the challenge, designing and beginning to manufacture the world's first wire bonder. Thus the company became one of the world's first designers and manufacturers of semiconductor assembly equipment.\n\nFrom the moment the company introduced its wire bonder, it took a leading role in the semiconductor assembly equipment industry. In 1961, the owners decided that it was time to take the company public, so K&S made an initial stock offering of 100,000 shares on the NASDAQ. The company's shares were bought immediately and subsequent additional offerings were held throughout the decade. Fortunately, the partners had been at the right place at the right time and, as the semiconductor industry expanded by leaps and bounds throughout the 1960s, demand from around the world for K&S equipment skyrocketed. In addition to its legendary series of wire bonders, the company began to diversify its product line to include such items as manual and semi-automatic equipment for wafer preparation, wafer fabrication, die bonding, and micro-tools.\n\nGrowth and Expansion: 1960s–80s\n\nOne of the most important strategic decisions that the two men made early on in the organization and administration of their firm was to forge a commitment to research and development. Both owners were willing to invest more capital in research and development than was available from annual net profits. Nothing could have been smarter, since from the early 1960s, K&S became synonymous with technological leadership in the semiconductor industry. By this time, company operations had significantly outgrown the first machine shop where the two entrepreneurs spent many hours building their business, so K&S moved to larger facilities in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, while opening sales and services offices at the same time throughout the United States. Expansion was not limited to the United States. Due to the increasing demand for its products from around the world, the company established facilities in such strategic locations as Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Israel.\n\nThe mid-1970s brought with it a severe economic recession, and the semiconductor industry was hard hit. K&S suffered as a result, and the company was forced to either sell off or shutter all of its product line, except those focusing on semiconductor assembly operations. Still maintaining the priority of research and development in that core area, however, the company's engineers were able to introduce the first digitally-controlled, fully automatic wire bonders in the industry. This product, designed to operate at extremely high speeds with more accuracy and greater yield than any previous wire bonders, provided the firm's clients with the advantage of meeting the growing demand for PCS. Due to the introduction of this innovative product in 1976, Kulicke and Soffa Industries was able to recover from the losses suffered earlier and re-establish itself as the pre-eminent leader in the semiconductor assembly equipment industry.\n\nThe 1980s started well enough for K&S, and the company celebrated its 30th anniversary with much fanfare and celebration. During the early 1980s, management at the firm changed hands, but stayed in firm control of the Kulicke family. Even with this transition of leadership from one generation to the next, the company's long-term strategic goals remained the same, namely, a clear priority to research and development and a firm commitment to expanding its overseas markets. To this end in 1981, management decided to develop a major presence in the Japanese semiconductor market, which was growing by leaps and bounds at the time. Kulicke and Soffa (Japan) Ltd. opened for business in Tokyo and was soon competing with other major semiconductor assembly firms on their own turf. By 1984, company sales had reached their highest level ever.\n\nThe mid-1980s were not as kind to the fortunes of the company. The ever-volatile semiconductor industry took another severe downturn, and the new leadership was confronted with its first major financial crisis. Astute and prudent decision-making by management, however, enabled K&S to weather the gyrations of the market and continue its leadership in the industry by introducing a host of new and cutting-edge products for die bonding, wire bonding, and dicing. Such focus paid off handsomely as time went on. By the end of the 1980s, K&S had recovered financially and had introduced numerous innovative products that assured its technological leadership for years to come in the semiconductor assembly industry.\n\nCompany Perspectives:\n\nThe K&S Strategy is to provide 'best in class' packaging assembly products supporting our customers' technology and cost roadmaps.\n\nGrowth in the 1990s\n\nDuring the 1990s, the semiconductor industry grew in importance, with an accompanying worldwide dependence on K&S products. K&S profited immensely from the volume, complexity, and variety of semiconductor assembly equipment required by its ever-growing list of clients. With this explosion in the industry, the company expanded dramatically: technology centers were established in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania; Japan; Israel; and Singapore; customer resources centers were opened in Taiwan and The Philippines; Micro-Swiss facilities were constructed in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Israel; fine wire operations were built in Alabama, Singapore, and Switzerland; a new Semitic manufacturing plant was opened in California, while a state-of-the-art Flip Chip Technologies wafer bumping manufacturing center was established in Arizona; an X-LAM Technologies research and development laboratory was dedicated in California, and an Advanced Polymer Solutions manufacturing facility was built at the company's headquarters in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. The company also completed a massive 214,000-square-foot administrative, design and manufacturing facility to serve as a new headquarters to direct worldwide operations.\n\nBy 1999, K&S employed more than 2,200 people and controlled more than 50 percent of the global wire bonding equipment market. The largest supplier of semiconductor assembly equipment in the world, K&S was well-positioned to continue its dominance of the market. More than twice the size of its nearest competitor, the company was searching for ways to expand its presence in Asia and Europe, while maintaining its position of strength in the United States. As long as management continued to focus on research and development and introduced innovative products, there was no end in sight for the company's continued growth and expansion.\n\nK&S in the New Millennium\n\nK&S hit the ground running in the first year of the new millennium. Sales reached record levels—$899.3 million—in 2000. The company moved its ball bonder manufacturing to Singapore that year, anticipating significant cost reductions from the transfer of operations. It also introduced a series of new wire bonders that were considered to have the finest pitch and be the fastest in the world. K&S bolstered its holdings with the $65 million acquisition of Probe Technology Corporation and the $225 million purchase of Cerprobe Corporation The two companies were merged into K&S's new Test Interconnect operations.\n\nThe semiconductor industry proved its cyclical nature once again in 2001, leaving K&S and many of its competitors scrambling to make strategic business decisions that would cut costs and stabilize profits. The company's revenue fell sharply from the previous year, dropping to $555 million. As a result of the industry downturn, K&S laid off nearly 500 employees and shuttered its manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. It made Flip Chip Technologies a wholly owned subsidiary that year.\n\nThe slowdown continued in 2002 as revenues dropped further. The company posted a $274.1 million loss that year and was forced to rethink its expansion efforts. K&S took measures to control costs and streamline its operations—including the layoff of an additional 200 workers—and decided to focus on its wire bonders and test interface products business. The company divested its saw and hubless saw blade products line, nixed plans to develop its substrate business, and sold its Flip Chip unit in 2004.\n\nK&S opened a manufacturing facility in China in 2003. Management eyed this region as a key growth area and expanded the plant's production capabilities in 2005. In addition, a wafer test manufacturing plant began operations in Taiwan in 2004.\n\nK&S returned to profitability in 2004, a sure sign its strategy was paying off and that, perhaps, the semiconductor industry was slowly rebounding from its slump. The company launched its next generation wire bonding and stud bumping machines in 2005, which offered significant speed improvements. During this time period, the company continued to consolidate manufacturing operations while developing new state-of-the-art products. While the industry it served remained volatile, K&S had proved that it could weather difficult conditions. With a solid business plan in place, K&S management was confident the company would remain a leader in its field for years to come.\n\nPrincipal Competitors\n\nASM International N.V.; SHINKAWA Ltd.; Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.
