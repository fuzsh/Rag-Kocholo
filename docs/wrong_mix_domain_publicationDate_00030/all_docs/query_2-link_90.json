        "text": "Review: “Rebel Raider”, H. Beam Piper, 1950.\n\nReview: “Rebel Raider”, H. Beam Piper, 1950.\n\nPiper tried to get many nonfiction articles published in his lifetime, but, aside from some articles in his friends local shopping guide, he only succeeded once with this article on a famed cavalryman, Confederate Army Colonel John Mosby. It was published in True:The Men’s Magazine’s March 23, 1950 issue, and Piper was elated.\n\nJohn F. Carr’s Typewriter Killer quotes Frederik Pohl’s (Piper’s one-time agent) “The Way the Future Blogs” about the story:\n\n“=Piper was a railroad man from birth. He lived in the Western Pennsylvania rail center of those great continent-spanning lines that appeared after the Civil War. That war was important to Beam. He had strong feelings about such concepts as heroism and personal honor, and he took sides. The side he favored was the slaveholding but militarily exciting Confederacy. Mostly self-educated, Beam was thrilled by the exploits of those dashing Rebel commanders, in particular by John Mosby, the Southern cavalry officer who made parts of Virginia uninhabitable by Federal troops or sympathizers.\n\nWhen Beam mentioned to me that he had, on his own time and just for the fun of it, written a lengthy work about his hero, I reminded him of my Basic Maxim No. 1: ‘Writers write mostly for the fun of it. Agents exist to see they get money for having fun.’ So he turned the finished piece over to me, and I promptly sold ‘Rebel Raider’ for a decent amount of money.\n\nPiper was very happy to get fan mail saying he, a lifetime Pennsylvania man (apart from a brief foray in Paris), must be a Southerner.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nBetween “The Mercenaries” and this story, Piper published another Paratime story, “Last Enemy”.\n\nReview: “Flight from Tomorrow”, H. Beam Piper, 1950.\n\nPiper scholar John F. Carr call this a minor story, and he’s right from the central premise right down to it not being published in top tier Astounding Stories but the September/October 1950 issue of Future Stories. It is notable for the introduction of Piper’s A.E. dating system. That’s Atomic Era with the year zero being 1942, the year of the first controlled atomic fission event in human history. Piper would use the system in his later Terro-Human Future History. This story, though, is not part of that series.\n\nThe story opens at the end of a revolt. The rule of Hradzka, tyrant lord over our solar system, is on its last legs. The imperial palace is under attack. Hradzka can’t get to his secret spaceship and escape to still loyal colonies on Mars and in the Asteroid Belt.\n\nArmy Commander Zarvas Pol leads a group to find Hradzka in the palace. He and others fear that Hradzka will get to his time machine.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIn between “Time and Time Again” and this story, Piper had two other works published: “He Walked Around the Horses” and “Police Operation”, both part of his Paratime series.\n\nReview: “The Mercenaries”, H. Beam Piper, 1950.\n\nFirst published in the March 1950 issue of Astounding Stories, this is not part of Piper’s Terro-Human Future History.\n\nIts central idea is intriguing. It’s 1965, and the world is divided into four power blocs: “the Western Union, the Ibero-American Confederation, the Fourth Komintern and the Islamic Caliphate.”\n\nPiper sold this story in 1949, so it was not influenced by a real-world echo of its central concern: treasonous scientists. In 1950, several arrests were made in connection with Soviet penetration of the Manhattan Project – and there were many other agents not detected or arrested. The focus of this story is the disloyalty and treason of scientists working on sensitive projects of national security, and Piper anticipates the idea that some scientists will see themselves above the national loyalties they inherit.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWith the list of titles waiting to be reviewed getting longer, I decided, awhile back, to take a break and read some gaming related fiction I wasn’t going to review.\n\nI read the Arkham Horror novel The Sign of Glaaki. I’ve never played Arkham Horror. I’ve never played Traveller either, but I did run a few games for it back, decades ago, in the Classic Traveller era. So, I read Agent of the Imperium from Traveller’s creator, Marc Miller, and I read Shannon Appelcline’s The Science Fiction in Traveller: A Reader’s Guide to Traveller Role-Playing Fiction.\n\nOne of the major sources of fictional inspirations for the game was H. Beam Piper. I’ve already reviewed some of Piper’s works, and this marks the start of a series to review the rest. I’ll be looking at them in order of publication and with some material drawn from two books by Piper scholar John F. Carr: H. Beam Piper: A Biography and Typewriter Killer. I’ll also be reviewing them.\n\nReview: “Time and Time Again”, H. Beam Piper, 1947.\n\nThis was Piper’s first published fiction and appeared in the April 1947 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, and Piper would become a favorite author of its editor John W. Campbell.\n\nWhile this was Piper’s first published fiction, he had brief articles published in his friend’s Don Coleman’s free advertising circular, one of the first in America: the Williamsport Shopper’s Guide. He had written A Catalogue of Henry Wharton Shoemaker Weapons at Restless Oaks in McElhatten Pennsylvania in 1927. Shoemaker was a friend, and Piper dedicated his novel Murder in the Gunroom to Shoemaker. But Piper had also been writing fiction – science fiction, historical fiction, mysteries – for 20 years.\n\nThe story opens in 1975 during World War III and (as we learn later) the siege of Buffalo, New York. Our hero, Captain Allan Hartley of the US Army, is pulled out of the rubble from a nuclear blast ten miles away. He is wounded and not expected to live, but he is shot up with a narcotic.\n\nWhen he wakes up, he finds he has regressed to the age of 13 and is back in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. (Williamsport was a town Piper was fond of, had friends in, and eventually moved to). It is Sunday, August 5, 1945 – the day before the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. Yet, Hartley remembers his future life as a best-selling author and chemist with lucrative patents. He is convinced his memories of that life are no mere dream.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis week’s weird fiction being discussed over at LibraryThing is a tale of weird science, alienation, and medical humilation.\n\nReview: “The New Rays”, M. John Harrison, 1982.\n\nLondon seems to be our setting with the offices of Dr. Alexandre in Camden Town. The time? Well, that’s not so simple to establish. Since we hear of wounded soldiers about in the streets, maybe it’s the First World War. Maybe the Second. It could be either since there is really no mention of automobiles, only of trains.\n\nAnd it’s a train that our narrator takes from the Midlands with her husband or, perhaps, just a lover, designated only as W.B.\n\nShe is ill. With what, we don’t immediately know. It was her idea to visit Alexandre at his clinic on Agar Grove Street. The treatments are free, but she initially balks at knocking on its door though it was her idea to come. W.B is, not for the last time, impatient.\n\nFrom the beginning, Dr. Alexandre seems a weird, unsettling character. The narrator, at the clinic, meets a “beautiful crippled girl” whom Alexandra claims he can cure, but the narrator doubts it. She’s Alexandre’s interpreter. The doctor emphasizes that the narrator can’t bother the other patients and that her treatment depends on her full confidence in it.\n\nWashing his hands of her, W.B. leaves the narrator to stay at a hotel, and he returns home leaving the first of many notes indicating his and the narrator’s estrangement. It urges her to “have some thought for other people”. People calling the narrator selfish is a recurring motif in the story.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI didn’t expect to return to the Night Land so soon, but I found out about this one on Fenton Wood’s Twitter feed and bought it upon release about four months back.\n\nReview: Nightland Racer, Fenton Wood, 2021.\n\nWood states, right up front, who influenced this novel beside William Hope Hodgson and his The Night Land: “John C. Wright, Gene Wolfe, Alfred Bester, A.E. van Vogt, Philip K. Dick, Jack Vance, J.G. Ballard, Larry Niven, Frank Herbert, Cordwainer Smith, Arthur C. Clarke, Roger Zelazny, H.G. Wells, Herman Melville, Tom Wolfe, and the SCP Foundation”.\n\nPart of the fun of this novel is spotting all those influences which I think I did except for Herbert and van Vogt and the SCP Foundation whose work I am entirely unfamiliar with.\n\nThere are a few similarities in plot between Hodgson’s novel and this one. Both thrust a man into the distant future. Hodgson’s X is psychically projected into the future. The hero here is Reynard Douglas. Like his model, the real-life Junior Johnson, Douglas is a former moonshine runner turned race car driver who ran afoul of the law.\n\nThe book is something of an alternate history starting out in roughly 1984 when no less than the President shows up in person with a job offer for Douglas. They want a man to drive a vehicle into the Zone, an mysterious area that appeared years ago in the American Southwest and is expanding. (Wood credits Jon Mollison’s Barbarian Emperor as inspiration for the Zone.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis week’s piece of weird fiction being discussed over at LibraryThing is from Michael Shea.\n\nReview: “The Horror on the 33”, Michael Shea, 1982.\n\nLike Shea’s “Tsathoggua”, this story takes place in the demimonde of the homeless underclass.\n\nOur entre to this world is the unusually epistolary Knavle who sends letters to his friend, the non wino McSpittle, our narrator. That lends a certain old-fashioned flavor to this story. But it’s 1982. Knavle can’t phone or text it in.\n\nAnd, as you might guess from the narrator’s name, there is some humor in this story which is Lovecraftian flavored but not of the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nMcSpittle starts out by telling us that Knvale’s decision to become a wino was quite deliberate.\n\nEven I, his closest confidant, had been so unsupportive as to call his choice of lifestyle a “downward path.” He had mildly replied that his was no smooth downhill way; that it was far easier, in fact, to be a short-order cook (for example) or a bank president, than to be a wino; that, moreover, in being an object of compassion, he was performing a vital moral service for those more fortunate than himself who would otherwise, lacking such flagrant specimens of misery, pity only themselves.\n\nKnavle’s been a wino for about a year by the time the story begins. We get a brief account of the small and wiry Knavle’s (all the better to find an unobtrusive place to sleep it off) early life on the streets.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nLow Res Scan: The Age of Decayed Futurity: The Best of Mark Samuels, ed. Mark Samuels, 2020.\n\nI could tell you what decayed futurity means: an attack on linear time, the tyranny of repetition, the entropic static of the future rolling into our world. Or, as Michael Dirda’s “Introduction” tells you:\n\nSamuels’s favorite tropes include dreams, derelict or labyrinthine buildings, run-down European cities, subtle infection and contamination, mandalas, the dead alive, a pervasive sense of alienation, and the quiet desperation of the corporate world.\n\nWe’re both right, but grocery lists of dressed up nouns tell you nothing of what the stories are like. Most buildings have doors, but the experience of entering them is very different. The places Samuels takes us to, the stories he tells may have certain similarities, certain repetition of imagery and plot, but the impression they leave is often different – though, it must be admitted, doom usually awaits.\n\nI wondered if it were the case that some dim intimation had come to him during his architect days as to the final destiny of his project: to house his own personal nightmare, to create a zone where human beings could not live.\n\nSo ponders our narrator, an amnesiac architect, in “Mannequins in Aspects of Terror” after he’s invited to an art installation by Golmi.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe menace is something unique in this week’s weird story being discussed over at LibraryThing.\n\nReview: “Where the Summer Ends”, Karl Edward Wagner, 1980.\n\nThe setting is Wagner’s hometown, Knoxville, Tennessee. Wagner gives us the South in its hot, humid summer days. In particular, he vividly and verdantly recreates the portion of town around the local univerisity with its rundown buildings, student apartment made out of converted Victorian and Edwardian, and, particularly the many vacant, kudzu-covered vacant lots around Grand Avenue which have not even been rebuilt after the buildings have disappeared from them.\n\nProtagonist Mercer, part-time art student and part-time construction worker, wants a mahogeny mantle from junk and antiques dealer Gradie. Gradie lives on Grand Avenue, an old time resident after all the other buildings were abandoned.\n\nIn fact, Gradie made money on the decline of the neighborhood. He would make a deal with the city for salvage rights for anything in the abandoned buildings and his partner Morny would do the actual demolition. Often, a fire would mysteriously burn down the structure before its demolition was complete. The city seemed to tacitly go along with this arson by Gradie and Morny.\n\nContinue reading →"
