        "text": "And so we begin Gene Wolfe’s monumental The Book of the New Sun.\n\nToday is the first post in this slow read of The Book of the New Sun. If you would prefer not to receive emails for this slow read, you can adjust your settings by going here: radicaledward.substack.com/account.\n\nAnyway, let’s briefly go over the events of the chapter:\n\nSeverian, our narrator, tells us he nearly drowned just moments ago, and he and his friends are heading back home. They come to a locked gate with no guard. When a volunteer is spotted and hailed, he opens the door a crack and Eata sprints past them, which allows all of them entry. The volunteers are worried about grave robbers. And then there’s an eruption of violence and our narrator gets separated from his group of friends and the volunteers and witnesses a man named Vodalus robbing a grave. Vodalus is caught and must fight the volunteers. Here, the narrator helps him and then names himself a follower of Vodalus, who then gives him a coin and leaves on a flying ship.\n\nSimple enough, yes?\n\nBut that’s not why we’re reading this together. If a book was only about what happens, you could get all that by yourself—mostly, at least for now—but we’re here to dig into the book.\n\nSo let’s return to that poem that begins the novel.\n\nIt comes from Our God, Our Help by Isaac Watts. Despite this being my third time reading this, I never before bothered to see who wrote that. Since it goes uncredited, I suppose I assumed Wolfe wrote it.\n\nWhat we need to know about Watts, to the extent we need to know anything, is that he was a very prolific and famous writer of hymns. You may have even sung one of them at church at some point in your life. Like many men of letters in the 18th century, he was also a logician, and apparently a very influential one.\n\nNow, the question must arise, Why did Wolfe include this hymn, uncredited?\n\nI’ll say this: nothing in the book is accidental. More than that, everything between the covers of the novel is part of the novel. We’ll talk about that more when we get to the appendix in a few months, but just know that the text of the novel has already begun, even before this first chapter.\n\nBut, again, we’ll discuss this more when we get to the Appendix.\n\nWhat strikes me each time I read this novel is the atmospheric hook of these first few chapters. The world seems both enormous and shrouded in darkness. We have names thrown out here, a whole world and society implied, with stratifications and roles, yet we understand nothing yet, and our Severian isn’t telling much until it’s relevant to him.\n\nThere are several schools of worldbuilding, but they can largely be boiled down to those who teach us about the world upfront or as we go and those that use more of a sink or swim method.\n\nWolfe is the latter.\n\nAnd so information is only doled out when our narrator, Severian, believes it matters. Because he’s narrating this story, too, and he’s a person living in this world, he sometimes doesn’t explain things, because why would he? If you were telling a story, would you digress to explain who the president is and how he came to be president? Would you explain the history of where you live when you bring up your hometown in conversation?\n\nSeverian is a person in this world and so many of the questions you have are about things that are so common that he sees no reason to even spend a moment explaining it, even in the briefest detail.\n\nBut let’s return to the beginning.\n\nWhat a way to begin a novel! Especially since this whole first chapter is full of foreboding. There’s an ambient dread and danger to the whole chapter. At least for me. It reminds me—and many others—of playing a game like Dark Souls or Bloodborne or Elden Ring, where you’re stepping into an unfamiliar, dark, dangerous world.\n\nBut he continues.\n\nJust bathe in the luxury of this prose, babies. We go from the rusted gates to the fog to metaphor to symbol of exile. And so Severian is telling us a lot here, but he’s rushing past it, dropping details of his future even as he’s telling us of his past. Also, curiously to us, that he was a torturer’s apprentice.\n\nHe’s also explicitly explaining that he is constructing this narrative. He’s not telling us that he’s beginning his story at the beginning or even the most important moment in his life or even the moment that set him on course to have the live he had. Instead, he’s beginning with a symbol of his exile.\n\nThis tells us something important about Severian. Not only is he constructing this story for an audience, but he’s constructing it with a mind to metaphor, with presentiment to where he will eventually go.\n\nTo jump, now, to the end of the chapter:\n\nSo we begin with an intuitive feeling or foreboding about the rest of his life and we end this first chapter with him telling us that he now sits upon a throne.\n\nSo consider this as we read.\n\nSeverian is constructing a story for his audience that explains how he came to his throne.\n\nWhich is to say that Severian is telling this story for a very specific purpose and with a goal in mind for the reader, and that reader is a person within the world of the novel.\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe meet, briefly, Roche, Drotte, and Eata, and these volunteers who are prowling a graveyard to keep graverobbers away. We come to protect our own dead, says the leader of the volunteers.\n\nSuch a curious construction. Our own dead.\n\nPerhaps this becomes clearer when we first see Vodalus and his crew, who Severian describes as exlutants. A word, as yet, without contextual meaning. But we can assume there’s a social stratification here by simply looking at the word. Too, Severian uses this term to highlight the man’s accent, which further demonstrates some social stratification.\n\nThe volunteers speak the way Severian and his friends speak, which is why he makes no comment of it. Severian is an apprentice torturer and these men are volunteers protecting their dead, which seems like the potential bottom of a socioeconomic ladder.\n\nThe exultants are stealing a dead body from a grave and they’re willing to kill for it. Their accents also are noticeable enough that Severian comments upon it.\n\nSeverian spends the bulk of this chapter observing these exultants. Thea, Vodalus, and an unnamed third. Only when Vodalus is about to be killed does Severian shift from a passive agent in this entire chapter to an active one. And when he shifts, he kills one of the volunteers.\n\nAll this took place in dark and fog. I saw it, but for the most part the men were no more than ambient shadows—as the woman with the heart-shaped face had been. Yet something touched me. Perhaps it was Vodalus’s willingness to die to protect her that made the woman seem precious to me; certainly it was that willingness that kindled my admiration for him. many times since then, when I have stood upon a shaky platform in some market-town square with Terminus Est at rest before me and a miserable vagrant kneeling at my feet, when I have heard in hissing whispers the hate of the crowd and sensed what was far less welcome, the admiration of those who find an unclean joy in pains and deaths not their own, I have recalled Vodalus at the graveside, and raised my own blade half pretending that when it fell I would be striking for him.\n\nHe stumbled, as I have said. In that instant I believe my whole life teetered in the scales with his.\n\nI find Severian’s narration intoxicating, honestly, and this will keep us all going or it’ll cause you to shipwreck against these sentences and amble off towards different writers with simpler, clearer styles. But I love the way time slips and flows and leaps back and forth for Severian, for it’s something that mirrors my own experience of being alive.\n\nI’ve read that all time is now and I have felt that acutely often, and especially at moments like this, when I felt my entire world shifting, my entire life twisting towards or away from something.\n\nFor Severian, he gives us an explanation why the world feels this way to him.\n\nIt is my nature, my joy and curse, to forget nothing. Every rattling chain and whistling wind, every sight, smell, and taste, remains changeless in my mind, and though I know it is not so with everyone, I cannot imagine what it can mean to be otherwise, as if one had slept when in fact an experience is merely remote.\n\nI’ve written about this aspect of memory in two places, which may be of interest to readers, here, of my own life and how memory has dictated the way I experience the world. Example One and Two.\n\nBut we must keep in mind that Severian is telling us all of this for a reason. And so it is worth asking why Severian wants us to know that he forgets nothing. Perhaps, to give weight to his own story and to stand as an impartial witness to his own life?\n\nWho can say.\n\nUpon saving Vodalus, telling him that he is a Vodalarius, One of the thousands of Vodalarii of whose existence you are unaware, he digresses.\n\nWe believe that we invent symbols. the truth is that they invent us; we are their creatures, shaped by their hard, defining edges. When soldiers take their oath they are given a coin, an asimi stamped with the profile of the Autarch. Their acceptance of that coin is their acceptance of the special duties and burdens of military life—they are soldiers from that moment, though they may know nothing of the management of arms. I did not know that then, but it is a profound mistake to believe that we must know of such things to be influenced by them, and in fact to believe so is to believe in the most debased and superstitious kind of magic. The would-be sorcerer alone has faith in the efficacy of pure knowledge; rational people know that things act of themselves or not at all.\n\nWe learn much of the world here.\n\nThere is an Autarch and we can assume what that means from the word itself. We also see, in this acceptance of the coin, that Vodalus is some other political faction and possibly even a military faction rising against the Autarch or perhaps rivaling the Autarch.\n\nWe also learn through Severian that this acceptance of the coin from Vodalus has made him a Vodalarius, a Vodalarii, and this set him on the long journey to become, himself, the Autarch.\n\nBut what we see from Severian, at least in his narration, is a boy, an apprentice, who observes and follows. And then, at crucial moments, leaps forward and acts. First, to save Vodalus. Second, by claiming to be one of his followers, though he knows nothing of Vodalus.\n\nThus I knew nothing, as the coin dropped into my pocket, of the dogmas of the movement Vodalus led, but I soon learned them all, for they were in the air. With him I hated the Autarchy, though I had no notion of what might replace it. With him, I despised the exultants who failed to rise against the Autarch and bound the fairest of their daughters to him in ceremonial concubinage. With him I detested the people for their lack of discipline and a common purpose.\n\nIn an instant, he adopts all these attitudes, not out of some moral reasoning or even a logical one.\n\nBut by the brute logic that he saved Vodalus and so must now be a devotee to the cause.\n\nAnd rather than declare and describe, with his perfect memory, what it means to be a Vodalarii or what Vodalus wanted, he describes the adoption of an attitude to life. He is not for something, here, but against the status quo under the Autarch, of whom he also knows nothing.\n\nNow, there are hundreds of others things we could’ve spent time on with this chapter, like the physical moments, or the way Severian’s narrative digresses often to his interior beliefs and thoughts, but I think this will best serve us moving forward.\n\nNow, as I said long ago, I am not an expert in Wolfe. I have read this series twice, though, so I’m at least familiar with the shape of this narrative.\n\nBut feel free to challenge my interpretation, not only here, but moving forward. Ask whatever questions you have about this or that, what stuck out to you, etc.\n\nNext week, we’ll be discussing Chapters II and III, and we’ll learn more about Severian."
