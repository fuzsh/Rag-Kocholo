        "text": "I have already mentioned my fondness for short stories, but more briefly than I intended, so let me say some more on the subject.\n\nDetective Stories\n\nI am a huge fan of detective stories. My favourite detective is Father Brown, the star of 53 short stories by G. K. Chesterton. I have several favourites among those, including “The Oracle of the Dog,” “The Blast of the Book,” “The Crime of the Communist,” and “The Honour of Israel Gow.” But perhaps the best one is the first one, “The Blue Cross,” which alternates between comedy and philosophy:\n\n“Reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star. Look at those stars. Don’t they look as if they were single diamonds and sapphires? Well, you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please. Think of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants. Think the moon is a blue moon, a single elephantine sapphire. But don’t fancy that all that frantic astronomy would make the smallest difference to the reason and justice of conduct. On plains of opal, under cliffs cut out of pearl, you would still find a notice-board, ‘Thou shalt not steal.’” …\n\n“Has it never struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men’s real sins is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil? But, as a matter of fact, another part of my trade, too, made me sure you weren’t a priest.” “What?” asked the thief, almost gaping. “You attacked reason,” said Father Brown. “It’s bad theology.”\n\nWestern Stories\n\nI am also a big fan of Westerns. Elisabeth Grace Foley is my favourite Western writer, and her latest short story collection The Smoking Iron and Other Stories has just been released (I read it recently; it’s superb). However, my favourite of her stories has got to be “The Bird of Dawning”:\n\nA million diamonds glinted in the smooth, untouched white curve of snow in the basin, struck out by the sun that pierced the bright silver-white sky. The bitter wind whisked across it, kicking up little powdery swirls. Cal Rayburn turned up the collar of his sourdough coat with one hand, hunching his shoulders a little so the collar half covered his ears. He squinted at the blinding-bright landscape, and one side of his cold-numbed lips twisted back a little in a half-smile. Not another human being for miles, but still he fancied he could feel an odd festivity in the air. …\n\nScience Fiction Stories\n\nThere are many wonderful science fiction short stories out there, by Ursula Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, and Connie Willis, among others. But my favourites would have to be the stories of Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (writing as Cordwainer Smith) – stories strange almost beyond imagining – of which the best is perhaps “The Dead Lady of Clown Town,” a retelling of the death of Joan of Arc, and an exploration of what it means to be human:\n\nA ruby trembled. Two tourmaline nets failed to rectify the laser beam. A diamond noted the error. Both the error and the correction went into the general computer. …\n\nThis is where the picture-tape ends, but we can imagine how the scene was concluded. Elaine had stopped short, just behind the sergeant-robot. The other robots had come up behind her. Charley-is-my-darling had stopped talking. Joan was in the act of lifting her hands in blessing, her warm brown dog eyes gone wide with pity and understanding.\n\nFantasy Stories\n\nThere are too many great fantasy short stories to count, but among them are the traditional fairy tales, so perhaps I can let “The Golden Key” stand as a representative of the class:\n\nThe sun was now set, and the darkness coming on, but the child thought of no danger but the bears behind her. If she had looked round, however, she would have seen that she was followed by a very different creature from a bear. It was a curious creature, made like a fish, but covered, instead of scales, with feathers of all colours, sparkling like those of a humming-bird. It had fins, not wings, and swam through the air as a fish does through the water. Its head was like the head of a small owl.\n\nHow about my readers? What is your favourite short story?"
