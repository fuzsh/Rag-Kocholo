        "text": "As an out author of fiction and nonfiction books, it is an unnerving time to be writing books about queer and trans lives and experiences. In fact, a recent report from the American Library Association (ALA) found that a record-high 4,240 book titles were targeted for banning in schools and public libraries in 2023, a 65% increase in bans from the year before. LGBTQ+ books are frequently targeted in these bans, making it more important than ever to read and spread the word about books by and about the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nI started writing queer books because I couldn’t find stories that reflected the genderqueer/trans and gritty queer experiences of my communities. There have been few experiences more powerful for me as an author than visiting high school and college classrooms and hearing queer students reflect on how meaningful it was to see their lives and stories on the page. This is what makes the current wave of book bans targeting queer books even more dangerous. When we don’t see ourselves in books and other media, it’s hard to believe that we are valid and have a right to exist.\n\nDuring Pride month, a lot of attention turns to LGBTQ+ culture, including its artists, creators and authors. For one colorful month, products as diverse as t-shirts and bagels are reimagined in a rainbow motif in a nod toward supporting (and earning money from) the LGBTQ+ community. But this largely corporate visibility during Pride month, known as rainbow washing, shouldn't be a 30-day limited engagement, especially as our rights are under attack. Instead of just reading gay books during Pride, challenge yourself to expand the diversity of books you read all year long.\n\nThis list contains books by gay, lesbian, trans and queer authors as well as fantastic reads with characters from across the LGBTQ+ rainbow of identities. These books inspire us, give us hope and show that our literary worlds can (and should!) be as beautifully diverse as the one we live in.\n\nSo whether you’re a fan of thrillers and crime, romance novels, humor, classics or new releases and literary fiction, we’ve got you covered. Add them all to your own TBR list, or pick up a handful as the perfect gift for the book-lover in your life. And once you're done here, head on over to the GH Book Club to check out even more feel-good reads."
