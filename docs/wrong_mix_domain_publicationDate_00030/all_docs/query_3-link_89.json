        "text": "\"Sexy and darkly funny, at its core this novel turns preconceived notions about mental health, obsession, and trauma upside down.\" âRachel Sonis, Time's Must-Read Books of 2023\n\n\"A hilarious, dark and quirky coming-of-middle-age story.\" âNPR, Best Books of 2023\n\nâOne of the funniest books of the last few years. . . . Beagin may sooner be hotter than a farm-to-table restaurant in a bougie upstate town, but her work will be around much longer. . . . both timely and ultimately transcendent.â âThe Los Angeles Times\n\nâIt's wild, it's hilarious, and it's so good.ââCosmopolitan, Best Books of 2023 (So Far)\n\n\"An incredible book. . . I couldn't put it down.\" âJodie Comer\n\n\"The funniest fiction Iâve read all year... This deliciously eccentric sex comedy bristles with wit and weirdness, but beneath all the antics is a tender heart.\" âAlexandra Schwartz, The New Yorker\n\n\"A zany, raunchy, dark novel about a transcriptionist and her explosive love affair that's incredibly well-written and very smart about the weirdness of human nature.â âCurtis Sittenfeld, author of Romantic Comedy\n\n\"Wild and inventive . . . Beaginâs book is funny, dark, and dives into the messiness of infidelity, desires, and sexual stereotypes, all told through her two tortured protagonists.\" âHuffington Post, Best Books of 2023\n\nâA fantastic, weird-as-hell, super funny novel.â âBustle\n\nâ[Beaginâs] most exciting book yet . . . [an] idiosyncratic love story . . . wrenching and hilarious.ââNew York Magazine\n\nâAlways interesting and frequently hilarious . . . the ride is too fun to stop.â âAnthony Breznican, Vanity Fair\n\n\"Darkly comic.\" âNew Yorker, Best Books of 2023\n\n\"Beagin writes with a zany, overflowing energy. . . . Big Swiss is a comic novel, but it is one with a very tender core.\" âVogue, Best Books of 2023\n\nâBeagin may have found the best vehicle yet for her nihilist whimsy.â âEntertainment Weekly, Most Anticipated Books of Winter 2023\n\n\"Weird and horny and unfettered in all the best ways.\" âThe Millions, Most Anticipated Books of 2023\n\nâBeaginâs black comedy is a laugh-out-loud bad romance for Gen Xers and an ode to misfits who just want to belong. . . . If you have a weakness for gossip, this clever and sneakily insightful book is all about the guilty pleasure of peering into other people's private lives.â âOprah Daily\n\n\"Outlandish . . . quirky, darkly humorous. . . . One of the biggest literary hits of 2023.\" âTimes Union\n\nâErotic cottagecore as only Jen Beagin can do it.â âElectric Lit\n\nâDelightfully bizarre, darkly humorous . . . the storyâs oddity is as beguiling as the voyeuristic itch it scratches.\" âWall Street Journal\n\n\"This funny, offbeat story asks questions about telling the truth, falling in love, and who we really are when no one else is lookingâor so we think.\" âTown & Country, Best Books of 2023 (So Far)\n\n\"This unconventional love story has a surplus of appeal from page one.\" âPublishers Weekly\n\n\"Beagin returns with another wonderfully off-kilter protagonist. . . . Big Swiss establishes her place among artfully eccentric writers like Nell Zink, Elif Batuman, and Jennifer Egan.\" âKirkus\n\nâBig Swiss is a dark party; a hilarious romp through new age pop psychology, romantic obsession, sapphic acrobatics, dogs, and the desire to end it all. Beaginâs voice is an engine all its own, and I delighted in this cynical, sexy, hopeless, hopeful, Hudson Valley jubilee. Come for the bees, stay for the donkeys!â âMelissa Broder, author of Milk Fed\n\n\"I chugged this book! Pick it up because you like cheese, stay for the brilliant sentences. Beagin channels everything evil, hot, intimate, and funny about spying on people while secretly hoping to get caught. By the end youâll be so in love youâll want to move to Hudson yourself, no matter how messy it gets.\" âBeth Morgan, author of A Touch of Jen"
