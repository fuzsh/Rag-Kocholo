        "text": "Our Cordwainer Smith discussion twanged like a rubber rock band! We’ve read Cordwainer Smith before, but wanted to drill down a little deeper. For good background information, below is a link to a 2018 piece in Johns Hopkins Magazine on Smith. He was raised at a tense and interesting historical double crossroads between American Western and Chinese Eastern, as well as Dynastic China giving way to Communist China.\n\nhttps://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2018/fall/cordwainer-smith-paul-linebarger/\n\nIn a letter to his agent, Linebarger explained that his stories “intended to lay bare the human mind, to throw torches over the underground lakes of the human soul, to show the chambers wherein the ageless dramas of self-respect, God, courage, sex, love, hope, envy, decency, and power go on forever.”\n\nSmith’s real name (though he had many) was Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger. His father was Paul Myron Wentworth Linebarger, a U.S. judge in the Philippines who became an early financial supporter and legal adviser to Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Republic of China. Cordwainer’s father made sure he was born in the U.S.A., but was soon after brought to China, and christened Lin Bah Loh (Forest of Incandescent Bliss). Sun Yat-sen was his godfather. Young Paul would spend most of his childhood either in China or in a boarding school in Hawaii. At the latter, he lost his eye in a nasty tussle with a fellow student. His adolescent imagination was active, instead of a journal he kept a notebook of alternate identities for himself, like a young Jason Bourne. He grew up to work in the military and with CIA intelligence, mostly in creating anti-communist propaganda for the Chinese.\n\nA lot of the subtext of reading Smith is the knowledge that he was a careerist of psychological warfare, particularly during the Cold War era. We’re talking about a time when the U.S. military was testing hallucinogenics on human subjects, often with the goal of weaponizing them. So there are some weird psychological hints in his writing that imply Smith may be blowing off steam about some disturbing things he’s seen in his line of work that he can’t actually talk about.\n\nIt looks like Cordwainer Smith prefigured lots of stuff. Here are some quality books and movies that were recommended during this discussion:\n\nTrue Names (1968) by Vernor Vinge. (imagined the internet, particularly trolls and hackers wreaking havoc and the cops try to find them)\n\nThe Forever War (1974) by Joe Haldeman (a Vietnam era sci-fi)\n\nThe Overstory (2018) by Richard Powers (culture civilization in the canopy of trees)\n\nAdiamante (1996) – L.E. Modesitt Jr. (a planetary defense system like the kittons, and hate-filled invaders)\n\nFilm: A Face In The Crowd, starring Andy Griffith (as you’ve never seen him before). Strongly recommended by Meg.\n\nNow, the notes!\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nScanners Live In Vain\n\nMeg: His first published story, 1950. This story was published last resort in a rinky dink sci-fi magazine. Then it was anthologized by Frederick Pohl, and that’s when Smith’s career started.\n\nNowell: Please, stop saying “cranch.”\n\nMartel can’t hear. He’s deaf by interface. The scanners are separated from their physiology and interact with it via machines. Sort of like remote avatar mech fighting.\n\nScanners have awareness without senses. They use a “talking finger” with abbreviations that resemble texting. “Is Vmct mad?”\n\n“Bzz Bzz. Ha ha. Gd ol’ boy.”\n\nlolz\n\nNot exactly an avatar mech body, but a body modified, all functions routed through a control panel before reaching the brain.\n\nCordwainer Smith had a false eye and was nearly blind in the other. He taught his students: Notice everything, but be prepared for surprises. Then he’d pop out his eye and freak them out.\n\nNice twist: a new technology that will make scanners obsolete.\n\nSo, a scanner revolt is brewing. Who is the master and who is the slave?\n\nIn the Instrumentality of Mankind interstellar travel, genetically preserved humans, and a sub-class of homunculus. The humans aren’t cyborg at all. They get super old because they travel interstellar.\n\nHabermans and scanners man the interstellar ships while cryogenically protected humans sleep. They are like the spiced-out space folding pilots in Dune.\n\nNowell: It’s interesting to read this Cold War era sci-fi because it gives glimpses into a world we didn’t live in. Reading contemporary sci-fi we can see todays concerns reflected – the climate, government stability – it’s a little on the nose for me. But here in the old sci-fi we see the social concerns of the Cold War era.\n\nThe scanners fancy themselves their own elite class and always exist in a temporal state, an inhuman fugue state. Only Martel, who is cranched at the meeting, has the human sense to see the revolt is wrong.\n\nHumans can communicate better than scanners. In the Insturmentality, it appears that humans are telepathic.\n\nThe scanners are so isolated that they aren’t as important as they think they are. Stone is not afraid of the scanner at all, and barely believes that one wants to kill him. The scanners are a small fringe, perhaps.\n\nWhat has Smith seen? What does he hint at that the average American does not know? Like about toppling cels and fringe governments?\n\nWhat’s the difference between a haberman and a scanner? The haberman cuts are reversible. And by the end, so are the scanner cuts now. All scanners can be human again. They didn’t live in vain! 🙂 (Except the one he killed to save Adam Stone.)\n\nThe Ballad Of Lost C’mell\n\nThe quirk is pronounced.\n\nNowell: Damn dude, you went there.\n\nSuhail: To make it a little kookier, C’Mell is inspired by one of Smith’s household cats, named “Cat Melanie.”\n\nThis speaks to Smith’s tendency to tweak a plot point, like cat-gene geisha girls.\n\nWhat capitalism can/will become:\n\np.2 “If they became bankrupt, they went to the Poorhouse, where they were killed painlessly by means of gas.”\n\nMeg: He mixes tones and registers. A lot of it is very pulpy, yet there’s a different flavor.\n\nAnother revolt theme, like in “Scanners Live In Vain.” How many insurgent cels did Smith ferret out?\n\nThe animal stock bred underhumans are the new frontier of civil rights. Civil rights conflict is always defusing otherness. Being genetically unmodified is a sign of superiority.\n\nLet’s discuss the Instrumentality. What is it like? Fascist? Utopian? Why is it so hard to tell the difference?\n\nC’mell, the “girlygirl” is a translation of an Asian concept. A geisha’s world.\n\n“You may be working for Earth but don’t ever get the idea that you’re as good as a person.”\n\nJestocost and C’mell – who’s the master and who’s the slave? Gets a little under your skin then veers off.\n\nIt feels like he’s, in part, processing his career in military intelligence and his own life being raised in China, himself growing up as an other.\n\n“There’s a special sort of majesty to kindness. It’s the best part of being people.”\n\nWas intel bureaucracy like this? Bureaucratic maneuverings and meetings (in both stories “C’mell” and “Scanners“). More meetings and discussions than actions. But he gets away with it by having so many tiny reveals and subtexts.\n\nWestern Science Is So Wonderful\n\nSpy vs. spy stuff about telepathy and psychological manipulation.\n\nMeg: It’s baffling.\n\nNowell: An American, a German, and a Russian walk into a Martian demon…\n\nMeg: The thin boundary between science and magic depends on your cultural perspective.\n\nHow does this fit into some kind of anti-Communist vein we’d expect from Smith’s work? What have scholars said about this?\n\nThe Martian with a fetish for lighters changes himself into a solid gold milk truck?\n\nAs Meg said: It’s baffling.\n\nThe Good Friends\n\nGive me a break. 🙂 Why does this era of sci-fi hate women so much? (This will come up in The Calculating Stars, by the way, which is set in the 1950s, but from a feminist perspective.)\n\nHypo kits? Intravenous drug, and safety apparatus like a mask.\n\nUnderwhelming. It seemed like it was part of a tragedy.\n\nMeg: Great setup with doctor and nurse and the shot. It seems nefarious. Is it a psy-ops thing? Is he being interrogated? Nope, falls flat.\n\nWhat was in that shot? What about the nurse? It’s the girl that’s going to cry, of course.\n\nMeg: A story that rode on a single concept but not much was done with it plot-wise.\n\nA stranded space traveler is suffering from hallucinogenic madness after 20 years on isolation. Imaginary friends and lots of drugs.\n\nMother Hittons Little Kittons (1961)\n\nCat and mouse. So much cloak and dagger. Them (the instrumentality) being so many steps ahead of this off-world thief/assassin.\n\nWhat is this name about? 🙂 Benjacomin Bozart. Benjacomin’ to get ya’!\n\nBenjacomin is from a planet of thieves. But the Norstralians were already ahead of him. Some of the spies were unaware that some of the spies were their allies.\n\nBenjacomin is cultishly charasmatic, but all for naught. He kills a child for information, he’s viscous. Comforts the mother. Evil so near, a flash away. A predator of children. That Cordwainer way of suddenly and briefly turning the dial to 11. Dark side assassin. It’s like Smith knows people like this.\n\nWoah. “He who controls the spice…” kind of stuff.\n\nNorstrailia made a youth drug: santaclara, or “stroon.”\n\n“With treasure like this, the Norstralians owned an unimaginable world whose resources overreached all conceivable limits of money. They could buy anything. They could pay with other peoples’ lives.”\n\nOh fuck. Like the Sacklers.\n\nMeg: A mixture of all that animal energy focused and projected outward.\n\nA real paper book, with an entry [which we later learned was falsified by agents] about Benjamin Hitton, who made the Norstarlian defense system possible.\n\nHint at space propulsion technology. Is this a “warp” drive?\n\nSpace passengers are sedated for travel.\n\nEach “world” is a country.\n\nPKDesque stuff, drawing from his professional life. Spies and double agents, Cold War operative stuff.\n\nHeh. Taking down political leaders, in a nutshell. “The agent, in his turn had been seduced years before, debauched in the middle of his career, forced into temporary honesty, blackmailed and sent home. ”\n\nMisinformation, propagandization, pervasive and subtle. False encyclopedia entry.\n\nDavid, did PKD express any interest in, or influence from, Cordwainer Smith?\n\nThey were contemporaries, but worked in different idioms. Smith died in 1966, just as Dick’s career was taking off. Smith seems nostalgic for the pulps and wants to relive his youth.\n\nNowell: We need our Dick-Head! Call in the Dick-Head.\n\nOlympians are naturally blind. They’re all like Jordi LaForge!\n\nEven though Benjacomin is plying his evil, Norstralia’s on the case.\n\n“Sin is a lot of work. The sheer effort it requires often shows in the human face.”\n\nMeg: This story feels like the most polished of the ones we’ve read. “Western Science” seemed like a draft, a lark written by the seat of his pants. But this one is more refined.\n\nAn Old North Australia sea shanty. “Stroon” grows on sheep.\n\nMother Hitton has backups. Kittons: wild killing animals bred from mink stock. The kittons’ rage empowers an emphatic satellite defense system relayed off the moon. [This is a lot like Adiamante with the ruthless planetary defense system powered by psionics.]\n\n“Pin-lighters.” The pilots from “Game of Rat and Dragon.”\n\nBenjacomin mink-attacked! The mink hunger and bloodlust infuses his psyche and he destroys himself in a blind rage. He rips out his left eyeball. (Cordwainer is one-eyed.)\n\nThis is that sore tooth smith plays with, Those dark places inside a person’s own psyche that can literally destroy the person. That realm of psychological warfare. Turning the person against itself. Like “the revolutionary,” in Gene Wolfe’s Shadow Of The Torturer.\n\nTurns out Benjacomin was never a step ahead of the Norstralians.\n\nAnd Viola Siderea (Benjacomin’s home planet of thieves and assassins.) is in debt to Norstralia for ever. Not just for a mink satellite counter assassination, but an economic assassination as well. Norstralia hits with a heavy hammer.\n\nRecalls what Meg said about the way Smith mixes tones. Hokey, yet gruesome.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nThank you for reading.
