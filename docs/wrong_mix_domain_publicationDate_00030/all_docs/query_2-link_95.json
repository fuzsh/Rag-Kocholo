        "text": "Is it possible you're remembering The Status Civilization (1960) by Robert Sheckley?\n\nThe protagonist was somehow framed/brainwashed into believing himself a murderer, so turned himself in to the authorities and was sent to Omega, a prison planet.\n\nOmega is run by the exiled prisoners, and is extremely violent; the life expectancy of new prisoners is only 3 years. The yearly Games might fit your recollection of a gladiatorial Arena, though in this case Barrent is forced to compete.\n\nAfter winning the Games, Barrent is gathered by an underground group who help him sneak onto the next prisoner transport, which may be the spaceship you recall. He finds himself alone in the crew part, the ship being completely automatic, evades the check patrols on the way to Earth, and then walks off to try to figure out what happened to him, and carry out the mission of the underground group.\n\nYou can read the entire story on Project Gutenberg.\n\nYou may be remembering Jack L. Chalker's Four Lords of the Diamond series. The protagonist(s) are four prisoners whose minds were wiped and overwritten by the mind of an agent sent to investigate each of the four inhabitable planets of the Warden system, a system where people were just dumped because once they were there they couldn't leave without dying.\n\nThe end of the series featured the agent in question meeting with his four mental clones on the ship from where he's been monitoring them in the system.\n\nAnother possibility is a series rather than a single novel - the family d'Alembert series by E.E. \"Doc\" Smith. The protagonists work for SOTE - the Service Of The Empire. Male protagonist Jules with his wife get themselves arrested and sent to a prison planet to investigate a conspiracy.\n\nThey are in the auditorium for the crowning of the Crown Princess Edna.\n\nIn the last novel, they have to destroy a computer complex based in an asteroid.\n\nI don't know if this is the one your thinking of, but I have read Chistopher Stasheff's 1983 book Escape Velocity, the prequel to the Warlock of Gramarye series.\n\nIt has a prison planet where a more 'primitive' tribe lives, and the prisoners (who are, indeed, dumped there) fight scheduled non-lethal 'wars' with (the protagonist and a visitor spectated one of them). I do believe the protagonist was a fall guy for some other person's scheme, and they eventually ended up leaving the planet with a girl, and dismantling the corrupt government.\n\nhttps://www.fantasticfiction.com/s/christopher-stasheff/escape-velocity.htm\n\nI'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but it's what I remember that is similar. Hope it helps.\n\nVery long shot, Night's Dawn Trilogy (1999)\n\nIt features prison planets, though none of the action takes place in them. A secondary character is dumped into one of them at the end of the trilogy.\n\nMain antagonist is a forced labor exile in a backwater primitive world after been framed by his gang boss. Similar to a prison planet, except it involves forced slavery to help initiate a colony. He is a true and veritable criminal of the worst kind, no positive feature redeeming him.\n\nTrilogy finishes with main protagonist interacting with an AI hosted in an artificial naked singularity in deep space.\n\nI believe the book is The City and the Stars by Arthur Clarke. The main character is Alvin and the people of his city are afraid to leave the city Diaspar. The people are trapped by their own fear of open spaces which also includes fear of space travel.\n\nThe computer is not a computer but actually a pure mentality named Vanamode created by the Galactic empire which mankind was part of.\n\nThe ampitheater was during the last part of the book where the memories of the pure mentality were examined for the purpose of finding out the true history of the galactic empire and what happened to the empire."
