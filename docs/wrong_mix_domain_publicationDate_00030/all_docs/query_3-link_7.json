        "text": "September 5, 2023\n\nICONIC, AMAZING, OUT OF THIS WORLD, INCREDIBLE….I could go on and on. The most perfect dark rom com. I have really enjoyed the other books I have read by Brynne Weaver but she really out did herself with this one. When I read the trigger warning I was only mildly concerned, mostly because I genuinely thought one of the main characters was going to be a cannibal, and I can happily say do not worry because that is not at all the case lmfao. The “not so accidental cannibalism” was actually a very funny addition to the book. Rowan, the MMC, had a lot to live up to with a name like that and I can fully say that he did. His witty nature and overall character was 🥹🫶🏼🥹🫶🏼🥹🫶🏼🥹🫶🏼🥹 MY MAN WAS OBSESSED. And Sloane, I loved that she was a bad bitch but also had normal people anxiety hahahahah.\n\nDecember 21, 2023\n\ni want what they have…\n\n“you’ll love me someday” ROWAN DO YOU WANNA GET WIFED UP AND HAVE KIDS AND LIVE ON THE BEACH WITH OUR 3 CATS OR SOMETHING ???!!! 🫣\n\nthey way he was so patient with her. the pining, the angst, the rivalries, the games, the years of longing and hoping she might feel the same way when she felt the same way since you laid your eyes upon her…god they were destined for each other !! when i tell you that i would run through a wall for that man… 🏃🏻‍♀️\n\nwhen he named the restaurant **you know what it is** and permanently reserved a spot for her…MY HEART DISCHARGED FROM ITS ARTERIES!! 🫀\n\nthis man was so goofy and obsessed with her. i only want dark romcoms written this way bruv 🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗\n\nsomething about these two were so evanescence 2003 coded and i ate that shit up 🧍🏻‍♀️\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nI LOVED this book. I love any book that combines murder and romance but the fact that they're also serial killers! I knew I was going to love this one. This book combines gory murder, comedic relief, an at sometimes absurd plot, and a sweet romance so well. Very very excited to read book 2!\n\nJanuary 20, 2024\n\nIt took far longer than I'd like to admit to realize that this book was going nowhere near my favorites list (a fact I’ll credit solely to the wonderful audio performance from Joe Arden and Lucy Rivers). A shock, as I’m sure you can imagine, since it’s literally about SERIAL KILLERS who play a MURDER GAME together and fall in love along the way. But it finally hit me around the ¾ mark that I’d rather get my eyeballs plucked—nay, gouged—out, than continue to be subjected to Butcher & Blackbird’s unconvincing chemistry, shallow characters, and disjointed timeline.\n\nDissatisfying as a romance and horror novel, alike. RIP my hopes and dreams of ever finding a good crossover between the two genres.\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\n3.75/5\n\nAccidental cannibalism you say? Hmmm I don’t think-\n\nBut the hero is a serial killer with a golden retriever energy who is a chef by day and is obsessed with the heroine?\n\n‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎\n\nGive it to me.\n\nI never expected to be soo obsessed with this book. It was supposed to be a dark romantic comedy, and I ate it up. In one sitting. It’s about two notorious serial killers, Sloane and Rowan, who organized an annual murder competition, during which the two met every few months to kill their chosen victim. It sounded so good that I had a hard time believing it could turn out to be anything other than amazing. And, I was right. It was amazing.\n\nLet’s get to the point though. Meaning, the main characters. The best part of the book. The spoilers also start here.\n\nRowan Kane, aka my new obsession. Seriously. I'm pretty sure I have a new type - a serial killer with a golden retriever energy who looks like your typical tall, dark and mysterious, who drives a motorcycle, has tattoos, and, who also owns popular restaurants where he is the chef. Restaurants that he named after the heroine, and where he has a booth reserved forever just for her. Ah, how I love fictional rich men.\n\nThis man was also insane, crazy and a bit nuts. Yes, I know these words basically mean the same thing, but as you read, you'll see that they all describe him perfectly. It still doesn't change the fact that he was hot and I want him. Who doesn’t want a crazy comedian who is obsessed with you? The best part is that most of the time he wasn't even trying to be funny, but what he said was so unserious that I end up laughing anyway.\n\n\"his gaze remains trapped on the trail of tiny white worms heading my way. When his eyes lift from the floor, they meet mine with an eager smile. “Want to get lunch?”\n\nIt was so out of nowhere that I laugh.\n\n\"As he collects his bike, I ask him what he’s going to do with all this cash, and he tells me he’s saving for a PlayStation. Before he goes, I give him an extra two hundred bucks.\"\n\nSkskksjsjsjsk he made a deal with some kid to bring Sloane groceries so he could help her cook over the phone. Despite standing secretly outside her house.\n\n\"Rowan’s reply is immediate.\n\nHold tight, love. I’m coming.\"\n\nAnd he calls her 'love'. That should be enough to love this man.\n\n“You’re beautiful, Rowan.”\n\nThis time, it’s my turn to blush.\"\n\nAnd he blushes. *screaming*\n\n\"Do you really think I just like you when I framed a drawing you left for me on a scrap of paper you tore from a notebook? The one I hung it in the kitchen so I can look at it every day and think of you? Do you think I just like you when I tattoo it on my skin?\"\n\n*SCREAMINGGGGGG*\n\n\"Rowan rests the handle of the ax against his shoulder and huffs before giving me a wink. “Getting revenge for hurting my girl, of course.\"\n\n‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎\n\nFor safety reasons, because I know that for some people, including me, it’s important. He was celibate from the moment he first saw her and became obsessed. Four years. The fact that he fangirled over her when he first met her was also incredibly cute. Yes, cute. A grown man can be cute. However, this only applies to fictional men.\n\nMoving to our heroine, Sloane. I loved her, she was smart, funny and had crazy ideas. Who cares if she was a serial killer? At least she was hot doing it. Killing terrible men and not getting caught? A girl can only dream.\n\n“Just…hold…still…” Sloane says, gritting out every word over the man’s garbled cries.\n\n“I’d say it would hurt less if you stop struggling, but that’s a total lie.” The man screams again and I turn my head toward the sound.\"\n\nThis book is a perfect example that you can write a dark romance with two serial killers whose relationship is based on friendship, not lust. It took them four years to finally be together, and I liked that they were friends during these years. Best friends even. Rowan has been sure about them, about what they could be and what he wanted, and he was patiently waiting for Sloane to catch up. The best part is that he hasn't been a hoe all these years. The man was so obsessed that he only wanted her. As he should.\n\nFinally, about the \"Accidental Cannibalism\" and \"Not-So- Accidental Cannibalism\", which brought me to this book even though I was quite terrified of what it might turn out to be. The first thing happened during one of their kills when Rowan unknowingly ate the meal their victim had made for them. You know what it was. The second situation? That would be too much of a spoiler, so I'll just say that none of them consumed it. Thankfully.\n\nOverall, I'm happy I decided to read it because I was quite skeptical at first. I can't wait to read Rowan brothers' books. There are a lot of hints as to who they will be paired with and I just can't wait.\n\nThe Ruinous Love trilogy\n\n1. Butcher & Blackbird 3.75/5\n\n2. Leather & Lark tbr 2023\n\n3. Scythe & Sparrow tbr 2024\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nOh boy! I can say three things firstly:\n\n-This stimulating, scorching, action-packed, mind-bending, heart-pounding, intelligent, and highly entertaining novel, seamlessly blending thriller, mystery, dark comedy, and erotic romance genres, has become my new addiction, making me want to scream my adoration for it from the rooftops!\n\n-I've undoubtedly found another auto-approved author, and I can't wait to read more from Brynne Weaver and the \"Ruinous Love Trilogy\" books! Especially seeing the bonus part of Lachlan and Lark’s story has increased my appetite and pumped up my excitement!\n\n-Unfortunately, the author has ruined orzo pasta and ice cream for me for a long time! I will definitely be passing on those meals!\n\nThis book has an unusual plot revolving around two serial killers who compete with each other to finish the job of their targeted evil. Yes, they are like vigilantes, cleaning the world of the most malicious human beings, even though both of them also enjoy the blood, turning crime scenes into art exhibitions to feed their violent fantasies.\n\nSloane, the orb weaver, a.k.a. \"Blackbird,\" finds her path crossing with Irish charm, dangerous, charismatic Rowan, a.k.a. Butcher when she accidentally locks herself with her latest prey in a cage for three days in the Louisiana summer. Rowan unleashes her and comes with a proposal that intrigues her, just like the man who tells her the rules. Their attraction is palpable, wild, animalistic, and barely controllable. They decide to play an annual game to hunt their targeted victims by choosing them around the most dangerous monsters hiding in human clothing. Their blossoming friendship and attraction lead them to places they could never imagine.\n\nWill they be each other’s destruction, or are they just a match made in hell, destined to find their own kind of bloody, highly eccentric, stimulating, sensational happily ever after?\n\nWow! Just wow! My mind is ready to explore! This book is entertaining, smart, unputdownable, and those steamy, naughty scenes definitely set the chapters on fire! They're absolutely hyperventilating! The cliffhanger at the end made me scream and crave the sequel urgently! This chaotic, hilarious, a little gory, but extremely exciting book was everything I needed! I couldn’t recommend it more!\n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and Zando for sharing this unique novel’s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\nmedium blog\n\ninstagram\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nI am here to share with you my recommendation for the riveting audiobook \"Butcher & Blackbird\".\n\nI was immediately captivated by this book because of the author's attention to detail. Weaver's words perfectly craft a world of sights, sounds, and smells of 19th century London in your imagination. The atmosphere is impressively heavy, packed with tension and intrigue. Weaver has created a character with resilience and tenacity, and I found myself cheering her on the whole time.\n\nI also was fortunate enough to listen to the audiobook: (Listen \"Butcher & Blackbird\" Audiobook). The person who narrates does a great job giving depth and emotion to each character in the story. I'd highly suggest picking up this book if you like historical mysteries, strong female leads, and atmospheres that will paint pictures in your mind. .\n\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\n\"Sloane.\n\nI can't lose you.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better kiss me.\"\n\n✔️ Dark romcom\n\n✔️ Friends to lovers (they're both serial killers)\n\n✔️ Reverse grumpy x sunshine\n\n✔️ Forced proximity\n\n✔️ Only one bed\n\n✔️ He falls first and hard\n\n✔️ Touch him/her and die\n\nWell that was a WILD ride and so fun. Although I expected a lot more cause the hype got to me.\n\nI liked Rowan and Sloane. Their banter was EVERYTHING. Their dynamic with each other was so well built. The way Sloane opened up to him and the way Rowan was always rooting for her, waiting for her and just loving her was so beautiful to read. Both of them were so protective towards each other, going to lengths for each other and never giving up, I loved that. As individuals too they shined. One did not overpower the other and was quite balanced.\n\nThe action bits were quite vividly described which I did have an issue with at one point in the book. There's a lot of gore. A LOT. In fact, more so than the spice. I was not so much invested in the plot or what they did as much as their romance which is why this is a three star read for me.\n\nThese might be just me issues but once I read about Sloane's genital piercing, I just wasn't able to ignore it during the spice. Sorry 😂🙈 Another thing am not appreciative of was that there was a lot of swearing in this. I don't mind how much one swears but using God's name in vain got to me...\n\nThe ending was quite good and explosive. I like Lachlan a lot, he was probably my favorite character so I'll look forward to his book. Overall, a decent read.\n\nThere's a long list of TW, so please check it out before reading. This book might not be for everyone.\n\n~•~•~\n\nSerial killers and romance? Intrigued. Very intrigued.

I think that qualifies you as a fully fledged adult.” (Rowan)\n\nhalfway through we come across the ‘him stalking cooking island’ where u find out that rowan was up here outside stalking her and sending groceries to her house for her to cook food and he would call her and talk her through how to cook the food which was so sweet but also kind of stalkerish but i'm all for it bc rowan is hot is as hell!!! 😜\n\nand as fun as it would be to talk about rowan all day unfortunately we are coming across the “death drop” soon….💀\n\nfourth place\n\n👅🍽- human flesh eating/ making eyeball ornaments\n\nwhen i tell you im so grossed out like i couldn’t eat for a whole day every time i read this book! for those who don’t know sloane and rowan went to this dinner party to kill a guy and they got drugged and rowan passed out but sloane ended up torturing the guy rowan woke up later and sloane told him that he choked on a ‘human’s ass’ like she had to scrape it off his tongue 🤢 im going to be sick!! and then ontop of that girl was cutting out human ornaments remind me not to visit them for any feasts, holidays or anything this is enough to make u drop dead! 🪦\n\nAnd if thats not enough “snake drop” pit is approaching…..🐍\n\nfifth place\n\n🍦🤢- ICE CREAM!!!\n\nso… never will i be able to think the same about ice cream especially cookies and cream like who thinks that up and dude was eating it by the container FULL!!! 🤮 I just want to cry!! why are they doing this to us!! those who don't know there was ice cream that was eaten that had semen in it and sloane had the nerve to say what an interesting substitute to salt! the grave digger is on speed dial! ☎️ the snakes are biting and more and more i am dying\n\nalmost to the end….someone pls come help us!!! 😭\n\nsixth place\n\n💗🤭- lovey scenes\n\n“You're beautiful to me.” (Rowan)\n\n“You are all the best things to me, Sloane. No matter how many bruises are in your heart or your skin.” (Rowan)\n\n“I would kill for you, and I have. I would do it again, every damn day. I'd turn myself inside out for you. I would die for you, Sloane, and you fucking know it.” (Rowan)\n\nalmost to the SURPRISE!! despite the most disgusting scenes ever rowan and sloane found some way to win me over all their scenes (mostly) were so good and i was giggling and kicking my feet and screaming in my pillow 🤭\n\nbonus- a mini hut to get bottled water and sun hats to block out the sun that is melting us to death AKA…\n\nthe spicy scenes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥- 5 STARS Y’ALL!! 5 STARS!!! Rowan is a tiger in the sheets as they say! there was one scene where they had sex and dude was wearing a dragon suit! I CAN’T!! cmon on now dude and they were both turned on by the costume this crazy book…….. and then ontop of they had the nerve to say..\n\n\"Maybe we should do the pirate costume next time.” (Sloane)\n\n“You be the pirate, I'll be the parrot.” (Rowan)\n\nHELP! 😩 ik they weren't time traveling to freaking kindergarten to play dress up and dollies and then ofc the safe word was chainsaw how fitting for the book 🤣\n\nAnd finally we made it to the END/SURPRISE…. 🥳\n\nSURPRISE!!!!\n\n💍👌- the ending ❌ (as they say x marks the spot)\n\n“Did you just propose on a napkin with a ring you stuffed in a guy's eye hole?”\n\nHE PROPOSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It’s about two serial killers who fall in love while playing in hunting and killing competitions. They are psychopaths, they are tortured souls, this is dark; brace yourself for that. But outside of the morbidity and gore, this was a cute and sweet, slow burn. How did this author do that? How did she make us root for two murderers, watch them play with their victims brutally and without conscience and feel swoony at the romance of it? I dunno, scientists need to look into this.\n\nSo if you like cool banter, sweet (but psycho) characters, funny side characters and can handle or embrace very dark content, then try this. It’s a hoot.\n\nIt doesn’t get full five stars because the time jumps got really annoying to me and I wanted more time of them actually together and I think certain scenes were jumped over that I wished were included. Oddly, the accidental cannibalism worked with the plot so no deductions for that. 🥩\n\n***edited to remove mention of the narration in light of recent allegations. I stand with victims.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\n°˖➴ 'But if we're monsters, we'll thrive in the dark. Together.' 🩷🖤\n\nSo, the FOMO was outta control with this one. I put off reading it for the longest, because I don't often have the best of luck with TikTok recommendations. But since book two just came out and I've been full on bombarded with it lol I thought it was time to give this a chance.\n\nFor the most part, it was a fun and enjoyable read. I really liked both of the main characters, the chemistry and the banter between Sloane and Rowan was great. Honestly, I found them hysterical. Both of their personalities were chef's kiss. 🤌🏻👩🏻‍🍳💋\n\nThe ending was freaking great! The last big scene and then the last line were fantastic and I was thrilled that I already had book 2 lined up and ready to go, no long wait needed.- so kudos Brynne Weaver for keeping me hooked.\n\nBut, where I felt it was lacking... which is kind of a big deal? The plot... It started out so fun and had me really engaged but it comes to a sudden halt just to bomb me with about 30% worth's of back to back sex scenes.\n\nI feel that sometimes 'spice' is a tool used by authors to fill pages and gain word count. That's how I felt here and a good portion of the reasoning behind the 3 stars - which is not a bad rating. I still had a really good time with the book, I just wish the storyline was a little stronger.\n\nI had such a fun time with this and definitely planning on picking up book two right away.\n\n°˖➴ “You know what they say, Blackbird. ‘It’s all fun and games until someone loses an eye,’” I whisper. “And that’s when the real fun begins.” 🩷🖤\n\n🔪💉🩸🖤🥀\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\ni need the second book immediately. 😭❤️\n\nps. don't eat while reading this book.\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n4.25 ⭐️ This book was a riot that I couldn't put down!\n\nWe're not normal people. We are monsters. But if we're monsters, we'll thrive in the dark. Together.\n\nSummary:\n\nSloane and Rowan are great at what they do - murdering serial killers. When a chance encounter sparks an unlikely bond between these two, they decide to have a friendly competition. Each year, they'll meet up to hunt for the most dangerous monsters in the country. Winner gets the kill. Year after year they meet up for this game, but as their friendship develops into something more, the restless ghosts left in their wake are only a few steps behind, ready to claim more than just their newfound love. Can Rowan and Sloane dig themselves out of a game of graves? Or have they finally met their match?\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n\n✨ dark rom-com\n\n✨ serial killer MCs\n\n✨ a gruesome meet cute\n\n✨ annual ‘hunting’ game\n\n✨ friends to lovers\n\n✨ he falls first and hard\n\n✨ witty banter\n\n✨ nursing back to health scene 🫶\n\n✨ 4/5 🌶️ (praise, cock warming, rough sex, choking, spitting, dom/sub, genital piercings)\n\n✨ HEA\n\n✨ dual POV\n\n✨ TW: murder, gore, cannibalism, child sexual assault (past), parental loss (not depicted), parental neglect and abuse (past). Check the author's TW before reading.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThis was a delight - a weird, fucked up delight. 😂 It's a very original story, and regardless of all the trigger warnings above, it’s actually incredibly fun and comical. I don’t know how the author managed to write a gore filled rom-com about serial killers but she KILLED IT! (pun intended)\n\n*I’ve also listened to the audiobook and OMG is it amazing!!! The narrators do an incredible job!*\n\nUpdate: Due to the serious allegations against Joe Arden (who voices the male narrator), Brynn Weave no longer supports/promotes the audiobook, nor do I. So instead, please support Brynn by reading the book.\n\nI absolutely adored the MCs: Sloane and Rowan. These two are such interesting characters with some obvious trauma that's led them to become killers, but what I love most is that they see each other for exactly who they are and instead of being afraid or wanting the other to change, they embrace all of it and love those parts. They honestly make such a cute couple and hey, I condone their killings since they only target terrible serial killers. It's not like they're hurting innocents.\n\nAlso, the fact Rowan has a table permanently reserved for Sloane at his restaurant after meeting her one time melted my heart! Talk about obsessed.\n\nI adored the found family/family relationships in this story. Sloane has her best friend Lark and Rowan has his two brothers who are fully aware and supportive of their killing hobby. I totally didn't expect this and found it very endearing. There's something special about relationships where they see all of you, the good and the bad, and they love you regardless.\n\nThe smut SLAYED! Not only are there a lot of spicy scenes but they were filthy and kinky. Rowan is very dominating in bed and takes just as much as he gives. I also think it's badass that Sloane has 🐱 piercings.\n\nI saw the twist coming but it was still entertaining. I buddy read this with a friend who didn't see the twists, so it may not be that obvious. But I promise you, regardless of if you catch it or not, you'll love the end. It's riveting and will have you at the edge of your seat!\n\nThere were only two things I didn't like:\n\n1. I wish we got a bit more background into Sloane's past besides vague mentions of what happened to fuck her up. We can gather there was SA at the boarding school she went to with Lark, but I wasn't 100% sure, so I thought there needed to be a bit more specifics and insight into Sloane's feelings about everything that happened (including killing the teacher).\n\n2. Sloane repeatedly says \"you're the worst\" to Rowan and it becomes a sort of catch phrase, which would have been fine if she didn't say it around 10 times throughout the story. Definitely overkill.\n\nOverall, this was an entertaining book and I'd 100% recommend it if you can handle the trigger warnings. It's similar to the Mindf*ck series by S.T. Abby because of the whole female serial killer but it has a much lighter tone and a lot more laughs. I have no idea what's in store for Lark and Fionn in book 2 but I cannot wait to find out!\n\nFavorite Quotes:\n\n\"I didn't gouge them out, Butcher. I plucked them. Delicately. Like a lady.\"\n\n_______\n\n\"You know what they say, Blackbird. 'It's all fun and games until someone loses and eye.' And that's where the real fun begins.\"\n\n_______\n\n“That woman you were watching…?” My fingers tighten around his throat as he desperately nods. “She is mine.” I’m sure he begs. But I don’t hear his pleas. They’re fucking useless words that won’t save him now.\n\n_______\n\nI refuse to lose her. Sloane is the only person in the world who can look at my monster and find a friend. And I know she needs a friend just as much as I do. Maybe more.\n\n_______\n\nHe knows my darkest secrets. I know his. We can be monsters, and maybe we don’t deserve the same things that other people do. Happiness. Affection. Love. But I can’t seem to stop the way I feel when I look at every facet of Rowan, from his brightest light to his deepest, most dangerous dark. Maybe I don’t deserve it for the things I’ve done. But I want it. I want more with him than what I’ve got.\n\n_______\n\nSloane bleeds into every thought. When we're apart, her absence is an entity. I worry for her. I dream of her. And yesterday, I almost lost her. Killing bounds us together, and it's a compulsion neither of us can live without. This need, and now this game between us, consumes me as much as she does.\n\n_______\n\nEvery time I think of her, my heart reminds me I'm not as dead on the inside as I thought after all.\n\n_______\n\n\"You're all the best things to me, Sloane. No matter how many bruises are in your heart or on your skin.\"\n\n_______\n\n\"How do you still have the energy to take the piss out of me?\"\n\n\"I always have the energy for that. Your suffering is my number one priority.\"\n\n_______\n\n\"Before you came along, something was missing. You, Rowan. You were missing. You made it safe to feel seen. Safe to play on our terms. Safe to have fun, even though our fun might not be everyone's idea of a good time.\"\n\n_______\n\n“Pick a safe word. Do it now.”\n\nI swallow. Hard. “Chainsaw.”\n\nHe huffs a laugh, a burst of warmth against my core.\n\n“How fitting, love. Now be a good girl and find something to grab on to…” he says, then passes one long, slow lick over my center. “...Because I’m about to destroy you.”\n\n_______\n\nI told her I'm no angel. I don't think she believed me. But she's about to discover that I'm the devil she never knew she needed.\n\n_______\n\nShe's everywhere, in every drop of my blood, in every spark of thought, and I want to fucking destroy her for it. To shatter her just like she's broken me. Because she brings me to my fucking knees. I want to ruin her so that she's mine, my beautiful disaster. My wild creature. My goddess of chaos.\n\n_______\n\n\"I would kill for you, and I have. I would do it again, every damn day. I'd turn myself inside out for you. I would die for you. I don't just like you, Sloane, and you fucking know it.\"\n\n_______\n\nI know I'm not a normal person, but I don't feel like a monster. I feel like a weapon. The final justice on behalf of those who can't speak, delivering punishment for those who don't deserve clemency.\n\n_______\n\n\"You have never been unlovable. You were just waiting for someone who will love you for who you are, not for who they want you to be. I can do that, if you let me.\"\n\n_______\n\n\"You might be a psycho, but you're my psycho, and I'm yours. Got it?\"\n\n_______\n\nMarch 23, 2024\n\n3.5🌟\n\nI disturbingly enjoyed this (read it in one sitting) but I cannot forgive the author for the cookie & cream ice cream 😭 it’s ruined for me now\n\n———•\n\nPre read ; It’s about time I jump on the train with this one\n\nCanadian author = sign me up ✅\n\nJanuary 14, 2024\n\nAN HONEST-TO-GOD 5⭐️ BOOK\n\nThe chemistry is explosive.\n\nThe romance will make your heart squeeze painfully.\n\nThe banter will have you giggling and kicking your feet.\n\nThe one-liners and screwball scenarios are laugh-out-loud hysterical.\n\nIf you, like me, have a super dark sense of humour, you’ll love this.\n\nI cannot wait to read the rest of this series when they’re released (in 2024 and 2025 🫠)\n\nhttps://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeJGEAUx/\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n3.5 - Okay this was an interesting one! I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did. I listened to it on Audible and rather than it being just a narrator reading the book to you, it’s more of a production with the narrators kind of being like “actors.” I’ve also never listened to a spicy book so that was definitely interesting, but overall a fun read\n\nMarch 24, 2024\n\n3.75 stars\n\n❝Something caught your eye, pretty boy?❞\n\n❝Yes,❞ he says, his voice pained. ❝God, yes, Sloane. All of you.❞\n\nThis is truly a nice serial killer romcom. All the reviews were right about this thing. The banter was kinda cozy and funny. I enjoyed reading it, and it's good to get out of a slump too. It wasn't exaggerated or long, just perfect.\n\n• Rowan found Sloane in a cage where he found out she's the 'orb weaver', the serial killer he's obsessed with. They both hunt down serial killers, so Rowan suggested a yearly game to hunt them down!\n\nNow, I was actually surprised because i thought they'd be together after a year or something, or meet every day, but that didn't happen, and they were actually friends for 4 years before confessing their love. The friendship built gradually, and it was quite fun to read their scenes. Rowan was literally the gold retriever in this relationship 🤭\n\n❝No one competes with Sloane. She just hasn’t realized it yet.❞\n\nSloane was the type who acted like Rowan's flirty behavior was disgusting and ew, while on the inside, she was screaming!!!! 😭 Ahh so real!!! But one thing I didn't like was how Sloane's past wasn't in detail. It was just told randomly and not even in detail, just little snippets!\n\nI loved when he called her 'love' 🤭 It's my favorite nickname!!!!\n\nHow fitting, love.\n\nHold tight, love.\n\nTake my hand, love.\n\nOne more thing, love.\n\nI didn’t quite catch that, love.\n\nThe story is interesting, and I did enjoy it. The ice cream and cannibal scenes were truly so freaking gross, and the fact that on the exact day my mom bought some ice cream. 😭\n\nI thought David might be the nicer one, but nope! I'm excited for Lark's and Lachlan's book now and more so for Fionn and Rose's!\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nThis book is perfect, I don’t even know what to say. 5+/5 literally no notes. The audiobook is even better, probably one of the best I've ever listened to.\n\n\"Hold tight, love\"\n\nStars: 5+/5\n\nSpice: 4/5\n\nTropes:\n\n- he falls first and hard\n\n- one bed\n\n- hurt/comfort\n\n- friends to lovers\n\n- \"touch her and die\"/\"she's mine\"\n\nButcher and Blackbird is indulgent and decadent, reading it feels like eating chocolate cake. It has serial killers and gore mixed with rom-com mixed with kinky smut scenes. It starts off hot and just ramps up from there. The writing style in B&B pushes right up against the edge of being cheesy, in the best way. If you like a fun rom-com and you don't mind some violence and gore, you have to read this book.\n\nBrynne made two absolutely adorable serial killers for us to get to know throughout this story. Sloane is such a badass and a little bit of a psycho, while also being lovable and relatable as a character. Rowan is an absolutely dreamy, overprotective, deeply caring MMC and his little irish accent really just takes him into perfect book boyfriend territory. There are several long time gaps in this story, which I am really grateful for. It allowed for their relationship to grow in a way that felt natural and believable. I'm always a fan of giving the two MCs a lot of time to get to know each other before it gets spicy.\n\nThe smut scenes in this book are delicious. Our main characters are a little kinky, just enough to really make things interesting and steamy. Yet, also vanilla enough to be enjoyable to a broad audience. I hope this is the kind of content we continue to see through the other two books in this series.\n\nMy only complaint with this book is that it treats time and money as unlimited resources for our MCs. Sloane and Rowan always had the cash and time off to do anything they wanted or needed. I understand why this is done for ease of story, but it is just one spot where I feel like I had to really suspend my disbelief and just roll with it.\n\nFinally, the audiobook. I cannot say enough good things about this audiobook. Both of the VAs delivered beautifully, their acting was lovely and they just did a great job. The quality of the recording is fantastic, there's no weird background sounds or other technical issues with the audio itself. What really makes the audiobook stand out is the duet style of the reading. The actors each read all of their own voice lines, as well as their own POV chapters. So, when Sloane has a chapter it is still Joe Arden speaking the Rowan lines, instead of Lucy Rivers trying to do a Joe Arden voice. This was my first experience with a duet style audiobook and I was genuinely so blown away and so happy while listening to it. It is a nice middle ground between a regular style audiobook and a full graphic audio experience. I think I prefer it over either of them and I desperately hope that more authors take the time to get their books narrated this way. I cannot stress enough how much this added to the listening experience.\n\nSomething to note, there is a pretty important bonus chapter at the end of Butcher and Blackbird, my copy of the audiobook did not include this chapter. I don't know if it is in some versions and not mine or if you need a print copy to get that chapter. If you only listen to the audiobook, make sure to find a copy of skullduggery.\n\nRead\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nin depth vlog coming this week\n\nDecember 23, 2023\n\nOh my god. 4.5⭐️\n\n(THIS. FUCKING. AUDIOBOOK. JFC.)\n\nJune 2, 2024\n\nI had way too much fun reading this, accidental cannibalism aside 🤣 RTC\n\n—\n\nI’ve been slumping so hard lately and this book is giving me the comedic relief I need 😍\n\nOctober 28, 2023\n\n3.5⭐️ “You have never been unlovable. You were just waiting for someone who will love you for who you are, not for who they want you to be. I can do that, if you’ll let me.”\n\nso for starters, the smut was crazy good 🥵 I loved the idea behind this book! not that killing is justified irl even if the victim is the worst person on earth 😩 two serial killers meeting and falling in love, what are the odds right?\n\nI felt the biggest issue was that they met too soon in the story, literally on the first page. It was cool that they had heard of each other's works since they moved in similar circles, so to speak. But it took out a lot of opportunity with regards to how the plot could have been utilized.\n\nalso, I know it was a bit long distance in the beginning at some points but their personalities or lives fused together too quickly.\n\nI don't know about you guys but I don't like it when villains get romantically involved and then stop being villains especially when it's half of their character build-up and I didn’t appreciate Sloane forgetting her work and playing house so Rowan can decide when she needs to go back home so he can fully focus on his restaurant (wdym? like did he also forget he has a dark side job which his whole personality is based on 😔)\n\n***\n\nI'm ready for the accidental cannibalism I was promised 💀\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nDNF 20%\n\ntbh you couldn’t pay me enough to care..\n\nmaybe im just in a serious dark reading mood lately and this book has that comedy connotation that i wasn’t at all looking for (even though it wasn’t THAT funny simply light with a gory first chapter). plus, the 4 chapters i read were literally a challenge to finish. the writing style wasn’t even polished, very surface-level when it came to describing the scenes and the sittings which is clearly not my cup of tea, reading mainly dialogues is a torture .\n\n—————\n\nhere we go 👀\n\nFebruary 11, 2024\n\n3 stars\n\nCall me a cynic, but every time they met I’d find myself thinking that they’re just luring each other till one of them kill the other. I truly believed that one of them secretly intended to kill the other. Like come on they’re both serial killers who lure and deceive other killers so they could kill them, how could they possibly trust each other???? Why wasn’t that at least a point of discussion? I waited for that to be the final reveal. Or at least the third act conflict? But nope, they had to go and fell in love instead.\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\n”You were missing. You made it safe to feel seen. Safe to play on our terms. Safe to have fun, even though our fun might not be everyone’s idea of a good time.”\n\ni thought i didn’t like romance audiobooks but Joe Arden had me second guessing myself😍🪭. both narrators absolutely delivered in this and 90% of my enjoyment came from the 10/10 audio. this book was so hilarious and so much fun. i know they’re serial killers and there’s a lot of blood and gore but i adored the romance. Sloane and Rowan are psycho soulmates and i loved their relationship🥹. the ending sort of lost me with the plot tho, cause if im being fr i was mainly focused on the romance more than anything else lol. i loved the side characters too and i’m looking forward to reading Lachlan and Larks book.\n\n“I would kill for you, and I have. I would do it again, every damn day. I’d turn myself inside out for you. I would die for you. I don’t just like you, Sloane, and you fucking know it.”\n\nSloane is definitely the more insane one out of the two, but i could see why she acts how she does based on the trauma in her past. Rowan still matched her energy tho and i loved how down bad he was for her. that man worshiped everything about her and we love to see it❤️‍🔥. the slow burn, restaurant, tattoos and all their text messages?! kill me now cause im in love. this was the perfect book to buddy read and i was so entertained the whole time. can’t wait to read book 2 with you Daniella💕.\n\n“Maybe I was right. We’re not normal people. We are monsters. But if we’re monsters, we’ll thrive in the dark. Together.”"
