        "text": "Any Cordwainer Smith fans out there? I've seen his name mentioned several times in threads, but not much discussion about his work. I think his short stories are great. My personal favorites are \"Scanners Live in Vain,\" \"Mark Elf,\" \"Alpha Ralpha Boulevard,\" \"The Lady Who Sailed the Soul,\" \"Drunk Boat,\" \"From Gustible's Planet,\" \"Think Blue, Count Two,\" and \"The Good Friends.\" The only stories of his that I haven't really liked were the last two Casher O'Neill tales, which got into religious imagery that didn't really work for me.\n\nHis writing is hard to categorize. It features truly amazingly creative and strange ideas about what the future will bring, delivered in a very matter of fact style. But his stories are much more about people than things.\n\nI have just reread some of his great stories at the Baen free Library, which have a collection called When the People Fell. These are free online(i cannot seem to link to them individually):\n\nIntroduction from Fred Pohl\n\nNo, No, Not Rogov!\n\nWar No. 81-Q\n\nMark Elf\n\nThe Queen of the Afternoon\n\nScanners Live in Vain\n\nThe Lady Who Sailed The Soul\n\nWhen the People Fell\n\nthe remaining contents being:\n\nThink Blue, Count Two\n\nThe Colonel Came Back from the Nothing-at-All\n\nThe Game of Rat and Dragon\n\nThe Burning of the Brain\n\nFrom Gustible's Planet\n\nHimself in Anachron\n\nThe Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal\n\nGolden the Ship Wasâ€”Oh! Oh! Oh!\n\nDrunkboat\n\nA Planet Named Shayol\n\nOn the Gem Planet\n\nOn the Storm Planet\n\nOn the Sand Planet\n\nThree to a Given Star\n\nDown to a Sunless Sea\n\nWar No. 81-Q (original),\n\nWestern Science Is So Wonderful\n\nNancy\n\nThe Fife of Bodidharma\n\nAngerhelm\n\nThe Good Friends\n\nAs far as i can see, there is not overlap between this and the recent We the Underpeople collection, the contents of which and the majority of Cordwainer Smith discussion is here\n\nSo that's 10 Cordwainer Smith Instrumentality stories free online! Some of which are not in the Masterworks version of the Rediscovery of Man. Check them out, become a fan"
