        "text": "In 2016, we started a new series of popular talks focused on world-building, narrative universes, and philosophical themes in works of speculative fiction. Until Covid-19 intervened in Spring of 2020, these monthly sessions were hosted at the Brookfield Public Library. In Fall of 2020, we resumed the series, but now in a new, entirely online format.\n\nFor me, this series afforded an opportunity to continue the kind of public philosophy work I had been doing in New York before our move back to Milwaukee. I had already done two monthly series, Glimpses into Existence, and Understanding Anger, at the Kingston Public Library. So given the interest on the part of the Brookfield Library, I definitely wanted to take on another series, this time one that could extend past just one year and perhaps go on indefinitely.\n\nWorlds of Speculative Fiction also gave me a good reason to engage in some “guilty pleasure” reading. Science fiction, fantasy, horror, weird, dystopian, alternate history — these are all areas within speculative fiction that I have enjoyed since my childhood. As a busy philosopher, giving talks on works, authors, and series provided me with an excuse to indulge myself in reading and rereading these genres of literature.\n\nWe recorded all of the sessions from the very start, and uploaded the videos into my YouTube channel, allowing us to reach an audience much larger than those who could make it out to the library once a month. In fact, some of these videos have become useful resources for other people all over the world interested in these books and writers.\n\nEach year after the first, I plotted out a new set of authors and series to cover. I also solicited suggestions from both my local participants and the vast online audience about what narrative universes they would like to see me discuss next.\n\nFor those who might like to dig around in, and perhaps watch some of, the videorecordings of the sessions, here’s the full list, organized by year.\n\nYear 1 of the Series–2016\n\nLecture 1 — Philosophy, Fantasy, and Science Fiction: Introduction to the Series\n\nLecture 2 — J.R.R.
