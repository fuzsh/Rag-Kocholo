His novels have sold over 450 million copies worldwide and have been translated in to 38 different languages. He is considered one of the most successful authors alive today. Many who have never even read his works, and have simply seen his books on the shelves recognize his name. Dean Koontz was born in July of 1945, a month before World War II ended in the Pacific.\n\nHis childhood had a strong influence on his writing as he grew older. Dean’s father, Raymond Koontz, was extremely abusive to him and his mother. His mother’s courage in standing up to her husband also served as an inspiration in Dean’s writing. He attended Shippensburg State College in Pennsylvania where he won an Atlantic Monthly competition for his writing, which further encouraged him to continue. After graduation in the 1960s, Dean went to work as a teacher at Mechanicsburg High School. During the 60s Dean also worked for a government-funded program that sought to help violent and troubled youth.\n\nHis predecessor was in the hospital as a result of a beating by the very kids Dean was helping. Dean’s experiences with the program provided him with a new outlook on government, and politics in general. In the year 1968 Dean Koontz released his first novel titled: Star Quest. It was the first of over a dozen science fiction novels that followed. Dean has published over a hundred pieces of work to date, mostly of the suspense-thriller genre that heavily involve science fiction. His books incorporate other genres, adding variety to each release. Dean has also written under nine different pen names such as Brian Coffey, Aaron Wolfe, and David Axton to name a few. He has a love for his golden retrievers, which have led to dogs playing major roles in his works.\n\nTrixie, who Dean received as a gift from a charity he contributed to, passed in the year 2007 and served as a major inspiration for the canine characters through many of his works. Dean is married to his wife Gerda, and lives in Southern California with their golden retriever. Dean Koontz’s popularity has helped him rank next to authors such as Stephen King. In the year 2008, Dean was ranked as the sixth highest paid author, at an approximated 25 million dollars each year. Having written so many different works, some of his most popular are: The Odd Thomas series, which as spawned graphic novels that serve as prequels.\n\nDean wrote a new adaptation of the Mary Shelly classic Frankenstein, which is also now a series. Some of his other most popular works are Shadowfires, The Husband – a story of a husband trying to save his kidnapped wife, facing an unknown enemy on his own, Lightning, The Good Guy, Coldfire, Relentless, and From The Corner of His Eye. The Odd Thomas series has received high praise from fans and critics, and has spawned six novels in the series so far, with a 7th in the works.\n\nThree graphic novels serve as prequels to the series. In the first book of the series titled Odd Thomas, which is also the lead character’s name, Odd discovers that he possesses special abilities and is able to communicate with the dead. Odd discovers his ability when the ghost of a murdered girl seeks out his help and leads him to her killer.\n\nLater he discovers that there are dark forces that are about to unleash terror on the world. In the second novel of the series, a friend of Odd’s is kidnapped after learning from his friend that Odd has special abilities. In the novel Odd faces off against his new enemy, and finds himself on a journey somewhere he never thought he’d be. A feature film was scheduled to be released in 2013 about the Odd Thomas series, but was unable to due to legal action between production studios.\n\nHis modern adaptation of Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein also spawned a 6 part series, or two trilogies. In this modern day version, Victor Frankenstein is using modern technology to create monsters. The series inspired a television movie on the USA Network that was produced by Martin Scorsese. The film was intended to serve as a pilot for a potential series on the network. Due to creative differences, Dean left the project before it was completed and as a result, the plot was modified.\n\nAs a result of his parting ways from the project, Dean went on to write the second and third parts of the first trilogy. There are plans for a full-feature film as an entertainment company who wishes to bring it to the big screen picked up the series. In the year 1988, the film Watchers was released, based on the series written by Dean. It was followed by three sequels about a genetically modified golden retriever, and a monster, both whom break free of captivity.\n\nThe series follows both characters, the monster killing any and all who come in contact with the special golden retriever. Dean has had twelve other works of his adapted in to film, with a 13th (The Husband) being planned. He has many other novels scheduled for future releases, some as continuations of current series. The third part of the Moonlight Bay series titled Ride the Storm.\n\nThe planned final chapter of the Odd Thomas series, Saint Odd, was released in 2015. Dean also writes poetry and short fiction stories. He has released over sixty pieces of short fiction with his most recent titled: The Moonlit Mind, which was released in the year 2007.\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » Dean Koontz\n\n16 Responses to “Dean Koontz”"
