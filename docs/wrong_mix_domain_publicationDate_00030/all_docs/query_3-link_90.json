Flash drives you purchase will often come formatted with FAT32 for maximum compatibility across not just modern computers, but other devices like game consoles and anything with a USB port. Individual files on a FAT32 drive canâ€™t be over 4 GB.\n\nexFAT was introduced in 2006 and has very large limits on file and partition sizes, allowing you to store files much larger than the 4 GB allowed by FAT32. exFAT is not compatible with older operating systems. You must have Mac OS X 10.6.5 or newer, and PCs need to be Windows Vista SP1, Windows 7, or newer.\n\nHow to Reformat on PC:\n\nPlug drive into computer.\n\nOpen the File Explorer.\n\nRight click on the drive, and select Format.\n\nSelect FAT32 or exFAT from the drop down box, and click on Start.\n\nFollow the prompts.\n\nHow to Reformat on Mac:"
