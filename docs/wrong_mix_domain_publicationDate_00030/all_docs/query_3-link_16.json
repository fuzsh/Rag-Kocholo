        "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nThe entire oeuvre of Stephen King, which runs across five decades and is arguably the most eclectic body of work ever written by a single author: several dozen novels, published in less than half that time, have testified to his undisputed crown as a format king of horror fiction. That is one core aspect of the work that makes King’s psyche the perfect canvas for movie producers and directors, and therefore makes him not only the most frequent author to have ever been converted into movie material, but also the most lucrative one of modern times.\n\nAlthough he started writing young, it was his first novel, Carrie (1974), published at the age of 26, that would be adapted for the big screen and finally garner critical recognition by being the first of many films adapted from King’s work. The Master of Horror has since dabbled in fantasy (The Dark Tower series), science fiction (The Running Man) and even crime thrillers (Mr Mercey’s Ghost), but his comfort zone remains horror, suspense and supernatural fiction. As a prolific author of standalone novels, King also penned several long-running series, including The Dark Tower series (1982-2012) and The Bill Hodges Trilogy, which have served as landmarks of his storytelling range. “I just write about what scares me,” King told The Wall Street Journal in 2011. “My mother used to say when I was a kid: ‘Think of the worst thing that you can, and if you say it out loud then it won’t come true.’ And that’s probably been the basis of my career.” With more than 350 million book copies sold in 40 different languages all over the world, and a net worth of $500 million, King is a literary giant — but he’s also a cultural phenomenon.\n\nStephen King’s Top 10 Books, Ranked\n\nWith a bibliography with 57 years worth of prose, which has produced over 60 books and 200 short stories, King has created haunting stories that have left his imprint in the literary universe. However, the question of which of King’s written works stands out is quite challenging to answer. While all of his work is outstanding, this list of 10 books stands out in the pantheon of horror fiction. From spine-tingling classics to modern masterpieces, here are 10 of King’s best works based on public perception, critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\n10. Doctor Sleep (2013)\n\nMany of King’s books conceptually revolve around characters who are somehow related to situations or other characters in his previous books. That way, King can link the storylines and themes in his books in a way that is familiar to die-hard fans. In Doctor Sleep, King follows the life of doubly haunted little boy Dan Torrance, whose story started in The Shining (1977). Danny has now grown up into an alcoholic and troubled adult living somewhat on the wrong side of the law, buried in anger, and hounded by his troubling past. Only the calming influence of “the shining” — his own supernatural psychic powers — can balance his life when he finally settles down in New Hampshire and uses his psychic powers to help the dying in a hospice center. But his life is now thrown out of balance again when he meets a little girl named Abra Stone who has even more potent psychic powers than his own, and together the two of them must stop a band of flesh-eating psychic vampires from killing and torturing children with psychic powers. Doctor Sleep became a New York Times NYT bestseller about two months after publication was also made into a movie released in 2019. It is a perfect book for fans of horror and is available for purchase on Simon & Schuster.\n\n9. Thinner (1984)\n\nOriginally penned under King’s pseudonym Richard Bachman, Thinner follows the life of Billy Halleck, a morbidly obese and self-centered lawyer whose life takes a sinister turn after a fatal accident involving a Romani woman. Despite being responsible for her death, Billy gets away with it because of his high-powered connections, however, the deceased woman’s 106-year-old father, harboring a deep-seated grudge, curses Halleck with a chilling affliction: “Thinner.” At first, the rapid weight loss seems like a welcome change, but soon it becomes clear that his drastic transformation is anything but benign—it's becoming deadly. Terrified, Billy watches in horror as the weight he once struggled to shed melts away alarmingly fast. Billy becomes determined to find the man responsible for this, hoping to persuade him to revoke the curse. This leads him to come to the sudden realization that he must not only confront his inner demons, but he must take accountability for his past and the selfish decisions he made. This book is available on Simon & Schuster and is a perfect read for anyone who is fascinated by the concepts of justice and horror.\n\n8. 11/22/63 (2011)\n\nIn the book 11/22/63, King uses investigative research, historical fiction, suspense and his vivid imagination to create a compelling fantastical saga of time travel and moral decisions. Positioned in past and present times, 11/22/63 is a book that is complete with intricate plotting and moral scrutiny. The protagonist, Jake Epping, is a high-school teacher who discovers a magic black diner portal that transports him back in time to 1958. Tasked with a mission to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Jake sets out on a life-altering mission to alter moral dilemmas and by doing so, alter history as the world knows it. Readers who enjoy intricately plotted stories and historical fiction will be drawn to King’s rich storytelling in this book, which it is available on Simon & Schuster. Although he had the idea for 11/22/63 before he published his first novel, Carrie, he did not publish it until 2011.\n\n7. The Gunslinger (1970)\n\nKing’s The Dark Tower series has been an active part of his journey as a writer for more than four decades. The writing that literary critics — and King himself — have deemed his magnum opus combines several genres, including fantasy, science fiction, horror and westerns, to create one of the top book series of all time. The first novel in King’s The Dark Tower series, The Gunslinger, is one of the more popular and praised books because of its character evolution and beautiful writing. At the center of The Gunslinger is Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger, who sets out on a quest to reach the Dark Tower, the remnants of a higher realm. Straddling the American Old West and feudal medieval society, the book recounts the gunslinger’s lone journey through desolate nations and unravelling mysteries. This is a perfect read for mystery and fiction readers who like books that have a little bit of everything. Find The Gunslinger at Simon & Schuster.\n\n6. Carrie (1974)\n\nKing’s iconic debut novel, Carrie, is about Carrie White, a tortured high-school outcast who is viciously bullied by her peers and physically abused by her fanatically religious mother Margaret. As Carrie goes through the ebbs and flows of adolescence she discovers her latent powers and eventually wields them in a string of bloody disasters as a way to exact revenge on her tormentors. After a cruel prank at prom pushes Carrie to her breaking point, her suppressed telekinetic rage is fully unleashed, and this results in a blood-bathed disaster that leaves the town of Chamberlain reeling. Readers who are fascinated by stories that explore themes of isolation, trauma and revenge will be drawn to King’s haunting portrayal of Carrie’s electrifying descent into vengeful madness. The book is available for purchase at Penguin Random House.\n\n5. Salem’s Lot (1975)\n\nKing’s Salem’s Lot is a frightening book that transports readers to the eerie little town of Jerusalem’s Lot, where everyone is just a little bit off. Life in Jerusalem’s Lot isn’t quite as innocent as it seems. After years away, protagonist Ben Mears moves back to Salem’s Lot, the small town in Maine where Ben spent his formative years. Returning for the first time in several decades, Ben’s memories of his childhood are cropping up in the form of constant thoughts and feelings of childlike longing, and he finds himself haunted by the illusion of a strange whimpering sound coming from Marsten House, which sits high above the center of town. Ben learns that the whimpering sound is something far worse than his father’s drunken exploits of his youth – it’s the sound of the undead, who are essentially vampires themselves. These creatures are under the control of a mysterious figure named Kurt Barlow, who chooses his prey based on whatever most appeals to him. From the older woman who runs the library to the youthful Mark Petrie, who asks mores questions than the town services are equipped to answer, the denizens of Sal his friends as a ragtag group of heroes — including Mark Petrie – Ben Mears fights for everything that’s right before the town is overrun with evil. This books is for horror fans who enjoy a creeping feeling of dread and terror combined with edgy, unsettling suspense. Salem’s Lot is available at Penguin Random House.\n\n4. Misery (1987)\n\nMisery introduces readers to the claustrophobic world of acclaimed author Paul Sheldon, who finds himself at the mercy of his self-proclaimed number-one fan, Annie Wilkes, after a car accident. Trapped in Annie’s secluded home, Paul is subjected to Annie’s sadistic measures, all while she demands that he resurrect her most beloved fictional character, Misery Chastain. Annie, who is a former nurse, uses her knowledge as a former medical professional to carry out this sadism. The pulsating struggle between captor and prisoner forms the core of the story and is a riveting read for people who like to be on the edge of their seats. In the 1987 psychological horror thriller, King underscores the dark underbelly of fame and the potential obsession that can often ensue because of it. Misery is available for purchase on Simon & Schuster.\n\n3. Pet Sematary (1989)\n\nKing’s Pet Sematary is set against the backdrop of the idyllic town of Ludlow, Maine, where sinister secrets seem to find their home. Shortly after Dr. Louis Creed and his family move to Ludlow for his new job, they find out that their new home shares a border with a pet cemetery that has a misspelled sign that reads, “Pet Sematary.” While this seems like an innocent discovery at first, little do they know that beyond the location lies an ancient burial ground with a sinister power that brings the dead back to life. This graveyard has seen generations of children bury their pets there and when tragedy strikes and the Creed family suffers a devastating loss, Louis is faced with a challenging choice: to go against the laws of nature and resurrect his loved ones, or to let them rest in peace. Readers who are fascinated by suspense, the afterlife and visceral terror will appreciate this book. Pet Sematary is available on Simon & Schuster.\n\n2. IT (1986)\n\nKing’s hit novel IT is a fantastic depiction of trauma and fear in childhood, brought to life through a demonic entity known simply as IT. IT primarily appears as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and the novel takes place over two time periods: the ‘50s and ‘80s, when a group of children are being terrorized by this otherworldly monster as part of a 27-year cycle in Derry, Maine. The children, banded together by Pennywise as individuals who prefer “to live alone,” call themselves the Losers’ Club and fight back against this creature, which assumes different forms in order to play on their individual fears. Once these kids grow up and forget about IT, the creature resurfaces 27 years later, and the now-adult Losers are called back to Derry to fulfill a childhood oath sworn to kill IT if it ever returned. IT is as much a coming-of-age as a horror novel as it takes readers through the friends’ experiences and fears in Derry while exploring the power of memory in survivors of trauma and the need to return to those horrible circumstances in order to emerge as adults who are no longer cowed by their nightmares. IT is a classic novel that is a perfect read for fans of classic horror and hair-rising terror brought to life through pages. The book is available on Simon & Schuster.\n\n1. The Shining (1977)\n\nLiterary critics and fans often say that The Shining is one of King’s most important novels, and with good reason. The story follows Jack Torrance, his wife, Wendy, and his son, Danny, to the ominous and haunted Overlook Hotel, located quietly along the edge of secluded mountains in Colorado. Jack is a recovering alcoholic and writer who takes a job at the mountain resort as a winter caretaker, hoping to earn some money while finding some inspiration for his writing. Danny has “the shining,” which are psychic premonitions that give him insight into the sinister history of the hotel. The hotel’s dark aura begins to weigh heavily on Jack’s psyche causing him to lash out in dangerous violent frenzies that threaten his wife and son. The Shining is a good read for fans who enjoy psychological thrillers that merge with horror. The book is available on Penguin Random House.\n\nStephen King Books In Order\n\nBelow is a comprehensive list of Stephen King books in order of release.\n\nCarrie - Novel, 1974\n\nSalem's Lot, 1975\n\nRage, 1976\n\nThe Shining, 1977\n\nThe Stand, 1978\n\nThe Long Walk, 1978\n\nThe Dead Zone, 1979\n\nFirestarter, 1980\n\nRoadwork, 1980\n\nCujo, 1981\n\nThe Running Man, 1981\n\nThe Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, 1982\n\nThe Body, 1982\n\nApt Pupil, 1982\n\nThe Breathing Method, 1982\n\nRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, 1982\n\nChristine, 1983\n\nPet Sematary, 1983\n\nThe Talisman, 1984\n\nThinner, 1984\n\nCycle of the Werewolf, 1985\n\nThe Bachman Books, 1985\n\nIT, 1986\n\nThe Eyes of the Dragon, 1987\n\nMisery, 1987\n\nThe Dark Tower: The Drawing of the Three, 1987\n\nThe Tommyknockers, 1987\n\nThe Dark Half, 1989\n\nThe Stand: The Complete & Uncut Edition, 1990\n\nSecret Window, Secret Garden, 1990\n\nThe Langoliers, 1990\n\nThe Library Policeman, 1990\n\nThe Sun Dog Dog , 1990\n\nThe Dark Tower: The Waste Lands, 1991\n\nNeedful Things, 1991\n\nGerald's Game, 1992\n\nDolores Claiborne, 1993\n\nInsomnia, 1994\n\nBlind Willie, 1994\n\nRose Madder, 1995\n\nThe Regulators, 1995\n\nThe Green Mile: The Two Dead Girls, 1996\n\nThe Green Mile: The Mouse on the Mile, 1996\n\nThe Green Mile: Coffey's Hands, 1996\n\nThe Green Mile: The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix, 1996\n\nThe Green Mile: Night Journey, July 1996\n\nThe Green Mile: Coffey on the Mile, 1996\n\nDesperation, 1996\n\nThe Dark Tower: Wizard and Glass, 1997\n\nBag of Bones, 1998\n\nThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, 1999\n\nHearts in Atlantis, 1999\n\nHeavenly Shades of Night Are Falling, 1999\n\nLow Men in Yellow Coats, 1999\n\nWhy We’re in Vietnam, 1999\n\nThe Green Mile: The Complete Serial Novel, 2000\n\nBlack House, 2001\n\nDreamcatcher, 2001\n\nFrom A Buick 8, 2002\n\nThe Dark Tower: Wolves of the Calla, 2003\n\nThe Dark Tower: The Gunslinger (Revised), 2003\n\nThe Dark Tower: Song of Susannah, 2004\n\nThe Dark Tower, 2004\n\nThe Colorado Kid, 2005\n\nSalem’s Lot Illustrated Edition, 2005\n\nLisey’s Story, 2006\n\nBlaze, 2006\n\nA Very Tight Place, 2008\n\nDuma Key, 2008\n\nN, 2008\n\nUR, 2009\n\nUnder the Dome, 2009\n\nBlockade Billy, 2010\n\n11/22/63, 2011\n\nThe Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole, 2012\n\nJoyland, 2013\n\nDoctor Sleep, 2013\n\nMr. Mercedes, 2014\n\nRevival, 2014\n\nJoyland Illustrated Edition, 2015\n\nFinders Keepers, 2015\n\nEnd of Watch, 2016\n\nGwendy's Button Box, 2017\n\nSleeping Beauties, 2017\n\nElevation, 2018\n\nThe Outsider, 2018\n\nThe Institute, 2019\n\nIf It Bleeds, 2020\n\nMr. Harrigan’s Phone, 2020\n\nRat, 2020\n\nThe Life of Chuck, 2020\n\nLater, 2021\n\nBilly Summers, 2021\n\nGwendy’s Final Task, 2022\n\nFairy Tale, 2022\n\nHolly, 2023\n\nUpcoming Stephen King Books\n\nBecause King's pen is always on the move, the horror master has an upcoming book called You Like It Darker, which will be a compilation of 12 stories within one book.
