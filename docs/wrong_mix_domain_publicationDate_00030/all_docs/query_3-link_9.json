        "text": "The series follows the story of seven sisters, and begins as their adoptive father – the elusive billionaire they call Pa Salt – dies, and they are each given a tantalising clue to their true heritage. Each book is the story of one of the sisters as they trace their origins all over the world in spellbinding tales of love and loss.\n\nThe first book in the series is The Seven Sisters; followed by The Storm Sister, The Shadow Sister, The Pearl Sister, The Moon Sister, The Sun Sister and The Missing Sister. The eagerly awaited final book of the series, Atlas: The Story of Pa Salt came out in May 2023.\n\nWhat is the latest Seven Sisters book?\n\nThe Seven Sisters books in order\n\n‘ Never have I found myself so deeply involved or moved as I have been by the bravery, humanity and sheer determination of the incredible people, both past and present, that I have encountered during the writing of Electra’s story. ’\n\nLucinda Riley on The Sun Sister\n\nLucinda sadly died in 2021, and the Riley family shared the below message regarding Atlas: The Story of Pa Salt:\n\n'Shortly before the publication of The Missing Sister, Lucinda announced an eighth and final book in The Seven Sisters series, promising to answer the question at the heart of the story: Who is Pa Salt? Before her death, Lucinda was able to write several important passages and detailed notes on the story. She expressed a clear wish that her eldest son, Harry, should complete the series if the worst were to happen.\n\nWe can now confirm that Atlas: The Story of Pa Salt will be published around the world in spring 2023, co-written by Harry Whittaker. Lucinda and Harry worked closely together on The Guardian Angels series for children. Harry writes: ‘Mum has passed on the secrets of the series, and I will keep my promise to her in sharing them with her loyal readers. Rest assured that in spring 2023, the whole world will know just who Pa Salt is and why he adopted the sisters.’ We thank those of you who have allowed us the space to grieve, and those who have donated so generously to Mary’s Meals.' – Lucinda’s family\n\nIf you loved Lucinda Riley's Seven Sisters series, don't miss:"
