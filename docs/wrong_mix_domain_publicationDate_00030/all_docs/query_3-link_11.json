        "text": "Wilbur Smith Biography\n\nWilbur Addison Smith was a British-African novelist who wrote more than 50 novels in his lifetime. Smith is a household name among contemporary novelists. He was born on January 9, 1933, in Zambia, a country betwixt South, Central and East Africa.\n\nChildhood\n\nWilbur Smith was named after the famous aviator Wilbur Wright. Since childhood, Smith thought he never fitted in with the other students and constantly felt out of place. Smith’s father was a metal worker who Smith described as a “tough man”. Wilbur Smith attended Michaelhouse for high school, and Rhodes University to get his Bachelor’s Degree in Commerce in 1954. Smith tried his hands at various jobs like a gold mine, fishing boats, whaling ship, rubber factory and finally his own sheet metal establishment. He had always been fond of books.\n\nCareer\n\nWilbur Smith started writing in his spare time, while he was working with the Inland Revenue Service. He sent out his first story ‘On Flinder’s Face’ with the pen name Steven Lawrence and the story was accepted by Argosy magazine in 1963. He earned a good commission for it and was motivated to write more. However his first written novel The Gods First Make Mad was rejected by several publishers. He was discouraged, but with the enthusiasm of Ursula Williams, his agent from London, he started writing When the Lion Feeds, where Wilbur Smith introduces the characters Sean Courtney and Garrick Courtney and the rest is history.\n\nThe Complete List of Wilbur Smith Books in Order\n\nCourtney Books\n\nThe Courtney novels follows the life of the Courtney family through three centuries. In the first sequence, which starts with When the Lion Feeds, we see the life of Sean Courtney (and the twin Garrcick Courtney). In the second sequence, which begins with The Burning Shore, we follow Michael, the illegitimate son of Sean Courtney. The third sequence commencing with Birds of Prey, we see other characters from the Courtney family like Sir Francis Courtney, Leon Courtney, and Ryder Courtney. The Courtney series takes us through several generations, detailed plots, complex family trees, and a range of settings like Johannesburg, European wilderness, Dutch East India Company, the World War I, the World War II, South Africa, Anglo-Dutch Naval War and so on.\n\nPublication Dates Order\n\nWHEN THE LION FEEDS (1964) “When a traveller gets a thorn in his foot,’ Mbejane went on softly, ‘and he is wise he plucks it out – and he is a fool who leaves it and says “I will keep this thorn to prick me so that I will always remember the road upon which I have travelled.” Nkosi, it is better to remember with pleasure than with pain.” Get This Book\n\nTHE SOUND OF THUNDER (1966) Get This Book\n\nA SPARROW FALLS (1977) Get This Book\n\nTHE BURNING SHORE (1985) Get This Book\n\nPOWER OF THE SWORD (1986) Get This Book\n\nRAGE (1987) “History is a river that never ends.
