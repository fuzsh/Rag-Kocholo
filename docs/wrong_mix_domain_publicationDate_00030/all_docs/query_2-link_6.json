        "text": "published in 1964\n\nwhere I got it: purchased used\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRod McBan the hundred and fifty first is the last of his illustrious line, so the law of Norstrilia allows him to have children. But he can’t control or properly develop his telepathy and is therefore considered flawed and handicapped, and no amount of therapy seems to help. Rod will either pass the tests and be allowed to breed, or be given euthanasia drugs. On pastoral Norstrilia, only the strongest are allowed to survive. They may be the farmers of the immortality drug Stroon, but the Norstrilians are a strict, traditional, and pragmatic people.\n\nIt’s fascinating how the richest planet in the universe ended up being sparsely populated by a bunch of farmers and their disease ridden mutant sheep. The narrative offers quite a bit of helpful background on how Norstrilia came to be. It borders on infodumping, but Smith’s easy going and conversational style prose makes it easy to dive right in and feel like you are right there.\n\nAt the last minute, Rod is saved from the grueling tests by Lord Redlady, a representative of The Instrumentality (the governing body of the galaxy), and given the opportunity to visit Manhome (Earth). Not sure what decision to make, Rod consults with the family computer, which has been hidden away under ground. The computer’s response is basically “leave it to me”, and the computer begins playing the stock market with Rod’s family fortune. Before dawn, Rod is the richest man in the galaxy, richer than the Stroon markets, possibly richer than The Instrumentality. If there was a time to escape to Manhome, now is that time!\n\nEscape plan in motion, Rod starts his journey. But the secret is out that he’s suddenly the richest person the galaxy has ever seen. Governments are after him, criminals are after him, everyone wants Rod McBan, or wants him dead. And the one group that conspires to save and protect him is the one group that has eyes and ears everywhere, but no rights anywhere. But what do they want him for? Why did they save him? certainly not pure altruism. When Rod eventually arrives on Earth, he finds that he owns just about everything.\n\nThe story ends rather abruptly, to be continued in the Smith novel The Underpeople, which was written in 1968. The two short novels were eventually published in a single volume in 1975 titled Norstrilia.\n\nOne of my favorite things about The Planet Buyer was Smith’s worldbuilding for Norstrilia. At first blush, their customs regarding population control sounded awful. However, they are not overly cruel or inhumane about it, and the reasons for the strict population control is presented in a logical manner. Or at least, logical to them. Individuals that do not pass the tests are treated respectfully until their death (well, unless you consider killing them!) and aren’t seen as an embarrassment to their families. The drugs allow the person to die in a pain-free state of bliss. It’s the strength of Smith’s power with words, that he can take something so awful, so horrific, and make it sound like just another local tradition.\n\nSmith’s writing style isn’t for everyone, readers seem to really like him, or really really dislike him. Granted, I have not read much of his work, but what I have read I really enjoyed to the point that if I see a Smith at a usedbookstore, I grab it! I appreciate that he doesn’t shy away from telling it how it is, and for pulp science fiction his short stories are very emotional and evocative, sometimes with more the feeling of mythology than a far future scifi story. Often, we meet members of the genetically modified servant class, the Underpeople, who know their lot in life, but dream of better things. Most of his science fiction works take place in the same universe (that of Norstrilia, Stroon, and The Instrumentality),with recurring characters and locales. Smith stories don’t always have a happy ending, but I always get a soothing feeling from reading them."
