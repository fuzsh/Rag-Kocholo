A Movie Adaptation for Your Consideration: Masterpiece Theater’s 1985 adaptation for TV starring Ben Kingsley! So stately. So stalwart in his silent suffering of trials. Not the most attractive Benny’s ever been, though, but still a great performance.

Another Recommendation for the Road: For the more adventurous, the freely adapted Indian classic Bangaru Papa (1954) is beautifully crafted by the much honored pioneer of Telugu filmmaking, B. N. Reddy, who considered this his best work.

If you enjoyed the historical outcast vibe of Silas Marner, but want something a little darker, you may enjoy the Scarlet Letter: A Romance by Nathaniel Hawthorn. It is a darker story but similar scenery and examination of the theme of community. I think it is a beautiful and tragic story and the historical setting of the novel is similar to that of Silas Marner.

If you want an outcast tale with something a little more light-hearted, you may enjoy the novel Holes by Louis Sachar. It is a wonderfully fun and funny young adult tale about a group of outcast boys that have made mistakes, but find their way through their community in the end. I am also a fan of the film adaptation Holes (2003) directed by Andrew Davis and starring Shia LaBeouf. It is very fun and generally faithful to the novel!
