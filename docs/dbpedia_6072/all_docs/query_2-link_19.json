        "text": "Promises made to women conductors of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation on provision of basic amenities at bus termini have been swept under the carpet post bifurcation, according to D. Rama Devi, regional committee member of APSRTC National Mazdoor Union.\n\nAt the International Women’s Day celebrations hosted by the union, she said: “Most of our demands have been put on hold as issues pertaining to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act have taken prominence. As a result, the promises made by the management have not been implemented.”\n\nThe union has decided to continue its fight for amenities, including toilets with running water for women field staff such as driver and conductor at RTC offices and depots.\n\n“A new manifesto will be drafted with all the long-pending issues for the union elections scheduled to be held next month,” Ms. Rama Devi said.\n\nTop on the list would be restrooms at terminal points, sanction of three days leave in a month, and constitution of a mahila committee.\n\n“We have been facing a number of problems at work. For instance, though we are entitled to 15 days of casual leave, they can never be availed of according to our convenience. It will be useful for us if leave for three days is sanctioned in a month as we find it inconvenient to stand for hours during the menstrual cycle, that too without going to the washroom,” says Shiva Devi, who has been a conductor for 15 years.\n\nAfter repeated requests for a washroom at depots, one has been provided in the One Town area for the RTC staff. However, it does not have running water.\n\nA few conductors said that their shifts begin and, sometimes, end during odd hours.\n\n“Despite working in the transport system, we are not entitled to conveyance allowance. Either I need to call my husband or take an autorickshaw at 11 p.m. to reach home,” says K. Satyavathi, a conductor for the past seven years.\n\nSome of them felt that the Women’s Day would really be a celebration if their requirements were met not just for a day, but all through the year."
