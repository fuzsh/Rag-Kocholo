        "text": "The first sound picture in Telugu was Bhakta Prahlada (1931), which introduced Surabhi Kamalabai as the first Telugu heroine. Narasimha Rao's Seeta Kalyanam is the first Telugu sound feature made in Madras. Sitaakalyaanam (1934) was another early Telugu film produced in south-India. Harishchandra (1935) was the debut film for Kannaamba and P. Pullayya. The first film studio was constructed at Rajahmundry by Nidamarthy Brothers in 1936. The same year, the Telugu company Saraswati Talkies made a debut with its Draupadi Vastrapaharanam. Aanasooya-dhruva (1936) was the film casting only children, while Prema vijayam (1936) was the first social film in Telugu. Girhalakshmi (1937) was a big turning point in Telugu film history with a revolutionary story. Its success promoted many other social films like B.Nagi Reddy's Sumangali, Gudavalli Ramabrahman's Malapilla and Raitu Bidda and Mallipelli (1939). The first male playback song in Telugu was sung for Vandemataram (1939). Since it was a child's voice, MS RamaRao's song in Devata (1941) is considered first \"male\" playback. Dharmapatni (1941) was the debut film of Akkineni Nageswara Rao (ANR). S.S.Vasan's Balanagamma (1942) was a very successful folkloric film. The first female playback (credited) in Telugu was in Bhaktapotana (1942).\n\nL.V Prasad (1908-1944) was one of the movie moguls of Madras who made his directorial debut with Grihapravesam (1946). His important films include Drohi(1948), Mana Desam (1949), Sahukaru (1950), Samsaram (1950), Pelli Chesi Choodu (1952) and Manohara (1954). In 1947, Anjali Devi made her debut in Gollabhama while NT Rama Rao (who later became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh) made his film debut in Manadesam (1948). B.N.Reddi was a brilliant filmmaker who created classical films like Vande Matram (1939), Devata (1941), Swargaseema (1945), Malleswari (1951) and Bangaru Papa (1956). Lavakusa (1963) was the first full-length color production in Telugu. S.P.Balasubrahmanyam made his debut in Sri Sri Sri Maryadaramanna (1967). Sobhanbabu and Krishna appeared on the scene of Telugu cinema in 1960 and 1965 respectively. Oka Nari-vanda tupakulu (1971) was the first full length black and white cinemascope film. Alluri siita rama raju (1974) was the first full-length colour and cinemascope film. Simhaasanam (1987) was the first 70mm production in Telugu. Dasari Narayan Rao is considered as one of the luminaries among the Telugu film-makers. His Premabhisekham was a great box-office hit. Chiranjeevi is a popular star in the contemporary Telugu cinema."
