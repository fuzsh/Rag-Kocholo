        "text": "Reading Time: 3 mins\n\nS V Ranga Rao – 100 Years of Indian Cinema :\n\nThe Indian cinema is celebrating the 100 year completion.Telugu cinema is completing 82 years of its first release of Bhaktha Prahlada(1931).As part of celebrations of Indian Cinema,businessoftollywood.com remembers and recollects the information of The Greats of Early Telugu Cinema\n\nS V Ranga Rao, Popularly known as S V R was born in a middle class family in nuzividu, Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh on 3rd July 1918.\n\nHe was offered with a hero role in the film “Varoodhini” through the reference of “Mr. B V Ramanadham”, his relative.\n\nMuch awaited opportunity came to S V R as a role of Nepali “Manthrikudu” in the Film “Pathala Bhairavi” in the banner of Vijaya Pictures. He impressed everybody with his best acting in that film and became popular overnight with his famous dialogue ”Sahasam cheyara dimbaka”. Then offers started flooding.\n\nIn the film “Mayabazar” he played the role of Ghatothkaja. This film was a success at box-office. The role of “Keechaka” in the film “Narthanasala” made him, internationally popular actor with an award of Best Actor at International Film Festival in Jakarta. He is the first Indian actor getting an International award. His grade as a born actor multiplied with his performance as “ Hiranyakasipudu” in “Bhaktha Prahlada” and as “Ravanasurudu” in “Bapu’s Sampoorna Ramayanam”. Yet again he got the opportunity as “Manthrikudu” in the film Rahasyam produced by B S Ranga. He was suitable for any role because his hefty personality and delivered action with ease and in his own free style.\n\nHe was at his best as caring and passionate father in the film “Gundamma Katha” and a caring brother’s role in “Pandantikapuram”.\n\nIn the film “Andaru Dongale” A remake Of Hindi “Victoria 203” S V R delivered his best acting, beating out the star actor Ashok Kumar who Played the same role in hindi version.\n\nAbsent minded Lawyers role in the movie Thodikodallu is simply superb. As a grand father in the movies “Bangaru Papa”, “Ramu” and “Thatha-Manavadu” he has impressed one and all. He can be termed as the only self to fit in those roles.\n\nHis amazing performance in the role of blind major in the film “Sukha Dhukhalu” elevated him to the new heights in the telugu cinema.\n\nHe has given excellent performance in the role of diabetic father-in-law in the film “Nadi Adajanma”. The film “monagallaku Mongadu” by Modern theaters elevated him to the new heights with his role Katthula Ratthayya. The dialogue “Katthula Ratthayya Pacchinetthuru Tragutha” S V R is still remembered.\n\nUnder his own Banner he has produced and directed two films “Chadarangam” and “Bandhavyalu”, Both the films have won “Nandi” awards as best feature films in the years 1963 and 1964.He has also won the Film fare award (South) in the year 1963 in the best actor category for his action in “Narthanasala”.\n\nThis great actor died at an early age of 56 on 18th july 1974 due to cardiac arrest in Chennai.\n\nIt is quite surprising that this multitalented great actor who ruled the telugu cinema industry for over three decades Could not bag honor Of Padmasri Award from Central Govt. or could not pocket Raghupathi Venkkaiah Award of the State govt."
