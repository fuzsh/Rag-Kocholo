        "text": "Ileana D’Cruz (born August 19, 1984) is an Indian film actress, who predominantly appears in Telugu-language films. Starting her career as a model, she made her feature film debut in Y.V.S. Chowdhary’s 2006 Telugu film Devadasu. She went on to appear in commercially successful ventures Pokiri (2006), Jalsa (2008) and Kick, establishing herself as one of Telugu cinema’s leading actresses.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIleana was born in Mumbai, Maharashtra as the second child to her parents Ronaldo and Samira. She has three siblings, an elder sister named Farah, a younger brother Reece and a younger sister Erene. Her first name comes from Greek mythology. While growing up, she lived for several years in Goa.\n\nCareer\n\nD’Cruz made her feature film debut in 2006 in the Telugu language romance film Devadasu, directed by Y. V. S. Chowdhary, who spotted her in a “Fair and Lovely” ad film directed byRakesh Roshan. Critics were in praise of her, particularly referring to her physique and looks; Jeevi of Idlebrain wrote that Ileana “makes a cool debut. She is good at histrionics and has a fabulous body any woman would love to possess. She has great legs and nice physique”, while a review from Indiaglitz noted that she “has chiseled features and a figure to die-for.” Devadasu, which also marks its lead actor Ram’s acting debut, became the year’s first major commercial success, eventually grossing around 14 crores, whilst earning Ileana the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debutant. She next appeared opposite Mahesh Babu in the action flick Pokiri in which she portrayed an aerobics teacher, who is harassed by a corrupt police offer. The film was a huge financial success, emerging the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time until then, as well as Ileana’s biggest commercial success so far.\n\nLater that year, she made her Tamil-language film debut in Kedi (2006). Although the film did not do so well at the box-office, D’Cruz remained too busy to accept all the film roles offered to her. Her Telugu film Khatarnak (2006) in which she acted opposite Ravi Teja did not do as well as expected, which has been attributed to her glamorous appearance not going down well with the audience. She subsequently experienced a setback in her career as her following releases Rakhi (2006) and Munna (2007) proved critically and financially unsuccessful.\n\nD’Cruz’s career took a turn for the better with the release of her well-received 2007 film Aata, acting opposite Siddharth. She received favorable reviews for her performance as Satya, a college student who is on the run from the home minister’s crooked son by whom she is targeted, when leading a protest and demanding punishment for his crimes. Idlebraindescribed her as “gorgeous” and a “treat to watch to the eyes”. In 2008, she performed a lead role opposite Pawan Kalyan in Jalsa. Her 2009 film with Ravi Teja, titled Kick, was declared a hit at the box office, following which she starred in the 2009 films Rechipo and Y.V.S. Choudary’s Saleem alongside Vishnu Manchu, which both performed poorly at the box office. Ileana just finished shooting for Shakti, where she plays next to Jr. NTR, which she worked earlier in Rakhi. Puri Jagannadh signed her for his forthcoming film Nenu na Rakshasi. This would be the second co-operation for Ileana with Puri, after the huge success of Pokiri in year 2006. She has done a Item song in the Kannada movie Huduga Hudugi called “Ileana Ileana”. She will next appear in Anurag Basu film Barfee opposite Ranbir Kapoor. Apart from movies Ileana is passionate about horses. She has mastered the art of horse riding\n\nRate this:\n\nPriya Vasudev Mani Iyer, better known by her stage name Priyamani is an Indian film actress and model who has appeared in severalTelugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada films. She is best known for earning a National Film Award for Best Actress for her role as Muththazhagu in the 2006 Tamil film Paruthi Veeran, and for her role as Malavika in the 2008 Malayalam film Thirakkatha, for which she won the Filmfare Award for Best Malayalam Actress.\n\nEarly Life\n\nPriyamani was born in an Tamil Speaking Iyer family in Palakkad, Kerala, and grew up in Bangalore. As a result of her dynamic exposure in different South Indian states, she speaks Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu. After completing her schooling, Priyamani modeled for print advertisements. As a subsequent result of her extended modeling, she began to earn opportunities to star in films. After being approached by several directors and being considered for roles, she finally starred in director Bharathiraja’s film Kangalal Kaidhu Sei, which was released in 2004. She is currently completing a B.A. in Psychology. She is the cousin of Bollywood actress Vidya Balan.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career\n\nHer debut film Kangalal Kaidhu Sei in Tamil was released in 2004, and her Telugu debut, Evare Atagaadu, sank without a trace. Priyamani then made her debut in the Malayalam film industry, where she starred opposite Prithviraj, through the film Satyam, but this film also performed poorly at the box office. Despite these commercial failures, she was signed by Tamilfilm director and cinematographer Balu Mahendra to star opposite Dhanush in the 2005 drama Adhu Oru Kana Kaalam. She won tremendous acclaim for her performance in the film, but the film’s under-performance meant that box office success still eluded her.\n\nSuccess in Telugu\n\nIn 2006, Priyamani starred opposite Jagapathi Babu in the film Pellaina Kothalo, a film about a newly-wed couple. The film was a surprise hit given its low budget and modest star cast, and it propelled Priyamani to fame in Tollywood.\n\nParuthiveeran and the future\n\nAfter three years in search of a film that would get her noticed, Priyamani managed to prove both her acting credentials and also commercial appeal with the 2007 film Paruthiveeran, directed by the Tamil director Ameer Sultan, in which she was paired with debutant Karthi Sivakumar. A rural subject which told the story of a notorious young villager in Madurai, the film won tremendous critical acclaim and also became a surprise box-office blockbuster. Priyamani’s performance was unanimously praised and she went on to win the National Film Award, followed by a South Filmfare Award, a Tamil Nadu State Film Award and an award at the Osian’s Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema. She had another blockbuster in Telugu, starring opposite Jr. NTR in the 2007 film Yamadonga and opposite Vishal in the Tamil film Malaikottai.\n\nShe again received critical acclaim in 2008 for her role in the Malayalam film Thirakkatha, in which she played a role based on the turbulent real-life story of late film actress Srividya. She won another Filmfare Award for her performance in the film. In 2009 she had two Tamil releases, the commercial entertainer Arumugam and the Tamil remake of the Malayalam blockbuster Classmates, titled Ninaithale Inikkum, in which she was paired for the third time with Prithviraj. The former was a commercial failure, while the latter was considered a moderate success. Her Kannada debut opposite actor Puneet Rajkumar in the film Raam was also a commercial success. All three of her Telugu releases that year, however, did not do well at the box office.\n\nUpcoming projects\n\nHer biggest project in the pipeline happened when she was hired by the ace Indian director Mani Ratnam for his bilingual film, titled Raavanan and Raavan in Tamil and Hindi respectively. Soon after, she was roped in by Bollywood director-producer Ram Gopal Varma (RGV) for his big-budget trilingual film Rakht Charitra starring Vivek Oberoi and Tamil actorSurya Sivakumar. RGV decided to cast her in the film after seeing her National Award-winning performance in Paruthiveeran.\n\nShe was chosen along with her friend, actress Sneha, to promote the Chennai Marathon.\n\nRate this:\n\nGenelia D’Souza (born August 5, 1987) is an Indian actress, model, and host. She has appeared in Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam language films. After gaining wide attention in a Parker Pen commercial with Amitabh Bachchan, D’Souza began her acting career with Tujhe Meri Kasam in 2003. She was recognized for her role in Boys the same year, and later established herself in Telugu cinemaby acting in several Telugu films during 2003–2005.\n\nD’Souza received her first Filmfare Award in 2006 for her performance in the Telugu romantic film, Bommarillu, which earned her critical acclaim. In 2008, she gave critically acclaimed performances in Santosh Subramaniam, a Tamil remake of Bommarillu, and the Bollywood movie Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na. Having acted in several commercially successful movies in Telugu and Tamil, D’Souza has established herself as one of the leading actresses of the South Indian film industry. In addition to movie acting, D’Souza has hosted the television show Big Switch, and is the brand ambassador of Fanta, Virgin Mobile India, Fastrack, LG Mobiles, Garnier Light, Margo, and Perk in India.\n\nEarly Life and Educational Background\n\nBorn in Mumbai into a Mangalorean Catholic family, D’Souza was raised a Roman Catholic in the Bandra suburb of Mumbai. Her mother Jeanette D’Souza was formerly a secretary to managing director with a Pharma Multinational corporation (MNC), who left her job in 2004 to help Genelia with her career. Her father Neil D’Souza, is a senior official with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). She also has a younger brother, Nigel D’Souza, who works with the Bombay Stock Exchange. According to D’Souza, her name “Genelia”, means “rare” or “unique”, and is a portmanteau of Jeanette and Neil, her mother and father’s name. She is also often informally referred to as Geenu, her nickname. D’Souza studied at the Apostolic Carmel High School in Bandra and later joined St. Andrew’s College in Bandra to pursue her Bachelor’s Degree of Management Studies. She completed her degree while shooting for her first film, Tujhe Meri Kasam in 2003 and initially thought that an MNC job would suit her. She liked sports and studies in college, and was a state level athlete, sprinter, and a national level football player. D’Souza did her first modeling assignment at the age of 15, the result of being spotted as the bridesmaid at a wedding. She was selected for the Parker Pen commercial with Amitabh Bachchan, just two days before her exams, and had to shoot the next day. Initially she refused, because of her exam the next day, but the director persuaded D’Souza to shoot for the commercial.\n\nShe gained wide attention from the Parker Pen commercial with Amitabh Bachchan, who said “she was good, and her expressions were spontaneous”. She further did a Fair and Lovely 2003 Cricket World Cup advertisement with cricketer Krishnamachari Srikkanth\n\nActing Career\n\nDebut and recognition, 2003–2005\n\nWhen D’Souza was offered a role in Tujhe Meri Kasam, initially she turned it down, as she was not keen to pursue a career in acting. But the crew insisted and kept contacting her for two months, and she agreed when she saw the Telugu version of the movie.[16] Tamil director, S. Shankar, was impressed with her performance in the Parker Pen commercial and decided to cast her in a leading role in his 2003 Tamil film Boys.[19] D’Souza was selected among 300 girls, who had auditioned for the movie. She signed three movies simultaneously in three different languages, Tujhe Meri Kasam (Hindi), Boys (Tamil), and Satyam (Telugu).[6]\n\nD’Souza’s professional movie career began,[20] with her Bollywood debut Tujhe Meri Kasam in 2003. Indian film critic Taran Adarsh noted, “Genelia is a wonderful performer. She catches you unaware with a performance that’s natural to the core.” The movie garnered poor box office returns, and it failed to propel her career in Bollywood. Following her poor debut in Bollywood, she decided to act in South Indian films. Later the same year, she made her Tamil debut as the teenage girl Harini in Boys, a story about five teenagers having stereotypical teen-boy fantasies. The movie, though noted for its vulgar sexual content, was a box-office success, and subsequently she started receiving Telugu film offers. She leftTamil cinema for a while to concentrate on the Telugu film industry. She made her Telugu debut in 2003 as a medical student in Satyam. Sify noted in their review that, “Genelia is excellent as her body language is her major asset.” The movie was well received, and it raised her profile in the Telugu film industry.\n\nIn 2004, D’Souza appeared in her second Bollywood movie, Masti. The comedy focuses on three close friends who reunite after three years, but are now married and are being harassed by their wives. D’Souza portrayed the character of one of the wives. Taran Adarsh was complimentary of D’Souza’s role, saying, “Amongst the wives, Genelia is the best, […] Genelia looks the stern and demanding wife and is sure to be noticed.” The film fared well at the UK box office. The same year, she appeared in two Telugu movies Samba, and Sye, both succeeding at the box-office.\n\nAfter appearing in her first Telugu movie in 2005, Naa Alludu, she starred in the Tamil romantic entertainer Sachein. A review in The Hindu noted, “Genelia, who hardly made an impression in Boys, makes much impact in Sachein.” The movie evoked mixed response from audiences, but was well received with the younger generation. She later appeared in the Telugu patriotic movie Subhash Chandra Bose.\n\nTurning point in South Indian films, 2006–April 2008\n\nThe year 2006 marked a significant turning point in D’Souza’s career. She completed two Telugu movies in early 2006, one was the romantic comedy Happy, and the other wasRaam. She then portrayed the role of Haasini, a vibrant, effervescent and a happy-go-lucky young girl, in the 2006 Telugu romantic film Bommarillu. The movie, a blockbuster at the box-office, grossed 250 million (US$5.55 million) in India, and also won the 2006 Golden Nandi award. Her character was well-received, and garnered her the Telugu Filmfare Award for Best Actress, besides Nandi Special Jury Award and Santosham Award for Best Actress. Sify concluded about her acting in their review that, “The scene stealer is Genelia with her innocent looks and cute mannerisms. She does not overact and we just fall in love with her character. Genelia looks like a dream in chic skirts and is the life of the party and raises the bar of the film.”\n\nFollowing the success of Bommarillu, D’Souza played the role of the daughter of a local don, in the Tamil gangster film Chennai Kadhal. Rediff criticized her commenting, “Genelia stands up yet again to prove the point that if you are pretty and well dressed, you can get away with anything, without acting.” Shortly afterwards in 2007, D’Souza played the role of sister of a notorious gangster in the blockbuster Telugu movie Dhee, set against a gang war backdrop.\n\nThe following year, D’Souza appeared in the 2008 Telugu romantic thriller Mr. Medhavi, in which she portrayed the role of a student from Canada. The movie was successful, with Rediffcomplimenting her performance saying, “Genelia is her effervescent self — full of joie-de-vivre and lights up the screen.” She made her Kannada debut in Satya In Love the same year. Later, she was cast in a leading role in Santhosh Subramaniam, a Tamil remake of Bommarillu. The film also turned out to be rather successful as its predecessor. Sify described D’Souza’s portrayal as “the soul of the film” and the film’s “biggest strength”, however Rediff described her character as “appears a little too good to be true.”\n\nReturn to Bollywood and recent work, June 2008–present\n\nIn June 2008, following a nearly five year hiatus in Bollywood, she appeared in Mere Baap Pehle Aap, which failed to make profit at the box-office. A Rediff review noted, “besides her apparent cuteness, brings in tons of freshness and traits to the youthful characters she chooses to play”, while a Sify review criticized her stating, “Genelia is sprightly but has a standard two-three expressions bank in this film.” She later appeared in the Telugu love story Ready alongside Ram, which was well received. Her breakthrough performance in 2008 was through the portrayal of the role of Aditi Mahant in the blockbuster Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na, which was an economic success across India and overseas, grossing 564.1 million (US$12.52 million). Her role was widely admired for her sweetness and freshness, and new style of acting, with Rediff describing her acting as a “spark that has been missing in Hindi cinema for well over a decade now”. In that same year, D’Souza acted in the Telugu romantic comedy Sasirekha Parinayam. The movie received favorable reviews, and Sify noted in their review that, “The life of the film is definitely Genelia and she has shown the varied emotions from innocence, sadness, romance and anger in equal proportions without a hitch.”\n\nIn 2009, D’Souza was cast in the Hindi film Life Partner, in which she was criticized for her performance. Indian fim critic Rajeev Masand commented, “The adorable little imp from Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na has turned into a nagging harridan in this film, and how you wish she’d immediately enroll for acting lessons.” Her next appearance in 2009 was in the Telugu thrillerKatha, which was well received, and for which she won the 2009 Nandi Special Jury Award In 2010, D’Souza appeared in Chance Pe Dance, Uthama Puthiran, and Orange, all three receiving poor reviews from critics.[64][65][66][67][68][69][70]\n\nUpcoming movies\n\nShe will appear in David Dhawan’s film Hook Ya Crook, co-starring John Abraham and Shreyas Talpade. D’Souza is set to appear in It’s My Life, which would be a remake of Bomarilluin Hindi with Harman Baweja. Genelia has signed Santosh Sivan’s Malayalam film Urumi. The film is about a fictional story happening in the 15th century, about a boy who plots to assassinate the Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama. D’Souza plays the role of a Portuguese princess in the movie.\n\nOther Works and Events\n\nD’Souza was a part of Tamil director Mani Ratnam’s stage show, Netru, Indru, Naalai, an event which seeks to raise funds for The Banyan, a voluntary organisation which rehabilitates homeless women with mental illness in Chennai. She was one of the judges at the grand finale ofGladrags Mega Model and Manhunt 2009 contest on 28 March 2009. She also walked the ramp alongside Tushar Kapoor for fashion designer Manish Malhotra at the Lakme Fashion Week 2009 on 28 March 2009.[75] On April 5, 2009, D’Souza was among several Bollywood celebrities to perform at the Pantaloons Femina Miss India 2009 finale in Mumbai. In October 2009, she appeared as a showstopper for jewellery designer Farah Khan on the second season of Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) India Couture Week, a platform created to celebrate India’s fashion heritage by showcasing the country’s leading couture designers. On October 24, 2009, D’Souza began hosting Big Switch, a television show based on slum kids on UTV Bindass channel to reach a bigger audience.\n\nShe has unveiled Spinz Black Magic deodorant on October 7, 2009 in Mumbai, and the Ceres Store retail outlet. At the Chennai International Fashion Week (CIFW) in December 2009, she appeared as a showstopper for designer Ishita Singh’s spring-summer indigenous collection of 2010, showcasing the best of Indian and Western dresses. She also holds a Limca world record of delivering four different super hit films in four different languages, Bommarillu (Telugu), Satya In Love (Kannada), Santosh Subramaniam (Tamil), and Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na (Hindi) in a span of one calendar year.\n\nShe was a part of online market portal eBay’s 2010 “Dream House” challenge, where she transformed an empty three room apartment inBandra into an attractive home with online shopping. She had been provided a budget of 4.5 lakh (US$10,000) and two weeks to create a look she wants with items on sale on the website. On the occasion of Children’s Day (November 14), D’Souza auctioned a few items from the apartment. All proceeds received from the auction was given to Aseema, a Non-governmental organization (NGO), which aims to provide education to underprivileged children.\n\nPopular Reception\n\nD’Souza has been often tagged in the media as the “bubbly girl”, after portraying the role of a young energetic girl in several movies, especially Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na (2008). She appeared alongside Shahid Kapoor on the fourth episode of Tere Mere Beach Mein, a celebrity chat show, hosted by Farah Khan. The theme of the show was “Second Innings”, since both D’Souza and Kapoor had the same history of failures initially and success later in their acting careers. In June 2010, D’Souza was crowned as the “Brand Ambassador of the Year” at the CNBC Awaaz consumer awards, for endorsing nine brands. She is now the brand ambassador of the soft drink Fanta (replacing Rani Mukherjee), the chocolate Perk(replacing Preity Zinta), Virgin Mobile India (along with Ranbir Kapoor), Fastrack watches and accessories, LG mobiles (along with John Abraham and Abhay Deol), GarnierLight fairness cream, Dabur Vatika hair oil, Margo soap, and Spinz deodorant.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nD’Souza is deeply religious and says that, she regularly attends Sunday Mass at St. Anne’s Parish (Bandra), and whenever the family is home, a part of their evening is reserved for saying the rosary together. In an interview with The Times of India, she comments, “I keep a Novena every Wednesday at St. Michael’s Church in Mahim.” In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, she said that “My communication with God is conversational, […] I’m God’s favourite child; I believe that God has always been kind to me.” Tabloids have repeatedly linked D’Souza romantically with Ritesh Deshmukh, ever since they starred together in their debut film Tujhe Meri Kasam in 2003. They were reportedly ready to get engaged, but Ritesh’s father, the then-Maharashtra Chief Minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh did not agree. Ever since then, D’Souza has strongly denied any rumors of a relationship with Deshmukh, and responds that she has just friendly relations with him. She currently resides in Bandra (Mumbai), where she was brought up. Her mothertongue is Konkani.\n\nIn June 2010, she was the subject of a controversy, when a Tamil daily reported that she had attended the controversial 2010 IIFA Awards in Colombo. Several Bollywood actors and the South Indian film industry had boycotted the event, over the alleged killing of Tamilian civilians at the height of the conflict between the Sri Lanka Army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009. The rumours of her visit to Colombo started after her friend Ritesh Deshmukh was seen at the festival in Colombo. Immediately, various Tamil groups andKollywood associations demanded her films to be banned.\n\nRate this:"
