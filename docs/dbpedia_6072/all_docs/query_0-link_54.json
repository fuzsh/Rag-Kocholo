        "text": "Essay on Telugu Cinema!\n\nThe first Telugu talkie was made in 1932 by H.M. Reddy, Bhakta Prahlada. It started the trend of mythological on the screen. Those based on stage plays—Chunnibhai Desai’s Paduku Pattbishekam and Sakunthala, East India Film Company’s Ramadasu and Sati Savitri—saw the involvement of stage artistes (C.S.R. Anjaneyulu, Kannamba, Bellari Reghava and others).\n\nThe 1930s saw prominent directors like. C. Pullayya, Chitrapu Narasimha Rao and Kotcherlakota Rangadhama Rao. Famous names in Telugu cinema of the 1930s include P.V. Das who started the Vel Pictures Studio in Guindi, Madras (now Chennai) in 1934; K. Ramnath, A.K. Shekhar and T.S. Muthuswamy who made the Telugu version of Tamil film Sita Kalyalanam; P. Kannamba and Dasari Kotiratnam (1935); and H.M. Reddy, who produced the successful film Grihalakshmi (1937)—a film that set the trend for contemporary nationalist and social themes. Films that were made on these themes include Sumangali (B.N. Reddi), Malapilla and Raitu Bidda (Gudavalli Ramabrahmam).\n\nThe making of Balanagamma (1942) by S.S. Vasan (Gemini banner) resulted in more semi-historical mythological movies in the 1940s. Prathibha’s Balaraju, Bharani’s Ramamata, Shobanachala Studio’s Keelu Gurram, and films like Gollabbama, Muggu Maratheelu are some of them. The noted actors and actresses of the time were Ch. Narayana Rao, V. Nagaiah, P. Kannamba, G. Varalakshmi, R Bhanumathi, Anjali Devi, S. Varalakshmi, Lakshmirajyam and Savithri.\n\nWhat followed was an era of domination by actors Akineni Nageswara Rao and N.T. Rama Rao who reigned over Telugu cinema for two decades. B.N. Reddy emerged as a famous director, directing Vandematharam, Sumangali, Devata, Swargaseema, Malliswari and Bangaru Papa. L.V. Prasad’s Sansaram led the trend of socials that dominated the 1950s. Directors like K.V. Reddi, A. Subba Rao, T. Prakash Rao, Kamalkara Kameswara Rao and Tapi Chanakya (whose Rojulu Marai is regarded as a milestone) brought in professionalism in the field.\n\nThe 1960s and later the 1970s saw the rise of artistes Shobhan Babu and Krishna. Noted film-makers of the time were T. Prakash Rao (Illarikam), A. Subha Rao (Manchi Manasulu, Maro Prapancham, Mooga Manasulu), Bapu (Muthyala Muggu, Sita Kalyanam, Manavoori Pandavulu), K. Raghavendra Rao (Adavi Ramudu), K. Viswanath (Sita Mahalakshmi, President Peramma), V.B. Rajendra Prasad (Dasara Bullodu), K. Kameshwara Rao (Narthana Sala), Ch. Prakash Rao (Veeranjaneya, Yasoda Krishna), P. Dhoondi (Gudachari 116), K. Balachander (Maro Charita), T. Rama Rao (Yama Gola), Dasari Narayana Rao (Thatha-Manamudu, Needa, Megha Sandesam, Premabhishekam), Vijaya Nirmala (Kavita), K.B. Tilak (Bhoomi Kosam), B.S. Narayana (Nimajjanam), U. Visweswara Rao (Nagna Sathyam) and Vittalacharya. New cinema emerged in Telugu with film-makers like Jatla Venkata Swamy Naidu and B. Narasinga Rao (Pratyusha, Rangula Kala).\n\n(Earlier, non-Andhra people ushered the new cinema trend— Shyam Benegal with his Anugraham and Gautam Ghosh with Maa Bhoomi, for instance.) Madala Ranga Rao, radical in his approach, made Yuvatharam Kadilindi, Viplava Sangham, Mahaprashtanam, Prajasakkti and Erra Mallelu; and T. Krishna made films taking up social concerns: Neti Bharatham, Devalayam, Vandemataram, Pratighatana, among others.\n\nThe superhit film of K. Viswanath, Sankarabharanam, opened the 1980s with a bang. He also made Saptapadi and Sagara Sangarmm. Jandhyala (Ananda Bhairavi, Shrivariki, Prema Lekha) and Vasmy (Sitara, Anvesham) were prominent directors.\n\nThe 1990s saw notable film-makers and films in Telugu cinema: B. Narasinga Rao’s Daasi and Mati Manushulu, K. Viswanath’s Swathi Krianam and Shubha Sankalpam, Desari’s Surigadu and Krishna Vamsi’s Antapuram.\n\nSince the 1990s, some heroes and heroines have been dominating Telugu cinema, among them Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Balakrishna, Venkatesh, Chakravarthy, Mohan Babu, Suman, Tarun, Vijaya Shanthi, Soundarya, Aamini, Rambha, Laila, Archana, Meena, Asin and Meera Jasmin. The noted directors are KNT Sastry (Thiladamm), Neelaknata (Show), Mohan Krishna Indra Ganti (Grahanam), K. Viswanath (Swarabhishekam), Chandra Sekhar Yeleti (Aithe) and K. Vijaya Bhaskar (Nuve Kavali)."
