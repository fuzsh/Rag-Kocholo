This film introduced the famous writer Palagummi Padmaraju to the cine-world.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nKotayya (Ranga Rao) is a kind man. He marries Rami. She succumbs to pressure from Gopala Swamy and elopes with him, leaving her husband. Rami and Gopala successfully plan and send Kotayya to jail. After returning from jail, Kotayya becomes a rowdy drunkard. He plans to take revenge and kill Gopala Swamy.\n\nDuring the fateful night when he prepares to implement his plan, he hears a little child's cries. His humanity overtakes his thirst for revenge. He takes the child, a girl named Papa, under his wings. Papa is the daughter of Manohar (Jaggaiah) and Santa (Jamuna). The child's mother has died after giving birth to her. Manohar, the father, remarries.\n\nKotayya begins a new life in taking care of the child. He leaves rowdyism and drinking. The grown-up Papa is loved by Sekhar, the nephew of Manohar.
