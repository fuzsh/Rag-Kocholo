        "text": "Kongara Jaggayya (born December 31, 1928, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India—died March 5, 2004, Chennai, Tamil Nadu) was an Indian actor, broadcaster, political leader, and poet who was a leading performer in Telugu-language plays and films.\n\nJaggayya made his stage debut at the age of 11. He attended Andhra Christian College in Guntur while continuing to act onstage. In 1944 he left college to become a journalist for the Telugu newspaper Desabhimaani but returned a year later to complete his degree. After graduation he taught for a short period in the high school at Duggirala, in his home district. For three years he worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio, during which time the sonorous voice that was to become his trademark earned him a large fan following among listeners.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nJaggayya’s first screen role was as the hero in the film Priyuralu (1952), which made a disappointing showing at the box office. He decided to return to his home village when his other two films Ardasham (1952) and Beedala Aasthi also fared poorly. With the success of his next two ventures, Bangaru Papa (1954) and Ardhangi (1955), however, his career began in earnest. Over the next several decades Jaggayya acted in hundreds of films.\n\nIn 1967 Jaggayya was elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, where he served one term as the member from Ongole (Andhra Pradesh)."
