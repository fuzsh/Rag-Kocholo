        "text": "A seminal reformist melodrama critiquing the zamindari system from the viewpoint of the Kisan Sabha agitations in A.P. Small-time landowner Narsi Reddy (Raghawan) borrows money from a shavukar [money-lender (Raghavan)] who represents the major zamindar (Sitapathy) of the village. When Narsi Reddy votes for a peasant candidate (Kosaraju) rather than for the political party supported by the landlord, his son is attacked and he is publicly humiliated.\n\nElaborate melodrama, presented the problems of uneven development in terms of an emotional conflict between and innocent feudal rural female and a worldly-wise capitalist urban male. Hero Raghu (Nagaiah), an unemployed graduate, insists on marrying the village girl Janaki (Kanchanmala) despite the opposition of his scheming mother who wants a dowry. Raghu's unemployment problems continue despite his migration to the city, leaving his wife in the clutches of her mother-in-law. When Raghu wins a lottery for Rs. 5 lakhs and returns home, he finds his wife and infant son have left. Although his mother insists he marry again, Raghu goes to the city and dedicates himself to social work, including building factories in order to create employment opportunities. In this he is assisted by his rich female college friend, provoking gossip about their relationship. Raghu's wife, now a poor flower seller, sees her husband with his new friend and believes he has remarried.\n\nA middle class government clerk Raghu (NTR), lives happily with his wife Manjula (Laxmirajyam) until his scheming mother Venkamma (Suryakantham), his sister Kamakshi (Balasaraswathi) and her cowardly husband (Venkatramiah) move into his house. Venkamma appropriates all of raghu's earnings and Kamakshi plots to have manujala blamed for all that goes wrong in the household. Raghu unable to pay his pregnant wifes's medical fees, loses his job and abandons his family. His brother venu (ANR), a flirt who lives off his girl friend kamala (puspalatha) and her rich father, eventually traces raghu and finds him a job as a porter in mill.\n\nNagaraju and Malliswari want to get married. The mother of Malliswari, Nagamma, sends her to rani vasam at Krishnadevaraya palace. Nagaraju tries to get her back at the risk of getting beheaded if caught in the palace."
