        "text": "Erin\n\nFor those who enjoyed the historical french side of A Tale of Two Cities, I would recommend checking out the wildly over the top, but oh so fun film Marie Antoinette (2006) directed by Sophia Coppola. It is a lovely film not so historically accurate, but bright and entertaining and will transport you to historical France.\n\nContinue reading “A Tale of Two Cities Recommendations” →\n\nThe third time’s the charm they say, but we love having co-producer, Rory Nachbar, on the show every time! Wishbonafide Episode 15 hits up Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities and Wishbone’s “A Tail of Two Sitters.\n\nWatch parts 1 & 2 of the TV show.\n\nAbout Our Guest\n\nRory used to live with Erin and Claire in college with great happiness, and is therefore delighted that she can share this podcast experience with them. She works as a Digital Communications Specialist for Johns Hopkins University and spends her free time developing content and promoting Wishbonafide. When she isn’t on adventures with her co-producers, you can find her curled up with a good book or crafting and painting while binging crime dramas.\n\nContinue reading “Episode 15, May 20th, 2020” →\n\nClaire\n\nA Movie Adaptation for Your Consideration: Masterpiece Theater’s 1985 adaptation for TV starring Ben Kingsley! So stately. So stalwart in his silent suffering of trials. Not the most attractive Benny’s ever been, though, but still a great performance.\n\nContinue reading “Silas Marner Recommendations” →\n\nWe’ve finally found gold in Wishbonafide Episode 14! Claire and Erin sit down again in 2020 for the first time in three years to record a new new episode on Silas Marner by George Eliott and Wishbone’s episode, “Golden Retrieved,” with special guest Alecsa Kazenas!\n\nWatch parts 1, 2 and 3 of the TV episode.\n\nAbout Our Guest\n\nAlecsa Kazenas is a 5th grade teacher and full-time word nerd in New York, New York. She has a penchant for words you only hear once a year and knows way too much about cheese. She loves her students with her whole heart because they are, quite obviously, the best!\n\nContinue reading “Episode 14, May 13th, 2020” →\n\nErin\n\nMy first recommendation is the musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber The Phantom of the Opera. The 2004 adaptation is a very decent film version starring Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler. It is a work based on the novel by Gaston Leroux the Phantom of the Opera and covers the theme of an outcast trying to find his place. It is also a very tragic story of a disfigured man and elements similar to this one and has hauntingly beautiful music.\n\nContinue reading “The Hunchback of Notre Dame Recommendations” →\n\nSANCTUARY! We could’ve used it after Wishbonafide Episode 13 was said and done, featuring Victor Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Wishbone’s “The Hunchdog of Notre Dame” – with guest Annie Malady!\n\nWatch parts 1 and 2 of the TV episode.\n\nAbout Our Guest\n\nAnnie Malady is a graduate student at Boston College. They enjoy long hikes, hanging out with their puppy, and drinking lots of coffee. Annie is very excited to be a included in the Wishbonafide adventures and getting to share their thoughts about classic 90s tropes and wonderful pieces of literature.\n\nContinue reading “Episode 13, May 6th, 2020” →\n\nClaire\n\nA Movie Adaptation for Your Consideration: The 1952 Ivanhoe, directed by Richard Thorpe and starring none other than Robert Taylor, Elizabeth Taylor, and Joan Fontaine. It’s quality mid century American period fantasy and won plenty of awards and praise to prove it. A regular proto-blockbuster, and generally straightforward as far as adaptations go!\n\nContinue reading “Ivanhoe Recommendations” →\n\nIt’s a knight’s tale unfortunately not starring Heath Ledger, but hey, still pretty good! Tune in for this episode on Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott and Wishbone’s “Sniffing the Gauntlet” – with special guest Wes Peters!\n\nWatch parts 1, 2 and 3 of the TV episode.\n\nAbout Our Guest\n\nWes Peters lives in Philadelphia and works in public health. He attended Loyola University in Baltimore where he learned to read and write. In his free time Wes likes to read his own novel, Between the Doors (available on Amazon).\n\nContinue reading “Episode 12: April 29th, 2020” →\n\nErin\n\nFaust plays on the theme of someone on a quest for knowledge going too far. There are a number of different works that play on a similar theme. A number of the works we will cover in this podcast, notably Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde, Gaston Leroux’ The Phantom of the Opera, all cover similar messages. The song “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen was also, in part, inspired by this work. But for a recommendation outside of our podcast, “Manfred” by Lord Byron is an interesting Romantic take on Faust. It is a play meant by Byron to be viewed as a poem of sorts and the titular character Manfred goes through some dealing with Spirits similar to Faust’s journey except that the ending has a decidedly Romantic Literature spin which I won’t spoil here.\n\nContinue reading “Faust Recommendations” →\n\nPut away your copy of Marlowe and do your best not to trade away your soul, because Wishbonafide Episode 11 focuses on Wolfgang von Goethe’s version of Faust, and Wishbone’s “Fleabitten Bargain” – featuring guest Nick Johnston!\n\nWatch parts 1, 2 and 3 of the TV episode.\n\nAbout Our Guest\n\nNick Johnston is originally from upstate New York but now lives between New Jersey and Wyoming.
