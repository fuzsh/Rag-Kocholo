        "text": "Tracing a fifty-year history of Telugu cinema, as a industry and cultural form, this book shows how film is directly implicated in the rise to prominence of an elite which continues to dominate parts of the country to this day; and, the emergence of a new idiom of mass politics. This book examines in detail the career of Andhra Pradesh’s best known film star, Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR) to show how Telugu cinema re-defined notions of linguistic identity and community for a non-literate public to create complex and multiple linkages between the consumption of cultural commodities and political mobilization. The in-depth analysis of NTR’s remarkable election campaign in the 1982-83 and revisits the “decline of Congress” thesis to draw attention to the larger transformation of electoral mobilisation with to the convergence of film, newspaper and the audio cassette on a performer who carried over his acting style from the screen to the election platform. The book concludes with a discussion of the lasting legacies of NTR in the present times when film has yielded its pride of place to television, the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh is imminent and institution of the star-politician itself appears to be on the wane.\n\nFrom the 1990s Telugu cinema witnessed a number of major changes in the way films are funded, made, distributed and shown. There is also an unprecedented degree of experimentation with form and genre while a new generation of film stars, both male and female have completed the picture in giving cinema a new look. Simultaneously, the more established stars, especially Chiranjeevi and Balakrishna, have repeatedly demonstrated an inability to move out of the shadow of the 1980s big-budget blockbuster locally known as the mass film. The mass film’s significance for the industry lies in the fact that it is not merely characterized by a limited set of formal features and thematic concerns but, more importantly, production, distribution and exhibition regimes. So what might be seen and even presented by the industry itself as a problem with individual stars, may in fact be a sign of the inability of the Telugu film industry, or at least a major part of it, to Bollywoodize itself.\n\nAcademic books on Indian cinema and film industry have not kept pace with the prodigious number of films produced in India each year that, by some accounts, is the second largest film producing industry in the world. Given this mismatch, Aswin Punathambekar's From Bombay to Bollywood: The Making of a Global Media Industry is a timely reminder of the untapped potential of Bombay's film industry for extending existing theoretical frameworks in media, film and production studies. The book provides a critical interrogation of the 'sociohistorical conjuncture of the past two decades' (p. 3) in the history of Bombay cinema that marks a transition between two worlds – the older traditional one dominated by family-owned studios conducting business along kinship networks – giving way to a newer one that, responding to and engaging with processes of globalization , seeks to break free from past shackles to adopt newer aesthetics, business practices and markets. Relying on close analysis of cinematic texts, of the discourse within and about the industry and of key events in the lead up to and during this transition, Punathambekar weaves a fascinating tale of interest to scholars of Indian cinema and those probing relationships between texts and industry more broadly. This is a tale of technological and economic transformation enabled by the state, the city of Bombay and the Indian mediascape. But it is also a narrative of the battle lines that get drawn due to an ideological struggle between competing cultural practices of media production with corporatized and 'professional' pitted against traditional and preexisting. This book should be of immense interest to students and academics alike seeking to expand scholarship on non-western cinemas, but also to a broader audience comprising viewers and consumers who have noticed a shift in the grammar of Indian movies while lacking a theoretical vocabulary to explain the change. The book's framework of analysis is centrally grounded within the emerging scholarship on industry studies and production cultures. It seeks inspiration from scholars such as John Caldwell's ethnography of film and television industry professionals in Los Angeles and Michael Curtin and Serra Tenic's emphasis on the spatial aspects of media production through analyses of key cities such as Hong Kong and Vancouver. The choice of these frameworks is aimed to supplement the predominantly text-centric scholarship on Indian cinema by unmasking the complex relationalities within which production cultures of media industries embed and thrive. As is evident in the structure of the book, this method does not elide textual analysis but supplements it with close readings of networks of consumers, producers, financiers , marketers and critics.
