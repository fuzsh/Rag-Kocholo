        "text": "12,399 views\n\n, 34 tweets, 11 min read Read on Twitter\n\nToday is the birth anniversary of one of my most favourite cultural personalities of all time, the iconic stage and screen actor 'Vishwa Nata Chakravarthy' Samerla Venkata Ranga Rao! âºð\n\nA short thread! âº\n\nSVR was born in 1918 in Nujiveedu in Andhra. His family migrated to Madras after his birth. He finished his SSLC in Triplicane Hindu High School. After his schooling his family migrated to Waltair (Vizag) where he completed his intermediate at AVS college.\n\nIt was while in his intermediate that SVR got interested in local Telugu drama companies, much against the wishes of his family. They sent him off to Kakinada to study further. He completed his graduation and acquired a B.Sc from P R college in Kakinada.\n\nThe family couldn't have been more wrong! Kakinada was another hub of Telugu theatre. The 'Young Mens Happy Club' (YMHC) was an active drama company. SVR joined them after college. At the age of 21 he even portrayed a role of a 60 yr old in a play and won everyone's appreciation.\n\nIn YMHC, SVR met several actors who were to become his lifelong friends and colleagues! Some of the eminent names include actress Anjali Devi, comedians Relangi and Suryakantham. They deserve a separate thread and so more about them later.\n\nSVR began an active performance career\n\nEven at an early age, SVR was better in portraying negative roles. As Malik Kafur in 'Khili Rajyapathanam', Durvasa in 'Urvashi' and Karna in 'Veera Abhimanyu', SVR was exemplary! He even acted as Antony and Shylock in Shakespeare plays!\n\nBut doing theatre didn't pay anything!\n\nThe family had given up! So, to support himself, SVR took up a small job in a fire station! The station's manager was already aware of his acting skills and was a fan. He allowed him to borrow his bike to work and do drama in the evenings.\n\nThis is an image from those days! ð\n\nIn 1945, BV Ramanand produced 'Varudhini' where SVR played the lead role. The film flopped badly! SVR got into a depression and left Andhra. Took up a job in far away Jamshedpur! But he couldn't stay long from his love for acting.\n\nSo he returned to Madras, the hub of cinema!\n\nHe got an opportunity to portray the role of an old man in the film 'Palleturi Pilla' produced by BA Subba Rao. This got him the needed publicity! Soon he had offers coming his was from big banners like Vijaya Films. He played seminal roles in some of their biggest hits.\n\nWhat more! Most of his old actor colleagues were doing films in Madras! It was a wonderful reunion of sorts! Check this lovely image with NTR, ANR, Savitri, Jamuna and Suryakantham. âº\n\nVijaya Films produced some excellent movies! Shavukaru, Patala Bhairavi, Chandrahaaram, Pelli Chesi Choodu, Bangaru Papa and so forth!\n\nSVR's role as a mantrika in Patala Bhairavi was epic!\n\nAnd the biggest role he is still remembered came from Vijaya Films's iconic 'Maya Bazaar'.\n\nHere SVR portrayed the role of Ghatotkacha! The film was a blockbuster hit! It continues to be a hit!\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos\n\nMaya Bazaar was a huge success! Crossed 100 days! Check this poster, exactly from 4th July 1957! More than anyone else in that movie, it was SVR who stole the show with his acting!\n\nOne could write a whole book about this film itself! âº\n\nSVR was hailed as a superstar! Big brands came to him for endorsements and advertising! ð\n\nCheck him out endorsing Wills Berkeley cigarettes!\n\nIn 1961, SVR's role as Keechaka in the movie 'Nartanasala' earned him the best actor award at the Afro-Asian Film Festival held in Jakarta! ð\n\nHere are a couple of stills from that film. The subtitles here are LOL!\n\n'Nartanasala' also earned SVR the coveted President of India award that year. âº\n\nIn 1965, Kamalakar Kameshwar Rao produced 'Pandava Vanavasamu' where SVR played the role of Duryodhana. Yet another phenomenal success!\n\nListen to another wonderful Telugu actor, comedian Brahmanandam garu recite an SVR dialogue from Pandava Vanavasamu.\n\nThis is Duryodhana looking at his reflection in a mirror and talking. Truly epic!\n\nâº ð\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos\n\nDespite all the fame and success, SVR didn't forget his humble beginnings as a struggling theatre actor. He was always indebted to the stage for honing him as an actor as he would announce in his numerous speeches later.\n\nCheck this image from an older gathering of the YMHC. âº\n\nHe was one of the three original Raos who ruled the Telugu cinema along with NTR and ANR. The others like Gummadi and Kantha Rao joined in later.\n\nSVR wasn't limited to Telugu cinema alone, that is where he gave his best. He even got into Tamil movies.\n\nCheck this lovely song 'Muthuku Muthaga'\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos\n\nIn 1968, SVR produced and directed two movies. One was 'Chadarangam'. The other movie 'Bandhavyalu' from where this image is. Both movies won the Andhra State awards.\n\nAfter that he decided his main forte wasn't directing but acting! And he gave more brilliant performances! âº\n\nOne of my all time favourite movies is 'Bhakta Prahlada' from 1967. SVR played the demon king Hiranyakashipu, also acting were Anjali Devi, Rojaramani as Prahlada and Carnatic musician Dr Mangalampalli Balamurali Krishna as Narada. âº\n\nThis climax scene from 'Bhakta Prahlada' is epic! ð\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos\n\nIn 1972, the legendary cartoonist and illustrator Bapu Garu directed 'Sampoorna Ramayanam' starring Shoban Babu as Lord Rama and SVR as Ravana.\n\nYet another epic film! âº\n\nSVR's role as Ravana was outstanding! The film can be watched even now! âº\n\nI love this scene that introduces SVR as Ravana! Here Ravana is worshipping Lord Shiva with the famous Shiva Tandava Stotram. âº\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos\n\nSVR with another Telugu icon! The greatest playback singer in the history of Telugu cinema, Ghantasala Venkateshwara Rao! Who sang for a number of movies SVR acted in. âº\n\nI have SO MUCH information on SVR, I could write a whole book! But that is for another time!\n\nWill end this thread with how SVR continues to be remembered today. Several statues of his have been installed in his memory. This is on the Godavari Gattu Road in Rajamundry. âº\n\nThis is SVR immortalized in one of his famous roles in Eluru! âº\n\nThis is in Vijayawada! âº\n\nDon't know which other actor is remembered this fondly everywhere in Andhra!\n\nThis is illustrator and director Bapu Garu's wonderful poem dedicated to SVR. âº\n\nYou'll enjoy it better if you can read Telugu.\n\nIn 2013, the department of posts released a special 5 rupee stamp in honour of SVR. âºð\n\nHe acted in over 300 Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and Malayalam movies. Over a thousand different dramas! Numerous film awards came his way. He easily deserved the Padma Awards but that didn't happen.\n\nAfter a glorious life dedicated to arts, he passed away on 18th July 1974 in Madras.\n\nSVR has also inspired several other things including the traditional Navaratri Bommala Koluvu or Golu both in Andhra and Tamil Nadu.\n\nCheck these images from different places! âºð\n\nThe second one, I think, is from @krupage's collection. âº\n\nLong live SVR! ð\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?\n\nYou can try to force a refresh.\n\nLike this thread?

A true legend and icon of Telugu cinema, some one we can be justly proud of.\n\nIf NTR bought alive Rama and Krishna on the screen, SVR did the same with negative characters like Ravana, Duryodhana, Narakasura, Hiranyakasipu, Keechaka, like none other. His tall frame, flawless diction, made him very suitable for those roles.\n\nI would actually say, SVR did not \"act\", he rather lived the roles on screen. One of the most natural, effortless actors ever, it never looked liked he was acting. In a sense he was like Sanjeev Kumar. He cud slip into any role, effortlessly, without fuss and live it.\n\nRead 23 tweets\n\nCrafting a Winning Cover Letter\n\nApplying for a new job can be quite a hectic process & you always want to make sure that everything you do has been prepared perfectly.

He had an interest in safe cracking( yes you read that right), and was a linguist too. He dabbled with art and samba music, could play the bongo.\n\nAnd this is why for me Richard Feynman, remains among my favorite scientists, maybe next to Tesla, not just for the work he did, but for his attitude towards life, his efforts to popularize science. And in between he could write poems, draw sketches too.\n\nRead 30 tweets\n\nToday is the 25th anniversary of one of the best days in my life.
