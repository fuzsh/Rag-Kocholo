        "text": "Thanks to Nirmal for this tag specially, as it made me go through my old posts after a long time üòÄ Here I have to link some of my old posts based on the following keywords:\n\nFamily:\n\nI have posted quite a few things about them here and there. My first post was when i spoke about My Influences in life. I don‚Äôt believe in getting inspired or influenced by public figure, because you lose your originality when you are inspired by someone out of your own circle and make them your role model. I strongly beleive that we have role models(atleast one) within our own families and following them is more appropriate. Another memorable post was about my father‚Äôs sister(my athai) whom I miss so much even today. She was A Legend in her own rights!\n\nMy Influences\n\nA Legend‚Äôs History\n\nFriends:\n\nI haven‚Äôt posted much on friends because they were always around when I needed them, so there wasn‚Äôt much of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù kind of thing. And though I have a lot of sweet memories from college and after that with my friends, I haven‚Äôt actually shared any of it here, because half of the posts went in talking about me and my problems üòÄ\n\nStill I managed to see two posts, posted out of overflow of sentiments, specially the one which I posted after watching Ullam Ketkume.\n\nUllam Ketkume more\n\nDedicated to Friendship\n\nMyself:\n\nThis blog was more or less an I,Me,Myself, that there are too many posts in this category. My very first post after the intro, and two more after that were themed on this, and I spoke almost everything about me there. Apart from that nonsense, a few memorable ones are:\n\nMy Childhood Days\n\nNicknames\n\nHome Bird\n\nMy Nightmares\n\nMy Love:\n\nI had one post about my first love. She is beautiful, hot and sexy. My own Chennai city üòÄ\n\nMy First Love\n\nApart from this, I made a few scribblings about my favorite celluloid love stories in below links:\n\nMay Maadham\n\nSachein\n\nBommarillu\n\nAnything I like:\n\nA lots were written about my favorites. Some significant ones, that exist even today and would be there even in future as as below:\n\nTrains : Train is an object of fascination for me even today. Even when I was in US, I had a train journey atleast once üôÇ\n\nBlue : Still I am filling my wardrobe with blue and the journey continues.\n\nVijay : Nothing could stop my admiration for him, however worst his movies or criticized or fare in box office. I could not get any hero in my mind and heart apart from him. üòâ I should say that now I like 10 times more than what I did when I wrote this blog post. üòÄ üòÄ\n\nIt was such a wonderful experience going thorough all those pages of blah blahs after a long time. I was a blabberer by birth I guess üòÄ Phew, written yet another big story now üòÄ\n\nI tag anyone who have read this post and who have not done this tag already, to complete this at their own leisure. üòâ\n\nVijay‚Äôs films are known for their foot tapping hit dance numbers. Devi Sri Prasad‚Äôs hit albums are popular for their peppy tunes. So a Vijay-DSP combo was expected to rock music charts with super hit peppy dance numbers. And Villu is one album that wont let your expectations down even for a minute throughout the listening.\n\nPacked with full of youthful and vibrant songs, this is a real treat for music lovers especially for those who need some refreshing music for the ears.\n\nHey Rama Rama: (9/10)\n\nThe album starts with the introduction song of Vijay as per usual tradition, and this time its Amalraj who sings for Vijay. His powerful voice with a soft touch, gives the right feel for the song especially in lines like ‚ÄúUnga kitta anba keten‚Äù. Kabilan keeps the lyrics simple and more like the words of common man, even when asking ‚ÄúAgadhi aana makkaluku, amaidhiyana naadu kaepaen‚Äù. Kovai Sarala‚Äôs harmony ‚ÄúVillu villu‚Äù sounds off note in the song, but may be justified by the visuals.\n\nNee Kobapattal Naanum: (8/10)\n\nA pleasing melody with a lots of classical orchestration this song takes you into romantic mood. Pa.Vijay‚Äôs lyrics talking about what a guy would do for his girl and what not is really interesting. Sagar‚Äôs lilting voice is a perfect choice for the song. The ‚Äúbaby I love you‚Äù bit is extremely good, so is the short rendition of swaras by DSP in second interlude.\n\nDaddy Mummy: (9/10)\n\nDSP has used effectively the Aakalesthe from Shankardada Zindabad for this song. Rendered stylishly by Mamta Mohandas, this song is a perfect club number with good beats throughout. Naveen Madhav joins for the male bit in the middle and does a good job too. Lyrics by Viveka is good in parts but on the whole enjoyable.\n\nAre you crazy: (8/10)\n\nThis short song running for less than a minute is a funny bit full of scoldings from a girl towards her guy. Sung by Divya, this is one perfect ring tone material to amuse people around you. Prabhudeva‚Äôs name in lyrics credit is a pleasant surprise.\n\nJalsa: (10/10)\n\nSame as the tune of title song of telugu film Jalsa, this song has a lot of energy and vibrance that instantly gets on you when you start listening to it. The Spanish lyrics in the beginning and lines like ‚ÄúThe dance in the beat prabhudeva, the beat in music is DSP, the girl in the groove nayanthara, and to rock the floor Ilayathalapathy‚Äù give the song a very special feel. Most acclaimed Indian rapper Baba Sehgal has done a great job with his singing that too with right diction, and Rita supports him well. Rohini‚Äôs lyrics also need a worthy mention here‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNee pirandhadhu Greece ah, Nee valarndhadhu swiss-ah, madhimayakkum un nadayin mugavari thaan Paris ah‚Äù Definitely the best of the album.\n\nVaada Maapilla: (8/10)\n\nThis is a folk based song with lot of funny words thrown in between. You get to hear voices of Vadivelu(Dont angry me) and Prabhudeva at couple of places. Tippu and Rita do justice to the song while Kabilan‚Äôs lyrics are quite ordinary. Indicates more of a visual treat but worth a listen too. ‚ÄúEppidi Eppidi??? Appidi Appidi‚Äù is really cute.\n\nDheemthanakka Thillana:(9/10)\n\nThis is a constantly paced song with fast beats and a good amount of energy. Snehan‚Äôs lyrics fits the tune perfectly, especially lines like ‚ÄúKannan‚Ä¶ naan kannanukke annan‚Ä¶ ada leelaigalin mannan‚Ä¶ andha manmadhanin maaman naan thaane‚Äù and use of Telugu words like ‚ÄúOkka saari‚Äù. Devi Sri Prasad joins Divya for this song and both have done a great job in keeping the momentum of the song. Divya‚Äôs voice has this sexy feel to it which works out very well for this song.\n\nJalsa Remix: (8/10)\n\nThis is a remix version of the other song with DSP singing along with Baba Sehgal and Rita. Neatly done without spoiling lyrics and not too much of rap for a remix. The pleasing orchestration and remix programming is an added advantage. Perfect number for dance floors.\n\nOn the whole, its an album that will be readily lapped up by Vijay fans and will appeal to all youth. On top of that, this is an album that will attract every music lover for its clean and neat presentation of songs.\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\n\nVerdict: Hits Right on target\n\nThis blog post is dedicated to all fans, well-wishers, fanatics, one sided lovers and husbands by self-imagination of the cutest actress of Indian Cinema ‚Äì Genelia D‚Äô Souza.\n\nGenelia began her acting career as this tom boyish high society girl Harini, in the film Boys. She was too good for a new comer and it was the first transition of the girl in a parker pen ad to an amateur actress. And after that there was no looking back. Hit or flop, single or double heroine subjects, tamil, hindi or telugu, she left her unforgettable impressions in each and every film she had acted over these very few years. An impression that cannot be erased by time, impression in the hearts of people.\n\nAn MBA graduate, she has managed her career very well in this male dominated film industry, by acting in films where she had a very good footage on par with the hero. What matters more than that is the way she had played her roles, most of them will become void without her presence. It becomes unimaginable to place an X or Y actress in her roles.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine anyone in place of the egoistic and short tempered Shalini (Sachein), innocent and obedient Madhumathi (Happy), the bubbly and adorable, the immortal Haasini (Bommarillu).. From Harini to Haasini, her roles speak for herself, including the latest Hindi flick Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Naa. And Haasini was her second transition to a matured actress where she proved her talents and walked away with all accolades.\n\nThe industry has seen actresses who became popular through serious roles, dialogue delivery, dance, deglamorized roles, controversial acts etc etc. But Genelia has walked her way through people‚Äôs hearts as herself. An angel in the disguise of girl next door.\n\nHer cuteness, innocence, the child like smile, those expressive eyes have stolen a number of hearts just like that. She has got the best dressing sense among the actresses of today and whatever she wears never crosses the the boundary of glamour and vulgarity. She is also an excellent dancer, who dances as gracefully as a female can do.\n\nShe has loads of talents to be explored, tonnes of best performances to be given to her fans. May God bless her with all successes and good luck, and let she remain the ever smiling Haasini of our hearts!!\n\n‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•HAPPY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•BIRTHDAY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•GENELIA!‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•\n\nMy choice of favorite songs is based on the singers who sing the songs and not by the music director or the actors who act in it. I dont like many of the hit songs just because of the fact I don‚Äôt like the voices in it or by the way it was sung. I feel that a voice that can hold your senses is what is important in a song and then comes the music and lyrics.\n\nOn the other hand, favorite movies have a different criteria. Unless I like the actor and actress in the movie, I never even bother to look at the promos of the movie on TV, however good it is and how many ever people recommend me to watch it. A face that makes you feel happy is more important according to me, and the director, story and plot takes a next preferences.\n\nThe above tendency makes me meditate on a few songs and movies again and again till I get bored, or till I get a new favorite. This post is just to mention about few of such songs and movies that I enjoyed recently.\n\nI watched just 4 movies ever since I left India, call it lack of time or interest. First one was Horton hears a who, that I watched on my way in flight. Horton was made familiar to me by Vinodh once during a chat and so i decided to watch it. It was a cool animation film with a cute and affectionate elephant as the central character.\n\nNext was Office Space, recommended by Balaji. Its a movie made almost a decade ago but is very much inline with today‚Äôs corporate scenario, especially in IT world. Should really appreciate the director‚Äôs forethought.\n\nThen I watched Billa just for the curiosity of what was there in it, that it was hyped so much by everyone. I totally disliked Rajinikanth‚Äôs Billa and felt there is nothing worth to remake in it. But I was wrong, because this version of Billa was something more inline with today‚Äôs genre of movies. It was different to watch Ajith with less dialogues and swear lines(which I feel he is very bad at) and Nayanthara was definitely lots better than a plumpy and bad looking Sripriya. There are lot of negatives about the film but it was a good time pass and the cameraman Nirav Shah and the stylists should be appreciated for packaging the movie very well.\n\nThen finally, I watched Taare Zameen Par, a long time pending movie in my list. It was a very emotional and touching movie especially in the second half after Aamir Khan enters. As everyone who watched the movie said, I could not control my tears towards the end. That kid Darsheel has acted extremely well and realistic and deserves lots of awards for his performance. A unique movie in this age of Hindi movies full of sex, violence and horrible comedy.\n\nComing to new music that I heard in recent past, one album thats lingering in my mind always is Sakkarakatti. I never had any liking towards Rahman‚Äôs Hindi albums hat had come in past 4-5 years so its exciting everytime a new album of Rahman is released in Tamil. Sakkarakatti is one album that is worth the excitement.\n\nTaxi Taxi is a very peppy and youthful number that opens up with a bang. Lyrics by Muthukumar about friendship are very catchy. Benny Dayal shines in his western avtar and Blaaze‚Äôs rap is simply cool. The excellent harmony(Viviane Chaix and Javed Ali) with the Latin(or Spanish?) style beats foils well with the song‚Äôs flow. Inspite of a westernised number with rap, its very pleasing to the ears unlike the efforts on same lines by other music directors. A song that has already gotten into my list of infinite loop numbers üòõ\n\nMarudhaani is what Rahman is best at. Melody with western beats. Yet another ‚ÄúMa‚Äù series song Rahman-Vaali combo. The interludes by Rahman himself and the harmony are excellent. I wish Madhushree sings atleast a single song without errors, but everytime she gives Tamil words a hindi face. A Sadhana Sargam or Shreya Ghosal would have definitely a better job, but Madhushree is Rahman‚Äôs constant choice. Inspite of all, this is an outstanding melody number from this album, that reminds us Rahman of the last decade.\n\nI miss you has a different pattern of music like Thazhuvudhu Nazhuvudhu and Maaja Maaja, but this sounded to me a tonnes better than those two. Chinmayi‚Äôs voice has a sweet innocence attached to it, which gives the song a special feel. The constant paced and simple beats throughout the song is too good and does not eat up the words.\n\nChinnamma Chilakamma is the tune of the song with same title from Meenaxi. I thoroughly enjoyed this song because I hated the original version by Sukhwinder singh. Benny Dayal is one of those few singers who pronounces words with prefection and does not eat them up in the name of singing. The clarity in his voice is amazing and his voice is as powerful as Sonu Nigam‚Äôs in Hindi songs. He is a gifted singer for Tamil Cinema. Chinmayi does her part well, but don‚Äôt know why she was made to sing like Sayanora Philip or Malgudi Shubha in parts? üôÇ Lyrics by Pa.Vijay are pretty ordinary and shows clearly that they are written for the tune.\n\nElay is of the same genre Roobaroo from Rang De Basanti and has a similar pattern. It has a very pleasing effect when you hear it. The violin and guitar that plays all through is brilliant. Lyrics by Muthukumar is more of youthful imagination(and surprisingly not childish) and enjoyable. Krish and Naresh iyer do a brilliant job.\n\nNaan Eppodhu is the same tune as Yeh Rishta from Meenaxi, sung by same Reena Bharadwaj. Reena has a beautiful voice but an awful Tamil diction. Same thing as said about choice of voices earlier. I wish she sings atleats a single line in the song without mistakes but not a single line till the end üò¶ The dhol beat thats there throughout the song and lots of string instruments used give the song a divine feel. Pa Vijay‚Äôs lyrics are simple and meaningful.\n\nOverall, its a great experience for any Rahman fan to listen to this album. Full of youthful vibe‚Ä¶ Now all that has to be seen is how well these great songs are shot on screen üôÇ\n\nOn the other hand, listening to Sathyam was an ultimate boring experience and it is the worst album from Harris Jayaraj I have ever heard. There is not even a single song that I liked to hear once again. A very forgetful album! Same with the case of Jayam Kondan, Thenavettu and Kuselan. Saroja sounded good only for a couple of songs(Cheeky Cheeky and Dhosth Bada Dhosth).\n\nBanner: Red Giant Movies\n\nProduced by: Udhayanidhi Stalin\n\nDirected by: Dharani\n\nMusic: Vidhyasagar\n\nCast: Vijay, Trisha, Vivek, Suman, Manivannan, Ashish Vidhyarthi\n\nKuruvi, one of the biggest releases of this summer, had lot of expectations with the comeback of Ghilli team and with Dharani promising something more than Ghilli. Truth is, the film just lives upto the name of an average commercial entertainer. Dharani who made the best ever remake in Ghilli and made us enjoy Dhil and Dhool has stopped with a half baked effort this time and has let Vijay carry the film for him.\n\nVetrivel(Vijay), living with his huge family in Chennai goes to Malaysia as ‚ÄúKuruvi‚Äù along with his friend Ops(Vivek) to get a pending payment from Gocha(Suman) and clear off his family debts. There he finds himself betrayed and in the chase for Gocha, he ends up getting his sister Devi (Trisha) fall in love with him. Vetrivel and Ops return to India stealing a diamond from Gocha along with Devi who elopes in search of her Kuruvi. Gocha comes to India in search of the diamond, finds Vetrivel and reveals lots of hidden secrets about the whereabouts of Vetrivel‚Äôs father who is considered as missing by the family. The rest of the film is about how Vetrivel wins over Gocha and his aides to save his father and how Trisha unites with her Kuruvi.\n\nThe director moves the film in right direction till the end of first half. Thereafter, in his quest to project Vijay as a super (natural??!!) hero and satisfy the die hard fans of Vijay, Dharani has taken painful efforts to the let the screenplay move carelessly, drenched in blood and gore with lots of spicy masala thrown in.\n\nConsidering this is an action film, action sequences are surprisingly the main drawbacks of the film, barring a well composed club fight in the first half. Many stunts are unbelievably overdone with poor visual effects aimed at only projecting the super hero power, ultimately evoking from the viewer a totally different reaction than what it is supposed to do.\n\nSongs have been shot well, choreography in Dandaana Darna and Mozha Mozhanu song is a treat for eyes. Vidhyasagar‚Äôs background score too is impressive. Gopinath‚Äôs camera work, VT Vijayan‚Äôs editing and Maniraj‚Äôs art direction does an awesome threesome magic for the film. Scenes shot in Malaysia and the rusty look of second half deserve special mention.\n\nVijay is at his usual best in dance, action, comedy and expressions. He has handled the whole second half by himself where director has taken a back seat adding less value to the film. The extremely over the top punches and one sided fight sequences may go down well with the die hard Vijay fans but for the normal audience, a feel of boredom creeps up after a point.\n\nTrisha has performed her role well, acts vibrant, looks cute and shares an excellent chemistry with Vijay in scenes and songs. Vivek in first half is a major advantage for the film and does a great job as Vijay‚Äôs friend. You miss him in the second half where expect a couple of songs and few lighter moments, all you get to see is violence. Suman and Aasish Vidhyarthi as villans are just fine while other villains deafen you most of the time. The supporting cast of the film has done a very good job, Saranya, Manivannan and the small kid in the quarry being noteworthy mentions.\n\nThe content and the edge-of-the-seat excitement of Ghilli is surely missing in Kuruvi, but even if you forget Ghilli and look at Kuruvi as a normal entertainer, there is a serious lack of director‚Äôs work and only Vijay remains in the film. Lifted scenes/ideas from other films, unwise packaging of fun filled first half and fan desired second half and a loose story line are Dharani‚Äôs major mistakes in Kuruvi. Better luck next time Dharani!\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10\n\nVerdict: Kuruvi ‚Äì Flying with limits and limitations\n\nIt is a very well known fact that Vijay‚Äôs film songs are 50% audio and 50% visuals. Yet another known fact is that songs of Dharani-Vidyasagar combo are strictly for mass, and it has been proved through films like Dhool, Ghilli and Bangaram. That said, the trio of Vijay-Dharani-Vidhyasagar have delivered in ‚ÄúKuruvi‚Äù more than what is expected out of them ‚Äì An album that satisfies all Vijay fans and a good time pass for neutral fans.\n\nPeppy, loud and full of energy, it is the right mix for Vijay fans if you leave aside senseless comparisions with things of past. Anyone who listens to the album in a low mood is sure to get an high spirit, to say the least. It is definitely a break away from the usual class-melody routine that Vidhyasagar has been through for the past couple of years.\n\nNow over to the songs‚Ä¶.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nSingers: Sunidhi Chauhan, Yogi B, Dr.Burn\n\nLyrics: Na. Muthukumar\n\nThe album starts with a loud bang with this number which I call in my terms as ‚ÄúTechno Kuthu‚Äù. Sunidhi singing Tamil folk is something new and she is brilliant as ever. The Tamil Rap by Yogi B and Dr.Burn is equally enjoyable. The heavy percussions provide the perfect accompaniment for the song.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nDandaana Darna\n\nLyrics: Kabilan\n\nSingers: Sangeeth Haldipur\n\nThis is the third time in a row we get to hear Vijay‚Äôs intro song in a different voice than the usual Shankar Mahadevan/Tippu. Use of new voice renders a fresh feel to the song and Vidhyasagar has rightly taken a note of this aspect. Sangeeth Haldipur, the famous Marathi music composer/singer and part of Channel [V] Pop stars 2, does the honours this time. For a first time non-Tamilian singer, he has managed to do a good job and delivered what is required of him ‚Äì right feel, energy and heavy throated singing. What Pokkiri Pongal is for Pokkiri, Dandaana Darna is for Kurvi.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nThaen Thaen Thaen\n\nLyrics: Yugabharathi\n\nSingers: Udit Narayanan, Shreya Ghosal\n\nVidhyasagar‚Äôs melodies always have a unique feel to it and he is at his usual best here too. The hindustani tune with Arabian style of orchestration gives the song a lilting touch. Shreya Ghosal yet again proves that nothing is sweeter than her voice, while Udit Narayanan too does a good job if you can forgive his awkward diction at a few places. This is one song that has the right elements to attract anyone after first few listenings. A slow poison.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nPalaanadhu Palaanadhu\n\nLyrics: Pa. Vijay\n\nSingers: Vidhyasagar, S. Rajalakshmi\n\nIf you loved Thottu Thottu Pesum Sulthana(Edhirum Pudhirum) or Ithunoondu Muthathile(Dhool) of Dharani-Vidhyasagar combo, you will surely love this too. Composed in Bhangra style with lots of techno beats mixed with the Punjabi Dhol, this song will leave you dancing for the exitement it provides is magical. Thankfully, Vidhyasagar has chosen the right song for him to sing and Rajalakshmi of ‚ÄúKokku Para Para‚Äù fame does a good job too.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nTheme Music\n\nLyrics: Na. Muthukumar\n\nSingers: Praveen Mani, Dr Burn, Ranina and Suvi\n\nWith varying paces, possibly to be used at various situations in the film, this a rocking music bit filled with lots of mass lyrics, that will leave Vijay fans mesmerised. You may get a feel of Kabadi Kabadi of Ghilli westernised, but this song has more than that to offer. The heavy guitar fused with traditional folk percussions does what it is intended to do ‚Äì rushing up the adrenaline.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nMozha Mozhanu\n\nLyrics: Pa. Vijay\n\nSingers: K.K, Anuradha Sriram\n\nThe least best is saved for the last. This is a song whose success is heavily dependent on the picturisation because the music has nothing great to talk about. Vidhyasagar-KK-Anuradha combo of the unforgettable Appadi Podu has done a mediocre job here. The disappointment leaves you searching for Srikanth Deva or Dheena as Guest composers in the credits. Completely folk in all aspects, this is clearly targetted for front benchers. Nothing without a reason, visuals will speak on that.\n\nRating: 6.5/10\n\nPluses: Fresh voices, simple and neat presentation\n\nMinuses: Lyrics are mediocre, songs are targeted only at the youth\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10\n\nVerdict: Good\n\nTagged by Shrinivas personally.
