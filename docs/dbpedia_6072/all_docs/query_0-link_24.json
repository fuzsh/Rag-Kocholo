Lakshmi Narasayamma.[10][11] His grandfather was working as a doctor in the town. He had relatives scattered in East Godavari district. His grandfather, Kotayya Naidu, lived in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu.[3]\n\nHis mother, Lakshmi Narasayamma, a staunch devotee of Lord Venkateswara, named the boy after him. Ranga Rao was sent to Madras, where he completed his schooling at Hindu College. He also studied in Eluru and Visakhapatnam.[3] At an early age of 12, he showed interest in stage acting. He ventured into acting after completing his bachelor's degree in sciences.[10][11][15]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nS. V. R. got an invitation from one of his relatives, B. V. Ramanandam, to play the lead actor in his film Varoodhini (1947). He immediately abandoned the job, and left for Salem to join the celluloid world. However, the film didn’t do well at the box office.[3][4]\n\nS. V. R. left Madras Presidency and reached Jamshedpur, where he took up the job as a budget assistant with the Tata company.[4][15] However, his love for theatre began to bloom multifold. At this juncture, he married Badeti Leelavathi on 27 December 1947. In the days that followed, S. V. R. was given an opportunity to appear in Palletoori Pilla (1950), produced by B. A. Subba Rao.[10] Shavukaru (1950) earned him recognition as a fine actor.[3][4]\n\nHis role as the antagonist 'Nepala Manthrikudu', a tantric in Pathala Bhairavi (1951) was a turning point in his career.[12][4] The film became a breakthrough for both Ranga Rao and the lead actor N. T. Rama Rao. Pathala Bhairavi was the only south Indian film screened at the first International Film Festival of India.[16][17][18] Ranga Rao also starred in the enduring classics Mayabazar (1957) and Nartanasala (1963), featured in the CNN-IBN's list of \"100 greatest Indian films of all time\".[19]\n\nIn a career spanning nearly three decades, he acted in over 160 films —109 in Telugu and 53 in Tamil.[12] He was one of the earliest stars to feature in commercials and his ad for the popular cigarette brand Berkeley, was extremely popular.[12]\n\nCharacters essayed\n\n[edit]\n\nAkbar in Anarkali\n\nBanasura in Usha Parinayam\n\nBhishma in Bala Bharatam\n\nBhoja in Mahakavi Kalidasu\n\nDaksha in Dakshayagnam\n\nDuryodhana in Pandava Vanavasam\n\nGhatotkacha in Mayabazar\n\nHarischandra in Harischandra\n\nHiranyakashipu in Bhakta Prahlada\n\nKamsa in Yashoda Krishna and Srikrishna Leelalu\n\nKeechaka in Narthanasala\n\nMayasura in Bhookailas\n\nNarakasura in Vinayaka Chaviti and Deepavali\n\nRajaraja Narendra in Sarangadhara\n\nRavana in Sampoorna Ramayanam\n\nTandra Paparayudu in Bobbili Yuddham\n\nUgrasena in Guna Sundari\n\nYama in Sati Savitri\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nRanga Rao married Leelavati, daughter of Badeti Venkata Ramayya and Koteswaramma on 27 December 1947. They have three children: two daughters, Vijaya and Prameela and a son, Koteswara Rao.[10]\n\nRanga Rao wanted to launch his son into films and shot a few portions. But the film didn’t take off for unknown reasons.[4] He was a pet-lover, owned two German Shepherds at his residence. Ranga Rao was a poet and also wrote short stories for a few publications and nurtured a love for cricket, painting, hunting.[4]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nRanga Rao suffered from heart attack at Hyderabad in February 1974.

But rangarao neglected doctors words.unfortunately he suffered from Another heart stroke on 18 July 1974 at Madras it proved fatal and the actor died before any medical treatment could be administered.\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernment of Andhra Pradesh instituted an award in his memory, presented every year to the best character acting performance, known as the S. V. Ranga Rao Award for Best Character Actor.[2]\n\nA bust-size bronze statue of Ranga Rao was unveiled by popular actor Chiranjeevi at Tummalapall Kalakshetram in Vijayawada in 2010.[20] In 2018, N. Chandrababu Naidu, then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh unveiled a 12.5 feet bronze statue of Ranga Rao at Kalaparru on the outskirts of Eluru and announced that the state government was planning to establish a museum on Ranga Rao in Eluru.[21][15]\n\nSrivathsan Nadadhur of The Hindu wrote of him during his birth centenary in 2018 as follows, \"S V Ranga Rao’s diction, towering on-screen persona, impressive quirks to his character-sketches, the ability to draw inspiration from society and literature have cemented his ‘irreplaceable’ stature over the years.\"[4]\n\nCV Aravind of The News Minute wrote of him in 2018, \"SV Ranga Rao was ranked on par with the superstars of the 1950s, 60s and 70s such as N. T .Rama Rao, Nageswara Rao, M. G. Ramachandran, and Sivaji Ganesan. Ranga Rao was one of the earliest to be hailed as a ‘method’ actor and a substandard performance from him was simply out of the question. Rated as one of the most dignified and cooperative stars, he was held in high regard by the acting fraternity.\"[12]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nInternational honors\n\nBest Actor Award - 3rd Afro-Asian
