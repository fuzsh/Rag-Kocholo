Four all-woman teams, consisting of inspectors and sub-inspectors, were fanned out to various parts of the city. The rescued women were provided shelter at the government-run Swadhar Homes at Chinamushirwada.\n\nAt a news conference here Monday, deputy commissioner of police (Law and Order I) CM Trivikrama Varma said that as an initiative to rescue destitute women, the city women police in four teams had fanned out and conducted special drives in four divisions across the city and rescued 16 women. He also said that the teams were also in search of mentally retarded women and found a person at VUDA building and admitted her into a hospital for treatment. ”Destitute women are seen generally at the bus stops or railway stations and various places in the city.\n\nThey do not have any families or any type of protection. In order to rescue them, this is an initiative from the Visakhapatnam police department,” said police inspector D Bangaru Papa. Among the 16 rescued women, one is a Bangladeshi and others are destitute orphans or runaways. “At present the Swadhar Homes can accommodate 50 women. It has necessary staff and provides food and other essential things.\n\nCI D Bangaru Papa’s Appeal: I”If people find any lonely woman or even mentally retarded roaming in the streets or any other place, do not hesitate to report to the police department. We would admit them into the Swadhar Homes.”"
