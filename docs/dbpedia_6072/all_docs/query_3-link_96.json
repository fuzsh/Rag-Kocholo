        "text": "Sobhan Babu (January 14, 1937 - March 20, 2008), professionally and popularly known as Shoban Babu, was a Tollywood film actor.\n\nBorn as Uppu Sobhana Chalapathi Rao to a middle-class family, Sobhan went on to become a romantic icon and was the top Tollywood hero for two decades. He made his film debut with Daivabalam directed by Vasanthkumar Reddy, but his first film to hit the screens was Bhakta Sabari.\n\nShobhan's Manushulu Maarali ran for 25 weeks, a record-breaking achievement in those days. He received the Filmfare Award four times, the Nandi Award five times and the AP Cine Goers Award eight times.\n\nBackground\n\nThe son of Uppu Suryanarayana Rao, Babu had three sisters Dhanaranga, Jhansi and Nirmala, and a brother, Sambasiva Rao.\n\nBabu completed his initial schooling in Kuntamukkula Mylavaram. He pursued his Intermediate in Vijayawada and finished his degree at Andhra-Christian College in Guntur. Later, he studied law in Chennai, but ultimately discontinued it.\n\nHe married Shanta Kumari on 15 May 1958; they had a son, Karuna Seshu and three daughters: Mrudula, Prashanti and Nivedita.\n\nBabu's first film was Bhakta Sabari. Chitrapu Narayana Murthy was his first director. His film Manushulu Maarali ran for 25 weeks which was a record at that time. His first colour film was Kannavari Kalalu.For the first time he went abroad for a film shooting for Ramudu-Parasuramudu. He made a dual role in Potti Pleader for the first time.\n\nHe was honored with several Nandi Awards by the state of Andhra Pradesh. He was given the honorific, \"Natabooshana\", which became his last name in Movie credits .\n\nDuring the 1970's he was also the lover of Jayalalitha who later went on to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. In reply to a report in a 1978 issue of the Bombay-based Star and Style magazine, implying that she and Shobhan Babu had parted ways, Jayalalitha confirmed that the relationship was strong and they were \"going steady\".\n\nUnconfirmed reports and friends-later-turned-enemies like Valampuri John have insisted that Jayalalitha had a daughter named Shobhana, who was born of this liaison with Shobhan Babu\n\nCareer\n\nSobhan Babu made his debut in the film Daivabalam. After that he acted in many films playing small roles.\n\nVeerabhimanyu (1965) was his first movie as a \"solo hero\". This movie turned out to be a big hit. However, he still played small roles in many films in order to earn money for his family. After the huge success of Manushulu Maarali, he acted in films until 1997.\n\nThe highlight of Shoban Babu's career was the three consecutive Film Fare awards he won between 1974-1976 (1974 - Khaidi Babayi, 1975 - JeevanaJyothi, and 1976 - Soggadu). This was a record for the Telugu film industry. Babu was only the second actor (after Dilip Kumar) to receive three consecutive Filmfare trophies.\n\nHis rise in the acting industry was also a boon to producers with Babu's successive hits including Veerabhimanyu, Manushulumaarali, Kalyanamantapam, and Tahsildhargaari Ammaayi, which garned Babu a large fan base.\n\nSobhanbabu had paired up with Sarada for several films and they were a hit pair. It was a unique combination. Sobhan Babu known for his glamour and Sarada for her outstanding, performance-oriented roles.\n\nThough several senior artists had lost their earnings either by producing films or in some other way, Sobhanbabu had a planned career. He invested all his earnings in real estate. After his retirement he lead a peaceful life with a complete happy family with sons, daughters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law and grandchildren. At the end of his career, he chose some character artiste roles and finally retired from films.\n\nAwards\n\nFilm fare Awards (4): 1971, 1974, 1976, 1979\n\nNandi Best Actor Award from AP Govt (5): 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1976\n\nAP Cinegoers Award (8) : 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1985, 1989\n\nMadras Film Fans Award (9) : 1971, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1984, 1985\n\nVamsi Berkely Award (3) : 1978, 1984, 1985\n\nAP Film Fans Award (2) : 1971, 1974\n\nAndhrapatrika Award (2) : 1970, 1985\n\nFilm World (2) : 1971, 1975\n\nCentral Govt Award for the best classical film hero award (1): Bangaru Panjaram 1970\n\nFilmalaya(1) : 1975\n\nCine World(1) : 1975\n\nKalasagar(2) : 1975 1986\n\nKalasravanthi(1): 1992\n\nDeath\n\nBabu died at his home on March 20, 2008 following a heart attack at the age of 71. He is survived by four children — three daughters and one son.\n\nBorn into an agriculture family at a far-flung village Modugulapalemin Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh (20 Km from famous pilgrim centre Tirupati), Dr. M.Mohan Babu rose to become one of the most accomplished movie artistes. He is also a successful film producer, a champion of people's voice, an educationist and above all a philanthropist. His advancement is clearly marked by strict discipline, dedication and determination.\n\nHis early life is nothing short of a true film adventure. Caught in the magical ring of the tinsel world, the lad Dr. Mohan Babu could attract huge gatherings at stage plays. When he revealed to the people of his village that he intended to become a Hero, they mocked at him. Undaunted, the young colt reached the erstwhile Madras (Now Chennai), the then capital of South Indian film industry. Working as physical instructor with a YMCA degree, he continued pursuing his dream of becoming a hero. He walked in rain and experienced many a hungry night due to thin or empty pocket. Circumstances forced him to don the avatar as an assistant director, before the ace director of that time Dr Dasari Narayana Rao could change the youth's name from \"Bakthavatsalam\" to \"Mohan Babu\" and give him the first role in the film \"Swargam Narakam\".\n\nHe proved himself the best in all areas of histrionics - as a leading villain, comedian, character artiste and hero. The saga that began twenty-nine years ago had ultimately shaped Dr. Mohan Babu into a Hero of the masses. He is credited with a rare achievement of acting in 504 movies. His 100th movie as a hero is on the anvil.\n\nEstablishing Sree Vidyanikethan Educational Trust in 1992, he started an International School near Tirupati (famous pilgrim centre in Andhra Pradesh) in order to provide excellent educational facilities to the poor and downtrodden students. Soon, an engineering college and a degree college had come up. Parents from across the country and overseas have kept unbroken faith in Mohan Babu, while the students admire him as their beloved uncle.\n\nAs the Founder-Chairman of Sree Vidyaniketan Educational Institutions' he saw to it that 25% of seats are offered to students of economically poor and backward classes, apart from providing free education and boarding to them. \"Freedom from want is the real freedom\" he says and helps the poor and downtrodden in the hour of need. When people face the wrath of natural calamities and epidemics, his organization rushes to the area of devastation with medicines, food, utensils and renders liberal financial help to the victims.\n\nHe believes in not going where the path leads but instead makes a path himself leaving a trail for others. His achievements prove the saying -- Deep within the wisdom of uncertainty lies the real of life.\n\nGanguly is the seventh Indian cricketer to have played 100 Test matches. He is currently the 5th highest overall run scorer for India in Tests. He is the fourth Indian to have played in more than 300 One Day Internationals. In terms of overall runs scored in ODIs, Ganguly is the second among Indians after Sachin Tendulkar (who has the highest ODI runs in the world) and the fourth in the world. Ganguly has scored 15 centuries in Test matches and 22 in ODIs. He is one of only seven batsmen to score more than 10,000 runs in ODIs. Ganguly has 22 centuries in ODIs, in terms of number of centuries in ODIs, he is only behind Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya and Ricky Ponting. Sourav, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed by far the most successful opening pair in One Day Cricket, having amassed the highest number of century partnerships (26) for the first wicket. Together, they have scored more than 7000 runs at an average of 48.98, now with Sachin he is a world record holder for creating most no. of 50 run partnership in the first wicket(44 fifties).\n\nGanguly is the fourth player to cross 11,000 ODI runs and third player to cross 10,000 ODI runs and so far the fastest in ODI history, after Sachin Tendulkar. He also reached 6000, 7000, 8000 and 9000 ODI runs milestones in the fewest number of matches. Sourav can bowl medium-pacers as well, but has under-achieved in this aspect in Test matches, taking 31 wickets in 99 matches, at an average of 52.47. As of 2006, he is the only Indian captain to win a Test series in Pakistan (although two of the three tests of that series was led by Rahul Dravid). He is also one of the 3 players in the world to achieve amazing treble of 10,000 runs, 100 wickets and 100 catches in ODI cricket history, the others being Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya.\n\nTest\n\nCaptained India in a record 49 Test matches\n\nLed India to a record 21 Test wins\n\nHis test average has never been less than 40.\n\nODIs\n\nHold the record of most 200+ ODI partnerships (6 times) along with Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting.\n\nHolds the record, shared with Sachin Tendulkar, for most 1st wicket ODI partnerships of 175+ runs (7 times).\n\nHolds the record, shared with Mahendra Singh Dhoni, for the second highest score by an Indian cricketer in an ODI — 183, against Sri Lanka in 1999.\n\nHeld the record, shared with Sachin Tendulkar, for the highest first wicket partnership for India in an ODI match, 258, against Kenya in 2001. This record was bettered by Sri Lankan opening pair of Jayasuriya and Tharanga in 2006 at Headingley.\n\nWas involved in the first 300 run ODI partnership with Rahul Dravid.\n\nSixth on the all time list with 31 man of the match awards.\n\nHe is also the only player to win 4 consecutive man of the match awards in ODIs.\n\nIndia's most successful ODI captain.\n\nFirst Indian to score an ODI century against Australia in Australia.\n\nHighest ODI runs scorer in the world (in a calendar year) in 1997,1999,2000.\n\nThird in the list of hitting maximum number of sixes in ODIs.\n\nSecond in the list of highest number of centuries in a single calendar year ever. 7 centuries in 2000.\n\nMan of the Series awards\n\n3 Awards in Test cricket\n\n7 Awards in ODI cricket\n\nMan of the Match awards\n\n6 Awards in Test cricket\n\n31 Awards in ODI\n\nFormer India captain Sourav Ganguly said Tuesday he would retire from international cricket at the end of the upcoming four-Test series against Australia.\n\n\"This will be my last series,\" Ganguly, 36, told reporters after a training session ahead of the first Test starting in Bangalore on Thursday.\n\n\"Before coming here, I spoke to my team-mates and hopefully I will go out with a winning knock.\"\n\nGanguly was a surprise inclusion for the first two Tests after being ignored for the five-day domestic Irani Cup tie last month, regarded as a trial match for the series.\n\nThere was media speculation that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had struck a deal with Ganguly to give him a graceful exit, provided he agreed to quit after the series.\n\nGanguly denied the charge, but admitted he was disapointed at being left out for the Irani Cup, and surprised when the selectors picked him for the Tests.\n\n\"The speculation about my future has been going on for a long time, but I categorically deny any talk of a 'voluntary retirement scheme', which is what the media is calling it,\" he said.\n\n\"Such things do not happen in sport. Having played for so many years, one knows when the time is up.\"\n\nGanguly, who made his Test debut in 1996, is the first of India's five veterans -- dubbed the 'fab five' -- to finally put an end to their long careers.\n\nThe others are Sachin Tendulkar, 35, who needs only 77 more runs to overtake Brian Lara as Test cricket's leading scorer, skipper Anil Kumble, who turns 38 later this month, Ragul Dravid, 35, and Venkatsai Laxman, 33.\n\nGanguly was India's most successful Test captain with 21 wins in 49 matches before he was sacked in 2005 following a public spat with then Coach Greg Chappell.\n\nThe elegant left-hander has so far scored 6,888 runs in 109 Tests at an average of 41.74 with 15 centuries.\n\nGanguly finished his one-day career with 11,363 runs in 311 matches, one of only seven batsmen in the world to cross the 10,000-run mark in limited-overs cricket.\n\nIndia's chairman of selectors Krishnamachari Srikkanth said Ganguly had informed him of his decision to quit earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\"He had a good chat with me and fellow selector Narendra Hirwani,\" Srikkanth, the former Test opener, told reporters.\n\n\"He wants a peaceful series without any troubles on his mind. I hope he goes out with a couple of hundreds.\n\n\"Ganguly was one of the best captains the world has ever produced and I think he deserves a rousing farewell.\"\n\nGanguly, an unpopular choice for his Test debut in England in 1996, silenced his critics with a century in his first match at Lord's.\n\nBut he became a cult figure around the country when he led India to a thrilling 2-1 win over Steve Waugh's world champion Australian side at home in 2001.\n\nAll seemed lost for India when Waugh's men wrapped up the first Test in Mumbai in three days and made the hosts follow on 274 runs behind in the second match in Kolkata's Eden Gardens.\n\nIndia, however, conjured up a remarkable fightback on the back of Laxman's extraordinary 281 to win the Kolkata Test by 171 runs and then clinched the series with a two-wicket humdinger in Chennai.\n\nGanguly also captained India to the World Cup final in South Africa in 2003, where they lost to Australia.\n\nNandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (born May 20, 1983) more popularly known as Jr. NTR or just NTR. He is the grandson of the Late Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao, who was a legendary actor and former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is fondly called as Tarak by his family, friends and close associates.\n\nCareer\n\nNTR began his career as a child actor and dancer. His first step into Tollywood was with the movie \"Bala Ramayanam\", directed by Gunasekhar. He made his first film after he grew older, Ninnu Choodalani, in 2001, but it failed to perform well at the box office. He went on to gain fame with Student No. 1 (also released in 2001), directed by S.S. Rajamouli, followed by Subbu and Aadi. In January 2003, Rao's film Naaga performed poorly. However, in July 2003 Simhadri became the highest grossing film of the year in Tollywood, and made Rao and director Rajamouli household names.\n\nHis first release of 2004, Andhrawala, flopped at the box office, though the next film, Samba, did better, and was at the top of the box office for fifty days.
