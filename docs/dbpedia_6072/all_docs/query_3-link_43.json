This document discusses Satyajit Ray's films and their portrayal of realism in post-independence Indian cinema. It argues that Ray captured the \"double take of modernism\" by showing modern subjectivity as split or displaced from past selves. Ray grappled with defining the present through literary and genre conventions while also drawing on repressed dimensions of cultural tradition. The document analyzes Ray's realist strategies and their ability to authenticate modernity by surfacing connections to the past. It suggests Ray's work engaged with defining contemporary social experience as a cinematic genre. In Ray's later film Jana Aranya, narrative fails to contain the energies of popular caricature, shifting the terms of authenticating the present.",
