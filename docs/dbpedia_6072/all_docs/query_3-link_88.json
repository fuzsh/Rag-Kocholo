        "text": "PROFESSIONAL\n\nJayasudha was born as Sujatha to a Telugu speaking Brahmin family in Madras, Tamil Nadu on 17 December 1958. Her aunt is the famous actress and director Vijaya Nirmala. Jayasudha made her film debut when she was twelve years old as Jamuna's daughter in the Telugu film Panduntikaapuram. Her next break came in two Tamil films directed by the celebrated director K. Balachander: Arangettram and Apoorva Raagangal. The latter became a big hit. Her fame quickly spread, where Telugu film producers were offering her good film roles. While her debut role as heroine in the Telugu film Lakshmana Rekha (1975) got her attention, it was really the title role in Jyothi (1976 film) (remake of the Hindi film Mili starring Jaya Bhaduri) that made her a huge star in Telugu films. She was now called a successor to the great Telugu actress Savitri and performed many strong roles and showed excellent range.\n\nShe is given the title \"Sahaja Nati\" which means \"spontaneous/lively actress.\" Her roles varied from the cute looking teeny bopper who wore minis in Nomu (1974) to the battered wife of a sadist husband(Chiranjeevi) in Idi Katha Kaadu, to that of a comedienne who discovers that her husband wants to murder her for her wealth in \"Money.\" She performed showy roles in Telugu remakes of Hindi films, such as Yugandhar (1979) (the fighter role that Zeenat Aman originated in Don (1978 film)), Illalu (1981) (Reena Roy's dark-shaded role from Apnapan (1977)), etc. In commercial cinema, she received a huge break when she starred in Adavi Ramudu (1977), which broke box office records.\n\nShe acted in 225 Telugu films, and in one year, she had 24 film releases. She accomplished all this, despite her illiteracy in Telugu, by having people read lines to her and she would remember and deliver her lines.\n\nShe became such a famous actress that she starred in a film Jayasudha (1982), named after her. Her fame also allowed producers to cast her sister Subhashini in supporting roles in some of the films that she starred in, such as Sivaranjani (1978), \"Doctor Cine-actor\" and Meghasandesam (1983). Subhashini's daughter Pooja is now a budding actress.\n\nShe joined recently in Congress Party and became as MLA.\n\nJayasudha is a granddaughter of eminent scholar and literary historian, Nidudavolu Venkatarao.\n\nJayasudha married producer Nitin Kapoor, cousin to actor Jeetendra. They married in 1985 and have two children, Sons Nihar (born in 1986) and Shreayan (born in 1990)."
