        "text": "The 1950s and 1960s was a glorious time for Telugu cinema and saw the rule of the two titans NT Rama Rao (NTR) and Akkineni Nageswara Rao (ANR) besides others like S V Ranga Rao, Gummadi, Jaggaiah, Relangi, Savitri, Jamuna and so on.\n\nHere's an alphabetical take on the best in Telugu cinema from the 1930s till today:\n\nA for Ardhangi (1955)\n\nDirector: P Pullaiah\n\nCast: Savitri, ANR, Gummadi, Shantakumari\n\nBased on the Bengali novel Swayamsiddha by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyaya, this tale, set against a zamindari backdrop featured an excellent performance by Savitri, who plays the role of Padma who is forced to marry a timid, illiterate man addicted to opium (fed by his stepmother) and later transforms him completely.\n\nWhile taking up this challenge, she had to contend with a scheming mother-in-law and brother-in-law. The film is remembered for Savitri's brilliant performance.\n\nDirector: B N Reddy\n\nCast: S V Ranga Rao, Krishnakumari, Jaggaiah\n\nThis was a touching tale about human relationships. It was also set in a zamindari milieu with S V Ranga Rao as the zamindar. Good lyrics by Devullapalli Krishna Sastri and melodious music by Adhepalli Rama Rao were other highlights of the film.\n\nBangaru Papa won the Silver Medal at the National Awards for this film.\n\nDirector: Ramineedu Gutha\n\nCast: Savitri, Balaiah, Kanta Rao\n\nSavitri reached the pinnacle of her career with this film. Chivaraku Migiledi is the remake of the Bengali film Deep Jwele Jai starring Suchitra Sen and directed by Asit Sen in 1959.\n\nIt's the story of a nurse in a psychiatric hospital who offers emotional support to patients suffering from mental trauma. She is part of the therapy the hospital adopts to treat these patients but has to often disentangle herself from emotional attachments to the patients.\n\nSavitri's performance was heart-wrenching in Chivaraku Migiledi (What's left at the end). It's not surprising she got a National Award for best actress for the film. The same story was made in Hindi in 1969 as Khamoshi with Waheeda Rehman in the central role.\n\nDirector: K Kameswara Rao\n\nCast: S V Ranga Rao, NTR, ANR, Savitri, Jamuna, Suryakantham\n\nThis film, with an ensemble cast of all the stellar performers of those times, was a good family drama and an unforgettable film.\n\nEach of the actors got into the skin of his or her character so well and delivered great performances.\n\nYet again, the songs of Ghantasala were huge hits.\n\nDirector: A Kodandarami Reddy\n\nCast: Chiranjeevi, Madhavi, Sumalatha, Rao Gopala Rao\n\nThis was the first big hit that propelled Chiranjeevi to the top league in the industry and gave him his first taste of stardom.\n\nThis film had everything--action, romance, emotions-- and was a trendsetter of sorts.\n\nChiranjeevi gave a riveting performance as Suryam in this revenge drama where he is falsely accused of killing his father and sister by the village landlord played by Rao Gopal Rao.\n\nDirector: C Pullaiah and C S Rao\n\nCast: NTR, Anjali Devi, Chittor V Nagaiah, Master Nagaraju, Master Subrahmanyam\n\nThis film is based on the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana. It had 37 songs and padyams and the music was composed by Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao.\n\nIt was a blockbuster and was in the making for five years. While C Pullaiah began it in 1958, his son C S Rao took over and completed it.\n\nDirector: Krish (Radhakrishna) Jagarlamudi\n\nCast: Allu Arjun, Manoj Manchu, Anushka Shetty, Manoj Bajpai, Saranya\n\nVedam stars Allu Arjun, Manchu Manoj and Anushka Shetty and takes its inspiration from a true-life story.\n\nKrish strung together five stories of five different individuals. It was a contemporary tale written and filmed well.\n\nKeeravani's music along with meaningful lyrics and his background score enhanced the film greatly.\n\nSome fine performances added depth and intensity and moved the audience a great deal. Krish's effort was outstanding."
