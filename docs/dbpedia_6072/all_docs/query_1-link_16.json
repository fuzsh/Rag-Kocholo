        "text": "Well, there are a lot of movies which has had an impact on me..but as a child I liked the movie Masoom..in which Jugal Hansraj played the role of as a child artist. Other than this, Rang De Basanti and Chak De India...and of course Dil to pagal hai..which I now dread..because this movie was released when I was in school..and this movie made us or forced us to romanticize about the concept of valentine's day.which is of course not real.\n\nAnswered 10 years ago\n\nI loved watching 'Mere Apne' that had Meena Kumari, Vinod Khanna and Shatru as a young one. The movie was all about two goons of a small locality but they both took care of an old lady played by Meena Kumari.\n\nAnswered 11 years ago\n\nfor me \"khoobsoorat\" is one film which makes me energise. The role Rekha played in the film was inspiring and always give me some sort of courage that with our behaviour we can change anyone.\n\nAnswered 11 years ago"
