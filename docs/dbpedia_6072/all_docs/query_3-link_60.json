After that the film was not materialised. Harish Shankar’s next film now is going to star NTR. When asked Harish Shankar if this film is MLA, Harish said he is doing an entirely different script for this film and it is going to be an entertainer. The reason for the change of subject could be that there are many political films that are released in this gap like Shakuni.\n\nEega gets U/A certificate\n\nEega film got censored today and obtained U/A certificate by the censor board.

The phrase ‘e-kaa-daa’ became instantly popular. The butler English of the warden is also a hit with the masses. It is reliably learnt that his latest film Seetamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu has a satire on the slang of Vijayawada as heroes characters (Mahesh Babu and Venkatesh) are from Vijayawada. You have to wait and watch how hilariously these scenes came out once the movie hits the marquee in September. The teaser released in the last month-end generated tremendous response. Dil Raju produces this film.\n\nDCM music launch on 16 June\n\nThe music of Puri Jagan’s latest film Devudu Chesina Manushulu is bought for a good price by Sony Music.

The theatrical trailer of his latest film Avunu (click here to watch it) is released with Endukante Premanta film and creating nice buzz. Speaking to idlebrain.com, Ravi Babu said the purpose of this trailer is to explain the genre of the movie and get more eye balls. He has chosen a black and white old film format to narrate the story of the film and then ended the trailer with title justification. He says that it’s inspired by a true story that is narrated by an actress who worked with him in the past. This film has family orientation with thrilling elements. He is producing this movie on his home banner Flying Frogs with the support of Suresh Productions and PVP Cinema.\n\nRam getting roasted in Guntur\n\nRam is known for his uttermost dedication when it come to his acting profession. Since his latest movie in the direction of Bommarillu Bhaskar has market yard backdrop, the producer Bhogavalli Prasad fixed on the famous Guntur Mirchi Market yard. This market yard works for all the days of an year except for 30 days in summer which is unbearable to work. The producer has hired that market yard for shoot when it is closed down. Since Guntur is known for extremeties in heat during the summer, the entire unit is forced to undergo a gruelling schedule in this scorching summer.\n\nDasari buys Julayi\n\nAs per the sources of idlebrain.com, Siri Media owned by Dasari Narayana Rao has bought the theatrical rights of Allu Arjun’s latest film Julayi for entire Andhra Pradesh.

As per the last tweet of Rajamouli, Eega is supposed to go for censoring on 21 May and is touted to release by 30 May. However, the last minute delay in graphic work prompted him to postpone the release to next month and the buyers were supposedly informed that Eega will release by the middle of June. Hence Sravanthi Ravi Kishore has planned to release EP on 1st June. However, sudden rumors about Bala Krishna’s Adhinayakudu being planned in 1st June seem to have prompted some confusion among the trading circles. With YS Jagan’s alleged future arrest and the subsequent turmoil might also add more doubts regarding film releases during this time. It is also learnt that Endukante Premanta is going for censoring tomorrow. We have to wait for the exact release date from the horse’s mouth soon!\n\nSekhar Kammula at his own pace\n\nThough recognized as a popular film director, Sekhar Kammula still is not a part of typical film nagar set up. He makes movies in his own and sells them in his own way. Despite getting continuous blockbuster, he has not become commercial. He has arranged a press meet and announced for star hunt 3rd September 2010. He has taken a lot of time to select new actors and start the movie ‘Life is Beautiful’. Sekhar Kammula doesn’t have the habit of letting media know about the progress of the movie. He comes to media only after wrapping up the movie. The distributors were given an indication that film would be ready by January 2012. However, a last minute hick-up about heroine being replaced by Shriya seemed to have prompted delay in shoot and release. The distributors are expecting the movie to release this summer.
