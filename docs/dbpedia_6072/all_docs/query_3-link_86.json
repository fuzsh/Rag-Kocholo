        "text": "Mirattal Nadigar Nambiyar\n\nMirattal Nadigar Nambiyar aka Manjeri(மஞ்சேரி) Narayanan Nambiyar the King of Villains of the Silver Screen When you hear ot talk about MGR the name that follows without saying is that of M.N.Nambiar, the dashing villain of Tamil cinema. He was the man who re-defined the portrayal of Villain, Before his times there were villains potrayed by T.S.Baliah, S.A.Natarajan etc but the way he re-wrote villain’ism was never like before. Nambiar born on March 7, 1919 in Kannur district in a Namboodhari family. His father died when Nambiar was 8 years old. His family moved to Ooty to live with his sister. He studied till third form in OOty municipal school. Nawab Rajamanickam pillai’s drama troupe was performing in OOty. Impressed by the stage presence and discipline Nambiar decided to join the troupe (he didn’t want to be a burden to his sister’s family). He travelled with the troupe to salem, mysore and was mainly given kitchen labor and finally in 1934 he was given a “Lady Judge” role in the drama “Nachu poigai” unfortunately drama was stopped by the then British government. In a way that paved a way for his Film entry\n\nNawab Rajamanickam’s “Ramdas” play was made into a film “Bhakta Ramadas” and filming was done at Bombay. Nambiar accompanied the troupe and he played the role of Madhanna in the comic pair Akkanna-Madhanna , Akkanna played by T.K.Sampangi. Nambiar was paid 40 rupees for his role. Nambiar continued to act in small roles in various dramas. The main comedian of the troupe K. Sarangapani left and that space was filled quickly by Nambiar and he became instant hit as well. His salary rose from Rs 3 to Rs 15. 1944 , Nambiar left Nawab’s troupe and joined T.K.Krishnaswamy’s troupe wherein he portrayed the role of “Rajaguru” in the drama “Kaviyin Kanavu” written by S.D.Sundaram which was a turning point in his acting career. This showcased his talent fully and brought in accolades for his acting. Audience thronged to witness the villainous performance of Nambiar and it was this performance which got 4 films from Jupiter Pictures. He portrayed comic roles in films like Vidyapathi, Rajakumari. He was cast as the leading man in the 1947 film “Kanjan”. He continued to do small roles in films like Abimanyu his break came in the name of “Velaikari” Aringar Anna’s Velaikari had powerful performances by K.R.Ramasamy, T.S.Baliah, S.V.Sahasranamam & Nambiar as moorthy (V.N.Janaki’s brother). Nambiar married his relative “Rukmani” in 1946 and marriage turned out to be lucky at least for him, yes he got the role of his life in the 1950 Modern Theatres Production, Kalaingar karunanidhi’s dialouges and Ellis.R.Dungan’s direction “Mandhiri Kumari”. The Evil look, Majestic walk and sarcastic dialogue delivery established Nambiar as the permanent Villain of Tamil films. This was also the time his friendship with MGR cemented became lifelong friendship. MGR was the best man at Nambiar’s wedding.\n\nBehind the Villain mask there was a great actor and thus film maker T.R.Sundaram(Modern theatre) casted him in a comic thriller “digambara saamiyar” Novel by Vaduvoor K. Duraisamy Ayyangar wherein Nambiar played a role which had 12 different getups .Nambiar showcased his talent brilliantly slipping into various disguise roles with ease and fetched a great name for him. Slowly Nambiar started featuring as villain in every movie. Sarvadhirgari, Marmayogi and movies followed him. He also continued in small roles as well. He acted as a young lover boy in the movie Kanna thalli/Petra thaai which marked the debut of our Isayarasi Smt.Psusheela as a playback singer. Movies continued in the form of Mangalyam(APNagarajan and nambiar played best friends), Guna sundari, Pennarasi, Makkalai petra magarasi(Can we forget the brilliant song “Ondru serndha anbu maruma by PBS & Udutha sarojini featuring Nambiar & MNRajam written by Maruthakasi & composed by KVM) In 1952 Nambiar featured in an English film titled “Jungle” Nambiar was cast mostly in aged villain roles especially his role as Shakuni in Mayabazar and the cunning uncle Naganathan in Sivaji Ganesan Starrer “Uthama puthiran” Both these films had stellar performance of Nambiar.\n\nSlowly Nambiar established himself as the prime villain especially in MGR films. Sword fight scenes between him & MGR are quite popular even now. No other actor-villain fights have impressed the audience as much as this duo.. Their Sword fight scenes were real and both the actors did it with ease and at times they did get hurt but never worried. It became in evitable that every movie Historical/Mythological movie both the actors featured had quite number of sword fight scenes making the audience’s money worth a watch. Almost every movie made in late 50’s and 60’s had Nambiar as the Villain. In spite tough competition from actors like P.S.Veerappa, Nambiar retained his spot as the main baddie. Even when youngster like Asokan started villain roles Nambiar also featured In those movies as the gang leader or the so called “BOSS”. His screen presence in every film he was part of is still a delight to watch. Nambiar was beyond camps. While he audience cursed him for whipping the innocent MGR in Enga Veetu pillai, they threw stones at the screen when he demeans the naïve Raman who is in love with Devaki in Raman ethanai ramanadi. Thus he was able to fit himself in any role and never bothered about the hero of the film. His movies with MGR gave him the “cult villain status” and when we say MGR’s name even today , Nambiar’s name follows automatically. The duo did films like NAdodi Mannan, Rajarajan, Arasilankumari, panathottam, thali bhagyam, Nadodi, naan anai ittal, kavalkaran,rahasiya police 115, kudiyirundha kovil,pudhiya bhoomi, pallandu vazhga, ninaithathai mudippavan,neethikku thalaivanangu and the evergreen “Ayirathil oruvan” . His role as the “Pirate leader” in Ayirathil oruvan is remembered still now. The way he cheats Manimaran and develops a liking for Poonkodi and tortures all the slaves speak volume for his acting ability.\n\nHe was equally comfortable with NAdigar thilagam as well. Thangamalai rahasiyam, uthamaputhiran ,Ambikapathy, bhaga pirivinai, pasamalar,thillana mohanambal, sivandha mann, Kulama gunama(I like his role in this movie a lot), thangaikkaga, ponoonjal and the brilliant baladevar in Raja raja chozhan. His role as a devoted friend in bhoolaka ramba alongside Gemini also fetched a good name for him. He was at ease with youngsters like Jaishankar, Ravichandran and many more. His best portrayal came in the form of C.V.Sridhar’s Nenjam Marapadhillai. His acting as the old man who awaits even after 2 generations to separate the lovers. His daring outlook sent chills down the spine for the audience. This was Nambiar’s role of his life and no one but Nambiar could do that role and also it was his favorite role as well. Nenjam Marapadhillai is for sure unforgettable. Having had physical training in the drama troupe, he practised yoga and played badminton regular classes in sword fighting and martial arts kept him fit and my friend Balaji(Ramanujam) son of actor Parthiban(Jackson durai) confirmed that his dad used to visit Nambiar’s house and often witnessed him in menace pose doing yoga. He was also the pioneer to introduce mannerism for main Villain with his various expressions and body language. Every film had a different mannerism. The bad guy of Tamil films was too good of a person in real life. Often we end up hearing stories for reel heroes becoming real life Villains Nambiar was quite opposite. He never had outside food and always had food cooked by his wife Rukmani. He practiced yoga and was so spiritual and above all a staunch Iyyappa swami follower and was the main reason for many film makers and actors to take up spirituality and practice pious observance and thus fondly called as “Guru swamy”\n\nDuring 80’s when the film scene was changing, new film makers with new ideas were attempted and thus Villain Nambiar became character Nambiar. Playing character roles was not new to him. Many might not know that he did a fantastic cook role in B.Vittalacharya’s “Pen kulathin Pon Vilakku” which had humor and sarcasm and the way he brings Gemini to the household is hilarious to watch. He played a Brahmin pundit in subadinam alongside G.Shakuntala and his role was full of humor as well. He did character roles in movies like Ellorum innattu mannar, pasamalar, bhagapirivinai so essaying character roles was nothing new to him then but having established as an Evil villain the second innings should have an memorable start and that came in the name of K.Bhagyaraj who is known for his screenplay cast Nambiar as the Martial arts master in “Thooral Ninnu pochu” and Bhagyaraj gave a grand opening for Nambiar’s second innings , yes the movie opens with Nambiar chasing a goat to drink fresh goat milk was picturized very well and from then on Nambiar portrayed various roles in number of movies. His roles in movies like Dowry Kalyanam,Yejaman, Poove unakkaga, Managara kaval, Sethupathi IPS etc. His comedy with various generation of comedians is popular even now especially with Gowndamani & Senthil. In a career spanning 71 years Nambiar acted with almost 6 generation of actors including Starting with MGR ,sivaji,Gemini, jaishankar, ravichandran, kamal, rajinikanth, vijayakanth, satyaraj, sarathkumar , simbu, vikram etc. He also acted in television serials like Velan & Alaigal. The reel life villain whose scary image stands tall in our memory even now but lived a simple, clean life in real which is a rare phenomenon and that is Nambiar. His acting is unforgettable – yes “Nenjam Marapadhillai’\n\nWill come back soon with another artiste - Rajesh Lavanya\n\nKaalathai Vendra Shankar aka K.Shankar\n\nKaalathai Vendra Shankar aka K.Shankar.\n\nMany might know only the Shankar who made Indian, Robo etc but there was another eminent film maker K.Shankar Who had a long film career spanning more than 40 yrs. Kunnessiri Shankar was born in Palakkad district since his family moved to Coimbatore he did his studies there. Due to family/financial status he then started working and landed in a asst editor job in a cinema studio. In 1939 he joined Central Studios and then in Pakshiraja studios. During that period AVM was functioning from KAraikudi and they used to frequent pakshiraja studios for editing and thus Shankar was hepful for the AVM crew. Shankar also protected the Vedhala ulagam film reel from fire and thus made an impression on AVM. Also Mr M.V.Raman who was working under AVM Chettiar was impressed by Shankar’s involvement took him along when AVM migrated from Karaikudi to Chennai. Thus the man born in Palakkad, who was working in Coimbatore landed in Chennai - the city of dreams .He continued as editor in the AVM productions. An editor can become an excellent director and thus Shankar got the opportunity to direct first ever film, a Sinhala film “Doctor” under AVM banner. He continued to direct few other films especially bhakta ravana (hindi), bookailas(telugu) & bookailasa(Kannada) in the year 1957-1958. The film became super hit in all 3 languages and K.Shankar became noticeable among film makers. After spending 12-13 years in AVM, Shankar decided to move on so he came out of AVM and directed his first outside film “Ore Vazhi” meaning “Only Way” in 1959 which was produced by Vasu menon. This film had Prem Nazir doing the male lead. After the success of Malai itta mangai Kavingar Kannadasan produced an epic movie which dealt the story about Maruthupandiar brothers “Sivagangai Seemai” for which he chose Shankar to be the director. This film was God’s gift for Shankar as he was able to prove how good of a director he was. Though the film was a commercial failure the way the scenes were narrated and how he picturized the songs were all noticed by many film makers. Shankar & Mellisai Chakravarthy MSV’s association started with this film and they went on to become one of the longest career combo until 2000s (Vetri Vinayagar). Thendral vandhu veesadho, kanavu kanden, imaiyum vizhiyum, Sandhu pottu all classic songs from Sivagangai seemai tuned by MSV-TKR for the bful lyrics of Kaviyarasar are classic even today. Thus K.Shankar became a prime director. Films followed him. Kaviyarasar’s next venture Kavalai illadha manidhan (pirakkum podhum azhugindran). His major hit came in the form of Kairasi. It had Gemini Ganesh & Sarojadevi in lead. Melodious tunes by R.Govardanam master (kannum kannum pesiyadhu, anbulla athan vanakkam, kaathirundhen kaathirundhen, kaalamenum aatrinile all became popular), great story and of course fine direction by Shankar made the film a great success. Shankar excelled in choosing stories as well. Being an editor himself and now a director he played the role brilliant in identifying his stories. During that time he also started directing Malayalam & Hindi films. He also broke the myth of bhimsingh’s “Pa” series by directing another hit movie produced by Saravana films G.N.Velumani “Paadha kaanikkai” starring Gemini ganesh, Savithiri, Asokan,vijayakumari, MRR, MVrajamma, SVsubbiah,CKsaraswathi,master kamalhassan & JPchandrababu. Film was a great success and Shankar was successful in social drama as well. 1962-63 These years mark the new association of Shankar with Nadigar thilagam & also with Makkal thilagam. Shankar knew NT from the days of parasakthi when he was in AVM. From being a normal colleague they became friends and when Shankar first directed NT in PSV pictures“AAlayamani” it was like renewing the friendship which was going to last forever. He went on to direct more than 10 films of Sivaji Ganesan. Remember I mentioned about his story selection. He proves yet again in “Aalayamani”. What a tricky subject he chose and the way he directed it nothing but amazing. Especially the scenes involving NT,SSR & Sarojadevi. He brought in the “Anniyan” concept way back in 60’s and excelled in it. NT was class as usual obsessed with “Meena” doll and his hidden past while SSR was brilliant as the friend caught between his lover and best friend and SAro caught between 2 men all showcased their talent and movie was a runaway success and K.Shankar established himself as a brilliant director in TFM. During the same time to his surprise, he gets a call from Thalaivar’s (Puratchi thalaivar)office and he goes there thinking what would it be for. To his amusement thalaivar who is a great lover of arts has been following Shankar’s work so far and impressed by his talent he request Shankar direct his next film for G.N.Velumani. Production Company is already a home for Shankar but directing MGR was big question for him. He expressed his concern stating “I’m directing NT,Gemini and others and may be my style would not suit you and moreover the story you have is not my style” instantly MGR says “story will be changed according to your wish” and thus Shankar directed the hit film “PAnathottam” and his perception about MGR and his camp changed and a new association bloomed from then on. He directed more than 8-9 films of MGR as well thus Shankar became the only director who directed both Sivaji and MGR at the same time and handled their subjects very well. In the same year he gave hits like Aadiperukku(music by AMRaja), Ezhai pangalan(KVM) both with Gemini Ganesh. He also directed Ra .Ki.Rangarajan’s story with no star value actors except kannamba in “Idhu satyam”. Film had Asokan,Chandrakantha, Kannamba & others. Then came another critical story “Aandavan Kattalai” which dealt about a bachelor Professor falling for a student and blamed as a killer. Time & again his film making, taste for good music and the way of capturing songs all were too good and this movie was blockbuster. Can we forget the devotional “aaru maname aaru andha andavan kattalai aaru” thought provoking lyrics by Kaviyarasar. The evergreen NT-Devika TMS-PS duet “amaidhiyana nadhiyinile odam”. Classical melodies by MSV-TKR all paved the way for the film’s grand success. Shankar did not get carried away by the fact that he was able to direct both Puratchi thalaivar & Nadigar Thilagam at the same time. He continued what he knows best so time and again he directed movies with others and proved his caliber outside MT/NT arena as well. He directed a folklore movie “Veerakkanal” starring Gemini Ganesh & Anjalidevi which was a moderate hit He gave a super hit for AVM-Saravana films combined production “Panjavarna kili” which had Jai doing 2 roles , Muthuraman, KRVijaya and others. Shankar loved tamil and all his films had atleast 1 bharathiyar, bharathidasan songs. Panchavarna kili had the great song by Bharathidasan which talks about the greatness of Tamil language and who else but MSV-TKR can tune for such a lyrical beauty and who else but the only Nightingale of India Smt P.Susheela can render it. Yes “thamizhukkum amudhenru per” what a song. It stands the testimony after so many years and recently few youngsters have sung this same song and that video became viral in social media. Such is the impact of this song created some 40 yrs back and this captures Shankar’s taste in good music. Movie was a package of different story and wonderful songs especially the evergreen lullaby “Kannan varuvan kadhai solluvan”, lovely azhagan muruganidam all by P.Suseela Lyrics by Vaali. Vaali was asked to pen a counter song to bharathidasan’s Thamizhukkum amudhendru and he did a fantastic job in “Avalukkum thamizhendru per”. Thus Panjavarna kili is still remembered for wonderful songs by MSV-TKR and shankar’s direction. Shankar again took up a fantasy subject mixing Sivakamiyin sabatham into a social movie yes “KAlangarai Vilakkam”. Another super hit movie in Shankar-Puratchi thalaivar combo. What a making by Shankar. If you haven’t watched the movie yet please watch in youtube. The scene with the movie begins is an example for Shankar’s brilliant take. Night effect, car in road and a girl running .. Shankar hit sixer with just that 1 scene. Rest is history. Kalangarai vilakkam MSV’s solo hit and Mellisai chakravarthy proved again why he is the king of Light music. Re-recording for this movie is a class by itself. Ofcourse do we need to talk about songs.. everyone knows in depth about it. Pon ezhil poothathu (panju’s lyrics), Ennai marandhathen(again panju) Sange muzhangu(bharathidasan), Kaatru vanga ponen, pallavan pallavi padattume & enna uravo -3 TMS solos by Vaali. During the shooting of Kalangarai vilakkam, MGR found out that Shankar is in search of a groom for his daughter and immediately telephoned his brother M.G.Chakrapani requesting shankar’s daughter to be married to their son Ramamoorthy and thus MGR brought Shankar into the family. This not only proves the greatness of MGR but also his affection towards Shankar. He also started directing hindi movies like Jhoola( sunil dutt,vaijayanthi mala), Rajkumar (starring shammi Kapoor, sadhana) His stint with NT continued in the form of Anbukkarangal , while his association with MGR continued with hit movies like chandrodayam, kudiyirundha kovil. MGR first directed Nadodi mannan and then he planned a magnum opus “Adimai pen” with Sarojadevi, K.r.vijaya, rathna but got dropped due to various reasons and when he took up the project again he asked none other than his friend Shankar to be the captain and Shankar accepted and did amazing job. Can we forget Adimai pen, Jaipur palace shots. All brilliant direction by Shankar. Two notable singers TMS & ALRaghavan produced movie “Kallum kaniyagum” and they invited Shankar to direct their maiden venture and as usual he did amazing job. He continued to direct in hindi and also MGR films like pallandu vazhga(onre kulam endru), Uzhaikkum karangal, indru pol endrum vazhga Every human goes through changes as we grow and our interest and attention towards god automatically catches up after a certain age and Shankar who was making various social type movies switched gears to devotion with 1978’s super hit movie “Varuvan Vadivelan”. He continued what APN was doing once. May be Shankar might have felt the need for Devotional movies due to the scenario prevailed at that time. He made Devotional films one after another majority of which had music by MSV. Varuvan Vadivelan, Bala Nagamma, Devi Darisanam, Thaai Mookambikai. He is the creator behind the classic “Janani Janani”. Situation by Shankar, Music by Illayaraja and mesmerizing lyrics by Vaali. Classic indeed. Devotional movies continued in the form of Ayiram kannudayal, Raja rishi, Navagraha nayagi,Yaamirukka Bayamen, Deviyin thiruvilayadal, Nambinar keduvathillai, Suprabatham,Mupperum deviyar, Velundu vinaiyillai, Mupperum deviyar, Meenakshi thiruvilayadal, sabari malayil thanga sooryodayam,vetri vinayagar. His continuous making of Devotional movies landed him the title “Irai arul kalaiselvar” K.Shankar. During this period he did direct few social movies for his friends, Miruthanga chakravrthy,Chiranjeevi for Sivaji SSR’s last film Irattai manidhan (inspired from Golmal) was directed by Shankar as well. Vayasu ponnu, Neelakadalin orathil were also in his kitty. While he was directing Bookailasa in AVM(1957-58) both NTR & ANR were impressed by his work. Years later in 1979 he directed NTR & latha in Srungara ramudu. Shankar was the one to take Puratchi thalaivar to Mookambikai temple Thus K.Shankar is an unforgettable personality in the Tamil film Industry but unfortunately we don’t get to see anyone speak about him like we do for KB, Sridhar and few others K.B(my fav), C.V.Sridhar are great but eminent directors like P.Neelakantan, Dada mirasi, P.Madhavan, D.yoganand, K.Shankar, A.C.Thirulogachander all made a great impact to TFM and we should definitely appreciate these talented directors as well. Will come back with another artist soon Rajesh Lavanya.\n\nAll time Melodious Raja (A.M.Raja)\n\nAll time Melodious Raja (A.M.Raja)\n\nNow that noise of fire crackers have reduced post Deepavali, let’s remember the man behind the Deepavali song which has been aired the most number of times since it was created. Yes “unnai kandu naan aada ennai kandu nee aada ullasam pongum deepavali “ from KAlyana Parisu. Music by A.M.Raja, wonderful lyrics by Pattukottai kalyana sundaram & beautifully rendered by Smt P.Susheela. Rajah hails from Chittoor District, having lost his father at his young age their family moved to the then survival land “Madras” Raja was trained in Carnatic and Western Classical and was also influenced in the hindi songs & ghazals during that time. He composed few telugu songs for HMV and thus got to know K.V.Mahadevan. Listening to the Songs he composed & sung for HMV in All India Radio Gemini Studio owner Sri S.S.Vasan was very much impressed and thus Raja sang “Samsaaram” track for the movie Samsaaram in 1951. When the music world was dominated by heavy Carnatic based male voices here came a guy with a mild voice which delivered every emotion with ease and with perfect shruthi. When it comes to happy romance or sad romance Raja had it in his voice. After Samsaaram his career began sky rocketing. He sang the samsaaram title track in all languages including hindi. He started to sing in all languages and for all actors till late 50’s. He was the popular numero uno singer during that period. He along with Jikki went to Bombay for the first time to record Tamil & Telugu versions of Aah and thus he was the first singer from south to go to Bombay to record under a hindi music director. Raja sang for all heroes starting with MGR (Genova ) and many films including the mayakkum malai pozhuthe nee po po(With jikki), kan moodum velaiyilum (with P.Suseela), Sivaji ganesan in several movies, NTR, A.Nageswara rao in many early telugu movies , Prem nazir & Sathyan in Malayalam too, Rajkumar, udayakumar in kannada. Especially in Malayalam Raja was accepted instantly and he sang so many Malayalam songs and to an extent became the voice for Sathyan. Same thing happened to him in Tamil. Gemini ganesh who portrayed soft romantic characters in many movies had Raja sing for him and became Gemini’s permanent voice until G.Ramanathan made P.B.Srinivas sing for Gemini. Raja was offered a music director role in Genova along with 2 others (T.A.KAlyanam & M.S.Gnanamani) but for some reasons he passed it on M.S.V. years later he composed his first movie in telugu (Shoba 1958) but it was genius C.V.Sridhar who gave Raja the perfect Music director status with his Kalyana PArisu (pelli kanuka in telugu ) and with that Sridhar became a star composer as well. Raja was the only person to be successful as singer & composer simultaneously (hemant kumar in hindi). What I mean is composing and singing for his movies and for other music directors as well. Also he was the only singer to be popular in all the languages at that time and have sung equal amount of songs in all languages. Besides tamil & telugu he sang fantastic songs in Malayalam. G.Devarajan who encouraged A.M.Raja with brilliant compositions and thus A.M.Raja was a star singer in Malayalam as well. As a composer he had composed for great films like Kalyana parisu, then nilavu, vidi velli, for Sridhar and Aadi perukku for K.Shankar and this was his last film in the 60’s. he was a man of a kind with little bit of ego and thus became enemy for him & his music and created his own down fall. Later in 70’s V.Kumar and Shankar ganesh brought him back and he sang super songs like senthamaraye senthenmozhiye, Raasi nalla raasi and his voice was as melodious as it was in 50’s He has acted in few telugu movies as well. The telugu original for Adutha veetu pen – Pakkinti Ammayi Starring Relangi as the hero (played by T.R.Ramachandran in tamil) and the singer /guru voice for Relangi was played b Raja himself (played by K.A.Thangavelu in tamil) Raja sang several songs in Sinhalese as well and they were quite popular. Our melody queen Smt P.Susheela started her career – a duet with raja (yedhukku azhaithai from Petra thaai) Raja was uncrowned king of the early 50’s , sought after singer –Many films many songs.. all of them were hit songs and linger in our mind even now.

Raja married Jikki and to some extent was the reason for her career downfall and since he was rigid he lost all friends and slowly faded away. He was busy with his stage shows and thus led the life happily with that. His son chandrasekar has a voice similar to him and Ilayaraja gave him a song in Rasa magan. Unfortunately he couldn’t make it big and hence there is no trace of A.M.Raja except for his songs. Whatever people say, Raja was the sough after voice of 50’s and only successful music director/singer and also equally popular in all the 4 languages.. These kind of Smooth voices are very rare and we will remember and relish his songs for ever and thus Raja lives thru ……………………. Chitralaya Sriramanna thank you for this request. I’m really happy to write about A.M.Raja and I’ve always loved his voice …. Will be back soon with another forgotten artiste – Rajesh LAvanya\n\nGenius Ramanathan (G.Ramanathan)\n\nAnother request from @chitralaya sriram anna Genius Ramanathan (G.Ramanathan) – The Musical Magician\n\nPioneer of the Trio (MSV-TKR, KVM) to bring in change in TFM (Tamil film music) what we call light music. G.Ramanathan this name was introduced to me by my dad. Dad used to say that by hearing the rhythm pattern and arrangements once could identify a Ramanathan song.. That was the identity he created for himself. Born near Srirangam, Ramanathan joined a drama troupe in his early days. He had passion to play harmonium and he quickly grasped it and became an expert. That made him play harmonioum for his brother’s hari kathas. Slowly he started to play harmonium for stage dramas and this was a gap filler in many stages which made Ramanathan more popular. Those were the days when First spoken cinema (kalidas ) was becoming famous. Calcutta’s Sagar Movietone company decided to film a Tamil stage drama live and release it as a movie. That was KAlavarishi and since Ramanthan was playing harmonium for the drama obviously he played in this film as well thus he made his entry into tinsel world. From then on many movies were started to be made and one such was vipranarayana. The music troupe had many musicians but Ramanathan had in him the leadership quality to bring in all of them together and lead them in a successful way and thus proving the ability of a music director. Also from Harikatha to stage , stage to films the transition was easy for Ramanathan. He went with the wave, learned all the new techniques which were needed and thus became successful. During that time a charming young chap who finished his studies in England started a company to make movies and his name was T.R.Sundaram. Impressed by Ramanathan’s skill he invited Ramanthan to be the music director for the film “Parasuramar” and thus Ramanthan started his innings as Music composer. Parasuramar did not do well in box office. Sundaram wanted to give huge success in his next venture and he was in that thought process while P.U.Chinnappa who also wanted to become a shining star was in a lean phase and thus Modern theatres brought in Chinappa and Ramanthan face to face.. (like sruthi & laya) for Uthama puthiran and thus a new chapter was born. Similar to Sundaram, another person from salem also started a studio to make movies and it was Mr.Nadiu and his studio was Pakshiraja. He was starting a movie with Chinappa in the lead role and G.Ramanathan was called for music and film being “aaryamala”. Chinappa played 10 roles and the movie became the milestone in his film career. Ramanthan’s music was one of the main reason for the films success. His tunes were hailed by rasikas at that time , even now. This movie displays Ramanathan’s talent not just Carnatic , even in folk tunes he created a magic. Thus Ramanthan slowly established his foot as a successful music director. After the success of Aaryamala, Pakshiraja studio made Sivakavi with the reigning super star M.K.Thiyaragaraja bhagavathar. G.Ramanathan was booked for background score since Sivan used to tune and write the songs in all MKT films. It was Sivan who made Ramanathan as the composer for this film and he himself just wrote the lyrics.. Sivakavi’s songs are still remembered not just for MKT but for G.R too. That was his class. Vadaname Chandra bimbamo , soppana vaazhvil magizhndhu stands tall even in 2015 .. that speaks for itself. G.Ramanathan used variety of raga(s) for Sivakavi and all songs are gems even if you hear them today. 1944 .. Historical achievement was to be created and followed in 1945 and 1946 . yes it was HAridas . No one can forget bhagavathar singing Manmadha leelaiyai vendrar undo to the then seduction queen T.R.Rajakumar . Bhagavathar- Ramanthan combo Haridas was served for Diwali 1944 and it was served till 1946 .. Film ran for 3 continuous years . Story, direction, MKT and of course Ramanthan’s tune all came together so well that this film was grand success. Ramanathan had a knack of using different raga , trying out different different raga for his songs. His charukesi for Manmadha leelaiyai vendrar was praised by everyone including Carnatic musicians. But fate decided something else. MKT was arrested, Pakshi raja studio owner was arrested and Ramanthan couldn’t enjoy the success of HAridas. Modern theatres Sundram was giving chances for Ramanthan even though the films didn’t fare well @ the box office .in 1947 Modern theatres produced a mega movie “Aayiram thalai vaangiya aboorva chinthamani” with V.N.Janaki in lead. All songs in this movie in the voices of S.Varalakshmi, P.S.govindan, C.T.Rajakantham, Kali N.Ratnam were great hits. His background score was also very well appreciated and thus after a brief lag Ramanathan became busy again. Films followed. Chinappa’s sudharshan , sri aandal, inbavalli etc. In Chinappa’s sudharshan All songs became popular and it was G.R who introduced T.M.S as a chorus singer in Sudharshan. Next movie was Pon mudi. Puratchi kavingar Bharatidasan’s story, screenplay & dialogues and Ramanathan’s music made Ponmudi a class by itself. Ramanathan’s music even today is remembered.. Mind blowing is the word to describe the songs in the movie . added speciality was Ramanathan himself lent his voice for the hero Narasimha barathi. The film bombed at the box office but songs are still remembered. Next major hit was with the rising star MGR (MGR’s arrival was announced with this film ), yes MAnthiri kumara. Yes of course Karunanidhi as a powerful writer’s arrival was also announced. What a combination we got for our industry. Modern theatres Manthiri kumari , MGR,S.A.Natarajan,Nambiar, MAdhuridevi in cast, G.Ramanathan’s music made this movie as classic film. Ramanathan made the non famous G.Krishnaveni to sing for the leading lady and trichy loganathan for the male lead. Jikki became so popular from this movie .. even today we remember “Vaarai Nee Vaarai” Another song ulavum thendral kaatrinile by Jikki & Loganathan is also equally popular. MAndhiri kumari still remembered for Vaarai nee varai , MGR & KAlaingar’s dialouges. As everyone ventures into producing Ramanathan too tried his hands at it. JAmindar failed , but failure didn’t teach a lesson. He produced puthuyugam which created lot of pressure and he couldn’t focus on the other commited films. This was the timewhen C.R.Subburaman, S.M.S, S.V.Venkataraman were busy,S.Rajeswarao, KVM,T.G.Lingappa, MSV each waiting for opportunities C.R.Subburaman’s untimely death made the producer of MArumagal to invite G.Ramanathan to finish the movie . His version of chinna chinna veedu katti singara veedu katti was entirely different from what subburaman composed and his version became more popular. Still it was a lean phase for Ramanathan. He went back to stage drama (MKT was in a terrible failure phase and was performing stage dramas). But luck came to Ramanathan in the name of “Thooku thooki” which became great boost for his dull phase. This is the film in which TMS was elevated to sing for the lead (Sivaji ganesan) , little did TMS knew that he would be the permanent voice for Sivaji in the coming years. TMS sang beautifully with Leela & komala and what a composition by Ramanathan (kurangilirindhu pirandhavan manidhan..) Thooku thooki was a musical movie – musical magic created by Ramanathan Be it Carnatic or folk he had covered each genre in his style and satisfying every type of music lover.. That was ramanathan. Ramanathan also sang a song for KVMahadevan in Alli petra pillai. (Ejaman petra selvame is still popular in Ramanathan’s voice) unfortunately picturized on a horse Sadharam, NAan petra selvam (naan petra selvam nalamana selvam, ka.mu sherrif’s Vaazhndhaalum yesum thaazhndhaalum yesum is still alive because of TMS and G.Ramanathan) Madurai veeran (MGR starrer) had fantastic songs by G.Ramanathan Vaanga machan vaanga, nadagamellam kanden undhan aadum vizhiyile. Movie was super hit, MGR became mass hero and G.Ramanathan started to get more offers with this success Chakravarthy thirumagal, Ambigapathi(maasila nilave nam.. what a song by TMS & P.Banumathi, sindhanai sei maname ), Aaravalli (my fav one of G.Ramanathan) Aaravalli – G.Varalakshmi as the queen, Mynavathi as her daughter but the real hero was Ramanathan.. My god he did cover every type of song in this movie.. right from Doris day’s Que sera sera (Chinna pennana pothile, chinna kutti nathana sillaraya mathuna, anbe endhan munnale, pazhakkam illadha kazhuthai kitta pathu karakkanum pala (my fav song with all comedians in one song) KArpukkarasai,puthumai pithan all songs were hit Vanangamudi – This is more special to me because it was the association of Gaana kokila Smt P.Susheela with G.Ramanathan. Though she sang a dance number in Pudhumai pithan it was Vanangamudi where Ramanathan utilized the voice so well and created magic with her voice . She sang Rajayogame paareer, Mohana punnagai sindhidum nilave, Vaazhvinile nam vaazhvinile and of course the powerful song in Thodi “Ennai pol pen allavo” pure classical song .. He made PS sing this stunning number even though Carnatic stalwart MLV was very much active (She sang va va valarmathiye va in the same film). PS sang it like a carnatic stalwart herself and even today songs from Vanangamudi are appreciated Main plus of Ramanathan was he took Carnatic tunes to street audience in their own simple way. Even a man in the last walk of life could relate and enjoy his tunes. IF ramanathan created magic for Chinnappa’s uthamaputhiran he re-created the magic in a large scale with Sivaji’s Uthama puthiran. Uthamaputhiran’s songs surpassed the uthamaputhiran of 40’s .. Such was the music. Ramanathan incorporated western music and “Yaaradi nee mohini” remains one of the best fast numbers that too in western style even now. TMS crooned this song with A.P.Komala, jikki & Jamuna rani. What a composition, arrangement and rhythm.. mind blowing.. on another side he did Mullai malar mele moikkum vandu pole TMS & PS sang it so well , P.leela sang KAathiruppan kamala kannan, PS sang a fantastic number Unnazhagai kanniyargal kandathinaale .. wow this is a brilliant composition with tough beats and PS sang it so well .. even popular today (lyrics by KSG), Anbe amuthe is another fantastic song by TMS & PS (though not popular as mullai malar mele but this is quite an interesting composition by Ramanathan), mannulagellam ponnulagaga by PS & jikki all were super duper songs.. Background score was even better than the old uthamaputhiran Ramanathan was giving good music irrespective of the film’s fate. Raja desingu,Kathavarayan,sarangathara(vasantha mullai pole), kalyanikku kalyanam But again boost came in the form of B.R.Panthulu. Panthulu produced Veerapandiya kattabomman. Even today kattabomman is remembered only in the form of Nadigar thilagam. Ramanathan’s tunes speaks volume of his caliber.. Singara kanne, Inbam pongum vennila (first duet of PBS & PS), Anjatha singam en kalai(PS), tuk tuku tukku by PS,APKomala & Svaralakshmi, pogathe pogathe en kanava.. he did a widespread of genre at the same time retaining the time period of the film.. Such was his composing skills. GRamanthan’s music also attributed to the film’s huge success. After the success of Kattabomman , Panthulu again came to Ramanthan for Kappalottiya thamizhan. Ramanthan again did amazing job in Kappalottiya thamzihan. All songs were immersed in patriotism Paarukkule nalla naadu, velli pani malayin, kaatru veli idai kannama (my favourite),endru thaniyum indha, chinna kuzhandhaigal pole all were amazing tunes by Ramanthan. Though film failed songs are heard even today. By then music was changed, MSV-TKR & KVM became the sought after MDs so Ramanathan’s opportunities reduced but he always equips him with the current trend so he gave fantasic music for KSG’s Deivathin deivam (nee illadha ulagathile one of the best of PS , kannan mana nilaiyai by sj, anname surname by PS,SJ , paatu paada vayedhuthen by PS all were super songs ) He also produced pattinathar with TMS as main lead and composed music. Songs are talked about even today. He was working in Arunagirinathar for T.R.Ramanna but fate had different story for him in the form of disease. He fell ill and went in coma , little did he knew that he wouldn’t return to the film world. Lots of losses, work pressure made him neglect his body and thus succumbed to illness.. The creative genius breathed his last on November 1963 .. But people who know MSV TKR, KVM tend to forget Ramanathan’s contribution to Tamil film music. He was the main reason rather a bridge between Carnatic and light music which then was polished by MSV-TKR. Ramanathan’s talent was way above of his contemporaries and his juniors. He was definitely a musical genius and his compostions, handling various ragas, rhythm pattern, arrangements all stands tall even now and they are music university for anyone who wants to learn music composing … References : internet, dinamalar and various sources. Thanks to @chitralaya sriram anna for requesting to write about this man !! Even though Ramanthan did not have immediate next generation in Film world, glad to see his grandson Rajesh Vaidya doing magic with Veena .. Long live Ramanthan’s name and his music. Rajesh Lavanya\n\nSerene Sudharsanam (R.Sudharsanam)\n\nSerene Sudharsanam (R.Sudharsanam)\n\nSudharsanam who? Will be the question from today’s youth but old song lovers will stop for a minute to remember and say oh Sudharsanam . But in reality we’ve forgotten this amazing composer who was once synonymous with AVM. Sudharsanam was born on 26’th April 1914. Irony that we don’t have much information about his birth place or his early days. AVM both the company and the producer –director AVMeyyappan was setting foot in the tinsel world was making good movies like Alli arjuna, Vaayadi. AVM made a huge comical hit movie Sabapathy. Next he produced another comical “En Manaivi” for which Sudharsanam master joined hands. From then on he became the in house composer for AVM. He was the one who approved all the vocal artists in AVM. He was the one who approved Isayarasi P.Susheela , S.Janaki and many more. Like Devarajan Master for Kerala, Ghantasala master for Andhra it’s our Sudharsanam master for our Tamil nadu. He was the only one who was referred as Master. I got introduced to his music in my childhood when I listened to songs like “Mahan Gandhi mahan”, Azhagiya mithilai nagarinile, Aadatha manamum aaduthe ? many more songs which made me his instant fan. Coming to En manaivi the song Sangadamana samayalai vittu sangeetham paada poren became quite popular.. Credit Sudharsanam master’s nice tune was the main reason. Next big venture of AVM was Sri Valli. New comers T.R.Mahalingam & Kumari Rukmini were the lead pair. Sudharsanam master along with Rajagopal sarma composed melodious songs. T.R.Mahalingam’s Kayatha kanagathe is popular even now. This was the first film where Rukmini’s voice was erased from the songs and replaced with P.A.Periyanayaki’s voice and all processing were done overnight and new reels were sent to all screens. Probably first of this kind .. Credit to AVM. Next big venture was Naam Iruvar . A Stage play by NSK nataka sabha wherein S.V.Sahasranamam played the lead was made as movie . T.R.Mahalingam & T.A.Jayalakshmi played the lead. This movie came when India was announced Independent and AVM added lot of patriotic songs and Sudharsanam master tuned it so well that even in Carnatic concerts these songs were sung in the same tune as it was in the movie. Baby kamala aka kumara kamala danced for the songs. Especially Poet Subramaniya bharathiyar’s Aaduvome PaLLu paaduvome in the voice of Smt D.K.Pattammal tuned by Sudharsanam master is a classic. Even now some channel or radio definitely plays this song during independence/republic days. Probably Sudharsanam master would be the first to compose/tune Poet Bharathiyar’s songs for films I think. Thus AVM and R.Sudharsanam became synonymous. If Modern theatres T.R.Sundaram firmly established his presence with the Fantasy fun fare hit “Ayiram thalai vaangiya aboorva chinthamani”, it was AVM’s turn to do a similar one and he too gave a huge hit movie in the name of “VEdhala ulagam” Sudharsanam master’s tunes are memorable even now. Bharathiyar’s Theeradha vilayattu pillai in the voice of D.K.Pattammal Almost all songs were hit. Aara imbam thanthai, kalviyile sirandha thamizh naadu , madhananga sundhara mana mohanan, thoondil puzhuvinai pol and many more songs are even remembered. Dance sequences by Kamala, Lalitha-Padmini and tunes by Sudharsanam master are evergreen. My fav comedian Sarangapani also sang a song. The next AVM venture first under “AVM studios” made him movie moghul and Sudharsanam a complete composer. Yes it was T.R.Ramachandran- Vaijayanti mala starrer Vaazhkai. Pa. Neelakantan’s Story was directed by AVM himself. Even today “Un kann unnai yemaatrinaal en mel kovam undavathen dadadada dada… sung by T.R.Ramachandran & M.S.Rajeswari will mesmerize us for the catchy tune. Sudharsanam master’s catchy compositon, K.P.Kamatchi’s lyrics and of course our own T.R.Ramachandran and dancing beauty Vaijayanti mala made this song a class. Movie was made in telugu as “Jeevitham” and BAHAR in hindi. Sudharsanam did the compostion for tamil and telugu. Not sure why AVM did not use him for hindi. AVM’s next venture was the Great C.N.Annadurai’s Or iravu. Anna wrote the screenplay and Pa.NEelakantan started his directorial innings with this movie. Movie had everything. Dance dramas, kurathi song (ayya saami aavoji sami though inspired from hindi tune),amazing songs and all tuned by Sudharasanam Master. If Naam iruvar and previous movies had songs penned by poet bharathiyar tuned by Master in this movie it was Poet bharatidasan’s song “Thunbam nergayil yaazheduthu nee “ tuned beautifully by Master and sung by V.J.Varma (don’t know much about this singer) for Akkineni NAgeswara rao & M.S.Rajeswari for Lalitha. 1952 – AVM & P.A.Perumal teamed up to make the hit stage play parasakthi as a movie. Mu.Karunanidhi wrote the script and dialouges and a new comer V.C.Ganesan was cast as the hero(though AVM wanted K.R.Ramasami), PAndaribai who acted in miniscule roles until then was cast as the heroine. Sri ranjani Jr was the sister . Though the major show stealer was Ganesan’s acting and Karunanidhi’s dialouges Sudharsanam had his share to flare . Songs like pudhu pennin manasai thottu poravare(voice MSR), Kaa kaa kaa (lyrics by udumalai Narayana kavi , voice by C.S.Jayaraman), oh rasikkum seemane (kumari kamala voice MSR), poomalai neeye puzhudhi man mele by T.S.Bhagavati . All are classic hits even today. Sudharsanam gave variety of songs in this movie which talked social reform and acquired a cult status . A star was born with this film and we got Nadigar thilagam . AVM’s next venture Gunasagari in Kannada also had Sudharsanam as composer. All the songs are loved even today by kannada music lovers. Movie was dubbed as Sathiya sodhanai in tamil . Movies like Jaathagam(PBS sang his first song), JAathaka palam, jaathaka phala all had Sudharasanam as the composer. 1953-1954 AVM did make Ladki with Vaijayantimala in lead. Same movie was made as Penn in tamil & Sangham in Telugu. Songs from Penn, Ladki & Sangham are quite popular even now Sonna sollai marandhidalamo vaa vaa by T.S.Bhagavati & M.S.Rajeswari is a super hit song. Anjali devi playing the veena & Vaijayantimala dancing is a visual treat . Sudharsanam master scores with just this gong. But all other songs are equally popular. Vaal muniayin, maadhar thammai izhivu (voice T.A.Mothi), akila bharadha pengal . Every song was popular and credit goes to Sudharsanam master. Adding feather to his cap the song Kalyanam aaha kalyanam picturized on Veenai S.Balachander sung by J.P.Chandrababu is a popular even now. Next biggest hit for AVM was the kannada movie Bedara kannappa starring young Rajkumar playing the lead and pandari bai as his wife. C.S.Jayaraman’s kannada songs Shivappa kaayo thande, Yennodey Noo Aemba were instant hit. The movie was dubbed in tamil as Vedan kannappa and TMS sang these songs(ennudaya bhava bantham, en appan andro) and music lovers in Tamil nadu went crazy .Dubbed version also ran for days (people forgot it was dubbed ). Such was the power of Rajkumar’s acting and Sudharsanam master’s songs. Next one was another major hit Chella pillai starring K.R.Ramasami,savithiri,banthulu & kannamba. Songs tuned by Sudharsanam master became very popular. (I guess producer insisted to use some of the hindi tunes), kovil kaalai nee papa, podanum kulla podanum , madana ezhil raja all were hits. This is the movie which brought TMS & PS together for the first time and then on this duo became the magical pair in TFM. Chella pillai became Vadina in telugu. Songs were equally popular in telugu. Next major venture was AVM’s Bhoo kailas in telugu & Bhoo kailasa in kannada. Movie was about Ravana and songs tuned by Sudharsanam master became super duper hit. P.Suseela’s Sundaraanga Bandeneega(sundaranga andukora), Ramana Avatara by Seerkazhi govindarajan , jaya jaya mahadeva by c.S.Jayaraman , doora neenade by AMRaja & P.Suseela and many more songs. All songs were hit in both Kannada & Telugu. It was dubbed in tamil as Bhakta Ravana. It’s still a puzzle why AVM did not make this movie in tamil. Next hit was Kula deivam with s.v.sahasranamam, pandaribai, ssr, mynavathi and rajagopal in lead. Sudharsanam master’s compositions were super hits. Kottu potta chinna machane by PS, Thaye Yasoda by MLV, vaarayo ennai paarayo with P.Leela & A.M.Raja all songs were hit. By now you can see the wide range of composition by Sudharsanam master. Early days it was Carnatic raga based songs slowly as the movie making progressed into social arena music also shifted gears to make melody which was easy at listener’s ears. Next AVM hit was Sahodari. AVM joined with Kannada stage actor Gubbi veeranna produced Sahodari. J.P.Chandrababu’s Naan oru muttalunga was a great hit. KAnandasan’s Lyrics Sudharsanam master’s tune and babu’s acting is still remembered. Another noteable song from the movie is “Pan paadum pon vanname “ picturized on NAzir & Devika. 1960 had 2 fantastic films produced by AVM One was Sivaji-padmini-ssr starrer “Deiva piravi” . What a movie and what a performance by the lead actors. Sudharsanam master gave super songs .. Anbale thediya en arivu selvam thangam C.S.Jayaraman with humming by SJ. Jamuna rani had 2 super songs sensational Kalai vayasu kattana sizeu , lovely thara thara vandhara . All were great hits. Another super hit from 1960 was “Kalathoor Kannamma” Can we forget “Kangalin vaarthaigal Puriyadho”, “aadadha manamum aaduthe both by AMRaja & P.Susheela. Arugil vandhal by AMRaja , Ammavum neeye appavum neeye by M.S.Rajeswari. all became super hit songs. Sudharsanam master’s brilliant composition and songs added to the movie’s success For few of the next AVM ventures Sudharsanam master did not compose music. (Reasons unknown) Next AVM Venture was Annai. The song which introduced me to Sudharsanam is from this movie. Annai was a super hit movie with P.Bhanumathi as the leading lady. Sudharsanam gave brilliant tunes P.Banumathi’s Poovagi kayagi is ever green even today. P.B.Srinivas & P.Susheela sang the dazzling duet “Azhagiya mithilai nagarinile” picturized on Sachu & HArinath P.Susheela’s oh buck buck buck madappura is another popular number . Cute Sachu on screen. J.P.Chandrababu sang another brilliant number for Sudharsanam master in this movie. Puthiyulla manidherallam vetri petradhillai a classic with brilliant lyrics by KAnnadasan. Overall Annai’s success can be credited to BAnumathi & Sudharsanam’s tunes. 1963 another tear jerker production by AVM was “NAanum oru pen”. Yet another social message based on color discrimination. Vijayakumari (tamil), Savithiri(telugu) and Meenakumari(hindi) did the lead. Sudharsanam composed music for both Tamil & telugu(Naadi ada janmame). Can any music lover forget the soulful “KAnna Karumai nira kanna” .. Sudharsanam master’s brilliant tune, Kaviyarasar’s apt lyrics and Isayarasi’s soulful rendition made this song a classic. This song will definitely feature in Smt P.Susheela’s top 10 songs. Such is the impact this song created. PS sang the telugu version as well. Other songs in the movie include Poo pola poo pola pirakkum by PS,TMS Yemara sonnadhu naana (one version TMS, another one PS) but pick of the album is ofcourse “KAnna karumai nira kanna” “Kannayya nallani kannayya “ in telugu as well. When this movie was made in hindi “Krishna o kale Krishna” Lata mangeshkar said to AVM that she cant sing like how Suseela has sung in the original. Such was the impact of the original tune. We’ve come to a sad end that Naanum oru pen marked the last film of AVM- R.Sudharsanam combination. Yes for reasons not known he did not compose for AVM films after NAanum oru Pen. (only AVM saravanan can clarify the reason) Meanwhile Sudharsanam did compose for few films outside AVM banner. Mu.Karunanidhi who has seen Sudharsanam from parasakthi days was impressed with him and thus Sudharsanam composed beautiful songs in Poompuhar, Poomalai & MAnimagudam. There was one another film “Anbukkrangal” which had fantastic songs composed by Sudharsanam for great lyrics by Vaali. Poompuhar – what an album by Sudharsanam master. Vaazhkayenum odam vazhangugindra paadam by KBS (lyrics mu.karunanithi) Thamizh engal uyiranadhu by PS KAaviri penne vaazhga by TMS & PS Ennai mudhal mudhalaga paartha podhu by TMS & SJ Poomalai – a different story for that period. Again master gave beautiful songs My fav is Kattai viral vellakatti by PS for Anjalidevi Ulagame edhirthaalum song by C.S.Jayaraman . Anbukkarangal – Another nice film by K.Sankar. Out of all the other films (outside AVM) this will be the best album by Sudharsanam master. Onna irukka kathukkanum, Avala sonnal, Ungal azhagenna arivenna, Ramanukke seethai all were super songs but the best of the lot is PBS PS duet “Iravu mudindhuvidum mudindhaal ..” what a song what a composition and mind blowing rendition by both..Fantastic lyrics by Vaali (picturized on K.Balaji & Manimala) Manimagudam & Kaarthigai deepam were also by Sudharsanam master. This is 1965. This was the last year in Tamil film industry. He did compose for 2 malayalam films in 1967 (Kudumbam) and 1968(Thirichadi) Thirichadi songs are even popular now “induleke , paathi vidarnal, poo pole poo pole “ all are hits When NAanum oru pen was remade in Malayalam as “Hrudayathinde nirangal” with Prabha as lead Music director Devarajan master retained the Kanna karumai nira kanna (kanna karimukhil varna) and credited Sudharsanam master in the title. Sudharsanam master did compose for few hindi films like matwala etc. but post 1968 no news about him or his compositions. Probably Music pattern change could be the reason for his fading away. Nevertheless this man should not be forgotten and as long as AVM lives he will live thru it . Sudharsanam’s brother R.Govardanam worked as assistant to his brother, MSV and then composed music for films like Pattanathil bootham & Kai rasi. In later years he was the person to conduct the orchestra in Illayaraja & MSV troupe. 2014 was the centenary of Sudharsanam master and this talented composer though forgotten lives thru the songs he created especially for AVM.. Will come back soon with another artiste Rajesh Lavanya\n\nMagnificent Kanchana aka Vasundhara devi.\n\nMagnificent Kanchana aka Vasundhara devi.\n\nGlamour & Talent doesn’t go hand in hand except for some rare people like Sarojadevi, Bharathi, JAyalalitha & KAnchana. (jaya is little odd because in glamour the feminine quotient will be less). So there we go. Another request from Chitralaya sriram anna to write about this evergreen beauty Kanchana. Quite understandable his affection for her because she was introduced in Sridhar’s film and Dad Gopu sir’s dialouges and from then on their association continued. So the request was natural and I’m indeed happy to write about Kanchana. Born on 16’th August 1939 at Vijayawada (the place which has given many artists like Ghantasala, P.Suseela & many more) she was working as Air hostess and of course many cine professionals flying would have noticed this beauty. Creators look for sharp features (in today’s world the meaning of features is completely different) while then it was height, sharp nose, photogenic face etc and Kanchana had everything in her but she was not ready for cinema then. Sometimes the statue waits for the creator to find it and that’s exactly what happened in her case. Creator Genius C.V.Sridhar found this charming airhostess and offered her a role in his comic film “Kadhalikka neramillai “ in 1964. Thus she landed ground into the tinsel world. People might think Kanchana’s debut was Kadhalikka neramillai but that’s not true. She appeared as Devi Kaali or durga in a telugu film which was released before. She started her innings with a great movie directed by the great Sridhar. Along with her there were other new comers too , charming ravichandran, bubbly Rajasree . I wrote at length in kothai notes about the moving completing 50 yrs. The movie opens up with Kanchana & Muthuraman singing the evergreen duet “Enna Paarvai undhan paarvai “ . Movie became a huge hit and all the new comers became stars overnight. First film for her was just a casual rich girl who is in love and she did justice to what was given to her. Slowly many films came her way in tamil & telugu. She started to pair with top heroes at that time mostly in telugu first (with ANR in Aathma gowravam, PReminchi choodu(kadhalikka neramillai in telugu) etc) , but it was the role of Uthara she played in Veera abhimanyu that got noticed by many. She was natural as uthara both in acting and dance sequences and charmed her way in the screen with AVMrajan in tamil, Shoban babu in Telugu. (how can we forget Paarthen sirithen pakkam vara thudithen song) Next she acted as the elder daughter of NAdigar thilagam in Motor sundaram pillai. That’s the first in Shivaji film probably stepping stone for her to act as his pair in the coming days. Though it was a small role still it was noticeable. She paired with Sivakumar in this movie. But when the same movie was made in Telugu she was offered Manimala’s role & she did it finely.She voiced for the evergreen telugu song MAnase andala brundavanam (maname muruganin mayilvaganam in telugu) sung by P.Susheela. Kanchana was fluent in Tamil and Telugu. During this time she started in Malayalam films as well. Next to KRVijaya Kanchana was the other heroine who did movies in all the 4 languages (Tamil, Telugu,Kananda & Malayalam) and few hindi movies too. She also had a chance to act with MAkkal thilagam in Parakkum Paavai where she portrayed once sided love. She continued glamour roles in movies like Marakka mudiyuma etc. She also played as a bold and caring sister in Kodi Malar. Kodi malar gave her additional scope to better as an actress. The movie deals with a dumb woman and kanchana her sister join hands with her lover to bring justice to her sister. Definitely improvement from being a glamour girl to a performer. That too equation with veteran actresss M.V.Rajamma 1967 is a special year for Kanchana. Yes there were many super hit movies this year. The main film was AVM’s thriller Adhey Kangal/Avey Kallu. Adhe kangal – Kanchana had Glamour role and paired up with Ravichandran/Krishna but this film gave her scope to prove a variety of dances including folk, western and many more (whatever was famous then like rock & roll, twist etc). Oh oh Ethanai azhagu 20 vayathinile shot in Mysore brindavan gardens is a visual treat to watch even now. Adhey kangal was a top grosser and KAnchana became a sought after heroine. 1967 also saw her feature in K.BAlachander’s comic family drama “Bhama Vijayam”. She was one of the 3 daughter-in-laws who ruin their lives due to their interest in their actress neighbor Bhama. Amidst a big star cast Kanchana was noticeable with her glasses and the scene where in she considers the thief to be her husband the conversation which follows is hilarious. She also put up quite a show in the song “Ninaithal sirippu varum “ During the same year she also entered Hindi films with the movie FArz. It was in 1967 she also paired up with legendary N.T.R as well and of course in 1967 she got the elevation of one sided lover for Nadigar thilagam in Thangai. So 1967 was definitely a better year for Kanchana. She was constantly doing films in tamil & telugu During this time she also acted in notable Malayalam films like Priyathama, Azhagulla saleena, Kodungallooramma,Thirichadi & many more She also acted with Makkal thilagam in Parakkum paavai & NAan yen pirandhen. 2 movies with makkal thilagam but prominent roles.(thanks vijayakrishnan for pointing out the miss) 1969 is another noticeable year in Kanchana’s career. The main film of Kanchana in 1969 was “shanti nilayam” where in she elevated from heroine to artist. Yes this is her best character portrayed in tamil film. She was attractive with Gemini, compassionate with both the kids and Pandari bhai and showed every kind of emotion in this movie. Shanti nilayam was inspired from Sound of music. Originally kannada folks got inspired from Sound of music and made Bedi bandhavalu in 1968 with Kalyan kumar & Chandrakala in lead. Tamil version was a year later. KAnchana was absolutely brilliant as Malathi in Shanti nilayam. Her acting, Marcus bartley’s photography and MSV’s scintillating music made this movie a grand success. Yet another notable film in 1969 was the telugu film Natakala Rayudu where in veteran actor NAgabushanam played the lead role and Kanchana played the female lead. This film was based on the hindi movie Albela . Kanchana plays the drama company owner who identifies Nagabushanam’s talent and makes him an actor. The movie was appreciated well and Kanchana’s role was also noticeable. When Thulabaram was made in tamil she got Sheela’s role- friend of the female lead sharada. Kanchana did justice to whatever the character asked for. She paired up with muthuraman 1970 marked the year when her mentor Sridhar paired her with NAdigar thilagam in the magnum opus “Sivandha mann” . Excellent songs and her “pattathu rani “ dance number is remembered even now. Kanchana was brilliant as Chitralekha. This was the first movie to shoot outside india. Inspite of the film’s failure it’s remembered for NAdigar thilagam’s acting, foreign locations and Kanchana’s pattathu rani dance as well. 1971 saw 2 brilliant characters from KAnchana. One was the telugu movie Kalyana mandapam. I would rate this as her career best. When Puttanna kanagal’s Gejje pooje was remade in telugu as Kalyana mandapam KAnchana was selected to play the role originally played brilliantly by minugu thare kalpana. Kanchana portrayed the role of a devdasi girl and she matched kalpana’s performance and got many accolades as well. In the same year she played a soft wife who cares for her friend and at the same time need to take care of family’s name in Avalukkenru oru manam. Kanchana played female lead Bharathi’s friend . Even though bharathi’s role is the powerful one Kanchana scored with softer role as well , playing Gemini’s wife , at the same time a very caring friend who tries hard to bring her friend to right track. Mangayaril maharani picturised on Kanchana & Gemini is even memorable now. 1971 also had the comic entertainer “Utharavindri Ulle va” directed by N.C.chakravarthy. Kanchana played the girl who escapes from villain group and seeks shelter at a bachelor’s house where in all the bachelors fall for her.. nice comedy movie and kanchana played her role well in the movie From then on she was seen doing second heroine role or character role mostly In telugu. Her dance sequences in Nageswararao’s bhakta tukaram are mind blowing but the career of the heroine suddenly vanished and she was reduced to do character roles. Times were changing and slowly she faded away. She was seen again with Nadigar thilagam in Avan oru sarithiram (Vanakkam pala murai sonnen)but not as his pair. She did elderly characters (mother roles) in sigappu rojakkal,pagadai pannirendu, babruvahana in kannada (she had a powerful role than sarojadevi in this movie) and many more and she slowly quit acting. During that time she also dealt with personal issues she went and settled with her sister in Bangalore. Unlike Kumudham reported she wasn’t living in any temple or any such sort. She was living with her sister and turned her life into spiritual world. After years of fight she got back all her assets and donated 5crore worth property to Thirupathi Devasthanam, a generous act indeed. Am happy that she is actively seen at many events in Chennai. I was surprised when actor ARS during UAA 60 years ,mentioned that Kanchana has acted in stage plays as well. Kanchana was awarded MGR award by the govt of tamilnadu in 2005. In a career span of 10 years she saw the peak for atleast 5-6 years did variety of roles and still her name is remembered by film lovers. That is Kanchana for us. I pray the almighty for her long and healthy life. Thanks @chitralaya sriram anna for asking me to write about this charming beauty. -Rajesh Lavanya\n\nVersatile Murthy aka Venniradai Murthy.\n\nVersatile Murthy aka Venniradai Murthy. Another request from @Chitralaya sriram anna . This time he deserves a kiss in his forehead for this request. I’m excited to write about my favorite artist Mr. Venniradai Murthy. Ironically he is known for his body language, thambriiii and body antics but there is a great man of wisdom behind that comic mask. Murthy born in 1936 in Chidambaram, his father was a leading lawyer and Murthy also completed law. While studying in Chennai Christian college Murthy also stayed in the same Vedanthangal(yes house of film birds) yes the famous club house in T.Nagar. Thus Murthy was destined to meet all the guys who were struggling to make it big in cinema. He met N.C.Chakravarthy (director of U.U.Vaa) because of whom he got the opportunity to meet Director Sridhar. It was in 1965 when Sridhar was getting ready for his new movie. Murthy was confident that he could do comedy roles but Sridhar wasn’t. He did ask Murthy why he wanted to do comedy roles as his face wasn’t funny. Murthy in turn said people say look yields luck but in my case it’s the other way . This statement made Sridhar to think and he decided to create a comic role for him and thus Murthy landed into cinema. In his debut he paired up with Asha/Shailasree. Murthy’s wide eyes and his witty speech will make everyone notable and why not he definitely got noticed and slowly he started to appear in many movies. My first knowledge of him came from the AVM’s comical ride KAsethan kadavulada .. Like every other beginning actor he was offered some elderly roles during his young age but in cinema logic this cannot be avoided but Murthy had the knack of making him noticeable in any character he did. In Kasethan kadavulada he acted as Manorama’s husband and the way he begs for 5 paise to his sons and they way he says “ She has employed me as her husband” all are funny to the core. Even now when I watch the scene between muthuraman, srikanth and Murthy it’s hilarious. Murthy’s nature, knowledge and timing made him gel with all the comedy stalwarts across decades. He has acted with almost all directors, all actors , all major comedians and variety of characters.. Can’t forget Utharavindri ulle vaa , then mazhai (as Gemini’s asst). He floated with time, created a unique identity for himself thus created the unique way of saying the words and funny facial expression. Thambriii , bbaa funny sounds all became his trademark. There are hundreds of movies where we all have laughed at his performance and it will be never ending story if I start to mention all of them but to quote a few Murthy and Kamal in Michael madana kamarajan where in he played a protective father of Kushboo and the scenes followed are hilarious to the core. My childhood friend (even now) Viswanathan and I were mad fan of Murthy and his dialoiuges and we literally ROTFL for his scenes in M.M.K.Rajan. Same can be said of his role in Thangamana purushan wherein he played husband to Aachi manorma (stingy woman) and it’s hilarious to watch him wear a dress made of paper .. funny to the core. He was able to team up with any comedian at any time and still managed to be noticeable. That was his hidden talent. He has acted with NAgesh, Thengai Srinivasan, Cho,Suruli, VKRamasamy, Goundamani,senthil (who can forget the funny scene between Senthil & Murthy in enga ooru paatukkaran), S.S.chandran, Vadivelu, Vivek, manobala and even with young generation comic actors. He acted with everyone with ease. He acted with T.R.Ramachandran, M.R.Radha and many stalwarts. Behind this comedian was an actor too. There were few movies where he was given subtle acting roles as well. Because of his good writing skills he also worked in Chitralaya magazine as well. He has worked over 900 films and still very active which is a great achievement. Apart from films many know him as astrologer as well. Yes he was once predicted by an astrologer that he will make it into films and his words came true and Murthy started picking up astrology books from that astrologer. He claims that his guru is that person because he strictly said to Murthy that he would not teach him but guide him. Murthy says it’s science and he did master it well. He was the first to conduct a TV show named “Astrology and Vaasthu” Apart from films he was successful in TV as well. His comedy series Meendum meendum Sirippu was successful for 11 years. A huge accomplishment. Apart from movies & TV shows Murthy is very well informed . His recent show “Ulagam ivvalavuthan” is a show with tons of information and the way Murthy presents is commendable. I’m lucky to have likeminded friends and above all my DAD who all liked Murthy. Dad & I are huge Murthy fans and never miss his comedy scene or any of his show for that matter. Murthy is very cordial and disciplined. All of his co actors had immense praise for this man. Vadivukkarasi, Kovai sarala and many more always mention Murthy’s name. He is a gentleman to the core, cordial to the drivers who drop him or pick him up for shooting thus yielding a good name and going strong even now. Murthy married veteran actress MAnimala (what a natural beauty she was)at the peak of her career. She quit acting after marriage and still she is the backbone for Mr.Murthy. She came back to do Sindhu bhairavi and the tele series which followed the movie just because of KB. Murthy and MAnimala have a son Mano who is married and they have a grandson. Mano is settled in Australia or America (not sure). Murthy is simple man and often his dialogues tend to have double meaning but that is part and parcel of cinema.. The man within is clean as a crystal and everyone knows it and I take great pleasure in writing about this Man who made millions laugh …. See you soon with another artist. Bye for now Rajesh Lavanya\n\nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star(s).\n\nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star(s). ======================= There were quite number of little stars who impressed the audience with their stellar performances over the years and this article is just to highlight the major cuties who did leave a mark. 1.Daisy Irani *********************** The very first child star who impressed me was Daisy Irani in \"Yaar Payyan\" .. Can we forger the famous dialouge \"Maahanam Porunthiya Sreemaan Sundarrajan\". Irani just stole the show in a film which had stalwarts like NSK,MAdhuram,Gemini & Savithiri. Sisters Daisy irani & honey irani were quite popular but Daisy made quite an impression in Tamil films as well.\n\n2. Kutty padmini Following Daisy Irani it was Kutty padmini who stole the film arena with her bubbly performances in many movies. She always played heroine's young age role. her first noteable appearance was in Sridhar's Nenjil or aalyam(Muthana muthallavo song with dEvika) but she is still remembered for the dual role she played in Kuzhandhaiyum deivamum. She played so naturally the Lalli & pappi. Definitely Kutti padmini left a mark as child artist but couldnt make it big as an actress\n\n3. Kumari Sachu ================ Kumari chachu also played younger roles in Avvaiyar , Rani, Mayabazar(young vatsala) and many more movies. ACT casted her as heroine in Veera thirumagan and Annai and then CVSridhar showed her another path in comedy in Kadhalikka neramillai. sachu was cute and bubbly and played baby roles and lil sister roles in many movies (noticeable one was Edhirparadhadhu where in she will appear as the tribal girl taking care of Sivaji )\n\n4. Master PRabhakar & Baby sumathi. =============================== Master prabhakar is definitely the more popular child artist among everyone. He acted in numerous movies and always performed to perfection sometime it makes the audience think that he overdoes everything for his age. Those were the days where in child artists spoke more for their age. Prabhakar was on par with Kutty padmini for apprearing in many movies. APNagarajan made exclusively a film for Prabhakar \"Vaa Raja Vaa\". Prabhakar is a known child artist among tamil audicene even now. His sister Baby sumathi also starred in many movies with almost every top actor/actresses. All the above mentioned child stars acted in Tamil, Telugu, malayalam and kannada movies too. Sumathi is married and settled in canada.\n\n5. Master Sekar. ####################### Like Prabhakar another child artist who with his innocent face made a mark was MAster Sekar. He was given roles exactly opposite to that of Prabhakar's . Always soft spoken quiet boy role. He also flourished as teen boy in quite number of movies (Sivaji's asst in Vani rani etc) and Sridhar made a movie with him and kavitha \"Oh manju\". Years later he also acted as Sivakumar's son in the award winning MArupakkam\n\n6.Baby Shakeela =================== Can we forget \"Athai madi methayadi\" the melodious lullaby which marked Vaali ayya's star arrival beautifully rendered by Susheelamma. The baby artist who is attached to the aunt KRVijaya was baby shakeela. Shakeela appeared in several movies like enga pappa, enga veetu pillai and many more and definitely made an impression with her mazhalai speech dailouges.. As a teenager she appeared alongside AArthi in Gumasthavin magal but couldnt make it big.\n\n7. Master Kamal hassan KAmal also had his share as child artist appearing in many movies alongside the then super stars MGR,Sivaji & Gemini in several movies. KAlathur kannama still is considered a landmark film for the introduction of Kamal as the child artist. Acting was written all over him and it wasnt a surprise he made it big as Ulaga nayagan.\n\n8. Baby Sridevi. =============== Sree devi who ruled the Hindi, telugu and occasionally Tamil was also a baby star and appeared in many films in all languages. Especially tamil, telugu, malayalam. Can we forget the baby in Babu fondly calling Nadigar thilagam as \"rickshaw mama\" . She went on to become a popular actress in hindi and telugu but did leave a mark as a child artist.\n\n9. Master Sridhar ================== Can we foget the cute little boy who played Lord muruga arguing with Avvaiyar(KBS) on Sutta pazham venduma in KAndhan Karunai. Sridhar played child roles in many movies and then elevated to side roles (in few movies played naradhar, teenage boy etc) and ended up in major roles in Doordarshan. It's sad to note that he passed away years back\n\n10. Baby Rani. *********************** once baby shakeela, kutty padmini were out of the scene during 70's Baby rani made an impact. Kanne pappa, kuzhandhaikkaga all were made with her in a prominent role..She also acted in all languages including hindi. Her whereabouts are not known.\n\n11. Baby Indira =============== Sisters Baby indira & raasi also had their stint as baby artists Indira the elder sister played the kid role in many movies. can we forget Singer pushpalatha singing \"amamvum appavum vellai poonaigal \" . Indira did play quite number of kannada movies. She reprised Kutty padmini's role in Kannada remake of Kuzhandhaiyum deivamum.\n\n12. Roja ramani ====================== No one can ever forger \"Narayana mandram adhuve narayana bajanam\" . yes Baby Roja ramani who was casted by AVM chettiar in Bhakta prahalada was very popular child artist in Tamil and telugu. \"Oru maharaja oru maharani\" in Iru malargal is another beautiful role played by Roja ramani. She also was quite popular as teenager doing heroine and sister roles and then switched her profession as dubbing artist. All the above child stars made a mark hence they are mentioned specifically. There were other child artists like the boy who played dumb in \"RAmu\" and few other kids who acted only in few movies and disappeared. This is a humble attempt to recollect all those Little stars who twinkled in the Silver screen(sky). Will be back with another article soon (Rajeshkumar Lavanya)"
