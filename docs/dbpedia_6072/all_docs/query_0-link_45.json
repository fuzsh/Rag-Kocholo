        "text": "Samarla Venkata Ranga Rao (Telugu: సామర్ల వెంకట రంగారావు) (3 July 1918 – 18 July 1974) Popularly Known as S.V.R. was an Indian Theater actor, Tollywood actor, director and producer. He was popularly known as “Vishwa Nata Chakravarthi.” He was Iconic and legendary in his acting skills portraying the Roles of Ravanasura, Gatothkacha and Keechaka from Indian Mythology. He is still considered as a leader for a person aspiring to be an actor. He serves as a role model for upcoming Tollywood, Theater and Indian actors.\n\nEarly Life\n\nRao was born to Lakshmi and Koteshwara Rao, an excise inspector at Nuzvidu town in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, India when World War I was drawing to a close. His mother, Lakshmi Narasayamma, a staunch devotee of Lord Venkateshwara, named the boy after him.\n\nThe possessive father sent S.V.R. to the erstwhile Madras Presidency where he completed his schooling at Hindu College. At an early age of 12, the boy showed immense interest in stage action. while doing his B.Sc, but the mind of youthful S.V.R. was always preoccupied with the thoughts of stage-plays and film acting. Soon after graduation, S.V.R. could get a job in the Fire Service in the cadre of an officer at Machilipatnam (Bandar). Two objectives were still clear in his mind, which were to do M.Sc. and to take active part in dramas and films. He won the Best Actor Award for his portrayal of Keechaka in Nartanasala at the Indonesian Film Festival at Jakarta in 1963. It was the first time an Indian actor received an international award in acting. In Indian history he can be considered as the king of acting.\n\nFilm Career\n\nS.V.R. got an invitation from one of his relatives, B.V. Ramanandam, to play the hero in his film “Varoodhini”. He immediately abandoned the job, and left for Salem to join the celluloid world. In fact, it’s a great beginning for the young man. The film “Varoodhini” was released, and in a few days people began to forget that they had ever seen such a movie.

In the days that followed, S.V.R. was given an opportunity to play the villain in the film, “Palletoori Pilla”, produced by B. A. Subba Rao. Unfortunately, when S.V.R. was about to take a train to Chennai, his father expired. After performing the final rites, S.V.R. reached Chennai, but somebody had knocked away the villain role.\n\nOpportunity tapped at S.V.R.’s door through Vijaya Pictures, which offered him the most memorable “Nepala Mantrikudu” role in “Pathala Bhairavi.” Immediately, he came into the limelight, followed by “Pelli Chesi Choodu” (1952). Its Tamil version was also played by him.\n\nMaya Bazaar and Nartanasala are among his movies. SVR was the first Indian to get an international award in Djakarta International Film Festival for his role of Keechaka in Nartanasala.\n\nHis compatriot Gummadi Venkateswara Rao once exclaimed “Fortunate are we to have SVR born in India but SVR is unfortunate to have born here… if he was born in the West he would have been one of the top 5 actors of all time in the world”.\n\nHe had Heart attack in Hyderabad in February 1974.
