However, the success percentage in the 365-day duration has been way too disappointing and filmmakers are firm on delivering the goods in the New Year. The celebrations are expected to get bigger this Sankranthi with the mighty face-off between Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo and Sarileru Neekevvaru. The release date of these big-ticket films has already become a topic of discussion among cine folks.\n\nMeanwhile, an exciting 2020 awaits Telugu cinema as a series of big-ticket films starring leading actors like Prabhas, Mahesh Babu, NTR, Ram Charan, Anushka Shetty, Naga Chaitanya are set to hit the marquee. While there are also a bunch of new-age films to look forward too, let’s look at the Telugu films to watch out for in 2020.\n\nThe shooting of Mahesh Babu’s upcoming actioner Sarileru Neekevvaru has been recently wrapped up and the pre-release event is scheduled to take place on January 5th at the LB Stadium in Hyderabad. Chiranjeevi will be gracing the stage as the chief guest. Starring Rashmika Mandanna as the leading lady, the Anil Ravipudi directorial features an ensemble star cast like Prakash Raj, Vijayashanthi, Sangeetha and Rajendra Prasad in pivotal roles. The Devi Sri Prasad musical is slated for a release on January 11, 2020.\n\nAfter raising the intensity with the first look posters and a riveting teaser, Madhavan and Anushka Shetty’s forthcoming film Nishabdham is all set for a massive release on January 31 in multiple Indian languages. Besides the lead pair, the Hemant Madhukar directorial features an ensemble star cast like Michael Madsen, Anjali, Shalini Pandey, Subbaraju and Srinivasa Avasarala in pivotal roles. Touted to be a suspense-thriller, the big-budget film has been mostly shot in Seattle and the post-production formalities are currently underway.\n\nA month ago, the team of RRR took to their official social handle and revealed that almost 70% shoot of the action period-drama has been wrapped up. Directed by SS Rajamouli, the period actioner starring Ram Charan and Junior NTR in lead roles is scheduled for a massive release on July 30. While Bollywood bombshell Alia Bhatt will be romancing Ram Charan in this mega multi-starrer, English actress Olivia Morris will play Jennifer, the ladylove of Junior NTR. Irish actors Alison Doody and Ray Stevenson will be seen as the main antagonists. Set against the pre-independence era, RRR is a fictitious story based on two legendary freedom fighters, Alluri Seetharamaraju and Komaram Bheem.\n\nIt’s already evident that the shooting of 96 Telugu remake has been wrapped up a month ago. Helmed by Prem Kumar who directed the original version, the film was extensively shot at Hyderabad, Vizag, Maldives and Kenya. Featuring Sharwanand and Samantha Akkineni in the shoes of Vijay Sethupathi and Trisha Krishnan, the release date of the film was unveiled on social media. According to a popular trade analyst, 96 will be releasing on Valentine’s Day 2020. Popular producer Dil Raju is bankrolling the project.\n\nFrom the past week or so, Nithiin and Rashmika Mandanna are busy romancing in the exotic locales of Italy for their upcoming film Bheeshma. Directed by Venky Kudumula of Chalo fame, the romantic-comedy is in the final leg of shoot and the songs are currently being shot on the lead pair. While the music of Bheeshma is composed by Sagar Mahati, the cinematography is handled by Sai Sriram and editing by Navin Nooli. The mini teaser of the film released to good response from netizens.\n\nIt’s already evident that sensible filmmaker Indraganti Mohan Krishna is helming a multi-starrer project starring Natural Star Nani and Sudheer Babu in lead roles. Touted to be a neo-noir thriller, the film is titled as V and the shooting is proceeding at a rapid pace. Starring Aditi Rao Hydari and Nivetha Thomas as the leading ladies, V marks the third collaboration between Nani and Indraganti after Ashta Chamma and Gentleman. The neo-noir thriller will reportedly portray Sudheer Babu as a cop and Nani in a challenging role with negative shades. It is scheduled for a release on March 25.\n\nFor the first time, Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi have teamed up together for a light-hearted entertainer directed by versatile filmmaker Sekhar Kammula. The shooting of the film is proceeding at a rapid pace and recently, on Chaitanya’s birthday, the makers have unveiled a glimpse of his character. Though the short clip didn’t give away much, it had a few hallmarks of a typical Sekhar Kammula hero – a relatable man-next-door in a middle-class setting. According to reports, the film is tentatively titled as Love Story.\n\nAt present, Ram Pothineni actor is busy shooting for Red, the Telugu remake of Kollywood blockbuster Thadam. Touted to be a crime-thriller, the film will portray the 31-year-old actor in dual roles that are constantly at loggerheads with each other. There are quite a few high-octane action sequences in the investigative drama and national award-winning stunt choreographer Peter Hein has been roped in to handle the action part. Starring Nivetha Pethuraj as the leading lady, the film is directed by Kishore Tirumala and bankrolled by Sravanthi Ravi Kishore.\n\nIt’s already confirmed that Victory Venkatesh is stepping into the shoes of Dhanush for the Telugu remake of Asuran. While the leading lady is yet to be finalised, ‘Kotha Bangaru Lokam’ fame Srikanth Addala has been confirmed as the director. At the promotions of Venky Mama, one can notice the rugged look of the 58-year-old actor and he seems to be prepping up for the role. The untitled project will be jointly bankrolled by original producer Kalaipuli S Thanu and Suresh Babu under Suresh Productions and V Creations Banner."
