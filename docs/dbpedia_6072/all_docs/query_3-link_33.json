The chance to witness postponed titles finally grace the big screen was met with palpable excitement. Nevertheless, the aftermath of the global lockdowns was evident, as fewer patrons ventured into theaters despite a roster of promising films. Notably, franchise films, particularly those from the superhero genre, secured the lion's share of box office success. Outliers such as Wes Anderson's \"The French Dispatch\" and Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Licorice Pizza\" also had laudable performances, demonstrating the potential of non-franchise films in the theatrical market.\n\nStreaming: A Revolution Already in Motion\n\nPreceding the pandemic, a shift towards streaming was already set in motion. With the lockdown, this transition was expedited. Streaming releases were readily available to subscribers, effectively making an array of movies more accessible than ever. While this development carries a promise of cinematic diversity, it is not without its challenges. Online releases typically garner less media attention, leaving many great films unnoticed by the majority of potential viewers. An Overview of the Highest-Grossing Films of 2021 The battle for the highest-grossing film of 2021 saw \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" by Sony Pictures take the top spot, grossing over $1.9 billion worldwide. Following closely were films like \"The Battle at Lake Changjin,\" \"Hi, Mom,\" \"No Time to Die,\" and \"F9\". Interestingly, despite the praise and accolades garnered by several critically acclaimed films, the box office charts largely remained unaltered, with the top positions largely occupied by franchise films.\n\nCrunching the Box Office Numbers\n\nNow let's delve deeper into the realm of figures and facts. The worldwide box office in 2021 tallied up to $21.4 billion, a staggering 78% increase from 2020. China stood out as the highest-grossing nation, amassing an impressive $7.3 billion. On the other hand, theaters in the United States and Canada doubled their earnings from 2020 to an estimated $4.55 billion, yet this figure was still 60% lower than 2019. Several films broke records, contributing to a milestone year for the film industry. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) blazed past the $23 billion, $24 billion, and $25 billion marks in total gross. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' not only became the 48th film to gross $1 billion worldwide but also overtook its predecessor 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' as Sony's highest-grossing film. Foreign films also made their mark in the annals of cinematic history. 'The Battle at Lake Changjin' became the highest-grossing non-English and Chinese film, while 'Hi, Mom' shattered the record for the highest-grossing film by a solo female director, previously held by 'Wonder Woman.'\n\nRecord-Setting Moments in Film History\n\n2021 was a landmark year for several films and franchises. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) reached new milestones with the releases of \"Black Widow\", \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", \"Eternals\", and \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\", crossing the $23 billion, $24 billion, and $25 billion thresholds in total gross. \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" not only became the 48th film to cross $1 billion worldwide, but it also surpassed \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" as Sony's highest-grossing film. Interestingly, it holds the unique distinction of being the highest-grossing film not released in China.\n\nNotable Non-English Films of 2021\n\nAs mentioned, \"The Battle at Lake Changjin,\" a Chinese war epic, was a runaway success, becoming the highest-grossing non-English film of all time. Another Chinese film, \"Hi, Mom,\" became a massive hit, generating significant revenue and widespread popularity. These successes are indicative of the rapidly growing influence of Chinese cinema on the global stage.\n\n2021 Film Awards: Oscar Highlights for 2020 Movies\n\nThe Academy Awards saw a diverse selection of winners in 2021. \"Nomadland,\" directed by Chloe Zhao, took home the Best Picture award, while Zhao became the second woman and the first woman of color to win Best Director. Anthony Hopkins won Best Actor for \"The Father,\" while Frances McDormand received her third Best Actress Oscar for \"Nomadland.\" \"Promising Young Woman\" won Best Original Screenplay, with Emerald Fennell becoming the first woman to win this award in 13 years. Daniel Kaluuya won Best Supporting Actor for \"Judas and the Black Messiah,\" and Youn Yuh-jung received Best Supporting Actress for \"Minari.\"\n\nRepresentation and Inclusion\n\n2021 also marked progress in terms of representation and inclusion in the film industry. More films highlighted underrepresented groups and shared their stories, a trend that we hope will continue and expand in the coming years. For instance, Chloe Zhao's Oscar win for 'Nomadland' made her the first woman of color and the second woman overall to win the Oscar for Best Director.\n\nMajor Film Festivals\n\nFilm festivals continued to play a vital role in showcasing a variety of films, from independent cinema to major studio productions. The 2021 Sundance Film Festival, the 71st Berlin International Film Festival, and the 74th Locarno Film Festival, among others, brought together filmmakers and audiences, offering a platform for unique and compelling narratives.\n\nImpacts and Developments in the Film Industry\n\nThe 2021 film industry faced significant challenges, not only due to the pandemic but also the ensuing shift towards online streaming. The increasing prevalence of digital platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and HBO Max has impacted the industry in profound ways. The industry has had to adapt to simultaneous digital and theatrical releases, and grapple with the reduced box office returns these might entail. Yet, these shifts have also offered opportunities. With platforms vying for the attention of viewers, there has been an influx of original content and a wider array of storytelling, including stories from underrepresented communities. Beyond the shift in distribution channels, the technological advancements in film production have been staggering. The use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), virtual reality (VR), and other technological wonders has enhanced storytelling, making it more immersive and engaging. Notably, Disney's 'The Mandalorian' continued to impress audiences and industry experts alike with its groundbreaking use of Stagecraft technology, using LED walls for real-time rendering of CGI backgrounds. These technological feats have transformed the way films are made, paving the way for more complex and visually stunning narratives in the future."
