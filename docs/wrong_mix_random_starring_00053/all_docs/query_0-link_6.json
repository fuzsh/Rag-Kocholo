        "text": "Celebrities spend a lot of time on the red carpet, and public scrutinization of them can be grueling: Stars are supposed to look perfect, with flawless makeup, stunning gowns and suits, and finely coiffed hair. So it's no surprise that celebs feel the need to let loose now and again to ease the pressure. Check out some of the goofiest moments on the red carpet from 2001 to today.\n\n2001: Unintentional goofiness at the hands of Britney and Justin.\n\nThey might not have been purposefully goofy, but, well, these matching denim outfits would make anyone laugh. Still, the celebrity couple were just 19 at the time — they were bound to make some mistakes.\n\n2001: Bjork looks as elegant as a swan.\n\nThe singer-songwriter wore a swan-neck halter for the 73rd Academy Awards. She even brought six ostrich eggs to drop carefully in her tracks, but she ran into a problem. \"Other people's bodyguards kept picking them up and saying in their thick American accents, 'Scuse me, ma'am, you dropped this,'\" she told GQ.\n\n2006: Emma Watson revels in the spotlight.\n\nWith four Harry Potter movies under their belt, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were feeling pretty good.\n\n2009: Jamming at the traditionally somber Cannes Film Festival.\n\nWhen \"Misirlou” by Dick Dale & His Del-Tones — a.k.a. the Pulp Fiction theme song — played on the red carpet, Quentin Tarantino and Inglourious Basterds actor Melanie Laurent boogied down in the face of the dignified event.\n\n2012: The peekaboo leg that made meme history.\n\nAngelina Jolie popped her hip and took a wide stance to show off her dress slit at the Academy Awards — and the photo quickly became a Photoshop meme of epic proportions.\n\n2012: Adele doesn't know what to do with all her Grammy babies.\n\nAdele's arms were overloaded with her six trophies, and she gazed at them adoringly. By 2017, when she won another armload, she had figured out a better strategy to carry them all.\n\n2012: Sacha Baron Cohen spills ashes over an alarmed Ryan Seacrest.\n\nThe Borat star showed up to the Academy Awards as his character in The Dictator, and when he spilled ashes all over Ryan Seacrest, the TV personality did not seem amused.\n\n2013: Poor Jennifer Lawrence takes a fall in front of everyone.\n\nIt might have been the first time, but it certainly wasn't the last. The actress is aggrieved by her worst nightmare: a fall on the Academy Award stage in front of the most renowned celebrities. She would fall on the red carpet again four years later.\n\n2013: Robert Downey Jr. is feeling himself in lederhosen.\n\nThe actor wore traditional clothing to an event for Iron Man 3 in Munich, Germany, and apparently thought he was looking good.\n\n2014: A selfie to end all selfies.\n\nIt was the highlight of the Academy Awards that year: Ellen DeGeneres inspired a spontaneous celebrity selfie that no one will ever be able to outdo.\n\n2014: Benedict Cumberbatch photobombs the rockstars.\n\nThe English actor unleashed his inner fan as he jumped behind musicians the Edge, Bono, Larry Mullen Jr., and Adam Clayton of U2 at the Academy Awards.\n\n2014: An overzealous fan gives an uncomfortable crotch hug.\n\nUkrainian Vitalii Sediuk is a self-described prankster who often goes too far in his \"pranks\" to the point of harassment. Here he jumped the red rope at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to give Bradley Cooper a crotch hug.\n\n2014: Leslie Mann gives Cameron Diaz's glute a squeeze.\n\nThe two women were touring around to promote their movie The Other Woman and apparently had become very close during filming.\n\n2014: A planned kiss between two married celebs.\n\nActor Julia Louis-Dreyfus won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Veep and kissed actor Bryan Cranston onstage at the Emmy Awards. The actors are each married to separate people but planned the kiss as a stunt (with their significant others' permission).\n\n2015: Taylor Swift believes no occasion is too grand for bunny ears.\n\nWhen you've been best friends for as long as Abigail Anderson and Taylor Swift have, bunny ears at the Grammy Awards are par for the course.\n\n2015: Amy Schumer throws herself at Kanye and Kim's feet.\n\nThe comedian pretended to trip and fall at the feet of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at the Time 100 Gala, much to the amusement of everyone except for the honored couple in question.\n\n2015: Zendaya and Demi take advantage of a glittery background.\n\nThe two actor-singers were loving that bedazzled backdrop. They took a series of funny photos at the 2nd annual unite4:humanity event in L.A.\n\n2015: \"Games of Thrones\" cast lighten up on the red carpet.\n\nHannah Murray, Jacob Anderson, and Nathalie Emmanuel show just how unlike their onscreen characters they are at the after-party of the Game Of Thrones: Season 5 UK premiere.\n\n2015: Emmy Rossum gives her best puppy impersonation.\n\nThe actor fell in love with her cute red-carpet escort at the All-Star Dog Rescue Celebration.\n\n2015: \"Jane the Virgin\" cast takes an awkward family photo.\n\nThe cast has often shown just how close they are in Instagram photos. Here they are taking a family selfie on the red carpet.\n\n2015: Jared Leto didn't get the \"smize\" memo.\n\nThe actor is known for refusing to adhere to the typical celebrity pose on the red carpet. Or maybe being next to two beauties like Nina Dobrev and Hailee Steinfeld made his face go a little wonky.\n\n2016: Kate Moss seductively bites her clutch.\n\nThe supermodel felt playful at the Loving premiere during the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n2016: The Force has touched this father-son duo.\n\nActor Terry Crews and his son Isaiah float like Yoda at the premiere of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\n\n2016: Julianne Hough with her girl squad.\n\nJulianne Hough is known for being a ball of energy who loves to laugh. The triple threat leans on Kether Donohue, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Vanessa Hudgens at a Grease: Live event.\n\n2016: When two comedians marry each other, life is a party.\n\nChris Pratt and ex-wife Anna Faris may be divorced now, but they sure seemed to have a lot of fun while their marriage lasted, as they did at this premiere of Passengers.\n\n2016: Justin Timberlake is a troll.\n\nThe actor-singer grooves at the Trolls movie premiere in Sydney with characters Branch and Poppy.\n\n2017: Jason Momoa's tongue steals the shot.\n\nJason Momoa appears pretty jolly in most photos, and he even seems to be affecting Ben Affleck's disposition at the premiere of Justice League.\n\n2017: Janelle Monae feels like a princess.\n\nThe actor-singer wore a big poofy dress and a tiara-like headband at the Academy Awards and gave her best princess pose.\n\n2017: Clooney gets on his fans' freakout level.\n\nIf you can't beat ’em, join ’em. George Clooney pretends to scream with his adoring fans.\n\n2017: Tiffany Haddish is ready for another \"Girls Trip.\"\n\nMaybe she was in character at the film's premiere, or maybe she was just being Tiffany.\n\n2017: Lizzo knows how to capture the audience's attention.\n\nThe musician, singer and bona fide stage performer knows exactly what to do to get the crowd riled up.\n\n2017: In case you thought you couldn't karate kick in a gown …\n\nStuntwoman Jessie Graff was there to set you straight at the 2017 Emmys. Red-carpet karate kicks seem to be her speciality — she performed one at the 2016 Emmys as well.\n\n2017: Brothers will be brothers.\n\nAlexander Skarsgard wanted to make sure his brother Bill Skarsgard wasn't too serious at the premiere of It.\n\n2017: Joey Kind cannot believe Baddiewinkle's outfit\n\nInternet sensation Baddiewinkle dressed in a rainbow leotard one-piece for the NYC premiere of Going in Style, and Joey King was there for it.\n\n2018: Jack Black pulls a warlock move on the red carpet.\n\nJack Black probably wishes he could be a warlock full-time, which is evident by his behavior on the red carpet at the premiere of The House With a Clock in Its Walls.\n\n2018: Kelly Clarkson almost falls over when she sees Madame Streep.\n\n\"Can I meet you? I am such a fan!\" Kelly Clarkson hollered at Meryl Streep after almost tripping down the stairs when she saw her at the Golden Globes.\n\n2019: Emilia Clarke ardently admires Emma Thompson's brave hair choices.\n\nActor Emma Thompson wore sparkly purple stars in her hair to the UK premiere of Last Christmas, and Emilia Clarke thought it was all that. Maybe it reminded her of the time she wore a purple tulle dress to the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n2019: Taylor and Idris Elba get catty on the red carpet.\n\nThe two starred in the movie version of Cats together, and it seems they miss their feline selves now that filming is over.\n\n2019: Satin and latex couture for the Met Gala.\n\nForever duo Lena Dunham and Jemima Kirke were 100 percent onboard for the Met Gala's campy theme, wearing complementary outfits and posing together for extra oomph.\n\n2019: The little women freak over seeing their onscreen mom\n\nTo be fair, this is most people's reaction to seeing the iconic Laura Dern in person. Based on this photo, it seems that the costars really bonded on-set.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
