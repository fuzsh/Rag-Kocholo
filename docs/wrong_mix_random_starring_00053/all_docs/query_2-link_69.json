The Chinese character ‘Tu’ (rabbit) is part of ‘Yi’ (escape or leisure) indicating speed and distance. The Han people have a custom that a pregnant woman is not allowed to eat bunny for fear that the child will be born with a harelip.

In some places, people believe that a snake found in their court can bring delight. During Spring Festival, people like to paste onto their doors and windows the paper-cut ‘Fu’ character (happiness), combined with a snake twisting around a rabbit onto their doors and windows as a popular pattern indicating wealth.\n\nStrengths\n\nThey often have a good temper and a skill at communicating but say little.
