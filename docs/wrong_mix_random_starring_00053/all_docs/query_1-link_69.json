        "text": "I enjoyed watching The Last of Us and was quite taken with the sexy lead character Joel who survived some horrific times. Not long after, Pedro Pascal, who played Joel so successfully, was the talk of Hollywood. He appeared at events and talk shows and was quite charming, but looked rather ordinary, and NOTHING like his rough and tumble character Joel. In fact, we would never have recognized him as Joel! I can’t help but wonder WHAT the series stylists DID to make Pedro SO appealing to look at! If I were Pedro, I would find out EXACTLY what they did and learn how to do it myself… Looking like Joel is not a bad thing!\n\nTop Photo: The Last of Us\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nAbout The Author"
