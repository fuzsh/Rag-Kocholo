        "text": "In June 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen walked into Orlando's gay nightclub Pulse, and shot and killed 49 people. 53 others were wounded. It was the deadliest mass shooting in American history.\n\nMateen was born in New York to Afghan parents and had been on the FBI's radar a couple of times, once for inflammatory comments then again regarding a possible connection to an American suicide bomber in Syria. Both cases were closed.\n\nThe world mourns\n\nFollowing the shooting the world showed support for Orlando and its victims, mass vigils taking place from Hong Kong to Paris. \"I am Orlando,\" said one message in Los Angeles. Speculation that Mateen himself had been gay could not be proven.\n\nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis\n\nThe battle for gay rights in America has been raging since the mid-twentieth century and is clearly nowhere near over.\n\nOn September 3, 2015, Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis was thrown in jail on a contempt of court charge for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples at the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead, Kentucky. She claims the Supreme Court ruling conflicts with her Christian faith.\n\nFive days later, U.S. District Judge David Bunning lifted the contempt order against Davis, saying he was satisfied that her deputies are fulfilling their obligation to grant licenses in her absence. Bunning warned, however, that there will be trouble if Davis tries to interfere with the issuance of those licenses in any way.\n\nKim Davis\n\nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis is set to be released September 8, 2015, just before she was to receive jailhouse visits from presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz.\n\nDavis stopped issuing all marriage licenses in June, the day after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Two gay couples and two straight couples sued her as a result.\n\nSupreme Court says \"I do\"\n\nOn June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it is unconstitutional for states to ban same-sex marriages. This decision marked a long fought victory for the LGBT community that included many milestones of disappointment and tragedy on the road to equal rights.\n\nKinsey Report\n\nIn 1948, Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey, an American biologist and sex researcher, published a book of his findings, called \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male.\" The \"Kinsey Report,\" as it came to be known, concluded that sexuality exists on a scale and that homosexual behavior is not limited to those who identify as homosexuals.\n\nRather, Kinsey's research found that 37 percent of all males enjoy homosexual relations at one point or another in their lives. These findings shocked the psychologists and psychiatrists of the time, who long considered homosexuality a sociopathic personality disorder.\n\nCold War Investigation\n\nAt the beginning of the Cold War, the U.S. government conducted a secret investigation into the sexual orientation of its employees.\n\nOn December 15, 1950, the findings of that investigation were then circulated to all members of Congress in the form of a Senate Report, entitled \"Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government.\"\n\nThe report stated that, \"those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons,\" and as such, \"constitute security risks\" to the nation. Accordingly, thousands of gay men and women were dismissed from their positions within the U.S. government and military over the next few years, in what would become known as \"the lavender scare.\"\n\nPresident Eisenhower\n\nOn April 27, 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law Executive Order 10450, which banned populations that pose security risks to the nation from working for the federal government or any of its private contractors.\n\nThe \"security risks\" listed in that executive order included neurotics, alcoholics and homosexuals.\n\nDaughters of Bilitis\n\nOn September 21, 1955, the Daughters of Bilitis formed in San Francisco, as America's first lesbian rights organization.\n\nIts purpose is to host social events and push for social change through education. Chapters quickly spring up in other cities across the country as well.\n\nThis photo shows 1960s newsletters from the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis.\n\nEvelyn Hooker\n\nOn August 30, 1956, Evelyn Hooker presents at the American Psychological Association Convention in Chicago.\n\nShe conducted Rorschach and other psychological tests and groups of both homosexual and heterosexual men, and concluded that they do not differ significantly enough to consider homosexuality a clinical entity.\n\nHer paper, \"The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual,\" is groundbreaking and helps to explode the notion that homosexuality is a mental illness.\n\nStonewall Riots\n\nEarly in the morning on June 28, 1969, police attempted to raid a Greenwich Village gay bar, called the Stonewall Inn.\n\nThe gay youth inside, however, were sick of police raiding their bars in attempt to rid local neighborhoods of \"sexual deviants.\" So, they fought back.\n\nThousands of protestors clashed with police officers in the streets outside Stonewall for three days. The riots are credited with reigniting the modern gay rights movement in America, and the Stonewall Inn was granted landmark status in June 2015.\n\nStonewall Riots\n\nOn June 28, 1970, the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, thousands of members of the LGBT community took to the streets of Manhattan and marched all the way to Central Park.\n\nThis \"Christopher Street Liberation Day\" is now considered America's first gay pride parade.\n\nUpStairs Lounge arson attack\n\nOn June 24, 1973, the Upstairs Lounge -- a gay bar on the second floor of a building in the French Quarter of New Orleans -- was intentionally set on fire, and 32 people perished inside.\n\nMost of the victims were found near the windows in the background, attempting to escape the blaze. This arson incident remains the deadliest attack on the LGBT community in United States history. And no one was ever charged with the crime.\n\nHere, the charred remains of the Upstairs Lounge are seen on June 25, 1973, the day after the attack.\n\nOne, Inc. v. Olesen\n\nIn January 1958, the Supreme Court took up the historic case, One, Inc. v. Olesen; a suit, which was filed after the U.S. Postal Service and the FBI declared the contents of \"One: The Homosexual Magazine,\" obscene.\n\nCiting the First Amendment, it was the first time the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of gay rights.\n\nHarvey Milk\n\nIn January 1974, Kathy Kozachenko is elected to the Ann Arbor, Michigan City Council, becoming the first openly gay American ever elected to public office.\n\nThen, on November 8, 1977, Harvey Milk, seen here, wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. Before his assassination in 1978, Milk used his political position to fight discrimination against members of the LGBT community in the workplace.\n\nMarch on Washington - 1987\n\nOn October 11, 1987, after six years of federal inaction with regards to the rapidly worsening AIDS crisis, 50,000 gay rights activists marched on Washington to demand that President Reagan address the epidemic.\n\nIn this photo, terminally ill AIDS victims are pushed in wheelchairs as they participate in the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.\n\nUnderstanding Aids brochure\n\nIn May 1988, the federal government finally addresses the AIDS crisis by mailing a CDC brochure, entitled \"Understanding AIDS,\" to every household in America\n\nDon't Ask, Don't Tell\n\nOn December 21, 1993, the Defense Department issues a new policy, stating that applicants to the United States military, \"shall not be asked or required to reveal whether they are homosexual.\"\n\nThis directive, \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" is a small step forward in prohibiting discrimination in the armed forces. It, however, still forbids servicemen and women from participating in homosexual acts and/or telling anyone they are homosexual.\n\nDefense of Marriage Act\n\nOn September 21, 1996, President Clinton signs the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) into law.\n\nIn doing so, he makes the legal definition of marriage, a union between one man and one woman.
