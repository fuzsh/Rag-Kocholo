        "text": "Charities And Celebrities Speak Out Over Immigration Bans\n\nJan 29, 2017 02:25 pm\n\nCharities and stars have spoken out against the immigration bans imposed by the United States government over the weekend.\n\nA statement from the UNHCR reads:\n\n“UNHCR and IOM remain committed to working with the U.S. Administration towards the goal we share to ensure safe and secure resettlement and immigration programmes.\n\n“We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race.”\n\n“We will continue to engage actively and constructively with the U.S. Government, as we have done for decades, to protect those who need it most, and to offer our support on asylum and migration matters.”\n\nCarolyn Miles, President & CEO of Save the Children USA, released the following statement:\n\n“The United States has long been a beacon of hope for the millions of children and families trying to escape war and persecution. The world is facing its largest crisis of displaced people since World War II, with more than 65 million people forced to flee their homes. More than half of all refugees are children, whose only chance for survival and a better future relies on access to safety. We all have a moral obligation to help. Refugee children have been terrorized; they are not terrorists.\n\n“The reality is that the U.S. refugee resettlement program saves lives — namely of women and children under 12, who make up 67 percent of the Syrian refugees in the U.S. — while helping to ensure the safety of our country. Refugees already go through extensive vetting: a refugee’s identity is checked against law enforcement and intelligence databases of at least five federal agencies, a process that takes nearly two years. If there is any doubt about who a refugee is, he or she is not admitted to the United States. Save the Children takes no issue with proposals to further perfect the vetting process to protect our nation’s safety, but we must remember that resettling refugees reinforces our security by supporting key allies that are disproportionately affected by forced displacement.\n\n“The United States should continue to show leadership and share in our global responsibility to provide refuge to the most vulnerable, regardless of religion or nationality. Welcoming refugees sends a strong message to groups that want to do us harm: the United States remains a leading pillar for stability and liberty in the world.”\n\nStars have also declared their opposition to the US president’s executive orders.\n\nRihanna tweeted her disgust, saying “America is being ruined right before our eyes”, while Miley Cyrus also spoke out via Twitter.\n\nSia and Rosie O’Donnell offered to match donations to the American Civil Liberties Union, and Kim Kardashian tweeted a set of revealing statistics that show more Americans are killed annually by their fellow citizens than by Muslims.\n\nOther stars to speak out include Mark Ruffalo, Chrissy Teigen, Judd Apatow, Alyssa Milano, Seth Rogen, Michael Moore, Kerry Washington, Emmy Rossum, Debra Messing, Lily Allen, Sophia Bush, George Takei, Rob Reiner… the list grows stronger by the minute.\n\nIt is not just celebrities speaking out around the world, with many world leaders and businesses condemning the ban, as well as everyday citizens who believe in making the world a better place.\n\nDuchess Of Cambridge Visits EACH Hospice In Quidenham\n\nJan 27, 2017 12:00 pm\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge visited East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH) in Quidenham earlier this week, as it continues fundraising for a new purpose-built hospice in Norfolk.\n\nHer Royal Highness, Royal Patron of EACH, helped to launch The Nook Appeal in 2014, and was updated on the progress of the £10m appeal by staff, supporters, and families who she met at the hospice.\n\nEACH at Quidenham supports families and cares for children and young people with life-threatening conditions from across Norfolk. Their family centred approach includes specialist nursing care, symptom management support, wellbeing activities, and therapy and counselling – all meeting the individual needs of the child or young person, and the whole family.\n\nSince its opening in 1991, the increasing numbers of children with life-threatening conditions and complex healthcare needs visiting Quidenham means the hospice has outgrown its current site. A new purpose-built hospice ‘The Nook’, will help to provide more families with the same facilities as those offered by EACH hospices for Cambridgeshire, Essex and Suffolk.\n\nThe Duchess toured the current facilities of the hospice, meeting families who use the services at Quidenham as they took part in an art therapy session and used the equipment in the sensory room.\n\nFollowing the tour, The Duchess met local supporters of The Nook Appeal as they continue fundraising for the new hospice.\n\nLily Tomlin Reads For SAG-AFTRA Foundation’s Storyline Online\n\nJan 27, 2017 11:30 am\n\nLily Tomlin, the 2017 SAG Life Achievement Award recipient, has added another title to her list of accolades – children’s literacy advocate.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA Foundation’s children’s literacy program Storyline Online (storylineonline.net), sponsored by the Entertainment Industry Foundation, has released its newest video featuring the five-time Emmy Award winning actress, producer, and singer reading Hey, That’s My Monster, written by Amanda Noll and illustrated by Howard McWilliam.\n\nStoryline Online streams free videos featuring acclaimed actors including Kevin Costner, Allison Janney, Christian Slater, Ed O’Neill and Mary Steenburgen reading children’s books alongside inventively animated, original illustrations.

The Elders’ Deputy Chair is Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Director General of the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe Elders noted that India has the largest population in the world without effective health coverage, with tens of millions of people plunged below the poverty line due to their healthcare expenditures. They also expressed concern that the high incidence of people buying often inappropriate medicines from private drug shops is contributing towards an increase in antimicrobial resistance. This poses a threat to Indian and global health security.\n\nThe Elders noted that evidence from other Asian countries shows that India could make more rapid progress towards UHC with a combination of increased political commitment, higher levels of public financing and a series of health systems reforms. Specifically they recommended: increasing public health spending to 2.5% GDP by 2019, focussing additional resources on primary care services and guaranteeing universal access to free essential medicines and diagnostic services.\n\nThe Elders commended the recent health reforms undertaken by the State of Delhi, including the “Mohalla” or neighbourhood clinics in poor areas that provide free primary healthcare services. These reforms could prove a good model for UHC in India. They also welcomed the State of Bihar’s initiative to improve the availability of frontline health workers and free essential medicines.\n\nIf these and other reforms were replicated on a national basis, this could allow India to reach full population coverage – everyone receiving an essential package of healthcare with financial protection – by 2019.\n\nThis would constitute a “bold move to advance UHC [which] could bring tremendous health and economic benefits to the people of India,” The Elders said, noting that currently around one billion Indians are at risk of financial hardship due to healthcare costs.\n\nUHC means that everybody receives the health care they need without suffering financial hardship. It is one of the key targets within the new health Sustainable Development Goal and The Elders believe it is the best way of meeting the overall health Goal and improving the life chances of vulnerable people worldwide.\n\nLamark Media Partners With After-School All-Stars To Support 3rd Annual Celebrity Poker Tournament\n\nJan 27, 2017 07:45 am\n\nLamark Media, an innovative full-service digital marketing agency, partnered with After-School All-Stars as a premier sponsor and strategic partner for the 3rd Annual All-In for All-Stars private charity poker tournament.\n\nThe tournament was held on January 22, 2017, from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Nobu Miami Beach, Florida.\n\nThe charity event benefitted the local South Florida students enrolled in After School All-Stars (ASAS), Arnold Schwarzenegger’s foundation for at-risk youth that provides comprehensive after-school programs that keep children safe and help them succeed in school and life.\n\nHosted by Wayne Boich, Mark Groussman and Sean Posner, and featuring celebrity comedian Tom Arnold, the event featured top prizes from HUBLOT.

As a new father myself, I am even more aware of the importance and value in providing children with the tools that they need to achieve success throughout all stages of life.” – Bryan Shetsky, Founder and CEO of Lamark Media\n\nASAS South Florida’s VP of External Affairs Natalia Sol thanks Lamark Media for their participation in the 2017 tournament.\n\n“We are tremendously grateful to the many incredible partners that supported this important fundraising effort to ensure that critical programs for our community’s most at-risk students can be provided every day from 3-6pm. Working with Lamark Media enables us to amplify our message and engage our greater community in this important work.” – Natalia Sol, Vice President of External Affairs of the South Florida chapter of After-School All-Stars.\n\nNFL Conference Championship games were broadcasted on large screen televisions during the tournament and silent auction, keeping the sports theme throughout, while philanthropists, celebrities, athletes and other supporters enjoyed a day of celebration and fundraising at Nobu on Miami Beach.\n\nSince its inception, the All-In for All-Stars event has raised over $1 million towards the charity fulfilling their mission to help middle school youth through the nation’s largest school-based, comprehensive after-school program.\n\nNominations Open For The 2017 American Humane Hero Dog Awards\n\nJan 27, 2017 06:30 am\n\nAmerican Humane, the country’s first national humane organization, today announced the official start of the 2017 American Humane Hero Dog Awards, sponsored by the Lois Pope LIFE Foundation and broadcast in the fall as a two-hour special on Hallmark Channel.\n\nThe annual, year-long campaign seeks to identify and honor America’s bravest heroes on both ends of the leash. Beginning on January 25th, dog owners across the country are invited to visit www.herodogawards.org and nominate their heroic hound in one of eight categories. The top dog in each category will be flown to Los Angeles and celebrated at the September 16th star-studded, red-carpet awards gala hosted by Beth Stern and James Denton at the Beverly Hilton. One of the category winners will be unveiled as the American Hero Dog of the year – the most prestigious honor a canine can receive.\n\nThe eight categories for 2017 are: Law Enforcement Dogs, sponsored by the K-9 Courage Program from Zoetis; Military Dogs, sponsored by the K-9 Courage Program from Zoetis and the Lois Pope LIFE Foundation; Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs, sponsored by Modern Dog magazine; Emerging Hero Dogs, a category that pays tribute to ordinary dogs who do extraordinary things; Arson Dogs; Search and Rescue Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Following the nominations period, which ends on March 8th, two dozen semifinalists (the top three in each category) will be chosen in a first round of voting by celebrity judges and the public. The second round, featuring a combination of public and celebrity voting, will narrow the field to eight category finalists who will then vie for the title of 2017 American Hero Dog.\n\nOver the past six years, Americans have cast millions of votes for more than a thousand dogs, all seeking the coveted title of American Hero Dog. The program reaches more than 1 billion people each year and draws the support and participation of top celebrity dog lovers from all over the world. Hosts, judges, award presenters, and entertainment acts have included Katharine McPhee, Alison Sweeney, Victoria Stilwell, Betty White, Whoopi Goldberg, Denise Richards, Joey Lawrence, Lisa Vanderpump, Mickey Rooney, Burt Reynolds, Chelsea Handler, Martin Short, Jewel, Wilson Phillips, John Ondrasik, Carson Kressley, Miranda Lambert, Pauley Perrette, Kristin Chenoweth, Naomi Judd, Lori Loughlin, Lea Thompson, Eric Stonestreet, Fred Willard, Danica McKellar, Bailee Madison, and many, many more.\n\nWinners in each category will earn $2,500 for a designated charity partner and the overall winner’s charity partner will win an additional $5,000. Each charity partner is dedicated to celebrating the role of working dogs in our lives, and like American Humane, celebrates the importance of the human-animal bond.\n\n“Every year, hundreds of dogs vie for the coveted title of ‘American Hero Dog’ at the American Humane Hero Dog Awards,” said Dr. Robin Ganzert, American Humane’s president and CEO. “Dogs do so many extraordinary things to improve and even save our lives, and this contest is our way of saluting our best friends.”\n\n“For thousands of years, dogs have protected us, comforted us in times of need, and selflessly saved the lives of those around them,” said Mrs. Pope. “We need to recognize their extraordinary achievements and heroism, and I am pleased to serve once again for the sixth year as the platinum presenting sponsor for the American Humane Hero Dog Awards. I wish all our remarkable nominees luck and look forward to reading their stories of valor and courage.”\n\n“Hallmark Channel is proud to have the American Humane Hero Dog Awards serve as the focal point of our Pet Project,” said Bill Abbott, the President and CEO of Crown Media Family Networks. “The Pet Project is our on- and off-air advocacy and awareness initiative designed to celebrate the joy pets bring to our lives, shine a spotlight on the wonderful animals in shelters across the country, and promote adoption.”\n\nKey dates for the 2017 American Humane Hero Dog Awards contest include:\n\n• Nominations: January 25 – March 8\n\n• 1st Round Voting: March 29 – May 3\n\n• 2nd Round Voting: May 17 – June 28\n\n• 3rd Round Voting: July 12 – August 30\n\n• American Humane Hero Dog Awards event in Los Angeles – September 16\n\nNominations for 2017 Hero Vet and Hero Vet Tech Awards to Open February 2\n\nAnd because behind every hero pet there is a hero veterinarian or veterinary technician, the Hero Dog Awards once again will feature a second campaign – the American Humane Hero Veterinarian and Hero Veterinary Technician Awards, sponsored by Zoetis. Starting February 2 at 12pm Pacific Time, pet owners and animal lovers across America will be invited to nominate their favorite animal caretakers in these two fields, with each to be honored at the Hero Dog Awards event on September 16.\n\nMore information about the 2017 American Humane Hero Dog Awards, including complete contest rules and entry information, can be obtained by visiting www.herodogawards.org.
