The First American Party System Essay Section 8 Chapter 5: The First American Party System Today, political parties are an authoritative and essential component of the United States political system. However, it is important to examine how the political parties began and evolved over hundreds of years, since they were first established. In 1794, the major political parties were the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans. The major difference between these two was that the Federalists favored a strong central government, while the Democratic Republicans preferred a central government with limited power and more state control. At the time of the election, it seemed that the prominent, distinguished Federalist Party clearly had the upper hand, but in the end the ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... A looming question in the minds of many people was whether political parties would destroy the newly formed union or strengthen it and opinion on the answer was highly divided. The years from 1789 to 1801 and the events that took place between them were vital in the survival and development of the government of the new nation. The American people had proved to be effective in destroying governments, as seen in the American Revolution and the ultimate destruction of the Articles of Confederation and the test of the nation was if the people could build a new, competent government (93). The 1794 election was tremendously important in that it was part of the shift towards a more democratic government and the citizens of the land feared both an oligarchic based system and a democratic one. Although the Federalists controlled much of the public opinion, John Swanwick and the Democratic Republicans procured the victory. Swanwick controlled the votes of seven of the twelve wards, and collected 56% of the votes cast (93). This defeat resulted in a sudden shift from Federalist power to Democratic Republican dominance and Federalism slowly lost more and more influence. The evidence available to analyze the election of 1794 and why it turned out the way it did is vast and diverse. The way to understand any election is to understand why the voters chose one candidate ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n3.

China, the fourth largest country on the earth, displays the label of communism today. Communism is a classless ideology in which all property is owned by a large community and each person receives according to their needs and abilities. Communism is a set of ideas including several different variations and schemes on the philosophy. However, the most accepted and relevant initial theory was first created by Karl Marx (5th May 1818 to 14th March 1883), who is also known as the father of communism. The main theory of communism, created by Karl Marx, is the theory that was and is utilized by many countries. ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... This is due to the fact that communists believe that there should be no division in social class and hierarchy. A negative impact of communism on a country s society is that it does not recognise individual talent. During the mid nineteenth century after communism has took over china, many individuals were arguing that their field of their talent (such as art, music, agricultural skills etc.) was not being seen and recognised by anyone in society. This is believed to be a trigger for the 1959 Tibetan uprising protests (which occurred just ten years after china was under communist rule) in China against a communist party rule. Therefore, communism has had a major impact on a country s society as a whole. Another way Communism has impacted the society is by altering culture. An example is the Soviet Union at the beginning of the cold war. During the cold war, Joseph Stalin (18th December 1878 to 5th March 1953) attempt to enforce communist culture within the society was by altering people s perspective of beliefs. Joseph Stalin and other communist leaders believed that the decisive factor in the world to win a war was power, and that power was ultimately the power to dominate and coerce by superior pressure rather than the power to persuade or to engage cooperatively. They defined international society by its distribution of power, and they saw the opportunity for the Soviet Union as more to contend for domination than to ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n8.

Drinking Water Affecting Birds Osmotic Balance Providing electrolytes in the drinking water alters the birds osmotic balance in a way that enhances thirst (Teeter and Belay, 1996). Drinking saline water increases sodium concentrations in plasma which is capable, at certain levels, of changing the osmolality of body fluids. The osmolality of the extracellular fluid is controlled primarily by the concentration of sodium and its attendant anions (Verbalis, 2003). The increased tonicity of the extracellular fluid increases the osmotic pressure on the body cells that may result in drawing water from the cells into the extracellular fluid. To prevent this, certain neurons (osmo Na+ receptors) detects the concentration of sodium in extracellular fluid and triggers osmotic thirst to help restore the body fluids to a normal state (Stachenfeld, 2008). In humans, a minimal change (2 3%) in plasma tonicity is capable of inducing thirst (Stachenfeld, 2008). ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... However, during the subsequent days (day 25 and 31), the enhanced drinking behavior was noted only in the 0.4% NaCl group; while, birds provided with 0.7% NaCl returned to water consumption rates comparable to those observed in the tap water groups.

Film Analysis Of Stanley Kubrick s A Clockwork Orange Stanley Kubrick has returned after his 1971 s controversial success A Clockwork Orange with his tonally different 1975 feature, Barry Lyndon. His last feature was a movie that was ultra violent and about a totalitarianism society. This movie is different by a wide margin. It has more of a historical value because it takes place in England during the Seven Years War and we get a sense of English society at the time. It is also based off the works of famed nineteenth century writer William Makepeace Thackeray. This film also has a lovely atmospheric air to it. Kubrick, as usual, masterfully write this feature. You could tell that this is his pet project. However, the movie does clock in at over three hours and with the lack of action, there can be a dull moment or two to be had. After all, I feel the aristocratic world can get somewhat boring at times. That being said, we have Kubrick on the top of his game as he created a valued historical narrative that remains mostly interesting and our eyes are able to feast on perfect costuming and successful camera experimenting. Essentially, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott shot the film without the use of electrical light, and that is why the look of the film seemed a bit odd compared to other films. Narratively, I felt the first hour of the film was the strongest. I found the last two hours enjoyable, but it would be very hard to top the perfect narrative of the first hour.

In this type of system, power is the main objective that each state plans to accomplish because only by achieving this power they can protect themselves and survive. According to this theory, there are different powers that a state plans to achieve for example the military power, the economic power or the diplomatic power.

And the last assumption sees a country as a unitary actor . The nature of the international system defines the main problems that a country can face (Holsti, 1985) . Realism was a dominant model of explaining the concept of international relations during the past six decades and was considered to be a framework in order to analyses and understand better the First World War, The Second World war, and the Cold War. But, Classical Realism is described as a pessimistic theory of understanding the human nature, when is distinguished that egoism and self interested attitude are base of the phenomenon known as homopoliticus . According to Classical Realism, the question of why exists conflict and war in the world is founded on human nature characteristics. In order to eliminate this problem, later was developed a new theory, the Modern Realist theory, which pointed out that the structure of the international system can be used as an instrument to explain and understand more the state behavior.

Britain s Policy Of Appeasement Britain in the 1930s followed a policy of appeasement to retain peace between countries and stop the fascist powers of Italy and Germany causing disruption. There is a subsequent amount of evidence to suggest the policy of appeasement was a failure due to events including the Abyssinian Crisis, the Reoccupation of the Rhineland, The Anglo German Naval Agreement, the Spanish Civil War and the Anschluss. Although it can also be argued that Britain had some success with preventing the fascist powers making appeasement successful. After the First World War, Germany was made to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 outlining terms and conditions Germans had to accept and abide by. This angered many Germans as it was felt the terms were too harsh. In the 1930s, the British foreign policy of appeasement aimed to preserve the peace between nations and prevent war breaking out by negotiating with any issues that may arise. Britain also aimed to protect the empire as it was under threat as well as working with the League of Nations although it was weakened after The Great War. These specific aims were successful to an extent as there was no instant war however, war did break out in 1939 and it can be argued that appeasement only caused Hitler and Mussolini to gain confidence within their fascist ideas.

What are the major strengths and weakness of Dworkin s theory of law as compared to a positivist or natural law perspective? Discuss. Arguably one of the most influential legal theorists of the 20th century, Ronald Dworkin s dealings with law s interpretation and integrity has lead to inevitable contradictions with that of positivist ideology, with his work essentially revitalising a method of thinking that had long been considered dead and buried. Perhaps most notoriously, Dworkin combated the positivist theory of his former teacher and predecessor as Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University, H.L.A. Hart. When comparing the two, it is apparent that Dworkin and Hart disagree on a plethora of issues, however there exist several ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... As such, it is possible that numerous conflicting principles may exist in the one scenario. Dworkin even goes further by introducing the concept of policy defining a policy as that kind of standard that sets out a goal to be reached, generally an improvement in some economic, political, or social feature of the community . The famous US decision of Riggs v Palmer serves to illustrate a considerable strength in Dworkin s argument concerning rules and principles. The New York court had to decide a case to determine whether a grandson who poisoned his grandfather to obtain his inheritance was in fact able to collect such an inheritance. At the time, there existed no statute or law that invalidated his claim as a beneficiary due to his involvement in the murder. Furthermore, the applicable legal rule seemed to be that legacies contained in legally valid testamentary dispositions are to be guaranteed by law in accordance with the wishes of the testator. According to Hart, the court should, in this situation, be decided upon pre existing law. Yet despite this, the court majority found that the grandson could not inherit, instead appealing to moral reasoning by citing the principle that no one should be able to profit from ones crimes. A similar decision based on principle was handed down 70 years later in the case of Henningsen v Bloomfield Motors Inc. As a result of these cases, Dworkin is able ...

Some people also tend to dislike the disabled due to their own weaknesses, to hide their own failures they will look down upon the handicap to make themselves feel better. Some people s self esteem is so tiny that they have to find someone lower than them to feel superior. Also society perceives the disabled as useless, powerless and inefficient human beings, which also contributes to the ideology that leads to the discrimination against the disabled. Psychological and cultural influences also result in discrimination against the disabled. Hence, we can conclude that the fact that the disabled are different is what leads to the discrimination against them. Direct discrimination occurs when a person with a disability is treated less favourably than a person who does not have a disability. This occurs if a person is discriminated against in the following areas; employment, education and training, provision of facilities, access to public premises, etc...

Dwight D. Eisenhower as did many Unites States presidents, stated countless times that a democracy can only stand with virtuous people as its citizens. If evil people fill the country, only a dictatorship can bring order. This case demonstrates that America is built upon allowing the free speech of controversial and opposing views. Limiting the rights of the NSPA would pave the way for other types of speech to be limited. My initial view was of course that anyone promoting Nazis views should not be allowed to march, especially considering the town s Jewish population. After further consideration, I realized that if the government has the ability to restrict Nazis protests, they have the ability to silence me if I am trying to share my faith with a Nazi and it offends them.

An alternative treatment to type 2 diabetes is insulin therapy since it is difficult to achieve desired glucose levels due to increased spread of the disease. Transplantation of pancreas or replacement of patient s islets of Langerhans is an ongoing treatment capable of achieving normoglycemia. However the limitations of immunesupression and scarcity of donor pancreas make this procedure not very desirable. Stem cells therapy has been considerd as an alternative stratergy for replacement of damaged cells , example embryonic stem cells , bone marrow stem cells etc. Initially to cure type 1 diabetes , insulin producing cells were created by transducing bone marrow stem cells with the pancreatic duodenal homobox (Pdx1) gene. Although this experiment was successful in normalizing glucose levels in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice, the low level of insulin production and the unlikeliness of producing the culture conditions in vivo make this approach unfit for clinical applications.
