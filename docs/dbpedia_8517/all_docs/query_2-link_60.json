        "text": "My name is Max du Preez.\n\nI was born in a small, rural town in the Free State province of South Africa called Kroonstad in 1951. And Kroonstad—the Afrikaans society then was very conservative. I came from a very conservative, Christian, nationalist, Afrikaner nationalist family very strict upbringing, very conventional, lived in a world where we didn’t really know much about the world outside of us. Kroonstad was more or less my universe as a young child, and especially white Kroonstad and Afrikaans-speaking Kroonstad.\n\nThat was my immediate environment; the rest of the country you didn’t really take notice of. And black people you don’t take notice of; they just work in the kitchen and the garden and you see them sometimes on the streets. And you sometimes hear the adults talk about the threat that they pose to white survival and the civilization and stuff like that.\n\n[Afrikaners are the descendants of Dutch settlers who came to Africa’s Cape of Good Hope in 1652. During the Anglo-Boer Wars that spanned the 19th and 20th centuries, the Afrikaners and South Africa were overtaken by the British Empire.]\n\nSo a very insulated existence andI left high school there and then went to Stellenbosch University—no, I first went to do a year of compulsory military training. Fortunately it was before there were any wars going on, so I didn’t have to fight in any wars. I just learned to march up and down and shoot a few guns, and I wasn’t very good at it.\n\nAnd then I went to Stellenbosch University, which in those days—and that was in 1970—it was kind of glorified high school. It’s more of the same. There were no black students, very few English-speaking students, strong discipline, and I found it hugely disappointing. And that in itself was very spectacular for a 17-year old from the rural areas. So I suppose my university education did mean something to my development. But it was more or less the same.\n\nThe leader of the Afrikaner Broederbond, which is this secret, powerful, Afrikaner society which sort of ran society here for a while—the leader was also the head of the university, which gives you an idea of what went on at Afrikaans universities at the time. There was a bit of rebelliousness among students in the early ‘70s but nothing serious.\n\n[The Afrikaner Broederbond, or Afrikaner Brotherhood in English, was a South African secret society composed of Afrikaans-speaking, Protestant, white men over the age of 25 that was established in 1918.]\n\nI was, strangely enough, when I look back—the first thing that I noticed that I can remember back was that I was touched by the American students who were shot—I think it was at Kent State University. And we didn’t have television then; I must have read it somewhere. And I remember being outraged. I think it was possibly one of the first political emotions I ever had in my life, that fellow students could be shot for just expressing their views and for fighting for peace. And I mean, it later on didn’t pass me by, that the injustice to white American students was what stirred my political feelings and not the injustice of the apartheid system around me. But at the university I started broadening my horizons a little bit and started noticing where we live and what situation the country was in.\n\n[On May 4, l970 members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of Kent State University demonstrators who were protesting the Vietnam War, killing four and wounding nine.]\n\nI then started working for the Afrikaans newspaper in Cape Town called Die Burger, which was officially a mouthpiece of the National Party, which was the main party supporting apartheid, the ruling party. And it was very interesting to me because I—it was more intellectually stimulating. But I think I misunderstood the code of Afrikaans journalism at the time, because you were taught as a cub reporter that what you do is reflect the truth and the full truth to your readers, and you don’t pander to politicians or anybody else.\n\nAnd I thought that was it. The code was of course that unless those politicians were the leaders of “Afrikanerdom” or the leaders of the National Party, then you do treat them differently.\n\n[The National Party, founded in 1914, ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1994. Its following included mostly Dutch-descended Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. The National Party was long dedicated to policies of apartheid and white supremacy. By the early 1990s, the party had moved toward sharing power with South Africa’s black majority.]\n\nSouth Africa is a nation of almost 53 million on the southern tip of Africa. The nation has a unique multicultural character and is approximately 80 percent African and 10 percent European, with the remaining 10 percent being of mixed race or Asian heritage. These broad racial categories include a multitude of ethnic and linguistic groups.\n\nAlthough it has the largest economy on the continent, much of the nation remains in poverty and there is great economic disparity. Historically, the mining industry has played a key role in South Africa’s economy and it continues to remain an important industry today, alongside manufacturing, tourism, and financial services.\n\nSouth Africa was first settled by non-natives in 1652, when the Dutch established an outpost in what would later become Cape Town. Soon after, British, French, and German settlers came to the area. The descendants of the original Dutch settlers became known as Afrikaners. Conflicts over land and power arose between the settling groups as well as between the settlers and the native people of the region. In 1910, Britain formally created the Union of South Africa as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire.\n\nThroughout South Africa’s history, non-whites were subjected to widespread discrimination. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government passed a series of laws institutionalizing discrimination and segregation. In the 1948 elections, the National Party, which served as a platform for Afrikaner nationalism, gained power. The National Party program was centered on the system of racial segregation known as apartheid. Supporters of apartheid argued that South Africa was made up of four distinct racial groups: white, black, “Coloured” or mixed-race, and Indian.\n\nThe white minority oppressed the African majority and other non-white groups. Black Africans were particularly disadvantaged in terms of education, housing, income, and health. Blacks were denied citizenship and not permitted to use the services and facilities accessible by the white minority. Many blacks were forced to relocate when their neighborhoods were declared “white.” A series of laws enacted in the 1950s further codified and expanded racial segregation. In part, the National Party justified its policies by branding its opponents as communists.\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC) was founded in 1912 to advocate for the rights of black South Africans. As apartheid expanded, the ANC and other groups used both nonviolent and violent actions to combat the government. The ANC and other groups were oppressed by the government, and many of their senior leaders were banned or imprisoned. Nelson Mandela, a prominent ANC leader, was imprisoned from 1962 to 1990.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the anti-apartheid movement gained strength. Foreign governments and the international community isolated South Africa. International sanctions damaged the economy and helped erode domestic support for apartheid. Meanwhile, the end of the Cold War weakened the government’s claim that yielding power would lead to a communist takeover.\n\nIn 1990, the government of South Africa took its first steps toward ending apartheid when it ended a ban on certain political organizations including the ANC. Nelson Mandela and other opposition leaders were released from prison and apartheid legislation was repealed. F.W. de Klerk, President from 1989-1994, helped to broker this transition of South Africa from the apartheid-era to a multi-racial democracy. In 1993, de Klerk and Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work.\n\nIn 1994, South Africa held its first election that allowed all adults to vote, regardless of race. The ANC gained power and Nelson Mandela was elected president. South Africa enacted a liberal, democratic constitution, backed by a strong and independent judiciary. While the ANC has remained the strongest party, elections are vigorously contested and democratic safeguards are respected. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated abuses and crimes committed during the apartheid era.\n\nFreedom House’s 2013 Freedom in the World report categorized South Africa as “free” with an overall freedom rating of two, with one being the most free and seven being the least. The country also received ratings of two in political rights and civil liberties. However, in the 2013 Freedom of the Press report, the nation was categorized as “party free” due to government restrictions on the press and the prevalence of civil cases brought against journalists for libel."
