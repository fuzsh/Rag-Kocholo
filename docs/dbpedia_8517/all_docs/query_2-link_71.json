        "text": "I am thrilled to share an article written by my grandfather, Gastone Ferlini, titled “L’Appennino Che Resiste” (The Resilient Apennines), which profoundly resonates with my academic and professional journey. This article delves into the deep-seated sense of belonging and identity through the lens of placemaking and cultural preservation in the picturesque Villa di Cedrecchia, a charming hamlet in the Comune di San Benedetto Val di Sambro. The narrative beautifully illustrates the resilience of this community amidst natural adversities and socio-economic challenges. It underscores the collective efforts of residents, volunteers, and local institutions in preserving cultural and religious heritage, ensuring the continuity of local traditions, and fostering community cohesion. As someone deeply invested in the fields of cultural studies, urban planning, and community development, this article strikes a chord with my belief in the power of place and memory in shaping our identities. The themes of resilience, community engagement, and the maintenance of cultural landscapes echo the core principles of my research and professional endeavors. I am incredibly proud to carry forward this legacy of passion and dedication to preserving our cultural and environmental heritage. My grandfather’s words inspire me to continue exploring and advocating for sustainable and inclusive placemaking practices. This piece is a testament to the importance of nurturing our connections to places and the shared memories they hold. It is a reminder that our roots and stories are vital in shaping resilient and vibrant communities. 🌿 Read the full article and join me in celebrating the resilience of the Apennines and the power of place in our lives. #CulturalHeritage #Placemaking #CommunityDevelopment #Sustainability #UrbanPlanning #Resilience #Identity #SenseOfPlace #ProudMoment\n\nThe initiative of the Regulatory Council of the Arlanza Designation of Origin in collaboration with Bodegas Valtravieso aims to promote the recovery of the Sabinares Natural Park, after the devastating fire that destroyed 2,500 hectares in the summer of 2022. The impact of the fire on the Sabinar not only seriously affected the environment, but also impacted on the lives of the neighbours and the integral development of the territory, so the main objective is to obtain donations from individuals and entities so that we can complete the recovery of the affected area, planting 1,945 trees in this environment of incalculable ecological and heritage value, as this Park is the largest and best Sabinar of the entire planet. https://lnkd.in/dnmbwE8T\n\nTHE OOSTFLANK AS CENTRAL THEME TO THE ROTTERDAM REAL ESTATE DAY 2023 Coming Tuesday, September 12, the Oostflank will be central to the discussion about the city. The last year, we worked intensively together with the municipality and other partners on delivering an integral development vision and strategy. Significant steps will already be taken in the coming years in current area developments such as Alexanderknoop, Brainpark, Stadionpark or Hart van Zuid. Plans for the other sub-areas will be further elaborated in the coming period. These are expected to be realized in the period between 2030 and 2040. What can market parties mean in this? And what are the newest updates by the municipality?

It is so important to celebrate. Most of the times in life it is so easy to just acknowledge the win and see it as part of life and not smelling the roses…I am guilty of this from time to time. It’s key to talk about the good the bad the ugly…and always learn from the bad and the ugly, and celebrate the good! A celebration doesn’t mean an a huge party, it’s just talking about it as a team, getting energy from it and leverage the wins for future wins! We had a great win last week at Cobild - ranked #3 in Australia’s Great Place To Work. We are pumped and we are celebrating how much of an incredible team we have and an incredible culture! Our Cobildians rock So what are you celebrating this week? #celebratesuccess #funisenegy #notyourtypical #relationshipsforlife #construction #melbourneproperty #melbourneproperty #propertydevelopment #property #gptw2023 #gptwcertified\n\nThis image of the city of Bruges is an excellent way of showing that we are in relationship with nature. (shared by Wouter van Noort via Peter Branner) Eliel Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect, drew parallels between urban planning and the natural growth of living organisms. He studied the development of how medieval towns evolved to demonstrate the physical order of urban areas in a similar manner to how we understand living organisms. We can see this here. Saarinen compared Bruges to a human leg section. He highlighted the importance of intuition, instinct, and imagination. These are extremely important when working regeneratively. The frameworks we engage with in our regenerative Community of Practice allow us to organise that intuition to better understand our projects as living organisms. What do you think? Do you see a living organism in Bruges? 🏰 Interested in learning more about regeneration in the built environment? Our next Foundational Learning Journey starts in late March. It's the building block you need to join our Community of Practice and really start integrating regeneration into your work. 🏰 Find out more: https://lnkd.in/es5x9MHJ\n\n10 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗶𝗱𝗻'𝘁 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗡𝗼𝗿𝘄𝗮𝘆: 1.
