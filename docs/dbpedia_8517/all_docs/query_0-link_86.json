        "text": "Kroonstad is one of the Free State’s larger towns and is situated on the banks of the Vals River along the N1 south from Parys.\n\nThe town has a rich history with many examples of typical old sandstone buildings and Free State architecture. There are also a number of buildings designed by world renowned early 20th century architect Sir Herbert Baker, whose distinctive style defines the post-colonial architecture of South Africa from the Union Buildings in Pretoria down to manor houses and even cottages with a mix of pillars, archways, cape dutch gables and chateaux features with french windows, doors and balconies.\n\nThe pervasive Edwardian style architecture of (and influenced by) Herbert Baker is a part of South Africa’s heritage and surprises many first time visitors to the country, and some lovely examples can be found in Kroonstad such as the Kroonstad Post Office.\n\nKroonstad is based on agricultural commerce, but it is also a popular destination for anglers, and a conveniant stop-over en-route to Bloemfontein from Johannesburg. The Vals River – a willow-tree lined tributary of the Vaal River that runs through the centre of Kroonstad, and the Bloemhok Dam are both good spots for fly-fishing. Hiking and walking trails, as well as camping or just picnicking along the banks of the Vals River are popular pastimes in Kroonstad.\n\nKroonstad is the third largest town in the Free State after the town of Welkom and the City of Bloemfontein, and therefore boasts all city amenities, many restaurants and several entertainment venues.\n\nRather sadly, Kroonstad was named after a horse named Kroon that drowned in the Vals River in the mid 1800’s.\n\nGetting there: Take the N1 south from Johannesburg to Parys, then continue along it to Kroonstad."
