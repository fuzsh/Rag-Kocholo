        "meta_description": "Geographical distributions based on available records are presented for the 37 currently recognized species of Bembix Fabricius known to occur in southern Africa. These are albata Parker, albicapilla Arnold, albofasciata Smith, anomalipes Arnold, arnoldi Arnold, atrospinosa Turner, baumanni Handlirsch, bubalus Handlirsch, cameronis Handlirsch, capensis Lepeletier, capicola Handlirsch, carinata F. Smith, cultrifera Arnold, denticauda Arnold, diversipennis F. Smith, flavicincta R. Turner, fraudulenta Arnold, fuscipennis Lepeletier, gracilens J. Parker, harenarum Arnold, karroensis Gess, liturata R. Turner, loupata R. Parker, massaica Cameron, melanopa Handlirsch, moebii Handlirsch, monedula Handlirsch, namibensis Gess, ochracea Handlirsch, olivata Dahlbom, regnata Parker, scaura Arnold, sibilans Handlirsch, triangulifera Arnold, ulula Arnold, venusta Arnold, and zinni Gess. A single specimen of Bembix compedita R. Turner has been recorded from South Africa but as the species is known principally from Malawi this requires confirmation.Some diagnostic characters are given for the hitherto undescribed female of namibensis.A range of distribution patterns are noted &ndash; narrowly endemic to widespread through the Afrotropical Region and into Egypt. Four species, albata, arnoldi, harenarum and fraudulenta appear to have strictly southern African coastal distributions.A summary of the knowledge of flower associations, nesting and prey are given for those species for which data are available.",
