From 1970-1975 she was imprisoned in Kroonstad for contravention of the Terrorism Act. Two years later, she was banished from Cape Town to the Free State, where she spent nine years under house arrest in Brandfort with her youngest daughter, Zindzi. Her small house had no running water, electricity or telephone and was burnt twice during her house arrest, which ended in 1985. Winnie’s home in Brandfort is currently being renovated as a museum.\n\nReturn to the Free State Town/Cities page HERE.\n\nKey Statistics 2011"
