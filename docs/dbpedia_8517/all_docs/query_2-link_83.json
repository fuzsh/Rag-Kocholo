        "text": "Programme Notes: CTMT 2007\n\n“The South African Army Band Kroonstad is the SA Army’s regional Regular Force band for the Free State Province. It was founded in 1977, when the excellent Correctional Services Band was dissolved as a result of re-organisation and many of its members transferred to the South African Army.\n\nIt has a reputation for excellence and performs at innumerable military and civilian parades and functions. The Director of Music is Major D Fourie, one of the original Correctional Services founder members. The Assistant Director of Music is Capt A P Mostert and the Bandmaster is WO1 C N Steyn.” (CTMT 2007)\n\nProgramme Notes: CTMT 2008\n\n“The South African Army Band Kroonstad is the regional Army band for the Free State Province. It was founded in 1977, when the excellent Correctional Services Band was dissolved as a result of re-organisation in that Department. Many Correctional Services bandsmen transferred to the South African Army and became founder members of the new Kroonstad Band. As time went by, bandsmen from other bands reinforced the band.\n\nThe Kroonstad Band is generally regarded as one of the best military bands in South Africa and performs at innumerable military parades and military funerals, as well as at such functions as concerts, choir festivals and carol services. In 2008, it became the first South African band to visit the United States when it participated in the Virginia Military Tattoo. The Director of Music is Major Dawie Fourie, one of the Correctional Services founder members. The Assistant Director of Music is Captain A P Mostert and the Bandmaster is WO1 C N Steyn.” (CTMT 2008)\n\nProgramme Notes: CTMT 2010\n\n“The SA Army Band Kroonstad came into existence on 1 April 1997. The band was formed from remnant members of the abolished Correctional Services Band and also members of the ex-Bophuthatswana Army Band.\n\nThey still utilise the original band facility in Kroonstad where the Correctional Services Band used to rehearse. The Kroonstad band serves a vast geographical area in the central interior of the country, but also has the ability to be deployed further towards the coastal areas and up north, if needs be. The band is well known for their interesting parade displays as well as for the quality of all their musical performances at concerts and gala evenings.\n\nThe band currently has thirty-seven members and the Director of Music is Major D.H. Fourie. The Assistant Director of Music is Captain A. Mostert and the Bandmaster is Warrant Officer Class I, C N Steyn.” (CTMT 2010)\n\nProgramme Notes: CTMT 2012\n\n“The SA Army Band Kroonstad came into existence on 1 April 1997.
