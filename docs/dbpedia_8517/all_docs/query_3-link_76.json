        "text": "The spatial organisation of the adventure tourism industry in South Africa is presented based on an analysis of a national dataset of adventure tourism suppliers. At a national level, the spatial distribution of adventure tourism in South Africa is geographically uneven. The Western Cape is by far the most important province in terms of adventure, followed by KwaZulu-Natal and then Gauteng. Coastal provinces are at an advantage when it comes to building an adventure tourism industry, but the presence of physical resources such as the sea, mountains, rivers, dunes, open veld and nature reserves alone, does not account for development of the sector. Density and distribution of operators is also linked to both population size and disposable incomes, making adventure tourism a tourism-related product across all provinces, but also a tourism-characteristic product in both the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, supported by both domestic and international tourists. Indications are that for seven of the nine provinces, the sector is underdeveloped so opportunities for expansion abound, especially in terms of urban adventure products.\n\nBungee jumping is a global phenomenon and is an important sector of the adventure tourism market, acknowledged as an iconic form of hard adventure. Commercial operators are located in North and South America, Asia, Europe and Australasia. In Africa, commercial bungee jumping takes place in Uganda, Zambia and South Africa. This paper fills a gap in the international literature by firstly providing an overview of the global bungee industry, and secondly locating the South African bungee jumping sector within it. Thus, the supply side of the market is analysed geographically, with a focus on iconic, African and South African jump sites. The study found that bungee jumping takes on a similar form across the globe, notably, a high staff to client ratio; the need for strict safety measures; the provision of additional adventure activities on or near the site and the sale of souvenirs. The paper presents the hither to unknown commercial signature of bungee jumping. Finally, the case for South Africa’s commercial bungee jumping industry as a globally being globally competitive one is presented.\n\nTourism is currently one of the world’s fastest growing industries (Cluster Consortium,1999). The phenomenal growth of tourism worldwide has led to tourism becoming big business and highly considered by governments as part of their developmental strategies. Tourism is able to create local jobs, empowers communities and distribute income are some of the reasons that both private and public sector players want to attract tourism to their destinations. For the purposes of the envisaged research, accommodation shall be the focus of the research within the Mangaung municipal area in the Free State Province. ‘’The tourist economy of Bloemfontein is dominated by the tourist accommodation sector. In addition, this sector comprises mainly guesthouses and bed-and-breakfast establishments’’ Visser (2007:356). Bloemfontein is at the centre of the tourist system in the Free State as the centre of the government, and business. The accommodation sector is very important to the tourism industry bec...\n\nSouth Africa’s major pull factors in terms of attractions include the typical must see ‘bucket list’ destinations, including Soweto, for example. The famous township has developed as a strong destination, dominating the competition from other key township destinations, with a rich political and cultural history. With Johannesburg being the second most visited city in the Middle East & Africa Region, the potential for further tourism development becomes more pronounced. Primary attractions such as Soweto become key in accessing important markets to achieve growth but for sustainability, product diversification becomes essential in order to increase the geographic spread of the benefits that tourism can bring. In contrast to the successes of tourism development in Soweto, other areas such as Hillbrow are struggling to compete at the same level. The inner city residential neighbourhood of Hillbrow was in its heyday, a popular entertainment magnet of book shops, clubs, restaurants and coffee bars. Several years later and in present day, the area is reputed as crime-ridden, suffering a variety of social ills and generally unfavourable to visit. Crime can be a debilitating factor in the development of tourism, where even the perception of its existence can make it particularly difficult to achieve economic growth. However, it is not all bleak for Hillbrow. The area offers up a melting pot of African cultures, creating opportunity to enable unity, cultural tolerance and understanding and a more diversified product base for the urban rejuvenation efforts of the city of Johannesburg. This paper explores the challenges in developing Hillbrow as a tourist destination in light of existing dominant primary attractions with key stakeholder interviews, including tour operators, local business owners and the Johannesburg tourism authority, in order to understand the challenges faced by such stakeholders and the perception of the potential for further tourism development and planning.\n\nSince 1994, the South African adventure tourism industry, both in its hard and soft manifestations, has grown rapidly, and its geographic footprint is now wide. Despite this, little is known about the industry in South Africa. In particular, data on the demand for, and supply of, this type of tourism product are lacking. This paper seeks to contribute to the understanding of the sector and provides an outline of one of South Africa’s few urban adventure enterprises, namely Orlando Towers Bungee. Traditionally Soweto has been a heritage, ‘struggle’ or ‘justice’ tourism destination, mainly popular with international tourists. Local tourists, especially white people, are few and far between, except for the ubiquitous school tour buses. It is argued, therefore, that bungee jumping, an iconic form of hard adventure tourism, represents a maturing of the tourism market in Soweto as it attracts domestic tourists to the locality. Furthermore, Orlando Bungee is helping to foster significant enterprise development and job creation in this disadvantaged community, making the enterprise pro-poor. Lastly, as the bungee jumping operation represents private investment in a former ‘brown field’ site, it is also contributing to the urban renewal initiatives of the area.\n\nTourism Climate Indices (TCIs) have been used extensively in the global North to quantify the climatic suitability of tourist destinations. TCIs have very seldom been applied in the global South. This gap in the literature is significant, due to the considerable growth that tourism sectors in the global South have experienced over recent decades. Moreover, many of these countries seldom have the infrastructure to modify indoor climates and effectively mitigate against poor weather. We present TCI results for 18 tourist destinations across South Africa. With mean annual TCI scores for the period 1995-2015 spanning 76.5 for Port Nolloth to 93 for the Pilansberg, the comparatively favourable climatic conditions in South Africa relative to much of Europe and North America is confirmed. There is distinct seasonality in TCI scores for the majority of study locations, yet the dichotomy between the South African summer and rainfall zones ensure a net balance in climatic suitability countrywide year-round. Time trends in TCI scores over recent decades indicate non-significant change for the majority of locations, and all significant trends indicate slight improvements in the climatic suitability for tourism. These results present a promising outlook of sustained climatic suitability of the region for tourism.\n\nResearch on local economic development in South Africa has been dominated by reflections on the larger metropolitan areas, while secondary cities have received scant attention. This paper evaluates local economic development initiatives in six secondary cities in South Africa. It advances three arguments based on South African and international literature. First, the local economic development strategies for these cities pay too little attention to creating effective links with their rural hinterlands. Second, while globalization increases both vulnerabilities and opportunities, these cities are ill-prepared to deal with the former or benefit from the latter. Third, local economic development strategies tend to focus on cluster initiatives, which in essence are inward looking. Such strategies increase competition with the larger metropolitan areas. The secondary cities are unlikely to compete effectively with these larger areas if they continue to follow inward-looking or cluster-oriented approaches."
