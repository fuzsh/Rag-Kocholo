Kroonstad (Afrikaans for Crown City) on the Vals River, is the third-largest town in the Free State province of South Africa. It lies about 175 km south of Johannesburg. It was established in 1855 and named after a horse named Kroon (Crown), belonging to Voortrekker Sarel Cilliers, which drowned there in a stream. It was the temporary capital of the Orange Free State, and during the Second Anglo-Boer War the British built a concentration camp there to intern Boer women and children captured under their 'scorched earth' policy. The Bloemhoek Dam lies just east of the city and supplies most of its water needs.
