        "text": "×\n\nChef John Helfritch joins the team at Southern Soul Barbeque. A Pennsylvania native, Helfrich attended Johnson and Wales in Providence, RI. From a Sous Chef position at Nemacolin Woodlands in Farmington, PA, John’s path led him to Sea Island where he was on the opening team as Sous Chef of the Lodge and later served as Executive Banquet Chef. In 2008, John was promoted to Executive Chef of the Lodge and Retreat, where he oversaw the culinary program until his recent move to Southern Soul Barbeque in June 2015. He has participated in several prestigious events: the Walker Cup, opening three Forbes 5 star hotels, numerous PGA Tour events, and the G-8 Summit at Sea Island in 2004. Chef John is excited to join one of St. Simons Island’s top destination restaurants. Barbeque started off as a hobby, but after meeting Harrison Sapp and Griffin Bufkin, he quickly grew passionate about it. John looks forward to creating new dishes and growing the Southern Soul Barbeque brand."
