William Harrison, 61 Church Street, Hanover Green, entertained I Compensation Held Football A Leopard Cannot Change His Spots A Political Judge Cannot Cleanse His Bespattered ed Ermine-- 'didates is a fallacy as it is the chiefest menace to independent government .\n\nThey may not and probably will not ever be called upon to pay their debt to the machine in petty matters. Such are left to the small fry. But in major matters- -those which vitally concern continued existence of the machine and a perpetuation of its policies its cogs who have character and attainment which the machine counted upon as vote getting assets are none the less compelled to go Voters Have Power To Homes As promised in this series of political studies, neither the writer nor his newspaper has any set of candidates to offer and we bear no allegiance to any sentiment save a 'desire' for good government in our home city free and independent of outside domination. The crowning disgrace of all has followed with recent hours. The Honorable Ambrose Langan, drawing salaries both as Mayor of Pittston and a pleasing remuneration of $5,000 salary plus expenses and a car from the State as some sort of an inspector, has personally, taken charge as chief Fine lieutenant of the Wilkes- Barre situation .\n\nIt is pathetic situation. Starting with a declaration of independence as to city affairs, we close with the same unfaltering purpose. In old Anglo-Saxon belief, a man's home was his castle to be defended at all costs. The County as a whole and many individual communities have the same sort of defense on their hands tomorrow. In each district the voter has figured out of backing of those who seek his voting franchise .\n\nCounty announce by their advertisements today where they are aligned. For a day, at least, the voters master the situation, not the candidates nor those whose shadow stands behind him. Hence the preliminary verdict tomorrow rests with the individual -voters in each precinct and in the home where conviction is galvanized into action. We have submitted our case according to the evidence as we see it. Our job, for the time being at least, is finished .\n\nERNEST G. SMITH (THIS ADVERTISEMENT PAID FOR BY THE LUZERNE COUNTY NON-PARTISAN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE) Here what that fearless, far seeing publisher civic leader- Col. Ernest Gray Smith--thought of Fine and his organization in 1933. Smith is a Republican, if you please, his great newspaper the Times-Leader is a Republican newspaper. Col .\n\nSmith writes not at the dictation of any one. He writes the Truth. The editorial, signed with his name in 1933, was never denied, because denial would be hooted out of court. The same set of actors, the same backdrop, the same props, are being used in this campaign, by sinister organization, as were used in 1933. Can we afford allow this organization to exist longer? READ COL .\n\nSMITH'S EDITORIAL, PRINTED HERE. (REPRINTED FROM THE TIMES-LEADER) (OF MODAY EVENING, SEPT. 18, 1933) MACHINE MOBILIZES FULL FORCE TO BEAT AROUSED CITIZENRY The primaries of 1933 wag themselves to a conclusion tomorrow as do these discussions of the local campaign based on a close-up study of potentially the most dangerous political machine which has ever threatened the independence and welfare of Luzerne County. If the type of citizenry directly associated with the Governor Pinchot-Judge Fine combination is to be seen at close range, we invite any reader of this newspaper to visit the Fine headquarters, Anthracite Building, city, plus payoff headquarters, 5th floor of the Sterling Hotel at anytime today or tomorrow. He will see what he will see and then marvel that he 'did not see it sooner .\n\nA vast majority of the county's bootleggers, machine big shots, shifty eyed dice sarks, camp followers, bottle holders, beer barons and all the rest of that ilk may come and go at these headquarters day and night. It is a sight one may never forget and yet these are to be our rulers, our captains of tens and captains of hundreds in civic affairs and public office in 1934, THAT IS, IF THEY GET AWAY WITH IT! A Real Life Picture Of Conditions Here There are of course. a small minority of clean, upright citizens who either have chosen to cast their lot with the usual machine moron or who have been inveigled into these associations ignorant or unsuspecting of what a judicially-created political machine may spawn. But the sinister, fawning type of the machine cogs is unmistakable. A correspondent has recalled quite a similar situation which existed in Lackawanna County some years ago .\n\nOn a clipping from the Scranton Times of that period he predicates his letter. If our picture of Fine head quarters is overdrawn in the slightest, how about the deft brush of Judge Leach as it out lined the canvas of Lackawanna In part from the letter of our correspondent and more vividly from the published text of 'Judge Leach's masterly description, readers may see the Fine machine image reflected in startling perspective. Both are quoted in considerable part in the following paragraphs. \"In Lackawanna County some years a go,\" reads the letter, \"there existed a situation not unlike that suffered today in Luzerne. Judge Maxey assumed the same role now held by Judge Joh nS .\n\ntine. His office in the court house was not that of a judge, rather it represented the gathering place for the clans. Lawyers seeking judicial signature to papers found It impossible to wedge through the crowd of political parasites, hangers-on and others who spent hours in and out of the premises. \"Then came the election and it became necessary to throw the spotlight on the tion. One candidate, now Judge Leach, went to the front with the pleas that it was time to divorce the judiciary from politics .\n\nLet me quote a paragraph from one of the speeches as reported in the Scranton Times at the time: Public Confidence Undermined \"'A good judge cannot be a good politician, and it necessarily follows that a good politician cannot be a good judge. No man can assume the robes, the dignity and responsibilities, under his oath, with the idea of catering to or fostering the advantage of any single person or political faction, and at the same time fulfilling the qualifications of his high calling. I care not who he may be; I care not what his training; I have less respect for his recommendations; withal, let me tell you that the judge who permits ward heelers and their ilk to make him a companion; who allows men, whose presence is disgusting to the average law abiding citizen, to clog his business hours, occupy his time and attention, does more to undermine and destroy public confidence than does the publicly branded traitor. 'The judge who caters to the mob; who plans to initiate or political machine or favorites, cannot, on the bench, give the people the brand of justice they expect. He may make high pretensions, he may paint his immunity from favoritism in classical language, but you cannot convince the man who appears either as a prosecutor or defendant, that some sinister, underground influence has not reached him .\n\nVoters do not elect men to high office of a judge to carry out political advantage; he is elected to live to the letter of the law; his oath means more than that taken by the witness on the stand. If our courts are to survive--and God grant that they may--if the Republic is to live, we must divorce the bench from politics and banish-as a blight--any one who would barter justice or -give a suspicion of so doing as we do a cancerous worm imperilling society and everything worthwhile in Citizens Will Wreek Machine Sooner or Later Deep convictions of the writer as to the exercise of power of the political machine of the type now seeking control of various hitherto independent municipalities in Luzerne County are in a measure sustained and supported by the forthright expression of Judge Leach above quoted, In Lackawanna County the Maxey machine toppled of its own weight of barnacles and sinecure There were traitors boring within and an ever increasing host disgusted and alarmed citizens without, who eventually realized the perils to government in an alliance mediated or accidental of the bench and agents of a slimy underworld. The Fine machine in Luzerne County will inevitably meet the same fate. It has been a hideous ace for vears. Driven into the open, it cannot survive .\n\nWhether Tuesday's primaries are to witness the star of the State-County organization ascendant or dimming in lustre remains to be seen. But the finger of aroused citizenship will soonor or later write finish to a combination as threatening to free institutions as this ill -omened coalition has become in Luzerne County. Independence Is Price Paid By All The cloak of charity may well be thrown about several candidates who have place in City and County on the- Fine slate. Some of such are men of character and attainment in civilian 'affairs. Beguiled and mistaken, they have allowed their names to be placed in the Fine category .\n\nThey doubtless believe that if successful in fulfilling their ambitions to become public office holders they may retain their independence.

C. Marianelli charged last night in an address covering the new Compensation Act. The attorney, former counsel for the United Mine Workers, said the old compensation law had been the workingman's last dependable refuge for more than 22 years and that group today is confused as to whether they are ever going to receive the advertised benefits of the new Workmen's Compensation Act. General alarm in this matter was sounded by workmen last week when coal companies and other employers served individual notices the law is \"hereafter not accepted\" and that employers will not pay compensation for any injuries occurring after January 1 .\n\nIn reviewing charges that the Republican Party is responsible for all the confusion in this matter, Attorney Mariahelli said the G. O. P. has never been against the principle of adequate compensation. He said, \"It was the Republican Party in Pennsylvania, which was the first among the states, in 1915, to give the workingman the protection of .\n\nthis beneficent law. Mining and other industries in the past, during Republican strations, Attorney Marianelli said, were given time to adjust themselves to increased coste in compensations, but, the attorney charges, \"the Democrats in the last Legislature did not start out with primary object of benefitting the workingman. They started out to make a political football of the Compensation Law.\" The attorney pointed out that for two years Democratic leadership has deprived workingmen of $8 increases. He explained that the Democratic House of Representatives and Governor Earle in 1935 rejected a $3 increase because they stanted of the $18. scale The raised to compensation $25 inscale is $15-a-week .\n\nPlymouth Man Stabbed; Assailant Is Sought Detectives this morning were watching a Wilkes-Barre home in connection with the stabbing of Charles Sheldon, 31, of 230 Gaylord Row, Plymouth, who was attacked last night at 11:30 the rear of Bennett's Cafe, East Market and South State Streets.
