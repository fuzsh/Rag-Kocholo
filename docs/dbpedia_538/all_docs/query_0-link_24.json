        "text": "Military Band is Next Stop for UMKC Music Alumna from Oklahoma\n\nTori Venske credits UMKC for preparing her for a future of service and leadership\n\nAt UMKC, students write their own stories, form their own definitions of success and chart innovative career paths. Tori Venske came to UMKC to further her music, and she left with newfound leadership skills to help her reach her goal of serving in a military band. Tori Venske Graduation year: May 2024 UMKC degree program: Master of Music in Clarinet Performance Hometown: Yukon, OK From the time she was in high school, Venske knew she wanted to play the clarinet in a military band. Now that she has a Master of Music degree from the UMKC Conservatory and newfound confidence in her abilities, it’s time to make her dreams come true. Why did you choose your field of study? I’ve wanted to be a musician since I was a kid. When I was 4, I wanted to be a singer/songwriter. Then I started piano and eventually played clarinet in band. I’ve known since my freshman year of high school in 2014 that I wanted to be a professional clarinetist. I’ve been working hard towards that ever since. What are the challenges of the program? With all of the performances and presentations every semester, I’ve had to push myself to be more confident. I was really nervous at first, but the faculty inspired me to think about everything in a musical sense and embrace it. Balancing everything has been hard, too. My first year here I was in both wind symphony and wind ensemble. It was great to be in band every day of the week, but at the same time trying to balance everything going on was hard at first. I got the hang of it though. What are the benefits of the program? The faculty and opportunities to perform and learn are great. I really appreciate the faculty. They’re trying to make me the best musician and person I can be. I’ve had a lot of opportunities to perform during my time here, which has been rewarding. I went through my undergraduate degree during COVID, so I missed out on a lot of traditional performances. I’ve also had a lot of opportunities to play, learn new instruments and participate in choir. Additionally, the academic resources are great. We’re encouraged to look through the Marr Sound Archives and LaBudde Special Collections to learn more about Kansas City musicians. It’s nice having those right on campus at the library. How has your college program inspired you? The faculty are really inspiring, especially professors Steve Davis and Joe Parisi. They’re just really encouraging to me and have helped me be more dedicated in everything I do. Since entering college, what have you learned about yourself? I feel like I’ve been able to face challenges better since coming here. It’s always been hard to accept when things are out of my control, even when I know that’s how life is. I’ve been able to work on that and surround myself with people that inspire and encourage me every day. Who do you admire most at UMKC? My friend, Beth Christensen, I see everything she does and how well she handles it all. She’s always doing so much, and always with grace and kindness. Just seeing her work every day is inspiring to me. How does going to school in the middle of a large city enhance your experience and education? Being in Kansas City is great. I’ve gotten to perform at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts and the Folly Theater. The opportunities to see different types of art makes me better at my craft. I love visual art. I’ve been to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and different art festivals around town. I love that so much is free to access. I like finding inspiration in things other than music. What do you hope to take from your experiences at UMKC into your professional career? I’ve learned a lot here that I’ve been able to implement. I’ve embraced my confidence and leadership skills during my time here. I want to be in a military band, and those are important qualities to have. I’ll have to audition for that, so those leadership skills are appreciated. When I decided that I want to do clarinet professionally, military band stood out to me right away. I like the interactions the musicians have with people. Military bands tour around the country and visit schools to teach masterclasses. I think it’s important to have that community engagement. I also like the repertoire they play; they play standard and new pieces. They also play pieces by underrepresented composers, which is important to me. The variety is exciting. There are a lot of military branches that have openings, I’ll audition throughout summer. If I’m accepted, I’ll have to enlist. Some of the branches also require going to basic training camp. My grandfather and great-grandfather were both in the Navy, so it would be cool to be accepted into the Navy band. Aug 07, 2024\n\nGrand Slam! UMKC Students Help Build a Robot to Throw Royals First Pitch\n\nInitiative is part of the universityâs partnership with the Kansas City Royals\n\nAntonio Sea and Denis Sumarokov were greeted with perfect ballpark weather as they stepped into Kauffman Stadium. As the sun cast a bright glow over the baseball field, the University of Missouri-Kansas City computer science students watched the middle and high school students they had been mentoring step up to the mound. The ceremonial pitch was about to start. Sumarokov and Sea had been preparing for this day for months. As part of the UMKC higher education partnership with the Kansas City Royals, they mentored local students for “Bring Out the Bots.” The Royals STEM initiative challenges middle and high school students to create a robot to throw the first pitch at the team’s annual School Day at The K. Sea and Sumarokov worked with students from WeCode KC and KC STEM Alliance to conceptualize and build the robot. They were there as students got a technical brief from the Royals, designed sketches and helped teach them coding skills with software, such as Python, to power the robot. “I’ve been helping with WeCode KC for about two years now,” Sea said. “I was in a lot of robotics programs growing up and being able to impart that knowledge back upon the community of kids is a good feeling for me.” While they were there to share their knowledge, it turns out they had some to gain too. “Those kids are really smart, so sometimes they teach you more than you teach them,” Sumarokov said. “As an electrical engineer, we have to solve a lot of problems. This experience helped not only me, but also the kids, in terms of learning how to solve problems that have not been solved before and create new ideas.” A week before game day, students had the chance to test out the robot at the MLB Urban Youth Academy. After some trial-and-error, and figuring out Wi-Fi connectivity issues, the robot successfully threw the ball over the mound. They were ready for game day. With thousands of students across the Kansas City metro in attendance for School Day at The K, the stadium was buzzing with excitement. Nervousness and anticipation filled the air as a group of students who worked on the robot had the exclusive chance to step out onto the mound. They began talking in hushed whispers as they controlled the robot on the field, before activating it to launch the first pitch. As Sluggerrr caught the ball, cheers could be heard from their teammates who watched the action from the stands. “Seeing the students’ hard work come to fruition at School Day at The K was exciting,” said Kevin Truman, Ph.D., dean of the School of Science and Engineering. “I’m glad the partnership with the Royals provided our students with mentoring opportunities that will serve as a positive impact in their future careers.” Plans are already in the works for next year’s pitching robot. Jul 30, 2024\n\nRepresenting the World: UMKC No Stranger to Olympic Excellence\n\nFormer Olympians and Paralympian include circuit judge, professional golfer\n\nSince its founding, the University of Missouri-Kansas City has always strived for excellence both in and out of the classroom. For some UMKC alumni, that push toward greatness has taken them all the way to the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Four Roos have reached that peak, representing not only the United States, but also the countries of Austria and France. “UMKC has a rich history of attracting people from across the globe,” said UMKC Chancellor Mauli Agrawal. “It is no surprise these Roos found success not only in the classroom, but also on their respective field of play.” Courtney Frerichs (B.A. ’15), 2016 Rio Olympics and 2020 Tokyo Olympics Olympic silver medalist and UMKC alumna Courtney Frerichs raced to a silver medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in the 3000-meter steeplechase. After the 2020 Olympics, she reset her American record in the event, becoming the first American woman to break the nine-minute barrier. During her athletic career at UMKC, the native of Nixa, Missouri, was an 11-time conference champion, five-time All-American and set seven school records. Frerichs intended to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics but announced in May that she had undergone surgery to repair a torn ACL and meniscus in her right knee. Her intention is to heal and return to the track, saying on social media, “I hold hope that I will be back out there again as a healthier and stronger version of myself.” Frerichs is married to fellow alum, Griffin Humphreys (B.B.A. ’16), who currently serves as an assistant cross country coach at Portland State University. Antoine Rozner (B.B.A. ’16), 2020 Tokyo Olympics French professional golfer and UMKC alumnus Antoine Rozner attended UMKC from 2012 to 2016, notching six wins as a Roo. He played in the 2016 NCAA Division 1 Men’s Golf Championship where he tied for 8th place, and was also named Western Conference Player of the Year. The Paris, France native turned professional the year he graduated and played for Europe in the 2016 Arnold Palmer Cup, winning all four of his matches. “I didn’t know what to expect coming from Paris,” said Rozner. \"UMKC was a lovely four years, and I’d do it again.” Fast forward four years, Rozner earned a spot representing his home country in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, which were held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rozner placed 45th in individual competition. Currently Rozner plays on the European Tour and has three tour wins, including the 2022 AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open. Viola Kleiser (B.A. ’12), 2014 Sochi Olympics Former UMKC sprinter Viola Kleiser made history when she represented her home country of Austria in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Kleiser and her teammate were the first women to qualify in bobsleigh for the Olympic Games in Austrian history. Yes, despite being a track and field student-athlete at UMKC, Kleiser competed at the Olympics in an entirely different sport. During her time as a Roo, the Reichersdorf, Austria native set a then-school record in the 200-meter dash at the 2012 Summit League Indoor Championships with a time of 25.17. Upon leaving UMKC, Kleiser began speed and strength training back home. Just a week later, the Austrian National bobsleigh team asked her to try out. She made the team as a lead pusher, later competing at the 2013 Bobsleigh World Cup and then the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where she finished 15th. Kleiser currently serves as a coach for the Austrian Athletics Federation. The Hon. Sarah Castle (J.D. ’12), 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 Paralympics Castle is a four-time Paralympian, competing and earning medals in both swimming and basketball. During her first games in 2000, Castle claimed the silver medal while competing in the breaststroke. She would finish fourth in the same event four years later, before switching sports for the 2008 and 2012 games. As a member of the paralympic basketball team, Castle earned a gold medal at the 2008 games and finished fourth in 2012. Castle’s success at UMKC is now reflected in the courtroom. Graduating with her law degree in 2012, she then went on to work in the U.S. Attorney’s office before serving Jackson County, Missouri as an assistant prosecuting attorney. In January 2020, Castle was appointed as an associate circuit judge by Missouri Governor Mike Parson. Later that same year, she was appointed as circuit judge of division 1 in Jackson County. Jul 26, 2024\n\nFirst-Gen Student Finds Family and Comfort at UMKC\n\nMyles Hardy is making more connections than ever at their second home\n\nAt UMKC, students write their own stories, form their own definitions of success and chart innovative career paths. Myles Hardy is a psychology major who is finding their home away from home by participating in organizations including First Gen Roos and Professional Career Escalators. Myles HardyAnticipated graduation year: 2027UMKC degree program: PsychologyHometown: Springfield, MissouriHardy has always looked for connections outside the box. After picking UMKC and arriving on campus, they realized they made the right choice. Hardy said UMKC allowed them to express themselves like they haven’t before and find new communities with opportunities around the corner. Why did you choose UMKC? I knew that staying around my hometown wasn’t for me as there wasn’t much of a community there. People there aren’t as open-minded and tend to follow the same kind of career track. If their dad was a doctor, then that’s what they would do. I just wanted to go somewhere else and start new. Why did you pick psychology as your field? I knew I wanted to help people. I thought about being a doctor, but I didn’t think I would work well with medical materials. I am very interested in the way people think and how different events in life can affect the way we think, how we are different and the way we interact with each other. What do you like the most about UMKC? The people I’ve met genuinely want me to succeed. They want to prep us for our future, and don’t give up. It’s more than just my professors, the success coaches and program organizers at UMKC are always there for you. It’s very motivating. How is UMKC preparing you for a career that you want? UMKC as a whole, especially in the psychology department, has so many connections that you can find. Whether it’s through professors, program organizers or even campus career events, there are a lot of outlets for bigger career opportunities. Do you plan on pursuing a graduate degree? Yes, I do. I would love to do it at UMKC. How does it feel being a first-gen student at UMKC? Before I got here, I was extremely stressed. It was a lot of pressure. But through the First Gen Roo program, they did a great job of comforting me without making me feel like I had to fit in a certain way or live up to specific expectations. I also noticed that other universities don't really talk about first-generation students or really give them an opportunity to feel not only welcomed, but celebrated. That’s a big thing the First Gen Roo program does very well. In addition to First Gen Roo, I’m in the Honors Program, Professional Career Escalators and I’m involved in the Peer Academic Leadership (PAL) program as well, prepping to be a pal next year. I’m also involved with the Neurodivergent Student Union and UMKC Trans+. What have you learned about yourself since being at UMKC? My strengths. I would say I've definitely blossomed since coming to UMKC. I was a very introverted person when I was in Springfield and in high school. I didn't like what I was doing at all. I wasn’t having fun. But being here, I feel that I have a track. I'm doing things, I'm involved and I’m interacting with people I truly connect with. It has really helped me grow in many areas. Would you recommend UMKC to prospective students? Yes, I would. I would recommend it because I don’t think you can find this kind of joy and family feeling anywhere else at other universities. I think that's what makes UMKC so special. What’s your favorite place to study on campus? I really like the library when it’s cold. But now that it's warmer, I like the Quad more. I'm really glad they have the lounge chairs out there too. It’s super chill and perfect with the shade. What is something you wished more people would know about UMKC? I wish people knew more about the family feel of UMKC. I think that's hard to see from an outside perspective. If you're just looking in, you don’t get to feel it. But there is such a strong emphasis on community, and you will find your group of people at some point. What is something you are looking forward to? Becoming a leader. I always want to take on more opportunities, even though I already have a full schedule as is. But next year, I'm going to be in the PAL program and I'm really excited for it. I want to talk and help people. I think that is something that's really important, not only as a first-gen student, but as a UMKC student. Nobody is going to be exactly like you or be on the same exact track. Everyone is different and special in that aspect. There are many ways to be a leader but doing it your own way is something to be really proud of. Jul 25, 2024\n\n2024 Pride Luncheon Features Two Former Kansas City Mayors\n\nKay Barnes will be honored, Sly James is honorary co-chair\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City will honor former Kansas City Mayor and UMKC alumna Kay Barnes with the C. Stephen Metzler Pride Champion Award at the UMKC Pride Luncheon. Last year was the inaugural year for the award, presented to Donald J. Hall Jr., executive chairman of Hallmark Cards board of directors. Barnes (M.A. '71, MPA '78) is Kansas City’s former mayor, serving from 1999 to 2007. She was one of two women in the Jackson County Legislature in 1974 and is the first – and so far, only – woman elected as mayor of Kansas City. Barnes is most known for spearheading the revitalization of downtown Kansas City through the construction of the T-Mobile (formerly Sprint) Center, the H&R Block headquarters and the Power and Light District. The award recognizes an individual (LGBTQIA+ or ally) who embodies the legacy of Metzler (MBA ’76), who made Kansas City a better place for the LGBTQIA+ community through volunteerism, philanthropy and leading by example. Barnes was a fierce ally of the community, regardless of the political and business risks, when she was a county legislator, city council member, mayor and U.S. Congressional candidate. As a trailblazer, Barnes is also a UMKC Starr Women’s Hall of Fame inductee. Her out-of-the-box thinking, assertiveness and devotion to public service led her to being nominated in 2014 and inducted in 2015. Barnes is senior director of university engagement at Park University. “Kay Barnes is an inspirational figure in Kansas City, and we are excited to honor her with the C. Stephen Metzler Pride Champion Award,” said UMKC Chancellor Mauli Agrawal. “Her determination to strive for equality, inclusivity and justice while elevating the city amazes all of us. We are glad she is deeply connected to UMKC and our community.”This year, another former Kansas City mayor also will be closely involved with the Pride Luncheon. Former Mayor Sly James, who served from 2011 to 2019, is an honorary co-chair along with his business partner and former chief of staff Joni Wickham of Wickham James Strategies & Solutions.The event co-chairs are Casey Simmons and S. Sloane Simmons who own A Store Named Stuff in Brookside, and Jonathan Gregory, UnitedHealth Group, and Eric Thomas, Zurich Insurance. The 2024 Pride Luncheon is 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Oct. 1 at the UMKC Swinney Center. This annual signature event, formerly a breakfast, became a luncheon this year. Visit umkc.edu/pride for ticket and sponsorship information.The Pride Luncheon raises funds to support LGBTQIA+ students, allies, programs and scholarships. It has raised more than $650,000 since 2015, showing the university’s continuous support and commitment to inclusivity on campus. Jul 25, 2024\n\nUMKC, MU Will Lead U.S. National Science Foundation Research Protection Effort in Midwest\n\nInvestment aimed at safeguarding the U.S. research enterprise\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City and University of Missouri will lead one of five regional centers for a new research security effort sponsored by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act through the National Science Foundation. The NSF announced a five-year, $67 million investment establishing the Safeguarding the Entire Community of the U.S. Research Ecosystem (SECURE) Center. Funding includes $5 million over five years for UMKC and MU to establish and run the SECURE Midwest regional center. With support from nine institutions of higher education nationwide, including UMKC and MU, the SECURE Center aims to serve the research community to recognize and address threats to the U.S. research enterprise, such as interference and unethical or unlawful access by a foreign entity. Michele Kennett, MU associate vice chancellor for research compliance and integrity, and Anthony Caruso, UMKC interim vice chancellor for research, will lead the SECURE Midwest center. “Research security is not common, unnecessarily complex, expensive to staff and yet essential – we are helping to make research security challenges understandable, manageable, affordable and effective,” Caruso said. “We are humbled and honored to connect to the Midwest universities.” “We are excited to be part of an initiative that will engage university leadership, compliance officials, individual researchers and private organizations across the U.S. research community,” Kennett said. “This engagement will assure that the research community is integral in the process to arrive at security solutions that protect the national research enterprise.” The national SECURE Center will share information and reports from the regional centers on topics such as research security risks. It will also provide training on research security to the science and engineering community, and serve as a bridge between the research community and government funding agencies to strengthen cooperation on addressing security concerns. “The SECURE Center is how we bring the research community together to identify risks, share information and leverage national expertise on research security to develop solutions that protect essential research being done at institutions across the nation,” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. Jul 24, 2024\n\nUMKC School of Dentistry Partnership with GEHA Solutions Receives STEM Award\n\nPowerhouse partnership has provided $590,000 to future oral healthcare practitioners\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry and GEHA Solutions this month received the 2024 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award from Insight Into Diversity magazine, the largest and oldest diversity and inclusion publication in higher education. The award honors colleges and universities that encourage and assist students from a broad spectrum of diverse backgrounds to enter the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). According to Dean Steven Haas, D.M.D, J.D., MBA, the school is grateful for the acknowledgement of their efforts to broaden the pathway into oral health careers. “There is an immense benefit as a patient to receiving care from dental providers who understand and resonate with their background,” Haas said. “This recognition is a testament to the dedication of the School of Dentistry community and our invaluable partners, such as GEHA Solutions, who exemplify impactful community engagement. We hope this inspires others to participate in similar initiatives.” The oral health equity partnership between the Lee’s Summit, Missouri,-based GEHA Solutions and the UMKC School of Dentistry began in 2022 with the company’s investment of $150,000. Over the course of the three-year partnership, GEHA Solutions has provided $590,000 to the school to support disadvantaged students who have a commitment to oral health equity, especially among dentally underserved communities. The funds established 15 annual fellowships that provide stipends for students participating in the UMKC pathway program, Students Training in Academia, Health and Research (STAHR) Scholars Program. Since 2022, the funds have provided financial support, enabling recipients to focus on test prep and enhancement of their qualifications as dental school applicants. The partnership also established 14 one-time scholarships to support and help attract incoming dental hygiene and dental students. STAHR Scholars is an innovative summer program intended to develop competitive health professions applicants. Established in 2018, the program is a collaboration between the UMKC schools of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy designed to increase representation in healthcare fields from a broad spectrum of backgrounds. Jenna Mills, vice president at GEHA Solutions, has seen first-hand how the guidance, support and mentorship the STAHR program provides these students, setting them up to reach their full potential. “I’ve had the great pleasure to meet STAHR fellows as well as dental and dental hygiene students, learning of their backgrounds and the obstacles they have overcome to be ready to enter and succeed in dental school,” Mills said. “To say I am impressed is an understatement. Our oral health delivery system will benefit from having such a talented and diverse group of individuals in the coming years.” This is the second time the UMKC School of Dentistry was recognized by Insight Into Diversity magazine, having received the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity award for health professions schools in 2016. The UMKC School of Medicine, a participating partner in the STAHR program, received the same award in 2022 and 2023. UMKC received the award in 2019. According to Lenore Pearlstein, owner and publisher of Insight Into Diversity magazine, many STEM programs are not always recognized for their dedication to encouraging students from a broad spectrum of backgrounds to pursue these fields. “We want to honor the schools and organizations that have created programs that inspire and encourage young people who may currently be in or are interested in a future career in STEM,” Pearlstein said. “We are proud to honor these programs as role models to other institutions of higher education and beyond.” Jul 23, 2024\n\nUMKC School of Medicine Receives High National Rankings From U.S. News & World Report\n\nContinued recognition as a leader in medical education\n\nU.S. News & World Report announced its 2024 Best Graduate Schools for Medicine and ranked the UMKC School of Medicine as a leader in two categories. The school was ranked No. 20 in the nation in “Serving Medically Needy Areas” and No. 75 in “Most Diverse Medical Schools.” Dean Alexander Norbash (B.A. ’85/M.D. ’86) has been a champion of rural healthcare and diversity since he was a student. “UMKC School of Medicine has been committed to serving the underserved from the moment of its inception,” Norbash said. “We have remained true to our community and are grateful and proud of this recognition. We look to the future with anticipation and optimism as we seek to further better the health and wellbeing of our expanded community, with a special focus on medically needy areas, the dispossessed and the underprivileged, whether urban or rural.” With campuses in Kansas City and St. Joseph, Missouri, the School of Medicine is uniquely situated to prepare the next generation of medical professionals to provide both urban and rural care to the areas that need it most. On the Kansas City campus, School of Medicine students and faculty participate in the Our Healthy Jackson County initiative, which brings free vaccinations and health screenings to communities that need it. The initiative began during the pandemic to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in vulnerable areas, and has since expanded to provide mental health, dental and other health screenings alongside vaccinations. The commitment to serving medically needy areas also is being realized with the construction of a new education center on the St. Joseph, Missouri, campus. The $14.5 million building is expected to open in 2025 and will aim to help address the physician shortage in Missouri and give students and faculty a space to focus on rural healthcare and communities in need. Research suggests that medical students who have training in rural areas during residency are more likely to pursue careers in rural medicine. This is not the first time the school has been recognized for leadership in education people with a variety of backgrounds and experiences. In 2023, the school received the Health Professionals Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine for the second year in a row. The School of Medicine also earned the award in 2018. The school promotes a culture of inclusion and the ability to effectively deliver healthcare in diverse communities, and its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion works to prepare students for the workplace. Students participate in an anti-racism and cultural bias program before going into clinical rotations, helping to ensure that they are providing excellent care from day one. Other initiatives, including specialized care for students at academic risk, the Multicultural Advisory Committee of Students, LGBTQIA+ resources and the Summer Success Seminar Series all help students achieve their full potential and prepare them for a career of caring for all. The full rankings and report can be found here.

The elevator shaft and some piping work has also been completed. This project is on schedule to open in June 2025. Foodiverse (7/26) Construction at Student Union started in June with clearing space. The dining hall at Atterbury will remain open in the Fall 2024 semester, as well as the Starbucks in Student Union. When the Foodiverse opens in January 2025, Atterbury dining services will be closed for renovations to create a new expanded student welcome center at Atterbury. Miller Nichols Library Renovation (7/26) The fourth floor of Miller Nichols Library, formerly the silent study floor, is currently closed. The second floor of the library is now the silent study floor; this change is permanent. For the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters, UMKC Tutoring will be available in person in Atterbury Student Success Center, Room 236. In Fall 2025, the renovated fourth floor will offer open study spaces for all students, study and meeting rooms and laptop stations. Student-success programs such as Supplemental Instruction, UMKC Tutoring, UMKC PALs (Peer Academic Leadership program) and First Gen Roo will gain areas to meet with the students in their programs and updated classroom space. Jul 17, 2024\n\nSound Mandala Introduces New Way To Be Immersed in Audio\n\nA true surround sound system, dozens of speakers line the walls for a unique listening experience\n\nWhen you walk into the Sound Mandala in the black box theatre, you’re greeted by speakers on all sides. The lights will dim, and you’ll hear music and audio like never before. “When you listen to a recorded track, the sounds have been mixed already and you’re hearing it all come out of one console,” said Tom Mardikes, professor of sound design at the UMKC Conservatory. “I wanted to know how a song would sound if it was mixed in the air, as you listen to it.” Mardikes is the creator of the Sound Mandala. Inspired by intricately crafted sand mandalas, Mardikes wanted to apply that precision and artistry to sound. He created a system to place individual sounds of a track on different speakers and move those sounds throughout the duration of the track. Much like movies are moving images, the Sound Mandala is moving audio. Mardikes has been working on the Sound Mandala since 2014. Graduate students in sound design at UMKC have been involved in the process, including his core Sound Mandala team of current and former students. Mardikes holds a patent for the system and foresees its use in theatres, auditoriums and even haunted houses in the future. Photo by Luke Harbur The Sound Mandala has progressed to more than 80 speakers in the black box theatre in Olson Performing Arts Center. Mardikes’s team outfitted the theatre to ensure the best audio experience possible to showcase their creation. The intimate venue holds 40 people, ensuring that every seat is the best seat in the house. “You can hear sounds moving around the room,” Mardikes said. “You might hear a guitar coming from in front of you, a voice behind you and a piano next to you. You’re truly immersed in the sound, it’s an entirely unique experience that’s never been possible before.” Experience a taste of the Sound Mandala. Headphones are required for listening. The Sound Mandala debuts to the public at the 2024 Kansas City Fringe Festival. Sound Mandala shows are July 19-27 at the Black Box Theatre at Olson Performing Arts Center on the UMKC campus. Jul 15, 2024\n\nUMKC Releases 2024 Spring Deanâs List\n\nNearly 2,000 students recognized\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City celebrates the time and energy it takes for excellence: Commitment, integrity and tenacity are required each semester. During the Spring 2024 semester, 1,899 of our undergraduate and professional students made the UMKC Dean’s List. This is an impressive academic honor. Students must complete a minimum full-time program of 12 graded hours and meet their individual unit’s GPA threshold to qualify for the Dean’s List. These students showed what it meant to take pride in their academic success.

Jul 11, 2024\n\nSt. Louis Native Finds Community and Purpose in Pharmacy at UMKC\n\nSavannah Jenkins is seeking doctoral and master's degrees simultaneously\n\nAt UMKC, students write their own stories, form their own definitions of success and chart innovative career paths. Savannah Jenkins, a St. Louis native, came to UMKC to become a pharmacist and found community, leadership opportunities and a program with unwavering commitment to student success. Savannah JenkinsHometown: St. Louis, MissouriGraduating Year: 2025Degree Program: Pharm.D. and MBAUndergrad: St. Charles Community College, UMSL Why did you choose UMKC? I chose UMKC for several reasons. My fiancé got accepted into the dental school right across the street. I also felt like the School of Pharmacy program’s values aligned with mine with their community outreach, their emphasis on professionalism and innovation. The community I saw in my interview reeled me in. Our professors care about each of us, and there is a lot to get involved with! Why did you choose pharmacy? I used to play doctor with my mom as a kid, so I knew I wanted to do health care, but I didn’t know what I wanted to do. My dad has a pharmacist friend, and initially I thought pharmacy was just standing behind the counter and looking at pills all day. I didn’t realize that there were a ton of job avenues within pharmacy. That flexibility and the different opportunities within pharmacy really spoke to me. Do you know what avenue you want to take within pharmacy? There are so many that it’s hard for me to try and narrow them down, but I think I’ve got it down to two. Ambulatory care or industry work in sales, research or development. I’m also getting my MBA with my Pharm.D. through the Henry W. Bloch School of Management. UMKC offers that unique opportunity to their pharmacy students, which is great. I take my MBA classes online so I’ll graduate with both degrees at the same time. The MBA will give me more opportunities within pharmacy down the line. What has been inspiring to you about pharmacy? I’ve been inspired through my peers and seeing their own experiences in pharmacy. Also, when you go through your rotations and get the chance to apply what you’re learning in the classroom out in the real world and interact with patients, you see that what you’re learning will impact people as a pharmacist. I can look down the road and say, ‘that is going to be me someday!’ What have you learned about yourself at UMKC? Time management. Planning and initiating good time management practices into my daily routine has been important. I try to have three big goals for each day. I have a couple of school goals and one personal goal. Who at UMKC do you admire most? One of my best friends in my program, Ayatt Muslet, is a single mom who is balancing motherhood with schoolwork and several different jobs. She’s doing all this pharmacy work and has four kids to take care of. At the end of a long day, when I’m tired, I know that if she can do it, so can I. She’s really a rock star. What extracurricular activities are you involved in? Last year, I was on the executive board of APHA (American Public Health Association). This year, I’m the president of PHL, or Public Health Organization. I also do research with Our Healthy Jackson County . I get to go out into the community at least twice a month and work with my peers in dental, nursing and medical school. As pharmacy students specifically, we provide free vaccinations and mental health screenings. We are able to refer a patient to additional resources if their screening shows that they need additional mental health support. I feel like I’m really making a difference. What do you hope to take from your experiences at UMKC into your professional career? The professionalism that UMKC instills in their students. They set us up well to communicate effectively with patients and other health-care providers, and they help establish confidence. Confidence, communication, professionalism and problem-solving are all skills I hope to take with me. What is one word that best describes you? Persistent. I had to be persistent about wanting to get where I am. I did community college and wasn’t sure what I wanted to do yet. Then, I got my B.S. and knew I wanted to go into health care, but it was between dentistry and pharmacy. Then I took a gap year and was really working on making myself competitive. I finally made it here, and persistence was the key. At any point, I could have said, “this is a lot of school and I think I’m done.” Most used social media channel? Pinterest. It feels much more relaxing than other social media platforms. What’s your favorite place to eat in Kansas City? Brickhouse Where’s your favorite spot to hang out in Kansas City? I don’t get to hang out a lot but when I do go out, I like the Power and Light District. I spend most of my time at home or at school studying. I also like all the different cafes in Kansas City. How is Kansas City different than St. Louis? It's my first time getting a real feel for downtown city life. There's so much to do just a few minutes away, whether it's catching a game, hitting up some cool bars or exploring local parks. Back home is great too, but it's really nice to switch things up and enjoy the new scenery here. Every day brings something new and exciting! Jul 11, 2024\n\nUMKC Bloch School, Top Kansas City Banks Announce New Scholarship Opportunity\n\nPartnership includes $10,000 scholarship award per student\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City Henry W. Bloch School of Management is partnering with five top Kansas City banks to announce a new scholarship program. Banking Leaders of Tomorrow is designed to inspire future professionals to make a difference in their communities as leaders in the banking and finance industries. Available to incoming students from Missouri or Kansas, this scholarship totals $10,000 over four years for incoming freshmen who express interest in pursuing careers in banking and finance. To provide continued support during their education, accepted students will also receive both academic and professional mentoring as well as networking opportunities. This scholarship is made possible through generous support and close partnerships with area banks who have committed to supporting students in and out of the traditional classroom through lectures, site visits and panel discussions. They have also committed to providing internship opportunities, ensuring real-world experience throughout these students' time at UMKC. Academy Bank Arvest Foundation Commerce Bank Lead Bank UMB Bank “Banking Leaders of Tomorrow is much more than a scholarship and we could not launch this program without great partners,” said Jocelyn Evans, associate dean of the Bloch School. “These banks are not only committing their time here on campus, but they are also providing important opportunities for our students to explore their future in banking and finance.” Scholarships will be awarded based upon a student’s essay describing their interest in a financial services career and how their experiences have prepared them to engage in banking relationships with individuals and businesses in low- and moderate-income areas in the Kansas City metropolitan area where many residents do not have traditional banking relationships. “The Bloch School is committed to educating students who will improve the communities where they will one day live,” said Bloch School Dean Brian Klaas. “Banking Leaders of Tomorrow furthers that commitment, and we’re grateful to our partner banks for making this possible.” Jul 10, 2024\n\nUMKC School of Pharmacy Receives National Community Pharmacy Center of Excellence Recognition\n\nOne of 17 schools in the nation to receive the inaugural award\n\nThe American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy recognizes pharmacy programs committed to providing community pharmacy services in a transformational way and has designated the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Pharmacy a Community Pharmacy Center of Excellence. The designation recognizes the significant commitment the school has made to advancement in teaching, service, scholarship, leadership and partnerships. The school is one of 17 schools to receive the award. Faculty members Kendall Guthrie (Pharm.D. ‘13), Sarah Oprinovich, Pharm.D., and Heather Lyons-Burney (Pharm.D. ‘94), applied for the award, with help from Mark Sawkin, Pharm.D., Mark Patterson, Ph.D., M.P.H. and Yifei Liu, Ph.D. Alongside the other schools, the UMKC School of Pharmacy will serve as an ambassador for the discipline, and will have unique opportunities to share its knowledge and help other programs develop community-oriented care. “We will be used as a model for other institutions that would like to incorporate more community pharmacy education into their curriculum,” Oprinovich said. “We will also be in closer contact with other Centers of Excellence, so we can all share practices that will improve our students’ readiness for practicing in contemporary community .” Dean Russ Melchert, Ph.D., noted the accomplishment’s importance. “We are very excited and honored to receive the prestigious Center of Excellence designation by AACP for our faculty’s innovative work in advancing community pharmacy practice,” Melchert said. “Pharmacists have been among the most accessible health-care providers, with estimates suggesting that over 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a community pharmacy. We are happy to be recognized nationally as a school with expertise in producing outstanding, innovative and entrepreneurial community pharmacy practitioners.\" As a Center of Excellence, the UMKC School of Pharmacy now sets its sights on advancing community pharmacy practice for everyone, and on continued training of the caregivers of tomorrow. According to Oprinovich, many people realize that their community pharmacy is where they can get vaccines, testing for minor acute illnesses, monitor blood pressure and more. “We have multiple faculty who are given the time and space to serve professional organizations, innovate, and research,” Oprinovich said. “Our experiential education leaders also place high value on training students to be well-prepared for the rapid change that is happening in community pharmacy today.” The School of Pharmacy will hold this designation for the next five years, after which it will be invited to reapply. Jul 09, 2024\n\nBig Data Is Big Time\n\nNew center provides opportunities to use multimodal data to solve community problems and develop a critical workforce in Missouri and Midwest.\n\nShu-Ching Chen, Ph.D., has always known big data would be the wave of the future. Chen is the inaugural executive director of the Data Science and Analytics Innovation Center (dSAIC) at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, a position he took to continue his research into multimodal big data analytics. By harnessing immense datasets to extract insights, patterns and knowledge, dSAIC provides the foundation for transformational research. Multimodal big data analytics combines techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and more to analyze data from different sources and apply them to solve fundamental and real-world problems. “Companies need to analyze data to benefit business,” Chen said. “If you don’t take advantage, you fall behind.” At dSAIC, Chen and his team are working to create tools to help students, companies and stakeholders seamlessly bring together different kinds of data points as quickly as possible to allow for easier analysis and integration. During his 21 years at Florida International University in Miami, Chen’s research into multimodal big data analytics earned funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Homeland Security, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, Army Research Office, Naval Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, Florida Department of Transportation, IBM and Microsoft. His research was also used to help emergency management in several aspects of post-hurricane recovery efforts, like insurance approvals and damage analysis. Chen plans to continue that work in Kansas City, collaborating with emergency management in other natural disaster- related recoveries, as well as continue to develop tools that can make an impact in all industries and communities across the state. \"Companies need to analyze data to benefit business. If you don’t take advantage, you fall behind.\" — Shu-Ching Chen, Ph.D. Now, with Chen as the leader of dSAIC, the center will support university research across Missouri and will play a critical role in workforce development across Kansas City and the region. He also hopes to continue developing models and projects that can be easily recognized by the general public. In his short time as executive director, the center has been awarded grants, including from the U.S. Department of Education Center of Excellence in Spatial Computing, bringing in more than $1 million in funding. In Chen’s eyes, dSAIC has the potential to be a prestigious hub for multimodal data science due to Kansas City’s continued growth and potential. He hopes to bring together stakeholders and community leaders to identify the need, identify potential projects and identify the impact, helping make it the best data science center in the country. Kansas City’s central location, growing potential and opportunities make it an ideal place for students to learn and apply multimodal research into the community, as well as making an impact on surrounding states in the region. Chen sees the center as a place where graduates will learn the necessary skills and stand out when applying for jobs in the Kansas City area, the region, across the country and around the world. In an industry where technology is evolving quickly, the center will allow students to develop the skills necessary to keep up with the challenges and changes. The Data Science and Analytics Innovation Center will also be a place for alumni to return to campus and share experience from real-world applications, giving students a unique learning experience. But it doesn’t stop at data science. Chen believes students from all disciplines and academic units can benefit from studying multimodal data analytics at dSAIC and meet the demand for high-quality employees from top companies. Data is at the heart of artificial intelligence and machine learning, like the popular ChatGPT, which has seen several applications that go beyond simple search inquiries. With a center like the dSAIC, Chen sees possibilities at the forefront of the next generation of data science technologies. Jul 02, 2024\n\nJournalism and Media Students Hit It Out of the Park with KC Royals\n\nUMKC studentsâ work will be featured on the iconic Crown Vision screen at Kauffman Stadium\n\nStudents studying journalism and film and media arts got a grand slam of an opportunity with Pine Tar Collective, the in-house marketing agency for the Kansas City Royals. The collaborative effort led to a promotional commercial for the University of Missouri-Kansas City partnership with the Royals on Kauffman Stadium Crown Vision, the almost 9,000-square-foot screen above the outfield. “It was an extraordinarily unique opportunity to have a chance to go out to Kauffman Stadium and really experience what life at The K is all about,” said Steve Kraske, teaching professor of journalism. “To work with professionals who really know what they're doing, have a very clear idea of how to film this project and get it in the can. It was a great experience for our students to have that opportunity.” Cristian Martinez, a journalism and film and media arts major, was one student who saw the whole project from concept to screen. “To work with the Royals on this project was amazing,” Martinez said. “It felt like a dream come true. UMKC, whether it be equipment or the professors themselves, has really prepared us for this moment to be on a set with the Royals. It made us felt comfortable. It made us feel like that we were able to really translate what was what we learned in the classroom to a professional set.” Students got the MVP tour of Kauffman and Pine Tar workspaces. They met again later where the students were able to pitch concepts to the production team and finalize a plan. After two days of shooting, where students got to be hands-on behind and in front of the camera, Pine Tar edited the final video that premiered at UMKC Night at The K. It will air during every Friday home game of the remaining Royals season. “All of us we were able to attend and watch our commercial up there,” Martinez said. “The Royals showed us on Crown Vision, which is crazy because I always wanted to be up there. They showcased all of us and it was awesome.” The prime location and partnerships of UMKC allow for these amazing opportunities that students get to advance their career before they even enter the workforce. “I think coming to KC, this is what it's all about,” Martinez said. “I think some people like to tell themselves, ‘I want to go to Chicago. I want to go to New York. I want to go to LA,’ when in reality, Kansas City is the place to be. You get so many opportunities, like the chance to work hands-on early in your dream career.” Jun 28, 2024\n\nMedical Student with a Passion for Public Health Honored with Remington R. Williams Award\n\nAward recognizes University of Missouri System students for character and collaborative spirit\n\nRithika Ginjupalli, a six-year B.A./M.D. student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, has made her mark at the intersection of medicine and public health. Ginjupalli, originally from India and raised in Colorado, found her love for orthopedic surgery and community public health at UMKC. Ginjupalli was honored on June 27 at the University of Missouri Board of Curators meeting as this year’s UMKC recipient of the Remington R. Williams Award, which celebrates the life and legacy of late UMKC alumnus Remington Williams (J.D. ’22), who died in a car crash in 2022. In UMKC Chancellor Mauli Agrawal’s nomination letter, he wrote: “Rithika consistently demonstrates integrity, respect, compassion and empathy in all her interactions. Beyond her academic achievements, she works collaboratively to build and foster environments of empathy and inclusion wherever she goes.” As a medical student, Ginjupalli has noticed a lack of crossover opportunities for two of her biggest interests: public health and medicine. In addition to her academic duties, she has leaned into public health organizations as much as her schedule allows. With involvement in organizations such as the American Medical Association and the American Cancer Society, she works to effect systematic changes in public health from a medical perspective. She is currently the American Cancer Society’s congressional district lead, collaborating with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver to develop policies. She also is heavily involved with medical research projects that focus on improving health outcomes through community-based participatory research. “Each community is different, and that is part of the challenge when approaching systemic issues,” she said. “Community-based participatory research lets you tailor the interventions to each specific community rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.” In this work, Ginjupalli found her niche in projects that aim to increase health literacy. “There’s a big gap in health literacy for patients and for a lot of the community members we were seeing,” she said. “It’s an issue that’s everywhere.” “Rithika has created opportunities for her fellow classmates to learn and participate in these advocacy spaces,” said UMKC Associate Professor Trung Pham, M.D., in his nomination letter for Ginjupalli. “Rithika is an exceptional and diligent student, consistently demonstrating her commitment to academic excellence.” In 2023 alone, Ginjupalli was given the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Award by the Association of Women Surgeons and Association of Out Surgeons and Allies, the Community Champion Award and the Award for Excellence in Diversity and Health Equity and the Ida Bamberger Memorial Research Award by the UMKC School of Medicine. Her celebrated achievements haven’t stopped her from dreaming up more ways to make an even bigger impact. Receiving the Remington R. Williams Award is “just a sign that I’m doing something right and to continue what I’m doing,” she said. “We don’t do this work for the recognition of it. But recognizing public health work is important because it motivates others to enter this space too.” Next up for Ginjupalli is a temporary move to Baltimore, Maryland. She will spend the next year at Johns Hopkins, earning an accelerated Master of Public Health degree before her sixth and final year at UMKC in 2025. The Remington R. Williams Award is the highest non-academic honor that a student can receive from the Board of Curators. In addition to being a UMKC alumnus, Williams was the student representative to the University of Missouri Board of Curators (2020-2022), and this award is given to students who embody his legacy of high academic achievement, natural leadership and exceptional care to others. Recipients are selected annually and will receive a leadership medal to wear at commencement, a $1,000 award and an invitation to be recognized at a Board of Curators meeting. Jun 27, 2024\n\nEducation Major Selected Among Best in Missouri for Prestigious Award\n\nGenesis Ventura Amaro is on track to become an educator who changes lives\n\nRecent University of Missouri-Kansas City alumna Genesis Ventura Amaro is an Institute for Urban Education (IUE) scholar who is committed to teaching at historically underserved schools. She received the Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award before she graduated, making her one out of only 13 recipients in Missouri. The Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award is a recent establishment from the Missouri branch of the Milken Educator Awards program to celebrate and encourage pre-service teachers enrolled in Missouri’s public Educator Preparation Programs. This year, one Kansas City area student teacher had the honor of receiving this award. Amaro decided to become an educator after she immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic six years ago. Amaro attended UMKC to study early childhood education and was an IUE scholar. This means that Amaro received additional training focused on teaching in urban schools and received a scholarship to support her while becoming a teacher; as an IUE scholar Amaro is committed to teaching in Kansas City’s urban schools for four years after graduation. “I loved being a Roo and I am sad that my time at UMKC is over,” she said. “I really valued how much people wanted me to succeed at UMKC. Being a part of the IUE has allowed me to bring in a different, more responsive perspective to the spaces I find myself in. Discussions with my peers, the school I teach at in urban KC and even anybody who would let me talk about the importance of culturally responsive teaching and restorative practices. All of this I have learned through the IUE seminars.” Amaro’s professor and mentor Jennifer Fergerson nominated her for the Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award. “Gen has been a really strong student teacher and has thrived as an educator since she began,” Fergerson said. “She truly embodies what an educator is, and it shows in the classroom. It’s really easy to forget that she is student teaching, since she develops skills so quickly and teaches as someone with much more experience than she actually has.” It was no surprise to Fergerson when Amaro was named as a recipient. “I was really proud of her when she won,” Fergerson said. “Especially because right before I found out, Gen was having a conversation with me about how much she loves what she does. It was just so fitting. She truly deserves this recognition.” However, it was a big surprise to Amaro since she didn’t even know she was nominated. “I feel so honored to be a recipient of the award,” Amaro said. “As a student teacher, my focus has always been on what I could do better, so noticing what I am doing well can be challenging at times. It is very rewarding to know that my hard work is being noticed and acknowledged by others as well.” Amaro completed her student teaching as part of a year-long internship at the Academy for Integrated Arts charter school (AFIA), which is also where she was presented with the surprise award.The Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award recipients not only get an exclusive network of highly regarded fellow educators, but will also be actively supported during their first year in the classroom. Each recipient will be paired with a seasoned Milken Educator, who is an experienced teacher, as a mentor. The mentor will provide a safe space for the new educator to ask questions, share ideas and gain guidance. “I’m inspired to become a teacher that students can relate to and connect deeply with,” Amaro said. “Even if I can’t change the teaching world, I can change the lives of individual children. I know how important early childhood is, and I am thankful to be blessed with the opportunity of being trusted with so many little minds and hearts to take care of.” Jun 18, 2024\n\nStudent Teaching Goes Major League with MLB Partnership at UMKC\n\nKayla Tottress has a calling to help children love learning\n\nFor most teachers, their classrooms look much the same, desks, white boards and colorful posters. But for Kayla Tottress, the classroom sometimes looks quite different, a turf-and-dirt kind of different. The junior in elementary education is part of the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute for Urban Education (IUE), which trains culturally responsive teachers who receive scholarships in exchange for committing to teach in Kansas City-area districts. Among the IUE’s many partners are Major League Baseball and the Kansas City Royals. Together, they team up to help kids in Kansas City enjoy reading and learn a love of the game through the MLB Urban Youth Academy. “What a great way for our students to get involved in their community because we have a team, the Royals, so not only are they getting to learn about baseball and teamwork, but they have a fun outlet, a place to go while also encouraging them to do well in school,” Tottress said.UMKC students work with local elementary students throughout the year, helping them strengthen their reading skills at “Power Hour” tutoring sessions. At the end of the semester, students get to have a baseball trivia night. The game requires students to read and answer trivia questions to earn their chance to hit the ball. After they get a hit, the game proceeds like regular baseball. Though it may seem like fun and games, Tottress said it’s important for students.“I think it's very important that students don't get used to just the tedious, mundane task of everyday learning,” she said. “If we can get them to learn and have fun at the same time, we feel like we're doing a good job as educators.”Major-league partnerships aren’t the only experiences Tottress has had in the classroom. She has also participated in Lead to Read, an initiative to read with students. And she’s been a student teacher at Trailwoods Elementary, part of Kansas City Public Schools, also a UMKC partner. Tottress said being in a classroom, having unique teaching and learning experiences and learning from teachers who have different teaching styles have inspired her to think of how she can bring her own style into the classroom.“One of the advantages of being in a city like Kansas City is that I get to see all different types of people that come from all different walks of life,” Tottress said. “I wouldn’t want to teach anywhere else.”Whether it’s teaching in the classroom, tutoring or leading baseball trivia, for Tottress it’s all about connection. In fact, she says that’s why she chose UMKC. From the moment she inquired at UMKC, Tottress said faculty were responsive to her questions and dedicated to ensuring she was supported. “I really sensed that someone wanted me in their program,” Tottress said. “I love that personal aspect and connection of being connected to a college. I hadn't even said yes yet, and they were already setting things up, saying, ‘We want you to be here.’” Jun 18, 2024\n\nComing Soon: More Campus Dining Options at UMKC\n\nFive new details about the Foodiverse\n\nConstruction is underway on new campus dining options at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In his State of the University address, Chancellor Mauli Agrawal offered a sneak peek of the UMKC Foodiverse. “This is an exciting addition for our students, our employees on campus and the Kansas City community,” said Jody Jeffries, director of the Student Union. “This will elevate our dining experience at UMKC.” What is the Foodiverse? The Foodiverse will be a food-parlor environment on the first floor of the Student Union. There will be eight food concepts, including the full-service Starbucks on the east and a full-service Chick-fil-A that will replace the Chick-fil-A Express on the west. The other six food stalls include: An isolated allergen-free zone Pizza and pasta Deli Salad bar Grill Home-style meals Additionally, more modern furnishings will be added to both interior and exteriors space at Student Union. Why is the Foodiverse being created? The Foodiverse will be closer to UMKC residence halls and centrally located on campus. It also will be short distance from the KC Streetcar stop that is expected to run to and from the UMKC Volker Campus next year. What is the construction timeline, and will the dining hall remain open at Atterbury? The construction at Student Union recently started with clearing space, and is expected to be completed in January 2025 for the spring semester. Meanwhile, the dining hall at Atterbury will remain open. When the Foodiverse opens, Atterbury dining services will be closed for renovations to create a new expanded student welcome center at Atterbury. Will any dining options remain open at Student Union? Yes, the full-service Starbucks will maintain its normal business operations during construction. How will meal plans work for students and for the community? Meal plan holders will engage with the area by visiting one of the six Foodiverse options to compile a full meal from the specific station, and then will be afforded second helpings from any one of the six options during the same meal period. Plan holders will have Meal Exchanges and Flex Dollars associated with their accounts to allow for full retail purchasing at Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. This will be managed through point-of-sale technology. Jun 17, 2024\n\nHereâs How UMKC is Embracing Artificial Intelligence\n\nUsing AI in teaching and research is just the beginning\n\nKansas City’s research university is known for being innovative and future-forward. As artificial intelligence engrains itself into our everyday lives, many faculty have been on the leading edge of using this technology in the classroom and in their respective fields. Here’s what professors campuswide are doing to keep up with AI. School of Science and Engineering ZhiQiang Chen, Ph.D. is one of the founding chair members of a new American Society of Civil Engineers national committee looking at AI in the classroom. The committee is working to answer the global pressing needs of adopting generative AI into civil engineering classrooms. In Fall 2023, he developed the first civil engineering AI course offered at UMKC titled “Intro to AI for Natural and Built Environment Applications.” School of Medicine Sara Gardner (B.L.A. ’01, M.D. ‘02) is looking at how to incorporate appropriate use of AI in patient care and education. “Clinically, as our faculty and institutions have adapted and learned more, we understand the utility of AI to recognize small, incremental changes in our patients that could lead to better treatment strategies that ultimately improve patient outcomes,” Gardner said. “Our graduates will likely encounter this technology very early in their post-graduate training, so we are looking for opportunities for them to be exposed to, and learn to respond to, this data on clinical clerkships. Our students also need to understand and become adept at querying these databases, whether that is generating clinical documentation to a complex interpretation of test results specific to the personal characteristics of your patient, to better understand how to interpret these results for their individual patients.” School of Nursing and Health Studies Jim Spence (B.A. ’95, M.P.A. ’02, B.S.N. ‘09) interim associate dean for academic affairs, has presented at nursing conferences on AI in nursing education. Spence is also encouraging both faculty and students to utilize AI in the classroom, whether that is for developing test questions or patient case studies. For patient case studies, AI is able to generate details of the patient’s social history such as name, gender, age, occupation and physical history from lab tests such as neurological assessments and cardiac testing. School of Humanities and Social Sciences Antonio Byrd, Ph.D., serves on the Modern Language Association and Conference on College Composition and Communication Joint Task on Artificial Intelligence and Writing, a national task force that discusses humanities interventions in AI and higher education. One such example is creating guidelines for AI policies to honor students' linguist diversity and autonomy. School of Education, Social Work and Psychological Sciences Jake Marszalek, Ph.D., interim associate dean and professor of psychology, is investigating the potential outcomes of using AI for learning and education. Marszalek is a co-investigator on a multidisciplinary grant from Unanimous AI to investigate educational outcomes for a software that enables peer-to-peer collaboration while protecting data privacy and security. Henry W. Bloch School of Management Larry Wigger, Ph.D., is currently exploring humanity’s role in i"
