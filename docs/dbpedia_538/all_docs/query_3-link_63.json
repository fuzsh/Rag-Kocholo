        "text": "Homeopathic Treatment\n\nWith constitutional treatment, your first visit of 2 hours is a complete discussion of everything that has ever bothered you, physical issues as well as emotional ones. The homeopath’s job is one of non-judgmental listening, not giving advice or analysis. After this appointment, your different symptoms are categorized and ranked. They are then correlated with reference books of symptoms and remedies. She then prescribes you a single remedy, calibrating dosage and frequency to the specifics of your case. The homeopathic literature is based on 200 years of extensive research.\n\nIndividualized Treatment\n\nWhile most conventional medicines are “one-size-fits-all,” effective homeopathic treatment requires the remedy to be matched to the individual. When the right remedy is selected, a person’s innate healing response is triggered. This need for individualization also explains why you may have tried over-the-counter homeopathic remedies without the help of a professional homeopath and had mixed results. Even though a particular remedy is advertised as being good for the flu, there are actually hundreds of different flu remedies. It’s difficult to have enough information to choose the right one.\n\nOnce you’ve taken your remedy, you get a follow up session in three or four weeks of about an hour where you discuss which of your symptoms have gotten better, or changed, and how. She then changes your remedy or adjusts your dosing, to keep you moving in the right direction. Reading your symptoms correctly and prescribing the right remedy and dosage is an interactive process, and relies on years of formal training."
