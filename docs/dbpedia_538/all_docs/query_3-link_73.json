        "text": "Homeopathy is a holistic medicine system that works with your body to stimulate its innate processes to mend. Homeopathic medicine is made from plant, mineral, or animal substances that have been potentized (diluted and shaken to energize) and the medicine assists our body in showing off its ability to realign, recalibrate, and heal. Homeopathy has been known to facilitate speech in children, diminish symptoms of flu, target symptoms of autism, and assist in progressing a pregnant woman in labor. There are MANY powerful healing outcomes observed from homeopathic medicines- these are just a few. Homeopathic remedies typically come in liquid or pellet form and are not addictive. Once relief occurs, taking the product decreases or stops- homeopathic principles indicate that remedy dosing is always about the minimum dose.\n\nDoes homeopathy really work? The answer is yes. Efficacy studies are available and accessible but more are needed for sure. Here are a few links to efficacy studies using homeopathic intervention and homeoprophylaxis for:\n\nleptospirosis plague in Cuba-https://journals.sagepub.com/full/10.1177/2156587214525402\n\ncoronavirus disease in India-https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33930904/\n\nhealthy pregnancy in Germany-https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8073237/\n\nIf interested in homeopathic care, new client paperwork can be downloaded on the “New Client” tab above and an appointment can be scheduled with your homeopathic practitioner. An initial consultation takes typically 1-2 hours and after that the case is analyzed and a remedy prescribed. Follow-up appointments are typically 15-45 minutes as scheduled as needed (once per week, once per month, once every six months, etc). Use the “Contact Us” page on this website to email or call with more questions regarding homeopathy or if you would like to schedule an appointment."
