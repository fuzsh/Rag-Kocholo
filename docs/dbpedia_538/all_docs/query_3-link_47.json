        "text": "What does it look like? There are no trees to be hugged, machines to step into or any other obscure procedure. We talk. The homeopathic consultation is longer than most. It can last up to an hour as the practitioner seeks to learn and trace the disease or condition in its entirety, and prepare an assessment and treatment strategy which is tailored to the individual. It is not about altering someone’s personality. You don’t change an orange into a lemon, but you can make it a happy orange. It is about the removal of symptoms, working with orthodox practitioners in an integrative way.\n\nEfficacy\n\nHomeopathy is extremely effective for a wide range of symptoms and complaints. With 230 years of uninterrupted and consistent use, homeopathy has been applied in front line acute and emergency health care as well as chronic health settings world-wide.\n\nGlobal provision\n\nHomeopathy is a truly global health care option. It’s presence is seen in the medical marketplace south and north, west and east and it has a long history of uptake in a multitude of cultures and health care systems.\n\nResearch to support its claims\n\nClinical trials have repeatedly proved the efficacy of homeopathy. From its earliest successes in the cholera epidemics of the nineteenth century, homeopathy consistently stands up to the rigor of the 21st century clinical trials and in meta-analysis. Repeated studies as to its efficacy in diarrhea, allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infections, insomnia trauma and shock have been consistently published in peer reviewed journals. Furthermore, the results of trials by theoretical and nuclear physicists are pointing to how the infinitesimal dose stimulates the self-healing/immune response of the body to create therapeutic change.\n\nInexpensive\n\nThe remedies used in homeopathy are very inexpensive to manufacture to a high standard (GMP), in comparison with other forms of complementary medicine and conventional medicine. As such it offers a real cost benefit to individuals and public health stakeholders. Homeopaths use thousands of especially prepared remedies sourced from the natural world. Their preparation is very specific and conducted according to pharmacopeia standards. Infinitesimal dilutions are created in pharmaceutical laboratories and distributed world-wide. Often homeopaths recommend dietary and lifestyle changes as well as lend skilled advice on good living practices.\n\nSustainable\n\nThe green credentials of homeopathy are self-evident. Because of the manufacturing protocols used in the making of a remedy only a small amount of the original natural substance is required to create a significant number of remedies for sale. The impact on the environment and planetary health is clear."
