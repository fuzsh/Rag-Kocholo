        "text": "Homeopathy is based on the theory of ‘treating like with like’. The way homeopathic remedies work isn’t clear, but there doesn’t seem to be any safety risk with using them. Isolated reports have suggested that homeopathy may have positive effects in the treatment of fibromyalgia, but evidence isn’t conclusive. Trials which investigated the role of these remedies in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis gave inconsistent results.\n\nHomeopathy is a form of treatment founded by Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century. According to the Society of Homeopaths, homeopathy is based on the theory of ‘treating like with like’ and an observation that symptoms of an illness are identical to those experienced by a healthy person treated for that illness. Homeopathic remedies are produced by diluting (watering down) an active substance that causes similar symptoms in the belief that this will reduce the likelihood of harm.\n\nHomeopathy is practised by professional homeopaths who are qualified to prescribe remedies according to their diagnosis. However, homeopathic granules, tablets, powders and drops are readily available over the counter in pharmacies and health food shops throughout the UK.\n\nHomeopathic remedies are considered to be well tolerated, although allergic reactions (like rashes) have been reported. Some people also find their symptoms become worse at the start of treatment.\n\nInteractions with other drugs haven’t been well studied, although they’re unlikely given the high dilution of the remedies.\n\nMany homeopathic remedies can be used in the treatment of various forms of arthritis, and dosage hasn’t been well studied. The homeopath or homeopathic pharmaceutical company should recommend a dose.\n\nSystematic review\n\nResults of the trials into the use of homeopathy for rheumatoid arthritis were inconsistent, with one trial (of reasonable quality but with a high withdrawal rate) showing significant benefit from homeopathy and two trials (one of reasonable quality) showing no significant effect.\n\nTrial 1\n\nIn this larger RCT, 112 participants compared the potential beneficial effects of a mixture of 42 oral homeopathic medicines with that of placebo tablets for three months. No evidence was found that homeopathy improved the pain, morning stiffness and mobility in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nTrial 1\n\nHomeopathic drops, which were prescribed by a homeopath and given by mouth, were compared to oral placebo drops in 62 people with fibromyalgia for four weeks.\n\nParticipants who took the homeopathic remedy showed significantly greater improvement in the number of tender points, pain levels and quality of life compared to the placebo group.\n\nTrial 2\n\nRhus toxicodendron given by mouth was compared to placebo tablets in 30 people for four weeks.\n\nParticipants assigned the homeopathic drops showed significantly greater improvement in number of tender points and quality of life compared to the placebo group."
