        "text": "What is a Naturopathic Homeopath?\n\nHomeopathy is a complete system of medicine which is based on the principle of The Law of Similar — the principle of like curing like — whereby a substance which can cause symptoms in a healthy individual can also be used to treat those symptoms when they manifest as part of a disease. Homeopaths do not treat physical, emotional, and mental symptoms but take the view that they are all interconnected as facets of the patient’s suffering. This is what makes homeopathy a truly holistic and refined art. Homeopathic preparations are made in a special way which involves repeatedly diluting and shaking the medicines. It is thought that the processes of preparation somehow imprint a characteristic energy pattern or blueprint of the substance onto the water in which they are diluted.\n\nWhat is a Naturopathic Homeopath?\n\nA Naturopathic Homeopath applies the homeopathic principle of curing like with like using individual homeopathic remedies. In addition, they use other therapies such as Bach Flowers, tissue salts and nutrition homoeopathically. People differ from person to person and, therefore, need individual dietary advice to recover and stay well.\n\nThe Naturopathic Homeopathic Consultation.\n\nThe Naturopathic homeopathic case-taking is possibly the most precise case-history taking that exists. A symptom is not considered as the disease but as one piece in the whole puzzle. Why is there asthma or eczema? A Naturopathic Homeopath always tries to find out when it started and what caused it in the first place. Cancer is considered the end of a disease process which often takes decades to develop. If a client suffers from headaches for example, the Naturopathic Homeopath will ask for the exact location, get the precise description of the headache (pulsating, stabbing, like a needle), the modalities (after eating, before menses, when angry, outside), the times it occurs and what makes it better or worse. Once one symptom is precisely taken from the patient, the Homeopath will take the next symptom and the next and next with all their specifics and modalities. It is the art of a Homeopath to put all symptoms together like a puzzle to form the whole picture leading to one homeopathic remedy. There are hundreds of remedies to choose from, which come in various strengths — for headaches, mood, period problems and so on. After all, the found remedy needs to match with the personality of the patient. A girl who needs a lot of attention, crying if her mother is not holding her hand or leaves her alone, needs a different remedy to the boy who wants to be left alone, kicking others.\n\nHomeopaths are registered with the ANP and follow a Code of Ethics which includes client confidentiality.\n\nHow long does a treatment take?\n\nThe first consultation can take up to 2 hours. Follow-ups are shorter. Acute symptoms disappear within seconds — one can watch it happen, for example, a bee sting, sunburn, acute shock. Treating eczema, especially when there is an inherited component, can take years to totally disappear."
