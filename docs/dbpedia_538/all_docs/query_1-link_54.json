        "text": "By Carol Wersich\n\nGeorge Helfrich's father always told him that when you start getting plaques to hang on your wall, you're getting old. But the son was pleased and proud just the same when he received the Realtor of The Year Award plaque late last week.\n\nThen, on Monday, Helfrich's granddaughter, Layla Rose Helfirch, was born.\n\n\"The other thing (award) went to the backburner,\" said Helfrich, explaining he was overcome with joy by the baby's arrival. Little Layla — daughter of Helfrich's son, Peter, and his wife, Shay — is George Helfrich's 10th grandchild. However, her arrival was as invigorating as the first grandchild's, he said.\n\nHelfrich, 56, is president and a broker of Helfrich Realtors on Evansville's West Side. He joined the family business 38 years ago.\n\nHis award was from the Evansville Area Association of Realtors.\n\nThe organization also recognized Jim Keck, a sales associate with Prudential Prime Locations on the city's East Side, as the Sales Associate of The Year.\n\nThe awards for Keck and Helfrich recognized their dedication to their profession and to civic projects, said John Czoer, the Realtors association president.\n\nHelfrich is a third-generation operator of Helfrich Realty, which was started 94 years ago by his grandfather, George P. Helfrich, and was later operated by his father, James Helfrich.\n\nKeck, 42, is also active in realtor groups and currently serves on the Computer Committee of the Evansvile Area Association of Realtors.\n\nHe is a member of the St. Mary's Medical Center's Coronet Ball Committee, volunteers weekly at the Christian Life Center and is president of the local parks.\n\nHe and his wife, Christine, work together in a greeting ministry, known as the Welcome Center, at Christian Fellowship Church.\n\nKeck joined Prudential Prime Locations 10 years ago."
