        "text": "Homeopathy is a complete, holistic and effective therapeutic system of nanoparticle medicine. It is a safe, gentle, and natural system of healing that works with your body to relieve symptoms, restore balance, and improve your overall health.\n\nOriginally developed by the German physician Dr Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), the homeopathic approach to the treatment of disease aims to address the root cause of illnesses and encompasses all areas of physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\n\nHomeopathic treatments are personalised and tailored to each person; even people with the same condition will receive different treatments. During an appointment, a homeopathic doctor will ask you a number of questions about your physical, mental and emotional health. He or she will then tailor a treatment plan and prescribe the remedy that best matches all of your symptoms.\n\nHomeopathy is a therapeutic medical system which is based on the observation that substances that are capable of causing diseases of the mind or body in healthy people can be used in the dilute form as remedies to treat the similar disorder in someone who is ill. This is the homeopathic Law of Similars, also expressed as “Let Likes be Cured by Likes“.\n\nAs an example, red onion makes your eyes water. That’s why it’s diluted and used in homeopathic remedies for allergies.\n\nThe key to successful homeopathic treatment is identifying the similarity between the effects of the original substance in healthy people and the pattern of illness in the individual who is sick. For this reason, the homeopathic method involves an exceptionally holistic and detailed description of the patient, the illness and its evolution.\n\nIn order to be treated truly homeopathically, one needs to consult with a registered practitioner. Although homeopathic products can be bought over-the-counter, holistic treatment should be prescribed by a homeopathic doctor.\n\nHomeopathy makes use of ultra-dilutions of substances to effect cellular changes and bring about the physiological restoration of health. Specifically prepared and diluted medicinal substances are dispensed as potentised remedies to the patient.\n\nThe ingredients of the remedies come from plants, minerals, or animals. They are environmentally friendly and cruelty-free. When used as directed, homeopathic remedies are completely safe for everyone (including pregnant and nursing women, infants, children, the elderly and adults).\n\nThe remedies are available/dispensed as medicated pillules to be placed under the tongue, ointments, creams, drops, tablets, and gels.\n\nHomeopathic doctors have the same rights, responsibilities and abilities to diagnose disease and treat (within scope of practice) as medical doctors. They can treat all forms of pathology and disease, except for conditions that require direct surgical intervention. In the event that specialist and/or surgical referral is deemed necessary, the homeopathic doctor can refer the patient to a surgeon/specialist.\n\nAs primary healthcare professionals, homeopathic doctors are clinically trained to examine patients, request necessary special investigations (e.g. laboratory tests and/or diagnostic imaging), diagnose and treat disease accordingly.\n\nHomeopathy is used for a wide variety of acute and chronic health issues, including (but not limited to):\n\nAllergies\n\nMigraines\n\nDepression\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome\n\nPremenstrual syndrome\n\nMinor injuries\n\nToothache migraines\n\nHeadaches and\n\nCough, colds, flu\n\nAsthma\n\nAutism"
