        "text": "Treatment that’s as individual as you are\n\nHomeopathy treats the whole person as an individual. A homeopath will spend time listening to you to find out the way in which your symptoms are affecting you. You will also be asked questions about your medical history, your mood and lifestyle.\n\nLike treats like\n\nHomeopathy is based on the principle of ‘like treats like’ – that’s when a substance which can cause symptoms taken in large doses, is used in small amounts to treat similar symptoms.\n\nThe principle of treating ‘like with like’ dates back to Hippocrates (460-377BC) Homeopathy has been widely used worldwide for 250 years. The system of therapeautics based on the ‘law of similars’ was discovered in 1796 by a German doctor, Samuel Hahnemann, who was looking for a way to reduce the damaging side effects associated with medicines used at that time.\n\nHomeopathic remedies can be used safely alongside conventional medicines as they will not interfere with their action in the body.\n\nMany years of practice and research trials support the safety of this gentle system of medicine for people and animals alike.\n\nMany homeopathic practitioners offer a First Aid service for their patients when they are suffering from acute symptoms of illness or accidents.\n\nThe manufacture of all homeopathic medicines is a highly specialist process that takes place in a handful of homeopathic pharmacies in the UK, all regulated by the General Pharmaceutical Council and MHRA.\n\nA lot of sports personalities and celebrities have used homeopathy, including Stacy Dooley, Michelle Collins, Arlene Phillips, Paul McCartney, David Beckham, Louise Jameson, Gaby Roslin, Jude Law, Sadie Frost, Nadia Sawalha, Jennifer Aniston, Roger Daltry, Jenny Seagrove and Helena Bonham Carter."
