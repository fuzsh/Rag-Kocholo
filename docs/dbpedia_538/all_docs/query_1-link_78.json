        "text": "The John J. Bazyk Distinguished Speaker Day\n\nIn 1998, the Occupational Therapy Program faculty developed the OT Distinguished Speaker Day as a way to promote and celebrate our profession with our students, area clinicians, and university colleagues. Each year, we invite a leader in the field of occupational therapy or in the discipline of occupational science to spend time at CSU. This even has provided faculty, students and clinicians an opportunity to learn first-hand from nationally recognized scholars and innovators, and to interact with them on a personal level.\n\nIn 2000, the event was named in honor of John J. Bazyk, following his many years of leadership as the Director of the Occupational Therapy Program. Special thanks go out to Patrick Baker (OT â€™97) for the initial funding as well as the idea to honor John Bazyk.\n\nWe have been honored to host this impressive list of leaders in the field of occupational therapy:\n\nJohn Bazyk, Glen Gillen (2014 Distinguished Speaker), Glenn Goodman"
