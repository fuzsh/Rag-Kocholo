        "text": "Homeopathy is a form of “alternative medicine” based on an eighteenth-century pseudoscientific idea that “like cures like” (or, in fancier homeopath parlance, “that which a substance is capable of causing, it is also capable of curing”).\n\nIn homeopathic products, ingredients such as deadly nightshade, poison ivy, and liver extract are heavily diluted to minuscule amounts. So miniscule, in fact, that no trace of the original ingredient remains in the final product.\n\nThis is the important part: There is no scientific basis for homeopathy. The FDA has not examined the claims of any homeopathic drug, and no valid scientific study has ever shown that homeopathy has any effect on any ailment or symptom whatsoever, beyond that of a placebo. Studies that have claimed to prove the effectiveness of homeopathic products have usually been carried out by the manufacturer of those products, not an independent group. So when the packaging of a homeopathic product boasts about its ability to treat an ailment or symptom, it is merely marketing, not based on science or evidence.\n\nBoth side effect-free and effect-free!\n\nBecause homeopathic products are essentially sugar pills or water with no active ingredients, they can’t actually do anything on their own. In this sense, a homeopathic product is “harmless.”\n\nMore importantly, though, homeopathy causes harm when people choose to rely on homeopathic products instead of evidence-based treatments that might actually do some good. Homeopathy is at the very least a waste of money, and at worst it risks the health of the person who takes it.\n\nWhat Can I Do to Help?\n\nHomeopathic products should be subject to the same standards for safety and efficacy to which all other drug products are held. Mitigate the harm and deception that occurs from the widespread marketing of homeopathic products by urging your lawmakers to pursue evidence-based policy."
