Cohn, ScD, OTR, FAOTA Clinical Professor, Entry-level OTD Program Director Department of Occupational Therapy Sargent College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences Boston University Co-Editor Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy, 10th & 11th Edition Consulting Editor Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy, 12th Edition We are pleased to dedicate this edition to Dr. Ellen S. Cohn—a clinician, educator, and scholar whose intellectual integrity, standards of excellence, and enduring commitment to the profession is reflected in her many contributions to occupational therapy (OT) and the people served by the profession. Dr. Cohn has contributed 22 chapters to seven editions of Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy beginning in 7th edition (1988) through this 13th edition. As co-editor of the 10th and 11th editions, and consulting editor of the 12th edition, she collaborated on key efforts to reconstruct the text to guide both students and instructors toward more reflective, client-centered, and occupation-based practice. As a result, the text includes clear identification of the status of evidence regarding the methods of assessment and intervention, an element Dr. 7\n\nCohn felt strongly about weaving into the fiber of the text. Similarly, Dr. Cohn was instrumental in bringing a more international perspective to the text by recruiting well-respected international OT scholars to contribute. In addition, she significantly expanded the role of first-person narratives including the addition of chapters related to caregiving and communitybased practice. She facilitated the development of a section devoted to describing common health conditions seen in OT clients, including diagnostic information, implications for occupation, evaluation and intervention strategies, and a description of current evidence that supports practice decisions. Dr. Cohn is an outstanding editor, starting with her impressive command of all things grammatical. More important is her grasp of complex ideas, which she elegantly makes accessible to readers, interweaving important theoretical and practice perspectives. She is a great listener and articulate advocate while also able to focus on the practical planning and processes required for bringing a textbook of this magnitude into being. And she does it all with a delightful sense of humor. Because of her many contributions to the field, it was not surprising to us that she received the 2018 Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lectureship from the American Occupational Therapy Association in the same year that we chose to honor her with this dedication. We are grateful for her service to this text and the profession. Barbara A. Boyt Schell Lead Editor Glen Gillen Co-editor Elizabeth B.

They are shown in contrast to occupational therapists in 2018 working in a variety of settings, supporting clients in a range of occupations across the life span.\n\n9\n\nCONSULTING EDITORS\n\nLori T.

In recognition of that event, we are including two special features in this edition. The first is a special history of the Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy text itself which details the development of the book as it transitioned from the original edition in 1947 to this edition. Since that 1st edition, this textbook has become an icon in the field. It is the text that welcomes students into the complexities of their newly chosen profession while also serving as a resource to the field by documenting the central knowledge and practices of occupational therapy (OT). It has gained this iconic status in no small part due to the work of previous editors and the many contributors, for which we are thankful. The second new feature is the addition of “Centennial Notes” to most chapters throughout the book. These snapshots provide insights into the many facets of the field that are difficult to capture in the general history of the profession chapter, which remains in the first unit. Contributors were asked to write something fun or interesting about the history of their topic, how it has changed since the profession’s founding and what trajectories can be traced from the past and into the future. This work was greatly aided by the extensive research provided by consulting editor Lori T. Andersen who, along with Barbara Schell, edited and in some cases authored the notes herself. These thumbnail essays serve as postcards from the past and guideposts to the future. As always, chapters in this text summarize important and complex material in a way that is accessible and which challenges budding practitioners to think deeply about the many facets of occupation that emerge in the daily rounds of life. Furthermore, the process of OT is 36\n\ndescribed across a wide array of practice arenas. This 13th edition continues these traditions, as Barbara A. Boyt Schell continues the role of lead editor, and Glen Gillen continues as a co-editor. Marjorie E. Scaffa and Ellen S. Cohn retire from their respective roles as co-editor and consulting editor but continue as contributors. Joining Schell and Gillen for the first time is a panel of consulting editors including the aforementioned Lori T. Andersen, along with Catana E. Brown and Kristie Patten Koenig. These consultants helped identify contributors, reviewed and edited contributions, and, in general, helped with assuring the highquality content expected for this text. This revision of Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy builds on the successful revisions done in the last edition. To identify needed changes, students and faculty who use the book were surveyed. Several leaders and scholars in the field also graciously provided advice through individual consultations. Although users generally expressed strong satisfaction with the text, some organizational changes were implemented, building on the restructuring done in the 12th edition. This information, in addition to the perspectives of the editors and consulting editors, informed the reorganization of this edition as well as the addition of new chapters and materials. An overall summary of these changes is provided next, followed by an overview of each unit, highlighting the materials included in each.\n\nWillard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy, editions 1 to 13, with editors noted.\n\nOverall Changes in the Text and Web-Based Materials Because feedback on many aspects of the 12th edition was quite positive, Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy 13th edition retained materials focused on the centrality of occupation as the basis for practice, 37\n\nboth as a means and an end of therapy. In this edition, we continue to acknowledge that evaluation and intervention processes are integrated with the theoretical perspectives of practitioners and the influences of the broader social and political environment on the day-to-day lives of practitioners and the clients they serve. Attempts were made to provide a diverse range of examples across cultures, life course, and occupational performance concerns, with particular emphasis on attending to worldwide scholarship within OT. As in previous editions, we maintain that effective OT requires a collaborative process between or among OT practitioners and the clients they serve. For therapy to be optimally effective, a blending of current best evidence with therapist experience and client preferences must guide the process. Because this process is often complex, contributors were asked to provide many illustrations of the professional reasoning and underlying assumptions that guide practice. Furthermore, contributors were asked to acknowledge the challenges in implementing best practice and suggest approaches for overcoming these challenges. As authors and editors, we acknowledge the power of language. Throughout this book, we have attempted to use language that is inclusive. That extends to appreciating the many different ways that humans are configured and the ways in which they engage in occupations. We also attempted to be inclusive of international perspectives by acknowledging when content is particularly reflective of U.S. perspectives versus content that appears to be fairly applicable across OT as it is practiced throughout the world. In addition to the overall guiding principles just described, there were some noticeable changes in the book which include the following: 1. The expansion of expanded Web-based materials. Video resources inaugurated in the last edition were expanded to include children as well as adults. These video cases of clients can be used in conjunction with the book to provide students with opportunities to observe and analyze applications of concepts and techniques. The appendices (which are available on thePoint) related to common conditions affecting occupational performance and OT assessments will both be available for download to mobile devices. Finally, first-person narratives deleted from this edition will continue to be available to 38\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\nboth students and faculty on thePoint. Updating of materials to reflect the AOTA’s Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process, third edition, while retaining an appreciation for broader international perspectives by also relating materials to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Expansion of Unit I to include a new chapter on research and scholarship intended to expose students to the importance of that aspect of the profession as well as broadening the chapter on contemporary practice to reflect a more global perspective Addition of four new narratives to Unit III’s first-person perspectives to reflect current issues challenging individuals and their families. Narratives deleted from the print version of the text remain available on thePoint. Addition of a new chapter addressing disability in the context of culture in Unit IV and expansion of attention to gender to acknowledge the range of gender identities Tightening of Unit IX Practice Theories to reflect theoretical perspectives for which there is a body of evidence for validity and clinical utility\n\nUnit-by-Unit Summary The units in this edition were retained as the current general organization seemed to work well for users. We did add some new chapters and, in some cases, renamed chapters to clarify the contents. In the description that follows, new chapters added to the text will be highlighted. Except where noted, all chapters returning from the 12th edition were either updated or completely rewritten; all chapters which were new or were written by new authors were externally reviewed by one of the consulting editors or an external expert, along with reviews by a member of our student reviewer panel. Unit I profiles the profession by opening with a chapter on occupation followed by the broad written history of the profession, which places OT history in the context of larger world events. Next, a new chapter on the philosophical assumptions guiding the profession is added to this unit to 39\n\nhelp students appreciate the core beliefs, which are embedded in the profession. The next chapter in this unit is expanded to profile contemporary practice in from a global perspective. Finally, a new chapter on scholarship and research exposes readers to role of scholarship in all aspects of the profession. The author shares her own journey as she developed her research career and provides specific examples of research throughout the profession. By placing this material together in the opening unit, students are provided with important foundational material for the rest of the book. Unit II describes the occupational nature of humans. The opening chapter explores how participation in occupation changes over the course of life. This is followed by a chapter on the relationships between occupation and health. The final occupational science chapter provides insight into the ongoing research about occupation, with updated examples of how such research informs OT practice. Unit III continues to have first-person narratives of people with various occupational challenges after an opening chapter explaining the importance of client narratives to effective practice. A number of new first-person narratives are in the section, including accounts by: Laura and Craig Horowitz as they raised their son Will, a bright young man who is on the autism spectrum. Will describes his childhood and life from toddler days through high school. As a side note, Laura has been the managing editor for Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy for the last three editions, and she is proud to share that Will graduated from high school this year. A first-person account by Paul Cabell, a veteran who is an actor and comedian challenged by mental illness, substance abuse, and homelessness A narrative by Jean Westmacott, a sculptor and art director who brought her mother, Hildegard Viden Wilkins, home to live with Jean and her husband, in order to care for Hildegard in the final years of her life until her death at over 100 years old An account by Beth Long, a Methodist minister who experienced a stroke while traveling to Ladakh, a northern province of India, who describes her personal and spiritual journey as she recovers, only to find that she has been “retired” from her ministerial position 40\n\nWe retain the updated narratives of Gloria Dickerson and her successful narrative of her recovery process from the challenges of mental illness, which followed her abusive childhood as well as the collection of narratives of people living with disability in Ecuador. Three narratives have been moved from the book but remain available on thePoint. These are Mary Feldhaus-Weber’s experience of a head injury, Alex and his parents’ views of their child growing up with cerebral palsy, and Donald Murray’s poignant description of caring for his wife during her days with dementia. Mary Feldhaus-Weber recently passed away, and Don Murray died before the publication of the last book. We honor their memory and contributions by keeping these narratives available. All of the narratives provide rich opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of how occupation and health challenges interweave in the ongoing lives of real individuals. Unit IV on occupations in context contains a number of chapters designed to make a clearer connection with the broad array of contextual factors discussed in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process, third edition, and the WHO’s ICF. The chapter on “Culture, Diversity, and Culturally Effective Care” includes attention to gender issues, including gender identity. A new author adds an addition to this unit in Chapter 21 entitled “Disability Rights.” This replaces Chapter 70 “Disability Rights and Advocacy” that was formerly in Unit XV. Finally, new authors expand the chapter on “Physical and Virtual Environments.” Unit V focuses on personal factors affecting occupation and continues the inclusion of updated chapters that closely parallel the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process, third edition, as well as the WHO’s ICF. The opening chapter on individual factors provides a number of examples to students about how body functions and structures impact performance. The chapter on spirituality and beliefs explains how these individual differences impact the meaning of occupation. Unit VI focuses on analyzing occupation, with the first chapter explaining occupational and activity analysis, and a second on performance skills, both of which provide information on ways to consider occupational performance. 41\n\nUnit VII contains a number of chapters which explain the OT process. All the chapters from the previous edition return. The introductory chapter to this unit provides an overview of the OT process and outcomes of care. Then, follows a chapter on determining client needs which provides detailed examples of client evaluation in a variety of situations. Next, a chapter on critiquing assessments provides information on how to appraise traditional measurement procedures as well as current psychometric approaches in OT assessments. The process of intervention for individuals and for organizations, communities, and populations is fully explored in the next two chapters. The unit ends a chapter about modifying performance contexts. Unit VIII clusters together seven chapters, all of them returning from the last edition. Chapters in this unit address core concepts and skills such as professional reasoning; evidence-based practice; ethical practice; therapeutic relationships and client collaboration; group process and group intervention; professionalism, communication, and teamwork; and documentation in practice. Unit IX discusses theories of occupational performance, starting with a chapter examining how theory guides practice. Following this are chapters focused on theories for which there is a body of evidence to support their validity and utility, starting with the Model of Human Occupation. Next is a discussion of Ecological Models in Occupational Therapy which include the Ecology of Human Performance, PersonEnvironment-Occupation, Person-Environment-OccupationalPerformance, and Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement. This is followed by chapters on Theory of Occupational Adaptation and finally “Occupational Justice.” As in all other units, all chapters have been updated with inclusion of relevant evidence. The emerging theories chapter is omitted in this edition, pending development of further relevant evidence on new theories. Unit X retains the chapters of broad theories that inform practice but which are not OT theories per se. These include the Recovery Model, Health Promotion Theories, and Principles of Learning and Behavior Change. Unit XI starts with an introductory chapter that provides an overview of evaluation, intervention, and outcomes for the major areas of 42\n\noccupation. Basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADL and IADL) are discussed in the next chapter, followed by chapters on education, work, play and leisure, rest and sleep, and ending with the chapter on social participation. Unit XII provides a survey of focused theories that are commonly used in conjunction with occupational performance theories to guide intervention. All topics from the last edition are retained, including motor control, cognition and perception, and a new chapter on sensory processing in everyday life. The unit ends with a chapter on emotional regulation and one addressing social interaction. Unit XIII, entitled “The Practice Context: Therapists in Action,” displays therapist decision making as it is implemented in different therapy settings across various continuums of care. The first chapter explains how clients may receive therapy across a wide range of settings, although clusters of settings may be more associated with some health or participation challenges than others. Subsequent chapters each provide a therapist narrative explaining the thinking behind the evaluation and intervention strategies implemented for a particular client. Additionally, each chapter addressed how services commonly occur across different settings. Separate chapters address services for individuals with autism spectrum disorders, traumatic brain injury, and schizophrenia, followed by additional chapters focused on a worker with hand injuries, older adults with changing needs, and disaster survivors. The intent of this unit is to “bring alive” the various theories and intervention approaches by displaying real-world situations. Unit XIV contains an updated chapter on Fieldwork, Practice Education, and Professional Entry, and a newly rewritten chapter on Competence and Professional Development. Unit XV addresses OT management, supervision, and related topics such as payment for services. The first two chapters focus on management and supervision respectively, with a new co-author contributing to the supervision chapter. Next is a chapter on consultation with a new author and expanded content. The chapter on payment includes the current information on changes in health policy in the United States. The glossary contains definitions of key words from chapters and 43\n\nimportant terminology from other sources such as the WHO’s ICF and the AOTA’s Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process, third edition. There are two appendices related to the text, both of which are now on thePoint. The first includes either new or completely updated summaries of resources and evidence related to common conditions for which OT services are provided. The second appendix is an updated table of assessments used in OT.\n\nSpecial Features Special features are found both in the text and in the Web materials associated with this text. Special features include the following: Practice Dilemma: a practice situation related to chapter content with one to three questions designed to challenge students. Answers are not provided to the student. Ethical Dilemma: a scenario relevant to chapter content which poses an ethical challenge for practitioners Case Study: an example of OT evaluation and intervention modeling expert practice. Note that these are available both in text and in the form of video vignettes online. Commentary on the Evidence: a succinct discussion about available evidence to support practice, including identification of where evidence is lacking or inconclusive and where further research is required Centennial Notes: These notes provide insights into the many facets of the field that are difficult to capture in the general history of the profession chapter. The notes discuss how the topic of the chapter changed since the profession’s founding and what trajectories can be traced from the past and into the future. With this edition, we are pleased to continue to offer specially selected video clips from International Clinical Educators, Inc. These may be found on thePoint (http://thePoint.lww.com/Willard-Spackman13e). Also on thePoint are PowerPoint slides for each chapter, quiz and test banks, additional learning materials, and several professionally developed video clips.\n\n44\n\nFinal Notes Once again, we are grateful for the guidance provided by many experienced colleagues as we have created this edition. We are particularly thankful for our consulting editors Lori T. Andersen, Catana E. Brown, and Kristie Patten Koenig. It is our hope that this “Centennial Edition” contributes new light on the heritage of this text as it transitioned editors as well as surfacing many less well-known facets of the profession’s history. It is our privilege to carry on the tradition of Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy as a treasury of knowledge and a beacon to light the way for the next generation of OT practitioners. Barbara A. Boyt Schell Glen Gillen\n\n45\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis edition of Willard & Spackman’s Occupational Therapy was accomplished through the collective efforts of the contributors, editors, reviewers, photographers, students, colleagues, friends, and family. We are grateful for their many contributions to this effort and know that their commitment, scholarship, and generosity in sharing these traits have improved the quality of the work presented here. Editing a book such as this becomes an occupation in and of itself. Like all occupations, it is interwoven within the larger tapestry of activities that comprise our lives. Indeed, there is the “text” and the “subtext” of each edition. The text you see before you. The subtext is hidden behind the scenes. This edition started with a new format of editors, as Marjorie retired from the editorial role and Ellen from the consulting editor role. By the time we were planning this book, Barbara was retiring from her fulltime academic and administrative responsibilities. As we complete the book, Glen is stepping up to become program director at his university. As the book progressed, each of our own life stories evolved as well. Health challenges involving ourselves, family members, and colleagues served to personalize many of the concepts in this book as we took turns both supporting and covering for each other. As always, our pets were important reminders of when it was time to eat and play. Barb appreciates Brandy, the 105-lb labrador mix, who is sometimes affectionately referred to as “my little pony.” Meanwhile, Glen’s dog, Max, continues to spin in circles indicating that he wants attention or has an activity of daily living to attend to. Barbara thanks her husband John W. Schell, PhD, who is both playmate and professional partner in education and scholarship; photographer extraordinaire; and father/grandfather to our wonderful family, Brad, Trina, Sophie and Izzy Schell, and Alyxius, Marcus, Adrian, 46\n\nRooke, Akhasa and Samarra Young all of whom give meaning to our lives. Finally, thanks to Helen Clayton for her service in our household. Glen thanks his parents, Gary and Gail, and nieces and nephews who range from age 3 to 21 years, Julianna, Harry, Avery, and Harper. Thanks to each of you for your commitment to each of us. Finally, each of us is very proud of our universities and OT programs, which sustain us in our work and encourage us to greater accomplishments. Our students, faculty, and practitioners in our professional communities provide a background of inspiration for taking on a task such as this. We thank all those who helped us with their insights.\n\nProfessional Colleagues and Students We thank our colleagues for their assistance, support, and insightful feedback. We are grateful for the faculty and students who responded to surveys: Editorial Review Board We thank our consulting editors, invited faculty reviewers, and student reviewers who gave generously of their time and knowledge to review chapters in this book to assure that each chapter met our standards for both scholarship and accessibility. They are listed by name earlier in this front matter, but we wish to once again thank them for their service. Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Current and former Lippincott Williams & Wilkins personnel contributed to the development of this book, and we appreciate their ongoing support. Mike Nobel, Matt Hauber, Shauna Kelley, Tim Rinehart, and Joan Sinclair Harold Medina and his team of Absolute Service, Inc., who once again joined us via the Internet from the Philippines. We appreciate his thoroughness in copy editing and page formatting, willingness to remind us (again!) what he is missing from us, and overall grace in his communications. York Content Development Our thanks to Wolters Kluwer for allowing us once again to have the 47\n\nspecial attentions of this group. This is the third time that Laura and her staff have served to support us in this text, and their contributions are invaluable. Laura Horowitz provided overall guidance of the development of the manuscript through the production of the book. Her steady guidance, expertise, patience, and good humor provided significant support to our efforts. Gretchen Miller helped us with her careful tracking of contributors, permissions, photos, and all other editorial details needed to bring the book to fruition.\n\n48\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\n\nUnit I\n\nOccupation Therapy: Profile of the Profession\n\nUnit II\n\nOccupational Nature of Humans\n\nUnit III\n\nNarrative Perspectives on Occupation and Disability\n\nUnit IV\n\nOccupation in Context\n\nUnit V\n\nClient Factors and Occupational Performance\n\nUnit VI\n\nAnalyzing Occupation\n\nUnit VII\n\nOccupational Therapy Process\n\nUnit VIII\n\nCore Concepts and Skills\n\nUnit IX\n\nOccupational Performance Theories of Practice\n\nUnit X\n\nBroad Theories Informing Practice\n\nUnit XI\n\nEvaluation, Intervention, and Outcomes for Occupations\n\nUnit XII\n\nTheory Guided Interventions: Examples from the Field\n\nUnit XIII\n\nThe Practice Context: Therapists in Action\n\nUnit XIV\n\nProfessional Development\n\nUnit XV\n\nOccupational Therapy Management\n\nIntroduction to Appendixes Glossary Index Available on thePoint (http://thePoint.lww.com/Willard49\n\nSpackman13e) Appendix I Resources and Evidence for Common Conditions Addressed in OT Appendix Table of Assessments: Listed Alphabetically II by Title Appendix First-Person Narratives III\n\n50\n\nCONTENTS\n\nUNIT I Occupational Therapy: Profile of the Profession\n\n1 What Is Occupation?
