        "text": "Homeopathy is a form of “alternative medicine” based on an eighteenth-century pseudoscientific idea that “like cures like” (or, in fancier homeopath parlance, “that which a substance is capable of causing, it is also capable of curing”).\n\nIn homeopathic products, ingredients such as deadly nightshade, poison ivy, and liver extract are heavily diluted to minuscule amounts. So minuscule, in fact, that no trace of the original ingredient remains in the final product. Further down this page we’ll get into how proponents of homeopathy explain how a homeopathic drug can work without any active ingredient.\n\nThis is the important part: There is no scientific basis for homeopathy. The FDA has not examined the claims of any homeopathic drug, and no valid scientific study has ever shown that homeopathy has any effect on any ailment or symptom whatsoever, beyond that of a placebo. Studies that have claimed to prove the effectiveness of homeopathic products have usually been carried out by the manufacturer of those products, not an independent group. So when the packaging of a homeopathic product boasts about its ability to treat an ailment or symptom, it is merely marketing, not based on science or evidence.\n\nWhat about other forms of “natural,” “holistic,” or “alternative” medicine? Homeopathy is not to be confused with dietary or herbal supplements, such as Echinacea or St. John’s wort, which have actual active ingredients in them. Homeopathic products are regulated in the United States as drugs, which gives homeopathy companies the freedom to market their products as cures for specific ailments, such as headaches, colds, flu, migraines, shingles, yeast infections, and diverticulitis. Regulatory laws around dietary supplements do not afford the same latitude.\n\nHomeopathy. It’s Complete Pseudoscience.\n\nFirst, there is little credible evidence that the active ingredients in homeopathic products —such as poison ivy, various plants and herbs, and mercury—effectively treat any illnesses. But even if they did, these ingredients are diluted to such an extent that the original substance essentially no longer exists.\n\nThe FDA has not evaluated or approved any homeopathic products and has said it is also not aware of any proven health benefits of these products.\n\nSo, no. Homeopathy doesn’t work and, as we’ll explain, it can’t possibly work.\n\nIs Homeopathy Harmful?\n\nNo and yes. Because homeopathic products are essentially sugar pills or water with no active ingredients, they can’t actually do anything on their own. In this sense, a homeopathic product is “harmless.” But it’s more complicated than that.\n\nDue in part to the lack of regulation and different dilution methods used by different companies, the FDA has reported that some homeopathic products have been found to contain measurable amounts of active ingredients and therefore could cause significant patient harm. In 2016, there were a reported 400 cases of infant seizures and vomiting and ten deaths from homeopathic teething gels and tablets that contained deadly nightshade. Arsenicum album, a homeopathic product used to treat diarrhea and digestive disorders, uses arsenic as its active ingredient. One study showed that arsenic, when used in homeopathic preparations, can cause clinical arsenic toxicity. So, in the sense that these unregulated products begin with dangerous ingredients, homeopathy has enormous potential for harm.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, homeopathy causes harm when people choose to rely on homeopathic products instead of evidence-based treatments that might actually do some good. Homeopathy is at the very least a waste of money, and at worst it risks the health of the person who takes it.\n\nExamples of Homeopathy?\n\nThe History of Homeopathy?\n\nHomeopathy is an invention of Samuel Hahnemann in 1796. His work on the subject appeared in Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs published in 1796 and The Organon of the Healing Art in 1810. The core of Hahnemann’s belief was that, “…if a patient had an illness, it could be cured by giving a medicine which, if given to a healthy person, would produce similar symptoms of that same illness but to a slighter degree.”\n\nHow is Homeopathy Supposed to Work?\n\nLet’s take a look at one of the more popular homeopathic flu treatments, Oscillococcinum. The active ingredient of Oscillococcinum is claimed to be “Anas barbariae 200CK HPUS.” “Anas barbariae” is the ingredient, and “200CK” is the level of dilution.\n\nWhat Does That Mean?\n\nAnas barbariae is the Latin term for the extract of a duck’s liver and heart. A duck’s heart and liver are believed by homeopathy practitioners to be reservoirs and vectors of the influenza virus. The extract used in Oscillococcinum is prepared using the “Korsakovian” dilution method, in which ingredients are prepared in a single flask for a series of successive dilutions rather than a new container for each.\n\nThe flask is subjected to vigorous shaking and then poured off. A water/alcohol mixture is added to dilute the remaining material on the walls of the flask. At this point in the process, the dilution factor of the extract is assumed to be 1:100, which is written as “1C”; the C stands for “centesimal.” This process is then carried out 200 more times in succession to give a 200CK “potency.” CK stands for “centesimal Korsakovian.”\n\nA 200CK dilution is such an astoundingly high level of dilution that a typical dose of Oscillococcinum does not contain any molecules of the original substance. In addition, there is no credible evidence that points to duck liver as an effective combatant to the influenza virus.\n\nNow this is important: Homeopaths believe the more dilute a solution becomes the greater the solution’s potency, healing abilities, and strength. In other words, they think that the less of an ingredient there is, the more powerful the medicine.\n\nHomeopathic Theory of Water Memory\n\nAfter high dilutions (for example, 1:1006) in homeopathic remedies, you are essentially left with a beaker full of water. Some systematic reviews of homeopathy have found that they are not relevantly different from placebo. So where is all this power from the active ingredient coming from?\n\nHomeopaths believe in the concept of “water memory.” The idea was created by the French biologist Jacques Benveniste in the late 1980s. According to Michel Schiff in his book The Memory of Water: Homoeopathy and the Battle of Ideas in the New Science, Benveniste made the argument that, “water molecules somehow seem able to keep a record of previous contact with other kinds of molecules.”\n\nIn case it isn’t obvious, there is absolutely no factual basis to this idea. Water molecules do not have memories, nor do any other molecules.\n\nCommon Homeopathic ‘Active’ Ingredients\n\nThe idea of “like cures like” has meant the homeopathy industry uses a wide variety of harmful substances. The industry further attempts to confuse consumers by labeling their ingredients in latin.\n\nArnica Montana – Wolf’s bane, leopard’s bane, mountain tobacco\n\nRhus tox – Poison ivy\n\nAnas Barbariae Hepatis et Cordis Extractum – Duck heart and liver extract\n\nArsenicum album – Arsenic\n\nZincum metallicum – Zinc\n\nEupatorium perfoliatum – Boneset, a North American perennial plant\n\nAllium cepa – Onion\n\nAtropa belladonna – Deadly nightshade\n\nMercurius Solubilis – Mercury\n\nUnderstanding Homeopathic Dilutions\n\nIn contrast, Nyquil Severe Cold and Flu has a dilution of its FDA approved active ingredients of 1:43."
