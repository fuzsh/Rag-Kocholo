        "text": "The Conversation, Talks, Life & Times of HERING.\n\nBy Calvin B. Knerr, M. D.Presented by Médi-T.\n\nNotes from my Diary.\n\nApril, 21, 1869.\n\nDr. Hering speaks of an extraordinary man, a Professor Rhrig, who has a great talent for acquiring foreign languages. When a boy Rhrig found an Arabic grammar, in Dr. Hering's library. He seized upon it and took it away with him to study the language along with his other work. In a short time he had mastered Arabic. Later, in Europe, he encountered some Arabs and Turks at a Fair, whom he addressed, to their great astonishment, in their native tongue, which brought him into notice. He had already mastered a number of other languages, including German, French, Italian, etc., which knowledge secured him a position on a Prussian expedition to Russia. He was then only fourteen years old. While visiting Constantinople he learned the Persian and Chaldean languages. Wherever he saw an outlandish person he made his acquaintance and very soon was able to speak the language. While in Russia he committed the innocent blunder of writing sonnets to the sultan, in the Russian language, for which offence his Prussian embassy sent him home. Although said to speak twenty languages fluently, he is unable to speak the Pennsylvania German dialect.\n\nRoehrig placed documents in Dr. Hering's hands from which a history of his life might be written. He has a wife, at present engaged as a seamstress in the Hering family, while her husband is in New York trying to earn some money. The wife speaks in the highest terms of her husband, who seems to neglect her.\n\nJahr's Therapeutic Guide.\n\nIn the evening I am occupied with scissors cutting symptoms copied by the secretary from Jahr's Therapeutic Guide. These are intended to go into the work on Materia Medica. These symptoms, written on slips of paper, Dr. Hering pastes on sheets of brown manila paper, in an order which, he says : Enables him to look behind the scenes. He says he has done this with Guernsey and Raue's books ; claims that Raue did not like this so well.\n\nMacFarlan.\n\nDr. Malcolm MacFarlan is elected to give a course of lectures at the College on operative surgery in the coming fall. Both Koch and Raue were opposed to MacFarlan's election. Doctors Gause, Thomas, Martin and Hering, likewise Morgan, who specialized in surgery, were in his favor. MacFarlan was married yesterday to a rich florist's daughter.\n\nFlowering Plants. Has their color relation to the spectroscope ? Acids.\n\nHering is trying to find out if the way in which the flowers of medicinal plants are colored any relation to the spectroscope. He presumes that red-flowering plants act upon one side of the body, while blue-flowering ones affect the other side.\n\nIn certain combinations the mineral acids have a predominating number of symptoms, leaving those from organic acids in the background.\n\nPrimary colors, red, blue and yellow, are represented in a diagram as occupying the three corners of a triangle, red standing for Lithium, blue for Kali, and yellow for Natrum.\n\nJohn Hering.\n\nWhile at table Dr. Hering received a letter from his oldest son, John, who lives in Surinam, South America. He said jocosely : Oh this is from my oldest, good-for-nothing son, John Take it to my wife and let her read it.\n\nHouatt's Provings.\n\n\"Houatt, a Frenchman, has made provings of Kali hydriodicum, Sarracenia, etc. It is questionable if his provings are reliable.\"\n\nThis Houatt made an experiment which Hering had proposed to Hahnemann twenty-five years ago, viz : to select for proving twelve medicines, in the 200th potency, the names of which were to be carefully sealed to the observer, only to be revealed by symptoms obtained from the provings. Houatt proved Belladonna in the manner prescribed, obtained about three hundred symptoms, two-thirds of which showed the character of the remedy.\n\n* * *\n\nApril 22, 1869.\n\nHegel.\n\n\"Hegel, who wrote books on philosophy, did not know the difference between the two electricities.\"\n\nKill or Cure.\n\n\"A young man who had suffered a long time from intermittent fever came to me with a doleful tale. He wished to marry the daughter of a rich manufacturer. He could only get her on condition that he would be able to fill the position of fireman in her father's establishment. This, he said, was impossible on account of his being harassed by chills and fever. The young fellow was desperate ; said he would either drown or shoot himself if he could not be relieved of the malady. He demanded of me a prescription which would either \"kill or cure !\" \"\n\nI hesitated a moment, then gave him the following advice : Go to the Schuylkill River when again you feel the attack coming on. Undress. Get some of your friends to tie a rope under your shoulders so that they can suspend you in the water up to your mouth. Jump into the river and force yourself to stay there during the chill. When the fever, which follows the chill, comes on remain there until the sweat appears, then leave the water.\n\nMy directions were followed to the letter. The patient soon became blue in the face ; his friends thought he would die, but he motioned to them that he wished to stay in the water. Soon the fever took hold of him and the poor fellow became so weak that he could scarcely utter a word. His friends again motioned to pull him out, but he decided to stand the ordeal. He had been in the water two hours when the sweat came on. He now consented to be taken from the river and his friends pulled him to the shore, wrapped him into warm blankets and took him home. From that day he had no return of chills or fever, was married to the girl of his choice, and supposedly lived happily ever after.\n\nIf again I should be moved to advise such heroic treatment I would urge the patient to get out of the bath as soon as the fever came on.\n\n\"The remedy, in good faith, is one of kill or cure !\"\n\nCase of the Cuban.\n\nA young Cuban was brought to Philadelphia for treatment. I was called in consultation with an allopathic physician who had the case in hand. I found a young man, with black eyes, mere skeleton filled with air, unable to swallow a morsel of food without vomiting it up directly after. He cursed at doctors in general and swore that he would take neither homopathic nor any other kind of medicine.\n\nI sent to the nearest shop for some plain cream, of which I ordered a teaspoonful to be taken, with little sugar every half hour. The patient took it. Next day he said he had not vomited once. I then increased the quantity of cream to dessert spoonful doses, every hours. On the following day he complained of severe pain in the stomach. I felt a large lump there size of a fist. This his physician had pronounced to be a cancer. It was none.\n\nI gave him two globules of Hyoscyamus on the tongue. He had no more pain after this. I now ordered a table spoonful of beef-tea to be taken on the one-half hour, and the same quantity of arrowroot on the next half-hour, turn about. The young man kept on gaining weight steadily and in a short time he returned to his island a well man.\n\nWhen he received my bill, in the amount of one hundred dollars, he paid it promptly, telling me that I was the most sensible doctor he had ever met, and at the same time the most stupid, because he had expected to pay me no less than a thousand.\n\n\"This patient recommended a great many others to me, from Cuba. Homopathy flourished there until it was spoiled by another physician, a colleague.\"\n\nUnpaid Advice.\n\n\"Latter, while still living on Walnut Street, there came to my office, a father and son. The son was in almost the same condition as the case just described. The father asked me what he should do. I told him to give his son small quantities of food, and often. When I had turned my back the two slipped out from my office without paying a fee. I subsequently learned that the father said : Anybody could have given him the same advice ! And yet it cured his boy There is much truth in small suggestions like these, often overlooked, or disregarded by reason of their apparent insignificance.\"\n\nImagination.\n\n\"This plays a strong part in the getting well, or being made worse, with many sick people. We people who yet imagine themselves to be ill should be punished.\"\n\nUngrateful Patients.\n\n\"I was asked the other day whether it was not very provoking, as well as discouraging, to meet with ungrateful patients. Ingratitude we meet with every day, said I. Our Lord and Master was covered with it. Surely God has more cause to complain of ingratitude than have I !\"\n\nMore of the same Medicine.\n\nA patient, one morning, sent his man to get some more of the same medicine, but to get it from the young doctor ; who had probably prescribed it on the advice of the older one.\n\nCharity.\n\nOne morning a man was waiting in the reception room. When I came in he asked that both doors be closed. He then, told me that his name was B--, a young doctor from Boston, on his way to West Chester, where he had an uncle. He said he was without a penny in his pockets, so asked me to lend him sixty cents, to go by the noon train. I gave him seventy-five cents, which he promised to return on the following day. I never saw him again. He had said that he had expected his uncle to meet him at the American House. He smelled of rum and worse shabby clothes. Dr. Hering is frequently approached by mendicants : by some honestly, mostly otherwise. I am supposed to stand between him and these to shield him from unworthy applicants, but he is often imposed upon in one way or another, in spite of my efforts.\n\nNatural History. The Ichneumon Fly.\n\nThe Icheumon Fly lays its eggs into the body of a live caterpillar. After the caterpillar is converted into a chrysalis there emerges from it, not a butterfly but the Ichneumon Fly.\n\n* * *\n\nApril 23, 1869.\n\nAloes.\n\nI went to a druggist in Philadelphia by the name of Morris to buy some Aloes. He showed me two kinds. I told him that both of them were adulterations. He sent his boy out to all the drug stores in town for more samples. An immense heap of Aloes was collected, all of them bogus. The druggist was chagrined. He sent to New York for more samples. I came to examine this large assortment but did not find a single genuine specimen among them. At last I noticed that the druggist held back a small package, carefully wrapped in paper, which he did not seem willing to show me. I asked to see it. He handed it over, smiled as I said : \"This is genuine aloes. Where did you get it\" He confessed that he had stolen it from a collection in the Academy of Pharmacy, of which he was a trustee. The sample had been brought into the country by an expedition that had sailed around the world and had received the specimen from the Sultan of Muscat, who grew the plant from which the substance is derived. When you break a piece of Aloes the fracture must show a purplish golden tint, almost transparent. The adulterated specimens were boiled in certain oils to such a degree that they made the paper, in which they came, greasy.\n\n\"Aloes has its sphere of action in the pelvis. There is great congestion there, with a feeling of fullness as if everything was tending there ; hæmorrhoidal tenesmus.\"\n\nInflammation.\n\n\"Inflammation is the result of overaction of the serous membranes. If these become overactive the natural vacuum which exists in the serous sacs is increased and a congestion of blood to the part results. Vertigo is due to diminished action of the serous membranes of the brain, causing diminution of blood there. Overaction of the serous membranes of the heart produces violent palpitation and other heart symptoms. When the pendulum swings back we have the opposite symptoms ; depressed heart-action, etc. They wish to prove this theory by experiments. This cannot be done.\"\n\nAnecdote. Disobliging Help.\n\nWhenever others do not wish to do a thing for me I always go and do it myself. At one time a heavy snow fell. It snowed as if there were huge bags of feathers in the clouds which were ripped open and emptied of their contents upon the earth beneath. The family wash hung on the line, on the stable roof. The coachman had been asked to take it down. He refused. I pulled on a pair of heavy boots said : \"Hahnemann geh du voran, du hast die grossen Stiefel an.\" (Hahnemann, you take the lead, the biggest boots are on your feet) and plunged to the shoulders into the snow. After me rushed the whole pack of servants ; with them one of the young ladies who had some valuable clothes among the lot, and who was most eager to press forward, following close at my heels. At last, after great exertion, we reached the stable. Having first lifted the heavy trap-door, laden with snow, I made my way to the roof where I cut down the line upon which the clothes were suspended, brought it down to the ground where those below took them off. When we got back to the house everybody exclaimed : \"Oh, but this is outrageous Just think of the doctor !\" The coachman had hidden angrily in some corner.\n\nA man who wished to have some letters taken to the Post Office, on finding that his errand boy was busy, asked his coachman to carry the letters. The coachman replied : \"It is not my business !\" Ah, yes said the man, \"I forgot. Excuse me. You may hitch the horses and bring the carriage around to the door.\" The coachman opened his eyes wide in surprise when the boy-of-all-work stepped into the carriage, letters in hand and asked to be driven to the Post Office in style, there to deposit the letters.\n\nOften in life the doctor had to take the burden upon his shoulders, without thinking it too hard to bear if thereby he could serve the cause.\n\nMartin. Co-Editor of Journal.\n\nToday Dr. Martin came to ask for copy. He asked for more characteristics, such as were being printed in the College Journal. Dr. Hering said that he had thousands of them up-stairs ; that he had only waited for Martin to ask for them. It seems that at one time the co-editor had shown reluctance to printing more of the keynotes which had become so popular with the students and subscribers to the Journal.\n\nWork on the Repertory.\n\nDr. Hering asked me today, to make a further classification of the symptoms from Jahr's Leitfaden (Therapeutic Guide). He said that Jahr gave some remedies, like Aconite and Sulphur almost universally ; Kali bich. only once or twice ; Gelsem. not at all, and some of the other remedies very rarely. It is a great piece of work to dissect a book of this kind, but it gives one a look behind the curtain, as Hering expresses it.\n\n* * *\n\nApril 25, 1869.\n\nFerrum. Digitalis.\n\nFerrum has great similarity to Rhus tox. It would be interesting to know if there is much iron in the soil where the Rhus grows. I could hardly tell the difference in the cough peculiar to the two remedies. There is also great similarity in the asthmas and neuralgias.\n\n\"Does Digitalis grow on calcareous soil ? The plant grows in large patches as though sown, in the Schwarzwald near Wildbad. I do not know if it is found growing near the Belladonna, but think it is ; at least so says Dr. Koch, Sen.\"\n\nThe Man who hired a Mule. Anecdote.\n\n\"A man from ancient Greece hired a mule to ride. It became very warm, the mule sweated, became tired and stood still in the sun. The man got off the mule to rest in the animal's shadow. The driver, who followed at the mule's heels, claimed that the shadow belonged to him and not to the man who hired the animal. A quarrel was the result and the case went to court. Query. If a man hires a mule, does he also hire his shadow ?\"\n\nOdd Fellows.\n\nToday there was a parade by Odd Fellows. Hering says that the Odd Fellows do a great deal of good.\n\nMorgan. Theories.\n\nProfessor Morgan preaches his pet theory on spinal centrics and excentrics to Dr. Hering, who does not seem to favor it much. Morgan was the son of a school teacher.\n\nEuphrasia and Cepa.\n\nHering calls attention to a comparison between them.\n\n* * *\n\nApril 27, 1869.\n\nSugar Cane.\n\nSugar Cane is planted in beds intersected by canals. The water which is let in at high tide drives the mills. Negroes float the cane to the mills where it is pressed. The men get drowsy over the work at the machines and sometimes are drawn in. An axe is kept ready to hand with which to sever their limbs, when caught.\n\n\"The liquid pressed from the cane is boiled and the crystallized mass is put into barrels. The leakage is termed Plantation molasses. The sugar cane is soaked and pressed a second time, when it yield a good deal more of sugar. The dry cane should be burned and the ashes put back into the soil. An old farmer once told me, 'Everything that my acre gives, it must have again.' \"\n\nCollege. Jealousy.\n\nProfessors Martin and Koch, of the College, conspire against Professor Gause. The green-eyed monster, jealousy.\n\nPalpitation.\n\nPalpitation, worse from motion, is hard to find in the Materia Medica.\n\n* * *\n\nApril 28, 1869.\n\nA Curse upon Secretmongers.\n\nHering says he has written down a terrible curse against all persons who keep secret things that would be of benefit to the world.\n\nThe curse is to be printed. He says : It was written before my acquaintance with Fincke, who kept secret his process of potentization.\n\nThe terrible curse condemns offenders to everlasting perdition, in the lowermost depths of hell, to the second and third generations. Hering calls it the most terrible curse ever pronounced.\n\nA Fair.\n\nA Fair is to be organized for the benefit of a Homopathic Hospital in Philadelphia. The first meeting is to be held at the College. The attendance of two hundred and fifty ladies is expected at the initial meeting.\n\nMuseum.\n\n\"I suggest that a museum be established in which, for adornment, there will be columns decorated with designs taken from natural trees, in leafwork, branches and flowers ; from the coca tree, the camphor tree, etc. Designs for Grecian columns were taken from nature.\"\n\nNitrum.\n\n\"A keynote of Nitrum is : drinking often but little at a time. The patient drinks little at a time because the act of swallowing interferes with respiration. This is Grauvogl's observation.\"\n\nPictures.\n\nHering is opposed to the hanging of certain pictures of skin diseases on the College walls. It makes the place look like what he quaintly calls a show-shanty.\n\n* * *\n\nApril 29, 1869.\n\nNewspapers.\n\nThe New York Herald was begun in Philadelphia and went to New York. It was a sensational paper which published scandals under the management of Bennett. The Tribune, under Horace Greeley, became an opposition paper. Whatever in the way of editorials appeared in Bennett's paper, was contradicted in the Tribune, on the following day. This rivalry continued for many years. If the Herald condemned homopathy, the Tribune was in favor of it. If the Herald disapproved of spiritualism, the Tribune defended it. The Tribune gained over the Herald when that paper got into bad repute.\n\nA certain geologist predicted that the waters going over the Falls of Niagara would in time wear away, or undermine the rocks over which they flow and there would no longer be a Niagara. The story was a hoax, which the Herald printed as news. The Tribune had the laugh on its rival.\n\n\"Yesterday the Philadelphia Press printed an article which said that Greeley had been swindled for the 86th time, by a story that a young man, who had an accomplice in Philadelphia, had induced a certain candidate for office to pay him money for advertising him in the Tribune.\"\n\nAncestors. Moravians.\n\nHering's ancestors were Moravians who spelled their name Hring. They had come from their home in the mountains to settle on the banks of the river Elbe where they became sailmakers and fishermen.\n\nHering likes the custom of the Moravians which, at sunrise, on Easter morning, brings them to the churchyard where they hold religious services. They keep holy All Saint's Day, which comes on the second of November. He believes that the Moravians honor men as Saints who have been of great use to the world.\n\nSchiller.\n\nThe doctor asks me to remind him to tell the story of Schiller in the role of a Saint. The story is about a farmer who prayed to the statue of Schiller. He was put up to it by a student.\n\nPlays for the benefit of the Hospital. Gaertner. Septette of Beethoven. Formes. A Fire.\n\nA project for raising funds to build a homopathic hospital is under way. Tonight there is to be given a theatrical entertainment for this purpose in Dr. Hering's house, in which members of his family will participate. The sum of twenty-four dollars was raised by this performance, which is to be devoted to the buying of material to be used at the Fair. Two plays were given, one of them Der Geburtstag der Geister (Birthday of Ghosts) by the children ; one of whom, Walter was to play the part of the boy who boasts before the other children that he is not afraid of ghosts. For this he is ridiculed by his playmates. To take revenge upon his tormentors he disguises himself as a ghost, and as such makes his appearance. When the real ghost comes upon the scene the bogus one becomes so frightened that he tears off his mask and sheet, and has to face the ridicule from the other children who call him \"Hasenfuss\" (coward).\n\nIn a second play, Die Hochzeitsreise by Bendix, Rudolph, the oldest son, took the principal part, that of the Professor ; Bertha, a niece, the part of the wife Antonia ; Melitta played the part of the Famulus ; in men's clothes. The Professor's assistant, or student, was played by William Boericke, who later became prominent among homopathic physicians. He took the comedy part of Hahnesporn, a man-servant. Miss Raue, niece of Professor Raue of the Hahnemann College, took the part of the chambermaid across the way from the Professor's house.\n\nThe Professor, in white vest, black coat and pants and a high hat was excellently portrayed by Rudolph. The Professor has peculiar notions of a wife's duties in the home, and after the wedding, is seemingly more in love with his books than with his wife who finds herself in a cheerless house, without servants ; no cook, not a decent bedroom, no household comforts, while the Professor, interested to know how the ancient Greeks and Romans treated their wives, forgets that he is a husband. His pretty and determined wife does not relish this and sets about converting her indifferent spouse. She at first succeeds in arousing his jealousy, after which she proposes a wedding-trip. He agrees to this and just before the curtain falls he is seen awkwardly trying to take her into his arms.\n\nThe large communicating rooms, with wide folding-doors of mahogany, separating the doctor's private office from his reception room, afforded an excellent opportunity for a stage setting in the back room, and for places for about forty or fifty friends of the family, who, after enjoying the German play, adjourned to the dining-room across the hall, where ale, tapped from the wood, and pretzels were served by the German maids. All became merriment and German gemuethlichkeit.\n\nPrivate theatricals were of frequent occurrence in the home, in which the writer took part. There were musical events, programs of strictly classical music, rendered by prominent musicians, who thought it a pleasure to play for Dr. Hering, whenever invited. His friend Carl Gaertner, a Swede, a fine violinist, who was among the first to introduce classical chamber music to Philadelphians, was always ready to oblige. On several occasions the Septette of Beethoven was performed, which required seven instruments for its rendition. A musician by the name of Schneider played the horn.\n\nThis particular composition, arranged for four hands on the piano, was played nightly, after the dinner hour, by myself and one of the daughters, Melitta, who became my future wife. This was done to entertain the doctor who sat at his work in the adjoining study humming his favorite melodies.\n\nThe celebrated opera basso, Carl Formes, was a frequent guest at the house, where he was entertained whenever his performances in grand opera brought him to Philadelphia. He was then the world's finest basso, who, in his roles of Sarastro, Leperello, Rocco and Marcel had no equal. To the famous aria, sung by Leperello from Mozart's Don Giovanni, Dr. Hering had made words in accordance with rapid increase in members of homopathic physicians throughout the world. This aria Formes rendered with great eclat and gusto on occasions when friends were assembled in the house.\n\nAfter some of the guests had departed, a small party of the guests who remained, adjourned to the stage back of the curtain to play the game of Heraus wershat (Button, button, who has the button) with great hilarity. Mrs. Hering, as gay as her daughters, and Hering's niece Bertha, joined in the fun and Carl Gaertner, violinist and wife, Mr. and Mrs. McGeorge, Mr. Faber, artist and wife, Mr. Midnight, Rudolph Hering, Miss Tafel, William Boericke and myself, enjoyed the party, which lasted into the small hours. Dr. Hering had retired to his study.\n\nBefore the party ended there was an alarm of fire in the neighborhood. We looked out of the windows. The sky to the North was lurid. We all rushed to the top of the house, better to see. Some crying, some laughing, \"Is it our Church ?\" (The Swedenborgian Church at Broad and Brandywine Streets.) Others said, \"It is the great velocipede-ring close to the Church.\" Who will run to the fire ? \"I and I\"-even the ladies are ready to go. We rushed madly down stairs to the second floor. There stood the gray-haired doctor. \"No Ladies, you shall not run to a fire. Gentlemen,\" he said, \"When I was as young as you, I was first at a fire.\" We made a dash for it, Professor Koch and myself in the lead. We encountered a stream of water from a hose that had sprung a leak : Koch was completely drenched, I almost as badly. We were in our best clothes. We arrived in time to see a large and beautiful building almost a heap of ashes. We stood against a brick-wall, almost red-hot, whence we had a good view of the fire, there to dry our wet clothes. No ill effects followed.\n\n* * *\n\nApril 30, 1869.\n\nA Concert.\n\nI went with Mrs. Hering and some of the younger folks, to attend Carl Gaertner's Fifth Classical Concert. Miss Bertha Hering sang in a duet from Der Freischuetz ; also in a trio. Gaertner played a solo on the violin, The Soldier's Farewell, his own composition, with great effect. These concerts are truly appreciated by the music lovers of Philadelphia. There is to be a grand introductory concert, to be given by Gaertner, for the benefit of the Fair fund.\n\nWedding Trips.\n\nDr. Hering is opposed to wedding trips, which he condemns in the strongest terms, as \"Eine, verruchte Sitte,\" an outrageous custom. He believes it to be detrimental to health to be travelling at such a time. Thinks it is the time, of all times, when young married couples should stay at home instead of philandering about the country. He says the mode was introduced by the German nobility, and claims that the custom had a questionable origin morally, like the coming into fashion of the crinoline among the French.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 1, 1869.\n\nGambling. Gaertner.\n\nCarl Gaertner dined with us. He spoke of the vice of gambling ; how it obsesses its victims, even more powerfully than the abuse of narcotics ; how men in Europe have staked their honor, that of their wives, and the liberty of their children for the sake of material gain.\n\nFairs.\n\nDr. Hering wishes Fairs to become general. People must work for an end (zweck). Money is an equivalent for work. Work therefore is money, and money work. Each and every worker for the Fair must set an estimate upon his labor, whose equivalent it must bring. No more, no less. Homopathic Fairs should be an annual occurrence, like the Jahrmarkt in Germany.\n\nCharacter Building.\n\nHering's teachers were mild, genial, loving men. His father, a teacher, was of the same disposition. He had great respect for etiquette, and a yielding disposition, Hering's grandfather not quite so much. Hering is different, straight forward and unyielding when on the side of truth. Children should not be obliged to imitate their parents, at least not their faults. He says he would not advise his sons to go through with all he had experienced. Yet, he says, he has had great luck in his life.\n\nA man from the Pfalz. De Nusky.\n\nI conversed with one of the doctor's patients this afternoon whose name is Koch, formerly from Allentown. He is a German, originally from the Palatinate. He has great admiration for the Pennsylvania German people. He thinks them hospitable and kind, and admires their honesty. He remembers my great uncle, the Rev. John Helfrich, who was associated with Dr. Hering at the Allentown Academy. He saw him at a convention of ministers at Norristown. Also the Reverends Bibige and Miller. He knew De Nusky, a resident of Kutztown, who had also been a minister, and originally came from Hamburg, in Germany ; left his country on account of religions persecution. Everything he did was for money. He married a rich but very ignorant woman. He had suffered shipwreck on his way to this country, arriving at New York, poor, almost naked. He became very rich, in later life, while living in Allentown.\n\nBethlehem. Moravians.\n\n\"Bethlehem in Pennsylvania was founded more than 200 years ago by Moravians under a certain Count Zinsendorf, who left Saxony on account of persecution. The Indians around Bethlehem stood in great awe of this man who they thought was sent to them by the Great Spirit, and they prostrated themselves before his shadow. They could not have been moved to do him harm. The Count lies buried in the graveyard by the Moravian Church in Bethlehem.\"\n\nPennsylvania German Dialect.\n\n\"A good part of the dialect was brought from the Palatinate in Germany. Many immigrants came from Switzerland. Those who came from Holland had been greatly persecuted by the Spaniards. A stipend was given to young men who wished to study for the ministry, afterwards sent as missionaries to America. Michael Schlatter was one who was sent to Pennsylvania. It was the Prince of Orange, whose forces won a victory over the Spaniards, who saved Protestantism in Holland. The dreadful Spanish Inquisition spread over Europe. In Paris thousands of Protestants were put to death ; King Charles himself fired upon them from the windows of his palace, the Luxembourg. The Huguenots secreted themselves in the catacombs, under the city. The Spanish put to death many of the Protestant Moors, in their country, who were a modified race of Caucasians, very skilful in the art of architecture.\"\n\n* * *\n\nMay 2, 1869.\n\nKeeping the Sabbath.\n\nRainy and cold in the morning. I helped Rudolph make forms of crystals from pasteboard. He has no special regard for the Sabbath, which he estimates like any other day in the week. This at first affected me strangely.\n\nIn Europe, where Rudolph received his education, some of the people go to church in the morning, and others, young and old, take their pleasure in the afternoon which is devoted to enjoyment of every kind. He does not go to church, says he does not derive any benefit from it. He visited Oschaz, in Saxony, the birthplace of his father : also Dresden, which has 150,000 inhabitants. Philadelphia at the present time, 1869, has but 100,000.\n\nOschatz.\n\nOschatz, a small town in Germany, was destroyed by fire and rebuilt, so it no longer bears much resemblance to the birthplace of Dr. Hering. His father moved his family to Zittau, a picturesquely situated small town in Saxony. None of the relations are living in the former place at the present time.\n\nDifferent stories are told of the way in which the town received its romantic name. Hering's secretary, Dr. Knable, also a Saxon, told the tale in the following way : The count who governed the domain, was on a hunting party with his lady-love, on horseback, when they halted and overlooked the few houses that were built. What shall we name the place, my dear ? said the count. \"O Schatz,\" modestly said the lady, \"how should I tell ?\" Oschatz it shall be then, said the count. Schatz being German for sweetheart.\n\nTravelling in Europe.\n\nRudolph Hering thinks it would cost two thousand dollars to make the tour of Europe at he present time. Three years later, when visiting abroad and giving some time to the hospitals, besides touring, I found that this was about the sum required for an eighteen month's stay, devoted to study and to travel.\n\nA Sunday afternoon. Round Table. Allopathic Doctors.\n\nI read to the ladies a delightful article, from the Gartenlaube, entitled Ohne Dorner, keine Rosen (Without Thorns, no roses). In it four characteristics, peculiar to women, are described :\n\n1. Roses with but few thorns.\n\n2. Roses with many thorns.\n\n3. Klatschrosen (red ones) for the gossipy kind.\n\n4. Eva-Roeschen, roses named after mother Eve.\n\nThen came some of the Sunday visitors to gather about the round table, in the back room, with Hering in the center of the circle, and Mrs. Hering pouring delicious coffee. The younger women sat with their Handarbeit, knitting, embroidery, or some light occupation, listening to the wisdom of the men as German women are won't to do.\n\nDr. Hering on the subject of allopaths says : their ways are mean, cunning and underhand ; they deceive, they cheat, they steal, they kill. He relates the case of a lady, who hid in the closet of the room while allopathic doctors were holding a consultation over the case of one of her women friends, who was employing Dr. Lingen, a homopath. In a revengeful mood the doctors declared that this patient should not, dare not be permitted to get well and live under homopathic treatment. The lady in the closet overheard the conspiracy. Under some pretext the patient was removed, taken to England, away from her homopathic physician, where after five or six week, she died.\n\nMacfarlan. Surgery.\n\nDr. Malcolm Macfarlan accepted the position of Professor of Operative Surgery in our College, which Hearing thinks will ultimately make it a successful institution, since surgery is the point of the augur (Chirurgie ist die Spitze des Borhrers).\n\nDr. Macfarlan had become popular as surgeon in the army during our Civil War. He was particularly successful with operations for hernia.\n\nFairs.\n\nDr. Hering's aims to raise American Fairs to the standard of the European Volksfest. He thinks Fairs will have a good moral influence upon people. Children will work with an end in view. He contemplates writing articles for the papers on the subject of Fairs and their Philosophy.\n\nSome years ago, Miss Hering says, her father was desperately opposed to Fairs. He is now prepared to defend them. Also Dr. Guernsey, who is said to be opposed to Fairs, in toto, has had his name placed on a circular letter to be sent to the doctors.\n\nThe Round Table Group.\n\nCopy of a Drawing by Hermann Faber of a Family Group in Dr. Hering's Home in Philadelphia. The Persons Represented are, from Left to Right : Constantine Hering ; Dr. August Koch, Physician ; Mrs. Hering ; Dr. Oswald Seidensticker, Professor ; Melitta Hering (Dr. Knerr's Wife) ; Dr. C. B. Knerr ; Hermann Faber, Artist.\n\nThe Sabbath.\n\nHering observes that Dr. Gause never stays a minute over 12 o'clock, midnight, at any of the faculty meetings, on a Saturday night, he says : Now my Sunday begins To which Hering replies : That's right, Dr. Gause, keep your Sunday. I like you for that. You are honest. Dr. Morgan, too, keeps his Sunday strictly. Dr. W., who is opposed to keeping the dispensary open on Sunday, says, it will bring us into bad repute. He is the one who told Hering, Every man ought to go to church for appearances sake.\n\nHering says it is an old story that when Christ was asked : Is a man justifiable to break the Sabbath ? he answered : \"If he knows what he is doing.\" (Wenn erweiss was er thut). The saying is Godlike enough to have come from Jesus' lips. Hering seems to think that Christ instituted the Sabbath for the Jews, who needed some such formal arrangement.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 3, 1869.\n\nFair.\n\nIn the evening a preliminary meeting was held by the Professors of the College, seconded by Dr. Williamson, to discuss Fair matters ; the principal meeting is to be held tomorrow.\n\nTemperance.\n\nHering talked on the subject of temperance. Said he had treated two prominent lecturers on the subject, for mania potu. They gave as a reason for drinking ; that \"they could lecture better under the influence of liquor !\" Wine is sacred, he thinks, and whosoever says anything against its proper use, commits a sin against the Holy Ghost. Alcohol is injurious, therefore a bad thing to be addicted to. Wine is an antidote to drunkenness.\n\nHe thinks that beer, in moderation, serves a good purpose, but that in those parts of Germany where beer is taken to excess the people become fat, gross and slothful and lack ambition. Horace Greley remarked that he had seen as much drunkenness in those parts of Europe where wine is used as in other places. Henry Ward Beecher denied this, saying that he found very little, or no drunkenness, in places where the use of wine is customary. Hering says : \"One ass comes out and says, 'I saw drunkenness' and the other one says : 'I saw none' !\"\n\nThe Tribune.\n\nA man by the name of Young, who wrote contributions in the form of letters, for Greeley's paper, sued Dana, the proprietor of another paper, in the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, for publishing his letters which revealed a certain swindling plot.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 4, 1869.\n\nThe Fair. Richard Koch's opposition.\n\nDr. Hering received a letter from Dr. Pulte, in Cincinnati, where they also are getting up a Fair for the benefit of homopathic hospital. Pulte is to conduct pioneer tables and is asking Hering to contribute a dozen of his pictures. Hering says he must do something to help them, then maybe they will so something for us. Pulte was associated with the Allentown Academy. While there he wrote a biography of himself in which he quoted a memorial poem, written after the death of Schoenlein, the German pathologist. Although Pulte has done much for homopathy he is of such an overbearing disposition that he is hard to get along with. He wrote of a certain man, whom Hering respected, he is unscientific, ignorant and unworthy of confidence The elder Miss Hering, Odelia, was quite indignant over Pulte's behavior.\n\nRichard Koch predicts that the Fair will be a failure, by reason of a certain member being on the committee, (meaning Morgan) who \"from selfish motives will hinder its success.\" He thinks that Morgan will arrogate to him-self directorship of the hospital. Koch says \"he will eat his shirt\" if the Fair realizes more than five thousand dollars, and offers to bet five hundred to back his opinion. It netted seventeen thousand. The bet was not paid.\n\nSomehow everything Hering proposes, Koch opposes. If Hering asks to have the plates representing diseases of the skin removed from the walls of the College building on visiting days, Koch insists on having them remain. This morning the Janitor at the College, and myself, removed these pictures to a floor above, on account of a Ladies' meeting to be held in the lower room. When Koch found this out he made complaint because they were not put in the chemical room, down stairs. Hering threatens to play the madman. Should Koch hang the pictures again in the objectionable spot he says he will \"break them up !\"\n\nA Caller.\n\nA certain doctor, living not far from Hering's house, a man not of very good repute in the neighborhood, called at a late hour to see Dr. Hering, who had retired to his room on the second floor. The visitor gave the bell a violent pull. When the servant had admitted the gentleman I stepped into the vestibule and there met a man of middle age, who grasped my hand, squeezed it, almost lifting it to his face. His eyes were blue and twinkling, holding one firmly while he bowed low. Dr. Hering has retired, I told him, but he will send you a note in the morning. \"Oh no I will call again. I am not going to Europe before the first to June.\" Another bow, as I opened the front door ; two more bows, as I opened the front door ; two more bows, and he was gone.\n\nThe Fair. Dr. Martin.\n\nA ring at the door. In came Dr. Martin. \"Professor what makes you come so late, the doctor has retired.\" He sits down. \"I had business,\" he said. \"It is getting so that I can't see the doctor any more.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to leave a note, Dr. Martin ?\" No ; it is nothing in particular.\n\nI explained that Dr. Hering had been up until half after twelve the evening before and was tired. Prof. Martin asked. \"Who was here ?\" \"Doctors Morgan, Williamson and Gause were here, talking about the Fair.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's the way things are done ! Well the whole thing will go to ruin. The dragon's teeth were sown today. There were things done today that will ruin the whole undertaking, perhaps break up the College, too. Many ladies who were present thought so, too.\"\n\n\"Why, Professor, don't be downhearted ; I thought a good deal was accomplished at the meeting.\"\n\nThe Professor gets up and walks to the table. \"Ah yes, you have no experience in such matters.\"\n\nDr. Martin said : \"Well, good night,\" and walked off in a hasty manner, as if out of humor. The object of the Ladies' meeting, called for today, was to organize for work to be done for the Fair. The meeting opened at four o'clock. Professor Gause made a short address. The constitution and by-laws were read and discussed ; some of the ladies requested that several articles should be changed, or omitted therefrom, after which the constitution and by-laws were adopted. The ladies had brought some men-friends with them who acted as spokesmen and all were enthusiastic over the prospects. About seventy ladies signed their names for membership in the Association.\n\nStudent Days.\n\nIn the evening, Dr. Farrington present, Hering related the history of his early student days in Leipzig, when he was poor, and struggling to maintain a living.\n\nOn account of leaving the ranks of the allopaths, in which school I had graduated at the University of Wuerzburg, and joining the homopaths, I was in sore straits. I occupied a room but poorly furnished, for which I paid twenty-five cents per week ; a cold place, where, without fuel, I almost froze on bitter cold days. I was invited to meals at a students' free eating-house (a kind of soup house), but only at such times when other boarders had skipped their meals because they did not think them good enough. Here the bread was good, whatever might be said of the rest of the food. Often I took home with me scraps of rye bread, which, stale and dry, I soaked in weak broth, or ate them, hard as they were, which made my gums bleed, but in this way I thought I obtained some organic matter for my system One day a student friend told me of a woman who kept a boarding house, a believer in homopathy and in need of treatment.\n\nConstantine Hering.\n\nReproduction of a Miniature Oil Painting on Ivory, Made About the Time of His Entering the University of Leipzic.\n\nMy friend coaxed me to go with him to see the woman, who needed Ignatia ; she invited me to stay to supper. The kind woman soon learned of my condition. She provided me with some spare pieces of wood for a fire and some milk. One day, when she came to my room, she noticed some of the dry bread heaped up on my desk, and wished to know what I intended to do with it. I told her I was saving it for sustenance. She asked me if I had a mind to exchange some of it for milk ; that she had some cows and pigs for whom stale bread was very good food. She took some of the hardest pieces. Later, in exchange for treatment, she boarded me until better times came. Shall not one, in remembrance of all this, be enthusiastic for homopathy ?\n\nAll this is nothing compared to the sufferings Hahnemann experienced when living in Leipzig, persecuted by the old school doctors and apothecaries. His wife up braided him daily for not doing like other doctors, whose equal he was in learning, and who made money with which to keep their families from starving.\n\nHahnemann's son Frederick had become a hunchback in consequence of a wagon overturning with him when a child, on one of the many movings, from place to place, the father was forced to make.\n\nAlso my hand, my right hand, I owe to Hahnemann. Why should not I be grateful and enthusiastic for homopathy ?\n\nShould we not be kicked, I (Dr. Knerr) said to Farrington, \"if we open our mouths to complain ?\"\n\nAt Raue's House.\n\nIn the evening I called for Mrs. Hering, who was visiting at the house of Dr. and Mrs. Raue, on Tenth Street. I there met Dr. Starkey and Mrs. Peltzer, the wife of a student at Hahnemann. Mrs. Raue entertained us by playing exquisitely on the piano. How well these dear German people know how to enjoy themselves We had wine and cake, laughed and sang, and there were good nights and good-night kisses, at parting, with invitations soon to come again.\n\nBerridge.\n\nHering wrote a letter to Mc Clatchey, editor of the Hahnemann Monthly magazine, calling attention to Dr. Berridge's repertory, which he thinks is the clearest and best, so far. \"As many of us,\" he says, \"as do not wish to eat what others have chewed, ought to get the book !\"\n\nMotion.\n\nThere are four kinds of motion : (1) Up and down ; (2) From side to side ; (3) Forward and backward-the motion of the rocking chair, and (4) the swing. The first is the motion of health, enjoyed by babies. The baby-jumper is an excellent invention for the nursery. The second is not health, but not quite as bad as the third, which is most detrimental to women and children, causing all manner of diseases with them. No person can stand a rocking chair in the long run. A fourth motion, that of swinging around in a circle, is the worst of all motions.\n\nThe Fair.\n\nAn old lady suggested that Dr. Hering get some oak wood from the old Lutheran Church at Fourth and Cherry Streets, where reconstruction is going on, and make relics out of it to be sold at the Fair. I went to a Mr. W. and bespoke a load of the wood to be used for this purpose, from which were fashioned brackets, paper knives, etc., which brought a good price at the Fair.\n\nIn the evening Dr. Gause brought printed copies of an Appeal to Homopathic Physicians for Aid for the Fair. The word Similia was misspelled, and one thousand copies had to be corrected.\n\nRaue.\n\nWe went again to Dr. Raue's house to celebrate his wife's birthday. It happened to be a rather dry affair and Dr. Hering slept through the better part of the evening. We could not get warmed up, on this occasion.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 6, 1869.\n\nHampel. Arsenic. Aconite. Lippe.\n\nHempel posed as a scholar in Materia medica. He was extremely ignorant in general practice and scarcely knew the difference between two medicines. He did a lot of translating and brought out a huge volume on Materia medica. At a meeting of the Institute, held in St. Louis, he boasted that he had studied the subject considerably When he was Professor of Materia medica, in Philadelphia, he wrote a New Organon, in which he defended free love. There were but a limited number of copies printed, some twenty or forty, which later went for waste paper.\n\nIn Canada there was a certain married man by the name of King, who fell in love with another woman and gave his wife powders for the ostensible purpose of making a proving. The woman died from arsenical poisoning. The man was arrested and put on trail. Hempel was subpoenad to give testimony in the case. He went to Canada for this purpose, and appeared in court where he was to give his opinion. He was asked : What constitutes an allopathic dose of arsenic ?' He mentioned some mistaken quantity and an authority, quoted at random, and obscure names, which disgusted the jury. He was asked whether large doses of the poison were permitted under homopathic treatment, and whether patients ever died from them. Hempel answered : 'Oh we try not to kill them The witness was removed from the trial in disgust and the jury unanimously found King guilty of murdering his wife, whose body had been exhumed and found full of arsenic. The murderer was hung. Hempel's testimony was not mentioned in the Judge's summary. His own lawyers were disappointed in their witness.\n\nIn the Michigan University there was to be instituted a chair for homopathic Materia medica. A lady living in the town, who had been a patient of Dr. Lippe, in Philadelphia, was appointed to look for a genuine homopath to fill the vacancy. She was taken ill and sent for a young physician in the town, a homopath, who came to see her. The patient asked for tumblers in which to prepare the medicine. The young doctor said : 'I will have no use for the tumblers' 'Why not ?' 'Because I wish to treat my patients, as Hahnemann did, with powders. 'You are the right one,' said the lady.\n\n\"She then wrote an account of this to Dr. Lippe, who on learning that Hempel was trying for the professorship at Michigan, promptly consulted Dr. Hering in the matter, who then showed to Lippe the papers from Canada, containing an account of the trial of King, revealing the ignorance and disgrace of Hempel. Lippe sent the papers to the lady, whose husband was influential in politics. Hempel's standing was investigated by the physicians who attended the wife, also through correspondence with Lippe, which brought down the wrath of Hempel upon his head.\"\n\nSome years later, when the Institute was to meet in New York, a man from the West came to Hering to enlist his influence in making Hempel president of that association. The man mentioned the opposition from Dr. Lippe. Hering said : \"It was I who gave Lippe the papers and told him to send them.\"\n\nIt was reported, later, when Hempel was in the West, that he had an affair with a divorced woman, which resulted in the birth of twins, that these soon died after being taken to Hempel's home, with symptoms of Aconite poisoning. Not long after, the mother also died of similar symptoms.\n\nAt one time Hempel tried to introduce this woman to Mrs. Hering, which was \"No go,\" the doctor says. For which reason, and the sending of the papers, Hempel opposed everything that came from Dr. Hering ; even the Lachesis was condemned as being \"no remedy,\" an assertion made by Hempel in his Materia medica.\n\nHistory.\n\n\"The first inhabitants of Europe were a barbarous race of people which came from Asia. They were followed by the Gauls, also from Asia. These destroyed the barbarians which gave rise to the Epistle to the Galatians. The French are descendants from these. After the Gauls came the Aryans, who came from the Caucesus and from these were the Teutons and other Germanic races. After them came Aryans as also are the Normans. After the Slavs came the Moors, who were opposed by the Catholics, which opposition caused a religious war. Later came the Huns, who settled in Hungary, and many centuries later the Turks, who were scattered by King Charles.\"\n\nCollege. The Fair.\n\nThere is now a great disturbance going on among the members of the Faculty over a disposition to be made of the money realized from the Fair. Professor Morgan came to say that the money must go into an endowment fund for the college, but must be put out at interest, at six per cent, which is contrary to Hering's ideal, also opposed whom are dissatisfied with Morgan's attitude, such contention being likely to ruin the Fair. All that the Ladies, who work for the Fair, are interested in is raising as large a sum of money as possible for the purpose of building a hospital, caring little about the form of investment of the capital. In order to bring the quarrel to an end and save the enterprise, Hering, with great determination, says : \"I will see that my plans are carried out and put through !\"\n\nOne is here reminded of the attitude of Marcus Pontius Cato, the Roman Senator, of whom Hering says : \"When his mind was made up, he allowed nothing to stand in the way of accomplishment.\" When Cato had decided that Carthage must be destroyed he never missed an opportunity to make known his will. When he voted \"Yea\" in the forum, he always finished with : \"And Carthage must be destroyed.\" If he voted \"Nay\" he added : \"But Carthage must be destroyed.\" And Carthage was destroyed Cato was a negative man. Our Benjamin Franklin, also a man with a determined will, was a positive man also thrifty, who, when he saw a piece of rag lying on the street, picked it up and said : \"It cost a deal of work to make it !\"\n\nHering often says concerning the last drop of wine in the bottle : \"We must count the drops. There is an ancient saying among people in Germany that every drop of wine costs seven drops of sweat, to grow it. Wine cannot be manufactured. It must grow.\". So Hering, too, is a positive man who has to fight a great deal with the rest of the faculty.\n\nThe Fair.\n\nGause made a misstatement, in a circular concerning the Fair, in which he asks for a hundred thousand dollars to be raised ; an amount out of reason and not to be expected.\n\nCollege. Macfarlan.\n\nDr. Hering is bound to have Macfarlan in the faculty. In this he succeeded against great opposition from some of the members.\n\nSatire.\n\nHering, when an allopath, before coming over to homopathy, wrote a skit against Hahnemann, a burlesque. The theatrical manager of the town could not get his company to play it. They were all staunch homopaths Hearing says he never told Hahnemann about this.\n\nTheatre Beauty.\n\nHering once saw the famous play, Kaetchen von Heilbronn, played by a very homely girl who won her laurels by her meekness and modesty.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 9, 1869.\n\nHerbariums. Botany.\n\nHering helped his friend Weigel in Surinam to press three thousand plants. The plants were sent to South America from the Academy of Natural Sciences, in Philadelphia, to be assorted and pressed.\n\nInstructions, \"The plants are first laid carefully upon some sheets of blotting paper. Newspapers will do. Parts of the plant must not touch. A leaf must not touch a stem ; slips of paper must be put between, also between the petals of flowers. Lay the sheet of paper containing the plant between two pads of brown, or any common paper, and these upon a board, or a table, with a weight on top. Proceed in this manner until you have a pile of them. Pass a string around the parcel and draw it moderately tight. The important thing is to press the plants gradually. At intervals of a few days the string will bear tightening, while the plants shrink and begin to dry. Should moist plants get mouldy take them out of the paper to dry, and also dry the paper before putting back the plants.\"\n\nGradual force. The Story of the Tick. Prolapsus Uteri.\n\nHering's principle in all mechanical operations is to go to work gradually : which is illustrated by the following story told by Hering :\n\n\"While still a boy, going into the woods berrying with my sister, she got a tick fastened upon her back. Later she came to me crying, saying : 'She had a tumor on her back, which hurt, and she did not wish to tell father because he would send for a doctor to whom she would have to expose her body, and she would rather die than consent to this.' I went to work on the offending insect to pry it loose, but sister said : 'If you pull off its body, its head will remain in the flesh and I will die' I took hold of the insect, pressed its body gently, but very gradually, as you might when holding a pen. At first the tick pinched harder, as all living things will do when attacked, but the pressure, applied slowly, unflinchingly, as moves the minute hand on a clock, compelled the insect to let go and my sister was relieved. I had performed my first surgical operation !\"\n\n\"Mrs. L-- a patient with prolapsus uteri sent for me to give her medical treatment but objected to an examination, thinking that her obstetrician was the one to perform this. When finally persuaded to allow me to make an examination I found the womb low down. I touched the os uteri very gently, but firmly, and exerted very gradual pressure, diverting her attention the while form the operation by conversation, when, all at once, the womb went back into its place and the patient experienced great relief. Eminent medical talent is sometimes unable to succeed in similar cases of wedged-in uteri, which may be quite painful. I prescribed Belladonna, and there was no further trouble. This remedy overcomes spasm of the sphincter muscles in all orifices of the body.\"\n\nFish. Taxidermy.\n\n\"The bodies of fishes may be beautifully prepared for preservation in the following manner. Take a perfect specimen, lay the fish upon a board on its side, the best side uppermost ; the one you wish to preserve. Cut the under side of the fish, from tail to head, with a sharp knife, remove the body and scrape the skin carefully and rub it with lime, or common wood-ashes, stuff the skin with cotton and sew it into shape. When the fish is dried you can mount it upon a board. If the colors have faded they can be revived by suitable pigments applied with a brush.\"\n\nSt. Peters Cathedral in Rome. Prophecies.\n\n\"The cupola of the world-famous cathedral will fall, and the Cathedral at Cologne, one of whose spires has remained unfinished for a couple of centuries, will soon be completed and at the same time Germany will become united, two problems which in the minds of the people have long been considered improbable, if not impossible of solution. The cupola of St. Peters, as is known, has had a crack, ingeniously mended by heavy bands of iron placed around it. These were heated then allowed to cool, which caused them to shrink and hold tight the damaged structure.\"\n\nWhen the writer made a tour of Italy in 1872-3, he visited the Dome of St. Peters in Rome, was given permission to mount to the roof of the immense structure, and found there the iron-band described by Hering, while on the inside of the cupola wee seen men at work, on a scaffold, repairing cracks in the ceiling.\n\nAt the same time, when visiting Cologne on the Rhine, he beheld the completed spire pointing aloft, while Germany had become united under Bismarck, as predicted by Hering.\n\nHering thinks he has inherited a gift for foretelling events, from an ancestor in Saxony, who was known as the Prophet on the Elbe, about whom a book was written under the title of the Man from Prossen, in which is foretold the fortification of the Lilenstein against the invasion of Napoleon's army, a feat then believed impossible of accomplishment by strategists.\n\nObelisk.\n\n\"A fallen obelisk in Egypt had to be raised and no one knew how to go about it. A young man who thought he had a plan which would do the job, went to the king and offered to raise the obelisk, or lose his head if failing in the attempt. He made the trial with new ropes made wet, which, by causing a shrinking, gradually lifted the obelisk to its place.\"\n\nParentage. Birth. Inherited Characteristics.\n\n\"From my father I learned uprightness and truth. From my grandfather Schroeder I learned humor and drollery. He was won't to say, 'Here, boy, is threepence ; run and buy me some snuff ! Run ; tuck your feet under your arms, and don't let the grass grow under you !' \"\n\nMy father was an organist, second to none in all Germany. He was headmaster at the school in Oschatz and played the organ in the church there. He often played in Leipzig, on which occasions the church was crowded. They called him Magister, a title signifying Master of Arts, or in later times Doctor of Philosophy.\n\nOn the first of January, 1800, about midnight, when my father was playing-in the New Year at the church organ, in Oschatz, it happened that my mother was in childbirth and I was being born. Our neighbor, Zoellner by name, was walking up and down before the house, which adjoined the church, waiting for the maid to bring word as soon as the child had arrived, so that he could carry the news to father, who was seated at the organ. He had not long to wait when godfather Zoellner hurried to father's side and whispered in his ear, 'Herr Magister, it is a boy' Thereupon pealed forth a burst of praise in the good old Chorale of Martin Luther : Nun danket alle Gott, (Let all give thanks to God) so dear to every German heart. The trumpet-angels attached to the organ, sent forth their hallelujahs, heralding the advent of a new century and with it the birth of a son.\n\n\"On the following day, when there was snow on the ground, the parents believing in the hardening process, the child was carried out of doors. My grandmother told me that the child was blue when he was brought into the house. My father, who had lost his first-born son, said : 'This one must live The other one was weakened by too much coddling' \"\n\n* * *\n\nMay 11, 1869.\n\nBiography.\n\nI received from Mrs. Hering a biographic sketch of Hering in pamphlet form.\n\nNorton. A Patient.\n\nI called this morning on a wealthy patient of Dr. Hering, who lives in a brown-stone mansion on Arch Street ; a banker. This man has been a patient for a number of years, suffering from a chronic neuralgic affection of the head. Of late it was reported that this patient had, contrary to Hering's advice, been taking sulphur baths. The object of my visit was to invite him to the Fair. Mrs. Hering had tried to induce the doctor to make this visit himself, hoping thereby to keep the man for a patient, but Hering proudly said : \"On no account will I make a visit to a patient unasked. Never Even if I had no practice at all !\"\n\nMagister Hering.\n\nSeated at the Organ Playing-In the Century on the Occasion of the Birth of His Son, Constantine. January 1, 1800. at Oschatz. Saxony. This Drawing Was Copied from an Original Sketch by Hermann Faber. Artist, of Philadelphia.\n\nCollege Journal.\n\nHering has trouble with Martin, co-editor on the College Journal, who arrogantly writes things which Hering neither hears of, nor sees, until they get into print.\n\nMortgage.\n\nDr. Hering speaks of placing a mortgage upon his property for the benefit of the College and Hospital. He fears he might die and his family get the money. He says : \"My family shall not have it. I do not wish it so. It is for the cause.\" For the cause he would sacrifice all.\n\nLaus in History.\n\n\"In history there are laws. The laws bring about events. These laws are just as harmonious as those governing astronomy. Their workings are as certain as the motion of the planets. To what end, otherwise, are the countless multitudes of insects, called men, placed upon the earth.\"\n\nMartha Washington. Hahnemann.\n\nOne time, in a debate, I maintained that America would never have been freed if it had not been for Martha Washington.\n\nMrs. Washington was a rich young widow belonging to one of the noblest families in the Colonies when she married the young lieutenant whose fine traits she admired. At Valley Forge, when almost dead from hardship, and loss of spirits, Washington declared that he would not give up but if necessary would retire with his army beyond the Rocky mountains, and keep fighting while retreating. It was Martha Washington who had the courage to make a long and dangerous journey from Virginia, through winter snows, to the camp at Valley Forge. She said to her husband : 'You must keep on. You dare not lose courage !'\n\n\"We must always take into account the hardships people endure while working in the interest of a great cause. We think of Hahnemann flying from his persecutors in Leipzig with his family, in a wagon, which upset, killing one of his boys outright and making a cripple of another (Frederick) for life.\"\n\nRevolutionary War. The Ginger Bread Baker.\n\nBefore the revolution a German baker came to this country to make his gingerbread. He had a ready sale for his ware and made quite a sum of money. He used to peddle his stock on the streets. He was an amiable man who talked a mixture of languages. At the time Mrs. Washington came to Valley Forge the impossibility to succeed stared everyone in the face, for there was no money. A meeting was held in the State House, in Philadelphia, where the Gingerbread Man came and sat on a barrel listening to a report that General Washington could not carry on the war because there was no money in the treasury. The Gingerbread Man jumped on top of his barrel and made a speech in which he said : 'Here is a hundred pounds, all the money I have ; it is for General Washington to do with as he please.' When he had finished his speech he dismounted from the barrel, swore like a trooper, and asked the men who were present to follow his example. All present followed his example, not the swearing, but the contributing of money for the cause. When Washington found out about the gingerbread baker's act, he looked him up and thanked him in the Pennsylvania German dialect, which he had learned to speak, and offered the baker a position to bake for the army.\n\nThe story is told that in contraction for bread to be delivered for the army, Washington asked that an equivalent in weight of a pound of bread for as much flour, should be given. Again the Gingerbread Man began to swear, now, more than before, at the dishonesty of such a contract. He said to the General : 'You have been tricked by a lot of scoundrels in accepting such a dishonest bargain.' He explained the matter to Washington ; how the weight of the water and other ingredients that go into the baking would have to be estimated as additional weight, which would demand a larger supply of bread. Washington patted him on the back, called him an honest man admitted that he had been cheated.\n\nHering thinks it likely that Martha Washington herself may have gone to Philadelphia to talk with the Ginger bread Man. It would have been like her, he says.\n\nMarried Life.\n\nI have often observed that if a man loses his wife by death, who has given him a great deal of trouble during their married life, he will mourn her loss more than if their union had been a happier one. Vice versa also obtains.\n\nThomas.\n\nDr. Thomas, who has been seriously ill, with typhlitis, is recovering, but looks haggard and is weak. Hering has a very high opinion of Thomas and would have been at a loss to replace him, in the chair of anatomy, if he had passed on. Dr. Martin had suggested McClatchey as a substitute.\n\nCollege. Carpenter.\n\nI never saw Hering so pleasantly excited as he is this evening while telling the following story : \"Dr. Koch hired an old carpenter to fix up the College museum. The old carpenter hired two more men to help him. They took it easy. The writer can testify that he never came to the museum but he found one, or all of these men resting or lounging about, and Dr. Hering says he sometimes found them asleep when he went there. In short they had worked six long weeks on a job that three carpenters could have easily done in half the time. Their contract called for the sum of one hundred and twenty-five, to thirty dollars. An order for some additional cases was given, which annulled the contract, so the carpenter now demands three hundred and fifty dollars for the entire job and threatens the college with a lawsuit if his demands are not complied with.\"\n\nThis afternoon the landlord of the carpenter came to Dr. Hering to ask if any money had been paid. \"One hundred and fifty dollars,\" was the answer. The man became furious. \"So he has lied to me,\" he said. \"I will turn him into the street tomorrow morning !\" Wait, said the doctor, \"I will tell you how we can prevent two lawsuits In the first place you will not sue the carpenter for his rent, and in the second the carpenter will not have to sue the college ; for if he does, the college will have to pay him the balance on the three hundred and fifty, since Judge and Jury, in America, generally decide in favor of the workingman. So do not turn the man out, for in that case you will receive nothing. Send him to me and I will pay him seventy-five dollars, the amount of rent he owes you, and he must give us a receipt in full for the amount received.\" The landlord gave Dr. Hering a look as if to say, \"After all you are a business man !\" He went home, said he would talk to the man.\n\nAfter supper I heard a medley of voices in the front office. First Dr. Koch's then Dr. Hering's, also the carpenter's and that of his landlord.\n\nThe carpenter : \"You promised so and so. I'll go to court.\"\n\nThe landlord : \"You may I'll throw you out.\"\n\nDr. Hering : \"Go to court and be dammed !\"\n\nThe carpenter was obstinate, would not give a receipt in full for his excessive bill, and still threatened to go to court. After the combatants had gone, there was a tableau in the hall, of which Dr. Hering formed the centre ; about him his wife, sons and daughters, all displaying the greatest anxiety. The old man fairly shook with laughter, mainly at Dr. Koch, who had bungled the matter, saying : \"This perhaps will teach him a lesson, and take him down a peg !\"\n\n\"Our reverses\", he said, \"are as valuable to us as our gains.\"\n\nAn Aspirant for a Diploma.\n\nA strange thing happened to Dr. Hering this morning in his office hours. A young woman, recommended by Dr. Farrington, came and wished to know if she might attend the summer course of lectures at the college. Dr. A. from New York State had sent her to F., who sent her to Hering. She was in poor health, had suffered all through the winter with cough and spiting of blood, for which she had taken Phosphorus ; she also had a continuous coryza, still she desired a diploma. Dr. Hering was surprised, because at that time women were not co-eds, as now, but he referred her to the Registrar.\n\nIn spite of being a woman in precarious health, probably a consumptive, she still wishes to be a homopathic physician ; Her courage, if not her prudence, is to be admired.\n\nA Meeting of the Country Society. Gymnocladus.\n\nI escorted Father Hering to a meeting of the Country Society this evening. Arm in arm we went. He was more jolly than I had yet seen him. Nothing of great importance was transacted at the meeting. Dr. Guernsey arose and said a few words in favor of the much discussed Fair, thereby showing courage in the presence of opponents.\n\nWhen I had brought back Dr. Hering, we took seats in the back office where he talked to me for an hour before retiring. He told me of a proving he had made of the pulp of a bean from a tree in Washington Square, the Gymnocladus canadensis. In Kentucky the bean is used in the making of a substitute for coffee. Hering, too, tried the preparation, in company with some friends, but did not admire the beverage. \"The proving caused some fine symptoms, but no patient so far has been found with symptoms to correspond. They have some similarity to those of Belladonna. The pulp is used for a fly poison.\"\n\nThe Musca domestica is called Fliege in Northern Germany and Muecke in Southern Germany. In the North the mosquito is called Muecke. The Pennsylvania Germans owe a large part of their dialect to South Germany.\n\nPlants. Provings. Williamson. Jeanes. Bute.\n\nIn reference to provings to be made from plants, Williamson favors a distinction to be made between provings from the plant itself and those made from its active principle. They should be thrown together. Our Dr. Jeans did a great deal of proving. Likewise Bute, who introduced Daphne indica and Mezereum. Jeans made provings of the body-louse the lady apple, the Dolichos pruriens and Kino gummi.\n\nJeanes was satisfied to get one good symptom from a proving, on which he could prescribe. Guernsey admits that he got his idea of practicing by the keynote system, from Jeanes.\n\n\"We should always have three characteristic symptoms to a remedy before we prescribe it. There are to be considered : 1. Time. 2. Space. 3. Locality. The third refers to right and left side, front and back, up and down, etc. The first belongs to modality. Jeanes had a medicine for almost every spot on the body He classified headaches under the various regions assigned by phrenology.\"\n\nClinical Cases.\n\nDr. Raue began his studies by reading all the cases reported in Medical Journals, by which he soon acquired knowledge useful in prescribing.\n\nCollege Journal. Clinical Cases.\n\nDr. Hering still thinks Martin, co-editor of the college Journal, should submit copy of clinical matter to him before going to press. The June number is filled with cases which Hering has not had an opportunity to approve. Hering has in mind writing a book for young practitioners, but says he must first have a collection of a thousand cases for analysis.\n\nRemedies-Their Origin. Arum Triphyllum. Hamamelis.\n\nI got the Arum triphyllum (Jack-in-the-Pulpit) from an up-country Pennsylvania German who had it from an old woman. It became a valuable remedy for scarlet fever in its worst form. I was called to see three children located in a basement on Cherry Street. The eldest child was in the last stage of the sickness, evidently dying. The second was in the second stage and very sick. The third had just begun to sicken. I thought of the Pennsylvania Germans remedy, the Arum triphyllum, which I administered to each of the three children, in the sixth dilution. All three recovered.\n\nThe chief indications for the remedy are soreness of the mouth, cracked lips and salivation. I tried the remedy again soon after ; this time getting an aggravation, probably due to the use of a low potency ; higher ones were made use of later.\n\nHamamelis\n\n(witch hazel) was suggested to me by a consumptive at the point of death, who controlled his hemorrhages with a quack medicine, which he himself had introduced, and which made him rich, but which he kept a secret. A substance which can stop hemorrhages from a lung almost gone, must be a good remedy, I thought. The consumptive had a daughter who impressed me. She revealed to me the formula.\n\n\"Her father had planted acres with the witch hazel, had built a distillery by which to extract the sap from the bush during the month of February, when it is strongest, just before the flowering season, when all plants are strongest in sap. If it had not been for the daughter, I would not have had any time for a man who discovered a healing remedy and guarded its secret for material gain.\"\n\nThe Hering Family.\n\nHering has one brother, Karl and a sister living. One brother, Julius, died young. He says he must look up the living ones, if he again goes to Europe. If respectable, he says, he will recognize them. If not, he won't concern himself about them. His brother, Karl, is a renowned musician, whom Mendelssohn pronounced the greatest contrapuntist in Germany.\n\nThe Young Woman Who Desires a Diploma.\n\nThis would-be doctress spoke to Dr. Farrington and myself at the College this morning. She is desperate. She says she will get a degree if she has to go to France, or Germany for it. She says she has been thrice cured by homopathy.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 17, 1869.\n\nSignatura. Cranberries.\n\n\"Cranberry poultice, recommended for erysipelas, comes under the head of signatura, a very ancient doctrine, which has much to recommend it on the grounds of Similia.\"\n\nThe Lizard With the Broken Tail. Natures Mistake.\n\nA lizard which had broken its tail and afterwards, for want of surgical aid grew two tails, was to sent to a museum in Germany. It was intended to represent the old school notion of a Vis medicatrix naturæ. A satire on Schiller's expression, Suesse heilige Natur, fuehre mich auf deiner spur' (Sweet and holy nature, lead me in thy ways). The specimen did not reach the museum, at least I did not find it there. Nature needs both wisdom and art to guide it.\n\nGovernor Pollock and the Poor Man.\n\nA German by the name of Taxis, a simple hearted, honest man, lost his position as janitor at the United States Mint, when Governor Pollock became director of that institution. A son of Taxis, employed in the Union Bank, wrote a filial letter to Dr. Hering in behalf of his father, asking him to use his influence to get his father restored to his position, as on their combined salaries depended the sustenance of the family.\n\nUnthinkingly and ill-advisedly I undertook to call on the newly elected Governor at his church, where he instructed a Bible Class, early on a Sunday morning. Pollock said : \"I am sorry that you came on such a mission on a Sunday ; I cannot break the Sabbath !\"\n\nNext day I visited the Governor at his office, with a letter signed by Dr. Hering. The letter set forth, in flattering terms, the philanthropy, as well as the politics of the Governor, but it failed to move his honor, who said that he was overwhelmed with applications, three hundred of them being from women for whom he had only ten vacancies, Widows, he said come here with their children, weep, and moan, and sigh, enough to take the heart out of a man.\n\nA politician, I thought, with a heart ; a rara avis ! He further said that he was not in favor of men appointed under Johnson's administration, all of whom he had discharged and that he intended to appoint his own men. He thought there had been too many superfluous appointments. All of which boded ill for reinstatement of poor Taxis, and I went away feeling that my visit had proved a failure. Next day the son came to Dr. Hering with a twenty dollar bill, intended as a present for the Governor, but was told that probably a man as pious as the Governor would reject such a gift. I had my first lesson in politics.\n\nFirst Patient.\n\nToday, when Dr. Hering was standing in the doorway of the college, a lady passed. He said : \"That lady was my first patient when I came to Philadelphia.\"\n\nBetts.\n\nThis afternoon we had a visit from Dr. Betts, one of the younger men graduated from the College, who has just returned from Europe, where he spent some time in travel and some in making the acquaintance of homopathic physicians abroad. Dr. Betts, who could not speak the language a year ago, now speaks good German. He brought the news that Fleischmann, a homopath in Vienna, had died ; that Eidherr is ill with lung-disease, and that Haussman is not very old.\n\nDr. Hering says : \"Haussman is the only man who could bring me back over the ocean again.\" Betts showed pictures of German professors at Vienna ; Skoda and Rokitansky. Dr. Hering offers to tender him a reception.\n\nHering Family. Sons of the Third Wife.\n\nAs soon as his children were born Dr. Hering predicted what profession they would enter born Dr. Hering predicted what profession they would enter when grown up. When Rudolph, the eldest, was born his father said : \"This one will be an engineer.\" The next son, Walter, he said, \"will be a printer.\" Both of these predictions were fulfilled. The third son, Carl, was born with a caul, which is considered lucky. The mother asked : \"Why don't you say something for this ones future ?\" The father said : \"This one is to be a physician.\" In this case he erred. Carl became an electrical engineer.\n\nWhen the last of the sons, born to the father at the advanced age of sixty-three came into the world, he was named Hermann Siegfried, and his father said : \"This one, too, will be a physician, but the one before him, Carl, will be a surgeon.\"\n\nRudolph, the oldest, became prominent as a Sanitary Engineer, a builder of bridges and designer of plans for city drainage. All of the sons rose to eminence in their professions, efficient and honored for their attainments. Hermann, the youngest, at first a teacher, joined the ranks of Christian Scientists, in which he gained eminence as a practitioner, and at present is a lecturer of world fame. He is one of the directors in Mrs. Eddys Church.\n\nHepar Sulph.\n\nHering introduced Hepar sulph. calc. for the treatment of suppurations, as early as 1827, while in South America. About the same time Hartmann, in Germany, introduced Mercurius.\n\nKorndoerfer.\n\nHering predicts that Dr. Korndoerfer will some day become co-editor of the college Journal, also a member of the Faculty, which prophecy was not fulfilled though Korndoerfer was one of our leading homopathic physicians, extremely active for the cause and helpful to Hering in his literary work.\n\nThe Murder of Mrs. Rademacher. Finger-Prints.\n\nRademacher, who lived on Arch Street, was one of the early homopaths in Philadelphia. His wife was murdered in her room. Dr. Hering secured a piece of wood from a post on which was left the bloody imprint of the murderers hand. He placed this under a microscope and found that the hand, a delicate one, had left particles of shoe-makers wax in the impress. He said the murderer is a shoe-maker. The murderer, Langenfeld by name, was tried, found guilty and executed.\n\nWhile the criminal was in prison awaiting his execution, Hering suggested that his finger-prints be taken, but this was denied him. After the execution, Hering and some other physicians, were permitted to view the corpse. It was Dr. Hering's intention to take an impression from the hands, in wax, for comparison with the specimens obtained under the microscope ; but the hands of the cadaver were found cut and mutilated beyond recognition. This piece of vandalism had been committed by an eclectic who was jealous of a homopaths triumph in a matter of science.\n\nAnother murderer was discovered through the imprint of a bare foot on the floor of a mill, where some flour had been dropped. The murderer had the reputation of being an honest and god fearing man. Jealousy over a woman had been the incentive to the murder.\n\nThe Bertillon method was but little practiced at the time of these occurrences. Now we know that the lines in the human hand are singular and never duplicated.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 20, 1869.\n\nTrinks.\n\nTrinks, a German claiming to be a homopath, was a promoter of literature ; of books which others had written for him, one of which with the silly title, Das Handbuch auf dem Standpunkt, (The Handbook on a Standpoint) was a frequent mark for Dr. Hering's ridicule. Trinks, in ugliness and disposition, resembled the animal Gnu, and was so named by Hering on account of his irascible temper ; a sobriquet which stuck to him.\n\nExamination Before the Faculty of the University of Wuerzburg.\n\nFirst of all I had to pass a written examination. I was known to be a homopath, for which reason I met with great opposition which I had to overcome. I was made a butt for ridicule among my fellow-students. The faculty did not allow students to grow moustaches. I defied the custom and appeared before the faculty unshaven. I wished to show my independence, as a homopath, to the fullest, a dangerous thing to do, a thing which I would not advise a student of the present day to venture to do.\n\nA week before the regular examination the students were required to call upon their respective teachers to advise them of their intended appearance for examination.\n\nI first went before Texter, noted surgeon, who was terribly angry, and said : What is your wish ?' Professor I have come for examination.' For examination ?' said he very gruffly ; How, and in what manner do you ever expect to make your way in the world ?' I replied : Professor, I wish to go to Holland, and become a surgeon on broad ship in the navy'. He then asked in what subject I felt myself most interested. I told him, In the treatment of the peculiar wounds made by the splintering of wood on board ship.'\n\nOn examinations day we had to go to a large, dark hall. On the table stood an urn in which the professors deposited questions, written on slips of paper, which the students were required to draw and answer. The hall had an imposing appearance with its columns and dim walls. I sat down to one of the small tables and wrote my answer to the first question, which was followed by other questions and answers, promptly gathered by other questions and answers, promptly gathered by janitor in charge. To me the janitor remarked : 'What ! already finished ?' Next came the oral examination. I first appeared before the botanist, who sat in one of the window niches ; in a second niche sat another professor with his victim before him. The botanist was a mild, pleasant old gentleman. He had a small herbarium in his hand which he showed me and said : 'Can you tell me, may be, what this plant is called ?' I made the correct answer. He then handed me the herbarium and asked me to tell him names of all the plants in it with which I was familiar. I picked up one plant after another, laid them carefully to one side, after the manner of botanists, mentioning the name of each one after the other. I came to a strange plant in the collection which made me hesitate. The professor said : What is the name of that one ?' Oh That,' said I, is a new plant, discovered lately. I saw a picture of it in one of your works, professor.' I then named the plants according to other to which they belonged. Other professors were within hearing distance and no doubt thought, How can we manage to let this fellow through ; a homopath should not be allowed to graduate from our institution.'\n\nI next went before the physiologist. After him again came Texter, the surgeon. He pitched right into me with, What's this ? Whats the answer to that ?' and asked me as a test question : What are the various causes of cataract ?' I named the ordinary conditions ; eye-strain and traumatism as the most common, which, however, did not seem wholly to satisfy the professor, who said : What other cause is there for cataract ?' Schoenlein, who did not sit far off, overheard the question and said : I, myself, know of no other cause.' All were silent Texter said Old age is a cause of cataract' Schoenlein turned about in his chair and laughed in his sleeve !\n\nThe obstetrician on the faculty being absent, Texter examined me in that branch also. He questioned me in regard to the various positions and operations of childbirth. I explained these in the order of the three stages of parturition, which surprised the professor, but he wished to know if I could remember another. 'I do not.' Neither do I,' said he, with a smile. Then came the veterinary, whose examination I passed without any difficulty. Finally I came before Schoenlein, the man whose great Knowledge of pathology had lured me to Wuerzburg. Knowing my leaning to homopathy he questioned me on the Hahnemannian treatment of scarlet fever. Here I was at home and passed the examinations satisfactorily. In fact, I graduated with highest honors in all the departments. My nine months of study at Wuerzburg had enabled me to do this. Yet if Schoenlein had wished to be inimical to the young homopath he would have flunked me.\n\nA Woman-Hater.\n\nThe death of my second wife, Marianna Husmann, the mother of Max and Odelia, whom I loved dearly, affected my mind to such a degree that for a long time I felt a strange antipathy to all womankind. On the day of my wife's funeral I was in an exalted state of mind, which made me talk inordinately, without being aware of what was happening. My dislike of women became so extreme that I no longer wished to have them come to consult me. Such was the extent of my disaffection that I would have been seriously injured in my practice thereby.\n\nFortunately I was cured in a way corresponding to the law of Similia. Fanny Ellser, famous German dancer of that period had arrived at New York. One of my friends coming from there to see me, spoke highly of the great art displayed by this woman, who from patriotic reasons, had refused to be advertised as a French danseuse. 'I am a German,' she said, 'and will appear before the public as such.' This feeling to her nationality inspired me, and when she came to dance in Philadelphia, I went together with my friend, Professor Knorr, to the Academy of Music to witness the ballet. The subject of this was a fairy tale in which a goddess descends to the earth, takes on the form of a mortal, and falls in love with a man, whom she marries. Her husband clips her wings, treat her cruelly, and she dies. Angels descends from heaven and take her up on a sunny cloud.\n\nThis beautiful exhibition of woman's tenderness and devotion, so often unappreciated by ordinary husbands, who too late discover the worth of those who have loved and cherished them when on earth, now left to grieve and wonder why they could have been so cruel, with only the hope left them of a reunion in a better world, which should lead every man toward heaven, all of which made a deep impression upon my sick mind.\n\nIt was Fanny Ellser, the woman, faithful to her nationality, the charming talented artist, who with her inimitable interpretation of the fairy tale, brought back health and reason to me, the bereaved physician. In earlier days I had disapproved of the ballet ; could see neither art nor reason in its artificiality as I then considered it.\n\nIn his youth Hering had seen dancing in Amsterdam which affected him adversely. He wrote about this in a letter before departing for South America. It was six years after the loss of Marianna, who was his second wife, before he could make up his mind to marry again a third time, Therese Bucheim, daughter of an old school physician, in Germany.\n\nReligion. Gaertner. Creed.\n\nWhat would this great work of the Creator be if there were no hereafter ? I do not know what will become of my children if I should die, but I know there is a God who will take care of them. I cannot see how men can be unbelievers. My friend, Carl Gaertner, musician, does not believe. I try to help him to believe and already he begins to think there might be a heaven.\n\n\"My simple creed is short and to the point-To love the truth because it is true, the good because it is good, and to shun evil because it is evil. Christianity consists in leading useful lives, for the good of the race, and from unselfish motives. In spite of there being natural laws, to man is given a free will to act according to the dictates of his conscience.\"\n\nThe following statement, \"A Confession of Faith,\" written in German and addressed to his sons, was but lately discovered by me among Hering's papers, translated and printed for distribution among friends. It is a record in brief of a practical belief, to which no one can take exception :\n\nIt is great good fortune for a man to believe in a God. Fervently, with all his heart, will all his mind, with all his soul, constantly and enduringly. It should be quite impossible for him to think that this great truth could be an error ; he knows it is to be true. All of us have come forth from God. He cares for us all. He does not care more for one than for another. He cares for all alike. He gives to everyone as much, or as little, as he is willing to receive. He will show to everyone his way according to his understanding. He always gives the right, always the best, and always what is most beneficial.\n\nIn spite of the many unaccountable happenings, shortcomings, and undeniable incongruities, also the very many follies man has committed, and the mistakes he diligently continues to make, the world still remains a pleasant pleasure place to live in. Aside from the circumstance that after all we have to take the world as it is, we must acknowledge the ingenious arrangement, as it might be called, by which everyone is given full freedom to act, and to choose, according to his lights.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 21, 1869.\n\nPow-Wowing.\n\n\"We should not condemn pow-wowing, for we have no reason for so doing ; we must neither accept nor condemn a thing without a reason.\"\n\nPhysiology. Nerve Currents.\n\n\"I believe, with Swedenborg, that the nerves contain a gaseous substance which circulates from the periphery to the centre, through the sensory nerves, and from the centre, to the periphery through the motor nerves. In sleep this current is reversed. Medicines placed upon the tongue are there changed to a nerve-gas which is transmitted to diseased parts.\"\n\nWould this explain the lightning-like cures as mentioned by P. P. Wells (See Eulogies,) also observed by others. Hering wonders if the metals contained in a battery are dissolved, disintegrated and thus pass on through the wires and says : \"Now we have only the effects from copper and zinc. Other metals might come into use.\"\n\n* * *\n\nMay 22, 1869.\n\nIce and Ice-Water. Charcoal.\n\n\"Americans cannot realize their rapid progress as a nation. They will not readily believe that it is only a short time since such a thing as ice was introduced. Ice came into general use in 1833. I had a patient by the name of Geisse, a lay homopath (who had sat at the table with Hahnemann), at whose house I met a Frenchman by the name of Moliere, who spoke about introducing ice into Philadelphia. He secured a farm near the Schuylkill River, on which he led the water he built a tank the size of a city block into which he led the water from a spring and allowed it to freeze, cut the ice and built an ice-house, the first on the American continent. This was in 1833-34.\"\n\nHering tells how his first glass of ice-water made him ill and how Carbo vegetabilis cured him. Hence the characteristic bad effects from cold drinks, so often since verified in practice.\n\nCastor Oil After Childbirth.\n\nHering was the first to condemn the giving of castor oil on the third day after childbirth, which was almost universally done to produce a bowel movement with the lying in. Hering claims that the seventh day after childbirth is the natural time for a passage ; if it does not come then, give a dose of Bryonia, or Nux Vomica. The old practice of purging has been largely abandoned and in consequence, together with better sanitary methods of delivery, there has been far less of puerperal fever and its fatal consequences.\n\nSurinam. Climate.\n\n\"In Surinam the heat is more supportable than here. There are the breezes from the sea. People live near the coast. None in the interior. Between noon and four p.m. the people are in their houses and sleep. At four they dress and go out of doors.\"\n\nBiography. Peppich. Lachesis.\n\n\"I was teacher in an institution in Dresden, under Blochmann, whence I was sent to Surinam, by way of Cayenne, for the purpose of making zoological and botanical researches, and collections for the museum of the King of Saxony. About the same time a man by the name of Peppich was sent there, on a similar errand, by some rich men from Philadelphia. Peppich was bitten by the serpent lachesis trigonocephalus, but was saved by applying radiate heat from a heated gold coin. We both remained in Surinam for six years. I made collections, with help of Weigel the botanist, for one year, then devoted myself to the practice of homopathy. Peppich made collections in all of that time.\"\n\n* * *\n\nMay 24, 1869.\n\nA Boa Constrictor. Weigel.\n\nMy friend, Weigel, the botanist, went one day into the jungle with his gun. He trod on a large boa-constrictor which lay concealed in the grass. He felt the huge snake moving under his feet. He bounded across it but left his gun behind him. He heard a fearful hissing. Growing faint he leaned against neighboring tree where he imagined himself safe from the monster. The hissing became louder and louder. He saw the snake drag its length through the grass, finally its tail. She was drawing herself into a coil ready for a spring. Although a courageous man, who had faced shot and shell, now his courage failed him, he grew faint. He rallied, and with a desperate bound he reached his gun. He now had a means of defence. The hissing ceased. Weigel thought discretion the better part of valor and made tracks for home. He arrived weak and faint, became ill, and had to keep his bed for seven days.\n\nWe went to the place where the snake had been seen and found a place as large as an ordinary sized room where the grass had been beaten down. I tied a live kid to a tree, hoping that the snake would swallow the bait, become helpless and so be dragged in by a rope, but though I kept watch for a long time, the python did not again appear. I think the kid was eaten by the natives.\n\nWhen a boa sees her prey she fastens her tail to a fixed point, a stake or a small tree, from which she can shoot out her coils to envelope the animal and strangle it, which she could not accomplish otherwise. While she is preparing to attack she rapidly turns her head from side to side, keenly watching for the moment when her victim comes within reach. She opens wide her mouth ; with her tail fastened to the tree, she darts her length forward and with her poisonless fangs fastened into the animal, her muscles contracting, she pulls it to the ground, where she wraps her coils around it, tightens them until the victims bones are crushed in her powerful strangle-hold. As soon as she thinks she has vanquished her prey, she glides her head forward to the mouth of the animal and listens. If she hears another gasp or breath, she tightens her coils like lightning and gives another squeeze to finish the victim, after which she opens her mouth wide to give one loud blowing sound, an expiration by which she completely empties her lung, a single sac, the other lung having become atrophied to leave room for the one which extends almost through the entire length of her body. When she has completely emptied the air she closes her mouth and begins to refill her single lung with fresh air. The air enters her nostril and fills her mouth. When the mouth is full she gives a gulp and swallows the air. This process is continued until the lung is filled. She does this because in the act of swallowing her prey, there is a pressure on her larynx which prevents more air from entering.\n\nShe now proceeds to swallow the animal, but does not cover it with saliva before the act of swallowing. The saliva runs freely as she swallows. With the aid of her coils, still wrapped about the animals body, she pushes it down her throat. When this is accomplished the huge serpent is helpless and may be carried away. The only possible danger, negroes say, is from receiving a blow from her powerful tail, which they say could kill a man.\n\nHering was eyewitness to what is here related of the boa-constrictor, which inhabits the jungle about Surinam. He kept a young of the species as a pet. He trained it by feeding it as often as it grew hungry. He sometimes allowed her to wrap herself around his neck ; once, he says, she squeezed a little too tight, and sometimes licked his nose mouth, which he did not like.\n\nOle Bull, Violinist.\n\nWith Dr. Hering's niece, Bertha, I attended a farewell concert given to Ole Bull before his departure for Europe. The aged virtuoso glides on to the stage like a ghost. He has grey hair and wrinkles. He keeps his eyes fixed upon his old brown instrument, from which, with astonishing virtuosity, he draws the most perfect sounds. He favored the audience with our national airs The Star Spangled Banner, Hail Columbia and Yankee Doodle, also Home Sweet Home, with which he made great effect. There is a trifle of the charlatan about him ; for instance, a trick of keeping his ear close to the violin, while his bow, with a diamond set in the end of it, is kept moving for some time after the last faint tone has become audible.\n\n* * *\n\nMay 26, 1869.\n\nLiebig. Chemist. Lord Bacon.\n\nHering asks Dr. Neidhard, who is about to sail for Europe, when he goes to Münich and visits Liebig, who is on friendly terms with Neidhard's relatives, to tell him that there are three things about Liebig Dr. Hering always speaks of in his lectures to his students.\n\n1-That Liebig was a school-mate of a certain man who told story to Hering. It happened on examination day at the High School. Each student was asked, by the professor, what occupation he had chosen for his life-work. When the turn came to Liebig, the boy was silent. Well, Liebig, what are you going to be ?' Liebig stood up and said : I am going to be a chemist.' At first all in the room were silent, then came a burst of loud laughter.\n\n2-Liebig went to Paris to a famous chemist, for whom he offere"
