        "text": "There is an growing body of research supporting the use of homeopathy. However, many poorly conducted studies tend to get more coverage by a vocal subset of the scientific community and the media. While the number of high quality studies is growing, there still is positive evidence that homeopathy can effectively treat a wide variety of conditions. A site that I like to find out more about homeopathy research is the Homeopathy Research institute. A good place to start is their frequently asked question section to clear up any common confusion about homeopathy and homeopathic research. Click here to read more from the Homeopathic Research Institute.\n\nAre Naturopathic doctors and acupuncturists trained in homeopathy?\n\nNaturopathic doctors take many courses in homeopathy and commonly incorporate it into their practice. I worked on multiple clinical shifts focused specifically on homeopathy and used it as the only treatment method. Oriental medicine providers in the state of Ohio are able to prescribe homeopathic remedies. Make sure to check in with your provider about their extent of homeopathic training.\n\nAre homeopathy and naturopathy the same thing?\n\nNo. This is a very common question and a point of confusion for many people. Homeopathy and naturopathic medicine are separate yet related fields. Naturopathic medicine is a multidisciplinary medical field that includes training in homeopathy, botanical medicine, naturopathic manipulation, nutrition, and natural supplementation. In some states naturopathic doctors can perform acupuncture, prescribe medication, perform IV's and injections, and perform minor surgery. Trained homeopaths focus solely on homeopathy.\n\nWhere can I learn more about homeopathy?"
