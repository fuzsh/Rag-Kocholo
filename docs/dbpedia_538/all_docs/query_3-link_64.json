        "text": "The word homeopathy is derived from two Greek words: ‘homoios’ which means ‘similar’ and ‘pathos’ which means ‘suffering’. Homeopathy is a medical system that was developed in Germany, more than 200 years ago. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), homeopathy is currently the second largest system of primary healthcare in the world. As per the Homeopathy Research Institute, there are around 200 million people, using homeopathic medicines, across the world.\n\nWhat are Homeopathic Medicines?\n\nHomeopathy is a medical science that uses specially prepared, highly diluted substances with an aim of triggering the body’s own healing mechanisms. According to a research study by NCCIH, the basic preparations of homeopathic medicines are derived from different sources, including plants and minerals. Their active principles are extracted into various solvents and the liquid homeopathic medicine is poured into small, highly porous and absorbent sugar globules. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — approved laboratories, prepare homeopathic medicines under strict rules and regulations, from authentic sources. The homeopathic remedies inside these white sugar pills, aim to treat various health conditions.\n\nHomeopathic medicines made as sugar pellets are to be placed under the tongue; they also come in other forms, such as ointments, gels, drops, creams and tablets. The homeopathic medicine stimulates your nerves directly when it is kept below your tongue and this action starts within a few seconds of its consumption. Therefore, a patient experiences symptomatic relief in a few minutes after consuming the homeopathic medicine.\n\nAlso read: https://www.drbatras.ae/homeopathy/overview\n\nWhat are the Key Homeopathic Principles?\n\nHomeopathic treatment was founded by a German physician Dr Samuel Hahnemann, based on a few unconventional theories, such as:\n\nLaw of similars’ — homeopathic remedies use the body's own abilities to treat various ailments. This is in fact is the same principal behind vaccination and was discovered, when Louis Pasteur (the father of vaccinations) was only 8 years old. For example, the homeopathic remedy, Allium Cepa, made from red onion, can help you overcome cold or allergies in which you may have similar symptoms like (watery eyes, runny nose or sneezing) when you chop onions.\n\nLaw of infinitesimal dose’ —homeopathic remedies have great effectiveness with the lowest dosage of medication. Many homeopathic preparations are so diluted that no molecules of the original substance, remain. This process of progressive dilution is called potentization. The greater the dilution of an original substance; the greater is the potency of a homeopathic medicine!\n\n‘Law of homeopathy treatment’ — the patient’s symptoms are part of a continuous process of change and indicate movement towards greater health or illness.\n\n‘Totality of symptoms’ — All the symptoms need to be taken into consideration, when prescribing a homeopathic medicine to the patient.\n\nHow does the Homeopathy Treatment Work?\n\nHomeopathic medicines trigger the body's ability to heal itself by stimulating a precise reaction in the body, against the symptoms.\n\nSo, a homeopathy doctor prescribes a medicine that is able to cause certain symptoms in healthy people. These homeopathic medicines have the ability to treat these similar symptoms in a patient, as well. When the body reacts against the homeopathy treatment it reacts against the symptoms too; thus, treating the patients.\n\nWhat are the Key Benefits of the Homeopathy Treatment?\n\nHomeopathy is used for an extremely wide range of health conditions. Individuals usually seek homeopathic treatment for: asthma, skin infections, allergy, mental illness, such as stress and depression, or anxiety.\n\nHomeopathic treatment is ‘individualised’ or ‘customised’ for each patient. It’s common for different people with the same ailment to receive different homeopathy treatment. Homeopathy is safe and effective for all age groups — from infants to elders.\n\nHomeopathy treatment uses the body's own healing mechanisms, so there are no side-effects or rebound effects. Homeopathic medicines can be administered, both pre-operatively and post-operatively to ;speed up ;healing and to counteract any effects of anxiety, shock and an aesthetics (a drug administered to produce a complete or partial loss of feeling).Therefore, patients treated with homeopathic medicines make a much more rapid post-operative recovery, than patients who do not receive homeopathic treatment.\n\nRead about the homeopathy treatment at Dr Batra’s™https://www.drbatras.ae/homeopathy/treatment\n\nWhat Happens During the Homeopathy Consultation?\n\nHomeopathy treatment is based on a patient’s detailed case history and their progress. A homeopathic doctor works with patients collectively, to build a complete (holistic) picture of their health. This involves the homeopathy specialist and patient discussing the physical symptoms, emotional well-being, state of mind and everything which is important for the patient. The more details you are willing to share about your health, lifestyle, likes and dislikes or your emotions, the easier it becomes for a homeopathic doctor to provide an accurate homeopathic treatment.\n\nThis symptom picture (a substance which will cause a certain set of symptoms) is then matched with a homeopathic remedy. The homeopathy specialist will administer only one homeopathic remedy at a time in order to avoid any confusion in the homeopathy treatment. The homeopath will also provide the lowest dosage that will work effectively for any health condition. Many homeopathy specialists also recommend changes in diet and lifestyle for a patient’s overall well-being.\n\nHomeopathy Treatment for Your Health\n\nHomeopathy is known for its safe, effective and gentle healthcare treatment. People across the world prefer homeopathic medicines over conventional medicines, as they have no harmful effects, arenon-toxic as well as non-addictive. All homeopathic medicines are safe, provided they are taken under the supervision of a homeopathy specialist.\n\nFurthermore, homeopathic remedies do not interfere with other conventional medicines. In fact, homeopathic medicines play a complementary role. You can safely take a homeopathic medicine along with your conventional medicines for blood pressure, thyroid disease, heart problems, diabetes type 2 or stomach cancer. Homeopathic medicines act by stimulating your body’s natural healing power, through your immune system and nerves.\n\nWe highly recommended you to take Dr Batra’s™ free health evaluation test, in order to assess your current health condition.
