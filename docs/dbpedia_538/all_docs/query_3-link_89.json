        "text": "The principles of Homeopathy were first formulated at the end of the eighteenth century by Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician. He had given up the practice of medicine when he found the therapies of his time to be ineffective and harmful and did not resume practice until he discovered through Homeopathy, a means to help people heal gently, rapidly, and reliably.\n\nHomeopathy spread quickly throughout Europe and to the United States, where at the beginning of the 1900â€™s, 15-20% of all doctors practiced Homeopathy. Although the United States experienced a dwindling interest in Homeopathy in the 20th century, other nations, including countries in Europe and Asia, were experiencing a steady growth of Homeopathic teachings and interest."
