        "text": "What is homeopathy?\n\nHomeopathy (also spelled homoeopathy) is used as an alternative to, or as an addition to, conventional medicine. Homeopathy is based on the idea that if a material causes symptoms in a healthy person, tiny doses of that material can treat the symptoms in someone who is unwell. This idea does not fit with modern science.\n\nHomeopathic medicines are made by taking a material (for example a plant, animal part or a chemical) and diluting that material in water or alcohol over and over again. This results in very little of the original material staying in the homeopathic medicine. These highly diluted preparations can be found in several forms, including tablets, liquids and creams.\n\nIs homeopathy effective?\n\nThere is currently no evidence to support the effectiveness of homeopathy to prevent or treat any disease.\n\nIs homeopathy an alternative to immunisation?\n\nConventional vaccines undergo careful testing to prove both safety and effectiveness, whereas homeopathic preparations do not. There is no evidence that homeopathic preparations provide protection against childhood infectious diseases.\n\nIs homeopathic treatment safe?\n\nHomeopathic preparations don’t go through the careful testing for safety and effectiveness that other medicines do through the Australian Government’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).\n\nFor this reason, it is hard to know if the homeopathic preparation you are considering is safe. Some homeopathic preparations might be safe if used in addition to conventional medicine. They are not safe if used instead of conventional medicines.\n\nAnother major concern for using homeopathy is that it’s use may delay your visit to your general practitioner (GP) or other doctor for evidence-based treatment. A delay in this treatment can sometimes lead to serious harm.\n\nIs homeopathy an alternative to medical treatment?\n\nThe National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), which is Australia’s main medical advisory body, recommends that homeopathy should not be used to treat health conditions that are chronic or serious or could become serious if left untreated.\n\nThe NHMRC recommends that if you are thinking about using homeopathy, you should discuss this first with your doctor. In the meantime, continue taking your prescribed medicine or treatment. If you stop taking medicine or treatment prescribed by a doctor to use homeopathy instead, you are risking serious harm.\n\nQuestions to ask your doctor about homeopathy\n\nYour doctor is in the best position to advise if homeopathy is appropriate for you. Here are some questions you might ask your doctor:\n\nCan I use homeopathy to complement my medical treatment?\n\nIs it safe for me to use homeopathy?\n\nIs there any evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy for my condition?\n\nLet your doctor know if you have any questions or concerns about your prescribed medicines. Sometimes there are evidence-based alternatives to prescribed medicines that are known to be safe. You can also discuss your medicines with your pharmacist.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.\n\nResources and support\n\nCall healthdirect on 1800 022 222 at any time to speak to a registered nurse (known as NURSE-ON-CALL in Victoria) for more information and advice.\n\nCall the National Immunisation Information Line on 1800 671 811 for advice and information about immunisation and vaccination."
