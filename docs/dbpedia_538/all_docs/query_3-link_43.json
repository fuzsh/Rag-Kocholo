        "text": "What Is Homeopathy?\n\nHomeopathy, or homeopathic medicine, is a medical system started in Germany. It aims to treat the whole person instead of just the disease or symptom.\n\nThis system of medicine is based on two main beliefs. The first is that âlike cures like.â This is the idea that you can treat a disease with a natural substance that causes symptoms of that disease when a healthy person takes it. The second is the âlaw of minimum dose.â Homeopathic remedies are watered down (diluted) to give you the lowest dose possible. Sometimes the treatment is so diluted that there may be no trace of the original substance.\n\nHomeopathic practitioners describe their medicines as all natural. The ingredients come from plants, minerals, or animals. These remedies are available as ointments, creams, drops, tablets, and sugar pellets. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines; each individual gets a unique treatment plan. A homeopathic practitioner may give different remedies and dilutions to different people with the same condition.\n\nDoes Homeopathy Work for Diabetes?\n\nMost homeopathic remedies for diabetes have only been tested in animals and not in human clinical trials. For example, black plum (Syzygium jambolanum) is a common homeopathic remedy for diabetes. Studies show that this treatment may help control blood sugar in animals like rats and rabbits. But in studies with people with type 2 diabetes, there was no effect.\n\nThereâs no homeopathic substitute for insulin, but some research does show that homeopathic remedies may help control blood sugar when you use them along with regular treatment for diabetes. In one study, people with type 2 diabetes got individualized homeopathic treatments in addition to their normal medication. After 1 year, their blood glucose control and A1c levels improved.\n\nWe need more research in large studies in humans to be able to say whether homeopathic remedies can help control diabetes or not. Right now, there isnât proof that theyâre effective for any health condition."
