        "text": "Homeopathy is a scientific and effective system of medicine that has been in use for over 200 years. Homeopathic medicine works by stimulating the body’s own natural tendency to heal itself. It recognises that all symptoms of ill-health are expressions of disharmony within the whole person and that it is the patient who needs treatment, not the disease. Homeopathic treatment is based on the philosophy that the body, mind and emotions are not separate parts of a person, but are all affected by each other; therefore the homeopath seeks to observe a pattern in the disharmony which is reflecting the complete individual.\n\nAs such, it is a truly holistic medicine that treats the individual on all levels – mind, body and emotions.\n\nHomeopathic medicines (called remedies) are made from repeated dilutions of natural substances. There are thousands of remedies that the homeopath can use. Homeopathic treatment is based on the principle that what can cause disease in a healthy person, can also remove it in the sick. These remedies stimulate the body’s own defences and immune system to respond appropriately. Nutritional advice may also be given.\n\nWhen homeopathy remedies are made, they undergo a very specific process of preparation which includes both vigorous shaking (which is called succussing) and repeated and accurate dilution (which is called potentization). The more you dilute and succuss a remedy, the more potent it becomes.\n\nBecause homeopathic medicines are so carefully formulated, it is understood that they resonate with the individual and stimulate the body into making its own healing response.\n\nThe homeopath tries to understand the symptoms of the individual as these are the expression of the inner disease. Unlike conventional medicine which uses drugs to inhibit or suppress symptoms, homeopathic medicine seeks to understand the total picture of symptoms that are being expressed, and to remove the underlying cause of these symptoms. This is why the homeopath takes the time to try and understand the whole patient, as symptoms on all levels can be expressions of the same inner imbalance.\n\nMany diseases respond well to homeopathic treatment and homeopathy is an ideal preventative medicine as it strengthens the immune system and the body’s natural defences against disease. It treats both mental and emotional conditions as well as physical ones.\n\nHomeopathy can help where other forms of medicine may have failed or the side effects have caused additional problems. It may be that there has been no definitive diagnosis but YOU know you are not feeling right.\n\nHomeopathy has a gentle action well suited to the ailments of babies and children and can be used safely in pregnancy. It is also effective in treatment of stress, bereavement and depression.\n\nThere are many ailments and conditions for which homeopathy is suited. Here are some of the most common ones:"
