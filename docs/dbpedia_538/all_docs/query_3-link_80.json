        "text": "What is Homeopathy?\n\nHomeopathy, part of the natural health modalities, is a system of complementary medicine based on principles established over 200 years ago by German physician Samuel Hahnemann. By utilising the principle of ‘Similars’ or ‘Like Cures Like’ and using only the smallest doses of non-toxic substances, the therapy is both safe and effective.\n\nHomeopathic treatment is directed at the whole person. A well-selected homeopathic remedy can gently stimulate the natural healing forces of the body to bring about health.\n\nUsing the Law of Similars, homeopaths match the symptoms of the patient to the symptoms produced by a substance when given to a healthy person. The testing of the substance on healthy persons is known as a ‘proving’.\n\nThe symptoms produced in provings form the content of our ‘database’, known in homeopathy as the Materia Medica. It is the knowledge held within the Materia Medica that enables the homeopath to find the precise remedy suited to the individual patient’s needs, thereby bringing about an effective cure.\n\nMinimum dose homeopathic remedies are largely derived from animal, plant, and mineral sources. They are made using a method of serial dilution. The microdoses produced are called potentised remedies. The high dilutions produce extremely safe and effective medicines.\n\nHomeopathy’s effectiveness in a wide range of conditions is increasingly being verified by high-quality clinical and laboratory trials (both human and animal), many of which have been published in respected journals in recent years e.g. The Lancet, British Medical Journal, Pediatrics.\n\nFind out more about homeopathy and learn to use it in the home, in first aid situations and in acute conditions refer to our Diplomas and Introductory Courses:\n\nNew Zealand Diploma in Acute Prescribing with Homeopathy Level 5\n\nIntroduction to Homeopathy – Short Course\n\nClicking on any of the links below will enable you to find out more in-depth information about Homeopathy:"
