        "text": "The esteemed Dr. Samuel Hahnemann developed homeopathic medicine in 1796 —however, the idea of homeopathy had been around for centuries. Homeopathic ideas and practices were also understood by Aristotle and Hippocrates; they’re mentioned in ancient Hindu books. But what is homeopathy and how can you use it? Does anyone still use it?\n\nToday, Homeopathic medicine is a law-abiding science practiced by homeopathic practitioners in Las Vegas. It’s practiced by over 100 million people in India and by celebrities such as Queen Elizabeth II, Cher, and Jennifer Aniston.\n\nWhat is Homeopathy?\n\nKnowing and understanding symptoms, how they happen, and how they affect the body is the key to Homeopathy. Symptoms can be physical, mental, and emotional. Each of these types of symptoms can help understand your illness or disease. Homeopathy is a safe, curative form of medicine in these domains to promote overall well-being.\n\nWhile traditional medicine has some innovative qualities of mechanical cure, Homeopathy has amazing qualities of therapeutic healing. Homeopathic medicine does not cause side effects. Using homeopathic medicine does not affect current or previous conventional medicine taken for the ailment.\n\nA patient is not seen pathologically, but treated holistically; emotional, mental, and spiritual state take precedence over disease names. A homeopathic practitioner prescribes remedies for specific symptoms. Acute, chronic, or psychological issues are discussed and studied objectively, including your health history.\n\nThe power of “like cures like”\n\nIn homeopathy, the Law of Similars is based on the principle that “like cures like.” The homeopathic treatment of disease by small energetic doses of natural substances produces symptoms of the disease in a healthy person. However these remedies can cure similar symptoms in an ailing person.\n\nFor example, onions make your eyes water and nose run. Similarly, hay fever causes watering eyes and a burning nose as well. Thus, the homeopathic remedy for hay fever is made from the active ingredient red onions. Also known as Allium Cepa, red onions and other homeopathic products and can alleviate a feverish health condition.\n\nLas Vegas Homeopathy Procedures\n\nInitial consultation\n\nDuring your initial consultation, each new patient will be introduced to our practitioner. You’ll have a thorough discussion with Ahmed about your overall health care. Please allow two hours for this in-depth appointment.\n\nAdditional consultations\n\nThese are need-based follow-ups that usually occur six to eight weeks after the initial appointment.\n\nAcute consultation\n\nThese will occur in the event of an emergency, accident, or sudden onset of illness, ailment, or condition. Ahmed will prescribe other remedies for your new onset symptoms.\n\nOur Mission\n\nLicensed Advanced Practitioner of Homeopathy, Ahmed Masood is a proud resident of Four Seasons Dental Spa. As a homeopathic practitioner in Las Vegas, he encourages non-stimulant based lifestyles. Living life without constant simulants provides the optimum environment for effective homeopathy.\n\nIntegrating functional and holistic medicine with homeopathy combines the best of both worlds. Focusing on the patient and finding the exact cause of their symptoms is a great step to a self-care lifestyle. Homeopathy is just one step closer to making your own personal health a top priority in your life."
