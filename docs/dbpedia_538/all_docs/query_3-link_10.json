        "text": "Homeopathic medicine is a form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that uses very small amounts of natural substances that, at higher amounts, may cause a disease or symptom.\n\nHomeopathy is used to treat a wide variety of ailments, including colds, upset stomachs, pain, and menopausal hot flashes. However, there is limited evidence proving the effectiveness of homeopathic treatments.\n\nThis article explores the principles behind homeopathy, what scientific studies say about homeopathic remedies, how they compare with conventional medicine, and the possible side effects and risks.\n\nWhat Is Homeopathy?\n\nDeveloped in Germany more than 200 years ago, homeopathic medicine is based on the belief that the body can heal itself. Its unconventional approach aims to treat the whole patient using medicines made from highly diluted plants and other natural elements.\n\nHomeopathic treatment is customized for each patient. Its underlying principles are the law of similars, the single remedy, and the minimal dose.\n\nLike Cures Like\n\nThe first theory of homeopathy is the law of similars or the idea that like cures like. The concept is that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people.\n\nThe belief is that if something causes symptoms in a healthy person, it may cure those same symptoms in a person with an illness. For example, if you have insomnia, a homeopathic remedy may be a very weak solution containing coffee.\n\nHomeopathy practitioners say it works because a small amount of the disease-causing substance stimulates your body to heal itself. However, it’s important to note that homeopathy is largely unproven.\n\nSingle Remedy\n\nHomeopathy also uses the principle of the single remedy. That is, one remedy should cover all the physical, emotional, and mental symptoms of an illness.\n\nHomeopathic medicine is designed to stimulate internal healing mechanisms. Treatments are individualized, and only one medicine is given at a time. Practitioners watch and wait to see if the therapy is working before trying something else.\n\nThe reasons for this are the potential for interactions is unknown, one medicine may cancel the other, and if taking more than one remedy at a time, it’s difficult to tell which one is working.\n\nHowever, sometimes, a homeopathic treatment will initially aggravate symptoms before showing an improvement. Proponents of homeopathy say a slight worsening of the condition is normal at the beginning and a sign the medicine is prompting the body to heal itself.\n\nMinimum Dose\n\nThe principle of the minimum dose means only a small amount of substance is used at first, followed by minuscule increases over time.\n\nHomeopathic remedies are dosed based on the theory of potentization: The starting material is diluted over and over again and forcefully shaken. Practitioners believe that these actions eliminate chemical toxicity and allow a therapeutic effect.\n\nThe thought is that diluting and agitating (vigorously shaking) an ingredient activates its curative powers and enhances its effect. Potency in homeopathic solutions can be indicated by:\n\nX or D (the decimal dilution scale): An ingredient is mixed with alcohol or distilled water at a ratio of 1:10. For example, one part coffee (or other curative ingredient) to 10 parts water.\n\nC (the centesimal dilution scale): 1:100 ratio, or one part curative ingredient to 100 parts water/alcohol.\n\nThese dilutions may happen several times before a homeopathic remedy is given. For example, a 3C solution is diluted on the C scale (1:100) one time, then shaken up. Then it’s diluted (1:100) a second time and shaken, then a third time. The resulting solution has only a few molecules of the original ingredient left.\n\nSkeptics have described this as the equivalent of dissolving one Advil (ibuprofen) in the ocean and then drinking a few drops.\n\nSamuel Hahnemann, the inventor of homeopathy, had his own explanation for skeptics: The vigorous shaking causes the substance to leave behind a “spirit-like” essence that, although “no longer perceptible to the senses,” is nevertheless “remembered” by the water, which allows it to retain healing properties.\n\nHow Homeopathic Medicine Is Used\n\nHomeopathic medicines commonly consist of sugar pellets containing diluted remedies. Some remedies also may take other forms, such as tablets, ointments, or gels.\n\nWhile strong scientific evidence is lacking, preliminary studies suggest that homeopathy may help treat:\n\nAllergies\n\nArthritis\n\nAsthma\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome\n\nColds\n\nCough\n\nDiarrhea\n\nFlu\n\nFibromyalgia\n\nMenopause symptoms like hot flashes\n\nMuscle aches\n\nOtitis media (ear infection)\n\nPain\n\nStress\n\nTeething\n\nThe prescribed treatment will depend on your specific symptoms. A compound that causes those symptoms when taken at high doses is administered at a low dose to cure similar symptoms.\n\nFor example, homeopathic treatments for allergies vary based on a person’s specific symptoms. The following homeopathic treatments are used for different types of allergic reactions:\n\nAllium cepa: A runny nose that irritates the nostrils and upper lip, along with watery eyes that do not burn, itch, or sting\n\nArsenicum album: Sneezing, a watery runny nose, and a burning sensation in the eyes, nose, and or throat\n\nEuphrasia officinalis: Burning tears with a non-irritating runny nose and a cough\n\nNatrum muriaticum: Headaches, dark circles under the eyes, chapped and cracked lips, sneezing, and nasal discharge with an egg-white consistency\n\nSabadilla: Itchy nose, violent sneezing, runny eyes\n\nWyethia helenioides: Itchy throat, mouth, and ears or a sore throat with a hoarse voice\n\nResearch on Homeopathy\n\nResults on the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies have been inconsistent, primarily due to the lack of widespread regulations of the practice. This makes the dosage of homeopathic medicines variable.\n\nA 2016 review evaluated the body of research on homeopathic remedies. The authors concluded individualized homeopathy (based on the specific needs of the person) “may have small, specific, treatment effects.”\n\nBy contrast, a 2017 meta-analysis found there was no single clinical medical condition for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective.\n\nAnd a large 2018 review looked at the common claims that homeopathic medicines can prevent or treat respiratory tract infections in children. The authors said they found no evidence these treatments work. Due to a lack of detailed reporting in earlier studies, they couldn’t draw conclusions about their safety.\n\nIt’s likely that future studies will shine more light on the safety and effectiveness of homeopathic remedies.\n\nHomeopathy and Cancer\n\nFor certain types of cancer, animal studies suggest homeopathic remedies—when used along with conventional treatments—may inhibit cancer’s growth, reduce symptoms, and improve ​quality of life.\n\nAt the current time, however, experts can’t say whether the results from animal studies can be applied to humans, so more work is needed.\n\nA 2018 study in an integrative cancer treatment program looked at homeopathy for symptom management. Of 124 patients, 73% said homeopathic remedies were beneficial. Those most likely to benefit were:\n\nPeople assigned female at birth\n\nPeople with breast cancer\n\nPeople coping with either chemotherapy-related peripheral neuropathy or hot flashes\n\nTwo important points to note:\n\nHomeopathy was used for symptom management, not for cancer treatment.\n\nThis was a small study with only 124 participants.\n\nSide Effects and Warnings\n\nHomeopathic remedies are generally safe and without significant side effects since they use only a small amount of a highly diluted substance.\n\nHowever, homeopathic products have not been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety or effectiveness in diagnosing, treating, curing, preventing, or mitigating any diseases or conditions.\n\nIn addition, since homeopathic treatments are not FDA-approved, they may not meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness, and quality. Some products have been found to contain higher doses or ingredients other than those listed on the label.\n\nHomeopathic remedies should not replace conventional treatments for most medical conditions. There is little evidence to prove homeopathy works, and trying homeopathy first may delay treatments backed by well-designed studies.\n\nDo not combine homeopathic treatments with traditional medications without first consulting your healthcare provider or pharmacist.\n\nPeople who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or being treated for a serious medical condition should talk to their healthcare provider before using homeopathic remedies.\n\nConsulting Homeopathic Providers\n\nBefore using over-the-counter homeopathic remedies to treat any condition, it is best to consult with a homeopath. In most states, homeopathic practitioners must be licensed healthcare providers.\n\nHowever, there isn’t a standard medical license for practicing homeopathy. Instead, homeopathic providers are licensed through traditional medical licensing organizations.\n\nFor example, a medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) can specialize in homeopathic medicine to become a doctor of homeopathy (DHt). Naturopaths, chiropractors, nurse practitioners, acupuncturists, and veterinarians can also become certified in classical homeopathy (CCH).\n\nYou can find a certified provider through homeopathic schools, training programs, and organizations such as:\n\nAmerican Association of Naturopathic Physicians\n\nCouncil for Homeopathic Certification\n\nHomeopathic Educational Services\n\nNational Center for Homeopathy\n\nNorth American Society of Homeopaths\n\nSome homeopathic doctors also specialize in treating specific conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, and mental illness.\n\nWhat to Expect During a Homeopathic Appointment\n\nThe first appointment with a homeopath will involve a thorough physical examination and a lot of questions. Your provider may have you fill out an extensive questionnaire prior to your visit.\n\nDuring the first visit, the homeopath will interview you at length to get to know you better. Since homeopathy treats the whole person and not just individual symptoms, providers take note of personality traits and any unusual behaviors.\n\nThe homeopath will also discuss your physical symptoms and will likely ask questions about seemingly unrelated symptoms. This will help provide a full picture of your health to help pinpoint the appropriate treatment.\n\nThe first visit can last between an hour and two and a half hours. Subsequent visits will be shorter. Homeopathic providers may also take more time to discuss healthy lifestyle practices, which can have a real benefit on health.\n\nHomeopathic and Conventional Medicine\n\nHomeopathic medicine and allopathic (mainstream or conventional) medicine are essentially opposites, with homeopaths using the like-cures-like approach and medical practitioners using treatments that produce a different effect than the disease.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they can’t work together. A relatively new approach has been using a combination of conventional therapies along with alternative practices to help control symptoms. This is referred to as integrative medicine.\n\nWhile homeopathic remedies haven’t conclusively been found helpful for any disease, practitioners do offer a service some people feel is currently lacking in conventional medical care: time and listening.\n\nSummary\n\nHomeopathy is a form of CAM that uses tiny amounts of substances that, in larger amounts, cause symptoms in order to treat those symptoms. The theory is called “like cures like.”\n\nHomeopathic practitioners believe greatly diluting and shaking a substance can activate its curative abilities. They seek a single remedy for all aspects of an illness and use the smallest dose possible.\n\nHomeopathy has been around for more than 200 years and involves some 2,000 remedies. While research has yet to prove they’re effective, they’re being used alongside mainstream medicine more and more, especially for symptom management."
