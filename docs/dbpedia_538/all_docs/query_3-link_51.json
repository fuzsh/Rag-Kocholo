        "text": "Homeopathy is one approach to relieving rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Find out whether this form of treatment is effective.\n\nIf you live with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune condition that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and damage in the joints, you’ve probably tried a variety of treatments to find relief, perhaps with varying degrees of efficacy.\n\nOne option some people with RA find helpful is homeopathy. This form of alternative treatment may reduce symptoms in some RA patients, but the evidence for its effectiveness is very limited.\n\nLearn more about rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nNo homeopathic remedies (for RA or otherwise) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Any products labeled as homeopathic have not been reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness in treating any condition.\n\nThe FDA warns that since homeopathic drug products have not been approved for any use, they may not meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness, and quality.\n\nStill, this doesn’t mean you can’t find qualified practitioners who prescribe them. Licensed naturopathic doctors and even some mainstream physicians may use homeopathy as part of an alternative course of treatment for RA.\n\nMost homeopathic products are highly diluted, which reduces their potential for side effects. But according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, some homeopathic drugs may be mislabeled or contain significant amounts of active ingredients that could cause side effects or drug interactions. Heavy metals like mercury and iron are of particular concern.\n\nThough research on the side effects of homeopathic medications for RA is limited, some people have reported:\n\nskin rashes\n\nsweating\n\nnausea\n\nhomeopathic aggravation (where disease symptoms temporarily worsen before responding to treatment)\n\nTraditionally, rheumatoid arthritis is treated primarily with medication and lifestyle modifications. Biologics, janus kinase inhibitors, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are among the most common pharmacological interventions.\n\nResearch also shows that aerobic exercise and an anti-inflammatory diet like the Mediterranean diet can reduce pain and improve function in people with RA.\n\nHomeopathy traces its roots back to the 1700s when German physician Samuel Hahnemann theorized that “like cures like.” The idea goes that small amounts of a substance that would induce symptoms in healthy people can cure the same symptoms in people who have them.\n\nClassic homeopathy theory goes that the smaller and more diluted the amount of a substance, the greater its potential effect.\n\nMost homeopathic medications are in the form of:\n\npills\n\ntinctures\n\ntablets\n\ndrops\n\nSpecific homeopathic treatments intended for rheumatoid arthritis include:\n\nrhus tox (poison ivy)\n\narnica\n\nApis mellifica\n\nAntimonium crudum\n\nbryonia\n\nThere’s currently no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, and having this condition can affect your long-term well-being. According to the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, RA can shorten the lifespan by about 10 years due to associated complications.\n\nHowever, treatments can allow people with rheumatoid arthritis to live more comfortably. With the right combination of medication, stress relief, diet modification, and physical exercise, many people can continue to work and participate in an active lifestyle.\n\nWhat is the best homeopathic remedy for rheumatoid arthritis?\n\nBecause homeopathy for rheumatoid arthritis is poorly studied, it’s hard to say which treatments are the best. To date, none have been proven effective for reducing symptoms.\n\nOn the other hand, there’s evidence that certain anti-inflammatory supplements can quell joint pain and inflammation in people with RA, like curcumin and fish oil.\n\nCan you take homeopathic medications alongside RA medications?\n\nSome homeopathic remedies are not recommended for use with certain medications. Your physician can advise you on whether a specific homeopathic treatment can be used in combination with your usual RA meds.\n\nIs homeopathy covered by insurance?\n\nDepending on your insurance plan, homeopathic medications may be covered, but it’s unlikely. Insurance plans may be more likely to cover these treatments when prescribed by a licensed physician who includes homeopathy in tandem with allopathic medication."
