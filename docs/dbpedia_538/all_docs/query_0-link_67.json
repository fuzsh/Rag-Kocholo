        "text": "This article examines the shifts and changes in the metaphors used to describe the human genome and the human genome project (HGP) between 2000 and 2003, with the year 2001 as a trigger for genomic and metaphorical reflection. We want to answer questions, such as: Did the findings announced in 2001 shake the metaphorical foundations on which the HGP had been built or not? Did novel metaphors capture the imagination of scientists and the public or did old metaphors survive throughout this period? What influence does the continuity or discontinuity in metaphorical framing of the HGP have on the public perception of the HGP as well as on its scientific understanding? To answer these questions we have systematically compared the metaphors used in one major scientific journal, Nature, and in one major UK newspaper, the online edition of the Guardian/The Observer during a period of two months around June 2000, February 2001 and April 2003.\n\nUsing literary critical tools, this paper examines the role played by metaphor in contemporary popular science writing on genetics. Following Richard Whitley’s assertion that popular science writing’s ‘expository practices are not epistemologically neutral’ I argue that, given its central pedagogical role in popular science writing, an analysis of the use of metaphor is critical to our understanding of popular scientific discourse. In this paper, I engage in textual analysis focussing on the presence and effect of just one metaphor – that of language – in popular science writing on genetics. Specifically, I argue that language metaphors are deployed strategically to support the authors’ positions on genetic determinism: metaphors of language, with a few notable exceptions, are seen to generally present a gene-centric approach to ontogeny.\n\nThis paper studies the distinctive role that staged media events play in the public understanding of genetics: they can focus the attention of the media, scientists and the public on the risks and benefits of genetic advances, in our case, cloning; they can accelerate policy changes by exposing scientific, legal and ethical uncertainties; the use of images, metaphors, cliches, and cultural narratives by scientists and the media engaged in this event can reinforce stereotypical representations of cloning, but can also expose fundamental clashes in arguments about cloning. The media event staged by two fertility experts in 2001 is here analysed as a case study.\n\nThis article critiques and creates metaphoric genetic rhetoric by examining metaphors for genes used by representatives of the lay American public. We assess these metaphors with a new rhetorical orientation that we developed by building onto work by Robert Ivie and social scientific qualitative studies of audiences. Specifically, our analysis reveals three themes of genetic metaphors, with the first two appearing most frequently: (1) genes as a disease or problem, (2) genes as fire or bomb, and (3) genes as gambling. We not only discuss the problems and untapped potential of these metaphors, but also we suggest metaphorically understanding genes interacting with the environment as a dance or a band. This article has implications for rhetorical criticism, science studies, and public health.\n\nCarrying out research in genetics and genomics and communicating about them would not be possible without metaphors such as “information,” “code,” “letter” or “book.” Genetic and genomic metaphors have remained relatively stable for a long time but are now beginning to shift in the context of synthetic biology and epigenetics. This article charts the emergence of metaphors in the context of epigenetics, first through collecting some examples of metaphors in scientific and popular writing and second through a systematic analysis of metaphors used in two UK broadsheets. Findings show that while source domains for metaphors can be identified, such as our knowledge of electrical switches or of bookmarks, it is difficult to pinpoint target domains for such metaphors. This may be indicative both of struggles over what epigenetics means for scientists (natural and social) and of difficulties associated with talking about this, as yet, young field in the popular press.\n\nSynthetic Biology is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary science at the confluence of biology and engineering. It focuses on the design and fabrication of biological systems through the ‘writing’ of DNA. This newest field in the ‘new’ genetics is increasingly seen as a paradigmatic shift in our relationship with nature. In this paper we will show that when scientists and the media try to convey its novel features and promises, they tend to use a language which, although rooted in the discourses used to frame older genetic advances such as genetic engineering and the decoding of the Human Genome Project (HGP), changes the focus of metaphorical framing from interpreting and altering to inventing and fabricating. This underlines both the field’s continuity and similarity with what has gone before but also signals various discontinuities and differences. We aim not only to investigate the rhetorical function of metaphors used by scientists and journalists when writing about synthetic biology, but to understand their inherent ethics and the implications this may have for public understanding of this field."
