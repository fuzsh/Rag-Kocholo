        "text": "Let's start with #3\n\nTREATING THE TOTALITY IS SIMPLE: ONE PERSON, ONE DISEASE PATTERN AT A TIME.\n\nYou know that phrase- the total isn't the sum of its parts?\n\nIt's like that- we aren't adding up a column of numbers, but looking for a cohesive pattern that reveals what's going on in your whole being. Homeopathy doesn't have specialties separating body systems or organs.\n\nAs a homeopath, I consider the pattern of all of your symptoms together and find one homeopathic remedy that will best match that pattern.\n\nFor example, after a head-injury, a person often experiences many symptoms: headaches, fatigue, impaired thinking, sometimes depression and unexplained crying. A remedy like natrum sulphuricum may address all of these symptoms together.\n\nWhen you choose homeopathic treatment, you can be sure that you will be seen for your whole self and your whole history. How you came to be where you are, and how it all fits together. Rather than dealing your symptoms out to specialists like a deck of cards, Homeopathy brings you to wholeness.\n\nAnd finally, #1 Minimum Dose\n\n\"Kill them with kindness\", \"That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger\", \"less is more\",\n\n\"Poison is in everything, and no thing is without poison. The dosage makes it either a poison or a remedy.\"(Quote by Paracelsus)\n\nFrom phrases in everyday language, to documented medical philosophy, the idea of 'dose' matters.\n\nHOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH? HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?\n\nSamuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, discovered through decades of experimentation and practice that when a body is susceptible to a medicine, or a disease, the least amount is the most potent.\n\nHe gave this example- when you are healthy, how much chicken soup would you have to eat to feel sick to your stomach? 3 bowls? 5 bowls? A gallon?\n\nIf you have a stomach flu, how much would you have to eat to feel sick? The answer sometimes is none- just the smell alone may turn the stomach, or just the thought.\n\nLikewise, exposure to influenza may be fleeting- but in a susceptible person, enough to cause illness. For someone else, they might tend to a sick person in their own home- and not fall ill.\n\nIt is no different with medicine. If it's the right medicine for you, a minimum dose is all that may be needed to stimulate the body to heal."
