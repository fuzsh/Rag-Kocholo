        "text": "Homeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the body can cure itself. Those who practice it use tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals. They believe these stimulate the healing process.\n\nIt was developed in the late 1700s in Germany. Itâs common in many European countries, but itâs not quite as popular in the United States.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nA basic belief behind homeopathy is âlike cures like.â In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person can -- in a very small dose -- treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger the bodyâs natural defenses.\n\nFor example, red onion makes your eyes water. Thatâs why itâs used in homeopathic remedies for allergies. Treatments for other ailments are made from poison ivy, white arsenic, crushed whole bees, and an herb called arnica.\n\nHomeopathic doctors (who also are called âhomeopathsâ) weaken these ingredients by adding water or alcohol. Then they shake the mixture as part of a process called âpotentization.â They believe this step transfers the healing essence. Homeopaths also believe that the lower the dose, the more powerful the medicine. In fact, many of these remedies no longer contain any molecules of the original substance. They come in a variety of forms, like sugar pellets, liquid drops, creams, gels, and tablets.\n\nDuring your appointment, a homeopath will ask a number of questions about your mental, emotional, and physical health. Theyâll prescribe the remedy that best matches all of your symptoms. Then theyâll tailor the treatment for you.\n\nYou can also buy over-the-counter homeopathic remedies at drugstores and health food stores. The dosage and quality of these products depend on the manufacturer.\n\nWhat Conditions Does Homeopathy Treat?\n\nItâs used for a wide variety of health issues, including some chronic illnesses:\n\nAllergies\n\nMigraines\n\nDepression\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome\n\nPremenstrual syndrome\n\nIt can also be used for minor issues like bruises, scrapes, toothaches, headaches, nausea, coughs, and colds.\n\nDonât use homeopathic medicine for life-threatening illnesses, like asthma, cancer, and heart disease, or in emergencies. You should also avoid using it in place of vaccines. Some homeopathic products called ânosodesâ are marketed as an alternative for vaccines, but thereâs no research to prove theyâre effective.\n\nDoes It Work?\n\nResearch is mixed. Some studies show that homeopathic remedies are helpful, while others donât. Critics chalk up the benefits to the placebo effect. Thatâs when symptoms improve because you believe the treatment is working -- not because it really is. This can trigger the brain to release chemicals that briefly relieve the pain or other symptoms.\n\nDoctors are divided because some of the theories behind homeopathy donât line up with the principles of chemistry and physics. Scientists argue that a medicine with no active ingredient shouldnât have an effect on the body.\n\nWhat Are the Risks?\n\nThe FDA oversees homeopathic remedies. But it doesnât check to see if theyâre safe or effective. In general, most are so watered down that they donât cause any side effects. But there are exceptions. Homeopathic medicines can contain a large amount of an active ingredient, like a heavy metal, that can be dangerous.\n\nCase in point: In 2016, the FDA issued a warning against using homeopathic teething tablets and gels because of possible health risks to infants and children.\n\nIf youâre thinking about trying these alternative treatments, talk to your doctor. They can make sure theyâre safe and wonât interact with any other medications youâre taking."
