        "meta_description": "I'm a Toronto Real Estate Agent with RE/MAX Hallmark and I've lived and worked in the Toronto Beaches since 1985. While my specialty is East End Toronto Homes in The Beaches, Leslieville, Riverdale and The Danforth, many of my clients have recently opted for Downtown Toronto Condos to be closer to work.  I enjoy speaking to Corporate or Community groups about market trends, wealth building, or the 'nuts and bolts' of how to buy and sell Real Estate. I'm comfortable sharing my experience with first time buyers as well as seasoned investors.",
