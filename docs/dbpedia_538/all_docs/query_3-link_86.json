        "text": "Many clients come to me stating they are frustrated because conventional medical treatment has not been effective in helping them get the health results they want. They tell me they are tired of taking medical drugs and they want to try homeopathy. In my experience, I have observed Homeopathy to be effective with many chronic conditions such as:\n\nHomeopathy is a holistic science and as such it addresses the whole person – physical symptoms, emotions, genetic influences, stressors, and the underlying causes of your health problems. Homeopathy views symptoms as the body’s natural response in fighting an illness. Homeopathic remedies, when properly prescribed, can help to eliminate the underlying cause of diseases, thus establishing a healthy balance between our body and the environment.\n\nHomeopathy was established for over 200 years ago by German physician Samuel Hahnemann, and is recognized by the World Health Organization as the second largest therapeutic system in the world. Homeopathic remedies are diluted in a specific way that increases their potential to remedy ailments while at the same time making toxicity impossible. The manufacture and sale of homeopathic remedies are regulated by the FDA. Homeopathy is one of several healing methods that I use in my practice. Q: Should I use homeopathy just by itself or should I combine it with other methods of healing? A: I find homeopathy works best when combined with other holistic modalities such as clinical nutrition and detoxification. I use this combined approach which is tailored to each client’s individual needs and situation. Dr. Salzarulo is featured in the July 2015 issue of Homeopathy & You. Click here to read the article."
