In the 1943-45 log book of Don McBride, John listed his home address as:

John J. Helfrich

1750 S. Park Ave.

Buffalo 20, N.Y.

W8NOP

From the 1960-1962 CNAC Mailing List:

Helfrich, John

From the 1965 CNAC Mailing List:

Helfrich, John

1750 S. Park Ave

Buffalo N Y

NOTE: I wrote to the above address January 10, 2018, but the letter came back, stamped "No Such Number". Unfortunately we have no more information on Captain John J. Helfrich other than what you see on this page.

Can you help?

If you would like to share any information about John J. Helfrich

or would like to be added to the CNAC e-mail distribution list,

please let the CNAC Web Editor, Tom Moore, know.

Thanks!
