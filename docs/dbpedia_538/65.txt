Gregory was born on February 1, 1956, in La Crosse, Wisconsin to Gerald and Helen Helfrich. The family moved to Redlands, California in 1963 where he grew up and learned his father’s trade of custom cabinet builder and finishing carpenter. He was employed in the family business, Inland Milling and Cabinets, for many years. He expanded his craft working on commercial renovations and restorations when he lived in Los Angeles. Later he moved to the Gardnerville-Tahoe area and specialized in home remodels. He returned to Yucaipa in 2012 to be with family again.

His hobby was his craft. He enjoyed helping family and friends with repairs and remodels. There is a part of his craft, a memory, in each of our homes.
