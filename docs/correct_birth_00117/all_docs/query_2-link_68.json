        "text": "30 December 1865 – 18 January 1936\n\nRudyard Kipling was born in Bombay, India, during the time of British rule and many of Kipling’s works were inspired by his life and time there. He was a gifted journalist, poet, short story writer and novelist, and is considered to be one of the greatest British writers.\n\nKipling was educated in England, and when he was sixteen he returned to India and moved to the city of Lahore where he began his career as an assistant editor for a local newspaper. During this time, he wrote and published a prolific number of short stories.\n\nHe moved to London in 1889 in order to further his career as a writer, and by 1891 he had published two novels. In the following year Kipling was married, and three children were had in quick succession: Josephine, Elsie and John. During this time Kipling wrote the Jungle Books and this brought him global fame.\n\nAfter a visit to America, Josephine died of pneumonia. Kipling never recovered from her death, and his views became increasingly imperialistic.\n\nIn 1907 he became the first British writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nKipling was a strong supporter of the First World War and went to France to report on the war from the trenches. He also encouraged his son John to enlist. John had sight difficulties was originally turned down by the army, but Kipling used his connections to find John a post as a second lieutenant with the Irish Guard. In October 1915 Kipling learned that his son had gone missing in France. The news devastated the family and Kipling set off for France to look for his son. But nothing came of the search and he returned to England to mourn the death of another child.\n\nThe loss of his son haunts Kipling’s war poetry, and his writings reveal how war is at one exhilarating and filled with rage, horror and revenge. He was one of the most read writers of the First World War era. His poem ‘Epitaphs of War’ is modelled on the epitaphs of Greek Anthology. Epitaphs are phrases that commemorate the dead, and are often found on tomb or headstones. The ‘Epitaphs of War’ each commemorate persons or ideals that were lost in the war, and are defiant, stoic, tender and strong.\n\nKipling died of a stomach ulcer when he was 70 years old.\n\nPoetic Techniques\n\nMetaphor\n\nImagery\n\nRhyme\n\nPoetry Aloud\n\nFurther Reading"
