        "text": "Rudyard Kipling used to be a household name. Born in 1865 in Bombay, where his father taught at an arts school, and then exiled as a boy to England, he returned to India as a teen-ager, and quickly established himself as the great chronicler of the Anglo-Indian experience. He was Britain’s first Nobel laureate in literature, and probably the most widely read writer since Tennyson. People knew his poems by heart, read his stories to their children. The Queen wanted to knight him. But in recent years Kipling’s reputation has taken such a beating that it’s a wonder any sensible critic would want to go near him now. Kipling has been variously labelled a colonialist, a jingoist, a racist, an anti-Semite, a misogynist, a right-wing imperialist warmonger; and—though some scholars have argued that his views were more complicated than he is given credit for—to some degree he really was all those things. That he was also a prodigiously gifted writer who created works of inarguable greatness hardly matters anymore, at least not in many classrooms, where Kipling remains politically toxic.\n\nIn a prologue to “If: The Untold Story of Kipling’s American Years” (Penguin Press), Christopher Benfey, a professor at Mount Holyoke, writes that some of his friends, when they learned what he was working on, asked him what on earth he was thinking, and warned that he’d better be ready to defend himself. Benfey’s best defense turns out to be the book itself, which doesn’t attempt a full-throated rehab job. An Americanist who has written very good books about Emily Dickinson and Stephen Crane, among others, Benfey mostly steers clear of Kipling’s politics, and instead concentrates on a little-known chapter in Kipling’s life: the four years that this outspoken defender of the British Empire spent living just outside Brattleboro, Vermont, where he wrote some of his best work, including “The Jungle Book” and “The Second Jungle Book,” “Captains Courageous,” and the first draft of “Kim.” Kipling’s American sojourn is hardly an “untold story”—it figures in all the biographies—but Benfey tells it well, catching nuances that some biographers have missed. He argues that Kipling was profoundly altered by his experience of America, and that America, in turn, was altered by its experience of Kipling. But you could also make a case that neither was changed enough. Kipling never learned to lighten up—or to appreciate American humor and informality—and America, by his lights, never got over being headstrong and overly sure of itself.\n\nKipling wound up in Brattleboro because, in January, 1892, when he was twenty-six and already famous for tales and poems he had published about India, he married a Vermonter named Carrie Balestier. Theirs was such a perplexing union that you wish that Benfey had gone into more detail about it. He doesn’t tell you, for example, just how much Kipling’s family and most of his friends disliked Carrie. They thought her unattractive and opinionated, not nearly feminine enough. Kipling’s father said she was “a good man spoiled.” Most Kipling biographers have depicted her as a nag, a harridan, a ball-breaker. So what did Kipling see in her? Mostly, it seems, he saw her brother, who was Kipling’s friend and literary agent.\n\nWolcott Balestier was a darting, quicksilver figure, who probably deserves a book of his own. Arthur Waugh (Evelyn’s father), who briefly worked for him, said he had a “chameleon power with people.” After dropping out of Cornell, Wolcott travelled to Colorado and to Mexico, looking for adventure, and then edited a lowbrow New York weekly called Tid-Bits, before settling in London, where he became an enterprising and ambitious agent—the Andrew Wylie of his time. Some people thought him vulgar, but most of literary London was charmed; Henry James and Edmund Gosse were especially smitten. Kipling loved Balestier, too, and their friendship, if it wasn’t overtly sexual, had erotic overtones. They even wrote together—something Kipling never did with anyone else—collaborating on a novel, “The Naulahka,” an adventure story about a priceless Indian necklace.\n\nIn December, 1891, Balestier died suddenly, of typhoid, at the age of twenty-nine. Kipling, who was visiting India, where his parents still lived, raced back to London, and scarcely a week after he returned he married Balestier’s younger sister, in a dreary little ceremony that was more like a funeral than a wedding. Henry James gave away the bride, though he said later, “It’s a union of which I don’t forecast the future.” Kipling, for their honeymoon, rewrote a love poem that he had intended for her brother, changing the pronouns and addressing her as “Dear Lass,” instead of “Dear Lad.”\n\nKipling’s romantic life to that point, aside from visits to Indian brothels, had consisted mostly of flirtations with older, married women and a prolonged, moony attachment to a younger one who remained distant and unavailable. Carrie was neither of those things. It seems likely that she engineered the marriage, although Benfey wonders whether Balestier, on his deathbed, might have made his sister promise to wed his friend. The Kipling biographer Martin Seymour-Smith has proposed, with little evidence, a different theory: that Balestier confessed to his sister that he and Kipling had been lovers, and that she offered to marry Kipling to protect his reputation.\n\nIt was not, in any event, an ideal match. Henry Adams, who happened to be on the liner the Kiplings took to begin their honeymoon, said of them later, “Somehow, somewhere, Kipling and the American were not one, but two, and could not be glued together.” But Adam Nicolson, who published a book about Carrie in 2001, has suggested that the persistent notion of her as a domestic bully is unfair. Kipling—gloomy, moody, prone to breakdowns—was far from easy to live with, he says, and Carrie did everything she could to give him peace in which to write. She ran the household, took care of the money, shooed away distractions. Not least, she brought him to Vermont, after he had lost a considerable fortune in what became the financial panic of 1893. On land bought from Carrie’s other brother, Beatty, they built a house, Naulakha, named after the novel, though spelled differently. It was a long, narrow, green-shingled place that, with one end shaped like a bow, looked a little like an ark. For a while, Kipling, who never felt entirely at home either in India or in England, was as happy there as he had ever been. (Naulakha is still standing, and available for vacation rentals. I once spent the night there, in Kipling’s enormous bedroom.)\n\nLike Dickens fifty years earlier, Kipling greatly approved of America in principle—its openness and freedom, the seeming absence of caste and class—but he was less keen on Americans themselves. He thought them loutish, nosy, excessively fond of alcohol, and dangerously prone to violence. He was unwavering, however, in his admiration of American writers, Mark Twain especially. He even made a pilgrimage to meet Twain, starting in San Francisco and trekking across the American continent before finally tracking down the great man in Elmira, New York. They smoked cigars together, and Twain later said of his young visitor, “I believed that he knew more than any person I had met before.”\n\nOn settling in America, Benfey says, Kipling was determined to reinvent himself as a specifically American kind of writer, and for a while believed that his status as an outsider made him uniquely qualified to study American society. He was “the only man living,” a friend recalls him boasting, “who could write The Great American Novel.” He initially planned to write a series of local-color sketches in the manner of Sarah Orne Jewett, another author he admired, but abandoned that plan, probably wisely, and began working instead on what would become the first “Jungle Book.” The setting of those stories is hardly American, but even so, Benfey says, Kipling was partly inspired by his Vermont surroundings and his conviction that he was living in a lawless wilderness. Much of the tension in the Jungle Books arises from the conflict between the Law of the Jungle—with its insistence on hierarchy and individual responsibility—and those who seek to undermine it, especially the tiger Shere Khan, a solitary, ruthless predator, and the mindless, pleasure-seeking Monkey People. In later years, Kipling never discouraged readers from finding in the Jungle Books a political allegory. In one interpretation, the Law of the Jungle is the Raj, and the Monkey People are the hapless Indians whom the British came to civilize. Or, Kipling also suggested, you could see the Monkey People as an indictment of American populists, and their habit of promising everything and accomplishing nothing.\n\nThe other great theme of the Jungle Books is that of personal growth through manly, stressful adventure in the wild. This idea found a ready enthusiast in Theodore Roosevelt, then a civil-service commissioner in Washington. He and Kipling became friends and would visit the zoo together (where Roosevelt liked watching the bears, while Kipling preferred the beavers). Kipling also discussed his philosophy with William James, who visited Naulakha in 1895, and who drew on Kipling’s thinking, Benfey says, to formulate his notion of a “moral equivalent of war”—a proposed regimen of adventure and challenge designed to rid American youth of their growing softness. James, in turn, partly inspired Kipling’s one truly American work, “Captains Courageous,” a 1897 novel about a bratty rich kid who falls off an ocean liner, is picked up by some fishermen sailing out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, and learns from them the virtues of responsibility and hard work.\n\nEven before Kipling settled here, he was immensely popular in America. Two towns in Michigan named themselves after him: Rudyard and Kipling. And Kipling’s idea of the natural world as a testing ground, and of life itself as a sort of Darwinian struggle, greatly influenced later Americans writers such as Jack London, Stephen Crane, and Ernest Hemingway. But Kipling’s American adventure began to sour in the fall of 1895, when President Grover Cleveland, invoking the Monroe Doctrine, took a stand against Britain in a boundary dispute it had with Venezuela. Kipling interpreted the diplomatic spat as a personal affront, and felt betrayed by his adopted home. It was as if, he told a friend, he had been “aimed at with a decanter across a friendly dinner table.” Fearing that Britain and America might go to war, he even made plans to escape to Canada.\n\nThe last straw came the following spring, when Kipling got into a dispute with his brother-in-law, Beatty Balestier. If he hadn’t been an American and an in-law, he was the sort of character who would have fascinated Kipling: he was a boisterous but charming drinker, bankrupt, sponger, and tale-spinner. But he and the Kiplings did not get along—among other things, he thought his sister put on airs—and one afternoon a drunken Beatty came across Kipling, who was out riding his bicycle, and threatened to blow his brains out. Overreacting, as he so often did, Kipling had him arrested. The subsequent hearing attracted national attention, with reporters cramming into the Brattleboro town hall, and, in the opinion of most, the jokey, convivial local fellow came off far better than the stuffy, irascible Englishman. Kipling was so mortified that he decided he had no choice except to move back to England. “There are only two places in the world where I want to live,” he said. “Bombay and Brattleboro. And I can’t live at either.”\n\nThree years later, the Kiplings gave America another chance. They arrived just when the most tone-deaf and offensive of all Kipling’s poems, “The White Man’s Burden,” was about to be published. Kipling intended it as a sort of imperial spine-stiffener, urging America to colonize the Philippines and join England in the task of “civilizing” supposedly backward nations. And, almost as soon as he landed in New York, it was already being both praised and parodied. But the visit proved catastrophic. Even before they docked, Kipling’s six-year-old daughter, Josephine, had come down with pneumonia, and he was stricken days later. Josephine died within a couple of weeks, and Kipling remained so ill that no one dared break the news to him. In his delirium, he had vivid hallucinations, and afterward hired a stenographer to take down all that he had seen: a paranoid fever dream in which he is accused of marital infidelity and, while trying to take a submarine to visit Robert Louis Stevenson, is chased in a nightgown by a lynch mob. When he recovered, the Kiplings returned to England and he never set foot in America again.\n\nBenfey’s account briskly summarizes the rest of Kipling’s career, especially the years leading up to the First World War, when his fame and wealth increased, and his political views became more extreme. The Kiplings’ marriage became even more distant, and it suffered a lasting blow in 1915, after their youngest child, John, decided to enlist in the Army. He was underage and sickly, with eyesight as poor as Kipling’s, and was twice turned down, but his father pulled some strings and got him into an Irish regiment. How could a Kipling not fight against the Hun? On his first day of combat, at the battle of Loos, John Kipling was killed, and his parents, wracked by guilt, never got over it.\n\nBenfey ends his book in Vietnam, of all places. It seems that Kipling’s novel “Kim”—about a young boy who gets involved in the Great Game in India, spying on the Russians for the English—was practically a handbook for C.I.A. agents in Southeast Asia in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. Allen Dulles, the head of the agency, kept a copy at his bedside, and Edward Lansdale, the chief architect of the early American strategy in Vietnam, urged all his operatives to read it and pay special attention to Kim’s “counterintelligence training in awareness of illusions.” Later on, it turns out, as Americans back home became impatient for results in Vietnam, proponents of the war were always quoting—or, rather, misquoting—a little-known poem of Kipling’s (just four lines, written as a chapter heading for “The Naulahka”), saying that “you cannot hurry the East.” The phrase, Benfey writes, “wormed its way into the very highest levels of decision-making.” But what the poem actually says is that you cannot “hustle” the East, and even then, Benfey demonstrates, the word had connotations of cheating and deception. You come away from his book thinking that it might be a good idea to stop your ears whenever someone in authority starts invoking Kipling, unless it’s to quote from his “Epitaphs of the War”:\n\nIf any question why we died,\n\nTell them, because our fathers lied.\n\nWhen I was in school, we had to recite Kipling’s “If” every day, right after the Pledge of Allegiance: “If you can fill the unforgiving minute / With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, / Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, / And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!” (I had no idea, until I read Benfey’s account, that Kipling published it as an afterword to a short story about George Washington.) I doubt that such recitations take place much anymore, just as I doubt that many schoolchildren still read the Jungle Books. They watch the movies, though, and you could make a case that the Jungle Books are Kipling’s most lasting American legacy—even if the movie versions don’t always bear much resemblance to what Kipling wrote. Oddly, they seem less faithful the more realistic they become. To my mind, what makes the recent live-action revamps so unsatisfactory (Disney’s 2016 version, and “Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle,” which came out on Netflix last year) is that all the C.G.I.-enhanced realism—the glistening fur, the shining hooves, the quivering whiskers—can’t disguise the fact that Baloo, Bagheera, Kaa, and the rest were never conceived of as real animals. Mostly, they’re familiar turn-of-the-century types, the sorts of chaps you meet in books from the period: the stern headmaster (Bagheera), the kindly Scout leader (Baloo), the sinuous politico (Kaa), and so on. This is something that the many animated Jungle Books of old, especially Disney’s classic 1967 version, actually register better, for all their cuteness and sentimentalizing.\n\nWhat most of the movies do capture is the magic of Kipling’s jungle, one of those enchanted realms where so many great children’s books take place: a world with no parents and very few rules. You don’t have to be much of a Freudian to read into the Jungle Books an attempt by Kipling to rewrite his own traumatic childhood, in which he was essentially abandoned by his parents and sent from India, the only place he had ever known, to England, where he was installed in a foster home run by a tyrannical Bible-spouter. In the books, Mowgli’s main task is to bring himself up, without adult interference.\n\nThere are all those admonitions about obeying the Law of the Jungle, of course, but there’s also a revealing moment in the new Disney version when Mowgli suggests that maybe a song could be made of the law’s main formulation: “This is the Law of the Jungle—as old and as true as the sky; / And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die.” Baloo (voiced by Bill Murray) turns to him and says, scornfully, “That’s not a song—that’s propaganda.” Murray’s dismissive tone makes you wonder for an instant how much Kipling really believed in his own message. The most thrilling passages in the Jungle Books are the wild, out-of-control ones: the chases, the hunts, Mowgli’s abduction by the monkeys, the amazing moment in the second volume when Mowgli, to punish the villagers who have been persecuting the humans who took care of him, causes the jungle itself to run riot and overgrow the village. “A month later,” Kipling writes, “the place was a dimpled mound, covered with soft, green young stuff; and by the end of the Rains there was a roaring Jungle in full blast on the spot that had been under plow not six months before.” At moments like these, you begin to suspect that Kipling, though terrified of lawlessness and disorder, was also half in love with it, or, at least, with an innocent, childlike version of it: a momentary reprieve from the burdens of good behavior.\n\nAmerica was the place where he could have it both ways, a country more or less enlightened but also new and open and a little wild. Perhaps the most American thing about the Jungle Books is the way they reflect that ambivalence. “Those four years in America will be blessed unto me for all my life,” Kipling wrote to a friend, the Harvard professor Charles Eliot Norton, and, in another letter, he added, “It’s an uncivilized land (I still maintain it) but how the deuce has it wound itself around my heartstrings the way it has?” ♦"
