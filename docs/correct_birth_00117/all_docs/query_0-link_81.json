        "text": "Thanks for raising the tone/bringing a note of levity to what has perhaps been a rather too serious discussion. Which book are you referring to? Kim? Or my biography? If the former, I can understand why you suggest that. You like Kipling in reportorial mode, telling us about Lahore and India, not the more spiritual stuff. If the latter, well, I can’t possibly comment. Sadly I wrote my book well before experiencing the excitements of the Lycett-McGowan trench. (Memo to other readers – we play cricket together. I’m the wicketkeeper, he’s often first slip, and the ball sometimes inexplicably sails past us both.) Kipling wasn’t a sportsman. As you know he railed against the ‘flannelled fools at the wicket’.\n\nI guess the answer is something to do with the fact that Kipling was an imaginative writer. I don’t know about the book (I presume we’re back to Kim) being ‘almost modern’. As I think I’ve said, Kipling was often sympathetic to individual Indians, not necessarily to a mass of them. But then he wasn’t at all sympathetic to a mass of Americans either.\n\nYou raised something I haven’t really covered, which is that Kipling did have modern sensibilities. Around 1900 he was attacked by the conservative G.K. Chesterton for being too interested in modern things, particularly mechanical things, such as the motor car, telegraph, radio, cinema etc, which Chesterton thought would upset the delicate balance of British society.\n\nIf you referring to the two men themselves, I think they were similar – certainly in their approach to Britain’s empire. Haggard was trifle older, and he wrote classic romantic adventure stories, which wasn’t exactly Kipling’s thing. However he became very friendly with Haggard later in life. The two men used to discuss religious matters. As you can read in my biography, Kipling told Haggard about how he occasionally felt the love of God but felt it difficult to ‘hold’ the mystic sense of this communion. He felt that this meant mortals should get too near Him – a theme he often returned to.\n\nKipling was brought up by in his birthplace Bombay by ayahs and servants, and was almost certainly proficient in kitchen Hindi from an early age. To complicate matters, however, the language was generally known as Hindustani in those days. He left India in 1871 at the age of just five. I imagine he would have lost his Hindi pretty quickly when he was at school. However he probably picked it up just as quickly when he returned to Lahore in India (as it then was) in 1882, aged 16. There he would have been introduced to Urdu, the very similar version of Hindustani with a Persian- Arabic script. It is known that he employed a teacher to learn Persian. He was fascinated by the language’s influences - in particular, that of the 14th century Shirazi poet and mystic known as Hafiz. One of Kipling’s own poems was ‘Certain Maxims of Hafiz’.\n\nI don’t think Kipling quite had that political influence. You have to remember that he never returned to India after 1892 when he was 26. However his poems, his stories (Plain Tales from the Hills in particular), the Jungle Books and his novel Kim played a significant role in introducing a version of India to British readers. I don’t think they had any influence on the way that Britain held on to India. That sort of decision was rather more dictated by politics and economics. After about 1910, Kipling’s die-hard attitude to India was seen as an anachronism. He probably had more political influence through his lobbying for national defence after the Boer war and his vehement antipathy to Germany which lasted until his death.\n\nOne point – I’m struck by how much the questions to me today have been about Kipling and India. I think I’m right in saying that many of you were in a Kim reading group. You’ve clearly thought a lot about that novel. Please ask me a bit about other aspects of Kipling’s life and work – his poetry, for example.\n\nKipling’s attitudes sometimes jarred – I can’t deny that. He was an imperialist, with a strong sense of the duties and responsibilities of imperialism (the stuff of his poem Recessional). As a right-wing Conservative, he was totally unsympathetic to any Indian aspirations to self-determination. However he had a deep understanding of and respect for Indian culture (as is evidenced in Kim – for all its minor discrepancies etc.) His writings are full of understanding of individual Indians. In retrospect it seems to have been a strange division of attitudes to straddle. But that is the way it was. And that is why it doesn’t leave me with any enduring unease. Rather I think a knowledge of Kipling leads to a more profound understanding of the Raj\n\nLike many writers (for example, Dickens in London), Kipling liked to (and was perhaps forced by the heat and insomnia) to get up and walk during the night. He would go in the bazaar, as he wrote in In the House of Suddhoo, On the City Gate and elsewhere.\n\nRemember he was also a journalist on Lahore’s Civil and Military Gazette, so he was visiting and reporting on all sorts of local places and events.\n\nRemember also that he was an imaginative writer, so I think one can give him a little bit of licence to ‘restructure’ what he experienced. I’m not so sure of his need to ‘dominate’ however. He tried to be as objective an observer as he could. That is one of his strengths as a writer, though not necessarily as a political commentator.\n\nI think you are right about Kim being more nuanced and multi-layered than Said seemed to suggest. I believe Said himself understood that - if you read some of his other writings on the book. However, more generally, I think that Said’s approach has expanded our understanding of that novel, and of Kipling’s life and work in general. As a result of post-colonial studies, we can now see more fully Kipling’s position in history and literature. He is beginning to be appreciated as a man of his time who helps illuminate an early phase in modern Indian culture.\n\nAs I mentioned in that article I wrote in the Guardian, there is indeed an interest in Kipling among modern popular musicians, usually picking up on the folk strain in his writing. He wasn’t much interested in music per se, but he was fascinated by songs – from the music hall and elsewhere. One of his best known collections is of course Barrack-Room Ballads – a form of verse he often returned to.\n\nIf anyone wants to check this person's list of Kipling's musical settings (I know who he is), they can be found on the website of the Kipling Society\n\nI think Kipling appeals (and has always appealed) to all sorts. It’s true that his readership has usually been white, but women have definitely featured strongly from the start. The Just So Stories were written for his daughter Josephine.\n\nAs for the question of women or non-white people writing biographies of him, I can say that I know of at least three excellent biography type books on him by women – one (a literary biography, really) by Professor Jan Montefiore of Kent University, another, Kipling and Trix – a fictional biographical study of the relationship between Kipling and his sister Trix by Mary Hamer, who happens to be chair of the Kipling Society, and finally The Long Trail, a life of him written through his travels, by his kinsman Meryl MacDonald."
