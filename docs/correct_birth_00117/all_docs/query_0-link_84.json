        "text": "Bombay is both a part and a product of the culture industry in India. From the spectacle of the great Indian Bollywood cinema to its international appeal of the poverty-stricken Dharavi slums — it has come to represent the paradoxes that co-exist in the Indian mind. The city carries its migration of rich histories, scattered geographies, pidgin languages, and misfit inhabitants with an aura of pride, prejudice, and purpose. The research highlights through texts — fiction, non-fiction, films, and music, the various thematic strands that are woven in the fabric of the city. It also focuses on specific and recurring cultural artifacts and motifs in Bombay’s fictional representation. Largely addressing the questions of ‘city-ness’, cultural composition, philosophical discourses, and ‘being and becoming’, its transformation from Bombay to Mumbai is also traced. The paper probes questions of belongingness, alienation, marginalization and location — elements that comprise the identities of communities and individuals of the city. It explores the idea of an interlinked collective consciousness of Bombay which is deeply etched with the lived experiences of the people.\n\nRudyard Kipling’s The City of Dreadful Night presents Kipling’s confrontation with the colonial metropolis; Kipling, the traveler, walks through the city of Calcutta to experience a double vision of home and hell. The title, The City of Dreadful Night, juxtaposes and elides Calcutta with James Thomson’s London and its function as a dangerous metropolis. Calcutta, the city of palaces and the seat of power for the British Raj, is London’s uncanny double. While colonial ambivalence and the uncanny are throughout The City of Dreadful Night, attention to the ways embodiment factors into the work and the experience of the work brings an awareness of the work’s less explored dimensions. The first body is Kipling’s own and informs Kipling as he moves through the streets by day and night, even while his subjectivity is divided as an Anglo-Indian. There is also the “body” of the text or its material manifestation that brings these stories to the reader; the original newspaper material text points to a more immediate sociohistorical function for the narrative than the later book editions. Calcutta, the colonial city, is also a body, an enigmatic and dirty female body, prostituted by the Empire yet producing intriguing racial and cultural hybrids. Kipling’s Calcutta probes the Anglo-Indian and British imperial imaginations; Kipling, the colonial traveler, manifests viscerally his disgust and fascination for the colonial city as he discovers, here in India, the dark underbelly of London and not the glories of the Empire. In Calcutta, the divided subjectivity of Anglo-Indian narrator encounters a world of physically and psychologically unsettling mimicry and hybridity. While walking through the city, Kipling’s discoveries subvert the imperial dream by exposing the nightmare of the colonial Calcutta’s dark corners and the wonder of its vitality.\n\nRudyard Kipling was the product of a globalizing world. Aiming consciously to establish himself as an international author, he translated himself to the literary metropole from a marginal colonial background. However, his migration led him to register in his metropolitan writings a sense of cultural dislocation, jarring imperial Europe from the central position it presumed to occupy. This article draws on Marxist literary theory to locate the cause of this fin-de-siècle malaise as a tension between the universalizing power of western capital and its concomitant erosion of cultural diversity. Although Kipling’s peregrinations lead to a juggling of identities and poetic masks, he exploited this dynamic to assert himself as an articulator of identity who was ideally placed to respond to the crisis of alienation and anomie that he sensed was besetting European culture. This theme is explored through Kipling’s writings up to Kim. The concluding section discursively compares these writings with theosophical texts.\n\nThe paper analyses how the writings of Rudyard Kipling mark the tidemark of literary reflection of the Indian culture. His writings conjure images of contemporary Anglo Indian setup. Rudyard Kipling has given a pen picture of the city of Lahore and Simla which had by 1882 started wearing the look of a colonial city. His novel Kim portrays an imperialist view of the colonial India. He reproduced in his personal life both the painful cultural changes that had taken place in his society and the history of British colonialism in India. Kipling's writings seem to center mostly around India. kim actually show a real love and understanding for India. Here the author displays a vast knowledge of India, its culture, its many religious, and the lives of common folks especially the native poor. He tells good stories. Rudyard Kipling spent his early childhood with a Hindu bearer Meeta and a Goan Catholic ayah. He had spoken Hindustani before he spoke English. Though his stay in the India was short, yet it provided impetus to Rudyard Kipling to crystallize and consolidate his ideology of culture. It is elaborated with the help of his work Kim\n\nThis double special issue of the Journal of Postcolonial Writing, co-edited with Anjali Nerlekar, is geared towards the larger cultural, linguistic, publishing and creative backgrounds against which we can read “Bombay poets\" in English, in Marathi, and in Gujarati, and towards the deep symbiotic culture between writers, visual and graphic artists, publishers, admen, filmmakers or musicians in post-independence Bombay. It brings together critical essays by scholars from different disciplines (from anthropology, art and theater history, and literature with articles by William Mazzarella, Emma Bird, Graziano Krätli, Anupama Rao, Vinay Dharwadker, Shanta Gokhale) and personal memoirs by various writers and artists on the different aspects of Bombay’s creative worlds (Arun Khopkar, Jerry Pinto, Sidharth Bhatia). It also features new interviews with major literary and artistic practitioners of the time (such as Gulammohammed Sheikh, Ashok Shahane, Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, Gieve Patel, Eunice de Souza, Amit Chaudhuri, Raja Dhale, Bhalchandra Nemade), as well as key visual and textual documents of these 'Bombay worlds', some of which are published here for the first time.
