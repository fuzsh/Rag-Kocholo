        "text": "Hidden behind a blanket of trees at the back of a university in Mumbai lies the dilapidated, but once grand, former home of writer Rudyard Kipling. Fallen branches, discarded chairs and even empty bottles surround the 19th-century building, while bird droppings mar a bust of Kipling, author of such beloved novels as The Jungle Book and Kim.\n\n“The bungalow is in very bad condition and needs desperate help,” the college’s principal, Rajiv Mishra, said.\n\n“We feel cheated that such a beautiful monument has been neglected,” he adds, pointing to a rotting wooden post, precariously supporting the historic property in south Mumbai.\n\nThe “Kipling Bungalow”, as locals affectionately call it, is one of several mansions in the teeming city, once associated with famous residents but now in ruin.\n\nNearby stands the former colonial home of Lord Harris, an ex-governor of then-named Bombay, widely credited with making cricket the most popular sport in India.\n\nThe gothic building housed school classrooms until four years ago, when pupils were moved out because the crumbling structure had become too weak and hazardous. A few kilometres away in plush Malabar Hill sits the previously imposing residence of Mohamed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan and its first governor-general.\n\nThe stately home hosted critical talks between Jinnah and India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru on partition of the subcontinent, but today its downtrodden appearance belies its historical significance.\n\nHeritage campaigners lament the demise of such buildings, blaming red tape and claiming politicians and developers are more concerned with constructing sparkly new luxury towers than preserving Mumbai’s architectural history.\n\n“The Kipling Bungalow is just a very sad reflection of bureaucratic hurdles... creating the death of a historic building,” renowned architect Abha Narain Lambah, who specialises in conservation, said.\n\nThe wood and stone structure, its green paint peeling, is situated on the grounds of an art school, whose first principal was John Lockwood Kipling, Rudyard’s father.\n\nBuilt in 1882, 17 years after Rudyard was born, the house was home to Lockwood Kipling and subsequent deans until the early 2000s, by which time it had sunk into such disrepair that it was rendered uninhabitable.\n\n“We feel that Lockwood must have had Rudyard stay here and write so we call it the ‘Kipling Bungalow’,” explains Mishra, who wants the Maharashtra government to restore it without delay.\n\nHe says officials plan to turn the building into a gallery exhibiting students’ work and that of decorated artists, and have issued a tender for the contract.\n\nThe building has been caught in a tug-of-war between the college and the government for years over what its restoration should look like, but Mishra hopes renovations will finally start in around six months.\n\nA short walk away, work has already begun on the former Mumbai residence of batsman and acclaimed cricket administrator George Harris, who was governor of the city from 1890-1895.\n\nHarris captained England and during his tenure on the subcontinent “did much to lay down foundations for the expansion of the game in India”, according to Cricinfo website.\n\nA Mumbai inter-schools cricket tournament called the Harris Shield is testament to his legacy, but his former home was allowed to come close to collapse before long overdue maintenance work started."
