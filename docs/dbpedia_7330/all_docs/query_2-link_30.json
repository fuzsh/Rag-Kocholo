        "text": "CaliROC, a program of the California Center for Cooperative Development (CCCD), is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that promotes cooperatives as a vibrant model to address the economic and social needs of California’s communities. CCCD supports the myriad of cooperatives in California (agricultural, arts and crafts, child care, energy, housing, worker-owned, etc.) with start-up, management, and other technical assistance. The Center’s Community and Economic Development Programs specifically highlight cooperative projects that promote opportunities for people with low and moderate incomes, as well as economically disadvantaged communities, regions, and neighborhoods. Such projects include education about how cooperatives can be effective in stimulating economic growth, income generation, home ownership opportunities, cost savings, or strategies for bringing needed products and services to underserved areas.\n\nRooted in its service to agricultural workers, Community and Shelter Assistance Corporation (CASA of Oregon) improves the lives of Oregonians in underserved communities by building affordable housing, neighborhood facilities and programs that increase families’ financial security. CASA of Oregon’s three departments include Manufactured Housing Cooperative Development (MHCD), Housing and Community Development, and Family Economic Opportunity (FEO). Through these programs, CASA of Oregon seeks to provide high quality, affordable housing and community facilities that improve the lives of families, their neighborhoods and communities, as well as increase access by historically underserved families to financial services and educational opportunities that enhance family economic sustainability and security.\n\nCooperative Development Institute (CDI) is the source for cooperative business development in the Northeast. CDI’s mission is to build a cooperative economy through the creation and development of successful cooperative enterprises and networks in diverse communities in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and New York. Our organization provides education, training and technical assistance to cooperatively-structured enterprises in all business sectors, including food, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, housing, energy, arts, retail, service, health. Founded in 1995, CDI is based in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, with a staff of 11 spread through five northeast states.\n\nLEAP ROC is a program of LEAP Housing, an Idaho-based nonprofit affordable housing developer headquartered in Boise. LEAP works to create and preserve affordable housing across the state, deploying programs across the full spectrum of housing. These programs include short-term rental, long-term rental, resident owned manufactured housing cooperatives, shared equity ownership, and single-family homeownership. With 199 affordable housing opportunities created and preserved since 2016, LEAP aims to bring 1,000 affordable housing opportunities to the state of Idaho by 2026.\n\nNeighborWorks Montana’s mission is to create opportunities for families and individuals across Montana to live in affordable homes in strong communities. The organization works in three primary program areas: Housing Counseling and Education, Lending and Manufactured Housing. The organization was formed in 1998 with a network of more than 30 housing organization partners including non-profits, state and federal agencies, and private sector lenders. A network approach is fundamental to the success of the organization, in serving a vast and rural state. The work of NeighborWorks Montana has been recognized nationally, including a first-place award from NeighborWorks America in 2010 for the number of potential homebuyers who have been educated. Since its inception, NeighborWorks Montana has secured more than $44.1 million in operational funding, and more than $69.1 million in capital funding for first- and second-mortgage lending. NeighborWorks Montana has been a ROC USA® Certified Technical Assistance Provider since April 2010.\n\nNorthcountry Cooperative Foundation (NCF) a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has as its mission “transforming lives and communities through cooperative enterprise”. In acting on its mission, over the last 10 years, NCF has carried out seven manufactured housing cooperative projects – six in its home state of Minnesota and one in Wisconsin in transactions approaching $19 million with 500 units of housing preserved and strengthened through resident ownership. In addition, to its work in resident-owned communities, NCF is one of several designated cooperative development centers nationally, and so provides ongoing training, technical assistance, and organizational development support via its Traveling Cooperative Institute for food cooperatives and toward encouraging familiarity with the cooperative model through a broad effort to engage rural youth in its service area. NCF staff has a core staff of six seasoned multifamily housing development, finance, and organizational development professionals and a finance consultant engaged in its work.\n\nEstablished in 1983, ROC-NH™, a program of the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund, helps residents of manufactured-home parks cooperatively buy the land under their houses, build value and security in their homes and create stronger, vibrant communities. It is the only statewide program in N.H. that provides loans, training and technical assistance to convert manufactured-home parks into cooperatives owned and governed by their residents. One hundred nine resident-owned communities (ROCs) in New Hampshire provide affordable housing for more than 6,000 families. ROC-NH does this by: Helping homeowners organize co-ops and decide whether purchasing their parks is in their long-term best interest; lending and/or helping arrange loans and grants for the co-op’s predevelopment work, deposit, purchase and rehabilitation projects; helping the co-op establish a board of directors and committees to run it; and providing ongoing technical support and training. ROC-NH is the Community Loan Fund’s oldest and best-known program. It has been recognized for excellence by the Opportunity Finance Network, Fannie Mae Foundation, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, National Environmental Education & Training Foundation and Citizens Bank.\n\nROC Northwest is program of Northwest Cooperative Development Center, a nonprofit organization devoted to assisting new and existing cooperative businesses, from daycare centers to credit unions.

We have a long history of collaborating with communities, governments, economic development agencies and other cooperatives, sharing expertise and building cross-sector support for new and existing cooperatives. Housing cooperatives empower residents to collectively take control of their housing future, and NWCDC provides facilitation, advising, analysis and access to information and tools for cooperatives.\n\nThistle is part of the heart and soul of Boulder County.
