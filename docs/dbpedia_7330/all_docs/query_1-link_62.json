        "text": "A new series based on John Grisham’s 1995 novel “The Rainmaker” and the 1997 film adaptation has been greenlit at the USA Network. Grisham serves as executive producer on the series alongside Jason Blum, while Blumhouse Television and Lionsgate Television serve as the studios.\n\nThe official logline reads, “Fresh out of law school, Rudy Baylor goes head-to-head with courtroom lion Leo Drummond as well as his law school girlfriend. Rudy, along with his boss and her disheveled paralegal, uncover two connected conspiracies surrounding the mysterious death of their client’s son.”\n\nMichael Seitzman will write “The Rainmaker,” having co-written the pilot with Jason Richman. Along with Grisham and Blum, executive producers include Seitzman, Richman and David Gernert.\n\n“The Rainmaker” greenlight comes as concluded USA Network titles “Suits” and “White Collar” resurge in popularity following their additions to Netflix. The NBCUniversal-owned cabler currently only airs one scripted series, “Chucky,” which also airs on Syfy.\n\nAdditionally, the news follows Blumhouse’s recently set multi-picture deal with Lionsgate to reinterpret the studio’s library titles.\n\nSeitzman is best known for creating “Code Black,” the medical drama that ran on CBS for three seasons from 2015 to 2018, and “Intelligence,” the action series that ran on CBS for one season in 2014. He also wrote the Blumhouse film “She Will Rise” starring Elizabeth Moss as former Congresswoman Katie Hill.\n\nRichman created the ABC crime drama “Stumptown,” which ran for one season on ABC from 2019 to 2020. He also wrote and executive produced on “The Walking Dead” spinoff “Daryl Dixon,” which will air its second season on AMC this fall.\n\nSeitzman is repped by WME and Paul Hastings. Richman is repped by CAA, Fuel Filmworks and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern."
