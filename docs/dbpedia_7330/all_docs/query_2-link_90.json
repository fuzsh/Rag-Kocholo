        "text": "NBC Sports has carried the U.S. broadcast rights for the English Premier League since first acquiring the package in 2016, and the media giant will continue to be the home for Premier League fans in the USA through at least 2028 after a new rights deal was signed.\n\nIn recent seasons there have been slight changes to the way that NBC delivers Premier League matches to fans, including the integration of its Peacock streaming service alongside the televised coverage offered on its English- and Spanish-language linear TV channels.\n\nWhile Telemundo and Universo continue to be the main destinations for Spanish-language broadcasts, there has been a new home for English-language television broadcasts since 2022.\n\nUSA Network is the primary English-language TV channel carrying Premier League matches after NBCSN (NBC Sports Network) was shut down following several seasons as the home for EPL broadcasts. The likes of CNBC, SYFY, and Bravo are used as overflow channels, as on the final day of the season when all matches air at the same time.\n\nMORE: Peacock Premier League schedule for 2022/23 season\n\nPremier League TV schedule, live streams (Sunday, May 28)\n\nDate Match Time (ET) TV/Streaming Sun, May 28 Everton vs Bournemouth 11:30 a.m. USA Network,\n\nFubo, Peacock Sun, May 28 Leeds vs Tottenham 11:30 a.m. CNBC, Telemundo,\n\nFubo, Peacock Sun, May 28 Leicester City vs West Ham 11:30 a.m. SYFY, Fubo, Peacock Sun, May 28 Man United vs Fulham 11:30 a.m. Bravo, Fubo, Peacock Sun, May 28 Arsenal vs Wolves 11:30 a.m. Peacock Sun, May 28 Brentford vs Man City 11:30 a.m. Peacock Sun, May 28 Chelsea vs Newcastle 11:30 a.m. Peacock Sun, May 28 Southampton vs Liverpool 11:30 a.m. Peacock Sun, May 28 Aston Villa vs Brighton 11:30 a.m. Peacock Sun, May 28 C.

That was no longer the case beginning January 1, 2022.\n\nThat's because NBC decided to discontinue NBCSN, leaving its cable sports programming — including Premier League matches and coverage — to be broadcast on USA Network.\n\nThe permanent move happened on New Year's Day 2022 with a Premier League tripleheader that kicked off the 2022 sports calendar on USA Network.\n\nTelemundo and Universo continue to carry select Premier League matches in Spanish.\n\nHere's the complete list of NBC outlets carrying Premier League matches in the United States for the 2022/23 season:\n\nTV channels: NBC, USA Network (Bravo, CNBC, SYFY on final day)\n\nSpanish-language TV: Telemundo, Universo\n\nStreaming: Peacock, NBCSports.com (for authenticated cable, satellite & telco subscribers), Fubo\n\nHow to watch USA Network\n\nUSA Network can be found on most cable and satellite packages, including:\n\nAT&T U-verse HD: Channel 1125\n\nCharter Spectrum HD: Channel 760\n\nComcast XFINITY TV HD: Channel 823\n\nCox Communication HD: Channel 1028\n\nDirecTV HD: Channel 242\n\nDISH Network HD: Channel 105\n\nTime Warner Cable HD: Channel 55, 101\n\nVerizon FiOS: Channel 550\n\nChannel listings may vary by market, and could be updated by the provider to a different channel at any time.\n\nUSA Network is also available via most streaming services, including:\n\nFubo\n\nYoutube TV\n\nSling TV (Blue package)\n\nHulu + Live TV\n\nDirecTV Stream\n\nSubscribers to Fubo will be able to stream matches as usual when they air on USA Network, NBC network, Telemundo and Universo.\n\nMORE: How to watch the Premier League in the USA in 2022/23\n\nWhat happened to NBCSN?\n\nNBC Sports made it known it was shutting down NBCSN midway through 2021, using the rest of the calendar year to message fans about the change taking effect Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nThe network characterized the move as \"part of a larger transition\" in an internal memo that was made public.\n\nIt's widely speculated that the shutdown of NBCSN was part of the company's desire to push more sports content to its Peacock streaming service, hoping to entice fans to pay for a monthly subscription.\n\nNBCSN was first launched in 1995 as the Outdoor Life Network (OLN), carrying mainly outdoor sports, and then was rebranded to Versus (2006) with the acquisition of other sports properties, before ultimately becoming NBCSN in 2012.\n\nMORE: Premier League team-by-team schedules for the 2022/23 season\n\nWhich sports are on USA Network?\n\nIn addition to the Premier League, NBC shifted coverage of all its other sports to USA Network:\n\nNASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series races\n\nINDYCAR\n\nOlympic Games\n\nOlympics sports\n\nGolf (The Open, AIG Women's Open, U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open)\n\nCollege sports (Atlantic 10 basketball)\n\nHorse racing\n\nCycling (Tour de France)\n\nMotor Sports (IMSA, Monter Jam, Supercross)\n\nUSA Network already serves as home of WWE wrestling with Monday Night Raw and WWE NXT on Tuesdays.\n\nDuring the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics, USA Network had previously served as the destination for live coverage of track and field, beach volleyball, indoor volleyball and softball."
