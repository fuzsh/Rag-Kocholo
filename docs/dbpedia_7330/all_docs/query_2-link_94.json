        "text": "Team USA will play Serbia in the men’s basketball semifinal at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Thursday, Aug. 8, at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nYou can watch the game for free with trials from Fubo or DIRECTV Stream, and it will also be available on Sling and Peacock.\n\nSet the first of these three to record the semifinal ahead of time if you don’t plan to watch live. Peacock will automatically upload events as they are completed to watch later. NBC will also air clips from the game as part of their Primetime coverage on Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nToday’s game will be played at 3 p.m. ET in Bercy Arena. So far, the United States Men’s Basketball Team is undefeated, beating Serbia 110-84, South Sudan 103-86, Puerto Rico 104-83 and Brazil 122-87.\n\nSince men’s basketball was added as a medal sport in 1936, the United States has taken home the gold medal in 16 out of 20 Olympics. In the years they weren’t on top, they were still on the podium with silver once and bronze twice. The only year they weren’t was at the 1980 Moscow games, when the United States boycotted the games due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That year, 80 countries participated in the Olympics while 65 other countries boycotted in addition to the United States.\n\nIn the Paris Olympics, Serbia has gone undefeated apart from the game they lost to Team USA. They beat Puerto Rico 107-66, South Sudan 96-85 and Australia 95-90. The team’s most recent medal in the event was a silver in the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nWatch Team USA vs. Serbia in the men’s basketball semifinal today, Aug. 8, at 3/2c. The winner will play the winner of France vs. Germany on Saturday, Aug. 10.\n\nWhere to watch:"
