All this content is easy to miss if you’ve recently cut the cord on cable, but, luckily, there are a few easy solutions. Several live TV streaming services carry USA Network, which means you can watch the channel without a cable package. Read on for a full guide on the best ways to stream USA Network if you don’t have cable.\n\nHow to Watch USA Network Without Cable\n\nMost major live TV streaming services carry USA Network. Here are some of our top suggestions, including a few with free trials that you can use to get free USA Network streams.\n\nStream USA Network on DirecTV Stream\n\nDirecTV Stream offers USA Network in all of its packages, including its most affordable package, the Entertainment plan. This package starts with a five-day free trial and costs $79.99 a month after that. Besides USA Network, DirecTV Stream Entertainment carries a total of more than 75 channels including ESPN, CBS, and TNT.\n\nStream USA Network on Hulu + Live TV\n\nHulu + Live TV is another one of the best ways to stream USA Network without cable. We think Hulu + Live TV is excellent as an all-in-one streaming package, delivering access to more than 95 live TV channels, Hulu (on-demand), ESPN+, and Disney+ — all for $76.99 a month, after a three-day free trial.\n\nStream USA Network on Sling\n\nIf you’re looking for a more affordable cable streaming service, check out Sling. You can get USA Network streams as part of Sling’s Blue plan, which costs $45 a month. This plan carries 46 channels in total, but you can upgrade to Sling Orange + Blue for more coverage.\n\nStream USA Network on fubo\n\nIn terms of channel selection, fubo is a winner. The streamer carries up to 250+ channels, including USA Network in every package. Plans start at $79.99 a month, but you get a seven-day free trial to start.\n\nCan You Watch USA Network for Free?\n\nIf you’re only looking to watch USA Network for a limited time, you can take advantage of the free trials from DirecTV Stream, Hulu + Live TV, and fubo to watch USA Network for free without cable. You will need to enter a payment method to sign up for the free trials, but you won’t be charged anything as long as you cancel before the trial is over.\n\nWhat Is On USA Network Right Now?\n\nUSA Network is especially crucial to have access to right now, as events from the 2024 Paris Olympics are being broadcast on the channel. Certain events, from Soccer matches to Basketball games, will be shown on the channel, so you’ll want to get one of the above streaming services to watch the channel. Plus, all of the above services will also get you access to NBC, which is showing other key Olympic events in 2024."
