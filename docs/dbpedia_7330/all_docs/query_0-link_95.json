        "text": "The field of accounting is rapidly changing. Beyond 2030, the Future accountant will possess a unique set of skills. Listen to our student interviews and find out how the next generation of leaders is addressing these issues.\n\nArt Kleiner presents the 7 Principles of Responsible Technology from his book The AI Dilemma. Kleiner is then joined by Jannie Wentzel and Chris Easton for an open discussion on AI and Accountants.\n\nIn June 2023, CAW Network USA hosted an in-person conference at Fordham University in New York City. This first session was on leadership.\n\nThe wave of continual growth in advisory boards has left a new high-water mark, doubling the number of advisory board professionals since 2019. The surging use of these problem solving/thinking systems is seeing leaders better supported, as they carefully navigate the future and consider how their decisions are being made. Gain insights into why advisory boards are the new trend in business and governance today.\n\nPlease join chapter president Duncan Torrance, for our Arizona chapter FALL PARTY on Saturday October 12th 2024. Meet at 10am at the entrance to the Desert Botanical Gardens. It will be an opportunity to connect with fellow local CAs. Please register to attend so we have an idea on numbers. Venue is Desert Botanical Gardens 1201 N. Galvin Parkway, Phoenix, AZ 85008. We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nWe invite young Chartered Accountants (under 35) working abroad to share their experiences through short, selfie-style videos for our Global Connectedness social media campaign. Create a short video, capturing your journey authentically and share it with us.\n\nThe inaugural Chartered Accountants Worldwide Global Young Leaders Think Tank has set the stage for a shared vision for the future of the profession. The drive to attract and retain talent is not news for anyone in the trenches of day-to-day recruitment and retention, but for the accountancy profession, the challenge of attracting new entrants is a global one â€“ and a global problem requires global thinking."
