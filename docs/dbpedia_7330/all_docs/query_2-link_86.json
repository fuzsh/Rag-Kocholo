        "text": "The Australia women’s national basketball team plays the United States on Tuesday in the semifinals of the 2024 Olympic tournament.\n\nGame Info\n\nWhen: Friday, Aug. 9 at 5:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Accor Arena, Paris\n\nTV: USA network.You can also stream on Peacock.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nThe Opals and Team USA are the two most established world powers in these Olympic Games. In fact they played each other for the Olympic Gold in 2000, 2004 and 2008. The Opals have also won the FiBA Women’s World Cup in 2006 when Team USA won bronze that time.\n\nWhy am I writing about events from 20 or more years ago here? It’s because Opals center Lauren Jackson and Team USA guard Diana Taurus have been on their national teams for all in Jackson’s case, and nearly all of those battles in Taurasi’s because she was just entering college in 2000. This appears to be the last Olympics for both given that both are above 40 years old and are still performing professionally!\n\nToday’s Opals are led by Alanna Smith, Ezi Magbegor, Sami Whitcomb and Washington Mystics guard Jade Melbourne. And Team USA is led by A’ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and a bunch of other WNBA All-Stars. I get it, this is supposed to be the Australians’ funeral march.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way. The Opals have a lot of WNBA talent. They also are a bit more used to playing with each other than the Americans. Finally, the crowd in Paris will likely root for the Opals because they are underdogs.\n\nIn some ways, the Opals have advanced farther than many expected before these games began. But expect a competitive match for much of the first half, though the Americans’ talent advantage should come through in the end."
