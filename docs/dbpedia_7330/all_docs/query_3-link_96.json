        "text": "Miss USA 2024\n\nAlma Cooper of Michigan, USA\n\nAlma serves as a 2nd lieutenant and Military Intelligence Officer in the United States Army. After graduating in the top 5% of her class from Westpoint, she was awarded the opportunity to earn her Masters in Data Science at Stanford University as a Knight Hennessy Scholar. She is passionate about addressing food insecurity in our country, and globally. Her ultimate goal is to make healthy foods available to all people. Alma’s life motto is “Demand Excellence” which she inherited from her parents who forged a path toward their American Dream. She is honored to ask to serve as Miss USA.\n\nMAKE AN IMPACT\n\nRepresent your community and have the opportunity to make a life-changing impact!\n\nAre your sights set on the stars? Well get ready for more than you could ever dream of, all wrapped up in the life-changing experience that is Miss USA.\n\nStep onto the stage that can pave the way for the rest of your life as 51 women from across the nation vie for the ultimate title of Miss USA. This is the coveted crown that inspires young women to claim their beauty and voice!\n\nOUR INITIATIVES\n\nBeyond the red carpet glamour and luxurious prize package, the platform of Miss USA is synonymous with giving back. Charity and community engagement are at the core of all that we do, so get ready to meet the people that make our work truly profound. From exciting fund-raising events, to heart-warming visits, and adventures in awareness, at Miss USA, each of our initiatives matter.\n\nWhen I was crowned Miss Georgia USA, I never expected to immerse myself in the work, and the uncertainty, I encountered during my reign. Yet through all of it, I truly feel I came out a stronger, more intelligent, and appreciative woman. I grew steadfast in my convictions and expanded my network, including friends and mentors, that has since led to wonderful job opportunities! My crown allowed me to share my passions and expand on my initiative, #RiseUp: Impact Through the Arts. Although I didn’t win THE crown of Miss USA, I can’t say I lost in anyway as a person. My journey is just beginning, and I have the Miss USA Organization to thank for the bountiful opportunities that continue to present themselves to me and allow me to further grow into the woman I aim to be.\n\nAlyssa Beasley | Miss Georgia USA 2020\n\nMiss USA gave me community, strength, and a beautiful goal to work towards during a pandemic year. I am grateful for the friendships I made throughout this wonderful experience; so much so that my Miss Missouri USA, Miss Nebraska USA, and Miss Tennessee USA will be my bridesmaids this December! Competing in the Miss USA Organization has been one of the absolute best finishing schools for me. There is no better place to learn how to present yourself, hone in your interview skills, and learn to develop your brand. This competition has helped me grow my confidence and find my true voice. The key is to surround yourself with incredible people and get outside of your comfort zone; it is only then you can truly find your full potential. This is what my experience at Miss USA has done for me.\n\nMonique Evans | Miss Florida USA 2020\n\nBeing Miss North Carolina USA has pushed me out of my comfort zone and connected me with incredible people across North Carolina. It has given me opportunities to make an impact by working with different charitable organizations. It’s a once in a lifetime experience and something I will always be\n\nJane Axhoj | Miss North Carolina USA 2020"
