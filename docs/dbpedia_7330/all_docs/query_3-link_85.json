The region has hosted television productions (Amazon’s Modern Love series, HBO’s Succession, Showtime’s award-winning Escape At Dannemora, and USA Network’s The Sinner), star-studded feature films (Focus Feature’s The Place Beyond The Pines starring Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, Columbia Pictures’ Salt starring Angelina Jolie) and independent films (Fourth Man Out, As You Are, and Shoplifters of the World).\n\nCheck out the New York State Location Library for potential locations in Capital Region\n\nCheck out the Qualified Production Facilities in Capital Region\n\nRegional Offices:\n\nColumbia County Film Office\n\nAnn Cooper\n\n800-724-1846\n\n[email protected]\n\nFilm Albany\n\nDeborah A.

Filmmakers come for the local crew, the great facilities, and the wide variety of filming options: city centers, including Auburn and Oswego; picture-perfect lakeside villages like Skaneateles and Aurora (founded 1799); sloping vineyards along Cayuga Lake; the beaches and lighthouses of Lake Ontario; and classic college campuses like Colgate University, Syracuse University and Wells College.\n\nCheck out the New York State Location Library for potential locations in Central NY\n\nCheck out the Qualified Production Facilities in Central NY\n\nRegional Office:\n\nSyracuse Film Office\n\nEric Vinal\n\n315-952-5801\n\n[email protected]\n\nCounties: Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Ontario, Orleans, Seneca, Wayne, Wyoming, Yates\n\nRochester, the third largest city in New York State, is also where American filmmaking was born— thanks to George Eastman and his Eastman Kodak Company. That tradition continues today through the large local community of skilled crew and talent backed up by equipment rental houses, soundstages including Rochester Institute of Technology’s state-of-the-art MAGIC Spell Studios, industry vendors, and more. Boasting over 1,000 waterfalls, the 2nd largest wine producing region in the US, historic towns along the Erie Canal, Lake Ontario beaches and lighthouses, and urban centers including Rochester, Geneva and Batavia– the Finger Lakes has a wide range of looks and locations.\n\nCheck out the New York State Location Library for potential locations in the Finger Lakes\n\nCheck out the Qualified Production Facilities in the Finger Lakes\n\nRegional Office:\n\nRochester/Finger Lakes Film Commission\n\nNora Brown\n\n585-279-8308\n\n[email protected]\n\nCounties: Nassau, Suffolk.\n\nAdjacent to New York City, Nassau County is one of the busiest production hubs in the state outside the five boroughs.

Notable productions that have filmed on Long Island include: Apple TV+’s Dickinson and On The Rocks, HBO’s Bad Education, The Plot Against America and The Undoing, Amazon’s Hunters and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and 20th Century Studios’ The Greatest Showman.\n\nCheck out the New York State Location Library for potential locations on Long Island\n\nCheck out the Qualified Production Facilities on Long Island\n\nRegional Offices:\n\nNassau County Film Commission\n\nNugent Cantileno\n\n516-572-0470\n\n[email protected]\n\nSuffolk County Film Commission\n\nDiana J.

Its proximity to New York City offers economic advantages that draw producers to the region. The availability of experienced crew and talent also is attractive to filmmakers, as well as the unique settings offered by film-friendly upscale suburbs, small riverside towns and the majestic Catskill Mountains. Some notable productions that have filmed in the region include: HBO’s I Know This Much Is True, Paramount Pictures’ A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II, Netflix’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things, Showtime’s award-winning Billions and NBC’s FBI – Most Wanted.\n\nCheck out the New York State Location Library for potential locations in Mid-Hudson\n\nCheck out the Qualified Production Facilities in Mid-Hudson\n\nRegional Offices:\n\nDutchess County Film Office\n\nMelaine Rottkamp\n\n845-463-5432\n\n[email protected]\n\nHudson Valley Film Commission\n\nLaurent Rejto\n\n845-419-8104\n\n[email protected]\n\nNewburgh Film Office\n\nEllen Fillo\n\n845-569-7386\n\n[email protected]\n\nOrange County Film Office\n\nAmanda Dana\n\n845-615-3860\n\n[email protected]\n\nRockland County Film Office\n\nLucy Redzeposki\n\n845-364-2172\n\n[email protected]\n\nUlster County Film Office\n\nLisa Berger\n\n845-340-3556\n\n[email protected]\n\nWestchester County Film Office\n\nNatasha Caputo\n\n914-995-8502\n\n[email protected]\n\nYonkers Mayor's Office of Film and Photography\n\nMelissa Goldberg\n\n914-377-6043\n\n[email protected]\n\nCounties: Fulton, Herkimer, Montgomery, Oneida, Otsego, Schoharie\n\nWith homes dating back to the 1790s, framed by verdant, rolling foothills of the northern Catskill Mountains, the six counties of the Mohawk Valley are at the geographic center of upstate New York. Along the Mohawk River, the cities of Utica, Rome and Little Falls provide period downtowns, pristine suburbs and aging industrial sites, while just a few miles further south are forests, farmland and historic villages like Cooperstown, home of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Film friendly communities, great locations and experienced local crew are drawing independent films like the Tribeca Film Festival award-winning The Half of It and the Sundance Film Festival award-winning We The Animals.\n\nCheck out the New York State Location Library for potential locations in Mohawk Valley\n\nCheck out the Qualified Production Facilities in Mohawk Valley\n\nRegional Office:\n\nFilm Otsego\n\nGreg Klein\n\n315-527-3082\n\n[email protected]\n\nFilm Utica\n\nPaul Buckley\n\n315-534-1366\n\n[email protected]\n\nCounties: Bronx, Kings, New York, Richmond, Queens\n\nNew York City is the single most filmed location in the world, and it’s easy to understand why. From the glass and steel canyons of Manhattan to bustling diverse neighborhoods, the Big Apple has a location for everyone. And as one of the largest and most highly developed production centers in the world, with an all-star cast of A-list residents, a huge and diverse talent pool, state-of-the-art stages and post-production facilities, industry vendors, and the best crews in the world, New York is camera-ready and open for business. There are also many State-run and film-friendly properties including its vast subway system, Grand Central Terminal, Hudson River Park, Roosevelt Island, airports, bridges and tunnels. The five boroughs also have the largest amount of qualified production facilities in the state. That’s why projects like NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Law & Order: SVU, CBS’s FBI, FBI: Most Wanted and Bull, Showtime’s Billions and City On A Hill, Amazon’s award-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Hulu’s Ramy, and FX’s Pose, to name a few, choose New York. From the Joker stairs in the Bronx to The Godfather’s Lower East Side, You’ve Got Mail atop the Empire State Building or the Brooklyn streets in Do The Right Thing, New York City is an unforgettable onscreen character unlike any other.\n\nCheck out the New York State Location Library for potential locations in New York City\n\nCheck out the Qualified Production Facilities in New York City\n\nRegional Office:\n\nNYC Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment\n\nPat Kaufman\n\n212-489-6710\n\n[email protected]\n\nCounties: Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lewis, St. Lawrence\n\nBordered by Lake Ontario & the St. Lawrence Seaway to the West, Canada to the North and Lake Champlain to the East, the region also includes the Adirondack State Park—the largest wilderness preserve outside of Alaska. The Adirondacks are home to vast forests and rolling farmlands, towns and villages, mountains and valleys, lakes, ponds and free-flowing rivers, private lands and public forest. The region also encompasses the village of Lake Placid, which has twice hosted the Olympics. And the Thousand Islands area boasts some unique locations including actual castles.
