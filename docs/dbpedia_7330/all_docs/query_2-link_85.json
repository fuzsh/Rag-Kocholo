        "text": "Daytime coverage and primetime storytelling on TV and a robust streaming effort are a hit with fans\n\nWith just a few days left in the Paris 2024 festivities, NBC Sports’ Olympics dual production strategy — focusing on live coverage during the day and deeper storytelling during primetime — can be officially deemed a hit with viewers. Whether it’s live daytime coverage streaming on Peacock and airing on NBCU’s television networks or the packaged primetime show on NBC and USA each night, the numbers have been impressive. Throw in the massive success of Gold Zone on Peacock, and the NBC Sports Group production, operations, and engineering teams will have plenty to be proud of come the Closing Ceremony on Sunday.\n\nNBCUniversal’s nightly Paris Olympics show (8-11 p.m. ET) has dominated primetime, topping 13 million viewers each night across NBC and USA Network, according to Nielsen. In addition, the show accounts for 12 of the 19 most-watched primetime shows in 2024, excluding NFL. Beginning with the Opening Ceremony, NBCUniversal has a posted 12-day Total Audience Delivery average of 32.2 million viewers across the combined live Paris Prime (2-5 p.m. ET) and U.S. primetime (8-11 p.m. ET/PT) time periods — up 77% from Tokyo (18.2 million). In addition, as of Wednesday morning, NBCUniversal’s streaming of Paris 2024 – led by Peacock – has surpassed all prior Olympics combined (16.8 billion minutes total for previous Summer and Winter Games).\n\nWith just three days until the Closing Ceremony in Paris, SVG sat down with Darryl Jefferson, SVP, engineering and technology, NBC Sports and Olympics, to discuss the dual focus on daytime and primetime, how the Stamford, CT, broadcast center has evolved since the Tokyo and Beijing Games, the complicated transmission scheme connecting Paris and Stamford, NBC’s Gold Zone success, and what technologies he’s most excited about both for Paris and in the future.\n\nNBC Sports’ Stamford, CT, broadcast center is producing the Paris 2024 Olympics.As an example, we had a number of mobile units in our parking lot during Tokyo and Beijing to augment what we had in the building. But we’ve done so much construction here in the last [few years] that we actually have only one mobile unit here [for Paris 2024] despite its being significantly larger. Everything else is using internal resources that we’ve built, rebuilt, rethought, or reimagined [over the past two years]. Why that makes sense is that we’re able to cover so many more sports concurrently because we’re able to shift resources that are already in the building.\n\nNow we can have a team onsite with local reporters or LiveU crews or similar types of things on the frontend and tcan add expert commentary or analysis or a control room to integrate the show here [in Stamford]. Also, someone can be in the same chair and pivot from one sport to the next in a remote environment. It has proved to be a really good formula for us.\n\nHow do you see these facility enhancements benefiting NBC Sports beyond the Olympics?\n\nIt’s going to be a huge leg up. These are things that we can use year-round when we do other sports. We have done this all in a sustainable way so that we can do more sports and events year-round. We built things that will be able to help us do an even larger volume of content than we’re already doing. That is going to serve us very well and give us a lot more bandwidth to bring on new [properties], like our [expanded] Big Ten deal, or — and I’m excited to finally publicly be able to say — bring the NBA back to NBC in 2025.\n\nHow are you bringing all the feeds from Paris into Stamford?\n\nWe have what we lovingly call the subway map, illustrating all the different services and individual video paths coming back to Stamford, and it’s bigger than ever. We have a copy of the [subway map] from the Torino 2006 Games, and it looks miniature compared with this year’s [transmission scheme]. That shows just how much everything has grown.\n\nI would say one of the big headlines is the core [contribution network] for Tokyo was made up five redundant 10-Gbps undersea fibers. For Paris, there are four redundant 120-Gbps fibers. So it has multiplied greatly in a short period of time.\n\nWe also have full connectivity between [Stamford] and all of our primary sets: the café set at the Globe Café, the set at the OBS TV tower, and our museum set. That connective tissue is very important and, although it comes with its own set of logistical and technology challenges, allows us to create all this amazing studio programming from Paris.\n\nIt goes beyond just our footprint of Stamford, which is obviously substantial. We also have feeds landing in Englewood Cliffs, [NJ]; Dry Creek in Colorado; at Telemundo in Miami and Puerto Rico; and at 30 Rock in New York.\n\nIn terms of day-to-day production workflows, how does NBC’s Paris 2024 operation compare with Tokyo and Beijing?\n\nNearly all of our shows are now a split-remote production: there’s a frontend in Paris, and half of the production team is here in Stamford. That’s a new approach. We used to have smaller production units that were all onsite for the last number of Games, but we have used some of the lessons from COVID to create a very efficient remote-style production [model]. We are split remote almost everywhere, with the exception of the big three [venues] — track and field, gymnastics, and swimming — where we have full-blown mobile units onsite giving us finished programming. But almost every other production that we’re doing is a split remote production.\n\nAnother big difference is, we have the primetime-control room here in Stamford on purpose. We had it here out of necessity in Beijing [due to COVID logistical issues], but, for Paris, it’s by design. That’s a sea change for us. And it means that folks like [NBC Olympics Production Executive Producer/President]Molly Solomon and [producer] Rob Hyland and other key production people are here in Stamford instead of in-country for the first time, which is very exciting and creates a very different atmosphere.\n\nWhat has been the biggest difference on the technology side for the at-home operation in Stamford?\n\nI’d have to say there are two: the first is that we’ve made a huge shift to ST 2110 and Dante pretty much across the board. We’re largely out of the SDI and analog domain and areprepared for an IP-based future.\n\nSecond, we wanted to move to a single format so everything everywhere is in 1080p50 HDR — both here and at the IBC in Paris — and we convert it to 60p for distribution. One of the big lessons we learned in Beijing is, we had a mixed-format house and it was incredibly difficult manage. We decided very early on that we were going to have one house mezzanine format across the board for Paris.\n\nPlus, we have Dolby Atmos audio in every location where the Atmos microphone arrays are available, which is almost every sport. That means we’re pushing every vendor to support HDR, 10-bit color, and 10 channels of audio, which not everyone does. There was a lot of encouragement — you might call it friendly bullying — to ensure that vendors would be ready for these formats.\n\nOne of the biggest hits with audiences has been NBC’s Gold Zone whip-around coverage on Peacock. Tell us a bit about how that operation works.\n\nIt. has been one of the more interesting productions because it’s just a different tempo and pace than our other shows. It’s a bit ADHD, with everything always moving, moving, moving.\n\nThere’s so much live competition going on that there’s simply no way you could sit in front of one screen and drink it all in. With Gold Zone, we’re able to quick-cut to whatever action is most exciting or relevant at any given moment. Maybe we just heard something hot is happening at water polo or rugby; we just cut to that feed, and you’re right in the middle of the action. It’s a really high-energy show.\n\n[The Gold Zone team] is in PCR12, which is one of our new control rooms [along with PCR11] that we specifically designed to look and feel like a truck [environment]. It typically is used for a lot of our remote production on golf, so it’s perfect for that quick-cut style needed for Gold Zone. We want it to feel exactly like a truck to the production team, so it is more compact than some of our [existing] larger control rooms here in Stamford.\n\nThey are using Studio 3, which is the beautiful [new set used for] Premier League [coverage] and gives them plenty of space and technology to work with. It has been amazing to watch, and the feedback has been phenomenal so far.\n\nAside from PCR11 and 12, what are some other facilities that are new for NBC’s Paris 2024 production?\n\nOne of the things we’re most excited about is our new flex rooms. One lesson that we learned from COVID: we used some of the booths in the off-season. During COVID. when [the Tokyo Games] were postponed, we had already built the off-tube [remote commentary] booths so they were dormant for an entire year cycle. We found that booths were really useful for pop-up reasons, like an additional graphics operator or EVS operator. We realized that model was useful beyond COVID, so we purpose- built the flex rooms. Each room has a [multipurpose] workstation and has sliding glass walls so we can combine them into larger rooms when we need them.\n\nRight now, we’re using them for EVS and graphics operations, our “Friends and Family” [control room], and a few other things, but, after the Games conclude, we can continue to use these spaces to maintain that flexibility on other sports. If NASCAR needs more EVS or if Tour de France wants to do more AR graphics, we’re ready to handle that on the spot.\n\nSpeaking of the off-tube effort, it’s bigger than ever for Paris. How have you revamped the remote-commentary operation in Stamford?\n\nWe rebuilt the off-tube setup from the ground up. It’s all based on a Calrec Apollo ImPulse core, Calrec [Assist] touchscreens, and Dante IP [networking]. While the core functionality is similar, the guts and the technology backbone behind it isΩ very different.\n\nWe also have three different levels of off-tube booths this year: our super booths have telestration and on-air cameras for talent, the graphics-enhanced booths allow the producer to insert templated graphics, and then we have our standard booths dedicated purely to commentary as in the past.\n\nAny other new technologies you’re excited about for Paris 2024 that you see being used more in the future?\n\nWe’re experimenting a lot with AI, and one of the ways we’re doing that is with WSC Sports automated highlights in our Highlights Factory [operation]. It’s something we wanted to test out to see the results compared with our existing [operation] and [whether] we could help better train the AI engine. One of the biggest challenges is getting the AI engine to understand each specific sport, because there aren’t necessarily models for every sport in the Olympics. Having people who actually played field hockey and water polo in that room working with the system is going to provide a lot more insight in terms of what plays and moments are pertinent and important to each sport.\n\nIn the long run, we’re looking for a mix of AI-based and human-curation tools. There will always be a place for both. Based on our findings for Paris, I think, next time around, we’ll figure out the right blend of both."
