        "text": "Save as PDF\n\n本語版はこちら\n\nDashboard networks (also known as sites) provide a way to logically group and configure Cisco Meraki access points, security appliances, switches, and Systems Manager within an organization. Devices in the same network can be configured and monitored in the same way. Dashboard networks are also a useful way to separate physically distinct sites within an organization. This Knowledge Base article describes how to create and delete networks.\n\nNote: Creating and deleting networks requires full organization permissions.\n\nCreating a Network\n\nA network holds devices and information related to those devices. A network can contain any number of access points or switches, but only a single security appliance, VM concentrator, or instance of Systems Manager.\n\nAs an organization administrator, hover over the Organization tab, then select Create network.\n\nEnter a Name for the network. Make sure this clearly identifies the purpose of this network. Such as 'HQ - Appliance'.\n\nSelect the Network type.\n\nCombined hardware - Can contain a combination of different device types. Useful for locations with each type of device.\n\nNote: A combined network consists of multiple network types combined into one. If only one type of device is added to a combined network at the time of creation, the network will be of that device type. Please refer to our documentation for more information about combined networks.\n\nSecurity appliance - Contains a single security appliance or teleworker gateway (ex. MX series or Z1). Can also contain an HA pair of MX appliances.\n\nSwitch - Contains only switches (ex. MS series).\n\nWireless - Can only contain wireless Access points. Dashboard managed MR or CW access points CANNOT be added to the same Network and must be claimed to separate Networks.\n\nCamera - Contains only cameras (ex. MV series).\n\nEMM - Systems Manager enterprise mobility management network.\n\nCellular gateway - Contains only cellular gateway (ex. MG series)\n\nWireless LAN Controller - Can only contain Monitored Catalyst 9800 wireless controllers.\n\nSelect the Configuration .\n\nUse default - Creates the network with all default settings.\n\nClone from network - If another network of this Type is available, most network and configuration settings can be copied with the exception of local device configurations (ie. static IP assignments of the devices), and NetFlow configurations. If the source network type is different, it will override the selection above.\n\nBind to template - This network will have minimal local settings, with most configuration determined by the selected template. Learn more in the article on templates.\n\n(Optional) In the Devices section, check the box for any devices that should be added to the network. If no devices exist in the inventory, click Claim devices and enter the serial or order numbers to add them.\n\nNote: Unless the Type of \"Combined\" was selected, only devices matching the network Type selected above will be added.\n\nClick Create network.\n\nWe highly recommend having the total switch count in any dashboard network to be less than or equal to 400 switches. If switch count exceeds 400 switches, it is likely to slow down the loading of the network topology/ switch ports page or result in display of inconsistent output.\n\nDeleting a Network\n\nNetworks can be deleted when they are no longer needed. The devices from the network will remain in the organization's inventory and can later be added to new networks. Follow the steps below to delete a network.\n\nNote: If billing has been enabled on a network, the network cannot be deleted.\n\nAll devices must be removed from the network before the network can be deleted.\n\nNavigate to Organization > Overview.\n\nAlong the right side, click on the arrow button to view the full list of networks within the organization.\n\nClick the checkbox next to any networks that should be deleted.\n\nClick the Delete button along the top of the list.\n\nOn the following page, click the checkbox to confirm that these networks should be permanently deleted. Then click the Delete networks button.\n\nNote: Deleting networks is permanent and irreversible. It cannot be undone by organization administrators or Cisco Meraki support.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFor additional information, please refer to articles on organization inventory, adding & removing devices from networks, and licensing guidelines.\n\nFor information on creating, deleting, and managing configuration templates, refer to the article on Managing Identical Networks with Configuration Templates."
