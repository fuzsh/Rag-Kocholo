Rochester, the third largest city in New York State, is also where American filmmaking was born— thanks to George Eastman and his Eastman Kodak Company. That tradition continues today through the large local community of skilled crew and talent backed up by equipment rental houses, soundstages including Rochester Institute of Technology’s state-of-the-art MAGIC Spell Studios, industry vendors, and more. Boasting over 1,000 waterfalls, the 2nd largest wine producing region in the US, historic towns along the Erie Canal, Lake Ontario beaches and lighthouses, and urban centers including Rochester, Geneva and Batavia– the Finger Lakes has a wide range of looks and locations.

Counties: Nassau, Suffolk.

Adjacent to New York City, Nassau County is one of the busiest production hubs in the state outside the five boroughs. Across Long Island, the proximity of suburban towns, oceanside villages and locations is a draw, as are the many beaches and state parks that allow producers to appear to be far from the city without having to travel too far. Notable productions that have filmed on Long Island include: Apple TV+’s Dickinson and On The Rocks, HBO’s Bad Education, The Plot Against America and The Undoing, Amazon’s Hunters and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and 20th Century Studios’ The Greatest Showman.

With homes dating back to the 1790s, framed by verdant, rolling foothills of the northern Catskill Mountains, the six counties of the Mohawk Valley are at the geographic center of upstate New York. Along the Mohawk River, the cities of Utica, Rome and Little Falls provide period downtowns, pristine suburbs and aging industrial sites, while just a few miles further south are forests, farmland and historic villages like Cooperstown, home of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Film friendly communities, great locations and experienced local crew are drawing independent films like the Tribeca Film Festival award-winning The Half of It and the Sundance Film Festival award-winning We The Animals.

New York City is the single most filmed location in the world, and it’s easy to understand why. From the glass and steel canyons of Manhattan to bustling diverse neighborhoods, the Big Apple has a location for everyone. And as one of the largest and most highly developed production centers in the world, with an all-star cast of A-list residents, a huge and diverse talent pool, state-of-the-art stages and post-production facilities, industry vendors, and the best crews in the world, New York is camera-ready and open for business. There are also many State-run and film-friendly properties including its vast subway system, Grand Central Terminal, Hudson River Park, Roosevelt Island, airports, bridges and tunnels. The five boroughs also have the largest amount of qualified production facilities in the state. That’s why projects like NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Law & Order: SVU, CBS’s FBI, FBI: Most Wanted and Bull, Showtime’s Billions and City On A Hill, Amazon’s award-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Hulu’s Ramy, and FX’s Pose, to name a few, choose New York. From the Joker stairs in the Bronx to The Godfather’s Lower East Side, You’ve Got Mail atop the Empire State Building or the Brooklyn streets in Do The Right Thing, New York City is an unforgettable onscreen character unlike any other.
