        "text": "Could it be that British artist Mary Vickers inspired the eponymous appetizer?\n\nDishes are often named after famous people. I only have to mention the Earl of Sandwich to prove my point. And what about Fettuccine Alfredo, named for restaurateur Alfredo di Lelio, Caesar Salad, named for restaurateur Caesar Cardini, Peach Melba, named after opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, Oysters Rockefeller, named after billionaire John D. Rockefeller, Pavlova Parfait, named after dancer Anna Pavlova, Beef Stroganoff, named after Count Stroganov, or Tarte Tatin, invented by the hotelier Stéphanie Tatin. All can be found in my latest cookbook or on past blogs, as the links will attest.\n\nIs London’s Mary Vickers the namesake for this little triangle of toast with a savoury topping? Someone must have created and named the delicious appetizer made from thin slices of white bread, topped with a mouth-watering mixture of bacon, almonds, cheddar cheese and mayo and baked until golden. But a search on the internet provides no clues. The recipe is easily found. So are obits for about a dozen ladies of that name, but none claim the invention.\n\nMary Vickers, the painter, was born outside London, England, in 1940 and later studied at Saint Martin’s School of Art, now part of the University of the Arts London. Her art-deco style oil paintings and lithographs of semi-naked, slender, female forms are still apparently popular among collectors. As she has no official website or Wikipedia entry, it is hard to know whether she is still with us or still creating works of beauty. However, that lack is a good excuse for me to show readers a couple of her pieces.\n\nI first came across this recipe in a cookbook my late father-in-law, David Scott-Atkinson, was promoting as part of a charity fundraiser back in the 70s. The appetizer quickly became a family favourite. From what I can see on the internet, everyone who posts the recipe says the same thing. I made it for guests at Canadian Thanksgiving recently and the tasty treats were enthusiastically consumed, so on the 50th anniversary of my original discovery of the recipe, here it is again.\n\nThe complete compendium of all Nigel’s recipes from the past decade, Simplifood: Amazing food, simply prepared is now available as an eBook well priced at 9.99 in any currency.
