        "text": "Marcus Vickers, Jr; was born in Eupora, MS and and raised in Mobile, AL. He lost his father at the young age of 14, but he and his sister, Marcy, and brother, James Michael, were raised by his amazing and strong mother, Arleen Vickers. He moved to Nashville, \"Music City\", in 1979 for the \"dream”, 2 years after his best friend, Jamey moved there. He was inspired by and remained an avid “Stones” fan for the duration of his life. Prior to moving to Nashville he had a son, Michael Keith Vickers, who he lost tragically. He met his wife, Terrilyn, a Nashville native, in 1981 and they quickly fell in love and married in 1982. He and Terrilyn had their \"Darlin' Daughters\" as he called them a few years later. His \"Cari Merry Muffin\" was born in 1987 and his \"Katie Mae\" was born in 1990, and he became “Da”. He pursued music and songwriting for many years, practiced Kung Fu becoming a 9th degree blackbelt, and considered himself a \"life long learner.\" He loved to read and said “once you know how to read you’ll never be alone.” He taught himself several languages and became very involved in international politics and had strong beliefs that ALL people should be guaranteed basic necessities and be treated fairly despite their socioeconomic status, race, or religion.\n\nHe was complex and brilliant, cultured and kind, unapologetically himself and confident. He admired and celebrated others' differences. He viewed other's \"scars\" as a unique way of telling their story. He always rooted for the \"underdog\" and was truly a friend to all. In the last 6 years of his full life, he became “GrandDa” to his four grandchildren whom he loved dearly. He always said “I knew I would love being a grandfather, but I never realized how much.” Though he faced many adversities throughout the years, he always remained positive and his “light” was bright to all who knew him.\n\nMarcus is survived by, His wife, Terrilyn Franck Vickers, of 30+ years; his \"darlin' daughters\" Carisue (Matthew) Turek and Katelyn (Kaleb) Pitts; Grandchildren: Kynlee Jean Pitts, Leon Keith Turek, Ivey Mae Turek, and Kade Davis Pitts; Mother: Edith Arleen Vickers; Brother: James Michael Vickers; and many nieces and nephews; Best Friend of 55 years: Jamey (Tamara) Whiting\n\nCountless friends and family \"Comrades\" across the globe\n\nHe is preceded in death by father; Marcus Gene Vickers Sr.; Stepfather: Urban Davis Franklin; Son: Michael Keith Vickers; Sister: Marcia Lynn Sease; Sister-in-law: Lorilee Franck Ryan; Mother-in-Law: Norma Sue Franck"
