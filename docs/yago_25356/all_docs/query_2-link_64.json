        "text": "The Young and the Restless\n\n— FINALLY!!! There’s something for the Newman children to do besides cower and tremble at the feet of the great roaring lion, Victor Newman himself! Victoria’s takeover of Newman? Brilliant! Forcing Adam out of the top position AND off the Newman ranch? PRICELESS! Who knew Victoria had it in her? Doesn’t she know that the great man, himself, will tear her limb from limb for daring to disobey daddy dearest? Sure, there’s always the possiblity, but why should she care? Adam is a bigger problem for the Newman legacy, right now, than Victor will be.\n\nThis battle between the mini-mustaches is a must see! The devil is in the details, so I love the subtle justification for Victoria’s leadership by having her force Adam to prove just how little he knows about the people Newman does business with and how little he knows about the company. Kudos to the writers for not only having Victoria take over, but for making her a competent and tough-as-nails CEO to boot. Adam has a lot to learn from his big sister – not that it will matter to him. Surely he’s plotting his return to power. Let’s hope this battle continues. What would the mustache, himself, do if he was around? Revel in his children’s battles. Being the child of the great man is a bloodsport, after all.\n\n— Both of Michael’s parents are criminals? He and Kevin never had a shot. It’s hard to remember the old Michael (and to some degree the old Kevin). The writers are probably not going to touch the history of these two brothers but they have done a good job of implicitly explaining how the Baldwin brothers becaming the men they once were.\n\n— Ana, Ana, Ana… I’m sick to death of hearing that kid sing but I love the Hamilton-Winters clan as it’s pulling together (I can pretend that Lily isn’t there whenever she’s on). The family is fun, and sweet, and warm. The interaction between Devon and Ana was so tender that it made me miss all the great family moments we’re no longer treated to in daytime (GL’s Bauer Barbeque, GH’s Nurses Ball and the families that come together). The Hamilton-Winters family is wonderful addition to daytime. I haven’t loved the Winters family this much since Drucilla was around. I hope to see more of them.\n\nThe Bold and The Beautiful\n\nIs there NO END to the humiliation Nick and Katie are willing to put Bridget through? Why couldn’t they have chosen a different hospital? Why would they force Bridget to face her colleagues (and force them to face her) with the ugliness of their betrayal? This is beginning to feel intentional on Nick’s part. First he and Taylor use the same hospital Bridget works at for the in vitro, and now this? Daytime writers are always claiming they’ll offer something not done before in the history of daytime. I’m voting for daytime’s first castration storyline … with Nick Marone as the donor. Nick ‘the Bobbit’ Marone? It does have a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?\n\nHave all other hospitals in L.A. and nearby communities suddenly closed? What’s the excuse for Nick’s behavior, THIS TIME? Thank goodness the Bakers are on! They’re a welcome distraction from the Nick and Katie horror. Besides:\n\nIs anyone else up for a Charlie/Bridget/Owen triangle?\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nClint making deals with Jared? Planning to semi-welcome him into the family?\n\nClint, using poor Langston as ‘collateral damage’ in his war on Dorian?\n\nGigi immediately excusing Rex for sleeping with another woman just because she looked so much like her?\n\nJohn in an administrative position?\n\nAntonio being willing to risk making his child an orphan just to chase ‘true love’ (ok, this one doesn’t bother me as much as it should – love Antonio and Talia)\n\nWho ARE these people? Clint, especially, is unrecognizable.\n\nHOORAY to the OLTL writers for bringing the following to a close:\n\nThe time travel storyline.\n\nMarty sitting in that bed 24 hours a day – let John find her, already!\n\nRex and Gigi’s separation. It’s time for them to move forward. Now end the paternity lie.\n\nThe Cole-Starr storyline (yeah, I know, it’s a pipe dream but I’m adding the end of this storyline to my wish list. From the show’s current ratings, so are many of you!)\n\nWhat I’m waiting for:\n\nFor everyone to SHUT UP telling Cole how evil and self-centered he is for mourning the loss of his child. What’s the insanity taking place in Llanview that makes a responsible young man seem like a jerk for loving Starr’s ‘baby bump’?\n\nBlair’s reaction to finding out that Marty is alive – and that John’s been dreaming about Marty, instead of her.\n\nNatalie’s reaction to finding out that Tess has returned – will she and Jared feel an ounce of guilt?\n\nViki taking on Tess.\n\nTodd stomping out Marcie’s insane obsession with Starr’s child.\n\nMarcie’s reaction to learning that she’s lost Michael, who’s moved on, and Starr’s child (on the wish list).\n\nFinally, Clint – Dorian showdown… Oh YEAH!\n\nI was torn between the above title and this one: “The Storyline We’re Still Waiting For” (about Nick and Jackie Marone, that is).\n\nWell played, BnB writers, well played! I can’t imagine that there’s one Bridge Forrester fan out there who isn’t fuming right now, wondering if it’s wrong to want to a ficitional character to be castrated! Nick Marone 0s certainly a deserving target, if it’s not. The evidence, you ask? If you’re not a BnB viewer, the man is talking about a one night stand he had with his wife’s aunt – one he’s been lying about since it happened:\n\nHow does the jerk wad follow that up? With THIS (Thanks, TVMegasite, for the transcript):\n\nKatie: I don’t care if it’s wrong. I can’t regret the fact that I’m having your baby.\n\nNick: Well, if it’s wrong, then I’m guilty, too.\n\nKatie: You really mean that?\n\nNick: (Sighs) I’d be lying if I didn’t say this confused me at first. (Clears throat) you know, I–\n\nNick: It should have felt wrong to me, and it didn’T. And I should have feared all the complications that we now face, and I didn’T. I was wondering why. (Laughs) why? You know, when you were on that island sick, and I was there with you… (sighs) my prayer was that before you died, you’d know how I felt.\n\nCan someone tell me how Katie, pimping a Bridget-Nick reunion to Nick, drinking scotch and putting a puzzle together, turned into a deep and abiding love between these two? They’ve gone from a sibling-like relationship to soul mates in about two hours worth of scenes. That’s moving incredibly fast, even for the BnB. Hold on to your last meal, readers, you may lose it if you continue read on:\n\nNick: So now we’re there. And I hope that you can feel that I love you.\n\nKatie: (Sniffles)\n\nKatie: (Sighs)\n\nNick: I’m sorry if I’ve upset you.\n\nKatie: You haven’T. You haven’T. I-I think you just said that you love me, and I– I love you, too. You must know that. That’s why this baby is so precious, is so important to me, because–because it’s yours. It’s ours. It’s the one thing I have that we share, and– only we can’T.\n\nNick: But we have to. This baby’s not going away. You know that.\n\nKatie: (Sighs) but what about everything else–\n\nNick: No, no, no, no. No “buts” about it. Listen to me. This child was conceived in the most magical moment. And this baby is gonna be amazing. This child is gonna be so special and bring so much joy into the world, because of love, because it was conceived in the deepest, most honest form of love, and that’s what he’ll know.\n\nKatie: I hear what you’re saying, and I know it’s true, and to hear those words coming out of your mouth– they bring me so much joy. I never in my wildest dreams ever thought that I would hear you say those things to me. I feel like I’m dreaming. But I know I’m not. I know I’m gonna have to wake up. This is just all so confusing. I-I don’t know what I’m allowed to feel. I don’t know if I’m allowed to be happy or excited. Help me, nick. Help me. Because a part of me hates myself for this.\n\nAnd then there’s this:\n\nKatie: You’ve pledged your life to bridget.\n\nNick: I have.\n\nKatie: And she deserves all of you.\n\nNick: She deserves to have the best of me, and if I can’t give her that–\n\nKatie: You’re happy with her. I know. I’ve seen you together.\n\nNick: We are.\n\nKatie: (Sighs) this is just so complicated.\n\nThe reason it would be hard for Bridget to have the ‘best’ of Nick is that there is no ‘BEST” of Nick. There’s bad… worse… and what a freakin’ waste of human DNA (even fictional DNA)\n\nThe writers are still skimming the surface with this guy. All of his emotions are shallow. He wants to be Ridge Forrester and possess all Ridge has (including his family’s company, the woman he loves, his children). He’s just met Katie, and suddenly he’s deeply in love with her, to the point of denying Bridget – a woman he’s known and ‘loved’ for years. The mother of his first child. He mourned his dead child (Nicole) – in his words, but never mentioned her while in bed with the dead child’s grandmother shortly after Nicole was buried. He loved Taylor more than he’d loved before, or so he led her to believe, and was back to chasing Brooke and leading a double life when it was revealed that hers was the donor of the egg used to conceive his child with Taylor.\n\nEasy to see how the man made it to the top of the Manwhore list. When does it END!?!?!?\n\nIf the BnB ever returns to what made daytime great there has to be some focus on the way the Marone family uses sex as a way of life. Jackie explained that ‘pride’ made her turn to prostitution to raise her child, instead of working or going on welfare. If Jackie was a woman with no skills and without an education, that might have made sense. There has to be more to it. I’m not sure if the devil in high heels is Jackie, whose DNA flows through the pants-dropper’s veins, or if it’s about Nick spewing of the insta-love-and-destiny bullcrap as a way of excusing his actions. SHE! did it. SHE! made him fall in love – that’s why he continues to betray the women who’ve loved him and given him their full hearts.\n\nLOSER!\n\nWhatever it is this mother-son have in common, it’s hurtful and painful to the people around them. They’ve spent more time justifying their sexually inappropriate behaviors (too numerous to name for non BnB viewers) than trying to understand them. The superficiality is killing both characters, Nick more quickly than Jackie, obviously.\n\nSooner or later, writers will have to explain to fans what the point is of keeping Nick around. Nick will surely drop trou for the next Logan-Forrester woman he spends five minutes alone with – it’s his nature. What else is there for him to do? The character has never fit in on canvas and every time the show was redirected (characters’ histories changed, couples’ histories changed, the show’s focus changed) to shoehorn him in, it resulted in a disaster in the ratings.\n\nI’d only thought I lost my patience with this character, before. I KNOW I have now. He’s on an endless loop of one night stands, and impregnating the show’s cast. There’s nothing left to see here, writers. Nothing left to see. <sigh>\n\nThanks for NUTHIN’, Guiding Light writers!\n\nDaytime writers kill off another baby. Lovely. Yes, fetal death is a part of real life AND reel life, but daytime makes a practice of killing off babies fans have grown attached to and want to see survive. It’s almost too predictable. If you impregnate your daughter-in-law who already has children with your son (Beth and Alan), if you impregnate your mother-in-law (BnB’s Brooke and Deacon), if you become pregnate from a one night stand with a psychologically or morally unstable person while married (GH’s Jason and Elizabeth) that kid is definitely going to live! Two people in love have the same chance as a snowball in hell. It’s not to say that it won’t happen, but don’t count on it. Daytime seems to have killed off far more child that it’s let live, and Max/Clayton is just the latest casualty in daytime writers war on long term planning and moving their shows into the future.\n\nWhere does this leave the writers, now that they’ve killed off Ava and Remy’s child? What drama is there now that they’ve disposed of the ‘inconvenient’ little one? What about the bad blood between Little Max/Clayton’s two dads? What’s left for them to fight about now that Max is gone? Everything they fight about now will seem small and petty and more about their egos than anything to do with the dead child -and while Remy and Bill are more than capable of pettiness, I’m not up for watching it happen when the writers prolong this storyline over ‘nothing’.\n\nBill Lewis is not a classic ‘villain’, but he’s not a good guy, either. Bill’s anti-hero status would have made the storyline even MORE interesting. It’s too easy to root for the good guy over a villain, but how about fans being torn between good guy (Remy) and an anti-hero (Bill)?\n\nWould Remy truly have more claim just because he’s the biological father? SHOULD he have more claim? It’s just possible that Remy loves the child because of Ava and becuase he thinks he should ‘win’ Max/Clayton as a way of forcing a family with Ava. Would that make him a good guy, still?\n\nBoth men could have come to some realization about who they were and what Max meant to each of them.\n\nWould either win or would a third party surprise them both?\n\nWould one sacrifice his rights to make sure Max wasn’t tugged and pulled in a court case?\n\nWhat happens if they realize that Ava loves them both and wants neither of them including the baby?\n\nWould the losing father ‘gaslight’ the father who did win custody, to try to get ‘his’ son back?\n\nWould Bill have continued his marriage of convenience to Ava, slowly finding a way to ‘pay her back’ by causing her to lose custody of Max and maybe her freedom? (locked in a mental ward? set up for a prison sentence?)\n\nDinah testifying against her brother in a custody case could have set off a corporate battle between them that weakened both, allowing Alan to swoop take over again. Alan regains his fortune and reverts back to type, going after the Lewises, because of Bill.\n\nAlan and Beth (maybe with a return from Phillip) take on Josh, Billy, Bill, and Vanessa.\n\nAll from one little custody case, featuring one little baby who was connected to more than half of the families in Springfield.\n\nEven if Max/Clayton stayed off screen until the next big storyline he’s needed, it’s not like it hasn’t happened to tons of other Springfield children, including Bill Lewis, who is now a central character on the show. Good going there!\n\nThanks for NUTHIN’ Katie and Nick\n\nYou know, when you get your wife’s aunt pregnant, it’s pretty much common practice to be more upset about betraying your wife than your aunt (by marriage)/mistress is – I’m just sayin’. At least, that’s what I’ve heard. It would seem reasonable to be upset. If your name is Nick Marone, not so much. You tend to believe that your aunt/mistress’ child is a gift from above and the product of a truly beautiful night of love and passion, made as she lay dying from a heart transplant rejection. I know, I know, it happens in even the best of families.\n\nIf there was to be any hope for Nick, he and Katie needed to trade places in their dialogue after the pregnancy reveal. Katie is sickened that she’s betrayed Bridget. She wishes she could forget that evening, she sees everything that happened in such a negative light. Nick’s response? He’s confused. Why is she so upset? In fact:\n\nNick: I see. So are you saying that you wish that it never would have happened?\n\nKatie: Yes.\n\nNick: Well, I guess I feel differently about that day.\n\nW.T. F. Does this guy get warm fuzzies when he thinks about what happened? I’m convinced that Nick is either a sociopath – with a mind warped by peeping in on his mother’s sessions with her Johns, or he’s redefined the word ‘insensitive’, or he’s just damned crazy. He goes on to try to legitimize the betrayal of the woman who loves him heart and soul by saying:\n\nNick: Let me remind you of a few things. First off, bridget and i were not engaged.\n\nTake THAT, Bridget! Sure. She was living with him, sleeping with him, helping him raise HIS son with HER mother. How dare she expect fidelity from him! How dare she expect him to tell her he’d slept with her aunt before they married! That Bridget… she’s so difficult and so demanded. She wants, like, the truth – she’s just that twisted.\n\nThe only thing that doesn’t ring true is that it’s Katie spewing this dialogue and not Nick. Bridget forgave him for running out on her the day after she buried their child. She forgave him for marrying her mother. She forgave him for using her while he was still married to her mother. She forgave him for stealing her father’s company. There’s a theme running here. Bridget really should figure out that there’s no point in going back for more with that man. He’ll give it to you when you do. He’ll give it to your mother, your aunt, your sister, your sister-in-law, strangers on the street… yeah.. not good.\n\nAs much as I hate the Nick/Katie pairing, Heather Tom put her Emmy face and completely rocked her scenes. I didn’t think I could stand to watch the show, knowing what was coming, but Heather Tom’s performance made it all worth it. If ever I wanted to be sympathetic to Katie, THIS was the day. In the end, however, I just couldn’t feel it for her. Anything that resembled human emotion left the moment she stopped speaking and Nick spent more of his time worrying about her and the ‘love’ they shared that created yet another child, with yet another of his wife’s famliy members. That’s when Katie should have realized what kind of man Nick really is. You can never count on the writers to let any woman on this show call Nick out for anything he does and while that’s true of all males on the BnB, Nick Marone tends to put women through a special kind of hell.\n\nThey smile, accept it, and beg him for more. At some point, the guy HAS to be held accountable.\n\nThanks to TVMegasite and Restless-Passions for the transcripts.\n\nBold and Beautiful – Katie Logan is now pregnant by Nick Marone, who is married to her niece Bridget – mother of his first child (Nicole, deceased). Yes, the same Nick who has a child, for now, with Bridget’s mother/Katie’s sister, Brooke – and had sex with Brooke she was suicidal over the witnessed “death” of her lifelong love, Ridge Forrester.\n\nNick had sex with Katie while she was a dying heart transplant patient. Katie, who encouraged Bridget to get back together with Nick, then decided she too was in love with him. Confused yet? OR is that look on your face one of utter revulsion? This storyline would have worked in this universe, IF it weren’t for the fact that it’s a complete rewrite of the Logan family history.\n\nThose of us who’ve been around daytime for far too long remember the intense loyalty the Logan women once had for one another. Remember Donna, before the writers decided that her best assets were easily displayed in tacky lingerie? Donna was a woman who wore her heart on her sleeve. She gave up a young man she deeply cared for, Rocco, just because she thought her younger sister, Katie, had a CRUSH on the guy. The Logan women are now exchanging bedsheets, and betraying one another over worthless men (namely the SAME worthless man – Nick Marone). It would be lovely if Beth Logan regained her senses and whipped the women in her family back into shape… the problem is that she finds this all very sweet and heartbreaking. Oy.\n\nOn the ligheter side? Marcus and Steffy just keep getting better! An old-fashioned courtship instead of a ‘nice to meet you, let’s get naked’ insta-love story for the ages.\n\nGuiding Light – What a motherload of irony! Bill, Jr. tells Dinah that she knows NOTHING about love because she’s never loved anyone and never will. He tops that verbal slap with the soul killing comment that every relationship she’s ever had has failed (you know, unlike his string of failed relationships which have culminated in a fight for the custody of a child that isn’t his). Dinah’s righteous anger would have worked in this uinverse, IF it weren’t for the fact that we watched as she deceived Mallet and ended a great relationship with him to worm her way into the treatment clinic Bill, Sr. was recuperating at in order to help her brother work out his scheme to become a bigger, better sleaze bag and power broker.\n\nYeah, not exactly feeling sympathy for Dinah, but I did come close when Bill decided to trash his sister’s sacrifice.. What I am hoping is that Bill’s attack causes Dinah to rethink her willingness to act as a handmaiden to her ambitious snot of a little brother. Maybe it’s time for Dinah to benefit from all of the hard work she’s put into making him king of the hill. It’s time to dethrone the king. Long live the QUEEN!\n\nI’m also adding Olivia back to the top of my ‘Dames with STONES’ list! It’s the list for dames with broad shoulders and bad attitudes. The ‘Barbara Stanwyck’ list, if you will. If Stanwyck’s name is unfamiliar to you, it’s only because I’m old and you’re not.\n\nDid you sit a little closer to the screen when she told Bill, Jr that she would NOT let him hurt her daughter ever again? First, you probably wanted to make sure you heard her right – STONES! Bill hurt AVA? Love that! Second, you probably sat closer because you knew you’d give Olivia a hug when she said it, if you could. WOW! Despite the fact that she knew her daughter used artificial insemination (or thought the pregnancy was the result of insemination) to trap the guy into marriage, and that she pushed the marriage for all it was worth, Olivia’s attitude works for me! It works in this universe and any other universe the writers could conceive of! When she talks, her former lover/son-in-law had better listen. Rarely does Olivia issue an empty threat.\n\nDays of Our Lives – When Bo told Phillip that he was disappointed in him because Phillip was lying when he said that he didn’t lie to family, two things struck me. The scene would have worked in this universe, IF it weren’t for the fact that I had to work so hard to figure out what Bo was talking about. Yeah! Yeah! You got it right? They’re brothers. It’s been so long since the writers even dealt with that issue that I’d forgotten all about their familial connection. Second? Phillip lies so much, how could someone as smart as Bo have believed him? Sheesh!\n\nWhat DOES work in THIS soap universe is the pairing between DOOL’s EJ and Nicole. What great birds of a feather they are! Can you imagine the gates of hell these two will open when they finally work it all out and get together? I’m all for a couple making each partner in the pairing a better person. In daytime, I’m also for a couple kicking ass and taking name, and two characters without conscience (or severely weakened consciences) could really spice things up on DAYS.\n\nOne Life To Live – Last, and least… I thought it was just the lack of realistic context for the Cole and Starr teen pregnancy storyline that was bad. It’s so much more than that. This storyline might have had a chance of working in this universe, IF the writing for it and the acting weren’t so BAD! I don’t think either actor was prepared to carry off this storyline. It feels as if they’re reading the script aloud, and what a script it is. Starr to Cole: ‘But we’ll get past this, we’re Starr and Cole’ (not an exact quote)… WTF? Is that like ‘Sonny and Cher’, ‘Donny and Marie’, ‘Peanut Butter and Jelly’ W.T.F? Are the writers trying to turn this teen-pregnancy -storyline-gone-dull into an epic love story between 16 year olds? The surest way to get the elusive 18-24 year olds to tune out is to keep this plot alive. I’ve been tempted to build an altar in Ron Carlivati’s honor, he’s that good, but this storyline (and yes, I’ve said it before) is a HUGE miss.\n\nEven watching David Vickers talk with David Vickers (the dog) about burning down Carlotta’s diner wasn’t enough to erase the ache of having witnessed the painfully dull scenes between ‘Starr and Cole’. Speaking of Vickers and Vickers, just knowing that Bo believes that David HAS to be born leads me to believe that he is going to come out of his current ordeal finding himself closer to David, for as long as David will be around, this time. What will it mean for Clint, if that happens? I can’t wait for Bo to come back to find out.\n\nI love OLTL’s new time travel storyline – and who knew it was even possible to say that? I love it for it’s potential: What Bo and Rex find out about Buchanan history, what they find out about themselves, their ability to impact the future, Rex’s realization of his feelings about Gigi, Shane, and Brody… so much more.\n\nI love the Mendora storyline. It’s old fashioned, fantastic storytelling. I truly liked Talia and Antonio before. I love them now. BRAVO/A to the writers for a throwback storyline that feels fresh and new."
