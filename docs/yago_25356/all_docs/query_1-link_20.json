        "text": "Speculation\n\nThe stone reportedly marking the burial place of J. S. Vickers is one of only two barrel type monuments still extant in Old Bayview Cemetery. It is unclear if this is purely coincidental or whether it indicates some connection (possibility of same time period for fabrication of these markers, same monument builder, the deceased are relatives in some way). There is a John Vickers who made an oath of office as deputy city marshall in May of 1886. He is also mentioned in the city council minutes at the time of his application for this job (see C.C. Caller of 9 May 1886, page 4 col. 5). This John Vickers also was a plaintiff in a civil case against C. M. Rogers (the second husband of Martha Rabb and whose first wife is the Harriet Rogers buried in Old Bayview). The case was dismissed for want of prosecution (C.C. Caller, 1 August 1886, page 5 col. 2). It is possible that this person or a relative of this person is the J. S. Vickers buried in this tomb. This John Vickers and a \"David Vickers\" are listed in the 1885 tax rolls of Corpus Christi, but there is no indication of their relationship (brothers or cousins). The records of the First Methodist Church also note the baptisms of a \"Grace Mary Vickers\" and an \"Earnest Aesal Vickers\" on 12 October 1885 as well as the baptism of a \"Henry Pratt Vickers\" on 23 October 1887. Possibly these are children of David or John who are both listed as early members of the church. David and A. (presumably his wife) Vickers are listed as registered 11 June 1882, and John is listed with A. D. (presumably his wife) Vickers as registered 9 July 1882. Neither David nor John appears to be in Nueces County in 1880 or in the subsequent census of 1900. The David Vickers who is in Texas in 1880 (Travis County page 52C) and 1900 is a Canadian by birth (born March 1842 in Kirton, Huron, Ontario). He does have a brother John who was born in 29 November 1847 in the same location. This John Vickers was in California in 1880 (Butte County, CA) with wife Almira. David and John's parents (William Vickers and Mary Porter) ultimately settled in Michigan where they died in Pitsford, Hillsdale County, Michigan. Their son John Vickers married Almira D. Wilcox in Hilisdale County, Michigan on 16 November 1873. This seems to be the same couple who were early members of First Methodist Church in Corpus Christi. They are listed as John and A. D. Vickers who registered in the parish on 11 June 1882.\n\nIt should be noted that J. S. Vickers is buried in a plot next to Elizabeth Ada Welch (wife of Judge Stanley Welch and mother of Fred Lovell by her first husband, Dr. David Lovell who was killed while serving as county judge of present day Zapata County). Elizabeth also had relatives in Wisconsin and Michigan as attested to in the report of the death of her son Fred in 1918. At that time his uncle Ed Trumble (reportedly born in 1844 in Michigan) was living in Luling The announcement of Fred Lovell's death noted that this relative was making arrangements for the funeral and burial of Fred (who was buried in Houston according to his death certificate).\n\nResearch and transcription: Michael A.
