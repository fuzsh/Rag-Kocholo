        "text": "Tuc Watkins has been featured a lot on this site because I happen to think he is one of the most talented actors working in television today. I also feel like he’s not quite been given the opportunities that far lesser talents have been.\n\nSo it’s great to know that Tuc is enjoying a real career upswing right now. He’s currently appearing on One Life to Live as David Vickers which he has done on-and-off since the mid-90s. He’s been upgraded to a regular on ABC’s Desperate Housewives this fall and just finished appearing in an off-Broadway play.\n\nA new interview with Soap Opera Digest caught my eye and I thought I’d share parts of it with all my fellow Tuc fans.\n\nWhy Tuc loves Modern Family: “It’s got that element that most comedies lack, which is heart, and at the end of each of those episodes, it’s kinda like watching The Waltons, like, ‘Aw, that’s so nice.’ And I’m really glad to see Ed O’Neill back on TV.”\n\nOn his two years co-starring on Showtime’s Beggars and Choosers: “I remember it was really well received critically and I thought, ‘This is my big break. It’s all gonna be easy from here on out,’ and then when that show was over, I didn’t work very much for a couple of years. I thought, ‘Wait, it was supposed to get easier.”\n\nWhy he began buying, remodeling and selling houses in LA: “I can’t control whether I work or not, but I can control how I keep myself occupied. I will always have something else that I’m doing so that if acting isn’t working out, then I have something else.”\n\nOn David Vickers’ relationship with Dorian Lord (played by Robin Strasser): “David and Dorian have known each other for 16 years. I’m sure there are other couples in daytime that have been together for that long, but not consistently together. And part of the reason that they’re still hot for one another is that they’ve never quite gotten each other completely. It’s like the one that got away is the one you think about. And David and Dorian keep getting away from each other.”\n\nThis summer things heat up for David and Dorian, he promises: “Some poetically appropriate things happen . There’s a lot of stuff around swimming pools and in and out of the bedroom. It’s a lot of fun. I love coming back in the summer because the storylines tend to be more fun.”\n\nTuc’s fans not only love David’s comedic side, but we also love the fact that he is such an exhibitionist! This gives the fit and buff actor plenty of opportunity to play some scenes wearing next to nothing.\n\n“David still likes to wear his Speedo,” Tuc says. “David Vickers will wear his Speedo when he’s 85 with a walker. I was thinking about this the other day: David is so vain and it’s all about his appearance that as he’s aging – as I’m aging – it will actually be a lot of fun to watch.”"
