On Tuesday last, Dr. Alan Vlckers, known throughout Australia as the \"flying doctor,\" and pioneer of the Australian Inland Mission's aerial medical service, was married to Miss Lillas Whitman (daughter of Mr. J. L, Whitman, Cloncurry), a popular member of the Cloncurry Younger Set. AFTER their marriage Dr. and Mrs. Vickers left for Sydney, where they will join the Taiping for China, Dr. VIckers having been appointed relieving doctor for the trip. On his return Dr. Vickers expects to open a new branch of the aerial medical service for the Australlan Inland: Mission at Broome.

Nov 1936,\n\nBIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT. FLYING DOCTOR'S SON. The wife of Dr. Alan Vickers, the Flying Doctor, has presented him with a son, their first child. Hundreds of telegrams of congratulation have been sent to Dr. and Mrs. Vickers at Port Hedland (Western Australia). The Maitland Daily Mercury (NSW : 1894 - 1939) Wed 4 Nov 1936, Page 3: http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/125356444\n\nDr Alan Vickers was the very first Flying Doctor in Charleville. His son, Robert, after completing primary school in Charleville left to go to boarding school and University before working as a surgeon in Toowoomba for 34 years. Ash Moore caught up with Dr Robert Vickers, who still considers himself a Charleville boy, at the opening of the new RFDS base in Charleville on the 31st of October [?2015?]. They spoke about his Dad and what it was like growing up in Charleville in the early days of the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

Orthopaedic Surgeon and Microsurgery pioneer Prof David Vickers AM has received the ESR Hughes Award for Distinguished Contributions to Surgery\n\nOne of the College’s most prestigious awards – the ESR Hughes Award for Distinguished Contributions to Surgery – was presented to Orthopaedic Surgeon and Microsurgery pioneer Professor David Vickers AM at the Annual Scientific Congress (ASC) held in Brisbane. Professor Vickers, now retired, gained renown over the course of his career not only for his ground-breaking surgical procedures and anatomical discoveries but also for his design of novel surgical instruments developed to aid surgeons conducting hand and micro surgery. In particular, he became an international authority on the early surgical treatment of Madelung deformity and his discovery of a ligament in the wrist not previously observed was later named after him to become known as the Vickers ligament. His other novel techniques included the use of microsurgery and physeal (growth plate) surgery to correct traumatic partial growth plate fusion and to prevent progress of deformity in children with congenital abnormalities including Delta phalanx. He also described a method to separate syndactyly without skin graft. The author of 14 chapters or contributions in nine medical textbooks, and 14 papers in journals, Professor Vickers’ article on Madelung Deformity – titled Surgical Prophylaxis (physiolysis) – was chosen in 1995 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand as one of the most important 50 papers in congenital surgery in the previous 50 years. His ergonomic micro surgical instruments, commonly known as the Vickers Universal Microsurgery Set, won the British Design Council Award for Excellence of Design in 1982 and were sold in 30 countries. Since then, a new set of his instruments for Hand Surgery has been manufactured in Germany and sold worldwide. In 1994, Professor Vickers was a Guest Professor at the prestigious Mayo Clinic, Department of Hand Surgery. As a result of his presentations he was invited to write two chapters for the Mayo Clinic Textbook “The Wrist”. A former Chair of a number of national and international hand surgery societies and committees, Professor Vickers was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2006 for service to medicine in the area of paediatric microsurgery through the development of surgical procedures to treat congenital deformities, to the design of specialised operating instruments and services to professional organisations. The son of a doctor who became a pioneer of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, Professor Vickers said adaptation, persistence and lateral thinking had been pivotal aspects of his childhood which had naturally influenced his subsequent professional development. “My father Dr Allan Vickers was asked by John Flynn to help save the flying doctor service – the first in the world – because it was failing in those early days 85 years ago and he opened several bases in outback Australia and established working protocols,” Professor Vickers said. “He and his pilot would set off with no radio assistance, few maps and in unreliable aircraft and they basically followed the railway lines to get where they were going. “In the process he taught me that things can be done through planning and courage - no matter the challenge. “I grew up in Charleville during WWII at a time when we had very little access to consumer goods so if you couldn’t make it or fix it, you couldn’t have it and that had an indelible effect on me.” Professor Vickers spent the majority of his working life combining his private practice with equal time working in the public health system at the Royal Brisbane Hospital and the Royal Children’s Hospital in Brisbane. He said that while microsurgery was relatively new to Australia in the early 1970s, he found the challenge irresistible. “I was asked by my boss at the time to look into microsurgery and one of the first things I discovered was that we needed new instruments that would allow us to perform delicate, time-consuming work,” he said. “I designed those instruments in my own time and with my own funds and once that was done I began to investigate congenital musculoskeletal deformities that could be treated with microsurgical techniques. “At the time, conducting orthopaedic procedures on babies or even tackling growth plate surgery was avoided as too risky because children were still growing, but I thought if we designed the surgery correctly we could change the lives of our young patients. “Orthopaedic microsurgery was a very dynamic field to be involved in and I feel fortunate that I had the chance not only to teach myself but to teach others.” Throughout the course of his career, Professor Vickers presented 32 scientific papers at International Congresses and 51 presentations at Australian Conferences all of which described his new surgical techniques or his novel surgical instruments. The winner for Best Presentation at the Australian Hand Surgery Annual Congress three times, Professor Vickers was frequently invited overseas to lecture and teach and he conducted 18 microsurgery workshop demonstrations both here and abroad. He said that his greatest professional achievement was introducing an early surgical intervention to treat Madelung deformity, a treatment which had a great impact on the lives of affected children. “Until then, surgeons often waited until the child had stopped growing which made for much more complex surgery which could not really correct all the damage,” Professor Vickers said. “When I first started researching this as a surgeon, I discovered the ligament responsible for the deformity which had not been identified previously because Madelung had described the condition in the days before x-ray or MRI scans were available. “That was very exciting and it opened a whole new surgical treatment pathway for the condition. “I feel very privileged to have been working in such a dynamic field at such an early time and I feel enormously honoured to receive the ESR Hughes Award.” Inaugurated in 1998, the ESR Hughes Award was created in recognition of the outstanding contributions made to surgery by Sir Edward Hughes, a world renowned colorectal surgeon.

Dr. Alan Vickers, the flying doctor of the North-West of Western Australia, left Port Hedland on Sunday by the Koolinda for Fremantle. He is commencing three months' holiday and is accompanied by Mrs. Vickers and their infant son. He expects to leave Perth on Sunday by mail plane for Melbourne, and, being an ardent angler, will spend most of his holiday fishing. Dr. Vickers is being relieved by Dr. Lawson, of Melbourne. The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 - 1954) Wed 22 Dec 1937, Page 18: http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/41601035\n\n(1938). Dr. Vickers Visiting Albury. The fine service that is being given to dwellers in the great North- West, through the successful functioning of the Australian Aerial Medical Service, was outlined by Dr. Alan Vickers, son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Vickers, of Mate-street, Albury, who is on three months' leave from his many duties at Port Hedland, Western Australia. Dr.\n\nVickers is known as \"The Flying Doctor.\" From his office at Port Hedland, Dr. Vickers besides carrying- out the duties of resident magistrate, mining warden, quarantine officer, harbor master, chief protector of aborigines, and medical officer to three hospitals, finds time as the 'flying doctor' to keep dwellings in far removed localities in health. Dr. Vickers thinks the North-West has tremendous possibilities of contributing largely to Australia's wealth, because of its rich mineral deposits. Asked what were the mineral deposits in the North West, Dr. Vickers replied that only the surface of some of the richest lodes had been scratched. The only known deposit of tantalite in the world was to be found there. It was worth £1000 a ton — while gold was being won in large quantities. \"There are many signs of progress in this locality, which only a few decades ago was not trodden by man,\" said Dr. Vickers. Large holdings measured by the square mile were producing wool and meat, but growers were experiencing difficulty in finding economic markets.

For the past month, Mrs Allan Vickers, of Charleville, wife of the Flying Doctor, has been visiting her brother-in-law and sister, Mr and Mrs John Elliot, at Yeppoon. Mr Elliot is manager of the Bank of New South Wales there. The visit to Central Queenland's popular tourist resort afforded Mrs Vickers the opportunity of a reunion with her father, Mr Litton Whitman, formerly a chemist at Cloncurry, who is now living, in retirement at Yeppoon and with other relatives, Mr and Mrs Bert Bannon, Mr and Mrs Jack Whitman and family (Rockhampton) and Mr and Mrs Paul Whitman (Brisbane). Mrs Vickers, who is accompanied by her younger son, David, will leave for Brisbane today to enjoy a further holiday at Southport before travelIing home to Charleville. Her elder son, Robert, who is a student at Slade's School, Warwick, is attending a cadet camp.
