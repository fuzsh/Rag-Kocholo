        "text": "Robin Strasser provided fans with an update on her soap status!\n\nHigh Hopes…\n\nFans of One Life To LiveÂ the show on which Strasser became a daytime icon playing Dorian Lord, were undoubtedly disappointed and theirÂ hopes dashed when Strasser tweeted to debunk the rumors that she’d soon again be gracing the soap screens on Days early next year, according to our friends at Soap Opera News. She responded to a fan’s tweet, saying, “Sorry to let you down…no one has called with an offer…but you know how much I love #DOOL. Like any fan, I have my super faves amongst that SUPER cast…but re-read my tweets:) I haven’t been subtle LOL.”\n\nRelated: This OLTL fan fave is returning to another ABC soap as a character fans love to hate!\n\nFans had been hoping that Strasser would be joining her good friend, Louise Sorel, on the show, when Sorel resumes the role Viv Alamain. Strasser had inadvertently let the cat out of the bag via Twitter months ago on her friend rejoining the cast.Â However, let’s not count this very talented actress out yet when it comes to seeing her again in soap land!\n\nThat being said, it would have made perfect sense–and would still–for Strasser to come to Days! Â Head Writer Ron Carlivati’s epic–and so far wonderful!–revamp of that show is still underway. He also loves to work with people he’s written for before. Strasser sure fits that bill, and she shines in any daytime role she takes on.\n\nA Soap Vet, An Iconic Role, and a Wealth of Talent\n\nDon’t Miss: Get the latest on the efforts to bring AMC and OLTL back to our screens.\n\nStrasser, of course, began playing the often devilish Dorian in 1979 and her on-screen rivalry with fellow Llanview resident Viki (Erika Slezak) was the stuff of soap legend. Strasser is no stranger to soaps, going all the way back to The Secret Storm (Iris); Somerset (Rachel); Another World (Rachel); All My Children (Christina), and Passions (Hecuba). Strasser has also appeared on countless other shows, including China Beach, Knots Landing, and Coach, to name but a few.\n\nDaytime Emmy Winner\n\nMust-Read: See what OLTL icon Judith Light said is the key to her successful marriage.\n\nStrasser is no stranger to the world of accolades in recognition of her talent, either. She has won a Daytime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Dorian, and has been nominatedÂ in that category several times. We at Soap Cities would be delighted to see StrasserÂ in another juicy soap role, or, of course, back as Dorian should OLTL get revived.Â What do you think, dear readers?"
