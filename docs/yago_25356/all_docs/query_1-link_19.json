        "text": "VICKERS David Husband, father, grandfather, lawyer, mediator and arbitrator, jurist, former Deputy Attorney General, community nurturer and activist, gardener, passed away at Victoria Hospice on Saturday, November 14 at the age of 75. David devoted his life to social justice concerns and equality rights, and became a champion for the rights of persons with disabilities. In his spare time, he grew amazing tomatoes in his Thetis Island garden. As a litigator, David advocated for the rights of persons with mental disabilities in a number of high-profile cases establishing the rights of persons with mental disabilities to inclusion and self-determination. He was a strong believer in the strength of community and participated actively in the development of the Thetis Island Community Association and the establishment of the Thetis Island Community Fund to advance the education, health and well-being of residents of Thetis Island. Following his retirement from the Supreme Court earlier this year, David joined the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness and was a founding director of the ORCA Children's Advocacy Centre Society. It was his greatest disappointment that, as a result of illness, he could not continue to work towards the goals of those organizations to eliminate homelessness and to address holistically, in a child-friendly way, the social and justice implications for children and youth, and the connection between child abuse to homelessness and other tragic outcomes. Predeceased by his daughter Pamela, David leaves his wife of 53 years Pat, children Cheryl, Janice and Clifford, grandchildren Ariana Vickers-Hill, Kimberly Adams, Dylan Adams, Coryn Wild, and Valentina Brynelsen, sister Doris Wilcox and brother Allan. He will be missed dearly by his family and friends and by so many others whom he touched so profoundly during a life lived with integrity and a deep sense of humanity. The family expresses our sincere thanks to the community nurses and the hospice medical staff for their compassionate and professional care. There will be a celebration of David's life on Tuesday, December 8, 2009 at 4:00 pm at St. Ann's Academy Auditorium, 835 Humboldt Street, Victoria (entry off Blanshard), reception to follow. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness, 941 Pandora, Victoria, BC V8V 3P4 or the Thetis Island Community Fund, PO Box 12-14, Thetis Island, BC V0R 2Y0."
