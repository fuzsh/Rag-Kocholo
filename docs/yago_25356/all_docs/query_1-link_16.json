        "text": "Former general contractor David W. Vickers, found guilty in December of mortgage fraud, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the parking lot of a Jacksonville sporting goods store.\n\nThe Medical Examiner's Office ruled the March 17 death a suicide, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.\n\nVickers was free on bond while waiting sentencing in U.S. District Court for a mortgage fraud scheme involving Northside residential property. He was 48.\n\nAlan Ceballos, the attorney who represented Vickers, said Vickers had been \"upbeat and optimistic\" he would receive a fair sentence.\n\n\"His primary concern was not for himself but for his family,\" Ceballos said. Vickers was married with two sons.\n\nThe shooting occurred about 4 p.m. at the Green Acres Sporting Goods store at 8774 Normandy Blvd. Vickers was found motionless beside his truck in the parking lot, according to police reports. He had a gunshot wound to the chest area.\n\nVickers had been scheduled to be sentenced on June 7. When a federal jury found him guilty last December, prosecutors said he faced a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison for conspiracy to commit mail, wire and bank fraud. He also faced up to 20 years on each of 18 other counts.\n\nProsecutors said Vickers misled lenders so he could help borrowers qualify for the purchase of new and renovated homes.\n\nFrom December 2006 through September 2009, Vickers was a partner in a business that bought residential property on the Northside.\n\nVickers oversaw construction and renovations and then advertised that buyers could get mortgage loans even if they had credit scores as low as 550, according to prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors said Vickers gave financial assistance to buyers so they could make down payments, but he didn't disclose that information to lenders. Instead, lenders were told the buyers were using their own money or gifts from relatives for the down payments, prosecutors said.\n\nPrior to the mortgage fraud scheme, Vickers had been a general contractor.\n\nThe state Department of Business and Professional Regulation fielded dozens of complaints about Vickers, many contending he took money for home renovation projects but failed to complete the work.\n\nThe state stripped him of his general contractor's license in 2006.\n\ndavid.bauerlein@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4581"
