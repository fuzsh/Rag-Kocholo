        "text": "While Oliver and Kyle have been at the center of the gay storyline on One Life To Live, they were mostly supporting players on Thursday and Friday when the one and only Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser) stole the spotlight.\n\nDorian is desperate to win the mayoral race against her nemesis Vicky Lord Buchanan – desperate enough to wow to perform same-sex marriages in the city of Lanview (a la Gavin Newsom in SF). When people doubt her sincerity, she takes it a step further and announces that she is a lesbian!\n\nBefore we get to the big Dorian is suddenly a lesbian part, there’s Kyle’s activist boyfriend Nick who is in political cahoots with Amelia, Dorian’s lesbian campaign manager. She and Nick are overheard talking by Oliver who gets it in his head that Nick and Amelia are planning to assassinate Dorian!\n\nOliver tells Kyle who explodes because he thinks its a ruse to win him back: “You and I were a lifetime ago! I know you may think that you still have feelings for me but this is over. Making up ridiculous stuff about my boyfriend is not going to change that!”\n\nThis is silly. Oliver is a cop and apparently a good one. But if he really thought Dorian was in danger , he would have handled things differently than running to Kyle.\n\nFriday’s episode was a real tour-de-force for actor Tuc Watkins as David Vickers. He gives a television interview after Dorian’s big announcement to reporters eager to talk to Dorian Lord’s last ex-husband before she became a lesbian.\n\nIt’s just brilliant acting, straddling the line between drama and comedy and pulling it off beautifully.\n\n“Dorian and I had a tumultuous six-part miniseries type of relationship,” he says to “reporters.” “It had its ups and downs, intrigue, romance, a few good laughs thrown in there just for good measure.”\n\nHe’s then asked if he knew during the marriage that Dorian was really gay. David replied: “I would just like to say I knew something was wrong when Dorian let me go. I thought she was jealous of my female fans after I completed the television campaign for the good folks at Have a Seat Hemorrhoid Pads. Women threw themselves at me, naturally, and Dorian and I experienced some strain in our relationship. I now understand that it was something more than that. Dorian has found her true self with Amelia. Who was I to stop that? I did what any man would do: I stepped aside to let their love live.”\n\nDespite that hilarious interview, David’s most memorable line in these two episodes has gotta be this: “The gay banner is well hung.”"
