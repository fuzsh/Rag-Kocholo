Last year, there was a rumor that Linda Dano\n\nwas being courted by JFP (her friend) to come to OLTL from AW to be the\n\nnew Dorian. This rumor was dismissed as wild and unfounded, but frankly\n\nI'm not so sure. I have no idea what Dano's take on the issue is, but,\n\nfor one thing, her contract on AW (if AW is still around) is up next\n\nyear at almost the same time Robin Strasser's contract is up in Feb.\n\n2000. Exhibit 2--there have been rumors that Robin Christopher, Dano's\n\nAW daughter, was being considered as a recast for Cassie. JFP would LOVE\n\nthe matched set to have mother and daughter back together on OLTL.\n\nEven if all of the above is NOT true, RS's relationship with JFP is not\n\nthe best. It started last year. RS was backburnered all of the time. RS\n\nhad a meeting with ANgela Shapiro, JFP's boss, to discuss Dorian. This\n\ncould not sit well with JFP. At any rate, Robin was \"kindly offered\" the\n\nopportunity to be of the show for about 8 weeks to do a play, mainly\n\nbecause the idiotic writers couldn't find anything for her to do. In\n\nJan, she was supposed to start this \"great story\" but it meant losing\n\nboth Mel and Cassie. I think this was partly a punishment for RS\n\ndemanding a story.\n\nThis led to RS's hotline message where she basically blasted JFP about\n\nthe firing, said she did NOT want Mel to leave, and said it was only a\n\nmatter of time before she gets the ax too. In this week's Soap Opera\n\nDigest, much of the message is reproduced--letting millions of people\n\nread about the problems with JFP.\n\nEven if JFP probably won't get rid of her, I think she is making it easy\n\nfor RS to leave in Feb. 2000. Or, she my give Robin an early out--which\n\nis even worse.\n\nI don't trust JFP more than I can throw her.\n\nGreg\n\nGregory Rayner <gra...@gte.net> wrote in article\n\n>I am quite certain this is true.\n\n>\n\n> First, a little prehistory.

I personally think she is FAR\n\nto classy to do something like this.\n\nNow, the fact is that JFP has had a preference for many AW actors (see\n\nbelow). She considered Kevin McKlatchey (sp?) who I believe (correect me\n\nif I'm wrong) was Kale Brown's son on AW. JFP also has pushed to take on\n\nBolger on a contract basis, but was rejected by the network\n\nThen we have the rumor that WOULD NOT DIE about Dano coming to OLTL at a\n\ntime when she was having difficult negotiations at AW. Now, we have\n\nrumors about Robin CHristopher, Dano's daughter, being considered as a\n\nCassie recast. Now, Christopher and Bolger were lovers on AW. Then if\n\nDano were added to the mix...\n\nI know this sounds like a HUGE conspiracy theory. But, I think its just\n\nthat JFP likes certain actors (or got to like a group of actors working\n\non one story) and would like to bring them to OLTL.\n\nPlus, it is not a new practice to try and reunite actors who worked\n\ntogether on other shows, witness\n\nAlex/LuJak GL to AMC\n\nPatch/Kayla DAYS to GH\n\nand many other DAYS actors went to GH.\n\n> So many of these seem to be AW actors.

She just, for whatever reason, has hired most people from this\n\nshow, possibly because she feels the most animosity to this show and\n\nwants it to suffer. It's especially a slapin the face if characters\n\nappear on a higher-rated show which is opposite AW in many markets.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm sure she genuinely likes the people she hires.\n\nLet us not forget--Derwin and Satra are from GL, and JFP would probably\n\ntry to fire Viki herself if she could get A. Martinez (SB)--who\n\naccompanied her to the last Soap Opera Awards (and who she visibly\n\ndrewls over)\n\nWe should distinguish between the SHOW and the CAST. In my (obviously\n\nbiased opinion) AW and OLTL -HAD- the best casts on daytime--from young\n\nto old. The AW cast deserves special kudos. Some of them have had wage\n\ncuts, haave been through many cut-backs and lay-offs, the show's total\n\nbudget is the smallest fraction of what, say, DAYS and Y&R get. Despite\n\nall of this crap, they perservere and give their all. Now, the SHOW has\n\nsucked in the past, with poor writing and poor management, which of\n\ncourse severely affects the ratings. My take--good cast, sucky total\n\nquality (due to the above-entioned reasons). So, I can see JFP wanting\n\nto get some of these hard-working, talented actors. But JFP is\n\ncompletely out of hand, using a friend whether he or she is necessary or\n\nnot.\n\nA case in point-- Sykes. Look, he admitted he helped Barbara and made\n\nthe anonymous calls, but he still comitted some serious crimes, and used\n\nhis position to push for the arrest of Dorian and R.J. He should\n\nprobably be arrested himself, or, at least be sent from Llanview. Why\n\ndoes he stay after all of this? JFP.\n\n> I was a long term OLTL viewer when Robin Strasser was hired.

Again, A) I'm not\n\nsaying this is a wide-scale mission to get AW to OLTL, it just so\n\nhappens that she likes numerous actors from AW. B) I'm not saying that\n\nDano would go for it.\n\nNow, let's look at the facts:\n\nStrasser has basically said she's out of there next Feb. (prob. unless\n\nJFP leaves or the two magically become soul sisters).\n\nOLTL without Dorian is a dangerous move, even for Il Duce. The role\n\nwould likely be recast. It's not like casting Will Rappaport. A recast\n\nwould require an experienced actress, who could be a suitable opponent\n\nfor Viki. preferably with somewhat of a name.\n\nNow, Dano IS JFP's friend and has experience on OLTL. Why wouldn't JFP\n\ntry to contact Dano and offer her the role? She thought Gibbs would be a\n\nbetter Kevin than Stapleton, why not Dano as Dorian?\n\nDoesn't the timing strike you as interesting? If this were true, there\n\nhad to be a big enough window of time to get a commitment from Dano, NOT\n\nre-sign with Strasser by the end of her negotiations period, and bring\n\non Dano when her contract was up--when APril? May? So they'd have an\n\neight week hiatus wihtout Dorian (which they did in the fall, anyway)\n\nuntil Dano came on. Again, this is from JFP's ASSUMED point of view\n\nonly, not Dano's.\n\nYou also suggested that Dano's early re-signing indicated that this\n\nwhole theory is a bunch of hooey. I see the situation a bit differently.\n\nAs I recall, this was a time in which rumors of cancellation of AW\n\n(maybe by summer) were pretty strong, at AW cast morale was low, just\n\nafter Savitz was axed. I think the TPTB at AW were eager to show that,\n\n\"WE are committed to Dano and she is committed to us\". I think it's\n\nquite common practice to announce that a major player is staying way in\n\nadvance--because the negotiation process starts earlier too. There's a\n\nbig difference even between, \"Clint is not staying\" and \"Viki is not\n\nstaying\". They leave lots of time to work out in contract kinks, or,\n\nconversely, to prepare for the shockwaves if the major player should\n\ndecide to leave.\n\nIf this is all nonsense, Donna, how do you envision the future? RS\n\nleaves in Feb (and the chances are pretty good), do you think JFP will\n\nA) Not replce Dorian?\n\nB) Start a new search for an unknown Dorian?\n\nC) Try to bring back Princi, Mallis etc. as Dorian?\n\nI still say it's a good bet JFP would ask one of her friends. And, if\n\nthis is so, if she wanted Dano, why wait until she was in a new, 2 (or\n\nmore) year contract?\n\nAgain, tell me what is so out-landish here.\n\nGreg\n\nOn Sun, 07 Mar 1999 02:10:19 GMT the rec.arts.tv.soaps.abc\n\nnetizen no-...@fightingback.com (Shoshanna ) posted the\n\nfollowing in Msg# <36e2dbc4...@news.harborside.com> :\n\n| I agree with you about not being a fan of AW, but I've seen enough of\n\n| Linda Dano to think that she would bring a new dimension to Dorian-- I\n\n| imagine that her portrayal would have greater depth, subtlety, and\n\n| intelligence.\n\nI love Linda Dano but I can not imagine anyone bringing her\n\nin as a recast for Dorian. I hope that Dano continues as\n\nFelicia on AW for many, many successful years, but barring\n\nthat, she needs a totally new character written for her,\n\nsomewhere. I hate to even discuss this since I know it would\n\ncreep Dano out for people to keep talking about her taking\n\nRobin Strasser's job! It's just not a fit, folks.\n\nAnyway, I know that most of Llanview of late seems\n\nunappreciated by long term fans here on RATSa, although fans\n\nelsewhere, or maybe newer fans, seem to be enjoying the heck\n\nout of a number of things, all that said, in spite of\n\nagreeing that Dorian's current \"storyline\" is shallow,\n\nrepetitive, over the top, etc. that I still got a great kick\n\nout of watching Strasser & Sofie at the CrossXRoads the\n\nother day. LOL, dish it up, if this is what you're given, at\n\nleast you can tromp all over it & then some.\n\n--\n\nDonnaB RATSFuzz, CCWF, MPW, LGAW, GRITS, SWATCHr & ARIAA <*>\n\nwww.delphi.com/soapopera 8^> icq308592\n\nRIP Dusty Springfield \"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\"\n\n\"Death doesn't seem nearly the handicap I thought it was.\n\nClearly there *is* an afterlife & it's right here in Salem.\n\nMove to Salem, where death isn't a permanent condition...\n\nmerely a temporary inconvenience.\" - Eve, AltDAYS #144"
