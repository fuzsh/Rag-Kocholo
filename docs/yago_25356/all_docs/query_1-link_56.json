        "text": "I was arrested in another state and charged with a serious crime in Alabama from 25 years ago. After a lot of research my wife and I chose David Vickers to represent me. The main factors in our choice were his experience and that he is a Christian. Mr. Vickers is a former prosecutor and a part-time judge. When we met with Mr. Vickers and reviewed the charges and my case, he strongly recommended Richard White, his partner, to conduct most of the courtroom stuff.\n\nWe met with Richard and liked him immediately. Richard is amazing in how quickly he grasps the important points and things that make a strong defense. After looking at the case for about 30 minutes, he understood what was behind the scenes and knew how he would defend it. We were VERY impressed with him.\n\nAt trial, Richard did a perfect job. Perry Mason could not have done better. The only bump in the road was in closing. The prosecution team spent most of their closing trash-talking Richard. No kidding. He was so mad I thought he was going to have a stroke! He was so mad he forgot his planned closing. Of course, that was exactly what the corrupt prosecutor intended.\n\nIf I were to ever need a defense lawyer again, there is no one else I would even consider. Richard is an amazing guy. He is SO SHARP and QUICK and he really knows his stuff. We like David very much, too, buy David is a gentleman. Richard is a pit bull dog! If you are going to trial HIRE THESE GUYS.\n\nThe fear and angst felt for being charged with a criminal offense were indescribable. I faced an unfortunate situation where so often I posed these questions: Will I go to prison? How am I going to explain this debacle to my employer? What will my friends and family think? How will I manage without my children? Were all valid thoughts and concerns I had.\n\nA good friend of mine recommended Attorney Richard White. My heart began to settle as I knew she would not stray me the wrong direction. Mr. White was very straight forward and honest with me concerning the charges I faced. Richard White provided an outstanding defense in court which was his main priority as prosecutors attempted to nail me without a plea deal that would have ultimately left me with a criminal record.\n\nVickers and White is a judgment-free atmosphere, so I was able to tell my side of the story, and most importantly, they were on my side when I felt my back was against the wall. Mr. White and his team advocated for me and worked tirelessly on my behalf. They listened to me and developed a strong defense which led to the ultimate unanimous decision of a NOT GUILTY verdict. I would recommend Vickers and White to anyone who is facing charges.\n\nMr. Richard white is an amazing lawyer and a god honored man when I tell him and his staff all about business that’s exactly what I mean they will help and listening to anything you have to say and also gives you good advice when I explain to Mr. Richard about my case he explained to me what I needed to say when I was scared and had second thoughts he pulled me to the side and told me what was best for me to say to the judge to keep me at home with my daughter, I really appreciate him and his staff for being a listening ear. If you need a lawyer, contact Mr. Richard white, he’s the best."
