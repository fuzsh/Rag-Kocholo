        "text": "Ernest James Vickers was born on January 14, 1941 to Robert and Viola Vickers, in Jacksonville, FL.\n\nHe was the oldest of eight children. He attended Stanton High School and Florida State College of Jacksonville. He later enlisted in the Army Reserve. However, shortly after becoming acquainted with Jehovah’s Witnesses, he requested an honorable discharge. Ernest dedicated his life to Jehovah on June 16, 1962. He was appointed as an Elder in 1963.\n\nErnest began a career at Burger King in 1968. Due to his hard work and dedication, he was later offered the opportunity to own a Burger King franchise, in Jacksonville, FL. Ernest was the owner and operator of the Burger King restaurants on Kings Rd. and State St., until his retirement in 2005.\n\nHe faithfully served Jehovah for over 55 years and maintained his integrity , to the end. He had strong faith in the Bible’s assurance at Job 14:14 & 15 that if a man dies, he can live again.\n\nErnest was preceded in death by his parents; brother, David Vickers; sisters, Etta Vickers Cooper and Dorothy Freeman; and daughter, Hattie Laymond.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his memories, his beloved wife of 43 years, Rosalyn; children, Aminta, Nivea (Rickey), Sergius (Beunca), Gartell, Kirk, Veda, Victor (Jamethia), Ernestine, and Roland; grandchildren; great-grandchildren; brothers, Larry and Anthony; sisters, Brenda and Lolita; nieces; nephews; cousins; and friends."
