        "text": "It is with deepest sorrow that we announce the passing of Irene Caroline Vickers in the early morning of August 9, 2022. Irene was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on April 19, 1939 to Alfonse Montsko and Emily “Millie” (Schneck), originally from Czechoslovakia. Irene spent her early summers on the farm of her uncle Edward Schneck, and her winters attending school in Toronto. Irene was working as a stenographer for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police when she met her future husband, Thomas Kenneth Vickers, a Cape Bretoner who was stationed as a Mountie in Toronto. Irene and Tom were married on September 10, 1960 in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, which began an adventure together that included running dogsleds in the NWT and travelling across Canada to live in five provinces and two territories. Irene is preceded in death by her parents and by her older sister, Edna Gauvin. Irene is survived by her husband Thomas Vickers; her children Wendy Vickers (Daniel Fleck), Terrence Vickers (Dawn MacDonald), Tim Vickers (Karen Beshara-Vickers), Troy Vickers (David Mosley), and Trigve Vickers; brother Edward Montsko (Betty); grandchildren Ada Vickers, Jack Vickers, Christopher Vickers, and Kira Beshara-Vickers, and step-grandchildren Michael MacDonald and Brody Beshara. A private ceremony will be held for family and invited guests, with a celebration of Irene’s life to be announced at a later date. The family wishes to express their sincere appreciation to Bayshore Home Health for the years of compassionate personal home care services, with special acknowledgement of Arlene Savage; to the staff and volunteers of the Fredericton Hospice House for their professionalism, compassion, gentleness, and patience in providing comfort to Irene and her loved ones in the final hours of her life; and to McAdam’s Funeral Home for the cremation and memorial support services. Donations on behalf of Irene can be made to Parkinson Canada."
