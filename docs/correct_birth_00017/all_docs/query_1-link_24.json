        "text": "For all of her eclectic outfits and wild antics, Lady Gaga thinks of herself as a homebody at heart. The A Star Is Born actor extolled the virtues of a quiet home life in a September 2018 Vogue cover story, calling her Malibu mansion her “sanctuary. [Her] oasis of peace.” Over the years, she’s owned or rented a handful of properties in both Southern California and her native New York City, though these days, she prefers the calm of the West Coast to the bustle of the East. “I just got rid of my place in New York—it was too hectic every day outside on the street,” she said in the same Vogue interview, adding that the slower pace of California allows her to focus “on the things that I believe in.… I’m embarking on new territory—with some nerves and some overjoyment.” Here, we’ve rounded up some of the spots that Gaga has called home.\n\n2000s\n\nThree years before she arrived on the scene with the release of The Fame, Gaga was just another musician trying to make it big in New York City. The singer rented a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the Lower East Side and reportedly penned much of her debut album there. She brought Anderson Cooper to the prewar building during a 60 Minutes interview in 2011, but she wasn’t able to show off the exact unit that she used to live in because the current tenant didn’t feel comfortable letting cameras into her home. Thankfully for fans, however, another unit in the same building hit the rental market for $2,000 a month in March 2021, giving Little Monsters everywhere a glimpse into Gaga’s pre-Fame life. The typical NYC apartment had hardwood floors, 10-foot ceilings, two sizable windows in the bedroom, and a set of French doors separating the bedroom from the living room. The unit where Gaga lived had previously hit the market in 2011 and 2015, according to People.\n\n2009\n\nFollowing the success of The Fame, Gaga rented a six-bedroom, eight-bathroom residence in Bel Air for around $25,000 a month. Images of the property reveal a Mediterranean-style pad situated behind paparazzi-proof security gates, with a double-height foyer for that perfect grand entrance. Wrought-iron railings and crystal chandeliers added to the opulence of the space, while a large pool out back offered unobstructed views of the city below. It’s not known how long Gaga stayed at the Bel Air home, but no doubt it was a welcome oasis of relative calm considering all the pandemonium around her during this time period.\n\n2013\n\nAs Gaga continued her upward career trajectory, she rented a $22,000-a-month penthouse just south of Central Park. The 2,000-square-foot duplex was located in a building that is a known favorite amongst celebrities—Lance Armstrong and Liza Minnelli were reportedly previous tenants—due in large part to the privacy it offers. Gaga’s pad included four terraces, two wood-burning fireplaces, a walk-in closet, and a grand staircase. The stylish star left her creative mark on the unit during her stay there, reportedly decorating the place with Hinson Martinique wallpaper, the leafy print synonymous with the Beverly Hills Hotel, as well as rose-colored mirrors.\n\nGaga’s next purchase came with plenty of musical pedigree. She snapped up Frank Zappa’s legendary Hollywood Hills home for $5.25 million, and the 6,700-square-foot pad was just as eccentric as one might expect it to be. Much of the six-bed, seven-bath home featured custom details reflective of Zappa’s unique sense of style, including a dragon mural in the dining room, porthole windows and doors salvaged from vintage submarines, driftwood railings, and a cool steampunk spiral staircase. Perhaps the most unusual part of the property was also the part that appealed to Gaga most: a home recording studio known as the “Utility Muffin Research Kitchen.” The grounds also boasted a pool with a vintage diving board, a rooftop tennis court, a greenhouse, and two detached guesthouses. Gaga sold the place to Mick Jagger’s daughter Lizzy Jagger for $6.5 million in 2021.\n\nAlso in 2016, Gaga reportedly rented a stunning six-story townhouse in NYC’s Chelsea neighborhood for a whopping $67,000 a month. At the time, the 11,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, 12-bathroom mansion was newly constructed and featured some seriously covetable amenities, including a 480-bottle, climate-controlled wine room, a pool and spa in the cellar level, a large home theater, and a two-car garage on the first floor. While it’s unclear how long Gaga rented the pad, she was spotted shopping around for a home in Chelsea in subsequent years—perhaps the homebody craved a little more excitement outside her front door, after all."
