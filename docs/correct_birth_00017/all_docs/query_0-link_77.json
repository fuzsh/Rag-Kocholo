        "text": "Lady Gaga, born Joanne Angelina Germanotta, is an unconventional figure in music. Her albums like “The Fame” and “Born This Way” have been influential for people all around the world. Though she started as a musician, her work has extended far beyond that into television, film, fashion, and philanthropy. Her March 28 birthday is a time to learn a little more about an American icon and infuse some of her creativity into your day.\n\nBirth date:\n\nMarch 28, 1986\n\nAge:\n\n38\n\nZodiac Sign:\n\nAries\n\nCareer timeline\n\nLady Gaga born in Manhattan\n\nStefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born to a Catholic family in New York City.\n\n\"The Fame\"\n\nLady Gaga released her debut album after relocating to Los Angeles ; two singles, \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face,\" reached number one in the U.S. and several other countries.\n\n\"American Horror Story: Hotel\"\n\nIn the fifth season of \"American Horror Story,\" she starred as the hotel owner, and receives a Golden Globe for her work.\n\n\"A Star is Born\"\n\nGaga played the lead female role in \"A Star is Born,\" the fourth remake of a film that was originally released in 1937.\n\nLady Gaga's 4 Wildest Controversies\n\nThe Meat Dress\n\nArtistic or horrific? Designer Franc Fernandez sure helped Lady Gaga push the envelope at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe Breast-Milk Flavored Ice Cream\n\nThe Icecreamists took it upon themselves to release an ice cream flavor called \"Baby Gaga,\" which included breast milk as an ingredient; needless to say, Gaga was not amused and threatened to sue.\n\nThe Anti-Religious Song\n\nNot one to shy away from religious criticism, Lady Gaga's song \"Judas\" is among her most controversial — especially given that it was released days before Easter.\n\nThe Ex-Boyfriend Lawsuit\n\nIn 2010, Gaga's ex-boyfriend (and ex-business partner) sued her for a hefty $30.5 million. They would eventually settle for $12 million."
