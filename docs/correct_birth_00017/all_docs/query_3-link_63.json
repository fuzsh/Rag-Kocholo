Her thick, blunt bangs and long, platinum blonde hair are her signature look, but questions arose when Christina Aguilera appeared on the MTV Video Music Awards sporting the same cut and color. Lots of people in the media accused Christina of copying Lady Gaga's look but Gaga was civil.\n\nLady Gaga in her Poker Face music video\n\nShe said: \"A lot of people have been saying that she is copying my style with her new song. I guess it bears somewhat of a resemblance but I wouldn't say she is copying me. This type of dance music is becoming more popular and I don't blame her for wanting to make and perform it. Her performance was great and it's [Keeps Getting' Better] a hot track.\" (Blender) Lady Gaga is totally a down to earth girl, but she's got an out of this world sound!\n\nHot Tracks from The Fame:\n\nJust Dance, Beautiful, Dirty, Rich, Poker Face\n\nLady Gaga Fun Facts:\n\nLady Gaga’s real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta.\n\nHer favourite colours are black and lavender.\n\nLady Gaga's debut single, \"Just Dance,\" was released to radio in early 2008.\n\nIn 2014, she released an album of jazz duets with crooner Tony Bennett entitled Cheek to Cheek, which later won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.\n\nIn October 2016, Gaga released her fifth studio album, Joanne, her fourth album to reach number one in the United States.\n\nLady Gaga's name was inspired by the Queen song, 'Radio Gaga'.\n\nHer natural hair color is brown.\n\nShe’s 5'1\" tall.\n\nRelated Stories:"
