        "text": "Gaga's unique stage name was inspired by the Queen song, \"Radio Ga-Ga.\" She originally came up with the idea after her producer Rob Fusari sang the song to her in response to hearing some of her early glam rock-influenced music.\n\nIn addition to Queen, Gaga became obsessed with many other glam artists of the '70s and '80s, such as Elton John and David Bowie, just as she was beginning to experiment more with her sound and style. In fact, without the likes of Bowie there may never have been a Lady Gaga at all. Gaga even paid tribute to Bowie's inspiring aesthetic in her very first video for \"Just Dance\" by sporting a lightening bolt across her face in the style of Bowie's Aladdin Sane album cover.\n\nThough Gaga has perhaps become best known for her outlandish fashion choices and over-the-top performances, her success has always been rooted in good, old-fashioned, musical talent and a studious attitude. She first started playing the piano at the age of 4 and went on to take her first singing lessons at 11. By the age of 13, she had already written her first song and from that moment on it was clear she was destined for big things.\n\nAt age 11, Gaga was accepted into the highly esteemed Juilliard School in Manhattan, but instead (at her parent's behest) attended Convent of the Sacred Heart, an Upper East Side private Catholic school.\n\nHer schoolmates there even included Paris and Nicky Hilton, who seemed to make a bigger impression on her than the nuns did. “I am fascinated with the blonde woman as seductress,” she told The Telegraph. Gaga is, of course, naturally brunette. “There’s a way that these women position themselves in front of the cameras. There’s a real art to fame.”\n\nCatholic school helped Gaga develop her strict work ethic, but it also forced her to develop a tough skin as a result of the ruthless bullying she experienced while there. She told Rolling Stone that her experimental style is what made her a prime target: \"I used to do these really big 'Evita' brows [and] I used to self-tan [...] and people would say, 'Why the fuck are you so orange, why do you do your hair that way, are you a d*ke? Why do you have to look like that for school?' I used to be called a sl*t [...] I didn't even want to go to school sometimes.\"\n\nUltimately, she's managed to draw strength from her dark teenage years. \"Bullying really stays with you your whole life,\" she told Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. \"And it really, really never goes away. And I know you're using words like 'superstar' [...] But I was never the winner. I was always the loser. And that still stays with me. And do I want to stick it to anybody? No. I just wanna make music.\"\n\nGaga first started taking singing lessons at age 11 with Don Lawrence, Christina Aguilera's vocal coach. And this fact was not lost on Christina when Gaga's career started to take off in 2008, with many comparing the two blonde singers: \"I'm not sure who this person is, to be honest,\" Aguilera replied coldly when asked about Gaga, adding, \"I don’t know if it is a man or a woman.\"\n\nGaga was unfazed by the antagonistic comments: \"I think she’s very talented and, anyway, look at me: I might as well be a gay man. When I hear comments like that, I’m like, ‘She’s dead on,’ because she saw the Warhol in me.\"\n\nGaga also still takes lessons with Lawrence to this day. Leading up to her triumphant Sound Of Music performance at the 2015 Oscars, she practiced with him every day for a year and a half."
