        "text": "Stars are born in Los Angeles all day, every day. Well, not really, but you can’t fault those for trying, by arriving here from all corners of the world since D. W. Griffith found the sleepy hamlet of Hollywood in 1910 and thought to himself “Hmmm—we could make a few movies here…”\n\nWhen Bradley Cooper decided to tackle the remake of A Star Is Born, the location for the film should have been a no-brainer: Los Angeles, the quintessential city of showbiz dreams, both realized and broken. Yet, the Lady Gaga-starring 2018 movie does not actually feel like an LA movie.\n\nA 2019 Oscar winner for Best Original Song, A Star Is Born deliberately fudges both the timeline and the protagonists’ whereabouts, perhaps mirroring the hazy, dream-like quality of this cautionary tale about self-medication, self-neglect, codependence and tinnitus. At several points the film seems shot through a 70s era yellow lens, the polar opposite of LA's current iconic, crisp blue sky.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Stop reading here if you haven’t seen the film and don’t want important plot points revealed. Or if you have not been exposed to the (at least) three previous versions of the exact same story, or countless clichéd spins on it, or parodies of it. (The Simpsons did not one, but THREE riffs on the title—“A Star Is Torn,” “A Star Is Born Again,” and “A Star Is Burns”!)\n\nRegardless of the unusually hazy light or the fuzzy timeline and locations, the most memorable moments of A Star Is Born take place in Los Angeles - from Jackson Maine (Cooper) and Ally (Gaga)’s lengthy first date, to the duo’s performance of legit showstopper “Shallow,” to the unraveling of their relationship and the tragic ending (we told you there’d be spoilers).\n\nCome then, on a tour of A Star Is Born Los Angeles locations, including places where the film was actually shot and the local joints where you can create your own A Star Is Born experience.\n\nAfter a short Jackson Maine concert scene (more about those later), Jackson meets Ally at a drag bar. (Gaga’s Ally is one word, like Madonna or Halsey, and pronounced like “Allie” instead of the singular of “allies.”) The location used for the lip-synching drag show is none other than The Virgil (4519 Santa Monica Blvd, Los Angeles 90029), the popular East Hollywood bar that used to be a gay joint called the Garage a few years back, but is now best known as the epicenter of alternative stand-up comedy. Check out their weekly Monday showcase Hot Tub, emceed by Kurt Braunohler and Kristen Schaal, for some of the coolest laughs in town.\n\nThe movie makes it unclear if Jack is too hammered or too gentlemanly to put the moves on Ally that first night, so as the sun rises, he takes her back to her home. As eagle-eyed fans have confirmed, Ally’s family home is a 1904-built traditional house in Angelino Heights, between Silver Lake and Echo Park (739 E Kensington Rd, Los Angeles 90026). The household is led by Ally’s dad, Lorenzo (played by shock comedian Andrew “Dice” Clay as a sort of Sopranos minor character), who is surrounded by an entourage of character actors with a similar vibe. These scenes reportedly confused people as to whether Ally lived in one of New York’s outer boroughs or New Jersey - stereotypical East Coast accents abound - but Warner Bros. confirmed the character is indeed supposed to live in Angelino Heights.\n\nWant to experience the thrill of hitting some Gaga-esque notes and awe an unsuspecting audience? Sign up to take the stage during the legendary karaoke nights at Cafe Brass Monkey (3440 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles 90010), a Koreatown favorite for more than 50 years. All you have to do is trust us.\n\nOther concert locations in the film include the Shrine Auditorium (\"I'll Never Love Again\"), where Jack’s chaotic fall from grace takes place at the Grammys; DTLA’s Regent Theatre, the Forum in Inglewood, and places further afield like the Coachella and Stagecoach festivals at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. According to Cooper, his band shot \"in eight minutes between Jamey Johnson and Willie Nelson.\" Jack’s washed-up performance at a pharmaceutical convention was filmed at the Palm Springs Convention Center.\n\nOne of the film’s most lavish locations - and where most of the drama unravels - is Jackson Maine’s home (481 Cold Canyon Rd, Calabasas 91302) east of Malibu - officially it’s supposed to be in Topanga. The late mid-century modern, superbly 70s chic residence is an actual 1973 home in the Monte Nido neighborhood of Calabasas, designed by Douglas Rucker (who also designed a home for Kris Kristofferson, co-star of the 1976 version of A Star Is Born); and renovated by former owner Dan Meis, who also designed Crypto.com Arena (formerly known as STAPLES Center) in DTLA. As seen throughout the movie and in the understated climactic scene, the serene Post and Beam house is located on an idyllic lot surrounded by oaks.\n\nAs Ally gets ready in her hotel for one of her pop rock shows, Jack shows her the enormous “ALLY” billboard on Sunset. (The rainbow-colored movie billboard briefly became a gay Lady Gaga meme that played on the LGBTQ meaning of “ally.”)\n\nAlly is staying, natch, at Chateau Marmont (8221 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles 90046), the faux European castle at the easternmost boundary of the legendary Sunset Strip, which is generally where people stare at Sunset Strip billboards in the movies (see Myra Breckinridge, The Doors, etc.). We don’t recommend splurging on a massive billboard, but you can still dine in the lush garden patio and ogle the stars - don't even think about snapping a photo.\n\nSpeaking of classic Hollywood lodgings: according to some accounts, the Millennium Biltmore - the luxury hotel in DTLA that opened in 1923 and is permanently intertwined with Hollywood history (the Oscars were founded at its banquet hall) - was the location for the busy kitchen where early in the film Ally holds a restaurant job that crushes her will to live and prevents her from getting to her Edith Piaf karaoke performance on time. Other hotel scenes may have been shot at The Hollywood Roosevelt."
