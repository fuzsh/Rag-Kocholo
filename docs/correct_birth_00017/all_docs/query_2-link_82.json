        "text": "Revered Champagne house Dom Pérignon announced a $570,000 donation to Lady Gaga's Born this Way Foundation earlier this month. The money was raised as part of the status-symbol Champagne's multi-year creative partnership with the Grammy- and Oscar-winning artist.\n\n\"Over the years, Dom Pérignon has constantly explored affinities with committed creative talents and personalities,\" a Dom Pérignon representative told Wine Spectator via email. \"Through artistic collaborations, the maison stands with creators to support their causes and foundations.\"\n\nFunding the donation was the sale of a limited series of sculptures created by Lady Gaga with fashion director Nicola Formichetti. The iridescent sculptures, which each contain a jeroboam (3 liters) of 2005 Dom Pérignon Brut Rosé, were designed to mimic the flow of a dress and the color of the wine.\n\n(Courtesy of BPCM)\n\n\"What I love most about this sculpture is that it is made with a deep purpose,\" Lady Gaga, a noted wine country visitor, said in a statement. \"Generosity always makes a difference, and I’m honored that Dom Pérignon is kind enough to give back as part of our collaboration.\"\n\nThe total will be donated to the artist's foundation, which she started with her mother, Cynthia Germanotta. The organization supports initiatives to support young people's mental health.\n\n\"Dom Pérignon rosé springs from this desire to dare, seizing the red of the Pinor Noir grape in its primal radiance, capturing its vital power in a bold, assertive assemblage,\" the representative said. \"As a result, Dom Pérignon rosé is radical and daring, and the perfect choice to embody the vibrancy of this collaboration and its will to broaden horizons.\"\n\n(Courtesy of Beckstoffer Vineyards)\n\nBeckstoffers Donate $1 Million to Cal Poly Wine Program\n\nWhen it comes to pushing California's wine industry ahead, grapegrower Andy Beckstoffer is here to help. Last week, Andy and his wife, Betty, announced a $1 million donation to Cal Poly's Justin and J. Lohr Center for Wine and Viticulture to help fund the Beckstoffer Vineyards Fermentation Hall. The hall was completed in September and will be open to students early next year.\n\n\"Cal Poly is a wonderful university, and their viticulture program is excellent,\" Andy said in a statement. \"This new facility will further enhance that program. Cal Poly has produced some of the most talented viticulturists and vineyard managers in the world, and we are especially proud that they allowed us to be a part of this program.\" At least four key Beckstoffer Vineyards employees are graduates of Cal Poly’s wine program: Dave Michul, president & CEO (class of 1984); Brandon Axell, general manager, Mendocino (1998); Blake Wood, vineyard manager, Napa Valley (2006); and Leonel Soto Mora, viticulturist, Red Hills (2018).\n\n\"Students will produce Cal Poly’s commercial wines [in Beckstoffer Hall] as well as their own experimental varietals and blends,\" a representative from Cal Poly told Wine Spectator via email. The new $22 million state-of-the-art Justin and J. Lohr Center, including the Beckstoffer Vineyards Fermentation Hall, will be unveiled at Cal Poly’s Open House festivities this coming April."
