        "text": "Lady Gaga\n\nLady Gaga, originally named Stefani Joanne Germanotta, is a singer-songwriter and performance artist of American Origin, best known for her outrageous costumes and provocative lyrics. She also achieved huge popularity with songs like \"Just Dance,\" \"Bad Romance,\" or \"Born This Way.\"\n\nCareer and Early Life\n\nBorn on March 28, 1986, in New York City, Germanotta was raised in the same place by an Italian-American family. As a child, she began to learn music, and by the age of 14, she was performing in New York City clubs. Convent of the Sacred Heart was an all-girls Catholic school in Manhattan attended by Germanotta. His mother revealed during a chat show that her daughter faced a lot of humiliation and isolation when she was in middle school.\n\nAs a child, she was unique and different from other kids; this is the reason she got bullied. It impacted her mental health to the extent that she started questioning her self-worth and became very withdrawn. With her mother's support, she gradually overcame that phase. At the university level, she studied music at the Tisch Art School at NYU. After two years at Tisch, she decided to leave and follow her dreams.\n\nAfter dropping out of college, she transformed herself from Germanotta to Lady Gaga. Her style combined glam rock and outrageous fashion designs. She formed the revue Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow with Lady Starlight in 2007. Lady Gaga was also a songwriter for Britney Spears, the Pussycat Dolls, and Fergie. In 2007, she was signed by Akon and Interscope Records. She began work on her debut album, The Fame.\n\nShe modeled herself after theatrical performers such as David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust era, but the New York Dolls and Grace Slick were her adopted stage names. This character, whose name is derived from Queen's \"Radio Ga Ga,\" was a standout in the music industry. The combination of her high-energy, synthesized dance music and her theatrical performance created enthralling visuals and sounds. Lady Gaga crafted her own beauty line with her team 'Haus of Gaga', consisting of glamorous wigs and cool bodysuits.\n\nThe Fame and The Fame Monster\n\n\"Just Dance,\" her first single, became very popular in clubs across the United States and Europe. It eventually reached number one on Billboard's Pop Songs chart (also known as the radio chart). Three other singles from The Fame, \"Poker Face,\" LoveGame,\" and \"Paparazzi,\" also reached number one on The Radio Chart. Lady Gaga became the first artist to achieve four number-one spots from a debut album in its 17-year history.\n\nThe Fame received a positive reception from critics and was a huge commercial success, with more than 8 million copies sold worldwide by 2009. The fame not only brought her fame but 5 Grammy nominations, including song of the Year (\"Poker Face\") and album of the Year (\"The Fame\"). She bagged two Grammys- best electronic/dance recording (\"Poker Face\") and best electronic album. She performed an opening duet with Sir Elton John, which was much talked about after the award telecast. She also won three Brit Awards in February 2010, which are the British equivalent of the Grammys.\n\nThe Fame Monster was her second album. Released in 2009, it was originally a bonus disc and was almost immediately a hit. \"Bad Romance\" was a popular song from it. Other hits were \"Telephone\" and \"Alejandro.\"\n\nLady Gaga was a commercially successful artist in 2010. She had a sold-out concert tour that coincided with The Fame Monster's release. She also headlined Chicago's Lollapalooza music fest and performed before a record 20,000 viewers at NBC's Today Show. Forbes magazine named her one of the most influential women in the world, and she was also featured in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential people. In 2010, she was Billboard's Artist of the Year. At the 2011 Grammys, she stunned everyone with her unique appearance from inside an eggshell. She was encased in an egg and won honors for the best pop album (for The Fame Monster), best female pop performance, and best short-form video (\"Bad Romance\").\n\nLater Albums\n\nThe third album by Lady Gaga, Born This Way (2011), made the singer-songwriter look back to previous musical eras to find inspiration. A blonde dance-pop artist who is known for her provocative lyrics, Lady Gaga has often been compared to singer Madonna as well, particularly in Born This Way's initial two singles; the similarities were evident. The song's title track was a self-empowerment track that was akin to Madonna's 1989 hit single \"Express Yourself\". It was quickly declared a hit. The album also featured guitar player Brian May (Queen) and Saxophonist Clarence Clemons in guest appearances.\n\nIn 2013, Artpop was released by Gaga. While the enthralling lead track \"Applause\" extended her string of chart hits, the album was viewed as a failure commercially. The singer returned the next season with Cheek to Cheek, which was an album of classics that she co-produced together with Tony Bennett. The album was a top performer on charts on the Billboard 200 as well as the traditional jazz album charts. Additionally, it won the Grammy for best traditional pop album. The duo also took home this award for their next album, Love for Sale (2021), which was a tribute album dedicated to Cole Porter.\n\nIn the meantime, Lady Gaga continued with her recordings of solo albums. The more subdued Joanne (2016) did poorly up until her Halftime Super Bowl performance in February 2017 garnered a lot of attention. For her sixth album Chromatica (2020), Lady Gaga went back to her earlier songs, mixing disco and electronic pop.\n\nActing and activism\n\nIn addition to making songs, Lady Gaga also starred in films occasionally. She can be seen in Machete Kills (2013) and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014). She was a vampiric countess with no consideration for human suffering or life in the fourth season of the tv program American Horror Story: Hotel (2015-16). In recognition of her performance in the anthology series, Lady Gaga received a Golden Globe Award. The sixth season premiering in 2016, also featured Lady Gaga.\n\nShe garnered critical acclaim and was awarded an Oscar nomination for her debut part as the lead, a self-deprecating young singer-songwriter who was amid a remake of A Star Is Born (2018). She co-wrote most of that film's songs, a lot of which she sang with her co-star and director Bradley Cooper. The first single, \"Shallow,\" won two Grammy Awards and the Oscar for best original track.\n\nShe has stated that her manner of dress and behaviour is as much an aspect of her career as her music and that turning off that aspect could be a huge disappointment for her supporters. Perhaps it's the lack of self-consciousness and exuberant honesty that has attracted her and made her popular among the LGBT population. She has been a kind of gay icon. She is a strong advocator of many humanitarian initiatives especially those in connection with LGBT struggles. She is also an active proponent of gay rights across the globe. She is bisexual herself, which adds another intriguing aspect to her famed persona.\n\nShe was a guest presenter at 2009's National Equality March in Washington, D.C. In 2021, during the presidential inauguration of President Joe Biden, she was honored to sing the national anthem. There's no way for anyone to raise fingers at the extraordinary musician, and maybe this is what contributes to her appeal. We're sure to see more success from this talented musician in the coming years, and without a doubt, there will be some surprises too.\n\nFan websites dedicated to Lady Gaga include her fashion, music, and fans who are influenced by her work and the culture she has created. They share their personal stories, photographs, their thoughts, and views about the American singer who has become their hero. The websites are designed by people who are enthralled and fascinated by Lady Gaga's music and life. According to a lot of music critics, music lovers, and admirers, Lady Gaga will have more success than she has today. She is the favorite female singer of many people around the globe and is now the most talked about celebrity in show business."
