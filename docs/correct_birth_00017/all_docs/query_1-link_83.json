        "text": "Some may dismiss pop as inauthentic. But for Lady Gagaâone of popular cultureâs greatest, most extravagant creationsâthe inauthenticity is the point. No artist has more defiantly embodied that provocation this century than the one born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (in New York in 1986). Never wedded to the same imageâher most memorable looks (among many) have included a gown fashioned from raw meat, a red-carpet-appropriate pair of dish gloves, and âthe worldâs first flying dressââGaga personifies popâs surface obsessions while simultaneously upending them. In a sense, her creative identity had crystallized by age 21; sheâd been a child pianist, aspiring actor, and burlesque performer. Each of these facets powered her careerâs most distinct parts: the celebrity fascination of her first two albums, 2008âs The Fame and 2009âs The Fame Monster; the subversive layering of 2011âs Born This Way and 2013âs ARTPOP; the sincere reverence of 2014âs Cheek to Cheek, her jazz standards album with Tony Bennett; the rootsier songwriting of 2016âs Joanne; and 2020âs jubilant return to her neon-hued electro roots, Chromatica. If the 2009 smash âPaparazziâ reveled in the flashes, then âBorn This Wayâ celebrated inner light: In translating her diffuse identity into world-conquering art, Gaga has become a beacon to anyone else whoâs felt like an outsider. Her loyal following of Little Monsters has affirmed a deep connection to her message of self-love and self-expression, despite popâs fickleness and her chameleonic exterior. She played out a simpler version of her path to fame in the Oscar-worthy 2018 remake of A Star Is Born. But while her characterâs ascent was abetted by her lover, Gagaâs was all her own."
