        "text": "Lady Gaga returned to the New York City bar where she performed years ago as an unsigned act on the eve of her new album's release, singing rock and pop songs for an audience including Robert De Niro, Helen Mirren, die-hard fans and music industry insiders.\n\nGaga sang tracks from \"Joanne,\" released Friday, at The Bitter End late Thursday, going from piano to guitar. She was backed by a band that included Mark Ronson, who produced the new album, and Hillary Lindsey, who co-wrote with Gaga.\n\nThe Grammy winner, who grew up in New York City, performed songs like \"Million Reasons\" and \"Joanne,\" an homage to her aunt who died at 19 from lupus before Gaga was born (Joanne is the singer's middle name). After the performance inside the bar, Gaga performed outside for her feverish fans. She sang two more songs from the top of the bar's roof, even sitting down on the edge of the roof to belt out the lyrics as fans and residents cheered her on.\n\nThe Thursday show, also attended by Gaga's mother and father as well as Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer of the Comedy Central series \"Broad City,\" was the second date on her Dive Bar Tour with Bud Light. She performed the first show two weeks ago in Nashville, Tennessee, and a third performance, at an unannounced location, will take place Oct. 27."
