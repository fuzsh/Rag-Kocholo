        "text": "(born 1986). American singer-songwriter and performance artist Lady Gaga was known for her flamboyant costumes and sexy lyrics. She achieved popular success with songs such as “Just Dance,” “Poker Face,” “Bad Romance,” and “Shallow.”\n\nStefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, in New York, New York. She learned music at an early age and was performing onstage in New York City clubs by the time she was a teenager. She studied for two years at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University before dropping out to manage her own career. She began transforming herself into Lady Gaga—a name derived from Queen’s song “Radio Ga Ga”—with a style that combined glam rock and over-the-top fashion design.\n\nIn 2007 Lady Gaga and performance artist Lady Starlight formed a revue called the Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow. During that time Lady Gaga also wrote songs for other pop artists such as Fergie, the Pussycat Dolls, and Britney Spears. That same year the rapper Akon and Interscope Records signed Lady Gaga to a deal. She subsequently began preparing her debut album The Fame (2008).\n\nLady Gaga modeled herself on such theatrical performers as David Bowie during his Ziggy Stardust period, the New York Dolls, and Freddie Mercury of the band Queen. However, she created a character that came to occupy a unique space in the music world. She wore extravagant costumes and eye-catching wigs—many of them created by her own Haus of Gaga. Combined with her up-tempo synthetic dance music and edgy performance style, Lady Gaga created stunning sounds and onstage visuals.\n\nLady Gaga’s 2008 single “Just Dance” (from The Fame) earned a Grammy nomination in 2009. However, she was then ineligible for a nomination in 2010 as best new artist. (This perceived injustice prompted the Recording Academy to revise that rule later in 2010.) Three other singles from The Fame—“Poker Face,” “LoveGame,” and “Paparazzi”—also reached number one. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, Lady Gaga won for best dance recording (“Poker Face”) and best electronic/dance album.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Lady Gaga embarked on the sold-out Monster Ball Tour to coincide with the release of her second album, The Fame Monster. Although the album contained only eight songs, three of them—“Bad Romance,” “Telephone,” and “Alejandro”—became hits in 2010. (The album won a Grammy Award in 2011 for best pop vocal album while “Bad Romance” won a Grammy for best female pop vocal and best short form music video.) To cement her position as one of the most commercially successful artists in 2010, Lady Gaga made a headline performance at the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago, Illinois, and appeared in front of 20,000 people for NBC’s Today show.\n\nLady Gaga’s third album, Born This Way, appeared in 2011. It produced the hit songs “Born This Way” and “Judas.” In 2013 Lady Gaga released Artpop. The energetic lead single “Applause” extended her string of chart successes. However, the album was commercially disappointing. She came back the following year with Cheek to Cheek, a collection of songs that she recorded with Tony Bennett. The recording topped the jazz and traditional jazz album charts, and it earned the Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album. In 2016 Lady Gaga released the album Joanne. A diverse collection of songs, it included touches of country, rock, dance, and pop. She won a Grammy in 2019 for best pop performance for the song “Joanne (Where Do You Think You’re Goin’?).” Meanwhile, in 2017 she performed in the halftime Super Bowl show. For her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020), Lady Gaga returned to her earlier music, mixing disco and electronic-pop. She and Ariana Grande won the 2020 Grammy Award for best pop duo/group performance for the song “Rain on Me.”\n\nIn addition to recording music, Lady Gaga made occasional acting appearances. She appeared in the films Machete Kills (2013) and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014). She then played a vampire in the television show American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–16). For that performance, she received a Golden Globe Award. She also appeared in the sixth season of the show, which aired in 2016. In 2018 Lady Gaga played an up-and-coming singer-songwriter in a remake of the film A Star Is Born. It was her first lead role, and she earned a best actress Oscar nomination for her performance. She also cowrote most of the movie’s songs, many of which she performed with costar and director Bradley Cooper. In 2019 the lead single, “Shallow,” won Grammy Awards for best pop duo/group performance and best song written for visual media, as well as an Academy Award for best original song."
