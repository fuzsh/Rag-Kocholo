        "text": "What is Lady Gaga's net worth?\n\nLady Gaga is an American pop singer, songwriter, and actress who has a net worth of $300 million. Lady Gaga, also known as Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, began her performing career as a musical theater and burlesque performer in the East Village in New York, seemingly attempting to follow in the footsteps of night club performers gone superstars like Bette Midler and Madonna. She struggled for a number of years but finally got the ball rolling around 2005, recording her first album and writing songs for other artists, such as Britney Spears, Fergie, and the Pussycat Dolls.\n\nThe release of her first album, \"The Fame,\" seemed to be only moderately successful, but five months after its release, the first single from the album, \"Just Dance,\" was everywhere. Her relentless touring in Europe and smaller clubs in the US had paid off, and by the end of 2009, multiple songs from the album were regular fixtures on the radio, and she had multiple Grammy nominations and two Grammy Awards for all of her hard work and tenacity. Since then, she has continued to churn out great music and make headlines. A vocal social activist and a natural exhibitionist, her arrivals at awards shows consistently receive their own special coverage.\n\nIn recent years, Lady Gaga earned $30 – $40 million from her various endeavors, the majority of which comes from touring and her former lucrative Las Vegas residency.\n\nEarly Life\n\nStefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, in Manhattan. Her family is Catholic are of Italian ancestry. Her mother, Cynthia, is a philanthropist and business executive. Her father, Joseph, is an internet entrepreneur. She has a younger sister named Natali. Lady Gaga was raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where she began playing piano at age four. She wrote her first piano ballad at 13 and, at 14, began performing. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp. She attended the all-girls Catholic school Convent of the Sacred Heart. In the fall of 2003, at age 17, Lady Gaga gained early admission to the music school at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and moved into a dorm on NYU's campus. She dropped out of NYU during her sophomore year to pursue a career in music.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2007, Gaga was working at Sony/ATV Music Publishing as a songwriter. It was there that Akon discovered her and had her sign a joint deal with Interscope and his label, KonLive Distribution. The following year, Gaga released her debut album \"The Fame,\" which included her chart-topping singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face.\" She was an instant megastar. In 2000, she released the EP \"The Fame Monster,\" which contained the hit songs \"Alejandro,\" \"Telephone,\" and the mega-hit \"Bad Romance.\" Gaga's second full-length album, \"Born This Way,\" was released in 2011 and hit the charts out of the gate in the number one spot. Her third album, \"Artpop,\" was released in 2013 and experimented with EDM. She went on to release \"Cheek to Cheek\" with Tony Bennett in 2014, \"Joanne\" in 2016, and \"Chromatica\" in 2020. In early July, \"Chromatica\" was the fifth best-selling album on Amazon Music.\n\nIn 2015, Gaga landed a lead role in the Ryan Murphy series \"American Horror Story: Hotel.\" Gaga received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her role in the Fox miniseries.\n\nIn February 2017, Gaga performed at halftime of Super Bowl LI. In August 2017, Gaga began the Joanne World Tour. Gaga's creation of her album \"Joanne\" and preparation for her halftime show performance were featured in the Netflix documentary \"Gaga: Five Foot Two, \"which premiered in September 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Gaga played the lead in the film \"A Star Is Born.\" She also contributed to the film's soundtrack, which gave her her fourth number-one single, \"Shallow.\" She became the first person to win an Academy Award, a Grammy, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe Award in the same year.\n\nGaga signed a two-year Las Vegas residency, named Lady Gaga Enigma, to perform at the MGM Park Theater. The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focuses on theatricality and includes the singer's biggest hits, and Jazz and Piano, which involves tracks from the Great American Songbook and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma residency show opened in December 2018, and the Jazz and Piano in January 2019, with the residency due to last until May 2020. Several months of her residency were postponed in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Chromatica Ball stadium tour had twenty dates in 2022 and grossed $112.4 million, and by the end of the year, she became the highest-grossing female touring artist. She also wrote the song \"Hold My Hand\" for 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which earned Gaga her third win for Best Original Song at the Satellite Awards. Gaga is set to star in \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" alongside Joaquin Phoenix in 2024.\n\nBankrupt After Tour\n\n\"I put everything in the show, and I actually went bankrupt after the first extension of The Monster Ball. And it was funny because I didn't know! And I remember I called everybody and said, \"Why is everyone saying I have no money? This is ridiculous, I have five number one singles – and they said, 'Well, you're $3m in debt.'\"\n\nOf course, Gaga's career continued to thrive after the end of that tour, and it's relatively easy to dig yourself out of debt when you have a high profile pop career. That's exactly what Gaga was able to do, thanks to a deal with Live Nation for a series of \"extended stadium shows\" as well as an HBO special that allowed her to make some money quickly following the cash-draining tour. But of course, for Gaga, she says it's not about the money in the first place:\n\n\"The beauty for me about being an artist is that the dream will never die, because I'm not obsessed with material things and don't care about the money and don't care about the attention of the public, but only the love of my fans, so for me it's about how much more devoted, how much better an artist can I become.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nLady Gaga's stage name is a reference to rock band Queen's song Radio Ga Ga. Lady Gaga's music and fashion are inspired by glam rock artists such as Queen and David Bowie, and pop singers such as Britney Spears, Madonna, and Michael Jackson.\n\nLady Gaga is known for her outrageous fashion choices as much as her performing abilities. Her fashion influence is Donatella Versace. Lady Gaga states fashion inspires her songwriting and performances.\n\nIn February 2015, Gaga became engaged to Taylor Kinney. Her engagement to Taylor Kinney ended in July 2016; she later said her career had interfered with their relationship. In October 2018, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino, whom she had met in early 2017. They ended the engagement in February 2019. In February 2020, she started dating entrepreneur Michael Polansky.\n\nThroughout the film \"Lady Gaga: Five Foot Two,\" she was seen suffering from chronic pain, which was later revealed to be the effect of fibromyalgia.\n\nGaga founded her nonprofit organization, the Born This Way Foundation. She's long been known for both her philanthropy and social activism, especially in relation to LGBTQIA+ rights and mental health awareness.\n\nIn 2020, she co-produced the \"Together At Home\" concert with Global Citizen. The event raised $130 million for Coronavirus relief. During the global pandemic, Gaga teamed up with a number of other musicians, including Pitbull and Tiesto, to do at-home DJ sets for her fans. In April 2023, Lady Gaga was appointed as co-chair of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities by President Joe Biden.\n\nIn early July 2020, Lady Gaga signed on to be the face of Valentino's newest perfume, Voce Viva.\n\nEarnigs\n\nIn 2012 alone, Gaga earned more than $80 million through album sales, tours, endorsements, and more. In a more typical year, she earns around $40 million. Between June 2018 and June 2019, she earned $39.5 million. She earned $38 million between June 2019 and June 2020. Even though Gaga had to cancel the last ten shows of the Joanne World Tour, it ultimately grossed $95 million from 842,000 tickets sold. The Chromatica Ball stadium tour in 2022 grossed $112.4 million on 834,000 tickets sold.\n\nJoker 2 Salary\n\nFor her role in the film \"Joker 2,\" Lady Gaga earned a $12 million salary.\n\nReal Estate\n\nLady Gaga lives on a six-acre property overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu, which she bought in 2014 for $22.5 million. The home, which was built in 2006, features five bedrooms and 12 bathrooms.\n\nIn August 2016, Lady Gaga bought Frank Zappa's former home in LA. Frank bought the house in the 1970s for $74,000. His widow, Gail, lived in the home until she died in 2015. Lady Gaga bought the home from the Zappa estate a year later. In late 2021, Gaga sold the home to Mick Jagger's daughter, Lizzy Jagger, for $6.5 million.\n\nLady Gaga also rented a New York City penthouse around 2017 for a brief time at a cost of $67,000 per month."
