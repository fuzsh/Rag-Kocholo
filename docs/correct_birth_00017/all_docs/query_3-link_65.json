        "text": "Lady Gaga has said her character in A Star Is Born was “informed by [her] life experience”.\n\nThe musician plays Ally in the new remake of the classic movie, a singer-songwriter who is given her big break by ageing star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper).\n\nSpeaking to Elle, Gaga said: “The character of Ally is informed by my life experience. But I also wanted to make sure that she was not me. It was a cadence of both.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued to share her understanding of Ally. “When I watched the film for the first time I said, ‘Oh my gosh, I thought she was really sad at the end of the movie, but I didn’t realise how sad she really was at the beginning,'” she explained.\n\n“She’s really kind of a depressed girl. She works as a catering girl. She has her friend Ramon, who is very important to her. She takes care of her dad at home and takes care of all the drivers who come and have breakfast in the morning. But she’s truly given up on herself as a musician.”\n\nThe reaction to A Star Is Born, which also saw Cooper make his directorial debut, has been resoundingly positive, with paticular praise saved for Gaga’s performance. After the film was released last week (October 5), the pop star’s fans took to Twitter to demand she be nominated for the 2019 Oscars.\n\nRecommended\n\nLast month, Gaga revealed she didn’t think she could have “carried off” her role in the movie without making her latest album, ‘Joanne‘.\n\nSpeaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1, she said: “I think things come in sequence and artists, you know, I think that we move them to a certain cadence in a sequence, in the way that we want to put things into the world that we believe in,” she said.\n\n“But especially with the song ‘Shallow’ being such a crucial moment in the film. I did work on ‘Joanne’ with Mark Ronson and I worked on ‘Shallow’ with Mark Ronson, and Andrew Wyatt, and Anthony Rossomando.”"
