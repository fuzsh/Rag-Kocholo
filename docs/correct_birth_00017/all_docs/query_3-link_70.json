        "text": "Although the world boasts of many pop icons today, Lady Gaga has proved that she’s poles apart from the rest of her kind. Apart from her foot-tapping numbers, the singer is also world-renowned for her eccentric personality. Her sense of fashion has become a great source of inspiration for many youngsters across the world. Putting her education at stake, during her teens, Gaga decided to embark on a path which would lead her towards her dream. Although she struggled for a break during the initial couple of years, Gaga’s decision proved to be totally worth. She got her first break in 2008 through the album ‘The Fame’, and since then this celebrity’s fame has just grown by leaps and bounds. ‘The Beatles’, ‘Stevie Wonder’, ‘Pink Floyd’, ‘Led Zeppelin’ and ‘Mariah Carey’ are some of the few artists who influenced this woman to turn towards music. Her songs not only became chartbusters and party anthems, but also won her three time ‘Grammy’ award winner, which in itself in an incredible accomplishment. Though few individuals from across the world opine that her songs promote Satanism, Gaga’s popularity has continued to soar higher and higher over the past few years."
