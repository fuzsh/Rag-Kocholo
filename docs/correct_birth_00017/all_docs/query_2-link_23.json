        "text": "Lady Gagaâs second album operates under the cloak of night, to thrilling effect. Anthems like âHairâ and âMarry the Nightâ allow her to command the dance floor with her muscular pipes atop a driving four-on-the-floor pulse. The biblically minded âJudasâ is a snarling, storming passion play, while the title track celebrates diversity by commanding the world to get on its feet. Gagaâs love of rock, meanwhile, comes through on the sweeping power ballad âYoÃ¼ and Iâ and the triumphant, Clarence Clemons-assisted âThe Edge of Glory.â"
