        "text": "I have a PhD from MIT, but I am hopeless at this! 😅 We already know that entrepreneurship is hard, but try being a small business owner running a 20 pax remote team with young kids at home. You don’t just have to be an excellent project manager… you literally have to be an octopus! 🐙 So here’s my problem in a nutshell: if my business were smaller, I would have much simpler workflows. And if my business were bigger, I would have entire teams in finance, procurement, HR and even a Chief of Staff to take care of all this. But what if I am Malcolm in the Middle? Somebody… SOS! 🆘 I am managing 50+ active HR and client retainer contracts, which means a contract expires at least once a week! In extreme cases, both parties go off contract and nobody realizes it. 🆘 My team manages client workflows that are incredibly complex, often splintering into teams from editorial to design, IT, marketing and distribution. We work on drafts—sometimes in parallel—containing tracked edits by 4-5 stakeholders, making it a nightmare to piece together. 🆘 As a LinkedIn coach, I have multiple versions of my corporate workshops, and the information is trapped in 100s of folders nested 2-3 levels deep. When I can’t find something, I end up starting a draft from scratch. In summary, you’re listening to… A really, really frustrated boss mom! 🤯 Which is why I was glad to hear about something that I can only describe with one word: LIBERATION. At Momentum 24 in Singapore in late July last week, Docusign CEO Allan Thygesen introduced Docusign’s new platform and suite of apps, Docusign IAM, which is also creating an entirely new SaaS category—Intelligent Agreement Management. According to a new Deloitte study, outdated agreement systems cause businesses to lose nearly SGD$2.4T in economic value globally each year—which Docusign dubs as the Agreement Trap. Docusign IAM’s goal? To help business of all sizes (and small businesses like mine!) with features such as: 🚀 Maestro: it lets us custom-build automated workflows that accelerate agreement processes…. without code! 🚀 Navigator: imagine being able to centrally store, manage and unlock data in our contracts 🚀 App Center: In Singapore, we can now easily connect our agreement, data and workflows to third-party systems such as Singpass to verify our identity, meaning bye-bye witnesses! I mean, until last month I had assumed Docusign could only do one thing… get an e-signature! 😂 But now, I know I can get Singpass-verified signatures on contracts, create an automated workflow for client approvals, and even be alerted to when a contract is expiring. If you’re a small business owner, I can’t tell you how incredibly liberating this is! So, I still think that entrepreneurship is hard, but… Nobody should need a PhD to make this work! 🎉 #docusign #momentum24 #singapore #linkedintopvoices 📸: This boss mom is always on the run, but at least I got to say hi to Docusign CEO Allan Thygesen and team!\n\nAll of us have a gift, a superpower 🎁 \"Each one of you has this exact same gift, this superpower that you can unleash,”says branding expert Chris Do. Chris said this at a masterclass you gave to my Find Your Superpower 🚀 six-week bootcamp participants and alumni. “But you got to get over yourself. You've got to un-program or de-program this voice in your head that, oh, you're calling too much attention to yourself.” Other highlights from this clip: 🚀 \"[Creating content] has helped me to find my true self, to unleash my superpower. Because it was the first time in my life where I felt like I can take all of me, not just parts of me, and to be able to share it with people.\" 🚀 \"I kept asking myself this question: What did I learn? How can I do this better? And that pursuit has completely transformed me.\" 🚀 \"If you can just make that critical decision to be consistent, to put out the work and put in the work, I think great things are waiting for you.\" -- Thank you Chris for these powerful words. We are very grateful. Your origin story as a content creator is truly inspiring to us. I'm hoping that you'd come visit us in Singapore... I’m gonna manifest this! 🙏 #findyoursuperpower #chrisdo #masterclass #linkedinbootcamp #linkedincoach #linkedintopvoices #inspiration #originstory #storytelling #branding\n\nI never raised my hand to speak as a student 🙋♀️ From the time I was a young child to when I was a high school student, I was as meek as a mouse. 🐭 This continued all the way to my university studies in the UK. And you probably wouldn't believe that it is the same person telling you this, but it is unfortunately true. I shared this with my friend Crystal Lim-Lange on her very popular Comfort & Growth podcast last year. I explained that when I was a PhD student at MIT, I signed up for a pass-fail class at their MBA school, MIT Sloan, and I was surprised that everyone had no issues about speaking up. 10 hands would go up every time the professor asked, and when called upon, they would speak eloquently and fearlessly. Nobody seemed to have limiting beliefs or mindset blocks about speaking publicly. Except me. 😶 What was holding me back? Why was I on mute? It was my societal and cultural conditioning to listen quietly and to prioritize knowledge acquisition over the delivery of knowledge. And today, as a LinkedIn coach, I see myself in all of my clients. All of them have incredible track records and portfolios. They are top of category and best in class in their industry niche. But often, few people know how awesome they are... except for their inner circle and immediate colleagues. During my six-week bootcamps, I hold their hand, I nudge them, I play good cop & bad cop all in one. Their bootcamp buddies also cheer them on. I help them find their voice. And when they find it, they start singing... They simply can't stop singing their song! 🎶 How about you? Have you found it difficult to raise your hand and ask a question like me? 🙋♀️ #linkedincoach #linkedinbootcamp #linkedintopvoices #findyoursuperpower #branding #podcast\n\n48 hours in building mode 🚧 When I’ve built something to a place where it runs smoothly by itself, I typically get bored. I feel uninspired and sluggish. I hand it over to my trusted team leaders who do an amazing job of running it and keeping our clients happy. Just to clarify, it isn’t easy to run our workflows—they get pretty complex and it requires a lot of finesse to keep the plates in the air. But I never feel more alive than when I am in 0 to 1 mode. 🚀 I guess that’s why I became an entrepreneur in the first place. Take the last 48h for example, I spent the entire weekend working on a top secret project and I never felt like I was working, not even for a second. Because it is a passion project. It’s my ode to the greats. It is something I am doing because I WANT to, not because I HAVE to. My Find Your Superpower 🚀 community and bootcamp clients know that I always go above and beyond to support them. I’m currently building something to help us unlock our superpowers and turn all of us into superheroes. I know I know, some of you may find this really cheesy and corny, but I have seen many of us stuck in jobs that do not align with our superhero skills and strengths. Where we are barely surviving the grind day after day, not living our greatness. Wouldn’t it be awesome to figure out what our true strengths are and lean into them? My surprise is not a massive one. But a very meaningful one. It will take place on 21 November 2024 in Singapore. So save the date please. 🗓️ PS: to be the first to find out, please waitlist in a form below! #findyoursuperpower #savethedate #surprise #linkedincoach #linkedintopvoices\n\nEvery coach needs a coach 🙏 Hi, I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Juliana Chan, PhD, and I’m a LinkedIn coach from Singapore. I am the founder of Find Your Superpower 🚀community, and my mission is to help everyone discover the most empowered version of themselves. I believe that when we lean into our unique skills and strengths, we transform into superheroes—and unlock extreme value we didn’t even know we had. But I didn't get to where I am today with my own abilities and knowledge. I learnt from the experts at MIT when I was a scientist, and from the experts on LinkedIn as a content creator today. I stood on the shoulder of giants. And one of these giants is Chris Do, the Emmy award-winning designer and founder of The Futur, who gave a masterclass on Friday for my Six-Week LinkedIn bootcamp community and alumni. We discussed everything from branding to mindset, and I will be sharing more in my weekly Sunday newsletter tomorrow (have you signed up?). So yes, I may be a professional LinkedIn coach today, but I had been consuming Chris's generous content online for years, 99% of it free. Inviting Chris to coach my clients is the biggest compliment I can pay anyone. And completely well-deserved too. If you're a senior executive or business owner in a competitive industry, do you have a coach to help you unlock peak performance? I think it is time to find yourself one. It will be the best investment you make in yourself. You won't regret it! 🚀 #julianalinkedin #linkedincoach #linkedintips #linkedintopvoices #chrisdo #thefutur #findyoursuperpower #coaching #mindset #branding #bootcamp\n\nBefore I had LinkedIn clients there was Kishore Mahbubani 🌟 Everyone starts somewhere. This is a story about two people learning something new for the first time. Let's travel back in time to 2021, shall we? There was an academic-turned-entrepreneur called Juliana Chan, PhD, who had been posting on LinkedIn for approximately 12 months and had just been made a LinkedIn Top Voice. She had no track record of helping anyone succeed on LinkedIn. There was a veteran Singaporean diplomat Professor Kishore Mahbubani, who had a global fan base but a dormant LinkedIn account that was not set up for success. He had around 1K connections on LinkedIn. Juliana took a look at Kishore's LinkedIn account and said, \"Would you let me experiment on your LinkedIn account?\" Kishore gamely said, \"Yes, please go ahead.\" After some fixing and sprucing, his account was ready to go. Over time, as Kishore posted to his LinkedIn account, very quickly his following grew from 1K to 38K, far surpassing his Facebook follower count. Today, everyone is able to enjoy his interviews with Bloomberg, Asia Society and FT with ease. Many of you follow my LinkedIn account because I regularly discuss growth mindset, lifelong learning and professional development. Prof Kishore learnt how to use LinkedIn at the age of 75. 🌱 — So today, I have written an ode to Prof Kishore Mahbubani: 😊 Prof Kishore, when I am a Septuagenarian someday, I want to be learning new social media platforms and writing best-selling books, just like you. Congrats on the launch of your autobiography, \"Living the Asian Century: An Undiplomatic Memoir\" yesterday evening, which has since skyrocketed to number one on the Amazon best-seller list. Your superpowers, in my opinion, are lifelong learning and an indefatigable spirit. When I grow up, I want to be just like you! 🌟 #julianalinkedin #linkedincoach #linkedintopvoices #kishoremahbubani #booklaunch #findyoursuperpower\n\nHi LinkedIn, would you like to try something new with me? 💡 A tiny little experiment. If you've been stuck in a rut for some time, with the same loop playing in your head, let's do some spring cleaning up there, shall we? I want to show you a morning mantra that I've adopted for myself, after enjoying a book by Gabrielle Bernstein on the topic. For those among us curious to understand what a mantra is, a mantra replaces 100s of different thoughts with one single clear thought. By collecting our scattered attention and focusing it into one powerful stream, we define our goals clearly and set the stage for what we want to achieve today. Just to clarify, this is NOT a prayer. 🚨 Think of it as a North Star, or a mission statement. You could also think of this as an encouraging pep talk every morning. Are you ready? Let's go! --- My Morning Mantra: My body is rested and my mind is clear. I begin the day with a positive mindset. I am receptive to new ideas, collaborators and opportunities. Creative possibilities are open to me. I will attract what I want (and need) into my life today. I will connect with givers, smart people, kind people, people looking to learn and grow. I am supported by my colleagues and friends. I am taken care of. I choose joy. I choose to feel good. I give myself permission to have fun and say no to things that do not serve me or bring joy. I embrace what I cannot control. I release all outcomes and practice noninterference. I surrender. I take action with conviction and clarity. I bring joy to those I work with. Today is a great day. --- So there you go, my morning mantra! You could try it or create a customized mantra for yourself. If you've been stuck or filling your head with limiting beliefs, I think that any action---however small---could help to break the chokehold it has on you. Try (some version of) this for a few days and let me know if anything interesting happens to you! Think of this as our little experiment. Good luck! 😊 #julianalinkedin #mission #vision #northstar #mantra #morningmantra #hope #mindset #growthmindset #joy #fun #love #linkedintopvoices\n\nThere are days when client pitches that take weeks to prepare end up unsuccessful. There are days when HR matters are challenging to resolve, despite your best efforts to please everyone. There are days when you sleep at 3-4 am after dealing with 100s of work emails, kid scheduling and domestic management. There are days when your physical, emotional and mental health are sidelined to deliver your responsibilities as a CEO, manager, mentor, mother and woman. And there are days like this, when someone pats you on the back and says, \"Hey, you're not doing too bad as an entrepreneur, you're doing fine.\" 🙏 Thanks to my high school Victoria Junior College and the publication team of Fatma, Audrey and Aik Cher for including my reflections along with 39 Victorians in a publication to commemorate our school's 40th anniversary. So grateful to be in the company of greats, including the incredible comic artist and illustrator Sonny Liew, former Nominated Member of Parliament Janice Koh, and of course, our Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. 🇸🇬 To end with some of the reflections I penned: \"To current and future Victorians, I’d say try everything that interests you, from academics to extracurriculars. Stay curious and follow your passion.. but don’t forget self-care and balance during those crazy two years.\" \"Finally, always stay true to the Victorian motto of Nil Sine Labore, as nothing was ever achieved without labour, self-belief and a strong North Star.\" ✨ What a walk down memory lane. This was 24 years ago! Nothing without labour! 🚀 🚨 To all of my friends from VJC, thank you for being a part of my formative journey over those two intense years. I have lost touch with many of you and so if you read this, please DM me to reconnect. Please know that I treasure our shared memories very much. #julianalinkedin #vjc #nilsinelabore #victoriajuniorcollege #singapore #linkedintopvoices #gratitude #thankyou #happy #memories\n\nObserve the law of reciprocity on LinkedIn 🙏 Whenever I post a viral post that gets more than 100K impressions, I will pick up 500-1000 followers in a matter of hours. Some of them will venture out to press the three dots and choose \"Connect\" instead. 🚨 In case you aren't aware about this, there's a connection limit on LinkedIn. LinkedIn members can only have a maximum of 30,000 first-degree connections, and I am very deep in the 20K zone, and so I will max out by the end of this year if I am not careful. And when you have a large sample size of connection requests per day, you can discover a lot of data. Like how few people include a note with their connection request. As Darth Vader would say: \"The curse of knowledge is strong with this one.\" ---- What is the curse of knowledge on LinkedIn? 🤔 Popularized by Harvard professor and cognitive psycholinguist Steven Pinker, the curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, while communicating with others, assumes that others have information that only they know. We know that we are high-value, high-quality individuals worth connecting with. We assume everyone also knows that, and will surely agree to connect with us. Duh. But scrolling through 100s of connection requests, I realize don’t know anything about any of them. Plus I literally can't accept any more connection requests. I procrastinate and say I'll look at it tomorrow. 😢 Until.... Every 50-60 requests or so, someone comes along and writes the sweetest and most genuine of messages, indicating one or more things: 🙏 How much they enjoy reading my posts 🙏 How they think we have a lot in common 🙏 Ideas for how we can work together on a cool project After 100s of random faces, a connection request with an authentic message is like a breath of fresh air. A Shangri-La in the desert. An oasis in a parched barren land. A small flame in the darkest and coldest artic. And it doesn't matter how far away you live from Singapore, or whether you have a completely divergent background or professional industry to mine.... I connect with you. 🙏 Why? Because I believe that you're a thoughtful, self-aware, emotionally intelligent human being. And I feel a bond of reciprocity and connection with you. I want to get to know you better. I want to be your friend. PS: Let's activate the law of reciprocity on LinkedIn, my friend! 🚀 #linkedincoach #linkedintrainer #linkedintips #linkedintopvoices #lawofreciprocity #empathy #reciprocity"
