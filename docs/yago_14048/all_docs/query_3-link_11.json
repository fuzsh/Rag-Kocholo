        "text": "Hong Kong actor and action choreographer\n\nChin Ka-lok, sometimes credited as Chin Kar-lok (Chinese: 錢嘉樂, Pinyin: Qián Jiālè, born 6 August 1965), is a Hong Kong actor, action choreographer, and television presenter.\n\nChin was born in Hong Kong, the younger brother of actor and stunt performer Chin Siu Ho. He is a former member of Sammo Hung's stunt team. Chin began working as a stuntman at the age of 16.\n\nIn 1985, he made his film debut in Sammo Hung's Heart of Dragon as one of Jackie Chan's SWAT Team buddies. In 1988, Chin replaced his brother Siu Ho in the 4th installment of Mr. Vampire. After starring in The Green Hornet and Drunken Master II in 1994, he began doing non-action roles alongside action roles. In 1995, he played a demon destroyer/centipede demon/scholar in Journey to the West. In 1997, he directed his only film, 97 Aces Go Places.\n\nAside from films, he is the co-host of The Super Trio Show, a Hong Kong variety show, along with Jerry Lamb and Eric Tsang.\n\nAs a fan of cars and racing, he starred in a comedic short as a street racer/drifter.[1] However, when he took part in a 2005 TVB telethon, he performed donuts in the same 350Z as seen in the film with Lee San San standing in the center as a cone. Then in 2003 he starred the film Star Runner as \"Senior Ho\", a veteran fighter for the team Kong Ching.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\n[2] [3]\n\nTVB series\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role TVB Anniversary Awards Notes 1993 The Legendary Ranger\n\n原振俠 Mo Ming\n\n莫名 1995 The Romantic Swordsman\n\n小李飛刀 Ah-fei\n\n阿飛 1996 The Hitman Chronicles\n\n大刺客 了因 Journey to the West\n\n西遊記 蜈蚣精 1997 Detective Investigation Files III\n\n刑事偵緝檔案III Cho Heung Tung\n\n曹向東 1998 Burning Flame\n\n烈火雄心 Ng Dai Heng\n\n吳大興 1999 A Matter of Business\n\n千里姻緣兜錯圈 樂文 Game of Deceit\n\n騙中傳奇 顧井 Dragon Love\n\n人龍傳說 Yip Chu / Chow Chu\n\n葉處 / 周處 2001 Gods of Honour\n\n封神榜 Yeung Jin\n\n楊戩 2002 Let's Face It\n\n無考不成冤家 Au Yeung Sau Yip\n\n歐陽守業 Good Against Evil\n\n點指賊賊賊捉賊 Chan Giem Fung\n\n練劍鋒 2003 Hearts of Fencing\n\n當四葉草碰上劍尖時 Yu Chi Wai\n\n余志偉 Life Begins at Forty\n\n花樣中年 Chan Bing Gei\n\n陳炳基 2005 The Academy\n\n學警雄心 Kook Ming Cheung\n\n曲明昌 2007 The Drive of Life\n\n歲月風雲 Chan Ka Lok\n\n陳嘉樂 guest (ep33-35) On the First Beat\n\n學警出更 Kook Ming Cheung\n\n曲明昌 2009 A Bride for a Ride\n\n王老虎搶親 Wong Lo Fu\n\n王老虎 Nominated - Best Actor (Top 15)\n\nNominated - My Favourite Male Character (Top 15) 2011 Only You\n\nOnly You 只有您 Lau Siu Long\n\n劉小龍 2012 Divas in Distress\n\n巴不得媽媽 Chong Ka-long\n\n莊嘉朗 2015 The Fixer\n\n拆局專家 Szeto Sam-ping\n\n司徒心平\n\nTVB Host\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title TVB Anniversary Awards 1995–1996 Movie Buff Championship\n\n超級無敵獎門人 1997 Movie Buff Championship Series 2\n\n超級無敵獎門人之再戰江湖 1998–1999 The Super Trio Show\n\n天下無敵獎門人 Won - My Favourite On-Screen Partners (Non-Dramas) 1999 The Super Trio Mega Show\n\n驚天動地獎門人 Won - My Favourite On-Screen Partners (Non-Dramas) 2000–2001 The Super Trio Show Series 2\n\n宇宙無敵獎門人 Won - My Favourite On-Screen Partners (Non-Dramas) 2002 A Trio Delights\n\n吾係獎門人 2004–2005 The Super Trio Continues\n\n繼續無敵獎門人 Won - My Favourite On-Screen Partners (Non-Dramas) 2008–2009 Super Trio Supreme\n\n鐵甲無敵獎門人 Won - Best Presenter\n\nNominated - Best Variety Show (Top 10) Tips For Home Decoration Series 4\n\n宜室宜居有辦法 2009 Club Sparkle\n\n星星同學會 Won - Best Variety Show\n\nNominated - Best Presenter (Top 5) 2010 Super Trio Game Master\n\n超級遊戲獎門人 Nominated - Best Host (Top 5)\n\nNominated - Best Variety Show (Top 5) Tips For Home Decoration Series 5\n\n宜室宜居有辦法 2013 Super Trio Maximus\n\n超級無敵獎門人終極篇 2016 I Heart HK\n\n我愛香港\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n錢嘉莊 - 錢嘉樂網站 Website of Chin Ka Lok\n\nChin Ka-lok at IMDb\n\nChin Ka-lok on Weibo (in Chinese)\n\nChin Ka-lok at the Hong Kong Movie Database\n\nChin Ka-lok at AllMovie"
