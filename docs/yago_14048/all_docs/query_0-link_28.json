We conceive digital platforms as a collection of digital resources that facilitate value creating and capturing interactions between producers and consumers of services and products. For this reason, we take an encompassing view of digital platforms in that they could range from app marketplaces like the Apple App Store and OpenAI’s GPT Store to crowd platforms like Kaggle and Kickstarter, sharing economy platforms like Airbnb and Grab, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, as well as gig work platforms for food delivery, micro tasking, ride sharing. Although these digital platforms are to a certain extent global in their technical infrastructures, they tend to be localized in their economic and socio-cultural propositions, governance and organizing processes, as well as value creation and capturing opportunities. We are particularly interested in how these digital platforms influence community structures, social dynamics, and global economic trends given the diversity of value appropriability practices and regimes across the globe. Research analysing how digital platforms create socio-economic value, drive innovation strategies, revolutionize governance and organising processes, shape user behaviours, and/or the establishment of inclusive and sustainable digital platform ecosystems in different parts of the world would be a fit with the track. Additionally, we seek contributions that address broader challenges and future trends in the field of information systems. This covers a wide array of topics such as the cybersecurity, data privacy, digital divide, digital wellbeing, regulation into artificial intelligence, remote work, and the dominance of big tech actors. We especially welcome papers that focus on contextualized investigations of the above topics that focuses on emerging economies, for example, those in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nCommunal and societal value creation through digital platforms, with a particular emphasis on, but not limited to, emerging economies\n\nTensions between value creation and value capture on digital platforms for emerging economies\n\nDatafication and data work\n\nData strategies for competitive advantage and fair treatment on digital platforms\n\nEffects of platform governance and control mechanisms on user behaviours and outcomes\n\nHumanistic and instrumental outcomes for digital platform stakeholders (e.g., content generators and consumers, gig workers, and users)\n\nImplication of generative Artificial Intelligence for digital platforms\n\nIncentives, impact, and/or trade-offs of antitrust and data regulation on digital platform ecosystem dynamics\n\nInnovation strategies and user behaviours on digital platforms\n\nAssociate Editors:\n\nJonas Andersen, ITU, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nPratyush Bharati, University of Massachusetts Boston, United States\n\nCarla Bonina, University of Surrey, United Kingdom\n\nJingcun Cao, University of Hong Kong, China (Hong Kong)\n\nCalvin Chan, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Singapore\n\nNicolai Fabian , University of Groningen, Netherlands\n\nMengyao Fu, City University of Hong Kong, China (Hong Kong)\n\nFangfang Hou, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China\n\nNa Jiang, Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University United International College, China\n\nOne-Ki Daniel Lee, University of Massachusetts Boston, United States\n\nZhanfei Lei, University of Massachusetts Amherst, United States\n\nBoying Li, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, China\n\nEric Lim, UNSW Sydney, Australia\n\nChristian Libaque Saenz, Universidad del Pacífico, Peru\n\nMarta Stelmaszak, Portland State University, United States\n\nNing Su, Western University, Canada\n\nJanina Sundermeier, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany\n\nBingqing Xiong, Deakin University, Australia\n\nJianhua Yu, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China (Hong Kong)\n\nGeneral IS Topics\n\nTrack Title:\n\nGeneral IS Topics\n\nTrack Chairs:\n\nClaudia Loebbecke\n\nUniversity of Cologne\n\nclaudia.loebbecke@uni-koeln.de\n\nSince 2000, Claudia Loebbecke holds the Chair of Media and Technology Management at the University of Cologne. 2005-2006, she was President of the Association for Information Systems (AIS), which named her AIS Fellow in 2012, and a Distinguished Member cum laude in 2019.

As organizations increasingly digitalize work, the established structure and norms of office work routines are disappearing. The nature of work is fundamentally changing as employment arrangements are increasingly contingent, mobile and flexible. Exemplars of contemporary work structures include remote and nomadic work, the 4-day workweek, globally distributed project work, crowdsourcing, and on-demand freelance work brokered through dedicated platforms.\n\nThe automation and augmentation of work with artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and blockchain are transforming organizations, industries, and labor markets as humans are replaced by, or working with, ever more intelligent algorithms and robots. Workers are concerned that whole classes of jobs and occupations may become obsolete while demand for other occupations grow at an increasing rate. Workers will need to adapt their skill portfolios to remain employable and optimize their careers. At the same time, the meaning of work and employment is shifting as digital natives become a dominant force throughout modern organizations and contribute to redefining the future of work.\n\nWe welcome submissions that take a broad perspective addressing digital technologies and the future of work.

However, if not approached with social consciousness, the pervasiveness and emphasis on digitalization may have unintended negative consequences for its societal impact. On the one hand, digital transformation efforts can enable a more sustainable society, such as the rise of smart cities or circular economies. On the other hand, digitalization may be inaccessible to certain communities and may further exclude institutionally marginalized communities and individuals globally and also has unexpected influence on human dignity. Furthermore, decision-making systems that leverage aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) continue to usher in biased outcomes. Given the complexity and velocity of digitalization, our understanding of its social impact often lags behind its introduction and widespread use.\n\nThe Information Systems community is in a unique position to uncover and shed light on the effects digitalization and various applications of information technologies have on our society. This track calls for papers that investigate both the intended and unintended societal impacts of information systems. Studies in this track go a long way to inform regulators, practitioners, users, and researchers from other disciplines.

Inherent vulnerabilities in these technologies, insufficient safeguard mechanisms, and human errors are often to blame for security breaches. Defenders are thus thrust into the front lines, tasked with securing their infrastructures against the backdrop of emerging technological challenges. These challenges are multifaceted, encompassing the adaptation to evolving regulations, the refinement of organizational best practices, and the responses to the intricate issues of behavioral and privacy concerns.\n\nIn the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the rapid digital shift has escalated cybersecurity challenges for organizations. The development of digital infrastructures, essential for remote work, has opened further loopholes for cybercriminal incursions. Additionally, the advent of digital innovation and transformation projects has heightened the risks associated with cybersecurity and user privacy. Against this backdrop, companies are increasingly confronted with the formidable task of navigating between advancing data analytics projects and upholding comprehensive security and privacy safeguards.\n\nFurther, as the modern economy is increasingly dependent on user data generated or supplied explicitly by the users or collected covertly by organizations, privacy remains an important topic on the research and policy agenda. The mixed scientific evidence on the impact of privacy concerns on users’ behavior calls for comprehensive investigations into the multifaceted nature of privacy. For example, recently the saliency of the role of privacy uncertainty in users’ decisions has been demonstrated. It is still to be understood what value users attach to their privacy and what it depends on.\n\nThis track aims to encourage cutting edge research that focuses on topics in cybersecurity and privacy (either jointly or separately). A goal is to facilitate timely debates on the application of theories and methods that broaden and deepen our understanding of the newly emerging phenomena and classical problems in these areas (cybersecurity and privacy). All types of methods (qualitative, quantitative, analytical, and computational methods) for examining cybersecurity and privacy phenomena are welcome.\n\nThe Information Systems community is in a unique position to uncover and shed light on the effects digitalization and various applications of information technologies have on our society.

Since gaining momentum with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, blockchains provide a secure, transparent, decentralized infrastructure for building trustless systems without third-party intermediaries. In the 15 years since Bitcoin launched, blockchain has found use cases across industries, including supply chain, logistics, global trade, healthcare, energy, and more. Industry adoption stayed, however, below expectations.\n\nUnder the term “Decentralised Finance” (DeFi), blockchain and DLT are also a central element of today’s FinTech innovation ecosystem. Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) are expected to unlock new business models, market efficiencies, and value-creation opportunities. By replacing legacy databases and workflows with shared ledgers, smart contracts, and decentralized applications might enable frictionless peer-to-peer transactions, automation, and data integrity. The programmability of blockchain allows the encoding of complex business logic and protocols into trusted systems.\n\nAs blockchain matures and integrates into core business processes, its potential to transform organizational structures, incentives, and governance grows. Leading companies across sectors are exploring blockchain systems to reduce costs, mitigate risks, increase transparency, and enable new offerings.\n\nHowever, key challenges around scalability, interoperability, regulation, governance and adoption remain before decentralized systems can unleash widespread transformation. To fulfill this vision, rigorous research is needed to guide blockchain’s integration into business operations, economic structures, and next-generation technologies. Effective governance frameworks, sustainable technology stacks, and inclusive institutional designs are critical to unlocking blockchain’s capabilities at scale. Furthermore, technological and governance innovations have continuously introduced new developments challenging status quo systems. For example, innovations like algorithmic stablecoins, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and adjacent technologies like Digital Identities (DIDs) or Zero-Knowledge-Proofs (ZKP) aim to optimize financial operations.\n\nWhile DLT has received significant attention in fintech research, we also welcome submissions exploring innovations built on alternative technologies. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are transforming finance, enabling deeper insights into markets, risks, and customer behavior. Financial institutions are leveraging AI algorithms for automated trading, portfolio optimization, predictive analytics, and conversational agents to enhance client interactions. At the same time, banks and financial service providers face pressures to demonstrate regulatory compliance and corporate responsibility for sustainability. Technologies like cloud computing and application programming interfaces (APIs) are being used to improve transparency, accountability, and environmental/social disclosures. The integration of finance with mobile devices, social platforms, and other emerging technologies also presents new research opportunities.\n\nWe welcome research using any established research approach, e.g., theory development, case studies, experiments, surveys, simulation, or design research. While we are open to literature reviews, we would like to see a clear contribution beyond the typical introduction to a research field typically presented in a PhD thesis. Case studies should move beyond description to some theoretical implication, and design research should include an evaluation of the artifact.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nFintech Innovation: Explore advancements like robo-advisory, fraud detection, social trading, credit scoring, algorithmic trading, mobile payment technologies, and other business innovations.\n\nFintech and DLT Applications: Explore the design of innovative applications within the realms of fintech and DLT, including the application of DLT in traditional financial services.\n\nMacroeconomic Implications of Fintech: Examine the macroeconomic effects, such as the disintermediation of established players, the influence of cryptocurrencies, and structural changes in the economy.\n\nOrganizational and Business Model Transformation: Delve into the organizational and business model changes driven by fintech, including the digital transformation of banks, adoption, and innovation with cryptocurrencies, DLT, and blockchain technologies.\n\nLeveraging New Data in Financial Markets: Address ethical concerns, data-driven business models, fraud detection, regulation, practical feasibility, and smart trading strategies, including artificial intelligence-driven practices.\n\nTransformation to Token Economy: Investigate issues and opportunities in the shift from platforms to token economies, including regulatory frameworks, challenges in fintech regulation, (de)centralization, mining hardware commoditization, governance mechanisms, and impacts of tokenized invoices.\n\nBlockchain for Social Innovation: Investigate collective intelligence and action in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), increasing financial inclusion, addressing collective threats through smart contracts, and collective value creation through blockchain governance.\n\nBlockchain Innovation: Explore blockchain’s role in the metaverse and AI-enabled commerce.\n\nManagement and Organization in Blockchain, DLT, and Cryptocurrencies: Investigate asset management with blockchain-based tokenization, distributed and decentralized organization, coordination, and governance.

This track invites cutting-edge research that addresses issues relating to these topics.\n\nThe sharing economy has disrupted conventional socio-economic activities by allowing individuals to exchange underutilized assets or resources for monetary gains at very low transactional costs. Under this broad umbrella, sharing can stem from user-owned assets, as exemplified on Airbnb, Didi, Grab, and Uber, or take place through the renting of company-owned resources, as epitomized on Bird, CitiBike, Lime, and Zipcar.\n\nFueling the explosion of the sharing economy are multi-sided platforms which, by connecting various actors throughout the world for little marginal cost, facilitate interactions and transactions in a seamless fashion across a variety of contexts: dating, entertainment, education, finance, hospitality, housing, product reviews, and transportation, to name a few. These multi-sided platforms have revolutionized industries, for better and for worse, with both promising and disappointing socio-economic impacts being documented.\n\nLikewise, many of these emerging business models would not have been possible without the growing societal transition into distributed modes of innovation and production, e.g., in the context of mobile apps, that leverage the capability of digital platforms and technological infrastructures to orchestrate the coordination of distributed and heterogeneous individuals and organizations toward achieving a wide range of socio-economic objectives.\n\nWe welcome papers that examine questions relating to the above topics from diverse perspectives, which include but are not limited to different theoretical orientations, methodological approaches, and levels of analysis. We encourage work that crosses disciplinary boundaries and provides us with fresh insights into the future of the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nNew theoretical perspectives for understanding the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nNovel methodological approaches for researching the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nExternal vs. internal enterprise deployment of multi-sided platforms for facilitating crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nPlatform-enabled business models underlying the sharing economy, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nDiversity, ethics, and inclusivity in the sharing economy\n\nReputation and trust in the sharing economy and digital platforms\n\nEntrepreneurship in platform-driven, crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nEconomic, ecological, legal, regulatory, geo-political, social, and technological implications of the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowds\n\nSharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based modes of innovation and production in highly regulated industries, such as health care or education\n\nDigital labor markets\n\nCrowdsourcing and crowdfunding\n\nDeployment of AI on multi-sided platforms for facilitating crowd-based modes of innovation and production\n\nData platforms and data spaces\n\nDesign of platforms for efficiency, fairness, and inclusivity\n\nIndividual decision-making in the sharing economy, multi-sided platforms, and crowd-based models\n\nDecentralized digital ecosystems\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nSoo Hyun Cho, Rutgers University, USA\n\nDonato Cutolo, IE Business School, Spain\n\nMark de Reuver, TU Delft, Netherlands\n\nZhao Du, Beijing Sport University, China\n\nMeilin Gu, School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, China\n\nAndreas Hein, University of St. Gallen, Switzerland\n\nLele Kang, Nanjing University, China\n\nWarut Khernamnui, McGill University, Canada\n\nTobias Kretschmer, LMU Munich, Germany\n\nChen Liang, University of Connecticut, USA\n\nYang Liu, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKSAR\n\nYang Liu, Tsinghua University, China\n\nAngela Lu, City University of Hong Kong, HKSAR\n\nJifeng Luo, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China\n\nMareike Möhlmann, Bentley University, USA\n\nGorkem Turgut (G.T.)

Digital innovations rooted in mobile and distributed computing, social media, digital platforms, data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchains, Internet of Things, cloud computing, virtual reality, and robots are reshaping and disrupting established ways of business operations. Digital innovations generate new possibilities for innovation and entrepreneurship in a wide range of domains including healthcare, education, retail, finance, and manufacturing industries. Indeed, organizations must innovate continuously in order to thrive.\n\nDigital innovation, entrepreneurship and transformation are ubiquitous. Work is increasingly being virtualized, digitalized, or even completely automated. New platform-based forms of digital organizing have emerged. Innovation processes themselves are becoming more open, less predictable, and more fluid.\n\nOur track invites researchers to re-evaluate traditional assumptions and create new theories and methods about how digital technologies shape, change, or even upend knowledge about processes and outcomes of innovation, entrepreneurship, and new business models.\n\nThe IS research community is uniquely positioned to address these issues, for at least two reasons. First, the information systems field emphasizes knowledge that attends to socio-technical organizing. Second, the information systems field is inherently interdisciplinary, covering behavioral, organizational, economic, and technical aspects of information and communication technologies.\n\nThese research challenges require the joint effort of scholars with an interest in the role of digital technology, be they from fields of information systems research, management science, organizational studies, innovation management, entrepreneurship or other disciplines.

Its broad reach extends from facilitating personal interactions to shaping the global flows of information among organizations and nations. Impacting individuals, social media is often a primary source of news, a platform for establishing and maintaining personal networks, and a tool for managing identity and building reputation. For organizations, social media can serve as a means to engage with customers, a channel for shaping brand image, a valuable source of information for business decisions, and an avenue for influence on a global scale. On the societal level, social media can help coordinating social movements, understanding needs and preferences, providing services, and promoting social and political values. Social media has also had unintended consequences including the growing skepticism about traditionally accepted information sources, amplification of hate speech and other forms of cyberbullying, cybercrime, harvesting of personal data, and the emergence of filter bubbles.\n\nWith recent pandemic events, digital collaboration has become even more prominent. Digital tools and platforms have become crucial means for facilitating collaboration in small groups and large-scale collectives. Digital collaboration takes many forms in a wide range of domains including open innovation, crowd work, distributed and hybrid teams, knowledge sharing communities, human-machine collaboration, and work-from-home (WFH) schemes. Evolving technologies, such as intelligent assistance systems, digital platforms, or AI agents as collaborators, facilitate greater participation in the exchange and integration of knowledge and resources. However, they also raise questions about fairness, effectiveness, ownership of intellectual property, overload, and suboptimal collaboration dynamics.\n\nOne fast evolving technology in the past year, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has shown a great potential to impact digital collaboration. The rapid advancement of generative AI signifies a shift from AI as a mere tool to AI as a teammate, enhancing human capabilities in complex tasks. With its power to produce various types of content, including text, images, audio, code, and other data, generative AI has been adopted in workplaces very quickly. Yet, our understanding of its impact on collaborations, especially human-machine collaboration, is at its beginning stage. How to use generative AI to assist and augment human abilities while avoiding misuse and risks have emerged as an important area of research inquiry in digital collaboration.\n\nWe invite submissions that explore new areas, advance new insights, develop new methods, or challenge established points of view on social media phenomena and/or digital collaboration. The track is open to empirical, methodological, and conceptual research employing diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives and paradigms.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nUnderstanding the value and impact of using social media\n\nCollaboration spanning online and offline interactions\n\nInteractions (or lack of), competition or collaboration between social media groups\n\nIntra-and-inter-enterprise use of social media or digital collaborations\n\nPromoting resilience and integration of work-from-home into organizations\n\nInfluence of social media and digital collaborations on changing nature of work\n\nDigital collaboration practices within and across organizations and in society\n\nNovel theories about social media or digital collaboration and its effects on individuals, organizations, and/or societies\n\nNovel designs of social media or digital collaboration to encourage information diffusion, knowledge sharing, and/or better collaboration dynamics\n\nNovel qualitative or quantitative methods of assessing social media or digital collaboration\n\nNew method development (e.g., econometric or data-science methods) to study and better harness the business potential of social media or digital collaboration\n\nReputation and trust in social media or digital collaboration\n\nNegative aspects of social media or digital collaboration, and their mitigation strategies, methods, or designs\n\nUse of social media or digital collaboration to combat environmental crises\n\nAI-enhanced collaboration processes and human-AI (machine) collaboration\n\nThe collaboration of AI-based systems with social media users (e.g., identifying fake news with ML, delivering facts in echo chambers with conversational agents or social bots)\n\nAssociate Editors\n\nSuchit Ahuja, Concordia University, Canada\n\nReza Alibakhshi, IE Business School, Spain\n\nEva Bittner Bittner, University of Hamburg, D\n\nShalini Chandra, SP Jain School of Global Management , Dubai/Singapore/Australia\n\nYi-Te Chui, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan\n\nSunghun Chung, George Washington University, USA\n\nJocelyn Cranefield, Victoria University of Wellington, NZ\n\nWenging (Wendy) Duan, George Washington University, USA\n\nEster Gonzalez, California State University, Fullterton, USA\n\nGaurav Gupta, NEOMA Business School, France\n\nJanine Hacker, University of Liechtenstein, Liechtenstein\n\nElina Hwang, University of Washington, USA\n\nStan Karanasios, University of Queensland, AUS\n\nHaris Krijestorac, HEC Paris, France\n\nSherah , Kurnia, University of Melbourne, AUS\n\nHarris Kyriakou, ESSEC Business School, France\n\nMichael Leyer, Queensland University of Technology, AUS\n\nJulian Marx, University of Melbourne, AUS\n\nTom Mattson, University of Richmond, USA\n\nPoonacha Medappa, Tilburg University, Netherlands\n\nRohit Ni"
