        "text": "Born to immigrants in New York City, Lucy Liu has always tried to balance an interest in her cultural heritage with a desire to move beyond a strictly Asian-American experience. Her mother, Cecilia, a biochemist, is from Beijing & her father, Tom Liu, a civil engineer, is from Shanghai. Once relegated to \"ethnic\" parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady.\n\nShe graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 & enrolled in NYU. However, she was discouraged by the dark and sarcastic atmosphere, so she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated w/ a degree in Asian Languages & Cultures, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts & acting. During her senior year, she auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead. Encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to L.A., splitting her time between auditions & food service day jobs. She eventually scored a guest appearance as a waitress on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like New York Cops: NYPD Blue (1993), Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994) & Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman's ephemeral sitcom Eine Hausfrau zum Knutschen (1996).\n\nShe first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in Jerry Maguire: Spiel des Lebens (1996) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie Bang (1995), but it was shelved for 2 years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on Ally McBeal (1997). She initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to Portia de Rossi. However, writer-producer David E. Kelley was so impressed w/ her that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which she filled w/ such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member.\n\nThe \"Ally\" win gave her film career a much-needed boost-in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the Mel Gibson action flick Payback - Zahltag (1999) & as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga Knocked Out - Eine schlagkräftige Freundschaft (1999). The following year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Jackie Chan's western Shang-High Noon (2000), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in 3 Engel für Charlie (2000).\n\nWhen she's not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, she keeps busy w/ an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses &plays the accordion. In 1993, she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study & create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn't leave much time for romantic intrigue, but she says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered.\n\nCynthia Rothrock is a martial arts expert and athlete, who went on to become a film actress, starring in a number of highly successful martial arts action movies. She first made a name as an action actress in Hong Kong before going on to wow audiences in her home turf. At the time of her popularity, she was well-known as the \"Queen of Martial Arts films\".\n\nCynthia Rothrock is the World Champion in martial arts Forms and Weapons (1981-1985). Her goal was to be undefeated and retire after five years. With over 100 competitions, she holds the undefeated worldwide record in martial arts Forms competition. In weapons competition, Cynthia is the first and only woman to win number one in North America against the men-at that time, women had to compete with the men. She holds five Black Belts with a rank of 8th Dan Grandmaster.\n\nUpon completing her goal of being undefeated in competition, she began her martial arts acting career starring in movies produced and filmed in Hong Kong. Her first movie, Yes, Madam alongside Michelle Yeoh, broke box office records making her a massive star in Hong Kong. After three years of living in Hong Kong, finishing seven films, she returned to the United States to continue her acting career. Today she has starred in over 60 movies.\n\nRothrock has been a role model for women in martial arts and film. She made history by becoming the inaugural woman to grace the cover of Karate Illustrated (August 1981) and holds the distinction of being the first woman featured on the cover three times in the magazine's history.\n\nIn March 2024, Black Belt Magazine named Rothrock number one in its list of \"The Most Influential Women Martial Artists on the Planet.\". Rothrock is a proud inductee into the prestigious Black Belt Hall of Fame, along with Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris. In 2016 she was the first martial artist (male or female) to be inducted into the prestigious International Sports Hall of Fame by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dr. Robert Goldman.\n\nKaren Sheperd is an American actress with numerous credits in film, television and theatre. Her fascination with acting began in high school where she appeared on stage in various plays. Sheperd Is also a World-Class #1 Champion Martial Artist and is in the Black Belt Hall of Fame, alongside icons such as Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Chuck Norris.\n\nSheperd's Martial Arts Celebrity status springboard her into Hollywood and acting studies.

A trailblazing pioneer, Karen broke barriers and became the first female Champion to be rated #1 in the only ratings system at the time, \"Karate Illustrated\" magazine (1979 & 1980.) In 1979, at the request of \"Karate Illustrated's\" editor (Renardo Barden,) Sheperd embarked on what would be an historical and successful campaign to establish official ratings for women when none existed so that more women would compete. The number of women training and competing in 1979 was 10% (Black Belt Magazine). During Karens #1 reign and after, she witnessed the numbers rise to 50% because of her campaign. Inside Kung Fu's\" \"Star\" ratings for women began in 1980, Karen garnering that #1 title as well.\n\nKaren Sheperd was one of the first women to appear on the covers of major Martial Arts magazines such as \"Black Belt\", \"Inside Karate\", \"KICK\", and many more.\n\nBesides acting, Karen has lent her expertise as a fight-choreographer to various film, television and stage productions, including live-action projects at Disneyland, CA.\n\nKaren has been happily married to the same man since 1993, loves animals, has always had numerous rescue cats and dogs, actively serves her church community and still pursues acting.\n\nDaughter of a Chinese woman, who spent her childhood in Nishi Ku (Fukuoka City).

During her attendance in the Nippon College of Health and Physical Education for women, where she studied physical education, she saw the film \"Young Master\" (1980), directed and starring Sing Lung, and decided enrolling JAC (Japan Action Club) to become a stuntwoman. She finally changed her name to \"Oshima\" and debuted in the TV series \"Super Electron Bio-Man\" in 1984. At that time one part of JAC, \"Asia Action\", became independent and based in Hong Kong and Yukari decided to leave Japan. Chinese director Hung Kam-Bo gave her a bit part in the martial arts film \"Shanghai Express\" in 1986 and thus she began a career in Hong Kong until 1994, when after more than 20 Chinese films and a divorce from star Cheng Ho-Nam she established herself in the Philippines and changed her name for the second time to \"Cynthia Luster\" (Sincere Raster). Here she would participate in more than 20 films.\n\nAngela Mao was born as Mao Ching Ying in 1950 as the third of eight children to a family of entertainers for the Peking Opera House. She had a successful career as a Chinesa Opera actress, where her flexibility and martial arts first developed. She was discovered by film producer Raymond Man-Wai Chow who made her a star. Then, she trained in hapkido, and felt attracted to the new kung fu style, on demand by Hong Kong producers. Her career, if not long, was impressive, as she was one of the first women to make that sort of break-through in the film industry, until then reserving the fights and acrobatics to men. She played Bruce Lee's sister in Der Mann mit der Todeskralle (1973), and she also worked with Jackie Chan several times when he was a newcomer. In 1974, she fell in love and married Kelly Lai Chen. Their daughter Hsi Pui Sze was born in 1976. However, the couple divorced. She retired from films in 1983 and moved to America with her second husband when her son George King was born. She moved to Queens, New York in 1993 and eventually opened several Chinese restaurants that she runs with her son and daughter-in-law: Mama King, Nan Bei Ho, New Mei Hua, Guo Ba Inc. She usually declines interviews, because she wanted to lower her profile for the sake of her marriage. In 2008, she visited China to attend the wedding of her daughter, who had been raised by her first husband. In 2016, she gave a reluctant interview to the \"New York Times\" while feeding her baby granddaughter in one of her restaurants, with her son and daughter-in-law acting as her translators. She said that she still has fans who show up to her restaurants just to see her, but that fame was never as important as taking care of her family.\n\nRebekah Chaney made her directorial and writing debut with the critically-acclaimed short Waste Land, starring noted film actor and Academy Award nominee Ryan O'Neal.
