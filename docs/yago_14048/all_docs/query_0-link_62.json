        "text": "Life and career\n\nPan started out in Hong Kong and was involved in many movies and stage shows. But Pan did not truly become famous until she went to Taiwan and took up the role as lead actress in The Return of the Condor Heroes (ç¥éµ°ä¿ ä¾¶), The Empress of the Dynasty (ä¸ä»£å¥³ç), The Princess of the Dynasty (ä¸ä»£å ¬ä¸»). At the time Pan and Meng Fei (å­é£) were said by the Taiwan Television Circle to be the \"Perfect couple on the Screen\" due to their excellent performance in The Return of the Condor Heroes. The shows were viewed by over 60% of the population out of all the shows shown at the same time. Pan finished from Southern Experimental Theater Troupe.\n\nPan did a lot of shows with Taiwan's well-known television network China Television Company, Ltd., also known as CTV (ä¸­åé»è¦å ¬å¸), leading her to be called the \"Lovely Young Mistress of CTV (ä¸­è¦ç¶å®¶è±æ¦)\" (At the time there were only 3 channels in Taiwan, Taiwan Television (TTV), China Television (CTV) and Chinese Television System (CTS)). She is dubbed as the \"Queen of CTV\" because of all of her TV appearances were shown on CTV during the golden age of the 1980s and 90s.\n\nEven though Pan started out in the 1960s, she never revealed her true age. People have been unable to guess her age because she played a lot of young ladies' roles on the screen. Especially in The Empress of the Dynasty and \"Empress Da Yu Er\" (ä¸ä»£çåå¤§çå ) she played all the roles of the girl from childhood to old age; due to her impressive acting job these performances are considered to be her most critically acclaimed role. Also because of her ability to play a teenage girl's role over the years, she was given the nickname of \"Baby Doll\" or \"Doll\" (å¨å¨) or \"Ageless Legend\".[1] She was also the first actress rumored to have had cosmetic work done, due to her ageless look. She is said to be the Goldie Hawn of Asia due to their similarity of their ageless look."
