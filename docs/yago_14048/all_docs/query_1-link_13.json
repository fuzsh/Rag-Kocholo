        "text": "I joined the Molecular Biology Department at Genentech in 2004 as a scientist heading a core technology lab that provides microarray support for the entire company. My lab currently focuses on developing and providing a high-throughput methodology for profiling genomes and trascriptomes by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. We developed an automated high throughput NGS library generation process that enables the processing of hundreds of DNA/RNA samples. We also support many collaborative research projects focused on large scale cancer genomics. Our latest technology advancement is focused on single cell genomics where we perform highly parallel, genome-wide profiling of thousands of single cells to gain a better understanding of their biological diversity.\n\nPrior to Genentech, I held similar scientist positions and lead the technology development projects on microarrays and gene-based detection assays at Incyte Genomics and ID Biomedical, respectively."
