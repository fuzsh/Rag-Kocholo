        "text": "[ezcol_1fifth] [/ezcol_1fifth] [ezcol_3fifth]\n\nIs it going to be blue or purple, this wall, or perhaps, a minty green? Should I tile the bathroom, covering it in organized shines, or leaving it as is, a rustic plaster of diffused grey? Those clusters, years of emotional settlements that are solidified in actual physical forms, are bothering me, a lot, and I want to dump them all away and start over, as if it could work both ways. Did I mention these walls here where I stand, damn it, made of fucking concrete, are mockingly strong and defeating and apparently, impossible to drill through by whatever strength and tools I have left. What’s happened? I used to be able to drill through lots of things, now apparently, not anymore. Now I can only paint shit over. Maybe there’s nothing wrong with that, that it’s just life bitch, but the mirror that came to us from an obliviously happy time of my life from a wholesaler in Jersey City, broad, reflective and inescapable, is now helplessly laying against the ground, catching things ruthlessly from a low and unnatural angel, a woman standing with her head cut off. The mere wish to just to get it 3 feet up in perspective, to frame things, once again, rightly, seems now both realistically and psychologically, difficult. I have been dragging my own weight for months, defended no longer by excuses because they, if I had any, are peeling off by now like old paints, revealing the raw surface that has always been behind, staring at me only through a thin mask of pigments that I couldn’t even decide the color of. Perhaps the problem is not the color. Perhaps these walls, damn it these fucking walls… have something to say. And I gotta listen… listen bitch… before moving forward.\n\nBlue or purple, or perhaps, soon hopefully, a minty green?\n\nBEFORE YOU GUSH OUT UNGODLY THINGS LIKE “OMG, IT’S GLUTEN-FREE BREAD!”…\n\nSHUSH, IT’S NOT.\n\n[/ezcol_3fifth] [ezcol_1fifth_end] [/ezcol_1fifth_end]\n\n[ezcol_1quarter] [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_1quarter] [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_1quarter] [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_1quarter_end] [/ezcol_1quarter_end]\n\n[ezcol_1quarter] [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_1quarter] [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_1quarter] [/ezcol_1quarter] [ezcol_1quarter_end] [/ezcol_1quarter_end]\n\n[ezcol_1half] [/ezcol_1half] [ezcol_1half_end] [/ezcol_1half_end]\n\n[ezcol_1half] [/ezcol_1half] [ezcol_1half_end] [/ezcol_1half_end]\n\nJust because you were so nice listening to me rant:\n\nIf you had true, unapologetic love for squishy, sweet, and borderline childish white bread that dents like pillows, my friends, you’ll love this bread. I first discovered this bread in a Korean bakery in Beijing, then again from a bakery inside a supermarket in Hong Kong, both named – “rice bread”. Before you want to gush out ungodly things like “oh my god oh my god, gluten-free bread!”… shush, because it’s not. The word gluten-free and bread, as nature intended explicitly and I don’t know how on earth anyone could misunderstand, should not go together. This is not a mochi-bread either, or at least, not going to eat like one. This is simply a soft white bread recipe improved by the use of a roux made with sticky rice flour (which, yes, is the ingredient for mochi). The roux-method, as we know it, improves the moisture level of breads such as these, but instead of flour and water, the roux is made purely with sticky rice flour. To be exact, 24% of the total weight of flour is sticky rice flour, and 100% of the water goes into making the roux. This doesn’t only improves the moistness of the bread, but also gives it that specific chew, that perfect spot between elasticity and softness, and if you were a squishy bread-hunter your entire life like me, the unicorn. So thank you, and you’re welcome as well.\n\n[ezcol_1half]\n\n[/ezcol_1half] [ezcol_1half_end] [/ezcol_1half_end]"
