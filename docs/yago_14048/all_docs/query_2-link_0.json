        "text": "Hong Kong actress\n\nAngela Pan Yin-tze (born 5 June 1949), or Violet Pan Ying Zi, is a Hong Kong actress who starred in numerous films and soap operas in the 1970s–1980s.[1][2][3]\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nPan started her career in Hong Kong in films and stage shows. She became a celebrity after traveling to Taiwan and becoming the lead actress in The Return of the Condor Heroes (神鵰俠侶), The Empress of the Dynasty (一代女皇), and The Princess of the Dynasty (一代公主). The Taiwan Television Circle described Pan and her costar Meng Fei (孟飛) as the \"perfect couple on the screen.\" The shows were viewed by over 60% of the population.\n\nPan concluded her work with the Southern Experimental Theater Troupe and began working as an actress in shows through Taiwan's well-known television network China Television Company, Ltd., also known as CTV (中國電視公司). At the time, there were only three channels in Taiwan: Taiwan Television (TTV), China Television (CTV), and Chinese Television System (CTS). This led her to be dubbed the \"Lovely Young Mistress of CTV (中視當家花旦)\" and the \"Queen of CTV\" due to all of her television appearances being on CTV during the golden age of the 1980s and 90s.\n\nHer ability to portray characters from childhood to old age in critically acclaimed series such as \"The Empress of the Dynasty\" and \"Empress Da Yu Er\" (一代皇后大玉兒) has made it difficult for the public to determine her age. Pan's versatility in playing teenage girl roles throughout her career has earned her the nicknames \"Baby Doll,\" \"Doll,\" and \"Ageless Legend.\" She is also notable for being the first actress in the Chinese entertainment industry rumored to have undergone cosmetic surgery, and her seemingly ageless appearance has drawn comparisons to American actress Goldie Hawn.[4]\n\nPan is also well known for The Empress of the Dynasty, The Return of the Condor Heroes, Empress Da Yu Er (一代皇后大玉兒) and The Quarrels with Mother-in-Law (婆媳過招七十回), among other roles.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1972, Pan married actor Chan Hung-lit, with whom she co-starred with in many films. The couple divorced in 1980.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role 1963 Butterfly Lovers\n\n梁山伯與祝英台 1963\n\n七仙女 1966 Come Drink with Me / Big Drunk Hero\n\n大醉俠 1966 Heroic Three / The Magnificent Trio\n\n邊城三俠 1966 Princess Iron Fan\n\n鐵扇公主 1967\n\n獨臂刀 1967 Moon Night Cutter\n\n月夜斬 1967 Dragon Form Eight Swords\n\n龍形八劍 1967 Stock Market, Stock Market\n\n股票股票 1968 When the Clouds Roll By\n\n雲泥 1969 Runway Model / Torrent of Desire\n\n欲焰狂流 1970 Swordswomen Three\n\n江湖三女俠 1971 Intruder at White Lotus Temple\n\n大破白蓮教 1971\n\n玉面俠 Xie Xinchan 1975 Kissed by the Wolves\n\n狼吻 1983 New: The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple\n\n新火燒紅蓮寺 1983 Police Angel\n\n小姐當差 1985 Miss Mary Lee / Run Tiger Run\n\n兩隻老虎\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role 1983 One plus One does not equal Two\n\n一加一不等於二 Ten Ten-Ten 1984 Autumn Water Lovers\n\n秋水伊人 1984\n\n神鵰俠侶 Xiaolongnü 1985\n\n神州俠侶 Hsiao Yu-hsueh 1985 The Empress of the Dynasty\n\n一代女皇 Wu Zetian 1986 Princess of Dynasty\n\n一代公主 Wu Zetian and Princess Taiping 1986 Happy Home, All is well\n\n家和萬事興 Ah-shui 1987 Song Queen of the Age\n\n一代歌后 Zhou Xuan 1987\n\n靈山神箭 Pai Yu-hsuang 1988 Mama, Jili and Shao Ding-dong\n\n媽媽吉利小叮噹 Hua Wa-wa 1988 Diao Chan\n\n貂蟬 Diaochan 1990 Flame Bathing Phoenix\n\n浴火鳳凰 Consort Mei 1991\n\n婆媳過招七十回 Chen Fen-lan 1992 Empress Da Yu Er\n\n一代皇后大玉兒 Empress Xiaozhuangwen 1993 Super Lady Patrol\n\n超級女巡按 Fang Mei-chun (方美君) 1998 虯髯客與紅拂女 Hong Fu Nü 2001 寶斗里長 Shen Hsiu-feng 幾時再回頭 菟絲花 2018 Win the World Queen Dowager Huayang 2020 Ode to Daughter of Great Tang\n\n大唐女儿行 Consort Wan\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
