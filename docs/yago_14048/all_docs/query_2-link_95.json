But his being comfortable made me more comfortable with who I was...one of those \"out of the classroom\" lessons that remain invaluable. (10-24-12)\n\nSad news - John Williams, the highly popular and idiosyncratic history and social studies teacher and department head over a period of 30 years in Weston, died on October 19.

(9-29-12)\n\n1972 - Novelist Pamela Warren sends us her news: Just wanted to let my classmates know whatâ€™s going on with me. I spent the last two years writing two novels about a woman bluegrass mandolinist. The first novel, The Gift, was released on the Kindle this week under my name Pamela Warren and can be purchased through Amazon.com. I have publicized the book on several bluegrass websites and have been surprised at the positive response. I am planning on releasing this as a hard copy book in the near future and eventually on the Nook platform. I am in the process of formatting the sequel, The Sweetest Gift, which hopefully will be released on the Kindle sometime soon. The books are fiction, but draw on my experiences singing with my husbandâ€™s rock band in the 1980â€™s and my twenty years playing bluegrass mandolin. My classmate Alison Mork was kind enough to assist me with information on the club scene in Nashville during the 1980â€™s. Alison lived in Nashville during that period and has lots of interesting stories about her time there. I worked on the two books while I was recovering from a stroke and uterine cancer. It was helpful to have something positive to focus on during a difficult time. After the solitary process of writing the books over the last two years, itâ€™s fun getting some feedback on my creations. Best wishes to all my classmates.

(updated 8-23-12)\n\n1972 - My heart is broken as I write this, though I have known for a year this would become the case. My dear brother, John Guidi, class of 1972, died on 1-2-2012 after a year and a half battle with colon cancer. John was the kindest man, so true to his spirit and convictions. John was a mathematician by interest and by trade. His wife Allison, daughter Caroline and her family, our sisters Barbara (Westwood, class of 1981) and Kathy (Weston, class of 1974) and their families, my dad and stepmother, and I (Sharon Guidi Kretschmar, Weston, class of 1973) and my family have gained and prospered so much from his essence and being, and hope many of you reading this have as well. John had a special place in his heart for all of us, the students and his teachers at Weston High School. John's life was celebrated in a heart-felt gathering in May in Bar Harbor, Maine, which was his home-base with Allison since John's graduation from Purdue in the 70's. John traveled throughout the world. He played professional soccer in Europe and attended the first scientific exchange with communist China. He worked with world-renowned scientists studying genetics, and yes, cancer. But Johnâ€™s last calling was teaching mathematics to high school students who so appreciated his enthusiasm for the subject and his joie de vivre. John was such an accomplished person and soul, and so very humble. You can hear from my words that I miss him dearly, my \"Irish Twin\" as my mom called us. His birthday is soon, so perhaps on July 28th you will all look to the skies and thank all who have impacted your lives as I will with my brother John. Respectfully, and yes, so regrettably shared, Sharon Guidi Kretschmar (sgkretschmar@yahoo.com) (7-7-12)\n\n1974 - We have just received this sad note from Janet Kight Redden Porter: I was looking for my long lost classmate Nancilee Todd.

My mother, Loretta Wilson, is 90 years old now and still very active in her horticultural groups and organizations in Sun City West, AZ. My brother, David Wilson â€™70, is retired and living in in the city of Surprise, AZ. I am still in residential real estate selling desert land and homes in northwest metro Phoenix. I was married and divorced in the 80â€™s as well. I have managed to dodge the bullets of matrimony since then. I prefer the freedom. I guess Iâ€™m still a free spirit after all these years! I do miss the ocean, beaches and seafood of the Cape. Some day I expect to come back to New England to see what has changed. I have found much to love about the desert lifestyle. It keeps me in the Southwest. I enjoyed going to Mexico as often as I could until the battles at our border became more dangerous. I live outside of Phoenix in the northwest valley. I have been lucky enough to be healthy for most of my life. No big medical problems. Although â€œsenior citizenshipâ€ is creeping in. If anyone out there would like to get in touch with me, you can email me at peanyone@hotmail.com anytime.

I would enjoy being back in touch and hope to learn about any reunion plans that might get organized in the coming months. After leaving Weston, I graduated from Hebron Academy and Tufts University before pursuing a career in environmental engineering - particularly active in developing water supply projects for major cities across the country. We have two teenage kids attending the Brooks School in No. Andover now, so the household is busy with all that comes with high school - sports, music, social, driving, college prep....It would be great to catch up with my Weston schoolmates -- frozen in my mind are the memories of Weston High School in the fall of 1969....Hopefully weâ€™ll recognize each other should we meet again.(11-11-11)\n\nAll classes â€“ Marty Galligan â€™77 wants to know, is anyone aware of a WHS Alumni Association or similar non-profit?

I have had some health challenges over the last year-and-a-half, beginning with a small stroke on Christmas eve of 2009 that damaged my visual cortex and affected my vision. In May of 2011, I was diagnosed with uterine cancer and have been going through various treatments. I got through surgery and the first round of chemo and will start radiation soon, probably followed by more chemo. It's been pretty difficult, but hopefully I will eventually be cancer free. I still play mandolin occasionally with my friends, and last winter I completed my first novel which I'm hoping will get published. I live in Sudbury with my husband Kris. My son Gabriel is 24 and works as an illustrator for a publishing company. My former classmates Alison Mork and Ruth Landowne Giordano visited me during the summer. It was great to reconnect and I enjoyed their company immensely. Best wishes to all my former classmates for good health and happiness.

This comprehensive foundation for the study of realism will introduce students in disciplines as varied as philosophy, international relations, and strategic studies to the majestic breadth of the realist tradition that unifies them all. The work is comprised of four volumes, each focusing upon a distinct period and the pivotal contributors writing in that era. Volume 1, State of Hope, looks at the classical era when chaos reigned supreme. Volume 2, State of Fear, goes through the early-modern period and the emergence of the modern state. Volume 3, State of Awe, explores the age of total war with its unprecedented dangers. Volume 4, State of Siege, examines the present era of insurgency and asymmetrical conflict.

(10-6-11)\n\n1971 â€“ Sharon Sawyer Cross offers just a little update on whatâ€™s happening in my household. Our son, Clay, just got married 2 weeks ago at our home in Maine on the lake. He met his bride in college at Keene State and they resided in Burbank, CA, until last year when they moved to Boston. He works for CSN Corp., an internet company, and she works for Trader Joeâ€™s but will go back to school for nursing in 2012. Our daughter, Chandler, was one of the 326 out of 125,000 auditioners selected from Season 10 of American Idol and they sent us to Hollywood where she competed. She made it through 7 rounds of producers and exec. producers and of course made it through JLo, Steven and Randy, but on the second round was let go. (It was an interesting experience but certainly NOT reality as in â€œreality tv.â€) My husband, Chuck, is now working for Wells Fargo as Senior Counsel in Charlotte, N.C., and maintains a residence there, but we still have our homes in RI and in Maine. Due to the economy we will not be able to sell the home in RI, so I remain here while Chandler finishes Mount St. Charles Academy. We have 2 more international students living with us. This make a total of 14 students in the past 20 years. We have two girls from China, Pinzhou and Jinxiang. It is an interesting task to get our daughter, Chandler, and these two girls on all the college tours and through all the applications. These international students have been with us for 2 years and will matriculate into college in the USA. Due to the economy, my design business, Sphere Design, is not doing as well as I would like, so I have been looking into other business ventures.....more news on that as it develops!

Together with over 400,000 students from every corner of the country, your class participated in two days of testing that assessed your aptitudes and abilities on dozens of subject areas. You also completed an extensive questionnaire that asked about your interests, extracurricular activities, family background and your hopes and expectations for the future.\n\nThe scope and scale of the Project Talent study was unprecedented. It was the largest study of high school students ever conducted in the United States. The findings from the original 1960 study and its three follow-up studies have informed over 450 government reports, academic articles, and scholarly books. They were instrumental in revealing the factors, both within and beyond the school system, that influence students' educational attainment.\n\nNow, fifty-one years after the 1960 study was administered, the American Institutes for Research has decided to launch a follow-up study of original Project Talent participants - and we are looking for your class. We would love to know if you are planning a 50th reunion this year. Please email Project Talent at ProjectTalent50@air.org or contact us by phone: 1-866-770-6077 or visit us online at www.projecttalent.org. Many thanks!

He (and my father) taught me everything I know about tennis...Well, I never thought Iâ€™d be saying this, but I am teaching music in Santa Fe, NMâ€™s public schoolsâ€”general music K-2, and conducting two middle school orchestras. On top of that I have a full private music studio in Santa Fe, and run a chamber music program for kids. I still performâ€”classical, jazz, & latin on the celloâ€”and have a blogspot to review cellistâ€™s CDs...My mother moved back to Weston after many years away, and now lives in the Brook School apartments, occupying what I believe was Mr. Schaeferâ€™s home room, and is right across from Miss Collinsâ€™s home room, where I was for 4th grade. It was weird the first time I went to visit her and climbed the stairs of building C, with its now very-polished oak handrail. The steps are still the same.

He made learning the stuff easy, and the subject matter was hard. (1-28-10)\n\nFrom Patty Oâ€™Leary Helsingius â€™76: Mr. Burke was far and away my all time favorite teacher at Weston High. I always got a kick out of telling people that my favorite high school teacher was my physics teacher, as I went on to attend art school. How sad to have lost such a great man. I did not know about his particular commendations as a teacher, but I personally knew he was the best. I actually enjoyed staying after for help in physics (which I always needed) because of the great way he found to teach the material. He made it fun, even for a math and physics challenged person like me, to understand the subject matter. I remember how warmly he greeted my whole family at high school graduation on the Town Green. I am very saddened by his passing.
