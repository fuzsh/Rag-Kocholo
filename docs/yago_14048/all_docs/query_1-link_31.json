        "text": "Return to main Commencement Page\n\nQuick Link to Program\n\nQuick Link to Baccalaureate Degrees\n\nQuick Link to Scholarships\n\nA Brief History of\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Greensboro was established by legislative enactment on February 18, 1891, and opened its doors on October 5, 1892.\n\nThe institution came into being as a direct result of the efforts of Dr. Charles Duncan McIver on behalf of the education of women. To Dr. McIver, more than any other individual, the university owes its foundation. He became its first president and served until his death in 1906.\n\nSince its founding, the institution’s name has been changed several times: 1891–1919—State Normal and Industrial College; 1919–1932—North Carolina College for Women; 1932–1963— the Woman’s College of the University of North Carolina. In the 1963 General Assembly the name was changed to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and by the same Act the institution became co-educational. In the fall of 1964 the first class of male students was admitted. In 1972 the General Assembly in special session merged all state-supported institutions of higher education into the University of North Carolina without changing the names of each campus. Thus, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro is a member of the 17-campus university.\n\nFrom a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in 1892, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro has grown to a student body of nearly 18,000 students and over 2,800 faculty.\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Greensboro includes the following academic units: College of Arts and Sciences, Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics, School of Education, School of Health and Human Sciences, Interdisciplinary College, Lloyd International Honors College, Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, School of Nursing, and College of Visual and Performing Arts. With a 17:1 student-to-faculty ratio, the University offers more than 150 areas of undergraduate study and more than 200 master’s and doctoral programs.\n\nThe Processional\n\nThe procession is led by the Faculty Marshal and Mace Bearer and the academic banner bearers. The Assistant Chief Marshals enter next, leading the platform party, which includes the Chancellor; representatives of the Board of Trustees, the Alumni Association, and The University of North Carolina; the Commencement address speaker; the officers of the university; the bell ringers; the class speaker; the tassel turner, and the Chief Marshal. Graduating candidates enter next, followed by the faculty.\n\nThe Mace\n\nThe Mace is a ceremonial insignia of the university in a tradition that dates back to antiquity. Hand-chased in sterling silver, it bears academic motifs depicting the history of the institution and is carried by the Faculty Marshal on official occasions. The Mace of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro was presented by the Class of 1926 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of its graduation and the bicentennial of the nation. It was first carried at Commencement in 1978.\n\nThe Faculty Marshal\n\nThe Faculty Senate of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro adopted on November 3, 1999 a policy for appointing the Faculty Marshal. The Chancellor appoints the Faculty Marshal from among three nominees recommended by the Faculty Senate leadership (Chair, Chair-Elect, Secretary). The Faculty Marshal is a respected senior member of the faculty who has a consistent and continuous record of excellent teaching, scholarly achievements, and service to the university. Years in rank as Professor and years of employment at UNCG are considered. The term of appointment for a Faculty Marshal is five years. Duties include leading the academic procession during university ceremonies, carrying the university Mace, and membership in the Commencement Committee, which plans Commencement.\n\nThe Chain-of-Office\n\nThe Chain-of-Office is worn by the Chancellor of the university on occasions when the Mace is carried. The ceremonial medallion, hand-chased in sterling silver, bears the seal of the university, and indicates that the Chancellor is the temporary embodiment of the authority vested in the institution. The Chain-of-Office of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro was presented by the Class of 1929 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of its graduation and was worn by the Chancellor for the first time at the 1979 Commencement.\n\nThe Class of 1940 chose to complete the original design of the Chain-of-Office on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of its graduation. Each link of the sterling silver neck chain is an individually cast laurel leaf. The medallion clasp, also in sterling silver, bears the Great Seal of the State of North Carolina. The completed Chain-of-Office was worn by the Chancellor for the first time at the 1990 Commencement.\n\nThe University Flag\n\nAs the university has evolved from the State Normal and Industrial School in 1891 to UNC Greensboro today, so has the University Flag. The flag bears the traditional colors of gold and white, which were first used in the Commencement ceremony of 1894, as well as navy, which was added as the third color in 1987. In 2018, the university completed a brand refresh with updates to its colors including new shades of navy and gold as well as adopting a fourth color, grey. In 2020, a revision of the University Flag was completed to include official university colors. The December 2020 Commencement marked the debut of this new flag. The University Seal, depicting the likeness of Minerva, appears on both sides of the flag.\n\nThe Academic Banners\n\nThe Academic Banners represent the constituent parts of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro: the Graduate School, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the six professional schools—the Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics, the School of Education, the School of Health and Human Sciences, the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, the School of Nursing, and the College of Visual and Performing Arts. The designs are unique to this university; the colors have historical association with the respective academic disciplines. The banners are a memorial to Marguerite Norman Felton, teacher of chemistry at the university from 1956 to 1979.\n\nOver the years, several generations of college and school banners have existed. The current banners made their Commencement debut at the May 2010 ceremony.\n\nThe History of the University Bell\n\nFollowing the benediction, the University Bell will ring in honor of the Graduates. The University Bell sounded the opening of the State Normal and Industrial College (now UNC Greensboro) on October 5, 1892. For forty years—until electric bells were installed—it marked the significant moments of the day. The University Bell hung from a belfry in the Anniversary Plaza from 1967 until 1987 when it was removed for the purpose of restoration. The Class of 1940, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of its graduation, commissioned the restoration of the University Bell.\n\nUniversity Marshals\n\nThe Banner Bearers and escorts for all lines of march during Commencement are provided by the University Marshals, an academic honorary organization composed of full-time undergraduate students with academic averages of 3.65 or greater. These students may be recognized by the gold sashes that they wear during the ceremonies.\n\nAcademic Regalia\n\nAcademic costumes seem to have originated at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge over 650 years ago. The colors of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro are gold, white, and blue, with gold and white used in the hood.\n\nBaccalaureate Degrees\n\nQuick Links\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n\nBryan School of Business and Economics\n\nSchool of Education\n\nSchool of Health and Human Sciences\n\nSchool of Nursing\n\nCollege of Visual and Performing Arts\n\nHonors and Recognitions\n\n1Scheduled to be awarded two baccalaureate degrees this term."
