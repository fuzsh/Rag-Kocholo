        "text": "\"The long middle of a story is the hardest part for me as a writer. The beginning, far in the past. The ending—I don’t know. But what I do know is that it is good for a writer to be unaware of the conclusion. If the end startles the writer, it likely will surprise the reader, too. Pssst—the hero dies. I didn't hear that. I used to think that writing was a ticket to immortality. Who needed children when one’s progeny was one’s books? In my teens and early 20s, I longed for fame and glory. I didn’t think much about how the names of the immortals were relatively few, while libraries were filled with thousands of books by writers I had never heard of before, some of them quite famous in their time. And some authors whose names dominated only a decade or two ago are rarely mentioned today, now that their life force no longer animates the literary scene. When it comes to literary fame—which is not really that famous—I have more than some authors and less than others. But whenever I am tempted to believe my own hype, I read my one-star reviews—Bafflingly overpraised! Absurdist and repulsive! Pure garbage!—and recall that I live not far from Hollywood. When I tell people in Los Angeles that I’m a writer—no one cares. And if no one cares, why should I? That seems to be the greatest freedom in being mid, at least for me. To be middle-aged is not necessarily to be mid, particularly if one feels that one is at the peak of one’s powers. But to acknowledge that one’s accomplishments, great or small, hardly matter to most people and may one day fade into the dust, rendering one mid or even forgotten—might that actually be liberating rather than depressing?\" https://lnkd.in/dPm4wZtx\n\nIn today's chaotic stressful world, self care is critically important. We know that stress is the biggest factor in causing most illnesses. In order to reduce and manage stress we all need to have a personal self care program if we are to stay healthy and function well. In 2022 I interviewed 77 self care and wellness experts, that you can trust, to get their best tips and strategies for caring for your body, mind and spirit. These video interviews are available @yourselfcareguide.com. However, I know most people won't take the time to watch all of these videos. So in 2023 I put together a one page summary of each of these interviews so you can learn what you need to do quickly and easily. It is in a very nice pdf that one can keep as a trusted reference for life. This is a great Christmas gift for yourself and for anyone you care about and its only $37. You can get your copy @ https://lnkd.in/gNz3bsfC Be well\n\nA few people asked about the process of writing a book, so here goes: 1. Write it. This took me only a few weeks, however there was a much bigger version of how to survive life as a dr that was abandoned and went under the bed - so First Aid was born of the bigger project. 2. Have someone proof read/edit it - essential. I was lucky and had 2 journalist friends who did this as a favour. Otherwise - there are various people you can pay to do this. If you look up Joanna Penn online, she recommends various people. 3. Typesetting - after a painful process trying Word (which is possible), I bought the Vellum software - only for Mac and ££ but extremely easy and a joy to use. Lacks a few features for non fiction eg tables etc. Amazon KDP also has something which works fine. 4. Cover: I paid a designer in the US not realising the markets and tastes are totally different… the results were not nice. (A “burned out” teddy bear with a stethoscope around its neck. No, I don’t know what got into their heads either). I did my own on Canva in the end. There’s a lot more to that as your colours need to harmonise. Generally, the industry view is it’s much better to pay a designer but this just didn’t work out for me. 5. Upload to Amazon KDP. If you want to create a paperback then the cover has to be sized correctly - you can use a template called Bookow for this. 6. Launch. At every stage there is a, ‘WTF am I doing?’ feeling and there will also be people who say, ‘what are you doing, you seem to spend a lot of time on this,’ etc etc. So at every stage it helps to know the people who support you and your “why” of the whole project.

What they did not teach me was that your emotional health is directly connected to your mental and physical health. I saw the same kinds of patients - 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱, 𝗮𝗻𝘅𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗹𝘆 - many of whom wanted a pill to feel better. Something more needed to be done. I developed the “𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵 𝗣𝘆𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗱”, and my TEDx has over 100,000 views and counting. After working with thousands of patients, I’ve uncovered 5 common themes that greatly contribute to emotional distress. ***** 👉 Type “𝟓” in the COMMENTS below, and I’ll send over my e-book that outlines the five biggest mistakes to avoid if you want to live your Optimum life. P.S. Type “𝗕𝗢𝗢𝗞” if you want an early copy of my book \"𝑭𝒆𝒆𝒍 𝑩𝒆𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓\" releasing in February 2024 #personaldevelopment #bestadvice #conferences #mentalhealth #emotionalhealth #emotionalintelligence\n\n(Un)solicited advice - how do you receive it? I recommend you treat it like water and then imagine one of two response: become a sponge-camel and absorb it so you can use it now or later, or, if you’re feeling overwhelmed, I think it’s ok to become a colander-duck; smile politely then let their words run over you and away. Or, with a bit of practice you can be a little bit of both! Read more about the context of my ‘discovery’ and how the visualisation practice has helped me navigate (un)solicited advice over on my blog (and YES, I am aware of the irony of giving advice about receiving advice!)
