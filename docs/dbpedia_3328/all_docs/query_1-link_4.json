        "text": "It's been 7 years since the world premiere of She Has A Name, Unveil's dramatic thriller based on a real trafficking incident in Thailand.\n\nIn recognition of Human Trafficking Awareness Month this January, I’ve put together a list of 7 things I’ve learned since writing a story that, ultimately, changed my life.\n\n7 things I've learned about human trafficking since SHAN:\n\n1. It’s everywhere and it’s cruel.\n\nThere are over 40 million people around the world caught in slavery’s clutches. More than 13 million (one third) are children.\n\nOf the 2 million children that the UN reports are exploited in the commercial sex trade every year, only 1% are ever rescued.\n\n⏸️ It’s okay to pause for a moment about and cry or scream about those stats. ⏸️\n\n2. People are the problem and the solution.\n\nIn the research I’ve done and through the survivors I’ve met, through the work of incredible NGOs, what’s clear to me is that around the realities of trafficking create a collision of darkness and light, villainy and heroism, unthinkable evil and indescribable righteousness.\n\nI’m convinced that the most meaning any of us can encounter is to be part of real life stories of transformation. Small and big. To see perpetrators of violence held accountable and victims of injustice rescued, restored and empowered to be who they were meant to be and do what they’re meant to do.\n\n3. Focusing on the one is helpful.\n\nRather than fixating on the enormity of the issue and the stats we throw around when we talk about trafficking, keeping one precious life in front of us makes the difference.\n\nThat’s, ultimately, why I wrote a story about a girl known only as 18 and her friend Mae. One escapes the terror of her pimp. One does not.\n\nIf I can imagine the story of one person caught up in the evil clutches of human trafficking, then I can imagine doing something about it.\n\n4. It’s different in different places.\n\nTrafficking is a shapeshifter that takes on different forms. But no matter what it looks like, it’s dehumanizing, evil and destroys lives.\n\nThe most common form of human trafficking (79%) is sexual exploitation and the victims of sexual exploitation are predominantly women and girls. Surprisingly, women make up the largest proportion of traffickers (a plot line featured in our film).\n\nThe second most common form of human trafficking is forced labour (18%).\n\nIn Canada and the USA, the face and the nature of trafficking is different than in Thailand. But it’s just as devastating.\n\n5. Art* and justice should collide.\n\n{*Insert your passion here}.\n\nWhen we take the thing that is in our hand—an interest or passion or hobby—and apply it towards the justice issues we care about, then amazing, even unexpected things, can happen.\n\nThat thing, for me, was writing.\n\nAfter a cross-Canada stage tour, after film distribution in multiple languages and over 10 Million views later, I’m simply amazed that God has used a story he pressed into my heart and blessed the steps of faith to share it.\n\nI hope that encourages others to pick up their passion and respond. It certainly motivates me.\n\n6. Everyone and everything to end it.\n\nShooting the film adaptation of She Has A Name was a collaboration of so many people with so much talent. The above photo of our crew on location in Bangkok just scratches the surface of the hundreds of people in front of the camera and behind it who made just one film possible.\n\nFor me, the film project serves as an example of what it takes in order to pull off any big feat. People from all over with passion and skills who commit time, talent and energy to see the thing done.\n\nHow much more so, then, will it require the creativity, skill, technical ability, brain power, risk, passion, time, energy, finances, faith and so on of so many people in order to bring the giant human trafficking to its knees?\n\n7. We must let the issue continue to break our hearts.\n\nIt’s easier than I’d like to admit for me to shut out all the feels. Or to not take time to stop, think, lament, pray, determine to act. But I can’t let the sobering reality of my smallness revealed against the bigness of the reality of human trafficking numb me.\n\nStories, real and imagined, are critical for me (and for us) to engage our hearts for the first time or re-engage them again to address injustices like trafficking.\n\nStories help us to remain willing to go to the dangerous places, the dark places. To let the human story unsettle us and turn our hearts until we move our hands and feet to walk with others into the light.\n\nWhere can you watch She Has A Name?\n\nIn January, She Has A Name is featured on Delta Airways’ in-flight programming to raise awareness about human trafficking. Not flying? You can stream in on-demand at UnveilTV and Amazon Prime.\n\nRead more of on his Substack\n\n."
