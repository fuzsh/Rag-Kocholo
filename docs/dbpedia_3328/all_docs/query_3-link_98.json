        "text": "Recorded accompaniment is a hallmark of auditions at several levels — from community theatre to Unified college auditions — and we know that it can be difficult to find tracks to use for these unique situations. We have created these accompaniment tracks for auditioning actors to be able to easily pull up in the room. Each song has been cut down to an audition-appropriate length (usually 32 bars and/or 1 minute) so that using them is as effortless as possible.\n\n—\n\nSheet Music\n\nNeed audition cut sheet music for an audition with a pianist?
