        "text": "In the middle of the summer, let’s enjoy this week’s most interesting pieces of XR news!\n\nTop news of the week\n\nPSVR 2 sales skyrocketed with the discount\n\nLast week I reported about Sony heavily discounting PlayStation VR 2 in the US and UK: the original price was $550, but after the discount it amounted to just $350. This week, The Shortcut reports that the sales of the headset may have skyrocketed by a 2350% factor from the day before the discount to the day after. According to the same magazine, more PSVR 2 were sold on the first day of the discount than in the whole of 2024 until that day. This is pretty insane.\n\nIt’s not the first time that we see how price is critical for the success of a headset: the Oculus Rift CV1 was lagging in sales far behind the HTC Vive until Oculus slashed the price so much during “The Summer of Rift” that people started preferring the cheaper Oculus to the more expensive Vive. From that successful experiment, Oculus (then Facebook, Meta) started selling headsets under cost to kill the competition. Upload VR reports that “while at Meta, John Carmack revealed that the company saw each $100 reduction in price result in an exponential boost in sales, not the linear increase you might assume”.\n\nNow the question is what Sony Interactive Entertainment thinks to do after this spike in sales. If, given the negative moment of the gaming ecosystem, it wants to focus on PS5, then this discount has only been useful to clear stocks in the warehouses and nothing more. But if it considers this as a successful experiment, it could do the same thing that Oculus did back in the day: keep this discount permanent and give new life to the PSVR 2, both as a console headset and as a PCVR headset (through the adapter). This of course would also require new investments in VR content, which may be the biggest problem for Sony to carry on, especially after all the layoffs it did this year. Let’s see: for now, let’s enjoy the good news that finally PSVR 2 had some good sales…\n\nMore info\n\nOther relevant news\n\nMeta reports positive earnings, but Reality Labs still bleeds cash\n\nQ2 2024 has been a very positive quarter for Meta. The company reported growth in all the economic indicators, with net revenues reaching $13.47 billion, an increase of 73% compared to $7.8 the year prior. The money is of course brought mainly by “the family of apps”, that is Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which are the current main business of the company. This positive moment is pleasing investors and gives Zuckerberg more leeway to keep investing huge amounts of cash into the technologies of the future, that is AI and XR.\n\nReality Labs had a positive quarter, too, with a 28% increase in revenues compared to one year ago. Meta claimed that Quest 3 has been the main driver of this growth, with sales that are exceeding Meta’s expectations. Honestly, it’s the 1000th time that I hear XR companies claiming that a new device is selling beyond expectations: either they all suck at making expectations, or this is just a bullshit marketing sentence. I vote for the second option, but you decide what you prefer.\n\nIn any case, the growth is good, but revenues are still lower than when Quest 2 was in its golden moment. Quest 3 is too expensive to reach explosive growth, and we will need the cheaper Quest 3s for XR sales to accelerate again.\n\nReality Labs is still bleeding cash, though: notwithstanding the growth of the revenues, the division still lost $4.5 billion in just a quarter. Meta is investing heavily to dominate the metaverse and this is something I personally appreciate. But on the other side, according to a recent report, it is also wasting a lot of money because of bad management. It seems that the company promotes people who are successful in the social media business to the XR business, but since they do not understand the XR space and they do have not the humility to learn, they make disasters. Also, some ambitious projects are started and after spending a few millions they get closed because they are not going anywhere. This is coherent with what John Carmack said a few years ago: before leaving the company, he complained about the efficiency, saying that the team could have gone much faster. So, while Meta is doing well in investing money in future technologies, it could probably waste much less cash if it had better internal processes.\n\nMore info (Meta increased its revenues in Q2 2024)\n\nMore info (Meta Reality Labs revenue growth)\n\nMore info (Meta Reality Labs wasting money because of bad management)\n\nPSVR 2 PC Adapter has a Bluetooth problem\n\nThe first reviewers started getting the PSVR 2 Adapter for PC and reporting feedback about it. It seems that the device is just fine, and if you have a computer that is powerful enough, the experience with PSVR 2 is definitely good. The headset is comfortable, has a good resolution, and has great black colors thanks to the OLED display. Also, the tracking of the headset is good.\n\nBut there is a huge problem: the PSVR 2 controllers require Bluetooth to work and the adapter has no Bluetooth inside. The device so relies on Bluetooth connection from the computer, but the biggest absurdity is that many existing Bluetooth controllers do not work well with PSVR controllers. The YouTuber Voodoo had to try four Bluetooth dongles before finding one that worked, but even with this one, the tracking of the controllers was awful and had frequent hiccups. Sebastian Ang from MRTV had the same issues.\n\nThis Bluetooth issue can ruin the experience of anyone who wants to use PSVR 2 with a PC. Our only hope is that Sony releases a list of compatible Bluetooth controllers.\n\nMore info\n\nNews worth a mention\n\nMeta releases new tool for audio ray tracing\n\nMeta announced the release of a new Acoustic Ray Tracing feature in the Audio SDK for Unity and Unreal. It will make it easier for developers to add realistic sound propagation in their XR experiences, making them more immersive. It can simulate sound reflections, reverberations, and things like diffraction, occlusion, and obstruction, which are all critical to making spatial audio closer to the real thing. It is also compatible with popular middleware like FMOD and Wwise and this will make a few sound designers happy.\n\nAcoustic Ray Tracing is being used in the upcoming Quest exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow,\n\nMore info (Audio Ray Tracing — Road To VR)\n\nMore info (Audio Ray Tracing — Upload VR)\n\nMicrosoft and Sony join the Alliance For OpenUSD\n\nThe OpenUSD format, which is meant to be a standard for exchanging 3D scenes between applications, is going to have two more big tech giants supporting it. Microsoft and Sony have just joined the Alliance for OpenUSD, which already includes other relevant tech companies like Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, NVIDIA, Meta, and Epic Games. At this point, with the support of almost all the major tech companies out there, I’m pretty sure that OpenUSD will become a relevant standard for 3D scene definition and declaration.\n\nMore info\n\nMeta releases v68 runtime for Quest, which includes AI a measurement app\n\nMeta is rolling out the runtime v68 for Quest and this includes a few improvements here and there, but the most relevant changes are:\n\nThe introduction of an AI assistant, through which people can speak and to which people can ask to analyze the environment around them. It will be available only in North America, though\n\nThe release of the Layout app, which lets people take measurements of furniture in their environment and also preview how a new piece of furniture fits in the house. This app had been previewed various times and now it has finally been released on the Horizon Store.\n\nMore info (Quest v68 — Road To VR)\n\nMore info (Quest v68 — Upload VR)\n\nHTC discounts the price of the Vive XR Elite\n\nHTC has discounted the price of the Vive XR Elite in the US, cutting it from $1,100 to $900. Until the end of the month, people can also buy the Vive XR Elite and some trackers together in a bundle for a discounted price. Honestly speaking, I don’t think this little price slash is going to move much the sales of the device.\n\nMore info (Vive XR Elite discounted — Road To VR)\n\nMore info (Vive XR Elite discounted — Upload VR)\n\nJensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg had a chat at SIGGRAPH\n\nNVIDIA had a strong presence at SIGGRAPH. There it also announced a few news about OpenUSD, like a generative AI service to generate USD files.\n\nBut the highlight of the event has been the fireside chat between Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg, who talked together about Artificial Intelligence and Immersive Realities. So many billions on just one stage! If you have some time, I suggested to watch it because it’s a pleasant chat.\n\n(Thanks to Ivan Aguilar for the tip on the last link)\n\nMore info (NVIDIA’s USD service)\n\nMore info (Zuckerberg and Huang’s chat)\n\nMore info (Highlights of Zuckerberg and Huang’s chat)\n\nPimax talks about the status of all its projects\n\nThe community asked Pimax to improve its communication and Pimax did it. In a video released a few days ago, the company talked about all its products and the status they are in. It’s a very candid moment and I absolutely appreciate this openness. One of the most relevant information contained inside is that the Pimax Portal, the Wish copy of the Nintendo Switch, has been canceled: the company will still provide updates for existing devices, but it has stopped its production.\n\n(Thanks Alex for the tip)\n\nMore info\n\nFlat2VR Studios gets investment from Andreessen Horowitz\n\nFlat2VR Studios has been admitted into the SPEEDRUN accelerator of Andreessen Horowitz, one of the biggest VC firms in the US. Apart from $750,000 in funding and support, this is a huge endorsement for the VR porting studio. This is great news because it means that the studio will be able to port more popular flatscreen games to VR. I’m happy for them, but I also would like to see how much the VR porting business will prove to be profitable: we have seen people like Luke Ross making good money with VR ports, but when VCs give you money, you should make dozens of millions a year to be considered successful. I guess the next months will tell us if this bet is going as expected…\n\nMore info\n\nWaveXR is back\n\nWaveXR is back at making immersive concerts. The company just opened a waitlist for people that want to know more. I’m pretty happy about it because Wave was able to make dope performances…\n\nMore info\n\nSome news about content\n\nThe New Salsa Academy, an MR/VR application that teaches you how to dance Salsa, is available for Quest 2/3/Pro on the Horizon Store, priced at $20\n\nImpulse: Playing with Reality is an interactive documentary narrated by Tilda Swinton that explores ADHD through mixed reality.
