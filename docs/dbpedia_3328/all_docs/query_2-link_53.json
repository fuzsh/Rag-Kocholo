NRP1 + group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) display inÂ vitro lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) activity. In agreement with this, NRP1 + ILC3s are mainly located in proximity to high endothelial venules (HEVs) and express cell surface molecules involved in lymphocyte migration in secondary lymphoid tissues via HEVs. NRP1 was also expressed on mouse fetal LTi cells, indicating that NRP1 is a conserved marker for LTi cells. Human NRP1 + ILC3s are primed cells because they express CD45RO and produce higher amounts of cytokines than NRP1 - cells, which express CD45RA. The NRP1 ligand vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) served as a chemotactic factor for NRP1 + ILC3s. NRP1 + ILC3s are present in lung tissues from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, suggesting a role in angiogenesis and/or the initiation of ectopic pulmonary lymphoid aggregates.

Here, we undertook extensive archival collection efforts from 3 representative cities of Peru (Lima in the central coast, Iquitos in the northeastern Amazon region, Ica in the southern coast) to characterize the age and geographic patterns of the 1918â1920 influenza pandemic in this country. Materials and Methods We analyzed historical documents describing the 1918â1920 influenza pandemic in Peru and retrieved individual mortality records from local provincial archives for quantitative analysis. We applied seasonal excess mortality models to daily and monthly respiratory mortality rates for 1917â1920 and quantified transmissibility estimates based on the daily growth rate in respiratory deaths. Results A total of 52,739 individual mortality records were inspected from local provincial archives. We found evidence for an initial mild pandemic wave during July-September 1918 in Lima, identified a synchronized severe pandemic wave of respiratory mortality in all three locations in Peru during November 1918-February 1919, and a severe pandemic wave during January 1920- March 1920 in Lima and July-October 1920 in Ica. There was no recrudescent pandemic wave in 1920 in Iquitos. Remarkably, Lima experienced the brunt of the 1918â20 excess mortality impact during the 1920 recrudescent wave, with all age groups experiencing an increase in all cause excess mortality from 1918â19 to 1920. Middle age groups experienced the highest excess mortality impact, relative to baseline levels, in the 1918â19 and 1920 pandemic waves. Cumulative excess mortality rates for the 1918â20 pandemic period were higher in Iquitos (2.9%) than Lima (1.6%). The mean reproduction number for Lima was estimated in the range 1.3â1.5. Conclusions We identified synchronized pandemic waves of intense excess\n\nPrediction-based control for LTI systems with uncertain time-varying delays and partial state knowledge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLÃ©chappÃ©, V.; Moulay, E.; Plestan, F.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe stability of a prediction-based controller for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems is studied in the presence of time-varying input and output delays. The uncertain delay case is treated as well as the partial state knowledge case. The reduction method is used in order to prove the convergence of the closed-loop system including the state observer, the predictor and the plant. Explicit conditions that guarantee the closed-loop stability are given, thanks to a Lyapunov-Razumikhin analysis. Simulations illustrate the theoretical results.\n\nThe Synthetic Antimicrobial Peptide 19-2.5 Interacts with Heparanase and Heparan Sulfate in Murine and Human Sepsis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartin, Lukas; De Santis, Rebecca; Koczera, Patrick; Simons, Nadine; Haase, Hajo; Heinbockel, Lena; Brandenburg, Klaus; Marx, Gernot; Schuerholz, Tobias\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHeparanase is an endo-Î²-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate side chains from their proteoglycans. Thereby, heparanase liberates highly potent circulating heparan sulfate-fragments (HS-fragments) and triggers the fatal and excessive inflammatory response in sepsis. As a potential anti-inflammatory agent for sepsis therapy, peptide 19-2.5 belongs to the class of synthetic anti-lipopolysaccharide peptides; however, its activity is not restricted to Gram-negative bacterial infection. We hypothesized that peptide 19-2.5 interacts with heparanase and/or HS, thereby reducing the levels of circulating HS-fragments in murine and human sepsis. Our data indicate that the treatment of septic mice with peptide 19-2.5 compared to untreated control animals lowers levels of plasma heparanase and circulating HS-fragments and reduces heparanase activity. Additionally, mRNA levels of heparanase in heart, liver, lung, kidney and spleen are downregulated in septic mice treated with peptide 19-2.5 compared to untreated control animals. In humans, plasma heparanase level and activity are elevated in septic shock. The ex vivo addition of peptide 19-2.5 to plasma of septic shock patients decreases heparanase activity but not heparanase level. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a strong exothermic reaction between peptide 19-2.5 and heparanase and HS-fragments. However, a saturation character has been identified only in the peptide 19-2.5 and HS interaction. In conclusion, the findings of our current study indicate that peptide 19-2.5 interacts with heparanase, which is elevated in murine and human sepsis and consecutively attenuates the generation of circulating HS-fragments in systemic inflammation. Thus, peptide 19-2.5 seems to be a potential anti-inflammatory agent in sepsis.\n\nModeling man: the monkey colony at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Embryology, 1925-1971.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Emily K\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThough better recognized for its immediate endeavors in human embryo research, the Carnegie Department of Embryology also employed a breeding colony of rhesus macaques for the purposes of studying human reproduction. This essay follows the course of the first enterprise in maintaining a primate colony for laboratory research and the overlapping scientific, social, and political circumstances that tolerated and cultivated the colony's continued operation from 1925 until 1971. Despite a new-found priority for reproductive sciences in the United States, by the early 1920s an unfertilized human ovum had not yet been seen and even the timing of ovulation remained unresolved. Progress would require an organized research approach that could extend beyond the limitations of working with scant and inherently restrictive human subjects or with common lab mammals like mice. In response, the Department of Embryology, under the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW), instituted a novel methodology using a particular primate species as a surrogate in studying normal human reproductive physiology. Over more than 40 years the monkey colony followed an unpremeditated trajectory that would contribute fundamentally to discoveries in human reproduction, early embryo development, reliable birth control methods, and to the establishment of the rhesus macaque as a common model organism.\n\n40 CFR 60.1925 - How must I monitor opacity for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent yard waste?\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-07-01\n\n... curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent yard waste? 60.1925 Section 60.1925 Protection of Environment... or Before August 30, 1999 Model Rule-Air Curtain Incinerators That Burn 100 Percent Yard Waste Â§ 60.1925 How must I monitor opacity for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent yard waste?

The size and selectivity of the immigrant community, as well as their disproportionate residence in large cities, meant they were the mainstay of the American industrial workforce. Immigrants and their children comprised over half of manufacturing workers in 1920, and if the third generation (the grandchildren of immigrants) are included, then more than two-thirds of workers in the manufacturing sector were of recent immigrant stock. Although higher wages and better working conditions might have encouraged more long-resident native-born workers to the industrial economy, the scale and pace of the American industrial revolution might well have slowed. The closing of the door to mass immigration in the 1920s did lead to increased recruitment of native born workers, particularly from the South, to northern industrial cities in the middle decades of the 20th century.

Historical analysis of events, legislation and a legal case study was used to synthesize the ideas and philosophies that guided events this century leading up the trial in Dayton, Tennessee during July of 1925. The study examined the development of the concept of a wall of separation between Church and State that began with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and developed into the key component of the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution. This concept was applied to the case analysis, legislation and school district policies regarding Creation and Evolution. The concepts of Creation and Evolution were examined and compared as a basis for understanding the conflict that exists between the Religious Right and the scientific community. The main personalities and their motives on both sides were highlighted because of the fact that the conflict still continues. The study sought solutions for practicing administrators who are faced with the controversy of Creation and Evolution in their schools. The question that guided the study was, \"Is Accommodation possible or is Separation necessary?\" The study examined legislation and court cases seeking the right answer for schools in their constant struggle with the two diametrically opposed philosophies. Analysis of the historical evidence and the events surrounding the issue since the inception of the United States concluded that there is no room for Accommodation with the First Amendment. Separation has been and should continue to be the guiding principle whenever the line between Church and State begins to blur. The collaboration between Church and State can prove harmful for both and the best way to insure their survival and proliferation is to keep them separate.\n\nDental manpower in India: changing trends since 1920.\n\nPubMed\n\nJaiswal, Ashish K; Srinivas, Pachava; Suresh, Sanikommu\n\n2014-08-01\n\nTo analyse the changing trends in dental manpower production of India since 1920 and its development to date.

It was a seismic disturbance of the first order of magnitude, but, owing to the hour at which it occurred and to other fortunate circumstances, no lives were lost and no fires broke out. The shock was startling throughout an area extending 75 miles or more in all directions from the epicenter and was sensible to persons within an area of 310,000 square miles. Within the epicentral area brick buildings suffered severely, rocks fell from cliffs, cracks opened in the ground, and the inhabitants experienced the usual symptoms of illness and emotions of alarm.

W.; Dunham, J. B.; Fiala, A. D.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nFrom an analysis of numerous reports from different locations on the duration of totality of the solar eclipses on January 24, 1925, and February 26, 1979, it is found that the solar radius at the earlier date was 0.5 arcsec (or 375 km) larger than at the later date. The correction to the standard solar radius found for each eclipse is different when different subsets of the observations are used (for example, edge of path of totality timings compared with central timings). This is seen as suggesting the existence of systematic inaccuracies in our knowledge of the lunar figure. The differences between the corrections for both eclipses, however, are very similar for all subsets considered, indicating that changes of the solar size may be reliably inferred despite the existence of the lunar figure errors so long as there is proper consideration of the distribution of the observations. These results are regarded as strong evidence in support of the occurrence of solar radius changes on shorter than evolutionary time scales.\n\nPrelude to specialization: US cancer nursing, 1920-50.\n\nPubMed\n\nLusk, Brigid\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThis study used historical research methodology to assess the work of US nurses caring for patients with cancer from 1920 to 1950. Primary sources, obtained from several US archives, included nursing procedure books, student nurses' lecture notes, hospital and nursing annual reports, and meeting minutes. Secondary sources included journal articles and textbooks. The aim was to document the clinical work of nurses caring for patients with cancer and assess this work for evidence of emerging specialization in cancer nursing. Following a review of cancer in the 1920s, nursing education specific to cancer, nursing care related to specific cancer therapies, and the practice of concealing a diagnosis of cancer, were examined. Nurses were consistently educated in cancer nursing, but their cancer education became more focused over the decades. Nurses were closely involved with cancer patients as they monitored their patients' radium or assisted patients following radical surgery. The issue of concealing the diagnosis of cancer was problematic to some nurses. This paper reveals the nature of nurses' hospital work with cancer patients and demonstrates a core body of cancer nursing knowledge. The emergence of cancer nursing as a specialty is presented.\n\nThe Plymouth Laboratory and the institutionalization of experimental zoology in Britain in the 1920s.\n\nPubMed\n\nErlingsson, SteindÃ³r J\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Plymouth Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (1884) was founded in 1888. In addition to conducting morphological and other biological research, the founders of the laboratory aimed at promoting research in experimental zoology which will be used in this paper as a synonym for e.g. experimental embryology, comparative physiology or general physiology. This dream was not fully realized until 1920. The Great War and its immediate aftermath had a positive impact on the development of the Plymouth Laboratory. The war greatly upset the operation of the Zoological Station in Naples and the ensuing crisis in its operations was closely related to the establishment of the physiological department in Plymouth in 1920. Two other key factors in the Plymouth story were the establishment of the Development Fund in 1909, which began contributing funds to the Plymouth Laboratory in 1912, and the patronage of the Cambridge zoologist George P. Bidder (1863-1954). This paper will focus on the combined influence of the Development Fund and Bidder on the development of the Plymouth Laboratory from around 1902 through the early 1920s, and the important role the laboratory played in promoting experimental zoology in Britain in the 1920s.\n\n3.

The analysis is limited by the territory of the Eniseiskaia gubernia (Krasnoiarskii' kraii) as an example for developing a notion about occurrences in life not only ofparticular region but of a whole country. The Soviet government finally established in the Enisei'i'skaia gubernia later (in January 1920) than in in the rest of the European part of the country. This was the reason of implementing on the territory with accelerated rates the experience ofSoviet development cumulated during the years of military communism (October 1917-1920). Exactly during this period the general nationalization of curative institutions and pharmacies was implemented. The traditional autonomy of physicians made way to the Â«Soviet employeeÂ» status and the state monopoly to social policy and practice was made official. The article is based on documents of the State archives of the Krasnoiarskii' kraii and published sources. These materials permitted to discover limitedness of the material and human resources inthe sphere of medical care and services. To verify existing in the scientific publications notion that in 1920s the elimination of differentiation between urban and rural citizen in receiving medical services and establishment in full measure qualitative and accessible medical care failed. The discrepancy between declared program of medical care and real possibilities of its implementation became the main deterrent. The absence of unified system of settling, social territorial isolation of settlements, immense scale of territory required huge material expenses for getting over space and developing infrastructure of health care in the kraii.\n\nThe American Role in Education in the Middle East: Ideology and Experiment, 1920-1940\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMent, David M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn a significant 1925 essay, \"Western Education in Moslem Lands\", Paul Monroe addressed the emerging cultural and political forces faced by American educators in the Middle East.

Comprehensive study of deforestation in biosphere reserves is required to assess the impact of the management effectiveness. This article assesses the changes in forest cover in various zones and protected areas of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first declared biosphere reserve in India which forms part of Western Ghats-a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have mapped the forests from earliest available topographical maps and multi-temporal satellite data spanning from 1920's to 2012 period. Mapping of spatial extent of forest cover, vegetation types and land cover was carried out using visual interpretation technique. A grid cell of 1Â kmâÃâ1Â km was generated for time series change analysis to understand the patterns in spatial distribution of forest cover (1920-1973-1989-1999-2006-2012). The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be 5,806.5Â km(2) (93.8Â % of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as 1,423.6Â km(2) (24.5Â % of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of >0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during 1920-1973. The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of >75Â ha of forest loss during 1920-1973 while, only 15 grids have shown >75Â ha loss during 1973-1989. Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically\n\nFrom Expressive Reading to Rapid Reading: The Rise in Reading Rate During the Efficiency Movement (1910-1925)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTaylor, Laura A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nReading rate, a component of reading not closely attended to by educators and researchers prior to the 20th century, quickly became the subject of considerable research shortly after the turn of the century.

Guided by questions about the status and influence of mental measurement in Russian society, previously and after the revolution, as well as asking about the main actors in the fields linked to testing, such as psychology, pedagogy, and pedology, during this tumultuous period. To answer these questions, journals and difficult-to-access archival sources were used, which provided evidence regarding the enthusiasm psychological testing had on scholars in the 1920s and the institutional support they received for their surveys. The article offers some hints concerning why this was so and why this situation changed completely a decade later.

We define poverty as living in a household with a disposable income lower than a poverty line that represents a constant purchasing power all years, as well as poverty lines defined as 60% of contemporary median income. Clear reductions of poverty from 1925 to 1947, as well as from 1958 to 1983, are found. We argue that an important poverty-reducing mechanism during both periods was narrowing earnings disparities. Further, we claim that the poverty reduction from the end of the 1950s to the first half of the 1980s was the outcome of improved transfer systems as well as the establishment of pronounced characteristics of present-day Sweden: the dual earner system.\n\nComparative Decades: Conservatism in the 1920s and 1980s.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDickson, Ted\n\n2003-01-01\n\nPresents a lesson plan designed for high school juniors about the U.S. conservatist movement in the 1920s and 1980s.

All attempts to get this disease under control failed in the past, and especially in times of increasing antibiotic resistance, this leads to one of the most urgent medical challenges of our times. We designed a peptide to bind with high affinity to endotoxins, one of the most potent pathogenicity factors involved in triggering sepsis. The peptide Pep19-2.5 reveals high endotoxin neutralization efficiency in vitro, and here, we demonstrate its antiseptic/anti-inflammatory effects in vivo in the mouse models of endotoxemia, bacteremia, and cecal ligation and puncture, as well as in an ex vivo model of human tissue. Furthermore, we show that Pep19-2.5 can bind and neutralize not only endotoxins but also other bacterial pathogenicity factors, such as those from the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This broad neutralization efficiency and the additive action of the peptide with common antibiotics makes it an exceptionally appropriate drug candidate against bacterial sepsis and also offers multiple other medication opportunities.

Besides systemic application, the occurrence of severe local infections necessitates a topical application for example in the case of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). Recent investigations show that the synthetic anti-lipopolysaccharide peptide (SALP) Pep19-2.5 (AspidaseptÂ® I) and a variant called Pep19-4LF (AspidaseptÂ® II) are able to supress inflammation reactions also in keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, and dendritic cells from the skin. For topical application, a possible formulation represents the drug dispersed into a pharmaceutical cream (DAC base cream). Here, we present investigations on the stability of the peptides using this formulation in dependence on time, which includes the evaluation of the extraction procedure, the quantitative analysis of the peptides after extraction, its sensitivity to protease degradation and its ability to maintain activity against LPS-induced inflammation in vitro. We have developed an extraction procedure for the peptides with an optimum yield and showed that Pep19-2.5 is present as a dimer after extraction from the cream, whereas Pep19-4LF retains its monomeric form. Both peptides show no degradation by chymotrypsin after extraction for at least 1â¯h, which is indicative for an attachment of constituents of the base cream, inhibiting the cutting into peptidic part structures. The extracted peptides and in particular the dimeric Pep19-2.5 are still able to inhibit the LPS-induced inflammation reaction in human mononuclear cells. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although historians have focused on the African American origins of the music, another theme was also prominent in the public discourse surrounding jazz: disability. Critics saw jazz and its associated dances as defective, causing both mental and physical impairments in their devotees. In other words, jazz music and dance were disabled and disabling. Proponents of jazz responded in kind, asserting that jazz did not cause impairments, it cured them; similarly, jazz was not defective music or dance, but a revitalisation of the art forms. On the one hand, these reactions might have been expected, given the long history of belief in a relationship between music and health. However, the importance of health issues such as eugenics and rehabilitation in the 1920s also clearly influenced the responses of opinion leaders, politicians, academics, music professionals, and others to jazz music and dance.\n\nOwners and Operators\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nHands logo Search 1920s 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 Search 1930s 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 Search 1940s 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 Search 1950s 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 Search 1960s 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967\n\nA Comparison of the Household Work of Married Females: The Mid-1920s and the Late 1960s.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBryant, W.

Low rates of enrollment, literacy, and attendance, inefficiency in the use of resources, poverty, and a reduced number of schools were the main factors explaining the crisis. As a response, the Law on Compulsory Primary Education, considering mandatory for children between 6 and 14 years old to attend any school for at least four years, was passed in 1920. Using data from Censuses of the Republic of Chile from 1920 and 1930, reports of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, and the Statistical Yearbooks between 1895 and 1930, we apply machine learning techniques (clustering and decision trees) to assess the impact of this law on the Chilean schooling process between 1920 and 1930. We conclude that the law had a positive impact on the schooling indicators in this period. Even though it did not overcome the differences between urban and rural zones, it brought about a general improvement of the schooling process and a more efficient use of resources and infrastructure in both big urban centers and small-urban and rural zones, thereby managing the so-called crisis of the Republic.\n\nAn underrated personality of the Cluj School of Pathology: Alexandru Serban (1920-1977).\n\nPubMed\n\nBÃ¢rsu, Dan Cristian; BÃ¢rsu, Marina\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Romanian School of Pathology from Cluj has an important prestige, well known in Romania and abroad. It was founded in the same year with the Romanian Faculty of Medicine from the same City. The founder of the School of Pathology was Victor Babes (1854-1926). In 1920, his role was continued by his remarkable pupil Titu Vasiliu (1885-1961). Unfortunately, a personality of this School of Pathology rarely mentioned is Alexandru Serban (1920-1977). He was pupil of T. Vasiliu and he led the Department of Pathology from the Cluj Faculty of Medicine between 1973 and 1977. The purpose of our paper is to put into evidence his contributions in the development of pathology in Cluj and in Romania. We mention some data about his life. Thus, we pay an homage to his memory.\n\nSalesclerks, sexual danger, and national identity in Egypt, 1920s-1950s.\n\nPubMed\n\nReynolds, Nancy Y\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis article investigates change and continuity in anxieties about shopping during the first half of the twentieth century in Egypt to argue that department stores and their salesclerks became critical sites for enacting and challenging new notions of sexuality and citizenship. Retail innovations, such as commission pay, display, free entry, and large commercial staffs, became understood as sexual and moral problems because department stores blurred the boundaries between classes and were public spaces where unrelated men and women could mix. These concerns about sexuality in the 1920s were recycled and amplified in the late 1940s and early 1950s when salesclerks again came under scrutiny during debates over citizenship and ethnicity. I argue that the particular way this latter debate was barnacled by the concerns of the 1920s helped to delineate the broader society's reaction to the challenges of defining Egyptian nationality.\n\nAgentive Role of Government in African Education: North Nyanza, 1890-1920\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOmwami, Edith Mukudi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the agentive role of the colonial administration in accessing formal education for Africans in North Nyanza, Kenya from 1890 to 1920.

On the surface, it looked as though the Philosophical Magazine was managed very informally, while the Proceedings had in place a seemingly rigid system of committee approval and peer review. This essay shows, however, that in practice the two journals were both influenced by networks of expertise that afforded small groups of physicists considerable control over the content of these prestigious scientific publications. This study explores the nature of peer review, suggesting how a historical approach can contribute to contemporary debates. In studying these relationships, the essay also considers the interplay of \"classical\" and \"modern\" ideas and physicists in 1920s Britain and cautions against an anachronistic approach to this classification.\n\n1920x1080 pixel color camera with progressive scan at 50 to 60 frames per second\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGlenn, William E.; Marcinka, John W.\n\n1998-09-01\n\nFor over a decade, the broadcast industry, the film industry and the computer industry have had a long-range objective to originate high definition images with progressive scan. This produces images with better vertical resolution and much fewer artifacts than interlaced scan. Computers almost universally use progressive scan. The broadcast industry has resisted switching from interlace to progressive because no cameras were available in that format with the 1920 X 1080 resolution that had obtained international acceptance for high definition program production. The camera described in this paper produces an output in that format derived from two 1920 X 1080 CCD sensors produced by Eastman Kodak.\n\nMaking magnetic recording commercial: 1920-1955\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClark, Mark H.\n\n1999-03-01\n\nAlthough magnetic recording had been invented in 1898, it was not until the late 1920s that the technology was successfully marketed to the public. Firms in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States developed and sold magnetic recorders for specialized markets in broadcasting and telephone systems through the 1930s. The demands of World War II considerably expanded the use of magnetic recording, and with the end of the war, firms in the United States sought to bring magnetic recording to home and professional music recording. Using a combination of captured German technology and American wartime research, American companies such as Ampex, Magnecord, 3M, the Brush Development Company, and others created a vast new industry. By the mid-1950s, magnetic recording was firmly established as a method for recording both sound and data.\n\n[Pierre Mornard (1883-1929), unrecognized plastic surgeon].\n\nPubMed\n\nGlicenstein, J\n\n2017-02-01\n\nMany operations of aesthetic surgery were described between 1920 and 1930.

After 1920 the birth control movement became gradually transformed into a respectable, nonradical reform cause, the recipient of large grants from big business, with women's rights secondary to an overriding concern with medical health and population control. This transformation was achieved through the professionalization of the birth control movement-that is, its takeover by professional experts, almost all male, in place of the radical amateur women, fighting for their own interests, who initiated it. The article examines two groups of professionals who were particularly influential in this transformation: doctors and academic eugenists. The former made birth control a medical issue, held back the development of popular sex education, and stifled a previously developing feminist approach to women's birth control needs. The later contributed racism to the birth control movement, helping to transform it into a population control movement with racist and anti-feminist overtones. Both groups, while they made contributions to the technology of contraception, simultaneously held back the spread of birth control by transforming the campaign for it from a popular, participatory cause to a professional staff lobbying operation.\n\nA Tractor or an Automobile?

In 1900, smoking was invariably associated with sexually deviant womanhood. Today, smoking is firmly, if contentiously, established as a feminine practice in British society. This article examines one aspect of the twentieth-century feminisation of smoking in Britain, namely, the ways in which smoking practices have been presented as appropriate for young women in the period 1920-70. Advertisements featured in magazines for young women aged 15-29 years have been chosen as a particularly apt medium through which to explore some of the ways in which cigarettes and smoking practices have been delineated and infused with meaning. These advertisements constituted a discourse for the circulation of messages about the relationship of women to cigarettes. Findings reveal a number of shifts in cigarette advertisements featured in Women's magazines from 1920 to 1970. Firstly, during the 1930s and early 1940s, advertisements were, in contrast to later counterparts, preoccupied with establishing smoking as a feminine practice. Key to processes by which smoking was feminised were various mechanisms whereby the cigarette was depicted as part of the presentation of a heterosexual identity and where smoking practices were embedded in heterosexual relations and rituals. Secondly, there was a discernible shift in the way women were addressed by advertisements, from potential women smokers in the 1930s to more general consumers in the 1960s. Thirdly and relatedly, the significance attached to women smoking changed between 1920 and 1970. In the 1930s, smoking was utilised to signify that women were \"modern\"; in the period 1960-70, smoking served to indicate that women were recognised, and accorded status, as consumers.\n\nAfrican American Educators' Ideas and Practices for Increasing High School Graduation Rates, 1920-1940\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJuergensen, Miyoshi B.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study explores African American educators' ideas about school completion in the 1920s and 1930s as a way to begin to understand their contributions to the historical discourse on school completion.

This work explores the acceptance of these techniques in Chile. Starting in the late 19th century, the Chilean Medical Journal (Revista MÃ©dica de Chile) incorporated references to experiments with endocrine gland preparations that were being conducted in Europe at the time. An appropriation of the experiments by the Austrian Eugen Steinach began in 1920, with prominent figures such as the Italian professor Juan Noe Crevani and the young Chilean student Ottmar Wilhelm. Between 1922 and 1924, Wilhelm developed a series of experiments on dogs, bulls, pigs, rats and Welfare Board patients through the so-called Steinach operation, which consisted of the sectioning of the efferent channel in one of the testicles. Professor Noe's scientific patronage policy and Wilhelm's strategy of succession in the field led the latter to hold a chair in the new School of Medicine of Universidad de Concepci6n at the age of 25. From this position, the. figure of Wilhelm was fundamental for the development of a line of endocrinological research that was able to position Universidad de Concepci6n as a scientific development centre, which was strengthened by the arrival of another disciple of Steinach in Chile, the Latvian professor Alejandro LipschÃ¼tz.\n\nInsects, Food, and Hunger: The Paradox of Plenty for U.S. Entomology, 1920-1970.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPerkins, John H.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nExplores the relationship between invention/innovation in pest control practices, food supply, and hunger in the United States from 1920-1970.

Previous studies have demonstrated that leptospirosis is an endemic disease in Malaysia occurring in both urban and rural locations. The number of cases has risen dramatically since the Ministry of Health Malaysia highlighted leptospirosis as a notifiable disease in 2010, with reported cases increasing from 248 cases in 2004 to 3604 in 2012. The incidence of infection among the population suggests that occupation, sex, age, ethnic background, water recreational activities, and sporting events are risk factors. A robust surveillance system is now in place to monitor temporal and spatial changes in the incidence and prevalence of infection and to identify risk areas and disease behavior. Despite extensive studies over the past decade, there is a still a need to describe local serovars in host carriers and the human population, with the view to develop an effective vaccine against leptospirosis.

The current literature on the subject lacks publications presenting these issues fully. Based on historical sources from that period, including articles published in medical magazines, the incidence rate, the methods and results of the battle against that epidemic were depicted. The article represents an important contribution to a better insight in the struggle of Polish medical services with infectious diseases afflicting people in the first years following the end of World War I. It also sheds light on the development of Polish studies on infectious diseases in the Second Polish Republic, the scientistsâ belief in the successful treatment of epidemic diseases and understanding of the need to educate people about the rules of hygiene and taking medicines.\n\nFrontier nurse-midwives and antepartum emergencies, 1925 to 1939.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchminkey, Donna L; Keeling, Arlene W\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis article examines how the Frontier Nursing Service (FNS) utilized nurse-midwives to respond to antepartum emergencies such as preterm birth, eclampsia, malpresentation, and hemorrhage in the women of Appalachia in the years 1925 to 1939. Particular attention is given to the preparation that nurse-midwives received during their midwifery education to prevent and respond to emergencies. Using traditional historical research methods and primary source material from the FNS papers in the Special Collections, University of Kentucky Libraries, Lexington, Kentucky, this article describes the nurse-midwives' experiences and how they implemented skills they had learned during their training in Great Britain. Working in the isolated mountainous area of Leslie County, Kentucky-for the most part without direct assistance from physicians-FNS nurse-midwives decreased maternal and neonatal mortality rates. During their first 2000 births, they had only 2 maternal deaths, whereas the national average maternal mortality rate was approximately 7 deaths per 1000 births. The nurse-midwives performed external cephalic versions on a routine basis. For pregnancy and birth emergencies, they administered sedation, gave general anesthesia, and performed invasive lifesaving techniques in order to protect the lives of the women in their care. During these 14 years, their cross-cultural engagement, assessment skills, clinical judgment, and timely interventions improved maternal and child health throughout the region.

Miller (1920-2012).\n\nPubMed\n\nPinker, Steven\n\n2013-09-01\n\nPresents an obituary for George A. Miller (1920-2012). Miller ranks among the most important psychologists of the 20th century. In addition to writing one of the best known papers in the history of psychology (\"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information,\" published in Psychological Review in 1956), Miller also fomented the cognitive revolution, invented psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology, imported powerful ideas from the theories of information, communication, grammar, semantics, and artificial intelligence, and left us a sparkling oeuvre that proves that a rigorous scientist needn't write in soggy prose. Honors rained down on Miller. APA gave him the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions (1963), the American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in Psychological Science (1990), the William James Book Award (1992, for The Science of Words), and the Award for Lifetime Contributions to Psychology (2003), and named a prize after him, as did the Cognitive Neuroscience Society. Miller was also honored by the Association for Psychological Science and the American Speech and Hearing Association. In 2000, he won the John P. McGovern Award in the Behavioral Sciences from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1991, the National Medal of Science, the country's highest scientific honor.
