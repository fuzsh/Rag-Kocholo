        "text": "Itâs been awhile since Petra and I sat down for a mocktail and a recorded conversation. This week weâre bringing you a legit drink created by a private chef and the author of the Real Food Sanity Substack, Christi Flaherty.\n\nHere's Christi Flahertyâs recipe for a Watermelon CoolerÂ\n\nSingle MocktailÂ\n\n2 oz watermelon juice*Â 3/4 oz lime juiceÂ 1/4 oz honey syrup (equal parts honey and water shaken together until honey dissolves)Â 2-3 sprigs of mintÂ Club soda**Â\n\nBatch Mix for 4Â 8 oz watermelon juice*Â 3 oz lime juice (about 1/3 cup)Â 1 oz honey syrup (about 2 tbsp)Â\n\n2-3 sprigs of mintÂ Club soda**Â\n\nFor single Mocktail:Â\n\nMuddle (mash) the mint in a cocktail shaker. Add the juices, honey syrup and a little ice. Shake well then strain over ice in a short glass (lowball) top off the Topo Chico.Â\n\nIf you donât have a cocktail shaker, just muddle the mint in the bottom of a glass, simply add ice cubes in the juices and honey syrup, stir then top off the top of Chico.Â\n\nChristi Flaherty of Real Food Sanity\n\nAbout Christi Flaherty\n\nFor 20 years private chef and holistic nutritionist, Christi Flaherty cooked for families and created multi-course wine pairing dinners in both Napa Valley and the Dallas areas. She recently realized her passion for teaching people to cook outweighed her love of cooking FOR people. A former Whole30 Certified Coach, Christi began developing gluten, dairy and soy free recipes as well as real food driven mocktails for private cooking classes, weekly meal plans and her blog. Her recent move to Substack brings her weekly recipes and essays on the food & human connection to her publication Real Food Sanity with weekly meal plans and cooking classes for paid subscribers in the works.\n\nLinks in this episode:\n\n* Links to Eruption are in this post\n\n* I Lived - One Republic\n\n* Civil War\n\n* Masters of the Air\n\n* Humpback Whales\n\n* Sophia Jensenâs Road to Paris\n\nThis is a public episode.
