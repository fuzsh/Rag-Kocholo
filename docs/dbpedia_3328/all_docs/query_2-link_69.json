        "text": "Traditional study designs used for foodborne illness outbreaks are often time and resource heavy. With limited data, the binomial distribution may provide an alternative method to case-control studies for hypothesizing implicated foods. This session will present the findings from a binomial distribution, used during a recent outbreak of Salmonella at a local retail food establishment. We will discuss the methods, interpretations, strengths, and limitations of using this technique in an outbreak investigation setting.\n\nThe Attitudes and Behaviors on Health (TABS on Health) Survey, conducted in 2015, included two new modules: built environment and barriers to healthy eating and active living. TABS on Health provides information on individuals living throughout the state of Colorado. Data shared within this session will include regional data and select disparities in built environment access and use and barriers to physical activity and nutrition for individuals and families.\n\nMental Health First Aid and Youth Mental Health First Aid (MHFA/YMHFA) aim to increase laypersons’ mental health literacy, reduce stigma, and encourage appropriate intervention. There is evidence that MHFA/YMHFA significantly increases participants’ self-efficacy in the short-term, however there is less evidence that trainees actually use their new skills to help people experiencing behavioral health crises. Results of a follow-up evaluation that measured trainee application of the skills taught in Y/MHFA will be shared.\n\nThis presentation discusses the development of a Community Advisory group for behavioral healthcare services for Latinos in Colorado. We’ll present information on group development as an academic, community, regulation agency, and stakeholder group partnership. We’ll present recruitment, develop, and start-up methods, and overcoming obstacles to group participation. Initial findings and ongoing development of potential research and clinical methods of improving Latino mental health services, e-health engagement, and other related resources will be discussed.\n\nWith the legalization of retail marijuana in Colorado, there is concern that more people are driving while high. Three different sources of survey data were obtained to learn about marijuana use and driving patterns: Healthy Kids Colorado Survey (HKCS), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) survey. Data was also obtained on motor vehicle crashes where drivers tested positive for marijuana. Survey and crash data results will be presented.\n\nAt this networking lunch, sponsored by CALPHO and the Colorado Trust, members of the MDPH Health Equity Workgroup will discuss their experiences over the past year as part of this unique cross-jurisdictional team. Learn about how these six metro-area LPHAs are collaborating to address their region’s shared health equity concerns.\n\nRSVP Here\n\nHealthy Child Care Colorado, a statewide resource for child care health consultants (CCHCs), consisting of medical professionals assisting early childhood programs with health and safety standards, and researchers from CU, will share the findings of the recent needs assessment to better understand the clinical practices, education gaps, and desired supports for the nurses and physician who serve as CCHCs. We will share next steps to improve supports and professionalize child care health consultation in Colorado.\n\nThe 2013 and 2016 Larimer County Community Health Assessments measured local impacts after a national health policy, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was implemented. We found dramatic changes in health insurance coverage and access to and affordability of medical, dental and mental healthcare. Assessment data was shared with community members and stakeholders during the debate over repeal and/or replace the ACA. Lessons from using local data to inform changes in health policies will be shared.\n\nAcademic Health Department is a term use to “describe an affiliation between a health department and an academic health professions institution.” This program showcase will describe how Jefferson County Public health, a local health department, developed a clinical scholar program and created a designated staff position to better coordinate student activities with universities, enhance students learning through comprehensive clinical and creative projects, and bridge the gap between academics and practice.\n\nThe Smart Mouths Smart Kids (SMSK) is an initiative of Oral Health Colorado. SMSK focuses on decreasing oral health disparities and supporting school readiness for Colorado’s children by developing tools to initiate and sustain school-linked oral health programs and connect children to a permanent dental home.\n\nCollaborating communities provided the foundation on which SMSK was built, and guided the development of tools to support accurate data collection, longitudinal surveillance, business planning and financial sustainability.\n\nMeaningful community engagement can be challenging, but it doesn’t have to be. Community wisdom is necessary for health & we should offer opportunities for communities to exercise power in decision-making. But how do we do this? The Colorado Office of Health Equity has developed relevant tools & techniques to help public health practitioners plan meaningful public participation. Join us to learn about strategies for arriving at effective solutions with community & to workshop real-life scenarios.\n\nThis session will cover how to develop an action plan to impact the priority areas your community wants to address. Learn how to start with a measurable outcome or goal and develop a strategy map and action plans with community partners. We'll present different options for tracking, sharing and measuring this information- including the Thriving Colorado Dashboard. You'll walk away with new resources and we'll use your feedback to continue to develop CHAPS guidance.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of how the Vida Sana: United for Health Equity coalition in Fort Collins has implemented community health worker/promotora programming at the neighborhood level to increase access to health services while simultaneously working on systems and policy changes to improve infrastructure, transportation, housing, childcare and funding for other social determinants of health. Participants will learn about community engagement strategies and how Vida Sana has moved from program to policy change.\n\nUse of electronic vapor products and electronic smoking devices has increased among youth and adults in recent years. This session will characterize Colorado e-vapor product users, assess disparities in use, and reveal co-use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana and reasons for use among adults based on data from the 2015 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey and the 2016 Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Community strategies to address this emerging public health challenge will be described.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding how to advance equity, one can easily feel confused about where to start. The Colorado Office of Health Equity developed “Sweet Tools to Advance Equity”, to take equity from theory to action. What makes them so sweet?
