        "text": "Association of knowledge on ART line of treatment, scarcity of treatment options and adherence.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamadhani, Habib O; Muiruri, Charles; Maro, Venance P; Omondi, Michael; Mushi, Julian B; Lirhunde, Eileen S; Bartlett, John A\n\n2016-07-15\n\nAdherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is critical piece in the management of HIV infected patients. Despite the benefits of ART, non-adherence to ART persists. This study explores association between patient's knowledge of the ART line of treatment, availability of future treatment options and adherence. A cross sectional survey of HIV infected adolescent and adults was conducted. Cumulative optimal and sub-optimal adherence was defined as percentage adherence of â¥â95Â % and <â95Â %, respectively. Binomial regression models were used to assess the association of patient's knowledge of the ART line of treatment, availability of future treatment options and adherence. Of the 402 patients reviewed, 101 (25.1Â %) patients knew their ART line of treatment and were aware that future treatment options are limited. Compared to those who were not aware of the ART line of treatment and/or scarcity of future treatment options, those who were aware were more likely to be adherent (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR], 1.1; 95Â % CI, 1.0-1.3). The study reports knowledge of patient's ART line of treatment and future treatment options is important indicator of adherence to ART. Although majority of the patients did not have the knowledge, those who had the knowledge demonstrated to be more adherent. It is critical for the physicians/health care providers in these settings to clearly educate patients about ART line of treatment and limited availability of future treatment options as such information is likely to influence individual behavior and improve patient's adherence to ART.\n\nAn update on adjunctive treatment options for bipolar disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nDean, Olivia M; Gliddon, Emma; Van Rheenen, Tamsyn E; Giorlando, Francesco; Davidson, Sandra K; Kaur, Manreena; Ngo, Trung T; Williams, Lana J\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBipolar disorder is a complex illness often requiring combinations of therapies to successfully treat symptoms. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in a number of therapies for bipolar disorder. It is therefore timely to provide an overview of current adjunctive therapeutic options to help treating clinicians to inform their patients and work towards optimal outcomes. Publications were identified from PubMed searches on bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy, nutraceuticals, hormone therapy, psychoeducation, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, cognitive remediation, mindfulness, e-Health and brain stimulation techniques. Relevant articles in these areas were selected for further review. This paper provides a narrative review of adjunctive treatment options and is not a systematic review of the literature. A number of pharmacotherapeutic, psychological and neuromodulation treatment options are available. These have varying efficacy but all have shown benefit to people with bipolar disorder. Due to the complex nature of treating the disorder, combination treatments are often required. Adjunctive treatments to traditional pharmacological and psychological therapies are proving useful in closing the gap between initial symptom remission and full functional recovery. Given that response to monotherapy is often inadequate, combination regimens for bipolar disorder are typical. Correspondingly, psychiatric research is working towards a better understanding of the disorder's underlying biology. Therefore, treatment options are changing and adjunctive therapies are being increasingly recognized as providing significant tools to improve patient outcomes. Towards this end, this paper provides an overview of novel treatments that may improve clinical outcomes for people with bipolar disorder. Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a possible treatment in the future.\n\nMedial tibial stress syndrome: conservative treatment options.\n\nPubMed\n\nGalbraith, R Michael; Lavallee, Mark E\n\n2009-10-07\n\nMedial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), commonly known as \"shin splints,\" is a frequent injury of the lower extremity and one of the most common causes of exertional leg pain in athletes (Willems T, Med Sci Sports Exerc 39(2):330-339, 2007; Korkola M, Amendola A, Phys Sportsmed 29(6):35-50, 2001; Hreljac A, Med Sci Sports Exerc 36(5):845-849, 2004). Although often not serious, it can be quite disabling and progress to more serious complications if not treated properly. Often, the cause of MTSS is multi-factorial and involves training errors and various biomechanical abnormalities. Few advances have been made in the treatment of MTSS over the last few decades. Current treatment options are mostly based on expert opinion and clinical experience. The purpose of this article is to review published literature regarding conservative treatment options for MTSS and provide recommendations for sports medicine clinicians for improved treatment and patient outcomes.\n\nTreatment options for chronic pancreatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nIssa, Yama; Bruno, Marco J; Bakker, Olaf J; Besselink, Marc G; Schepers, Nicolien J; van Santvoort, Hjalmar C; Gooszen, Hein G; Boermeester, Marja A\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThis Review covers the latest developments in the treatment options for chronic pancreatitis. Pain is the most frequent and dominant symptom in patients with chronic pancreatitis, which ranges from severe disabling continuous pain to mild pain attacks and pain-free periods. Conventional treatment strategies and recent changes in the treatment of pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis are outlined. The different treatment options for pain consist of medical therapy, endoscopy or surgery. Their related merits and drawbacks are discussed. Finally, novel insights in the field of genetics and microbiota are summarized, and future perspectives are discussed.\n\nTreatment options for Primary CNS Lymphoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaghari, Altaf Ali; Ahmed, Syed Ijlal; Jabbar, Adnan; Shamim, Muhammad Shahzad\n\n2018-03-01\n\nPrimary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive brain tumour that is uniformly fatal. The rarity of the disease and the poor response to treatment makes it difficult to reach a consensus with regards to treatment options. In this review, the authors have discussed different treatment modalities used in the management of PCNSL including chemotherapy, surgery and radiation, as well as the results of recent clinical trials on treatment options for PCNSL.\n\nCancer prehabilitation: an opportunity to decrease treatment-related morbidity, increase cancer treatment options, and improve physical and psychological health outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilver, Julie K; Baima, Jennifer\n\n2013-08-01\n\nCancer prehabilitation, a process on the continuum of care that occurs between the time of cancer diagnosis and the beginning of acute treatment, includes physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identifies impairments, and provides targeted interventions that improve a patient's health to reduce the incidence and the severity of current and future impairments. There is a growing body of scientific evidence that supports preparing newly diagnosed cancer patients for and optimizing their health before starting acute treatments. This is the first review of cancer prehabilitation, and the purpose was to describe early studies in the noncancer population and then the historical focus in cancer patients on aerobic conditioning and building strength and stamina through an appropriate exercise regimen. More recent research shows that opportunities exist to use other unimodal or multimodal prehabilitation interventions to decrease morbidity, improve physical and psychological health outcomes, increase the number of potential treatment options, decrease hospital readmissions, and reduce both direct and indirect healthcare costs attributed to cancer. Future research may demonstrate increased compliance with acute cancer treatment protocols and, therefore, improved survival outcomes. New studies suggest that a multimodal approach that incorporates both physical and psychological prehabilitation interventions may be more effective than a unimodal approach that addresses just one or the other. In an impairment-driven cancer rehabilitation model, identifying current and anticipating future impairments are the critical first steps in improving healthcare outcomes and decreasing costs. More research is urgently needed to evaluate the most effective prehabilitation interventions, and combinations thereof, for survivors of all types of cancer.\n\nARSENIC TREATMENT OPTIONS\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe PPT presentation will provide information on the drinking water treatment options for small utilities to remove arsenic from ground water.

This review article addresses numerous topical treatment options such as retinoids, olumacostat glasaretil, and various cosmeceutical agents. several systemic and procedural techniques that incorporate isotretinoin, spironolactone, oral contraceptives, botulinum toxin, photodynamic therapy, and lasers are reviewed as well. Each treatment option is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanism of action, efficacy reported in the literature, and potential adverse effects.

This review is the result of a systemic approach to the literature and covers topical, intralesional, conventional systemic, and biologic systemic treatments, as well as non-pharmacological treatment options for nail psoriasis. The available evidence suggests that all anti-tumor necrosis factor-Î±, anti-interleukin (IL)-17, and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies which are available for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are highly effective treatments for nail psoriasis. Conventional systemic treatments, including methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, and apremilast, as well as intralesional corticosteroids, can also be effective treatments for nail psoriasis. Topical treatments, including corticosteroids, calcipotriol, tacrolimus, and tazarotene, have also been shown to have a position in the treatment of nail psoriasis, particularly in mild cases. Finally, non-pharmacological treatment options, including phototherapy, photodynamic therapy, laser therapy, and several radiotherapeutic options, are also reviewed but cannot be advised as first-line treatment options. Another conclusion of this review is that the lack of a reliable core set of outcomes measures for trials in nail psoriasis hinders the interpretation of results, and is urgently needed.\n\nHypochondriasis: treatment options for a diagnostic quagmire.\n\nPubMed\n\nStarcevic, Vladan\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThis article presents the conceptual and diagnostic conundrums surrounding hypochondriasis and reviews current treatment options for this disorder. The removal of hypochondriasis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition and its replacement with two new diagnostic entities have been controversial. It appears that the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases will take a more cautious approach and emphasise the links between hypochondriasis, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders. The cornerstone of any treatment approach to hypochondriasis is establishing a good therapeutic relationship with the patient. Psychological treatments, especially cognitive-behavioural therapy, have been more useful than pharmacotherapy, but there is much room for improving treatment outcomes.

We performed a review of articles pertaining to male infertility, fertility preservation, and genitourinary cancers. The aim was to review causes of infertility in patients with cancer, current options for fertility preservation, research that may expand preservation options, and ethical as well as medicolegal considerations. There are multiple causes of infertility in male patients with cancer, including the malignancy itself, and the treatments required to achieve a potential cure. Surgery can affect the normal pathways for erection, emission, and ejaculation. Chemotherapy can have a profound negative effect on spermatogenesis by causing chromosomal aberrations, maturation arrest, mutagenesis, and impaired spermatozoa motility. Radiation can cause cellular apoptosis with resultant reduction in spermatogonial stem cells. There are numerous methods to secure fertility before cancer treatment with the aid of cryopreservation ranging from simple patient-provided semen samples to complex sperm retrieval techniques. Research in the field of spermatogenic stem cells may lead to improved treatment options such as autotransplant of stem cells for repopulation of the testes after cancer treatment. Early discussion of possible fertility effects in patients undergoing genitourinary cancer treatment is critical in this era of increasing survivorship. Although current cancer treatments can cause infertility, there are well-established options for fertility preservation and current research will likely lead to improved treatment options.

Although multiple pathways have been proposed as causes of RCTA, the exact cause remains unclear. Increasing knowledge about the clinical diagnosis, imaging features, and indicators of severity improves recognition and treatment of this pathologic condition.\n\nIntegrated treatment options for male perpetrators of intimate partner violence.\n\nPubMed\n\nCrane, Cory A; Easton, Caroline J\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMale-to-female intimate partner violence remains a worldwide public health issue with adverse physical and psychological consequences for victims, perpetrators and children. Personality disorders, addiction, trauma and mood symptoms are established risk factors for intimate partner violence perpetration and factor prominently into a recovery-oriented treatment approach. We reviewed the partner violence literature for detailed reports of traditional as well as innovative, integrated treatment approaches. Empirically based recommendations for intervention programs and the policies that guide intervention efforts are offered. Nascent research suggests that integrated treatment models utilising a holistic approach to account for psychological comorbidity and interventions that involve a motivational interviewing component appear promising in terms of significantly improving intimate partner violence treatment compliance and reducing subsequent acts of physical partner violence. Further, methodologically rigorous research is required to fully assess the benefits of traditional and integrated treatment options. We have advanced several recommendations, including the development of and exclusive reliance upon empirically supported treatments, conducting a thorough risk and needs assessment of the offender and the immediate family to facilitate appropriate treatment referrals, integrating content to foster the offender's internal motivation to change maladaptive behaviours, and attempting to minimise offender treatment burdens through the strategic use of integrated treatment models. Intimate partner violence is a complicated and nuanced problem that is perpetrated by a heterogeneous population and requires greater variability in integrated treatment options.

Treatment options that produce meaningful and sustained weight loss and comorbidity resolution are urgently needed. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the current treatment options for pediatric severe obesity and offer suggestions regarding future opportunities for accelerating the development and evaluation of innovative treatment strategies. At present, there are three treatment options for youth with severe obesity: lifestyle modification therapy, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Lifestyle modification therapy can be useful for improving many chronic disease risk factors and comorbid conditions but often fails to achieve clinically meaningful and sustainable weight loss. Pharmacotherapy holds promise as an effective adjunctive treatment but remains in the primordial stages of development in the pediatric population. Bariatric surgery provides robust weight loss and risk factor/comorbidity improvements but is accompanied by higher risks and lower uptake compared to lifestyle modification therapy and pharmacotherapy. New areas worth pursuing include combination pharmacotherapy, device therapy, identification of predictors of response aimed at precision treatment, and interventions in the postbariatric surgical setting to improve long-term outcomes. Treating pediatric severe obesity effectively and safely is extremely challenging. Some progress has been made, but substantially more effort and innovation are needed in the future to combat this serious and ongoing medical and public health issue.

These lesions composed of blood vessels and fibrous tissue appear on the face at an early age. Since they have important physical and psychological repercussions for patients, several treatment options have been used to remove them or improve their appearance. However, the lack of treatment guidelines prevents us from developing a common protocol for patients with this condition. The present article aims to review the treatments for facial angiofibromas used to date and to propose a new evidence-based treatment protocol. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L. and AEDV.

The treatment of HCC is multidisciplinary involving hepatologists, surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, interventional radiologists, and other disciplines. Each of these disciplines brings its unique perspective and differing opinions that add to controversies in the management of HCC. A focused literature review was performed to identify recent studies on the management of HCC and thereby summarize relevant information on the various therapeutic modalities and controversies involved in the treatment of HCC. The main treatment algorithms continue to rely on hepatic resection or transplantation with controversies involving patients harboring early stage disease and borderline hepatic function. The other treatment strategies include locoregional therapies, radiation, and systemic therapy used alone or in combination with other treatment modalities. Recent advances in locoregional therapies, radiation, and systemic therapies have provided better therapeutic options with curative intent potential for some locoregional therapies. Further refinements in combination therapies such as algorithms consisting of locoregional therapies and systemic or radiation therapies are likely to add additional options and improve survival. The management of HCC has witnessed significant strides with advances in existing options and introduction of several new treatment modalities of various combinations. Further refinements in these treatment options combined with enrollment in clinical trials are essential to improve the management and outcomes of patients with HCC.\n\nQuality of online information on breast cancer treatment options.\n\nPubMed\n\nArif, Nadia; Ghezzi, Pietro\n\n2018-02-01\n\nOffering breast cancer patients treatment choice has become a priority as the involvement of patients in the decision-making process is associated with improved physical and psychological outcomes. As the Internet is increasingly being used by patients as a source of medical information, it is important to evaluate the quality of information relating to breast cancer on the Internet. We analysed 200 websites returned by google.co.uk searching \"breast cancer treatment options\" in terms of their typology and treatment options described. These were related to standard measures of health information quality such as the JAMA score and the presence of quality certifications, as well as readability. We found that health portals were of higher quality whilst commercial and professional websites were of poorer quality in terms of JAMA criteria. Overall, readability was higher than previously reported for other conditions, and Google ranked websites with better readability higher. Most websites discussed surgical and medical treatments. Few websites, with a large proportion being of commercial typology, discussed complementary and alternative medicine. Google ranked professional websites low whilst websites from non-profit organizations were promoted in the ranking. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the most recent diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, as put forth by the American College of Rheumatology will be summarized. Clinical features, including chronic widespread pain, hyperalgesia, mood disorders, anxiety, and disturbed sleep patterns will be explored in-depth. The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of fibromyalgia involves alterations in multiple ascending and descending central nervous system pathways, as well as peripheral pathways, leading to heightened pain sensitivity. Risk factors have been studied extensively, and the most recent research focuses on various genetic influences and the contributions of stress and poor sleep. Lastly, the discussion in this article focuses on treatment options for fibromyalgia; some have been mainstay options for many years. Pharmacological agents include tricyclic antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as some investigational agents. The evidence behind non-pharmacologic treatments, including massage therapy, exercise, and acupuncture, are discussed.\n\nTreatment Option Overview (Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Few mainstream treatment options are available for men with PPND and anxiety. The aim of this literature review was to summarize the current understanding of PPND and the treatment programs specifically designed for fathers with perinatal depression. Eight electronic databases were searched using a predefined strategy, and reference lists were also hand searched. PPND and anxiety were identified to have a negative impact on family relationships, as well as the health of mothers and children. Evidence suggests a lack of support and tailored treatment options for men having trouble adjusting to the transition to fatherhood. Of the limited options available, cognitive behavioral therapy, group work, and blended delivery programs, including e-support approaches appear to be most effective in helping fathers with perinatal depression and anxiety. The review findings have important implications for the understanding of PPND and anxiety. Future research is needed to address the adoption of father-inclusive and father-specific models of care to encourage fathers' help-seeking behavior. Inclusion of male-specific requirements into support and treatment options can improve the ability of services to engage new fathers. Psychotherapeutic intervention could assist to address the cognitive differences and dissonance for men adjusting to the role of father, including male identity and role expectations.\n\nNew Fathersâ Perinatal Depression and AnxietyâTreatment Options: An Integrative Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOâBrien, Anthony P.; McNeil, Karen A.; Fletcher, Richard; Conrad, Agatha; Wilson, Amanda J.; Jones, Donovan; Chan, Sally W.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMore than 10% of fathers experience depression and anxiety during the perinatal period, but paternal perinatal depression (PPND) and anxiety have received less attention than maternal perinatal mental health problems.

Apart from fresh, immature scars,that transform into mature scars over the course of would healing and that do not require further treatment,linear hypertrophic scars, widespread hypertrophic scars, keloids and atrophic scars exist. Symptoms like pruritusand pain, stigmatization as well as functional and aesthetic impairments that are very disturbing for the affected patients can bethe basis for the desire for treatment. Today, a multitude of options for the treatment and prevention of scars exists. Topical agents based on silicone or onion extract, intralesional injections of cristalline glucocorticoids (oftentimes in combinationwith cryotherapy) or 5-Fluorouracil as well as ablative and nonablative laser treatment are used. Current guidelines summarize the multitude of available treatment options and the currently available datafor the treating physicians, allowing them to make clear therapy recommendations for every single scar type. Relieving patients of their discomfort and doing their aesthetic demands justice is thus possible. Apart from scar prevention becoming more and more important, the increased use of modernlaser treatment options constitutes a key point in clinical scar treatment. At the same time the attention is turned to evaluating current therapeutic options with the help of contemporary study designs so as to graduallyimprove the level of evidence in scar treatment.

The aim of this outcome analysis was to assess the efficacy and patient preferences with regard to the currently recommended treatment options. All patients with microscopic evidence for Demodex blepharitis were informed about the currently published treatments and instructed about daily lid hygiene. Additional topical treatment options included tea tree oil (TTO) 5%, a cleansing foam containing 0.02% TTO (NaviblefÂ®), and metronidazole 2% ointment. Systemic treatment options included oral ivermectin 6âmg on day 1 and 14 and metronidazole 500âmg twice daily for 10 days. All patients were reviewed after 2 months for symptoms and for a mite count on 10 epilated lashes. Ninety-four of 96 patients with Demodex blepharitis opted for an additional treatment. The mean mite count after 2 months of treatment were 13.3 with 5% TTO (n=6), 12.0 with 0.02% TTO (n=38), 9.4 with metronidazole ointment (n=5), 12.8 with ivermectin (n=27) and 22.0 with oral metronidazole (n=5). While there are several published treatment options available, none of these options seem to be clearly effective in Demodex blepharitis.

However, there are still fundamental questions that require clarification to optimise their use and major unmet clinical needs that must be addressed. The advances obtained with the pharmacological options currently consolidated and the different approaches that are often used in an attempt to respond to unmet therapeutic needs are reviewed Expert opinion: In view of the unsatisfactory status of current treatments for COPD, there is an urgent need for alternative and more effective therapeutic approaches that will help to relieve patient symptoms and affect the natural course of COPD, inhibiting chronic inflammation and reversing the disease process or preventing its progression. However, new pharmacologic options have proved difficult to develop. Therefore, it is mandatory to optimize the use of the treatment options at our disposal. However, there are still fundamental questions regarding their use, including the step-up and step-down pharmacological approach, that require clarification to optimise the use of these drugs. It is likely that phenotyping COPD patients would help in identifying the right treatment for each COPD patient and improve the effectiveness of therapies.\n\nWaste battery treatment options: comparing their environmental performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nBriffaerts, K; Spirinckx, C; Van der Linden, A; Vrancken, K\n\n2009-08-01\n\nWaste consumer batteries are recycled using different routes based on hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes. Two hydrometallurgical and two pyrometallurgical treatment scenarios are compared starting from an average composition of Belgian waste batteries. The environmental performance is compared using life cycle analysis (LCA). The recycling rate is studied through mass balance calculation. Each treatment scenario results in a specific recycling rate. The environmental impact and benefits also vary between the treatment options. There is no such thing as a typical hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical treatment. When applying a hydrometallurgical treatment scenario, the focus lies on zinc and iron recycling. When allowing manganese recycling, the energy demand of the hydrometallurgical process increases considerably. Both pyrometallurgical options recycle zinc, iron and manganese. According to the LCA, none of the treatment scenarios performs generally better or worse than the others. Each option has specific advantages and disadvantages. The Batteries Directive 2006/66/EC sets out a recycling rate of 50% for consumer waste batteries. Based on metal recycling alone, the mass balances show that the target is difficult to obtain.\n\nAspiration and sclerotherapy: a nonsurgical treatment option for hydroceles.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrancis, John J; Levine, Laurence A\n\n2013-05-01\n\nWe demonstrated that hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy with doxycycline is an effective and safe nonsurgical treatment option for hydrocele correction. The medical records of patients who underwent hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy were analyzed in a retrospective cohort study for success rates as well as improvement in scrotal size and discomfort after a single hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy treatment. Patients who reported decreased scrotal size, improved physical symptoms and satisfaction with the procedure were considered as having success with hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy. A total of 29 patients (mean age 52.8 years) presenting with 32 nonseptated hydroceles underwent hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy with doxycycline between 2005 and 2012. Of the hydroceles 27 (84%) were successfully treated with a single aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure. Overall mean followup was 20.8 months. Three patients reported moderate pain which resolved in 2 to 3 days. Of those patients in whom hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy failed, 1 had hydrocele successfully resolved with a second aspiration and sclerotherapy treatment, 3 did not have success with a second procedure and underwent hydrocelectomy, and 1 wanted immediate surgical correction. Hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy was successful in correcting 84% of simple nonseptated hydroceles with a single treatment. This result is an increase from previously reported success rates involving a single hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure with tetracycline (75%). The success rate of a single hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure is similar to the reported success rates involving hydrocelectomy while avoiding the hospital expense and many other complications. We conclude that the hydrocele aspiration and sclerotherapy procedure is a reasonable, nonsurgical and underused treatment option for nonseptated simple hydroceles.

Objectives To test whether a decision aid improves quality of decision-making about feeding options in advanced dementia. Design Cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting 24 nursing homes in North Carolina Participants Residents with advanced dementia and feeding problems and their surrogates. Intervention Intervention surrogates received an audio or print decision aid on feeding options in advanced dementia. Controls received usual care. Measurements Primary outcome was the Decisional Conflict Scale (range 1â5) measured at 3 months; other main outcomes were surrogate knowledge, frequency of communication with providers, and feeding treatment use. Results 256 residents and surrogate decision-makers were recruited. Residentsâ average age was 85; 67% were Caucasian and 79% were women. Surrogatesâ average age was 59; 67% were Caucasian, and 70% were residentsâ children. The intervention improved knowledge scores (16.8 vs 15.1, p<0.001). After 3 months, intervention surrogates had lower Decisional Conflict Scale scores than controls (1.65 vs. 1.90, p<0.001) and more often discussed feeding options with a health care provider (46% vs. 33%, p=0.04). Residents in the intervention group were more likely to receive a dysphagia diet (89% vs.76%, p=0.04), and showed a trend toward increased staff eating assistance (20% vs.10%, p=0.08). Tube feeding was rare in both groups even after 9 months (1 intervention vs. 3 control, p=0.34). Limitations Cluster randomization was necessary to avoid contamination, but limits blinding and may introduce bias by site effect. Conclusion A decision aid about feeding options in advanced dementia reduced decisional conflict for surrogates and increased their knowledge and communication about feeding options with providers.

Many etiologies have been proposed including pudendal neuralgia. Multiple treatment options are used but the reported results are sub-optimal and temporary. In this article, we present the technique of pudendal nerve neuromodulation with neurophysiology guidance as a treatment option for RCPPP. This technique is a two-step procedure that includes electrode implantation under neurophysiology guidance followed by the implantation of a permanent generator after a successful trial period. We report the cases of three women who underwent this procedure as a last-resort treatment option. After 2 years of follow-up, their symptoms are still significantly improved. No major complication occurred.\n\nPANDAS: A systematic review of treatment options.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarhood, Zachary; Ong, Adrian A; Discolo, Christopher M\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS) is a rare but important condition for pediatric otolaryngologists to recognize. Several treatment options exist including tonsillectomy, antibiotic treatment/prophylaxis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and psychiatric medications/therapy. A systematic review of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases was performed searching for articles that focused exclusively on the aforementioned treatment modalities in the PANDAS population. Review articles, single patient case reports, and studies examining the natural history or diagnostic strategies were excluded. Five articles regarding tonsillectomy treatments with level of evidence (LOE) 4 were found but no clear benefit could be determined. Three articles were selected involving the use of antibiotic therapy. One prospective study and one double-blind randomized control trial (DB RCT) supported the use of antibiotics but a separate DB RCT showed no benefit. Two selected articles described the use of IVIG: one unblinded RCT and one retrospective study. One prospective study on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) showed benefit in PANDAS. There is a paucity of high-level studies regarding this rare disorder and no hard treatment recommendations can be made. Tonsillectomy should only be performed in those who are surgical candidates based on current published guidelines. Antibiotics are an option but provide uncertain benefit. CBT remains a low-risk option. Studies support the use of IVIG, however more investigation is needed prior to widespread adoption of this treatment given its potential risks.

AD significantly affects the quality of life. Not all patients respond to topical therapies, and often systemic therapy is required to control the disease. To review the treatment options for adult AD patients including those options for patients who do not respond adequately or have contraindications to oral systemic therapy. A working group of clinicians with experience managing AD was convened to review the current literature on treatment options for adult AD patients. This review is based on the best available evidence from a published systematic review and an additional literature search. Current treatments for AD are reviewed, including options for adult AD patients who do not respond or have contraindications to current systemic therapies. A new approach with targeted therapies is reviewed based on best available evidence. Many AD patients respond satisfactorily to topical or systemic treatments, but for those patients who do not respond or have contraindications, new biologic agents appear to be promising therapies.\n\nManaging AVN following internal fixation: treatment options and clinical results.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoskinson, Simon; Morison, Zachary; Shahrokhi, Shahram; Schemitsch, Emil H\n\n2015-03-01\n\nAvascular necrosis (AVN) after internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures is a progressive multifactorial disease that ultimately results in local ischemia with ensuing osteocyte necrosis and structural compromise. This disease can cause significant clinical morbidity and affects patients of any age, including young and active patients. Effective treatment of this condition among young adults is challenging due to their high functional demands. The aim of managing AVN is to relieve pain, preserve range of movement and improve function. Treatment methods vary depending on the stage of the disease and can be broadly categorised into two options, hip preserving surgery and hip arthroplasty. Although, hip preserving techniques are attractive in the young adult, they may alter the morphology of the proximal femur and make subsequent arthroplasty more challenging. Conversely, arthroplasty in the young adult may require repeat revision procedures throughout the patient's life. Current evidence suggests that modifications of prevailing treatments, in addition to new technologies, have led to the development of management strategies that may be able to alter the course of femoral head osteonecrosis. This review aims to summarise the options available for treatment of AVN in the young adult and review the clinical results. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

But eco-efficiency assessments have generally focused on a specific site, while neglecting wider effects, for example, through interactions between water users and wastewater treatment (WWT) providers. To address the methodological gap, the EcoWater project has developed a method and online tools for meso-level analysis of the entire water-service value chain. This study investigated improvement options in two large manufacturing companies which have significant potential for eco-efficiency gains. They have been considering investment in extra processes which can lower resource burdens from inputs and wastewater, as well as internalising WWT processes. In developing its methodology, the EcoWater project obtained the necessary information from many agents, involved them in the meso-level assessment and facilitated their discussion on alternative options. Prior discussions with stakeholders stimulated their attendance at a workshop to discuss a comparative eco-efficiency assessment for whole-system improvement. Stakeholders expressed interest in jointly extending the EcoWater method to more options and in discussing investment strategies. In such ways, optimal solutions will depend on stakeholders overcoming fragmentation by sharing responsibility and knowledge.\n\nLack of tolerable treatment options for patients with schizophrenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nCitrome, Leslie; Eramo, Anna; Francois, Clement; Duffy, Ruth; Legacy, Susan N; Offord, Steve J; Krasa, Holly B; Johnston, Stephen S; Guiraud-Diawara, Alice; Kamat, Siddhesh A; Rohman, Patricia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAtypical antipsychotics (AAs), an effective treatment for schizophrenia, have a range of pharmacologic properties leading to differences in tolerability as well as heterogeneity in treatment response. Individual patient characteristics must be considered when making treatment choices, especially from an adverse event (AE) or tolerability perspective. Despite the availability of numerous AAs, after appraising patient characteristics at the time of treatment selection, physicians may quickly run out of tolerable treatment options. AE risk factors, defined as having either a prior history of an AE or a risk factor for that AE, were determined for Medicaid-insured and Commercially insured patients using database analysis. Patients receiving AA treatment between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012 defined the index date of first observed AA prescription during this period. Nine AAs were evaluated for association with AE risk factors as informed by drug prescribing information from the different manufacturers and published meta-analyses. The proportion of patients with pre-index AE risk factors prescribed an AA associated with that risk factor was then determined. A high proportion of patients (>80%) were prescribed an AA associated with extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia despite experiencing extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia prior to AA treatment initiation. Similar trends were observed among patients with diabetes (>60%) and obesity (>40%). From the nine treatment options available, the number of optimal choices for individual patient segments were limited based on their prior history, including those with cardiometabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities (four); experiencing prolactin elevation-related problems (seven); needing to avoid excessive sedation (four); or at risk of extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia (two). Options were then further restricted among patients in more than one segment when multiple pre-index AE risk factors were combined.

Conservative treatment comes first unless the patient presents with an acute hemorrhoidal prolapse or a thrombosis. A fiber enriched diet is the primary treatment option, recommended in the perioperative period as well as a long-term prophylaxis. A timely limited application of topical ointments or suppositories and/or flavonoids are further treatment options. When symptoms persist interventional procedures for grade I-II hemorrhoids, and surgery for grade III-IV hemorrhoids should be considered. Rubber band ligation is the interventional treatment of choice. A comparable efficacy using sclerosing or infrared therapy has not yet been demonstrated. We therefore do not recommend these treatment options for the cure of hemorrhoids. Self-treatment by anal insertion of bougies is of lowrisk and may be successful, particularly in the setting of an elevated sphincter pressure. Anal dilation, sphincterotomy, cryosurgery, bipolar diathermy, galvanic electrotherapy, and heat therapy should be regarded as obsolete given the poor or missing data reported for these methods. For a long time, the classic excisional hemorrhoidectomy was considered to be the gold standard as far as surgical procedures are concerned. Primary closure (Ferguson) seems to be superior compared to the \"open\" version (Milligan Morgan) with respect to postoperative pain and wound healing. The more recently proposed stapled hemorrhoidopexy (Longo) is particularly advisable for circular hemorrhoids. Compared to excisional hemorrhoidectomy the Longo-operation is associated with reduced postoperative pain, shorter operation time and hospital stay as well as a faster recovery, with the disadvantage though of a higher recurrence rate. Data from Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation (HAL)-, if appropriate in combination with a Recto-Anal Repair (HAL/RAR)-, demonstrates a similar trend towards a better tolerance of the procedure at the\n\nTreatment options in otitis media with effusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nUpadhya, Ila; Datar, J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSecretary Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the accumulation of mucus in the middle ear and sometimes in the mastoid air cell system. The main etiological factor is alteration in mucociliary system of middle ear secondary to ET malfunction which may be primary or secondary. OME is the cause of concern due to its occurance in paediatric age group, highest at 2Â years of age, presenting as impairment of hearing leading to delayed speech and language development, poor academic performance and behavioral problems. In spite of this there are no confirmed guidelines of treatment to overcome. Many treatment options are available medical as well as surgical. Prospective study conducted to evaluate various treatment options revealed that auto inflation of ET is the main stay of treatment. If the ET malfunction is due to any reasons like adenoids, deviated nasal septum, hypertrophied turbinates or any other cause surgical intervention of the same gives 100% results. Medical management gives good results but recurrence is equally common.\n\nTreatment options for actinic keratoses.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcIntyre, William J; Downs, Michael R; Bedwell, Sondra A\n\n2007-09-01\n\nActinic keratoses are rough, scaly lesions that commonly occur on sun-exposed areas of the skin. The prevalence of the condition increases with age. Actinic keratoses are thought to be carcinomas in situ, which can progress to squamous cell carcinomas. The decision to treat can be based on cosmetic reasons; symptom relief; or, most importantly, the prevention of malignancy and metastasis. Treatment options include ablative (destructive) therapies such as cryosurgery, curettage with electrosurgery, and photodynamic therapy. Topical therapies are used in patients with multiple lesions. Fluorouracil has been the traditional topical treatment for actinic keratoses, although imiquimod 5% cream and diclofenac 3% gel are effective alternative therapies. There are too few controlled trials comparing treatment modalities for physicians to make sound, evidence-based treatment decisions.\n\nPatient knowledge on stroke risk factors, symptoms and treatment options.\n\nPubMed\n\nFaiz, Kashif Waqar; Sundseth, Antje; Thommessen, Bente; RÃ¸nning, Ole Morten\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPublic campaigns focus primarily on stroke symptom and risk factor knowledge, but patients who correctly recognize stroke symptoms do not necessarily know the reason for urgent hospitalization. The aim of this study was to explore knowledge on stroke risk factors, symptoms and treatment options among acute stroke and transient ischemic attack patients. This prospective study included patients admitted to the stroke unit at the Department of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Patients with previous cerebrovascular disease, patients receiving thrombolytic treatment and patients who were not able to answer the questions in the questionnaire were excluded. Patients were asked two closed-ended questions: \"Do you believe that stroke is a serious disorder?\" and \"Do you believe that time is of importance for stroke treatment?\". In addition, patients were asked three open-ended questions where they were asked to list as many stroke risk factors, stroke symptoms and stroke treatment options as they could. A total of 173 patients were included, of whom 158 (91.3%) confirmed that they regarded stroke as a serious disorder and 148 patients (85.5%) considered time being of importance. In all, 102 patients (59.0%) could not name any treatment option. Forty-one patients (23.7%) named one or more adequate treatment options, and they were younger ( p <0.001) and had higher educational level ( p <0.001), but had a nonsignificant shorter prehospital delay time ( p =0.292). The level of stroke treatment knowledge in stroke patients seems to be poor. Public campaigns should probably also focus on information on treatment options, which may contribute to reduce prehospital delay and onset-to-treatment-time.\n\nCyanobacterial Treatment Options: Permanganate and Powdered Activated Carbon\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThis presentation will begin with a brief overview of drinking water treatment options for cyanobacteria and their toxins.

Observational study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry comprising all US patients with CML diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 (N = 9,760). We quantified the option value of recent breakthroughs in CML treatment by first conducting retrospective survival analyses on SEER data to assess the effectiveness of TKI treatments, and then forecasting survival from CML and other causes to measure expected future medical progress. We then developed an analytical framework to calculate option value of innovative CML therapies, and used an economic model to value these gains. We calculated the option value created both by future innovations in CML treatment and by medical progress in reducing background mortality. For a recently diagnosed CML patient, the option value of innovative therapies from future medical innovation amounts to 0.76 life-years. This option value is worth $63,000, equivalent to 9% of the average survival gains from existing treatments. Future innovations in CML treatment jointly account for 96% of this benefit. The option value of innovative treatments has significance in the context of CML and, more broadly, in disease areas with rapid innovation. Incorporating option value into traditional valuations of medical innovations is both a feasible and a necessary practice in health technology assessment.\n\nOptions to improve energy efficiency for educational building\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJahan, Mafruha\n\nThe cost of energy is a major factor that must be considered for educational facility budget planning purpose. The analysis of energy related issues and options can be complex and requires significant time and detailed effort. One way to facilitate the inclusion of energy option planning in facility planning efforts is to utilize a tool that allows for quick appraisal of the facility energy profile. Once such an appraisal is accomplished, it is then possible to rank energy improvement options consistently with other facility needs and requirements. After an energy efficiency option has been determined to have meaningful value in comparison with other facility planning options, it is then possible to utilize the initial appraisal as the basis for an expanded consideration of additional facility and energy use detail using the same analytic system used for the initial appraisal. This thesis has developed a methodology and an associated analytic model to assist in these tasks and thereby improve the energy efficiency of educational facilities. A detailed energy efficiency and analysis tool is described that utilizes specific university building characteristics such as size, architecture, envelop, lighting, occupancy, thermal design which allows reducing the annual energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of various aspects of an educational building's energy performance can be complex and can require significant time and experience to make decisions. The approach developed in this thesis initially assesses the energy design for a university building. This initial appraisal is intended to assist administrators in assessing the potential value of energy efficiency options for their particular facility. Subsequently this scoping design can then be extended as another stage of the model by local facility or planning personnel to add more details and engineering aspects to the initial screening model. This approach can assist university planning efforts to\n\nTreatment Options to Manage Wound Biofilm\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJones, Curtis E.; Kennedy, John P.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Bioburden is an accepted barrier to chronic wound healing. Defining the significance, phenotype, clinical classification, and treatment guidelines has been historically lacking of evidence and based on paradigms that do not represent the scientific or clinical reality. The Problem Chronic wound bioburden is typically abundant, polymicrobial, and extremely diverse. These microbes naturally adopt biofilm phenotypes, which are quite often viable but not culturable, thereby going undetected. The failures of culture-based detection have led to abandonment of routine bioburden evaluation and aggressive treatment or, worse, to assume bioburden is not a significant barrier. Predictably, treatment regimens to address biofilm phenotypes lagged behind our diagnostic tools and understanding. Basic/Clinical Science Advances Microbial DNA-based diagnostic tools and treatment regimens have emerged, which provide and leverage objective information, resulting in a dramatic impact on outcomes. Relevance to Clinical Care Modern medicine demands decisions based on objective evidence. The diagnostic and treatment protocols reviewed herein empower clinicians to practice modern medicine with regard to bioburden, with DNA level certainty. Conclusion Bioburden is a significant barrier to healing for all chronic wounds. Molecular diagnostics provide the first objective means of assessing wound bioburden. The accuracy and comprehensive data from such diagnostic methodologies provide clinicians with the ability to employ patient-specific treatment options, targeted to each patient's microbial wound census. Based on current outcomes data, the most effective therapeutic options are topical (TPL) antibiofilm agents (ABF) combined with TPL antibiotics (ABX). In specific patients, systemic ABX and selective biocides are also appropriate, but not exclusive of ABF combined with TPL ABX.

A minority of them is caused by a myriad of other etiologies including infection, malignancy, and radiation. While some fistulas may close spontaneously, most patients will eventually need surgery to resolve this pathology. Successful treatment entails adoption of various methods of treatment aimed at control of sepsis, protection of surrounding skin and soft tissue, control of fistula output, and maintenance of nutrition, with eventual spontaneous or surgical closure of the fistula. The aim of this article is to review the various treatment options in their appropriate context.

This situation has generated an interest in finding novel approaches of combining statins with other lipid-lowering agents, or finding new lipid and non-lipid targets, such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen or C-reactive protein. The recent results from the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) demonstrated an incremental clinical benefit when ezetimibe, a non-statin agent, was added to simvastatin therapy. The results from IMPROVE-IT revalidated the concept that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are a clinically relevant treatment goal. This trial also suggested that further decrease of LDL-C levels (53 vs. 70Â mg/dl; 1.4 vs. 1.8Â mmol/l) was more beneficial in lowering CV events. This \"even lower is even better\" evidence for LDL-C levels may influence future guidelines and the use of new drugs. Furthermore, these findings make ezetimibe a more realistic option to treat patients with statin intolerance or those who cannot achieve LDL-C targets with statin monotherapy.\n\n78 FR 8060 - Treatment of Grantor of an Option on a Partnership Interest\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-02-05\n\n...

Bilateral VFP (BVFP) is characterized by inspiratory dyspnea due to narrowing of the airway at the glottic level with both vocal folds assuming a paramedian position. The primary objective of intervention for BVFP is to relieve patientsâ dyspnea. Common clinical options for management include tracheostomy, arytenoidectomy and cordotomy. Other options that have been used with varying success include reinnervation techniques and botulinum toxin (Botox) injections into the vocal fold adductors. More recently, research has focused on neuromodulation, laryngeal pacing, gene therapy, and stem cell therapy. These newer approaches have the potential advantage of avoiding damage to the voicing mechanism of the larynx with an added goal of restoring some physiologic movement of the affected vocal folds. However, clinical data are scarce for these new treatment options (i.e., reinnervation and pacing), so more investigative work is needed. These areas of research are expected to provide dramatic improvements in the treatment of BVFP.

Total elbow arthroplasty must be delayed for as long as possible. Therapy starts with nonoperative treatment. If this fails, operative options can be discussed. The aim of surgery is to provide aÂ functional range of motion with acceptable pain without obstructing future treatment options. Patients with pain at terminal extension and/or flexion may benefit from arthroscopic or open debridement. Patients with advanced osteoarthritis and pain throughout the complete range of motion, who are too young for total elbow arthroplasty, are offered interposition arthroplasty or arthrodesis. Arthrodesis of the elbow leads to significant restrictions in daily life due to the complete loss of extension/flexion. Therefore, arthrodesis is only offered as treatment in exceptional circumstances. Interposition arthroplasty is aÂ reasonable option for the young patient without significant bony defects, which may provide aÂ stable, functional flexion arc with an acceptable pain level. Interposition arthroplasty preserves the revision options of re-interposition arthroplasty as well as the withdrawal to total elbow arthroplasty. Partial and total elbow arthroplasty are treatment options of elbow arthritis but are not subjects of this article.\n\nThe safety of treatment options available for gout.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchlesinger, Naomi\n\n2017-04-01\n\nGout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in humans. Gout treatment includes rapid initiation of anti-inflammatory medications for acute attacks and chronically treating with urate lowering drugs as well as chronic anti-inflammatory prophylaxis. Areas covered: This review aims to provide an overview and discussion of the safety concerns of current treatment options available for gout. Expert opinion: Gout is a curable disease with appropriate treatment. The advent of new therapies provides encouraging opportunities to improve gout management. However, clinicians should be aware of some of the safety concerns of medications used to treat acute and chronic gout. When prescribing medications for gout one has to be mindful of the presence of comorbidities commonly affecting gout patients that may affect drug safety and efficacy, especially in the elderly and in patients treated with multiple drugs. The benefits of gout drugs, usually, outweigh their safety concerns. Studies are needed in gout patients with chronic kidney disease and/or cardiovascular disease, so that escalation of dosing /combination of anti-inflammatory drugs needed to suppress gouty inflammation as well as escalation of dosing/combination of urate lowering drugs needed to achieve target serum urate level will lead to better understanding of gout treatment safety issues.\n\nNew and Emerging Treatment Options for Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLacy, Brian E.; Chey, William D.; Lembo, Anthony J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, or a mix of symptoms. The pathophysiology of IBS is not completely understood but appears to involve genetics, the gut microbiome, immune activation, altered intestinal permeability, and brain-gut interactions. There is no gold standard for diagnosis. Several sets of symptom-based guidelines exist. Treatment strategies for IBS may include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. Lifestyle modifications that aim to improve exercise, sleep, diet, and stress may be warranted. Recent data suggest that a gluten-free diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) may benefit some patients. For patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, treatment options include the synthetic peripheral Î¼-opioid receptor agonist loperamide, antispasmodic agents, antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT3 antagonists, and the gut-specific antibiotic rifaximin. Ongoing research is evaluating the use of probiotics. For patients with constipation-predominant IBS, therapeutic strategies may include dietary fiber, laxatives, and the prosecretory agents lubiprostone and linaclotide. Research is continuing to optimize the use of available agents and evaluating new approaches to further improve the care of patients with IBS.

They can also be affected by other hereditary bleeding diatheses such as von Willebrand disease, platelet dysfunction defects or deficiencies of coagulation factors (F) such as FI, FII, FV, FVII, FX, FXI and FXIII. In addition to general bleeding symptoms, such disorders pose unique problems for women due to their impact on reproductive health. Women and adolescent girls with undiagnosed bleeding disorders frequently experience heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB; menorrhagia), leading to impairment of daily activities. Other gynaecological and obstetric manifestations, for example miscarriage, bleeding during pregnancy and postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), can occur. Treatment for HMB should consider patient wishes relating to preservation of fertility, and management options include hormonal measures, desmopressin, antifibrinolytics, platelet concentrate transfusions and clotting factor therapy. During pregnancy, monitoring clotting factor levels informs the need for prophylactic therapy; subsequent haemostatic cover can minimise PPH. Under-recognition of bleeding disorders in females may lead to inappropriate, or lack of, treatment. This may be avoided by increased disease awareness, prompt and accurate diagnosis, and a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. This review considers the range of hereditary bleeding disorders that may affect women and adolescent girls, and their evaluation and management. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

About 90% of lung cancer cases are caused by smoking and the use of tobacco products. However, other factors such as radon gas, asbestos, air pollution exposures, and chronic infections can contribute to lung carcinogenesis. In addition, multiple inherited and acquired mechanisms of susceptibility to lung cancer have been proposed. Lung cancer is divided into two broad histologic classes, which grow and spread differently: small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Treatment options for lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Therapeutic-modalities recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer. Despite the improvements in diagnosis and therapy made during the past 25 years, the prognosis for patients with lung cancer is still unsatisfactory. The responses to current standard therapies are poor except for the most localized cancers. However, a better understanding of the biology pertinent to these challenging malignancies, might lead to the development of more efficacious and perhaps more specific drugs. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent developments in lung cancer biology and its therapeutic strategies, and discuss the latest treatment advances including therapies currently under clinical investigation.

An experimental, randomized, controlled study was conducted on 45 patients (female 67%; Mean age: 40.5 years) diagnosed with chronic blepharitis, in order to compare the effectiveness of three treatment options. Group 1: eyelid hygiene with neutral shampoo three times/day; group 2: neutral shampoo eyelid hygiene plus topical metronidazole gel 0.75% twice/day; group 3: neutral eyelid hygiene with shampoo plus neomycin 3.5% and polymyxin 10% antibiotic ointment with 0.5% dexamethasone 3 times/day. The symptoms and signs were assessed by assigning scores from 0: no symptoms and/or signs; 1: mild symptoms and/or signs, 2: moderate symptoms and/or signs; and 3: severe symptoms and/or signs. A significant improvement was observed in the signs and symptoms in all 3 treatment groups. While groups 1 and 2 had more improvement in all variables studied (P<.05), Group 3 showed no clinical improvement for itching (P=.16), dry eye (P=.29), eyelashes falling (P=.16), and erythema at the eyelid margin (P=.29). Shampoo eyelid hygiene neutral and neutral shampoo combined with the use of metronidazole gel reported better hygiene results than neutral shampoo lid with antibiotic ointment and neomycin and polymyxin dexamethasone.

Fertility preservation options are available for pre- and postpubertal cancer patients; however, many providers lack knowledge regarding options. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of current evidence and recommendations regarding fertility preservation options for children, adolescents, and young adults undergoing cancer treatment. A systematic search was performed to identify fertility preservation evidence. Fifty-three studies and 4 clinical guidelines were used for the review. Final recommendations consisted of 2 strong and 1 weak recommendation for both female and male fertility preservation options. The treatment team should be knowledgeable about fertility preservation so that they can educate patients and families about available fertility preservation options. It is important to consider and discuss all available fertility options with patients at the time of diagnosis.

IBD is caused by an inappropriate immune response to gut microbiota. Treatment options could therefore be prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and/or fecal transplant. In this review, we have looked at the evidence for the yeast S. boulardii as a treatment option. Searches in PubMed and the Cochrane Library with the MeSH words 'Saccharomyces boulardii AND IBD', 'Saccharomyces boulardii AND Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Saccharomyces boulardii AND ulcerative colitis' and 'Saccharomyces boulardii AND Crohn's disease' gave total a total of 80 articles. After exclusions because of irrelevance, articles in other languages and some articles that were not available, 16 articles were included in this review. Three of the clinical trials showed a positive effect of S. boulardii in IBD patients (two Crohn's disease, one ulcerative colitis), while there was one trial that didn't prove any effect (Crohn's disease). Included Animal trials and cell assays describes different anti-inflammatory mechanisms of S. boulardii supporting a possible effect when treating IBD patients. The number of studies of S. boulardii as treatment for IBD is limited. Furthermore, the existing trials have small populations and short duration. We do not have enough evidence to prove the effect of S. boulardii in IBD. Saccharomyces boulardii is, however, a plausible treatment option in the future, but more placebo-controlled clinical studies on both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are needed.\n\nSurgical Treatment as a First Option of the Lower Eyelid Xanthelasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nObradovic, Bojan\n\n2017-10-01\n\nXanthelasma palpebrarum represents yellowish plaques, which mostly appear near the inner cantus of the eyelid.

The core features of DMDD are temper outbursts (manifested by either verbal rages and/or physical aggression) and unrelenting irritability or anger. Currently, the literature is lacking a thorough review of the possible treatment options for the cardinal symptoms constituting DMDD. The objective of this article is to provide a thorough review of peer-reviewed studies on the subject of pharmacological treatment options for children and adolescents with the cardinal symptoms of DMDD. Methods: Relevant articles for this study were obtained through Pubmed, Medline, PsychINFO and PsychINDEXplus using the key words: âadolescents,â âchildren,â âpaediatric,â âyouth,â âirritability,â âtemper outbursts,â âaggression,â ârage,â âdisruptive behaviour,â âtreatment,â âdysphoria,â âautism,â âmental retardation/intellectual disability,â âimpulsivity,â âADHD,â âoppositional defiant disorder,â and âconduct disorder.â A total of 823 studies were generated; only English studies focusing on pharmacological treatment were retained. Results: Currently there are no established guidelines or thorough reviews summarizing the treatment of DMDD. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment options of both aggression and chronic irritability include: antidepressants/selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, psychostimulants, antipsychotics, and alpha-2 agonists. Conclusion: Treatment options of severe, persistent irritability in youth are numerous, and a consensual treatment algorithm has not yet emerged from the literature. Further studies and clinical trials are warranted to determine efficacious and safe treatment modalities.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been accepted as a gold standard for surgical treatment while carotid artery stenting (CAS) has recently become an alternative option. Each treatment option has advantages and disadvantages for the treatment outcomes. We propose a protocol for selection of a proper surgical treatment option for carotid artery stenosis. A total of 192 published articles on management of carotid artery stenosis were reviewed. Preoperatively considerable factors which had been repeatedly noted in those articles for the risk/benefits of CEA or CAS were selected. According to those factors, a protocol with four categories was established. CEA or CAS is indicated when the patient has a symptomatic stenosis â¥ 50%, or when the patient has an asymptomatic stenosis â¥ 80%. Each treatment option has absolute indications and favorable indications. Each absolute indication is scored with three points, and each favorable indication, one point. Based on the highest scores, a proper treatment option (CEA or CAS) is selected. We have been treating patients according to this protocol and evaluating the outcomes of our protocol-based decision because this protocol might be helpful in assessment of risk/benefit for selection of a proper surgical treatment option in patients with carotid artery stenosis.\n\nParentsâ Online Portrayals of Pediatric Treatment and Research Options\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchaffer, Rebecca; Henderson, Gail E.; Churchill, Larry R.; King, Nancy M. P.; Rothschild, Barbra B.; Lohser, Sara; Davis, Arlene M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nParents of seriously ill children face difficult decisions when standard therapies are limited or ineffective. In their search for information, they may turn to websites created by other parents facing similar experiences. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of 21 websites created by families with children affected by cancer or genetic disease, two serious conditions with a range of treatment and clinical trial options. Our research questions address how parent authors portray serious pediatric illness, available options, parties to decision making, and sources of influence. In addition, we examine what these sites reveal about family vulnerability to various risks, particularly the risk of misunderstanding the distinction between standard treatment and research and the risk of overestimating the likely benefits of research participation, as well as whether vulnerability varies by type of condition. Our results demonstrate typically favorable views on research, but with inadequate distinctions between research and treatment and a complex set of trade-offs in consideration of research risks and potential benefits. While portraits of vulnerability emerge for both parents and children, so do portraits of strength and resilience. As a result, parents describe frustration with both under- and over-protection from research participation. Our discussion of these findings clarifies the potential for parent-authored websites to inform and influence families considering research and treatment options for their seriously ill children.

Several treatment options are available today, most of which are associated with high efficacy rates and favourable safety profiles. A MEDLINE search was undertaken in order to evaluate all currently available data on treatment modalities for ED. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) are currently the first-choice of most physicians and patients for the treatment of ED. PDE5 inhibitors have differences in their pharmacological profiles, the most obvious being the long duration of action of tadalafil, but there are no data supporting superiority for any one of them in terms of efficacy or safety. Sublingual apomorphine has limited efficacy compared with the PDE5 inhibitors, and its use is limited to patients with mild ED. Treatment failures with oral drugs may be due to medication, clinician and patient issues. The physician needs to address all of these issues in order to identify true treatment failures. Patients who are truly unresponsive to oral drugs may be offered other treatment options.Intracavernous injections of alprostadil alone, or in combination with other vasoactive agents (papaverine and phentolamine), remain an excellent treatment option, with proven efficacy and safety over time. Topical pharmacotherapy is appealing in nature, but currently available formulations have limited efficacy. Vacuum constriction devices may be offered mainly to elderly patients with occasional intercourse attempts, as younger patients show limited preference because of the unnatural erection that is associated with this treatment modality. Penile prostheses are generally the last treatment option offered, because of invasiveness, cost and non-reversibility; however, they are associated with high satisfaction rates in properly selected patients. All treatment options are associated with particular strengths and weaknesses.

These selective agents work by relaxing the trabecular meshwork through inhibition of the actin cytoskeleton contractile tone of smooth muscle. This results in increased aqueous outflow directly through the trabecular meshwork, achieving lower intraocular pressures in a range similar to prostaglandins. There are also animal studies indicating that ROCK inhibitors may improve blood flow to the optic nerve, increase ganglion cell survival, and reduce bleb scarring in glaucoma surgery. Given the multiple beneficial effects for glaucoma patients, ROCK inhibitors are certainly a highly anticipated emerging treatment option for glaucoma.

Narcolepsy type 1 is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy and is associated with hypocretin-1 deficiency. On the other hand, in narcolepsy type 2, cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are normal and cataplexy absent. Despite major advances in our understanding of narcolepsy mechanisms, its current management is only symptomatic. Treatment options may vary from a single drug that targets several symptoms, or multiple medications that each treats a specific symptom. In recent years, narcolepsy treatment has changed with the widespread use of modafinil/armodafinil for daytime sleepiness, antidepressants (selective serotonin and dual serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors) for cataplexy, and sodium oxybate for both symptoms. Other psychostimulants can also be used, such as methylphenidate, pitolisant and rarely amphetamines, as third-line therapy. Importantly, clinically relevant subjective and objective measures of daytime sleepiness are required to monitor the treatment efficacy and to provide guidance on whether the treatment goals are met. Associated symptoms and comorbid conditions, such as hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, disturbed nighttime sleep, unpleasant dreams, REM- and non REM-related parasomnias, depressive symptoms, overweight/obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea, should also be taken into account and managed, if required. In the near future, the efficacy of new wake-promoting drugs, anticataplectic agents, hypocretin replacement therapy and immunotherapy at the early stages of the disease should also be evaluated.\n\nSelection of appropriate treatment options for hand fractures.\n\nPubMed\n\nSammer, Douglas M; Husain, Tarik; Ramirez, Rey\n\n2013-11-01\n\nSelecting the appropriate treatment method for hand fractures is challenging due to the wide spectrum of presentation and the enormous array of surgical and nonoperative treatment options. Unfortunately, the scientific evidence to help guide decision making is not of high quality. Because of this, the surgeon must rely on a few basic principles to guide treatment. This article provides an overview of the scientific evidence, and discusses the principles and rationale used to treat hand fractures. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Absence epilepsy is most often treated with ethosuximide or valproic acid. However, both drugs are not always well tolerated or fail, and seizure freedom for a larger proportion of patients remains to be achieved. The availability of genuine animal models of epilepsy does allow to search for new treatment options not only for absence epilepsy per se but also for other genetic - previously called idiopathic - forms of epilepsy. The recent discovery of a highly excitable cortical zone in these models is considered as a new therapeutic target area. Here, we provide an overview regarding the search for new therapeutical options as has been investigated in the genetic rodent models (mainly WAG/Rij and GAERS) including drugs and whether antiepileptogenesis can be achieved, various types of electrical and optogenetical invasive stimulations, different types of noninvasive stimulation and finally whether absence seizures can be predicted and prevented. Many factors determine either the cortical and or thalamic excitability or the interaction between cortex and thalamus and offer new possibilities for new anti-absence drugs, among others metabotropic glutamatergic positive and negative allosteric modulators. The inhibition of epileptogenesis by various drugs with its widespread consequences seems feasible, although its mechanisms remain obscure and seems different from the antiabsence action. Surgical intervention on the cortical zone initiating seizures, either with radiosurgery using synchrotron- generated microbeams, or ablation techniques might reduce spike-and-wave discharges in the rodent models. High frequency electrical subcortical or cortical stimulation might be a good way to abort ongoing spikeand- wave discharges. In addition, possibilities for prevention with real-time EEG analyses in combination with\n\nChemophototherapy: An Emerging Treatment Option for Solid Tumors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLuo, Dandan; Carter, Kevin A.; Miranda, Dyego\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNear infrared (NIR) light penetrates human tissues with limited depth, thereby providing a method to safely deliver nonâionizing radiation to wellâdefined target tissue volumes. Lightâbased therapies including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and laserâinduced thermal therapy have been validated clinically for curative and palliative treatment of solid tumors. However, these monotherapies can suffer from incomplete tumor killing and have not displaced existing ablative modalities. The combination of phototherapy and chemotherapy (chemophototherapy, CPT), when carefully planned, has been shown to be an effective tumor treatment option preclinically and clinically. Chemotherapy can enhance the efficacy of PDT by targeting surviving cancer cells or by inhibiting regrowth of damaged tumor blood vessels. Alternatively, PDTâmediated vascular permeabilization has been shown to enhance the deposition of nanoparticulate drugs into tumors for enhanced accumulation and efficacy. Integrated nanoparticles have been reported that combine photosensitizers and drugs into a single agent. More recently, lightâactivated nanoparticles have been developed that release their payload in response to light irradiation to achieve improved drug bioavailability with superior efficacy. CPT can potently eradicate tumors with precise spatial control, and further clinical testing is warranted.

The main efficacy parameters were the response rate, as defined by protocol parameters, the rate of patients achieving an improvement from baseline of â¥75% in the subjective and objective scores, and the mean reduction in subjective and objective scores throughout the treatment. The safety of the treatment was also assessed. By the end of the 24-week treatment, 12 patients (70.6%) experienced a response; 35.3% and 17.6% of patients achieved an improvement of at least 75% in subjective and objective scores, respectively. Mean scores of itching, leukoderma (pallor) and hyperkeratosis decreased significantly in the study patients, and none presented itching-related excoriations. Erythema increased compared with baseline. Six patients (35.29%) experienced some side effects related to tretinoin, mainly mild erythema and burning. None of the subjects discontinued the treatment because of side effects. Tretinoin 0.025% cream applied for 24 weeks may represent a useful alternative option to corticosteroids in the treatment of active VLS, acting particularly on hyperkeratosis and pallor.\n\nCurrent status in the treatment options for esop"
