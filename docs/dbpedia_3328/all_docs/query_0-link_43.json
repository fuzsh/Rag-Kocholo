        "text": "Tribal justice means putting Native nations in the driver‚Äôs seat of their own communities. They know best how to provide solutions to the problems their communities face, according to their own customs and traditions. üìñ Learn more about these approaches to justice in a Q&A with our Tribal Justice team on The Arc here: https://lnkd.in/ewjuZgJf\n\nMy definition of justice is power used for good. For our words and actions to bring justice it's important we also carry the heart of mercy, compassion, and humility. Yes, there are always consequences for actions, but we are responsible to ensure that our heart posturing is absent of revenge and filled with humility. #justice #mercy #compassion #humility #higherthinking #StopDevaluation #UnmaskingPrejudice #HigherLivingLeadership https://lnkd.in/eP4sKkqS\n\nIt‚Äôs good to see Australia's efforts to tackle modern slavery ranked as Tier One - one of only 33 countries to achieve this status in the US Department of State 2024 Trafficking in Persons Report. The recent establishment of Australia‚Äôs first Anti-Slavery Commissioner played a significant role in earning this recognition. The Commissioner is a very welcome beginning to strengthening Australia‚Äôs response to tackling modern slavery, but much more remains to be done, and investors and business both have a significant role in upholding human rights and identifying and remediating modern slavery where ever it happens. #modernslavery https://lnkd.in/gXJ6-pvZ\n\n\"Exploring Winnipeg's rich history at the Vaughn Street Jail! üè∞ Passionate about preserving our heritage, it's bittersweet to share this iconic building as my funding runs out. The historical significance speaks volumes, yet the unjust incarcerations remind us of a challenging past. Did you know the infamous Gorilla Strangler, Earl Nelson, met his fate here? My apologies for the mix-up ‚Äì it's Earl, not Edward! ü¶çüîó If you know of funding opportunities for my historical preservation projects, drop your insights in the comments! #WinnipegHistory #HeritagePreservation #VaughnStreetJail #EarlNelson #HistoricalArchitecture\"\n\nIs slavery out of your sight and out of your mind? March 25 marks the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. I can't imagine the intense trauma experienced by the millions of people who suffered under the weight of slavery as it existed in the early modern era. Neither can I escape the challenge of addressing the global phenomenon of the face of slavery today in which more than 50 million people are trapped in some form of exploitation including forced labour, debt bondage, human trafficking and domestic servitude, among other human rights violations. What I have made my life's purpose is to choose to remember and in my daily affirmations, to commit myself to using my freedom (voice, choice and movement) to combat modern slavery, through enabling Australian organisations to make an impact through the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth), and to support the work of NFPs and social enterprises who work directly with survivors and people at risk including the Freedom Business Alliance and Commonwealth 8.7 Network. What can you do with your freedom today? #bizhumanrights #modernslavery #purposedriven"
