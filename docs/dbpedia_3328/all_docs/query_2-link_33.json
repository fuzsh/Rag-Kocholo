        "text": "Robert Catrini has joined the cast of Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. An adaptation of the Jack Reacher novel written by Lee Child, the film will see the title character (Tom Cruise) return to the headquarters of his old Army unit, only to find out he’s been accused of a 16-year-old murder. Joining Cruise this time out is Cobie Smulders, along with Danika Yarosh, Aldis Hodge, Patrick Heusinger, Holt McCallany, and Austin Hebert. Catrini’s role has not been revealed. Veteran actor Catrini played the Israeli President in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, and his credits also include appearances on TV’s NCIS, The Mentalist, True Blood, Criminal Minds, Without A Trace, Las Vegas, NYPD: Blue, Monk, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, among many others.\n\nWill Yun Lee has signed on to appear in the human-trafficking drama She Has A Name, based on the play by Andrew Kooman. The story follows an American lawyer with an international rights organization trying to find victims of an incident that saw the death of more than 50 trafficked migrants. Tracing the case to Bangkok, he poses as a john in order to secretly meet with prostitutes held in bondage by a ruthless pimp connected to the grisly crime, where he meets a Cambodian girl he knows only as Number 18. Trying to convince her to testify against her captor, he realizes he has instead placed her life in danger. Now being pursued by a crime syndicate, he must try to find 18 before her pimp can eliminate her. Lee will portray a Thai criminal kingpin described as smart, charismatic, and ruthless. Daniel Kooman and Matthew Kooman are directing the film, which is being produced by Unveil Studios. Lee recently did a guest spot on Dr. Ken, as well as an episode of The Player. He also has appeared in San Andreas, The Wolverine, Spy and Total Recall, among many other credits. Lee is repped by APA and Zero Gravity Management."
