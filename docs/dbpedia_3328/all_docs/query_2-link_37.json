        "text": "The inspiration for the Ripple Effect Artists came from my love of theatre and own experiences as an actress living in New York City. In addition to my passion for theatre, social justice and learning have always been core values to me. I felt it was important to create shows that bring greater attention and awareness to the most pertinent social issues of our time. After I saw the Broadway Revival of The Normal Heart, I was inspired to develop an organization that melded my two loves, theatre and crucial conversations.\n\nI am proud to share that The Ripple Effect Artists just finished our winter performance that addressed sex trafficking in the play She Has A Name by Andrew Kooman. Even though human trafficking is a global epidemic, it is also a social issue that is often minimized, unrecognized and unacknowledged by the public. I felt called to utilize drama to educate audiences and at the same time join other activists and organizations in the fight to end sexual exploitation. I'm horrified by the number of trafficking victims in the world. According to UNICEF statistics, Women and girls make up 98% of victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. At least 27 million adults and children are bought and sold worldwide into commercial sexual servitude, forced labor and bonded labor. I want to live in a world where women and children are not given the message that exploitation is the most efficient way to survive and thrive financially. Bearing witness to the facts and stories around sexual exploitation is horrifying. However, we need to be aware of the realities if we hope to create meaningful change.\n\nOur performance She Has A Name illustrated how powerful and effective theatre can be in educating and bringing awareness to the public. Our performances at The Ripple Effect Artists illustrate storytelling in its most heightened form. Our goal is to educate and leave audiences in a completely different state of mind when leaving the theater. Through acting we provide a window to global and national tragedies that can pierce the heart and have people think, consider, and be moved. Without it, facts would just be on a piece of paper. Without the inspiration of others to make a difference, nothing will shift. Drama provides that inspiration. For more information on how to support the Ripple Effect Artists, attend upcoming performances and to learn what you can do to combat sexual exploitation please see below. Thank you for your attention and partnership.\n\nSincerely, Jessie Fahay, Executive Director of Ripple Effect Artists\n\nIf you are interested in supporting the Ripple Effect Artists I invite you to donate to our upcoming production www.rally.org/REASHAN.
