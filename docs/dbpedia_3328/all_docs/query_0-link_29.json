        "text": "I don't know so much about the proper MOS etc for plays so excuse me if I raise non-issues. I'll go through the body of the article first then come back to the infobox and lead at the end.\n\nBackground\n\n\"Andrew Kooman first became aware of human trafficking while he was working for the nonprofit organization Youth With A Mission (YWAM) in southeast Malaysia\". I suggest rewording to \"Andrew Kooman, from Alberta, Canada, first became aware ...\", We should make clear When we say Kooman \"later realized that human trafficking also occurs in Canada\" we should make it more obvious that we are talking about his home country. Perhaps reword to \"Andrew Kooman, from Alberta, Canada, first became aware ...\" or change \"also occurs in Canada\" to \"also occurs in his own country, Canada. Or something like that\n\n\"Kooman has spoken about cases where people have been trafficked into Calgary and Edmonton for prostitution, and said that sex workers may have been trafficked into Red Deer, his hometown, since it is also located along Alberta Highway 2.\" This is interesting but I'm not sure it's directly relevant to She Has a Name. Simply saying he realized human trafficking occurs in Canada is enough in my opinion.\n\nIn the second paragraph, perhaps move the last sentence \"To further ground the play in reality, Kooman researched human trafficking and met with survivors\" to the beginning, and mention the Ranong incident as a specific part of this research.\n\nThird paragraph: Perhaps the \"background\" section as a whole would be stronger and more focused if we started the section with this paragraph. If we do this I think it works better with the first sentence (\"Kooman had written other literary works ...\") at the end of the paragraph. So the body of the article would start bang on focus by saying \"She Has a Name was Andrew Kooman's first full-length play\", then branch out and explain some of the background.\n\nMaybe this is an WP:ENGVAR issue, but shouldn't theatres generally have \"the\" before them? \"The Royal Opera House\"? \"The Old Vic\"? \"The London Palladium\"?\n\nPerhaps say the theatre's in Calgary. — Cliftonian (talk)\n\nI would recommend trimming the fourth paragraph down a bit: specifically I would remove the part about it being at a justice conference in Michigan and trim down the passage with Waldschmidt to just say something like \"Stephen Waldschmidt, one of [the?] Burnt Thicket Theatre's artistic associates, asked to read the script of She Has a Name and said he could not put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it to a full-length play with an extra hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in anything from 90 minutes to two hours.\"\n\n\"Waldschmidt directed the play's premiere, and Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company\" You can change the second \"the play's\" to \"its\"\n\nI'd trim the image caption to just \"She Has a Name was Andrew Kooman's debut play\" or even just \"Andrew Kooman, who wrote the play\"\n\nMore soon — Cliftonian (talk)\n\nProductions Initial run\n\n\"The stage premiere of She Has a Name was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt\" We've said this in the last section.\n\nIs it really necessary to say when auditions took place? Also the reference for this doesn't say the auditions actually happened then, it just says that's when they were scheduled for.\n\n\"Aaron Krogman was selected to portray Jason and the unnamed pimp, Sienna Howell-Holden to portray Mama, Glenda Warkentin to portray Marta, Denise Wong to portray Number 18, and Cari Russell to portray Ali\" who are all of these characters? I would recommend moving the \"Characters\" and \"Plot summary\" sections up so they precede the \"Productions\" section. Otherwise it's kind of confusing to the uninitiated reader.\n\n\"Both Wong and Russell said they become more emotionally involved in the play than they had originally anticipated, Howell-Holden said that the play changed her life, and Warkentin found acting in the play an emotional challenge and said that she did not realize the depth of the problem of human trafficking\" I would lose this to tighten up the prose.\n\n\"The troupe rehearsed for three weeks in Strathmore before the premiere\" I'm not sure it's really necessary to mention this—it's kind of taken for granted that actors in a play rehearse\n\n\"Performances ran on the centre's Motel stage between February 23 and March 5\" The same problem as above—the source is a schedule from beforehand, not a confirmation afterwards that it actually happened. You can easily get around this by saying something like \"Performances were scheduled for February 23 to March 5\"\n\n\"and people wanting to buy tickets at the door, sometimes numbering 20 or 30, had to be turned away\" I would trim this. It is enough in my opinion just to say the performances were sold out.\n\n\"where the play was performed until March 12\" again, the same temporal problem with the refrencing.\n\n\"The play drew an emotional reaction from the audience.[28][29] The most common audience responses were sadness and gratitude.[30]\" In my opinion one of these two sentences would do—we don't need both.\n\n\"Kooman was told that many of the audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative things on the subject.\" Was told by whom? Who could be aware of how \"many\" of the audience members reacted? Did they all know each other?\n\n\"They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with stories about how the play had continued to affect their lives\" I find it strange that we should make seemingly hagiographic statements about audience reactions when, as the article stands, we haven't even talked about the play yet.\n\n\"In order to finance\" \"In order\" is almost always unnecessary—\"To finance\" means the same thing\n\n2012 tour\n\n\"directed by Stephen Waldschmidt\" we've already mentioned him a few times so we can just say Waldschmidt\n\n\"Warkentin returned to portray Marta, and Howell-Holden returned to portray Mama\" how about \"and Warkentin and Howell-Holden returned as Marta and Mama\"\n\n\"Despite the fact that She Has a Name is set in Southeast Asia, the producers deliberately cast actors who were not of Asian descent to avoid giving the impression that human trafficking is limited to Asia\" Perhaps \"To avoid giving the impression that human trafficking is limited to Asia, the producers deliberately cast actors who were not of Asian appearance.\" (it is possible for one to be of a certain ancestry without looking it, and the appearance is what's relevant here)\n\nPerhaps split this long paragraph after this sentence\n\nI would recommend making clear that the \"London\" we mention is London, ON and not England.\n\n\"partway through the tour\" you can contract this to \"mid-tour\" without loss of meaning\n\n\"Red Dear\"—typo\n\nIs it necessary to say exactly which theatre the production went to in each town? We already have the FA on the 2012 tour that discusses this.\n\n\"non-audience members\" You mean the cast, crew etc?\n\n\"The purpose of these discussions was to raise awareness about human trafficking in Canada and elsewhere.\" I think you could easily incorporate this information into the previous sentence to tighten up the prose.\n\nI think it is going into too much detail to mention everybody who chaired and took part in these discussions. I recommend trimming it down a bit. We have the 2012 tour article so this information wouldn't be lost.\n\nI'd reword the second image caption here to mention the church at the beginning.\n\n\"Cynthia Foster attended one of the performances during the tour, and she later went on to produce and direct the first school production of She Has a Name\" perhaps \"Cynthia Foster, who attended one of the performance during the tour, went to produce and direct the first school production\" (it is obvious from context of what)\n\nPerformances in the United States\n\n\"She and her sister had become passionate about the issue of human trafficking after having gotten involved with the organization Run for Courage,\" perhaps \"She and her sister had become passionate about the issue of human trafficking as a result of their involvement with the organization Run for Courage\"\n\nI don't think we need to say their mother thought God had led her to She Has a Name.\n\n\" In order to have the rights to produce the play in the United States, FreeFall Stage made a special arrangement with the Playwrights Guild of Canada\" The source just says it was \"produced by special arrangement with the Playwrights Guild of Canada\", not that this special arrangement was to allow it to be staged south of the border.\n\n\", who was born in Thailand, where she received a Bachelor of Music, and she was studying at American River College at the time of the performances. She had arrived in the United States in January 2014, and said that, prior to receiving a role in She Has a Name, she had not realized the extent to which human trafficking had become an issue in Thailand\" I would snip all this—it's not relevant to the production.\n\n\"In these performances, Ali was portrayed by Brianna Flynn, Marta by Marybeth Moore, and Mama by Sara Matsui-Colby. The voices were separately portrayed by Caitlyn Wardell, Bonnie Antignani, and Jeannette Baisch.\" What voices? See my comment above about the ordering of the article. It is very hard to understand as it is presently constructed. I would move the \"Characters\" and \"Plot summary\" up to appear straight after \"background\".\n\n\"Performances ran from May 2 to June 22.\" But the reference is from before 22 June.\n\nCharacters\n\nYou don't need the word \"different\" in the first sentence\n\nI would put \"four female and one male\" (using the genders as adjectives rather than as nouns)—sounds more consistent\n\n\"young, female prostitute\" don't need to say \"young\" as we say immediately after she claims to be 15. Also I'm not sure we need \"female\" as prostitutes are generally assumed to be female unless otherwise stated\n\n\"beautiful\" according to who? the script? is her beauty a plot point? Perhaps reword to \"Ali is Jason's wife; they have two young daughters\".\n\nPerhaps reword to \"The other characters are a pimp, who is unnamed, and his assistant, a cruel brothel keeper called Mama.\"\n\nThere isn't an inline reference at the end of this paragraph.\n\n\"The script calls for both of the male characters—Jason and the pimp—to be played by the same actor.\" Perhaps \"The script calls for one actor to play both male characters—Jason and the pimp\".\n\n\"these characters serve much the same purpose as a Greek chorus in Greek tragedies.\" this is an objective statement but I feel it may be better presented as somebody's opinion.\n\n\"While these voices emphasize the horrors of the sex industry, they also empower Number 18, comforting her as divine messengers.\" says who?\n\n\"The fact that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes is revealed only at the end of the play.\" Perhaps reword to \"It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes.\"\n\nSince we say at the end of the section that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes, perhaps we can cut it from earlier in the paragraph and just say the first time that \"Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices\"?\n\nPlot summary\n\nI will copy-edit here directly.\n\nThemes\n\n\"The general topic of the play is human trafficking, and specifically the trafficking of children into sexual slavery\" perhaps \"human trafficking—specifically the trafficking of children into sexual slavery\". More direct and stronger, I think\n\n\"and she experiences fear, anger, and shame\" I think this goes without saying.\n\n\"Waldschmidt said that the sympathetic portrayal of the perpetrators prevents the play from becoming a simplistic story of good and evil.\" when did he say this?\n\n\"the stock damsel in distress character\" don't think you need \"character\" at the end here\n\nThe second and fourth paragraphs in this section are very long. I recommend splitting them.\n\n\"In order to depict the tension\" Don't need \"in order\" (both in the prose and in the Skype caption)\n\n\"whether to continue to work on the case or whether to return to Canada\" reword to \"whether to continue his work or return to Canada\"\n\nDon't think we need the wikilinks on \"Calgarian\" and \"Vancouverite\"\n\n\"Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor who took over the role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and builds in intensity to its climax.\" She said the play is intense because it builds in intensity?\n\n\"million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year\" is this figure for a specific place or worldwide?\n\nwould change \"argued that\" to \"reported that\" (where Mallory Clarkson says audiences can also laugh).\n\nDo those who say there are funny parts say what those are?\n\nI would change the semi-colon in the last sentence of this section to a full stop.\n\nCritical response\n\nIn the UK, Members of Parliament are usually called \"John Smith MP\" rather than \"MP John Smith\". Is the latter usage preferred in Canada?\n\n\"than expected\" by who? Kooman?\n\nWhen we say \"The religious community\" do we mean the Christian community, or other religions too? (or the community surrounding a particular sect of Christianity?)\n\n\"because of how she was written rather than how Warkentin performed her\" You don't need \"written rather than how Warkentin performed her\"\n\nI personally think \"a play you will carry with you long after the lights have gone up\" would be a stronger peroration than \"you must see this play\".\n\nInfobox and lead\n\n\"and were directed by Emma Eldridge\" perhaps \"under the direction of Emma Eldridge\"\n\n\"a young female prostitute who claims to be fifteen years old\" see above—perhaps reword to \"who has been a prostitute for six years and claims to be 15 years old\"\n\nAgain above comment re: \"John Smith MP\" vs \"MP John Smith\"\n\nI hope all of this helps. Cheers — Cliftonian (talk)\n\nThank you very much for this thorough review, John! I have implemented the majority of your recommendations. Please let me know if I have done so to your liking. I didn't add the definite article to mentions of Burnt Thicket Theatre because this entity is a troupe and not a building; I don't know if this is a dialectical difference, but the sources are consistent in omitting the definite article in referring to Burnt Thicket Theatre. I don't know of a source stating that the troupe is based in Calgary, and the \"About\" section on their official website doesn't declare a home base, although I assume that it's Calgary or the environs. I retained the phrase \"Asian descent\" rather than \"Asian appearance\" because the relevant sentence would otherwise imply that the actors were of Asian descent and just didn't look like they were. I cut most of the description of Sunpanich's background, but I retained the statement that she was born in Thailand because it is relevant to the play, which is set in Thailand. I kept the word \"young\" as a descriptor of Number 18 because removing it would make it seem like Number 18 was older and was just saying she was 15 in order to make more money. In the same sentence, I retained the word \"female\" because I would prefer to avoid promoting the stereotype that all prostitutes are female. Several sentences in the \"Characters\" section don't have explicit references for the same reason that there aren't any citations in the \"Plot summary\" section; this information is taken from the play itself. \"MP Joy Smith\" is the preferred word order in Canada; a Google News search reveals \"MP Joy Smith\" to appear much more often than \"Joy Smith MP\". I hope I have adequately addressed your concerns. If I have not, I would be glad to make additional attempts. Thank you again for engaging with the article. I think it looks much better as a result of your input. Neelix (talk)\n\nThank you for the reply David. I think the article is much stronger now.\n\nBurnt Thicket Theatre: OK, this isn't a major issue—just so long as we are consistent with the usage.\n\nAsian descent: Again not a major issue, on reflection I think most readers can understand from the context what is meant.\n\nSunpanich: OK (though, from a pedantic point of view, the play is set in Thailand but that particular character is Cambodian)\n\nYoung: OK, fair enough\n\nFemale: OK, but we do have the feminine descriptor \"heroine\" immediately beforehand, so perhaps tautology?\n\nThere are still some comments above that haven't been addressed. I have gone through and stricken those that no longer apply or are elaborated on here. Well done on all the work so far, keep it up. =) — Cliftonian (talk)\n\nThank you for striking the issues that have been resolved; it makes it easier to see how to proceed. Considering that five issues remain, I will number them in order below:\n\nI reworded the relevant sentence in the article so that it starts with the words \"Kooman learned that some audience members...\" In this way, the sentence no longer indicates any entities providing this information to Kooman, and no longer indicates that the number of these members was many. The only remaining question you ask is, \"Did they all know each other?\", and, unfortunately, this information is not contained in the article. Is there anything else you would like to see happen with this sentence?\n\nDone; I must have accidentally overlooked this bullet previously.\n\nUnfortunately, the sources don't provide this information. It has been more than two years since I saw the play myself, and I don't remember funny parts, and it probably wouldn't be useful if I did, as that would be original research on my part. Would you recommend that this portion of the article be altered?\n\nUnfortunately, the source just refers to the religious community and doesn't specify further. I would assume that it was the Christian community, considering that several of the performance locations were churches, but I don't know for sure; the play isn't presented from any particular religious viewpoint, and would probably have supporters from a variety of religions.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this point. Removing the portion you indicate would result in a sentence fragment, as far as I understand. Might you phrase your suggestion in another way?\n\nThank you again for engaging with this article so thoroughly, John. I look forward to discussing the article with you further. Neelix (talk)\n\nSorry, that last one was a mental typo on my part. I mean \"because of how she was written\" (and end the sentence there). Others I am not too concerned with I have stricken above. There remains the point about reception being \"better than expected\"; by whom? — Cliftonian (talk)\n\nNo worries; that makes sense. I have removed the portion of the sentence you mention. I have rewatched the video that sources the statement that \"the play's premiere and initial run were more critically acclaimed than expected.\" Unfortunately, the narrator simply says that the fact that the initial performances sold out was an \"unexpected response\"; it is not stated who wasn't doing the expecting. Given the vagueness of the statement, do you think it should be removed? Neelix (talk)\n\nI think that would be best, particularly as \"more critically acclaimed than expected\" could be taken to imply that they expected to get bad reviews. Better I think just to say it got generally positive reviews (or something like that). — Cliftonian (talk)\n\nI have reworded the sentence to remove the vague reference to unattributed expectations. I just noticed your additional revisions; thank you for continuing to help with improvements. Do you have any remaining concerns regarding the article, John? Neelix (talk)\n\nI think that's it for me. Great job. I'm supporting now. — Cliftonian (talk)"
