        "text": "Defining Personal Information\n\nPersonal Information is any information that can be used to distinguish, identify, or contact a specific individual. This information can include an individual’s opinions or beliefs, as well as facts about or related to the individual. Exceptions: business contact information and certain publicly available information, such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers as published in telephone directories, are not considered personal information.\n\nWhere an individual uses his or her home contact information as business contact information as well, we consider that this contact information provided is business contact information and is not therefore subject to protection as personal information.\n\nUse of your Personal Information\n\nBAE collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.\n\nBAE may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from BAE and its affiliates. BAE may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.\n\nBAE does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to third parties.\n\nBAE may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within BAE, in order to determine what BAE services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within BAE to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.\n\nBAE will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BAE or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of BAE; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BAE, or the public.\n\nPrivacy Policies\n\nPersonal information gathered by BAE is kept in strict confidence. Our personnel are authorized to access personal information based only on their need to deal with the information for the reason(s) for which it was obtained. Safeguards are in place to ensure that the information is not disclosed or shared more widely than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was gathered. We also take measures to ensure the integrity of this information is maintained and to prevent it being lost or destroyed.\n\nWe collect, use and disclose personal information only for the purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in light of the circumstances. We routinely offer individuals we deal with the opportunity to choose not to have their information shared for purposes beyond those for which it was explicitly collected.\n\nLinks and Embedded Content\n\nBAE’s website may include links to other sites or embedded content, such as YouTube videos. Once you leave our servers, BAE does not control the privacy policies of destination sites. BAE encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from BAE so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. BAE is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the BAE website.\n\nUse of Cookies\n\nThe BAE website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.\n\nOne of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize BAE pages, or register with BAE site or services, a cookie helps BAE to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same BAE website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the BAE features that you customized.\n\nYou have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the BAE services or websites you visit.\n\nJurisdiction and Venue\n\nAll users, including those who access the web sites from a country other than the U.S., agree by virtue of their use that the laws of the State of New York shall govern any disputes, including any arising from or in connection with use of the sites and any arising from BAE’s use of personal information or otherwise relating to privacy and that any claim made against the BAE can only be brought in a federal or state court in New York County, New York.\n\nUpdating of Privacy Policy\n\nWe regularly review our privacy policy practices for our various activities, and update our policy. Please check with our web site (www.balletacademyeast.com) on an on-going basis for information on our most up-to-date practices.\n\nContact Information\n\nBAE welcomes your questions or comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that BAE has not adhered to this Statement, please contact BAE at:"
