        "text": "A survivor of abuse and cancer shares the tools she used to move beyond healing and rediscover her purpose in this spiritual self-help guide.\n\nJessika Fuhrmaneck is a survivor of abuse, exploitation, cancer, and divorce. At the end of it all, she had complex PTSD and felt utterly lost. She spent years in recovery programs to bring her back to a place of mental and emotional wellbeing. But after all the recovery, therapy, and healing, Jessika was still disconnected from her lifeâs calling. Jessika spent a year discovering how to return to her God-given purposes.\n\nThrough persistence and prayer, Jessika discovered actionable steps that got her back on track with her calling. Now she shares her journey and process with other survivors of trauma and loss. For anyone feeling lost in the fog of psychological pain, From Pain to Purpose offers a path back to clarity and light.\n\nTrauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the worldâs foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferersâ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatmentsâfrom neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yogaâthat offer new paths to recovery by activating the brainâs natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolkâs own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to healâand offers new hope for reclaiming lives.\n\nRoadmap to Redemption is the first of it's kind, a workbook for survivors of sex trafficking written by a survivor. Rebecca Bender was lured into the life of human trafficking at the vulnerable age of 18. Now, rescued and restored, she uses the valuable lessons she's learned to help bring other survivors toward redemption. This ten week workbook is cupped with her personal testimony and injected with scripture. Rebecca uncovers the seductive tactics traffickers use in America today and equips anyone who wants to work with exploited victims. This workbook can be used one on one, privately or in a group setting. Roadmap to Redemption should be in the hands of every victim of trauma and every advocate working in the field!\n\nA child soldier, Grammy-nominated artists, and a Rock and Roll legend. Everyone has dreams. DREAM is an episodic series following inspiring stories of children, women and men from around the world.\n\nDreams. A cherished aspiration, ambition, or ideal; an unrealistic or self-deluding fantasy. The two definitions could not be more opposed. In Dream, the filmmakers explore stories on both ends of the spectrum and ask the question: if anything were possible, what dream would you build your life on?\n\nâ\n\nThe world began when God, the Creator of everything said, âLet there be light.â As the wonder of the world came to life with all its intricate beauty, the most miraculous moment had yet to become reality. Thatâs when God breathed into Adam and, with that one breath, shaped humanity. In this thoughtful and inspiring book, Daniel Kooman, the award-winning director of She Has A Name and Dream: Find Your Significance, shares the creation story in a way you have never experienced it before.\n\nThis is a book and a video series.\n\nThe Kooman brothers would like to bless survivors/overcomers with this resource so if you are an overcomer that would like access to this at a discounted price please use the discount code: friend20.\n\nIf you are not an overcomer please consider supporting them at their full price because the work that they do is amazing and we would really like to see them able to keep producing this kind of material in the future.\n\n#dealwithit is the honest, raw, not-safe-for-work account of Dr. John A. King trying to piece his life back together, move forward and thrive after the spontaneous recall of over a decade of childhood sexual abuse by his parents and their friends. This recall event, or John-A-Geddon, was followed by the immediate onset of Complex Post Traumatic Stress, which led to the loss of his marriage, career and health. This book shares Johnâs gritty process of rebuilding his life. On his journey, youâll find practical tools, unlikely mentors and his trademark Aussie sarcasm."
