        "text": "Labeled at the time of its U.S. release “a gorgeous send-up of Fantasia,” the mixed animation and live action feature film visually interprets six pieces of classical music by Debussy, Dvorak, Ravel, Sibelius, Vivaldi, and Stravinsky. In between the animation at the beginning of the film and the black and white live-action sequences at the end there are displays of the fictional animator, orchestra, conductor, and filmmaker, with many humorous scenes about the production of the film. The classical pieces are set to color animation, ranging from comedy to drama. Each of Allegro non Troppo’s episodes shows a different production style, resulting in a truly artistic, brilliantly animated tour de force. An explicit homage to Disney’s Fantasia, Allegro non Troppo represents a high point in the history of animation. The film garnered worldwide acclaim and was praised by Disney Legend Ward Kimball, who called it one of his “favorite animated films of all time.”\n\nInspired by classic Disney films including Fantasia (1940) and Bambi (1942), Bozzetto debuted in 1953 at the age of 15 with a Donald Duck-themed short. He quickly developed his own distinctive personal style, becoming one of the most eclectic and innovative independent animators, directors, and producers in the industry. For almost six decades, working both independently and through his company Bruno Bozzetto Film, he has produced and created animation shorts, commercials, TV series, and four full-length feature films including the iconic West & Soda (1965) and VIP, my Brother Superman (1968). His short films have also earned an Academy Award nomination, a Berlin Golden Bear, and more than 100 international awards.\n\nBozzetto’s work represents the perfect link between classic Disney style and a contemporary, modern approach to animation focused on storytelling, character development, brilliant design, and humor. “Bruno Bozzetto’s films have been one of the greatest inspirations for me as an animator and storyteller. He has created some of the funniest animated films ever made and is one of the most clever storytellers around. Bruno’s designs are so appealing and his comic timing is truly unsurpassed,” comments John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios.\n\nEarlier this year, Bozzetto was awarded the highly respected ASIFA (Association Internationale du Film d’Animation/International Animated Film Association) prize “for outstanding achievements in the art of animation.” The award included an original artwork by Bozzetto’s beloved inspiration Tyrus Wong, the art director for Bambi and the inspiration for his “less is more” approach to animation. The exhibition is aptly timed with Water to Paper, Paint to Sky: The Art of Tyrus Wong currently on view through February 3, 2014 in the museum’s Diane Disney Miller Exhibition Hall."
