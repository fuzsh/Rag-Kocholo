        "text": "TopBilled:\n\n“Mars and Beyond” is an animated episode of Disneyland (Walt Disney’s weekly anthology television series which was renamed several times over the years). The episode aired on December 4th, 1957 and was directed by Ward Kimball. Paul Frees served as the narrator.\n\nIn Jlewis’ review, he covers some of the more technical aspects of the production. I didn’t exactly dislike what I viewed, but I was not terribly wowed by it either. I would suggest our readers watch it for themselves after reading what Jlewis has written, then make up their own minds.\n\nThey were limited in their knowledge about space in 1957. One of the interviewed scientists admits they probably have errors in their calculations, so their efforts to gather information about the cosmos may be flawed.\n\nImagine how limited our knowledge may seem to people 64 years from now. It’s about adding layers of understanding on to what is already known (proven), then refining our theories so the end results are more practical.\n\nThe animation is fantastic and holds up well. Perhaps this is because it’s creative (bizarre at times) and these are the unique imaginings of life on other planets. However, these imaginings seem quite fictional.\n\nI remember once, while teaching a group of students, I asked them ‘do you think the bible is a work of fiction or nonfiction?’ We could ask that same question here, is this episode of Disneyland mostly fiction or nonfiction.\n\nSometimes this piece doesn’t know if it should be a wild and woolly cartoon or a scientific-based documentary. Ultimately, it chooses to be both.\n\nPaul Frees’ voice-over narration is excellent. Only Orson Welles could have done it better.\n\nI liked the sequence about the pressurized living colonies on Mars. However, I chuckled at the comment that they needed to colonize Mars due to overpopulation. There were around 3 billon people in 1957, compared to 7.8 billion in 2020. They had less than half our current world population.\n\nThe piece was used by science teachers in classrooms. But I didn’t get the impression that it would encourage students to apply science in their daily lives. It entertains more than it inspires scientific inquiry.\n\nIt presumes to tell viewers ‘this is what we know must be true’ about our neighboring planets. What would those neighboring planets say about us? It suggests that our knowledge (our earthly knowledge) is the most important knowledge in the universe.\n\nIt is worth watching at least once. You may enjoy it.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nWard Kimball is one of the most interesting animators and animation directors working for Disney between the years of 1934 and 1973. Beginning as an in-betweener, he moved up the ranks as a star animator in the early feature classics, although one famous sequence of his involving the dwarfs sipping soup was cut from SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (but shown later on TV and DVD). He then moved on to doing much of the work on Jiminy Cricket in PINOCCHIO and the infamous crows in DUMBO.\n\nWith his work in THE THREE CABALLEROS, he began deviating from the more naturalistic style of Disney animation, crossing into territory resembling the looser un-Disney Tex Avery crazies at MGM and Rod Scribner’s rubbery exaggerations in the Robert Clampett Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies at Warner Bros. In this one, he animated Donald Duck, José Carioca, and Panchito Pistoles doing a musical number that involves all kinds of surrealistic, wild activities breaking the walls of reality. By this time, he was a much trusted fixture at the studio and Walt Disney seemed to allow him more personal freedom to experiment than many others on the payroll.\n\nWhen UPA stole some of Disney’s thunder by the end of the forties and into the fifties with its flatter, more Matisse-like design, Ward managed to get the big boss to allow him to change with the times. Not that Disney always stuck to just any one particular style of animation and some of their pre-UPA work could sometimes look UPA-ish, but there was a bit too much comfort with the overly detailed story-book look during the post-war period, a look that critic Leslie Halliwell would dub later in print as “chocolate box-y”.\n\nMELODY and TOOT, WHISTLE, PLUNK AND BOOM were short subjects that he co-directed with Charles Nichols which incorporated a more stylized approach that one would more often expect in the early fifties Mr. Magoo and Gerald McBoing Boing cartoons rather than the contemporary Mickey Mouse cartoons; the former was presented in 3-D and the latter, an Oscar winner, was in CinemaScope.\n\nThis distinctive “mid-century modernism,” as many art critics called it (as it infiltrated all kinds of book illustrations of the 1950s with a vengeance), reached its apex with a trio of elaborate (and expensively produced) TV specials that Ward supervised for the Disneyland show. Due to their production costs, they were also released as all-color theatrical “featurettes” both in America and abroad after their debut on black and white television.\n\nMAN IN SPACE was produced mostly in 1954 and aired March 9, 1955, followed by MAN AND THE MOON on December 28. More production time was needed for the third installment, the most ambitious MARS AND BEYOND which premiered December 4, 1957.\n\nAll of these capitalized on the growing interest in space exploration, the last airing in the aftermath of the Soviet Sputnik launch, an ominous Cold War period event that literally pushed the United States into a space race. Plus flying saucers had been the rage for a decade by then and Mars was a particular favorite location for those seeking life-on-other-worlds.\n\nWard Kimball appeared in MAN AND THE MOON almost like an overgrown child captivated about the wonderful age we are living in where space travel will soon become a reality. I can only imagine his equal enthusiasm in this decade discussing the future of virtual reality entertainment or self-driving automobiles like the ones put out by Tesla.\n\nPaul Frees, that great radio voice on so many classic old time shows and later the creepy voice used in the Haunted House of the theme parks, provides our ominous narration as we explore, cartoon style, the history of man’s curiosity with the heavens above.\n\nIt all starts in cave man times and progresses through ancient Egypt and beyond. We get humorous busts of the Greek pioneers that include Ptolemy who defeated other more progressive philosophers with his backward earth-centric views, views accepted by many in Europe until Copernicus came into the picture with the needed math skills to prove that the sun was center of the solar system.\n\nWe then get a journey through the ever changing science fiction stories starting with French and Swedish writers in the 17th century and continuing into the 20th with H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, the latter with his own mock dictionary of Martian beasts.\n\nWard’s animation staff (featuring Julius Svendsen, Art Stevens and Jack Boyd with beautiful lay-outs by A. Kendall O’Connor, John Brandt and Tom Yakutis) has a field day recreating all of the imaginary outer-space creatures and humans on screen.\n\nPredictably anybody living on Venus is obsessed with love and romance and anybody living on Jupiter is expansive and huge, with the beings unable to even see each other and being afraid of Jupiterian horses (since Sagittarius is often aligned sign-wise with that planet and it is the sign of the centaur).\n\nThe whole UFO saga is investigated in zany cartoon form with pot shots at flying cigars that light up and the popular theory that aliens-are-walking-amongst-us-in-disguise. A hilarious bogus sci fi comic story is presented in the usual post-Playboy fantasy style with a lovely mink-shawled lady drinking martinis (?!), as secretary to a rather beatnik astrophysicist addicted to his pipe, suddenly getting abducted by aliens and having to fend for herself.\n\nAlthough the segment begins with a very sexist slant, she herself nonetheless gets to morph into a Wonder Woman action hero (something we rarely see during this time period) and wins out in the end by offering her adversaries atomic exploding cigars.\n\nLots of smoking going on here! Donald Duck makes a curious cameo among an assortment of weird beasties and creepy crawlees.\n\nDr. E.C. Slipher of the Lowell Observatory steps in during one live-action mid-section, in an otherwise three quarters animated cartoon, to discuss the more realistic prospects of finding life on Mars.\n\nHis prospects are not good, but that does not stop us from seeing more suggestions of what life could be like on Mars. After a brief showcase on how life evolved on Earth (cue the dinosaurs), we get clever montages of unusual worms and fish-like creatures (one oddball sponge-like beast vaguely resembles the angler fish seen in SECRETS OF LIFE) along with what appear to be spiny vacuum cleaners. I particularly like the flying wing-things that look like hang gliders.\n\nThings get very psychedelic at one point when the suggestion is made of crystal-like formations possibly becoming “life” and the screen explodes in kaleidoscope fashion. Must be due to all of the stuff that the production team was smoking, apparently not just tobacco. Throughout this show, George Burns provides some wonderful other-worldly music here, making this the ultimate retro “trip.”\n\nLike the previous two TV shows, we get in our final portion animated recreations of mankind journeying in futuristic space craft. Some of the designs, with Ernst Stuhlinger (backed by Wernher von Braun) shown presenting, are, in fact, ahead of their time and resemble what NASA is proposing today. There are also recreations of “high pressurized” enclosed cities recreated on our smaller planetary neighbor.\n\nI have watched this one multiple times on DVD since 2004 (when it became a part of the Walt Disney Treasures with the other shows included) and never get bored by any of it. It ages in spots from a scientific perspective, but is much too eye-popping to be considered “old” in any other way. The opening shot of “Uncle” Walt talking to a robot puts viewers in the right kooky frame of mind.\n\nBack to Ward…\n\nHis later years, post-MARS AND BEYOND, are still worthy of a little history recap. He and Walt shared a love of trains and already his hobbies in the area had been a topic in one of Jerry Fairbanks “Unusual Occupations” shorts for Paramount as far back in 1944.\n\nHe also headed his own jazz band, although not everybody with musical tastes shared the same opinions regarding his Firehouse Five Plus Two.\n\nDespite their friendship and mutual interests, Ward and his big boss didn’t always see eye to eye, especially when it came to politics: Ward wasn’t as supportive of Nixon like Walt was in 1960, but…by the same token…he wasn’t entirely with the Democrats all the time either and even made an anti-LBJ film (independent of Disney) in 1968 titled ESCALATION.\n\nOn an artistry level, he nonetheless got to beat to his own drum (or trombone as he preferred with his band) by making product that was hardly Disneyesque in style, earning an Oscar for IT’S TOUGH TO BE A BIRD (1969) which echoed Terry Gilliam’s outrageous work on the fledgling MONTY PYTHON series that was just getting started on British TV.\n\nHis final efforts for the studio were his animation direction for BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS and a 43 episode TV show THE MOUSE FACTORY that ended in the spring of 1973, just about the time he decided he needed a rest at age 59. An elder spokesman among Disney’s “Nine Old Men,” he remained active in many TV and video interviews up until his death in 2002."
