        "text": "Ward Walrath Kimball (March 4, 1914 – July 8, 2002), born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was an animator for Walt Disney Animation Studios. He was one of Walt Disney's team of animators, known as Disney's Nine Old Men. His films have been honored with two Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nOutside of his job as an animator, Kimball was a railroad enthusiast as well as a talented jazz trombonist. He founded and led the seven-piece Dixieland band Firehouse Five Plus Two, in which he played trombone.\n\nThis is a selection of various works with his involvement. Some being directorial efforts - like Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom or his Disneyland Space trilogy - animation work, interviews and even some work of his with the Firehouse Five (Plus 2). Kimball was a classical renaissance man and this small representation of work represents that well.\n\nVideo List:"
