        "text": "Ward Kimball, who has died aged 88, was an animator who made a significant contribution to many of Walt Disney's films, including Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Cinderella.\n\nWard Walrath Kimball was born on March 4 1914 at Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of a salesman who travelled widely; he grew up in the Mid-West, often with his grandparents. Kimball was an art student at Santa Barbara, California, before joining the Walt Disney Studio in 1934 aged 20. It was there that he met his wife Betty Lawyer, who worked in the Inking and Paint department at the studio.\n\nOver the next 37 years, Kimball progressed from apprentice animator to supervising animator to director and producer, working on most of Walt Disney's animated films and many Disney television features. He came to be known as one of Disney's \"Nine Old Men\" - the term Disney used to describe the veteran animators who had stayed with the studio through thick and thin, and whose opinions were of the greatest value.\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Kimball contributed to the Silly Symphonies series and to Mickey Mouse short animated films. He animated several sequences for Disney's first full-length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).\n\nBut his major breakthrough came in 1940 when Disney felt something was missing from the first Pinocchio script. Disney wanted to develop the unnamed cricket (who had appeared briefly in the original 1880 Pinocchio story by Callodi) into a more important ingredient in the film. He called upon Ward Kimball to create the character.\n\nFrom then on, Kimball's future with the Disney Studio was assured. His list of credits included The Five Crows for Dumbo (1941), Panchito in The Three Caballeros (1945), the Peter and the Wolf segment of Make Mine Music (1946), the two mice and their arch-foe Lucifer the Cat, for Cinderella (1950), the Mad Hatter's Tea Party and the Cheshire Cat for the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland (1951).\n\nHe was often - wrongly - credited with having devised the appearance of Captain Hook for Peter Pan (1953), but the Indian Chief in the film was all his own work.\n\nBy the early 1950s, Kimball was engrossed in a new type of animation: an experimental technique called \"limited animation\" which was deliberately two-dimensional in style. Although the style did not appeal to Disney, Kimball was allowed to produce a film employing it. The result was Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom in 1953, the first Cinemascope cartoon, for which Kimball received an Academy Award.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Kimball left the animated features department to supervise the weekly Disney television show. He collaborated with Wernher von Braun and other rocket experts on the Tomorrowland segments of the programme. The team was called upon to produce \"science factual\" (as opposed to science fiction) films to educate and enlighten America's youth with regard to space travel.\n\nWhen the first of these films, Man in Space, was first screened in 1955, President Dwight D Eisenhower telephoned Disney to express his admiration and asked for a print of the film.\n\nThe two follow-ups, Man on the Moon (1955) and Mars and Beyond (1957) were equally successful. Consequently, Kimball and von Braun were largely responsible for setting up the \"Tomorrowland\" exhibition at California's newly opened Disneyland amusement park.\n\nDisneyland offered Kimball a part-time outlet for yet another of his talents; he directed the Firehouse Five - a Dixieland band originally formed as lunchtime recreation at the studio - which became a popular attraction at Disneyland, much to Kimball's delight.\n\nBefore retiring from the Disney Studio on August 31 1973, Kimball contributed the engaging cartoon sequence for Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks. For all of his many contributions to Disney's films over the years, Kimball didn't receive film credits - Disney aggressively refused to allow his animators to take credit for their own inventions.\n\nBut Kimball had a special relationship with Disney. In 1938, Kimball had purchased a full-sized 1881 passenger train which he restored at his two-acre home at San Gabriel, California."
