        "text": "I rented this film cold at the video store -- and was very pleasantly surprised with a very well done movie. If you don't know anything else about Gattaca, the less you know, the better. Stop reading this review right now, go watch it, and come back when you're done!\n\nIt was after my first viewing of the film that several little details dawned on me:\n\n1) The term \"borrowed ladder\" is a utterly-brilliantly-conceived bit of future slang that carries a *double meaning*. I'm still amazed that the producers didn't make more of this. Instead, they were content to leave this gem to be discovered by the thinking and missed by the vast masses. I was very definitely impressed.\n\n2) As I was explaining the film to my wife, it occurred to me in mid-explanation that this is really a film that has to do with what is properly called =eugenics=; one of the things the Nazis were about. Then my mind wandered to word etymologies: I recalled that the name \"Eugene\" = \"well born.\" And then I realized...\n\n!!!\n\n3) It's interesting the extent to which so many of the characters in the film *didn't* live up to their genetic destiny, one way or another.\n\n4) Because I hadn't seen any previews, I had no immediate reference for where the name \"Gattaca\" had come from. And then I suddenly realized...\n\n!!!\n\n5) It wasn't until I watched the movie the second time that I caught the effects with the title sequence letters...\n\nNow I had figured out by this time that there were likely to be other intriguing little details I've missed, so I was fascinated to read from another reviewer here about the boy Vincent falling with a toy rocket in his hand.\n\nI wonder what else is in there?\n\nAll in all, this is a very well written, tightly woven movie. Seen cold, with no real prior knowledge of the film, it came off as a tremendous science-fiction SUSPENSE THRILLER. There were several scenes that just had me climbing the walls with tension. Fabulous job!\n\nAnd I'm not the only one who thinks so. When my WIFE says she wants to see a SCIENCE FICTION movie for the SECOND TIME... well, I don't think THAT has EVER happened before!"
