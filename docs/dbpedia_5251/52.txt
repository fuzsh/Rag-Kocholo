Story behind

Porsche 911 GT1

In 1998, Porsche celebrated its 50th Anniversary and it was a memorable one, as they achieved an impressive 1-2 victory at the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race. However, it was also a bittersweet year for the company as they mourned the loss of Ferry Porsche, who had passed away earlier that year. Dr. Porsche was present at the race, witnessing the team's 16th overall victory and celebrating the legacy of his late son.

The winning Porsche was a remarkable machine, powered by a 3.2-litre twin-turbo engine that produced 550 horsepower. The mid-engine layout and lightweight construction, with a total weight of only 970 kilograms, allowed the car to achieve impressive speeds and cornering capabilities.
