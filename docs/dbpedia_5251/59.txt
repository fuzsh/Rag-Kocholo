In the 90s, Porsche built the 911 GT1 Strassenversion. It was a homologation special based on the Porsche 911 GT1 racecar. In addition to the 23 ‘street versions’, one of the racecars was converted for road use.

The street-legal 911 GT1 (chassis no. 117) appeared at an auction in 2016 and was sold for around $3.14 million. The car was recently acquired by Tom Hartley Jnr. It was restored at a cost of approximately $407,000 by Lanzante – the makers of the road-legal McLaren P1 GTR. The car now features its original Daytona livery, which looks rather stunning.

The Porsche 911 GT1 is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-6 engine that produces 600 hp. The engine is mated to a 5-speed manual transmission that powers the rear wheels. The car can reach a top speed of around 205 mph depending on the aero configuration.

Porsche produced less than 10 GT1 racers for customer teams, and only one of them was converted for street use. Apparently, there’s another street-legal 911 GT1 being built as we speak.

Tom Hartley Jnr, has put this unique Porsche up for sale. However, the company has decided to conduct a private sale, which means only a select few will get a chance to own it.
