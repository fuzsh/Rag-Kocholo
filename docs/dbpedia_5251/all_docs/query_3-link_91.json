        "text": "Rare Bird\n\nThe idea of building a race car for the street is nearly as old as the automobile itself. And yet, while many automotive manufacturers have built homologated racers legal for on-road use, few are as hardcore as the mighty Porsche 911 GT1. This is a car that was slapped together solely to battle the mid-engine Group C competition of the mid-1990s, and 25 road-going examples were produced to satisfy homologation requirements. Recently, Tiff Needell got to sample one of them in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nRare Beast\n\nBy the conclusion of 1998, Porsche had built 23 left-hand-drive GT1s, and this 1997 model has just over 10,000 miles on the clock today. It's simply an incredible machine, albeit not one designed with many baked-in road manners. Regardless, the GT1 is certainly more reliable than many other homologation specials, and its on-track success makes it even more special.\n\n>>Join the conversation about this amazing 911 GT1 right here in the Rennlist Forum!\n\nProper Workout\n\nHaving competed in Group C racing during its heyday, Needell is already intimately familiar with the mighty GT1. Regardless, he's still admittedly a bit nervous driving the ten million pound ($13 million USD) machine around the wet roads filled with sheep, but that doesn't stop him from giving its mid-mounted, twin-turbo 3.2-liter flat-six a proper workout.\n\n>>Join the conversation about this amazing 911 GT1 right here in the Rennlist Forum!\n\nDriver Satisfaction\n\nEven today, that engine's 554 horsepower and the GT1's subsequent 3.9-second 0-62 mph time are undoubtedly impressive. And when you get on it, as Needell notes, that mighty flat-six produces a \"meaningful, punchy sound.\" The hot shoe also points out that \"this is what driver satisfaction is all about.\"\n\n>>Join the conversation about this amazing 911 GT1 right here in the Rennlist Forum!\n\nWork Required\n\nThat's not to say the GT1 doesn't require some work to operate. The seat was designed to hold its driver in place, not provide favorable ergonomics. Needell also notes that the clutch is \"very heavy,\" the brake pedal \"is like a brick wall,\" and yet, the steering is \"light and positive.\"\n\n>>Join the conversation about this amazing 911 GT1 right here in the Rennlist Forum!\n\nDifferent Gearbox\n\nAs for the unique synchromesh gearbox, Needell notes that it isn't like most racing transmissions that are quick and precise. In fact, it requires a bit of patience to operate, but that was by design - this gearbox was built to withstand the abuse it would endure in a 24-hour race, and that's exactly what it did.\n\n>>Join the conversation about this amazing 911 GT1 right here in the Rennlist Forum!\n\nGoing Wild\n\nAs one might imagine, the GT1's ride quality is rough, yet it provides ample amounts of feedback. The best way to drive it is with a relaxed grip, and \"to let it do what it wants,\" as Needell notes. \"This is where it belongs - out in the wild, going wild\" the hot shoe concludes. What I really love about cars like this is that when you're doing 60 miles-per-hour, it feels like you're doing 160.\" Perhaps one day, we too will be lucky enough to experience that magic on public roads.\n\n>>Join the conversation about this amazing 911 GT1 right here in the Rennlist Forum!\n\nFor help with maintenance and repair projects, please visit our how-to section of this forum.\n\nNEXT\n\nBACK"
