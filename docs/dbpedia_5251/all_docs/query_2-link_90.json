        "text": "What's your opinions on this?.....\n\nhttp://bringatrailer.com/2015/08/14/renn-strasse-porsche-911-gt1-replica/\n\nThis Porsche 911 GT1 replica runs an accurately recreated body over a tube frame, similar in concept to the carbon fiber clothed original. Instead of a twin turbo flat six and sequentially operated 6-speed, this one runs a GM LS-something V8 and Porsche 930 gearbox. Find it here at Albers Sports Cars in Musselkanaal, Netherlands for 99,500 euros (~$110,600 USD today). Special thanks to BaT reader Mels N. for this submission.\n\n993 GT1 Replica Front\n\nOriginally built as a somewhat cynical work-around of prevailing production car homologation rules, Porsche elected to develop a full-blown race car that would first be marketed as a road machine rather than vice versa with other GT1 spec cars such as the McLaren F1 and Ferrari F40. 25 Strassenversion cars were required per FIA homologation rules, though exact production numbers are difficult to come by. This one looks impressively accurate in 1997 Le Mans Hutchinson Telecom livery, though blanked off rear fender intakes aren't ideal. Note also the scraped up and tired looking chin spoiler–this thing likely sees more use than any authentic Porsche-built car.\n\n993 GT1 Replica Rear\n\nThe interior looks correct as well, wearing the same odd mix of 993 dash and 996-based door cards as found in production versions.\n\n993 GT1 Replica Interior\n\nHere's the business end. A modern, 530 horse GM LS wears unconvincingly Porsche branded carbon shields and is mated to what's described as a 930 gearbox–if correct, that means only four forward gears. Said to be in great condition, the seller adds that it runs and drives very well also.\n\n993 GT1 Replica Engine\n\nThough we approve of the Detroit V8 for its reliability, ease of maintenance and healthy power output, we can't help but imagine how cool this would be with a wrecked 996 Turbo's motor swapped in back."
