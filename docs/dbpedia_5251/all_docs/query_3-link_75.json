        "text": "In the mid-1990s, the impressive growth of the GTs (with namely victory for the McLaren F1 GTR at the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans) compelled Porsche to produce a new competition version of its 911. Called the GT1, it was powered by the engine of the 962 C prototype, winner at Le Mans in 1986 and 1987, and in 1994 in the Dauer-Porsche 962 LM.\n\nTwo of the cars were entered in 1996, entrusted to Hans Joachim Stuck-Bob Wollek-Thierry Boutsen (#25) and Yannick Dalmas-Scott Goodyear-Karl Wendlinger (#26). That year, the 911 GT1's main rival was also equipped with a 962 C engine: the Joest-Porsche-TWR driven by Manuel Reuter-Alex Wurz-Davy Jones. Also designed by the German manufacturer's engineers, the prototype held its own against the 911 GT1s, particularly thanks to less fuel consumption. It won the race ahead of the two 911 GT1s, the #25 followed by the #26.\n\nIn 1997, eight 911 GT1s were at the start of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Employing a strategy already used in the era of the 956 and 962 C prototypes, Porsche entered two factory cars and the six others represented private teams.\n\nThe 65th edition of the 24 Hours started off well for the two factory 911 GT1s. With no restrictions set on their two driver line-ups, Stuck-Wollek-Boutsen (#25) and Collard-Kelleners-Dalmas (#26) fought a stunning battle for the lead.\n\nBut on Sunday morning, Bob Wollek was forced to retire after an incident in the Porsche Curves. Despite 30 starts between 1968 and 2000 (which made him the driver with the second most participations in the 24 Hours after Henri Pescarolo), the French driver's lack of a win at Le Mans (he passed away in 2001) remains one of the most undeniable injustices in the history of the 24 Hours. The former University Ski World Champion and graduate of the ACO driving school debuted at Le Mans in 1968 with Alpine, before becoming one of the most preeminent Porsche experts on the planet: in 30 participations, he drove one of the German marque's cars 21 times!\n\nAfter Wollek's retirement, the #25 911 GT1 kept the lead until 1:45 p.m. but then had to throw in the towel due to a fire. The race was once again won by the Joest-Porsche-TWR prototype, with at the wheel Tom Kristensen, Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson. The private teams saved face for the 911 GT1 though with two cars in the top 10: Pedro Lamy-Patrice Goueslard-Armin Hahne and Antonio Hermann-Pierluigi Martini-Christian Pescatori finished fifth and eighth, respectively.\n\nSignificantly modified, the 911 GT1 also achieved a one-two in 1998. To be continued in the second installment of this series."
