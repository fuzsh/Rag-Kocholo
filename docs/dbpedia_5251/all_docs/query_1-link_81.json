Sports Car International named the Carrera GT number one on its list of Top Sports Cars of the 2000s, and number eight on its Top Sports Cars of All Time list. For its advanced technology and development of its chassis, Popular Science magazine awarded it the \"Best of What's New\" award in 2003.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Porsche LMP2000\n\nThe development of the Carrera GT can be traced back to the 911 GT1 and LMP1-98 racing cars. Due in part to the FIA and ACO rule changes in 1998, both designs had ended. Porsche at the time had planned a new Le Mans prototype for the 1999 season.\n\nThe car was initially intended to use a turbocharged flat-six engine, but was later redesigned to use a new V10 engine, pushing the project back to planned completion in 2000. The V10 was a unit secretly built by Porsche for the Footwork Formula One team in 1992, but later shelved. The engine was resurrected for the Le Mans prototype.\n\nPorsche Carrera GT concept at Petersen Automotive Museum\n\nPorsche Carrera GT concept at the 2000 Paris Motor Show\n\nPorsche did keep part of the project alive by using the 5.5 L V10 from the prototype in a concept car called the Carrera GT shown at the 2000 Paris Motor Show, mainly in an attempt to draw attention to their display. Surprising interest in the vehicle and an influx of revenue provided from the Cayenne helped Porsche decide to produce the car, and development started on a road-legal version that would be produced in small numbers at Porsche's new manufacturing facility in Leipzig. Porsche started a production run of the Carrera GT in 2004. The first Carrera GT went on sale in the United States on 31 January 2004.\n\nOriginally a production run of 1,500 cars was planned. However, Porsche announced in August 2005 that it would not continue production of the Carrera GT through to 2006, citing changing airbag regulations in the United States. By the end of production on 6 May 2006, more than 1,270 cars had been sold, with a total of 644 units sold in the United States and 31 units sold in Canada.[7] In the United Kingdom, 49 units were sold.[8]\n\nDesign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Carrera GT is powered by a 5.7 L (5,733 cc) V10 engine rated at 450 kW (612 PS; 603 hp),[9] whereas the original concept car featured a 5.5-litre version rated at 416 kW (566 PS; 558 hp).[5] A road test in June 2004 by Car and Driver showed that the car can accelerate from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.5 seconds,[9] 0–100 mph (161 km/h) in 6.8 seconds[9] and 0–209 km/h (130 mph) in 10.8 seconds. The official top speed was 330 km/h (205 mph).[9]\n\nInterior\n\nRear view\n\nTop view\n\nThe Carrera GT was initially offered with five basic colours: Guards Red, Fayence Yellow, Basalt Black, GT Silver metallic and Seal Grey. Custom colours were later available from the factory. A traditional six-speed manual transmission is the only available transmission.\n\nThe Carrera GT has large side inlets and air dams that help cool the large V10 engine framed by the carbon fibre rear bonnet. Fitted with Porsche's latest Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite braking system, the 15-inch (380 mm) SGL Carbon disc brakes are fitted inside the 19 inch front and 20 inch rear 5-spoke alloy wheels. Similar to other Porsche models, such as the 911, the GT includes an electronically operated rear wing which deploys at speeds above 113 km/h (70 mph).\n\nThe interior is trimmed in soft leather. Bose audio system and a navigation system were standard. In typical Porsche fashion, the ignition is present to the left of the steering wheel. This placement dates back to the early days of Le Mans racing when drivers were required to make a running start, hop into their cars, start them and begin the race. The placement of the ignition enabled the driver to start the car with the left hand and put it in gear with the right.\n\nThe basic colours available from the factory\n\nFayence Yellow\n\nGuards Red\n\nBasalt Black\n\nSeal Grey\n\nGT Silver\n\nCustom colors from factory\n\nTechnical specifications\n\n[edit]\n\nEngine[10]\n\nLayout: Longitudinal, rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout\n\nEngine type: 68° V10, aluminium block and heads\n\nCode: 980/01\n\nValvetrain: DOHC (chain-driven), 4 valves per cylinder (40 valves total), variable valve timing on intake camshafts, sodium-cooled exhaust valves\n\nBore × stroke: 98 mm × 76 mm (3.86 in × 2.99 in), Nikasil coated bores, forged titanium connecting rods, forged pistons\n\nDisplacement: 5,733 cc (5.7 L; 349.8 cu in)[11]\n\nCompression ratio: 12.0:1[11]\n\nRated power: 450 kW (612 PS; 603 hp) @ 8,000 rpm[12][11]\n\nMax. torque: 590 N⋅m (435 lb⋅ft) @ 5,750 rpm[11]\n\nSpecific output: 78.493 kW/L (105 hp/L)[11]\n\nWeight to power ratio: 3.23 kg/kW (5.31 lb/hp)[11]\n\nRedline: 8,400 rpm\n\nTransmission\n\nClutch: Twin-plate ceramic dry-clutch (PCCC—Porsche Ceramic Composite Clutch)\n\nGearbox type: 6-speed manual transmission\n\nBody[10]\n\nTank capacity: 92 litres[11]\n\nCargo volume: 76 L (2.7 cu ft)[11]\n\nMax. payload: 180 kg (397 lb)[11]\n\nGround clearance: 3.4 in (86 mm)\n\nDimensions:\n\nLength: 4,613 mm (182 in)[11]\n\nWidth: 1,921 mm (76 in)[11]\n\nHeight: 1,166 mm (46 in)[11]\n\nMass: 1,380 kg (3,042 lb)[13][11]\n\nTrack width: 1,612–1,587 mm (63–62 in)[11]\n\nWheelbase: 2,730 mm (107 in)[11]\n\nDrag Coefficient: 0.39[14]\n\nFuel consumption for 2004 model\n\nEPA\n\nEPA Rated city, highway: 9 mpg‑US (26 L/100 km; 11 mpg‑imp)/15 mpg‑US (16 L/100 km; 18 mpg‑imp)[15]\n\nRange: 241 miles (388 km)[15]\n\nTank in gal: 24.3 US gal (92 L; 20 imp gal)[10]\n\nNEFZ:[11]\n\nConsumption: 28.3 / 11.7 / 17.8 L/100 km\n\nCO2 emission: 429 g/km\n\nEmission level: EURO 4\n\nEstimated range: 516 km (321 mi)\n\nAuto Motor und Sport test:[11]\n\nMax: 22.5 L/100 km\n\nAvg: 19.7 L/100 km\n\nPerformance Test Results\n\n[edit]\n\n0–60 km/h (0–37 mph) : 2.06 seconds[16]\n\n0–80 km/h (0–50 mph) : 2.61 seconds[16]\n\n0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) : 3.57 seconds[16]\n\n0–120 km/h (0–75 mph) : 4.33 seconds[16]\n\n0–140 km/h (0–87 mph) : 5.13 seconds[16]\n\n0–160 km/h (0–99 mph) : 6.46 seconds[16]\n\n0–180 km/h (0–112 mph) : 7.59 seconds[16]\n\n0‒ 400 m (1⁄4 mi): 10.97 seconds[16]\n\n0‒1,000 m (0.62 mi): 19.42 seconds at 284 km/h (176.5 mph)[16]\n\nTop speed: 334 km/h (208 mph)[17] (official: 330 km/h (205 mph))\n\n80–120 km/h (50–75 mph): 6.35 seconds[16] (in 6th gear)\n\nBraking 100 mph (161 km/h) to 0: 277 feet (84 m)[10]\n\nBraking 60 mph (97 km/h) to 0: 101 feet (31 m)[10]\n\nBraking 100 km/h to 0: 33.5 m[16][17]\n\nSkid pad, 200 ft (61 m) ave g: 0.99[10]\n\nSport Auto tested a maximal lateral acceleration of 1.35 g, even 1.4 g was reached at the Schwalbenschwanz section of the Nürburgring Nordschleife, Motor Trend tested 11.1s at 133.4 mph (215 km/h) for the 1⁄4 mile (402 m).[18][10]\n\nTrack tests\n\n[edit]\n\nNürburgring Nordschleife: 7:28[19]\n\nBedford Autodrome: 1:20.2[20]\n\nTop Gear Test Track: 1:19.8[21]\n\nTechnology\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable technology includes a pure carbon fibre monocoque and subframe produced by ATR Composites Group of Italy, dry sump lubrication and inboard suspension. At speeds above 113 km/h (70 mph), the electronically operated rear wing raises into the airstream to reduce lift. The radiator of the Carrera GT is about five times the size of that of a 911 Turbo of its time. The car's front and rear suspension system consists of pushrod actuated shock absorbers and dampers with anti-roll bars.\n\nZagato\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2013, Zagato introduced the Porsche Carrera GTZ based on the Porsche Carrera GT. Commissioned by a Swiss Porsche collector and former racing driver, it has a modified carbon fiber body which is more aerodynamic. The car has the same technical specification as the Porsche Carrera GT.[22] Six Carrera GTZs were built.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
