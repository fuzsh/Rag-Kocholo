        "text": "Born from the dominance of the McLaren F1 at Le Mans in 1995, Porsche retired the then-13 year old 962 platform. Whilst the 962 was performing commendably, in 1995 Porsche commissioned the 911 GT1 to take back the fight. Merging the front end of a 993 with the rear section of the 962, the car was powered by a mid/rear mounted 3.2 litre, twin-turbocharged flat six. This afforded 600hp against the 1,150kg weight. The car was cloaked with a Carbon Fibre bodywork using the 993 as an inspiration.\n\nThe following year, the first iteration of the GT1 took 2nd & 3rd overall at Le Mans along with 1st & 2nd in Class. At the end of this season, the FIA recognised the rebirth of GT Racing through the BPR Global Endurance Challenge, renamed the series the FIA World GT Championship. As a consequence, the GT1 was developed further. For the 1997 season, Porsche would fit the 996-shape headlights as well a number of aerodynamic updates. From this Evolution and for strict homologation purposes, the Straßenversion would be born.\n\nStill very much a 993 underneath, the interior for the GT1 Straßenversion borrowed heaving from the 993 road car. With such a low volume run of a planned 25 cars, only a few changes were made to the customer road cars. The first three examples featured the 993 front end, all following received the 996 headlamps. The 3.2 flat-six received a mild detune to around 545hp with more practical road going gear ratios, the suspension changed to afford a more practical ground clearance as well as slightly more compliant on the road.\n\nThis example was delivered new to Germany and remained there until 2003 when it was acquired by a client of DK and was at that time looked after by ourselves having covered 4,400 Kms. Since 2004 the car formed part of two collections in the USA; having ‘Show & Display’ status, the car has been dry stored and used very sparingly, only leaving the collection for routine maintenance. As a result, when sold at a Gooding Auction in 2017 this example had covered just 7,900 kms from new. It was purchase by a UK collection and returned to Europe. It was subsequently EU taxes paid and UK road registered but has not been driven since.\n\nProviding the motorsport link in Porsche’s lineage, the 911 GT1 sits between the 959 and Carrera GT, and is perhaps the ultimate GT1 homologation road car form the marque. This example presents in superb original condition, showing virtually no signs of age, previous repairs or non-factory finish. So original is the car that it still retains and is currently fitted with tyres from its year of manufacture indicating that they are likely the original set! We are very happy to see this car again and to have handled its sale in 2019.\n\nPlease note, this vehicle is no longer for sale."
