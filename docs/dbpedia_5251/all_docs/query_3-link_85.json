One of the most distinctive and memorable Le Mans racers of all time, the 1998 version of the Porsche 911 GT1 rolled out of the Weissach factory in late February 1998. With a 3.2-liter opposed six-cylinder engine and twin turbochargers, the 991 GT1 produced 550 horsepower and speeds up to 205mph (330 km/h) in testing on the Mulsanne Straight."
