        "text": "Learn More\n\nWhat do you call a street-legal Porsche 911 that shoots from zero to 100.0km in 3.7 sec, and tops out at 310km/h? Why, the Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion of course! Developed to meet competition rules for the Le Mans GT1 Class, only 25 cars were ever sold. The production car it was based on was pretty much a race car to begin with. From its nose to its front suspension, the Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion looks like a type 993 911. But behind the seats you'll see lots of parts reminiscent of the Porsche 962 that competed at Le Mans in the '80s. The engine is a twin turbocharged flat-six with a 3.2L displacement. A chance to own this car rarely comes around. So here's your chance."
