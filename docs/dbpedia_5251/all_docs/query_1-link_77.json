        "text": "There are lots of special Porsches out there, but few are as special as this one. Why? Because it’s one of a kind. Being a 911 GT1 it’s already of rare stock - only 23 ‘Straßenversion’ road cars and 18 race cars were made - but this particular example is the only road legal racing version.\n\nDespite having ‘911’ in the name, the GT1 has little to do with Porsche’s famous sports car other than taking elements of the 993’s front end, and later the ‘fried-egg’ style headlights from the 996. Porsche mounted a 3.2-litre twin-turbo, water-cooled flat-six in the middle of the tubular steel chassis (no rear-engine antics here), which was wrapped in a carbonfibre body. Power? Over 600bhp - a potent amount in a car weighing only 1050kg.\n\nThe GT1 we’re looking at here was the only version to be given the Evolution upgrade from the factory - the others were upgraded some time after completion. It enjoyed reasonable success with privateer team Bytzek in North America, and underwent a £300,000 restoration in the UK from 2014-2015. It’s only been run for two hours since.\n\nSound like the slice of Porsche motorsport history you want in on? It’s going under the hammer at RM Sotheby’s Monaco auction on 14 May, but predictably, it isn’t cheap: the estimate is €2,700,000 - €3,000,000. Up to £2.3 million, in other words…"
