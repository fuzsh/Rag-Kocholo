        "text": "The 1990s was an incredible era with legendary supercars coming straight from the race track and onto the roads. The GT1 class of racing set forth rules that required manufacturers to make street-legal cars along with the track-only race cars to adhere to homologation rules, which meant that in order for manufacturers to save costs, they often kept the production numbers incredibly low and made as few of these supercars as they needed to: 25 total, including prototypes. As a result, all of these hallowed supercars are incredibly rare and celebrated, and the Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion is one of the greatest examples, rare, iconic, and decorated with racing achievements.\n\nMade in a production run of just 25 cars including the prototypes, the Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion is a stunning piece of racing and automotive history, and while it wouldn’t be surprising to see a car like that kept meticulously in a garage, this beautiful silver example is seen in this new video from YouTube channel Varryx out and about, driving to appear at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este in Lake Como, Italy. Seeing one of these cars at all is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but seeing one be driven is even rare and more spectacular.\n\nView All Porsches For Sale\n\nSources: Varryx via YouTube"
