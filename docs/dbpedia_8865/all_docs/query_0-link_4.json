Currency was confiscated from inmates and replaced with scrip, which could only be used in the camp. The scrip was part of an elaborate illusion to make the camp seem normal and appear as though workers were being paid for their labor, but the money had no real monetary value. The scrip was printed by the National Bank in Prague in 7 denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The notes are dated 1 January 1943, but were not distributed until May 1943. Peter Kien, a Czechoslovakian poet, artist, and inmate of Theresienstadt designed the notes, but his original design was rejected by SS General Reinhard Heydrich. He was ordered to make Moses appear more stereotypically Semitic in appearance and to arrange Moses’s hand so that it is covering one of the commandments.\n\nTheresienstadt ghetto-labor camp scrip, 50 kronen note\n\nObject\n\nScrip, valued at 50 kronen, distributed in Theresienstadt (Terezin) ghetto-labor camp.

While at the camp, inmates were compelled to work, and a special currency was issued to incentivize work output, but the money had no real monetary value outside the camp. Westerbork was established by the Dutch government in October 1939, for Jewish refugees who had crossed the border illegally following the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938. After Germany invaded the Netherlands on May 10, 1940, the German authorities began using Westerbork as a transit camp, holding internees until they were deported to forced labor camps or killing centers in other countries. Westerbork was under the authority of a German commandant, Albert Gemmeker, but run and supplied by the Jewish Community. Deportations from Westerbork began in February 1941. Inmates could occasionally purchase small supplies from the camp canteen, but food was not available. The special currency was first distributed in 1944, and designed by Werner Löwenhardt, a Jewish artist who was imprisoned by the Germans in Westerbork from October 1942, until the camp was liberated in April 1945. The front design features a large chimney from the camp laundry and a street known as the Boulevard of Misery. The back design again features the chimney, in addition to a large, toothed spur gear. Both images support an illusion of an industrious camp as well as the hopelessness of inevitable deportation.\n\nWesterbork transit camp voucher, 50 cent note\n\nObject\n\nVoucher, valued at 50 cents, distributed in Westerbork transit camp.

Mittelbau (also called Dora-Mittelbau and Nordhausen), located near the town of Nordhausen, was originally established on August 28, 1943, as a subcamp of Buchenwald, with the codename, Dora. In response to increased Allied bombing, prisoners were forced to dig huge tunnels in the mountains, safe from aerial destruction. Inside the completed tunnels, the prisoners then constructed factories and storage areas for rocket production. Once completed, assembly line production of V-2 rockets began in late December of 1943. Both forced laborers and German civil workers worked on rocket construction. To encourage productivity on the assembly line, authorities paid the prisoners with scrip which could be exchanged for goods in the camp canteen. Nine denominations were issued: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 5, and 10 marks. In 1944, Mittelbau was converted into an independent concentration camp with over 30 subcamps of its own. On April 4, 1945, with the Allied forces approaching, the Nazis began to remove and destroy evidence of their activities. This included the evacuation of prisoners from the camp and the destruction of documentation relating to the production of the scrip. Mittelbau was liberated on April 11, 1945, by elements of the U.S. 3rd Armored and 104th Infantry Divisions.\n\nCremona concentration camp scrip, 50 Lire note with a Star of David stamp\n\nObject\n\nScrip, valued at 50 Lire, distributed in Cremona concentration camp in Cremona, Italy. Under German pressure, Italian fascists passed antisemitic legislation in 1938, and later established domestic concentration camps for military and civilian internees. However, the Italian authorities resisted participating in the mass murder and did not permit deportations of Jews from Italy. Although the camps were called Campi Di Concetramento (Concentration Camps) the conditions and treatment of their internees were equivalent to prisoner of war (POW) camps for military and civilians. Prisoners, including Jews, were treated much better than their counterparts in the German camps. Cremona concentration camp was an internment and labor camp that held both POWs and Jewish prisoners. Scrip was issued to Cremona’s prisoners in exchange for outside currency to inhibit escape attempts. The scrip was printed in seven denominations: 0.50, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Lire. There are two versions of the scrip known today: notes printed on cardstock with a Star of David stamp, and notes printed on paper without a stamp. Expert numismatists disagree on the authenticity of the Star of David stamp version, with one side believing the Star of David stamped scrip was issued to Jewish prisoners in the camp, while the other believes the notes are not genuine. After the war, a Displaced Persons (DP) Camp was established by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Cremona from 1945-1947. In 1946 an ORT (Obchestvo Remeslenogo Truda, Association for the Promotion of Skilled Trades) vocational school was established in the camp. The camp housed between 1,000 and 1,200 refugees, and was one of the largest centers for DPs in Italy.\n\nCremona concentration camp scrip, 20 Lire note with a Star of David stamp\n\nObject\n\nScrip, valued at 20 Lire, distributed in Cremona concentration camp in Cremona, Italy.

The Jewish Council was ordered to create a system of Quittungen (receipts) that could be used as currency only in the ghetto. Valuables and currency were forcibly exchanged for the scrip and it was used as modest payment for forced laborers, though it held no value outside the ghetto. Ignacy Gutman designed all the denominations of the paper scrip and they were printed by the Manitius Printing House. The coins were designed by Pinkus Szwarc and minted in the ghetto by inmates. The Łódź ghetto was the only German ghetto or concentration camp that minted coinage. The scrip was issued in the German-controlled ghetto from June of 1940 to its liquidation in the fall of 1944. The scrip, sometimes referred to as rumki or chaimki, after the Elder of the Judenrat, Chaim Mordechai Rumkowski and was issued in denominations of: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mark notes; 5, 10, and 20 mark coins; and 50 pfennig notes and 10 pfennig coins.\n\nŁódź (Litzmannstadt) ghetto scrip, 10 mark note\n\nObject\n\nScrip, valued at 10 marks, distributed in Łódź (Litzmannstadt) ghetto.

While held at the camp, inmates were compelled to work, and a special currency was issued to incentivize work output, though the money had no real monetary value. Buchenwald operated 134 subcamps, and issued two different types of special currency. The exchange scrip had Außenkommando, outside command, printed across the front, and was issued to inmates working in the Buchenwald subcamps. The canteen scrip, which did not have Außenkommando printed on it, was used in the main camp. Both types of notes were issued in .50, 1, 2, and 3 mark denominations. Rottleberode opened as a subcamp of Buchenwald in March 1944, when prisoners were sent to excavate caves in the area. In October 1944, Mittelbau (Central Construction) concentration camp (also called Dora-Mittelbau and Nordhausen) in Germany, took over administration of Rottleberode. Under both administrations, inmates worked as forced laborers for the Junkers aircraft factory. The subcamp was evacuated in April 1945, as Allied forces approached. The prisoners were sent on forced marches to Niedersachswerfen subcamp and Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany. The majority of them did not survive.\n\nBuchenwald subcamp scrip, 1 Reichsmark note for use in Rottleberode\n\nObject\n\nScrip, valued at 1 Reichsmark, distributed in Rottleberode, a subcamp of Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.

While held at the camp, inmates were compelled to work, and a special currency was issued to incentivize work output, though the money had no real monetary value. Buchenwald operated 134 subcamps, and issued two different types of special currency. The exchange scrip had Außenkommando, outside command, printed across the front, and was issued to inmates working in the Buchenwald subcamps. The canteen scrip, which did not have Außenkommando printed on it, was used in the main camp. Both types of notes were issued in .50, 1, 2, and 3 mark denominations. Buchenwald was established by the German government in July 1937, mainly to confine political prisoners. Jewish prisoners did not arrive at the camp until November 1938, when German SS and police officers began sending large numbers of Jewish men following the Kristallnacht program. Women were not sent to the camp until late 1943 or early 1944, and they worked mainly in the munitions factories in the subcamps. In early April 1945, as US forces approached Buchenwald concentration camp, the German guards began to evacuate the camp. On April 11, the prisoners revolted and seized control of the facilities. Later that day, US soldiers from the Sixth Army Armored Division, part of the Third Army, arrived in camp and discovered more than 21,000 starving and ill inmates.\n\nBuchenwald subcamp scrip, -.50 Reichsmark note for use in Rottleberode\n\nObject\n\nScrip, valued at .50 Reichsmark, distributed in Rottleberode, a subcamp of Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) team 596 issued three denominations of scrip: 10 cents, 50 cents, and 1 dollar. The scrip was used in the canteen until July, but was abandoned due to food shortages. During World War II, many Lithuanians were deported to Nazi Germany as forced laborers. Toward the end of the war, many more escaped Lithuania before the advancing Soviet army, fearing a continuation of the mass arrests and deportations the Soviets inflicted on the public during their occupation under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Consequently, after World War II, Germany had a large population of Lithuanian displaced persons (DPs). The Scheinfeld DP camp was established on April 28, 1946, by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). An agency that provided DPs with food, clothing, medicine, and helped to repatriate people to their home countries. The camp housed 1,500 Lithuanian displaced persons who had been transferred from Regensburg DP camp, and was overseen by UNRRA team 569. The camp was located on the grounds of the 17th century, Schwarzenberg castle, and included a hospital, dental clinic, sanitation office, drug store, canteen, bakery, clothing store, two restaurants, and laundry and shoe repair services. In the barrack section, a large hall held various programs, concerts, lectures, and plays. The camp was closed in the autumn of 1949. It was thought that all the notes were destroyed, until approximately 15 sets were discovered in England in the 1970s.\n\nScheinfeld Displaced Persons Camp scrip, 50 cent note\n\nObject\n\nScrip, valued at 50 cents distributed in Scheinfeld displaced persons camp (DP) in Scheinfeld, Germany from April until July, 1946.

The currency was issued in seven denominations: 1, 10, and 50 Reichspfennig and 1, 2, 5, and 10 Reichsmark. After the beginning of World War II in September, 1939, Nazi Germany established a network of approximately 75 POW camps to house the enemy soldiers they captured across Europe. A prisoner’s treatment inside the camps varied depending on their nationality. Due to the Nazi belief that Soviet prisoners were racially and politically inferior, they were starved and treated brutally, resulting in millions of deaths. However, for Western Allied prisoners, life inside the camps was tough but generally fair, as Germany, with some exceptions, usually followed the Geneva Convention Rules for ethical treatment of POWs. Prisoners received meager rations supplemented with Red Cross food parcels and, with the exception of officers, were required to work, often performing hard labor. To compensate the prisoners for their work, Germany distributed currency that was to be used in the POW camps. The notes only held value in the POW camps and their official use was for the purchase of goods from the canteens. However, the canteens were poorly stocked, which rendered the notes essentially worthless. Many prisoners used the notes for gambling among themselves to combat boredom. The notes were discontinued in 1944. In response, prisoners in Polish camps created their own currency for internal use.\n\nGerman Prisoner of War Camp general issue currency, kriegsgefangenen lagergeld, 50 Reichspfennig\n\nObject\n\nGerman prisoner of war (POW) currency, called kriegsgfangenen lagergeld (war cash), valued at 50 Reichspfennig, distributed to prisoners held in German POW camps from 1939 to 1944.

The scrip has a repeating “MWH” across the note, representing the Metallwerke Holleischen GmbH logo, and was printed in 17 denominations ranging in value from 1 Reichspfennig (rpf) to 5 Reichsmark (rm). The Holleischen subcamp was established in Czechoslovakia, near the German-Czech border, in 1941. It included a men’s camp and a women’s camp, and all inmates were forced to work either in the factory or in construction. Initially, the camps were constructed for Czech forced laborers, but in June 1941, the first French and Russian prisoners of war (POWs) arrived in the men’s camp. In the women’s camp, by 1944, the majority of the prisoners were French, followed by Polish people and Russians. There were hardly any Jews in the camp until March 1945, when a group of Hungarian Jewish women were transported from Nürnberg, a Flossenbürg subcamp, following its evacuation.
