        "text": "IfTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce hadn’t already established themselves as the global power couple, then perhaps both of them being among the winners at the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards 2024 will now make that status official...\n\nWhat awards did Taylor Swift win at the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards 2024?\n\nThere were some big-name winners at the event at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, California, which recognises the achievements of performers in television, film, music and “other” categories, which includes sport and content creation.\n\nSwift led the way by claiming three music prizes, namely favorite female artist, favorite global music star and favorite ticket of the year for The Eras Tour.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo and Barbie among multiple winners\n\nOlivia Rodrigo picked up two awards, one for television (favorite female TV star) and one for music (favourite album for Guts), while Barbie was another multiple winner.\n\nThe film itself was named favorite movie, Margot Robbie was voted favourite movie actress and the song Barbie World, by Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice and Aqua, won favorite music collaboration.\n\nSimone Biles, preparing for the 2024 Olympic Games, won favorite female sports star, with Kelce picking up the male prize. Dating Swift may have had something to do with that...\n\nNickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards 2024 winners\n\nTelevision\n\nFilm\n\nMusic\n\nOther categories"
