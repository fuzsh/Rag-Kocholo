        "text": "View the list: A-F\n\n57 | President & CEO, Women for Women International\n\nLaurie Adams\n\nLaurie Adams is the CEO of Women for Women International (WfWI), a humanitarian nonprofit that has helped support war-affected women worldwide to rebuild their lives and communities. Founded in 1993, Adams has led the organization since 2017. Under her leadership, WfWI's reach has expanded from eight to 17 countries, bringing critical aid to active conflict areas such as Ukraine, Sudan, Palestine and Israel. Before coming to WfWI, Adams served as London-based charity Oxfam's first women's rights director.\n\n61 | President & CEO, Hispanics in Philanthropy\n\nAna Marie Argilagos\n\nIn 2018, Ana Marie Argilagos ascended to the head of Hispanics in Philanthropy, a network of donors helping to support the nearly 64 million Hispanic people across the United States (roughly 19% of the population). Through her role, Argilagos is focused on spearheading giving that expands economic opportunities for Hispanic communities. Before joining Hispanics in Philanthropy, Argilagos held leadership roles for the Ford Foundation and National Association of Hispanic Journalists. She also served as Deputy Chief of Staff for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; during her five-year tenure, she created the Office for International and Philanthropic Innovation.\n\n65 | Founder & President, Support + Feed\n\nMaggie Baird\n\nLongtime actress and mother of Grammy Award-winning artists Billie Eilish and Finneas, Maggie Baird added founder to her list of titles in 2020 when she launched the nonprofit Support + Feed. Now in 41 cities around the globe, Baird founded the organization as a Covid crisis response for farms and restaurants in Los Angeles. The concept was simple: Allow people to buy meals from local restaurants—to help protect those jobs—and then donate those meals to people in need in the local area. A vegan, Baird is using the organization to promote plant-based eating: Support + Feed has distributed nearly 600,000 plant-based meals and pantry items..\n\n73 | Cofounder & President, Pilots N Paws\n\nDebi Boies\n\nIn 2008, at 57, retired nurse Debi Boies founded Pilots N Paws to connect volunteer pilots to animal rescue missions. In the last 15 years, some 6,000 volunteer pilots have flown 215,000 animals from kill shelters to safe rescues and forever homes across all 50 states. The idea for the nonprofit came when Boies, a lifelong animal lover, sought to rescue a Doberman—one who’d once been used to train fight dogs—but unfortunately lived several states away. A pilot friend volunteered to retrieve and fly the dog, and once Brock was safely in his forever home with Boies, Pilots N Paws was born.\n\n54 | Cofounder, Black Voters Matter\n\nLaTosha Brown\n\nLaTosha Brown remembers being six years old and joining her grandmother in the voting booth; it was the first time she was exposed to the power of the polls, and the feeling would stick with her. In 2016, Brown cofounded Black Voters Matter to increase voter engagement among Black communities by going door-to-door, helping voters with rides to polling places and increasing the number of on-the-ground poll volunteers. In 2023, BVM worked across 184 counties in 24 states..\n\n61 | CEO, American Heart Association\n\nNancy Brown\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the U.S., and as CEO of the American Heart Association (AHA), Nancy Brown is dedicated to changing that statistic. Brown first came to the AHA in 1986, where she worked as a metro executive and development director for the organization's Detroit office. Over the years, she's risen through the ranks, ultimately landing the top job in 2008. As CEO, Brown has launched multiple multi-million dollar research initiatives and raised its revenue to $1.2 billion.\n\n50 | Founder, #MeToo\n\nTarana Burke\n\nIn 2017, the #MeToo hashtag went viral, kicking off a worldwide survivor-led against sexual violence. The phrase was first born over a decade earlier when activist Tarana Burke took to the internet in 2006 to form a support community with other women of color who’d survived sexual abuse and assault. The movement saw a resurgence once again in April following the news of a New York court overturning Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape conviction. In a press conference, Burke insisted that the decision was not a blow to the movement but a “clarion call” that she and other activists are prepared to answer.\n\n72 | Founder, A New Way of Life Reentry Project & SAFE Housing Network\n\nSusan Burton\n\nIn the U.S., roughly two-thirds of those who are released from prison are rearrested within three years and half are reincarcerated. Susan Burton knows how difficult it can be to break that cycle; she was in and out of prison six times over two decades before leaving for good and founding A New Way of Life (ANWOL) to help others find housing and reunite with family. In 2018, at 66, Burton founded the Sisterhood Alliance for Freedom and Equality (SAFE) Housing Network to advance the ANWOL reentry model nationally. It has housed over 1,100 formerly incarcerated people and provided other reentry services to roughly 20,000 others.\n\n54 | Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration\n\nIsabel Casillas Guzman\n\nIsabel Casillas Guzman grew up as the daughter of a small business owner, often working at the front desk at her father's veterinary clinic. In March 2021, at age 50, she landed a cabinet role overseeing the nation’s 33 million small businesses. She stepped into the job at a time when mom-and-pop shops around the nation were feeling the strain of the pandemic; in her first year at the agency, she deployed more than $450 billion in financial relief to get businesses back on their feet. An entrepreneur herself, she cofounded GovContractPros in 2018 to help government contractors access the federal marketplace.\n\n65 | President, National Women’s Shelter Network; Founder, Lotus House\n\nConstance Collins\n\nLeaving behind a 20-year business and commercial real estate career, Constance Collins founded Lotus House in 2006 to support homeless women and children. Now the nation’s largest women’s homeless shelter, Lotus House has since sheltered over 11,000 women and children—with over 80% successfully transitioning out of the shelter system. During the pandemic, Collins led the creation of the National Women’s Shelter Network to connect women’s shelters and safe haven programs across the country. The network has since grown to include more than 300 shelters..\n\n69 | CEO, Lever for Change\n\nCecilia Conrad\n\nCecilia Conrad is the CEO and founder of Lever for Change, a spinoff from the MacArthur Foundation that matches donors with nonprofits and individuals tackling the issues they care about most, like racial inequity and climate change. The organization—independent from MacArthur since 2019—has driven about $2 billion in grants and supported more than 175 nonprofit organizations. Earlier in her career, Conrad taught economics and held various roles at Pomona College for 18 years—until she gave up her tenure at 58 to run a fellows program at the MacArthur Foundation.\n\n51 | Founder, IllumiNative\n\nCrystal Echo Hawk\n\nCrystal Echo Hawk is the founder and CEO of IllumiNative, a Native-led nonprofit dedicated to increasing the visibility of—and shifting narratives around—Native American communities. Founded in 2018, the organization has called for sports teams to end using Native-themed mascots. A big win came in 2022 when Washington D.C.’s football team rebranded as the Commanders. In 2023, IllumiNative campaigned for the Supreme Court to vote in favor of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Upheld 7-2 in June 2023, it was a major victory for Native families.\n\n52 | CEO, GLAAD\n\nSarah Kate Ellis\n\nGLAAD’s standing as the world's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer media advocacy organization in the world has grown under the helm of CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. Ellis took the reins of GLAAD in 2014 and, over a decade, has doubled its staff size and expanded its operating budget from $3.9 to $29.7 million. In 2023, Ellis was invited to sit down with Pope Francis at the Vatican to discuss LGBTQ issues; a year later, GLAAD hosted a series of events at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos.\n\n54 | Cofounder & Chief Strategy Officer, Orijin\n\nArti Finn\n\nEducation technology company Orijin provides secure tablets, software and a cloud-based system to people who are incarcerated or on probation and working to earn their high school equivalency diplomas or learn new trades and skills. Arti Finn cofounded the company a decade ago and has since expanded it across detention facilities in 18 states. She says Orijin’s programs (which are free to inmates and probationers) are turning America’s incarceration system into one that provides genuine rehabilitation. “We are helping people create second chances,” Finn says.\n\n52 | Global President & CEO, Ronald McDonald House Charities\n\nKatie Fitzgerald\n\nKatie Fitzgerald had spent 25 years in leadership roles at America’s top nonprofits when, in 2023, she was tapped to take the helm of the Ronald McDonald House Charities.

She previously served as president and COO of Feeding America—the nation’s largest nonprofit tackling hunger—and president and CEO of Make A Wish Foundation’s Oklahoma chapter.\n\n60 | U.S. Chief of Naval Operations\n\nLisa Franchetti\n\nAdmiral Lisa Franchetti made history in November 2023 when she was sworn in as the 33rd Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). She is the first woman to lead the U.S. Navy and to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She came to the job with 38 years of experience as a commissioned officer serving at sea and on land in operations and policy. At the time of her commissioning in 1985, women were not allowed to serve in combat positions and her first assignment was an administrative shore duty posting. The combat policy was changed in 1993, which Franchetti believes helped supercharge her career.\n\n59 | Founder, Pivotal Ventures\n\nMelinda French Gates\n\nMelinda French Gates has long been one of the most powerful women in philanthropy and, at age 59, is entering a new chapter of giving. In June 2024, she announced that she resigned as co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to launch her own philanthropic effort—one specifically dedicated to helping women and girls around the world. French Gates intends to spend $1 billion in the next two years to support women, families and those who are fighting for reproductive rights. French Gates is also the founder of an investment firm and incubator, Pivotal Ventures, which seeks to close the funding gap for female founders.\n\n61 | President & CEO, Lutheran Services in America\n\nAlesia Frerichs\n\nAlesia Frerichs is the President and CEO of Lutheran Services in America, a network of 300 health and human services nonprofits in the U.S. She assumed the position in 2022; previously, she served for eight years as the network’s chief strategist for innovation, launching initiatives to transform child welfare, support older adults in rural areas, and promote race equity.

The foundation’s Open for Business Fund, a $420 million effort, has reached more than 203,000 small businesses and helped create more than 245,000 jobs..\n\n52 | Chair, National Council on Disability\n\nClaudia L. Gordon\n\nWhen Claudia Gordon started practicing law, she became the first deaf Black female attorney in the U.S. In April 2024, she was appointed chair of the National Council on Disability, which advises the federal government on disability policies. It’s not her first government job: Gordon has held leadership roles with the Department of Homeland Security (where she advised on emergency preparedness policies for people with disabilities) and worked at the Department of Labor. In 2016, she was part of the Presidential Delegation at the Rio Paralympics. A Jamaica native, Gordon continues to champion accessibility as a senior accessibility strategist at T-Mobile..\n\n94 | Chair of the Board of Trustees, Albert Einstein College of Medicine\n\nRuth Gottesman\n\nIn 2024, at age 93, Ruth Gottesman made the largest-ever gift to a U.S. medical school when she donated $1 billion to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to cover tuition for all future students. At the time, tuition for the Bronx school was more than $61,000 per academic year, amounting to nearly a quarter of a million dollars in tuition fees alone by the end of the four-year program. Gottesman initially intended to make the gift anonymously, but ultimately allowed her name to accompany the announcement with the hope that the donation might inspire other wealthy individuals. She is a professor emerita in the college’s pediatrics department.\n\n60 | Actor; Founder, Joyful Heart Foundation\n\nMariska Hargitay\n\nFor 25 years, Mariska Hargitay has starred as Olivia Benson in \"Law & Order: SVU.\" The role opened her eyes to the prevalence of domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse cases—and the work that remains to be done for survivors. In 2004, at 40, she founded nonprofit Joyful Heart to help support survivors and the professionals who work with them. In 2022, the organization launched endthebacklog.org, a website dedicated to addressing the nationwide backlog of untested rape kits. Hargitay regularly meets with political leaders to move the needle on policy and, in 2024, shared her own story of sexual assault in a powerful essay.\n\n69 | Ob-Gyn; Immediate Past President, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n\nVerda Hicks\n\nIn May 2023, Verda Hicks became the 74th president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

A gynecologist oncologist, Hicks was bestowed the Lou Peters award in 2002 from former FBI director Robert Mueller for sounding the alarm on a pharmacist who diluted chemotherapy medications for hundreds of patients, including some of her own.\n\n59 | President & CEO, Kenneth C. Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n\nChevy Humphrey\n\nChevy Humphrey is the first African American to lead the museum, which has been one of the nation’s premier science and innovation learning centers since opening for the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893.

She won the job with a unanimous trustee vote in 2020, and this year oversaw the museum’s official name change after $125 million donation to support the institution from Citadel founder Ken Griffin despite his move from the city.\n\n62 | Vice President, Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, Apple\n\nLisa Jackson\n\nLisa Jackson ran the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration and now oversees Apple’s efforts to lessen its environmental impact.

Inspired by carbon credits and airline loyalty points, Mehta and her organization pioneered social capital credits (SoCCs) to help people lift themselves out of poverty. In action, SoCCs are earned when individuals give back to their community by doing things like planting trees or repairing roads. Those credits, in turn, can be redeemed for digital or financial skills training, health care services or low-interest loans. This new kind of currency is being used in India, Ghana, Kenya, Taiwan and the U.S.\n\n61 | President & CEO, W. K. Kellogg Foundation\n\nLa June Montgomery Tabron\n\nIn 2014, La June Montgomery Tabron became the first woman and first African American CEO of the W. K.

Less than a year later, and just after turning 50, she channeled her pain into founding Overdose Lifeline. The Indiana-based nonprofit provides support for individuals and families affected by addiction and substance use disorder. In 2015, her advocacy led to the passage of Indiana’s Aaron’s Law, which expanded public access to Naloxone, a life-saving drug that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose.
