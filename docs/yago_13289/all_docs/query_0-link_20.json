        "text": "Robbie gets a porn video from his friend Kevin and watches it while his parents are out and he's babysitting Billie. Billie wakes up and wants to see a video so Robbie switches them over and puts the porn video in the shop case and falls asleep. The video is then collected up next day and Alan gets Carol to take it back assuming it's overdue. Alan says he told Carol it was his, and thought he was doing him a favour. Robbie is furious, and Carol is surprised when she takes it back and Nigel tells her that it's not his, and that she should avoid letting kids get hold of it. Nigel's lawyer has a heart attack so another one is taking over his case with Clare. The court case is fairly soon.\n\nMichelle is still wandering about in a sort of daze, with the pregnancy test in her hand. Gary turns up. She shoves it in a drawer and talks to him rather rudely, he says that she'd told him that she'd be back in a few days and the work is piling up as he didn't get a temp in to do it as she'd promised she'd be back. He then asks her if she wants a transfer as she obviously doesn't want to work for him. She tells him she's going to resign, and he points out her notice period is one month. She says that she's going on Thursday anyway. He is obviously extremely surprised and wishes her good luck. Michelle does the pregnancy test - it is positive.\n\nIan refuses to tell Cindy about his cheating, but he's bet the other team that he'll win and the losers are barred. Then Peggy stars off saying that they have new questions - and no mobile phones for cheating. Barry is there with Roy and Pat and talking to his girlfriend Lisa, so he has to hand his over! Peggy says the questions are not from the usual question setters - to be totally fair. Cindy whispers to Ian that she told Peggy about the cheats, so she's obviously done something about it. Ian asks why she didn't tell him, as he went to the pub to catch them. They weren't there, so he stayed and listened to the questions. Cindy says why didn't you tell me that. Ian and Cindy do rather well in the quiz anyway. Cindy is fed up that David isn't there and goes to see him. She sees him drive off quickly in his car, and is jealous.\n\nThe quiz ends in a fair draw with no cheats, though Ian is very irritating and keeps on hassling the other team, and saying they have unfair advantages. Everyone tells him to shut up. The two teams are so hyped up that they insist on a tie-breaker and it's a sudden death alternate question quiz. The other team get one wrong, and it's up to Ian - Cindy gives him a good guess, which turns out to be right.\n\nMark, Ruth, Pauline and Arthur are in the Vic, Pauline is still sulking. She leaves and Arthur follows her and they have a chat about Michelle. Pauline says she doesn't even like her any more, she's been different since the degree, and makes her feel stupid now. Pauline also accuses Arthur of being too friendly to Michelle and coming between them. Arthur says he can't tell Michelle to go away when she comes to talk to him about her problems. Pauline accuses Arthur of only telling Michelle what she wants to hear, and they are too alike. Arthur says actually it is Pauline and Michelle who are alike - stubborn.\n\nMark goes to Michelle's and she tells him she's pregnant. He asks what she will do. She says she doesn't know. Mark says that she will have to tell Geoff if she does decide she wants an abortion, as he has some say in it. Michelle tells him the baby isn't Geoff's. Mark is at a total loss and is practically speechless when told that it's Grant's."
