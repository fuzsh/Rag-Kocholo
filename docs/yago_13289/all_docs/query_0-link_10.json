        "text": "Robbie has taken refuge in the house while Ted goes on the prowl in search of him. Ted slams on the door of Number 25 while Alistair runs to Tony for assistance. When Alistair calls Frankie's accusations delusional, he shames her and throws her out of the fellowship. Alan curses her to hell, and Mick comforts a sobbing Frankie out of Walford for good.\n\nSonia's attempt to stall two police officers fails, and Robbie is taken to the station for additional questioning.\n\nMeanwhile, Bianca and Carol are having a good time in the city, spending the wedding money at an upscale restaurant.\n\nAs word spreads about Robbie, Alan takes charge of the situation, escorting Robbie to the station. Kathy is adamant about the allegations and believes Robbie is guilty. Robbie is released from custody following his interrogation and confides in Blossom that he slept with Sarah but told the police a different story.\n\nTed marches into the Vic, enraged. The residents begin discussing how there is no concrete evidence that Robbie raped Sarah. Ted becomes aggressive and confronts Sanjay after he makes a passing remark.\n\nKathy confides in Phil about Willmott-Brown.\n\nA strange woman loiters in the Vic, interrogating the residents about Sarah and observing the altercations. Tony confronts her with her journalistic credentials and issues a stern warning to leave.\n\nTwo men approach Carol and Bianca and are refused, following their decision to make amends with Alan and Ricky.\n\nBlossom goes to the caf√© to retrieve Alan for a paranoid Robbie. An enraged Ted, upon hearing Robbie's release, barges the door of Number 25 down and flies at a fleeing Robbie. Ted departs into the night. Alan and Blossom rush home to discover Robbie unconscious at the bottom of the stairs."
