        "text": "Consider this: If not for Mussolini, Ernest Borgnine (1917-2012) would have likely died an Italian count.\n\n“I can’t envision him as a count,” said Tim Conway, Borgnine’s co-star on McHale’s Navy, which premiered 50 years ago today, boosting both ABC’s and the Navy’s fortunes. “But maybe as a king—certainly not a count.”\n\nJust so! He was king of our hearts, tenderly capturing them in Marty (1955), playing a lovelorn bachelor for which he won the Best Actor Oscar. Two years earlier, he inspired fear and loathing with his gripping portrayal of Sgt. ‘Fatso’ Judson in From Here to Eternity (1953), a role he prepared for by channeling a character he’d known in the Navy. Many remember him more recently in his small but important role in RED (2010) ; as the voice of Mermaid Man in Nickelodeon’s SpongeBob, Square Pants opposite Conway’s Barnacle Boy; and will no doubt delight in his starring role in The Man Who Shook the Hand of Vicente Fernandez (2012) due out this month.\n\n“There were no limits to Ernie,” said Conway of his theatrical talent. “When you look at his career—Fatso Judson to Marty, that’s about as varied as you get in characters and he handled both of them with equal delicacy and got the most out of those characters.”\n\n“I wish I could act like you,” Gary Cooper told him, as Borgnine recounted in Ernie, the autobiography. “What you do comes from life, from experience. It’s real.”\n\nThe instrument of his acting was his heart and his head, he told Robert Osbourne in the Private Screenings interview in 2009, poignantly pointing to both. As he wrote in Ernie, “I believe in showing emotions, showing you have a heart.”\n\nHis heart was huge—“bigger than himself,” his widow Tova Borgnine said.\n\nHe wasn’t afraid to cry. “I started crying” on Larry King Live when discussing our troops, he wrote in Ernie, and “said, ‘Please, for heaven’s sake, if anybody lives next to a hospital, a veteran’s hospital or something, take a half hour, take an hour, take two hours, and go down there and visit our veterans. They would love to see you. Bring ‘em flowers or something. Just to say hello. Believe me, they’re hungry for people to come and see them... we owe freedom and opportunity to them. It’s the least we can do.”\n\nAnd, “he loved to laugh,” said Tova. “He laughed at himself, at life, he laughed with people, never at them.”\n\nAt his core, this giant of a man, both the actor and human being, was Navy through and through. The Navy “made a man out of me,” Borgnine said during his book signing in September 2008 at the Naval Heritage Center in Washington, DC and prepared him to take his place in the world. The two roles converged beautifully, his heart overflowing with gratitude in this moving tribute at the Navy’s Birthday Concert in DAR Constitution Hall on October 14, 2006, the last of five concerts he participated in.\n\nFrom Little Lord Fauntleroy to Tom Sawyer\n\nAs for Mussolini, he did, of course, seize power in Italy—ninety years ago this month, October 27-29, 1922—expropriating the substantial estate, including a church, and landholdings of Ernie’s grandfather, Count Boselli, financial advisor to the King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel—sending his daughter, Anna Boselli Borgnine packing with young Ernie back to North Haven, Connecticut and her husband Camillo (later Charles), also an Italian immigrant, of solid working class stock—albeit, early on, the protégé of Oscar of the Waldorf—who was now saving more and drinking less.\n\nRecalling that day coming into New York Harbor, Borgnine, just 7 at the time, wrote:\n\nEveryone was gathered at the railing, watching as we passed the Statue of Liberty. Except me. There was a sandbox on deck, and I noticed that there was no one in it. So I went over and started to play. No sooner had I picked up a little wooden shovel than my mother grabbed my ear… She dragged me to the bow, put me at attention, and slapped me on the backside... “When you see that lady, you stand at attention,” she commanded...”\n\nAfter the family reunited, “my Dad,” wrote Borgnine, “was true to his word. He had settled down and my parents were very happy together.” Soon they produced a baby sister for Ernie, Evelyn June Borgnine, and the two, he wrote, “became great friends.”\n\nWhile they were poor and had to scrap to make ends meet, Ernie grew up in a rich family and community ambiance, which he writes about in heartwarming detail in Ernie.\n\nLater, he wrote, given the emotional stress and hardships of acting, “All I can say is that I feel blessed to have been pretty grounded throughout my life… having been raised in a close-knit family that never judged me or made me feel odd or unwanted. They took Ernest Borgnine as he was…”\n\nAmong so many other rituals in those boyhood days, blissfully free of Ipods, Ipads, Twitter, Facebook, texting, emails, he loved gardening with his father:\n\nWe had a bigger and bigger garden every year because Mom wanted to grow corn and tomatoes and flowers for the table. So every day in springtime, before we went to school and work, my father and I would get outside and spade the ground. I loved that work, not just because it was something my Dad and I did together, but because I could see the results as the garden grew.\n\nWhile demonstrating solid acting talent in school, upon graduating, his father lined up work for him on a vegetable truck. One day, 18-year-old Ernie, finishing up his 3:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. shift, for which he earned $3 a week, saw this big sign blaring “See the World. Join the Navy.” He decided to look into it and soon enlisted.\n\nAfter graduating from boot camp, he shipped out on the Chaumont through the Panama Canal then over and up the Pacific Coast, among various land-based adventures, ultimately reaching San Diego and his assignment on the USS Lamberton where he rose to First Class Gunner’s Mate. He finished his first tour of duty just before Pearl Harbor, after which he was called up, and served on the Sylph, a retrofitted yacht he believed was “donated to the Navy to help the war against subs on the Atlantic” by, Borgnine wrote, “the man who invented the Murphy bed.”\n\nIn point of fact, as Vice Admiral John Totushek, United States Navy Reserve, Retired, President and CEO, U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation, said, it had actually been “commandeered” during WWI “because our Navy was in such bad shape.” This roughly 100-foot yacht had been “out-rigged with death charges.” Borgnine, Totushek said, “told the story that this thing was so old” the depth charges were basically “oil drums filled with explosives that they would roll off the side of the ship.” They would “try to run the ship over the top of the submarine and roll these things off in fairly fast sequence.” Borgnine described a scene that could have come straight out of McHale’s Navy, where “they were going to try and do some depth charging” only to discover once the order was given, the drums wouldn’t come off because “they had been painted so many times, they were painted in place.”\n\nAt the end of World War II, after serving 10 years in the Navy, Borgnine had no clue about Act II of his life. Then, one day, his mother said, “You always like to make a damn fool of yourself, making people laugh. Why don’t you give acting a try?,” he wrote in Ernie. “I looked at her, still not sure what to say, and so help me I saw these doors open and a light shined down from the heavens… I said, ‘Mom, that’s what I’m going to be.’”\n\nHe enrolled in the Randall School of Drama in Hartford where he was the first student in 14 years to receive good notices, but he hated the “hurry up and wait” aspect of the theater and told the dean he was quitting. “How can you leave?,” he asked. “You have a God-given gift for the theater.”\n\nFeeling the same restlessness as when he joined the Navy, wanting to “see the world,” he soon headed for Robert Porterfield’s famed Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, where “I worked my fool head off,” he wrote. “The navy had become my home but sitting here in the theater immediately felt like a new home.”\n\nWhen he played a union leader in State of the Union in 1949, he received rave reviews: “Here was a man who literally stole the show. All he did was walk across the stage, but he captivated you,” one review said, which he immediately sent home to his mother. A few weeks later, she passed away.\n\nFrom there, he was catapulted to New York City, with his new wife, Rhoda, and a head-turning role in a Broadway production of Harvey. But, he rejected new offers, opting instead to return to Barter to gain more training and confidence. Once back in New York, he worked with TV director Delbert Mann, his most important mentor, who would soon give him the opportunity of a lifetime in Marty . He had already turned in breakout performances in From Here to Eternity (1953) and Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), playing alongside Spencer Tracy.\n\n“He really had to work for it,” said Conway. “He just didn’t walk in and do an audition and start working in the business. He did some great stuff along the way obviously. And he did win an Oscar, I guess, didn’t he?” By 1962, after years struggling to build on that Oscar win, Ernie himself might have wondered.\n\nMcHale’s Navy\n\nOne day, Edd Henry, “a bigwig at Universal,” beginning to invest heavily in TV, called Borgnine to ask him if he’d consider playing the skipper of a PT boat in a new TV show they were calling McHale’s Navy. Harry Flynn, then with ABC’s on-air promotion department, said he replied, “No, I’m not doing television,” considering it a step-down for an Oscar-winner.\n\nShortly after Henry called, a kid came to Ernie’s door selling chocolate bars, saying he recognized him, his Oscar gleaming brightly inside, but couldn’t recall his name. So, Borgnine decided to play a little game, as he writes in Ernie:\n\nI kidded him and said “My name is Jim Arness.”\n\nThe kid frowned, “Naw, he does Gunsmoke.”\n\nI said, “You got me. I’m really Richard Boone.”\n\nHe said, “He does Have Gun Will Travel.”\n\nI thought, Son of a gun, this kid knows them all, doesn’t he?\n\nI told him, “My name is Ernest Borgnine.”\n\nThat got no response. Absolutely nothing!\n\n“Hell with this, I’m going to television,” Flynn said of Ernie’s reaction, and “he took the series.”\n\nBut, the funny thing is, there was barely a show or series to take. The producers had only just come to Flynn that summer to make a trailer to sell the show idea to ABC. Making trailers was a new assignment for Flynn. “They said, ‘we need a trailer for this new show and we’re going to call it McHale’s Navy.’ I said, ‘Oh that’s great. Where’s the stuff.’ They said, ‘There is no stuff, there’s no show yet. He did this show called Seven Against the Sea, so make a trailer out of that.’” So Flynn started going through footage with his editor Don Reidel, and was soon told, “Oh, incidentally, that was a 90-minute adventure story. This is a half-hour comedy,” prompting Flynn to say, “You are kidding.” But, somehow, he said, “we took a bunch of stuff that was not funny at all and made a comedy show out of it. I don’t know how the hell we did it... but evidently it sold and ABC wanted it.”\n\nRight after arriving back on the West Coast after a month on Martha’s Vineyard (his father had died suddenly on September 7, 1962), Flynn—no relation to Joe Flynn, who played Captain Wallace B. “Old Leadbottom” Binghamton in McHale’s Navy —found out in a meeting with the producer on October 11, 1962, the “show, a comedy, was now about to go on the air.”\n\nThat night he attended the premiere party at Ernie’s home in the Beverly Hills Flats, where he met Tim Conway for the first time—“one of the great comics of our era,” he said. The trailer notwithstanding, Conway, said Flynn—supported by “great chemistry” and “a great writer named Si Rose”—is the one who made it a truly “funny show.” It’s a sentiment Borgnine echoed, writing: “Tim Conway is a comic genius and in no small way the reason McHale’s Navy was so successful.”\n\nBut, that night at the party, they were just happy to have wrapped the show, “not realizing,” said Flynn, “how much of a hit it was going to be”—50 years later, still in syndication. ABC at the time “was the third network and struggling to get back on its feet.” Aided by the show, said Flynn, “ABC began to rise and became a contender.”\n\nAnother success, also involving a rise in altitude, averting crash and burn, he said, was more personal. Flynn, who was still in the Navy reserves at the time, was asked by his command to “get somebody from that show to go down to New Orleans on a recruiting flight; they would fly him down in a P-2, an antisubmarine plane.” So Harry Flynn asked Joe Flynn, “a delightful guy,” but deathly afraid of flying, telling him, “This will be fun, you’re gonna be with people who know what they’re doing and it’s not the same as an airline.” He tried it and liked it. “Evidently they did something to make him comfortable,” Harry said. “So he got over his fear of flying” and even made more appearances, going to “several places for the Navy, helping them in their recruiting in Navy airplanes...”\n\nTim Conway—Ensign Charles Parker—Remembers\n\n“OK, McHale’s Navy,” I asked Conway as an ice-breaker, “So, you went in like a nobody”—opposite this mega star.\n\n“And, I still am,” said Conway, without missing a beat. “I managed to maintain my station through life.”\n\nErnie, said Flynn, always said “He did everything in McHale’s Navy he was not allowed to do in the real Navy.” Tim Conway has an entirely different take, though he served in the Army, so that may explain a lot. As he told me:\n\nWell, first of all I had been in the service and I knew how screwed up the service was. So, a lot of the stuff was pretty close to being real, even the comedy part of it. It’s a weird place to be, I’ll tell you. I don’t know how the hell we ever won any wars. It was pretty much like McHale’s Navy.\n\nMore seriously, he added:\n\n(The Army) was a great place because it was all guys and you were all doing the same thing, so I loved it. A lot of guys complained about it. But, I thought it was great.\n\nAsked about the good-natured ribbing between the two services and the differences, he said: “Well, one has a lot of water and the other one doesn’t—they have a lot of beer.”\n\nAs to how the show worked so well, Conway points to Borgnine’s steady but gentle hand, guiding the team. Noting he sounded like “the skipper of the sitcom,” Conway said, “Absolutely.”\n\n“He made everybody feel at home even when they came in to do the smallest of parts,” said Conway. “And he was there always to greet somebody and help anyone who needed it.”\n\n“He never said, ‘Do it this way.’ He let you do it (character, scene, etc.) in the manner that you had decided on... If he felt it wasn’t right or it wasn’t really coming over the way they had planned it, he would say something, but never cruelly. He would just make suggestions and if you could do it, fine, if not, onward.”\n\nIt didn’t hurt that “The whole cast was pretty normal guys,” said Conway. “There was nobody who was standoffish. Even Ernie,” whose Oscar win made him “a big star and everything”—he was even made an Honorary Skipper of the Blue Angels during the show—was “one of the guys.” The camaraderie extended off screen. “We’d form touch football teams and played other schools and things like that for charities. So it was wonderful, it really was.”\n\nBack on the set, the love continued. “It was a pleasure to go to work in the morning,” said Conway, “because everyone got along so well.” Part of this is because of the freedom he gave cast to “act in whatever direction they chose.” His avoidance of “scene stealing” was another factor. As Conway explained, “many people, stars of his level would have said, hey that’s funny so I’ll be doing it, but he let a lot of things go that benefited a lot of the performers.”\n\nErnie also benefited the Navy he was supposedly spoofing.\n\n“One of Their Best Recruiting Tools... Ever”\n\nMcHale’s Navy was “one of their best recruiting tools... ever,” the Chief of Naval Operations (perhaps the Navy Secretary, too) told Borgnine in 1964 at a luncheon they hosted for him at the Pentagon, according to Flynn, whereas the first two years they didn’t want to go anywhere near the show. It was “an embarrassment.” But, the facts were irrefutable. “A lot of guys joined the Navy,” said Flynn, “because they saw McHale’s Navy and decided, ‘Hey that looks like fun’ and they put on the blue and the gold and they served their country.”\n\nIn the early 70s, Tova Borgnine said Secretary John Warner called her husband to deliver the same message to him personally.It wasn’t the last time he would hear that.\n\nWhen Ernie came to that book signing in September 2008, “we had put the word out so there was a pretty good audience,” said the Navy Memorial Foundation’s Paul Haley. “But Admiral John Cotton had filled the theater (about 250 people). So Admiral Gary Roughead said ‘listen, here are the marching orders. Go out, get a drink, a little food and go over and say hello to Ernie because Ernie is the reason I’m in the Navy. It was so many episodes of McHale’s Navy and I finally decided, ‘There must be something to this Navy.’”\n\nMark Weber, the Navy Memorial Foundation’s curator said several other admirals that day confessed the same inspiration.\n\nBorgnine and the U.S. Navy Memorial\n\nBorgnine’s “love affair” with the U.S. Navy Memorial, Vice Admiral Totushek said, began in 1997, when he was given the Lone Sailor Award, an honor he shares with others, like him, who excelled professionally post-Navy—including baseball legends Yogi Berra and Bob Feller, fellow actors Lloyd, Jeff and Beau Bridges, Tony Curtis, Bill Cosby, Eddie Albert, business leaders such as J.D. Power, Fred Smith and John Paul DeJoria, many Admirals including Hyman G. Rickover, Thomas H. Moorer, Stansfield Turner and William J. Crowe, and various statesmen including Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush, Gerald R. Ford, Richard M. Nixon, John F. Kennedy, Theodore Roosevelt and Senators John McCain, John Kerry, John Warner, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Daniel Inoye, among others.\n\nRear Admiral Henry C. “Hank” McKinney, then President of the Navy Memorial, brought the statue to Borgnine’s 80th birthday party on January 24, 1997 in Beverly Hills, featuring many glittering stars; but, the Admiral and Lone Sailor bronze statue shone brightest.\n\nSculpted by Stanley Bleifeld, the Lone Sailor Statue itself is mixed from artifacts off eight U.S. Navy ships and stands on the U.S. Navy Memorial located on Pennsylvania Avenue, between 7th and 9th Streets, N.W., across from the National Archives. It represents all personnel of the sea services.\n\n“Ernie was truly our living logo,” said Richard C. Vie, Chairman of the Board of Directors for the U.S. Navy Memorial. “As an individual, of all the people who have been involved with the Navy Memorial,” said Vie, “he did more to promote it because of his visibility and because he was in he Navy.”\n\nThe Navy Memorial, the only such military memorial in Washington DC, exists solely because Pierre L’Enfant incorporated it in his design for the capital city, originally closer to the Potomac River. Commissioned 25 years ago on October 13, 1987, it serves as the quarterdeck for the entire Navy, said Vie—the quarterdeck being the place on a warship designated by the commanding officer for official and ceremonial duties.\n\n“Just to give you an illustration of how sleepy this part of town was in 1987,” said Totushek, “they closed Pennsylvania Avenue for the celebration when we had the commissioning. Basically the celebration was done from the steps of the Archives.”\n\nBesides endorsing fundraising appeals, a bonanza for the foundation, Borgnine remained active from 1997 onward. In 2004, Borgnine served as Master of Ceremonies at the Lone Sailor Awards Dinner and later hosted “An Afternoon with Ernest Borgnine,” featuring the screening of The Trail to Hope Rose and Q&A. That year, he was also made an honorary Chief Petty Officer—a ship’s senior enlisted person, which the Navy established over 100 years ago. Ironically, the Year of the Chief Petty Officer is now being commemorated by the Navy and Coast Guard, featured in the Naval Heritage Center’s exhibition hall. The Center also has a wall commemorating fallen heroes including Lt. Michael P. Murphy, a Navy SEAL who died in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005, trying to save his men on a mission to find a Taliban leader. (The destroyer named after him was just commissioned on October 6 in New York.)\n\nIn 2009, Ernie served as Grand Marshall for the National Memorial Day Parade that included Edith Shain, the nurse shown kissing a sailor in Times Square in that iconic Life photo following the announcement of V-J Day on August 14, 1945.\n\nThe last time Ernest Borgnine visited the Navy Memorial was on Memorial Day 2010 when he laid a wreath to honor the Navy’s dead—as always gripped with emotion.\n\nAsked how Ernie would like to be remembered, Tova Borgnine said “his love of life, his appreciation of people, his craft most definitely.”\n\nAnd, without question, he will be remembered for his love of the U.S. Navy, his first home away from home, which he fantasized about so imaginatively or, depending upon your perspective, represented so faithfully, in McHale’s Navy, born 50 years ago today."
