        "text": "Los Angeles polymath Billie Bodega has been a creator for the entirety of her life. As a young girl, she discovered her love of singing in her school choir. At home, Bodega reveled in her motherâs diverse music collection, listening to everything from Led Zeppelin to Benedictine chanting.\n\nBodega began her professional career at age five, landing series regular and lead star roles on networks such as Lifetime, Disney, Nickelodeon, NBC, and WB. She also signed to Ford Models and did print for Nike, Yamaha, Guess, Nordstrom, and more.\n\nWhile music, dance, and acting were essential stimuli and creative outlets for her, education also played an enormous role in the formation of Billieâs passions. She moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to pursue her collegiate career at Harvard University, and graduated with an honors Bachelorâs degree in the visual arts, a minor in African-American studies, and a fluency certification in Portuguese.\n\nUpon the completion of her studies, Bodega returned to Los Angeles and began writing original screenplays and television concepts while simultaneously writing and co-producing her own music.\n\nHaving amassed a repertoire of original songs that are as diverse as the eclectic sounds she grew up listening to, Bodega released her debut single, âOcean Blues,â in March of 2018. Following the success of âOcean Blues,â Bodega secured a brand partnership with Neiman Marcus and released her debut EP, titled Koo dÄ âtÃ¤, later that same year.\n\nOver one million aggregate streams later, Bodega released her single, âLike Woah,â on May 15th, 2020. The sultry song enjoyed four weeks on R&B/Soul iTunes Charts in Latin America.\n\nIn 2021, Stevena removed all of her music releases from the streaming platforms. She also removed her posted content from her social profiles. Before completely deleting her Spotify artist profile its bio description read: your comfort zone is where dreams go to die.\n\nUpon her return into acting, she has most recently starred on American Horror Stories in 2022."
