        "text": "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)Beyoncé\n\nBeyoncé married Jay-Z five months before releasing \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It),\" a song she sang in character as her alter-ego, Sasha Fierce.\n\nPaul RevereBeastie Boys\n\nIn Beastie Boys' \"Paul Revere,\" the title refers to the name of a horse. They took it from a song in the musical Guys And Dolls where a character sings, \"I got the horse right here, the name is Paul Revere.\"\n\n(Walking) In the RainThe Ronettes\n\nRonnie Spector nailed the vocal for The Ronettes song \"(Walking) In the Rain\" on the first take -- unheard of in the perfectionist producer Phil Spector's world.\n\nHere I Go AgainWhitesnake\n\n\"Here I Go Again\" was a #1 hit for Whitesnake in 1987, but it was first released in 1982 with the lyric, \"Like a hobo I was born to walk alone.\"\n\nWhere Did Our Love GoThe Supremes\n\nHolland-Dozier-Holland originally wrote \"Where Did Our Love Go\" with The Marvelettes in mind, but they turned it down. Marvelettes lead singer Gladys Horton sang in a lower key than Diana Ross, so when The Supremes came to record the tune, Ross was forced to sing in a lower, breathier style than she was used to.\n\nS&MRihanna\n\nRihanna claims that \"S&M\" is about her love/hate relationship with the media. Apparently her paparazzi are using whips and chains.\n\nLoudon Wainwright IIISongwriter Interviews\n\n\"Dead Skunk\" became a stinker for Loudon when he felt pressure to make another hit - his latest songs deal with mortality, his son Rufus, and picking up poop.\n\nDirector Nick Morris (\"The Final Countdown\")Song Writing\n\nNick made some of the biggest videos on MTV, including \"The Final Countdown,\" \"Heaven\" and \"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone).\"\n\nPhil Hurtt (\"I'll Be Around\")Songwriter Interviews\n\nPhil was a songwriter, producer and voice behind many Philadelphia soul classics. When disco hit, he got an interesting project: The Village People.\n\n90210 to Buffy to Glee: How Songs Transformed TVSong Writing\n\nShows like Dawson's Creek, Grey's Anatomy and Buffy the Vampire Slayer changed the way songs were heard on TV, and produced some hits in the process.\n\nMarc Campbell - \"88 Lines About 44 Women\"They're Playing My Song\n\nThe Nails lead singer Marc Campbell talks about those 44 women he sings about over a stock Casio keyboard track. He's married to one of them now - you might be surprised which."
