        "text": "One of the cool things about R&B is hearing how the sound seems to constantly change from the previous decade. The 1980s was no different. It was an era that was moving away from the disco sound of the '70s and elevating with artists incorporating more electronic and pop sounds. The late '80s also marked the first time audiences heard of New Jack Swing, a subgenre that continued to make waves into the '90s era. From Michael Jackson to The Gap Band, here's a list of some of the hottest R&B songs of the '80s.\n\n1 of 35\n\n“Billie Jean” by Michael Jackson\n\nKMazur/Getty Images\n\nThere’s no doubt that Michael Jackson went from star to superstar thanks to his iconic album Thriller. The best-selling album of all time spawned seven singles, including the hit “Billie Jean.” Co-produced by Jackson’s frequent collaborator Quincy Jones, “Billie Jean” tells the story of artists dealing with groupies for all the wrong reasons. One of the most iconic moments in history was when Jackson performed the track on the television special Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, and his signature moonwalk dance move was born.\n\n2 of 35\n\n“Before I Let Go” by Maze\n\nPrince Williams/WireImage\n\n\"Before I Let Go\" is arguably the most recognizable song in Maze's discography. Written and produced by lead singer Frankie Beverly, the band released the track in 1981 as a single from their fifth album, Live in New Orleans. Almost 40 years after its release, Beyoncé covered the song for her 2019 film Homecoming, giving the track another resurgence for younger generations.\n\n3 of 35\n\n“Don’t Stop the Music” by Yarbrough & Peoples\n\nRon Wolfson/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nIn 1980, soulful duo Yarbrough & Peoples released their debut album, The Two of Us. Led by the hit single “Don’t Stop the Music,” the two sing about becoming so entranced with the music to continue to dance, so there’s no need to stop playing the tunes.\n\n4 of 35\n\n“Never Knew Love Like This Before” by Stephanie Mills\n\nParas Griffin/Getty Images\n\nIn 1980, Stephanie Mills released her fourth album, Sweet Sensation, which featured her biggest single to date, “Never Knew Love Like This Before.” The track is pretty self-explanatory: Mills beams about sharing a love she never experienced before, and now that she has love in her life, she never wants to let it go.\n\n5 of 35\n\n“This Is For The Lover In You” by Shalamar\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nIn 1980, R&B trio Shalamar released its fourth album, Three for Love, which included the hit single “This Is for the Lover in You.” Group member Howard Hewitt takes lead vocals to sing from the perspective of confessing his love and giving his lover a ring to show that he’s fully ready for commitment.\n\n6 of 35\n\n“Upside Down” by Diana Ross\n\nScott Legato/Getty Images\n\nSoulful diva Diana Ross worked with Chic members Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers on her hit single “Upside Down.” Since the track was released in 1980, the production still had disco elements heavily heard in the decade prior. “Upside Down” topped several charts, including the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n7 of 35\n\n“If It Isn’t Love” by New Edition\n\nPrince Williams/Wireimage\n\nBoy band New Edition teamed up with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on their iconic 1988 hit single “If It Isn’t Love.” On the track, the guys sing about trying to suppress their feelings for a love interest. “If It Isn’t Love” became a top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n8 of 35\n\n“Ain’t Nobody” by Chaka Khan\n\nPer Ole Hagen/Redferns\n\nOne of Chaka Khan’s most iconic songs is her 1983 hit “Ain’t Nobody.” Collaborating with her band Rufus, the track finds Khan singing about how she was once lonely, but now she has a new love, and nobody has made her happier. “Ain’t Nobody” won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\n9 of 35\n\n“Celebration” by Kool & the Gang\n\nGAB Archive/Redferns\n\nFunk band Kool & the Gang always knew how to drop proper tracks that kept people on the dancefloor. Their hit song “Celebration” encouraged listeners to party hard and celebrate the good times.\n\n10 of 35\n\n“Smooth Operator” by Sade\n\nTim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nIn 1984, UK band Sade released its debut studio album, Diamond Life, which spawned four singles, including the hit track “Smooth Operator.” The single was unique as it mixed soul and R&B with jazz and bossa nova elements, which makes it an easy listen. The track helped the band break into the US markets and became a top-five hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n11 of 35\n\n“Candy” by Cameo\n\nVinnie Zuffante/Getty Images\n\nThe ‘80s showcased how more artists were moving away from the ‘70s disco sound and into more funk and pop elements. Funk band Cameo showcased that immensely on its Word Up! album, which featured the hit single “Candy.” On the track, Cameo reflects on being so enamored with a love interest and captivated by them, like candy!\n\n12 of 35\n\n“When I Think of You” by Janet Jackson\n\nBob Levey/Getty Images for AIDS Healthcare Foundation\n\nJanet Jackson may be the youngest of the Jackson family, but she truly came into her own with her third album, Control. It was the first album in which she started working with longtime collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The album’s third single “When I Think of You” finds Janet reflecting on how she feels at ease and peace when she thinks of her love interest, something about the thought of him just makes her feel that the world is alright.\n\n13 of 35\n\n“Groove Me” by Guy\n\nKevin Winter/BET/Getty Images for BET\n\nR&B trio Guy, thanks to group member Teddy Riley, were the architects of a new sub-genre, New Jack Swing. Their self-titled album featured the hit single “Groove Me,” which is about a couple having an eventful night of love-making.\n\n14 of 35\n\n“Sweet Love” by Anita Baker\n\nParas Griffin/Getty Images\n\nThere’s no doubt that Anita Baker released one of the best R&B songs of the ‘80s with her single “Sweet Love,” but it’s arguably one of the best love songs of all time. On the track, Baker reflects on how much she believes in her partner and that their love can’t compare to anyone else’s love.\n\n15 of 35\n\n“Never Too Much” by Luther Vandross\n\nPaul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nIf there’s a list of one of the greatest vocalists of all time, Luther Vandross should definitely be on it.
