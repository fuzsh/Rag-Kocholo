        "text": "Buckle up because I've got a wild job hunt story that's too good not to share! üåüüïµÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è Picture this: I'm diligently scrolling through remote job listings, eyes peeled for the perfect Graphic Designer role. And there it is, shining like a beacon of creative opportunity. üíªüé® But wait, hold onto your virtual hats, because this isn't your run-of-the-mill job twist. This one's straight out of the twilight zone! üååüåÄ Instead of a design portfolio request or an interview invite, I was hit with a curveball that had me scratching my head. They didn't want me to design graphics; nope, they asked me to become an online shopping agent for an online store! üõíüåê So, here's the scoop: I politely declined the unexpected shopping agent role as it didn't quite align with my graphic design aspirations. üôÖ‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® But you know what? It's all part of the journey. I'm still actively searching for that remote Graphic Designer role, ready for whatever twists and turns come my way. If you've got any tips, openings, or your own wild job hunt tales, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's keep this adventure rolling! üåêüë©üíª #JobHuntContinues #DesignAdventure #remotejobs #remotegraphicdesignerjobs #graphicdesignerroles\n\nI just wrote a thread on Twitter / X, but I guess it might resonate better here. Is the current design job market a ghost market? üëª In January I formally exited from a company which I co-owned as it was acquired. From then on I had my focus on my new venture (qillo.co) as well as occasionally applying to roles that caught my eye. I've had a few interviews, but mostly I've just been receiving auto-replies with no explanation whatsoever. This morning I received the first auto-reply decline with a vague but actual reason: \"We reviewed your application carefully and have considered all of our open roles. Your professional background/skill set is not quite the right fit for any of the positions we are prioritizing at this time.\" The position was for a \"senior visual designer\" and was labeled as a remote position. As you can see, the stated reason for declining my application was related to my \"professional background/skill set\". Not my time zone or any other \"inconvenience\". To give a bit of context to this: I'm a director level designer with an 18+ year experience in fields of graphic, print, brand/Cl, web/app design and illustration, with a BA in GD. I've worked at agencies and was the co-owner of one, as well as in three other companies. So now l ask myself, if the requirements are so high or super specific, how can someone who is relatively new to this vocation ever really hope to get a job in this market, and is there a market at all, or are all those job boards filled with ghost jobs?\n\nHowdy folks! I‚Äôm searching for a new remote opportunity (contract, part-time or full-time) and appreciate any connections or leads you have. Below are a few highlights of what I do best. Brand Strategy/Foundation Building brands from the ground up is exciting because it means getting into deep conversations with all stakeholders in the same room. I‚Äôve built tried and true exercises and processes that establish strong mission, vision, and value statements so that company decisions are clear. My secret power is I often generate the right questions that steer product hierarchy. Visual Identities Building a visual brand with all of its parts is what I do best and finding new ways to make a brand distinct and fresh is forever my passion. Over the past 10 years, I‚Äôve designed all parts of visual expression to work together including logos, color palettes, typography, photography, and illustration. Finally, I get joy from documenting all parts of the visual identity through guidelines to support primary brands and sub brands. Art Direction/Brand Design I have worked both in-house and at agencies so I have the best of both worlds. I understand balancing budgets and goals for projects while still infusing high-level agency art direction. I‚Äôve worked on OOH, website creations and refreshes, web campaigns, murals, swag, print, events, explainer videos, live-action video spots, car wrapping, illustration systems and more. Illustration I started off as a classically trained illustrator and it‚Äôs my original love. I love doing most styles and those skills come in handy when a new visual identity needs a new style or needs more of an existing style. On the side, I still do editorial or tech illustration and have illustrated for clients such as Bon App√©tit, Gusto, Intuit, Facebook, Instagram, Salesforce, Wildsam Field Guides, plus more. I am open to contract, part-time or full-time roles as a Creative Lead, Art Director, Brand/Web Designer, or Illustrator needs. My portfolio is dribbble.com/camellianeri or camellianeri.co (illustration portfolio). My email is camellianeri@gmail.com. Thank you for any connections or opportunities. Message me if you have any leads. #OpenToWork\n\nIf you're a designer and you're searching a new role, PLEASE make sure you do these things when applying for jobs üëáüèº üôè Make your portfolio easy to find! It's literally what you're going to be judged on. We've had hundreds of applicants for our latest role. If I can't see a portfolio, I'm not wasting my time. üëã If you're going to reach out via messenger, make it personalised! My inbox is full of the same AI-generated message. If you think this makes you stand out above the rest, think again. üñ• Tailor your portfolio! If the role is specifically looking for experience in Brand Design, drop the empathy maps or the packaging artwork - it's not relevant. Job searching on Linkedin is tough due to the sheer amount of applications roles seem to get. All this means is that companies are going to be spending less time reviewing each applicant's portfolio. Make yours count.\n\nThink less of your struggles. Allow the history of your struggles to come when you've made it. Nobody needs to know it now. Just sit and brainstorm. How to increase your value. How to be of more value to others. Think deep about how things can be made better. Just Brainstorm! Think deep about how you can live life better üí™ Remember, \"Great works are products of deep thoughts\" Today is Friday, make sure you have a fruitful day üòâ Just in case you don't know, my name is Sunday Isaac I'm a Creative Graphic Designer who is very much interested in making sure your brand stands out through Excellent, Effective and Consistent Designs. I'm open to Graphic Design Gigs, roles, collaborations and connections. #tgif #friday #linkedin #graphicdesign\n\nDo I know any graphic designers with direct response experience looking for a FT remote gig? This is for a very high level team, and you'd be working on predominantly front end/paid ads. ***EDITED TO ADD*** Hey guys, I appreciate the fact that it's a great opportunity and there are a lot of creative folks out there looking for work. Please do not spam me with portfolio links with zero context or intro, random \"Hey, what's up?\" messages, and the like. I know the market's tough. I know it takes a lot of time and effort to apply for gigs. It also takes a lot of time and effort to look through applications and talk to people. If I were the one hiring, I would be more than willing to spend that time looking through applications and talking to people. Unfortunately I am NOT the one hiring. I just figured I'd see who in my network, preferably someone I know or who's a friend of a friend, might be looking so that I could pass through someone whose work I am already familiar with. ‚ñ∂‚ñ∂‚ñ∂ To that end, I have a decent amount of people to share with my colleague. No more applications on this one, please. ‚óÄ‚óÄ‚óÄ I appreciate all who have reached out and sent their portfolios. If I did not message you back, it does not at all reflect on the quality of your work or your desirability as a candidate. It's just the circumstances this time around."
