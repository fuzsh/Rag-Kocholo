        "text": "Billy Gene Jackson Sr. was born in Dawson, TX on March 28, 1943, to the late Thomas Clarence & Bennie Mae Jackson. He was an outstanding scholar with knowledge well beyond his years. He received his academic education at Blackshear Jr.-Sr. High School in Odessa, TX; however, while being a student he taught his peers as well as the community that when he was on the football field, it meant class was in session.\n\nUpon completing his education, Bilbo continued to pound the pavement. Never one to be satisfied with mediocrity, he spent the early half of his 20's exploring different fields and trades that would be essential to his success later with his own entrepreneurship. In 1967 by choice, not chance Billy decided to be all that he could be and joined the United States Army. After defending his country for 4 years he made his way back west to Odessa, TX to formally put down roots. As faith would have it, he would once again cross paths with his high school sweetheart, the love of his life Ester Jackson whom he wed on April 5, 1970. From that day forward they went on to exemplify their vows to each other for the next 54 years.\n\nBilly was heavily involved in his local community, from coaching the Vikings Football team to catching up with his fellow Lions Club members. He was a problem solver who often took on difficult and unwanted projects during his 35 years at TXU Electric Company until his retirement.\n\nHowever, whenever he had free time, he made the most of it. Spending it with those he loved and doing what made him happy. You could often find him watching his beloved Dallas Cowboys, spending time fishing, improving his handicap on the green and if you couldn't find him look no further than Woodson Park where he would chauffeur his sweetheart Buck on evening drives.\n\nHe has two titles that he held near and dear to his heart: Father and Husband. So only wanting the best for his family and to leave a legacy he used his knowledge with the support of his wife to create Jackson & Jackson Properties where he was a highly successful real estate investor.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father Thomas Clarence Jackson, mother Bennie Mae Jackson, 5 siblings Joe Jackson, Brevis Jackson, Thomas Jackson, Ona Faye Jones and Johnny May Lawrence.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his most precious memories: a loving wife of 54 years Ester Jackson; 4 son Micheal (Karen) Smith, Keith (Cheryl) Smith, Billy (Yolanda) Jackson Jr., and Greg Crawford; 3 daughters Melissa (Seward) Thomas, Stephanie (Ray) McBride and Lashonda Sims; 25 grandchildren, adorable great-grandchildren and a host of nieces, nephews and friends; 2 special nieces Nikki Graham and Lisa Forge.\n\nVisitation is set for Thursday July18, 2024, from 1pm-9pm with a wake service at 6pm at Martinez Funeral Home chapel.\n\nA celebration of Billy Gene Jackson Srâ€™s life will be celebrated at 2pm Friday July 19, 2024, at Bethlehem Baptist Church 1000 W Clements St. Odessa, TX 79763, with Pastor Darren Willis officiating and Pastor and Eulogist Michael Smith of Mount Bethel Baptist Church of Big Spring, TX.\n\nBurial with Military Honors will follow at American Heritage Cemetery 4100 FM 1788 Midland, TX 79707.\n\nACTIVE PALLBEARERS: Demetric Cole, Joshua Graham, Keith Givens, Kevin Lewis, Garrett Rollie, Bryan Jackson\n\nHONORARY PALLBEARERS: Seward Thomas, Billy Jackson Ill, Mikey Jarmon-Jackson, Zachi Jackson, Eric Allen, Chris Williams"
