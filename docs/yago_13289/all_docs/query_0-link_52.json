        "text": "About this time last year, Joel McHale (made a joke at the expense of Robert De Niro)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM6Qr8q9Uts] while hosting the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. In October, he made a bunch more at a Friars Club Awards ceremony in De Niro's honor. On Thursday, the comedian continued his evolution into a traveling De Niro roastmaster at a dinner hosted by the luxury watch brand IWC at the Tribeca Film Festival, which was co-founded by the New York legend.\n\n“Are you a glutton for punishment?” McHale asked De Niro, who appeared to be taking things well. “Don't answer that. We all saw the third Fockers movie.”\n\n“I can’t figure it out,” the host continued. “Here we are together, once more, engaged in this strange emotionally charged dance. I insult you in public, you pretend to laugh. You invite me to another event . . .”\n\nThen he got serious—sort of—when it came time to give the actor his due as festival co-founder.\n\n“Robert De Niro has celebrated artistry, creativity, and the resilience of New York City, which is a nice way of saying sir, you are officially forgiven for that Rocky & Bullwinkle movie—but not for Grudge Match. Not yet. We still need time.”\n\nDe Niro shrugged it off: “You never know.”\n\nThe dinner, held at the film festival’s new central hub at Spring Studio, drew a crowd that included McHale’s Community co-star Alison Brie, director Paul Haggis, and Christoph Waltz, handed out an IWC Filmmaker Award to director Deb Shoval for her in-the-works debut feature, AWOL.\n\nHighlights From the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival Red Carpet\n\n1 / 31\n\nHollywood\n\n“He’s Absolutely Extraordinary”: Remembering Robin Williams\n\nOn the 10-year anniversary of Robin Williams’s untimely passing, we asked more than 20 of his costars, collaborators, and friends—including Billy Crystal, Matt Damon, Ben Stiller, Al Pacino, Sally Field, Jeff Bridges, and Julianne Moore—for their favorite memories of this kind, playful, and uniquely intelligent artist.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ewan Mitchell Is Channeling Tony Soprano and Robert De Niro\n\nMitchell, who plays the one-eyed Prince Aemond, drops by Still Watching to chat about his character’s motivations and surprising vulnerability.\n\nCelebrity\n\nKamala Harris Clinches the Crucial Brat Vote, Thanks to Charli XCX\n\nKamala Harris, the Democratic Party front-runner after President Joe Biden halted his campaign, is the candidate the social media age didn’t know it was waiting for.\n\nHollywood\n\nRainbow’s End: Judy Garland’s Triumphs and Tragedies\n\nThe Wizard of Oz star never wrote her own story—but memoirs by her third husband and her second daughter, as well as one definitive biography, paint a full picture of the complicated icon.\n\nStyle\n\nEmma Corrin Felt “Free to Be Fluid” With Fashion at the Deadpool & Wolverine Premiere\n\nInside both of the star’s edgy, Cartier-adorned looks—from a Nina Ricci bodysuit on the red carpet to custom Miu Miu for the after-party, plus a top secret Marvel cameo they are “very excited for the world to see.”\n\nHollywood\n\nTrump’s Politics Aside, Do We Want a President With Pop-Culture References This Old?\n\n“The late, great Hannibal Lecter. He’s a wonderful man.” “Nobody could moonwalk like Michael Jackson.” “You know how many times I did The View?” Now that Biden is out of the race, please consider that these are actual statements Donald Trump has recently made.\n\nHollywood\n\nKamala Harris Impersonators Didn’t Just Fall Out of a Coconut Tree\n\nA handful of comedians already have the VP’s cadence and laughter just right—and could see their cachet grow as the presidential race heats up.\n\nMovies\n\nWhy Was Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway’s New Movie Buried?\n\nMothers’ Instinct is a perfectly solid domestic thriller with two Oscar-winning movie stars that barely got a North American release.\n\nHollywood\n\nSaturday Night First Look: How the SNL Movie Captures 1975’s Wild Opening Night\n\nDirector Jason Reitman calls it a “thriller-comedy” that counts down to the very first “Live from New York…”\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?"
