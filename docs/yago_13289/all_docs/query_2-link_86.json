        "text": "Smashwords book reviews by Billie Jackson\n\nHeller's Punishment on March 05, 2012\n\nAnother exciting, frustrating, delightful Heller. Just finished it and already waiting for the next one!\n\nSweet Masterpiece - The First Sweet’s Sweets Bakery Mystery on March 11, 2012\n\nJust read the first book. It wasn't what I expected but it was great. Already on the second on and loving it too.\n\nSweet's Sweets: A Sweet’s Sweets Bakery Mystery on March 28, 2012\n\nI have enjoyed this series much more than I expected. As soon as I read the first one, I had to buy the other three. Intrigue and romance combined with a touch of magic make for an interesting second entry into the Samantha Sweets series. The magic? box is again influencing Sam's life. The gorgeous sheriff's deputy Beau has made his interest in abundantly clear. I love to see happiness touch the lives of characters to whom I have become attached. The maybe magic of the box or amazing luck, something in short supply in Sam's life, has given her the opportunity to achieve her dream of opening her own bakery, but her contract to clear out foreclosed homes has two years to run and has once again involved her in murder. Working two jobs and trying to help solve a murder play havoc with her new romance.\n\nBlood Sport on April 23, 2012\n\nLoved it at least as much as Blood Ties and I got hooked with that one. Can't wait for the next one.\n\nBlood Ties on April 23, 2012\n\nAt first I had some reservations about choosing this book because the description seem kind of negative. I kept going back to it though and after reading the Heller books, I just couldn't wait. LOVED it. Tessie is tough and bad things, most of them in the past, do happen but there a some wonderful people in this town. Of course having hunks around doesn't hurt either. Once Sarge got wised up, I like him more than the gorgeous Jake.\n\nSweet Holidays: A Sweet’s Sweets Bakery Mystery on May 09, 2012\n\n(no rating)\n\nExcellent third outing in the Samantha Sweet mysteries. Murder comes close to home in three directions. Sam donates a closet full of closes from her most recent foreclosure clearing only to discover that one item is blood soaked. In the fast paced holiday baking season, Samantha has to rely on friends, family, an a little (or more than a little)magice to help keep her bake shop running smoothly while she helps investigate two, or is that one mystery. Despite her hectic she has time to worry about her fast growing love for a certain sheriff's deputy.\n\nSweet Hearts: A Sweet’s Sweets Bakery Mystery on May 09, 2012\n\nBoth awesome and sad. This book maintains the quality of the others but was more difficult to read because of the subject. The mystery was strong and the resolution good but I cried more than once. I wouldn't have missed it for all the tears. I hope the next one comes out soon and carries a happier note.\n\nVacations Can Be Murder: A Girl and Her Dog Cozy Mystery on May 09, 2012\n\nIntriguing mystery with just enough romance to hook me. After the struggle in Gamble, Charli is ready for a little break and where for a better vacation than Hawaii. While on a helicopter tour Charli and the attractive pilot spot a body in an isolated area. Drake and his boss become suspects so Charli feels compelled to help them out. I want more Drake in her life. Better pacing than Gamble. Over all really enjoyed it.\n\nClearwater Ambush on May 21, 2012\n\nEnjoyed this one at least as much as the first two. I loved the way they handled the tough situation with the little boy. Joe's dumb jokes at the beginning put me off but he more than made up for them. I appreciate his need to help people.\n\nNews from Dead Mule Swamp on Aug. 30, 2012\n\nThis cozy mystery left me wanting more Ana Raven and the people of Cherry Hill. Immediately followed up with Hollow Tree... Would highly recommend to mystery lovers.\n\nThe Hollow Tree at Dead Mule Swamp on Aug. 30, 2012\n\nI don't normally like shorter books/short stories but this one was so well developed that there was nothing short about it. Excellent story. Love the people of Cherry Hill. Can't wait for more.\n\nDaddy's Little Killer on March 17, 2013\n\nWow! I love this series. It is not the lazy cozy that I have been reading lately but the characters are wonderful. There is nothing more important in a book that characters who really matter to me. Intriguing plot, solid pacing, enough humor to get me through the tough times. Excellent book.\n\nBeneath the Cracks on March 17, 2013\n\nAwesome series. I had to read the first four books back to back and was so excited to learn the 5th one was out. The cloud of her past drives me crazy I have to root for Helen and Johnny! A well written story (the mystery) with good action plays counterpoint to Helen's development and the growth of her relationships, not just with Johnny, make this another outstanding read.\n\nForgotten Place on March 17, 2013\n\n(no rating)\n\nA riveting plot and the fascinating develop of Helen and her relationships with others makes for a third winner in the series. I enjoy the \"mystery\", but it is the characters that make me love the books.\n\nThe Chilling Spree on March 17, 2013\n\nThe best yet!!! If you have gotten this far, you probably don't need my recommendation but the books are worth talking about. I have become a major fan of a handful of indie authors in the last year and feel fortunate to have found LS Sygnet through both Barnes and Nobel and Smashwords. So glad that I can get the new book here before I can get it anywhere else! I love Smashwords!\n\nHeller’s Decision on Aug. 14, 2013\n\nIF YOU NEED HELP getting the download, check FAQ for directions or anyone on JD Nixon Brisbane Facebook page would be glad to help. You have to read it! It is great. I love the transition in their relationship and can't wait to see how it goes forward. We get a bit of Farrell, love him, and Bick too. All the usual goofs and family warmth in the Warehouse. More later.\n\nSpy, Spy Away on Dec. 31, 2013\n\n(no rating)\n\nAnother amazing novel by a wonderful author. Ayden is still trapped into acting as a spy inspite of her lack of training. No one believes her even when she tires to \"fess up\"; Fortunately her innate talents, luck, and great friends keep her alive for another round. Her relationship issues haven't gotten any easier, but I almost don't want that settle because too much would have to change for anything to work out. and I want this series t last for a long time.\n\nSpy Now, Pay Later on July 25, 2014\n\nDiane Henders is one of the best authors of today. Her amazing series is gripping, thrilling, funny and warm. In spite of the wonderful adventure and terrifying danger, the thing I love best it the great connection among the characters. Spy Now, Pay Later is my favorite of this awesome series, but it may just because I always love the one I am reading. This is definitely a reread book.\n\nBlood Tears on Oct. 31, 2014\n\nIt is amazing how some books can draw us in until our world goes away. Every book that JD Nixon writes does that for me and Blood Tears was probably the best of all. Tessie has felt trapped ever since she was forced to move back home to care for her ailing father. The malevolence of Little Town’s Bycraft family hangs over the whole town, but their ongoing battle against Tessie and her family her whole life has filled her existence with physical and emotional pain. For a while she felt she had some support in her fight against them in her sergeant Finn McGuire, but as this book begins he has been out of town for months and during that time the battle has escalated. The buildup of Tessie’s anger and frustration at feeling alone and helpless to control the situation is paralleled with the increasing aggression of the Brycrafts. To Tessie the town feels as if it is about to explode.\n\nAlways Devoted on April 06, 2015\n\n(no rating)\n\nEverything Karen Rose Smith writes is a winner. I love the Search for Love concept as well as the actual books and this one is no exception. The characters are amazing. KRS has such a talent for creating characters who become real people. I first discovered her writing through her Caprice de Luca Staging Mystery series and had to read other books she has written."
