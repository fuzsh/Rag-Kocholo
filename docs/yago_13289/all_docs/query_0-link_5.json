        "text": "Plot[]\n\nThe inquest into Pete and Rose's deaths continue with a doctor explaining the results of the postmortems. Michelle is in high spirits following her kiss with Geoff as she enters the courtroom. Phil is suspicious of Jimmy and asks Nigel to check out the Arches. Bianca witnesses Alan and Blossom arriving on the Square in the back of a taxi and is quick to inform Carol of what she has seen. Carol heads to No.25 where she learns that Alan is moving Blossom in with them immediately. Unimpressed, she argues with Alan, making Blossom uncomfortable. Nigel enlightens Phil to a BMW in the Arches. Phil and Grant race over to the Arches, realising Jimmy has set them up to be arrested. Phil gets the car up and running and Grant then drives it away before the police arrive. The coroner classes Pete and Rose's deaths as accidental after hearing from a vehicle examiner. Will makes a derogatory remark on the way out of the room, provoking Arthur and Ian, who decide to confront Will outside the court. Michelle wonders what is going on when the men are gone for some time and witnesses them arguing with Will. Arthur and Ian do not to tell her what is going on. David pays Ricky the weekly £50 that Pat owes Ian. Blossom calls a taxi to take her back to her flat but Carol feels bad so stops her going. She gives her Bianca's bedroom and moves Bianca in with Sonia. Bianca is unhappy with the situation, wanting her own bedroom. Jimmy is shocked when Grant and Phil return to The Vic with smug faces. Grant and Phil demand Jimmy turns out his pockets and after getting his money, warn him never to return. After arriving back home, Michelle decides to ask Ian what Will was saying to him outside the courtroom. Arthur intervenes and encourages Michelle to drop the conversation, but she deduces from their behaviour that the crash was not an accident and the Chapman's killed Pete and Rose.\n\nCast[]\n\nRegular cast[]\n\nArthur - Bill Treacher\n\nMichelle - Susan Tully\n\nIan - Adam Woodyatt\n\nPhil - Steve McFadden\n\nGrant - Ross Kemp\n\nPauline - Wendy Richard\n\nMark - Todd Carty\n\nKathy - Gillian Taylforth\n\nPat - Pam St. Clement\n\nRicky - Sid Owen\n\nDavid - Michael French\n\nJanine - Alexia Demetriou\n\nCindy - Michelle Collins\n\nNigel - Paul Bradley\n\nBianca - Patsy Palmer\n\nNatalie - Lucy Speed\n\nCarol - Lindsey Coulson\n\nAlan - Howard Antony\n\nBlossom - Mona Hammond\n\nJules - Tommy Eytle\n\nBillie Jackson - Devon Anderson (Uncredited)\n\nGuest cast[]\n\nJimmy - Gerard Kelly\n\nWill Chapman - Garrie Lammin (Credited as \"Wil Chapman\")\n\nCoroner - Michael Cochrane\n\nVehicle Examiner - David Warwick\n\nDoctor - Melina Day\n\nLocations[]\n\nAlbert Square\n\nThe Queen Victoria - Public and hallway\n\n25 Albert Square - Kitchen, living room and hallway\n\n41 Albert Square - Living room\n\nBridge Street Market\n\nLaunderette\n\nKathy's Café\n\nTurpin Way\n\nMitchell Bros.
