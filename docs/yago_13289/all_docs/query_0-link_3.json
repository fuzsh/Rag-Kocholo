        "text": "Plot[]\n\nDougie spend the morning watching kung-fu films in The Vic. The question of whether the insurance company will pay out plays on Frank's mind. Sharon hears Grant discussing the job plans with Dougie. She does not like what she hears. Frank stares helplessly at the car lot. Arthur continues his search for overtime and extra jobs to afford the car repairs. Michelle reminds him not to drive without an MOT renewal first, which is due tomorrow. Della and Steve collects items for their new hair salon. Sanjay cannot afford his council tax but is reluctant to turn to Ian because of the interest rates he charges. Phil asks Michelle about Willmott-Brown. Michelle strongly advises Phil to leave him and what he did to Kathy in the past. Sharon expresses her concerns to Michelle over Dougie. Robbie and Kevin steal beer from the shop when Mrs Andreos refuses to give them any because they do not have ID on them. Richard gives Sanjay the money he needs to cover his council tax. He and Alan then head to the betting shop, where Alan wins £50. Natalie checks out Della and Steve's new salon-to-be. She asks for a job so Della tells her she can be a sweeper when they open. Carol returns home to find Robbie and Kevin drinking beer. Robbie lies and claims Bianca bought it for them. Arthur takes his car for an MOT and it passes. Pauline delightfully tells Nellie. Dougie refines plans with Grant for the job. Robbie and Kevin hang out into the evening and then plan to steal a car and drive to a party. Robbie breaks into Frank's car and starts it up. Phil continues to phone around for Willmott-Brown's address, refusing to let what he did to Kathy go. Sharon pulls Grant aside in the bar and asks him if he is doing some work for Dougie. His failure to give her an answers confirms her fears. Robbie and Kevin enjoy a drive around the Square on their way into town, but they are forced to duck as they drive past No.41. Frank and Pat notice the car being driven and helplessly watch on. Robbie raises his head again but loses control of the wheel. The car hits a wall and flips onto its side.
