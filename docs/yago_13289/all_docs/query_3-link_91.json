        "text": "You’d Be Insane to Turn Down a Cold Guinness from Joel McHale\n\nRefusing the sip of a freshly poured Guinness means risking a friendship with Joel McHale. It’s as simple as that.\n\n“[It’s] one of the oldest beers on the planet, and it's possibly the most famous beer on the planet,” he tells me over the phone. “And there's a reason why ... it's because it's very, very good, and you should put this into your lexicon. Stout is much lighter than a Porter, and I think people can confuse those. When they see a dark beer, they go, ‘Oh, that must be heavy. That must be thick,’ and I don't find it that way. I find it perfectly balanced, and if they said, ‘I really don't want to try it,’ then I would say, ‘Well, I'm not going to talk to you anymore.’ I’m very strict that way.”\n\nRELATED: St. Patrick’s Day Is More About Quality Than Quantity for Actor Nick Offerman\n\nChalk it up to his half-Irish roots, but there’s just something about the Dublin-brewed beer that has McHale deeming it “one of the most dependable beers on the planet.”\n\n“Guinness threaded a needle like ‘Seinfeld,’ where somehow you got really perfectly wonderful, well-written, really intelligent jokes, and it appealed to everyone,” he says. “And that's how I see it.”\n\nWith that much passion, it only makes sense that the “Community” star don his hosting hat for an upcoming virtual trivia night this Thursday, May 21st at 8:00 p.m. on GuinnessUS Facebook Live that’ll bring the Guinness-charged one-of-a-kind pub experience with it. And did we mention it’s for a good cause, too?\n\nRead on to learn more about McHale’s help in raising money for Team Rubicon, the trivia topic he’d school you on, and his upcoming role as a staff-wielding, patriotic DC superhero.\n\nAskMen: Was the decision to work with Guinness a no brainer?\n\nJoel McHale: I really do love Guinness stout, and I always have. When they asked if I would host a trivia night to bring back some good times and the feeling like you're back in the pub, I said absolutely. They're donating up to $50,000 to Team Rubicon, and all that money's going to go help essential workers.\n\nOn top of that, they're being mensches and I'm donating some money. So every person who participates, Guinness is going to give a dollar up to $50,000. I hope we get 500 million people, but it'd be so great if we got 50,000, because as you know, you're at home, I'm at home and essential workers are out there breaking their backs and working really hard. I will be toasting them tomorrow night.\n\nWhat’s your plan to really replicate that pub-like vibe from your own home?\n\nI think you can create the feeling of a pub almost anywhere, but in these crazy times and unprecedented times, now you kind of have to make these little worlds in your home.\n\nI'm making a little comfy space where I can pretend, and maybe I should put a game on in the background and have it blaring just to complete the feeling.\n\nAnd yeah, I know a couple of bartenders in town ... Joe at my favorite place in Studio City. A lot of people think Studio City, there's no good pubs there. There are a ton of them. Maybe I'll just have Joseph standing next to me handing me bottles of Guinness. Yeah, I think that's what I'll do. You know, I'll probably take a shower. Get dressed, make it a special occasion. Comb my hair.\n\nIf you could craft your own trivia night, what’s a topic you’d pick that you would absolutely dominate in?\n\nI could tell you about World War II history. I know a lot of war history, because that's what I majored in college. I majored in World War I and the time in between World War II, and I just started educating myself on the Korean War. I took very little of it in college and I wanted to know more about it.\n\nI could tell you about edged weapons. I collect knives and swords and axes and hammers … I'm not kidding. My wife thinks I'm very odd. The kids sometimes get into them. She's like, “They might hurt themselves,” and I'll be like, “Well, then they'll learn their lesson.”\n\nTouching upon your acting career, fans might be surprised to see you all suited up as Starman on “Stargirl.” What did you soak up the most from working with someone like Geoff Johns now that you’re a part of the DC universe?\n\nIt was like winning an auction item where you get to be a superhero. I always wanted to do it. I got the offer and my agent was like, “Is this something you're interested in?” and with many F bombs later, I was like, “Oh, you know, yes.” I've never been more interested because I could fulfill this childhood dream of playing a superhero, not something that I ever thought would happen. I read the script and it's great … Geoff Johns is just walking around with a brain like that. And he is incredibly thoughtful, way too kind.\n\nI'm really just flattered to be in it. I'm not in it a lot ... I mean, I'm basically a guest star because my character is killed in the first episode. Spoiler. I don't know if I would fit in my suit right now, I'm like several pounds heavier, but it was just thrilling to do it. And the scale at which they made the show is pretty impressive. They made it look like, you know, they made it look like the real thing, like a real movie. It was pretty impressive.\n\nA lot of your “Community” family — Danny Pudi, Ken Jeong, Donald Glover, Yvette Nicole Brown — has shown up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with spot-on cameos. When’s it going to be your turn?\n\nWell, technically I've already appeared in a Marvel movie in 2005. But yeah, what the hell? I'll talk to Joe and Anthony [Russo].\n\nIf your “Community” character Jeff Winger ever made a return, would he be a Guinness drinker?\n\nOh, absolutely. He also drinks single malt scotch, but you can't just drink scotch all night. I mean ... you can, it's going to be quite a day, but yes, definitely. Jeff Winger definitely would. Hopefully in the movie we can include it.\n\nAnd since we are AskMen, what do you think ‘being a man’ means today, right now in the world we live in?\n\nWashing your hands all the time, wearing a mask when you go out, and being safe. Not endangering others by getting too close to them and leaving your mask at home. And maybe keep the errant body hair at bay. Keep it at a reasonable length, and you know ... amounts. Don't let it all go.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou Might Also Dig:"
