        "meta_description": "Bianca Jackson is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders played by Patsy Palmer. The character was introduced by executive producer Leonard Lewis and appeared initially from 1993 to 1999, when Palmer opted to leave. In 2002 executive producer John Yorke brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to EastEnders as a full-time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer. Palmer took maternity leave in late 2010 and Bianca left the series in January 2011. The character returned in December 2011 after Palmer signed a \"working mums\" contract, which granted her leave from the soap between April and November 2012. The actress quit EastEnders for good in 2014 and Bianca departed on 12 September 2014. Palmer reprised the role on 2 September 2019 for a guest stint and a second guest stint was scheduled for 2020, but later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 13 January 2024, it was announced that Bianca will return to EastEnders in the spring for a short stint to collide with the departure of her adopted daughter Whitney Dean. The character returned for 23 episodes; initially two episodes between 4 March and 5 March 2024, and again from 29 April 2024 until 12 June 2024. It was later announced in August of the same year Bianca would be returning again to tie in with the return of her father David Wicks.",

It was later announced in August of the same year Bianca would be returning again to tie in with the return of her father David Wicks (Michael French).\n\nDuring her first run on the show during the 1990s, Bianca was known for her bizarre sense of style - mainly her sharp tongue and fiery temper - as well as her romantic chemistry with established character Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen); the two represent one of the show's most memorable relationships to date, which is best remembered for when Bianca often screams \"Rickaaaaaaay!\"[1] whenever they argue with each other. She has also been featured in many central plot developments such as affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, spina bifida and having an abortion. Bianca's major storylines have included her dysfunctional relationship with her mother Carol (Lindsey Coulson); falling out with Ricky prior to their first marriage over his trysts with her childhood friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed) and love rival Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) on separate occasions; reconciling with her estranged biological father David Wicks; forming a strong companionship with her best friend Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon); feuding against Tiffany's volatile husband Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) over their ill-fated marriage; cheating on Ricky and betraying Carol by having an affair with the latter's boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass); coping with the discovery that her new fianc√© Tony King (Chris Coghill) is a paedophile who had been sexually abusing Whitney during the course of their romance and subsequent engagement; rekindling her affections with Ricky that leads to the pair getting married for a second time before they eventually divorce once again; going to prison for assault and theft; dealing with money problems; having a close friendship with her neighbour Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace); romancing with new love interest Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton) to the point of leaving the square with him; getting stalked by Tony's son Leo King (Tom Wells) over money that the latter's parents had given to her before his death; and dealing with depression."
