She has also featured in Minder, Boon, Taggart, The Professionals, A Touch of Frost and New Tricks, as well as The Two Ronnies and the Morecambe and Wise show.\n\nDiane has also enjoyed a rewarding career in film and theatre including Here we go Round The Mulberry Bush, the Oscar-winning Nowhere in Africa, and BEAUTIFUL: The Carole King Musical in London’s West End.\n\nBrian Capron\n\nBrian is probably best known for playing Richard Hillman in Coronation Street, for which he won a clutch of awards including a record-breaking five at The Soap Awards for Best Actor and Best Villain. He played Mr Hopwood in Grange Hill and more recently as Ozias Harding in Where The Heart Is. Brian trained at LAMDA and has also starred in the West End, nationally and on tour. His voice can also be heard regularly on the radio while his film roles include Emma, Still Crazy, 101 Dalmations and Ambleton Delight.\n\nSteven Pinder\n\nSteven is noted for playing the character Max Farnham in the soap Brookside and recent television appearances have been in True Crime, Holby City and Casualty. Other roles include Eddie Palmer in Hotel Babylon, the prosecuting lawyer in the case against Steph Stokes in Emmerdale and Stephen Baker in The Bill.\n\nSteven was seen on Celebrity Mastermind where he pitted his wits and won against Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Clare Balding and Rageh Omar. He has also recently filmed Celebrity Masterchef and Premier League All Stars.\n\nGabrielle Glaister\n\nGabrielle has enjoyed a long and varied career on stage and screen. She is perhaps best known for her role in Brookside, where she and Steven Pinder created the iconic couple Max and Patricia Farnham.

Her more recent television work includes roles in Sherlock, Unforgotten, Midsomer Murders, and ITV’s Cleaning Up.\n\nMichael McKell\n\nMichael started his professional career as a singer-songwriter but his music career was cut short by a serious car crash in 1991. Unable to walk for two years, Michael enrolled in The Lee Strasberg Institute and trained as an actor and made his West End debut in Blood Brothers, before taking the lead role in Macbeth at the Lyric, Hammersmith.\n\nMichael made his first TV appearance in Madson with Ian McShane. He has starred in A Touch Of Frost, Kavanagh QC and Doctors. He has also appeared in Emmerdale, as DCI Nick Henshall and EastEnders as Carter, the killer of Paul Truman.
