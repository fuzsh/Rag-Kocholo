        "text": "Holby City is a British medical drama television series that was broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom between 12 January 1999 and 29 March 2022.[1] The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama Casualty, which is set in the emergency department of the fictional Holby City Hospital, based in the equally fictitious town of Holby.[2][3] The show focuses on the fictional lives, both professional and personal, of the medical and ancillary staff on the hospital's surgical wards.[4] It is primarily filmed at the BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood.[5] The show aired twenty-three full series with over 1000 episodes.[6][7] Young wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in Casualty once they were taken away to the hospital's surgical wards.[4] He opined that Casualty limited itself to \"accident of the week\" storylines, while Holby City allowed the possibility of storylines about long-term care, rather than immediate life-and-death decisions.[8] A police procedural spin-off, HolbyBlue, began airing from 8 May 2007, running for two series before being cancelled due to poor viewing figures.[9]\n\nThe serial features an ensemble cast of regular and recurring characters, and began with 11 main characters in its first series.[5] Characters have since been written in and out of the series, and 16 actors were employed to the show's main cast at its finale.[10] Having appeared in over 500 episodes between the fourth and twenty-third series, the show's longest-serving character is Ric Griffin, portrayed by Hugh Quarshie.[11] Additionally, Holby City features a number of guest artists in each episode as well as recurring characters who appear in story arcs.[12] Many regular cast members in the show have made prior, minor appearances as both patients and staff members in both Holby City and Casualty. In 2015, casting directors hired Niamh Walsh for the regular role of Cara Martinez after a guest part as a patient in Casualty.[13] Producers will sometimes recast significant recurring characters when their original actors are unavailable for another stint. When the character of Beka Levy was reintroduced in 2018, her original actress Rhean McGee could not reprise the role, so they recast the role to Francesca Barrett.[14] Characters from Holby City have appeared in sister shows Casualty and HolbyBlue and vice versa. Although most characters only guest star, some have become regular cast members. Amanda Mealing joined Casualty as Connie Beauchamp in 2014, following a six-year stint in Holby City. Nick Jordan actor Michael French has had stints in the main cast of both Holby City and Casualty, and Clive Mantle reprised his role as Mike Barratt in Holby City in 1999, two years after leaving Casualty.[15]\n\nRegular characters\n\n[edit]\n\nCharacter Actor(s) First appearance[a] Last appearance[b] Ref(s) 19 January 1999 9 March 1999 [28] 19 January 1999 9 March 2000 [29] 12 January 1999 9 March 2000 [29] 12 January 1999 23 November 2000 [30] 19 January 1999 8 May 2001 [31] 12 January 1999 29 May 2001 [32] 25 November 1999 5 June 2001 [16] 12 January 1999 5 June 2001 [33] 13 February 2001 4 June 2002 [34] 23 December 1999 18 June 2002 [35] 12 October 2000 16 July 2002 [36] 12 October 2000 6 August 2002 [37] 20 March 2001 13 August 2002 [38] 12 January 1999 20 August 2002 [39] 25 November 1999 25 March 2003 [40] 29 January 2002 22 April 2003 [41] 12 October 2000 6 May 2003 [42] 5 October 2000 6 August 2003 [43] 5 October 2000 2 September 2003 [44] 16 November 2000 13 October 2003 [45] 6 June 1999 30 March 2004 [46] 13 August 2002 18 May 2004 [47] 13 February 2001 28 December 2004 [48] 13 May 2003 11 January 2005 [49] 20 April 2004 5 April 2005 [50] 31 December 2001 13 September 2005 [17] 17 June 2003 4 October 2005 [51] 27 November 2001 11 October 2005 [52] 23 October 2001 20 December 2005 [53] 16 March 2004 12 September 2006 [54] 8 April 2003 21 November 2006 [55] 3 May 2005 28 March 2007 [56] 3 May 2005 28 March 2007 [56] 6 November 2007 12 February 2008 [57] 5 July 2005 9 December 2008 [18] 7 February 2006 9 December 2008 [58] 3 January 2006 22 December 2008 [59] 28 November 2006 26 May 2009 [19] 16 January 2007 26 May 2009 [60] 10 July 2007 1 September 2009 [61] 12 January 1999 15 February 2010 [62] 18 March 2008 22 March 2010 [63] 28 November 2006 19 May 2010 [64] 15 January 2008 12 October 2010 [65] 15 February 2005 25 January 2011 [66] 9 June 2009 12 April 2011 [67] 24 May 2010 25 October 2011 [68] 17 February 2010 1 May 2012 [69] 15 February 2011 10 July 2012 [70] 7 June 2011 23 October 2012 [71] 8 November 2011 8 January 2013 [72] 5 March 2012 16 April 2013 [73] 5 June 2001 19 November 2013 [74] 22 January 2013 17 December 2013 [75] 30 July 2013 7 January 2014 [76] 15 January 2002 18 March 2014 [77] 3 December 2013 4 November 2014 [78] 29 September 2009 14 April 2015 [79] 14 May 2013 14 April 2015 [80] 15 May 2012 23 June 2015 [81] 14 January 2014 29 March 2016 [82] 22 April 2014 12 April 2016 [83] 7 June 2011 7 June 2016 [84] 4 January 2011 7 June 2016 [20] 16 June 2015 23 June 2016 [85] 6 June 2017 21 November 2017 [86] 9 May 2017 28 November 2017 [87] 29 November 2016 28 November 2017 [88] 30 June 2015 19 December 2017 [89] 2 April 2013 25 September 2018 [90] 5 December 2017 20 November 2018 [21] 12 December 2017 27 November 2018 [91] 13 August 2002 15 January 2019 [22] 7 June 2005 15 January 2019 [92] 1 June 2004 5 March 2019 [93] 17 February 2010 26 March 2019 [94] 30 January 2007 3 September 2019 [23] 2 July 2002 22 October 2019 [95] 16 May 2017 17 December 2019 [96] 20 February 2018 14 April 2020 [97] 28 January 2014 21 July 2020 [98] 10 November 2020 9 March 2021 [99] 15 February 2011 4 May 2021 [100] 23 April 2019 22 June 2021 [24] 29 January 2019 14 September 2021 [101] 4 August 2016 14 September 2021 [102] 27 April 2021 28 September 2021 [103] 24 November 2020 16 November 2021 [104] 10 September 2013 14 December 2021 [105] 9 June 2009 14 December 2021 [106] 20 November 2007 28 February 2022 [107] 26 November 2013 8 March 2022 [108] 6 May 2014 15 March 2022 [109] 2 January 2013 15 March 2022 [110] 25 April 2010 15 March 2022 [25] 15 October 2019 29 March 2022 [27] 22 May 2012 29 March 2022 [111] 8 November 2005 29 March 2022 [112] 22 November 2005 29 March 2022 [113] 3 January 2006 29 March 2022 [114] 9 October 2001 29 March 2022 [115] 1 May 2012 29 March 2022 [116] 2 February 2016 29 March 2022 [117] 12 October 2021 29 March 2022 [118] 19 October 2010 29 March 2022 [26] 10 November 2020 29 March 2022 [119] 23 April 2013 29 March 2022 [120] 31 March 2020 29 March 2022 [121] 27 July 2021 29 March 2022 [122] 10 February 2021 29 March 2022 [123] 16 March 2004 29 March 2022 [124] 12 December 2017 29 March 2022 [125] 5 January 2010 29 March 2022 [126] 10 November 2020 29 March 2022 [127] 8 January 2019 29 March 2022 [128] 12 August 2014 29 March 2022 [129] 27 July 2021 29 March 2022 [130]\n\nRecurring characters\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nHaasler, Sue (2018).
