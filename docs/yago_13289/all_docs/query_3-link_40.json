        "text": "“Our approach is very theatrical. All four of the guys have theater backgrounds. That’s how we treat it. There just happens to be four cameras between us and the audience.” – Johnny Galecki, “The Big Bang Theory”\n\n“In the first few years of ’24,’ I amassed a level of confidence that I never had as an actor before because of the amount of work I was doing. That confidence tied over into trying different things. Most people who have taken on (that workload) embrace it. And, on a personal note, I generally do better if I know where I have to be every day.” – Kiefer Sutherland, “Touch”\n\n“The biggest misconception is they think we’re all having a good time down there and people forget how hard we work. People say, ‘Isn’t acting just something you do?’ I don’t know, do lawyers just walk into court and start arguing cases? Until I started making money, family and friends never took me seriously. They would say, ‘You’ll find something to do. Have you thought about real estate?’ ” – Joel McHale, “Community”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I’ve come to really enjoy the fact that I don’t know what the end of the season is going to be like. In life, we don’t know that.” – Tom Selleck, “Blue Bloods”\n\n“We have all these great writers, and I trust them, but it’s fun to come up with physical things to help out to sort of fill what they’ve written. I really get a charge out of that, when you change a shot. I feel that there’s room for that in a single-camera world.” – Garret Dillahunt, “Raising Hope”\n\n“Obviously, every show has to kind of find their own voice and can’t stay with one character the whole time. The writers were great, finding each of the characters. I think we found me pretty early, and I think we made (him forgiving), and because of that, we kind of can go anywhere.” – Max Greenfield, “New Girl”\n\n“Armando Iannucci, who created it, his process is really just be free. Sometimes a lot of it is scripted, but a lot of the times we just kind of see who’s cast and we say, that would be funny if we said that.” – Tony Hale, “Veep”"
