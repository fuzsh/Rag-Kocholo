        "text": "Aerosmith fans were left cryin’ this week after the legendary band announced that touring was no longer a possibility due to frontman Steven Tyler’s unfortunate vocal injury.\n\nAnyone who has heard Tyler perform knows he uses every fiber of his being to sing, but the injury he suffered last year is one he will never fully recover from.\n\nBut why, exactly?\n\nThe vocal expert at Massachusetts General Hospital provided insight into why damage to the voice box can sometimes be permanent, and this expert is quite familiar with Steven Tyler's throat.\n\nWho Is Dr. Zeitels?\n\nDr. Steven M Zeitels is the head of the Voice Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and is widely considered one of the top throat surgeons in the world.\n\nAccording to Billboard, he has operated on stars like Sam Smith, Julie Andrews, Keith Urban, Adele, and the iconic Steven Tyler.\n\nIn 2006, Tyler blew a blood vessel in his throat and was treated by Dr. Zeitels. While he was able to recover from that incident, his troubles never ceased and his visits to Dr. Zeitels continued.\n\nAerosmith was forced to postpone several shows back in September when Tyler fractured his larynx, but with the help of Dr. Zeitels and the team at Massachusetts General Hospital, there was hope that Tyler would return to the stage for the farewell tour.\n\nThe band released a statement on Friday, sharing the unfortunate news about the band’s retirement. It turns out that Tyler’s vocal cord damage was more severe than previously expected.\n\n\"(Tyler) has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where it was before his injury,\" said the band online. \"We’ve seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear, that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Celine Dion Has Heartbreaking Connection to Massachusetts\n\nSteven Tyler Still Recovering from Fracture Larynx\n\nThe larynx, aka the voice box, is essential for breathing and producing vocal sounds.\n\nDr. Zeitels spoke with ABC News and explained why damage to the voice box can be permanent.\n\n“The voice box is comprised of both cartilage and bone,” he said. “So when a fracture occurs in the voice box, the actual positioning of the structures that have to move can be altered and not function as efficiently.”\n\nMichael Rock was one of the few fortunate fans to see Tyler’s very last show in Boston. It’s sad to think we will never hear Tyler belt out “Dream On” again, but it was a blessing to Rock N' Roll to hear it while we could.\n\nAs the icon continues treatment with Dr. Zeitels, fans around the world send well wishes to the singer."
