        "text": "For Ron Samul ’91, the essence of Mitchell has remained strong since he was a student earning his associate degree in general studies.\n\n“The small classes, invested and purposeful faculty, and learning and social support remain the same, but what has changed is the vision and commitment to the students, putting them on pathways to success. It continues to impress me how connected the students are to their experience and their learning.”\n\nSamul sees this first-hand in his work as assistant director of Thames at Mitchell College, a pre-college transition program that focuses on student college readiness. The program works with neurodiverse learners – representing complex learning pathways – who are college-able but not yet college-ready.\n\nHis own pathway to success led Samul from Mitchell to Eastern Connecticut State University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in English, followed by a Master of Fine Arts in creative and professional writing from Western Connecticut State University. He is currently working on completing a doctorate in educational leadership.\n\nAs a student at Mitchell, Samul found inspiration to write from Dr. Joe Medeiros, a professor in the English/Language/Fine Arts department.\n\n“Dr. Medeiros turned me toward literature. He said my writing wasn’t very good, but my ideas were excellent. It inspired me to work harder.”\n\nSamul was also taught by professors Marc Goldsmith, Don Helms, Catherine Wright, Wilma Hasse and Jennifer O’Donnell.\n\nOne of Samul’s favorite memories is of working on the “Thamesana,” the college newspaper, under the direction of Ted Hargrove, the public relations and development director at the time.\n\n“I developed a good work ethic and a sense of responsibility under his watchful eye,” Ron said.\n\nThe New London native is author of the 2019 novel “The Staff,” about a village with a strange and sordid past, and is a certified technical scuba diver who worked for an operation that took divers to shipwrecks and historical sites off the New England coast.\n\nSamul said he has always appreciated the culture and vision of Mitchell. After earning his bachelor’s degree and working various jobs, he returned to Mitchell in 2004 to work as a writing tutor. In 2008, after earning his MFA, he joined Thames at Mitchell College as a writing instructor and advisor, before moving to his current position.\n\n“Over the last 14 years, I’ve never worked the same day twice. The students always make my work so exciting, fun and rewarding. It is their success that makes all the hard work valuable.”\n\nPictured above (l-r): Michael “Mike” Buscetto III, Michael Buscetto, Jr., and Michael “Mikey” Buscetto IV\n\nIn 1960 Michael Buscetto, Jr., proudly posed for a photograph with the Mitchell College Men’s Soccer team. But he wasn’t a player on the team.\n\n“I was the mascot,” he said with a laugh. “They didn’t know my last name and listed me as ‘Mike Michaels’ in the caption in the Thamesana [Mitchell’s school newspaper]. They didn’t know who I was! I was a 12-year-old kid running around the campus. It was my backyard, and Mitchell College was a welcoming group. It always took care of the kids in the neighborhood.”\n\nBuscetto, whose father, Michael Buscetto, Sr., owned the much-loved Michael’s Dairy, grew up in a house across from the dairy.\n\n“My father worked as the dairy manager in the 1930s, when it was known as Mumford Dairy. The Mitchell family owned two dairies — Mumford, here in New London, and Mitchell Dairy in Salem. In 1936, they were going to close up Mumford Dairy and only operate from the Salem farm on Route 82. My father took over then and rented Mumford Dairy, changing its name to Michael’s Dairy. In 1943, he bought the property for $11,000. It was in our family for 70 years.” (Michael’s Dairy was purchased by Mitchell College from the Buscetto family in 2006.)\n\nAt first, the dairy only produced milk and cream, but then the eldest Buscetto filled a demand in the community.\n\n“In the 1940s, my father started to make ice cream with one little machine. Everybody kept wanting it, and he couldn’t keep up with it. He added the ice cream plant in 1949 and opened the store in 1950.”\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nMichael Jr. took over the operation in 1983, and his son Michael “Mike” Buscetto III pitched in from an early age (along with other son Bill).\n\n“This was my first job at 7 years old,” Mike said. “We didn’t have a lot of options!”\n\nMichael, Jr., added that grandson Mikey, now a senior at Mitchell College, was just 4 years old when he started working.\n\n“I put in a new lawn in the front with sprinklers set up to keep the lawn damp,” he said. “I had to turn on the valves on the sprinklers for 15 minutes at a time. Mikey helped me turn the valves but after 15 minutes, he said he was thirsty and went in and got a milkshake. After working the next 15 minutes turning valves, he said ‘Gotta go home now!’ because he got his milkshake.”\n\n“We showed no mercy here,” he said jokingly. “If you can walk, you can work!”\n\nMike said, “So many people who I see in the community tell me that working at Michael’s was their first job. They say, ‘Your family taught us so much about work ethic, showing up on time and being clean.’ Little stuff that made a big impact on them.’”\n\nThe celebrated sock hops – started by Michael, Jr., who invited DJ Billy Wronowski to play music and lead games throughout the summers – also made a big impact in the community.\n\n“Michael’s was a safe place from the daily grind. People could come here and relax. They didn’t necessarily buy anything either. At the sock hops, you would bring your lawn chair and see a bunch of people from the community. It was the social heartbeat of New London. You can’t replicate a Michael’s Dairy. You just can’t.” —Mike Buscetto\n\nEarlier this year, Martha Schultz joined the Office of Advancement and Alumni Affairs as the director of marketing for Mitchell College, responsible for external marketing and communications across all platforms working closely with all of Mitchell’s offices and departments. In this role she manages the college’s brand, oversees the college’s digital platforms and website, and is instrumental in telling the Mitchell story.\n\nSchultz most recently was an art director at an integrated marketing agency, and she previously held positions as creative operations director for a heritage management agency, creative director for an event management company and brand manager for an international law firm. Her experience includes serving as a creative services project manager at George Mason University, where she worked closely with the president, advancement and academic units during a pivotal time when the university was repositioning itself as a leading research, science and information technology institution. Schultz holds a B.A. in English literature from Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C., and did graduate professional studies in editing and publishing at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\n\nNancy Cowser, chief advancement and alumni affairs officer, says “Martha’s combination of creative talent, experience in higher education and broad technical skillset is a great fit for Mitchell College as we are extending our reach to tell the compelling story of Mitchell. Her marketing expertise will be critical in helping revitalize our brand and leverage it in new and more effective ways. Martha has been instrumental in building partnerships across campus and rebuilding our internal capabilities to prepare us for future growth.”\n\n“Coming to Mitchell at a time of ‘rebirth’ and change is very energizing, and I see tremendous potential for all the ways we will be expressing what is unique and special about Mitchell College. Coming from a very competitive market in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area, I have a true appreciation of what a gem Mitchell is and how we can leverage what makes us special in a competitive landscape. As higher ed is being challenged to evolve to adapt to new social and economic realities, I’m excited to face those challenges.” — Martha Schultz"
