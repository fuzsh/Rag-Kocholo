In 1986, he purchased this company, becoming the owner and operator until his retirement in 2021.\n\nAt a go cart track in Waco, Texas, Billy met the love of his life, Karon Shinualt. The two became one in 1960, the year they met. Billyâ€™s family was the most important part of his life, and the grandchildren the light of his life. He enjoyed deer hunting, and some game hunting. Billy was a sports enthusiast, he loved high school baseball, the Baylor Bears, football, and being outdoors.\n\nLeft to carry on his legacy are his beloved wife of 62 plus years, Karon; daughter, Tracy Lee Lindemann and husband Chris; son, Billy Jackson, Jr. and wife Kim; grandchildren, Justin Blanton and wife Kaci, Tierne Reverman and husband Bill, BJ Blanton and wife Katrina, Blayne Jackson, Kaley Jackson; great grandchildren, Wyatt, Raylee, Gage, Warren, Lillian, Owen, and two to go.\n\nVIEW ORIGINAL; https://www.gracegardensfh.com/obituary/Billy-Jackson"
