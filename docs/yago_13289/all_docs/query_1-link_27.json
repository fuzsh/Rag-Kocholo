He attended elementary school at Pleasant Home School, District #5, a rural school in Dawes County near their home. He graduated in 1950 from Hay Springs High School.\n\nBillie was united in marriage to Juanita Schumacher on August 25, 1951. To this marriage four children were born: Joan, Thomas “Tom”, Kim and James “Jim”. He loved his family and spent as much time with them as his work allowed.\n\nHe farmed and ranched with his father before moving to the farm west of Hay Springs in Antelope Valley, where Billie and Juanita lived, until recently, when they moved to Chadron. Farming and ranching was a never ending job but one he loved. It was a family affair as everyone worked together, especially during the time they ran the dairy. Later in “retirement” Billie enjoyed spending time fishing and camping with his beloved wife, Nita.\n\nBillie was preceded in death by his parents; daughter-in-law, Leanna (Keim) Jackson; sister, Donna Westlake, and brother-in-law, Harold “Swede” Westlake.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Juanita of Chadron; children: Joan (Michael) Raymer of Hay Springs, Tom (Kerry) Jackson of Wheatland, WY, Kim (Bill) Wilson of Benkelman, NE, and Jim Jackson of Chadron; 16 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren; and 3 great great grandchildren.\n\nA memorial has been established for Prairie Pines or Chadron Home Health and Hospice. Donations can be sent to Chamberlain Chapel. PO Box 970, Chadron, NE 69337.\n\nOnline condolences may be left at www.chamberlainchapel.com\n\nChamberlain Chapel of Chadron, Nebraska is in charge of arrangements."
