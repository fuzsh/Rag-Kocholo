        "meta_description": "Billie Harper Jackson  April 1, 1931 - October 23, 2017  \tBillie Addylee Harper was born in Monroe, Louisiana, on April 1, 1931, and was the youngest of the Harper family.  Her parents were W.M. Harper, Judge of Monroe City Court, and Vyvian Wallace Harper, a teacher of drama and expression.  Billie loved and revered her mother and father as well as her two older sisters, Vyvian and Joy.  In Monroe, the three Harper girls were well known, adored and happy.  They enjoyed exploring the bayou and the levee behind their home, horseback riding on “Buddy”, swimming at a friend’s pool, going to the picture shows and other childhood adventures.  Billie recounted that their mother would often use the unique horn of their family Plymouth to signal “time to come home”.  Billie attended Georgia Tucker elementary school, then Neville High School, where she was a member of the cheering squad, graduating from Neville in 1948.  She attended Sophie Newcomb Memorial College at Tulane University, in New Orleans, Louisiana, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree and graduating in 1952.  In college, she was elected to student government, was selected to the honor society, and was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.  She had many friends, some of whom remained in contact with Billie up to her final hours.   \tOn February 10, 1953, Billie married William B. Jackson, Jr., also from Monroe.  After a short honeymoon, they moved to Maracaibo, Venezuela, where Bill was in the early stage of his long career in the oil industry.  They began to build a family together.  Subsequent moves took their growing family to Port of Spain, Trinidad (West Indies); Casper, Wyoming; and Englewood, Colorado.  Along the way, Billie and Bill had two sons, Dan and Doug; then two daughters, Polly and Alice.  Together, the family shared many adventures.  Bill went with God in 2013, but Billie’s children were with her during her final hours. \tBillie Harper Jackson graduated from Sophie Newcomb College (Tulane), was a first grade teacher and later a homemaker \tBillie was a giver.  Therefore, it came naturally and happily for her life’s work to be building and raising her family.  She was devoted to her four children and to her husband.  She had boundless love for them and was proud of each of them.  Her children were her joy.  Their happiness was her goal.  It was their happiness that made Billie happy.  Later on, being with her grandchildren multiplied her joy.  .  Billie was involved in many charities including Girl Scouts, Denver Lyric Opera Guild, Lamont School of Music, Sewell Child Development ( past President), Bethesda, Kappa Alpha Theta (Denver Alumnae Past President), and the Denver Zoo to name a few.  \tAlong Billie’s journey, she naturally acquired her sweet southern charm and her southern drawl. When you met her, you noticed that.  Billie’s charm and drawl were as much a part of her as were her blue eyes and smile.  She also acquired the skill of cooking perfect dishes of black eyed peas, red beans and rice, cornbread, southern fried chicken, and gumbo.  Those dishes were staples for the Jacksons, who were additionally blessed every Christmas by Billie’s chocolate fudge.  Also along her journey, Billie formed her core belief, which was a belief in the truth of God’s Word and in the salvation offered by Jesus.  She knew she was saved by Grace.  This must be what allowed her to be that sweet loving person, despite the effects of Alzheimer’s disease, up to the very end.  Billie’s wonderful caretakers at her final home described her as “So sweet and loving”.  Somehow she found ways to continue to show her light and her love to the end, October 23, 2017.  \tIn Heaven now, healthy and in loving peace, Billie is smiling again, happy.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t  \tBillie is survived by her children: Dan (Dawn) Jackson, Doug (Mary) Jackson, Polly Jackson, and Alice (Jonathan) Bush; and eight grandchildren: Grant, Shea, Anna, Emily, Liam, Bridger, Addie and Colette; and one great grandchild: Jackson.   \t \tIn lieu of flowers, Billie requested that donations be made to charity.   \t \tA memorial service will be held at 11:00 a.m. Friday, November 10, 2017 at Cherry Creek Presbyterian Church, 10150 E. Belleview Ave., Englewood.",
