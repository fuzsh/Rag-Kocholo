        "text": "Tonight, the final ever episode of Holby City aired after 23 years. It offered hope, it (once again) highlighted why we love the NHS and how our health service is so much more than ‘numbers down the side of a bus’.\n\nIt was perfect.\n\nIt’s a strange feeling writing this article. My first ever piece for Metro.co.uk was about Holby City – but it was also my first I had written for a national outlet – ever. Holby City helped me start my writing career; I genuinely don’t know where I’d be without it.\n\nSo, to say goodbye, to pay tribute to this wonderful show, here is my love letter to Holby City.\n\nHolby City has given us mad, incredible and powerful storylines over the years. From births to serial killers, many, many avenues have been explored.\n\nThe format of the show has practically stayed the same since the first episode in 1999, staying true to Tony McHale & Mal Young’s aim of exploring what happens to patients after being in the emergency department.\n\nLooking at patient’s lives on Darwin, Keller and AAU, as well as complex narratives for main characters, created Holby City’s recipe for success.\n\nThe show’s familiarity provided comfort for the audience; our weekly trip to Holby City Hospital has always been the perfect form of escapism, even more so in the last few years.\n\nHolby City’s audience certainly rallied together in the wake of the cancellation news. Within the hour, a petition had been launched, the #SaveHolbyCity hashtag picked up thousands of tweets, fans featured on local radio stations, it was all systems go and my god, we did our best.\n\nYou see, that’s the thing about soaps and continuing dramas – they make an impact – they can and have changed people’s lives.\n\nTake Dominic Copeland for example. David Ames recently told us how because of his character, people have come out to their friends and family, and some have bravely found help after watching Dom and Isaac’s abusive storyline.\n\nOf course, one of the main reasons why Holby City has had a consistent audience for so long is the diverse characters.\n\nThere’s Fletch, a single dad.\n\nJosh, a young Black doctor with bulimia.\n\nMadge, a nurse – who doesn’t earn enough – desperately trying to scrape together the funds for her autistic daughter’s social care.\n\nJeong, a young doctor who sometimes experiences loneliness as most of his family live in another country.\n\nWatching Holby City and falling in love with a character because they’ve experienced similar situations to you, they look like you or they simply are your source of happiness – that’s special.\n\nHolby City has always shown us strong female characters as well.\n\nJust in the last few years alone we’ve seen the likes of Max – a Black woman running the hospital, Billie – the adoptive daughter of two gay men, Kylie – a young nurse who called out a man when he sexually harassed her. The women of Holby City Hospital are never afraid to speak out and stand up, and for a young girl watching them absolutely boss it – it’s inspiring.\n\nAway from subjects like racism and mental health, Holby City has always put one thing in the spotlight: the NHS.\n\nThe show has dedicated medical professionals on hand to ensure cast are performing operations correctly, they are told how to pronounce complicated medical terms to help their portrayals of doctors and nurses who are the best in the business.\n\nEven down to the prosthetics. The Holby City art department produces realistic looking arms, legs, beating hearts – absolutely everything is done to the highest of standards to ensure the audience sit down on a Tuesday night and believe they are watching an accurate representation of a working NHS hospital.\n\nWith some restrictions, of course, it is a drama – not a documentary.\n\nIn the last few years, things have really been taken up a level.\n\nThe coronavirus episode was a huge success. Holby City could’ve easily returned to screens after briefly going off air and pretended that characters lived in a world where coronavirus didn’t exist. But with exhausted members of the NHS firmly in their minds, Holby City knew they had a job to do – and they nailed it.\n\nWithin the last few months, Holby City shone a light on nurses considering a job in private healthcare because it’s better money and shorter hours, patients getting bumped for operations again and again, the impact coronavirus has had on the hospital two years on from the first lockdown.\n\nThe show has been more timely than ever before – and yet here I am, writing my final ever article for the drama because it seems as if the BBC doesn’t think Holby City falls under their aim of making shows that ‘reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country’.\n\nJoe Ainsworth’s final words in tonight’s episode perfectly summed up why Holby City has become such a well-loved show. The axing will leave a huge hole in people’s lives; simply wondering how to spend their Tuesday evening will be a challenge as for so long it’s been: dinner, sit down, Holby City.\n\nStarting this article was difficult for me, but ending it was even harder. ‘How do I finish this?’, I asked myself many times while preparing this piece.\n\nAnd then I turned to the Holby City characters.\n\nI’ll leave you with this, from the wonder that is Nurse Donna Jackson.\n\n‘Sometimes when you don’t give up hope, good things can happen’.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, if we don’t give up hope, Holby City will return.\n\nMORE : Holby City stars Bob Barrett and Guy Henry reveal how they reacted to cancellation news ‘It’s like grief’\n\nMORE : Holby City star Davood Ghadami teases show finale ‘It left me emotionally exhausted!’"
