        "text": "Carol's tireless attempts to keep Billie on the straight-and-narrow proved self-defeating. Her constant nagging, and criticism broke his confidence, encouraging him to seek self-affirmation elsewhere. It was Carol's worst nightmare when he found it in a gang - his crew from Balham.\n\nCarol dragged him to Walford in the wake of Bradley's death, but his gang soon found him and he became tangled up in the non-fatal shooting of Jack Branning.\n\nThis was a turning point for Billie, who tried to go on the straight and narrow. He joined the army and ended his relationship with Whitney, who Carol had never approved of.\n\nHowever, Billie tragically died of alcohol poisoning at his 22nd birthday party. Bianca found him next morning lying on the sofa. Carol has never gotten over his death."
