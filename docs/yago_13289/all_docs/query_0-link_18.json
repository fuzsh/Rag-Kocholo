        "text": "Kevin E. McHale\n\nAt 6-foot-10 and 225 pounds, Kevin McHale's nearly unstoppable array of low post moves - some of which he never did twice in the same game - revolutionized pivot play. He owned the low block on offense but when he was forced out beyond the paint McHale shot a soft fall-away jumper, launching the ball from way behind his head making the shot almost impossible to block. With the Boston Celtics, he teamed with Hall of Famers Larry Bird and Robert Parish to form \"The Big Three,\" one of the greatest frontlines in basketball history. Although known for his happy-go-lucky attitude off the court, at game time his play was precise and devastating. Celebrated for his high-percentage shooting, McHale was the first player in NBA history to shoot 60 percent from the field and 80 percent from the foul line in the same season. Defensively, McHale's long arms made him impassable and earned him All-Defensive First Team honors three times.\n\nAbout The Hall\n\nLocated in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame is an independent non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to promoting, preserving and celebrating the game of basketball at every level. The Hall of Fame has more than 450 inductees and 40,000 sq. ft. of basketball history. Nearly 200,000 people visit the Hall of Fame Museum each year to learn about the game, experience the interactive exhibits and test their skills on the Jerry Colangelo \"Court of Dreams.\" Best known for its annual marquee Enshrinement Ceremony honoring the gameâ€™s elite, the Hall of Fame also operates over 70 high school and collegiate competitions annually throughout the country and abroad.\n\nNaismith Basketball Hall of Fame\n\n1000 Hall of Fame Avenue\n\nSpringfield, Massachusetts 01105\n\n1-877-4HOOPLA\n\nThe Basketball Hall of Fame makes no representation concerning, and is not responsible for the quality, content, accessibility, nature or reliability of any hyperlinked site.
