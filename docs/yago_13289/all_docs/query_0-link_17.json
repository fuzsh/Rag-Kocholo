        "text": "COUNTDOWN TO THE BIG GAME: THE TAYLOR SWIFT EFFECT ON TODAY \"General #consumer #interest in the ‚Äú#football,‚Äù and ‚Äú#superbowl commercials‚Äù in 2024 has soared for both men and women in comparison to 2023. We believe the #strong #female #interest that has given the NFL a new audience throughout the season is partially responsible for this. According to Zeta data, Super Bowl commercials are over 5x more of interest to the general population in 2024 than they were in 2023.\" - Vicky Nguyen, NBC News/TODAY The ZMP (Zeta Global Marketing Platform) says #2024 will be the year of redefining advertising to female audiences as #NFL Pro Football continues to grow their female #audiences. Zeta has seen a significant an unrivaled increase in female viewership for the NFL in 2024 that rivals the number of men that are watching the sport. #mustsee #tv only on #NBC - #taylorswift #television\n\nI think every sports fan can agree that the amount services and apps needed to watch one sport has reach an extreme point of absurdity. On top of that, you can't even pay to watch all of the games for the teams you are a fan of with those services. Let the fans pick and pay for the games they want to actually watch for the teams they actual like all from ONE app instead of having us play this game of \"find the needle in the haystack of services\" each year. #FreeCast #NextGenStreaming #StreamingWars #NBA #NFL #NHL #MLB #MLS #NoMoreAppDiving\n\nDo Swifties have staying power in the NFL's audience ? I asked Consumr.ai (powered by ProfitWheel) to run overlap analyses and find out. The audience overlap for Taylor Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs was 37%, DOUBLE the overlap of Taylor and the National Football League (NFL) 18%. Additionally, There was a female gender skew for the Swiftie/Chiefs connection at 58%, vs. 50% for Swift fans and the NFL as a whole. We will be watching closely to see if other NFL franchises experience a halo effect in their audience base or if the increase will continue to concentrate in Chiefs fandom. Side Note: R&B music interests were up 18% WoW, which I can only imagine stems from Usher breaking out both his roller skates and abs at Halftime. #taylorswift #superbowlads #superbowl https://lnkd.in/gbMxdc4x\n\n‚öΩÔ∏è Exciting news for women's football! üì∫ The NWSL (National Women's Soccer League) just scored big with 4-year TV deals, partnering with ESPN, CBS, Prime Video, and Scripps Sports. With a commitment to show at least 20 games each, fans can enjoy expanded coverage and improved video replay. üí∞The $60 million yearly deal is a significant win for the league, not being, at the same time, dependent on a long-term contract provides room to negotiate higher figures in the near future, following the growth of the product. Challenges in viewer habits will be addressed with strategic marketing efforts. üåç This could be another step towards the affirmation of women's football, with the American League potentially gaining greater international visibility. We will see which leagues will follow the example.

Obviously, it creates a #buzz. It creates another group of #young #fans, particularly young #women.‚Äù Of course, women's interest in the #NFL and the #SuperBowl has been more of a multi-decade #evolution rather than a Taylor Swift revolution. Still, Swift may be driving more women to watch. ‚ÄúFor the first time in history, you‚Äôre at almost 50% female viewership,‚Äù David A Steinberg, said. He says the growth in #female #viewership can be traced back to a rise in must-see advertising through the #NFL's greater emphasis on halftime shows. FACT: National Football League (NFL) games made up 93 of the top 100 most-viewed US TV programs in 2023 according to Nielsen, an increase from last year's total of 82. The league was responsible for 24 of the top 25 most-watched broadcasts, with seven of the top ten being playoff games. Its a new #era for #mustsee #tv #poweredbyTS #TheSwifteffect https://lnkd.in/efnfy8fY\n\nüèÄ üì∫ We've got ourselves a showdown in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and it's not the playoffs. After not reaching a deal during its exclusive negotiating period, Warner Bros. Discovery - parent company of Turner (Turner Broadcasting System, Inc) - is in danger of losing the NBA media rights it's held for nearly 40 years to NBCUniversal, as NBC has come in with a significant offer of $2.5 billion, nearly 120% over the current agreement. The agreement puts WBD in a Catch-22. Keeping the rights would surely mean overpaying (reports are saying they'd need to come in at $2.8 billion to have a shot), and the company is already in challenging financial times. But, if it loses the rights, it drastically weakens its cable business due to being unable to maintain its carriage rights, which are among the highest out there ($3/subscriber) and generates $2.56 billion annually for the company. Decisions, decisions. In this week‚Äôs SBP, you‚Äôll learn (with the assistance of some memes): - How the NBA is carving up its new media rights package - The ‚Äútale of the tape‚Äù between WBD and NBC - The outcomes of either scenario (and NBC's ultimate angle) - What I think the NBA will do - The ramifications this broader deal will have on the industry as a whole Check it out below! üëá https://lnkd.in/gtizrPdY\n\nFootball is king, but will another sport sit atop American fandom one day? It's hard to imagine, but we should always take note of history. ‚öæ Baseball reigned the 1930's-1960's. My belief is because of the radio. It was appointment entertainment almost every night of the week with not much alternative entertainment, which created the celebrities of this era. üèà Then came TV, which correlates to the rise of football. In 1950 only 9% of American households had a TV, by 1960 it was 65%. You can see football's popularity jumped as TVs became commonplace in homes. . . . There are significant challenges to knocking off football: 1) Fragmented consumer attention is harder to capture than it was in previous years 2) Sports are run as true businesses now 3) Football has massive audiences in the NFL and college But it is important to keep history in mind. When the world changes it's due to technology and events in time no one could ever predict in the moment. Life just happens, and then a new reality takes form without us really understanding the impact until we look back in the rearview mirror. Ddo you think another sport will ever pass football? If so, share which one you think below. üëá #linkedinsports #sportsmedia #sportsbiz\n\nNew Post: MLS All-Star Game 2024: Livestream the MLS vs. Liga MX Match Online - https://lnkd.in/gsicXDRw - All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors.

Discovery and NBC, but negotiations are not far enough along yet for the league to start conversations around WBD‚Äôs all-important matching rights. NBC and the NBA would have to be close to a signed deal for negotiations over those matching rights to truly commence. * Comcast and Diamond have barely spoken in the nine days since the cable operator dropped all of the Bally Sports Networks from its Xfinity cable systems. Both sides are entrenched in their positions, and it doesn't look like any deal is close. * CBS Sports‚Äôs deal with the Italian soccer league Serie A expires in a couple of weeks and the two sides are not close on a renewal. The Italian soccer league will either have to accept a much lower rights fee from CBS or find a new partner in the U.S. market. * Former Turner Sports president Lenny Daniels was considered one of the early favorites to replace Norby Williamson, but now has become a much longer shop as ESPN is not moving off its desire that the role will be based in Bristol, Conn. * Streaming, Paramount, women's sports, Spulu and sports betting were the top topics on the minds of NFL lawyers who gathered in Washington, D.C. this week. I spoke to the group on Wednesday morning about the changing media landscape, and these were the focus of most of the questions I fielded. * It looks like Netflix will wind up carrying the two NFL games scheduled for December 25, per a bevy of sources. It‚Äôs a first-of-its-kind deal, and almost certainly not the last. https://lnkd.in/eQN-tqcj"
