[Source: Britannica] 1954: The FORTRAN programming language üíª is invented at IBM. FORTRAN is the first widely used high-level programming language, and it is still used today in scientific and engineering applications. [Source: Computer History Museum] 1983: The RSA encryption algorithm üîê is patented. RSA is one of the most widely used encryption algorithms in the world, and it is used to protect data in transit and at rest. [Source: Britannica] 1998: The first e-mail ‚úâÔ∏è from China is sent to its connection in Germany. This event marked the beginning of China's integration into the global internet. [Source: Facts.net] 2012: The discovery of the Higgs boson üî¨, often referred to as the \"God particle,\" is announced by scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle that is thought to play a role in giving other particles their mass.
