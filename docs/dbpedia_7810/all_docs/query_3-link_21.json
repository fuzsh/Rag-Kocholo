        "text": "Greetings,\n\nThis is a slightly longer post but it's coming from someone who's humbly and sincerely passionate+motivated about pursuing Physics and hence I'd be immensely grateful to everyone who can help me clear my confusions and see a ray of light and hope! You'd be doing me a solid :)\n\nMy request: Given the context below, I need guidance regarding following three confusions:\n\n(i) How can I best develop a strong competency in undergraduate Physics and build my profile for admission in a Physics Master's/PhD?\n\n(ii) How can I then be able to prove to graduate school admission committees (Master's/PhD) my competency in undergraduate Physics and my ability to do well in grad school and to conduct meaningful research in an area of my choice in Physics?\n\n(iii) Should I first do a Master's in Physics after quickly finishing my CSE degree (i.e., only do coursework in my CSE degree) and then later do a PhD; or should I take longer to finish my CSE degree (i.e., take time to learn enough Physics to determine my exact area of interest in Physics + do Physics-related research, projects, and publish papers, do relevant extracurriculars) to build my profile and directly go for a PhD in Physics skipping a Master's?\n\nContext: I'm from Pakistan and I've studied Civil Engineering from Pakistan's best engineering school, earned my Bachelor's degree with a 3.86 CGPA. Though I excelled in the Civil Engineering degree, my real academic passions since high school have been Physics, Mathematics, Computers, Space exploration, Cosmology and Astronomy. I was especially talented in high school Physics and Maths, where I thoroughly understood both the problem-solving and theoretical aspects and had a very strong abstract understanding of all the concepts.\n\nDespite my interest in Physics, I ended up in Civil Engineering due to some circumstances which I won't mention here because it's a long story. I excelled in the degree and throughout the four years, I was often the go-to person for my peers when they needed any academic help. Despite being in an engineering program, I was never satisfied with only learning problem solving, analysis, and design. I could only take a sigh of relief until after I had understood the theory too and the \"why\" and \"how\" behind every concept we learnt and how all the mathematical models and equations made an intuitive sense. After doing a leadership-development teaching Fellowhip for two years post-graduation, I decded to pivot back to my passion for Physics becuase I felt that if I wanted to become a Physicist then it was now or never for me to transition to it. However, with a Civil Engineering background, transitioning directly to a Physics Master's was challenging and it was impossible for me to get into a Physics Master's program with a non-Physics background. So instead, I chose to study Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) for my Master's. CSE blends Mathematics, Computer Science, and allows for a focus in an area like Physics which was ideal for me. I aimed and still do to use this Master's as a bridge into Physics.\n\nCurrently, I'm through one semester of my CSE Master's (at a minimum I have to spend two more and at the maximum I can spend seven more). Now, in the summer semester-break, I've been preparing for a future in Physics by self-studying core undergraduate Physics topics using Leonard Susskind's Theoretical Minimum courses. I've also started prepping for the Physics GRE. And after I've learnt the whole cannon of undergrad Physics, I'll decide on my exact area of focus in Physics.\n\nI've already revised basic Math courses such as Single-variable Calculus, Multivariable calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Advanced Partial Differential Equations.\n\nHere's my LinkedIn profile in case anyone needs to have a holistic look at my experiences and education to be able to give better advice.\n\nVanadium 50 said:\n\nThis will not be easy.\n\nThe physics education in Pakistan is poor.\n\nLots of people cometo PF with the plan to score well on the GRE. This is easier said than done. Abd this is only part of the application package.\n\nThere are many people in exactly the sane boat - applying to physics programs from countries with a degree in something else. Even if a university were to take a chance on one of these people, how do you ensure it will be you?\n\nI don't know what to tell you. Normally, I'd say emigrate now and enter a program there. However, many nations have had problems with immigrants from some pats of the world - inclusing Pakistan - so it's not as easy as it was.\n\nDo you need financial support?\n\nThank you for the reply!\n\nI totally agree with you that the transition will not be easy but I'm willing and ready to go through the required difficulty and hard work to be able to pursue what I love the most. And as the saying goes or so, when has anything worthwhile and meaningful ever been easy :) Plus, I have a strong STEM background so it'll not be too difficult for me to transition into Physics (hopefully).\n\nAnd I know the Physics education in Pakistan falls short compared to the rest of the world but every year many students from Pakistan get into some of the best schools in the world for natural sciences and engineering so it's not a lost cause. I personally know people who are currently at Oxford and Cambridge doing Physics.\n\nI'm planning to apply to places by next year's April/May (to programs which will be accepting applications then) so I have 8-9 months for the Physics GRE prep (which I'm planning to take in April). Do you agree that it is enough time for me to have a very strong prep for the test?\n\nI totally get where you're coming from, but to ensure I'll be selected, I'm obviously going to try to get stellar grades, give stellar General GRE and Physics GRE tests, do worthwhile research/projects in my current degree which can lead to publications, learn as much Math, Physics, and CSE skills as possible and as I'll need in the future - and then hopefully I'll have strong enough credentials for some universities to accept me.\n\nCan you explain a little more about why should I \"emigrate now and enter a program there\"?\n\nI'll definitely need financial support but if I don't find any for the life of me, I can support myself too.\n\nabdulhayee said:\n\nThank you for the reply!\n\nMy plan is to apply to colleges abroad, be it for Master's or for the PhD. I haven't yet shortlisted any countries/colleges/programs because I don't think I'm at that place yet to be able to know or decide for myself which exact country/college/program I would like to get into for my Physics studies. I feel like I still have to develop myself a lot to reach that place.\n\nBuilding my Physics knowledge or skills is not something that worries me. I think I can do that if spend the time, energy and effort. My only concern is that how will I be able to showcase/prove those skills/knowledge to potential Master's/PhD admission committees given I don't have a Bachelor's in Physics.\n\nI'd recommend that you come up with an initial shortlist. Because each school will determine what's acceptable demonstration of your proficiency in physics (e.g., placement exams). And it will likely matter whether you apply for a US school (e.g., application to a PhD program) or a non-US school (e.g., application to a master's program). So it's best to contact the graduate admissions office at several schools, and see what they specifically want.\n\nAnd what will likely help is doing a research project for a physicist, someone who can say, \"This guy's got what it takes to become a physicist.\"\n\nBut I agree with V50; it won't be easy.\n\nCrysPhys said:\n\nI'd recommend that you come up with an initial shortlist.

I'll definitely soon shortlist some schools and write to their graduate admission offices for guidance. It's sound advice and it came to my mind also to directly reach out to the universities instead of staying in a confusion limbo.\n\nAnd I'm definitely planning on doing research/projects in the coming academic year. Hoping I can find good research mentors/advisors and that the research/work with them will pave a path for me to get into Physics schools.\n\nWhen you say it won't be easy, do mean it will be nearly impossible / a lost cause OR it will be possible but I just have a very demanding road ahead of me?\n\nabdulhayee said:\n\nWhen you say it won't be easy, do mean it will be nearly impossible / a lost cause OR it will be possible but I just have a very demanding road ahead of me?\n\nIs the path you've envisioned to get from where you are today to where you want to be in the future likely to succeed? No, for the reasons that V50 elucidated above.\n\nIs there a path to get from where you are today to where you want to be in the future that is likely to succeed? Yes, but it will require more time and more money than you are probably envisioning at this moment. We've discussed this in other threads. You either need to complete a second bachelor's in physics (which could take less than 4 yrs if you get placement for various courses you've already taken). Or you need to enroll as a non-matriculating (non-degree) student to take the physics and math courses you need for applying to physics grad school. In the US, some colleges won't allow you to enroll for a second bachelor's, if you already have a first bachelor's; at those schools, only the second option is available (and not all schools might support this option either). Then there's the issue of how to pay for all this, and what visa regulations (constantly changing) permit (e.g., you might have to show that you have the necessary funds on hand).\n\nIf you go the route of further undergrad education (rather than directly into graduate education), look into opportunities at liberal arts colleges in the US. Some have solid undergrad physics programs, deep endowment funds, and strong outreach programs for foreign students. If you luck out, you might even find a scholarship targetted for Pakistani students majoring in science. You'd be surprised at the wide range of targetted scholarships. If you're female, take a close look at the opportunities at Wellesley, since it has a cross-enrollment program with MIT.\n\nAnd serendipity is not to be discounted. E.g., one or more of your professors in Pakistan might have relatives or friends who are physics professors in other countries. Personal connections can have great value in scenarios such as yours.\n\nThere are a bunch of posters here in a similar situation. Our advice has been fairly consistent - the first step is take the classes a typical physics major does by whatever path available to you. And this is usually objected to \"It tales too long!\" \"Someone else needs to pay for this\" \"I'll just get a 99th percentile on the PGRE and show those Stanvard Boys who's top dog!\"\n\nWe're not supposed to be discouraging, but in the adult world \"you can do anything you set your mind to\" is not always the case, \"You can do anything you set your mind to and your preferred path will take you there\" is event less true.\n\nWe can estimate his chances - ths US takes 2000 students per year. ley's say 10% are non-US, non-India, and non-China. That leaves 200, mostly from the EU and Canada. Apparently 5% are non physics majors (although I bet most of them have or nearly have completed a physics BS curriculum) so we're talking 10 available slots. Ten is not a very big target to shoot for. Given that Pakistan's physics education is among the very worst in the world.\n\nHe needs to get his butt out of Pakistan and into a classroom. The plan of out-GREing the Stanvard crowd is not realistic."
