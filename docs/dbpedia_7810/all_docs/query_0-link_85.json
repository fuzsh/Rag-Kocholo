        "text": "From Stanford University\n\nThe concept of a multiverse, created in a fiery bloom of matter and radiation, is a central part of the String Theory Landscape. (Image credit: Eric Nyquist)\n\nSeptember 12, 2018\n\nKer Than\n\nLate one summer night nearly 40 years ago, Andrei Linde was seized by a sudden conviction that he knew how the universe was born. His nocturnal eureka moment would lead to the concept of a multiverse, a central part of the String Theory Landscape. This story is part 3 of a five-part series.\n\nLate one summer night in 1981, while still a junior research fellow at Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow, Andrei Linde was struck by a revelation. Unable to contain his excitement, he shook awake his wife, Renata Kallosh, and whispered to her in their native Russian, “I think I know how the universe was born.”\n\nKallosh, a theoretical physicist herself, muttered some encouraging words and fell back asleep. “It wasn’t until the next morning that I realized the full impact of what Andrei had told me,” recalled Kallosh, now a professor of physics at the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics.\n\nLinde’s nocturnal eureka moment had to do with a problem in cosmology that he and other theorists, including Stephen Hawking, had struggled with for months.\n\nA year earlier, a 32-year-old postdoc at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory named Alan Guth shocked the physics community by proposing a bold modification to the Big Bang theory. According to Guth’s idea, which he called “inflation,” our universe erupted from a vacuum-like state and underwent a brief period of faster-than-light expansion.\n\nInflation\n\nAlan Guth, from Highland Park High School and M.I.T., who first proposed cosmic inflation\n\nAlan Guth’s notes:\n\nIn less than a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, space-time doubled more than 60 times from a subatomic speck to a volume many times larger than the observable universe.\n\nGuth envisioned the powerful repulsive force fueling the universe’s exponential growth as a field of energy flooding space. As the universe unfurled, this “inflaton field” decayed, and its shed energy was transfigured into a fiery bloom of matter and radiation. This pivot, from nothing to something and timelessness to time, marked the beginning of the Big Bang. It also prompted Guth to famously quip that the inflationary universe was the “ultimate free lunch.”\n\nAs theories go, inflation was a beauty. It explained in one fell swoop why the universe is so large, why it was born hot, and why its structure appears to be so flat and uniform over vast distances. There was just one problem – it didn’t work.\n\nTunneling\n\nTo conclude the unpacking of space-time, Guth borrowed a trick from quantum mechanics called “tunneling” to allow his inflaton field to randomly and instantly skip from a higher, less stable energy state to a lower one, thus bypassing a barrier that could not be scaled by classical physics.\n\nAndrei Linde and Renata Kallosh, both professors of physics. (Image credit: L.A. Cicero)\n\nBut closer inspection revealed that quantum tunneling caused the inflaton field to decay quickly and unevenly, resulting in a universe that was neither flat nor uniform. Aware of the fatal flaw in his theory, Guth wrote at the end of his paper on inflation: “I am publishing this paper in the hope that it will … encourage others to find some way to avoid the undesirable features of the inflationary scenario.”\n\nGuth’s plea was answered by Linde, who on that fateful summer night realized that inflation didn’t require quantum tunneling to work. Instead, the inflaton field could be modeled as a ball rolling down a hill of potential energy that had a very shallow, nearly flat slope. While the ball rolls lazily downhill, the universe is inflating, and as it nears the bottom, inflation slows further and eventually ends. This provided a “graceful exit” to the inflationary state that was lacking in Guth’s model and produced a cosmos like the one we observe. To distinguish it from Guth’s original model while still paying homage to it, Linde dubbed his model “new inflation.”\n\nQuantum birth of galaxies\n\nBy the time Linde and Kallosh moved to Stanford in 1990, experiments had begun to catch up with the theory. Space missions were finding temperature variations in the energetic afterglow of the Big Bang – called the cosmic microwave background radiation – that confirmed a startling prediction made by the latest inflationary models. These updated models went by various names – “chaotic inflation,” “eternal inflation,” “eternal chaotic inflation” and many more – but they all shared in common the graceful exit that Linde pioneered.\n\nAccording to these models, galaxies like the Milky Way grew from faint wrinkles in the fabric of space-time. The density of matter in these wrinkles was slightly greater compared to surrounding areas and this difference was magnified during inflation, allowing them to attract even more matter. From these dense primordial seeds grew the cosmic structures we see today. “Galaxies are children of random quantum fluctuations produced during the first 10-35 seconds after the birth of the universe,” Linde said.\n\nInflation predicted that these quantum fluctuations would leave imprints on the universe’s background radiation in the form of hotter and colder regions, and this is precisely what two experiments – dubbed COBE and WMAP – found. “After the COBE and WMAP experiments, inflation started to become part of the standard model of cosmology,” Shamit Kachru said.\n\nShamit Kachru, Professor of Physics and Director, Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics (Image credit: L.A. Cicero)\n\nThe multiverse\n\nLinde and others later realized that the same quantum fluctuations that produced galaxies can give rise to new inflating regions in the universe. Even though inflation ended in our local cosmic neighborhood 14 billion years ago, it can still continue at the outermost fringes of the universe. The consequence is an ever-expanding sea of inflating space-time dotted with “island universes” or “pocket universes” like our own where inflation has ceased.\n\n“As a result, the universe becomes a multiverse, an eternally growing fractal consisting of exponentially many exponentially large parts,” Linde wrote. “These parts are so large that for all practical purposes they look like separate universes.”\n\nLinde took the multiverse idea even further by proposing that each pocket universe could have differing properties, a conclusion that some string theorists were also reaching independently. “It’s not that the laws of physics are different in each universe, but their realizations,” Linde said. “An analogy is the relationship between liquid water and ice. They’re both H2O but realized differently.”\n\nLinde’s multiverse is like a cosmic funhouse filled with reality-distorting mirrors. Some pocket universes are resplendent with life, while others were stillborn because they were cursed with too few (or too many) dimensions, or with physics incompatible with the formation of stars and galaxies. An infinite number are exact replicas of ours, but infinitely more are only near-replicas. Right now, there could be countless versions of you inhabiting worlds with histories divergent from ours in ways large and small. In an infinitely expanding multiverse, anything that can happen will happen.\n\n“The inflationary universe is not just the ultimate free lunch, it’s the only lunch where all possible dishes are served,” Linde said.\n\nWhile disturbing to some, this eternal aspect of inflation was just what a small group of string theorists were looking for to help explain a surprise discovery that was upending the physics world – dark energy.\n\nDark Energy Survey\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nLeland and Jane Stanford founded the University to “promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on behalf of humanity and civilization.” Stanford opened its doors in 1891, and more than a century later, it remains dedicated to finding solutions to the great challenges of the day and to preparing our students for leadership in today’s complex world.

Since 1952, more than 54 Stanford faculty, staff, and alumni have won the Nobel Prize, including 19 current faculty members\n\nFrom Stanford University\n\nSeptember 11, 2018\n\nKer Than\n\nPhysicist Leonard Susskind realized in 1969 that the formula explaining what happens when particle pairs collide made more sense by imagining them as individual loops of string. (Image credit: Eric Nyquist)\n\nIn 1969, Leonard Susskind imagined the basic building blocks of the universe as invisible vibrating loops of energy. This insight would form the basis of string theory and help lead to a radical re-envisioning of how the universe began. This story is part 2 of a five-part series. [I posted #1 9.10.18]\n\nWhen Leonard Susskind came up with the idea for string theory in 1969, he wasn’t searching for a theory of everything or trying to provoke a fundamental crisis in physics. His ambition was much more modest, at least by the standards of his field: Susskind was trying to explain the “strong” force binding protons and neutrons inside atoms.\n\nSusskind, then a young particle physicist at New York’s Yeshiva University, realized that the mathematical formula that explains what happens when particle pairs collide made more sense if one imagined the particles as individual loops of string that combine and oscillate together for a little while before parting ways.\n\nSusskind describes his joy in that moment in his book The Cosmic Landscape. “You say to yourself, ‘Here I am, the only one on the planet who knows this thing. Soon the rest of the world will know, but for the moment I am the only one.’”\n\nSusskind’s elation lasted for all of two days, until he learned that two other physicists, Yoichiro Nambu at the University of Chicago and Holger Nielsen at the University of Copenhagen, had converged on the idea at exactly the same time.\n\nA unifying theory\n\nSusskind’s excitement began spreading to the rest of the physics community in 1984, when physicists John Schwarz and Michael Green, now at Caltech and the University of Cambridge, respectively, published a paper suggesting that string theory could describe not only the strong force – the one Susskind sought to explain – but the weak and electromagnetic forces as well. Most intriguing of all, it also predicted the existence of a massless particle called a graviton. Gravitons are the presumed quantum messengers of gravity, the slippery fourth force that refuses to be corralled into the Standard Model, the theoretical framework devised by physicists to explain how the basic building blocks of matter interact.\n\nLeonard Susskind, professor of physics, is one of the fathers of string theory. (Image credit: L.A. Cicero)\n\nExuberant theorists everywhere soon felt that they were on the verge of reconciling the mathematical discord between general relativity, which explains gravity, and quantum mechanics, which describes the interactions of the other fundamental forces. “There appear to be no insuperable obstacles to deriving all of known physics,” declared one group of supremely confident string theorists.\n\nIt wasn’t just string theory’s explanatory power that physicists found bewitching. They were also wooed by its mathematical beauty. Those who plumbed the depths of its rigorous equations compared the quest to spiritual enlightenment.\n\nBut the theory demanded a lot from its votaries, such as the blind acceptance of at least 10 dimensions – the four that we are familiar with (up-down, left-right, front-back, and time) – plus another six or more that are invisible because they are curled up, or “compactified,” like origami folded from the fabric of reality.\n\nWhat’s more, these extra dimensions could have different shapes and sizes and be shuffled in myriad ways. Since the geometry of the dimensions determined how the strings vibrate and thus the particles and forces that they can manifest as, the theory allowed for many combinations of physical laws and constants. “In string theory, the same framework that makes it clear that you can get the same qualitative ingredients of gravity, quantum mechanics and the Standard Model together also makes it clear that you can do that in many, many ways,” Shamit Kachru said.\n\nHints of a multiverse\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n“In string theory, the same framework that makes it clear that you can get the same qualitative ingredients of gravity, quantum mechanics and the Standard Model together also makes it clear that you can do that in many, many ways.”\n\n—Shamit Kachru\n\nProfessor of Physics\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe situation grew more complex in the 1990s, when theorists realized that in addition to one-dimensional strings, the theory must also include higher-dimensional membranes, or “branes,” and other ingredients such as fluxes. Physicists had clung to a thread of hope that string theory would reduce down to one inevitable universe whose physics resembled our own. Instead, it seemed to describe an astronomical number of possible universes, a value that was, as Susskind put it, “measured not in the millions or billions but in googols or googolplexes.”\n\nString theory had reached an impasse, and many physicists were disillusioned. Their best bet for the theory of everything contained so many solutions that it might as well be the theory of nothing at all.\n\nSoon, however, a simple but radical proposition emerged: If the theory’s equations did not point to any particular geometry for the extra dimensions, maybe there was no right geometry. Perhaps each mathematical possibility in string theory is realized in nature as a physical reality, and our universe is merely one of a boundless variety in the multiverse.\n\nBut even though string theory allowed for an incredible diversity of worlds, it provided no mechanism for creating them. As Susskind put it, “Mathematical existence is not the same as physical existence. Discovering that string theory had 10500 solutions explains nothing about our world unless we also understand how the corresponding environments came into being.”\n\nFor that, physicists would need to go back to the very first moments of the universe – to the beginning of time itself.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nLeland and Jane Stanford founded the University to “promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on behalf of humanity and civilization.” Stanford opened its doors in 1891, and more than a century later, it remains dedicated to finding solutions to the great challenges of the day and to preparing our students for leadership in today’s complex world.
