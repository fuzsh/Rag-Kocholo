        "text": "I spent the better part of yesterday reading Leonard Susskind's latest book, The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics. Susskind, Felix Bloch Professor of Physics at Stanford University, is one hell of a smart guy, although this book has been dumbed down so much that I'm now wondering why I plunked down $20 for it.\n\nSusskind's basic thesis is that information falling into a black hole is conserved after all, thus preserving a basic tenet of quantum theory. For years, the famed Stephen Hawking believed that information was irretrievably lost, and the book describes the ongoing \"war\" between the two physicists, who have nevertheless always maintained a close friendship and mutual respect for each others' ideas. However, inexplicably, Hawking's now-famous change of mind in 2004 is presented in Susskind's book as almost an afterthought, and it's very anticlimactic, in my opinion.\n\nThere are very few equations in the book, although Hawking and Bekenstein's famous black hole temperature formula is given, but its derivation is too simplified to be of much interest. But Susskind's overview of the interplay between entropy and information is very interesting, and I came away with a renewed appreciation for information theory. Also, Susskind's Holographic Principle, which states that the information swallowed by a black hole exists as a two-dimensional \"film\" residing on the hole's event horizon, has the ring of plausibility to it.\n\nIn Chapter 17, Ahab in Cambridge, Susskind kind of goes to the Bahamas and takes a breather from physics and all that to give us some insight into the soul of this notable Stanford physicist, who's also an avowed atheist. He shares with us some thoughts he has while sitting in the King's College Chapel, where he muses over the likes of Joseph Smith (the founder of the Mormon Church), Darwin, Dawkins and even Melville's Captain Ahab. Susskind goes so far as to admit a certain hollowness he feels over a lifelong belief in nothing but electrons, protons and neutrons.\n\nBut then Susskind puts into words a feeling I've had for many years. He describes \"Cathedralitis\" as the awe inspired by a cleverly assembled pile of stones and colored glass. Though I am a devout Christian, I also have been uncomfortable with such monuments to religiosity — the Sistine Chapel, Notre Dame, even the Crystal Cathedral in Orange County — because, while they were built intentionally to awe, intimidate and bolster the idea that God really exists (and make their owners rich), they are really nothing more than man-made idols of stone, mortar and glass intended to encourage an unquestioning, unreasoning and uncritical belief in their own version of the Almighty. The early Christian church, by comparison, was nothing more than a relative handful of people who met in each others' homes to worship and share ideas. That was the church of Jesus Christ's time, and it's much more appealing to me today. To spend untold millions on fancy megachurches while there is widespread poverty and injustice in the world is, to me, the height of hypocrisy. Anyway, it's a great chapter, and in it you'll also learn why Susskind can walk across the grass at Cambridge today without being molested.\n\nTwo criticisms of the book. Susskind describes only two options for the fate of information falling into a black hole: it's either preserved or lost forever. But this assumes that you believe in black holes in the first place, and it isn't until Page 248 that Susskind gets around to that. My other criticism is the book's lack of explanation as to where information comes from in the first place. Nature? The sentient human mind? Susskind is silent about this, and the book would have been better if he had addressed it.\n\nBTW: Susskind has recorded ten lectures on quantum mechanics at Stanford that you can watch for free on YouTube, with each being about an hour and fifty minutes. The lectures are pretty elementary, but the man is fascinating to watch.\n\nThere is one strong reason in support of the [Weyl] theory. It appears as one of the fundamental principles of Nature that the equations expressing basic laws should be invariant under the widest possible group of transformations. — P.A.M. Dirac, 1973\n\nIt is well known that the great British mathematical physicist Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac was fascinated by the universal physical constants, particularly the gravitational constant G, and he spent a great deal of time in his later years trying to understand them.\n\nPaul Dirac, 1902-1984. He gets my vote as the greatest\n\nphysicist who ever lived.\n\nDirac was also fascinated by the apparently accidental similarity of certain large dimensional constants in nature. For example, the ratio of the electromagnetic force to the gravitational force between a proton and an electron, which is about 2 × 1039, is roughly the same as the ratio of the age of the universe (about 13.7 billion years) to the basic atomic unit e2/mc3, where e and m are respectively the charge and mass of the electron. Dirac was convinced that these similarities were not coincidences at all, but consequences of a deep connection between cosmology and atomic theory. He called this connection the Large Numbers Hypothesis. Dirac’s consideration of these ideas led him to also believe that the numerical values of these constants might actually be changing with time.\n\nThirty-five years ago this month, Dirac published a paper* in which he attempted to explain this connection using Weyl’s original gauge theory of 1918. That the renowned Dirac would return to this theory nearly fifty years after Weyl himself had abandoned it is testimony to the beauty of the idea (and, as anyone who is familiar with the guy knows, mathematical beauty was everything to Dirac). Dirac was particularly intrigued by the possibility of parallel transport of an arbitrary vector in a Weyl space in which transport takes place in time only. Thus, Weyl’s basic differential equation for the variation in vector magnitude for a charged particle, as given by\n\ndL = φμ L dxμ\n\nbecomes\n\ndL = φ0 L dx0\n\nwhere dx0 = c dt and φ0 is the Coulomb potential. Dirac noted that if vector magnitude is taken to increase with increasing time, then it would naturally decrease when dL is shifted into the past. Thus the symmetry of spacetime is broken by Weyl’s geometry, and it can be fixed only if one simultaneously changes the sign of the charge of the particle while interchanging future and past. It was precisely this kind of symmetry breaking that led Dirac to believe that the numerical value of the gravitational constant G might actually be decreasing as the universe gets older.\n\nUnfortunately, G is one of least precisely known fundamental constants. While most atomic constants have been determined to at least six or seven decimals, G's current value of 6.67428 ± 0.00067 × 10-11 m3 kg−1 s−2 hinders observational efforts regarding variation with time. Dirac himself was aware of this problem but he expressed hope that improvements in technology (e.g., interplanetary radar measurements) would answer the question within a few years of his paper.\n\nAlas, Dirac's hope appears to have been in vain. Will we ever know G to greater precision? It is almost as if God decided to make the most obvious force in the universe the least well known. Don't ever think God doesn't have a sense of humor!\n\n* P.A.M. Dirac, Long range forces and broken symmetries, Proc. R. Soc. Lond., A, 333, 403-418, 26 June 1973. British physicist Stephen Hawking has written a number of popularized science books (like The Universe in a Nutshell), but he has also edited a number of books dealing with the history of physics. One of these is 2007’s A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion: The Essential Scientific Works of Albert Einstein, which by itself perpetuates the seeming endless number of Einstein books that have appeared since the 100th anniversary of Einstein’s special relativity theory in 1905. The book’s title comes from a letter of condolence Einstein wrote to the family of his dear and lifelong friend, Michele Besso, who died in March 1955, just before Einstein’s own death a month later:\n\nNow he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\n\nThe book is really nothing more than a collection of articles that Einstein wrote from 1905 to 1955, most of which are translated from the original German. I have read all of these articles over the years, not only for the physics but also to get a grasp of the mind of Einstein. In comparison with contemporary physics articles, Einstein's stuff is fairly easy to follow, and many of his philosophical ideas are a revelation, so I encourage you to pick the book up (your local library probably has it) and read it for yourself.\n\nThe special theory of relativity was but a prelude to Einstein’s greatest work, which was his general theory of relativity. Published in November 1915, it probably would have stunned the world even more if it hadn’t appeared at the height of World War I. Physicists prior to the advent of the theory had been concentrating on advancing physics via the special theory. They all made some progress, and a number of them were actually attempting to explain the nature of matter through the theory. These attempts all failed, but when the general theory arrived they took up the cause with renewed vigor.\n\nThe first of these efforts was probably that proposed by Gustav Mie in 1913, whose attempts to explain matter as a consequence of electrodynamics resulted in one of the first unified field theories. Mie and others, including Hermann Weyl, renewed this failed effort using the physics of Einstein’s curved spacetime, perhaps the most notable aspect of his general theory. But these efforts also failed.\n\nIn 1919, Einstein himself attempted to reconcile the nature of matter with the gravitational field equations of the general theory. But he immediately noted that the presence of matter in his equations was \"gravely detrimental to the formal beauty of the theory.\" Einstein's equations in the presence of matter can be written as\n\nRμν - ½ R gμν = k Tμν\n\nwhere Tμν is the matter tensor. Einstein described the left hand side of the equation as being made of \"beautiful marble,\" as it perfectly described the motions of the planets and a host of other physical phenomena. But Einstein described the matter term as being made of \"wood,\" because it consisted of almost empirical quantities that did not depend on the variability of the metric tensor gμν. Even though Einstein was able to deduce the form of the matter tensor for electrodynamics and a field of moving, non-interacting, incoherent matter, it brought him no closer to any real understanding of the nature of matter.\n\nEinstein’s beloved colleague Hermann Weyl was also obsessed with the nature of matter, and his signature book Space-Time-Matter was written primarily to address this very question. In doing so, Weyl came across his own unified field theory, which at first seemed to successfully incorporate electrodynamics into the geometrical construct of the general theory of relativity. However, in time this effort also failed, and over the ensuing years Weyl moved away from his obsession with the nature of matter and became more interested in group theory and quantum mechanics. Erhard Scholz, an expert on the history and mathematics of Weyl’s work, eloquently describes Weyl’s interest in matter in his 2007 article \"The Changing Concept of Matter in H. Weyl’s Thought, 1918-1930,\" which you can download from my site here.\n\nEinstein famously stuck with his theory for the last thirty years of his life, trying to develop a consistent field theory that would unify gravitation and electrodynamics and, later, quantum mechanics. Just as famously, he failed utterly in all of these efforts. But late in life he never expressed any bitterness or frustration over his failures, and he remained convinced that the Truth was in the equations, and that it was his own lack of intellectual and mathematical ability that had prevented the sought-after breakthrough. Today, we realize that Einstein can be forgiven on two accounts: one, that today's mathematical physicists, who are far better trained than Einstein (and probably a lot smarter as well), aren’t getting anywhere, either; and two, that Einstein’s ideas may yet lead to a successful theory (perhaps via the mathematics of strings), albeit in a form that the great scientist could have never dreamed of.\n\nTwo more final tidbits for the more mathematically inclined among you: In his 1919 article \"Do Gravitational Fields Play an Essential Part in the Structure of the Elementary Particles of Matter?\" Einstein noted that a slight change in his field equations as given by\n\nRμν - ¼ R gμν = k Tμν\n\nwould resolve numerous problems with the theory of matter in the presence of an electromagnetic field. The ¼ coefficient now makes the left hand side of the equation traceless, as is the matter term for the electromagnetic energy tensor Tμν. Although Einstein was forced to make the change without any real justification, it is interesting to note that the field equations resulting from Hermann Weyl’s 1918 gauge theory provide this very coefficient automatically.\n\nLastly, Einstein's equations are of second order in the metric tensor and its partial derivatives, while Weyl's are of fourth order. This fact has been used to criticize the theory as having more solutions than are necessary. However, Weyl's equations for free space force the Ricci scalar R to be a non-zero constant; this not only removes the fourth-order difficulty but leads to the same predictions (bending of starlight, gravitational red shift, perihelion shift of Mercury, etc.) that Einstein's equations have long been noted for.\n\nBlood for Oil\n\nFrom today's Daily Kos:\n\nDamn you rich! You already have your compensation.\n\nDamn you who are well-fed! You will know hunger.\n\nDamn you who laugh now! You will weep and grieve.\n\nDamn you when everybody speaks well of you!\n\nA rant from a radical preacher? Without a doubt. Someone on the Obama campaign? Well, Sen. Obama says so. That's the Scholars Translation of Luke 6:24-26, and the speaker is Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nIn the King James Version, the first part of Luke 6:24 reads But woe unto you that are rich! That comes off as quaint and a lot less shocking to modern ears — not the kind of preaching that nets you space on Fox News. But Jesus meant his words to be shocking. He meant them to strike against the status quo and shake up the comfortable.\n\nGod damn America for treating our citizens as less than human!\n\nGod damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme!\n\nThat's Jeremiah Wright.\n\nIs the vision of a pastor standing in his pulpit shouting \"God damn America\" shocking? Yes. But don't mistake Wright's (or Jesus') statement for what some drunk in a bar would mean using the same phrasing. Wright isn't saying \"FU America!\" He's saying \"These actions of America are worthy of God's condemnation.\" He's just saying it in a way that cuts through the Sunday morning sleepiness and makes people sit up in their pew.\n\nFrom Gandhi to King, it's in the nature of spiritual leaders to grab their audiences by the throat and their nations by the short hairs. This was true at the time of the Civil War and during the Civil Rights movement. Martyrs did not become martyrs by appealing to the status quo.\n\nDon't take this to mean that I agree with every word that Wright spoke (e.g. the United States did not create AIDS), but neither do I feel like his words require that \"his church should lose its tax exempt status\" that he's a traitor, or that he's an embarrassment to his church or to Senator Obama — all comments that have appeared on this site.\n\nDo I think that 9/11 was the \"chickens coming home to roost?\" Yeah, I pretty much do. Of course the terrorists bear the personal responsibility for their actions and the deaths that resulted. But to pretend that decades of actions overseas had nothing to do with that terrible morning is far more delusional than anything said by Rev. Wright. If you jab a stick into a hornet's nest and shake it for fifty years, the hornets might do the stinging, but you can't blame only the hornets. Actions have consequences, and though we may pretend to both purity of motive and prescience about outcomes, the truth is that violence tends to generate violence in return. Or, as that radical I quoted above said \"those who take up the sword, will die by the sword.\"\n\nThe purpose of a good sermon isn't to placate, ease, and make people comfortable. A dangerous religion isn't one that challenges people and makes them squirm. Makes them angry. A dangerous religion is one that is too amicable to what you already think, one that pats you on the head and sends you forth in assurance of your own righteousness. If you want to search for \"traitors\" in the pulpit, turn your eye toward those who never find anything wrong in the actions of this nation.\n\nI understand why Senator Obama finds it necessary to distance himself from Rev. Wright. There were plenty of things in those sermons that I don't agree with, and I'm suspect many of the ideas that grate on my nerves also strike the Senator as either wrong or unsustainable politically. These days, three isolated words on the news seem far more important than context or intent. But I wish he didn't have to do so.\n\nBecause getting your personal beliefs regularly challenged, rather than reinforced, is important.\n\nAMEN! — wostraub Der Dummkopf Führer, George W. Bush, spoke to a group of religious-themed broadcasters in Nashville, Tennessee today and his theme, as usual, was that the rest of the world is evil and has to be destroyed. And everything Bush said in his speech confirms what I just read in traditional conservative Patrick Buchanan’s latest book, Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology and Greed are Tearing America Apart.\n\nBuchanan has occasionally driven me to tears with his conservative opinions, but the views he expresses in this book I can almost completely agree with. For one thing, Buchanan appears to be a true Christian; he’s a Roman Catholic, but, like me, he does not approve of abortion, homosexuality, and the rampant materialism, anti-intellectualism and anti-environmentalism that now defines this corrupt country.\n\nAt the same time, Buchanan manages to upset me with his supportive views regarding Arctic drilling and minority population control. The chapter Deconstructing America is actually very offensive, although Buchanan probably does not realize it. He admits that the colonization of America was founded not on God, freedom and equality but rather on greed and racism, though he is not apologetic in the least.\n\nBut Buchanan just nails it on everything else, which pretty much has to do with the disastrous ideology of George W. Bush. Writing about the run-up to the Iraq War, he says\n\n\"The only lesson we learn from history is that we do not learn from history,\" I concluded. This was written six months before Bush invaded Iraq.\n\nBut the president’s mind had been made up. Having named Iraq an axis-of-evil nation possessing weapons of mass destruction, having laid out his doctrine of preventive war, Bush, in March 2003, ordered the invasion. In three weeks, it was over. Yet the United States has never been able to find any evidence Iraq was plotting to attack us or its neighbors, has never found any solid tie between Saddam and Al Qaeda or the perpetrators of 9/11, has never found an Iraqi nuclear program, has never found any weapons of mass destruction. We attacked, invaded, and occupied a nation that had never attacked us or threatened us — to strip it of weapons it did not have.\n\nPresident George W. Bush is a criminal. Most of those in his administration are criminals. It will aggravate me to my dying day that these monsters will receive no earthly punishment for their crimes and the misery and grief they have caused. And it aggravates me beyond words that the citizens of this country, and the Republican Party in particular, have chosen not only to ignore these crimes, but to support them.\n\nFinally, for your viewing pleasure, here's Bush at last night's Gridiron Club dinner, actually boasting in song that convicted felon Scooter Libby has finally escaped the prosecutor! Watch it if your stomach can stand it:\n\nHard to believe that this moron is the President of the United States. Hermann Weyl, along with the likes of Wolfgang Pauli, Theodor Kaluza, Oskar Klein and even Paul Dirac, each spent several years on the development of a unified field theory of physics. These scientists initially thought they were on to something, but the theories were either rejected outright or made predictions that were proved to be wrong (or worse, they didn't predict anything, period).\n\nAround 1925, the unification bug also bit Einstein. But unlike his contemporaries, Einstein spent decade after decade chasing one crazy idea after another until, as his friend Abraham Pais had it, \"he laid down his pen and died.\" Einstein labored for thirty years on unification while essentially ignoring the real progress that was being made by others, most notably in quantum mechanics. Pauli and the others, all close friends of Einstein, could only sadly shake their heads, wondering why Einstein had wasted all that time and effort.\n\nThe situation can be compared today with the fact that roughly thirty years have now elapsed since string theory was first proposed. But although string theory has made no verifiable predictions and has offered no real insight into the nature of the physical world, it seems as if everybody is working on it. This turnaround from the futility of Einstein's efforts to the hope that string theory is the correct \"theory of everything\" is especially notable in view of the caliber of the scientists who are currently engaged in string research (most of these guys far surpass Einstein in terms of sheer brilliance and mathematical ability).\n\nColumbia University's Peter Woit, along with anti-string comrade in arms Lee Smolin of Canada's Perimeter Institute, believes that it's time to give string theory a rest. They both feel that the world's most brilliant scientists should refocus their efforts instead on conventional quantum field theory or on promising new ideas like loop quantum gravity.\n\nIn his book Not Even Wrong, Woit laments the very real possibility that, like Einstein, we've wasted decades of research effort and money chasing a nonexistent mirage. Smolin's book, The Trouble with Physics, reiterates this same lament. Both scientists fear that, given the effort and expense already invested, researchers will feel they have no recourse but to follow string theory to the bitter end — that is, if there is one.\n\nSeveral physicists have noted that the quest for a unified theory can be likened to a disease of the mind. Weyl himself was afflicted by it, but he wisely gave it up and pursued more productive avenues. Although Weyl's basic unification idea remained in the back of his head, he finally discovered its true (and very profound) application in quantum mechanics, not gravitation.\n\nWhile watching glaciers melt on the Nature Channel last night, my younger son and I discussed the plight of the polar bears, whose disappearing ice floes are forcing them to do their hunting while swimming on the open sea. He wondered if the bears will survive the next few decades, and I replied that I had my doubts. At that moment, I wondered why it is that our brightest minds are playing with strings and not working on ways to ensure the survival of planet's inhabitants, including us.\n\nIn my moments of darkest despair, I wonder if these scientists already realize that mankind is determined to destroy this planet and itself, and that working on unified field theory simply provides a means of occupying their tormented faculties. While the high-energy physics community can look forward to significant funding increases in 2009 (as promised by President Bush, who knows damn well he won't be around then to fulfill them), California public schools are facing truly draconian budget cuts.\n\nIt seems that we go through this little exercise on a regular basis. While he was campaigning to boot out Gray Davis in 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger promised that he would be an \"education governor,\" dedicated to providing educational excellence in California's public schools. When reality began to set in in 2005, Schwarzenegger threatened to go back on earlier funding promises, but backed down under enormous pressure by the Democratically-held State legislature.\n\nNow the state faces a gargantuan $16 billion budget shortfall. Unlike the federal government, which can borrow money or let deficits go on forever, the states are required to pass annual balanced budgets.\n\nSo how is Schwarzenegger proposing to deal with the crisis? That's right — by slashing the public education budget by almost $5 billion. And this time around, in view of the enormity of the state's budget crisis, Schwarzenegger means it. In response, school administrators around the state are already sending out notices of anticipated budget cuts, hiring freezes, and teacher layoffs.\n\nThis seems to be the way this country does things — when the money gets tight, our children's educational needs are abandoned.\n\nDid I hear you say \"raise taxes\" to deal with the problem? Unlike his predecessor Davis, Schwarzenegger knows full well that would be political suicide. Although Schwarzenegger can sexually molest women, smoke pot and inject himself with illegal steroids without unduly arousing the hypocritical Republican ruling class in this state (or the fawning celebrity-watchers still entranced by having a Terminator for governor), raising taxes would be a terrible mistake. Why, he might even be recalled!\n\nHow about increasing class size? Well, I've done volunteer work for inner-city schools having 40-50 kids in each class, and I can tell you that very little education actually takes place under these conditions.\n\nThen what about year-round school? Or expanded classroom hours? Or Saturday classes? Those options might work, but if you think the kids are educationally challenged now, I suspect they'd be little more than mindless idiots if these alternatives were implemented.\n\nHow about home schooling? That might also work, provided at least one parent is available to teach his/her kids during the day. I understand there's a lot of this in the South, where godless subjects like math, science and evolutionary biology have been replaced by good old-fashioned Biblical indoctrination. But in most places where both parents work, the folks are already pretty shagged out from working 70-hour work weeks, so that's probably out.\n\nThe only remaining solution seems to be to leave our children ignorant. Sure, we need more engineers and scientists, but we can always get them from India and China. Besides, those foreigners seem to be the only people interested in math and science anyway. In the first edition of his 1918 book Space-Time-Matter, Hermann Weyl derived the combined gravitational/electromagnetic field surrounding a spherical, non-rotating material point of mass M and charge Q. (I believe Weyl was the first to do this, but I'm not sure; the Finnish physicist Gunnar Nordström is usually credited with the derivation. At any rate it has nothing to do with Weyl's 1918 unified field theory.) Anyway, Weyl used the Schwarzschild line element\n\nds2 = eνc2dt2 - eλdr2 - r2dθ2 - r2sin2θdφ2,\n\nwhere the quantities ν, λ are functions of the radial marker r (this is not the physical distance from the center, but it's close enough for discussion purposes). Using Einstein's equations for the space external to the mass point, he came up with\n\nwhich is just the Schwarzschild solution with an extra term that accounts for the electric charge Q.\n\nIt is interesting to note that spacetime is flat (eν, eλ = 1) precisely at the critical distance marker r = Q2/(8πc2M). At this distance, the field effects of the mass and charge exactly cancel one another (ignoring any quantum contributions). Is this distance physically relevant?\n\nFor a proton, this distance works out to roughly 10-30 meters. This is only five magnitudes larger than the Planck scale, so it certainly cannot have any physical significance.\n\nWhat about extended regions of charged matter in which Q becomes large? Well, that's a thought, but then the mass M must also become large, offsetting the charge effect. I can think of nothing that might yield an observable critical distance with the possible exception of a charged black hole.\n\nWhen a star undergoes complete gravitational collapse (by whatever process you choose), any net electrical charge is almost certainly radiated away, leaving an uncharged black hole. But if this loss could be circumvented in some way, then it is just possible that a detectable critical distance could exist. Still, even for a black hole of one solar mass the hole's charge would have to be truly enormous (roughly 1024 coulombs) to set up a critical distance of only one meter. But the hole's crushing tidal forces would completely overwhelm any interest one might have at that point!\n\nIn 1965, the line element for a rotating, charged black hole was discovered by E. T. Newman and his collaborators. It can be shown that the external field of such a body is consistent with Dirac's relativistic electron theory, a purely quantum theory. In the 1970s, Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking used quantum field theory to show that back holes can evaporate through the process of electron-positron pair formation at the event horizon. These findings give hope that the long-awaited unification of gravity and electromagnetism may one day be discovered, perhaps via major breakthroughs in black hole observation and research.\n\nLastly, it is interesting to note that Weyl, Einstein and other early relativists did not believe in black holes. [Note: the term black hole didn't come along until 1967; in Weyl's day, it was called a collapsed star.] They believed that as matter was compressed, it would eventually provide sufficient pressure to resist the star's final plunge past the event horizon. But it was eventually demonstrated that pressure acts as a kind of mass-energy that serves to increase gravity's compressional effect; thus, pressure actually hastens the star's collapse to a black hole.\n\nFascinating stuff, simply fascinating. In Volume 6 of their book The Historical Development of Quantum Theory, authors Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg describe the early concepts of atomic and quantum physics in the formative years of those theories (from the Bohr hydrogen atom to the Schrödinger equation). It includes a brief overview of Hermann Weyl's unified field theory along with the reaction of noted physicists in the first few years following its announcement.\n\nWeyl's theory appeared about 2 years after Einstein's November 1915 general relativity theory. Since Einstein's theory of gravitation perfectly predicted the deflection of light and the perihelion advance of the planet Mercury, it was natural that Weyl's theory would also be investigated to see how well it could describe these phenomena.\n\nIt's hard to believe, but the book recounts how an 18-year-old Wolfgang Pauli was one of the first to investigate Weyl's theory. Using a variational principle for the Weyl action, Pauli showed the theory was in complete agreement with Einstein's, thus paving the way toward a fuller recognition of Weyl's work by the physics community.\n\nHowever, Pauli also believed Weyl's theory to be deficient in several important areas. In 1919, Pauli wrote\n\nThe main difficulty ... is that the theory does not satisfactorily explain the asymmetry of both types of electricity [i.e., positive and negative charge]. That won't be easy to remove. I also do not want to forget about a physical-conceptual objection. In Weyl's theory one operates constantly with the field strength in the interior of the electron. For the physicist, however, this quantity is defined only as a force acting on a test body; and, since exist no smaller test bodies than the electron itself, the concept of an electric field strength in a mathematical point appears to be an empty, meaningless fiction. In physics, one would prefer to stick to introducing only those quantities which can, in principle, be observed. Might we not altogether be on the wrong track in considering continuum-field theories for the field in the interior of the electron?\n\nIt is absolutely remarkable that the teenage Pauli was not only able to analyze Weyl's theory in the way he did but to actually anticipate the need for extended (i.e., discontinuous or non-point) theories for the elementary particles. Almost 70 years later, Pauli's musings became the basis of modern string theory. Last night the History Channel aired a one-hour program called Dark Matter/Dark Energy, a pretty good layperson's overview of the \"missing matter\" problem now vexing cosmologists. The usual gang of experts, including Michio Kaku, Alex Filipenko and Caltech's Richard Ellis were on hand to try explain why it's a big deal. And it is a big deal — dark energy, a kind of anti-gravity field, is apparently causing the universe to expand at an ever-increasing rate. In only a few hundred billion years(!), the universal expansion rate will approach the speed of light, and all bits of matter remaining in the universe will exist only as lonely, cold, isolated islands of stuff. Ice death, as some cosmologists call it.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Einstein (who believed the universe must be static) famously introduced a \"fudge factor\" into his gravitational field equations to prevent them from producing either an expanding or contracting universe. When astronomer Edwin Hubble showed in 1929 that the universe was expanding, Einstein tossed out the factor, calling it the greatest blunder of his career.\n\nBut late in the History Channel program, Kaku describes how Einstein might have had it right all along. Since dark energy appears to be a kind of ether permeating all space, it might not be any kind of matter or field at all, but a quality of spacetime that is represented by by Einstein's fudge factor (the cosmological constant Λ).\n\nIt is interesting to note that Hermann Weyl's modified version of Einstein's theory produces an intrinsic acceleration effect without the artifice of a cosmological constant. If you vary the Einstein-Hilbert and Weyl actions respectively, you get\n\nwhere the cosmological constant Λ has to be intentionally added in after the fact (this is allowed because the covariant derivative D of the metric tensor is zero). Weyl's action principle results in a traceless field term which, when applied to empty space (T = 0), gives the same results as Einstein's field equations (gravitational red shift, bending of starlight, perihelion advance of the planet Mercury, etc.) but with an acceleration effect that is proportional to a constant, non-zero Ricci scalar R. However, Weyl's field equations are not divergenceless. This means the theory cannot account for the conservation of mass-energy.\n\nI've pondered previously if Weyl's theory (which has been proven wrong) was even more on the right track than Einstein's. But until scientists can get a better handle on the problem, we won't know for sure who, if anyone, was right. I remember when I started college in 1967 there was this guy in one of my classes who had a Curta calculator. He paid something like $150 for it, a fortune in those days, and I still remember how badly I wanted one:\n\nThe Curta was produced by some Austrian guy who worked up the design while in a Nazi concentration camp. It had the look, size and feel of a combination pepper grinder and hand grenade (which means that you'd win a free one-way trip to Guantánamo if you brought one into class nowadays). It had a bunch of sliders on the side of the cylinder with which you'd dial in the numbers you wanted to multiply or divide, and this awesome crank on top that you'd spin until the thing locked up, giving you the answer. I don't recall how many decimal places it went out to, but it was much more accurate than a slide rule.\n\nThe only thing equivalent to a Curta was the Frieden calculator, an electric typewriter-like thingy with numerical entry buttons. It weighed maybe 20 pounds (so it was hardly portable), but it could do calculations out to 14 decimals on the better models. The downside was that it would have to crank for quite a while if you wanted that kind of accuracy.\n\nMy physical chemistry professor was a stickler for accuracy, and he demanded that we do our thermodynamics problems using the Frieden. This meant queuing up outside the school's data-processing center (yes, that's what it was called then) to get some time on the thing. Either that, or go punch a lot of data cards in FORTRAN and run the problems on the school's IBM 360.\n\nI recently looked for a Curta calculator on eBay and got the shock of my life. Yes, they're available, but they now run around $1,000 for a working unit. Dang it all, I still can't afford one!"
