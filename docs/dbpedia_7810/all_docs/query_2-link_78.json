However with that said.. it doesnt mean you cant reach different orders of understanding.

Physics as a hobby can be equally fulfilling as a profession.\n\nHere my advice:\n\n1) Find out where your current knowledge ends. If youre pre-algebra Im sure theres tons of quality youtube channels that can help you out in the beginning.\n\n2) Take your time. Dont stress. Enjoy the ride. Dont try to reach string theory as soon as possible, have joy in solving exercise, discussing topics and playing with examples.\n\n3) Find out where your physics level ends as well and do the same, in parallell.

I have my old middle school textbooks (6th, 7th, and 8th grade) that I am hoping to whiz through so that I can take on pre-algebra which I really struggled with. Then after that is I plan on studying: Algebra -> Geometry -> Algebra II -> Trigonometry -> Pre-Calculus -> Calculus. Is this a good path? Will I need to go beyond Calculus and at which level can I study Physics and Math concurrently? My physics knowledge is effectively none, except from general knowledge that I have heard from physicists on popular podcasts. Also, any resources where I can get my worked checked? Thanks for the encouragement, so far I am having fun relearning math.\n\nRiman643 said:\n\nWhat maths will I need to learn? Calculus? And for Physics, is there a text that covers the prerequisites to understand String Theory? I just need to chart a path for myself.\n\nAlso, Eric Clapton is the goat.\n\nYes you 100% need to learn calculus. Do that first. After that, my favorite resource for people who want to start learning these topics is Leonard Susskind's lectures and books. By the way, he is one of the people who originated the key concepts of string theory.\n\nSusskind did a continued studies program where he basically taught people who already knew some math etc but weren't actually physics students the main concepts of modern physics. You can find his courses here: https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses\n\nHe also has books based on the courses. You can find them by searching for \"Theoretical minimum books susskind\" or something like that. I believe his books are on classical mechanics, special relativity, general relativity and quantum mechanics. I've looked into the classical and the quantum mechanics ones, I liked them. In my opinion you should both read the books and watch the lectures if you really want to understand. You should also not be afraid to use pen and paper and take down notes etc.\n\nYou'll see that in the supplementary courses section, Susskind has one on string theory. But you HAVE to have learned the main courses first well if you want to touch that, otherwise you won't understand what's happening.\n\nAs you can see there's lots of these lectures and books, even though they are supposed to be the \"Theoretical Minimum\", as in the absolute least you should know before you can understand modern physics. And of course you have to already know a bit of calculus. That's a lot of work, but imo you shouldn't look at it as a thing you have to do in order to get to the goal of string theory, it's an interesting journey on its own.\n\nThe alternative is to read a popular science book on string theory, but it's a subject far too advanced to be done any kind of justice by a pop sci book. You will learn words, but not much more than that.\n\nRiman643 said:\n\nI have started studying math, but I am unsure of the right path to take.

My physics knowledge is effectively none, except from general knowledge that I have heard from physicists on popular podcasts. Also, any resources where I can get my worked checked? Thanks for the encouragement, so far I am having fun relearning math.\n\nLets put it like this, as long as you are pre-calculus or anywhere near calculus, you can take whichever path that suits you, preferably the one that the authors suggest for you, or the path found on any college plan focusing on the natural sciences.\n\nIf you want to get a grasp of string theory, then you can study the courses offered by any standard university for a bachelor degree in physics without worrying to learn anything unnecessary, a pair of courses may be skipped (depending on the university), such as Solid State Physics, but also a course like that leads to phenomena that can be interesting in the end.\n\nTo put i short, follow the already working plans of institutions and come back when you know your linear algebra, multivariable calculus, fourier transform, abstract algebra and differential geometry, classical physics, quantum physics, relativity both special and general.\n\nIf you really want to understand Wittens work I would guess the math leading up to and including calculus is maybe 0.5 % of the math you need. Most of his work is _very_ mathematical.\n\nRiman643 said:\n\nWill I need to go beyond Calculus and at which level can I study Physics and Math concurrently?\n\nIf you get to the level where you learn what a vector, what a derivative and what an integral are and how to use them then you can start learning physics concurrently. You can even be just before that level and start learning physics concurrently, if you find some basic physics resources that also explain the math.\n\nIf you want to understand, say, a research paper by Witten, there is no way to do that unless you basically become a theoretical physicist. But you can get a very general idea with less resources. You're on a good path.\n\nI also agree with people saying that you could look at the paths provided by the curricula of universities.\n\nWitten is a Fields medalist, i.e. one of the very best mathematicians in the world, even through he is a first of all a physicist. I suggest you should not be depressed at having difficulty understanding his research. I am a senior citizen with a PhD in complex algebraic geometry and a 40 year research career, and I do not understand even all the mathematics used in string theory, much less the physics. I was even an invited speaker at a string theory conference at the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, to speak on my specialty of Riemann surfaces, a basic tool in string theory. I gather one needs in addition to calculus, also complex analysis, Riemann surfaces, algebraic topology, and differential topology. This takes years or decades to master.\n\nThe good news is that it is all fascinating, and you will enjoy any aspect of it you learn. As successful athletes say, take it one step at a time. Calculus is quite hard and powerful, and learning that is way past average. Algebra is perhaps even more useful, and that is the place to start if you are looking for a challenge.\n\nI am told that string theory is a theory of reality that assumes the fundamental structure element is not a \"particle\" but a surface with a complex analytic structure, called a Riemann surface. You might enjoy pursuing some introductions to the concept of a Riemann surface, e.g. the little Dover book by Felix Klein.\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36959\n\nThis already assumes a lot of math but does have some fun pictures. Enjoy your voyage."
