        "text": "This is part 3 of my review of The Cosmic Landscape by Leonard Susskind.\n\nThe subtitle of Leonard Susskind’s book is String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent Design. For the most part, the book is not about the Intelligent Design or God. It provides an excellent overview of modern physics and the more speculative conjectures of string theory. I have a sneaking suspicion that the subtitle was added as bait.\n\nWhen Susskind chooses to deal with matters religious, I found his discussion to be inadequate, even condescending. Remember: critiquing is difficult! Just because an idea is wrong doesn’t mean that it can be easily swept aside. Here are a few examples.\n\nThe Whole Point of Science\n\n[T]wo stories are possible. The first is creationist: God made man with some purpose that involved man’s ability to appreciate and worship God. Let’s forget that story. The whole point of science is to avoid such stories. [The second is the multiverse]. (pg. 196)\n\nThere is a sneaking suspicion amongst theists that the multiverse is an ad hoc hypothesis, invented for the sole purpose of avoiding the obvious conclusion that this universe was designed to support life. The hypothesis that there are a vast number of universes “out there” with different constants and even different laws, universes that we have no chance of ever observing, seems an extraordinarily desperate move for a scientist to make. Susskind doesn’t exactly assuage these doubts.\n\nThe whole point of science is to explain the phenomena of physical reality in terms of physical laws. If reality includes a multiverse, then we should try to understand this fact. If it doesn’t, then so be it. If there’s a God who made it all, we don’t want to forget that fact, even if it isn’t a scientific fact.\n\n“Real” Scientists\n\n[S]cientists – real scientists – resist the temptation to explain natural phenomena, including creation itself, by divine intervention. Why? Because as scientists we understand that there is a compelling human need to believe – the need to be comforted – that easily clouds people’s judgment. It’s all too easy to fall into the seductive trap of a comforting fairy tale. (pg. 355)\n\nBy this definition, Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, Francis Bacon, Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Blaise Pascal, Leonard Euler, Sir William Herschel, Michael Faraday, James Joule, James Clerk Maxwell, Louis Pasteur, Arthur Eddington, Max Planck, George Ellis, John Polkinghorne, Arthur Schawlow, Alan Sandage, Don Page, Chris Isham, Donald Knuth, Owen Gingerich, Francis Collins, Bill Newsome, R. J. Berry, and Simon Conway Morris are not “real scientists”. That’s quite a claim. One might expect Susskind to give some evidence for it, or even the slightest indication of how he came to this conclusion.\n\nHe says that “real” scientists don’t believe in God because comforting beliefs cloud our judgement. Granted, it is very important to be aware of our own biases. But not everybody finds belief in God comforting. Here is Thomas Nagel:\n\nI want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well-informed people I know are religious believers. It isn’t just that I don’t believe in God and, naturally, I hope that I’m right in my belief. It’s that I hope there is no God! I don’t want there to be a God; I don’t want the universe to be like that.\n\nShould I believe in God because atheists find atheism comforting? To my mind, this is simply a stalemate. Each side can make up a story about how the other side only believes what they believe because they want to. Theism is the desire for a father figure. Atheism is the desire to kill the father figure. Blah blah blah. Certainly, don’t believe things because you find them comforting. But don’t disbelieve things because you find them comforting either. That’s just as unhelpful a filter. I find my doona comforting – and yet, there it is.\n\nSo, is there a God?\n\nOne theme has threaded its way through our long and winding tour from Feynman diagrams to bubbling universes: our own universe is an extraordinary place that appears to be fantastically well designed for our own existence. This specialness is not something that we can attribute to lucky accidents, which is far too unlikely. The apparent coincidences cry out for an explanation.\n\nAn immensely popular story, not only among the general public but also many scientists, is that a “superarchitect” designed the universe with some benevolent purpose in mind. … But this is an intellectually unsatisfying, if emotionally comforting, explanation. Left unanswered are: who designed the designer, by what mechanism the designer intervenes to guide evolution, whether the designer violates the Laws of Physics to accomplish its goals, and whether the designer itself is subject to the laws of quantum mechanics. (pg. 343)\n\nSo we resist, to the death, all explanations of the world based on anything but the Laws of Physics, mathematics, and probability. (pg. 355)\n\nFirst of all, the fact that a hypothesis raises further questions does not make the hypothesis false. To give it a positive spin, one might say that the idea is fruitful. One just as often hears the claim that an appeal to God puts an end to our investigation. It could be that the properties of our universe were not set by “God” – that is, a metaphysically necessary being – but merely a scientist in the next universe up (call her Divina) who has worked out how to create universes to her liking. This would be no more supernatural a hypothesis than making a sandwich. Susskind’s questions still apply, but they don’t prove that the idea is false. “Ah yes”, I hear you say, “but God is supposed to be an ultimate explanation”. Maybe, but that doesn’t mean that every truth about God will be obvious, or even knowable.\n\nLet’s have a closer look at the questions.\n\nWho designed the designer? The whole point of rhetorical questions is that they aren’t supposed to be answerable. Your average theologian, who believes that God is the ultimate answer to the apparent design in the universe, thinks that he can answer this question. Is it a good answer? You’ll have to go find out for yourself, because Susskind doesn’t even acknowledge the attempt. I’ll take a closer look at this question in a later post.\n\nBy what mechanism does the designer intervene to guide evolution? This isn’t a particularly pressing issue, especially when we’re considering fine-tuning. Many theists would answer that there is no reason to believe that God intervenes in evolution at all. Divina could (all but) ensure that intelligent beings would evolve in her created universe, with a judicious choice of physical laws and initial conditions, without having to stick her finger in the works.\n\nDoes the designer violate the Laws of Physics? Same deal: Divina is smart enough to achieve her goals using the laws of physics. She might choose to perform the occasional miracle to prove her existence and powers to her creation. Whether Divina has actually caused an event that is beyond the abilities of the laws of nature is a question for historians. It cannot be decided a priori, or by simply assuming that physical laws are never broken.\n\nIs designer itself is subject to the laws of quantum mechanics? Chess players aren’t subject to the laws of chess. Real bishops don’t move diagonally. Divina isn’t necessarily subject to the physics she creates in her universe. A metaphysically necessary being, creator of all reality outside itself, wouldn’t be subject to quantum mechanics. The fact that Susskind even asks the question suggests that his god is too small.\n\nSo we resist, to the death, all explanations of the world based on anything but the Laws of Physics, mathematics, and probability.\n\nMathematics and probability cannot tell us which possible world is actual. We cannot deduce how the world actually is. The laws of physics, wonderful though they are, do not (as we currently understand them) explain the constants of physics and the initial conditions of the universe. Most importantly, the laws of physics cannot (logically cannot!) explain themselves. Why are the laws of physics the way they are, rather than some other possible laws? Why are there laws at all? It’s no use appealing to deeper laws or emergent laws or laws that create multiverses – there will always be a remainder, staring back from the blackboard, unexplained.\n\nSean Carroll states it beautifully: “that’s just how things are. There is a chain of explanations concerning things that happen in the universe, which ultimately reaches to the fundamental laws of nature and stops.” To be a materialist is to resist, to the death, all attempts to explain the fundamental laws of nature and the ultimate properties of matter.\n\nIs this intellectually satisfying? Susskind cites the fact that the God hypothesis is intellectually unsatisfying as a reason to doubt that it is true. The unstated premise in this deduction goes something like this: “ultimate reality will be intellectually satisfying to human beings”? But why should that premise be true on materialism? Why should there be such an intimate connection between the ultimate laws of nature and the lump of flesh in my skull? This sounds like a theistic premise – Descartes fought his way back to a knowledge of the external world by arguing that only in a universe created by a benevolent God could we assume a reliable connection between our minds, our senses and the universe around us. “Descartes’s picture did a great deal to establish the notion of a physical world which is fundamentally of a mathematical character and permits mathematical physics to be done” (Bernard Williams). Susskind argues against the existence of God using a premise that it seems would only be true if God exists. As Nietzsche noted in the context of morality, “By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one’s hands”. Materialism must start from scratch, and not just surgically remove God from the inherited Western (Christian) view of the universe.\n\nConclusion\n\nSusskind’s science exposition is excellent, but he has barely scratched the surface of the debate between materialism and theism."
