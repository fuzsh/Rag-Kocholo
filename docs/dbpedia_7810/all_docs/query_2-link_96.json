        "text": "Physics lectures are of three types according to this anecdote of Niels Bohr: “A young man was sent by his own village to a neighboring town to hear a great Rabbi. He was to bring back a report in which all could share. When he returned he told his eagerly\n\nI've always been frustrated by Quantum Physics books that leave out the mathematical details, but I understand why; there is a lot of foundation to get under your belt before you can get to the details. This book fills in that foundation and . Stanford Professor Leonard\n\nI've been working through this book. I learned quantum in my undergrad years from the Tannoudji book. It was very dry and I spend most my time trying to figure out what he (Tannoudji) was trying to say, THEN figure out whether I can prove it, etc. Funny how really smart\n\nWhat a beautiful book! I have reread it several times, I discovered so many beautiful details with each rereading. Yes, there are formula and calculation, but not really difficult. Persevere, the sweet comes in Chapters 8 10, which cover some applications, other than\n\nVery entertaining book like every single lecture Prof. Susskind has posted on youtube. It gives an excellent conceptual overview particularly for first time learners, or non physics students who want to understand what QM is all about, without investing years of study. I\n\nThe book begins with simple and accessible language and increases in difficulty according to the theme, without ever losing clarity. In it, many scholars find new themes of mathematics and physics to be studied. The book together with the course that Professor Leonard Susskind and Stanford University make available for free on YouTube (in English) is enough to begin to understand the immensity of this theme that is applied to everything we use in our day to day, both in electronics as in medicine. Anyone who thinks that Quantum Mechanics is only theoretical is wrong. So, don't think twice, buy the book and watch the 10 classes of 2 hours each on YouTube for free and start understanding advanced books on the subject.\n\nI have been reading the book for quite a while now and totally impressed at how fluently the ideas are conveyed. It feels as if you are on journey along with the author while exploring the forest of quantum world. Totally worth giving a try. I am excited for the special and general relativity parts. Will order them once I finish this one"
