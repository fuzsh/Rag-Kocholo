        "text": "In the Shadow of the Greatest Generation: The Americans Who Fought the Korean War\n\nby Melinda L. Pash\n\nThe Nutshell:\n\nBetween exulting in World War II and deploring the Vietnam War, we tend to forget the Korean War and its veterans. Pash, a historian at Fayetteville Technical Community College, strives to give these forgotten soldiers their due, largely by recounting their own words about the everyday experiences of war.\n\nLiterary Lovechild Of:\n\nSebastian Junger’s War and David Halberstam’s The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War.\n\nYou'll Find It On Your Bookshelf If:\n\nYou feel bad that you’d always ask your uncle about his experiences in the Vietnam War, since he served in Korea.\n\nCocktail Party Fodder:\n\nIn August 1950, 65 percent of Americans were firmly behind the war effort in Korea; six months later, only 38 percent of Americans thought Korea was not a mistake.\n\nFor Optimal Benefit:\n\nAfter reading this book, watch the M*A*S*H complete collection—preferably with a less educated companion viewer, to whom you can point out the disparities between fact and fiction over the course of 36 DVDs.\n\nSnap Judgment:\n\nPash makes a strong case for how World War II shaped the lives and choices of Korean War veterans—and how they in turn foreshadowed the experience of those who fought in Vietnam—while honoring the unique struggles they faced.\n\nGive Me Everything You Have: On Being Stalked\n\nby James Lasdun\n\nThe Nutshell:\n\nLasdun, a novelist and poet, was cyber-stalked by a former creative writing student after he offered to help her sell her novel-in-progress. He recounts how easily a friendly, perhaps mildly flirtatious e-mail correspondence morphed into an ugly, anti-Semitic—and effective—online smear campaign that nearly became all-consuming.\n\nLiterary Lovechild Of:\n\nFrederick Exley’s A Fan’s Notes and Merri Lisa Johnson’s Girl in Need of a Tourniquet: Memoir of a Borderline Personality.\n\nYou'll Find It On Your Bookshelf If:\n\nYou’re stalking James Lasdun.\n\nCocktail Party Fodder:\n\nIt’s shockingly easy to send false e-mails using third-party websites; Lasdun’s stalker sent videos and articles from websites, appended with nasty messages, that purportedly came from people he knew.\n\nFor Optimal Benefit:\n\nDo not read if you are expecting a how-to on stopping a stalker (spoiler alert!): Lasdun’s stalker, at the time of publication, had not given up.\n\nSnap Judgment:\n\nLasdun weaves voluminous threads—literary, biographical, historical—through a very specific, chilling, personal story.\n\nThe Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics\n\nby Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky\n\nThe Nutshell:\n\nThe video recordings of Stanford University physicist Susskind’s basic physics class for the university’s continuing studies program for non-students became so popular that he turned them into a book with the help of citizen scientist Hrabovsky.\n\nLiterary Lovechild Of:\n\nRichard P. Feynman’s Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher and Robert L. Wolke’s What Einstein Didn’t Know: Scientific Answers to Everyday Questions.\n\nYou'll Find It On Your Bookshelf If:\n\nYou may not know how to pronounce “Gibbs-Liouville Theorem,” but you intend to hold forth on it anyway, and very soon.\n\nCocktail Party Fodder:\n\nMass is the quantitative measure of an object’s inertia.\n\nFor Optimal Benefit:\n\nRead before crashing a physics conference and trying to get lucky.\n\nSnap Judgment:\n\nIf you’re motivated to learn physics but without a lot of time on your hands—and if you’re one of those people who learn best by reading—The Theoretical Minimum is perfect for you. If you’re not so motivated, and if you learn better by doing or seeing, sign up for Susskind’s class.\n\nBy Sarah Rothbard. Editor: T.A. Frank."
