        "text": "Ive always enjoyed explaining physics. Forme its much more than teaching: Its a wayof thinking. Even when Im at my desk doingresearch, theres a dialog going on in myhead. Figuring out the best way to explainsomething is almost always the best way tounderstand it yourself.\n\nAbout ten years ago someone asked me if Iwould teach a course for the public. As ithappens, the Stanford area has a lot of peoplewho once wanted to study physics, but lifegot in the way. They had had all kinds ofcareers but never forgot their one-time infatuationwith the laws of the universe. Now, aftera career or two, they wanted to get backinto it, at least at a casual level.\n\nUnfortunately there was not much opportunityfor such folks to take courses. As a rule,Stanford and other universities dont allowoutsiders into classes, and, for most ofthese grown-ups, going back to school asa full-time student is not a realistic option.That bothered me. There ought to be a wayfor people to develop their interest by interactingwith active scientists, but there didntseem to be one.\n\nThats when I first found out about StanfordsContinuing Studies program. This programoffers courses for people in the local nonacademiccommunity. So I thought that it might justserve my purposes in finding someone to explainphysics to, as well as their purposes, andit might also be fun to teach a course onmodern physics. For one academic quarteranyhow.\n\nIt was fun. And it was very satisfying ina way that teaching undergraduate and graduatestudents was sometimes not. These studentswere there for only one reason: Not to getcredit, not to get a degree, and not to betested, but just to learn and indulge theircuriosity. Also, having been around theblock a few times, they were not at allafraid to ask questions, so the class hada lively vibrancy that academic classes oftenlack. I decided to do it again. And again.\n\nWhat became clear after a couple of quartersis that the students were not completelysatisfied with the laypersons courses Iwas teaching. They wanted more than the Scientific American experience. A lot of them had a bit of background,a bit of physics, a rusty but not dead knowledgeof calculus, and some experience at solvingtechnical problems. They were ready to trytheir hand at learning the real thingwithequations. The result was a sequence of coursesintended to bring these students to the forefrontof modern physics and cosmology.\n\nFortunately, someone (not I) had the brightidea to video-record the classes. They areout on the Internet, and it seems that theyare tremendously popular: Stanford is notthe only place with people hungry to learnphysics. From all over the world I get thousandsof e-mail messages. One of the main inquiriesis whether I will ever convert the lecturesinto books? The Theoretical Minimum is the answer.\n\nThe term theoretical minimum was not my owninvention. It originated with the great Russianphysicist Lev Landau. The TM in Russia meanteverything a student needed to know to workunder Landau himself. Landau was a very demandingman: His theoretical minimum meant just abouteverything he knew, which of course no oneelse could possibly know.\n\nI use the term differently. For me, the theoreticalminimum means just what you need to knowin order to proceed to the next level. Itmeans not fat encyclopedic textbooks thatexplain everything, but thin books that explaineverything important. The books closely followthe Internet courses that you will find onthe Web.\n\nWelcome, then, to The Theoretical MinimumClassical Mechanics, and good luck!\n\nLeonard Susskind\n\nStanford, California, July 2012\n\nI started to teach myself math and physicswhen I was eleven. That was forty years ago.A lot of things have happened since thenIam one of those individuals who got sidetrackedby life. Still, I have learned a lot of mathand physics. Despite the fact that peoplepay me to do research for them, I never pursueda degree.\n\nFor me, this book began with an e-mail. Afterwatching the lectures that form the basisfor the book, I wrote an e-mail to LeonardSusskind asking if he wanted to turn thelectures into a book. One thing led to another,and here we are.\n\nWe could not fit everything we wanted intothis book, or it wouldnt be The Theoretical MinimumClassical Mechanics, it would be A-Big-Fat-Mechanics-Book.That is what the Internet is for: Takingup large quantities of bandwidth to displaystuff that doesnt fit elsewhere! You canfind extra material at the website www.madscitech.org/tm. This material will include answers to theproblems, demonstrations, and additionalmaterial that we couldnt put in the book.\n\nI hope you enjoy reading this book as muchas we enjoyed writing it.\n\nGeorge Hrabovsky\n\nMadison, Wisconsin, July 2012"
