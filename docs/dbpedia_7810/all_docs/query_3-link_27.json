Edward Witten is an American theoretical physicist born in 1951. He is considered one of the leading physicists today and is known for his work in string theory, quantum gravity, and mathematical physics. Witten was the first physicist to win the Fields Medal, awarded in 1990 for his proof of the positive energy theorem in general relativity. In 1995, Witten introduced his idea of M-theory, which proposed that the five known superstring theories were different limits of a single underlying theory. Witten has also made significant contributions to quantum field theory, general relativity, topology, and the AdS/CFT correspondence relating quantum field theories and quantum gravity. He currently works at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.",
