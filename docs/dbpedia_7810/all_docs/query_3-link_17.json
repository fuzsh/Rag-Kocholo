Then they both naturalised. So after that came my husband.\n\nAs a surprise though.. and we want to know if he can claim NL citizenship after his parents both naturalised.\n\nBoth of his parents have passed away.\n\nWe want to know even though they naturalised if we can claim Dutch citizenship for him.\n\nMaybe through his grand parents?\n\nMy husband is born in 1969."
