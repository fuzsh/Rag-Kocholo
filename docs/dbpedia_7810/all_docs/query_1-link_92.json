Pdf versions of three of the video courses (taken and shared by some generous person) are available in the following links to download for free\n\nStatistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics,\n\nGeneral Relativity,\n\nCosmology.\n\nThere also exist three textbooks by Susskind based on these videos lectures (and I own all of them)\n\nClassical mechanics,\n\nQuantum Mechanics,\n\nSpecial Relativity and Classical theory of fields."
