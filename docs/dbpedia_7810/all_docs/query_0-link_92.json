        "text": "Leonard Szckind, born in 1940, is a Professor of Felix Bloch of Stanford Institute in Theoretical Physics and also the Independent of the Stanford University. His research interests include String_theory Quantum State theory, Quantum statistical mechanics and quantum cosmology. It is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Canadian Institute for Theoretical Physics (Canada's Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics). ) Is a collaborative member of the Faculty, and is a reputed lecturer of the Korea Institute for Advanced Study. [/ P]\n\nSaskind is widely regarded as the father of string theory, with Yoichiro Nambu and Holger Beck Nielsen being freely 'particle' in fact a seperate citrine Could be considered in the state of excitation of a relativistic string '. He spoke for the first time in 2003 to implement the idea of ​​string theory landscape. Sasiskand was awarded the J. J. Sakurai Award in 1998.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nLeonard Susskind was born in a Jewish family from the South Bronx section of the city of New York. She now lives in Palo Alto, California. At the age of 16, he started working as a plumber. Later, he joined the B.S graduate as an engineer student in New York City College. In 1965 he went to study at Cornell University under his Peter A. Carruthers for his Ph.d. Carrier\n\nSusskind was an assistant professor at the beginning, and after that she remained assistant manager at Yeshiva University in 1966-19 70. After that he went to Tel Aviv University for a year. Susskind returned to become a professor at Yeshiva University (1970-19 79). Since 1979 he is a professor of physics at Stanford University and since 1979, Felix Bloch has been working as a professor of physics.\n\nसस्किंड अपने सिट्रंग माडल (Stirng Model), लैटिस गेज थ्योरी (lattice guage theory) क्वांटम क्रोमोद्य्नामिक (Quantum Chromodynamic) और डायनैमिकल सिमिट्री ब्रेकिंग (dynamical symmetry breaking) में अग्रणी योगदान के लिए १९९८ में जे जे सकुराए (J.J. Sakurai) पुरस्कार से सम्मानित किया गया था। २००७ में सस्किंड एक सहयोगी सदस्य के रूप में, वाटरलू, ओंटारियो, कनाडा(Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) में सैद्धांतिक भौतिकी के परिधि संस्थान (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics) के संकाय में शामिल हो गए। उन्हें नेशनल एकेडमी ऑफ साइंसेज ( National Academy of Sciences) और कला और विज्ञान के अमेरिकन अकादमी (American Academy of Arts and Sciences) के लिए भी चुना गया है। वे कोरिया संस्थान (Korea Institute for Advanced Study) में एक प्रतिषिठत प्रोफेसर भी है।\n\nसैद्धांतिक न्यून्तम व्याख्यान श्रृंखला (The theoretical Minimum Lecture Series)\n\nSchmidt teaches a series of study courses to continue Stanford about modern physics in the form of theoretical minimalism. The aim of the courses is to teach the necessary basic but rigorous theoretical foundations to study some areas of physics. Classical Mechanics, Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Cosmology were included, including the physics of the Black Hole. Scientific career\n\nSusskind was one of those three physics who discovered that the Veneziano dual, resonance mode, and strong interactions were called quantum mechanical model of strings. Can be explained by He was the first person to have thought of string theory.\n\nSusskind contributed to these areas of physics -\n\n1.कण भौतिकी के स्ट्रिंग सिद्धांत मॉडल की स्वतंत्र खोज (The independent discovery of the string theory model of particle physics)\n\n2.क्वार्क कॉन्फिनेमेंट प्रसूति के सिद्धांत (The theory of quark confinement)\n\n3.हमिल्टोनिअन लैटिस गेज सिद्धांत के विकास (The development of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory)\n\n4.डीप इनेलास्टिक एलेक्ट्रोप्रोडक्शन में स्केलिंग वायोलेशन का सिद्धांत (The theory of scaling violations in deep inelastic electroproduction)\n\n5.ब्लैक होल पूरकता के स्ट्रिंग सिद्धांत (String theory of black hole entropy)\n\n6.कॉजल पैच परिकल्पना (The causal patch hypothesis)\n\n7.होलोग्राफिक सिद्धांत (The holographic principle)\n\n8.सेन्सस टेकर हैट (The Census Taker's Hat)\n\nस्मोलिन-सस्किंड विवाद(Smolin–Susskind debate)\n\nThere is a dispute between the two prominent scientists of the world in two thousand four years. This controversy between Smolin and Leonard Susskind can not be mistaken for Anthropic Principle of this plea of ​​Smolin, and this is why it is not suitable to be part of science. This dispute began with the publication of Smolin on July 26, 2014. Smolin emailed Suskind to request some suggestions. Saskint, who had not had this publication, demanded the interpretation of publication from Smolin. Smolin interpreted his arguments to Susskind On July 28, 2004, Susskind responded by saying that the arguments of Smolin can give ridiculous conclusions. On the next day Smolin gave this statement that if an important part of our colleagues can not hesitate to adopt a theory that can not be wrong, then the progress of science will stop and such wrong doctrines which have never been proved wrong. Can go, dominate science. A few days after this incident, Saskind made some comments on Smolin's theory in one of his publications. After all, the Smolin Saskin dispute ends in this agreement, one will write a letter which will be published in Edge, in which they will have to follow the three conditions: -\n\n1. No one will write more than one letter.\n\n2. Nobody else will read the letter before publishing."
