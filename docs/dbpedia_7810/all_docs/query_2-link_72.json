        "text": "This is the ultimate master class in modern physics. World-class physicist and father of string theory Leonard Susskind and citizen-scientist George Hrabovsky combine forces in a primer that teaches the skills you need to do physics yourself. Combining crystal-clear explanations of the laws of the universe with basic exercises (including essential equations and maths), the authors cover the minimum that readers should master. They introduce the key concepts of modern physics, from classical mechanics to general relativity to quantum theory, and provide a practical toolkit that you won't find in any other popular science book.. NOTA: El libro no está en español, sino en inglés.\n\nLeonard Susskind has been the Felix Bloch Professor in Theoretical Physics at Stanford University since 1978. The author of The Black Hole War and The Cosmic Landscape, he lives in Palo Alto, California. He is widely considered to be one of the fathers of string theory.\n\nGeorge Hrabovsky is the president of Madison Area Science and Technology (MAST), a nonprofit organization dedicated to scientific and technological research and education. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin."
