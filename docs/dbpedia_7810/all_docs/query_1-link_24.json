        "text": "British legal scholar and consultant (born 1961)\n\nFor the children's author, see Richard Suskind.\n\nRichard Eric Susskind[1] OBE FRSE (born 28 March 1961) is a British author, speaker, and independent adviser to international professional firms and national governments. He is the IT adviser to the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, holds professorships at the University of Oxford,[2] Gresham College[3] and Strathclyde University,[4] is a past chair of the Advisory Panel on Public Sector Information, and is the president of the Society for Computers and Law.\n\nSusskind has specialised in legal technology since the early 1980s, has authored nine books and is a regular columnist at The Times.[5] Susskind has more recently[when?] furthered his research to cover the professions more generally and his latest book, co-authored with Daniel Susskind, his son,[6] predicts the decline of today's professions and describes the people and systems that will replace them. They argue that the current professions are antiquated and no longer affordable and explain how 'increasingly capable systems' will fundamentally change the way that professional expertise is shared. They propose six models for producing and distributing expertise in society.[7]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe son of Dr Werner Susskind and Shirley Susskind, he was educated at the University of Glasgow and took his doctorate from Balliol College, Oxford.[8][9]\n\nOnline dispute resolution\n\n[edit]\n\nSusskind chairs the UK Civil Justice Council's Advisory Group for online dispute resolution, which published a report in February 2015 recommending the establishment of Her Majesty's Online Courts (HMOC). The report recommends HMOC consist of three tiers: online evaluation, online facilitation and online judges. According to the report, the benefits of HMOC would be an increase in access to justice and substantial savings in the cost of the court system.[10]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\n1992 – Honorary member, Society for Computers and Law\n\n2000 – OBE, for services to IT in the Law and to the Administration of Justice\n\n2001 – Honorary fellow of law faculty, Durham University\n\n2005 – Honorary professor, Gresham College, London\n\nFellowships\n\n[edit]\n\n1992 – Fellow, Royal Society of Arts\n\n1997 – Fellow, Royal Society of Edinburgh\n\n1997 – Fellow, the British Computer Society\n\nFamily\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1985, Susskind married Michelle Latter.[8] They have three children: Daniel, Jamie and Alexandra.[11] Daniel Susskind, his co-author of The Future of the Professions, is an economics lecturer at Balliol College, Oxford; Jamie Susskind is a barrister and the author of Future Politics and The Digital Republic, which also examine the future of technology.[12][13][14]\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nExpert Systems in Law (Oxford University Press, 1987; paperback, 1989)\n\nLatent Damage Law – The Expert System (Butterworths, 1988) (with P.N.
