The official currency in Montenegro is the euro- abbreviated to EUR. 1 Euro is subdivided into 100 cents.

From 1996, the Deutsche Mark was used in Montenegro as the de facto currency and was formally adopted as Montenegro’s currency in 1999.

The euro replaced the Deutsche Mark as Montenegro’s official currency in 2002 with no objections from the European Central Bank.

The most commonly-used bills for the euro are the 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 notes.
