The Republic of Montenegro (1992-2006) was a constituent republic of Yugoslavia. After the break-up of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, Montenegro entered into a new federation with Serbia called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003 the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro had changed and the federation was replaced by a looser confederation called the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, until Montenegro finally withdrew in 2006 and became a sovereign state in its own right.
