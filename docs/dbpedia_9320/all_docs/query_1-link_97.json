        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackgroundThe Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in 1918; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 was resisted by various paramilitary bands that fought each other as well as the invaders. The group headed by Josip TITO took full control of Yugoslavia upon German expulsion in 1945. Although Communist, his new government and its successors (he died in 1980) managed to steer their own path between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half decades. In the early 1990s, post-TITO Yugoslavia began to unravel along ethnic lines: Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina were recognized as independent states in 1992. The remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" (FRY) in April 1992 and, under President Slobodan MILOSEVIC, Serbia led various military intervention efforts to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a \"Greater Serbia.\" These actions led to Yugoslavia being ousted from the UN in 1992, but Serbia continued its campaign until signing the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. In 1998-99, massive expulsions by FRY forces and Serb paramilitaries of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo provoked an international response, including the NATO bombing of Belgrade and the stationing of a NATO-led force (KFOR), in Kosovo. Federal elections in the fall of 2000, brought about the ouster of MILOSEVIC and installed Vojislav KOSTUNICA as president. The arrest of MILOSEVIC in 2001 allowed for his subsequent transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to be tried for crimes against humanity. In 2001, the country's suspension from the UN was lifted, and it was once more accepted into UN organizations under the name of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo has been governed by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) since June 1999, under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, pending a determination by the international community of its future status. In 2002, the Serbian and Montenegrin components of Yugoslavia began negotiations to forge a looser relationship. In February 2003 lawmakers restructured the country into a loose federation of two republics called Serbia and Montenegro. The Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro includes a provision that allows either republic to hold a referendum after three years that would allow for their independence from the state union. In 2003 Svetozar MAROVIC was elected president of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nGeography\n\nLocationSoutheastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea, between Albania and Bosnia and HerzegovinaGeographic coordinates44 00 N, 21 00 EMap referencesEuropeAreatotal: 102,350 sq km\n\nland: 102,136 sq km\n\nwater: 214 sq kmArea - comparativeslightly smaller than KentuckyLand boundariestotal: 2,246 km\n\nborder countries: Albania 287 km, Bosnia and Herzegovina 527 km, Bulgaria 318 km, Croatia (north) 241 km, Croatia (south) 25 km, Hungary 151 km, Macedonia 221 km, Romania 476 kmCoastline199 kmMaritime claimsNAClimatein the north, continental climate (cold winters and hot, humid summers with well distributed rainfall);

After the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in October 2000, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition government implemented stabilization measures and embarked on an aggressive market reform program. After renewing its membership in the IMF in December 2000, a down-sized Yugoslavia continued to reintegrate into the international community by rejoining the World Bank (IBRD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). A World Bank-European Commission sponsored Donors' Conference held in June 2001 raised $1.3 billion for economic restructuring. An agreement rescheduling the country's $4.5 billion Paris Club government debts was concluded in November 2001 - it wrote off 66% of the debt - and the London Club of private creditors forgave $1.7 billion of debt, just over half the total owed, in July 2004. The smaller republic of Montenegro severed its economy from federal control and from Serbia during the MILOSEVIC era and continues to maintain its own central bank, uses the euro instead of the Yugoslav dinar as official currency, collects customs tariffs, and manages its own budget. Kosovo's economy continues to transition to a market-based system, and is largely dependent on the international community and the diaspora for financial and technical assistance. The euro and the Yugoslav dinar are both accepted currencies in Kosovo. While maintaining ultimate oversight, UNMIK continues to work with the EU and Kosovo's local provisional government to accelerate economic growth, lower unemployment, and attract foreign investment to help Kosovo integrate into regional economic structures. The complexity of Serbia and Montenegro political relationships, slow progress in privatization, legal uncertainty over property rights, scarcity of foreign-investment, and a substantial foreign trade deficit are holding back the economy. Arrangements with the IMF, especially requirements for fiscal discipline, are an important element in policy formation. Severe unemployment remains a key political and economic problem for this entire region.GDP (purchasing power parity)$28.7 billion (2005 est.)GDP (official exchange rate)$25.07 billion (2005 est.)GDP - real growth rate5% (2005 est.)GDP - per capita (PPP)$2,700 (2005 est.)GDP - composition by sectoragriculture: 16.6%\n\nindustry: 25.5%\n\nservices: 57.9% (2005 est.)Population below poverty line30% (1999 est.)Household income or consumption by percentage sharelowest 10%: NA%\n\nhighest 10%: NA%Inflation rate (consumer prices)15.5% (2005 est.)Labor force3.22 million (2005 est.)Labor force - by occupationagriculture NA%, industry NA%, services NA%Unemployment rate31.6%; note - unemployment is approximately 50% in Kosovo (2005 est.)Budgetrevenues: $11.45 billion\n\nexpenditures: $11.12 billion; including capital expenditures of $NA (2005 est.)Industriesmachine building (aircraft, trucks, and automobiles; tanks and weapons; electrical equipment; agricultural machinery); metallurgy (steel, aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, chromium, antimony, bismuth, cadmium); mining (coal, bauxite, nonferrous ore, iron ore, limestone); consumer goods (textiles, footwear, foodstuffs, appliances); electronics, petroleum products, chemicals, and pharmaceuticalsIndustrial production growth rate1.7% (2002 est.)Electricity - production36.04 billion kWh (2003)Electricity - consumption36.62 billion kWh (2003)Electricity - exports400 million kWh (2003)Electricity - imports3.5 billion kWh (2003)Oil - production14,660 bbl/day (2003)Oil - consumption85,000 bbl/day (2003 est.)Oil - exportsNA bbl/dayOil - importsNA bbl/dayOil - proved reserves38.75 million bbl (1 January 2002)Natural gas - production650 million cu m (2003 est.)Natural gas - consumption2.55 billion cu m (2003 est.)Natural gas - exports0 cu m (2001 est.)Natural gas - imports0 cu m (2001 est.)Natural gas - proved reserves48.14 billion cu m (1 January 2002)Agriculture - productscereals, fruits, vegetables, tobacco, olives; cattle, sheep, goatsExports$5.485 billion f.o.b.
