        "text": "The former Yugoslav republic of Montenegro will need to make a bigger effort to meet the criteria to join the European Union, as it no longer has the flexibility of using its own currency, European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said.\n\n“Having the euro as a currency in a sense puts the bar even higher in terms of sustainable convergence,” Coeure said in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica on Monday. “If you don’t have your own currency any more, you’ve got to be even more serious in terms of reducing external imbalances, in terms of achieving fiscal sustainability.”"
