        "text": "Convention between the Federal Republic of Germanyand the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to taxes on income and capital and to certain other taxes\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America,\n\nDesiring to conclude a new Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital and to certain other taxes,\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\nArticle 1: General Scope\n\n1. This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States, except as otherwise provided in this Convention.\n\n2. This Convention shall not restrict in any manner any exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit, or other allowance now or hereafter accorded: a) by the laws of either Contracting State; or b) by any other agreement to which the Contracting States are party.\n\n3. a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph b) of paragraph 2: aa) the Contracting States agree that any question arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention and, in particular, whether a taxation measure is within the scope of the Convention, shall be determined exclusively in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the Convention; and bb) the provisions of any other agreement shall not apply to a taxation measure unless the competent authorities agree that the measure is not within the scope of Article 24 (Non-discrimination) of this Convention. b) For the purposes of this paragraph, a “measure” is a law, regulation, rule, procedure, decision, administrative action, or any similar provision or action.\n\n4. a) Except to the extent provided in paragraph 5, this Convention shall not affect the taxation by the United States of its residents (as determined under Article 4 (Residence)) and its citizens. b) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a former citizen or long-term resident of the United States may, for the period of ten years following the loss of such status, be taxed in accordance with the laws of the United States.\n\n5. The provisions of paragraph 4 shall not affect the benefits conferred by the United States: a) under paragraph 2 of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), paragraph 6 of Article 13 (Gains), paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Article 18 (Pensions, Annuities, Alimony, Child Support, and Social Security), paragraph 1 and 5 of Article 18A (Pension Plans), paragraph 3 of Article 19 (Government Service), and under Articles 23 (Relief from Double Taxation), 24 (Non-discrimination), and 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure); and b) under paragraph 2 of Article18A (Pension Plans), subparagraph b) of paragraph 1 of Article 19 (Government Service), and under Articles 20 (Visiting Professors and Teachers; Students and Trainees) and 30 (Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts), upon individuals who are neither citizens of, nor have immigrant status in, the United States.\n\n6. Nothing in the Convention shall be construed to prevent the Federal Republic of Germany from imposing its taxes on amounts included in the income of a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany according to part 4, 5, and 7 of the German “Außensteuergesetz”. Where such imposition of tax gives rise to double taxation, the competent authorities shall consult for the elimination of such double taxation according to paragraph 3 of Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure).\n\n7. In the case of an item of income, profit or gain derived by or through a person that is fiscally transparent under the laws of either Contracting State, such item shall be considered to be derived by a resident of a State to the extent that the item is treated for the purposes of the taxation law of such State as the income, profit or gain of a resident.\n\nProtocol Article 1\n\n1. With reference to subparagraph b) of paragraph 4 of Article 1 (General Scope): The term “long-term resident” shall mean any individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States in eight or more taxable years during the preceding 15 taxable years. In determining whether the threshold in the preceding sentence is met, an individual shall not be treated as a lawful permanent resident of the United States for any taxable year in which such individual is treated as a resident of a country other than the United States under the provisions of a tax treaty of the United States and the individual does not waive the benefits of such treaty provided by the United States to a resident of the other country. Consequently, if during each of the 15 taxable years preceding the loss of his status as a lawful permanent resident an individual was a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany (as determined under Article 4 (Residence)) and claimed the benefits provided by the United States to a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany, the individual shall not be considered a long-term resident.\n\nArticle 2: Taxes Covered\n\n1. The existing taxes to which this Convention shall apply are: a) In the United States: aa) the federal income taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (but excluding the accumulated earnings tax, the personal holding company tax, and social security taxes); and bb) the excise tax imposed on insurance premiums paid to foreign insurers (hereinafter referred to as “United States tax”).\n\nThis Convention shall, however, apply to the excise tax imposed on insurance premiums paid to foreign insurers only to the extent that the risks covered by such premiums are not reinsured with a person not entitled to the benefits of this or any other convention that provides exemption from such tax. b) In the Federal Republic of Germany: aa) the income tax (Einkommensteuer); bb) the corporation tax (Körperschaftsteuer); cc) the trade tax (Gewerbesteuer); and dd) the capital tax (Vermögensteuer) (hereinafter referred to as “German tax”).\n\n2. This Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of this Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws.\n\nArticle 3: General Definitions\n\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires: a) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean the United States or the Federal Republic of Germany as the context requires; b) the term “United States”, when used in a geographical sense, means the United States of America, but does not include Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or any other possession or territory of the United States of America; c) the term “Federal Republic of Germany”, when used in a geographical sense, means the area in which the tax law of the Federal Republic of Germany is in force; d) the term “person” includes but is not limited to an individual and a company; e) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; f) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; g) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in one of the Contracting States; h) the term “national” means: aa) in respect of the United States, United States citizens and any legal person, partnership, or association deriving its status as such from the law in force in the United States; and bb) in respect of the Federal Republic of Germany, any German within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 116 of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany and any legal person, partnership, or association deriving its status as such from the law in force in the Federal Republic of Germany; and i) the term “competent authority” means: aa) in the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate; and bb) in the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Minister of Finance or his delegate.\n\n2. As regards the application of this Convention by a Contracting State any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the competent authorities agree to a common meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure), have the meaning that it has under the laws of that State concerning the taxes to which this Convention applies.\n\nArticle 4: Residence\n\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management, place of incorporation, or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. The term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or of profits attributable to a permanent establishment in that State or capital situated therein.\n\n2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: a) he shall be deemed to by a resident of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (center of vital interests); b) if the State in which he has his center of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has an habitual abode; c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of which he is a national; and d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.\n\n3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall seek to determine through consultation the Contracting State of which the person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of this Convention, and, if they are unable so to determine, such person shall not be considered to be a resident of either Contracting State for purposes of enjoying benefits under this Convention.\n\nProtocol Article 4\n\n2. With reference to paragraph 1 of Article 4 (Residence) a) The Federal Republic of Germany shall treat a United States citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (a “green card” holder) as a resident of the United States only if such person has a substantial presence, permanent home, or habitual abode in the United States. b) It is understood that a German Investment Fund and a German Investmentaktiengesellschaft (collectively referred to as Investmentvermögen) to which the provisions of the Investment Act (Investmentgesetz) apply are residents of the Federal Republic of Germany and that a U.S. Regulated Investment Company (RIC) and a U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) are residents of the United States.\n\nArticle 5: Permanent Establishment\n\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.\n\n2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially: a) a place of management; b) a branch; c) an office; d) a factory; e) a workshop; and f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.\n\n3. A building site or a construction, assembly or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than twelve months.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery; c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise; e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of advertising, of the supply of information, of scientific activities, or of similar activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character for the enterprise; or f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of preparatory or auxiliary character.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person (other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies) is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 that, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.\n\n6. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent, or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.\n\n7. The fact that a company that is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State, or that carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.\n\nProtocol Article 5\n\n3. With reference to Article 5 (Permanent Establishment): A resident of a Contracting State that performs in the other Contracting State concerts, theatrical or artistic performances, or similar shows and revues and that may not be taxed in that other State under the provisions of Article 17 (Artistes and Athletes) shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State if its presence does not exceed in the aggregate 183 days in the calendar year concerned.\n\nArticle 6: Income From Immovable (Real) Property\n\n1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable (real) property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning that it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property; livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry; rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply; usufruct of immovable property; and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources, and other natural resources. Ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.\n\n4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.\n\nArticle 7: Business Profits\n\n1. The business profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.\n\n2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the business profits that it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.\n\n3. In determining the business profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses that are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.\n\n4. No business profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.\n\n5. For the purposes of this Convention, the business profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall include only the profits derived from the assets or activities of the permanent establishment.\n\n6. Where business profits include items of income that are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.\n\n7. For the purposes of this Convention the term “business profits” includes income derived from the rental of tangible personal property and the rental or licensing of cinematographic films or works on film, tape, or other means of reproduction for use in radio or television broadcasting and income from the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character.\n\nProtocol Article 7\n\n4. With reference to Article 7 (Business Profits): It is understood that the business profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment shall include only the profits derived from the assets used, risks assumed, and activities performed by the permanent establishment. The principles of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines will apply for purposes of determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment, taking into account the different economic and legal circumstances of a single entity. Accordingly, any of the methods described therein as acceptable methods for determining an arm’s-length result may be used to determine the income of a permanent establishment so long as those methods are applied in accordance with the Guidelines. In particular, in determining the amount of attributable profits, the permanent establishment shall be treated as having the same amount of capital that it would need to support its activities if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities. With respect to financial institutions other than insurance companies, a Contracting State may determine the amount of capital to be attributed to a permanent establishment by allocating the institution's total equity between its various offices on the basis of the proportion of the financial institution's risk-weighted assets attributable to each of them. A financial institution may determine the amount of the capital attributed to its permanent establishment using its risk weighted assets only if it risk weights its assets in the ordinary course of its business.\n\n5. With reference to paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 7 (Business Profits) and paragraph 3 of Article 13 (Gains): For the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7 and paragraph 3 of Article 13 any income, gain, or expense attributable to a permanent establishment is taxable or deductible in the Contracting State where such permanent establishment is situated even if the payments are deferred until such permanent establishment ceases to exist. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall prevent the application to such deferred payments of rules regarding the accrual of income and expenses according to the domestic law of a Contracting State.\n\n6. With reference to Article 7 (Business Profits) and Article 13 (Gains): Gains from the alienation of movable property that at any time formed part of the business property of a permanent establishment that a resident of one Contracting State has or had in the other Contracting State may be taxed by that other State only to the extent of the gain that accrued during that time. Notwithstanding any provision of Article 7 or Article 13, such tax may be imposed on such gains at the time when realized and recognized under the laws of that other State, if it is within ten years of the date on which the property ceases to be part of the business property of the permanent establishment (or such shorter period provided by the laws of either Contracting State).\n\nArticle 8: Shipping and Air Transport\n\n1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n2. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the use or rental of containers (including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the transport of containers) used in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business, or an international operating agency.\n\nArticle 9: Associated Enterprises\n\n1. Where a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control, or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control, or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations that differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.\n\n2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State, and taxes accordingly, profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State, and that other Contracting State agrees that profits so included are profits that would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those that would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be paid to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities or the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.\n\nProtocol Article 9\n\n7. With reference to Article 9 (Associated Enterprises): Either State may apply the rules of its national law that permit the distribution, apportionment, or allocation of income, deductions, credits, or allowances between related persons with a view to apportioning or allocating such deductions, credits, or allowances in accordance with the general principles of paragraph 1 of Article 9. Article 9 shall not be construed to limit either Contracting State in allocating income between persons that are related other than by direct or indirect participation within the meaning of paragraph 1, such as by commercial or contractual relationships resulting in controlling influence, so long as such allocation is otherwise in accordance with the general principles of paragraph 1 of Article 9.\n\nArticle 10: Dividends\n\n1. Dividends paid by a company that is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the dividends are derived and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that owns directly at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the company paying the dividends; b) 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, such dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner is: a) a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned directly shares representing 80 percent or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividends for a 12-month period ending on the date entitlement to the dividend is determined and: aa) satisfies the conditions of clause aa) or bb) of subparagraph c) of paragraph 2 of Article 28 (Limitation on Benefits); bb) satisfies the conditions of clauses aa) and bb) of subparagraph f) of paragraph 2 of Article 28, provided that the company satisfies the conditions described in paragraph 4 of Article 28 with respect to the dividends; cc) is entitled to benefits with respect to the dividends under paragraph 3 of Article 28; or dd) has received a determination pursuant to paragraph 7 of Article 28 with respect to this paragraph; or b) a pension fund that is a resident of the other Contracting State, provided that such dividends are not derived from the carrying on of a business, directly or indirectly, by such pension fund.\n\n4. Subparagraph a) of paragraph 2 and subparagraph a) of paragraph 3 shall not apply in the case of dividends paid by a United States person that is a U.S. Regulated Investment Company (RIC), a United States person that is a U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) or a German Investment Fund or a German Investmentaktiengesellschaft (collectively referred to as Investmentvermögen). In the case of dividends paid by a RIC or an Investmentvermögen, subparagraph b) of paragraph 2 and subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 shall apply. In the case of dividends paid by a REIT subparagraph b) of paragraph 2 and subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 shall apply only if: a) the beneficial owner of the dividends is an individual or a pension fund, in either case holding an interest of not more than 10 percent in the REIT; b) the dividends are paid with respect to a class of stock that is publicly traded and the beneficial owner of the dividends is a person holding an interest of not more than 5 percent of any class of the REIT’s stock; or c) the beneficial owner of the dividends is a person holding an interest of not more than 10 percent in the REIT and the REIT is diversified.\n\nFor purposes of this paragraph a REIT shall be diversified if no single interest in real property exceeds 10 percent of its total interests in real property. For the purposes of this paragraph foreclosure property shall not be an interest in real property. Where a REIT holds an interest in a partnership, it shall be treated as owning directly a proportion of the partnership’s interests in real property corresponding to its interest in the partnership.\n\n5. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, founders' shares, or other rights (not being debt-claims) participating in profits, as well as other income from other rights that is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. The term “dividends” also includes in the Federal Republic of Germany income under a sleeping partnership (Stille Gesellschaft), a participating loan (partiarisches Darlehen), or “Gewinnobligation”, as well as distributions on certificates of a German Investmentvermögen.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph 2 of this Article, paragraph 3 of this Article and paragraph 1 of Article 11 (Interest), income from arrangements carrying the right to participate in profits (including in the Federal Republic of Germany income under a sleeping partnership (Stille Gesellschaft), a participating loan (partiarisches Darlehen), or “Gewinnobligation”, or “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights and in the United States contingent interest of a type that would not qualify as portfolio interest) that is deductible in determining the profits of the payor may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises according to the laws of that State.\n\n7. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid forms part of the business property of such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) shall apply.\n\n8. A Contracting State may not impose any tax on dividends paid by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid forms part of the business property of a permanent establishment situated in that State, nor may it impose tax on a company’s undistributed profits except as provided in paragraph 9 of this Article, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that State.\n\n9. A company that is a resident of a Contracting State and that has a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State, or that is subject to tax on a net basis in that other Contracting State on items of income that may be taxed in that other State under Article 6 (Income from Immovable (Real) Property) or under paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Gains), may be subject in that other Contracting State to a tax in addition to the tax allowable under the other provisions of this Convention. Such tax, however, may be imposed only on: a) the portion of the business profits of the company attributable to the permanent establishment, and b) the portion of the income referred to in the preceding sentence that is subject to tax under Article 6 or paragraph 1 of Article 13, that represents the “dividend equivalent amount” of those profits and income; the term “dividend equivalent amount” shall, for the purposes of this subparagraph, aa) in the case of the United States, have the meaning that it has under the law of the United States as it may be amended from time to time without changing the general principle thereof; and bb) in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany, be that portion of the income described in subparagraph a) that is comparable to the amount that would be distributed as a dividend by a locally incorporated subsidiary.\n\n10. The tax referred to in subparagraphs a) and b) of paragraph 9 of this Article shall not be imposed at a rate exceeding the rate specified in subparagraph a) of paragraph 2. In any case, it shall not be imposed on a company that: a) satisfies the conditions of clause aa) or bb) of subparagraph c) of paragraph 2 of Article 28 (Limitation on Benefits); b) satisfies the conditions of clauses aa) and bb) of subparagraph f) of paragraph 2 of Article 28, provided that the company satisfies the conditions described in paragraph 4 of that Article with respect to an item of income, profit or gain described in paragraph 9 of this Article; c) is entitled under paragraph 3 of Article 28 to benefits with respect to an item of income, profit or gain described in paragraph 9 of this Article; or d) has received a determination pursuant to paragraph 7 of Article 28 with respect to this paragraph.\n\n11.

With reference to paragraph 1 of Article 23 (Relief from Double Taxation): For purposes of paragraph 1 of Article 23, the “general principle hereof” means the avoidance of double taxation by allowing a credit for taxes imposed on items of income arising in the Federal Republic of Germany, as determined under the applicable United States source rules, as modified by the Convention. While the details and limitations of the credit pursuant to this paragraph may change as provisions of United States law change, any such changes must preserve a credit for German taxes imposed with respect to items of income that the Federal Republic of Germany may tax pursuant to the Convention.\n\nArticle 24: Non-Discrimination\n\n1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith that is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or nay be subjected. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, this provision shall also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.\n\n2. The taxation on a permanent establishment that an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favorably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs, and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities that it grants to its own residents.\n\n3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), paragraph 4 of Article 11 (Interest), or paragraph 4 of Article 12 (Royalties) apply, interest, royalties, and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for purposes of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for purposes of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.\n\n4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith that is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.\n\n5. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Contracting State from imposing the tax described in paragraph 8 of Article 10 (Dividends).\n\n6. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 (Taxes Covered), apply to taxes of every kind and description imposed by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof.\n\nProtocol Article 24\n\n20. With reference to paragraph 1 of Article 24 (Non-discrimination): Paragraph 1 of Article 24 does not obligate the United States to subject an individual who is a German national not resident in the United States to the same taxing regime as that applied to a citizen of the United States not resident in the United States.\n\n21. With reference to paragraph 4 of Article 24 (Non-discrimination): It is understood that paragraph 4 of Article 24 shall not be construed as obligating a Contracting State to permit cross-border consolidation of income or similar benefits between enterprises.\n\nArticle 25: Mutual Agreement Procedure\n\n1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24 (Non-discrimination), to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within four years from the notification of the assessment giving rise to double taxation or to taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.\n\n2. The competent authority shall endeavor, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any tine limits or other procedural limitations in the domestic law of the Contracting States.\n\n3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavor to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. In particular the competent authorities of the Contracting States may agree a) to the same attribution of income, deductions, credits, or allowances of an enterprise of a Contracting State to its permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State; b) to the same allocation of income, deductions, credits, or allowances between associated enterprises and other persons in accordance with the principles of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises); c) to the settlement of conflicting application of this Convention, including conflicts regarding aa) the characterization of particular items of income; bb) the characterization of persons; cc) the application of source rules with respect to particular items of income, and dd) to the treatment of income that is assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the State of source and that is treated as a different class of income in the other State; d) to a common meaning of a term; e) to the application of the procedural provisions of domestic law including those regarding penalties, fines, and interest, in a manner consistent with the purposes of this Convention; and f) to increase the amounts referred to in Articles 17 (Artistes and Athletes) and 20 (Visiting Professors and Teachers; Students and Trainees) to reflect economic or monetary developments.They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Convention.\n\n4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for purposes of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. Where the procedure relates to a particular case, the persons concerned shall be permitted to present their views to the competent authority of either or both of the Contracting States. When it seems advisable in order to reach agreement to have an oral exchange of opinions, such exchange may take place through a Commission consisting of representatives of the competent authorities of the Contracting States.\n\n5. Where, pursuant to a mutual agreement procedure under this Article, the competent authorities have endeavored but are unable to reach a complete agreement in a case, the case shall be resolved through arbitration conducted in the manner prescribed by, and subject to, the requirements of paragraph 6 and any rules or procedures agreed upon by the Contracting States, if:\n\na) tax returns have been filed with at least one of the Contracting States with respect to the taxable years at issue in the case; b) the case aa) is a case that A) involves the application of one or more Articles that the Contracting States have agreed shall be the subject of arbitration, and B) is not a particular case that the competent authorities agree, before the date on which arbitration proceedings would otherwise have begun, is not suitable for determination by arbitration, or bb) is a particular case that the competent authorities agree is suitable for determination by arbitration; and c) all concerned persons agree according to the provisions of subparagraph d) of paragraph 6.\n\n6. For the purposes of paragraph 5 and this paragraph, the following rules and definitions shall apply: a) The term “concerned person” means the presenter of a case to a competent authority for consideration under this Article and all other persons, if any, whose tax liability to either Contracting State may be directly affected by a mutual agreement arising from that consideration; b) The “commencement date” for a case is the earliest date on which the information necessary to undertake substantive consideration for a mutual agreement has been received by both competent authorities; c) Arbitration proceedings in a case shall begin on the later of: aa) Two years after the commencement date of that case, unless both competent authorities have previously agreed to a different date, and bb) The earliest date upon which the agreement required by subparagraph d) has been received by both competent authorities; d) The concerned person(s), and their authorized representatives or agents, must agree prior to the beginning of arbitration proceedings not to disclose to any other person any information received during the course of the arbitration proceeding from either Contracting State or the arbitration board, other than the determination of such board; e) Unless any concerned person does not accept the determination of an arbitration board, the determination shall constitute a resolution by mutual agreement under this Article and shall be binding on both Contracting States with respect to that case; and f) For purposes of an arbitration proceeding under paragraph 5 and this paragraph, the members of the arbitration board and their staffs shall be considered “persons or authorities” to whom information may be disclosed under Article 26 (Exchange of Information and Administrative Assistance) of the Convention.\n\nProtocol Article 25\n\n22. With reference to paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure): In respect of any case where the competent authorities have endeavored but are unable to reach an agreement under Article 25 regarding the application of one or more of the following Articles of the Convention: 4 (Residence) (but only insofar as it relates to the residence of a natural person), 5 (Permanent Establishment), 7 (Business Profits), 9 (Associated Enterprises), 12 (Royalties), binding arbitration shall be used to determine such application, unless the competent authorities agree that the particular case is not suitable for determination by arbitration. In addition, the competent authorities may, on an ad hoc basis, agree that binding arbitration shall be used in respect of any other matter to which Article 25 applies. If an arbitration proceeding (the Proceeding) under paragraph 5 of Article 25 commences, the following rules and procedures will apply:\n\na) The Proceeding will be conducted in the manner prescribed by, and subject to the requirements of, paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 25 and these rules and procedures, as modified or supplemented by any other rules and procedures agreed upon by the competent authorities pursuant to subparagraph q) below.\n\nb) The determination reached by an arbitration board in the Proceeding shall be limited to a determination regarding the amount of income, expense or tax reportable to the Contracting States.\n\nc) Notwithstanding the initiation of the Proceeding, the competent authorities may reach a mutual agreement to resolve a case and terminate the Proceeding. Correspondingly, a concerned person may withdraw a request for the competent authorities to engage in the Mutual Agreement Procedure (and thereby terminate the Proceeding) at any time.\n\nd) The requirements of subparagraph d) of paragraph 6 of Article 25 will be met when the competent authorities have each received from each concerned person a statement agreeing that the concerned person and each person acting on the concerned person’s behalf will not disclose to any other person any information received during the course of the Proceeding from either Contracting State or the Arbitration Board, other than the determination of the Proceeding. A concerned person that has the legal authority to bind any other concerned person(s) on this matter may do so in a comprehensive statement.\n\ne) Each Contracting State will have 60 days from the date on which the Proceeding begins to send a written communication to the other Contracting State appointing one member of the arbitration board. Within 60 days of the date on which the second such communication is sent, the two members appointed by the Contracting States will appoint a third member, who will serve as Chair of the board. If either Contracting State fails to appoint a member, or if the members appointed by the Contracting States fail to agree upon the third member in the manner prescribed by this paragraph, the remaining member(s) will be appointed by the highest-ranking member of the Secretariat at the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) who is not a citizen of either Contracting State, by written notice to both Contracting States within 60 days of the date of such failure. The competent authorities will develop a non-exclusive list of individuals with familiarity in international tax matters who may potentially serve as the Chair of the board. In any case, the Chair shall not be a citizen of either Contracting State.\n\nf) The arbitration board may adopt any procedures necessary for the conduct of its business, provided that the procedures are not inconsistent with any provision of Article 25 or the Protocol to the Convention.\n\ng) Each of the Contracting States will be permitted to submit, within 90 days of the appointment of the Chair of the arbitration board, a Proposed Resolution describing the proposed disposition of the specific monetary amounts of income, expense or taxation at issue in the case, and a supporting Position Paper, for consideration by the arbitration board. Copies of the Proposed Resolution and supporting Position Paper shall be provided by the board to the other Contracting State on the date on which the later of the submissions is submitted to the board. In the event that only one Contracting State submits a Proposed Resolution within the allotted time, then that Proposed Resolution shall be deemed to be the determination of the board in that case and the Proceeding shall be terminated. Each of the Contracting States may, if it so desires, submit a Reply Submission to the board within 180 days of the appointment of its Chair, to address any points raised by the Proposed Resolution or Position Paper submitted by the other Contracting State. Additional information may be submitted to the arbitration board only at its request, and copies of the board’s request and the Contracting State’s response shall be provided to the other Contracting State on the date on which the request or the response is submitted. Except for logistical matters such as those identified in subparagraphs l), n) and o) below, all communications from the Contracting States to the arbitration board, and vice versa, shall take place only through written communications between the designated competent authorities and the Chair of the board.\n\nh) The arbitration board will deliver a determination in writing to the Contracting States within nine months of the appointment of its Chair. The board will adopt as its determination one of the Proposed Resolutions submitted by the Contracting States.\n\ni) In making its determination, the arbitration board will apply, as necessary and in descending order of priority: aa) the provisions of the Convention; bb) any agreed commentaries or explanations of the Contracting States concerning the Convention; cc) the laws of the Contracting States to the extent they are not inconsistent with each other; and dd) any OECD Commentary, Guidelines or Reports regarding relevant analogous portions of the OECD Model Tax Convention.\n\nj) The determination of the arbitration board in a particular case shall be binding on the Contracting States. The determination of the board will not state a rationale. It will have no precedential value.\n\nk) As provided in subparagraph e) of paragraph 6 of Article 25, the determination of an arbitration board shall constitute a resolution by mutual agreement under Article 25. Each concerned person must, within 30 days of receiving the determination of the board from the competent authority to which the case was first presented, advise that competent authority whether that concerned person accepts the determination of the board. If any concerned person fails to so advise the relevant competent authority within this time frame, the determination of the board will be considered not to have been accepted in that case. Where the determination of the board is not accepted, the case may not subsequently be the subject of a Proceeding.\n\nl) Any meeting(s) of the arbitration board shall be in facilities provided by the Contracting State whose competent authority initiated the mutual agreement proceedings in the case.\n\nm) The treatment of any associated interest or penalties will be determined by applicable domestic law of the Contracting State(s) concerned.\n\nn) No information relating to the Proceeding (including the board's determination) may be disclosed by the members of the arbitration board or their staffs or by either competent authority, except as permitted by the Convention and the domestic laws of the Contracting States. In addition, all material prepared in the course of, or relating to, the Proceeding shall be considered to be information exchanged between the Contracting States. All members of the arbitration board and their staffs must agree in statements sent to each of the Contracting States in confirmation of their appointment to the arbitration board to abide by and be subject to the confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions of Article 26 (Exchange of Information and Administrative Assistance) of the Convention and the applicable domestic laws of the Contracting States. In the event those provisions conflict, the most restrictive condition shall apply.\n\no) The fees and expenses will be borne equally by the Contracting States. In general, the fees of members of the arbitration board will be set at the fixed amount of $2,000 (two thousand United States dollars) per day or the equivalent amount in euro, subject to modification by the competent authorities. In general, the expenses of members of the arbitration board will be set in accordance with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Schedule of Fees for arbitrators (as in effect on the date on which the arbitration proceedings begin), subject to modification by the competent authorities. Any fees for language translation will also be borne equally by the Contracting States. Meeting facilities, related resources, financial management, other logistical support, and general administrative coordination of the Proceeding will be provided, at its own cost, by the Contracting State whose competent authority initiated the mutual agreement proceedings in the case. Any other costs shall be borne by the Contracting State that incurs them.\n\np) For purposes of paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 25 and this paragraph, each competent authority will confirm in writing to the other competent authority and to the concerned person(s) the date of its receipt of the information necessary to undertake substantive consideration for a mutual agreement. Such information will be: aa) in the United States, the information required to be submitted to the United States competent authority under Revenue Procedure 2002-52, section 4.05 (or any applicable successor provisions) and, for cases initially submitted as a request for an Advance Pricing Agreement, the information required to be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service under Revenue Procedure 2006-9, section 4 (or any applicable successor provisions), and bb) in the Federal Republic of Germany, the information required to be submitted to the competent authority in the Federal Republic of Germany under the circular of July 1, 1997, - IV C 5 - S 1300 - 189/96 -, published by the Ministry of Finance (or any applicable successor circular). However, this information shall not be considered received until both competent authorities have received copies of all materials submitted to either Contracting State by the concerned person(s) in connection with the mutual agreement procedure.\n\nq) The competent authorities of the Contracting States may modify or supplement the above rules and procedures as necessary to more effectively implement the intent of paragraph 5 of Article 25 to eliminate double taxation.\n\nArticle 26: Exchange of Information and Administrative Assistance\n\n1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention and of the domestic law of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by this Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1 (Personal Scope). Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment, collection, or administration of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes covered by this Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions, unless the competent authority of the Contracting State supplying the information raises an objection.\n\n2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to supply information that is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; c) to supply information that would disclose any trade, business industrial commercial or professional secret or trade process or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.\n\n3. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall obtain the information to which the request relates in the same manner and to the same extent as if the tax of the first-mentioned State were the tax of that other State and were being imposed by that other State. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall, if possible, provide information under this Article in the form of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts, and writings), to the same extent such depositions and documents can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes.\n\n4. Each of the Contracting States shall endeavor to collect on behalf of the other Contracting State such amounts of tax as may be necessary to ensure that relief granted by this Convention from taxation imposed by that other State does not inure to the benefit of persons not entitled thereto.\n\n5. Paragraph 4 shall not impose upon either of the Contracting States the obligation to carry out administrative measures that are of a different nature from those used in the collection of its own taxes, or that would be contrary to its sovereignty, security, or public policy.\n\n6. The Contracting States may, through diplomatic channels, exchange notes under which they may, subject to the provisions of this Article, exchange information for the purposes of taxes imposed by a Contracting State not referred to in Article 2 (Taxes Covered).\n\nProtocol Article 26\n\n23. With reference to Article 26 (Exchange of Information and Administrative Assistance): a) It is understood that the powers of each Contracting State's competent authorities to obtain information include powers to obtain information held by financial institutions, nominees, or persons acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity, and information relating to the ownership of legal persons, and that each Contracting State's competent authority is able to exchange such information in accordance with Article 26. b) The Federal Republic of Germany shall under this Article exchange information with or without request to the extent provided for in the law of 19 December 1985 (EG-Amtshilfe-Gesetz) as amended from time to time without changing the general principles thereof.\n\nArticle 27: Exempt Organizations\n\n1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 28 (Limitation on Benefits), a German company or organization operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, educational, or public purposes shall be exempt from tax by the United States in respect of items of income, if and to the extent that a) such company or organization is exempt from tax in the Federal Republic of Germany, and b) such company or organization would be exempt from tax in the United States in respect of such items of income if it were organized, and carried on all its activities, in the United States.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 28 (Limitation on Benefits), a United States company or organization operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, educational, or public purposes shall be exempt from tax by the Federal Republic of Germany in respect of items of income, if and to the extent that a) such company or organization is exempt from tax in the United States, and b) such company or organization would be exempt from tax in the Federal Republic of Germany in respect of such items of income if it were a German company or organization and carried on all its activities in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nArticle 28: Limitation on Benefits\n\n1. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a resident of one of the Contracting States that derives income from the other Contracting State shall be entitled, in that other Contracting State, to all the benefits of this Convention otherwise accorded to residents of a Contracting State only if such resident is a “qualified person” as defined in paragraph 2 of this Article and satisfies any other conditions specified in the Convention for the obtaining of such benefits.\n\n2. A resident of one of the Contracting States is a qualified person for a taxable year only if such resident is either:\n\na) an individual;\n\nb) a Contracting State, political subdivision or local authority thereof;\n\nc) a company, if aa) its principal class of shares (and any disproportionate class of shares) is regula"
