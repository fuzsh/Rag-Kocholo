        "text": "Given high inflation rates, the ECB Governing Council raised key interest rates in the euro area by half a percentage point in July 2022 for the first time since 2011, thereby ending the period of negative interest rates. The interest rate on main refinancing operations thus rises to 0.50%, while the deposit rate stands at 0%. In addition, the Governing Council decided at its meeting to introduce a new crisis tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI). According to an ECB’s press release, “[the] TPI will be an addition to our toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.”\n\nIn January 2022, Joachim Nagel assumed the office of Bundesbank President after Jens Weidmann stepped down at the end of 2021.\n\nDr Nagel studied economics at the University of Karlsruhe (TH). After completing his doctorate at the University of Karlsruhe’s Faculty of Economics, he worked in the Bundesbank’s Markets Department, initially as a lecturer and later as its head. From 2010 to 2016, Dr Nagel was a member of the Bundesbank’s Executive Board, responsible for the areas of Markets and Information Technology, Banking Supervision (2014) and Controlling, Accounting and Organisation (2015-16). In 2017, he left the Bundesbank to join the Executive Board of the KfW Banking Group.\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus in Europe becomes more and more rapid in February 2020. In the middle of March, many businesses have to close; in some economic sectors activity is brought to a standstill. Borders are closed; the Federal Government introduces contact restrictions for citizens to curb the spread of the virus. Against this backdrop, the ECB Governing Council announces a new, temporary asset purchase programme on 18 March. Under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the ECB aims to purchase a total of €750 billion worth of securities, particularly sovereign bonds, by the end of 2020. By means of this further monetary easing, the ECB intends to support the financing conditions for governments, enterprises and households. As stated in the ECB press release, the ECB Governing Council is committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate. “The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed.” On 4 June, the ECB Governing Council increases the volume of the programme to a total of €1.35 trillion and extends it until at least the end of June 2021.\n\nThe Europa series of banknotes is completed in May 2019 with the addition of the €100 and €200 notes. These last two denominations also now have a new design. The new notes have improved security features and are therefore more difficult for criminals to counterfeit. The production and issuance of €500 banknotes is stopped towards the end of 2018. The Europa series does not include €500 banknotes.\n\nThe European banking union is launched on 4 November 2014. From then on, the ECB monitors the 117 most significant institutions in the euro area.\n\nThe aim of joint supervision is to ensure solvent banks and a level playing field. Together with the national supervisory authorities, the ECB directly supervises the 117 most significant banks. The less significant institutions continue to be supervised by the national supervisory authorities, which in Germany are the Bundesbank and BaFin.\n\nIn January 2013, the Bundesbank takes the decision to store half of its gold reserves in its own vaults in Frankfurt am Main by 2020. To this end, a phased relocation to Frankfurt am Main of 300 tonnes of gold from New York and 374 tonnes from Paris takes place. The Bundesbank completes the gold transfer ahead of schedule in August 2017. Approximately 50% of Germany’s gold reserves are now stored in Frankfurt (as at 31 December 2018), 37% in New York and 13% in London. The gold storage location in Paris is closed.\n\nThe Financial Stability Act (Finanzstabilitätsgesetz) comes into force on 1 January 2013 in Germany. The Financial Stability Act envisages a Financial Stability Committee (FSC), comprising representatives from the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nThis development means a prominent new role the Bundesbank: it receives a macroprudential mandate – the task of supervising the entire financial system – for the first time in its history. Under this mandate, it is the Bundesbank’s task to identify systemic risks, issue the Committee with warnings and recommendations and evaluate the progress and effectiveness of measures taken to ward off risks to the financial system.\n\nThe European Stability Mechanism (ESM) enters into force as the permanent crisis mechanism in October 2012. The ESM is intended to provide financial support if financial stability in the euro area as a whole is at risk, thus replacing the existing temporary crisis resolution mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).\n\nThe ESM’s task is to protect the solvency of euro area Member States experiencing financing difficulties. It can achieve this, for instance, by granting loans or buying government bonds. The ESM has an effective lending capacity of €500 billion. However, lending is subject to appropriate conditionality, to which borrowing Member States must adhere.\n\nOn 26 July 2012, ECB President Mario Draghi holds a speech in London, which, several years on, is still quoted from. He announces that, within its mandate, the ECB is “ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro”. The three words “whatever it takes” have an unforeseen impact. In actual fact, following this speech, the situation in the international financial markets eases and government bond yields decrease significantly in highly indebted countries.\n\nIn May 2011, Jens Weidmann takes office as Bundesbank President, following the resignation of Axel Weber a few months before.\n\nWeidmann studied economics in Aix-en-Provence and Bonn. After completing his doctorate, he worked, amongst other things, as Secretary General of the German Council of Economic Experts before joining the Bundesbank in 2003 as head of the Monetary Policy and Analysis Division. In 2006, he became head of the Economic and Financial Policy Division of the German Federal Chancellery.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011, three new European supervisory authorities start work: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in Paris, the European Banking Authority (EBA) in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) based in Frankfurt am Main.\n\nFrom then on, supervision is carried out at two levels in Europe: microprudential supervision via individual financial institutions and macroprudential supervision across the whole financial system. All three institutions are based at the microprudential supervision level.\n\nThe European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is responsible for macroprudential oversight of the whole financial system. The European Central Bank (ECB) carries out microprudential and macroprudential supervisory tasks for the banks in countries participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).\n\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopts the Basel III framework, which sets out regulatory rules for banks. It replaces the Basel II Accord in a gradual process. Among other things, Basel III requires banks to hold capital of a higher quantity and quality than under the Basel II regime. Banks should thus be in a position to be better able to absorb losses from loan defaults and other unfavourable business events. Basel III also defines, for instance, bank liquidity standards and the minimum leverage ratio.\n\nIn May 2010, the European Central Bank (ECB) adopts the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) in order to counter the impact of the crisis. In this context, it purchases government bonds for around €220 billion between May 2010 and September 2012. The aim behind the asset purchases is to correct the sharp rise in interest rates and to restore an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism. Under the SMP, Greek bonds are initially purchased; the programme is later extended to include Irish and Portuguese government bonds. From the summer of 2011, Spanish and Italian bonds are also added to the programme. Since September 2012, the volume of this portfolio has been steadily shrinking as the government bonds purchased are gradually reaching maturity and thus being repaid.\n\nIn April 2009, the Bundesbank opens a trading office in its Representative Office in New York. This is intended to increase proximity to the international markets. Furthermore, the time difference means that, in a crisis, the Bundesbank can now also act outside of German business hours. As a result, the Bundesbank’s dollar reserves can be managed more efficiently and flexibly.\n\nThe insolvency of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers marks the start of a crisis that causes financial institutions and countries across the world to run into difficulties. The Federal Government founds the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (SoFFin) a few weeks after the Lehman insolvency. SoFFin has a total of €480 billion available to support German banks. It has three ways of doing this: by granting guarantees, providing capital and purchasing securities.\n\nThe Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) is officially given the green light in December 2007. Alongside Germany, SEPA includes the other 26 EU Member States at this point in time as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. SEPA is a step towards harmonising credit transfers, direct debits and card payments in Europe. From 28 January 2008, all account holders can make transfers across Europe using an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and a Bank Identifier Code (BIC).\n\nIn November 2007, a new payment system for large-value and express transfers is launched. TARGET2, which was jointly developed by the Bundesbank, the Banque de France and the Banca d’Italia on behalf of the Eurosystem, is based on a single shared platform for all In November 2007, a new payment system for large-value and express transfers is launched. TARGET2, which was jointly developed by the Bundesbank, the Banque de France and the Banca d’Italia on behalf of the Eurosystem, is based on a single shared platform for all participants and progressively replaces the decentralised TARGET system, which has been in operation since 1999. Initially, 259 banks from eight countries participate in TARGET2. Thirteen more EU countries follow in two migration steps in the period up to 19 May 2008.\n\nFrom 1 January 2002, the euro becomes legal tender in 12 Member States of the European Union to start with. From this point onwards, people in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain use euro notes and coins to make payments.\n\nIn September 2001, the Bundesbank begins providing banks with euro cash in advance of the euro’s official launch. This frontloading is necessary to ensure that all banks have sufficient euro cash for the first few days of the currency changeover.\n\nOn 1 September 1999, Ernst Welteke begins his term of office as President of the Bundesbank. The economics graduate began his career in politics and was a member of the Hessian state parliament for more than 20 years. He first became President of the Land Central Bank in Hesse in 1995 before taking over from Hans Tietmeyer in 1999.\n\nOn 1 January 1999, the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union commences with the introduction of the euro as book money. From now on, all euro area countries issue their government bonds in euro and the financial markets also list most prices in euro. At the same time, responsibility for monetary policy is transferred from the national central banks to the Eurosystem. Many goods are priced in euro and the local currency from this point on.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) starts work on 1 June 1998 as the successor to the European Monetary Institute (EMI). Since then, monetary policy decisions for the euro area have been made by the ECB Governing Council. This is made up of the ECB President and Vice-President, the four other members of the ECB Executive Board, and the governors of all Eurosystem national central banks. Just like the Bundesbank, the ECB pursues a stability-oriented monetary policy from the very start. The Eurosystem’s primary objective is to maintain price stability.\n\nThe heads of state and government of the Member States of the European Community sign the Maastricht Treaty on 7 February 1992. It comes into force in 1993 and lays the foundations for Economic and Monetary Union.\n\nIt will be realised in three stages. The first stage begins with the abolition of capital controls between the Member States with retroactive effect from 1 July 1990. A name has also been agreed: in future, the currency that Europeans from Lisbon to Berlin will use is to be called the “euro”.\n\nThe Bundesbank Act of 1957 has so far stipulated that the Bundesbank be domiciled in the same location as the Federal Government. Under the Act, however, as long as the Federal Government is not domiciled in Berlin, the Bundesbank is domiciled in Frankfurt am Main. At the initiative of the federal state of Hesse, legislators amend this provision of the Bundesbank Act with effect from 1 March 1991. Section 2 sentence 3 now specifies the following: “The Bank is domiciled in Frankfurt am Main.” This puts to bed a long-standing debate on the bank’s location.\n\nOn 1 July 1990, the Treaty Establishing a Monetary, Economic and Social Union (Staatsvertrag über die Schaffung einer Währungs-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialunion) enters into force. This makes the Deutsche Mark the sole legal tender in the GDR. The run on the banks is huge. The first banks open their counters at midnight in order to ensure that all GDR citizens are able to lay their hands on the new currency on time.\n\nIn May 1990, the Bundesbank sets up a provisional administrative office in Berlin-Dahlem to prepare for monetary union. Provision is made for this in the treaty between the FRG and the GDR that is signed several weeks later. The provisional administrative office is headed by Directorate member Johann Wilhelm Gaddum.\n\nIn addition to the provisional administrative office, the Bundesbank sets up 15 branches in the GDR from May 1990. These new branches report to the provisional administrative office in Berlin.\n\nThe Bundesbank has to make numerous preparations in order to ensure that all GDR citizens are able to lay their hands on the Deutsche Mark on 1 July 1990 as scheduled. In early June, cash transport vehicles bring 440 million banknotes and 102 million coins to the newly opened branches.\n\nOn 9 November 1989, the wall between East and West Berlin falls. Only a short time later on 6 February 1990, then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl offers the GDR government the opportunity to negotiate a monetary union. A consensus is quickly reached that the GDR Mark should be replaced by the Deutsche Mark. The way in which the currency changeover should take place is the subject of fierce debate, however. The Bundesbank takes a sceptical view of rapidly introducing the Deutsche Mark in the GDR.\n\nContrary to the Bundesbank's recommendation, the Federal Government decides that all adult citizens can exchange up to 4,000 GDR Marks for Deutsche Marks at a ratio of 1:1. The amount that pensioners can exchange on a 1:1 basis is even higher, at up to 6,000 GDR Marks.\n\nBundesbank President Karl Otto Pöhl and Directorate member Leonhard Gleske open the Bundesbank’s representative office on Park Avenue in New York on 3 November 1986. The Tokyo office is opened shortly afterwards. These are followed in subsequent years by ten permanent representative offices in Brussels, Istanbul, London, Moscow, Mumbai, Paris, Beijing, Pretoria, São Paulo and Singapore.\n\nOne of the representative offices’ most important tasks is to monitor and analyse local financial systems and economic developments. However, the Bundesbank also attaches particular importance to its staff having personal contact with local experts.\n\nThe European Monetary System (EMS) is launched on 13 March 1979. It initially comprises Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands. At the heart of the EMS is the European Currency Unit (ECU), which serves as its key benchmark and unit of account and is also used by the central banks as a means of payment and a reserve currency. The participating countries set a central ECU rate for each currency. Most exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate by up to 2.25% around their particular central rate. In order to keep exchange rates within this band, central banks need to intervene in the foreign exchange market where necessary.\n\nThe Deutsche Mark becomes the unofficial anchor and benchmark currency in the EMS. The Bundesbank has to make regular purchases of other European currencies in exchange for the Deutsche Mark in order to support their exchange rates. This causes Germany’s money supply to expand further and the risk of inflation to rise.\n\nAt the start of 1973, the Deutsche Mark is hit by a wave of speculation. The Bundesbank purchases large quantities of US dollars to keep the exchange rate stable against the US dollar. The Directorate of the Bundesbank asks the Federal Government to release the Bank from its obligation to intervene. The Bundesbank then stops buying US dollars. Other currencies’ peg to the US dollar is officially abandoned shortly afterwards as well.\n\nIn the spring of 1972, the governments of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands set up a European exchange rate arrangement known as the snake. Under this arrangement, the exchange rates of the participating currencies are not allowed to deviate from the agreed central rates by more than 2.25%. The snake is replaced by the European Monetary System in 1979.\n\nThe US dollar comes under increasing pressure in 1971. It often reaches the lower intervention point relative to the Deutsche Mark. In such instances, the Bundesbank is forced to intervene to support the dollar, which is why it buys US$6 billion and sells DEM 22 billion in April and May 1971. Inflation rises as a result. The Federal Government decides that the Deutsche Mark should float temporarily.\n\nKarl Blessing takes up office as the first President of the Bundesbank on 1 January 1958. The business graduate previously worked for the Reichsbank from 1920 and was seconded to the Bank for International Settlements in Basel to take up the role of Head of Division from 1930 to 1934.\n\nInformation on the historical classification of Karl Blessing, in particular his role as a member of the Reichsbank Board of Directors from 1937 to 1939, can be found in our study \"From the Reichsbank to the Bundesbank: People, generations and concepts between tradition, continuity and new beginnings (1924 to 1970)\".\n\nThe German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) of 23 May 1949 stipulates that the Bank deutscher Länder, which was founded in 1948, be replaced by a “note-issuing and currency bank as the Federal Bank”. The Bundesbank Act (Gesetz über die Deutsche Bundesbank) is passed on 26 July 1957 and enters into force on 1 August. Since then, the Bundesbank has been the independent central bank of Germany. Safeguarding price stability is its primary objective.\n\nThe Bundesbank is initially headed by Karl Bernard and Wilhelm Vocke up until January 1958. Bernard was previously the President of the Central Bank Council of the Bank deutscher Länder and Vocke the President of the Board of Managers of the Bank deutscher Länder."
