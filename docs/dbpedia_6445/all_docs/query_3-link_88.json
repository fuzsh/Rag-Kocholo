After enjoying a stellar career in entertainment spanning decades, the actress has finally passed away. In a Twitter Post, Ryan's son, Michael Penn, shared he revealed that the movie star passed away on October 9, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEileen Ryan (Sean Penn's mother) attends the \"I Am Sam\" Beverly Hills Premiere on December 3, 2001, at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in Beverly Hills, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nOther reports made it known that Ryan died at her home in Malibu. Unfortunately, she could not live to celebrate her 95th birthday on October 16, 2022, one week after her demise.\n\nThe cause of death is yet to be known, but in the meantime, the public's prayers are with her eldest son, Michael, and his family, who are grieving. Ryan has now joined her husband, Leo Penn, who had been promoting her career for the longest time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple had a beautiful love story that lasted for forty years and produced three offspring. Here are more details about Ryan's life, including her romance with Leo and motherhood.\n\nEileen Ryan's Relationship with Her Son, Sean\n\nRyan and Leo first met in 1957 during rehearsals for the Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh.\" The pair started dating shortly after their meeting and eventually walked down the aisle. In 1958, the couple welcomed their first son, Michael.\n\nBesides giving up her career, she once requested to accompany Sean to the Oscar Award night when he was not nominated.\n\nSean Penn and Eileen Ryan Penn attend the 3rd annual Sean Penn & Friends HELP HAITI HOME Gala benefiting J/P HRO presented by Giorgio Armani at Montage Beverly Hills on January 11, 2014, in Beverly Hills, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nTwo years later, the couple celebrated the arrival of their second son, the famous Sean Penn. Following the birth of her boys, like many celebrity mothers, Ryan decided that motherhood was most important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, she quit her thriving career as a Broadway star to focus on raising her sons. During that period, the actress tried inculcating the right values in her children. Ryan also made sure they chose their career path rather than being forced into show business because of their famous parents.\n\nEileen Ryan and Sean Penn during Glamour Reel Moments Short Film Series Presented by Cartier - Arrivals at Director's Guild in Los Angeles, California, United States. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAfter years of being away from the big screen and raising her boys, the actress's sons eventually decided that pursuing a career in entertainment was the best.\n\nMichael would become a musician while Sean ventured into the movie industry. The ultimate goal was perfecting their craft and becoming the best in their respective fields.\n\nSo, they worked hard, going as far as shooting their productions with friends in their Malibu neighborhood. Eventually, things worked out well for Ryan's sons with consistency and hard work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEileen Ryan and son Sean Penn during The 76th Annual Academy Awards Nominees Luncheon at Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, United States. | Source: Getty Images\n\nWith his success, Sean contributed to his mother's return to the movie industry by helping her land a role in the 1986 film \"At Close Range,\" in which he co-starred.\n\nThe following years saw the mother and son become more extensive in the entertainment industry. Sean would later establish his production company called Clyde is Hungry. Following the establishment of his company, Sean and his movie star parents came together to work on a family project, \"Remembrance.\"\n\nSean Penn and his mother, Eileen Ryan, arrive at the Los Angeles premiere of Paramount Vantage's \"Into the Wild\" held at the Director's Guild of America on September 18, 2007, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drama featured Ryan and Leo as actors, Graham Reid as the playwright, and Sean, his production company, and Helicon Theatre company as the executive producers.\n\nThankfully, the production turned out successful. The director, Brady, commended Ryan and Leo's acting talent. According to him, the couple had nothing to worry about, despite their long absence from the movie industry.\n\nAt the same time, Sean could not have been prouder of his parents, as he considered them great actors and an inspiration to him. Relatively, Ryan and Leo felt the same way about their son. According to the pair, Sean was a \"good son with a strong social conscience.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no wonder why Ryan was a support system for Sean until her demise. Besides giving up her career, she once requested to accompany Sean to the Oscar Award night when he was not nominated. Then in 2004, when the actor was nominated for his performance in \"Mystic River,\" Ryan was present, cheering him on.\n\nBesides Sean, Ryan was also a doting mother to two sons, Michael, and Chris Penn, born in 1965. Sadly, in 2006, Chris passed away from battling cardiomyopathy.\n\nWho Are Eileen Ryan's Grandchildren?\n\nBefore Ryan's tragic demise, \"mother\" was not the only title she had. The actress was also a grandmother to two grandchildren, Dylan Penn and Hopper Penn.\n\nSean Penn, his son Hopper Penn, and daughter Dylan Penn leave \"The Last Face\" Premiere during the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival at the Palais des Festivals on May 20, 2016, in Cannes, France. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn on April 13, 1991, Dylan is the eldest of Ryan's grandchildren. Like her father and grandparents, the 31-year-old has chosen to pursue a career in show business.\n\nShe made her movie debut in 2015, starring in \"Condemned,\" and since then, Dylan has appeared in other products, including \"Flag Day,\" \"Elvis & Nixon,\" \"Unregistered,\" and \"Aramingo Avenue.\"\n\nSean Penn, his son Hopper Penn and daughter Dylan Penn leave \"The Last Face\" Premiere during the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival at the Palais des Festivals on May 20, 2016, in Cannes, France. | Source: Getty Images\n\nBesides her acting career, Dylan is also a model and has worked with big fashion publications like GQ and Elle. Her brother, Hopper, is also deeply rooted in the entertainment industry. Born on August 6, 1993, the 29-year-old is an actor.\n\nHooper is famous for appearing in the 2016 movie \"The Last Face\" and the 2017 production \"War Machine.\" In addition, he has featured in \"Between Worlds\" alongside Nicolas Cage and \"Flag Day,\" directed by his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSean Penn, his son Hopper Penn and daughter Dylan Penn leave 'The Last Face' Premiere during the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival at the Palais des Festivals on May 20, 2016, in Cannes, France. | Source: Getty Images\n\nActing is not the only thing Hopper has tried his hands at. Considering his handsome face and dashing physique, he has also done some modeling gigs. The starlet has given his Instagram fans a glimpse of his modeling photoshoots.\n\nOverall, it is great to see Dylan and her brother excelling in their careers. Sean will forever be proud of his children's successes, as will Ryan. May her soul rest in peace."
