Over her nearly 60-year career in television, Ryan appeared in bit roles on episodes of various famous television shows, including the “Twilight Zone” episode “A World of Difference” where she plays the ex-wife of a businessman who discovers that his life is actually a role in a TV show, and that he is actually a failing actor on the verge of insolvency.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNikki Finke, Pioneering Journalist and Scourge of Hollywood, Dies at 68"
