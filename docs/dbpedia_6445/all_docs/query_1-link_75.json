        "text": "MALIBU, Calif. (AP) — Eileen Ryan, an actor who appeared on TV, in films and on Broadway and the matriarch of the steeped-in-the-arts Penn family, has died. She was 94.\n\nRyan, who was the mother of actors Sean Penn and Christopher Penn and musician Michael Penn, died at her home in Malibu, California, on Sunday, according to family spokesperson Mara Buxbaum. Ryan would have turned 95 next Sunday.\n\n“We lost mom yesterday,” Michael Penn tweeted with a broken heart emoji.\n\nShe had two roles on Broadway in the 1950s — both short-lived — in “Sing Till Tomorrow” in 1953 and “Comes a Day” in 1958.\n\nIn 1957, Ryan was at rehearsals for “Iceman Cometh” when she met Leo Penn, who had taken over for Jason Robards at the Circle in the Square production. They moved in together within a week of meeting and married a few months later. Leo Penn died in 1998.\n\nHer TV credits include appearances on “Private Practice,” “The Twilight Zone,” “Bonanza,” “The Detectives,” “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “Arli$$,” “Ally McBeal,” “NYPD Blue,” “ER,” “CSI,” “Men of a Certain Age” and “Grey’s Anatomy.”\n\nHer film roles included “Parenthood,” and “Benny & Joon.” She also acted in films with her sons, including “At Close Range,” “I Am Sam,” “The Indian Runner” and “The Crossing Guard.”\n\nMark K. Miller began covering the television industry in 1975 when he joined Broadcasting magazine as an editorial assistant, becoming a staff writer. He moved to editing, becoming managing editor of the renamed Broadcasting & Cable in 1991. Mark left B&C at the end of 1998, but continued his association with the company as managing editor of B&C’s new monthly tabloid magazine, Digital Television, until it ceased publication in December 1999. Mark worked with Harry Jessell to launch TVNewsCheck in 2006 (as TVNewsday) and has been its managing editor since then. He can be reached at [email protected]."
