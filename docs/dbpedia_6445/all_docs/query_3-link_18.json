Hollywood has seen many stars, but not many are more controversial than Sean Penn. Starting his film career in the 1980s, Penn was all set to make a career in the mighty Hollywood. His life took a turn and he married pop singer Madonna,. What followed was a flailing relation with the paparazzi and issues of domestic instability which even landed him in jail.\n\nThis was a big deviation from his film career and no one expected what followed. After a break from acting, Penn reinvented himself and came back to Hollywood with a bang. He showed his acting prowess by winning the coveted Academy Award twice, for his portrayals in Mystic River and Milk.\n\nHe branched into direction with the movie The Indian Runner and went on to direct several other successful films. From rubbishing the comments of Tinseltown to criticizing America’s foreign policy, he has constantly remained at the edge of criticism and never failed to create a mighty uproar. In addition to his acting, he is also known for his political activism and humanitarian work.\n\nThis Biography Written By 7infi.com\n\nRead the full article"
