        "text": "Return to current year’s Fall Fest page.\n\nSept 9, 2023 – Community Concert – Canceled\n\nWe were sorry that our September 9/10 concert had to be canceled. The bad storms over the entire weekend ruined many outdoor plans, including our planned event. The Magical Mystery Doors (our band) needed to travel quite a distance to be here and that complicated it all even more. Believe me, it was not an easy decision to pull the plug on something we’d worked on for months! We thank all the sponsors who continued to support us despite the cancelation, and we thank all those who purchased raffle tickets and offered donations.\n\nPlease see below the list of our amazing sponsors. We couldn’t help out our families without their help. Any support you can offer them would be much appreciated on our part, and they believe in the value of lending a hand to support their community!\n\nThanks also to the restaurants that donated gift certificates for our raffle: Avola Kitchen + Bar, Cedar Hollow Inn, Nudy’s, Poseidon Asian Cuisine, Elegance Cafe, Casey’s Tavern, San Nicola, Home Cooked, Aneu, and DanDan’s. This is much appreciated!!! And we are excited to say that we have pulled the winning 4 tickets. Thanks again to Eileen Kraut for organizing the raffle, and to Richard at Nudy’s for being the person to help draw the winning tickets. Thanks again to all who participated and congrats to the 4 winners! See photos below on this special drawing.\n\nThanks again to the food truck vendors that were scheduled to attend: Philly Hots, Savanna’s Tender Love & Fries, JT Wilder BBQ, and Handels.\n\nFinally, a very special thanks to the committee that worked so hard to pull this all off. Their efforts were MUCH appreciated! Those volunteers included: Barb Bogle, Susan Chronister, Jeannie Dechiario, Maggie Golden, Sandi Gorman, Molly Johnson, Audrey Kese, Karla Konz, Eileen Kraut, Danyll Lockett, Stacy Stone, Monica Thomson and Rita Thompson.\n\nGetting ready for the drawing\n\nGetting ready to draw another winner\n\nDigging in deep for a winner\n\nWinning tickets\n\nSponsors 2023\n\nIf you would like to Sponsor the concert – we’d love to hear from you at fallfest@tecare.org.

The Magical Mystery Doors, which just the day before had been voted by USA Today as “the Best Casino Show in the USA“, really outdid themselves. The music was so fun! Check out the videos on this page to get a sense of the sound. VERY special!\n\nThe weather was perfect again this year! Someone is looking out for us, that’s for sure! Wilson Farm Park is the perfect setting for this event – plenty of parking and room to spread out for the 500+ folks in attendance. We had 5 great food truck options – some of which sold out again! Rave reviews of the quality of food from all of them! Over 750 raffle tickets were sold, and the winner of the grand prize of $600 gave us half back! So that idea worked great. Catherine’s Kitchen, one of our food trucks, offered a $50 gift card that we added as a 4th raffle prize, too. Very fun! Thanks to all who participated and congrats to the winners!\n\nThanks to all the volunteers, to the committee, to those who made donations, to those who bought tickets, and to those who just came to have a great time. We hope you did!

TEC received 10% of the sales for anyone who went to Will’s + Bill’s after the concert who shows the event post card. The food was fantastic!\n\nWHAT A SPECIAL EVENT – September 2021!!!\n\nThe T&E Care Thank You concert held on September 10, 2021 was a HUGE SUCCESS! The band was outstanding. The setting was perfect. The food trucks sold out! And of course the weather gods looked favorably upon us with PERFECT weather – low 70s, sun, and just a slight breeze. It couldn’t have been better! The only glitch was a power malfunction for the band at the very end of the event – but the crowd just sang along to a couple of favorite Beatles tunes to help them finish off the night! It actually made it kind of special! The crowd estimate was over 500 people in attendance! Lots of raffle tickets and t-shirts were sold, and many folks honored us with general donations. And more importantly – some new friends to T&E Care were made. Congrats to the Rotwitt family for winning the 50/50 and THANKS for declining to take the winnings. That’s a true T&E Care friend! Thanks again to Good Sports of Wayne for making this happen, to all our sponsors, and special thanks to the amazing committee who pulled this off.

Thanks to all those who sponsored the event, made general donations, and/or purchased raffle tickets. Many thanks to Bob Kelly of Fox 29 News for being our emcee for the raffle pull, and to Paoli Hospital and Main Line Health for hosting the event. Special thanks to Jack Lynch, CEO and President of MLH for doing our opening note for the virtual video, and to those front line workers that helped with the raffle. These folks represented ALL those at MLH and around the country who have dedicated so much to keeping us safe during these trying times. Helping from Paoli were: Rev. Barbara Emery (Spiritual Care Coordinator), Nicola Caldwell-Macelree (Staff Nurse – providing direct patient care to Covid patients), Cindy Kennedy (Respiratory Therapist), Bill Leahey (Supervisor Mechanics), Ray Guy (Radiologic Technologist), Shirley Bond (Environmental Services Team Leader), Elikem Awuyah (Food Service Assistant), Jaden Bedwell (Registration/Scheduling Specialist), and Sheila Landis (Public Safety Officer).

A MAJOR success for sure. The decorations were beautiful, the food delicious, the prizes incredible, the band (Three and One) was really terrific, and the enthusiasm of the crowd was contagious. The recognition of our board chair John “Jump” Dautrich, was all that it should have been – with over 250 people in attendance to give him the credit he deserves for all he’s done for T&E Care and the community at large. At the event it was announced that a special fund has been created to continue the honor of Jump – the John Dautrich Hero Fund. The money in this account will be used when special requests for assistance come to T&E Care – as a way to continue the tribute to Jump and so many others. If you would like to make a donation to that fund – you can either send a check (made payable to T&E Care) to: T&E Care, PO Box 2111, Southeastern, PA 19399, use Venmo (@tecare) or follow the paypal/credit card link on this website page.\n\nThe Fall Fest is our biggest source of revenue each year to help us have the funds ready when we have families asking for assistance. We are sure that we topped last year’s record of over $120,000 in profit – thanks to the continued generosity of the community and our amazing sponsors. Thanks again to St. Davids for being a great host, to Nothing Bundt Cake (Gateway) for sharing the cost of the wonderful desserts, and to StudioFlora (Berwyn) for loaning us so many gorgeous decorations. Yet another truly TEAM effort!\n\nPlease contact us at fallfest@tecare.org if you have any questions.\n\nThe Fall Fest 2019 Committee\n\nThanks to the amazing 2019 committee members!
