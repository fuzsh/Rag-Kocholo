She was 94.\n\nMs. Ryan, the mother of actors Sean Penn and Christopher Penn and musician Michael Penn, died at her home in Malibu on Sunday, according to family spokesperson Mara Buxbaum. She would have turned 95 next Sunday.\n\n“We lost mom yesterday,” Michael Penn tweeted with a broken heart emoji.\n\nShe had two roles on Broadway in the 1950s — both short-lived — in “Sing Till Tomorrow” in 1953 and “Comes a Day” in 1958.\n\nIn 1957, Ms. Ryan was at rehearsals for “Iceman Cometh” when she met Leo Penn, who had taken over for Jason Robards at the Circle in the Square production. They moved in together within a week of meeting and married a few months later. Leo Penn died in 1998.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer TV credits include appearances on “Private Practice,” “The Twilight Zone,” “Bonanza,” “The Detectives,” “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “Arli$$,” “Ally McBeal,” “NYPD Blue,” “ER,” “CSI,” “Men of a Certain Age,” and “Grey’s Anatomy.”\n\nHer film roles included “Parenthood,” and “Benny & Joon.” She also acted in films with her sons, including “At Close Range,” “I Am Sam,” “The Indian Runner,” and “The Crossing Guard.”\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
