        "text": "Of all the local stories to come out of filming the famous flop “The Florentine,” this one is the tastiest.\n\nActor Chris Penn took over the kitchen of one of the filming locations, the now-former Easton Sweet Shop in Centre Square, and made himself the unofficial chef for cast and crew. According to an Express-Times report 25 years ago this week, his eggplant parmesan lasagna took two days to make but was well worth the wait.\n\nFrom the Nov. 25, 1997, report:\n\n“Film acting is a performance. It’s a very public statement. Cooking is very private. It’s a personal statement,” [Penn] said. “It relaxes me. It’s very relaxing.\n\n“This sauce I do as good as any performance,” Penn said … while slicing eggplant. “This sauce and a Porterhouse steak, nobody can beat me.”\n\n… Clad in a sweat suit and sneakers, Penn moved around the Sweet Shop’s kitchen putting the final touches on the sauce. The secret to a great sauce is adding many different vegetables and cooking nice and slowly, he said. The sauce is so thick that the wooden fork stands straight up in it when it isn’t being used to stir.\n\nActors Tom Sizemore and Jim Belushi joined Penn in the kitchen for taste-testing. The movie’s cast also included Luke Perry, Michael Madsen, Burt Young and Mary Stuart Masterson.\n\nMost scenes were shot in Bethlehem and Easton over five weeks. Mothers Bar and Grill off Easton’s Centre Square, served as the titular bar’s exterior while the Old Mount Vernon Ale House, now Two Rivers Brewing Co., was the interior.\n\nMORE: ‘The Sopranos’ needed to dump a body. Dutch Springs was the perfect place.\n\nPenn, the brother of actor Sean Penn, told the newspaper he learned cooking from his parents. Sweet Shop owner Peter Karavoulias was one of the few to learn the secret recipe to the Annucci sauce, named after Penn’s mother.\n\n“You know what I love about these guys?” Karavoulias told The Express-Times. “Every single one of these guys is down to earth. They’re themselves. And I’m going to miss these guys when they’re gone.”\n\nPenn was excited about “The Florentine,” telling the newspaper it was “a combination of the best part and one of the best scripts I’ve ever read.” Unfortunately, the movie, despite its cast and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola, was released direct to video in 1999. Penn died in 2006.\n\nMORE LEHIGH VALLEY HISTORICAL HEADLINES THIS WEEK\n\n• 10 YEARS AGO | Nov. 20-21, 2012: Extreme Easton-P’burg pranks.
