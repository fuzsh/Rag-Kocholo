        "text": "Actress Eileen Ryan, mom of legendary actor Sean Penn, has passed away at the age of 94, RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nWhile the actress led an incredible career in Hollywood in her own right, she was famously the mother to composure and songwriter, Michael Penn, as well as actors Sean and Chris Penn.\n\nRyan died at her home on Sunday. A cause of death has not yet been released at this time.\n\nHer work supporting and starring in the family’s entertainment ventures continued when she appeared in the 1995 film, The Crossing Guard. Sean wrote and directed the film. Chris also appeared on the screen alongside his mother, as well as Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston.\n\nRyan also served in a role for cult-classic director Paul Thomas Anderson for his film Magnolia.\n\nThe heartbreaking news of his mother’s passing comes after Sean's divorce from Leila George. The couple finally reached a settlement earlier in March, officially ending their short-lived one-year marriage."
