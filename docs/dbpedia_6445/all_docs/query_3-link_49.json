He was born on September 3, 1948, in Chicago, Illinois, and also lived in Miami, Florida, as well as Arizona, where he resided for over 40 years. Bob was a devoted husband, loving father and grandfather, and caring brother. In his retirement, he pursued his passions for sports, including tennis and golf.\n\nBefore he retired, Bob spent most of his career in the finance and securities industry. Early in his career, Bob was a trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Later he worked as a stockbroker at E.F. Hutton and Merril Lynch and as an investment specialist at Vanguard and for the State of Israel.

Goodman of Needham, MA passed away on November 30, 2023 after a brief illness and a blessedly long life. He was 93 years old.\n\nLen was born in 1930 and raised in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston with his 3 younger brothers and many close cousins. He attended Northeastern University and was the first person in his family to graduate college.\n\nAfter serving briefly in the Air Force, Len started his own business in Quincy – Car Storage of Boston – where he met and married Carol [Szczesny] Williams, had 2 children (in addition to the 2 children he had several years prior) and lived in Brookline briefly before moving to Needham in 1972, where he’d live for the rest of his life.\n\nLen eventually took a job with his cousin’s company, The Interface Group, where he acted as Vice President of Operations for the next 20 years. He and his second [former] wife Marianne [Martori] Goodman enjoyed many years of traveling the world for work and pleasure, and Lenny continued to devote most of his free time to playing golf [at the Framingham Country Club] and enjoying the great view of Fenway that his Red Sox season tickets provided.\n\nAn avid handball player for most of his life, Len skied around New England as a young man and dabbled in photography, but in his later years there was no doubt his most fulfilling and important pastime was being with his grandchildren – visiting them at their homes; watching them splash around in his pool; snuggling up on the couch to watch TV; encouraging ice cream after dinner whenever possible; passing along his ‘Don’t be a bozo!’ mantra to the next generation; and just hearing his ‘best little and big pals’ talk about their lives.\n\nLen was preceded in death by his parents, Samuel and Rachel [Tonkin] Goodman; his youngest brother Richie Goodman of Randolph; many dear cousins; and a lifetime of close friends, including Ron Wood of Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nLen leaves behind many grieving friends including John Bradley of Vienna, VA; many former co-workers; and a large family including two brothers, Don Goodman of Duxbury [formerly of Framingham] and Jerry Goodman of Dedham [formerly of Needham and Medfield], many loving nieces and nephews, and his four devoted children – all of whom loved him very much: Stephen Hourin and his wife Tracey of Marlton, NJ; Roger Hourin and his wife Tracy of Sanford, ME; Brad Goodman and his wife Kathryn of Nashua, NH; and Kim Goodman of Belmont, MA ~ plus 9 beloved grandchildren (Devin, Kris, Katie, Zoe, Noah, Eden, Samantha, Jack & Henry) and 3 great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Eaton Funeral Home, 1351 Highland Ave, Needham, MA on Saturday, January 6th at 11:30 a.m., with a celebratory brunch to follow.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions in Len’s memory may be made to the United States Handball Association to help sustain and promote the sport which Len loved, and which brought him such fulfillment throughout his life.\n\nSevero Francis Sanchez\n\nDecember 3, 1944 ~ November 28, 2023\n\nSevero Francis Sanchez, loving son, father, and brother, passed away in Lakewood, Washington where he resided much of his adult life. He was one of thousands of a generation called Baby Boomers; he died only a few days before his 79th birthday which was December 3, 1944, at San Bernardino, California.\n\nIt was the war years and so he was named after his uncle, Staff Sergeant Severo Sanchez, and lived under his uncle’s badge of courage, a Purple Heart and a military burial, nearly one year after the invasion of Pearl Harbor, and only months after his uncle was killed in action, October 1944 at the historical Landing of Leyte in the Philippines. Less than two months later Severo, his nephew was born, a hero’s namesake.\n\nThe fair haired tenth child of Leonides (Leo) Nicolas Sanchez and Macedonia (Maxie) Acuna, who predeceased him by over twenty-five years, Severo was a delight to his whole family, brothers and sisters alike with whom he shared sports, music, and love of family—a family he revered, keeping in close touch, well into his senior years.\n\nHe lost all of his brothers and two older sisters before his own passing, November 2023. They were Leo Edward, Christopher, Emiliano, and Joseph; and two older sisters, Theresa Ybarra and Mary Sanchez. In his own words, he expressed a deep heartbreak and a growing faith in God, through loving messages he left behind in countless cards and letters to his mother, brothers and sisters. He has four surviving sisters, Josephine Zanone, the eldest daughter of eleven; Rita Sanchez Griswold; Angelica Stinnett; and Emily Mikkelson, the youngest of the Sanchez family; Gloria Gonzalez Sanchez, sister-in-law, several cousins, and nearly 30 nieces and nephews.\n\nAs a child, Severo showed a spark of brilliance early on when, before age five, he was able to memorize his brothers’ trading cards with photos of famous boxers like Joe Lewis, Jake La Matta, Rocky Graciano, and others. So surprised by this feat, one of his uncles remarked that this was “impossible; he must be reading the names!” Severo was also blessed with good looks; his father, so taken by his young son’s mass of curls, refused to give him a haircut until he started school. Severo excelled in local schools and was popular for his wit and personality. As a kid, yet unable to pronounce the three syllables of his name, Severo called himself “Wowo” and the nickname stuck–affectionately, throughout his life.\n\nIn 1964, During the Vietnam War, Severo enlisted in the United States Air Force. His family was understandably concerned for his safety, but he was stationed stateside in Hawaii for the duration, and honorably discharged in 1967.\n\nWhen he joined the Service he became their handball champ. Later, he became Seattle, Washington’s champ, second only to their longtime homeboy who he nearly beat in the championship. Severo’s love of sports brought him some notoriety, but most of all he made sports part of his lifestyle and friendships. His sister Angelica recalls him always rooting for the Seattle Mariners with his son Brian.\n\nAt age 22, Severo met and married Rosie of Seattle, Washington, and helped raise her children: a son, Troy, two daughters, Rhonda, and Lisa. Soon the couple had a child of their own, Brian Vincent Sanchez. Seven years later, they separated and Severo raised Brian on his own as a loving single father. For a short while he attended the University of Washington, where he excelled in speech and drama until he moved to San Bernardino with his son.\n\nSevero was also a brilliant guitarist who recorded his music at home, often with his own son. His family remembers him singing his signature song, the nostalgic “Vincent” a homage to the painter Van Gogh. The song reminded his family of Severo. The words rang out as he sang, “Starry Starry Night, I could have told you Vincent, the world was never made for anyone as beautiful as you.”\n\nHis sister Rita recalls a song he sang for Rosie “How Wonderful Life is When You’re in the World,” by Elton John; his youngest sister Emily most remembers, “Softly, As I Leave You,” by Matt Monroe. She and Angelica recall the heartfelt sentiment of family-longing in a song he recorded, “Back Home Again.” But it was “California Dreamin’” in a duet Severo performed with Brian that touched hearts, because of Brian’s sweet voice at age 8. It was about that same time when Brian’s parents separated that the two of them, father and son, relocated back home to California, and finally back to Washington. Emily said, “We missed them,” and so remembered them when she heard the song “I’ll be Home for Christmas,” always hoping for a visit.\n\nSome family visited Seattle, “Joseph gave us a surprise visit,” Severo said in a letter to his mother. Angelica and Steve Stinnett drove to Seattle; Rita traveled to Seattle by train one Christmas. Josephine remembers Severo as a good dad. “Severo always took good care of his son” she recalls. Some years ago, Brian ended up in the hospital with a kidney malfunction and thereafter became bedridden. Severo always went to visit him and advocated for him during this difficult time. Brian did not recover. Severo said he never stopped praying for him. Brian died on May 30, 2023.\n\nSevero, now alone in Lakewood Washington, endured a lengthy stay in the hospital himself with a staph infection in his leg He was finally released, and then died at home shortly thereafter. His family mourns the loss of its youngest son.\n\nRon Hall, San Diego, Calif.\n\nJanuary 1, 1950 ~ November 22, 2023\n\nRonald Lee Hall was born on January 1st, 1950 to Victor and Mary Hall in Lemon Gove, CA. The third of four children, Ron’s parents fostered his drive toward entrepreneurship, maintaining an active social life, and contributions to both professional and civic organizations. As a boy, Ron was athletic, handsome, and lucky. He developed a love of the outdoors through the Boy Scouts and many backpacking expeditions through the Sierra Nevada mountains, eventually becoming an Eagle Scout.\n\nRon always had a quick dry wit which led to him being named “best humor” in high school. He played various high school sports including football and water polo and was given a full-ride scholarship to Cal Poly Pomona to play for the water polo team while studying architecture. During this time he began playing handball, which would become a life-long passion. He was a lifeguard for the city of San Diego where he developed his drive to watch out for others and save people in distress.\n\nIn 1968 Ron began a relationship with Fay Stassis whom he married in 1975 and eventually divorced in 1998. In 1973 Ron and Fay founded The Screen Machine a silk-screening business, later adding an embroidery business and an event rental space. In 1977 their son David was born, followed by the birth of their daughter Michelle in 1981. Ron was a fun and loving father who inspired his children to be fun-loving while also instilling high moral values and work ethic. During his family-raising years, he managed to build and run his business, support his family, maintain strong friendships and social connections, and become a champion handball player.\n\nFor many years Ron Hall was a name known in handball courts everywhere. He traveled for tournaments and was usually a favorite to make it into the finals whether he was playing singles or doubles. The handball world is a close-knit fraternity and many of his best friends throughout his life were members of the handball community. In 1985 Ron signed up for a family membership to the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club, a premiere tennis and court-sports facility in the heart of San Diego. Ron saw “the club” as an ideal community to support his family’s health and athleticism while also fostering social connections with high-quality people.\n\nThe club became a second home to Ron throughout the rest of his life. As years of high-performance handball took a toll on his hips and slowed his agility he took up tennis, expanding his social circle and developing friendships that would carry him and bring him immense joy and comfort throughout the rest of his life. Ron loved parties and celebrations. Never shy to don an over-the-top costume, was willing to laugh at himself while uplifting everyone around him, and was always willing to go out of his way to bring a smile to someone’s face and let them know they were important to him. While his life was full of notable accomplishments, none were more notable than the wealth of friendships that he forged and maintained throughout his life.\n\nIn 2013 Ron was diagnosed with multi-myeloma cancer and given 5 years to live. Despite the odds, he carried on for another decade, mounting fights against both squamous cell and melanoma skin cancers along the way. When facing an unwinnable fight, some people will choose to throw up their hands and give in, while others will tap into seemingly unending reserves of strength and fortitude, mounting the noblest of fights beyond any reasonable expectation. This was Ron Hall. Tough. Kind. Optimistic. A man who never quit.\n\nIn a county as immense and sprawling as San Diego, Ron could hardly walk down the street without people recognizing him, saying hello, and stopping to chat for a few minutes. He could easily make conversation, crack a joke, and remember everything he ever learned about anyone he ever met. It’s been said that the true measure of wealth is the relationships one makes during their life, and in this way, Ronald Hall was one of the wealthiest people that any of us may ever know.\n\nHe was well-loved and will be remembered as a good man by all who knew him.\n\nRon was preceded in death by his two sisters, Sharon, and Joyce, as well as his parents Vic and Mary. He is survived by his brother Larry Hall, two children, six grandchildren, and innumerable friends.\n\nA Memorial Celebration of Life will be held for Ron on Monday, Dec 18th, 3:00 pm in the Marine Room of the Marina Village Conference Center in San Diego.\n\nFrom Dennis Berger, Claremont, Calif.:\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWilliam ‘Bill” Nye, Coeur d’Alene, Idaho\n\nMay 12, 1940 ~ October 2, 2023\n\nBill was born in Whiteville, N.C. on May 12, 1940 and passed away in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho on Oct 2, 2023.\n\nBill is survived by his 3 children: daughters Marliam Nye and partner Jason Charland (Coeur d’Alene, ID) and Meredith “Meris” Nye (Archdale, NC) and son Baird Nye his wife Deana (Omaha, NB); grandchildren Asha Nye, Noah Dannenberg, Olivia Nye, Jake Dannenberg, Izzy Nye and Liam Nye; step grandchildren Mathew and Brianna Haynes, Ayden Charland; brother in law Martin Beach (Ewa Beach, HI) and his wife Ann and their children Robann Beach and Marty Beach and his wife Phyllis, their children Riley and Kalia. Bill was preceded in death by his wife of 53 years Margor, his parents Ruth and Rube Nye of Orrum, NC.\n\nBill was a great husband, father, friend and mentor to many people during his 83 years. He stayed in contact with people from all parts of his life. He enjoyed playing handball for over 50 years on the courts with friends and traveling to tournaments all over the USA. Bill enjoyed spending time with family and friends. Many were part of his last great adventure this past summer at Topsail Beach.\n\nOur family feels that our Dad was able to enjoy his ‘Celebration of Life’ this summer at the beach. We want to thank everyone for being part of our father’s life.\n\n—\n\nJay Capell, Belvedere, Calif.\n\nMay 5, 1948 ~ October 15, 2023\n\nJay Capell, one of Northern California’s outstanding handball players passed away on October 15, 2023. Outside of winning multiple local and regional titles, Capell won eight Masters level National Four-Wall Championships. He will be missed by us all: loved ones, doubles partners and competitors. Rest In Peace, Jay.\n\nBelow is shared by his brother, Geoff, upon Jay’s induction into the Northern California Handball Hall of Fame.\n\nJay’s athletic career began the first day of kindergarten at Holy Names grammar school in the Sunset District of San Francisco when he kicked the nun in the shin as she welcomed him at the door. That almost ended his Catholic education. He had great foot eye coordination, and no fear. A couple of years later on our way home from the grocery store, we got jumped and he pounded two older guys into submission, while pulling one off me. He had good hand eye coordination, endurance, and no fear. The word got out in the neighborhood, and one of the older boys on the block made the mistake of testing him. The kid ended up running home crying with bite marks on his arm. It became crystal clear, don’t mess with the tough, crazy, guy who is also a little on the mean side. Our days in the city were over as the Capell family moved to Belvedere in Marin County. Jay took up baseball.\n\nIn the Tiburon Little league, he was the first hitter to hit a home run off the leagues all-star pitcher, and the only catcher in the league that could throw out runners stealing second. I knew he had a lot of power and a real strong throwing arm. He hated to lose more than anyone and if that happened he wouldn’t talk for days. Baseball became a big part of his life as he became an all-star in high school and college.\n\nHe had good hand eye coordination, could fight, had a great throwing arm, and no fear. He had all the tools–a computer couldn’t have made a better model. I always thought that the best handball players were former baseball players with bad attitudes, and Jay was no exception. Handball was going to be a good sport for Jay, and that it became.\n\nWhen Jay’s college eligibility was up, he wanted to learn how to play handball. After talking to our Hall of Fame father, Jay decided to start at the South End Rowing Club where play was furious and unforgiving. He won his first novice tournament. Bob Hassing, the handball commissioner at The Olympic Club, asked Jay to join the club as an athletic member and he jumped at the opportunity. Mike De la Pena was his coach and under Mike he won his first Junior Championship club doubles tournament.\n\nHis great play continued. He excelled in Bay Counties, and won the first open doubles Olympic Club Invitational, a prelude to the Hall of Fame Tournament. He won several Olympic Club open doubles and singles championships, dominated open doubles in the Bay Area in the 70s, was once runner up and twice reached the semi finals in the Nationals open doubles. He won several regionals, dominated the Boise and Kawai-Hawaii tournaments, and won the Hall of Fame Masters Doubles Tournament 14 times with various partners. But what he was most proud of was when in 2003, he was voted The Olympic Club player of the year.\n\nHis handball talents are on a par with the best, but in my opinion, one of his greatest accomplishments outside the handball arena, and which supports his toughness, endurance, and no fear, was when he entered a single handed sailboat race. Two years ago, after years of preparation and planning, he started by himself a sailboat race to Hawaii that took fourteen days of non-stop sailing to the finish line in Kawai. To me, that was mightier than climbing Mt. Everest, tougher than the Tour de France, and requiring more stamina than the Adenoid. What an amazing super human feat.\n\nAs Jay and I looked out at the fog shrouded Golden Gate Bridge, as the evening sun poured into the day room at the South Ending Rowing Club, I asked Jay why he played handball, and what he liked most about it. “I loved playing, because for a long time it kept me close to my family. I love the competition and I never took it for granted. I still get butterflies before every tournament game. I always play hard, the only way I know how to play. I just love the rush it gives me, what an incredible incredible rush.”\n\nIn the 2006 Nationals in Los Angeles, Jay won the 55 doubles, the first nationals he has entered since playing in the open division over twenty years ago. He still has it.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nRonald Jay Wenger, Durango, Col.\n\nSeptember 7, 1951 ~ August 10, 2023\n\nRonald Jay Wenger, Durango, Colorado, passed away unexpectedly on August 10, 2023, in Grand Junction, Colorado. He was born to Gilbert Daniel Wenger and Erma Maurine (Clark) Wenger on September 7, 1951, in Salina, Kansas.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 47 years, Linda Diane (Foos) Wenger of Durango, Colorado; three children: Kaettie Renee Wenger (Robert Haines), Durango; Joel Daniel Wenger (Kary Norton), Salt Lake City; and Patrick Jason Wenger (Laura Jones Wenger), Durango. He is also survived by three precious grandchildren, Silas Joel Wenger, Esmé Veronica Wenger, and Forrest Norton Wenger; brother Stanley Ray Wenger (Janelle Gwartney Wenger), Fredericksburg, Texas; sister Janice Kay Wenger (Lynn Behrns), Centralia, Missouri; and many nieces, nephews, and cousins. He was preceded in death by his parents.\n\nRon graduated from Salina High School in 1969, and the University of Kansas in 1973 with a degree in Physical Therapy. Later, he completed a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from the University of St. Augustine. He and Linda owned Wenger Physical Therapy in North Mankato, Minnesota, for 40 years before retiring to Durango, Colorado in 2013. Ron continued to work at Peak Physical Therapy in Durango until his death.\n\nRon had many passions. He loved his wife, children, and grandchildren. Pipa (Ron) grinned each moment he shared with Silas, Esmé, and Forrest whether biking, reading, digging, swimming, or weeding. He coached his children and their friends in soccer. Ron hiked, climbed, and rolled in the wildflowers of the Rockies. He loved biking with friends and racing in the Iron Horse every year. Pipa/Dad treasured his time with family and found a great zest for life in everything he did. He was generous with his many talents, assisted thousands of patients back to health, and never knew a stranger.\n\nA private celebration of life will be held in September. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to Durango DEVO (our local youth cycling development program): https://durangodevo.com/donate/. (Link from memorialsource.com).\n\nA tribute to Ron Wenger from friend, Rick McKernan of Columbia, Mo.\n\nGreetings from an aging handball player.\n\nDecades ago in college in 1972 a ragtag group of handballers from the University of Kansas decided to crash the national collegiate tournament in Lake Forest, IL. And as a fluke, we took home the trophy for third place team. The impetus for this event was a man named Ron Wenger from Salina, KS, who organized and shepherded this event on behalf of our college. I couldn’t begin to recount Ron’s history in the handball world, but I can say how his passion for handball had a profound effect on my own life throughout the years.\n\nAs my roommate in college, Ron taught me to play and somehow coerced me to get up before any sane person should have been awake and go to the gym to play. Even though KU did not officially have a collegiate handball “team,” Ron nevertheless decided to host the “Big 8 Handball Tournament,” which after a scolding from the KU Athletic Department for claiming it to be a Big 8 Tourney, was changed to be the “Crazy 8 Handball Tournament” which garnered entries from five of the Big 8 schools at that time.\n\nA year later, in 1972, Ron decided we should go to Lake Forest, IL, and enter the National Collegiate Handball Tournament… sans official recognition from our own college… and sans a coach. Our KU team consisted of: A Singles: Mike Gardner, B Singles Ron Wenger, and Doubles Adam Geiger and myself, Rick McKernan. Frankly, Adam and I added little value other than completing the roster slots for completing us as a team. Thanks to the points accumulated by Gardner and Wenger, our meager team took home third place in the tournament despite no coach, no scholarships, and no financial support. This was all on Ron Wenger.\n\nFor me personally, the sport of handball (thanks to Ron) had a profound roll in my life and opened many doors. Years later I lived and worked in Europe, and US military installations were the only place to find handball courts. Not only that, almost the only handball players in Europe were US flag officers, i.e, all the generals. Thanks to Ron’s browbeating me to play at Zero Dark Thirty in college, I had the good fortune to play regularly with our top military officers in Europe, including the USAREUR Commander-In-Chief and later with the US military’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs-Of-Staff. Among those handball players was the US Army’s first black 4-Star General, Roscoe Robinson.\n\nI know Ron taught and mentored many other handball players over his lifetime; I just hope there is at least one handball court in heaven to greet him when God called Ron to be on His team August 10, 2023. No more court hinders, just killshots. Thanks, Ron.\n\nIf there were anyone worthy of recognition by the USHA, Ron, as a handballer, as a person, as a teacher… and as a friend, would be that person.\n\nMay 2023\n\nFred Bowler, Wasaga Beach, Ontario, CANADA\n\nMarch 21, 1945 ~ May 16, 2023\n\nFred Bowler passed with his family by his side at the Collingwood General & Marine Hospital on Tuesday May 16, 2023.\n\nFred, of Wasaga Beach, was the beloved husband of Mary, loving father of Ryan (Nickie), dear son-in-law to Betty, cherished brother-in-law to Dawn (Barry), and Gary (Vanessa), and devoted uncle to Jason & Dale.\n\nFred was an avid handball player, and beloved member of the handball community.

He was a practicing Chiropractor for 39 years before suddenly falling ill to cancer. He loved going to his practice each day and caring for his patients.\n\nHe also was an avid handball player and enjoyed the sport and community of players throughout his adult life.

He later worked as a Deputy Land Surveyor for the County of San Bernardino for over three decades. But it was his passion for handball that truly set him apart.\n\nRick was a handball enthusiast who played a crucial role in introducing and popularizing the sport in the Inland Empire (Southern California). He was an inspiration and a mentor to countless people in his community, especially the younger generations who looked up to him as a role model.\n\nRick’s contributions to the sport were significant, and he was entrusted with organizing the annual “16 de Septiembre Singles Handball Tournament” at the Downtown San Bernardino YMCA. Under his leadership, the tournament became a thriving event that brought together handball enthusiasts from all over the region. Rick’s dedication to the sport was unmatched, and his passion for it was contagious. He inspired those around him to take up the sport and encouraged them to follow in his footsteps.\n\nRick is survived by his two sons Ricardo and Robert Flores, his sister Molly Touchette, six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. Rick was preceded in death by his wife Rachel Flores, his parents Isaac and Rosa Flores his siblings Mary Martin, Phillis Vasquez, and Benny Flores, and two great-grandchildren.\n\nWhile Rick will be dearly missed by his family and friends, his legacy as a handball player and mentor will live on for generations to come.\n\nJames V.

Raquel graduated Martin Luther King High School, was a Lifeguard became a Registered Dietitian and ultimately fulfilled her dream to become a physician.\n\nRaquel completed medical school at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) and completed her residency in Family Medicine at St. John’s Episcopal Hospital, NY, and a fellowship in Urgent Care Medicine.

On March 20th, Danny Maroney passed from a heart attack two weeks from his 73rd birthday.\n\nFor more than 15 years Maroney was near the top of the 1-wall game. In 1977, ’79, and ’82 he was a national 1-wall singles semi-finalist, and in ’81 he was national 1-wall singles runner-up. In national doubles Danny reached the semifinal round in ’86 and ’91 and in 1990, teamed with Eric Klarman, he was National 1-wall Open Doubles champion.\n\nRemaining in top condition as he aged, he went on to champion ten times in National Masters 1-wall Singles, twice in National Masters 3-wall Singles, and once in National 3-wall Doubles elevating him to the title of National Hall of Fame Grandmaster. He amassed 15 age division titles in one-wall and three-wall national competition.\n\nWhen a young man he was proficient in many sports: martial arts, wrestling, soccer, hockey, bowling, baseball, and his specialty – track. While he gave up wrestling early on because of unwanted weight loss, he ran the hundred dash in 10:25 and the 220 in 21:10. At high school graduation he was awarded the Kennedy Distinguished Athlete Award for four years of excellence in sports. He continued to cycle for the duration of his handball career and beyond. That laudable career ended only while on his bike, he suffered a serious collision with a truck.\n\nSince word of his passing, there has been an outpouring of emotion and recognition of Danny’s achievements in handball. Masters champion Dennis Uffer referred to him as a “great handball player and a great friend.” National Hall of Fame contributor Paul Williams said, “Danny was always friendly, fair and ready to assist.” National Hall of Fame player Howie Eisenberg called Danny “a fine handball player, good guy – a warm and happy presence on and off the court.” All who knew him have responded similarly.\n\nI remember him vividly in that very light. We were fierce rivals on the singles court, but fast friends off it. Perhaps his good friend, Eric Klarman, who began playing singles with Danny when Eric was 17, and played more practice games with him than anyone, said it best: “Danny had a warm heart and a fantastic sense of humor. We were the closest of friends.”\n\nDanny spent 35 years in sales of janitorial products rising to vice-president of his company. He is survived by his wife, Marie, and his son and namesake Dan, whom he called “my pride and joy.”\n\n-Dan Flickstein\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nJim Barnett, Missoula, Mont.\n\nMay 13, 1946 ~ February 23, 2023\n\nJim Barnett was born in Hamilton, Montana in 1946 and moved to Long Beach, Calif. during his pre-teens. In the late 1960s, he started playing handball as a student at Cal State University of Long Beach and played out of the Long Beach Athletic Club. He would later become known as Barney around the handball circuits and always enjoyed the camaraderie among its community and its competitors.

Vance was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on June 1, 1949, and graduated from Ainsworth High School in Flint, Michigan. Vance spent three years (1971-1974) in the U.S. Army, serving in the 82nd Airborne. After service, he went on to get an economics degree from University of California in Riverside and an MBA from the University of Oregon in Eugene. Vance spent the next 30+ years working with Caterpillar. He lived in Tempe, Arizona, for nine years and settled in Peoria, Illinois in 1991.\n\nVance married Constance Goetz McInnis in 1976 and leaves behind Constance, his three children: Erin Reese (married to Joe Reese), Grant McInnis (married to Whitney Handegan McInnis), and Clair McInnis.

Thanksgivings were also a highlight when as many as 30 family members came from several states to celebrate each year.\n\nVance’s other passion was playing handball. He competed at the national level winning 23 age group championships. He made and enjoyed many friends from around the country through handball.

He and his wife Joan were fixtures at the tournament desk and often helped organize the matches, schedules and score cards at the USHA office before the tournament. They were awarded the Robert W. Kendler Award in 2004 to recognize their tremendous volunteer work.\n\nAn American Hero, Collegiate All-American Athlete, National Handball Champion and Grand Master (35 National Titles), Coach, Teacher, Mentor, Volunteer, Father and Husband. Charlie was also a member of the USA Lacrosse Hall of Fame, and while serving in the Airforce, he was awarded two Silver Stars and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nCharlie was a friend to whomever he’d meet, especially if it were on a handball court. After he would best his opponents, he’d often smile and offer a tip, “Now how did I beat you?”\n\nWe are thankful to have enjoyed Charlie through Handball and at the Tucson Racquet Club throughout his life and honored to have called him, “Friend.” Godspeed, Col. Wicker.\n\nBurial will take place at East Lawn Palms Mortuary & Cemetery in Tucson, Arizona on February 11 at 9 a.m. There will be a reception afterward at the funeral home with refreshments. (No formal service, per Charlie’s wishes).\n\nDecember 2022\n\nKenneth Dannenbaum, Phoenix, Ariz.\n\nOctober 30, 1948 ~ December 31, 2022\n\nKen Dannenbaum passed away on December 31, 2022. For those who knew Ken, he was a tremendous supporter of local, often disadvantaged youth, showing them that there was a better path they could follow–often using handball as a vehicle to leading a positive life.\n\nHis generosity and care for others had no limits. Ken, along with other business partners founded the Success4Kids youth handball program in 2001. His vision was to help disadvantaged youth to participate in a physical, goal-oriented activity after school. Few of these youth participated in inter-scholastic sports and were at risk to make poor choices with their free time. School organized sports programs are competitive and expensive; by their very nature, they exclude the less gifted athletes. That population is the one Success4Kids targets: the ones left behind. Handball filled that need.\n\nIn December of 2001, Ken helped organize one of the largest USHA Juniors events in history with over 200 junior players competing. He will be remembered for his endearing kindness and generosity to anyone he met.\n\nTribute to Ken Dannenbaum by Jesse Aranda\n\nStephen Joel August, Sherman Oaks, Calif.\n\nApril 13, 1943 ~ Dec. 26, 2022\n\nStephen Joel August, much loved husband, father and grandfather, died on Monday, December 26, 2022, after a hard-fought battle with amyloidosis. Born April 13, 1943, in Detroit, MI, he was the son of Alvin August and Rosalind (Arfa)August. He was raised in Farmington, MI, in his family home that fondly was known as the Turtle Rock house, where he excelled in school and also distinguished himself as a nationally ranked handball player.\n\nSteve won championships at the junior, collegiate and singles levels, then later in life the Masters Championship, 16 years after he last played. In 2011, his incredible handball career was recognized by his induction into the US Handball Association Hall of Fame. Steve graduated from the University of Michigan at the top of his class with a BS and MD in an accelerated seven-year program. Steve served in the US Army, where he leveraged his handball skills to help secure his first choice for his residency and internship moving to Los Angeles, CA in 1969.\n\nSteve later became an ophthalmologist specializing in cataract surgery and opened a private practice in Marina Del Rey. His practice grew and he was adored by his patients and staff alike. Steve served as the Chief of Staff and Chief of Surgery at Daniel Freeman Hospital and sat on multiple medical boards. In addition to his highly successful medical career, he loved adventure and life outdoors. He spent his free time riding motorcycles and ATVs, snow skiing, water skiing, and boating. In his final years, he spent most of his time at his home in Lake Tahoe. He relished his time on the lake. In 2006 he married the love of his life, Adria Later, and built a beautiful life with their merged families. Steve will be remembered for his intelligence, being a voracious reader and deep thinker, his keen fashion sense, his athleticism, and above all, his charming personality.\n\nSteve is survived by his beloved wife, Adria August of Los Angeles, CA; daughters, Julie (Scott) Rizzo of Charlotte, NC, and Jodi (Brad) Lebow of Baltimore, MD; stepson Matt (Sara) Licklider of Healdsburg, CA; four grandchildren, Kaitlin Lebow, Brooks Lebow, Jason Rizzo and Brendan Rizzo. In addition, he leaves his siblings, Cherie (Perry) Krauss of Calabasas, CA, and Larry (Marcia) August of Rancho Palos Verdes, CA, and nephews Daniel Krauss, David Krauss, Scott August and Geoff August.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made in his memory to Keep Tahoe Blue at keeptahoeblue.org or Amyloidosis Research Consortium at arci.org\n\nNovember 2022\n\nJohn George “Jack” Carkeek, Phoenix, Ariz.\n\nFeb. 4, 1941 ~ Nov. 15, 2022\n\nJohn George Carkeek died Nov. 15 after a seven-month battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma. He was 81.\n\nKnown throughout his life as Jack, he was born Feb. 4, 1941, in Chicago to Lloyd and Margaret Carkeek. Jack grew up on the North Side of the city. He attended DePaul Academy and received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology. Jack worked as an engineer for his entire career, first at the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District, then at Consoer Townsend and finally at Westinghouse.\n\nHis job took him and his late wife, Beverly, to Phoenix, where they relocated in 1989. He traveled extensively throughout the West for work in the 1990s and was instrumental in planning the construction of Denver International Airport. He retired in 2002.\n\nIn retirement, Jack played golf as often as six days a week and spent time at sports betting establishments. He loved attending Arizona Coyotes games, enjoyed watching the NHL on TV and adored watching his grandsons play hockey and baseball. He loved a good steak and would never say no to a Bud Light.\n\nJack was a man of few words — but always the first to speak up and offer help whenever anyone in the family needed it. To his three siblings, he was the big brother you always knew was there if you ever needed support in any way. Perhaps that is not surprising from a man who attended Mass nearly every day.\n\nConsistent with the worldview of an engineer, Jack had a phenomenal mind for numbers. He was the most analytical person any of us knew and quickly grasped complex concepts such as compound interest, tax-deferred accounts and bond yields.\n\nJack was an accomplished athlete. He led DePaul’s drive to the 1959 Chicago Catholic League basketball title. Jack went on to play college basketball at IIT, where he also starred on the bowling team. As an adult, he became an expert skier and a passionate handball player, winning seven national 50-or-older doubles championships with partner Don Ardito.\n\nJack was preceded in death by his wife of 55 years, Beverly, and son Jerry. He is survived by his son, Jim (Kristin) Carkeek, and grandsons Jon (Kim) Carkeek and Sam Carkeek; two sisters, Ginny (Dave) Murray and Pat McLeish; a brother, Tom Carkeek; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nVisitation will be from 4 to 6 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 4, and Hansen Mortuary, 8314 N. Seventh St., Phoenix, with a funeral mass at 10:30 a.m. Monday, Dec. 5, at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church, 3801 E. Greenway Rd., Phoenix. Burial will be private. Donations may be made to the local hospice organization of your choice.\n\nAnthony F. Raimondo, Columbus, Neb.\n\nJuly 24, 1939 ~ November 9, 2022\n\nAnthony F. Raimondo, 83, of Columbus, Nebraska, and Lakewood Ranch, Florida, died Wednesday, November 9, in Lakewood Ranch, Florida.\n\nAnthony F. Raimondo “TR” was born on July 24, 1939, in Buffalo, New York, as an only child to Carmela (Turchiarelli) and Felix “Phil” Raimondo. TR graduated from South Park High School in 1957, where he met the love of his life, Jeanne English. TR and Jeanne dated until their wedding on August 27, 1960.\n\nTR attended Michigan Technology University, receiving his BSME in 1962, while Jeanne worked as an AT&T switchboard operator. After completing college, TR took a job with General Motors and moved back to Buffalo, New York. In 1969, TR left GM and started at Moog, an aerospace company. TR received his MBA degree from the University of Rochester in 1972.\n\nIn 1976, the Raimondo family moved to Omaha, Nebraska, when TR took a job with the Sperry Corporation as General Manager of Vickers. They eventually found their way to Behlen Mfg. Co. in Columbus, Nebraska in 1982, when TR started as a General Manager for Wickes Corporation. In 1984 TR led a management buyout with Richard Casey, Stephen McGill, and Bob Theilen, as Behlen experienced major losses due to market changes, and Wickes emerged from Chapter 11. TR went on to lead a successful turnaround of the company. Behlen currently has six manufacturing facilities across the United States and more than 1080 Partners in Progress (employees). Today, the Raimondo family owns Behlen Mfg. Co., and they are committed to growing the company and supporting the Columbus community.\n\nTR and Jeanne had four wonderful children: Philip, Tony Jr., Linda, and Diana. TR and his family are proponents of lifelong learning as all four children, and TR hold Master’s degrees, and Jeanne even earned a Bachelor’s degree at age 60! TR had uncompromising core values, extraordinary leadership skills, a strong spiritual foundation, and enjoyed traveling around the globe for business and fun. Family, faith, and love were of utmost importance to TR and Jeanne.\n\nTR was the beloved husband to the late Jeanne for nearly 59 years; devoted father of the late Philip M. Raimondo (Mary), Anthony F. Raimondo, Jr. (Sharon), and Linda C. Bock (Tom), all of Columbus; and Diana J. Raimondo of Chicago, Illinois; loving grandfather of Rachel Hays (Brandon), Matthew Raimondo (Kayla), Nicholas Raimondo (Katy), Patrick Raimondo (Kayla), Natalie Raimondo, Kellen Raimondo, Leo Raimondo, Cody Myers (Robyn), Paxton Myers, Tanner Bock (Lily), Tayler Bock (Amanda), Nahom “Enzo” Montalto, as well as the late Luca and late Santino Luca Montalto. TR was the proud great-grandfather of Henry, Emma, Colin, Emersyn, Madeline, Sophia, Lennon, Lyla, Tucker and Turner.\n\nTR joins his wife, Marion “Jeanne” English, his mother, Carmela Turchiarelli, his father, Felix “Phil” Raimondo, as well as his eldest son, Philip Raimondo, in heaven.\n\nTR’s Legacy\n\nDuring TR’s tenure at Behlen Mfg. Co., retiring as Chairman Emeritus in 2019, TR held Government, National, State, and Community Board positions, earning several distinguished awards. Not to mention competing on the national circuit in his favorite sport, handball – winning his last doubles tournament at the age of 81, with his handball partner, Lyle Burbach.\n\nOf TR’s many accomplishments and awards, notable Awards include National winner of the Inc.

And for that, we are grateful.\n\nVisit the legacy page for Tony Raimondo HERE.\n\nAugust 2022\n\nEmil “Butch” Roper, Roseburg, Or.\n\nJune 25, 1935 ~ August 13, 2022\n\nOn August 13, Lt Colonel Emil (Butch) Roper left this world to commence his next grand adventure. He was surrounded by his family and passed away after a short stay in the hospital. As always Butch was a bit impatient, and took this step sooner than his family had hoped.\n\nBorn in Hobbs, New Mexico in 1935 to Tom and Ruth Roper, Butch spent his early childhood learning to be independent by roaming the Louisiana Coast with little parental oversight. His family then moved to Santa Monica, California where he graduated from high school and UCLA. In those years, Butch, his brother Dix, and sister Carol spent as much time as possible on the beach. This was where he met his first wife, Linda. They were married in 1962 and had two sons.\n\nButch was deployed twice to Vietnam and received the Purple Heart after being injured during a fire-fight. Despite these trials, he returned to the states with the same energy and enthusiasm with which he left. During his 30-year career in the Army, he became a Ranger, was in the Special Forces, and was a Company Commander. He was a true Patriot who didn’t always agree with day-to-day politics, but thought the principles this country stood for were worth fighting and dying for.\n\nDue in part to the challenges of military life, he was divorced soon after the Vietnam War ended.\n\nThus began his role as a single father of two teenage sons. Not only was he able to guide two sons through high school (barely) but was able to find and marry his true love, Ruth. Together, they ushered another son through high school.\n\nBeyond work and taking care of his family, Butch spent much of his free time confined within the four walls of a handball court or in the vastness of the ocean spearfishing. In both arenas, there were few that were better. He competed at the national level in handball and speared huge wahoo and yellowtail off the coast of Mexico and Panama. It is an understatement to say he was a force of nature. Few people who met him will forget him. His prescription for most maladies in life was exercise. “How many push-ups can you do” was a question his sons and grandchildren were consistently asked.\n\nFollowing the death of his mother and father in Roseburg, he and his wife returned to live in Douglas County. They spent 20 years living along Little River, in Glide, and in Roseburg. Regardless of where he was, a near daily pilgrimage was made to the YMCA to improve his handball skills. Butch and Ruth hosted several family reunions at their home along the North Umpqua River. These events always included discharging firearms, launching bottle rockets, catching crawdads, rafting, and barbeques.\n\nWhile getting him to spend money could be herculean task, he was generous with his time and love. He mentored many young men towards a greater confidence in themselves and a career in the military. His faith grew with age as he came to better understand the value of truth of Christ’s teaching in his and other’s lives.\n\nButch left behind his wife (Ruth), sister (Carol/Al), three sons (Brett/Jordy, Kirk/Leah, Chris/Miyoko), four grandsons (Hunter, Kellen, Heath, Kai), a granddaughter (Kyra) and a list of friends that stretched from coast-to-coast. He will no longer be able to lead us on adventures; which we will sorely miss. His family is sure that instead of marking his passing with flowers, he would prefer that you undertake a challenging trip or helpful task while holding him in your heart. For those of you reading this who never met him, we wish you had, because your life would’ve been better for it.\n\nButch’s life will be celebrated on September 17 in Roseburg, Oregon at 2:00 at Wellspring Bible Fellowship. Watch a quick tribute to Butch’s life HERE.\n\nJuly 2022\n\nCarl “Bert” Huether, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nAugust 22, 1937 ~ July 17, 2022\n\nBert grew up in Clifton, a suburb north of Cincinnati with a sister, Lou (nee Crawford) and parents Carl and Gertrude Huether. He and Carol graduated from Hughes High School where he played baseball, bowled, and played the trombone. Bert graduated from The Ohio State University in 1959 where he played two years of baseball and marched for one year in The Best D*** Band in the Land (TBDBITL).\n\nBert and Carol also married in 1959 before driving across country so he could fulfill his U.S. Navy responsibilities (two years) on Kodiak Island, Alaska. They were introduced to wonderful fishing, digging clams and still have friends that they made during that time. Bert had wanted to go to graduate school and after the navy, they moved to North Carolina where he got his master’s in science. They then packed a trailer and left for California along with their first child and dog. He graduated with his PhD in Genetics in 1966 and took a position at the University of Cincinnati. They packed up the trailer again and left for Cincinnati with two children and the same dog. He spent the next 40 years at UC as a professor of biology. He was proud of his teaching (Human Genetics and Biology in a Human Context) which reached thousands of students. Bert also helped in developing the UC greenhouse, conducting teacher institutes (funded by the National Science Foundation), creating the Academy of Fellows for Teaching and Learning (AFTL), expanding Arts and Sciences, helping the Honors College to be a university-wide system and establishing the Genetic Counseling program, now housed at Children’s Hospital.\n\nAfter retiring, he got involved with the UC Emerita Board and helped expand and guide it to its present state. From college through his early eighties, Bert enjoyed playing handball with friends which were always competitive matches that usually ended with a lunch. He also coached his son’s and daughter’s baseball teams and even tried his hand at soccer, which at the time he knew little about. Bert was incredibly giving of his time and effort to numerous organizations. In retirement, he became a Master Gardener and volunteered at the Cincinnati Zoo for many years before health issues became a problem. He loved being out in nature and weekends could find him chopping wood for the fireplace or adding trees and plants to their large yard. His friends and family were incredibly important to him and Bert truly enjoyed finding out about people’s lives. He loved asking questions, especially ones dealing with life goals, such as “what do you want to do with your life?” Each of his grandchildren can attest to his inquisitive nature! Bert will be truly missed by those who knew him.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Genetic Counseling Program at Children’s Hospital: (https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/education/clinical/student-grad/genetic-counseling/endowment, click, “make a gift now” or to the UC Emeriti Board: (www.foundation.uc.edu/give, select “search funds by name” and enter “Emeriti Scholarship” (S201318).

His connection to UNH brought him back where he worked as Supervisor for dinning service for the past 10 years.\n\nHe enjoyed the outdoors, hiking, running, and playing sports. His love for the sport of Handball was what he practiced weekly preparing for an upcoming tournament in Seattle Washington in June 2022.

Henson, Ph.D. 77, of Bonita Springs, FL died on April 11, 2022 in Naples, FL. Don was born on May 21, 1944 in Sterling, IL a son of the late Kermit and Charlotte (Scott) Henson. He grew up in Sterling, lived in Southern Illinois and then Springfield until he became a resident of Bonita Springs in June of 2018.\n\nHe received his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Louisiana State University in 1968. He continued his education at Southern Illinois University where he earned his Master’s in Behavior Modification in 1970 and his Ph.D. in Psychology in 1977.\n\nHis career began while he was still a student. He worked as a Graduate Research Assistant, a Visiting Assistant Professor, Research Associate, Behavioral Scientist, and Staff Psychologist. In 1983, he began working as a Medical Consultant with the Illinois Department of Human Services, Disability Determination Services, in Springfield, IL. He held that position until his retirement in 2018. He was also a member of the American Psychological Association and the Illinois Psychological Association.\n\nDon is survived by his loving wife of 29 years, Stefany J. Henson (Steingraber) of Bonita Springs, FL; his three brothers, John Henson (Marie) of Sterling, IL, Tom Henson (Marlys) of Mesa, AZ and David Henson (Suzanne) of Chicago and his sister, Karen Garza (Robert) of Sterling, IL. Also four daughters, Michelle Petermeyer (Rick) of Springfield, IL, Melanie Derry (John) of Asheville, NC, Shannon Hemberger (Scott) of Springfield, Trisha Hibbs (John) of Orangevale, CA and seven grandchildren, Lauren, Zachary, Lilly, Quentin, Delaney, Callum, Phoebe and several nieces and nephews.\n\nDon’s pursuits were many and varied but handball in all its forms was his ongoing passion. The kingpin of Springfield handball, he was personally responsible for the “Capital Punishment Doubles” tourney. Always a superb athlete, when the occasional injury and advancing age began to supplant his youth, his guile and street-savvy made him a true chess master on the court earning him the nickname “el Gato” among his opponents. Small wonder that he began and ended his day thinking about his next game. Don loved handball. And handball loved Don. He will be missed by many.\n\nServices for Don are being scheduled for later this summer in both Springfield and Sterling, IL and will be announced at a later date.\n\nMemorial contributions in Don’s name may be made to the United States Handball Association, 2333 N.

He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Anne, their six children: Angela (Phillip), John (Patricia), Elena, Paul, Jim (Moira) and Matt (Kim), his five grandchildren: Danielle (Christopher), Nicholas, Theresa (Joseph), Laura and Marcus, as well as his six great-grandchildren: Alexander, Joseph, Giovanni, Finn, Philip and Josephine. He is also survived by his younger brother, Alberto (Phyllis) as well as nieces, nephews, cousins and second cousins too innumerable to count. He joins, now, his parents, Amelia and Felice, his late first wife Ruth (mother to Angela and John), and his brothers Romeo and Guido.\n\nThroughout his 92 years, Angelo lived by a simple rule: When you have more than you need, build a longer table, not a higher fence. In every way that he lived, Angelo exemplified this ideal, and his effect will be felt and remembered for years to come not only within his family, but the greater Detroit community in which he lived. Angelo worked for 60 years with the Internal Revenue Service, and during his employment there he would regularly give his own vacation time to other coworkers in need. He took two buses daily to get to and from work, and when it came time for him to retire – at the spry young age of 86 – the IRS and SMART (Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation) honored him with one last ride, filled with regular riders who’d gotten to know him over decades, as well as a pair of seats pulled directly from a bus as a memento. Angelo loved to joke that he’d outlived more than a few drivers on his regular route, and it’s no doubt the truth.\n\nAngelo loved kids. For years, he could be seen driving a bright orange delivery truck – the famous Pop Truck – around to baseball games in his neighborhood, selling candy and soda to the players and spectators. This was officially a way to help defray league costs, but anyone who knew Angelo would say he did it because he loved making kids happy. When his first great-grandchild was born, the absolute delight on his face couldn’t be denied, and he was in love.\n\nAngelo loved feeding people. His daughter, Elena, and her friends, until just a few years ago, would see him at their softball games, passing out apples and making everyone happy. If you’ve ever attended a Brother Rice football game, coached for 44 years by his younger brother Al, you’ve probably received a sandwich from him – a sandwich that no doubt lives in your memory to this day. For decades, Angelo and the family ran an Italian sausage stand at the St. Raymond Apple Harvest Festival, held every September alongside the Fracassa family’s dear friends (and fierce sausage competitors) the Rosenburgs and longtime buddies. If you couldn’t pay for a sausage sandwich, you got one anyway. Every year for Christmas, he gifted his oldest grandchild, Danielle, with a jar of her favorite chocolate covered raisins. When his daughter-in-law Moira mentioned once that she liked the mushrooms he’d made for a family dinner, he proceeded to make them every time the family ate together. These were things he did without thinking – it was more important to him that someone else was fed than it was to make a couple dollars, or make an extra side dish for dinner.\n\nAngelo was stubborn. His grandchildren had never known him not to walk with a cane – sometimes two canes – because he was just too stubborn to get the hip replacement he needed, let alone take anything for the discomfort he felt every day. It wasn’t until the age of 80 that he finally agreed to have the hip replacement surgery he needed for decades. He still used a cane after the replacement, but the minor victory of getting Angelo to listen to a doctor’s orders was worth it.\n\nAngelo loved his family. In 2013, the Fracassa family traveled to Italy for two weeks, the first time Angelo had been there since he served in the Korean War, where he specialized in counterintelligence, and learned safe cracking and lock picking. The family visited Supino, the hometown of Angelo’s parents, and had an audience with the mayor, as well as visiting with several cousins and navigating the winding mountain streets to find his parents’ former home. He walked through ancient villages, and cooked huge meals for the family at night, and even enjoyed a couple glasses of wine (the rest of the family enjoyed several bottles at these meals). Throughout the trip, Angelo could be found sitting in front of the local convenience store, with other elderly Italian men, watching the townspeople go by and enjoying the day.\n\nHas it been said that Angelo loved feeding people? During the family’s yearly camping trips to Lake Superior, Angelo would, without complaint, organize and prepare huge meals for everyone in the campsite, all trucked up to Canada in a trailer painted like the Italian flag. On holidays, the family would gather to make pizza from scratch, or lasagna, or pasta, or giant sandwiches. Inevitably, at the end of these meals, Angelo could be seen eating any remaining dinner salad from a family-sized bowl. He loved to cook, and friends and family would request his skills for a day of making gnocchi or polenta.\n\nHas it been said that Angelo was stubborn? No one could forget his wallet: held gamely closed with rubber bands and stuffed with so many receipts and photos, it was a wonder he could even sit down. When asked by his grandchildren why he kept everything – literally, everything – his simple reply was that maybe he’d need it one day.\n\nAll the stories, all the memories and anecdotes and little slivers of Angelo’s personality – they don’t even begin to add up to who he was. He was a presence both large and comforting, and he will be missed every day. He touched the lives of everyone he met, and his love of food, his love of family, his need to take care of everyone around him – these are his legacy. These are the important things, the ways he’ll be remembered, not just by his family, but by anyone who ever had the pleasure of meeting him.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nEdward Abourjilie, Richmond, Va.\n\nDecember 12, 1937- February 11, 2022\n\nThe Handball Family had one of its most fervent players and supporters die on February 11, 2022. Ed Abourjilie passed away at age 84. He played handball for 60 years and loved every minute on the court.\n\nEd was a United States Marine and a talented athlete who started in the boxing ring. Only his family and friends rated his affection above handball. Ed was an outstanding singles and doubles player winning many championships on the state and national levels. He was known as a fierce competitor with a deadly back-wall shot, but he was always a gentelman upon leaving the court. In addition to his deadly corner shots, he was famous for saying “that was a nice shot” followed by a gentleman’s pat on the back of his opponent. Ed played handball until the last 2 years of his life.\n\nEd Abourjilie will always be known and appreciated for his talent on the court, his integrity, his devotion to the game of handball, and being a kind and compassionate man. In appreciation of his love of “the Elite game” his handball partners in Richmond, Virginia have made a monetary contribution in his honor to the advancement of handball among young players. Ed would want handball to live forever.\n\nFrom “The Richmond Handball Group” – Harry Baldwin, Jim Carruthers, Mike Griffin, George Holzbach, Dave Pierpont, Tom Rhodes, Ed Spede\n\nDecember 2021\n\nJohn Arthur Reese, Jr., Salem, Ore.\n\nSept. 18, 1936 ~ Dec. 28, 2021\n\nJohn Arthur Reese, Jr. was born to John, Sr. and Tillie Graman Reese on September 18, 1936 in Yankton, South Dakota. His early years were spent traveling around the Midwest with his parents because his dad was a professional drummer, touring with the Lawrence Welk Orchestra.\n\nIn 1946, the family moved west and settled in Salem, OR joining several members of his mother’s family. Josh graduated from Sacred Heart High School in 1954. Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the Marine Corps and went to San Diego for basic training. While in boot camp, the recruits were given a chance to apply for the flight program, as the military needed pilots at that time. Josh applied and was accepted. He received his wings and commission as a Second Lieutenant, and was designated an officer and a gentleman of the United States Marine Corps in 1956.\n\nFor the next twenty-one years, Josh was an active-duty Marine officer and a fighter pilot. He flew the FJ-3, the F-11, the F-8, and the F-4. His duty stations included MCAS Opa-laka FL; NAS Atsugi Japan; NAS Kingsville TX; MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Oahu HI; MCAS Cherry Point NC; MCAS El Toro CA; MCB Quantico VA; and Marine Corps Headquarters/The Pentagon, Washington D.C.; plus two combat tours to Vietnam.\n\nWhile at El Toro, he was the Commanding Officer of Marine Air Base Squadron-11. Following that, he was the Commanding Officer of VMFA 314 (Black Knights) from April 1973 until July 1974. He earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and a Master’s Degree in Human Resource Management through military programs. Josh and his wife, Barbara, were married in Kingsville, TX in 1964. They had celebrated their 57 wedding anniversary in 2021. Over the years, the couple regularly attended reunions for Josh’s various Marine Corps squadrons.\n\nJosh retired from the Marine Corps in 1977, and the Reese Family, which now included three daughters, moved back to Oregon to be near Josh’s relatives, and settled in the Spring Valley area of West Salem. Josh loved his small farm and spent many years gardening and raising livestock. The family was involved in Polk County 4-H activities. He was a Master Gardener, a volunteer firefighter, and a member of the Spring Valley Community Association.\n\nAfter he came home to Salem, Josh was active with his Sacred Heart High School graduating class, organizing and participating in their many reunions and get-togethers, all of which were very dear to his heart.\n\nHe also taught management classes for Linn-Benton Community College and was the Executive Director of Oregon Games for the Physically Limited, a non-profit organization that provided athletic and sports opportunities for Oregonians of all ages with physical disabilities. He was proud of the organization and was happy to offer the athletes with disabilities the chance to participate in sports.\n\nIn the 1980s, Josh became an advocate for peace and was active in the nuclear-freeze movement. He taught his children to respect all living things and was a staunch supporter of civil rights, animal rights, and the environment. He was a member of the Salem Humanists and a founding-member and volunteer for Oregonians for Science and Reason.\n\nJosh’s one great love (other than his wife and children) was handball. He first learned to play when he was about 20 years old, and played the game non-stop for the rest of his life, until COVID interfered in 2020. Over the years he was involved in many tournaments, both as an organizer and as a participant. In 2009, the World Handball Championships were held in Portland, and he won in his age bracket, becoming a World Champion.\n\nJosh created his whole life as being of service – serving his country, his family, and his community – and he was a life-long learner, full of curiosity about the world. He taught himself to play the guitar, the ukulele, and he took piano lessons for many years. He took painting classes and horseback riding lessons; he practiced speaking Spanish whenever he had the chance; he excelled playing bridge, poker, and chess. One of the first people to get a personal computer when they became available, Josh was always up-to-date with the latest technology and spent many an evening playing strategic, action role-playing video games.\n\nJosh passed away from complications after surgery on December 28, 2021 in Portland. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; daughters Elisabeth, Mary and Julia; son-in-law Frank (Mary’s husband); his brother David; a niece and two nephews, and a group of Graman Cousins.\n\nOne-of-a kind and irreplaceable, Josh will be sorely missed by so many. His family intends to honor him by carrying on and growing his legacy of responsibility, curiosity, creativity, and kindness.\n\nBurial will be in the spring at the Spring Valley Cemetery, with full military honors.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please make a donation to an organization that you believe is making a difference in the world, or you could simply perform a random act of kindness as you go about your daily life.\n\nLarry K. Shankweiler, Allentown, Pa.\n\nJan. 11, 1933 ~ Dec. 13, 2021\n\nLarry K. Shankweiler, 88, of Allentown, passed away December 13, 2021 in Whitehall Manor. He was the loving husband of the late Nedy C. (Claman) Shankweiler. Born in Allentown, he was the son of the late Kermit D. and Marion (Wuchter) Shankweiler. Larry graduated from Allentown High School in 1950. He served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. He taught for 31 years as an instructor for Lehigh Valley Vocational School. Larry belonged to the Allentown YMCA and was a U.S. Handball member. He will be deeply missed.\n\nSurvivors: son- Larry S. and wife Susan Shankweiler of Manhattan, KS, daughter- Linda S. Shankweiler and husband Scott Burnet of Allentown, grandchildren Austin and Caylin, nieces and nephews- Ann Louise Carpenter, Stephen F. Carpenter, Paula Burke and Joseph Stelmach. He was predeceased by his son- Ronnie.\n\nA viewing was held Friday, December 17 with a Service to follow at 11AM in Kohut Funeral Home, Inc. 950 N. Front St. Allentown, PA 18102 and laid to rest in St. Marys Ukrainian Orthodox Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Larry’s memory to the Wounded Warriors Project or to Whitehall Manor care of the funeral home.\n\nA tribute from Larry S. Shankweiler (son)\n\nMy father was an avid handball player all his life. He started playing one-wall handball at the age of 11 or 12 years old at Jordan Park, in Allentown, PA.\n\nHe played until the age of 75 or so.\n\nHe was only 5’-2” tall. He did not have the power like a lot of the other handball players do, but he was quick with his hands and feet, had great ball control and placement and had one hell-of-a fly kill shot. His game was up front, making guys run the court back and forth and side to side, and just simply wore them down. I should know, he did that to me when I was playing with him back in the 70’s when I was a teenager. He showed no mercy.\n\nMore importantly, he was well liked by all who have met him. He had an infectious laugh recognized by all his friends. An easy going guy, out-going and friendly to all. He didn’t not show too much emotion and never swore on or off the court. He just simply played handball to his best of his ability.\n\nI was fortunate to play handball with him starting at the age of 9. I played at Jordan Park with him and his close knit of friends until I left Allentown at the age of 20. We have a father-son doubles championship title together in 1975 and I was lucky to beat my father for the only time in my life in 1978 for the Allentown singles championship…..my last year in Allentown before moving onto Kansas State University and then to California to work and raise a family. I am back in Kansas for the past 24 years now. I still keep in touch with some of the remaining handball players from Allentown.\n\nAfter I left Allentown, my Dad started to play 4-wall so he can play year round. He started playing 4-wall at the late age of 47 or so. He played 1-wall all summer long at Jordan Park, then he played 4-wall during the colder months at the Allentown YMCA, Jewish Community Center and the Allentown Racquet Club.\n\nHe also started playing in regional and state tournaments in both 1-wall and 4-wall. Then at the national level as he developed his skill as he aged.\n\nOn my last count, he had over 60 – 70 trophies and plaques in the basement of our old house in Allentown.\n\nHe has won the 1-wall National Singles Championship 3 years in a row for the Veteran Super Singles in 1998, 1999 and 2000. And again in 2002. He has won the 4-wall National Championship June 1999. These are the years I know about. He probably has several other national titles that I can’t remember that he won.\n\nHe also won several Pennsylvania State tournaments and Eastern Regional tournaments. He also participated in doubles tournaments.\n\nI don’t know all the different divisions he played in over the years, but they were the tournaments for the masters, golden masters, veteran supper singles, etc. Basically 55 years old and older.\n\nHa has several articles written about him over the years in the local Allentown Morning Call Newspaper.\n\nHe has numerous appearances in the USHA Handball Magazine. The one’s I know of are from Dec. 1978, Oct. 1998, Aug. 1999, Oct. 1999, Oct. 2000, and Oct. 2003. Those are the ones I know of because I found the copies of these magazines after he passed.\n\nHe also has an appearance in Sports Illustrated Oct. 1999 Faces In The Crowd. I attached a few pictures and articles of my Dad (See gallery).\n\nI very proud of him and I wish I could have continued my handball career alongside him.\n\nBut I will always have found memories of us playing handball at Jordan Park. The camaraderie with my Dad and all our friends was special.\n\nIf there is a handball hall of fame, my father would be well deserving of this honor not just because of handball ability and the number of tournaments he has won, but for being the great guy he was on and off the court. Small in stature, but big in everybody’s heart.\n\nI’m sure he is playing handball once again in the heavens above with all his buddies that have passed in previous years. It will be bitter-sweet for them….they get to be with a good friend once again…….but…..they will still be hating that fly kill shot of his.\n\nRest in peace Dad. I love you and miss you already!\n\nYour son….\n\nLarry\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Handball was great for my Dad, but my Dad was great for handball.\n\nThe Morning Call 5-5-1988(pdf)\n\nThe Morning Call 8-30-1999(pdf)\n\nNovember 2021\n\nRobert Philip Lindsay, Ft. Worth, Texas\n\nOct. 19, 1942 ~ Nov. 15, 2021\n\nRobert Philip “Bob” Lindsay, 79, passed away on November 15, 2021. He was a loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, cousin, and friend. Born on October 19, 1942 in Dallas, Texas to Robert Linford Lindsay and Thurston Patricia Tipton.\n\nAs a child, Bob fell in love with sports, a love that lasted his entire life. He excelled in every sport he ever played, but eventually found the sport he was most passionate about, handball. Bob graduated from Wichita Falls High School and went on to play handball for and graduated from the University of Texas where he won two collegiate national championships in 1965 and 1966. He also won the Open Doubles National Championship in 1966. Bob then took up racquetball, and won many tournaments, including the 45+ Doubles National Championship in 1989 and 1990. Bob was later inducted into the University of Texas Athletic Hall of Fame as well as the Southwest Handball Hall of Fame. Bob’s involvement in sports continued for his entire life from coaching many of his daughters’ teams to being an ardent fan of the Texas Longhorns, Dallas Cowboys, the Chicago Red Stars and the US Women’s National Soccer Team (including cheering them on to a World Cup victory in France in 2019).\n\nAfter college, Bob followed in his dad’s footsteps and went to work in the oil and gas industry where he met many of his lifelong friends. He worked for many companies during his 58-year career, including getting to work with his dad and owning several other companies. He prided himself on having worked every role on a drilling rig, and he epitomized hard work.\n\nBob met the love of his life, Theresa Ann Beam Lindsay, in a marathon training group in Wichita Falls, and they were married in 1984. They were very active together, running many marathons throughout the United States and playing countless hours of tennis with their best friends. They were very involved in their communities in Wichita Falls, Denton and Argyle, and Bob loved giving back. Bob and Theresa were founding members of Grace Heritage Church, where he was baptized, and he cherished the church’s community and fellowship. Bob and Theresa were later members of Cross Timbers Church.\n\nBob absolutely loved his family"
