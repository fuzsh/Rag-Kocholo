        "text": "Ryan’s death was announced today Tuesday, October 11 in a tweet by her son Sean Penn who said “We lost mom yesterday.”\n\nMore recently known as the mother of actors Sean and Christopher Penn, and of musician Michael Penn, Ryan died at her home in Malibu, California.\n\nRyan would’ve turned 95 this coming Sunday had she survived.\n\nAn accomplished actor in her own right, Ryan began her career back in the 1950s with two Broadway roles, “Sing Till Tomorrow” in 1953 and “Comes a Day” in 1958.\n\nRehearsing for the “Iceman Cometh” in 1957 she met Leo Penn who had taken over for Jason Robards at the Circle in the Square production.\n\nRyan and Penn had a whirlwind romance moving in together within a week of the meeting. They married a few months later, but sadly Leo died in 1998.\n\nAmong her many TV credits are appearances on: “Private Practice,” “The Twilight Zone,” “Bonanza,” “The Detectives,” “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “Arli$$,” “Ally McBeal,” “NYPD Blue,” “ER,” “CSI,” “Men of a Certain Age” and “Grey’s Anatomy.”\n\nShe also acted in a number of movies including “Parenthood,” and “Benny & Joon,” as well as starring alongside her sons in “At Close Range,” “I Am Sam,” “The Indian Runner” and “The Crossing Guard.”\n\nSean Penn has already expressed his sadness at the loss of his mother and TV and film actor, as will those who enjoyed her in one of the many roles she played."
