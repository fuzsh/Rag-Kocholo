        "text": "Sean Penn is an American-born actor best known for his roles in Mystic River, Milk, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since starting his career in Hollywood in the mid-1970s, Penn has appeared in more than 70 movies and television series.\n\nHowever, it’s not just his work in front of the camera that contributes to his success. Sean Penn’s net worth has also been impacted by his writing, producing, and directing work in addition to his real estate investments. Read on to discover Penn’s most successful projects and follow his career from the beginning until the present day.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSean Justin Penn was born in Santa Monica, California, on August 17, 1960. His parents were director Leo Penn and actress Eileen Ryan. Penn’s older brother, Michael Penn, is a musician. And his younger brother, the late Chris Penn, was an actor who passed away in 2006.\n\nPenn attended Malibu Park Junior High School and Santa Monica High School. Even as a youngster, he had already started making short films with his neighborhood friends, which included the actor brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez.\n\nActing Career\n\nPenn began his acting career with a very small role in the series Little House on the Prairie in 1974. His father, Leo Penn, was one of the directors. He later appeared in an episode of Barnaby Jones in 1979 and then in the made-for-TV movie The Killing of Randy Webster in 1981.\n\nPenn had his big screen debut in 1981 when he was cast in a supporting role in the drama film Taps, along with Tom Cruise. This was followed by a role in the short film The Beaver Kid 2 in 1982.\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High\n\nAlso in 1982, Penn appeared in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. He played the role of Jeff Spicoli, a stoner surfer character that led to the widespread use of the word dude in pop culture. It was quite a huge hit, collecting $27.1 million in global box office revenue over a budget of $4.5 million.\n\nHis next role was as Mick O’Brien in the coming-of-age drama, Bad Boys. His performance made critics take notice, even though it wasn’t a big box office success. The rest of the 1980s had Penn performing in a number of crime movies, including Crackers in 1984, At Close Range in 1986, Colors in 1988, and State of Grace in 1990.\n\nSean Penn’s net worth had yet to see substantial growth at this stage of his career despite having appeared in several films. As a result, Penn decided he wanted to take a break from acting and shifted his focus to directing.
