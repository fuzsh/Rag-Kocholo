        "text": "Eileen Ryan died on Sunday at the age of 94 in her home in Malibu, Calif., a spokesperson for the star’s famous family announced on Monday.\n\nShe would have been 95 later this month.\n\nAdditional information, including the cause and manner of her death, was not immediately available.\n\nThe legendary actress was mom to actors Sean Penn, 62, and Chris Penn, who died in 2006 at the age of 40, as well as musician Michael Penn, 64.\n\nFor 41 years, Ryan was wife to late actor-director Leo Penn, whom she met in New York in 1957 at rehearsals for the play “The Iceman Cometh.” The two tied the knot shortly after meeting and remained married until Leo’s death in 1998.\n\nRyan also appeared on Broadway in “Sing Till Tomorrow” from 1953 to 1954 and then again in 1958 for “Comes a Day.”\n\nThroughout her decades-long career, the multi-talented entertainer appeared in over 60 movies and television shows.\n\nHer best-known films include “Feast” (2005), “Parenthood” (1989), “Eight Legged Freaks” (2002), “Magnolia” (1999) and “All the King’s Men” (2006), though she also appeared in several of her sons’ projects, including “At Close Range” (1986), “I Am Sam” (2001), “The Indian Runner” (1991) and “The Crossing Guard” (1995).\n\nOn the small screen, she dominated guest roles on shows such as “The Twilight Zone,” “Bonanza,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “NYPD Blue,” “ER,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “Private Practice,” “Ally McBeal” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” among many others.\n\nSean has not yet spoken publicly on the matter, and his reps did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment."
