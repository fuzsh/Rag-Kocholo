I DID WANT TO SAY THIS IS FOR REPORT PROCESS ONLY.\n\nTHERE IS NO ACTION THAT THE COUNCIL WILL BE TAKING ON ANY OF THESE ITEMS THAT I'M ABOUT TO PRESENT.\n\nWE'LL START WITH LOCAL OPTION. CAN YOU TURN THAT.\n\n[3.A. Receive a report and hold a discussion on Local Option Election process. (Staff Presenter: Amanda Campos, City Secretary]\n\nTHANK YOU. THIS IS NOT BECAUSE I'VE RECEIVED ANY REQUESTS FROM THE PUBLIC.\n\nI JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT RIGHT NOW.\n\nTHERE HASN'T BEEN ANY CITIZEN OR GROUP THAT HAS COME FORWARD TO ME AND REQUESTED THAT WE HAVE A LOCAL OPTION ELECTION OR WHAT IS THE PROCESS.\n\nI WAS REQUESTED BY A COUNCIL MEMBER TO PLACE THIS ON AN AGENDA.\n\nIT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO THAT THE COUNCIL MEMBER ASKED FOR IT.\n\nBUT BETWEEN BUDGET HEARINGS AND BUDGET SPECIAL, WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO DISCUSS THIS ONE, SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS.\n\nFIRST OF ALL, AN OVERVIEW.\n\nI THINK I'VE GIVEN THIS OVERVIEW BEFORE.\n\nJOHNSON COUNTY PORTION OF BURLESON WAS DRY UNTIL 2004.\n\nAT THAT TIME, WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A LOCAL OPTION ELECTION, HELD ONE IN MAY WITH TWO MEASURES ON THERE.\n\nONE MEASURE PASSED AND THE OTHER ONE FAILED.\n\nWE WAITED TWO YEARS, CAME BACK WITH THE SECOND LOCAL OPTION ELECTION TO TRY TO PASS THAT SECOND MEASURE AND IT WAS PASSED THROUGH.\n\nNO OTHER LOCAL OPTIONS HAVE BEEN HELD TO DATE.\n\nSINCE THAT TIME OF THOSE ELECTIONS, WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY OTHER LOCAL OPTION ELECTIONS.\n\nSTEPS IN DOING THIS, THE VERY FIRST STEP IS GOING TO BE AN APPLICATION FOR THE PETITIONS.\n\nTHIS NEEDS AT LEAST 10 QUALIFIED VOTERS OF THE CITY.\n\nANYBODY THAT'S A QUALIFIED VOTER, THE CITY CAN ASK FOR THESE PETITIONS TO BE ISSUED TO THEM.\n\nONCE I RECEIVE THE APPLICATION, THEN I'LL ISSUE THE PETITIONS TO THEM.\n\nTHEY'LL RETURN TO ME FOR VERIFICATION OF THE SIGNATURES THAT ARE ON THERE.\n\nIF ACCEPTED WITH THEIR CORRECT AMOUNT, THEN I MUST PRESENT THOSE TO THE CITY COUNCIL SO THAT THE CITY COUNCIL CAN THEN ORDER THE ELECTION FOR THE NEXT UNIFORM ELECTION DATE.\n\nTHAT'S IMPORTANT ON HERE BECAUSE EVEN IF SOMEBODY CAME IN TODAY, AND THEY STARTED THE PROCESS AND THEY GOT THAT DONE, WE'VE MISSED THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS.\n\nTHE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE WOULD BE FOR MAY.\n\nJUST SO EVERYBODY WATCHING THOSE, YOU COULD DO THIS AHEAD OF TIME, GET THAT PUT IN THERE, AND THEN ONCE THEY ORDER, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ORDER IT UNTIL THE NEXT UNIFORM ELECTION DAY.\n\nTHOSE ARE THE NEXT UNIFORM ELECTION DAYS RIGHT THERE.\n\nMAY 4, 2024 WOULD NEED TO BE CALLED BY FEBRUARY 2024 AND NOVEMBER 5TH, 2024, AND SO AUGUST WOULD BE THE DEADLINE TO CALL THAT ONE.\n\nWHAT DOES THE APPLICATION FOR PETITION LOOK LIKE? [NOISE] IT MUST BE A WRITTEN APPLICATION AND IT MUST BE BY 10 OR MORE QUALIFIED VOTERS OF THE CITY.\n\nTHAT'S THERE SPECIFICALLY.\n\nTHERE'S NO SPECIFIC FORM OTHER THAN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE DOES HAVE ON THEIR WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN PULL A GENERIC FORM DOWN OR YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN ON THIS PART OF IT, ON THE APPLICATION FOR A PETITION.\n\nTHIS IS THE FIRST STEP WHERE 10 QUALIFIED VOTERS OF THE CITY WILL COME TO ME AND ASK ME FOR PETITIONS.\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE PETITIONS.\n\nTHE PETITIONS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME OUT OF MY OFFICE.\n\nTHEN THEY MUST PUBLISH A NOTICE IN THE NEWSPAPER.\n\nONCE SOMEBODY COMES IN AND STARTS ASKING ABOUT THIS, I'LL POINT THEM TO ALL OF THE RELEVANT LOCAL OPTION ELECTION RULES THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW.\n\nTHEY'RE PRETTY WELL LAID OUT.\n\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THAT AND SO ANYBODY CAN FOLLOW THAT FORMAT. ONCE I VERIFY THOSE TEN SIGNATURES, THEN I'M GOING TO ISSUE THE PETITIONS TO THEM.\n\n[00:10:01]\n\nTHE PETITIONS ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH.\n\nEACH POSITION BEFORE ONLY ONE MEASURE.\n\nIF THEY COME IN AND THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT MEASURES THEY WANT, THEIR PETITION CAN'T COMBINE BOTH OF THOSE OPTIONS ON ONE PETITION, SO I'LL LIST THOSE OUT SEPARATELY.\n\nTHERE IS NO OFFICIAL PETITION, LIKE I SAID, BUT THERE IS PRESCRIBED REQUIRED FORMAT FOR THOSE R BOXES THAT HAVE TO HAVE THERE SO I'LL PUT THOSE IN THERE FOR THEM.\n\nPETITION. A PETITION CAN LIST ANY ONE OF THESE 10 MEASURES.\n\nTHESE ARE THE 10 LOCAL OPTIONS OR MEASURES THAT THEY HAVE IN FRONT OF THEM TO DO.\n\nI'VE HIGHLIGHTED OR PUT IN RED THE OPTIONS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE.\n\nWE HAVE NUMBER 3 AND NUMBER 9 IN PLACE.\n\nWHEN YOU REVIEW THESE AND LOOK AT THAT, ANY OF THESE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU OR GAIN YOU ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE THE LEGAL SALE OF ALL ALCOHOL.\n\nBECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE THE RESTAURANTS WITH THE FOOD AND BEVERAGE THAT CAN SERVE THE FULL GAMBIT OF ALCOHOL.\n\nTHEN WE ALSO HAVE MALT BEVERAGE AND WINE FOR OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION ONLY, WHICH IS YOUR GROCERY STORES AND PLACES LIKE THAT.\n\nNUMBER OF SIGNATURES IS SOMETHING I ALWAYS GET QUESTIONS ABOUT.\n\nHOW MANY SIGNATURES AM I GOING TO NEED? I CAN GIVE YOU A GUESTIMATE, BUT UNTIL I HAVE SOMETHING TURNED INTO ME BECAUSE IT IS CONTINGENT ON PREVIOUS ELECTIONS.\n\nIF SOMETHING IS TURNED IN TODAY THAT THAT NUMBER MAY LOOK DIFFERENT.\n\nIF SOMEBODY ASKED ME FOR IT IN JANUARY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP IN NOVEMBER. DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? IT'S ALWAYS FLUCTUATING THERE.\n\nTHAT'S IT RIGHT THERE, 25% OF REGISTERED VOTERS IN THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION.\n\nIF, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO READ THAT IF THE BALLOT MEASURE IS FOR LEGAL SALE OF ONE ON-PREMISE FOR A WINERY, WHICH WE WOULDN'T NEED TO HAVE THAT IN THE CITY, WE'RE COVERED UNDER THE ONES WE HAVE ALREADY.\n\nBUT 35% AND YOU CAN READ ON THOSE.\n\nI KNOW PEOPLE COME TO ME AND THEY WANT THAT DEFINITE NUMBER.\n\nLET'S SAY I CAN GET NINE FRIENDS TO GIVE YOU AN APPLICATION AND I CAN GET MY PETITIONS IN PLACE.\n\nHOW MANY SIGNATURES DO I NEED? I WILL GIVE THEM A BEST GUESS, BUT I WILL TELL THEM DO NOT HOLD ME TO THAT ONE BECAUSE IF YOU DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE AND TRY TO CIRCULATE THAT PETITIONER WHEN YOU TURN IN THAT APPLICATION TO ME.\n\nIF IT'S LATER ON, THEN IT COULD LOOK DIFFERENT AND IT HAS PASS THROUGH DIFFERENT ELECTIONS SO FAR.\n\nVALID PETITIONS, I HAVE TO PRESENT THE FINDINGS TO THE CITY COUNCIL RECORDED IN THE MINUTES OF THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING TO MAKE AN OFFICIAL, THE CITY COUNCIL MUST ORDER AN ELECTION IF I VALIDATE EVERYTHING AND IT'S A VALID PETITION, EVERYTHING MEETS THE LETTER OF THE LAW, THEN THE COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO CALL THE ELECTION AND TO BE HELD AGAIN ON A UNIFORM ELECTION DATE.\n\nTHEN AFTER THE ELECTION THEN WE DO THE SAME PROCESS WHERE WE CANVAS THE ELECTION AND THEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT.\n\nUNSUCCESSFUL MEASURES DON'T HINDER SOMEBODY ELSE.\n\nIF SOMEBODY CAME IN AND SAID, WILL YOU ANNEX SOME AREAS AND WHEN YOU DID THAT, THERE WAS NO LOCAL OPTION IN PLACE BECAUSE THIS WAS PRIOR TO 2006, LET'S SAY, AND SO YOU COULDN'T DO FOR OFF-PREMISE.\n\nWELL, NOW IT'S BEEN ANNEXED SINCE THAT DATE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ENCOMPASS ALL OF IT SO THAT NOW QT OR BOLERO OR SHELL STATION WANTS TO GO IN THE CORNER SOMEWHERE AND THIS WAS NOT IN PLACE.\n\nTHEY CAN'T SELL THE OFF-PREMISE BECAUSE THERE'S STILL DRY BECAUSE WHEN WE PASS THE FIRST ELECTION, THEY WEREN'T IN THE CITY LIMITS AND NOW THEY'RE IN THE CITY LIMITS.\n\nIF SOMEBODY CAME FORWARD AND WE DID ANOTHER ELECTION AND IT FAILED, IT WOULDN'T MATTER THE PEOPLE THAT ALREADY HAD THE ABILITY TO SELL, THEY CAN STILL SELL, IT'S THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO.\n\nLET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. CITY OF FORT WORTH HAD TO DO THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK.\n\nTHEY HAD ANNEX SOME AREA INTO THE CITY OF FORT WORTH THAT AT THE TIME WAS DRY AND THEY JUST COULDN'T SELL ALCOHOL.\n\nBUT THEN THEY CAME INTO THE CITY OF FORT WORTH AND FOR SOME REASON THEY HAD TO DO A LOCAL OPTION ELECTION.\n\nI CALLED AND I ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE DOING THAT.\n\nTHEY SAID IS BECAUSE WHEN THEY DID THEIR LOCAL OPTION ELECTION, THAT LAND WAS NOT INSIDE THE CITY LIMITS OF FORT WORTH, SO THEY BROUGHT IT IN.\n\nNOW IT PASSED AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.\n\nI JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ANY UNMEASURED DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S HARMFUL TO THE PEOPLE ALREADY HAVING THOSE RIGHTS.\n\nI DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT HURTS THEM.\n\nNO LATER THAN THE THIRD DAY TO CANVAS AND THEN WE DO THE RULES AND THEN I NEED TO LET THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE KNOW IMMEDIATELY AND THE ALCOHOL BEVERAGE COMMISSION.\n\nTHAT IS IT VERY QUICKLY, VERY TOP-LEVEL THIS SO THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S BACK OUT THERE.\n\nIF THERE'S ANYBODY WATCHING OR HAS ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR WOULD LIKE TO COME VISIT WITH ME PERSONALLY, I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT AND REACH OUT AND WE'LL DO THAT.\n\nDOES COUNCIL HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ANYTHING YOU GUYS WOULD LIKE ME TO DO?\n\n[00:15:01]\n\n>> WELL, ON THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, THE PLACES AROUND TOWN THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.\n\nIF THIS WERE TO PASS AND THEN THOSE COME IN THEN THEY WOULD BE ON THE OLD WAY AND THEY'D HOVE TO [OVERLAPPING].\n\n>> IF THEY'RE NOT WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A 380 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, BECAUSE DO THEY RETAIN THEIR RIGHTS WHEN WE ANNEX THEM AT THAT POINT? I MEAN, IF THERE'S A LOCAL OPTION.\n\nGO AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO DRESS THAT.\n\nBECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD APPLY TO THEM BECAUSE WE ANNEX THEM, BUT WE DIDN'T.\n\n>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION.\n\n>> BUT LET'S SAY CHIMP CHISHOLM SUMMIT OR A PROPERTY THAT'S BEEN UNDER DEVELOPER AGREEMENT THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IN THE CITY, BUT AS SOON AS THEY DO SOMETHING THAT COMES IN, IF THE LOCAL OPTION WERE TO PASS NOW AND THEN THEY CAME IN, WOULD THEY STILL BE ON THE OLD WAY OR WOULD THEY.\n\n>> CORRECT. [INAUDIBLE].\n\n>> THEY'LL WE'D HAVE TO DO THE OPTION AGAIN.\n\n>> THAT'S RIGHT.\n\n>> THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE BACK ON THE PETITIONS, AMANDA, SO REALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT NUMBER 7 AND NUMBER 8.\n\nBECAUSE REALLY THE TWO HIGHER UP YOU CAN GO.\n\nBECAUSE NUMBER 8 WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE CERTIFICATE.\n\nYOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THEIR CERTIFICATE ANYMORE. FOOD AND BEVERAGE.\n\n>> YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE BOOT FOOD AND BEVERAGE.\n\n>> THEN NUMBER 7 WOULD BE LIQUOR STORES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\n\n>> BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE ON THERE YOU COULD COVER UNDER ONE OF THE TWO THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE.\n\n>> WHY WOULD IT NOT BE NUMBER 5?\n\n>> OF ALCOHOL BEVERAGES, OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION ONLY?\n\n>> IF IT FITS THE PURPOSE IS TO OPEN UP A SPECS LIQUORS I THEN THAT'S ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FOR OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION ONLY.\n\n>> I WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW THAT ONE.\n\nI'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE WHEN I ASKED FOR LEGAL ADVICE ON THAT, THEY TOLD ME THOSE WERE ALL BE COVERED EXCEPT FOR THE ONE FOR MIXED BEVERAGES.\n\nTHERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE IN THAT DEFINITION THERE THAT HITS THAT.\n\n>> I WOULD ASSUME WE'RE LOOKING FOR OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION AND NOT BE ABLE TO SELL LIQUOR, BUY THE BOTTLE, AND ALSO BUY THE DRINK.\n\nBECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY PASSING HONESTLY.\n\nSPEAKING OF PASSING BASED ON THE ELECTION THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT IF THIS WERE TO COME UP, SAY BEFORE NOVEMBER, WHAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE REQUIRED NUMBER?\n\n>> I HAVE NOT CHECKED RECENTLY ON WHAT THAT I WOULD JUST BE.\n\n>> THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF WHOEVER VOTED IN THE MOST RECENT GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION.\n\n>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT A LOCAL ELECTION.\n\nYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A STATEWIDE ELECTION.\n\nTHE LAST TIME WE HAD THE GOVERNOR'S ELECTION, THAT'S THE NUMBER WE WOULD GO OFF OF.\n\n>> WAS THAT NOVEMBER 2020?\n\n>> YES.\n\n>> THE 22?\n\n>> WAS THAT NOVEMBER 22? COUNCIL MEMBER SCOTT [LAUGHTER].\n\n>> HE'S 22.\n\nI BELIEVE SO.\n\n>> YOU'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT A MUCH LARGER.\n\n>> IT'S LARGER 20.\n\n>> IT'S 20.\n\n>> [INAUDIBLE] CORRECTION WAS A HUGE TURNOUT FOR MYRTLE'S BIGGEST.\n\n>> SO YOU MIGHT HAVE BETTER LUCK IF YOU WAIT UNTIL 2024 IS ELECTION TO SEE IF THAT NUMBER DROPS.\n\nPOSSIBLY, I DON'T KNOW.\n\n2020 WAS A BIG YEAR.\n\n>> 2024, MAYBE JUST.\n\n>> EVEN BIGGER, COULD BE, BUT NOW WHAT.\n\n>> CONSIDERED. OUR GOVERNOR AND OUR PRESIDENT ARE.\n\n>> THERE.\n\n>>RE-ELECTED ON THE SAME FAIR TIME, AND THAT'S WHAT GOT EVERYBODY OUT IN 20, SO CORRECT.\n\n>> YES. SO THOSE LIKE WE SAID, THOSE NUMBERS FLUCTUATE AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 35% OF THAT LAST ELECTION, IT WILL BE A MUCH LARGER NUMBER.\n\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE ALL THINGS ON THE BALLOT THAT PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR AT THAT SAME TIME YOU JUST MENTIONED THE PRESIDENCY.\n\nTHERE'LL BE COUNTYWIDE.\n\nSO YOU'RE GOING TO GET ELECTION VOTERS, YOUR CITY OF BERLIN VOTERS COME OUT MORE IN A NOVEMBER ELECTION WHEN THERE'S LARGER ITEMS ON THE BALLOT, THEN IF YOU WERE TRYING TO BASE IT OFF OF LIKE YOUR CITY ELECTION, LIKE THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION THAT WE HAD? YES, YOUR NUMBER IS GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS.\n\n>> WELL, I WOULD THINK OFF THE TOP MY HEAD THAT BASED ON THE GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION TURNOUT IN 2020, YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE MORE SIGNATURES AND WE EVEN HAD PEOPLE VOTE IN THE ELECTION IN MAY.\n\n>> ABSOLUTELY.\n\n>> SO [LAUGHTER] THAT'S SERIOUS.\n\n>> [INAUDIBLE] ABOUT 25,000 REGISTERED, 20, 30,000.\n\n>> WE HAVE LEAKED 35,000, 40. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO.\n\n>> WELL OVER 10,000 SIGNATURES.\n\n[00:20:03]\n\n>> THE LAST ELECTION THAT WE HAD IN NOVEMBER OF 2020, CITY OF BERLIN AND ALONE BROUGHT OUT RECORD NUMBER OF VOTERS. WE HAD OVER.\n\n>> WE HAD 11,005.\n\n>> WE HAD OVER 10,000 VOTERS [OVERLAPPING] IN THAT ROOM, JUST IN THAT.\n\nYOU CAN SEE HOW WE.\n\n>> 35% OF THAT BEING SOMEWHERE IN THE 3,800 NUMBER.\n\nBUT IT'S OFF THE GOVERNOR.\n\nYOU COULD HAVE HAD A CITIZEN COME IN, SEE THAT BIG BALLOT AND ONLY VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNOR AND WALK OUT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE A CITY OF BERLIN AND REGISTERED VOTER AND THAT NUMBER IS STILL GOING TO BE IN THIS ELECTION.\n\nSO DON'T GO OFF WHAT OUR CITY ELECTION WAS.\n\nIT'S OFF OF THE GOVERNOR'S ELECTION.\n\n>> IT LOOKS LIKE ALL OF OUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE GOING INTO SPECS UP HERE IN 1,187 [LAUGHTER] WHEN THEY OPEN UP.\n\n>> AND IT'S 35% OF THE REGISTERED VOTERS IN THE CITY WHO ACTUALLY VOTED.\n\n>> CORRECT?\n\n>> SO OKAY.\n\n>> NOT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS.\n\n[OVERLAPPING]\n\n>> CORRECT.\n\n>> SO IT IS MORE LIKE 3,000 SIGNATURES OR 4,000, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n\nMAYBE MADE MORE, NOT A BIG NUMBER.\n\n>> IT'S A BIGGER NUMBER.\n\nCAN YOU GO TO THE VOTING SO I CAN SWITCH OVER? THANK YOU.\n\nHOLD ON. ONE LAST.\n\nSO NOW LET'S COUNCIL POLICY NUMBER 40,\n\n[3.B. Discuss and review City Council Policy #40 – City Boards, Commissions & Committee Appointment Process and city Code of Ordinances Chapter 2, Section 2-31. (Staff Presenter: Amanda Campos, City Secretary)]\n\nAND YOU'LL REMEMBER THIS WAS JUST PASSED LAST YEAR.\n\nTHIS IS EARLIER THIS YEAR.\n\nIT'S A FAIRLY NEW POLICY THAT'S IN PLACE HERE.\n\nIN FACT, I WILL TELL YOU IT WAS PASSED JULY 18, 2022.\n\nTHIS IS A NEW POLICY IN PLACE.\n\nTHERE I HAD ON THE SLIDE THERE IS CREDITED TO FORMALIZE THE PROCESS FOR APPOINTMENT ON ALL BOARDS, COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES.\n\nBEFORE THIS, WE DID TRADITIONALLY WE HELD A PRACTICE THAT WE DID YEAR AFTER YEAR, BUT WE HAD NEVER FORMALIZED THE PROCESS AND COUNCIL THOUGHT IT WAS TIME WE START FORMALIZING THOSE.\n\nTHERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT I'M BRINGING FORWARD FOR Y'ALL.\n\nTHIS IS JUST TO REVIEW, THIS IS THE FIRST PASS AT THIS.\n\nONE OF THE THINGS THOUGH IS JUST A CLEANUP.\n\nWE RECENTLY RE-DID OUR COUNCIL COMMITTEES, WE CHANGED OUR APPOINTMENTS AND COUNSELING POLICIES COMMITTEE, FOLDED THAT FUNCTION INTO THE COMMUNITY AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE, WHICH IS REFERENCED IN POLICY NUMBER 40, WHICH WE JUST PASS.\n\nONE OF THE AMENDMENTS I'D LIKE TO DO IS REPLACE THAT.\n\nWE'RE REPLACING EVERYWHERE THAT IT SAYS APPOINTMENTS AND COUNSEL POLICIES COMMITTEE WITH COMMUNITY AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS COMMUNITY COMMITTEE SAY THAT FIVE TIMES FAST.\n\nTHE OTHER THING I WANT TO DO IS LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES.\n\nTHIS POLICY CLEARLY STATES ON HOW TO PUT A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC ON A BOARD OR COMMISSION, AND THEN IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING PAST THAT.\n\nWE APPOINT THEM, WE PUT THEM ON THERE AND I HAVE OVER THE YEARS GOTTEN QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS OF WHAT IS OUR ON-BOARDING FOR OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND WE HAVE LACKED BEHIND ON DOING THAT.\n\nTOO WHAT TRAINING ARE WE GIVING THEM AND WE'VE LOCKED BEHIND ON THAT.\n\nBUT ANYWAYS, ALL OF THAT TO SAY, WE HAVE REALLY SAID, HERE YOU'RE ON THIS BOARD AND THEN WE WALK AWAY AND SAY, GOOD LUCK TO YOU.\n\nNOW STAFF DOES THE STAFF LIAISONS DO A GOOD JOB OF GETTING THEIR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS UP-TO-DATE, BUT NOT AS FAR AS A UNIFIED WAY THAT THEY DO THAT.\n\nSOME DO IT DIFFERENTLY AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD.\n\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO ON THERE IS JUST ADD SOME DEFINITION.\n\nDEFINE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MEMBERS.\n\nDEFINE THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR ROLE.\n\nWHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? WHAT ARE WE ASKING THEM TO DO? VALUE EXPECTATIONS, PROCESS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS.\n\nAND THEN WE WANTED TO ADD THE BERNOULLIS AND RULES OF ORDER BECAUSE WE ARE UNIQUE HERE IN BURLINGTON, WE'VE ADOPTED BERNOULLIS AND RULES OF ORDER, WHICH IS LIKE ROBERT SWIRLS, MODIFIED, TWEAKED AND PUT EXACTLY HOW WE WANT THEM TO BE HERE IN BURLINGTON.\n\nWITHOUT BREAKING THE LAW PROMISE.\n\nTHE FIRST THING IS, I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN I SAY, WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE 2, JUST TO SEE ABOUT APPOINTMENTS.\n\nIT'S APPOINTMENTS TERMS, REMOVALS AND EXCEPTIONS.\n\nYOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE ONLY REFERENCE.\n\nCITY COUNCIL MAY FOR CAUSE REMOVE A BOARD MEMBER AT ANYTIME.\n\nTHERE'S NO PROCESS ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE THAT OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT OR ANYTHING ELSE.\n\n[00:25:01]\n\nIT'S JUST A BLANKET STATEMENT.\n\nWHEN YOU DO THAT, WHEREAS YOUR GUIDELINES, WHERE ARE YOUR PARAMETERS THAT YOU GUYS AS A GOVERNING BODY ARE FOLLOWING.\n\nYOU'RE TAKING CARE TO APPOINT THESE PEOPLE.\n\nTHEN WE'RE LEAVING IT UP TO CHANCE.\n\nWE WANT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS AND ALL OF THIS THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH IS NOT REQUIRED COUNSEL CAN SAY, I DON'T WANT TO DO ANY OF THIS, I LIKE IT WHERE IT'S AT, WE'LL TAKE IT ONE CASE AT A TIME OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO.\n\nTHAT'S FINE. WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.\n\nAND THAT'S THE BEST TIME TO IMPLEMENT GUIDELINES, PROCEDURES, AND PROCESSES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE SOMETHING FACING US RIGHT NOW.\n\nADDITIONS TO POLICY NUMBER 40, I WANTED TO ADD THIS SECTION HERE OF RESPONSIBILITIES.\n\nTHESE ARE JUST GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF STUDY.\n\nBE FAMILIAR WITH THE AGENDA PACKET DIRECT QUESTIONS TO STAFF PRIOR TO THE MEETINGS.\n\nI WILL SAY ON THAT ONE I WAS VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE I DID GET FEEDBACK PRIOR TO THE COUNCIL MEETINGS, SO I'VE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THIS PRESENTATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE.\n\nHOPEFULLY, YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE NEXT SLIDE OR TWO THAT I'VE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THERE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION QUESTIONS THAT I RECEIVED FROM THE PUBLIC AND AS WELL AS THE COUNCIL MEMBERS.\n\nBE RESPECTFUL OF ALL PARTICIPATING, ARRIVING ON TIME.\n\nTHAT'S A BIG ONE. ARRIVING ON TIME, PROVIDE 72 HOURS NOTICE OF ABSENCES.\n\nOF COURSE, THE WAY THAT I WROTE THIS, THESE ARE NOT VERBATIM.\n\nTHIS IS A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THAT.\n\nI DID SAY, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU CANNOT GIVE 72 HOUR NOTICE, SOMETHING COMES UP, WE UNDERSTAND THAT.\n\nBUT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET IN THE PRACTICE OF SAYING 72 HOUR NOTICE, SO THAT WE KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A QUORUM FOR A COMMITTEE MEETING OR NOT.\n\nPROVIDE UPDATED CONTACT. YOU'RE HERE, YOU GET A NEW CELL PHONE BECAUSE YOU THROUGH YOUR OLD CELL PHONE IN THE LAKE, YOU WERE HAVING SUCH A GREAT TIME OVER LABOR DAY WEEKEND AND YOU NEED STAFF TO KNOW HOW TO GET A HOLD OF YOU.\n\nTHEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO GET A HOLD OF YOU, SO AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE WANT YOU TO GIVE THE NEW NUMBER.\n\nYOU'D BE SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T PROVIDE THE NEW UPDATED.\n\nTHEY GIVE IT ON THE APPLICATION AND THEN IT'S NEVER CHANGED AGAIN.\n\nWE NEED TO KNOW ALL OF THAT STUFF FOR THEM.\n\nA USE OF A DESIGNATED STAFF CONTACT, MEANING EACH BOARD AND COMMISSION AND COMMITTEE WILL BE GIVEN A STAFF LIAISON THEY ARE OR THE DIRECTOR.\n\nWHAT WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO DO IS UTILIZE THAT AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO SAY, IF YOU'RE GOING TO MISS A MEETING, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A HOLD OF THIS DESIGNATED STAFF MEMBER.\n\nIF YOU DO ANOTHER STAFF MEMBER AND THERE MAY BE EVERY INTENTION OF LETTING THAT OTHER STAFF MEMBER, WHO'S THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MEETING KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE, THEY GET CAUGHT UP IN THEIR DAY AND THEN THEY DON'T TELL THEM AND WHAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON THAT CALLED IN THAT DAY.\n\nNOW THERE'S NO QUORUM AND THERE'S NO MEETING.\n\nWE JUST WANT TO GET EVERYBODY BACK TO HAVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nTHERE IS REQUIRED TRAINING THAT EACH BOARD AND COMMISSION AND COMMITTEE MEMBER IS REQUIRED TO TAKE.\n\nWE GIVE THOSE AVENUES TO THEM.\n\nWE WANT THEM TO COMPLETE THIS WITHIN 90 DAYS BECAUSE THAT'S A REQUIREMENT AND WE HAVE SOME DIFFICULTIES GETTING THEM TO COMPLETE THEM IN 90 DAYS.\n\nBUT WE HAVE NO OTHER WAY OR ANOTHER AVENUE OF GOING FORWARD WITH THAT.\n\nWE WOULD JUST SAY, CAN YOU PLEASE, AND WE JUST BUG THEM.\n\nBUT IF WE HAD THIS AND THEY CAN LOOK AT THIS POLICY AHEAD OF TIME, READ IT, SIGN IT, OR I CAN GIVE A PRESENTATION AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON FROM THERE, I THINK THAT WOULD HELP.\n\nTHAT PUTS SOME CLARITY IN THERE. EXCUSE ME.\n\nI HAVE ALLERGIES TODAY.\n\nTHE NEXT SECTION, CHAIR AND VICE-CHAIR.\n\nTHAT'S JUST TO DEFINE.\n\nWE WANT THE PRESIDING OFFICER.\n\nSOMETIMES THE CHAIRS WILL ASK ME WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO AND I'VE DONE SOME CHAIR TRAINING WITH THEM, BUT I THINK THIS WILL HELP THEM TOO, TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CORE OF WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THEIR BEGINNING ON TIME, MAKING SURE THERE'S A QUORUM BEFORE THEY CALL THAT MEETING TO ORDER, MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT STARTING EARLY.\n\nI WANT THEM TO ANNOUNCE THE PROPER SEQUENCE OF THE AGENDA.\n\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE COORDINATING WITH STAFF MEMBERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT.\n\nTHEN WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE MEMBERS, STAFF AND CITIZENS TO SPEAK, WE WANT TO GIVE EQUAL TIME.\n\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE GIVING THE CITIZENS WHO COME TO SPEAK, OR DEVELOPERS THAT COME TO SPEAK OR APPLICANTS THAT THEY HAVE THE EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME.\n\nWE'RE NOT MONOPOLIZING THAT AND NOT ALLOWING THEM TO REALLY SPEAK.\n\nTHEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S DECORUM DURING THE MEETING.\n\nWE WANT THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT'S HAPPENING.\n\nWE WANT THEM TO FOLLOW AND LEARN THE BURLINGTON RULES OF ORDER SO THAT THEY KNOW HOW WE EXPECT MEETINGS TO BE CONDUCTED.\n\nTHEN WE WANT THEM TO STAY AND PUT TO VOTE AND ANNOUNCE RESULTS.\n\nBECAUSE THEY'RE NOT USING THE VOTING MACHINE AND THE ELECTRONIC DISPLAY LIKE YOU ALL ARE, SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE RECORD THAT THEY ARE STATING WHAT IT IS.\n\nTHEY ARE MOVING TO APPROVE WHATEVER THAT IS AND THAT WE'RE PUTTING IT TO VOTE CLEARLY, CONCISELY, AND THAT WE'RE ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS.\n\n[00:30:02]\n\nTHE CHAIR IS. THE NEXT SECTION I ACTUALLY ADDED ANOTHER SLIDE.\n\nLET'S LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY HAS ALL OF THE WRITTEN.\n\nNOT THE SYNOPSIS BUT THE ACTUAL WRITING.\n\nSOME OF THESE ARE REFLECTIVE, I THOUGHT, OF OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HELD.\n\nDOES EVERYBODY DOES, RIGHT? CONFLICT OF INTERESTS, EVEN AS STAFF, WE HAVE THIS, WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF CONFLICT OF INTERESTS.\n\nWE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\nTHERE ARE SOME TIMES WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO BOARD, COMMITTEE AND COMMISSION MEMBERS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE OUT IN THE PUBLIC JUST YET.\n\nBUT FOR THEM TO MAKE AN ACCURATE AND WELL-ROUNDED DECISION, THEY NEED TO KNOW THESE, SO WE MAKE SURE WE DO THAT.\n\nWE WANT THEM TO BE MINDFUL OF NEUTRALITY AND IMPARTIALITY WHILE RENDERING.\n\nI KNOW SOMETIMES THAT'S HARD.\n\nIF YOU'RE ON A BORDER COMMISSION, YOU'RE ON THE LIBRARY BOARD AND YOUR NEIGHBOR TWO DOORS DOWN COMES TO SPEAK YOU MAY BE MORE PARTIAL TO THEM BECAUSE YOU REALLY LIKE THEM, OR YOU MAY NOT BE BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THEM, WHICHEVER WAY THAT IS, BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR JUST STATING IT THIS IS THE ONE THAT I GOT THE MOST FEEDBACK FROM, THAT I GOT THE MOST CONCERNS ABOUT WAS THIS STATEMENT RIGHT HERE.\n\nI BOLDED THE ACTUAL PART, BEING MINDFUL OF EACH MEMBER REPRESENTING THE CITY AS A MEMBER OF ONE OF ITS BOARDS, COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES, AND SHOULD CONDUCT THEIR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE.\n\nAN EXAMPLE OF THE CITIZENS AND FELLOW MEMBERS RELAYING THE CITY'S OBLIGATION THAT ALL ARE TREATED EQUALLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL LAWS.\n\nI WOULD SAY THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO A COUPLE AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE STICKING POINTS.\n\nWHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU ALL AS A GOVERNING BODY IS TO LOOK AT THIS THING IN THE TOTALITY.\n\nIF THIS IS THE PORTION THAT GIVES YOU HEARTBURN OR THAT YOU THINK MAYBE WE NEED TO WORK IT A LITTLE BIT MORE, OR WE NEED TO REVIEW THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT CONSIDERATION, THEN I WOULD ASK THAT YOU GUYS SAY, BRING THIS FORWARD, BUT TAKE THIS PART OUT AND LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THIS PART AND NOT IMPLEMENT THAT PART BECAUSE I DON T KNOW THAT THERE'S MEAN I WON'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL, BUT IF THERE'S NO OBJECTIONS TO THE REST OF THE PART THAN WE DON'T JUST START FROM GROUND ZERO EACH TIME.\n\nAT LEAST YOU'VE GOT SOME WORKING BASE OF A STRUCTURE THAT YOU GUYS.\n\nIT MAY BE SOME PARTS THAT YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE.\n\nSTILL MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY OF THEM EXCEPT FOR CONFLICT OF INTERESTS IN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND YOU WANT TO SCRAP THE REST OF THAT IN THIS SECTION.\n\nTHAT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO DO THAT TOO.\n\nI JUST WOULD LIKE THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THE WHOLE ADDITION IN ITS TOTALITY.\n\nTHE OTHER THING THAT I CAME UP WITH THAT ACTUALLY MONICA BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION TO WAS THE YOUTH MEMBERS.\n\nWE DO HAVE A MAYOR'S YOUTH COUNCIL, AND THEN WE DO HAVE VOTING MEMBERS ON SOME OF THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.\n\nWHAT I WOULD LIKE COUNSEL TO DISCUSS AND REVIEW AND GIVE ME DIRECTION ON IS HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THESE YOUTH MEMBERS? BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM UNDER UNDUE AND WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT THEY ARE JUVENILES.\n\nTHEY GO OFF WHEN THEY'RE 17.\n\nSEVENTEEN IS THE LAST AGE OR SENIOR GRADUATING.\n\nWE HAVE SOME MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS THAT PARTICIPATE.\n\nTHEY SERVE FOR ONE YEAR.\n\nTHEY SHOULD BE REVIEWED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CONSIDERING THOSE MEMBER.\n\nTHIS IS ANOTHER PART THAT I WOULD SAY.\n\nTHIS MAY BE SOMETHING YOU GUYS CUT OUT FOR NOW AND ASK US TO GET WITH LEGAL AND ASK US TO REVIEW THOSE A LITTLE BIT FOR MORE MINDFULLY AND THEN BRING THAT BACK.\n\nTHAT'S UP TO COUNSEL, HOW THEY WANT TO DO THAT.\n\nI DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS WANTED TO START TALKING ABOUT THIS OR DO YOU WANT ME TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING FIRST? I'LL GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. I'LL KEEP GOING.\n\nTHE PROCESS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM STAFF AND FELLOW MEMBERS.\n\nI DID BREAK THIS OUT TO TWO DIFFERENT WAYS, WE DID THIS.\n\nKEEPING IN MIND THAT ADDRESSING CONCERNS FROM STAFF AND FELLOW MEMBERS IS GOING TO BE DONE VERBALLY, MORE INFORMALLY.\n\nIT'S GOING TO BE DIRECTED TO THE DIRECTOR OF THAT AND MYSELF, THE CITY SECRETARY WILL TRY TO WORK OUT A RESOLUTION, TRY TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT, TRY TO GET OUR RESOLUTION IN PLACE.\n\nIF WE CANNOT, AT THAT POINT IS WHEN IT WOULD MOVE ON TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FULL COUNCIL, AND THEN THE FULL COUNCIL WOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHERE WE'RE AT ON THAT.\n\nTHE COMMUNITY AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE COULD TURN BACK AND SAY, WELL, THINK OF THIS, THIS AND THIS, AND THEN YOU GO BACK TO THEM.\n\nWE'RE NOT READY TO BRING IT TO THE FULL COUNSEL YET.\n\nWE STILL THINK YOU DIDN'T FIGURE OUT THIS RESOLUTION AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.\n\nWE CAN WE CAN DO THAT.\n\nI JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROCESSES.\n\nTHE SECOND ONE IS IF THERE'S A COMPLAINT OR CONCERN FROM THE PUBLIC.\n\nWE WANT THOSE IN WRITING, WE WANT TO ADDRESS THOSE.\n\nPART OF THAT IS FOR RECORD RETENTION THAT WE HAVE TOO OR COMPLAINTS THERE IS\n\n[00:35:03]\n\nTHE TEXAS STATE LIBRARY SAYS COMPLAINTS FILED TO THE CITY HAVE TO BE KEPT FOR SO LONG.\n\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE KEEPING THOSE.\n\nWE WANT THAT WRITTEN RIGHT THERE.\n\nI WILL WORK TO FIND A RESOLUTION ON THIS ONE TOO, AND ADDRESS WHAT'S GOING ON.\n\nI'M KEEPING THE CITY MANAGER, THE CITY COUNCIL, AND THE DIRECTOR INFORMED ON THIS.\n\nWE'LL GO THROUGH THAT SAME PROCESS.\n\nIF THERE'S NO RESOLUTION, THEN WE'LL GO FORWARD WITH THE COMMUNITY AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS AND THEN MOVE IT ONTO THE FULL COUNCIL.\n\nTHEN OF COURSE, EVERYTHING DONE IN THE PUBLIC AND ACCORDING TO OPEN MEETINGS ACT.\n\nADOPTING THE RULES OF ORDER, THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT POLICIES 17 HAS OUTLINED.\n\nWE WANT THEM TO LOOK AT THIS AND ADOPT THIS TOO, THE ROLES AND RULES OF ORDER.\n\nIT DEFINES PRESIDING OFFICER EMOTIONS, POINT OF ORDER, POINT OF INFORMATION CALLED THE QUESTION, PUBLIC HEARINGS TABLES ADJOURN AND EXECUTIVE SESSION.\n\nNOW WE CAN GET INTO DISCUSSION AND DIRECTION.\n\nKEEP IN MIND, THIS IS 100% ON THE CITY COUNCIL TO MAKE THE DECISION ON THIS.\n\nIF IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME OR THERE WOULD LIKE TO BE SOME MORE AMENDMENTS OR SOME MORE WORK DONE, WE CAN DO THAT.\n\nYOU GUYS WANT TO FORWARD IT TO A COMMITTEE, WE CAN DO THAT.\n\nIT'S UP TO THE CITY COUNCIL ON THIS ONE.\n\n>> AMANDA. HI, MORNING.\n\nI HAD HAD A REVELATION ABOUT, WE'LL CALL IT A CODE OF CONDUCT.\n\nIF IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT, I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT CODE OF CONDUCT IS, SO THAT WE'RE ALL SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT.\n\nI'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD, IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE.\n\nLET ME GIVE YOU A COMPARISON.\n\nDRESS CODE, SCHOOL.\n\nYOU THINK, MAN THAT'S AN EASY ONE.\n\nHECK, YEAH. NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S HORRIBLE.\n\nWHEN YOU START SETTING OUT A CODE OF CONDUCT, I THINK YOU SHOULD BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL BECAUSE MY CODE OF CONDUCT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE SAME AS OTHERS.\n\nI TELL YOU, THE THING THAT GOT ME WHEN I READ IT, AND I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU SAY HEY, IF YOU'RE ON A COMMITTEE, YOU NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE.\n\nWE GOT TO SHOW A GOOD EXAMPLE.\n\nSTEP ABOVE. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THIS.\n\nIN 1990, THE FIRST YEAR I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD, I HAD THAT QUESTION POSED TO ME THAT NOW RONNIE, YOU MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE YOUR WAYS A LITTLE BIT AND MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.\n\nBUT MY COMMENT TO THEM WAS, I WILL NOT CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE.\n\nI KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT, I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG, AND I KNOW WHAT MY ACTIONS SHOULD BE, BUT I'M NOT CHANGING MY LIFE BECAUSE I'M SITTING ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AND I DIDN'T.\n\nI THINK IT'S LIKE BEING ON A COMMITTEE OR VOLUNTEER TO BE ON A COMMITTEE.\n\nGREAT. BUT WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IS CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE TO BE ON THAT COMMITTEE.\n\nI THINK WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT.\n\nI'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T HAVE A CODE OF CONDUCT, BUT I'M SAYING YOU NEED TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF THAT CODE OF CONDUCT.\n\n>> I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE, MR. MAYOR.\n\nI DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS DOCUMENT OTHER THAN 1C4 THE PARTS YOU HAVE HIGHLIGHTED.\n\nI DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH RUNNING THIS DOCUMENT FOR ONE YEAR ON A TEST RUN TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE COUNCIL WITH 1C4S STRIPPED OUT OF IT.\n\nIN THE MEANTIME, IT CAN GO TO THE COUNCIL POLICY AND VALIDATION FOR THAT YEAR TO BE REVIEWED TO WHETHER IT NEEDED TO BE PUT BACK IN, MODIFIED OR ELIMINATED.\n\nBECAUSE WITHOUT A BASELINE FOR DISCIPLINE, YOU CANNOT DO DISCIPLINE FAIRLY.\n\nWE DO HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A BASELINE.\n\nA BASELINE COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS WHEN THEY'RE APPOINTED TO THE COMMITTEE.\n\nTHERE COULD BE A BACKGROUND CHECK SUCH AS VOLUNTEERS THAT WOULD BE SETTING A BASELINE, AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WOULD BRING THEM DOWN BELOW THAT BASELINE, THEN WE COULD START THE PROCESS.\n\nBUT UNTIL THEN I'M IN FAVOR OF GOING FORWARD WITH THIS EXCEPT FOR 1C4 HAVING THAT STRIPPED OUT AND BRINGING THAT TO THE COMMITTEE.\n\n>> IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE WANTING TO BE COVERED IN FOUR ARE COVERED IN FIVE,\n\n[00:40:01]\n\nAND YOU COULD TAKE FIVE AND ADD THE WORDS BEING MINDFUL THAT EACH MEMBER REPRESENTS THE CITY AS A MEMBER OF ONE OF ITS BOARD COMMISSION COMMITTEE, AND THEN STOP THERE AND TAKE OUT THE REST OF FOUR?\n\n>> ABSOLUTELY.\n\n>> I THINK TWO THINGS BOTHER ME, ONE FROM THE ONE SIDE AND ONE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.\n\nFROM THE ONE SIDE TO ATTEMPT TO DICTATE HOW PEOPLE CONDUCT THEIR PRIVATE LIVES.\n\nWE'D HAD A CODE OF CONDUCT FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT FORTUNATELY, WE RESCINDED LATER BECAUSE IT WAS A FIASCO AND I CALLED IT FROM THE START, BUT THAT'S BEEN SAID AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT HISTORY THERE.\n\nBUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT APPLIED TO COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO WERE ELECTED AT THE WILL OF THE CITIZENS.\n\nTHE CITIZENS HAVE THEIR OWN MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR SIMPLY WAITING UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION AND KICKING YOUR BUTT OUT OR IF IT COMES TO IT, RECALL.\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBER CAN BE RECALL FROM SERVICE IF HIS TRANSGRESSIONS ARE SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT THE PUBLIC THINKS IT'S WARRANTED AND IT GOES THROUGH THE STEPS.\n\nWE APPOINT BOARD COMMISSION AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS BASED ON THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE.\n\nBUT AS YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER IN YOUR PRESENTATION, WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM TO REMOVE OR TO EVEN REPRIMAND A COMMITTEE OR COMMISSION MEMBER WHEN THEIR BEHAVIOR GOES BEYOND WHAT WE CONSIDER APPROPRIATE FOR THAT POSITION.\n\nI FEEL LIKE IT'S GOOD THAT WE COULD EDGE UP TOWARDS BOTH OF THOSE A LITTLE CLOSER THAN WE ARE HERE.\n\nI THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY EDGE AWAY FROM TRYING TO DICTATE HOW PEOPLE CONDUCT THEIR PRIVATE LIFE.\n\nNOW, I MAY DEFINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUBLIC LIFE AND PRIVATE LIFE DIFFERENTLY FROM PERHAPS ALL OF THE OTHER MEMBERS.\n\nTO ME, PRIVATE LIFE IS WHAT I DO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH NO ONE WITNESSING.\n\nPUBLIC LIFE IS IF I SAT DOWN AND I PUT A POST OUT ON FACEBOOK AND I PUBLICLY CASTIGATE A STAFF MEMBER, FOR INSTANCE, AND DO SO IN A PUBLIC VENUE LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA.\n\nNOW WE'RE GETTING OVER INTO THE EDGE WHERE I THINK THAT BEHAVIOR IS IMPROPER, IT'S UNACCEPTABLE, AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED.\n\nWE HAD AN INSTANCE WITH A COUNCIL MEMBER THAT DID THAT WHO'S NO LONGER ON THE COUNCIL AND THAT WAS AN UGLY SITUATION.\n\nBUT AT LEAST IN THAT CASE, WE HAD THE ABILITY TO WRITE AND DID WRITE A LETTER OF CENTER TO LET THAT COUNCIL MEMBER KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T APPROVE OF THAT AND EVENTS ROLLED ON FROM THERE.\n\nWE DON'T HAVE THAT MECHANISM IN PLACE WITH OUR VOLUNTEER MEMBERS AND I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE.\n\nI THINK I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF KEEPING THE HIGHLIGHT AND CLAUSE HERE WITH THE MODIFICATION OF REMOVING THE REFERENCES TO THEIR PRIVATE LIFE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EVERYBODY'S RIGHT TO LIVE THEIR PRIVATE LIFE WHEREVER THEY WANT TO, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT AFFECTING ANYONE ELSE.\n\nBUT I THINK WE ALSO SHOULD BE ALLOWED SOME MEANS OF DISCIPLINE OF ONE FORM OR ANOTHER TO THE POINT OF ACTUAL REMOVAL IN-BETWEEN TERMS OR WHATEVER, IF THE BEHAVIOR SO WARRANTS IT.\n\nTHAT SHOULD BE IN THE DISCRETION OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE CITIZENS DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT WE DID THAT.\n\nTHERE'S ALWAYS OUR NEXT ELECTION TO GET GARBAGE OUT.\n\nANYWAY, THAT'S MY THOUGHTS ON IT.\n\n>> I AGREE WITH SEVERAL OF THE SEDIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED.\n\nMR. SCOTT MENTIONED WE NEED A BASELINE, AND AS OF RIGHT NOW WE DON'T.\n\nIF WE TOOK ACTION WHILE AS OF RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST AMBIGUOUS.\n\nOUT THERE YOU CAN DO THIS IF YOU WANT.\n\nBUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO GO BACK ON TO EXPLAIN OURSELVES? WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING TRANSPARENT AND WE HAVE A SYSTEM FOR HOW WE GO ABOUT THINGS THAT WAY.\n\nIT'S CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHAT OUR PROCESS IS GOING TO BE.\n\nI THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMETHING WRITTEN, SOMETHING THAT'S HANDED ABOUT WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE BECAUSE WE'RE SELECTED BY THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO SIT IN THESE SEATS AND THEN THEREBY WE WERE GIVEN THESE TYPES OF ROLES AND ABILITY AND POWER.\n\nULTIMATELY THAT RESPONSIBILITY FALLS BACK ON US WHEN THINGS ARE NOT BEING CONDUCTED OR STAFF'S GOING TO HAVE TO TRACK THEM DOWN TO COMPLETE A TRAINING OR IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THE BARE MINIMUM OF SHOWING UP ON TIME AND THERE'S JUST FOLLOWING UP A LIST OF HOW TO YOU BRING UP GRIEVANCES AND THINGS OR QUESTIONS YOU GO.\n\nHAVING THE ALL SPELLED OUT AS JUST SMART WISE AND THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS SO WE HAVE A BASELINE AND EVERYONE WHO AGREES TO SERVE IN A POSITION KNOWS WHAT THEIR EXPECTED OF IN THAT ROLE.\n\n[00:45:06]\n\nI APPRECIATE IT.\n\nMR. RUSSELL'S RECOMMENDATION AND I WAS COMPLETELY IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU MENTIONED OF POSSIBLY ADDING THAT ACTIVELY PROMOTE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT, GOOD CITIZENSHIP, AND THEN AS HE MENTIONED, JUST ADDING THAT BEGINNING PIECE OF BEING MINDFUL THAT YOU REPRESENT THE CITY AS A MEMBER.\n\nI THINK SOME OF THAT OTHER STUFF FALLS IN WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT NOT WANTING TO HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS, NOT DISCLOSING INFORMATION THAT YOU SHOULDN'T, BUT REALLY ULTIMATELY WE JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SERVE WHO WANT TO SERVE AND SERVE IN AN UPSTANDING WAY THAT MAKES THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY PROUD.\n\nI AGREE, WE DON'T WANT TO FALL INTO A TRAP AS MR. MCCLENDON SET OF NITPICKING WHEN SOMEBODY'S DOING SOMETHING IN THEIR PERSONAL TIME.\n\nNO. YOU SENT A TEXT MESSAGE OR YOU HAD A PERSONAL PHONE CALL THAT MENTIONED ONE THING AND DOES THAT THEN GETS SPREAD ACROSS AS PUBLIC VERSUS WHEN YOU POST SOMETHING ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AS WE PREVIOUSLY HAD TO DEAL WITH WITH FORMER COLLEAGUE OF BERATING A SPECIFIC STAFF MEMBER AND INFLUENCING HOW DECISIONS WERE MADE.\n\nIT JUST WASN'T THE WAY TO HANDLE THAT SITUATION.\n\nHAVING AN AVENUE FOR HOW PEOPLE CAN SHARE THEIR GRIEVANCES AND A PROCESS FOR IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS OR ANY QUESTIONS AND THEN IT COMING TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEN IT GOING TO COUNSEL.\n\nI THINK THAT THAT'S WHY ISN'T SMART THAT WAY.\n\nWE'RE NOT MAKING RASH DECISIONS. THERE ISN'T.\n\nIT'S NOT FALLING TO THE SHOULDERS OF ONE INDIVIDUAL STAFF PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL PERSON TO SAY, HEY, THIS IS ALL OUT OF WHACK AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.\n\nSOMETHING THAT MR. SCOTT MENTIONED AND IT'S BEEN ON MY MIND, AS WELL AS THE BACKGROUND CHECK ISSUE.\n\nWE DO REQUIRE VOLUNTEERS FOR OUR CITY TO GO THROUGH A BACKGROUND CHECK.\n\nIF THERE'S A REALLY NEAT SYSTEM FOR CITIZENS THAT AREN'T AWARE THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL THE VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY, WHETHER IT'S AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER, WHETHER IT'S AT THE MUNICIPAL COURT, WHETHER IT IS AT THE BE HEALTHY 5K, AND YOU CAN SELECT ANY EVENTS THAT YOU WANT TO SIGN UP FOR.\n\nTHERE'S A WHOLE COOL VOLUNTEER LOG, BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A REALLY SIMPLE BACKGROUND CHECK AND YOU HAVE TO DO THAT TO VOLUNTEER IN THE KIDS' SCHOOLS.\n\nCHURCHES REQUIRE THAT.\n\nI KNOW MY CHURCH REQUIRED IT FOR ME TO TEACH AND BE INVOLVED IN OUR YOUTH AND EDUCATION, SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A LARGE REQUEST.\n\nI DON'T KNOW HOW SOME OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FEEL ABOUT THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S ASKING TOO MUCH.\n\nMR. MCCLENDON, I SEE YOU'RE SMACK.\n\n>> WELL, AS LONG AS THE COUNCIL MEMBERS DON'T HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S FAIR TO IMPOSE THAT ON VOLUNTEERS.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n>> WE CAN SAY, YOU WANT ME TO BRING THIS FORWARD, STRIKING OUT THAT SECTION OR ADDING, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO THAT AND THEN LOOKING AT GOING FORWARD WITH A BACKGROUND CHECK OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT ME TO START INCORPORATING NOW TOO? THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE OF THE PROCESS OF APPOINTMENT, THEN FALLING INTO THIS NEW SECTION OF EXPECTATIONS THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS.\n\nTHAT IF YOU'RE CHOSEN, DO YOU AGREE AND WE COULD ADD THAT AT THE END OF THE APPLICATION TO THAT.\n\nYOU WILL AGREE THAT YOU'LL DO A BACKGROUND CHECK PRIOR TO APPOINTMENT, PRIOR TO TAKING YOUR SEAT OR YOUR OATH.\n\nWE COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR WHAT DO WE COULD DO IS, IT'S UP TO THE COUNCIL.\n\nWE WILL ALSO HAVE THE COUNCIL POLICY EVALUATION, WHICH DID NOT EXIST UNTIL ABOUT TWO MEETINGS AGO.\n\nTHAT IF WE WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT, WE COULD DO THAT TOO.\n\nIT'S TOTALLY UP TO THE COUNCIL RIGHT NOW.\n\nTHE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TIME BECAUSE THERE IS NO PRESSING MATTER.\n\nI WANT TO REITERATE THAT RIGHT NOW.\n\nTHERE IS NO MATTER THAT IS BEFORE THIS COUNCIL OR THAT'S GOING TO COME BEFORE THIS COUNCIL IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.\n\nI HOPE NOT IN CASE UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN YET OR KNOW ABOUT THAT IS BEFORE THIS COUNCIL.\n\nYOU HAVE TIME, WHICH I'M SURE.\n\nSOME OF THE OTHER ONES, I'M SURE YOU TO COUNCILOR JOHNSON WOULD SAY, IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT NOW WHILE YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY OR SOME SITUATION IN MIND, AND YOU'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS BASED ON NEUTRALITY, BASED ON BALANCE, BASED ON TRANSPARENCY INSTEAD OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS HURRIED SO THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING.\n\n>> I THINK WE'RE PRETTY MUCH IN AGREEMENT ON MOST OF THIS 97%.\n\nI'M LOOKING AT MY OTHER TWO COMMITTEE MEMBERS.\n\nI DON'T THINK THIS NEEDS TO COME TO OUR COMMITTEE TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL SINCE WE'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IT AND I WOULD AGREE.\n\nI KNOW IT'S NOT PRESSING, BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN? THIS IS GET IT ADDRESSED WOULD BE MY THOUGHT.\n\n[00:50:03]\n\n>> THIS A GENERAL DIRECTION TO TAKE OUT THAT SECTION 4 AND THEN LEAVE FIVE AND ADD IN BEING MINDFUL? THEN DID YOU WANT ME TO ADD SOMETHING ON THE APPOINTMENTS PROCESS ABOUT ADDING A BACKGROUND CHECK?\n\n>> I THINK WE CAN HOLD OFF ON THAT TILL THE COMMUNITY COMES BACK WITH ITS DECISION.\n\nIF THE COUNCIL'S WILLING TO DO THIS.\n\n>> LET'S ADDRESS ONE MORE THING HERE, WHICH IS THE YOUTH MEMBERS.\n\nTHEN THIS IS JUST OPEN DISCUSSION.\n\nY'ALL JUST THINK ABOUT.\n\n>> THIS IS USE MEMBERS IN GENERAL?\n\n>> YES. ALL OF THEM SO OUR MAYOR'S YOUTH COUNCIL AND OUR YOUTH MEMBERS.\n\nWE HAVE VOTING MEMBERS ACTUALLY ON SOME OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES.\n\nOUR PLAN AND ZONING HAS A YOUTH MEMBER, BUT HE'S A NON-VOTING, BUT PART OF THE BOARD IS VOTING.\n\n>> WHETHER OR NOT THAT POSITION VOTES, WE WOULD STILL.\n\nI THINK SPELLING OUT THE EXPECTATIONS, WHEN THEY'RE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE TRAINING AND LETTING STAFF KNOW.\n\nBECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE GOAL OF PUTTING SOME OF THESE YOUTH IN THESE POSITIONS IS TO EMPOWER THEM TO TAKE ON FUTURE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS.\n\nA BARE MINIMUM OF, YOU NEED TO BE TIMELY, YOU NEED TO LET THE STAFF LIAISON KNOW WHEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT AND WE CAN'T CONDUCT BUSINESS WITHOUT A QUORUM.\n\nTHOSE SIMPLE EXPECTATIONS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH THEM AS WELL.\n\nTHEN MAYBE THEIRS IS JUST AS SIMPLE AS THAT, BE MINDFUL THAT YOU ARE A REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND WE WANT YOU TO PROMOTE.\n\nI THINK THAT'S FIVE BULLET POINT WOULD HIT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU.\n\nTHERE'S NOT CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ISN'T.\n\nWE MAY NEED TO SPELL THAT ONE OUT, BUT MAYBE NOT.\n\nTHEY MAY NOT HAVE TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME BULLET LIST AS A ADULT SERVING MEMBER.\n\n>> WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ADD A SECTION INTO POLICY 40 THAT ADDRESSES YOUTH MEMBERS AND SPELL OUT MAYOR'S YOUTH COUNCIL AND ANY YOUTH MEMBER ON BOARD OR COMMISSION AND COMMITTEE AND THEN MAYBE EVEN IF I'M JUST RESTATING THE OTHERS, BUT IT'S CLEAR.\n\nWHAT ABOUT CONCERNS ON A YOUTH MEMBER? IF SOMEBODY WERE TO COME FORWARD WITH A CONCERN ABOUT A YOUTH MEMBER, YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THIS SAME PROCESS OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO?\n\n>> I THINK YOU'RE NICE AND BEETLE LIBERAL LADY AND SAY, THAT THE KIDS NEED TO HARD LEARN RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nYOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED TO SUBDUCT.\n\nYOU JUST DIDN'T WALK IN AND JUMP ON.\n\nIT'S AN HONOR TO BE ON THAT BOARD AND THERE NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\nALL NEED TO LEARN ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\nBUT THEN AGAIN, YOU GOT TO SET A PRECEDENT SOONER OR LATER TO LET EVERYBODY ELSE KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.\n\nWE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH KIDS NOT SHOWING UP FOR MEETINGS.\n\n>> WE DO.\n\n>> WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT.\n\nWON'T YOU AGREE VICTORIA, YOU'RE THERE A LOT?\n\n>> ANY OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT? IS THERE ANY PART OF WHAT I'M CURRENTLY PRESENTING, WHAT'S CURRENTLY ON HERE THAT YOU DON'T WANT APPLIED TO A YOUTH MEMBER THEN I GUESS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET?\n\n>> THAT'S WHERE I WAS GETTING STUCK.\n\nI DON'T REALLY THINK YOU CAN EXCUSE YOUTH MEMBERS FROM ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE'RE EXPECTING BECAUSE WE PUT THEM IN WHAT TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN ADULT ROLES.\n\nI THINK WE'RE FAIR AND EXPECTING THEIR RESPONSE TO BE ADULT BEHAVIOR.\n\nI DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO LESSEN THE RULES FOR THEM.\n\nIN FACT, I WOULD SUGGEST ADDING PICKING UP YOUR CLOTHES AND PUTTING YOUR DISHES IN THE SINK TO THEM.\n\n>> HELPING WITH CHORES.\n\n>> WHILE WE'RE AT IT, BUT NOW BEING SERIOUS NO, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON TO.\n\n>> I DON'T NEITHER.\n\n>> I THINK IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A QUORUM BECAUSE A YOUTH MEMBER DOESN'T SHOW UP HERE.\n\nIT HAS EXACTLY THE SAME EFFECT ON THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IS IF ONE OF THE ADULT MEMBERS DOESN'T SHOW UP.\n\nEQUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND EQUAL RULES.\n\n>> I'M JUST WONDERING, WHEN WE PUT THESE RULES OUT THERE AND ONCE IT'S GOING TO HURT THE RECRUITING SAYING, WELL, ALL OF THESE RULES.\n\nI MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE OFF. I MIGHT HAVE TO DO THIS.\n\nBUT ANYWAY WELL, I'M JUST NOT GOING TO JOIN AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT WOULD GO.\n\n>> WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE CAN'T MISS MEETINGS.\n\nWE'RE JUST SAYING THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT, IF YOU COULD GIVE US 72 HOUR NOTICE BECAUSE THAT HELPS US WITH A QUORUM AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A QUORUM PRESENT FOR THAT BORDER COMMISSION MEETING.\n\nTHERE ARE SOME THAT HAVE AN ATTENDANCE RULE ALREADY IN PLACE.\n\nYOU HAVE TO ATTEND 75% OF THE CALLED MEETINGS OR YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY NOT QUALIFIED TO BE ON THAT AND YOU'RE REMOVED.\n\nTHERE'S ALREADY SOME OF THOSE ABSENCES FOR THAT IN PLACE ALREADY.\n\n[00:55:05]\n\nWE'RE JUST ASKING THAT WE TELL YOU WHICH STAFF.\n\nIF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT, YOU NEED TO LET WHOEVER KNOW.\n\nIF YOU'RE NOT GOING MAKE THE CBA, YOU NEED TO LET MONICA KNOW 72 HOURS AHEAD OF TIME SO SHE CAN COUNT AND MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT EVERYBODY AND SAY, WE HAVE A QUORUM FOR THIS COUNCIL, MUCH LIKE SHE DOES FOR YOU ALL.\n\nIF WE CALL A SPECIAL MEETING, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT CONSIDERATION TO ASK ALL THE COUNCIL, CAN YOU MAKE THIS SPECIAL DAY THAT'S UNUSUAL AT AN UNUSUAL TIME.\n\nIF YOU ALL SAY YES OR IF WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM YOU OR WE DON'T KNOW, THEN IT HELPS FOR US TO KNOW WE CAN HAVE A MEETING GO FORWARD.\n\n>> IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF WE TOOK OUR RULES, PUT IT IN FRONT OF SAYING YOU ONLY DO.\n\nWOULD YOU ALL CONSIDER ADAPTING THESE RULES FOR YOU AND SEE IF THE ROWDY JEFF'S ARE STARTING TO GETTING THE STORY OUT, WHATEVER\n\n>> I THINK YOUR CURRENT MAYOR'S YOUTH COUNCIL WOULD SAY THEY'RE NOT STRICT ENOUGH.\n\n>> THAT IS VERY TRUE.\n\n>> IF YOU ASK THEM, THEY WILL TELL YOU IT'S NOT STRICTLY.\n\n>> THAT IS VERY TRUE.\n\n>> WE USED TO DO TEEN COURT HERE IN BURLINGTON AND WHAT THAT ONE DID UP HAPPENING WAS THAT THOSE TEENS WERE WAY MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN WE.\n\nMATS SHAKING HIS HEAD BECAUSE HE WAS THE PROSECUTOR.\n\n>> THEY WERE HARDER ON THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS THAN ADULTS ARE.\n\nWHEN YOU COME TO MAYOR'S YOUTH COUNCIL MEETINGS, THEY SAY THE SAME THING.\n\nWE SHOULD BE A LOT MORE LIMITING ON WHO WE ALLOW IN AND HAVING HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF THEMSELVES AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND SAYING, YOU SHOULD BE HERE.\n\nYOU SHOULD LET MS. MONICA KNOW WHEN YOU CAN'T MAKE A MEETING SO THAT WE CAN CONDUCT BUSINESS OR WE CAN'T.\n\nTHEY'RE PRETTY TOUGH ON EACH OTHER.\n\n>> THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM ADAPTING OUR RULES.\n\nMAYBE, I DON'T KNOW.\n\n>> BUT IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO POP UP.\n\nWE'RE JUST SAYING, IF YOU COULD PROVIDE.\n\nIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN WE HAD A FURBY MEETING, WE HAD TO COME BACK THAT AFTERNOON.\n\nI ENDED UP NOT HAVING CHILDCARE.\n\nI CALLED AMANDA, ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A QUORUM OR AM I GOING TO HAVE TO SIT MY KIDS IN THE FRONT ROW WITH A TABLET BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE CHILDCARE ANY LONGER.\n\nTHINGS ARE GOING TO POP UP.\n\nTHIS IS JUST A GENERAL.\n\nTHIS IS WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE, AND SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE GETTING TO A ROLE, JOBS CHANGE, COMMITMENTS CHANGE AND THEY HAVE TO SAY, I CAN'T SERVE IN THAT CAPACITY ANYMORE.\n\nBUT AS OF RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A REALLY GOOD POSITION BECAUSE MOST OF OUR BOARDS HAVE QUIET A LIST OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ITCHING TO SERVE IN THOSE CAPACITIES.\n\nTHIS IS THE PERFECT TIME, LIKE IT HAS BEEN SAID MULTIPLE TIMES TONIGHT.\n\nTHIS IS A CALM LOW AND WE'RE NOT BEING REACTIVE TO SOMETHING, BUT WE ARE TRYING TO SAY GOING FORWARD AS THIS COMMUNITY GROWS, AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WANT TO SERVE IN THESE CAPACITIES.\n\nTHESE ARE OUR EXPECTATIONS AND IF YOU PUT IT OUT THERE, THEN PEOPLE WILL EITHER AGREE OR THEY WON'T.\n\nBUT AS I MENTIONED, WE ALREADY HAVE SOME OF THESE EXPECTATIONS TO JUST VOLUNTEER ANYWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY.\n\nI DON'T THINK IT'S ASKING FOR TOO MUCH.\n\n>> I THINK WE'RE ON BOARD WITH, THEY FOLLOW THE SAME RULES.\n\n>> I'LL BRING THIS FORWARD AND THEN JUST SO COUNSEL KNOWS, ONCE I BRING THIS FORWARD AND YOU ALL ADOPT IT.\n\nTHEN I WILL SCHEDULE TIME ON EVERY BOARD, COMMISSION, AND COMMITTEES SCHEDULE TO BRING FORWARD THE WHOLE POLICY OF 40 BECAUSE IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO EDUCATE THEM ON HOW THEY ACTUALLY GOT ON THE BOARD AND THEN NOW WHERE WE'RE AT.\n\nIF I DO IT IN A TOTAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENT, I THINK THAT'LL BE BETTER FOR THEM AND THEN HIT SOME POINTS THERE FOR THEM.\n\n>> ONE OTHER THING, AMANDA, ON THE BURLESON RULES OF ORDER.\n\n>> YES. SORRY.\n\n>> COUNCIL POLICY 17.\n\nDO WE HAVE A POINT OF FILIBUSTER THERE ALSO?\n\n>> YES, I BELIEVE SO.\n\nWE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THAT ONE NEXT, THE BURLESON RULES OF ORDER.\n\n>> I DIDN'T SEE IT ON THIS SLIDE.\n\n>> LET ME.\n\n>> SINCE YOU'RE PULLING IT UP, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO REFERENCE, COUNCIL, POLICY 17 IN THERE.\n\nTHAT WAY IF WE MAKE CHANGES, IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE ON THE MORE MAYORS?\n\n>> CORRECT.\n\n>> OKAY.\n\n>> I WILL SHORTEN THAT TO SAY THAT WE'LL ADOPT THE BURLINGTON RULES OF ORDER ACROSS AND REFER BACK TO POLICY 17.\n\nWHEN WE CHANGE IT THERE, WE WON'T HAVE TO BE CHANGING IT EVERY TIME.\n\n[Items 3.C. & 3.D. ]\n\nTHE NEXT TWO ITEMS, ITEMS C AND D, HAVE TO DO WITH CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS.\n\nONE IS ON A SCHEDULE AND THE OTHER ONE IS JUST THE OVERVIEW OF THE ACTUAL POLICY.\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO REVIEW POLICY NUMBER 17 THAT THE COUNCIL HAS,\n\n[01:00:06]\n\nWHICH IS COUNCIL POLICY ESTABLISHING COUNCIL MEETING RULES AND PROCEDURES.\n\nWHAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IS, WE HAVE REVIEWED THIS ON THE BOTTOM.\n\nI WANT YOU TO BE MINDFUL THAT WE'VE REVIEWED THIS POLICY NOW.\n\nWE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT ANNUALLY.\n\nYOU CAN SEE WE DID IT TWICE IN 2021, BUT IN JANUARY 2020, FEBRUARY 21, AUGUST 21, JUNE 22ND.\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING GOING ON EITHER WITH POLICY 17, OR THE WAY THAT WE'RE CONDUCTING MEETINGS, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.\n\nIT'S JUST AN ANNUAL REVIEW THAT WE DO BECAUSE I THINK I SAID WHEN WE FIRST LOOKED AT THIS, IT PASSED IN 1985 AND THEN WE NEVER LOOKED AT IT AGAIN UNTIL 2020.\n\nIT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION BY CITIZEN WHO SAID YOUR POLICY SAYS YOU CAN'T TAKE UP ANY NEW ITEMS AFTER 10:00 AND YOU ALL ARE TAKING NEW ITEMS UP AFTER 10:00 O'CLOCK, AND SHE WAS RIGHT.\n\nWE NAMED A PLAZA AFTER HER, BY THE WAY.\n\nWHO BROUGHT THAT TO MY ATTENTION? [NOISE] RIGHT NOW, POLICY 17 HAS SEVEN SECTIONS.\n\nTHE AUTHORITY FOR HOLDING THE MEETING, WHICH IS THE BORING ATTORNEY STUFF THAT MAT MADE ME PUT IN THERE.\n\n[LAUGHTER] THE MEETING AGENDAS, THE COUNCIL MEETINGS, THE RULES, THE PROCEDURES, AND THE CONDUCT, THE ORDER OF THE BUSINESS, WHICH BY THE WAY, SECTION 4 HAS CHANGED MULTIPLE TIMES AND I IMAGINE IT WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE.\n\nTHAT IS NOT A BAD THING, THAT IS, THE COUNCIL ADJUSTING TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR GROWTH, AND OUR CITIZENSHIP.\n\nBURLESON RULES OF ORDER, WHICH WE'RE VERY PROUD OF, MAYOR AND THE MAYOR PRO TEM, AND THEN THE AUDIO/VIDEO USE.\n\nTHOSE ARE THE SECTIONS.\n\nSECTION 2, THE MEETING AGENDAS.\n\nTHIS STATES WHO PREPARES THE AGENDAS AND WHO DOES THE POSTING.\n\nIN THIS POLICY 17, IT SAYS THAT THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE WILL PREPARE AND ASSEMBLE AND DO EVERYTHING WITH THE AGENDA, AND THEN THE CITY SECRETARY'S OFFICE WILL POST THE AGENDA.\n\nTHAT'S WHAT THAT IS IN THAT ONE.\n\nPLACING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA.\n\nIT DOES SAY THE MAYOR OR ANYONE COUNSEL MEMBER CAN PLACE ANY ITEM ON THE AGENDA.\n\nI WANT THAT TO REMEMBER THAT THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FROM 1985 TILL NOW, THAT ANYONE COUNCIL MEMBER CAN.\n\nAS STAFF, IF WE'RE DIRECTED BY COUNCIL MEMBER TO PUT AN ITEM ON THE AGENDA, WE PLACE THAT ITEM ON THE AGENDA.\n\nTHAT'S OUR JOB. THE AGENDA PACKET, IT SAYS WHAT THE CONTENT IS.\n\nIT'LL LIST THAT WE WANT YOU TO HAVE A MEMO.\n\nWE WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING THE FINANCIAL IMPACT.\n\nTHIS IS STAFF'S REQUIREMENTS.\n\nWANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION, ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT'S IN THAT SECTION.\n\nTHE ITEM PAGES.\n\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE TELL YOU TO DO A MEMO, ALL THE PERTINENT INFORMATION IS ON THERE.\n\nWHERE'S THE BACKGROUND? WHEN DID THIS START? HOW LONG? BECAUSE THAT IS OUR HISTORICAL DATA THERE, THAT'S OUR HISTORICAL REPORT.\n\nA POWERPOINT PRESENTATION CAN GIVE YOU AT SOME POINT, SOME LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE ITEM BEFORE YOU, BUT A GOOD POWERPOINT PRESENTATION ISN'T GOING TO HAVE WRITTEN OUT VERBATIM YOUR DEPARTMENT MEMO.\n\nTHERE ARE SOME TIDBITS IN THOSE TWO APARTMENT MEMOS THAT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FINESSE TO THEM THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE STAFF IS GIVING YOU.\n\nALSO FOR US AS STAFF, IF I GO BACK TWO YEARS FROM NOW AND SAY, WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DID I DO THAT? I CAN READ THAT THROUGH.\n\nWE HAVE SOME GREAT STAFF MEMOS THAT DIRECTORS WRITE THAT WHEN I GO BACK AND READ THEM, IT MAKES VERY CLEAR WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AND IT HELPS ME UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO IN THE MEETING.\n\nCONSENT AGENDA.\n\nTHIS IS WHERE COUNCIL GIVES AUTHORITY TO THE CITY MANAGER, AND THIS HAS CHANGED.\n\nFROM 2021/2022, IT'S ALL CHANGED.\n\nWHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE CITY MANAGER CAN PLACE ANYTHING ON THE CONSENT AGENDA.\n\nEXCEPT FOR ELECTIONS OR ISSUANCE OF BONDS, THEY CAN'T BE ON THERE.\n\nTHEN FIRST READING OF ORDINANCES, IT SAYS, TRADITIONALLY SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE CONSENT AGENDA.\n\nI KNOW THAT MAY BE SOMETHING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TOO.\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBERS OBLIGATION, THIS IS MUCH LIKE COUNCIL POLICY 40 THAT JUST I GARNISHED FROM HERE TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO STUDY BEFORE THE MEETINGS, YOU'RE GOING TO INCLUDE, YOU'RE GOING TO TELL STAFF AHEAD OF TIME.\n\nIF YOU DO FIELD OPERATIONS OR INQUIRIES, SO YOU TAKE A DRIVE OUT THERE, YOU'RE GOING TO SHARE THAT DATA.\n\nIF YOU TAKE PICTURES, YOU'RE GOING TO SHARE THAT DATA WITH STAFF, ESPECIALLY THE STAFF MEMBER THAT'S GOING TO BE STANDING AT THIS PODIUM.\n\nYOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT AND WE'RE DIRECTING THAT, WE'RE GIVING THEM A FAIR CHANCE TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE YOU A COMPLETE PICTURE.\n\nBECAUSE SOMETIMES WE'RE SO CLOSE TO IT, WE THINK WE'RE GIVING YOU ALL THE PERTINENT INFORMATION, BUT WE DEAL WITH IT EVERY DAY.\n\nTHERE'S SOME TIMES WHEN YOU MAY HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN.\n\n[01:05:01]\n\nIF YOU GIVE US THOSE QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME, MUCH LIKE YOU ALL DID FOR ME FOR POLICY 40, I COULD TAILOR WHAT I'M SAYING HERE, PLUS, IT'S ALREADY IN THE AGENDA PACKET, SO WE'VE GOT A WHOLE PICTURE THERE.\n\nSECTION 3 IS THE COUNCIL MEETING RULES, AND THAT COVERS WHAT THE PRESIDING OFFICER DOES, THE BURLESON RULES OF ORDER EXECUTIVE SESSION.\n\nIT ALSO SAYS IN THERE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ADOPT AN ANNUAL MEETING CALENDAR EVERY YEAR.\n\nIT ALSO TALKS ABOUT CITIZENS APPEARANCE.\n\nTHIS IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAS CHANGED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE YEARS.\n\nCOVID AFFECTED THIS ONE.\n\nDURING COVID, WHEN WE WERE ALL REMOTE, WE STARTED TO ALLOW SOME ONLINE SPEAKER CARDS.\n\nWE HAD THAT VERY WIDE OPEN, VERY BROAD, AND THEN WE'VE NARROWED THAT BACK DOWN NOW THAT WE'RE IN PERSON.\n\nONLINE SPEAKER CARDS CAN BE SUBMITTED FOR ITEMS LISTED ON THE AGENDA, BUT NOT JUST CITIZEN'S APPEARANCE, CAN BE AN ONLINE SPEAKER CARD.\n\nTHEN OF COURSE THAT E&F ALL GO TOGETHER THERE.\n\nWE'RE NOT SAYING TO CHANGE THE TIME OR TO LIMIT THE WAY, ACTUALLY STATE LAW TELLS YOU THAT AT ANY OPEN MEETING ANYBODY CAN COME AND DO A CITIZEN'S APPEARANCE, WE CAN'T SAY NO, THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK AT ANYTIME.\n\nEVEN IF WE HAVE A SPECIAL BUDGET WORKSHOP AND WE'RE LIKE, WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC, WHICH WE WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.\n\nBUT IF WE HAD DIDN'T WANT TO, WE COULD DO THAT.\n\nBUT IT DOES SAY THAT WE CAN DETERMINE OUR OWN RULES AND REGULATIONS ON HOW CITIZENS APPEARANCES ARE, AND THERE IS NO LAW THAT TELLS US WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES, WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES.\n\nYOU HAVE TO BE AT THE VERY BEGINNING SO THAT YOU CAN GO HOME, OR WE CAN PUT YOU AT THE VERY END OR IN THE MIDDLE OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO THAT, WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THAT ON THE AGENDA.\n\nWE HAVE TO GIVE CLEAR, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO EVERYBODY DURING CITIZEN'S APPEARANCE AND THERE ARE RULES ABOUT THE COUNCIL WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT REPLY BACK WITH.\n\nON THE CITIZEN'S APPEARANCE, I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO REALIZE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN THE PLACE THAT IT SAID, IT CAN MOVE AROUND AND WE DON'T HAVE TO, THIS IS ALL COUNCIL'S PURVIEW.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO DO THREE MINUTES, YOU WANT TO DO ONE MINUTE.\n\nI KNOW A CITY THAT PUT IT AT THE VERY END, AND IT'S ONE MINUTE.\n\nYOU HAVE TO REGISTER 24 HOURS AHEAD OF TIME, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF RULES YOU CAN DO.\n\nWE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT, WE'RE NOT IN THAT EASTERN SIDE OF THE METROPLEX, SO WE PROBABLY WON'T NEED TO DO THAT.\n\nTHIS IS THE ORDER OF THE AGENDA.\n\nRIGHT NOW, THIS IS CURRENTLY WHAT COUNCIL HAS ADOPTED.\n\nIF YOU'LL NOTICE, WE DON'T FOLLOW THIS [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE IT SAYS REPORTS WILL BE AT THE END AFTER GENERAL ACTION ITEMS AND WE HAVE MOVED THOSE TO THE FRONT.\n\nBUT THIS WAS THE ADOPTED ORDER THAT COUNCIL DID THE LAST TIME YOU-ALL REVIEWED IT IN JUNE OF 2022.\n\nAPPARENTLY, WE DIDN'T STICK TO IT.\n\n[LAUGHTER] DIDN'T END. WE'RE GOOD. THE ONLY THING RIGHT NOW THAT I HAD AND THIS WAS GOING TO GO INTO OUR CALENDAR FOR NEXT YEAR, IS THAT I WOULD LIKE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER TO DO ALL PROCLAMATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS ONCE A MONTH ON THE SECOND MEETING OF THE MONTH.\n\nTHAT WAY WE ALL KNOW WE CAN SCHEDULE EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT'S WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE.\n\nTHEN IT ALSO GIVES OUR OFFICE TIME TO GET READY FOR THAT.\n\nWE CAN FIT THAT IN.\n\nIF WE'RE DOING IT AND WE DON'T HAVE REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN FRONT OF IT, THAT IT'S THE SECOND MEETING OF THE MONTH, AS SOON AS WE START, RECALL THE ORDER, WE DO OUR PRESENTATIONS AS MUCH LIKE WE HAVE THEM LISTED NOW.\n\nEVERYBODY WILL KNOW AND THERE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT INSTEAD OF COMING, AND THEN WE DO THIS AND THEN WE PUT THE PRESENTATIONS IN.\n\nI THINK THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE A LOT CLEARER FOR EVERYBODY.\n\nIT WILL HELP EVERYBODY OUT.\n\nTHEN DEDICATED WORKSESSION FOR REPORTS, CLEARLY STATED WITH A START TIME FOR BOTH THE WORK SESSION AND THE REGULAR AGENDA.\n\nWHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO A WORK SESSION ITEM, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A NOTATION ON THERE THAT SAYS NOTHING WILL START.\n\nTHESE SECTIONS WON'T START BEFORE 5: 30.\n\nALTHOUGH THAT MEETS THE LETTER OF THE LAW, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MEETS THE SPIRIT OF THE TEXAS OPEN MEETINGS ACT AT ALL.\n\nI THINK THAT THE ATTORNEYS IN THE ROOM WILL TELL YOU THAT SOMETIMES WE CAN GET DINGED ON THE SPIRIT.\n\nWE'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT OF IT.\n\nWE DON'T WANT EGG ON OUR FACE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING.\n\nFROM ME, THIS WORKS BETTER IF WE HAVE CLEARLY STATED, HERE'S YOUR FOUR O'CLOCK, YOUR THREE O'CLOCK, YOUR TWO O'CLOCK, YOUR FIVE O'CLOCK, I DON'T CARE WHAT TIME IT IS, WORK SESSION AND ALL THAT'S ON THERE ARE THE REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS AND THEN THERE'S A CLEAR ADJOURNMENT AND THEN THERE'S A SEPARATE AGENDA POSTED THAT SAYS HERE'S THE REGULAR AND EVERYTHING ON THERE AS FOR ACTION ITEM ONLY.\n\nAT SUIT WOULD BE ONE OF MINE.\n\nTHEN THE OTHER THING IS THE BURLESON RULES OF ORDER.\n\n[01:10:03]\n\nI'D LIKE TO CONSIDER THE COUNCIL TO REFER THIS BACK TO THE COUNCIL POLICY AND EVALUATION COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE RULES.\n\nTHEY'VE BEEN ADOPTED IN 2020 AND IT REMAINED UNCHANGED.\n\nAT THE TIME, THOSE FIT INTO WHAT WE WERE DOING.\n\nTHOSE WERE CRAFTED BY SOME VERY SMART, SMARTER-THAN-ME COUNCIL MEMBERS.\n\nWE HAD TWO ATTORNEYS AND A FINANCE GUY ON THE COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME, SO [LAUGHTER] WE DID REALLY WELL.\n\nI WOULD LIKE FOR THAT TO BE A CONSIDERATION BY COUNCIL TO DO THAT.\n\nTHEN THERE'S NOTHING REALLY TO CHANGE FOR THE MAYOR OR THE MAYOR PRO TEM THAT I CAN SEE UNLESS YOU GUYS WANT TO.\n\nTHEN AUDIO-VIDEO USE IS DICTATED BY STATE LAW, SO WE CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH THERE.\n\nIT'S AS TIGHT AS IT CAN BE AND AS LOOSE AS IT CAN BE ACCORDING TO MATT ROBISKY.\n\nCOUNCIL, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT OR SEE IF YOU WANT TO REFER THAT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANYTHING OR IF YOU JUST WANT TO LEAVE IT AS IS.\n\n>> AMANDA, IS IT OUR CHARTER THAT SAYS THE MAJORITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS CAN CALL A SPECIAL MEETING?\n\n>> YES. IT'S THE CITY SECRETARY OR IT'S IN THE CHARTER.\n\nOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL.\n\n>> MAYOR, CITY MANAGER.\n\n>> YES. DO YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE THAT, BECAUSE WE DON'T REFER TO THIS IN HERE AND WE CAN REFER BACK TO THE CHARTER BECAUSE, YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S NO REFERENCE IN THERE FOR SPECIAL MEETINGS.\n\n>> I THINK THAT ONE THROUGH ME BECAUSE I WAS CONFUSED.\n\nYEAR OR TWO AGO WE WERE VISITING THE IDEA OF CALLING A SPECIAL MEETING AND IT SAID I HAD TO HAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL.\n\nBUT THEN WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH MORE THAN TWO MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.\n\nLUCKILY, WE ENDED UP NOT HAVING TO DO WHATEVER IT WAS.\n\nI DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS AT THE TIME, BUT IT WAS SO AWKWARD BECAUSE I COULDN'T REALLY COMMUNICATE WITH MORE THAN TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THEN I WOULD BE VIOLATING OPEN MEETINGS ACT AND I HAD TO HAVE LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH ALAN AND SAYING, WHAT CAN I SAY? IT'S LIKE IF YOU SPEAK VERY BROADLY, SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS REALLY MESSY.\n\nI JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE IF IT WAS.\n\nI WAS PRETTY SURE YOU'LL HIGHLIGHT IT IN RED IN OUR ATTACHMENTS THAT IT WAS IN OUR CHARTER.\n\n>> IT'S IN OUR CHARTER.\n\n>> I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO SPELL OUT SPECIAL MEETINGS BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT THE MAYOR AND IT'S NOT THE CITY MANAGER WHO CALLS THAT MEETING, IT DOES HAVE TO IN SOME WAY MAYBE IF ONE PERSON RAISES A CERTAIN FLAG LIKE PONCHOS, THEN THAT MEANS FOUR OF US CAN NOD OUR HEADS BUT NOT SAYING ANYTHING.\n\n[LAUGHTER]. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO COLLECT TO DO THAT, BUT THAT DOES SAY IT IN OUR CHARTER.\n\n>> IT REALLY IS A DILEMMA.\n\nBUT IT WOULD TAKE A CHARTER ELECTION TO CHANGE IT.\n\n>> YES, IT WOULD.\n\n>> CORRECT.\n\n>> NORMALLY YOU WOULD SEE SOME DISCUSSION AT A COUNCIL MEETING WHERE A NUMBER OF YOU WOULD SAY, I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A SPECIAL MEETING TO DISCUSS THAT.\n\nTHAT'S WHERE THAT'S ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR.\n\n>> IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT THAT REQUEST WOULD ARISE IN AN OPEN MEETING.\n\n>> CORRECT.\n\n>> BECAUSE THAT'S UNLESS NECESSARILY THE CASE.\n\n>> IF YOU CAN CALL FOR YOUR SPECIAL MEETING, YOU THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE RIGHT NOW.\n\nYOU'VE GOT TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING TO HAPPEN.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n>> SOMEBODY WASN'T THINKING WHEN THEY WROTE THAT PART, I GUESS.\n\n>> IT WAS PROBABLY TO PREVENT IT FROM DOING IT, BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNY AND ODD.\n\n>> I THINK IN THOSE SITUATIONS, JUST LIKE WE DID BEFORE, WE GET ON THE PHONE WITH OUR LEGAL COUNCIL AND WE ASK THEM HOW TO NAVIGATE THOSE WATERS AND WE CAN MANAGE TO NAVIGATE THOSE WATERS.\n\nBUT I WILL REFER TO THE CHARTER AND PUT THAT CHARTER LANGUAGE INTO POLICY 17 OR RECOMMEND THAT WE PUT INTO POLICY 17.\n\nI THINK POLICY 17, IF YOU GUYS ARE OKAY WITH WHERE WE'RE DIRECTION IS, MAYBE GOES TO THE COUNCIL POLICIES AND REVIEW COMMITTEE, BUT I DO WANT YOU GUYS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE ORDER OF THE COUNCIL MEETING, MAYBE LOOKING AT THAT TO WHAT WE HAVE.\n\n>> I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU AWAY FROM 17.\n\nARE WE CONSTRAINED IN SOME WAY TO ALLOW APPLICANTS OR PRESENTERS ALL THE TIME THEY WANT TO PRESENT THEIR CASE TO US, OR DO WE HAVE THE DISCRETION OF PUTTING A TIME LIMIT ON THEM?\n\n>> GO AHEAD, MATT, IF YOU WANT TO.\n\n>> YOU HAVE DISCRETION TO PUT TIME LIMITS, AS LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE.\n\nYOU WANT TO GIVE THE APPLICANT MORE TIME THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE EVERYONE MAKING THE CASE AND THEY BEAR THE BURDEN OF PROOF.\n\n>> COMING BACK TO MY CELL PHONE TOWER GUIDE THAT I HAD TO JUST WALK OUT OF THE ROOM,\n\n[01:15:04]\n\n, I WAS TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIM DRONE ON AND ON, READING TO US.\n\n>> I FORGOT ABOUT THEM.\n\n>> WRITTEN MATERIAL THAT HE HAD PRESENTED TO US AHEAD OF THE MEETING AND THEN CHOSE TO TAKE HIS TIME AT THE PODIUM TO READ EVERYTHING TO US THAT HE HAD HANDED US IN WRITING.\n\nI GOT A LITTLE BIT OFFENDED BY THAT.\n\n>> I GUESS THAT'S STARTED OVER.\n\n>> YEAH.\n\n>> [INAUDIBLE].\n\n>> DR. ROTJIT WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM SO HE JUST STARTED OVER.\n\nI'M LIKE, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS GUY TO SHUT UP.\n\n>> YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT IT IN RESTRICTIONS.\n\nI THINK YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CASE IN 20 MINUTES.\n\nWE'RE GOING TO BE 20 MINUTES AND THEN MAYBE GIVE THEM REBUTTAL AT THE END AFTER SOME SPEAKERS AND JUST CLOSE IT OFF THAT WAY AND SAY WE WILL GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES FOR I THINK IT WILL BE VERY COMMON.\n\nIT'S HARD TO MAKE HARD AND FAST RULES BECAUSE IT'S ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, SO YOU CAN'T REALLY PUT THE POLICY THE MOST ARE GOING TO GIVE US X OR Y BECAUSE IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S SO COMPLICATED THAT IT NECESSITATES A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.\n\nBUT I THINK AS A BODY, YOU'RE ABLE TO SET THOSE TYPE OF LIMITS.\n\n>> THERE WAS THE POINT AFTER THAT GENTLEMAN THAT HE NEEDED TO BE COGNIZANT OF OUR TIME WOULD HAVE SHOT RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE DID.\n\nI WOULD LIKE TO PUT A HARD TIME ON IT.\n\n>> I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.\n\nI THINK THE ONLY ISSUE WE HAVE IN THE CASE OF WHAT DAN'S TALKING ABOUT, WE ALL AGREED HE WOULD HAVE SHUT UP.\n\nTHERE'LL GOING TO BE TIMES WHEN ONE COUNCIL MEMBER WANTS HIM TO SHUT UP, MAYBE NOBODY ELSE DOES.\n\nI DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ADDRESSED THAT.\n\n>> THIS IS TRUE. IF THEY'RE GIVING YOU INFORMATION THAT ANOTHER COUNCIL MEMBER WANTS TO HEAR.\n\nI THINK IF YOU'RE LIBERAL, YOU CAN BE.\n\nWE CAN FIT A TIMEFRAME IN THERE.\n\n>> A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.\n\nBUT YOU MIGHT GET SEVEN DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THAT IS FROM EVERYBODY UP HERE.\n\n>> I'LL AVERAGE.\n\n>> TEN MINUTES, 10, 15.\n\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY 15.\n\n>> GIVING SOMEBODY 15 MINUTES TO STATE THEIR CASE.\n\nTHEY ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF GIVING US ALL OF THEIR ARGUMENTS AND RIDING AHEAD OF TIME.\n\nTHEY'RE REQUIRED ACTUALLY TO DO SO 72 HOURS AT A TIME, I BELIEVE IT SAYS.\n\nDO WE HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER ALL OF THAT? THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE.\n\n>> WE CAN SET THE TIME, BUT AS IN THE PAST, THE PRESIDING OFFICER HAS THE ABILITY TO EXTEND IT TO IT ANYTIME.\n\nWE'VE GOT TO WEIGH OUT IF WE NEED TO, AND ALWAYS LOOK AT OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS WHERE THEY ALL WANT TO DO IT OR NOT.\n\nIT'S NOT MY DECISION.\n\n>> I THINK WE WERE ALL LOOKING AT DAN THAT TIME GOING.\n\n>> I WAS ALL LAUGHING.\n\n>> PLEASE.\n\n>> GET IT. SIT DOWN. I'M GOING TO TACKLE HIM.\n\nSOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE ALL NIGHT LONG.\n\nWE'VE GOT A LONG AGENDA.\n\n>> YOU'RE JUST GOING TO READ THE WHOLE PACKET TO US.\n\n>> YOU'RE GOING TO READ THE ENTIRE PACKET COVER TO COVER.\n\nI'M LIKE, NO, YOU'RE NOT.\n\n>> JUST TO WEAR US DOWN.\n\n>> HE BUILT BY THE HOUR.\n\n>> [INAUDIBLE] STRATEGY DIDN'T WORK.\n\n>> I WOULD SAY IF WE'RE PUTTING SOMETHING TO POLICY, I WOULD JUST LEAVE IT UNDEFINED AS A REASONABLE TIME AND THE COUNCIL CAN SET LIMITS AS NECESSARY TO HEAR THE CASE AND JUST GO FROM THERE AND WE'LL TAKE IT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.\n\n>> CAN WE USE THE SAME SITUATION ON THE FINANCE DIRECTORS?\n\n>> NO MERCY THERE.\n\n[LAUGHTER] I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING THE HEARTBREAK AND IF YOU WANT TO DO TWO SEPARATE AGENDAS, WOULD WE ACTUALLY ADJOURN OR WILL WE JUST [OVERLAPPING]\n\n>> YES, WE WILL ADJOURN.\n\n>> ADJOURN AND THEN [OVERLAPPING]\n\n>> YES.\n\n>> RECALL THE MEETING. [NOISE] WE'D SAY THE PLEDGE AND THE PRAYER AND ALL THAT STUFF AND DO THAT PROBABLY THE SECOND ONE AND THEN THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE [OVERLAPPING]\n\n>> THAT IT'S TOTALLY UP TO COUNCIL'S DISCRETION TOO IF YOU WANT TO DO THE PLEDGE AT BOTH OR NORMALLY TRADITIONALLY OTHER COUNCILS, THEY'LL HOLD THEIR WORKSHOP, THAT'S JUST A MORE INFORMAL, CALL TO ORDER, YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES, MAYBE NOT WEAR YOUR SUIT JACKETS.\n\nWE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS AND BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMAL AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND WE'LL ADJOURN.\n\nTHERE'LL BE A HEARTBREAK ADJOURNMENT.\n\nBECAUSE EVERYBODY THAT'S ON THE REGULAR AGENDA LISTED, WE WANT TO GIVE THEM EXACT TIMES OF WHEN THEY NEED TO BE HERE INSTEAD OF IF IT'S AT FOUR O'CLOCK.\n\nIF WE START AT 4:00 LIKE WE DID TONIGHT, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR SOMETHING UNTIL 5:30, MINE COULD HAVE LASTED 30 MINUTES, WHICH WAS WHAT I WANTED.\n\nOR IT COULD LAST THIS LONG, AND THEN SOMEBODY WHO'S IN THE AUDIENCE, MAKING SURE THEY DON'T MISS IT, SO THEY GET HERE AT 4:00 AND WE'RE NOT HEARING THEM UNTIL 7:00.\n\n>> I WOULD ASSUME THERE MAY BE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT ARE HERE FOR A CONSENT AGENDA ITEM THAT WE WON'T HEAR IT UNTIL 6:30?\n\n>> CORRECT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MINDFUL.\n\nI THINK WHEN WE DO THAT, IT GIVES SOME BREAK IN THERE, AND SO IF YOU WANTED TO GO [NOISE] TO THE NEXT ONE BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS, IF YOU THINK POLICY 17 RIGHT NOW, THERE'S NOTHING TOO DRASTIC THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT MAYBE WE CAN SEND FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL POLICIES COMMITTEE TO REVIEW A LITTLE BIT MORE, AND THEN I'LL BRING THE NEXT ITEM UP AND THEN YOU\n\n[01:20:02]\n\nCAN SEE IF WE NEED SOME DISCUSSION THERE TOO.\n\nTHE NEXT ITEM.\n\n>> I WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER GIVING THE REPORTS BACK TO THE ENDS AS WE HAVE IT LINED OUT.\n\nI FEEL LIKE IT MAKES OUR MEETINGS, LIKE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT FLOWS VERY WELL, IT'S LIKE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND THEN WE VOTE ON STAFF AND THEN IT'S MORE INFORMATION.\n\nI JUST DON'T SEE THE FLOW IS THERE AND WE MOVED THAT WHEN, I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THE LOGIC WAS AND WHY WE MOVED UP REPORTS, BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE DISJOINTED TO THE PUBLIC AND KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN THEY COME TO A MEETING.\n\n>> LET ME PULL THIS UP HERE REAL QUICK.\n\n[NOISE] YOU WANT TO MOVE THAT OVER.\n\nTHIS FLOWS TOGETHER.\n\nTHE NEXT ITEM IS ITEM 3D, WHICH IS THE 2024 PROPOSED COUNCIL MEETING CALENDAR.\n\nI HAVE RECEIVED FEEDBACK ON THIS MEETING CALENDAR, AND SO I WILL SHOW YOU AN OPTION 1 THAT IS NOT AN OPTION ONE FOR ONE COUNCILMAN [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] CITY COUNCIL POLICY 17 SAYS YOU GUYS WILL ADOPT A COUNCIL CALENDAR BY DECEMBER 1ST OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S COMING AHEAD, AND TRADITIONALLY, WE HAVE ONLY PUT ON THEIR CITY COUNCIL REGULAR MEETINGS.\n\nTOMMY BEING A VERY ORGANIZED PERSON, WOULD LIKE FOR US TO ADD SOME MORE ITEMS ON THERE.\n\nI THINK WITH WITH MY PLEASURE, I LOVE TO DO THAT.\n\nI WAS SO GLAD THAT HE ASKED ME TO DO THAT AND THEN I ADDED SOME STUFF IN THERE THAT HE WAS SHOCKED ABOUT, SO DON'T BLAME TOMMY FOR THIS.\n\n[LAUGHTER] MY FIRST OPTION WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THIS.\n\nTHIS IS THE FIRST MEETING OF THE MONTH, ONE TIME A MONTH, TO START AT 9:30 AM IN THE MORNING.\n\nDO THE WORK SESSION FROM 9:30-11:00 WITH A CLEARLY POSTED AGENDA, THAT THAT'S THE WORK SESSION STARTS AT 9:30, GOES TO 11:00 AM, WE'LL DO A LUNCH BREAK THAT WON'T BE LISTED, THAT'S JUST FOR OUR INTERNAL, AND THEN WE START OUR REGULAR AGENDA AT 11:45 AM.\n\nTYPICALLY, WHAT THAT WOULD BE IS THAT THERE'S ONLY ACTION ITEMS, THERE'S NO MORE REPORTS.\n\nIT'S ONLY GOING TO BE ACTION ITEMS AT THE REGULAR AGENDAS.\n\nTHAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO IS THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S A REGULAR AGENDA, IT'S GOING TO BE ACTION ITEMS ONLY UNLESS IT'S THE SECOND MEETING OF THE MONTH AND THEN THERE'LL BE SOME NICE STUFF AT THE BEGINNING, PRESENTATIONS, PROCLAMATIONS, AND THEN AGENDA STUFF ONLY, ACTION ITEMS ONLY, SO NO MORE REPORTS.\n\nREPORTS THAT YOU HEAR WILL BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO AN ACTION ITEM THEY WANT YOU TO TAKE.\n\nTHIS WAS THE FIRST RENDITION, AND I DO WANT TO SAY THIS; THE CHARTER SAYS THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL, THIS BODY, WILL MEET AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH.\n\nIT DOES NOT SAY TWICE A MONTH, IT DOES NOT SAY YOU HAVE TO BE ON A MONDAY, IT DOESN'T SAY YOU HAVE TO BE STARTING AT 5:30 OR YOU CAN'T START EARLIER THAN ANYTIME.\n\nIT JUST SAYS THIS BODY WILL MEET AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH TO CONDUCT BUSINESS.\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE IS TOTALLY UP TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO MOVE IT, I'M JUST TELLING YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU GUYS TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DO HAVE SOME FREE FLOWING HERE AND THEN COUNCILS CHANGE, ENVIRONMENTS CHANGE, DIFFERENT THINGS ARE CHANGING.\n\nWE USED TO HAVE COUNCIL MEETINGS ON THE SECOND AND FOURTH THURSDAY'S OF THE MONTH.\n\nIT CHANGED, PEOPLE DIDN'T.\n\nTHERE WAS SOME LACK OF BEING ABLE TO GET HERE ON A THURSDAY NIGHT, AND SO WE CHANGED IT TO MONDAYS, AND WE USED TO START COUNCIL MEETINGS AT 7:00 PM.\n\nEVERYTHING CHANGES AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CHANGE.\n\nLET'S KEEP CHANGING IT. OPTION 2.\n\n[NOISE] THE OPTION 2 WOULD BE TO HAVE A WORK SESSION DEDICATED, THE FIRST MEETING OF THE MONTH STATED WITH A SEPARATELY POSTED AGENDA FOR PM WORK SESSION, THEN WE WILL TAKE A BREAK, SO LET'S SAY WE HAD AN HOUR WORTH OF SOMETHING OR MAYBE WE HAD AN HOUR-AND-A-HALF OR TWO HOURS OR MAYBE WE HAVE 30 MINUTES, IT DEPENDS ON WHERE WE'RE AT.\n\nTHEN WE WOULD STATE THAT THE REGULAR AGENDA AND I PUT DOWN HERE 5:30 OR SIX O'CLOCK.\n\nWHEN I'M LOOKING BACK AT WHEN WE'RE STARTING AT FOUR O'CLOCK, WE ARE TYPICALLY BREAKING AND COMING BACK OUT HERE ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK, 6:15 ALREADY.\n\nTHAT'S REALLY LITERALLY WHAT WE ARE DOING, CORRECT? I DON'T SEE THE TIME. WE ARE TYPICALLY FOLLOWING THAT FORMAT.\n\nONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE AT FOUR O'CLOCK IT'S AN AWKWARD TIME TO START WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE WANT YOU TO BE HERE AS LATE AS YOU HAVE TO BE HERE FOR THE AGENDA THAT WE HAVE IN THIS AGENDA TONIGHT IS PRETTY LENGTHY, SO YOU MAY BE HERE UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT, I DON'T KNOW, SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE YOU A BREAK BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SIT LONGER THAN TWO HOURS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GET SOME BREAK, HAVE SOME FOOD, RE-ENERGIZING, GET READY TO GO BACK TO THE REST OF IT.\n\nTHAT'S WHY I WOULD SAY THAT'S WHY I PUT UP THERE 5:30 OR SIX O'CLOCK.\n\n[01:25:02]\n\nTHE SECOND MEETING OF THE MONTH ON ALL MY OPTIONS, I HAVE THE SAME THING IS THAT WE WILL LIST A FOR 4A MEETING AT 4:30, AND A 4B MEETING AT FIVE O'CLOCK KNOWING THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT NEED THEM.\n\nBUT THIS GIVES STAFF THE ABILITY TO SCHEDULE AND LOOK AT THEIR SCHEDULE AND BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH WHOEVER NEEDS TO COME BEFORE THE 4A OR 4B BOARD THAT WE MEET AND HERE'S THE DATES THAT WE'RE GOING TO MEET THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE YEAR OF 2024, UNLESS A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE COMES UP.\n\nWE KNOW WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, I'M GOING TO CAVEAT EVERYTHING.\n\nI WILL NOT RULE WITH AN IRON FIST.\n\nI WILL ALLOW YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THIS ONCE YOU DECIDE ON AN OPTION, I PROMISE.\n\nTHAT WAS ONE AND THEN THE SECOND ONE WOULD GO BACK TO YOUR POINT, COUNCIL MEMBER JOHNSON, WHERE WE WOULD LIST THAT REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS BE DONE AT THE END.\n\nTHE FIRST MEETING OF THE MONTH, WE MEET, CALL IT AT 5:30 OR SIX O'CLOCK, AND THEN WE JUST RUN THROUGH EVERYTHING.\n\nWE HAVE THE ORDER THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, WHICH WE CALL EVERYTHING WE DO ALL OUR PUBLIC HEARINGS, ALL OUR DEVELOPMENT ISSUES, AND THEN AT THE VERY END, IT WOULD BE REPORTS.\n\nWE WILL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING ON THE BEGINNING SIDE OF ACTION ITEMS OR THAT SOMEBODY IS WAITING FOR THE CONSENT AGENDA.\n\nWE'LL GET TO THAT PRETTY QUICKLY.\n\nTHEN WE'D MOVE ON TO REPORTS.\n\nEITHER 5:30 OR SIX O'CLOCK.\n\nAGAIN, THE SECOND MEETING OF THE MONTH, I'VE STILL KEPT THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE 4A AND THE 4B NEEDING TO MEET IF NEEDED, AND SO THERE IS THE REGULAR AGENDA THERE.\n\nTHESE ARE THE THREE OPTIONS.\n\nI DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS WANT TO DIG INTO THESE THREE OPTIONS.\n\nOR DO YOU WANT ME TO CHOOSE?\n\n>> I'M GOING TO VETO NUMBER ONE JUST BECAUSE [BACKGROUND] NO.\n\nWELL, YES, [LAUGHTER] I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK IF, I MEAN, I'M NOT TRYING TO SOUND SELFISH OR ANYTHING, BUT I KNOW IN THE FUTURE I WON'T BE THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE THE 8.00-5.00 JOB AND I WOULD PROBABLY PRETTY MUCH MISS WORK THE ENTIRE DAY THAT DAY, AND THAT WOULD HAVE DETERRED ME FROM RUNNING HAD THIS BEEN THE WAY.\n\nAND OF COURSE, I DON'T MIND HAVING THE SPECIAL SESSIONS.\n\nTHOSE ARE NEEDED AND WE HAVE THOSE.\n\nIN FACT, WE'VE GOT ONE ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, AND THAT'S OKAY.\n\nTHAT'S FINE, BUT IF THIS WAS A REGULARLY SCHEDULED FIRST MEETING OF THE MONTH AT 09:30, I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK.\n\n>> PARDON.\n\n>> I WOULD LIKE TO VETO THE FOUR O'CLOCK.\n\nTHIS IS SUPER HARD TO MAINTAIN FOR ANYONE WITH KIDS IN SCHOOL.\n\nI RAN MY KIDS HOME AND TRIED TO LINE THEM OUT WITH THEIR CHORES AND HOMEWORK AND EVERYTHING, AND THEN I GAVE MY HUSBAND THE PEACE SIGN AND RAN OUT.\n\nSO THE FOUR O'CLOCK IS JUST NOT EASY.\n\nI THINK IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE WHO'S WORKING AS WELL.\n\nWE HAVE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HERE FOR LATER ITEMS ON OUR AGENDA, THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THEM, AND THEY LEFT WORK EARLY TO SIT HERE, AND WE MAY NOT VISIT THEIR ITEM UNTIL 6:30 OR 7:00.\n\nI THINK MAYBE FOR THE BEST BET, WHICH MEANS WE COULD GO BACK TO REALLY LONG MEETINGS, BUT I THINK IT'S JUST NOT PREDICTABLE, IS GOING BACK TO THE 5:30 START, AND PUTTING REPORTS BACK AT THE END.\n\n>> WE CAN DO THAT.\n\n>> I'M OKAY WITH HAVING REPORTS AT BOTH MEETINGS, SO IF WE NEED TO BREAK IT UP THAT WAY, THAT WE DON'T HAVE ONE MEETING A MONTH WHERE THERE'S FIVE REPORTS AND THEY'RE FIVE HOURS LONG.\n\nI DON'T GET THAT FLEXIBILITY.\n\n>> WE CLAIMED A LOT OF THE COUNCIL MEETINGS UP WHEN DAN WAS VERY PERTINENT ABOUT STREAMLINING SOME OF THE STUFF ON THE CONSENT AGENDA, WHERE WE QUIT MICRO MANAGING AS MUCH.\n\nWE TURNED A LOT OF STUFF OVER TO JANE, AND LET HER TAKE CARE OF IT.\n\nBUT I DON'T KNOW, THE MEETINGS WILL NOT GO AS LONG AS THEY USED TO. I DON'T BELIEVE.\n\nSO GOING BACK TO THE TIME, IF IT HELPS VICTORIA ADD THEM OUT AND LARRY IS GOING TO ACCOUNT ON THE SAME PAGE, AND I GUESS THEY WERE RETIRED.\n\nTHAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER ON US.\n\nONLY THING I WANT TO KEEP IS THE EXECUTIVE SESSION AT THE END, SO PEOPLE AREN'T SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR US TO COME OUT.\n\n>> THAT'S ACTUALLY THE ORDER, IS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE ADOPTED.\n\nTHE ORDER IS AT THE END.\n\nTHE EXECUTIVE SESSION IS AT THE END.\n\nTHE REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS AND EXECUTIVE SESSIONS AT THE END OF THE MEETING. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TAKING[OVERLAPPING].\n\n>> AS NEEDED. I UNDERSTAND.\n\n>> YEAH. YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF ANY CITIZEN OR EXTERNAL COMMITTEE UNLESS THEY WANT A PARTICULAR REPORT THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN LISTENING TO, EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD BE THERE.\n\nNOW, THINK ABOUT THE BUDGET AND EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE\n\n[01:30:02]\n\nGOING TO PRESENT TO YOU PREDATED BUDGET MEETINGS TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY OF WHAT WE BELIEVE THEY WILL BE, WHICH I'VE ALREADY SAID, GIVE US GRACE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE MIGHT FLEX THROUGH THE YEAR IF WE NEED THEM TO.\n\nBUT SO IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THOSE, DON'T PUT THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THAT WON'T BE WHAT WE'LL HAVE.\n\nTHIS WILL BE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT WE WOULD BE DOING IN REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS ON.\n\n>> I'M LIKE THE MAYOR, WE'RE OPEN, AND [INAUDIBLE] WE CAN DO IT AT ANY TIME.\n\nBUT ONE THING WE NEED TO CONSIDER AND NOT FORGET IS THAT CITIZENS ARE INVOLVED IN STEPS INVOLVED ALSO, AND WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE UP HERE EVERY NIGHT, ALL NIGHT.\n\n>> WELL, OPTION 1.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n>> I LOVE THE IDEA.\n\n>> I LOVE THAT IDEA TOO, BUT I UNDERSTAND.\n\nIT ISN'T FAIR TO ANYONE POTENTIALLY SERVING IN THE FUTURE TO FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT.\n\nAUTOMATIC, EVERY SINGLE MONTH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VACATION DAY, OR YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH YOUR WORK THAT YOU WON'T BE THERE.\n\nBUT I LIKED IT FOR SURE BECAUSE I CAN TAKE MY KIDS TO SCHOOL AND I COULD BE HERE ALL DAY.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n>> I AGREE WITH THAT. I RELUCTANTLY AGREE BECAUSE I LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING MORNING MEETINGS BECAUSE I'M AT A POINT IN MY CAREER WHERE MY WORK TIME IS ABOUT DISCRETION, I WANT TO MAKE IT.\n\nBUT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN IT WASN'T, AND I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE ON A COUNCIL THAT MET DURING WORKING HOURS.\n\nBECAUSE RECENTLY IS PROBABLY 20 YEARS AGO, BUT MY TIME'S CHANGED SINCE THEN, MAYBE EVEN 15, BUT I THINK IN ORDER TO KEEP THE COUNCIL DIVERSE AND NOT BECOME OVERLOADED WITH OLD, RETIRED GUYS THAT CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE COURSE TODAY, I THINK WE CAN'T DO A DAILY DURING THE WORKDAY MEETING.\n\nAND ESPECIALLY WHAT VICTORIA POINTS OUT, FEMALE OR MALE COUNCIL MEMBER WITH CHILDREN THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE ARE PROVIDED FOR AFTER SCHOOL AT FOUR O'CLOCK HOUR IS GOING TO BE REALLY TOUGH.\n\nI UNDERSTAND THAT, AND I THINK ONCE AGAIN WITH A MINDSET OF CREATING A JOB THAT CAN BE DONE BY JUST ABOUT ANYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY, WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT THIS TO BE, I THINK WE HAVE TO STAY.\n\n>> SO I WILL SAY THAT.\n\nSO WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING LIKE THAT, AND I AGREE WITH YOU 100 PERCENT THAT THAT LINKS SOME PEOPLE THAT MAYBE SERVE IN THE FUTURE.\n\nSO WE HAVE HAD A PREVIOUS COUNCIL MEMBER JUST RECENTLY WHO 5:30 WAS HARD BECAUSE THEY WORK IN FORT WORTH, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO BURLESON BY 5:30.\n\nTHERE'S ALSO THAT TO CONSIDER, THAT YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL THINKING AT 5:30, THEN TWICE A MONTH, I WILL HAVE TO TAKE AN HOUR OFF EARLY BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T.\n\nTHAT TRAFFIC, EVEN IF YOU WORKED IN FORT WORTH 15 MILES FROM HERE, WHEN YOU'RE COMING INTO TOWN.\n\nI KNOW SOME PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE IN BURLESON AND WORK IN FORT WORTH, AND SOMETIMES THEY GET HERE AT 5:35 SOMETIMES 5:45, DEPENDING ON WHAT THE TRAFFIC DOES.\n\n>> LIKE YOU'VE SAID, THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN REVISIT AS COUNCIL AND TURNS OVER CHANGES AS LIFESTYLE CHANGES.\n\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT ANY ONE OF US COULD ASK TO BE ON THE AGENDA AGAIN AND WE CAN VISIT IT, BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, I THINK WHAT WORKS FOR THOSE SERVING IN THIS CAPACITY NOW?\n\n>> DO YOU THINK OPTION 3 IS THE BEST ONE THEN?\n\n>> OPTION 3, THAT WOULD BE MY BEST OF THE FEEDBACK THAT'S BEEN SHARED.\n\nANYONE ELSE WANT TO WEIGH IN? I KNOW WE HAVE THE OTHERS THAT HAVEN'T WEIGHED IN AND RETIRED AS WELL AND ARE FLEXIBLE.\n\n>> I THINK THREE IS THE BEST ONE.\n\nI'M JUST THINKING BACK WHEN I WAS TEACHING, I COULDN'T GET HERE IN THE MORNING TIME.\n\nI HAD CLASS I DIDN'T MISS, TAKE A SICK DAY OR SOMETHING ELSE.\n\nBUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION.\n\n>> AND EVEN FOUR O'CLOCK?\n\n>> YEAH, EVEN FOUR O'CLOCK WAS TOUGH BECAUSE I COACHED BASKETBALL.\n\n>> THUS WE'RE GOING TO SAY FOUR O'CLOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR YOU TOO.\n\n>> IT WAS TOUGH TOO.\n\n>> WE STILL HAVE FORAY AND IF NEEDED AND IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE FORAY THE FIRST MEETING IF WE NEEDED TO.\n\nWE ALL LIKE IT ALL AT ONE.\n\n>> I WOULD THINK THAT OUR WHOLE THING FOR, I'M SORRY, COMES FROM JOHNSON DO GO AHEAD, THEN I'LL ADDRESS WHAT HE SAID.\n\n>> WELL, THEN IT REMAINS AT TWO.\n\nA LOT OF IT WAS WHAT HAD TO DO WITH SOME VERY LONG MEETINGS.\n\nWHEN WE CHANGED THAT AND WE WENT WITH DISCUSSION, WE WENT ONE MEETING AND THEN WE WENT WITH OUR ACTION ITEMS A SECOND, IT WAS GREAT.\n\nIT WAS REALLY GREAT AND WE SAVED A LOT OF, WELL, I DON'T KNOW, BODIES.\n\nIT WAS TOUGH WHEN WE SET UP PAYROLL TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND THERE WAS A TIME WE WERE HERE AT MIDNIGHT.\n\n[01:35:01]\n\nAS FAR AS OUR MANDATE, I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE THING.\n\nI THINK IT'S THE ORDER IN WHICH WE DO IT, THE DISCUSSION ONE TIME AND THEN OUR ACTION ITEMS THE NEXT.\n\nFOR ME, THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT, THAT WE DON'T DO THEM ALL AT THE SAME TIME.\n\n>> RIGHT.\n\n>> OF COURSE, MAYBE I'M RETIRED, I COME ANYTIME YOU WANT TO, BUT I RESPECT THE REST OF THEM, AND IF IT'S 5:36, I'M OKAY WITH THAT.\n\nJUST AS LONG AS WE DON'T, END UP LIKE WE DID BEFORE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE HERE, AT 6:00 I'M OUT.\n\n>> ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT HAVING THE REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS AT THE END OF THE MEETING, IF THE MEETING HAS JUST GONE ON SO LONG THAT NOBODY HAS ANY GAS LEFT IN THEIR TANK.\n\nWE CAN PUT THAT OFF TO THE NEXT MEETING.\n\n>> ABSOLUTELY.\n\n>> AND THAT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED.\n\nWE'VE HAD TO DO THAT IN THE PAST.\n\nI LIKE RONNIE'S IDEA.\n\nYOU COULD DO PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU WANT TO WITH YOUR TIME AS LONG AS IT'S OVER BY TEN O'CLOCK.\n\n[LAUGHTER] AND AFTER THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP ANYWAY. WE.\n\n>> NEED TO RECORD THE HEART STOP OR NO MEETINGS.\n\n>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN.\n\n>> I'LL JUST SAY 10 O'CLOCK, WE'RE GOING TO START TO SHUT DOWN.\n\n>> THAT IS TOTALLY TO THE COUNCIL'S DISCRETION.\n\nTHE PREVIOUS COUNCIL POLICY FROM 1985 SAID THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD NOT TAKE UP ANY NEW BUSINESS THAT HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN STATED TO THE COUNCIL.\n\nIF I HAD ALREADY CALLED SOMETHING FORWARD AND IT WAS 9:45 AND THAT THING LASTED UNTIL 10:30, YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING.\n\nBUT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT ITEM BECAUSE IT WAS AFTER 10 O'CLOCK.\n\nYOU WEREN'T GOING TO CALL ANY NEW BUSINESS FORWARD FOR THAT COUNCIL MEETING?\n\n>> THE REASON I SAY I HAVE A HARD NUMBER AT THE END IS SO SOMEONE DIDN'T SAY WE'LL YOU JUST DIDN'T LISTEN TO [INAUDIBLE].\n\nWE SET THE RULES TO STOP.\n\n>> THAT'S TOTALLY UP TO THE CITY COUNCIL.\n\nWHEN YOU'RE REVIEWING COUNCIL POLICY 17, THAT'LL BE PART OF WHAT WE CAN REVIEW ON THERE.\n\nNOT JUST THE TIME SINCE.\n\n>> I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO THINK THAT WE'RE SHORT-CHANGING THEM JUST OUT OF, HOW WE FEEL.\n\nI'D LIKE TO HAVE AN END WHERE WE COULD USE THAT NOW WE'RE NOT DOING THERE.\n\nTHIS IS WHEN WE END.\n\n>> I AGREE. I KNOW THAT COUNCIL RUSSELL WAS SAYING, WELL, WE COULD HAVE 4A OR 4B ON THE FIRST MEETING OF THE MONTH IF WE NEED IT TO.\n\nTHIS IS WHY I WOULD SAY TO CAUTION AGAINST DOING THAT.\n\nWHEN I LOOKED AT THIS, I ALSO TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THAT WE WANT TO USE OUR COUNCIL COMMITTEES AND WE WANT THEM TO MEET QUARTERLY.\n\nWHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEN MEETING QUARTERLY, NOW YOU'RE ADDING MORE TIME IN FOR US AS STAFF AND FOR Y'ALL TO BE HERE.\n\nWE WANT TO MAKE IT AS STRUCTURED AND AS TIMELINE AS POSSIBLE.\n\nWE WANT TO EFFECTIVELY USE YOUR TIME.\n\nWE DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE ANY TO COME IN OR WILL THIS MONTH YOU ARE GOING TO COME IN EARLY THIS TIME.\n\nTHEN THIS OTHER TIME TOO.\n\nTHEN ON WEDNESDAY YOU HAVE A PUBLIC SAFETY AND MUNICIPAL COURT MEETING.\n\nTHEN THE FOLLOWING TWO WEEKS FROM THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A COMMUNITY SERVICES MEETING.\n\nTHAT'S WHY I WANT YOU GUYS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS ALL TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, ALL OF THOSE.\n\nTHEN IT IS ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE BUDGET TAX RATE, SO THOSE ARE ALL LISTED THERE AND YOU'LL SEE WHERE THEY HAVE SPECIAL MEETINGS.\n\nTHEN I DID SAY THESE DATES ARE WHAT WE STRIVE TO ACCOMPLISH.\n\nHOWEVER, THEY COULD CHANGE IN ADDITIONAL MEETINGS NEEDED.\n\nI JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.\n\nWHEN I DID THE 2024 CALENDAR, I'M TAKING ALL THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW THE CALENDAR.\n\nI GOT IT. IF YOU LOOK, THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT JANUARY WOULD LOOK LIKE.\n\nREPLACE 930 WITH 530.\n\nNOW WE WOULD DO THAT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT, I ALSO INCORPORATED CITY HOLIDAYS AND THE POSTING DAYS ARE THE DAYS THAT STAFF HAS TO POST THESE AGENDAS IN ORDER TO GET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN THERE OF POSTING 72 HOURS AHEAD OF TIME, AND THEN ALSO TO GIVE YOU GUYS TIME TO REVIEW ALL OF THE MATERIAL THAT WE GIVE YOU.\n\nIF YOU'LL LOOK AT THAT JANUARY, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A COUNCIL MEETING, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO COMMITTEES THAT ARE GOING TO MEET AND I HAVEN'T DETERMINED WHICH ONES.\n\nI'M NOT SURE HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT.\n\nON THE TENTH AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK, HAVE A HOLIDAY, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO MEET ON THE 22ND AND THEN THE 24, TWO MORE COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO BE MEETING.\n\nIN-BETWEEN THERE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY STAFF IS PUTTING TOGETHER AN AGENDA AND POSTING AN AGENDA.\n\nTHAT MEANS GETTING ALL THE MEMOS TOGETHER, THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE.\n\nTHAT'S WHY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DEFINE 4A AND 4B ONCE A MONTH.\n\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE EVERY MONTH.\n\nBUT IT'S GOING TO BE THE SECOND MEETING OF THE MONTH.\n\n[01:40:02]\n\nAS ALWAYS, UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO TIME-SENSITIVE, BUT WE DON'T WANT THE ONE-OFF WHERE WE HAVE YOU COME IN AND MEET FOR 10 MINUTES OR FIVE-MINUTES.\n\nTHEN YOUR MEETING AGAIN TWO WEEKS AGAIN, IT'S ANOTHER FIVE OR 10 MINUTES.\n\nTHEN YOU'RE COMING IN 30 MINUTES BEFORE OR AN HOUR BEFORE.\n\nNOW, SOME OF THESE ARE GOING TO BE AN HOUR BEFORE THE ACTUAL MEETING STARTS.\n\nWE WANTED TO BE MINDFUL OF STAFF TIME AND OF COUNSEL TIME.\n\nI DON'T KNOW IF TOMMY HAS SOMETHING. [OVERLAPPING]\n\n>> [INAUDIBLE] FLEXIBILITIES THERE IF YOU HAD TO CALL IT THAN WE DID IT, BUT OTHERWISE THIS IS FINE.\n\n>> I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS JUST THERE IS GOING TO BE THE ONE-OFFS.\n\nJUST KNOWING THAT AND WE'LL TRY TO BE SPARING IN OUR USE OF IT, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON BUSINESS OR MISS OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF A TOO RIGID OF A SCHEDULE.\n\n>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS I DON'T WANT TO DELAY ANY DECISION-MAKING THAT'S IMPERATIVE TO SOMETHING COMING TO TOWN OR SOMEBODY THAT'S WAITING ON A RESPONSE FROM US, I WOULDN'T WANT TO HOLD UP BUSINESS.\n\nBUT HAVING A STANDARDIZED SCHEDULE IS IMPORTANT.\n\nI LOVE STRUCTURE.\n\nI THRIVE ON IT.\n\nI'M THRILLED TO SEE THIS CALENDAR JUST HAVING THE STABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE, KNOWING WHAT IS EXPECTED OF US AS WELL, OUR TIME COMMITMENTS HERE AND FOR THE FUTURE MEETINGS.\n\n>> IF YOU'LL NOTICE IN THE CALENDAR, I ALSO BUILT IN SOME CONFERENCES THAT WE TYPICALLY GO TO OR A MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL GOES TO SO THAT YOU CAN SEE WHERE THOSE ALL LAY IN ON THOSE.\n\nTHEN I PUT IN HERE.\n\nFOR A SPECIAL SESSION THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO HEAD AND SAY IS GOING TO BE APRIL 26TH.\n\nTHAT'S FOR THE BUDGET.\n\nBUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THERE'S EARLY VOTING GOING ON DURING THAT SAME TIME.\n\nAGAIN, THERE'S FOUR OTHER COMMITTEES THAT ARE GOING TO MEET THAT MONTH AND THEN ALL THE OTHER MEETINGS WE HAVE.\n\nI DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT TOMMY AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS, ABOUT BUILDING IN SOME SUMMERTIME, NOT TAKING A WHOLE MONTH, NOT SAYING WE'RE NOT READING IN THE MONTH OF JULY BECAUSE THAT'S HOW SOME COUNCILS DO IT AROUND THE STATE.\n\nWHAT WE SAID IS, THE 17TH WE'RE GOING TO MEET ON JUNE 17TH.\n\nTHEN THE NEXT MEETING WE WILL HAVE WILL BE JULY, 15TH.\n\nWE'VE GIVEN SOME TIME TO BUILD IN SOME WEEKS IN THERE THAT COUNCIL WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR YOUR TIME.\n\nWE'RE NOT DOING COMMITTEE MEETINGS, WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE.\n\nFOR STAFF, IT HELPS US OUT TOO FOR OUR VACATIONS AND TO KNOW WHEN TO DO THAT AND TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT.\n\nONE MEETING IN JULY IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.\n\nBUT THEN OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO COUNCIL COMMITTEES.\n\nTHEN YOU'LL MEET ON JULY 15TH, AND THEN WE'VE BUILT IN SOME MORE TIME, AND SO AUGUST 5TH WILL BE YOUR NEXT MEETING.\n\nWE'VE BUILT IN VARIOUS TIMES IN THE SUMMER TO TRY TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF, AND THEN NOT PUT US BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL BECAUSE ONCE WE GET INTO AUGUST, WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF OUR BUDGET AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING FOR THE BUDGET.\n\n>> IS IT GOING TO MESS UP YOUR PLAN TO MOVE THAT JULY MEETING UP A WEEK TO THE EIGHTH.\n\nDOES THAT STILL MEET THE GOALS YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE TO GIVE STAFF?\n\n>> WE'LL MAKE WHATEVER WORK THAT COUNCIL WANTS US TO MAKE WORK.\n\nTHIS JUST INLAID AT LEAST TWO SOLID WEEKS WHERE WE COULD TAKE OFF OR STAFF COULD TAKE OFF BECAUSE ONCE YOU MOVE IT UP TO THE EIGHTH, WELL, OTHER THING YOU'LL NOTICE THAT ON THE EIGHTH, THE WEEK BEFORE THE EIGHTH, WHICH IS WHEN WE WOULD HAVE TO BE POSTING ON THE 3RD OF JULY, WHEN FOURTH OF JULY IS THAT NEXT DAY.\n\nWE WERE TRYING TO GIVE A WEEK WHERE STAFF COULD AND ALSO COUNSEL.\n\nWE WEREN'T LOOKING AT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THERE.\n\nBECAUSE STAFF WILL BE HAVING TO PUT IN ALL OF THEIR AGENDA STUFF.\n\n>> WHAT ARE YOUR [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n>> THIRD THURSDAY OF EVERY MONTH.\n\n>> THURSDAYS?\n\n>> THURSDAYS.\n\n>> OKAY. [INAUDIBLE]\n\n>> NOW THE COUNCIL COMMITTEES WE HAVE NOT SET A TIME FOR COUNCIL COMMITTEES.\n\nWE CAN MEET AT ANYTIME WITH COUNCIL COMMITTEES.\n\nTHEY CAN BE IN THE MORNING, THEY CAN BE IN THE AFTERNOON OR THEY CAN BE IN THE EVENING.\n\nTHOSE ARE JUST DATES THAT WE'RE SETTING ASIDE TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOUR TIME AND WE HAVEN'T SET WHICH COUNCIL COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO MEET.\n\nWE'LL START A ROTATION AND THEN WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT THAT ROTATION IS.\n\nWE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET IS THIS SOMETHING YOU GUYS CAN DO.\n\nBEING MINDFUL ALSO, THE JOBS THEN COUNCIL COMMITTEES, LIKE I SAID, DO NOT HAVE TO MEET DURING THE DAY.\n\n[01:45:01]\n\nTHEY CAN MEET IN THE EVENING.\n\nTHE FINANCE COMMITTEE USED TO MEET AT 07:00 A.M.\n\nTHEY MET 7:00-8:00.\n\nREMEMBER WE'D HAVE BREAKFAST AND GET THERE.\n\nI WAS GRUMPY ALL THE TIME.\n\n[LAUGHTER] ON THE COUNCIL COMMITTEES, JUST REMEMBER THAT YOUR FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE GOING TO WORK WITH YOU AND STAFF IS GOING TO WORK WITH YOU SO THESE ARE DATES, NOT TIMES.\n\nTHE ONLY TIME THAT I'M ASKING YOU FOR IS THAT COUNCIL MEETINGS.\n\nJUST GO THROUGH THAT AND SO WE'VE GOT THOSE AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER SPECIAL MEETING THERE IN SEPTEMBER FOR THE BUDGET AND THEN WE'LL COME THROUGH HERE.\n\nTML IS THAT WEEK SO I'VE PUT ON THERE.\n\nTHAT'S ALSO HELPFUL FOR STAFF BECAUSE THERE'S NO POSTING ON THE 9TH, WHICH MEANS THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO DO A STAFF THERE EITHER.\n\nTHEN NOVEMBER, WE TYPICALLY HAVE ONE MEETING IN NOVEMBER, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO MEETINGS IN NOVEMBER BECAUSE WE NORMALLY SCHEDULE ONE AND WE ALWAYS WIND UP HAVING TWO AND TWO IN DECEMBER.\n\nI'M HOPING THAT MAYBE WITH PREEMPTING THAT AND DOING TWO SCHEDULED IN NOVEMBER, THEN MAYBE WE WON'T HAVE TO HAVE TWO IN DECEMBER AND JUST KEEP THE ONE IN DECEMBER AND THEN THE CITY HOLIDAYS IN THERE.\n\nAGAIN, THIS IS JUST BEFORE YOU ON DISCUSSION.\n\nIF THIS IS THE GENERAL DIRECTION, I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH OPTION 3.\n\nI THINK I HEAR 5:30 IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO.\n\nIN OPTION 3 AND REPORTS AT THE END AND EXECUTIVE SESSION REMAINING AT THE END.\n\n>> I THINK YOU'VE PUT THE AGENDA PRETTY EFFICIENTLY RIGHT NOW.\n\nI MEAN, I THINK WE CAN STILL GET OUT OF HERE BY REASONABLE TIME, NOT TRYING TO JINX IT, BUT WE'LL DO REMOVE A LOT OF STUFF CAN TO CONSENT THAT I THINK USED TO PROBABLY BOG IT DOWN.\n\n>> I'M GOOD WITH IT.
