        "text": "The 178-cm tall attacker was producing fine performances for the Scottish side from 2007 to 2013 when he moved to Derby County. The Rams booked their place in the Championship on several occassions, but they eventually failed to secure promotion to the Premier League. As a result, Johnny Russell decided to move to MLS, signing a three-year deal with Sporting Kansas city on January 31, 2018.\n\nThe Scotland international made his debut for the Wizards in the opening match of the 2019 season against New York City. Speaking of his debut for the national team, he played his first game for Scotland in November 2014 in a 3-1 loss to England. His main position is left winger, but he is capable of playing as both centre-forward and right winger as well.\n\nIn 2016 they made it to the final of the tournament as well, but Toronto FC eventually won the trophy. The Whitecaps are owned by Greg Kerfoot, Steve Luczo, Jeff Mallett and Steve Steve Nash, the former NBA star, and they play their home matches at BC Place. Speaking of MLS games, the capacity of the venue is 22.120 and you should know that the stadium was opened back in 1983. The Caps wear white shirts and white shorts when playing at home, while the colour of their away kit is blue."
