Larsson has a daughter born between 2016 and 2017,[4][5][6] and three cats, named Magnolia, Isacco and Gemina.[7][8][9][10]\n\nThe public Linköping University is the educational institution in which she has participated since 2008, earning a master's degree in Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering in 2013. Before joining Mojang Studios, Larsson was employed by two companies: Configura, in Linköping, Sweden, for six months (from January to June 2013); and Scania Group, in Södertälje, Sweden, for two months (from June to July 2012).\n\nAs an employee who was introduced as a gameplay developer for Minecraft: Java Edition in August 3, 2016,[11] Larsson led designs of new additions to Minecraft, such as icebergs, turtles and llamas.

Nir Vaknin, a Minecraft gameplay developer,[15] trivially told during Minecraft Live 2020 that Agnes likes to make the roofs of her houses with wool.

Agnes' Minecraft character also appears in the screenshot of Mojang's blog post about the Java Edition 16w43a snapshot, where it is pictured fishing in a river biome.\n\nIn April 2022, Larsson did a TED Talk in Vancouver, Canada, under the topic \"The Awesome Potential of Many Metaverses\".[5] In the talk, Larsson demonstrated how Minecraft worlds act as unique metaverses where players can express their creativity. She also shared screenshots from her Minecraft world on which she had played for more than 10 years.\n\nUpdate 1.21 - \"tricky trails\" for Java edition was released on June 13, 2024, just in time for Agnes' birthday\n\nGallery[]\n\nLarssons' cat, Magnolia.[16]\n\nLarssons' second cat, Isacco.[8]\n\nLarssons' 3rd cat, Gemina.[10]\n\nLarssons' official Mojang avatar from 2016 to 2021.\n\nLarssons' official Mojang avatar from 2021 to present.\n\nLadyAgnes' skin in Minecraft.\n\nHer profile picture on Twitter, featuring her cat named Magnolia.\n\nHer photo in 2021."
