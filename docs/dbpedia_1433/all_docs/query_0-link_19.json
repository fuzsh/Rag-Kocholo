V J cash box editorial A Way Of Life The major developments in discounting this past week raised some very very interesting questions, most important of which is the future of the practice itself. King Karol has dropped its everyday selling price for a $6.98 list LP from $5.99 to $4.49. Wallichs Music City, in response to heavy market competition, announced a major move toward discounting and remodeling all seven of its stores. The Strawberries chain in Boston precipitated yet another price reduction when it reduced its price for a $6.98 list to a current all-time low of $3.49. ‘How low can the price go?’ has been asked time and again both by eager customers awaiting the ultimate bargain and by manufacturers who will ultimately be hit hardest by discounting. The past four or five years have seen retail accounts becoming increasingly concerned with the depth of their stock, but the accelerated dash into discounting may very well prove to be the downfall of catalog and specialty albums. After all, the theory of discounting is to generate huge volume at a small markup, rather than hold on to stock and attempt to turn it over for a greater profit. If the discounting trend continues, the law of diminishing returns is bound to take its toll on jazz, comedy and other specialty product as well. Transshipping, the equivalent of cutthroat retail competition, has led to ridiculously low markups on the independent level, forcing some distributors out of business. What the manufacturers must consider is that they ultimately will absorb the costs for the privilege of generating the image of an active, hi-profile and stimulating excitement. If he is not careful, the manufacturer may very well find himself in the unenviable position of having to pay for the house. Though discounting may create as many problems as it solves, it is, at least for now, a way of life for the retailer.

Check The Oil, Dollar Gas. As procreators of what was later to be termed \"Southern Music,'' The Allman Brothers Band achieved legendary status through years of hard road work in the gladiatorial arena of today's concert halls where they always gave the fans their money's worth. Wipe The Windows, Check The Oil, Dollar Gas is a 2-Ip collection of previously unreleased live recordings that continues the group's tradition of delivering the rock and roll goods. Recorded over a three- year period, the album features historic performances from New Year's Eve, 1972, at the Warehouse in New Orleans, the mammoth Summer Jam concert at Watkins Glen, New York, in 1973, Winterland in San Francisco 1973, and the band's four-month tour of 1975. \"Caught on that one special night in twenty, The Allman Brothers Band could always go beyond simple brilliance, and create the rarest of magical moments on stage. The fact that some of those moments were caught on tape is as reassuring as it is exciting. There could be no better document to one of the greatest bands ever.\" Cameron Crowe— Rolling Stone \"A moment in musical history. . .electrifying! ! The classic live cut \"Jessica\" should be mandatory night programming on any rock radio stations!' — Kal Rudman \"The Allman Brothers Band displays a kind of musical prowess that is so far ahead of most rock bands that you’d think the other groups would want to unplug their amplifiers in shame!’ Robert Hilburn— Los Angeles Times' Wipe The Windows, Check The Oil, Dollar Gas. is from The Allman Brothers Band on Capricorn Records and Tapes, Macon, Ga.

Among them, J.C. Penney Co. added two million more feet this year, Kresge nearly doubled its rate of expansion, and G.C. Murphy tripled its rate of new footage. The bulk of this expansion came from the recycling of closed stores, mainly W.T. Grant buildings. Consequently, next year's growth pace is expected to return to 1975 levels. Not every chain, however, participated in the expansion boom. Charted below are 18 chains, divided by Inside Retailing into three groups according to their expansion rates: aggressors, conservatives and curtailers.

David Sutton of Sutton Distributing Co., which owns Jimmy’s Music World, was un- available for comment about the impact of his chain’s continuing expansion on the local retailing scene. However, Jimmy’s by Ken Terry print ads this week make it abundantly clear that the company has no intention of relaxing its pressure on the competition. The chain advertised 12 albums, including several top-selling LPs for $2.99 in the November 14 edition of the Sunday New York Times, and ten other LPs including the latest albums by Phoebe Snow, George Benson, ELO, the Bee Gees and Marvin Gaye, were promoted by Jimmy’s for $2.99 each in the New York Daily News that same day. Karol Capitulates Among New York’s major record retailers, King Karol was the last to hold its store prices at the levels which prevailed Wallichs Quits Traditional Pricing; Goes To Discount by Robert Rohwer LOS ANGELES — In an attempt to reverse this year’s 1 1 .6%/$325,000 decline in record sales, Wallichs Music City's seven Southern California stores will enter the discounting fray for the first time ever. During a time of growth for other com- peting southland retailers, Wallichs has seen its record sales drop from $2,834 to $2,506 million. ‘Absolute Necessity’ “Discounting is an absolute necessity if we want to keep up with our competition,” explained company president Clyde Wallichs. With record sales accounting for 42.4% of Wallichs’ total income, the decrease in sales can be attributed to the domination of the market by Wallichs’ price-conscious competitors: Tower, Lic- corice Pizza, Wherehouse and Music Plus Records. continued on pg. 30 Radio Shack To Discontinue Sale Of Quadraphonic Equip. NEW YORK — Quadraphonic equipment has been dropped from Radio Shack’s 1977 catalog because “it simply didn’t sell,\" according to Bernard Appel, vice president of merchandising for Radio Shack. Appel declined to specify how much money Radio Shack has lost on quad, but admitted that “we didn’t make any money, let’s put it that way. It was not a profitable business.” Three Factors Cited In a telephone interview, Appel indicated that he believed three factors were respon- sible for quad’s failure in the marketplace: “The lack of adquate software; a strong desire by the consumer not to put four speakers in a room; and a sound that the listener was not used to hearing in the con- cert hall.” Radio Shack has no plans to restock quad unless the market demands it, ac- cording to Appel. “And even then we won’t be the first,\" he maintained. “Radio Shack stores are currently just selling out demos.” ‘Unrealistic’ Radio Shack, a division of theTandy Cor- poration, and the largest retailer of con- sumer electronics equipment with 3,720 domestic and 900 foreign stores, believed quad was “unrealistic,” Appel stated. “Quad is a totally dead issue,” he em- phasized. “It’s not a viable line of business; it’s a line of crap.” 2-LP Sets Competitively Priced Despite Their Varying List Prices NEW YORK — In five newspaper editions dated Sunday, November 14 and in the Cleveland Plain Dealer’s November 12 issue, one or more of four current double albums with varying list price tags were ad- vertised at competitive prices. At The Record & Tape Collector in Baltimore, Stevie Wonder’s “Songs In The Key Of Life” ($13.98 list) was promoted for $7.88/$10.49 tape, and Led Zeppelin's new release ($11.98 list) for $6.97/$10.49 tape. In Cleveland, Uncle Bill’s offered the Won- der release for $7.95/$9.95 tape and Led Zeppelin's album was promoted for $8.28, at Gold Circle in Cleveland and for $6.99 at J.P. Snodgrass. In addition to these two albums, Kor- vettes advertised Elton John’s “Blue Moves” and the soundtrack to “All This And World War II” (both $12.98 list) for $7.99 each in New York (see accompanying story). Sam Goody in Philadelphia promoted the Wonder and Elton John albums for $7.99; Wall-to-Wall Sound in Philadelphia advertised “Blue Moves” for $7.18/$9.29 tape; and Sears in San Fran- cisco advertised it for $8.99. In order to provide a more complete pic- ture of the retail price relationships among these four albums, CB surveyed major retailers around the country to ascertain their current selling prices. The accom- panying table lists the results. before the current price war began. In- terestingly, its new regular store prices of $4.49 for $6.98 list records undercuts the corresponding figures at both Sam Goody ($5.49) and Korvettes ($4.99) in New York City. It is not nearly as low, however, as the regular store prices at Jimmy’s ($3.99) and Disc-O-Mat ($3.69). It would seem that in changing its pricing structure King Karol is responding to the ferocious competition in New York City, where all of its stores are located. In a re- cent interview with Cash Box (Nov. 13), though, Ben Karol, the chain's owner, declared, “We try very hard never to allow ourselves to be influenced by what other retailers think or do.” During the same in- terview he remarked that “we don’t even compete (with other retailers)” because King Karol carries such an extensive selec- tion of records. This week, asked for the reasoning behind his policy change, Karol stated, “We want to increase our volume. Right now we have embarked on a program where we want to triple our volume. And we’re going to try to do that using every method possi- ble. One of the methods is to lower the prices. Another method is more extensive continued on pg. 28 A&M Begins Holiday Promo LOS ANGELES — A&M Records is en- tering the holiday season by offering customers at the retail level nationwide a chance to win either a free record or tape, or 50 cents off on any A&M product, simply by picking the right album on one of 18 million “Christmas cards.” This “holiday giveaway” will run through the month of December. Each customer when he enters the store will be given a four-color “Christmas card” featuring sixteen A&M albums. Beneath each album will be a sweepstakes-like scratch-off stripe of ink, each conceal- ing a message. Customers will be allowed to scratch off only one spot. If the message reveals the words “50 cents off,” that specific album or tape may be purchased for 50 cents off the regular purchasing price. If the message reveals the words “free album,” that specific album or tape is to be given free as a holiday gift from A&M. Each card contains four chances for a win of the discount and one card in 50 contains the chance for the free album. 4-LP Price Comparison Employees At ABC In Seattle Return To Work Alter Strike by Julian Shapiro Stevie Wonder $7.98 $9.79 $7.49 $8.87 NEW YORK — Warehouse employees at the ABC Record and Tape Sales Corp. in Seattle returned to work on November 15 after a two-week strike. The walkout, trig- gered by the expiration of a contract be- tween ABC and Local 17 of the Teamsters, representing the workers, ended with the ratification of an oral agreement between the two parties by the union membership. A spokesman forthe union indicated that the strike was called because an impasse had been reached in the negotiations which had commenced in September. Provisions of the new contract which will run for 39 months include an increase in contract wage and benefit plans as well as a modification of existing job classifications, according to the union spokesman. “But the cause of the strike was the need for an economic package,\" he reiterated. “It was simply a contract dispute,” commented a spokesman for ABC Inc. in New York, which owns the independent distributorship in continued on pg. 30 Atlanta: Peaches Baltimore: Record Masters Boston: Harvard Coop Chicago: Musicland Cleveland: Record Theatre $8.99 Dallas: Sound Warehouse $7.95 Houston: Foley’s $9.99 Los Angeles: Music Plus $7.99 Miami: Specs $9.99 New Orleans: Mushroom $7.99 New York: Sam Goody $8.49 Philadelphia: Sam Goody $6.99 San Francisco: Tower $7.88 Odyssey $7.69 Seattle: Music Street $8.79 Washington, D C.: Waxie Maxie $9.98 Harmony Hut $8.88 1 Zeppelin Elton John “All This &WW II $6.98 $7.55 — $7.98 $7.98 $9.98 $6.49 $7.49 $7.98 $8.67 $9.67 — $7.99 $8.99 $9.99 $6.95 $7.45 $7.45 $9.99 $9.99 — . $7.99 $6.89 $8.99 $7.99 $8.99 $9.98 $6.99 $6.99 $8.89 $9.98 $7.49 $10.98 $6.99 $7.99 $10.98 $7.88 $7.88 $7.88 $6.59 $7.69 $7.14 $7.98 $9.98 $7.79 $9.98 $10.98 $ 9.98 $8.98 $11.98 $11.98 Cash Box/November 27, 1 976 7 WHEN iOU MAKE IT AS A BAND IN MEMPHIS, YOU’RE READY TO MAKE A DEBUT ALBUM. It's happened before in Memphis. The small club circuit would explode with sound. From Elvis to Rufus Thomas to B. B. King. The raw, genuine sound that rises from those Memphis streets, if harnessed, could conquer the world. It's happening again. A group of five extremely impressive rock & roll dynamos called Target make their move from playing the small clubs to opening for big name acts at the last minute. And when it's all over they get a better reception than the headliners. It's only right. Target is the real thing.

There was a point a few years ago when they had several top hits and gold records such as “Sylvia’s Mother” and “Cover Of The Rolling Stone,” but one day they woke up and found they were bankrupt. Instead of worrying about it, they switched labels to Capitol and released an album called, what else, “Bankrupt.” The single “Only Sixteen,” a remake of the old Sam Cooke tune, took off to certified gold and they were on their way again. Their second Capitol album, “A Little Bit More,\" solidified their second rise of pop- ularity. The album, which is still on Cash Box’s chart, not only contained “Only Six- teen,” but also the smash title track which went to #9 on the CB singles chart and remains listed after nearly six months as it nears gold. In addition, Dr. Hook has re- cently stormed the country community by moving to and recording in Nashville, hav- ing a hit country single with \"A Couple More Years” (also on the “A Little Bit More” LP) and even making an appearance on the Grand Ole Opry. Yet another single from the same album, “If Not You,” was released Nov. 15. Ray Sawyer, one of Dr. Hook’s founding members and well-known as one of their lead singers (the one with the eye-patch), has also taken on a solo venture. His first single, “(One More Year Of) Daddy’s Little Girl,” was released Oct. 11 and is on Cash Box’s singles chart. While still irreverent and humorous on- stage, Dr. Hook’s latest album and singles reflect an expanding of musical horizons to include ballads and softer love songs which have been whole heartedly embraced by old and new fans as well as AM, FM, progressive, MOR and country radio sta- tions alike. It’s only been four years since their first album was released, but it’s been a long crazy ride for Ray Sawyer, Dennis Locorriere, Jance Garfat, Rik Elswit, Bill Frances and John Wolters, whose futures look brighter than ever.

Korvettes, Marboro Stores Sued For Illegal Sale Of Posters Frampton Asks $2 Mil. Damages NEW YORK — Two separate million-dollar lawsuits have been commenced by Peter Frampton, naming Korvettes, Inc. and Mar- boro Bookshops Corp. as defendants. The complaints, filed in state supreme court here by Frampton’s attorneys Beldock, Levine and Hoffman, charge the two retail- ing operations with separate willful viola- tions of the civil rights law of the state of New York through sale of Frampton posters manufactured without official consent of the artist or his management. Unauthorized Posters by Phil DiMauro WCI Accepts 2.6 Million Shares In Solicitation Of Its Common Stock NEW YORK — Warner Communications Inc. (WCI) has received the equivalent of 3,- 279,482 shares of its common stock, pur- suant to a solicitation announced last month. Of that total, WCI indicated that it will accept the equivalent of 2,623,586 shares or 80% of the stock tendered on a pro rata basis, treating each share of series D convertible preferred stock as two shares of common stock. At the exchange rate of $27.25 per com- mon share, WCI will issue approximately $71.5 million worth of subordinated sinking fund debentures at face amount at a 9'/s% annual interest rate due in 1996. Cash will be paid for any fraction of a debenture less than $100, based on recent market prices for WCI’s common shares. The shares not accepted will be returned. Schwartz Bros. Sales, Income Up 3rd Qtr. WASHINGTON, D.C. — Schwartz Brothers, Inc., reported income of $28,563 on sales of $5,688,209 for the third quarter ended Sep- tember 30. This compares to a loss of $16,- 812 on sales of $5,012,873 for last year’s third quarter. Schwartz’s income for the nine month period ended September 30 was $59,711 on sales of $1 6,224,738. This contrasts with a loss of $103,138 on sales of $14,595,849 for the same period in 1975. Schwartz also announced the opening of a new Harmony Hut in the East Point Mall in Baltimore, Schwartz’s second retail store in the Baltimore area. This brings the total number of Harmony Hut stores to 15, with other stores in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. Kresge Sales, Income Up TROY, MICH. — The S.S. Kresge Company reported a 36.4% increase in third quarter profits, from $75,933,000 in 1975 to $1 03,- 581.000 in 1976. Earnings for the nine month period were similarly up, from $191,753,000 to $296,735,000. Sales for the company in the quarter rose 24.2%, from $1 ,634,000,000 in 1975, to $2,- 029.349.000 in 1976, while income from retail operations increased 38.8%, from $39,593,000 in the third period of 1975 to $54,952,000 this year. Nine month sales rose to $5,699,152,000 compared with $4,638,989,000 last year. Net income soared to $55,492,000 for the third quarter, up from $39,679,000 last year, for a 39.9% improvement. Net income for the nine month period was $156,430,- 000, a 56% increase over the $100,274,000 reported for the first three quarters of 1975. Foghat Outlaws Gold NEW YORK — Foghat’s “Rock And Roll Outlaws” album has been certified gold by the RIAA. According to a corporate spokesman, the more than 2.6 million shares accepted fulfills the goal WCI set when the solicitation was announced (Cash Box, Oct.23). “We felt that it wasn’t advisable for a number of reasons to take 100% (of the shares of- fered). It would have created another $12 million in debt and reduced equity that much. We wanted to keep the debt/equity ratio at a comfortable level.” Replying to reaction to the number of shares offered for sale, the spokesman ex- plained that most people were surprised at how low the total was. \"They expected that we would get more than that, given the premium over the market price of the stock when we announced the deal. WCI officials, however, were not greatly surprised at the final total tendered,” he continued. “We knew it would not be as high as the street thought.” Of the nearly 3.3 million shares received, only about 2-3 percent were preferred, based on the two-for-one equivalency, at the expiration of the exchange offer on November 13. Nearly one million series D shares were outstanding before the tender in addition to 13 million shares of common stock. Public Offering In another development, WCI announ- ced that it was proceeding with plans for a public offering of $100 million of senior notes due in 1986. The net proceeds of such offering would be applied to reduce intermediate-term bank debt. The complaints state that Korvettes and Marboro Bookshops have each “wrongfully exploited the plaintiff’s name and likeness” through the sale of unauthorized Peter Frampton posters. Each defendant is being sued for $500,000 actual damages and an additional $500,000 punitive damages. Problem Frampton’s lawyer Elliot Hoffman in- formed Cash Box that the problem exists in other retail chains as well as in smaller, in- dividual ‘headshops.’ He stated further, “Factually, the business has been operated on the theory that you can do anything you want until you get caught, and when you get caught, you probably don’t pay anything in back royalties or damages. Most people who’ve been involved in this have simply apologized, withdrawn the merchandise or appeared to withdraw the merchandise, and been let off the hook.” For this reason, he commented, lawsuits of this nature are a rarity. Ripped -Off Merchandise Hoffman, who represents many music in- dustry clients, stated that “it’s almost im- possible to walk into a headshop and not find ripped-off merchandise on the coun- ter.” The law firm is authorized by Bandana (coni, on page 30) Goody’s Earnings Continue Decline MASPETH — Sam Goody’s Inc. third quar- ter net loss for the period ended September 30 declined to $96,890 from $167,461 for the same period last year. However, Goody’s net loss for the nine month period ended September 30 climbed substantially to $483,212, from a net loss of only $3,088 for the identical nine month period in 1975. 3rd Qtr. Sales Sam Goody's third quarter sales for the period ending September 30 rose slightly to $10,617,841 from sales of $10,202,298 for 1975’s third quarter. For the nine month period ended September 30, sales in- creased to $31,512,024 from sales of $28,- 333,600 for the same period in 1975. Sam Goody, Inc. operates 27 retail stores in New York, New Jersey, Philadel- phia, Connecticut and North Carolina.

Cocktail Parties Produce Sales For Washington Area One-Stop NEW YORK — Cocktail parties for the small record store owners who comprise the bulk of its accounts have helped Potomac Music and Record Services Inc. stimulate sales and increase profits in the past several months. In fact, the parties have been so successful for the one-stop servicing metropolitan Washington, D.C., that it plans to increase both the number and size of the parties in the future. Soul Shack Expands With 2nd Retail Outlet NEW YORK — Soul Shack, a Washington, D.C. retailer, has opened a second store in suburban Prince George’s County, Mary- land. Owner George Gillespie described the new store as a “black oriented family store,” and said the move was made be- cause “we’re following our market to the suburbs.” Autographing Session A highlight of the November 13 opening was an in-store autographing session by The Whispers, underscoring the store’s commitment to establishing a black iden- tity. However, Gillespie said more rock se- lections had been added to the 2,000 square foot suburban store than are avail- able in the original, ten-year-old Soul Shack, located in downtown Washington. Island Sets Deal With Pacific Arts, Nesmith’s Label LOS ANGELES— A world-wide distribution deal has recently been completed between Island Records and Pacific Arts, Michael Nesmith’s independent label. The arrange- ment includes distribution rights to all Nesmith’s product as well as the entire Pacific Arts roster of artists. The first release in the new pact will be “Compila- tion,” an album containing tracks from Nesmith’s previous LPs. Early in 1977 Island will release Nesmith’s \"The Prison” and the Kaleidoscope LP, “When Scopes Collide.” Rainbow Pacts With UA LOS ANGELES — Roadshow Records and United Artists Records have recently reached agreement on a world-wide dis- tribution pact. The announcement was made by Artie Mogull, president of United Artists Records, and co-presidents of Roadshow Records Fred Frank and Sid Maurer. Relocate Frank and Maurer will continue to head up the label’s New York office while Nick Albarano, vice-president and general manager, will relocate to Los Angeles where Roadshow will headquarter its West Coast operation later this month. Premier acts on the label include Mark Radice and Enchantment Unique Strategy This unique strategy was first employed in September, when Potomac invited thirty to forty accounts to its office for a party featuring a performance by LTD. A case of champagne, wine, cheese, and snacks, paid for by A&M Records, were served to the record store owners, and in between sets, the dealers met the group and received posters, autographs, and other promotional material. Purchasing also took place during the party, resulting in sales of over 300 albums. Subsequent parties have featured Wild Cherry, McCoo and Davis, Michael Henderson, Walter Jackson and Melba Moore, hosted in conjunction with their respective record companies. After the Wild Cherry appearance, Potomac sold over 500 copies of the group’s album. The “purchase while partying” concept was conceived by Al Marks, Potomac buyer, and Chris Toby, salesman for Schwartz Brothers Distributors. Marks specified three main advantages of the cocktail parties. \"First, you establish a bet- ter relationship with your customers. Second, you make more money since you sell the product. Third, you keep the business in your own market, because the dealer thinks, ‘hey this guy’s been good to me.’” To date, Marks said, “the parties have been a tremendous sucess.” Screen Gems Opens New Promo Office NEW YORK — Screen Gems/Colgems-EMI Music Inc. has opened a midwest promo- tion office in Detroit, operative Nov. 22. The office will be manned by Mike Steele, for- mer music director of WDRQ in Detroit. NEW YORK — Aerosmith's latest single, “Walk This Way,” did not chart at all upon its original release in September 1975. However, in the issue dated November 20, 1976, the same record debuted on the Cash Box top 100 singles chart at #70 bullet, taking a 20-position leap to #50 with a bullet this week. Second Most Added These numbers are borne out by the Cash Box pop radio analysis, which lists the Aerosmith single as second most added record for the November 20 issue, with key adds at WRKO (Boston), WPGC (Wash- ington, D.C.), WCAO (Baltimore), Q102 (Cincinnati), WCOL (Columbus) and WSAI (Cincinnati). “Walk This Way” tops the most added records list for this week, appearing on the playlists of 18% of the stations reporting to Cash Box for adds on a total of one-third of the reporters. Station adds for the week include WMPS (Memphis), WLAC (Nashville), WIFI (Philadelphia), WZUU Chappell, RSO Pact Global Publishing Deal NEW YORK — Chappell Music and the Robert Stigwood Organization have en- tered into an agreement whereby Chappell will administer the music publishing catalogs of the Stigwood Organization worldwide.

(Milwaukee) and WBBF (Rochester). Station Comments Programmed by Jim Fox, Q102madethe unprecedented move of adding the record at #1 on its survey last week. Fox explains that as a cut from the album, “Toys In The Attic” began getting phone requests in the Cincinnati market about four months ago, at which point station disk jockeys also began playing the song at the city’s most frequented disco, where they appear on weekends. Fox then suggested the cut as an occasional night extra about one and one-half months ago, whereupon the song became the station’s biggest all-day phone request within the space of two weeks, even though it was not yet programmed on a regular basis. “The record is about to peak in this market,” exclaimed Fox. “Even though it hasn’t sold, the album (released April 7, 1975) has sold like crazy in town.” Other Reasons A random sampling of stations that have added the record around the nation reveals a slightly different explanation each time. At WMPS, where the record was added this week, music director Mike St. John ex- plained that “on the basis of outside research, Aerosmith seems to be one of the hottest acts in our area among teens and 20 to 23 year olds.” The decision was made on the basis of album market surveys, telephone and street interviews, and while St. John pointed out that “Walk This Way” was often requested as an album cut before single release, phone response has in- creased since it was added to the survey as a single. Oldie Research At WNOE in New Orleans, Kevin O’Brien, director of music and research systems, commented that the cut had been showing up in the station’s oldie research as long as a year ago, and that the station had played the cut with increasing frequency during the rating period, though itwas notcharted. On the basis of the station’s studies of group appeal, O’Brien stated that it did not matter to the consumer that the cut or single was not from the group’s current album. He compared the new single to Aerosmith’s “Dream On,” which he feels “will be with us forever” in terms of airplay. At Wichita’s KLEO, program director Ken Clifford attested to the success of Aerosmith albums in the market according to station research, but he attributed the decision to add the single to “gut feeling. This is a big boogie town.\" Sydney Coker, music director at Portland’s KGW, pointed to album sales and crowd response at Aerosmith concerts, while stating, simply, “I just hear it as being a hit.” Interestingly, many of the radio personnel surveyed were not even aware that “Walk This Way” had previously been released as a single, and it was a faint memory at best to those with any recollection How It Happened Columbia Records released the single at the suggestion of three CBS local promo- tion men, who brought their idea to thefloor during a national promotion meeting held at the recent CMA Convention in Nashville. They were Bob Peale, Houston; Fred Pillot, New Orleans; and Mark Westcott, Min- neapolis. CBS Records vice president of national promotion Stan Monteiro offered comment, “First of all, Aerosmith has built into a major act, especially in the last year or so. But, if you recall, programmers have been complaining of the recent glut of ballads, and looking for more rock 'n' roll records. We came up with a good, up-rock record at the right time, by a group that’s hot. But none of the geniuses in the building figured this out. They were three of our local promotion guys — and I love it!“ 10 Cash Box/November 27, 1 976 Superstars from down under Their new single from their debut MCA album \"Howzat Produced by Sherbet & Richard Lush FCC Radio Applications: Still In The Hole After Six-Month Freeze by Rebecca Moore WASHINGTON, D.C. — With a month and a half left to go on its closed season for AM and FM radio new and major change ap- plications, the FCC still has hundreds of ap- plications to process. When — or if, as broadcasters fear — the commission again accepts applications af- ter December 31 , it will still be in the hole. It will have reduced the number of applica- tions from its June high: 734 FM and 551 AM. But there will still be more applications pending than there were in May of this year: 475 FM and 302 AM. Closed Season The purpose of the closed season — which started June 30 — was to allow the FCC’s Aural New and Changed Facilities Branch to catch up on its paperwork. A relaxation in technical standards last year resulted in six times the number of AM-FM Davey’s Locker Opens In Dallas LOS ANGELES — Davey’s Locker, a four- store chain owned by Sieberts of Little Rock, Ark., recently celebrated the Nov. 5 grand opening of a new 3,200 square foot store, its first in Dallas, Texas. During its first week, the store offered special sale prices of $3.77 and $3.99 on selected $6.98 list LPs, in addition to various grand opening festivities. Along with the sale, an autograph party was held with Epic recording artist Michael Murphey, and Dallas Cowboys Mark Washington, Robert Newhouse, and Cliff Harris visited the premises. Also featured during the 38- hour grand opening celebration were record package giveaways and a drawing for an RCA compact stereo system. The store will also be conducting a month-long “Guess The Mystery Artist” contest, in which contest winners will receive an album a month for life, and runners-up will win a album a week for one year. The Davey’s Locker chain presently in- cludes two stores in Little Rock and one Kansas City outlet, in addition to the new Dallas store. On Feb. 1, 1977, a fifth store will be opened in San Antonio. Sieberts, a division of the Handleman Co., also operates the Mad Cats chain, which has 15 outlets in Arkansas, Kansas and Okla- homa. applications. The commission gave 60 days notice this spring that it would have a six-month closed season in order to process the extra applications. The commission, including chairman Wiley and broadcast facilities division chief Martin Levy, swore up and down the closed season would end the first of the year. Broadcasters were not reassured. Many felt that once the FCC turned off the ap- plications tap, it would stay off. The resulting deluge of applications — 309 FM and 256 AM in June alone — sur- prised the FCC. “We didn’t expect the June bump,\" said one staffer involved. “It was unprecedented.” Previously the FCC averaged 36 FM and 25 AM applications a month. June AM filings outnumbered all 1975 receipts: 200. Staff estimated that 40% of the June applications were technically deficient. The commission adopted rules allowing immediate return of detective ap- plications. This weeded out a few. Stall Problems Two engineers from FM were going to work on AM applications. The June flood delayed that plan. Eventually FM did loan one engineer. But one was not enough. Six additional engineers were hired in August. Training and inexperience slowed the application disposal process. The full impact of the new staff probably won’t be felt until mid-1977, according to FCC estimates. Each application requires a detailed engineering investigation. Case-by-case examination of each station can take days, or weeks, to complete. An 80% turnover in attorneys in the Aural Facilities Branch last year didn’t help mat- ters either. “It’s a crisis situation,” lamented one FCCer. Disposals Up Despite the crisis, disposals are increas- ing. The rate has doubled. Disposals for both AM and FM average 71 a month since the June 30 deadline. That’s up from 33 a month previously. It’s still not good enough, however. While one backlog was eliminated, another was started. In January the commission will bea little worse off than it was in May, despite six months of intensive processing. But that’s not as bad as it was. At least according to the commission.

Marks — BMI) (Vanda, Young) Bay City Rollers strike back with a hot rock number from their recent “Dedication” LP. The tune features vocals in a harder rock vein than usual. Actual audience screams come in towards the end. A wise follow-up to “I Only Wanna Be With You.” Will soon be moving up the top 40. NEIL DIAMOND (Columbia 10452) Beautiful Noise (3:14) (Stonebridge Music — ASCAP) (Diamond) Diamond delivers the title cut from his recent LP “Beautiful Noise.” Orchestration begins the tune as Dia- mond steps in withhis well-known vocal style includes a revolving crousel organ, produced by The Band leader Robbie Robertson, with strings and horns arranged by Nick De Caro. Should do well on MOR and AM playlists. BOB DYLAN (Columbia 10454) Stuck Inside Of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again (3:35) (Dwarf Music — ASCAP) (Dylan) Edited down from six minutes on the recent “Hard Rain” LP, this is one of the stronger cuts. Live voltage guitars rip across the vinyl. Dylan puts out a powerful and convincing rock vocal. The B side, “Rita May,” is previously unreleased. Receives plenty of FM airplay. Watch for AM adds. SILVER CONVENTION (Midland International 10849) Dancing In The Aisles (Take Me Higher) (3:18) (Midsong Music — ASCAP) (Levay, Kunze) Extracted from the recent “Madhouse” LP, the Con- vention sways back and forth with a disco tune which sings about dancing in the aisles of a 747.

LOGGINS & MESSINA (Columbia 10444) Angry Eyes (2:24) (Jasperilla Music/American Broad- casting Music — ASCAP) (Loggins, Messina) The recent LP release “Best Of Friends” contains the latest and possibly the last single from the duo Loggins & Messina.

ELVIN BISHOP (Capricorn 0266) Spend Some Time (3:18) (Crabshaw Music — ASCAP) (Bishop) A gospel-styled piano plays opening notes as Bishop croons the lyrics. Taken from the current “Hometown Boy Makes Good\" LP, already on many playlists, it became the logical single release. A funky guitar cuts up the bridge. Should do extremely well on top 40. K.C. & THE SUNSHINE BAND (T.K. 1020) I Like To Do It (2:57) (Sherlyn/Harrick Music — BMI) (Casey, Finch) Following right on the heels of the hit “Shake Your Booty,” K.C. returns with another slice from their recent “Part 3” LP. This one has a slight latin flavor emphasized by some spicy horns. The Sunshine Band keeps pouring out familiar disco harmonies. Will sur- ely race up the charts in no time — for R&B and AM playlists. LINDA RONSTADT (Asylum 361) Someone To Lay Down Beside Me (3:58) (Sky Harbor Music — • BMI) (Bonoff) Her recent “Hasten Down The Wind” LP contains this followup to the hit “That'll Be The Day.” Silvertoned piano and horns start out this strong melodic ballad. Ronstadt’s vocal strikes deeply and leaves no doubtthatthiswill be another hit record. Strings play calmly in the background. Already hot on FM playlists; expect the same for AM. RINGO STARR (Atlantic 3371) Hey Baby (3:10) (Unart Music/Le Belle Music — BMI) (Cobb, Channel) Starr comes back with another go-getter from his recent “Rotogravure” LP. It’s a siz- zling remake of Bruce Channel’s old hit. Starr turns out some of his own vibrant power and style. The chorus sings backup throughout the song. Already has heavy FM play — should burst upon the AM stations instantly. GEORGE HARRISON (Dark Horse/W.B. 8294) This Song (3:45) (Ganga B.V. — BM!) (Harrison) Harrison debuts his first single on his own Dark Horse label. From the forthcoming LP “33,\" a jazzy piano and organ take off on the lead.

From the forthcoming film “A Star Is Born,” the vocal is strong and right on cue. Background orchestration is perfectly produced. Expect this one to be a monster; should be on the charts for quite a lonq spell. HEART (Mushroom 7023) Dreamboat Annie (2:59) (Andorra Music — ASCAP) (A.&N. Wilson) After two big hits Heart returns with the title cut from their platinum LP “Dreamboat Annie.\" With ocean waves in the distance, Ann & Nancy Wilson turn out some surefire harmonies. The tune is soft and melodic; a banjo plays quickly on backup. Should receive a fast bullet on the charts. LADY FLASH (RSO 864) Never Gonna Let You Get Away (3:22) (Kamakazi Music — BMI) (Manilow) Written by Barry Manilow, this is a soothing soulful ballad by Lady Flash. The vocal current flows evenly.

DAVID BROMBERG BAND (Fantasy 785) Such A Night (3:10) (Walden Music/Oyster Music/Caul- dron Music — ASCAP) (Rebennack) Bromberg special delivers an extremely live single penned by the Night Tripper Dr. John. A bluesy number with hand clapping, a New Orleans sax, and a peppery energetic chorus. Bromberg’s vocal is as smooth as warm butter. This just might be the one to get Bromberg on the charts. AZTEC TWO-STEP (RCA 10850) So We Danced (3:01) (Mannequin Music/Harry’s Tune Music — ASCAP) (Fowler) Here’s a smooth rockin’ pop tune, pulled from the duo’s latest LP “Two’s Company.” Aztec’s harmonies are as timely as ever. The song tells about “driving a hundred miles just to dance.” Some “Penny Lane”-type trumpets come running in with some finely played piano chords. There will be definite adds from FM and AM playlists. SUZANNE STEVENS (Capitol 4366) Take Me Away (3:09) (ATV Music/Sasha Songs/Warner- Tamerlane/Upward Spiral Music — BMI) (Proffer, Pom- eranz) A good pop/rock number that sounds like a combina- tion Pet Clark/Melissa Manchester. The hook strikes a good connection within the title lyric. The arrangement, featuring guitar and percussion, is brilliant. Sounds likea natural for the top 40. LAW (MCA 40656) Be My Woman (Be My Friend) (2:53) (William Tell Mu- sic/Leagal Beagle Music — BMI) (Mclver) Killer rock guitars play across the opening notes. This new group turns out a convincing rock single. Dead-on- target horns play some well-phrased chords. The lead vocal is energetic. A good item for both FM and AM playlists. CHAIN REACTION (Ariola America 7651) Never Lose Never Win (4:10) (T.R. Music/Screen Gems- EMI Music — BMI) (Rivers) Derived from the recent “Solid” LP, backed by a full- sounding piano. Henderson starts off on a powerful and spirited vocal. This soulful ballad’s winning formula is found within an excellent arrangement which is com- plemented by direct and poignant harmonies. Watch for adds on both R&B and AM playlists. ELLIOT LURIE (Arista 9219) Rich Girl (3:15) (Chappell Music — ASCAP) (Hall, Oates) Written by Hall & Oates. Lurie used to be the lead singer with the group Looking Glass known for their hit “Brandy.” Lurie belts out a R&B-styled vocal. Rock production is distinct and right to the point. Smooth guitar riffs play an important role. For AM and FM playlists. SISTER SLEDGE (Cotillion 44208) Cream Of The Crop (3:35) (Oceans Blue Music/Friday’s Child Music/Mured Music — BMI) (Eli, Barry) It’s disco time once again. Sledge puts out a pure com- mercial sound, their vocals are distinct and upfront background singers fill in some fine R&B harmonies. Should be an instant candidate for both R&B and AM charts. JIMMY BRISCOE AND THE LITTLE BEAVERS (Pi Kappa 802) You’re My Love, My Life, My Soul (3:59) (Kama Sutra Music/Wanderek Music — BMI) (Kyser) A soul-inspired orchestration begins the opening notes for this easy-listening R&B ballad. Briscoe’s vocal is tender and convincing. Little Beavers help out with some effective harmonies. Adds will be forthcoming from R&B playlists. TANYA TUCKER (MCA 40650) Short Cut (3:17) (Leeds Music — ASCAP) (MacGregor, Kroeber) Tucker’s latest LP “Here’s Some Love\" contains her new single. The sound is pure pop/rock — there’s no country flavor at all. Tucker’s vocal tears out from the speakers. Overdubs add some extra power. A jazz flute comes in on the bridge. Expect this record to be dynamite on the charts. LARRY SANTOS (Casablanca 869) Long, Long Time (3:58) (MCA Music — ASCAP) (White) A pop/MOR ballad is carefully calculated by Santos, who places his strong vocal effectively. The orchestra- tion is rich and memorable with classical horns com- plemented by some lively guitar. Taken from the “You Are Everything I Need” LP. Primarily for AM and MOR playlists. GAVIN CHRISTOPHER (Island 077) Good Stuff (3:37) (Ackee Music/Mocrisp Music — ASCAP) (Christopher, England) Christopher wrote some of the big songs for Rufus, in- cluding “Once You Get Started.” A hot and funky guitar slaps out those opening notes. Christopher struts in with a strong and grinding vocal. Sexy backup vocals — “don’t wanna do nothin’ but dance.” It’s a hard driving R&B song which should quickly arrive on the chart scene. MOJOBA (Polydor 14359) Keep The Funk A-Flowin’ (3:56) (Warner Bros. Music/Hopewell Music — ASCAP/BMI) (Davis, John- son) This record spreads the funk on thick. A hard bass pounds continually. The group sprays out some hot and spicy vocals. R&B-styled horns blow away hitting the final grooves. Look for adds from both R&B and AM playlists. HAZEL DEAN (London 20090) Got You Where I Want You (2:40) (Hudson Bay Music — BMI) (Curtis) Nothing but spear-tipped disco riffs tear this tune wide open. Dean wails and moans away on a steamy vocal. The tune reaches climax its with an extra helping of po- tent harmonies. Should cause some excitement on R&B playlists and could cross over to top 40. PAUL MAURIAT AND HIS ORCHESTRA (Free Spirit 3001) Love Is Still Blue (3:03) (Croma Music — ASCAP) (Popp, Cour) Here’s the title cut from the recent “Love Is Still Blue” LP. The hit of the ’60s is recycled as an electronic disco tune. A synthesizer plays the recharged familiar riffs. Orchestration floats in and out with some bionic back- ground harmonies. Watch for electrifying adds from AM and MOR playlists. 20 Cashbox/November 27, 1976 1976 B Ml Awards Open To Student Composers NEW YORK — Awards totaling $15,000 will be available to young composers in the 25th annual BMI Awards to Student Com- posers competition sponsored by Broad- cast Music, Inc.

Some even sent cash, which was returned. Crossley Surveys, Inc., a 10-year-old research firm, has reported some answers for the new managmentof WNCN-FM, New York’s 24-hour classical music station. The listener uprising began when the station’s former owners switched from the classics to rock in 1 974, precipitating sale of WNCN by Starr Broadcasting Group to GAF Cor- poration. The survey was one of the first moves by GAF when it began operation of the station June 7, 1976. The intensity of response to GAF's questionnaire surprised Crossley vice president Leonard R. Learner. In mid- summer, with many listeners on vacation, 11 percent responded within 10 days of mailing. Two weeks later, 76 percent of the 3,689 persons contacted had answered. The survey was conducted among listeners who had previously expressed in- terest in the station during the dispute over programming. Who are these listeners? The Crossley survey reported that: • Nearly one out of five of the respon- dents owns a business or holds cor- porate rank between vice president and chairman of the board; • One of 21 earns more than $100,000 a year; one of eight makes between $10,000 and $100,000; • Two of five made speeches the past year before audiences of 21 or more; • About half belong to professional or scientific groups, and ten percent of continued on pg.48 EZ Radio Comm. To Use Compu/Net NEW YORK — Compu/Net Inc. has an- nounced that EZ Communications has selected Compu/Net to automate the business operations of all EZ stations. The decision follows months of investigation of the flexibility, reliability, and service of competing automated management systems by the EZ Communications staff. The first EZ facility to receive the Com- pu/Net system will be WEZR-FM located in Fairfax, Virginia, headquarters of EZ Communications. The other EZ stations will subsequently receive the system. Windchime Comm Formed By McKay LOS ANGELES — Tom McKay, air per- sonality and music director of KNX-FM, Los Angeles for over three years and developer of the station’s “mellow sound” format, has announced his is starting his own con- sulting and syndication company, Wind- chime Communications, Inc. McKay said the purpose of Windchime is to provide radio stations all over the coun- try with the type of quality programming which attracts the most desirable possible audience: high-income, high education, 20-40 year old adults. The station most recently retaining McKay’s services is KBBC-FM in Phoenix, Arizona. Combined Communications (owners of KBBC) is strongly behind McKay's concept, and according to McKay they’ve promised a great deal of supportive promotion. “I’m confident we’ll make a tremendous impact in Phoenix,” said McKay. Art Kellar, EZ Communications’ presi- dent, sees the move to Compu/Net automation as an opportunity to further the successes of the group he founded in 1967. He attributes the present successes of EZ’s four “beautiful music” stations to a sound sales philosophy and high calibre staff. In addition to the new automation capability, Kellar said that EZ plans to continue expan- sion throughout major U.S. radio markets. flELD FfTl ACTIDn LPs DOST ADDED LPs The Pretender — Jackson Browne — Asylum High Lonesome — Charlie Daniels Band — Epic White Bird — David LaFlamme — Amherst Wipe The Windows — Allman Bros. — Capricorn Rock & Roll Over — Kiss — Casablanca Help Is On The Way — Melissa Manchester — Arista Imaginary Voyage — Jean-Luc Ponty — Atlantic Heat Treatment — Graham Parker — Mercury Flowing Free Forever — Michael Murphey — Epic All This & World War II — Various Artists — 20th Century Certified Live — Dave Mason — Columbia New England — Wishbone Ash — Atlantic Zoot Allures — Frank Zappa — WB Hometown Boy Makes Good — Elvin Bishop — Capricorn In Concert — Jimmy Cliff — WB Attic Thoughts — Bo Hansson — Sire Photograph — Melanie — Atlantic Albedo-0.39 — Vangelis — RCA mOST REQUESTED CUTS Mission/A New World Record (entire LP) — ELO — UA The Pretender (title)/Only Child — Jackson Browne — Asylum Songs In The Key Of Life (entire LP) — Stevie Wonder — Tamla/Motown PAEDlCTiDnS The Pretender (entire LP)/The Fuse/Only Child — Jackson Browne — Asylum High Lonesome (entire LP)/Billy The Kid — Charlie Daniels Band — Epic Year Of The Cat (entire LP)/On The Border — Al Stewart — Janus Rock & Roll Over(entire LP)/Hard Luck Woman — Kiss — Casablanca V Simon BREAKS Dick Smith, former PD/MD at WORC, Worcester has left the station.
