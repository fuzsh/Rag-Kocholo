        "text": "Tommy Johansson (born 26 October 1987 in Boden) is a Swedish multi-instrumentalist, composer, singer. He was the lead guitarist of Sabaton from 2016. He also did backing vocals and occasional lead vocals for Sabaton. He departed Sabaton in 2024. He is a tenor.\n\nBiography[]\n\nTommy Johansson started playing guitar at the age of nine after his dad showed him Gary Moore's video \"Out in the Fields\". He realized that playing the guitar is the thing that he wants to do for the rest of his life.[1] He started singing at the age of 15 when he was introduced to the Skid Row song \"18 and Life\". His soft rock days were over when he heard bands like Helloween and Stratovarius. After a few years in music school, Tommy became a \"one-man musician\" who could sing, play guitar, piano, drums, bass and even flute.\n\nTommy's musical inspirations include among others Gary Moore, Angra, Stratovarius, Robby Valentine, Symphony X and Helloween.\n\nCareer[]\n\nTommy created his solo project ReinXeed in 2000. In 2006 he decided that film music mixed with melodic power metal would be very cool music to compose and record. He set up his own studio and started recording his own songs with a better quality, and posted them on his MySpace page. The band leader and drummer Daniel Eskilsson of the Swedish melodic power metal band Majestic Vanguard heard Johansson's songs and put him in touch with Christian Liljegren of Rivel Records. Jani Stefanovic of Divinefire and Essence of Sorrow co-produced and mixed the album and handled the drums. On his debut album \"The Light\" that was released in 2008, he played on all instruments. On his second album from 2009 \"Higher\", Johansson is backed by a full band as he recruited two guitarists (Kerry Lundberg and Mattias Johansson), a keyboardist (Henrik Fellermark), a drummer (Erik Forsgren) and bassist (Ace Thunder). His third album \"Majestic\" was released in 2010. In 2011 came out ReinXeed's fourth album \"1912\" which was a concept album about the sinking of the Titanic. In 2011 Tommy recorded album titled \"Swedish Hitz Goes Metal\" where he and his band covered various Swedish popular songs from Abba and other artists in power metal style. In 2012 Tommy released his fifth album \"Welcome to the Theater\". In 2013, sixth album titled \"A New World\" was released with a new line-up, also a second album with Swedish pop music cover songs, \"Swedish Hitz Goes Metal Vol.2\" was released.[2][3][4][5]\n\nShortly after that Tommy decided to take a break from music completely, and one year later him, Chris and Alexander decided started to write new songs.\n\nBefore joining Sabaton, Tommy was working in a studio in his hometown Boden in Sweden.[6]\n\nIn 2016, Tommy joined Sabaton replacing Thobbe Englund. His first show with the band was during Sabaton Open Air in 2016.\n\n“For me to be a part of the Sabaton family is a huge honor and I couldn’t be happier. The guys are awesome and among the nicest people you can meet.\n\n“I’ve been following Sabaton since 2005 when I saw them live for the first time and I have loved the band ever since, so when they asked me to join there was no hesitation. Although they did ask me already back in 2012 but for many personal reasons it was not a good time for me to hit the road and give everything that was needed to the band. So I declined, but we have stayed in touch since then.\n\n“I also wanna say that Thobbe is a great guitarist and such a wonderful guy. My job is not to replace him, it’s to contribute to the band with my own style of guitar playing but of course also to keep his fans happy by playing his wonderful solos with pride.\n\n“I look forward to meet you all on tour and to do what I love the most in life — to play heavy metal.”[7]\n\nIn 2017 Tommy joined a UK symphonic power metal band Memories of Old where he's the band's vocalist. The band released their debut album \"The Zeramin Game\" in 2020.\n\nIn 2018 Tommy's ReinXeed performed at the Sabaton Open Air festival in Sweden. This was the band's first show in 5 years and was also the last show as ReinXeed because they decided they needed a fresh start as a band included a new name. In 2019, the band was renamed to Majestica and signed a contract with Nuclear Blast Records.[8]\n\nMajestica's debut album \"Above The Sky\" was released in 2019, and a year later in 2020 came a second album, \"A Christmas Carol\".\n\nTommy is also a member of a Christian power metal band Golden Resurrection since 2008. He plays guitar, keyboards and sings backing vocals. He's featured on the band's three albums.\n\nOn 20th January 2024 it was announced that Tommy decided to quit Sabaton to pursue a solo career.\n\nMy dear friends!\n\nAfter 7 glorious years of Heavy Metal, I have decided to step down as the guitarist of Sabaton. This has been the hardest decision I’ve ever made in my entire life.\n\nAs many of you may know, I do a lot of things outside of Sabaton. I play with another band, perform with various artists, and have a career as a singer that I’ve put aside for years to focus on Sabaton. After doing this for seven years, I feel it’s time to start following my heart.\n\nThis means I will no longer tour with my brothers in Sabaton and will not meet all you lovely Sabaton supporters on the upcoming tours with the band.\n\nI will never quit playing music. I’ll still be touring with Majestica and other projects, but not on the same level as Sabaton of course. I am sure I will meet you lovely fans on the road again in the future.\n\nMy brothers in Sabaton and the best crew in the world will forever be my second family and I will miss spending time with all these wonderful people. We had so much fun together every day. I’ve come to learn so much about life, about music and about touring that I wouldn’t have learned anywhere else.\n\nA massive thank you to all you lovely Sabaton fans for accepting me as the new guitarist in 2016. I am certain you will accept the person who takes over after me.\n\nAll the best to you all and I’ll see you again soon!\n\nCheers,\n\n/Tommy\n\nDiscography[]\n\nWith Sabaton:\n\nBismarck (single) (2019)\n\nFields of Verdun (single) (2019)\n\nThe Red Baron (single) (2019)\n\nGreat War (single) (2019)\n\nThe Great War (2019)\n\nAngels Calling (single) (2020)\n\nThe Attack of the Dead Men (Live in Moscow) (single) (2020)\n\nLivgardet / The Royal Guard (single) (2021)\n\nDefence of Moscow (single) (2021)\n\nSteel Commanders (single) (2021)\n\nKingdom Come (single) (2021)\n\nChristmas Truce (single) (2021)\n\nThe Great Show (2021)\n\nThe War to End All Wars (2022)\n\nWith Reinxeed/Majestica:\n\nThe Light (2008)\n\nHigher (2009)\n\nMajestic (2010)\n\n1912 (2011)\n\nSwedish Hitz Goes Metal (2011)\n\nWelcome to the Theater (2012)\n\nA New World (2013)\n\nSwedish Hitz Goes Metal Vol.2 (2013)\n\nAbove the Sky (2019) (Majestica)\n\nA Christmas Carol (2020) (Majestica)\n\nAbove the Sky in Tokyo (live) (2021) (Majestica)\n\nMetal United (Single) (2021) (Majestica)\n\nGlory of Christmas (Single) (2021) (Majestica)\n\nWith Golden Resurrection:\n\nGlory to My King (2010)\n\nMan with a Mission (2011)\n\nOne Voice for the Kingdom (2013)\n\nWith Memories of Old:\n\nThe Land of Xia (single) (2019)\n\nZera's Shadow (single) (2019)\n\nSome Day Soon (single) (2020)\n\nThe Zeramin Game (2020)"
