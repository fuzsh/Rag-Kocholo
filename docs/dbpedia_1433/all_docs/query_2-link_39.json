        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) - Willy Agada scored twice in the first half, Memo Rodríguez had an early assist and scored the winner late, and Sporting Kansas City survived an own goal by keeper Tim Melia in a 3-2 victory over FC Dallas on Sunday night.\n\nAgada gave Sporting KC (5-13-5) the lead in the 11th minute when he used Rodríguez’s sixth assist of the season — off a corner kick — to score with a header from the center of the box.\n\nAgada found the net again in the 23rd minute, taking passes from rookie Alenis Vargas and defender Tim Leibold to score his seventh goal this season. Vargas’ assist was the first of his career in his fourth start and 14th appearance. Leibold’s helper was his third this season and the sixth in his two years in the league.\n\nDallas (6-11-5) pulled within 2-1 at halftime when the ball caromed off Melia’s foot during a scramble in front of the net in the 30th minute.\n\nDallas evened the score in the 65th minute when Petar Musa used an assist from fellow rookie Logan Farrington to score his 11th goal of the season. Musa has scored six goals in the last four matches, including his first career hat trick in a 5-3 victory over Minnesota United on June 19. The assist was the fourth for Farrington.\n\nRodríguez scored the winner unassisted in the 82nd minute. It was his second goal this season.\n\nMaarten Paes had three saves in goal for Dallas. Melia saved three shots for Sporting KC.\n\nSporting KC defender Zorhan Bassong left with a red card in the fourth minute of stoppage time after receiving two late yellow cards.\n\nDallas played without Jesus Ferreira and Alan Velasco because of injuries.\n\nDallas picked up it first win at home when trailing at halftime since March of last season in a 3-2 victory over the Portland Timbers last time out. The previous second-half rally at home came against Sporting KC.\n\nDallas falls to 3-3-0 under interim manager Peter Luccin. The club entered the match averaging 2.4 goals in five outings under Luccin after scoring 18 goals in its first 16 matches this season.\n\nThe two clubs will square off again on Wednesday at Children’s Mercy Park in the U.S. Open Cup quarterfinals before Dallas returns home to play the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday. Sporting KC travels to play the San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday."
