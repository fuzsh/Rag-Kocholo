Profession: Chemist and Inventor of Aspirin

Biography: Felix Hoffmann was a German chemist best known for synthesizing acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), better known as aspirin, and diamorphine, which was later called heroin. Hoffmann's work significantly influenced medicine and pharmaceuticals, although there is controversy regarding the attribution of the discovery of aspirin.

Hoffmann joined Bayer in 1894, shortly after completing his education in chemistry. In August of 1897, he successfully synthesized ASA, which Bayer would commercialize as aspirin. This drug became essential for pain relief and inflammation treatment and remains widely used today.

In the same year, Hoffmann also synthesized diamorphine, which Bayer introduced as heroin, initially used as a cough suppressant and pain reliever before its addictive properties were fully understood.

Following these achievements, Hoffmann transitioned to Bayer's pharmaceutical marketing department until his retirement in 1928.

A controversy emerged regarding the invention of aspirin. Though Hoffmann was long credited with the synthesis, Arthur Eichengrün later claimed that he instructed Hoffmann to synthesize ASA and had overseen the clinical testing. Walter Sneader supported Eichengrün's account in 1999, but Bayer continued to recognize Hoffmann as the inventor.

Despite the debate, Hoffmann's contributions to medicine were significant. He was posthumously inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002. Hoffmann led a private life; he never married or had children and died in Switzerland in 1946.
