        "text": "This resource accompanies the article From plant to pill in Education in Chemistry which delves into the science behind natural remedies and the research and development that brings medicines to the market.\n\nLearning objectives\n\nResearch, design and make a presentation.\n\nDescribe the discovery of aspirin and how its use has developed over time.\n\nExplain the chemistry of aspirin.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNearly all of us have used aspirin at some time in our lives, but not many of us know that for hundreds of years a related compound from willow bark was used to relieve pain and treat fevers. Records indicate its use from ancient times; at least 2500 years BC.\n\nIn this activity, learners will find out about the discovery and use of aspirin and present their findings as a poster, presentation or video.\n\nTimeline\n\nDateDevelopment\n\nTeacher notes\n\nThe history of aspirin and other medicines dealing with pain, fever or inflammation reveals many interesting points about scientific methodology and the interaction of people and society with technology. One overriding theme that emerges when looking at the development of medicines is the importance of sharing information and cooperation in research. Time and again discoveries in one part of the world have been published, but not developed fully until another person reads and uses the information in another time and place.\n\nThe emphasis in this activity is on learners finding out for themselves and presenting their findings to a suitable audience (LO1). Ask groups of learners to choose the format of their presentation from either a talk, poster or video. Hints and tips for making each type of presentation are included on the student sheet.\n\nYour role is to be supportive and offer advice. The fact sheet gives some background to the conditions treated, side effects, and methods testing new drugs (LO2). There is also a brief outline of some of the chemistry of aspirin (LO3), but learners must find out more than is given to them here (All LOs).\n\nAlternatively, you can set this task as an independent group activity, where learners work on the project in their own time. Learners can then peer assess each other’s work against the success criteria below.\n\nThe conditions that aspirin helps to relieve or cure, including technical terms such as analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and myocardial infarction.\n\nThe side effects of aspirin, and the alternative treatments for people who are affected by them.\n\nHow aspirin was developed over the past 260 years, including the achievements of those responsible for the main developments.\n\nThe chemistry involved in developing the medicine in a usable form.\n\nThe nature and importance of clinical trials.\n\nThe overall quality of the presentation.\n\nThe sources of information given.\n\nDifferentiation\n\nThe fact sheet contains information that can be used to support and guide learners as needed. In addition, a timeline is given in a separate document that teachers can optionally use to support learners who may find it challenging to construct their own from research. Using some or all of the information in the fact sheet will cut down on the research time, allowing learners to concentrate on putting the presentation or poster together.\n\nResources\n\nGroups will need:"
