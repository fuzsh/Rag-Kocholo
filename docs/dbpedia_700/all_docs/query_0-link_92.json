        "text": "Felix Hoffmann was a German chemist who, according to the Bayer website, in 1897, invented the first stable compound which would later be introduced as Aspirin. I will be eternally grateful for his efforts.\n\nYes, I went back to Jazzercise yesterday. Due to a long list of REASONS, (not to be confused with excuses) I haven’t exercised much lately. First there was the NASTY cold of late September and early October, followed closely by the sprained derriere incident of early November, then the holidays…I could go on, but what’s the point, really? Suffice to say, I am even more out of shape than is my custom.\n\nSince Sugar and I recently booked a trip to St. John to celebrate the milestone anniversary (let’s not get into which one, okay?) that we actually passed a couple years back when we were too over-committed to go on that first honeymoon we never took, very soon, I will have to put on a bathing suit.\n\nSo, yesterday, I drug myself on over to the dance floor and let The Queen of Pain start whipping me back into some semblance of shape. I nearly missed class because the UPS man was late getting here with our Korbel shipment, and I have to sign for that. Besides, I really didn’t want to leave champagne on the front porch. But, Brown showed up at the precise moment after which it would have been impossible for me to get to class on time.\n\nI was really worried this time that I wouldn’t be able to make it through a whole class. I told the QOP that I needed to stand in the back, but she would have none of it. “They don’t want to be running over you back there any more than we do,” she said. The woman has no empathy–none, I tell you. Later, it dawned on me that the reason she wanted me up front was that if she had to hop off the stage and perform CPR, she’d have less floor to cover.\n\nBy the Grace of the Good Lord, I make it through without a medical incident or fall, and I avoided throwing up on PPJ’s floor. Now I’m popping Aspirin and using the hand-held massager on my major muscle groups. I won’t be going to class today, as my body needs time to recover. But tomorrow I’ve got to haul myself back in there. Casey only has until March 19th to get me Caribbean-ready.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan\n\nOkay, the thing with Jazzercise is, you really can’t quit. They won’t let you—I’ve tried. It’s like a cult: Once you’re in, someone has to send a team of deprogrammers to kidnap you out.\n\nI had every intention of quitting earlier this month. But, as Betty (who power-guzzles her Kool- Aid) pointed out, my strategy was faulty. I went on a day when both Precariously Perky Julie and Casey, The Queen of Pain were there. I should have known better. They gave me all kinds of reasonable-sounding arguments why it was in my best interest not to quit. I caved.\n\nThen, I went out of town, again, like we all knew I would. Since I didn’t get home until after the 15th (the cutoff date for cancellations in any given month) I’m in through the end of September. This, of course, was their plan.\n\nBut… I figured I’d go ahead and fill out my cancellation for next month ahead of time (having come to my senses) when I drug myself in there yesterday.\n\nJules was ready for me. When I walked in the door, she shoved a clipboard at me and told me to fill out the form. Okay, I started doing that. A few lines in, I realized I was filling out the “I agree not to sue you if you kill me” form that everyone has to fill out once a year. I scratched my head. It wasn’t time for me to do this. “Why do I need to fill this out?” I asked.\n\nThe place was full of people—Jules had some kind of special going on. She was very CONVENIENTLY too distracted to answer except for an over-the-shoulder, “It’s the release.”\n\nWell, I knew THAT. I looked at her sideways. “You’re just trying to distract me from asking for my cancellation form.”\n\nShe trilled a laugh, tossed her ponytail, and quickly engaged in a serious conversation with someone behind me related to childcare.\n\n“Here, Susan.” One of the class managers handed me a ticket. “We’re having a drawing today.”\n\nWhen I turned back, Jules was chatting up a potential recruit. She had no time for my nonsense.\n\nThe crowd was moving toward the dance floor. All I could do was drop the clipboard and move with the group. It was that or be trampled.\n\nAfter an hour with The Queen of Pain, I was too tired to argue with them.\n\nResistance is futile. At least I’ll be 24 forever…\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan\n\nEvery few months I realize that I’m not home enough to make regular Jazzercise participation a reality. It’s more like something I really want to do, and so, in one of my alternate realities, I Jazzercise daily. Here in the real world my attendance is not so regular. But the draft to my checking account is.\n\nSo, every now and then I go in and fill out a form to cancel my draft. Precariously Perky Julie (who owns the place) is no dummy. You can’t cancel by civilized method like email or phone. You have to go there and fill out a form. Which makes you think, “Well, if I can drag myself in there to fill out the stupid form, maybe I should just put on my dancing clothes and go dance.” I have done this several times.\n\nEvery time I go through with the cancellation, I email Jules a day or three later and say, “Never mind.” Because every time I cancel, my schedule shifts (because Sugar’s does) and I end up being at home because I don’t typically go with him on a trip if he’s flying. Precariously Perky Julie WILL allow you to cancel your cancellation via phone, email, smoke-signal–whatever. Like I said, she’s no dummy.\n\nToday is August 9th. We are 221 days into 2010, and I have MAYBE been to 15 Jazzercise classes. I’m thinking I need to come up with an exercise plan I can actually execute. I’ve decided to make an iPod playlist and dance in the family room–just do random Jazzercise moves I’ve learned over the years plus whatever the music moves me to do. I think I’ll call this Spazzercise. If I’m out of town, I can Spazzercise in the hotel room.\n\nSince I’ve already paid for August, I’ll go dance with the Queen of Pain today. That way, I won’t have to have the argument with myself about whether or not I should just go (because I can today) or cancel. I’ll do both.\n\nI’ll let you know how long it lasts this time.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan\n\nI accidentally turned on Dr. Phil yesterday. Nothing against Dr. Phil, I’m sure he’s a great guy and all, but I don’t do daytime TV. But, I’d stayed up far too late reading, slept in, and, as is my custom, I flipped on the TV while I had breakfast. I was outside my usual time slot for breakfast. Typically the news is on. That’s a whole nother rant.\n\nI was fumbling–pre-coffee, mind you–with the remote, trying to turn the channel, when I heard this guy say, “I tried that low-carb diet. I snapped.”\n\nHe had my attention. I have SO been there. Several times, in fact.\n\nI squinted at the sign for the day’s episode. “The Ultimate Fat Debate.”\n\nOh. Dear. Tara.\n\nThey had my attention.\n\nThe guy who was undone by the low carb diet turned out to be a comedian, John Pinette. This guy is FUNNY, and he is so after my own heart. Talking about his personal trainer he says, “I don’t do ups. Sit ups, push-ups, chin-ups… I do downs. I can sit down, lie down…gimme a cheeseburger, I”ll wolf it down…” Some of his clips are available online. In another clip from this routine, he says, (as I have often maintained to The Queen of Pain herself) “Ups defy gravity. Gravity is a law, and I obey the law.”\n\nAside from the comedian, Dr. Phil had a panel, and I gotta say, they weren’t nearly as entertaining. Although, there were a few places where I thought they were going to go all Jerry Springer. That trainer chick from The Biggest Loser, was on, along with some guy with a shirt that said “No Chubbies.” They were squaring off against a group of VOLUPTOUS women from groups like The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. These women were (justifiably) NOT HAPPY with the chap in the “No Chubbies” shirt. I couldn’t look away.\n\nBut, I did hie me to Jazzercise yesterday, and defied gravity one more time.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan\n\nSo I’m back in Indiana this week, last week was Kentucky. I’ve had no access to Jazzercise–well except for the DVD’s I can use in the hotel room. I actually did this one day last week when the exercise room was full. Doing Jazzercise moves on carpet is less than optimal, but I tried. (Aerobic shoes don’t slide on carpet.)\n\nI’ve been using the treadmill, elliptical machine, and/or bike for an hour every day except the one, and I have to say, exercise is painfully dull when you’re watching the news instead of moving to the groove. Also, NO ONE in the exercise room taunts me with a microphone, or yells when I slack off. I’ve come to depend on that.\n\nI really don’t enjoy watching the news anyway. The only time I watch it is when I’m in the exercise room and someone else has it on. As if exercise wasn’t depressing enough…\n\nLast year around this time, Precariously Perky Julie devised a particularly brutal Jazzercise set. It was full of what my husband refers to as “Man-Hater” songs. Songs with lots of punching and kicking to lyrics like “Why’d you lie to me…good for nothing type of brother” (Anastacia) and “I’m not in love” (not the original by 10 CC but a remake).\n\nThe Queen of Pain used to have sets like this back during the unfortunate phase between He Whose Name Cannot be Uttered and when she found her True Love.\n\nPPJ roared and foamed at the mouth while teaching this set. At the time, I thought we really needed to find poor PPJ a man because we were all paying the price for what the last one had done–she like to put me in traction. I started to blog about it, but, then I thought, the poor girl is obviously upset about a recent breakup, so I didn’t.\n\nFast forward to this year’s Valentine’s Day set. Same songs. Same growling. Same pain. At one pint, she shouted, “Angry hips!” WTF? I allowed as how this set seemed familiar, and I asked her, “Jules, are you mad at the same man from last year, or is this a new one?”\n\n“ALL MEN!” she howled.\n\nHmm… this explains it. Women who look like Julie are without a man for one of three reasons: One, their romantic interests are not of the masculine variety (pretty sure that’s not the case here); Two, they have some sort of screw loose, and no matter how gorgeous they are, they keep running men off (you know, women who boil rabbits and such–again, not the case–PPJ is a sweetheart when she’s not kicking our rear ends); or, Three, some jackass has put them off men for good. They simply have decided they do not want another man, have adopted multiple cats, and watch a lot of reality TV.\n\nThis is our Julie.\n\nThis situation is not irreversible, but it requires a special man to repair the damage done to a woman’s psyche after she has been jackassed. I’m thinking that the clientele of Jazzercise of Taylors should perhaps mount a search before next Valentine’s Day. And, round up a posse to hunt down whoever did this to PPJ. We are paying for his jackassery.\n\nTime for my aspirin…\n\nOkay, so I wasn’t thrilled about coming home (where I have to make my own bed, breakfast, and afternoon cookies) but now that we’re here, I’m warming up to the place.\n\nNo matter how nice the folks are everywhere else, OUR PEOPLE are here. Some of them, anyway. Our family’s a little scattered, but there’s a clan of our relatives and friends in Greenville, and I do miss them when we’re gone.\n\nAlso, hotel beds have come a long way, but none of them is quite like the one in our room at home.\n\nAnd, while hotels have treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, and indoor pools, at home, I can go to Jazzercise and dance while being mocked by an insanely thin ALIEN. As I’ve mentioned a time or two, The Queen of Pain is gorgeous (but once again completely flat-chested now that she’s finished the final phase of her most recent birthing ritual–no more shimmying in her class–BLESS HER HEART). But, I think she’d be a little less cranky if she ate something besides salads and grilled chicken with steamed vegetables every day. You just know she’s NEVER had a Mega Moo Mocha Moo Latte.\n\nI want credit towards my 100 club T-shirt–which now takes 150 classes to earn–for all that huffing and puffing I did on treadmills, etc., but the Queen of Pain is having none of it. This is patently unfair, as I can’t attend class while out of town, but have been working our regularly–okay, semi-regularly. I think I’ll appeal this ruling to Precariously Perky Julie. I’m not holding my breath…\n\nOff to take some aspirin and soak in the tub.\n\nIt’s good to be home.\n\nShe’s baaack. Actually, she came back last week, but I had a very good REASON for not showing up on Wednesday. I had a migraine–weather changes, etc. I CANNOT exercise after taking a Relpax. I can’t drive after taking a Relpax, but that’s a whole nother story.\n\nThe Queen of Pain is back onstage at Jazzercise of Taylors, and every muscle in my body is aware. We got an early start on my New Year’s resolution today. She thinks (and I know this because she made a smartass comment during class–while wearing the mic) that I will abandon my early NYR by Wednesday. That sounds about right. On the other hand, I might stick with it just for the novelty. I have a vague memory of what being thin felt like. Seems like I was hungry a lot…\n\nQOP quote of the day: “Breathe through your noses. Those aren’t just for piercing.” I guess thirty women gasping for breath and clutching various body parts is unattractive.\n\nIn other Jazzercise news, the group that marched/danced in the Greenville Christmas parade won some sort of award–best dance troupe or some such. I did not participate–I’ve done the parade thing, back in high school. Only we didn’t shimmy.\n\nLook, I’m not saying that pole-dancing moves got them the award, but I did hear that they were PRET-TY theatrical when they pranced past the judges’ stand.\n\nI’m just saying…\n\nOff to pop some aspirin and soak in the Jacuzzi…\n\nThis is the best excuse I have for not going to Jazzercise. I’m just not feeling it. It’s Monday. Also, The Husband is home. He’s off this week, which I’m really, really, really SO HAPPY about.\n\nBut, when he’s home my routine heads south on a 747. I have to send him out on LONG errands just to get some writing in. Today’s actually been pretty good because he’s fascinated by that super-load generator traveling through South Carolina right now. Something about the size… (It’s so big it takes four tractor trucks to pull/push it around.) Whatever. It’s a guy thing. He’s been out with his brother looking at it for hours. They probably did a few other equally guy things. Hey, as long as they stayed out of nudie bars, I’m fine with it.\n\nI’m going to turn on some music and dance around the house for a while. Maybe that’ll burn enough calories to keep a pound or two at bay. If I sit still too long, weight jumps onto certain areas of my VOLUPTOUS frame and clings for dear life.\n\nWho am I kidding? This is Thanksgiving week. No matter what, I’ll gain five pounds. Maybe I’ll just relax and enjoy it. Where are those Lindor truffles?\n\nSo, I drug myself into Jazzercise today. This was a challenge, as by nature I am a lethargic sort. I like to dance (once I’m there). But I was home. I had books, food, wine–no pulsating need to go out. Not to mention I had work to do. My main character woke me up at 3 a.m. pitching a huge fit about wanting to ride a jet ski. I digress.\n\nPrecariously Perky Julie was onstage. The workout came complete with lots of Russian ballet moves–or possibly curse words–and her favorite, dramatic final poses. Maybe it was my imagination, but PPJ seemed a bit tense. Her words of wisdom and inspiration from the stage were very nearly worthy of The Queen of Pain. Here’s what PPJ had to allow (minus the stuff in Russian):\n\n10. You haven’t heard this song? You’re not hip, (This from the girl who included King of the Road in her set. Not that I have anything against Roger Miller, or songs written in 1965. I’m just saying.)\n\n9. And here we’ll just let our abs hang out. Not! Suck those in.\n\n8. I’ve got my eye on you.\n\n7. I hate to burst your ball-bubble, but we’re not sitting on those balls.\n\n6. No extraneous shaking. (Seriously, if we could pull that off would we need her?)\n\n5. The shirts for the Christmas parade come in a generous fit. (I’m buying a shirt, but I marched in my last parade in high school.)\n\n4. They hang long.\n\n3. Do not snarl at me during this song. I like it. (It was my trying-not-to-fall-out look. I promise.)\n\n2. Try not to let your legs just come careening down.\n\n1. Engage the muscle–don’t let it flap all over the place. (See #6)\n\nLike a pro, PPJ maintained her perkiness all during class. But I think her sunny disposition may be waning. This, I fear, is my fault. I am a challenge to PPJ. She likes people to smile while they sweat. That is SO not in my nature. I stand right in front of her.\n\nOne of those reality shows with dancing comes on tonight. That’ll cheer her up.\n\nThe voices in my head are singing Be as You Are by Kenny Chesney\n\nWhat I’m reading: For Better, For Murder by Lisa Bork\n\nFirst, the book. I met Lisa at Bouchercon at a Sisters in Crime lunch. She’s a very warm and gracious person, so I was predisposed to like the first book in the Broken Vows series. I would have loved it anyway–she had me when the dead body flopped out of a Ferrari in the showroom on page three.\n\nSo, Precariously Perky Julie tried to kill me at Jazzercise today. I think she might have been trying to commit a suicide dance, because at one point I heard her mutter something about a having a coronary herself. She had chocolate over the weekend–Halloween and all, so we had to pay.\n\nPPJ is a sweet spirit. She’s always smiling–bubbling, actually–even as she pushes us ever closer to a synchronized cardiac incident. (She did growl at me one day last week because I wasn’t sweating enough, but that’s unusual.)\n\nBut PPJ has the soul of a dancer. She knows all the real ballet names for the moves we do–in some foreign ballet language. Maybe Russian. Anyway, she’s serious about her dancing. She always picks the songs with the most intricate footwork for her sets. The ones where you change what you’re doing every four beats.\n\nNone of that dancing on autopilot while I zone out and dream of Mega Moo Mocha Moolattes. No. I have to PAY ATTENTION. I have to listen to her cuing. This is stressful.\n\nShe is also serious about the sweating. Today, someone in the back wasn’t disheveled enough to suit her towards the end of class. That caused her to drop the bubbling and growl. “Hey,” she yelled, “nobody leaves here pretty.” That’s never a problem with me.\n\nI do vex PPJ, though, I think. She seems to hold the opinion that I am sandbagging. She keeps trying to sell me a Polar watch to make sure my heart rate is high enough. There’s an alarm on those things for when your heart rate gets too high. I tried to tell her that fool alarm would be going off all during class, on account of I’m always in the blue on the perceived exertion chart–that’s the border color across the top, just above the maximum exertion before passing out.\n\nDo you know what she said? “Oh, we’ll just turn that off. That’s what I did with mine.” It’s nice to know she cares.\n\nThe rumor is the Queen of Pain will soon be back from her Alien Birthing Ritual–actually, it’s not a rumor, she told me that herself. It was either a warning or a threat, I’m not sure which.\n\nMeanwhile, I continue to test Precariously Perky Julie’s sunny disposition in my quest to become less VOLUPTUOUS while not needing EMTs to cart me out of there on a stretcher.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan\n\nThe voices in my head are singing My Baby Don’t Tolerate, by Lyle Lovett\n\nWhat I’m reading: Relentless by Dean Koontz\n\nPredictably, I had to rush right out and buy the new Dean Koontz novel (along with the new Michael Connelly, which is next up). Koontz didn’t disappoint. Like most of his books, Relentless will be a Shelfari favorite. I just wish these guys could write faster.\n\nAnd hey, Carl Hiaasen, I’d really like a new adult novel, please. I know your young adult books are fabulous, and the non-fiction golf thing is brilliant, but I’m neither a young adult nor a golfer. Please pull a few hilariously demented characters out of your head and get them on paper. Lickety-split.\n\nThis week I’m in Warsaw, Indiana, with Jim. Business trip for him, writer’s retreat for me. Hotel rooms, I may have said before, are the absolute best places for me to write. I can’t clean my house, run errands, do laundry, run out and have lunch with a friend, or any one of a hundred other things that pop up that keep me from putting words on the page.\n\nOr go to Jazzercise, which is the one other thing I need to be doing. In anticipation of this problem, however, I ordered three Jazzercise DVDs, reasoning that I could dance in a hotel room, right?\n\nWell, not so much, really.\n\nI started with Street Jazz! I’m always hassling Casey for some funk in her sets, so I picked this one first. The tag line specifically promises “street jam movements using a combination of jazz dance, hip hop, and funk.”\n\nI had NO idea how much your average Jazzercise instructor has to dummy this stuff down for ex-majorettes, cheerleaders, and drill team members across the country. I have a new appreciation for the Queen of Pain and all the other aliens who translate the moves that look like an MTV video played in fast forward into something the rest of us can attempt.\n\nIf I play the DVD in slow motion, I can maybe learn a section a day. I’m trying, anyway.\n\nThe other thing I hadn’t figured on was that in class, while Casey has to look at what I’m doing and not double over laughing (too often), in a hotel room, I have to watch myself. There’s a big mirror. This is so not pretty.\n\nAnyway, I’m writing, and I’m dancing. (Well, I’m moving to music, and in some cultures, I’m sure what I’m doing is called dancing.)\n\nAll is right with the world.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan\n\nThe voices in my head are singing Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight by Amos Lee\n\nWhat I’m Reading: Winter’s Child, by Margaret Maron\n\nOne of the most heinous tricks in the Jazzercise manual is where they take a perfectly good song, like Mary J. Blige’s Family Affair, and make you perform unnatural acts to it. The Queen of Pain currently has Family Affair in her set.\n\nVisualize yourself doing this: Put on some ankle weights–about 4-5 pounds on each ankle will do. Get down on your hands and knees. Now, stick a leg straight out (either one, cause you’ll switch back and forth). Move your leg from the hip, and tap your toe out to the side, then straighten, lift, point, lower and repeat. Do this 5,000 times.\n\nNow, with your leg still behind you, do PUSH-UPS while curling your leg toward the ceiling–yep–one of the two with a weight on it. Repeat, switch, etc. for FOUR MINUTES AND TWENTY-SIX seconds. Trust me, it will seem more like four hours. Try it.\n\nOn Monday, when I heard the opening beats of Family Affair, I reminded the QOP right off that A) my ankle weights have been mislaid, and B) I DON’T DO PUSH-UPS on account of the built in weights I sport on my chest make it impossible, from the whole gravity and physics perspective. She growled that I could do SOME of them, so I did. Three, I think. It was exhausting.\n\nYesterday, when the music started, she growled at me that I was going to do ALL FORTY-EIGHT push-ups. I laughed out loud. If she had asked me to run around the ceiling I would have taken her as seriously. I pointed out the obvious, and reminded her that she well knew this was not workable.\n\n“Shut up and do them,” she said. “All of them.”\n\nHere’s the part y’all won’t believe: I did.\n\nHere’s what I learned at Jazzercise yesterday. Sometimes you should just shut up and do it.\n\nAt the beginning of class she asked me what I’d been doing all day. “Editing,” I said.\n\nThis was true–sort of–in a metaphorical kind of way. What I had been editing (or trying to edit) were my career goals. I’ve been rewriting the same novel for several years, trying to get the first one just right. (As I understand it, some writers put their first book or three in a drawer never to see the light of day and publish their second or fourth novel, and others write the same novel many times until they have it right. I’ve always thought of myself as being in the latter group.)\n\nIt’s REALLY difficult to get a first novel sold in a good economy. When the economy is tight, well, it just gets harder. So, I’ve been trying to convince myself that I want to do something else–anything else. I have had zero luck with this. I am a writer. I need to write. I need to publish what I write, because, as Leonard Pitts allows, “…a writer without readers is like shouting in an empty room.” That’s where you get your loons, and Lord knows, I teeter precariously on that brink to begin with.\n\nSo today, I will just shut up and do it.\n\nEverything you need to know about life you can learn at Jazzercise…\n\nWell, okay, maybe not, but you can learn to pole dance (which is a good backup career plan–it’s recession proof) and you get an occasional kernel of philosophy.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan\n\nOkay, so, I KNOW better than to go to Precariously Perky Julie’s class. We’ve covered this, right? I planned ahead to go see The Caring and Nurturing One at 4:30. But then I lost track of time. Nothing to do but show up for Julie’s class, knowing full well this was suicide. Lest you think I exaggerate, at one point during the class she pipes up with, “Those of you who are grabbing your heart, please make sure it’s still beating.”\n\nJulie likes themed sets. Today’s theme was the upcoming Grammy awards. All of the songs we danced to are nominated for a Grammy. All I can say is that the music industry appears to be experiencing an up-tempo trend. Julie was dancing so fast I couldn’t see her feet move. But, she looked good doing it. I feel sure that the moves didn’t look the same from the stage. I was on the front row. Honestly, I don’t know how she kept a straight face.\n\nThere was one slow song–the very last one. It was a stretch/core muscle routine to Gravity by John Mayer. Nothing could have been more appropriate. Standing on one foot while contorting my body, using a hand weight to work my arms, and remembering to point my toes and “make it look pretty” challenged the law of gravity…and reason.\n\nJulie has these pre-printed “Valentines Day wish cards” for us to give our significant others so instead of flowers (which will die) and candy (which will make us fat) our loved ones can get us a gadget that looks like a watch but monitors your heart rate and counts calories burned. If they make a model that has an alarm for when you’re about to pass out, I might could use one.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan"
