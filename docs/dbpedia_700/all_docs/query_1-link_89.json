        "text": "In 2020 alone, German companies registered 25,954 inventions with the European Patent Office, making it Europe’s most creative country. (Only the US registered more patents that year, with 44,293.) Here we present the most important German inventions and the creative masterminds behind them …\n\n01\n\nThe television\n\nInvented by Manfred von Ardenne in 1930\n\nWe already had moving images from about 1926 onwards, but the devices were mechanical and the images were of poor quality. Hamburg native Manfred von Ardenne designed a light spot scanner that allowed the images to be transmitted electronically and thus more fluently. Von Ardenne presented his invention at the 1931 IFA [Berlin Radio Show]. Four years later, German broadcaster TV Station Paul Nipkow broadcast the first TV programme.\n\n02\n\nAspirin\n\nInvented by Felix Hoffmann in 1897\n\nWe don’t know how exactly he made this discovery, but the myth goes like this…\n\nFelix Hoffmann’s father is said to have suffered from a number of ailments. He took salicylic acid to counter the pain but this burnt the mucous membrane and led to nausea. In 1897, the young chemist, who had started at Bayer three years earlier to develop new medicines, got the idea of combining salicylic acid with acetic acid. The result: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), the active ingredient of Aspirin, which happens to be much easier to digest.\n\n03\n\nThe MP3\n\nInvented by Karlheinz Brandenburg in 1991\n\nMP3 stands for MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 and it caused a musical revolution in the ’90s, when Karlheinz Brandenburg of the Fraunhofer Institute found a way to compress music files. This technology first made it possible for us to send songs over the internet and listen to them on our smartphones. The very first MP3 song was the a cappella version of Tom’s Diner by Suzanne Vega.\n\n04\n\nThe tram\n\nInvented by Werner von Siemens in 1881\n\nEntrepreneur Werner von Siemens was in his element when it came to electricity. In 1880, his company – then still known as Siemens & Halske – had already showcased the first electric lift. A year later it was the first electric tram. On May 16, 1881, the 4.3-metre-long passenger car travelled from Lichterfelde to Kadettenanstalt in Berlin at 20kph.\n\n05\n\nPrinting\n\nInvented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1450\n\nIn 1450, Johannes Gutenberg had a very simple idea that triggered a media revolution: moveable metal print letters that could be used over and over again. Thanks to the printing press, text no longer had to be laboriously written out by hand, making it possible to produce multiple copies in a short time. He thus made a huge contribution to the spread of the German language and the battle against illiteracy.\n\nSadly, not much is known about Johannes Gutenberg (circa 1400-1468). But we do know his real name was Henne Gensfleisch. The name by which he is now known comes from the Gutenberg house where he grew up in Mainz.\n\n06\n\nThe car\n\nInvented by Carl Friedrich Benz in 1886\n\nOn January 29, 1886, Carl Friedrich Benz applied for a patent for the Benz Patent Motorwagen Nummer 1. The world’s first petrol car had three wheels and generated just 0.75hp, reaching a top speed of 16kph. But success failed to materialise. Critics derided the vehicle as a horseless carriage. It took a sneaky drive by his wife Bertha in 1888 to her sister almost 100km away in Pforzheim to convince people the car was a good thing.\n\n07\n\nComirnaty\n\nInvented by Özlem Türeci and Uğur Şahin in 2020\n\nIn 2008, Özlem Türeci and her husband Uğur Şahin founded pharmaceutical company BioNTech. Hardly anyone knew anything about the company in its early days and it didn’t even have a proper website until 2014. The company’s aim was to beat cancer using mRNA medicines – this form of therapy was still unusual at the time. When the first cases of COVID-19 in Asia became known, the duo from Mainz saw the danger and adapted their techniques to develop Comirnaty, the first mRNA vaccine against Covid-19, in 2020.\n\n08\n\nThe computer\n\nInvented by Konrad Zuse in 1941\n\nWhen asked why he invented the computer, former structural engineer Konrad Zuse once answered, jokingly, “I’m too lazy to count.” His first design, the 1938 Z1, was still unreliable, though. But three years later his Z3 proved to be the world’s first workable computer. It was a humongous thing, said to have weighed about a tonne and to have had some 30,000 wires. Sadly it was destroyed in a Second World War air raid.\n\n09\n\nX-Rays\n\nInvented by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen in 1895\n\nOther researchers also produced X-Rays with cathode ray tubes, but physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen was the first to understand their significance noticing on November 8, 1895 that objects covered with black cardboard lit up. Röntgen called his invention X-Rays, but his colleagues suggested they be named after him. In English, his original name won out.\n\nRelated\n\n10\n\nOLED technology\n\nInvented by Karl Leo in 1998\n\nPhysics professor Karl Leo and his team developed an organic semiconductor LED (OLED) in 1998. Now there’s OLED technology in many televisions and half the world’s smartphone displays. It’s far more energy-efficient than regular displays and has better colour resolution.\n\nWhat the expert says\n\nWhat requirements does an invention have to satisfy to receive a patent?\n\nIt must meet three conditions: it mustn’t be known anywhere else in the world. It also has to be inventive, which means not obvious to someone who works in the field, and it has to be commercially viable. Mathematical formulas, intellectual games and business procedures cannot receive a patent.\n\nGermany comes home in second place in terms of numbers of patents recorded pretty much every year. Why is that?\n\nPartly because of high expenditure on research and development, the fourth highest in the world. Plus, there are innovative companies with their headquarters in Germany. Of the ten companies that register most patents with the European Patent Office, three are German: Siemens (6th), Robert Bosch (7th) and BASF (10th).\n\nWhich fields are most German inventions from?\n\nThe five main technical areas for German patent applications in 2020 were electrical devices, including many inventions within the areas of climate technology, transport, measuring equipment, medical equipment and special devices from agricultural machinery to 3D printing.\n\nA patent application costs about €4000. Plus there are potentially other costs too. That’s a lot of money for a solo inventor …\n\nPatent protection really can get expensive. But small and medium-sized businesses can apply for support, from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, for example. And all the costs aren’t due at once. The applicant always has a chance to respond. Some costs only fall due when the patent is awarded, so three to four years into the process. And patents can help smaller and younger technology companies in particular to make a business breakthrough."
