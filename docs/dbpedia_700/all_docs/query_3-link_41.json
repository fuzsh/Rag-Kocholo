In my opinion the most insightful overview on the top drugs available and in poster form! In 2023 Keytruda (Pembroluzimab) was the best selling drug with 25 Billion in Sales. Ozempic (Semaglutide) already 3rd best selling drug in 2023 - let's see what happens in 2024. .You can get all the posters and high resolution versions here: https://lnkd.in/e7TyWAGd 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘀 TOP 200 DRUGS (2006-present): As part of our efforts to educate students about how chemistry positively impacts our lives, my research group has created the pharmaceutical posters shown below, which can be downloaded for free as high resolution PDF files from our website. We envisioned that this attractive graphical information would be a useful tool for teaching both undergraduate and graduate students in addition to serving as a spring board of ideas for researchers interested in the development of new synthetic methods and strategies. I hope everyone enjoys these posters as much as we have and I encourage all visitors to download them and use for teaching, fun chemical browsing, research purposes or even as an attractive and accessible graphical summary to help communicate to the public the critical role organic chemistry plays in the development of new medicines. New posters are completed and posted late spring or early summer every year. (Please e-mail us any mistakes you come across and we will make sure to correct them promptly). Part of material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. 0848324,1266365, 1565500, 1857708 and now 2153657.

Below is the summary of the research: During this research, I was able to work on the synthesis and characterization of 8-methoxyquinoline-5-sulfonyl proline, a derivative of quinoline. Quinoline and its derivatives have attracted significant attention due to their diverse biological activities, including anticancer, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Though I faced numerous challenges in the process of this research work but in the long run I was able to synthesize the compound of interest through series of chemical reactions involving, 8-hydroxyquinoline, 8-methoxyquinoline, and 8-methoxyquinoline-5-sulfonyl chloride. The experiment began with the synthesis of 8-methoxyquinoline which was achieved through simple alkylation of 8-hydroxyquinoline using methyl iodide as the alkylating agent. The resulting 8-methoxyquinoline was then subjected to sulfonylation using sulfonyl chloride to produce 8-methoxyquinoline-5-sulfonyl chloride. The 8-methoxyquinoline-5-sulfonyl chloride obtained was then treated with proline, an imino acid in the presence of hydrochloric acid which lead to the synthesis of the compound of interest. Other chemical reagents subsequently used during the synthesis were acetone, chloroform, potassium carbonate, calcium chloride, and chlorosulfonic acid. And the processes involved were distillation, color chromatography, reflux among other processes. Finally, the synthesized 8-methoxyquinoline-5-sulfunyl proline was evaluated for its biological activities and potential pharmaceutical applications in material science. Thanks to my supervisor, Prof. B.J Owolabi. I couldn't have achieved this without his guidance."
