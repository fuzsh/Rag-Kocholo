        "text": "Aspirin, a well-known term, has, since its inception, saved countless patients with its outstanding pain-relief and anti-inflammatory effects, becoming a widely used medication in the medical field. However, when it comes to heroin, people's greatest impression is its terrifying addictive nature and the immense toxicity it poses to the body and mind. Interestingly, these two vastly different drugs both originated from the same person. The inventor, known as the \"angelic devil\" in the world of chemistry, is Professor Felix Hoffman, a renowned German chemist, hailed by the world as the \"hand of God bringing both angels and demons at the same time.\"\n\nThe Era of Aspirin Begins\n\nIn fact, the origin of aspirin can be traced back to Ancient Greece when people had already learned to use willow bark (containing salicin) for medicinal purposes. The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates mentioned in his writings the use of willow leaf extract for pain relief and fever reduction. On April 25, 1763, Reverend Edward Stone from Oxfordshire, England, wrote a letter to the President of the Royal Society in London, reporting his use of willow bark to treat fevers. In the letter, he stated that he had administered the powdered bark to approximately 50 patients over five years, with almost no failures...\n\nIn 1874, Scottish doctor Thomas MacLagan successfully lowered the body temperature of rheumatic patients and relieved their pain and swelling using willow bark extract. Two years later, his experimental report was published in the medical journal \"The Lancet.\" Subsequently, other scientists isolated salicin from willow bark and prepared sodium salicylate, confirming its antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects. From then on, sodium salicylate was used in the treatment of fevers, rheumatism, and gout. However, sodium salicylate had a bitter taste and caused considerable discomfort in the stomach after ingestion.\n\nDuring Professor Hoffman's era, driven by his father's rheumatism, he embarked on the arduous journey to improve sodium salicylate. After numerous studies and experiments, Professor Hoffman successfully isolated pure acetylsalicylic acid, the precursor to aspirin. Experimental results showed that acetylsalicylic acid had excellent pain-relieving effects and a longer duration of action. Soon, Bayer, the company where Hoffman worked, recognized its value. In 1899, Bayer applied for various patents, including patent number 36433. The initials \"A\" for acetyl and \"Spir\" from Spiraea formed the new word Aspirin, the famous aspirin.\n\nIn the history of aspirin's invention, there is some controversy. Records indicate that a Jewish chemist, Arthur Eichengrün, played a crucial role in this invention. Due to the escalating persecution of Jews during the Nazi era in Germany, Eichengrün, being Jewish, had no voice. After the end of World War II, Eichengrün raised the issue, but he passed away shortly afterward, and the matter faded away. Nevertheless, Bayer's earliest experimental records were written by Hoffman, and Bayer officially acknowledges Hoffman as the inventor.\n\nHeroin - Pandora's Box\n\nAfter inventing aspirin, Hoffman noticed that the mainstream painkiller in the market was still morphine. As an outstanding pharmacologist, he was aware that long-term use of morphine could lead to strong dependence in patients. Therefore, driven by the desire to improve morphine, Hoffman, who had just achieved great success, once again immersed himself in the laboratory.\n\nIt's worth noting that morphine's precursor is the notorious opium (poppy), and in the early 19th century, a German pharmacist isolated and purified morphine from opium to help people overcome opium addiction. Over the next few decades, morphine became the most potent analgesic substance in the world. However, as a potent pain reliever, morphine still could not escape the high addictive nature inherited from opiate drugs. Faced with this double-edged sword, Hoffman was naturally impassioned. With the experience gained from aspirin, Hoffman found the process much easier this time. In just 11 days, he synthesized diacetylmorphine, now known as heroin.\n\nPerhaps due to dosage or different ingestion methods, animal experiments within Bayer showed significantly different results than those conducted over twenty years prior. In 1874, London chemists injected this substance into rabbits, causing them extreme fear, excessive salivation, vomiting, and other severe reactions. However, Bayer's animal experiments did not show serious adverse reactions, and its analgesic efficacy was at least 4 to 8 times higher than morphine. Therefore, Bayer considered it a significant breakthrough in the history of pharmacology and recognized Hoffman's outstanding contribution. They named diacetylmorphine \"Heroin,\" meaning \"hero\" in German.\n\nAt this moment, Professor Hoffman's intentions were good, wanting to bring a better painkiller to countless patients. However, he did not realize that he had unwittingly opened the \"Pandora's Box,\" bringing a demon into the world. Like aspirin, heroin gained market recognition upon its release. Initially, because patients received small doses orally, addiction did not occur. However, over time, former morphine addicts directly converted heroin liquid formulations into drugs. From then on, this German \"hero\" gradually turned into a ferocious beast.\n\nAfter 1930, the powerful addictive harm of heroin finally attracted market attention and was prohibited. By then, this demon from Pandora's Box had been unleashed for 33 years. The emergence of aspirin and heroin alleviated many pains for patients at that time. Despite the subsequent development of heroin deviating from Hoffman's original intentions, he deserves praise and remembrance for propelling humanity forward in the field of pain relief and anti-inflammation."
