        "text": "On this day in science Swiss chemist Germain Henri Hess was born He studied energy changes during chemical reactions, and postulated a method of predicting them – Hess’s Law. This is now routinely used by chemists to make predictions for enthalpy changes. Hess’s law states that the total enthalpy change of a reaction equals the sum of all the enthalpy changes occurring in each step of the reaction. In other words, net enthalpy is independent of the number of steps the reaction takes to complete. Hess’s law is a consequence of the conservation of energy. This law is essential because it establishes enthalpy as a state function. It allows us to calculate the overall enthalpy change by adding up the enthalpy changes for each step until the product is formed. For a reaction to obey Hess’s law, all the steps of the reaction must start and end at constant temperature and pressure. #science #chemistry #scienceandtechnology #pharma #physics #chemical #engineering #chemicalindustry ##onthisday\n\nOn this day in science Alexander Fleming was born. Fleming recived the 1945 Nobel prize (Medicine), for his work on discoverer of penicillin. Upon returning from holiday on September 3, 1928, Fleming began to sort through petri dishes containing colonies of Staphylococcus, bacteria that cause boils, sore throats and abscesses. He noticed something unusual on one dish. It was dotted with colonies, save for one area where a blob of mold was growing. The zone immediately around the mold—later identified as a rare strain of Penicillium notatum—was clear, as if the mold had secreted something that inhibited bacterial growth. Returning from holiday on September 3, 1928, Fleming began to sort through petri dishes containing colonies of Staphylococcus, bacteria that cause boils, sore throats and abscesses.

The zone immediately around the mold—later identified as a rare strain of Penicillium notatum—was clear, as if the mold had secreted something that inhibited bacterial growth. Fleming found that his \"mold juice\" was capable of killing a wide range of harmful bacteria. Fleming published his findings in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in June 1929, with only a passing reference to penicillin's potential therapeutic benefits. It was Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and their colleagues at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University who turned penicillin from a laboratory curiosity into a life-saving drug. Their work on the purification and chemistry of penicillin began in earnest in 1939, just when wartime conditions were beginning to make research especially difficult. On February 12, 1941, a 43-year old policeman, Albert Alexander, became the first recipient of the Oxford penicillin. He had scratched the side of his mouth while pruning roses, and had developed a life-threatening infection. Penicillin was injected and within days he made a remarkable recovery. But supplies of the drug ran out and he died a few days later. A number of British companies, including Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline) and Kemball Bishop, a London firm later bought by Pfizer, took up the challenge. #science #biotech #biopharmaceuticals #pharmaceutical #biopharma #scienceandtechnology #pencilline #antibioticresistance #antibiotics #chemistry #medicalsciences #pfizerproud #sepsis #infection #bacteria #Fleming\n\nOn this day in science Seymour (Sandy) Lipsky was born He was one of the main the inventors of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is a technique used to separate, purify and identify molecules. HPLC is a highly sensitive method with a range of applications, such as detecting the presence of performance-enhancing drugs in urine samples. HPLC Historical Development: Historical people typically point to Csaba Horváth and Seymour (Sandy) Lipsky of Yale University publishing a paper in 1966 on ion-exchange separation of organic compounds (Nature 1966, DOI: 10.1038/211748a0). They followed up one year later with a paper on fast liquid chromatography in which they used a pump operating at higher pressures than in their previous work (Anal. Chem. 1967, DOI: 10.1021/ac60256a003). They were among the pioneers at the landmark Las Vegas meeting who introduced the rest of the chromatography community to what would come to be called HPLC. https://lnkd.in/efRS5sdG #hplc #chromatography ##scienceandtechnology #chemistry #biopharmaceuticals #bioanalysis #analyticalchemistry #biotech #researchanddevelopment #chemical #science\n\nOn this day in science Nicolas-Jacques Conté was born Pencils are are known to have originated in the 16th century when the world discovered graphite. This crystallized form of carbon was found somewhere around 1565 or even earlier, near Keswick, England. Legend says a storm uprooted a tree here, and clinging to the tree roots was a shiny black substance — graphite! 18th-century German chemist A. G. Werner was responsible for naming it ‘graphite’, from the Greek word ‘graphein,’ which means ‘to write’. In the early days after the discovery, local shepherds were the only ones using graphite to mark their sheep. Because it looked so much like lead, people would call it plumbago — the Latin word for lead, i.e., ‘plumbus’ — or even ‘black lead’. This connotation stuck to graphite, and consequently, pencils too. After Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner published his drawing of a strip of graphite inside a tube of wood, the ‘pencil’ began to spread throughout Europe. Britain still had a monopoly over pencil making, and graphite, at this time. By 1794, however, France was cut off from this supply of pencils due to their war with Britain. Thus, French engineer Nicolas-Jacques Conté was responsible for inventing ‘Crayons Conté’, which was low-quality graphite mixed with clay, shaped into rods, and baked. This method is still used to make pencils today. Until this point, pencil leads were made from pure graphite sticks that could only be imported to France from Cumbria in the UK. By varying the ratio of clay and graphite powder, the hardness of the pencil lead could also be changed. Continental pencil makers no longer needed to rely on the British for pencils. Conté’s invention spurred more innovation in the world of pencil making. Germany, France, America — each country conducted their own experiments, and pencil making became commonplace around the globe. These pencils were great, but the wood around was not. In fact, it was often of low quality. Soon, people hit upon the idea of painting pencils to mask the quality of the wood. Only the fanciest pencils went unpainted. And then, at the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris, an Austro-Hungarian pencil company unveiled a new luxury pencil — which was painted yellow. It was named Koh-I-Noor after the largest and best diamond in the world. Because of this, yellow came to be associated with quality, and many other pencil makers picked up this color to adorn their pencils. Even today, the U.S. paints pencils and other writing instruments yellow to represent quality. #onthisday #France #pencil #pencils #pencilsketch #sciencecommunication #scienceandtechnology #science #researchanddevelopment #research #frenchculture #chemistry #chemical #graphitedrawing #graphite Graphic of Nicolas-Jacques Conté"
