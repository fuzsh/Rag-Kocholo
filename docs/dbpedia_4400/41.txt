Catherine Hardwicke has an eye on her next gig.

The Twilight director has signed on to helm the first two episode of USA Network’s crime thriller Eyewitness, the network has confirmed.

Hardwicke will also exec produce the series, which was adapted from a Norwegian series by Shades of Blue creator Adi Hasak. The project got a straight-to-series pickup in January.

Eyewitness centers on two innocent teenage boys who secretly witness a shooting in the forest and barely escape with their lives. Desperate to keep their relationship a secret and in fear of being found by the shooter, they remain silent but soon learn that what has been seen cannot be unseen and witnessing such a horrible event changes everything.

Hasak will serve as showrunner and executive produce alongside Norwegian series creator Jarl Emsell Larsen. Universal Cable Productions will produce the series, which goes into production later this year in Canada to debut sometime later this year.

This is not the first time Hasak’s work has attracted high-profile talent behind the camera. Oscar winner Barry Levinson directed the first two episodes of Shades of Blue, and also serves as an executive producer on the cop drama, which is currently in the midst of its freshman run on NBC.

Hardwicke has dabbled in television several times before. She has directed episodes of AMC dramas Hell on Wheels and Low Winter Sun, as well as the pilot of the short-lived CBS drama Reckless, which she also exec produced. She was most recently involved with the MTV cyber drama Eye Candy. Her other directing credits include Thirteen and the 2015 Drew Barrymore film Miss You Already.
