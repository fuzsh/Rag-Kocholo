        "text": "And Then There Were Fewer\n\nWhen the Griffins and other residents of Quahog are invited to visit the mansion of James Woods, the evening turns into a real murder mystery when guests end up dead and everyone scrambles to figure out who done it. Guest voices Drew Barrymore, James Woods and Ashley Tisdale.\n\nAquamom\n\nSeason Three premiere. When Vince's plan to bring a 'premiere-worthy' date to the 'Aquaman' premiere fails, Eric bails him out with a Plan B. Turtle and Drama's attempt to get two extra tickets for a couple of 'video ho's' incites the ire of Vince's co-star. And, with money tight, Ari adjusts to his new digs.\n\nSomething, Something, Something Dark Side, Part 1\n\nHoly ship! The Family Guy empire strikes back with another hilarious parody of your favorite sci-fi saga! May the laughs be with you as (Chris) Skywalker joins forces with (Peter) Solo and Princess (Lois) Leia to battle (Stewie) Vader and his Imperial minions. A host of new characters come along for the wild ride, including Mort Goldman as Lando Calrissian, Chrisâ boss Carl as Yoda, and the Giant Chicken as the nefarious Boba Fett. Itâs an outrageous, out-of-this-world experience youâll âsaberâ for light-years to come!\n\nBrian Griffin's House of Payne\n\nWhen Lois reads Brianâs pilot script, she falls in love with it and insists that he meet with network executives to pitch it. The execs respond positively, and the initial casting session goes well with Elijah Wood (guest-voicing as himself) auditioning for the lead role. But when the suits insist that Brian hire James Woods (guest-voicing as himself) and change the entire concept, Brian finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Meanwhile, Chris and Meg seriously injure Stewie and try to cover it up."
