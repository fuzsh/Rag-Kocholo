Guy Michelmore composed the series' opening and ending themes, as well as the score for each individual episode of Season 1, with Guy Dagul writing the score for each individual episode of Seasons 2 and 3, respectively. Dagul's scores for season 3 also incorporated stock music tracks and cues by Dick DeBenedictis.\n\nEyewitness, like most other shows of its kind, is a documentary series. Each half-hour episode focuses on a single subject in the field of natural science, such as the Solar System or the various functions of the human body, similar in form to the book series on which it was based, with most being based, in part or in whole, off of existing book titles at the time, with few exceptions (though some titles, such as Planets and Natural Disaster, the series finale, started off as episodes and were made into books years later).\n\nThe series takes place in the fictional \"Eyewitness Museum\", a CGI science museum made to replicate, enhance, and expand upon the much-imitated white and empty signature visual style of the books that made them so successful in the first place. Combining fact with fiction, various galleries within the museum are always featured and change constantly with each season and episode and stock footage, which is usually seen through large windows or other depressions in the walls of the museum is also shown regularly. The original book series is known for its striking visual style involving objects specially photographed against a plain white background, and the accompanying TV series brings this to life through video and audio. In addition, almost every episode features a \"Hero\". The Hero is an animal, character, or object which drives the action of the episode and is continually referred back to throughout. These include the rooster-shaped weathervane from Weather, Legs the claymation Tyrannosaurus from Dinosaur, the shape-shifting paper boat from Pond and River, the hyena from Monster, the salmon from Fish, the crab from Seashore, the cockroach from Prehistoric Life, the robotic human mime artist from Human Machine, Smedley the living human skeleton from Skeleton, Connell from Dog, and the husky and king penguin from Arctic and Antarctic.\n\nThe original British version of the series was narrated by the late Andrew Sachs for its entire run, while the American dub had Martin Sheen narrating for the first two seasons. However, Sachs took over narrating both versions (with his voice dubbed into American English for that region) for the third and final season. The series producer was Bill Butt for the first season, Briget Sneyd and sometimes Richard Thomson whenever Sneyd had to serve as editor for the second season, and Martin Mortimore for the third season.\n\nIn the US, the series aired in primetime on PBS nationwide. When the series was released onto VHS following the original run of each season, the US version of episodes from the first two seasons featured brief behind-the-scenes \"making of\" clips, each lasting five minutes after the main program, with the UK version having this feature for episodes of the third and final season. In 2003, eight episodes of the series were released onto interactive DVDs that featured interactive links to brief clips from other episodes of the series during the main program. The UK narration was kept in the American releases of these interactive DVDs, which were distributed by the Library Video Company through its Schlessinger Media division. A few years later, continuing well into the early 2010’s, a larger number of episodes were released onto DVD in the US. The US narration was included on these releases, as well as the first special as a bonus feature.\n\nThere are also four Eyewitness Virtual Reality software titles based on the series: \"Cat\", \"Bird\", \"Dinosaur Hunter\", and \"Earth Quest\". One of these, \"Shark\", although seen on the elevator console, was never made.\n\nEyewitness has also been dubbed into other languages for broadcast internationally, including Spanish, Italian, French, German, Russian, Indonesian, and Finnish, among others.\n\nAll original air dates are for PBS, as recorded in Newspapers.com.\n\nNo. Title Original air date 1\"Cat\"3 April 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses cats, both wild and domestic.\n\n2\"Horse\"10 April 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses horses and their wild relatives.\n\n3\"Reptile\"17 April 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses reptiles.\n\n4\"Fish\"24 April 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses fish.\n\n5\"Dog\"1 May 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses dogs and their wild relatives and ancestors.\n\n6\"Bird\"8 May 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses birds.\n\n7\"Elephant\"15 May 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses elephants.\n\n8\"Shark\"22 May 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses sharks and their relatives, rays and skates.\n\n9\"Insect\"29 May 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses insects.\n\n10\"Amphibian\"5 June 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses amphibians.\n\n11\"Dinosaur\"12 June 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses dinosaurs.\n\n12\"Jungle\"19 June 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses rainforests.\n\n13\"Skeleton\"26 June 1995 ( )\n\nDiscusses the skeletal system and how it varies in different species, including humans.\n\nNo. Title Original air date 1\"Volcano\"14 October 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses volcanoes and earthquakes.\n\n2\"Ape\"21 October 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses non-human primates.\n\n3\"Prehistoric Life\"28 October 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses the origin and evolution of life on Earth, from the earliest microbes to the appearance of modern humans.\n\n4\"Seashore\"4 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses the intertidal zone.\n\n5\"Tree\"11 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses trees.\n\n6\"Desert\"18 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses deserts.\n\n7\"Shell\"25 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses shells.\n\n8\"Butterfly and Moth\"2 December 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses butterflies and moths.\n\n9\"Pond and River\"5 May 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses rivers and ponds.\n\n10\"Mammal\"19 May 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses mammals.\n\n11\"Rock and Mineral\"26 May 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses geology.\n\n12\"Arctic and Antarctic\"2 June 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses the Earth's polar regions.\n\n13\"Weather\"16 June 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses weather.\n\nNo. Title Original air date 1\"Planets\"22 January 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses the planets and other objects in our Solar System, as well as their study and exploration, past present, and future.\n\n2\"Flight\"29 January 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses the history and properties of flight-both in nature and in human civilization, past, present and future.\n\n3\"Life\"5 February 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses biology.\n\n4\"Sight\"12 February 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses the world of vision.\n\n5\"Bear\"19 February 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses bears.\n\n6\"Natural Disaster\"26 February 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses natural disasters-earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, avalanches, drought, wildfires, and asteroid impacts.\n\n7\"Plant\"5 March 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses plants.\n\n8\"Survival\"26 March 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses how animals survive in the natural world.\n\n9\"The Human Machine\"2 April 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses the human body.\n\n10\"Mountain\"9 April 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses mountains.\n\n11\"Ocean\"16 April 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses oceans.\n\n12\"Island\"23 April 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses islands.\n\n13\"Monster\"30 April 1998 ( )\n\nDiscusses both mythical and real-life monsters.\n\nThe Making of Eyewitness (US only)\n\nThe Making of Eyewitness 2 (US only)\n\nThe Making of Eyewitness 3 (UK only)\n\nIt has won several awards, including at least two Emmys:\n\n1994 Parent's Choice Award (for Jungle)\n\n1996 NEA Award\n\n1996 1997 and 1998 Golden Gate Awards\n\nChicago International Children's Film Festival Excellence in Children's Media"
