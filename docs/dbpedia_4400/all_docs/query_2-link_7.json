        "text": "Eyewitness Community Survey\n\nWhat is Eyewitness Community Survey?\n\nEyewitness Community Survey is a citizen science tool that helps communities get healthier by collecting information from their local environment. We Engage 4 Health invites children from grade 5 and up and adults of all ages to participate. ECS observers walk the community, make observations, and answer survey questions on a smart phone or tablet to capture the data.\n\nImportant Features of ECS\n\nECS is a standardized tool that allows data from many observers in a community to be captured and later pooled together.\n\nTo allow data to be pooled, each ECS observer needs to follow the same process (protocol).\n\nA community can customize some parts of the ECS question set to focus on issues of greatest concern.\n\nWho Can Use the ECS Tool?\n\nAny group or organization with an interest in the relationship between health and their local environment can request training to use the ECS tool. In some cases, instruments to collect air pollution measurements can be loaned to groups using the ECS tool as an added source of data. Just get in touch using the interest form, and a We Engage 4 Health team member will contact you!\n\nHow Does My Group Learn to Use the ECS Tool?\n\nTraining to use the ECS tool is provided through a series of three graphic-style stories.\n\nExploring the Environment\n\nEnvironment is Everywhere\n\nBecoming an Expert Eyewitness\n\nThese stories are available to read as online flipbooks, as printable PDF files, and as videos with voices playing the characters. You can view the videos below.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video\n\nInterest Form\n\nProvide us with contact information, and we will send you information about getting your group involved in participating as citizen scientists using the Eyewitness Community Survey tool!\n\nI'm interested in these Cincinnati-area WE4H programs\n\nHealth is Happenin' RAP meeting series\n\nCitizen Science RAP meeting series\n\nCommunity Health Fair\n\nHealth Fellowship Event\n\nEyewitness Community Survey Citizen Science Tool\n\nResearch Ready (health research) Discussion\n\nCOVID Literacy Vaccine Discussion\n\nI am interested attending training for these WE4H health outreach opportunities\n\nCommunity Research Advocate (sharing information about health research in your community)\n\nCovid Literacy Champions (sharing information about COVID vaccination in your community)\n\nRAP Session Facilitator\n\nI'm interested in attending Cincinnati-area WE4H programs OR hosting programs at my organization\n\nYes, attending\n\nYes, hosting\n\nYes, attending and hosting\n\nAt what organization would you like to host programs?(Required)\n\nWhat is your language preference for attending or hosting programs?(Required)\n\nEnglish\n\nSpanish\n\nEnglish + Spanish\n\nYes!
