        "text": "March 1, 2017\n\nIt is being reported that USA will not be ordering further installments of Eyewitness, cancelling the new crime drama after just one season. The series premiered last fall, airing Sundays at 10:00pm, but ultimately failed to draw enough viewership in its time slot. Originally receiving a straight-to-series order in January of last year, the show was envisioned as an anthology were it to span multiple seasons.\n\nBased on a short-lived Norwegian series, Eyewitness followed the story of two unsuspecting teenage boys who end up seeing a multiple shooting while together at a forest cabin. Now witnesses to a grisly crime, the two keep quiet out of fear of the perpetrator and that others will find out about their relationship. Unfortunately, they soon realize that the horrible atrocity they witnessed has changed their lives forever."
