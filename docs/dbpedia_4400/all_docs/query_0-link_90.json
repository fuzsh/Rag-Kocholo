seeks revenge The famed 36-year-old stuntman who landed in the hospital May 26 (Memorial Day) when he failed to clear 13 buses before 75000 onlookers at Wembley Stadium wants to try again Hurtling through the air in excess of 100 mph he just massed clearing the last row of buses single-deck types not the double-deckers After the fall he somersaulted over the handlebars and slid along the ground before the machine crashed on top of him Evel is now at his home in Butte Mont recovering from a crushed vertebra broken pelvis and a fractured right hand The showman who graduated last week from two crutches to-one was told by his doctor that his healing was three weeks ahead of schedule Knievel will try again to even the score with his latest nemesis at London in early October before an expected crowd of 1 00000 The blond and handsome 6-foot 175-pounder said he had a feeling he was going to miss \"I have the speed I wanted Those buses were eight and a half feet wide US buses are eight feet I

millions more watching closed-circuit television For his try Evel pocketed $6 million But Evel certainly has paid the price of success with more than 300 jumps in which he crashed 11 times to the tune of 50 separate fractures by his count and 14 major operations statistics that become more painfully credible when you watch his walk: the crabbed hip-stiff hobble of a land-mine victim if Your sportstalker happened to be in Butte over the weekend and phoned Evel for an interview He said going to shoot some golf Come along\" Despite his ailments Evel showed uncanny skill at hitting a golf ball long and straight His home an eight-acre spread and stables for his horses is off Butte Country 16th green pretty wife Linda and their spirited offspring Kelly 14 Robbie 12 and daughter Tracy 10
