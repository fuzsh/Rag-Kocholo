        "text": "Global Eyewitness FAQ\n\nWhat is Global Eyewitness?\n\nA rigorous and rewarding two-course program where students travel internationally to create multimedia stories. You will gain a deep understanding of cultures, histories and contemporary issues to create rich and contextualized stories told with empathy, integrity and accountability. Plan ahead now!\n\nI am a writer, can I still apply?\n\nYes, but this program is more visually focused. If you are a writer you need to have photo/video skills to effectively tell these stories.\n\nWhat does the class entail?\n\nTwo 16-week courses, one in the fall (JOUR491) and one in the spring (JOUR490B) with travel over Winter term (first two weeks of January).\n\nFall term 2024: Meet in class as well to learn about bias in reporting, solutions journalism and trauma-informed reporting. You will also learn about Vietnam, its history and culture. You will complete field work assignments to produce a multimedia project due at the end of the semester, before the trip.\n\nWinter Term 2025: Travel to Vietnam to report.\n\nSpring Term 2025: Meet in class to produce your stories for publication and presentation.\n\nAre there prerequisites?\n\nYes. JOUR 346: Nebraska Mosaic, JOMC 101, JOMC 130-134, JOUR 200A with a C or higher; ADPR 151, ADPR 221, ADPR 283 or BRDC 227, BRDC 269, BRDC 260 or SPMC 150, 250 or JOUR 200B with a C or higher; junior in good academic standing. There is also an application process to course admission.\n\nHow long will we be in Vietnam?\n\nAbout three weeks. You will be reporting/gathering photos and video for most of the trip, however there will be planned excursions to provide breaks as well as to learn about culture and history and of course, to do some sightseeing.\n\nWho pays for the trip?\n\nYou pay for your tuition. The cost of the flight and lodging as well as any planned excursions as part of the course are paid for by a generous endowment. You pay for your meals, transportation that is not part of the course and any incidentals. A rough cost-to-student estimate is $500-$600 (in addition to tuition).\n\nDo I have to take both semesters?\n\nYes.\n\nWill I have to pay for winter term?\n\nAt this time, we are working to combine this as part of either the Fall or Spring course to reduce your cost.\n\nI’m interested, what’s next?\n\nThe application has closed and selected students have been contacted. Questions? Email Chris Graves or Shoun Hill.\n\nApplications for the 2024-2025 academic year have closed.\n\nThe 2025-2026 application will open in February 2025.\n\nStatement on Global Eyewitness\n\nIn November, 2020, the college was contacted by a group of College of Journalism and Mass Communications alums to discuss the Global Eyewitness program, an endowed program providing UNL CoJMC students interested in photojournalism, multimedia and writing the opportunity to travel internationally and develop compelling stories. In the meeting that followed, alums expressed their frustration over the stagnation of the program they felt had remained virtually unchanged over the years despite societal changes and expectations. It was clear that these former Global Eyewitness students cared deeply about the program. They also felt deeply hurt by the College’s lack of attention to the concerns they and others had expressed about the program over the years.\n\nRead More\n\nContact Chris with Questions\n\nChris Graves\n\nAssistant Professor of Practice; Deepe Family Chair in Depth Reporting\n\nchris.graves@unl.edu\n\nContact Shoun with Questions\n\nShoun Hill\n\nAssistant Professor of Practice; Buffett-Mangelsen-Sartore Chair\n\nshoun.hill@unl.edu"
