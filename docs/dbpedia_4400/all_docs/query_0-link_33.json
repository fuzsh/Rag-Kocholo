        "text": "From Wikipedia:\n\nChecking In is a short-lived 1981 television sitcom and spin-off of The Jeffersons, which itself had spun off from All in the Family.\n\nIn the series, the Jeffersons' maid, Florence Johnston, played by Marla Gibbs, accepted a job to become the executive housekeeper at the fictional St. Frederick Hotel in Manhattan.\n\nChecking In premiered on CBS on April 9, 1981. It lasted for only four episodes. Faced with low ratings, the series was swiftly cancelled, ending the show on April 30, 1981. Gibbs returned to The Jeffersons as the character of Florence. It was explained that the St. Frederick Hotel had burned down, so Florence decided to return to her former job with the Jeffersons.\n\nChecking In was one of the rare All in the Family-related series that was not successful, unlike The Jeffersons, Maude, and Good Times. It was also a rare example of character/s being \"spun off\" to their own show and when the spin-off was unsuccessful, returning to the \"parent\" series (Joanie Loves Chachi and Grady were others)\n\nStarring\n\n* Marla Gibbs: Florence Johnston\n\n* Larry Linville: Lyle Block\n\n* Ruth Brown: Betty\n\n* Patrick Collins: Earl Bellamy\n\n* Robert Costanzo: Hank Sabatino\n\n* Jordan Gibbs: Dennis\n\n* Liz Torres: Elena Beltran\n\nCountry of origin United States\n\nLanguage(s) English\n\nNo. of seasons 1\n\nNo. of episodes 4\n\nProduction\n\nRunning time 30 minutes\n\nProduction company(s) TAT Communications, Inc.\n\nBroadcast\n\nOriginal channel CBS\n\nOriginal run 9 April 1981 â€“ 30 April 1981"
