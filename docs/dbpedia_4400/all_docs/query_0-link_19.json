        "text": "Wednesday 28 August\n\nParalympics Paris 2024: Opening Ceremony\n\nChannel 4, 6.30pm\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics attempted to turn the City of Light itself into a venue, with more than 10,000 athletes parading on boats down the Seine. Daring in theory, but disastrously rainswept in reality. The organisers of tonight’s Paralympic opening ceremony will be holding out hope for clearer skies. It continues the theme of eschewing\n\na traditional stadium setting. Instead, more than 4,000 para-athletes will parade along the Champs-Élysées to the Place de la Concorde. Then follows a spectacle of lights and music. Clare Balding presents tonight’s coverage, which will kick-start 12 days of Paralympic sport across Channel 4, More4 and streaming.\n\nAcerbic chat show The Last Leg has also relocated to Paris, and will be broadcasting live nightly to recap each day’s events. The first episode will follow the ceremony (at 10.30pm) and will feature the likes of comedians Rosie Jones and Josh Pugh in the studio, plus former rugby union player and fellow Paralympics presenter Ed Jackson. At 11.30pm, you can also catch a repeat of The Last Leg host’s Adam Hills’s moving documentary Grow Another Foot, about his quest to play rugby. SK\n\nCostco vs the Supermarkets: Who Does It Cheaper?\n\nChannel 5, 7pm\n\nWholesale chain Costco provides its members with exclusive bargains; the catch is that you have to buy in bulk. As this one-off argues, however, the retailer is in danger of being undercut by supermarkets. Is the cost of a membership still worth it? Or are you better off ditching the van and heading to Lidl?\n\nThe Repair Shop\n\nBBC One, 8pm\n\nThe most remarkable heirloom in need of repair this week is a broken silver ring brought in by mother-daughter duo Halina and Lesley. It was a gift given to Halina’s mother during the Second World War, a thank you for risking her life to pass food to families imprisoned in Warsaw’s Jewish ghetto.\n\nCelebrity Race Across the World\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nThe epic race enters its third week. Tonight, the celebrities must travel 2,400 km from the small town of Lençóis, Brazil, to the bustling metropolis that is São Paulo. There is a particularly poignant moment in which father-and-son Jeff and Freddy Brazier mark the death of the latter’s mother, Jade Goody. For Freddy, it is strange to reminisce about someone he barely knew.\n\nCause of Death\n\nChannel 5, 9pm\n\nTonight’s episode of the true-crime docu-series concerns 34-year-old Natalie Anne Caine, who died soon after suffering from heart palpitations. The coroner attempts to determine the cause of death – was her neurofibromatosis a factor? Elsewhere, the team must try to find the next of kin of a man found collapsed at home.\n\nKidnapped: The Chloe Ayling Story\n\nBBC Three, 9pm & 9.30pm\n\nKidnapped model Chloe Ayling (Nadia Parkes) is now free. But, as tonight’s concluding two-part instalment of the true-crime drama shows, her ordeal was only just beginning: a savage press whirlwind and a high-stakes trial to clear her name ensued.\n\nRob & Romesh vs Hollywood Stunts\n\nSky Max, 9pm\n\nIn the saturated genre of “comedians going places and doing things”, Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan are by far the funniest and most effortless. This long-running series, in which the pair try out a range of careers, returns with a mission to turn them into Hollywood stuntmen. Watch out for the hilarious moment in which Ranganathan’s heart is stolen by actor Ryan Gosling.\n\nPercy Jackson & the Lightning Thief (2010) ★★★\n\nFilm4, 6.45pm\n\nIn this first adaptation of Rick Riordan’s bestselling children’s books, Percy (Logan Lerman) learns from centaur Pierce Brosnan that he’s the son of Poseidon and has been framed for the theft of Zeus’s lightning bolt. He teams up with a wise-cracking satyr and Athena’s warrior daughter to save the world from ruin. The far superior TV version, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, is available on Disney+.\n\nAd Astra (2019) ★★★★\n\nFilm4, 9pm\n\nJames Gray gives us an elegant and staggeringly visualised adventure that deconstructs the dogged kind of alpha-heroism glorified by far too many US space movies. Brad Pitt plays Roy McBride, an astronaut sent on an odyssey to Mars where he must confront his renegade father (and save Earth while he is at it). The strong supporting cast includes Ruth Negga, Tommy Lee Jones and the late, great Donald Sutherland.\n\nThe Shallows (2016) ★★★★\n\nGREAT! Movies, 9pm\n\nLet’s cut right to the chase: here is a film in which a bronzed Blake Lively spends an hour and a half fighting a great white shark off the coast of Australia. Are you sold? Jaume Collet-Serra’s survival thriller features every drop of profundity suggested by its title, but who cares. It’s a sinewy, aerobicised production with oodles of charm and excitement – and not a drop of pretension. Óscar Jaenada and Brett Cullen co-star.\n\nThursday 29 August\n\nKaos\n\nNetflix\n\nFrom hit tween drama Percy Jackson and the Olympians on Disney+ to Margaret Atwood and Madeline Miller’s bestselling novels, the world can’t get enough of modern retellings of Greek myths. Netflix has decided to muscle in on the hype with this terrifically daft, deft take on ancient Greece’s ultimate Big Guy. Jeff Goldblum plays Zeus as a neurotic, self-obsessed manchild who spirals into paranoia when he wakes up one morning and spots a wrinkle in the mirror; cue pity for his poor friend-turned-prisoner Prometheus (Stephen Dillane), who Zeus begins to believe is plotting his downfall.\n\nCreated by self-confessed Classics geek Charlie Covell (The End of the F***ing World), Kaos recruits a heavenly supporting cast – Janet McTeer plays Zeus’s plotting wife Hera, Juice’s Nabhaan Rizwan delights as their hedonistic son Dionysus and David Thewlis brings heft to the role of Underworld ruler Hades – to weave together several classic Greek myths, including that of Orpheus and Eurydice. The majority of the plot, though, hinges on Zeus’s fall from grace; and the three humans tasked with saving him (and Olympus) before it’s too late. PP\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nFeted as the most expensive TV show ever made, with each episode costing Amazon owner (and Tolkien superfan) Jeff Bezos an estimated £49 m, the first series of this Lord of the Rings prequel looked terrific, but the characters and action sequences often felt flat. With Charlie Vickers’s young baddie Sauron now taking centre stage, here’s hoping this second series feels more magical.\n\nBangers & Cash: Live\n\nU\n\nFans of the amicable Mathewson family will enjoy this live spin-off from their auction show Bangers & Cash, where they allow customers to bid on classic cars and memorabilia at their North Yorkshire HQ.\n\nMichael Mosley: Wonders of the Human Body\n\nChannel 5, 8pm\n\nMichael Mosley’s final series before his death earlier this year continues, as he offers up more hands-on analysis of how to keep your body healthy. Tonight’s episode sees Mosley turn his attention to gene therapies that have the potential to reverse blindness.\n\nWho Do You Think You Are?\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nSpice Girl Melanie Chisholm (better known as either Mel C or Sporty Spice) dives into her family tree in another moving episode. In her hometown of Liverpool, she discovers that her great-grandmother earned her independence outside of the home through work as a local moneylender, and looks into why her ancestors decided to undertake a journey familiar to many Scousers: leave Ireland for Merseyside.\n\nDisappearance of Shannon Matthews\n\nChannel 5, 10pm\n\nThe disappearance of nine-year-old Shannon Matthews in Dewsbury in 2008 shocked Britain – but not as much as the revelation that her mother had made it up. This gripping two-parter talks to family friends, police and journalists about the case.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Shuffle: Tracing the French Connection\n\nBBC Four, 10.40pm\n\nThis 2000 documentary explores the tempestuous production of William Friedkin’s classic thriller. Film critic Mark Kermode dives into the history of the 1960s gang bust that inspired the film, but it’s the interviews – with the late Friedkin and stars Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider – that are the most gripping. The film itself precedes at 9pm.\n\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) ★★★★\n\nFilm4, 12.45pm\n\nThe fabulous mythological creatures of stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen may look a bit clunky to modern eyes, but they’re still awe-inspiring in a primal way that CGI can’t match. Kerwin Mathews plays our hero, Sinbad, forced to battle the Cyclops, a dragon and a skeleton swordsman to rescue his magic lamp (and lover). All set to a Bernard Herrmann score. They don’t make them like this any more.\n\nThe French Connection (1971) ★★★★★\n\nBBC Four, 9pm\n\nThis gritty thriller set the template for countless hard-bitten crime films of the 1970s and beyond. Gene Hackman is superb as “Popeye” Doyle, a surly copper determined to trap a suave French drug dealer (Fernando Rey) who is smuggling heroin across the Atlantic. The white-knuckle car chase, in which Popeye tails an elevated train, is top notch. It scooped five Oscars. Also on Monday on BBC Two at 9pm.\n\nFilm of the Week: The Commandant’s Shadow (2024) ★★★★★\n\nSky Documentaries, 9pm\n\nThose who have watched British director Jonathan Glazer’s extraordinary Oscar-winner The Zone of Interest will feel a jolt of familiarity at this chilling documentary. The Commandant’s Shadow follows Hans-Jürgen Höss, the now elderly son of the Nazi Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss (who was executed in 1947), as he returns to his tranquil childhood home in Poland, which was located next door to the death camp. Similar to Glazer’s powerfully moralistic drama, which posed questions about whether humanity would ever commit such atrocities again – in the present or future – this documentary, made by film-maker Daniela Volker, wonders whether the Höss family, like many other Germans, simply mastered how to ignore what was going on around them. “I had a really lovely and idyllic childhood in Auschwitz,” says Höss at the beginning. Despite this, we’re shown the impact his childhood (and parents) had on his relationship with his own son, Kai, while a meeting with the London-based Holocaust survivor Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who calls their healing encounter “beautiful”, makes for immensely moving and inspirational viewing.\n\nThe Spy Who Dumped Me (2018) ★★★\n\nFilm4, 11.05pm\n\nProving that “spy spoof” is every bit as safe a bet for film-makers as “spy drama”, Susanna Fogel’s amiable send-up sees Mila Kunis’s everywoman forced into an international conspiracy when her boyfriend (Justin Theroux) dumps her – and turns out to be a CIA agent. It’s about as subtle as the Europop bangers that soundtrack it, but for a switch-your-brain-off 90 minutes it’s more than adequate.\n\nFriday 30 August\n\nBeethoven’s Ninth Unwrapped\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nThe 200th anniversary of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony was celebrated in a stunning Prom last week. It’s a beast of a piece – remarkably composed when Beethoven had lost his hearing – and even fairweather fans of classical music will recognise the fourth movement’s Ode to Joy, adopted by the EU as its official anthem. The work has a British connection: although it was first performed in Vienna in May 1824, it was commissioned by the Philharmonic Society of London.\n\nWhat sets this special recital apart is that it is performed by the Aurora Orchestra, under British conductor Nicholas Collon; the orchestra describes itself as “an innovative and boundary-breaking ensemble”, as it performs music from memory, without sheet music or stands. Soloists Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha, Marta Fontanals-Simmons, Brenden Gunnell and Christopher Purves are joined by the combined forces of the BBC Singers and the National Youth Choir of Great Britain to form the chorus for the final movement. Actor Rhiannon May and actor/BSL interpreter Thomas Simper also take part in the concert which is introduced by musician and presenter Linton Stephens. VL\n\nK-Pop Idols\n\nApple TV+\n\nHot on the heels of BBC One’s reality show Made in Korea: The K-Pop Experience comes this six-part docu-series that goes behind the scenes of the billion-dollar industry and meets some of its most in-demand performers, including Jessi, Cravity and Blackswan.\n\nOur Lives: The Seal Whisperer\n\nBBC One, 7.30pm; NI, 8.30pm; Wales, 8pm\n\nNorthumberland GP Ben Burville spends most of his spare time bobbing beneath the waves with grey seals. This charming one-off, filmed over six months, shows how he has formed a special bond with the marine mammals – and captured never-seen-before seal behaviour, including one taking a nap underwater.\n\nRescue 999: Seconds to Save a Life\n\nChannel 5, 8pm\n\nMore episodes from the busy – and sometimes dangerous – lives of emergency crews. Tonight’s stories include an air ambulance team called to the aid of an injured motorcyclist in Cambridgeshire and a tricky evacuation by the Edale Mountain Rescue team, who have to carry a hurt walker on a stretcher along a narrow, rocky path.\n\nGardeners’ World\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nMore from Monty Don’s garden as he prepares for next year by getting some daffodils in the ground and offers useful advice on how best to deal with bindweed. Elsewhere, Frances Tophill visits pioneering horticulturist Josh Sparkes at his experimental plot in Devon to discuss the topic of sustainable food production.\n\nTerror at 30,000 Feet\n\nChannel 5, 9pm\n\nMore airborne terror, this time for real, as the series concludes with a description of the 1989 Kegworth disaster, in which 47 people were killed. The incident occurred after flames were seen coming from one of the plane’s engines on a flight from Heathrow to Belfast. The events of the crash – which eventually led to a change in pilot training – are told through archive, reconstructions and interviews with experts and passengers.\n\nHostage\n\nMore4, 9pm\n\nThe tense Swedish thriller set on a hijacked plane continues as Erik (Adam Lundgren) and Osman (Peshang Rad) try to take action without alarming their fellow passengers. On the ground, meanwhile, the investigation into the hijackers takes a bizarre turn.\n\nThe Deliverance (2024)\n\nNetflix\n\nInspired by the Ammons haunting case that gripped the US in 2011 – in Gary, Indiana, a mother and her three children claimed their house was haunted by malevolent beings – Lee Daniels’s supernatural horror is a must-watch for any fans of The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity. Andra Day plays the haunted, troubled mother whose home (and young children) become possessed by demons. Glenn Close and Caleb McLaughlin also star.\n\nSalome (1953) ★★★\n\nTalking Pictures TV, 4.25pm\n\nWilliam Diertle’s Biblical drama might seem outdated today, but Rita Hayworth’s lead turn remains a delight. Hayworth plays the rebel daughter of King Herod (Charles Laughton), who gets cast out of Galilee after an affair and struggles to regain her father’s favour; as well as avoiding her jealous mother’s (Judith Anderson) wicked machinations. George Duning wrote the terrific musical score.\n\nMadame Web (2024) ★★\n\nSky Cinema Premiere, 8pm\n\nNever has the idiom “all publicity is good publicity” proven as true as with Madame Web. Dakota Johnson’s Spider-Man spin-off was derided by critics and social media users, yet still lured people into cinemas. Johnson’s protagonist, who can see into the future after being bitten by a magical spider while in utero (yes, really), is tasked with protecting three dreary but super-powered teens (Sydney Sweeney among them).\n\nBroken (2012) ★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 12.05am\n\nTheatre director Rufus Norris’s film debut is set in a modest suburban cul-de-sac with three adjacent houses which must bear the burden of representing broken Britain. Tim Roth is on fine form as a crumpled solicitor, and his daughter Skunk (Eloise Laurence) is a cheerful beacon of goodness in an otherwise downbeat film. Their scenes together are beautifully played. Cillian Murphy and Rory Kinnear also star.\n\nTelevision previewers\n\nStephen Kelly (SK), Veronica Lee (VL), Gerard O’Donovan (GO), Poppie Platt (PP) and Gabriel Tate (GT)"
