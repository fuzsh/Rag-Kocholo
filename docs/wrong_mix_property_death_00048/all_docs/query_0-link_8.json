        "text": "In 1945, an improbable relationship between the fallen Reichsmarschall, Hermann Goering, and ambitious US Army physician, Douglas Kelley, becomes a hazardous quest into the nature of evil, amid the devastation of Europe at the end of World War II.\n\nThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist explores the unusual relationship that took shape in a small prison cell in a bombed-out city in 1945. The cell held two men: Hermann Goering, the former Reichsmarschall and flamboyant commander of the German luftwaffe who was the most prominent leader standing of the Nazi regime's top leaders after World War II, and a young psychiatrist from the mountain of Truckee, California, with a compulsive desire to investigate the nature of evil. The psychiatrist, Douglas M. Kelley, M.D., struggled to understand the workings of Goering's mind as part of his investigation of the psychological origins of evil. It was Major Kelley's assignment to assess the mental fitness of Goering and twenty-one other members of the Nazi leadership who awaited trial in Nuremberg during the last half of 1945. They would face a historic international tribunal judging them on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. But Kelley, following a personal agenda that he concealed from his American military superiors, wanted to know more than simply whether the defendants met the legal standards of sanity. He hoped to identify the exact ways in which the minds of the Nazis differed from everyone else's, and he sought to find the precise psychiatric defects that made the prisoners commit evil acts. Hermann Goering, who had joined forces with Adolf Hitler at the creation of the Nazi Party twenty-five years earlier and had risen to the highest ranks of the Third Reich, was the most fascinating target of the psychiatrist's scientific quest."
