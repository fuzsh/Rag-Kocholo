        "text": "Hitler made the “Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service” it was the first law to exclude Jews from state service. “The Anti-Semitic laws were issued throughout all levels of government, making good on the Nazis’ pledge to persecute Jews if the party came to power”. The law also limited the amount of Jewish kids in a school and limited Jews working in medical professions. People were also called Jews if they had grandparents that were Jewish.\n\nThe Nuremberg Laws didn't have a big impact on the Germans unlike it did on the Jews. The only one law that affected some Germans was \"Jews and Germans were not allowed to marry.\" Forbidden love. Apart from that it had nothing to do with Germans, so a German would've thought that these laws were fair and necessary because they were told, brainwashed, into thinking that Jews were monsters, they were the reason Germany is not the glorious country it once was. as long as\n\nOne event that encouraged Anti-Semitism and increased tensions leading up to Kristallnacht and beyond was the announcement of the Nuremberg Laws in September of 1935. This set of laws created by the Nazi party made sharp distinctions between the rights and privileges of Germans and Jews (Sigward 291). This redefined citizenship in the Third Reich and laid the groundwork for a racial state. For example, the Reich of Citizenship Law stripped Jews of their citizenship, claiming they didn’t have “German blood” (Sigward 291). Those of Jewish descent were denied the right to vote and the ability to obtain a valid passport or visa to leave the country. This law completely dehumanized Jews living in Germany and made them stateless, which caused those of the Aryan race or pure German descent to feel superior. In the Nuremburg Laws, Article 5 of the First Regulation to the Reich Citizenship Law defined a Jew as a descendant of three or more Jewish grandparents or two Jewish parents (Sigward 293). These laws lead to the Jews being persecuted for who they were, rather than the faith they believed during previous years. As a result of these laws being carried out, German nationalism and Anti-Semitism across the Reich increased drastically .\n\nAryan were told not to shop in Jewish shops and Jews could not shop in Aryan-owned shops. In 1935 The Nuremberg Race Laws were passed. These stated that Jews could not go to public swimming pools, theaters, schools, etc. In addition Jews were forced to sew a Star-Of-David on their clothes to identify them as Jews. At this point in time, Jews could do very little. Some were arrested just for taking a walk outside.\n\nThe main goal of the Nazis pertaining to the European Jews was that of total extermination. At the yearly party rally held in Nuremberg in 1935, the Nazis announced new laws which regulated a large number of the racial speculations common in Nazi philosophy. Two distinct laws passed in Nazi Germany in September 1935 are referred to on a whole as the Nuremberg Laws: the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for the Assurance of German Blood and German Honor. These laws epitomized large portions of the racial hypotheses supporting Nazi philosophy. They would give the legitimate structure to the orderly abuse of Jews in Germany. The laws rejected German Jews from Reich citizenship and prohibited them from marrying or having sexual relations with persons of \"German or related blood.\" Ancillary ordinances to the laws disenfranchised Jews and denied them of most political rights.\n\nOn July 14, 1933, Hitler’s Nazi party was declared the only legal political party in Germany. Hitler’s ways of gaining followers, worked well for him in the aspect of getting things done. He quickly created a fascist government and was focused on continually pleasing the people. However as the year went on, Hitler used his power for his own selfish hate against Jews. Unknown to many, Hitler and his Nazi regime instituted many laws and regulations that restricted and excluded Jews from society. These laws were known as Anti-Semetic. In 1936, Hitler paused the enforcement of the Anti-Semetic laws when Germany hosted winter and summer Olympics. Hitler hosted these games in an effort to avoid a negative world view on Germany and to essentially be on everyone’s good side. However soon after the Olympics, Hitler went right back to the persecuting of Jews. It began to escalate very\n\nThis identity as disgusting, impure creatures helped to set them apart from the pure Aryan race in society. This set up the Aryan race as superior and the Jewish race as inferior. This was reinforced physically through structural discrimination such as the Nuremberg laws and the forced wearing of the Star of David. The Germans the then found a false concreteness in this distinction that the Jews were evil and were rats' who conspired against them. This allowed them to find concreteness in their belief that the Holocaust was legitimate. However, it was false considering that the Jews had fought in the German army and proved their loyalty to the German state. The Germans' perception of the Jews' identity allowed them to deny the freedoms of the Jews. They began by denying the Jews' right to be Germans, which opened the door for other denial of freedoms, such as even the right the life. These included the boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933, the Nuremberg\n\nHitler's first plan was to demean the Jews' reputation. The Jews, who in 1933 numbered 500,000 in Germany which was less than one percent of the population ( The Holocaust), were blamed for economic depression and Germany's defeat in World War I. New laws were created that forced Jews to give their civil service jobs, university and law positions, and other aspects of the public life. Jewish businesses were boycotted in April 1933 ( The Holocaust). Also that year, the first concentration camps opened to begin in the destruction of the Jews, and they were expected to wear a symbol to differentiate themselves, a yellow Star of David. In 1935, the Nuremberg Laws took all personal identity from the Jews and defined them by their religion and heritage alone.\n\nAdolf Hitler was appointed German Chancellor on January 30, 1933. His regime brought citizens no guaranteed basic rights. In 1933, the first Nazi concentration camps were built. The initial camps imprisoned political opponents, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, gypsies, and others classified as dangerous. During Hitler’s first six years, German Jews had more than 400 decrees and regulations. The first major law against the Jews was, the “Law for Restoration of the Professional Civil Service” of April 7, 1933. That law made Jews and “politically unreliable” employees excluded from state service. The laws began to go further by, restricting the numbers of Jews in schools and colleges, and taking business away from Jewish doctors and\n\nThe anti Jewish sentiment was already strong in many parts of Germany and whilst anti-Semitism might not have been in the forefront of everyone’s mind, it was already a conscious part of everyday life. And in early 1935, a second wave of anti-Jewish agitation followed, once again , following pressure from within the lower party activists within the SA and Hitler Youth. This renewed violence, whilst sanctioned by Hitler, once again proved relatively unpopular amongst the German people and Hitler recognised the need to draw this damaging campaign to a swift conclusion. But at the same time, Hitler did not wish to lose face with his party activists, which led to the Nuremberg Laws of September 1935.\n\nBy 1933, the Jewish population in Germany was around 525,000 people which was only one percent of the total German population. During the years to follow, Nazis established an “Aryanization” of Germany. Non- Aryans (non- Germans) were dismissed from civil service, Jewish- owned businesses were liquidated, and Jewish layers and doctors were stripped of their clients. Later in 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were enacted by the Nazi government. The Nuremberg Laws were composed of two new racial laws, the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law to Protect German Blood and Honor. The Nuremberg Laws restricted Jews, it declared that anyone who had three or four Jewish grandparents would be deemed as a Jew, and anyone with two Jewish grandparents would be deemed a Mischlinge (half-breed). The Nuremberg Laws led to Jews becoming targets of wide-spread discrimination and persecution. These laws stripped Jews of their German citizenship and outlawed marriage and sexual intercourse between Jews and non-Jews. They also prohibited Jews from obtaining certain jobs (such as jobs in the government, medical field, and in law). They prohibited Jews from certain entertainment and recreational activities (such as parks, beaches, theaters, sporting events). Under the Nuremberg Laws Jews were also prohibited\n\nIn the tumultuous period leading up to World War II, a series of laws were devised in Nazi Germany that subjected the Jewish people to prohibitory and discriminatory forms of treatment. Although the Jewish people only accounted for 503,000 of the 55 million occupants of the country, Adolf Hitler’s dictatorship preached the incorporation of anti-Semitism into law and practice in order to quell the people he considered to be the enemy of the country.\n\nAfter Hitler comes into power, the laws of Jewish persecution become more often, stricter, and more deadly. The next law that passed was that of the Nuremberg Laws these laws stated that none of the Jews in Germany were allowed to marry Aryans or fly the German flag (The Holocaust Background info center). 1935 ended with another law against the Jews being passed, as did the start of 1936."
