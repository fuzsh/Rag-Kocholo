        "text": "From the producers of Nuremberg, the story of how in just 13 years, Adolf Hitler led a fringe sect with less than a hundred members and outlandish ideas to be the dominant force in German politics.\n\nIt is also about the forgotten players from these early years who played crucial roles in the Nazi Party's rise to power. This new scripted podcast takes listeners into the intrigues, the personalities, the knife-edge decisions which would ultimately lead to forty million dead in the worldâs greatest catastrophe.\n\nStarring Sir Derek Jacobi as President Hindenberg, Tom Mothersdale as Adolf Hitler and Alexander Vlahos as Joseph Goebbels. With Toby Stephens, Nancy Carroll, Laura Donnelly and Juliet Stevenson as the Narrator. Written and directed by Jonathan Myerson. Producer - Nicholas Newton. A Promenade production for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n\nOn 30th September 1946, the Judges announce their verdicts. And the sentences to be imposed â death or imprisonment or freedom. But come the night of the executions, Hermann Goering has one last surprise.\n\nAnd now itâs time for the verdicts: 11 will be hanged, 7 are given prison sentences and 3 are set free. Everyone is surprised by the acquittals and at a hasty press conference, the free men trade autographs for chocolate (but are re-arrested by German authorities as soon as they leave the building). Meanwhile Sergeant Woods, the US Armyâs hangman, is on site, building the gallows. The night comes but Goering has managed to hide one last cyanide capsule to evade the noose. Starring Nicholas Woodeson as Sir Geoffrey Lawrence and featuring Nathan Wiley as Master Sergeant Woods, the US Armyâs executioner.\n\nEmma Schwabenland - NATALIE DORMER\n\nSir Geoffrey Lawrence - NICHOLAS WOODESON\n\nFrancis Biddle - CLIVE WOOD\n\nIona Nikitchenko - HENRY GOODMAN\n\nSir David Maxwell-Fyfe - FORBES MASSON\n\nColonel Burton Andrus - JOSEPH ALESSI\n\nHermann Goering - NIGEL LINDSAY\n\nRudolf Hess - JOSEPH MYDELL\n\nNew York Post Reporter - HARI DHILLON\n\nDaily Express Reporter - ROSIE SHEEHY\n\nSir Norman Birkett and other roles - ANDREW WOODALL\n\nJohn Parker and other roles - NATHAN WILEY\n\nHenri De Vabres and other roles - JONATHAN CULLEN\n\nPastor Gerecke and other roles - ILAN GOODMAN\n\nOtto KranzbÃ¼hler and other roles - MARK EDEL-HUNT\n\nJoachim von Ribbentrop and other roles - JASPER BRITTON\n\nTitles - LEWIS MACLEOD\n\nSound Designer - ADAM WOODHAMS\n\nStudio Manager - MARK SMITH\n\nCasting Director - GINNY SCHILLER\n\nOriginal Score - METAPHOR MUSIC\n\nWriter and Director - JONATHAN MYERSON\n\nProducer - NICHOLAS NEWTON\n\nA Promenade Production for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds\n\nAfter 216 days in the courtroom, the judges must arrive at their verdicts â the debate will be fierce. Outside, some expect all the Nazis to hang, others predict prison or even acquittal. And while they wait, the Accused are allowed visitors for the first time. And maybe the last time.\n\nAs the judges argue, the prisoners are allowed visitors for the first time. Emma Schwabenland, an American translator, is given the job of organising the Visitors Room, and Pastor Gerecke, an American Lutheran, is under-employed tending to their spiritual needs. And upstairs the eight judges (two from each country) debate the appropriate sentences â the Russians want everyone found guilty and hanged, the other judges take a more nuanced view...Starring Natalie Dormer as Emma Schwabenland and featuring Ilan Goodman as Pastor Henry Gerecke.\n\nEmma Schwabenland - NATALIE DORMER\n\nRobert H Jackson - JOSEPH MYDELL\n\nHermann Goering - NIGEL LINDSAY\n\nEmmy Goering - SOPHIA PETTIT\n\nPastor Gerecke - ILAN GOODMAN\n\nSir Geoffrey Lawrence - NICHOLAS WOODESON\n\nIona Nikitchenko - HENRY GOODMAN\n\nRobert Falco - HARI DHILLON\n\nFrancis Biddle - CLIVE WOOD\n\nSir Norman Birkett and other roles - ANDREW WOODALL\n\nHenri De Vabres and other roles - JONATHAN CULLEN\n\nJohn Parker and other roles - NATHAN WILEY\n\nAlbert Speer and other roles - JOSEPH ALESSI\n\nNiklas Frank and other roles - ROSIE SHEEHY\n\nOtto KranzbÃ¼hler and other roles - MARK EDEL-HUNT\n\nJoachim von Ribbentrop and other roles - JASPER BRITTON\n\nTitles - LEWIS MACLEOD\n\nSound Designer - ADAM WOODHAMS\n\nStudio Manager - MARK SMITH\n\nCasting Director - GINNY SCHILLER\n\nOriginal Score - METAPHOR MUSIC\n\nWriter and Director - JONATHAN MYERSON\n\nProducer - NICHOLAS NEWTON\n\nA Promenade Production for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds\n\nAs more evidence emerges of Nazi Crimes â the camps, the slave labour ministry, the euthanasia programme â all Germans must come to terms with their own individual guilt. They can no longer pretend they didnât know.\n\nThe Accused Men employ a range of limp excuses for their behaviour, claiming they knew nothing, that it was all done by Himmler (now conveniently dead), that they had no choice. But the testimony of Hermann Graebe, a German engineer working in occupied Ukraine, who stumbled across a mass shooting, silences the courtroom and brings home to Christa, a German civilian working at the Court, the enormity of the Nazi crimes. (Graebe was later named one of the Righteous Among Nations at the Yad Vashem Memorial). Starring Rosie Sheehy as Christa and featuring Henry Goodman as Hermann Graebe, witness to a mass execution.\n\nMadeleine Jacob - ALEX KINGSTON\n\nChrista - ROSIE SHEEHY\n\nHermann Graebe - HENRY GOODMAN\n\nHerald Tribune Reporter - CLIVE WOOD\n\nDaily Mirror Reporter - ANDREW WOODALL\n\nNew York Post Reporter - HARI DHILLON\n\nSir Geoffrey Lawrence - NICHOLAS WOODESON\n\nJohn Amen - JOSEPH ALESSI\n\nRoman Rudenko - NIGEL LINDSAY\n\nSir David Maxwell-Fyfe - FORBES MASSON\n\nMarie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier - KATE PHILLIPS\n\nRudolf Hoess - JASPER BRITTON\n\nWilhelm Keitel - JONATHAN CULLEN\n\nWalther Funk and other roles - ILAN GOODMAN\n\nFritz Sauckel and other roles - MARK EDEL-HUNT\n\nTitles - LEWIS MACLEOD\n\nSound Designer - ADAM WOODHAMS\n\nStudio Manager - MARK SMITH\n\nCasting Director - GINNY SCHILLER\n\nOriginal Score - METAPHOR MUSIC\n\nWriter and Director - JONATHAN MYERSON\n\nProducer - NICHOLAS NEWTON\n\nA Promenade Production for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds\n\nApril 1946, the trial continues but the German people either donât believe the evidence or just ignore it. Is it because or in spite of the horrific evidence? But they have to start paying attention â only then can the healing begin.\n\nTrial fatigue is setting in: British and American newspapers only want the gruesome stories, and the Germans are doggedly uninterested â itâs either lies or they should just get on and execute them. Even Otto Ohlendorf, who led an SS Einsatzkommando which cold-bloodedly shot 90,000 Jews, talks like an accountant. Starring Alex Kingston as Madeleine Jacob, French foreign correspondent and featuring Jonathan Cullen as Otto Ohlendorf, called to give testimony of his own soldiersâ barbarism.\n\nMadeleine Jacob - ALEX KINGSTON\n\nChrista - ROSIE SHEEHY\n\nDaily Mirror Reporter - ANDREW WOODALL\n\nNew York Post Reporter - HARI DHILLON\n\nHerald Tribune Reporter - CLIVE WOOD\n\nSir David Maxwell-Fyfe - FORBES MASSON\n\nJohn Amen - JOSEPH ALESSI\n\nRoman Rudenko - NIGEL LINDSAY\n\nCharles Dubost - ILAN GOODMAN\n\nBishop of Limburg - NATHAN WILEY\n\nRobert H Jackson - JOSEPH MYDELL\n\nTitles - LEWIS MACLEOD\n\nSound Designer - ADAM WOODHAMS\n\nStudio Manager - MARK SMITH\n\nCasting Director - GINNY SCHILLER\n\nOriginal Score - METAPHOR MUSIC\n\nWriter and Director - JONATHAN MYERSON\n\nProducer - NICHOLAS NEWTON\n\nA Promenade Production for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds\n\nMarch 1946 and itâs time to hear the Defence Case. Goering is first into the witness box but he seems unashamed, proud of what the Nazis achieved. His duel with the prosecutors begins and they have to outwit him, have to find a way to demolish his attempt at martyrdom.\n\nOnce in the witness box, Hermann Goering, unlike the other defendants, doesnât pretend to be ignorant of what went on or claim that his signature was faked. He is proud of what the Nazi Regime achieved for Germany and intends to go down in a blaze of Wagnerian martyrdom. This wrong-foots Jackson during his cross-examination but when Maxwell-Fyfe takes over, he forces Goering to admit to the shabby, gangsterism of the Nazi machine. Starring Nigel Lindsay as Hermann Goering and Forbes Masson as Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe.\n\nGustav Gilbert - ED STOPPARD\n\nRobert H Jackson - JOSEPH MYDELL\n\nHermann Goering - NIGEL LINDSAY\n\nSir Geoffrey Lawrence - NICHOLAS WOODESON\n\nSir David Maxwell-Fyfe - FORBES MASSON\n\nJulius Streicher - HENRY GOODMAN\n\nCourt Marshall - JASPER BRITTON\n\nTitles - LEWIS MACLEOD\n\nSound Designer - ADAM WOODHAMS\n\nStudio Manager - MARK SMITH\n\nCasting Director - GINNY SCHILLER\n\nOriginal Score - METAPHOR MUSIC\n\nWriter and Director - JONATHAN MYERSON\n\nProducer - NICHOLAS NEWTON\n\nA Promenade Production for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds"
