        "text": "Hermann Goering: An Assessment\n\nHermann Goering: An Assessment\n\nBy Jan B. Young\n\nHermann Goering: An Assessment\n\nBy Jan B. Young\n\nCopyright © 2019 by Jan B Young\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nISBN 978-0-359-69873-8\n\nCover photo is number LC-US62-31652 provided by the Library of Congress\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nEarly Life – 1893 to 1923\n\nThe Nazi Era – 1923 to 1940\n\nHis Interests\n\nHis Downfall - 1940 to 1945\n\nAssessment\n\nBibliography\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt occurs to me that at age seventy-five, I have adult and near-adult grandchildren to whom World War II is essentially as remote as is the Civil War to me. While I’m too young to have fought and even too young to remember any part of the war directly, I clearly remember its consequences and the conversations of my elders as they adjusted their lives to peacetime. Those memories and the atmosphere that surrounded World War II is an important part of history and I find myself hoping that my grandchildren will come to understand and appreciate it. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it[1].\n\nWorld War II was filled to overflowing with people with strong and unique personalities: Churchill, Stalin, Mussolini, Roosevelt, Hitler and many more. Everyone who partook in the war in any kind of leadership role has been exhaustively examined and biographed in great detail. Thousands of books record the war and the history, actions and consequences of the main players. I doubt that a lifetime would suffice to read everything that has been written but the more one reads, the more one discovers the nature of the people involved and the more fascinating the study becomes.\n\nHermann Wilhelm Goering died four days after my third birthday and four thousand miles from where I was living at the time. I thus never met him and this book has been written by researching his paper trail. But even then it has been a wild ride and one well worth my time. On the pages that follow, I attempt to distill what I learned about this intriguing man into a reasonably brief and coherent summary, partly to satisfy my own curiosity but partly also to make it available to my grandchildren and to others of their generation.\n\nIt is important, while we study Hermann Goering, that we not lose sight of the essentially evil nature of the Nazi Party and the Nazi people. There are apologists out there and if we get caught up in their excuses and short-sighted reasoning, we can find ourselves shedding a tear for the poor, misunder­stood people who were dragged unwillingly and unknowingly into the arms of their devilish Nazi friends. Don’t you believe it! These people, Hermann Goering included, were all power-grabbing, selfish, maniacal and just plain evil people. Even though their stew may have contained bits of sweet meat, it was still poison and we need to remember that.\n\nThis book includes only a summary of Goering’s life. Those interested in more detail are referred to any of several excellent biographies:\n\nEwan Butler and Gordon Young wrote two biographies of Goering, Marshal Without Glory(Hodder & Stoughton, 1951) and The Life and Death of Hermann Goering (Borgo Press, 1990)\n\nWilli Frischauer, The Rise and Fall of Hermann Goering (Riverside Press, 1951)\n\nDavid Irving, Goering, A Biography (William Morrow, 1989)\n\nRoger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel: Goering, (Simon & Schuster 1962)\n\nLeonard Mosley, The Reich Marshall; A Biog-raphy of Hermann Goering (Doubleday, 1974)\n\nIn addition there have been three significant efforts to analyze Hermann Goering from the perspective of the professional psychiatrist/psychologist:\n\nJack El-Hai, The Nazi and the Psychiatrist, (MJF Books, 2013)\n\nLeon Goldensohn, The Nuremberg Interviews, (Knopf, 2004)\n\nG. M. Gilbert, Hermann Goering: Amiable Psychopath, in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology 43, no. 2 (April 1948), p. 211\n\nThese works and others consulted in building this analysis are listed in the bibliography.\n\nAnd, finally, a word about spelling is in order. The surname Göring (as he would have written it in German) can be represented in English as either Goring or Goering. I have adopted the latter spelling because I think it better represents how Herr Goering, himself, almost certainly pronounced it."
