The German Reichstag passed this set of laws on September 15, 1935, initiating a period of legal discrimination against those the German government deemed racially inferior. The Reich Citizenship Law is one of the Nuremburg Laws.",

        "text": "Question\n\nThe German Reichstag was the German Parliament or lawmaking organization. Under the Nuremberg Laws of September 1935, Article 2 outlines three things. What are they?\n\nAnswer\n\na. What constitutes someone as a citizen of the Reich.\n\nb. What form of identification is needed to prove citizenship.\n\nc. What rights are granted to citizens of the Reich.\n\nQuestion\n\nUnder the Nuremberg Laws of September 1935, what does Article 3 do? How does this serve to connect the Nuremberg Laws on Citizenship and the First Supplementary Decree of November 1935?\n\nAnswer\n\nIt gives power to the Reich Minister of the Interior to issue further decrees (or legal orders). The First Supplementary Decree is the first decree issued that follows up on the subject of Reich citizenship.\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat can you infer about the position of the Reich Minister of the Interior?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe position is one of power. Many of the articles include mention of the things the Reich Minister of the Interior can do in support of the law or to get around the law if he so chooses.\n\nQuestion\n\nCompare the attention given to defining a Jewish person to that of a citizen of the Reich. What can you infer from this?\n\nAnswer\n\nGreat pain is taken to outline the various ways a person could be considered a Jewish person. It covers ancestry, religious affiliation, marriage, having children, even extra marital affairs. On the other hand, the guidelines for citizens of the Reich are elatively straightforward. The ways in which these guidelines differ point to the great pains that were taken to identify and characterize Jewish people."
