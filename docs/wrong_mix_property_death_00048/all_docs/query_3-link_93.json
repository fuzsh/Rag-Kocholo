        "text": "Famous Trials: The Nuremberg Trials: The Doctors Trial\n\nThe Doctors Trial considered the fate of twenty-three German physicians who either participated in the Nazi program to euthanize persons deemed \"unworthy of life\" (the mentally ill, mentally retarded, or physically disabled) or who conducted experiments on concentration camp prisoners without their consent. The Doctors Trial lasted 140 days. Eighty-five witnesses testified and almost 1,500 documents were introduced. Sixteen of the doctors charged were found guilty. Seven were executed.\n\nHebert Nuremburg Files\n\n\"The photos and documents presented here were selected from the files of Paul M. Hebert, who served as Dean of the Louisiana State University Paul M. Hebert Law Center from 1937 until his death in 1977. Between 1947 and 1948, Hebert was appointed as a judge for the United States Military Tribunals in Nuremberg. As judge for the Tribunals, Hebert most famously presided over the I.G. Farben trial (Case Six), concerning the use of slave labor, and is well-known for his lone dissenting opinion, in which he disagreed with the majorityâ€™s acquittal of fifteen of the twenty-three named defendants who were members of the Vorstand, the principle governing corporate board of I.G. Farben.\"\n\nThe Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group\n\n\"The Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group (IWG) locates, identifies, inventories, and recommends for declassification, currently classified U.S. records relating to Nazi and Japanese Imperial Government war crimes. Once declassified, these records are released to the American public. The group, consisting of high-level representatives from federal agencies and public members, was established by the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act and the Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act. \"\n\nNuremberg Trials (Library of Congress)\n\nContains digital versions of: \" the official proceedings of the trial of the major war criminals (The Blue Series), documentary evidence and guide materials from that trial (The Red Series), the official condensed record of the subsequent trials (The Green Series), and a final report on all the war crimes trials held in Nuremberg, Germany, from 1945 to 1949. \"\n\nPaul H. Gantt Nuremberg Trial Papers\n\n\"Donated to Towson University in 1979, the Paul H. Gantt Nuremberg Trial Papers contain bound volumes of Gantt's working papers and a series of photographs related to the Nuremberg trials which took place in occupied Germany from 1945-1946 and from 1946-1949. The documents include legal briefs with annotations, correspondence files, military reports, and other documentation that reflect Gantt's roles and responsibilities as a member of American military prosecution teams.\""
