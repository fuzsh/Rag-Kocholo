Currently the label for this is \"Tobacco\" with a date picker to select the date. I feel that the label is appropriate for a traditional \"Yes/No\" response. However for this case, I feel a label like \"Last Tobacco Usage\" is more appropriate. The user can then pick the date from the date picker. The flip side with this label is that it makes the users feel that the system is automatically assuming that all members are Tobacco users, which some users could take very negatively.\n\nThe form is a grid-like where we collect a lot of information for multiple members of a family and hence I cant even ask the tobacco usage information upfront. For real estate and other constraints, I have to get this information in the grid like form only.\n\nAny suggestions or recommendations to improve the users experience are welcome"
