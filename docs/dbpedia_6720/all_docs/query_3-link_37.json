        "text": "New York State Tobacco Control Laws\n\nNew York State is a national leader in tobacco control policy. The state's strong and effective laws and regulations protect youth from deadly nicotine addiction by reducing access to tobacco and vaping products; protect New Yorkers from exposure to dangerous secondhand cigarette smoke and e-cigarette aerosol; and hold tobacco and vapor product manufacturers to transparency.\n\nThe New York State Tobacco Control Program works to create communities open to policy, systems, and environmental changes that prevent tobacco and e-cigarette access by youth and eliminate exposure to toxic secondhand smoke and vaping aerosol. In addition to these state laws, many organizations, businesses, municipalities, and counties have adopted binding or nonbinding policies and resolutions that prohibit smoking and e-cigarette use. These policies include prohibiting smoking and e-cigarette use in multiunit housing; banning smoking, tobacco use, and e-cigarette use in additional outdoor spaces; restricting the number and location of stores that sell tobacco and e-cigarettes; prohibiting the acceptance of tobacco company funds or services; and working to reduce the impact of adolescent exposure to smoking in movies and on the internet.\n\nFor more information on tobacco control policy solutions, visit Commercial Tobacco Control – Countering the Tobacco Epidemic.\n\nThe Clean Indoor Air Act\n\nEnacted in 1989 and last amended in 2022, Public Health Law, Article 13-E, known as the Clean Indoor Air Act, prohibits the smoking of tobacco products and the use of vapor products in nearly all indoor and certain outdoor public areas and workplaces. Municipalities and counties may enact local laws that are stronger than state law. For comprehensive information on the Act, visit Clean Indoor Air Act.\n\nThe Clean Indoor Air Act was amended in 2021 to include prohibiting cannabis smoking and vaping in all locations in which smoking and vaping tobacco products are currently prohibited.\n\nThe Adolescent Tobacco Use Prevention Act (ATUPA)\n\nAlmost all adults who smoke cigarettes started in their teens. Public Health Law 13-F, known as the Adolescent Tobacco Use Prevention Act (commonly referred to as ATUPA), regulates the sale of tobacco and vaping products to restrict their access by youth and young adults. ATUPA violations can result in civil penalties or retailer registration suspension or revocation. Recent amendments:\n\nBan the Sale of Flavored Vapor Products\n\nAs of May 2020, Public Health Law Article 13-F Section 1399-MM-1 prohibits the sale of flavored vapor products that do not have an FDA marketing order. This includes menthol-flavored products and allows only tobacco-flavored vaping products to be sold.\n\nEnd Price Discounts on Tobacco and Vapor Products\n\nEffective July 1, 2020, Public Health Law Article 13-F Section 1399-BB ends marketing schemes to lower the price of tobacco and vapor products for consumers. Retailers are prohibited from accepting or honoring discounts, including the use of coupons or multipack price promotions.\n\nEnd the Sales of Tobacco and Vapor Products in Pharmacies\n\nAs of May 2020, Public Health Law Article 13-F Section 1399-MM-2, pharmacies or retail establishments that contain a pharmacy may no longer sell tobacco and vapor products.\n\nBan the Exterior Display of Tobacco and Vapor Product Ads Near Schools\n\nAs of July 1, 2020, Public Health Law Article 13-F Section 1399-DD-1 restricts the public display of tobacco and vaping product advertisements and the display of smoking paraphernalia within 500 feet of a school in New York City and within 1,500 feet of a school in the rest of the state.\n\nStop the Shipment and Delivery of Cigarettes and Vapor Products to Private Residents\n\nIn 2002, Public Health Law Article 13-F Section 1399-LL made it illegal for common or contract carriers such as FedEx®, UPS, and DHL to ship cigarettes to New York addresses, except to an address licensed to sell cigarettes. In 2020, the law was amended to restrict the shipment of vapor products to only registered vapor product dealers, export warehouse owners, or agents of the state or federal government in accordance with official duties. This amendment ends the shipment of online orders of vapor products to individual consumers, a primary way underage youth purchased vaping products. The national Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (commonly called the PACT Act) of 2009 prohibits the delivery of cigarettes, vapes and e-cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco through the U.S. Postal Service. These state and federal laws work together to curtail the sale of cigarettes, other tobacco products, and e-cigarettes over the internet and require internet sellers to affix tax stamps and pay all federal, state, local or Tribal tobacco taxes.\n\nIncrease Retailer Penalties for Tobacco Sales Violations\n\nAs of July 2020, an amendment to Public Health Law Article 13-F Section 1399-EE increases the penalties for illegally selling tobacco and vaping products to underage purchasers and other Adolescent Tobacco Use Prevention Act violations. Penalties include increased monetary fines and registration suspensions and revocations.\n\nRaise the Minimum Legal Sale Age to Purchase Tobacco and Vapor Products\n\nArticle 13-F Section 1399-CC of the Public Health Law prohibited the sale of tobacco and vapor products and smoking paraphernalia to people under the age of 21. Retailers cannot sell cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, powdered tobacco, shisha or other tobacco products, herbal cigarettes, liquid nicotine, electronic cigarettes, rolling papers, or smoking paraphernalia to people under 21 years of age. Penalties for illegal sales to minors include fines, loss of license to sell lottery tickets, and loss of registration to sell tobacco and vapor products. Every registered tobacco retailer is assessed annually for compliance with this law. The 2017-2018 compliance rate was 94%.\n\nTobacco and vapor product dealers: For more information, visit Signage and Guidance for Tobacco and Vapor Product Businesses.\n\nLaws That Regulate the Sale of Tobacco and Vapor Products\n\nKeep Taxes on Tobacco and Vapor Products High\n\nAs of September 1, 2023, New York State has the highest state cigarette tax in the country. The cigarette excise tax increased by $1.00 to $5.35 per pack of 20 cigarettes or little cigars. The tax on moist snuff is $2.00 per ounce, and the tax on cigars and other tobacco products is 75% of wholesale value. Vapor products, with or without nicotine, are taxed at 20% of the retail price. The tax is paid for by the person buying the product and collected by vapor products retailers, who are responsible for collecting the tax and paying and reporting it to the Department of Taxation and Finance. For more information on the vapor product supplemental sales tax, see Vapor Products.\n\nLocalities may levy additional tobacco taxes with the approval of the state legislature. New York City imposes a local tax of $1.50 per pack, which, in September 2023, brought the combined state and local tax to $6.85. In addition, New York City Local Law 145 requires retailers to sell cigarettes for a minimum retail price of $13.00 per pack.\n\nRequire Registration of Tobacco and Vapor Product Retailers and Wholesalers\n\nEvery retail dealer of cigarettes, other commercial tobacco products, and vapor products and every owner or operator of vending machines that sell cigarettes or tobacco products in New York State must register with the Department of Taxation and Finance. In 2023, 16,759 tobacco and vapor product retailers were registered with the Department of Taxation and Finance. Cigarette wholesalers, retailers and distributors also must be licensed. Municipalities may establish their own licensing requirements.\n\nBeginning December 1, 2019, every person who intends to sell vapor products in New York State must apply for and receive a certificate of registration from the Department of Taxation and Finance before selling them. Registration certificates are valid for one year and must be displayed. The law gives the State Health Department enforcement oversight to ensure compliance with all tobacco and e-cigarette laws, including adhering to the minimum legal sale age, display of approved signage, restricting the sale of flavored vaping products other than tobacco-flavored, and storing tobacco and vapor products out of consumers' reach. See New York State Tax Law, Article 28-C to learn more.\n\nProhibit Cigarette Sales Below Cost\n\nEnacted in 1985, the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act, Tax Law, Article 20-A, prohibits the sale of cigarettes below cost and makes it illegal for retailers to intentionally avoid the collection or payment of taxes. The law includes fines and penalties for violations.\n\nAuthorize the Health Commissioner to Regulate Harmful Carrier Oils in Vapor Products\n\nIn 2019, a national outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) occurred. Laboratory data showed that vitamin E acetate, an additive in some vaping products, was strongly linked to this outbreak. To increase oversight of vapor products through the distribution chain, Public Health Law Article 13-E Section 1399-MM-3 authorizes the State Health Commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations governing the sale and distribution of carrier oils that are suspected of causing acute illness and have been identified as a chemical of concern by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRequire Vapor Product Manufacturers to Disclose Product Ingredients\n\nPublic Health Law Article 17 requires manufacturers of vapor products distributed, sold, or offered for sale in New York State, both retail or wholesale, to disclose the ingredients of vapor products, toxic metals in heating elements, and byproducts of the aerosol produced by the normal use of vaping products to the State Health Commissioner for public record and post these on their websites.\n\nLaws to Prevent E-liquid- and Cigarette Smoking-related Injuries and Deaths\n\nLiquid Nicotine (E-liquid) Packaging Requirement\n\nAll liquid nicotine (e-liquid) must be packaged in a child-resistant bottle designed to prevent accidental exposure. Violators are subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000. See General Business Law, Article 26, Section 399-GG to read the law.\n\nCigarette Fire Safety Standards"
