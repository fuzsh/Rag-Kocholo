        "text": "Description\n\nOn January 11, 1964, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a detailed report concluding that cigarette smoking was a health hazard warranting “appropriate remedial action.” In June 1964, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that beginning January 1, 1965, the tobacco industry would be required to place health warning labels on their cigarette packages and that beginning July 1, 1965, similar health warnings would be required in their advertisements. The tobacco industry fought back with an aggressive lobbying effort on Capitol Hill and a public relations campaign that included brochures such as \"Tobacco—a vital U.S. Industry,\" stressing the economic importance of the industry and its contributions to federal revenues.\n\nRights\n\nMaterials on this site are provided for educational use under Fair Use outlined by U.S. Copyright law.
