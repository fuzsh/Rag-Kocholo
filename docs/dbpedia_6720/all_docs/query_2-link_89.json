        "text": "Tobacco products are one of the most heavily marketed consumer products in the U.S. In 2022, the latest year for which information is available, the five largest cigarette manufacturers spent a total of $8.01 billion—or close to $22 million dollars a day—to promote and advertise their products.1 The five largest smokeless tobacco manufacturers spent $572.7 million on advertising and promotion in 2022.1 The 2021 Federal Trade Commission report (FTC) on e-cigarettes and advertising found that $859.4 million was spent on e-cigarette advertising and promotion in 2021 up from $768.8 million in 2020. 2\n\nOnly a few states are funding their tobacco control programs at the levels currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), meaning that tobacco company marketing efforts are largely occurring without effective, well-funded state tobacco control programs to respond."
