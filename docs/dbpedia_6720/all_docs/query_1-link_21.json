The United States District Court for the District of Columbia recently issued an order vacating the health warning requirements for cigars and pipe tobacco set forth in 21 CFR §§ 1143.3 and 1143.5 and remanding the Final Deeming Rule’s warning requirements for cigars and pipe tobacco back to the Agency. See Order, Cigar Ass’n of Am. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., No. 1:16-cv-01460 (D.D.C. September 11, 2020). Although the requirement has been vacated, cigar and pipe tobacco firms may choose to voluntarily comply with these health warning provisions. FDA will continue to enforce the other requirements it was already enforcing for cigars and pipe tobacco under the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, such as not selling these products to individuals under 21 years of age or marketing them as modified risk tobacco products without an FDA order.\n\n3. The above timeframes are for FDA response after review of a marketing application. If there are deficiencies preventing authorization, it may take longer. FDA encourages applicants to review information needed to support issuance of a marketing order prior to submission.\n\n4. FDA encourages people to meet with FDA early in their process of developing an MRTP to discuss application submission and investigational requirements and recommendations.\n\n5. The CTP Office of Science encourages early consultation by individuals intending to submit electronically, especially those making an electronic submission for the first time as this can facilitate a smooth process. This can be part of a pre-application meeting requested under Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Meetings with Industry and Investigators on the Research and Development of Tobacco Products. Individuals are expected to consult with the intended agency receiving unit for details on how (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, technical protocols) and whether to proceed with the eSubmission (Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures [21 CFR section 11.2(b)(2)]."
