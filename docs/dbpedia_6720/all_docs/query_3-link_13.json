Study aims are: (1) to evaluate the effects of the reduction of nicotine content in cigarettes and e-cigarettes on total cigarettes smoked per day; (2) to assess the effects of cigarette and e-cigarette nicotine reduction on cigarette dependence, smoke exposure (carbon monoxide), and carcinogen exposure (NNAL); and (3) to examine effects of cigarette and e-cigarette nicotine reduction on days of smoking abstinence. Researchers will investigate these aims in a two-site, 12-week, double-blind randomized controlled trial involving four conditions based on two cigarette levels (normal nicotine vs very low nicotine) and two e-cigarette levels (high nicotine vs low nicotine); a total of 308 dual users ages 21 and older will participate. Outcome measures will include cigarettes smoked per day, cigarette dependence, and toxicant exposure. Findings may provide new information regarding the separate and combined effects of cigarette and e-cigarette nicotine reduction policies.\n\nElias Klemperer Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01DA059562-01\n\nInstitution: University of Vermont and State Agricultural College 12/14/2023\n\nCardiopulmonary Toxicity of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems\n\nThis study will evaluate the cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity of e-cigarette aerosols over different operating conditions and use patterns. Study aims are: (1) to assess the cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity of exposure to e-liquid aerosols by identifying urine metabolites of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and testing heart and lung functionality in adult mice; (2) to identify the cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity of e-cigarettes, and (3) to evaluate the effects of different use patterns (dual use with cigarettes, product switching) on VOC exposure and the cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity of e-cigarettes. To achieve Aim 1, researchers will identify urine metabolites of VOCs and test heart and lung functionality in adult mice that have been exposed to aerosols. To achieve Aim 2, researchers will evaluate the toxicity profile of the most commonly used pod and pod-mod devices under different operating conditions and relate changes in cardiovascular and pulmonary function with biomarkers of VOC exposure in mice. To achieve Aim 3, researchers will determine how exposure to combustible cigarettes affects both VOC exposure and the cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity of current pod- and pod-mod devices in mice. Findings may inform future regulatory actions related to e-cigarettes.\n\nDaniel J. Conklin, Ph.D. Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health - Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01HL171763-01\n\nInstitution: University of Louisville 12/01/2023\n\nIdentifying and Examining the Effects of Source and Presentation on Responses to Electronic Cigarette Public Education Messages in Young Adult Vapers and Non-vapers\n\nEffective e-cigarette public health communication is critical given e-cigarettes’ growth in popularity, particularly among young adults. This study will investigate whether a trusted source and a message presentation type can increase young adult (ages 18-24) acceptance of e-cigarette education messages and result in behavioral changes. Study aims are: (1) to identify optimal message source (expert, peer) and presentation (one-sided, e.g., “Vaping can damage your health” vs. two-sided, e.g., “Vaping is fun, but it can damage your health”) among young adult current vapers and susceptible non-vapers using crowdsourcing (self-report measures on message acceptance, source trust, message reactance, harm perceptions) with 800 participants and psychophysiology (eye tracking, heart rate, skin conductance) with 112 participants, and (2) to examine the behavioral effects of optimal message source and presentation in a randomized trial using a text messaging intervention with 168 participants. Results may inform the development of e-cigarette public health communication campaigns targeted toward young adults.\n\nDonghee Nicole Lee Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1K99CA281094-01A1\n\nInstitution: UMass Chan Medical School 12/01/2023\n\nEffect of Product Characteristics on the Abuse Liability of Nicotine Pouches\n\nThis study will assess the effect of nicotine pouch (NP) nicotine and pH levels on sensory attributes, product appeal, and abuse liability among young adult (ages 21-35) dual users of NPs and e-cigarettes. Study aims are: (1) to evaluate the effects of NP nicotine concentration and pH on subjective product appeal and sensory attributes; (2) to assess the effects of NP nicotine concentration and pH on abuse liability; and (3) to estimate the extent to which sensory attributes change the pH-moderated effect of NP nicotine concentration on product appeal and abuse liability. To achieve Aim 1, researchers will conduct a randomized trial with 72 dual users who will use four NPs that vary by nicotine concentration (low vs. high) and pH (low vs. high); participants will rate the appeal (e.g., liking, use again) and sensory attributes (e.g., smoothness, harshness, irritation) of each NP and select their favorite. To achieve Aim 2, researchers will conduct a second randomized trial with 84 participants who will administer one of four NPs (nicotine: low vs. high; pH: low vs. high); participants will use as many NPs as they wish for 120 minutes. Outcomes assessed will include total amount of mouth time and total number of NPs (indicative of NP reinforcement abuse liability) and subjective effect measures of abuse liability (e.g., drug liking, enjoy nicotine buzz, want more). Using the findings from both trials, researchers will analyze how the effects of NP nicotine concentration and pH on appeal and abuse liability are revealed through sensory attributes. Findings will provide new information about the mechanisms affecting differences in NP appeal and abuse liability across NPs varying in nicotine concentration and pH level.\n\nDae Hee Han Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1K99DA058241-01A1\n\nInstitution: University of Southern California 12/01/2023\n\nA New Generation of Misleading Tobacco Marketing: Assessing the Evolution of Misleading Combustible Tobacco Marketing Features and Detrimental Implications for Vulnerable Youth and Young Adults\n\nThis study will assess the use and effects of a new generation of misleading descriptors and imagery in combustible tobacco marketing, specifically with regard to their implications for youth and young adults (ages 13-25). Study aims are: (1) to assess the use and perceptions of misleading descriptors/imagery in cigarette and cigarillo marketing; (2) to experimentally assess product preferences for cigarette and cigarillo products packaged with misleading descriptors/imagery; and (3) to assess attention to potentially misleading descriptors/imagery in cigarette and cigarillo marketing. To achieve Aim 1, the researcher will conduct six online focus groups (totalling approximately 36-42 participants) to assess attention to and interpretations of misleading marketing features on cigarette and cigarillo ads/packs. To achieve Aim 2, the researcher will conduct a discrete choice experiment in which approximately 1000 participants will complete 12 choice sets, each comparing the preference for and appeal of two product packs (opt-out option included) with manipulated factors including misleading target descriptors, target imagery, and explicit modified risk claims. To achieve Aim 3, the researcher will conduct an eye-tracking study with approximately 65 participants to examine attention to ads and packs using salient descriptors and images (per Aim 1 and 2 results). Findings will provide new information about misleading tobacco marketing.\n\nStefanie Gratale Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1K01CA281062-01A1\n\nInstitution: Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences 09/30/2023\n\nEffect of Nicotine Salts on Leaching of Metals into e-Liquids\n\nThis study will evaluate whether nicotine salt e-liquid formulations, compared to free-base nicotine e-liquids, cause or accelerate the leaching of metals from e-cigarette device components into e-liquids and e-cigarette aerosols. The study will also investigate whether different nicotine salt forms leach metals differently, whether leaching is influenced by the propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin ratio in the e-liquid, and whether effects are different in heated components than in unheated metals. Finally, this study will evaluate effects of nicotine salts upon transfer of metals from e-liquids into aerosols. Researchers will test eight different simulated e-liquid formulations in combination with six different metals commonly found in e-cigarette devices. The simulated e-liquids will include free-base nicotine formulations as well as formulations with three different nicotine salt forms. The resulting samples will be stored for approximately six months. During this time, researchers will periodically measure the concentrations of metals in some e-liquids “as is,” without any further handling; these samples will simulate leaching of metals into e-liquids during product storage prior to first use. For other e-liquids, researchers will periodically measure the dissolved metal concentrations after heating the metal components to temperatures typical of operating e-cigarette devices; these samples will simulate leaching of metals into e-liquids after a consumer has begun using a product. At the end of the six-month period, researchers will measure concentrations of metals in the aerosols of a sample of the e-liquids. This final testing will help determine whether any observed leaching of metals into the e-liquids might translate into increased user exposure to toxic metals. Findings will provide data regarding whether nicotine salt solutions induce or accelerate corrosion of metal components, resulting in higher levels of potentially toxic metals in e-liquids and aerosol emissions.\n\nJonathan Thornburg (CTP Contact: Jason Schaff) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40122D00008\n\nInstitution: Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International 09/29/2023\n\nEvaluating Toxic Interactions of Aldehydes in Complex Mixtures\n\nIn this project, researchers are developing an air-liquid interface aerosol exposure in vitro model to study the potential for toxicological interactions (e.g., synergism, additivity) between aldehydes commonly found in electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) aerosols. These toxicological interactions may result in enhanced toxicity (e.g., genotoxicity, cytotoxicity). The project will use various genotoxicity and cytotoxicity assays to evaluate the occurrence of genotoxicity following exposure to single and mixed aldehydes. Study findings will assist FDA in understanding the occurrence of toxicological interactions between mixtures of HPHCs produced from tobacco products and their effect on the development of toxicity following exposure. These findings will also provide data to model whether these interactions may affect the calculated lifetime cancer and non-cancer risk of tobacco products.\n\nRavi Verma (CTP Contact: Matthew Hartog) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40123C00109\n\nInstitution: Spectral Platforms Inc. 09/25/2023\n\nDoes Tobacco Social Media Marketing Alter Adolescent Risk Perceptions and Use? Longitudinal Data-Adaptive Estimators and Causal Inference to Enhance Understanding\n\nThis study will analyze recent waves of Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data (Waves 4, 4.5 and 5) to examine the impact of online ENDS marketing on ENDS use and evaluate risk perceptions as potential mediators that explain the effects of adolescent marketing exposure on ENDS use. Study aims are: (1) to use longitudinal data to examine the impact of earlier online ENDS marketing exposure; and (2) to identify the degree to which risk perceptions mediate the effects of marketing exposure on adolescent ENDS use. Findings will provide information about the impact on online ENDS marketing that may inform future regulatory activities.\n\nPaul Harrell Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21CA287457-01\n\nInstitution: Eastern Virginia Medical School 09/25/2023\n\nYale Center for the Study of Tobacco Product Use and Addiction (YCSTP) (TCORS 3.0)\n\nThe Yale University TCORS will study how nicotine and flavor additives affect the appeal of and addiction to tobacco products and how these constituents might influence initiation and harm reduction. Specifically, the TCORS will investigate the effects of different forms and concentrations of nicotine (tobacco-derived, synthetic, freebase/salt), constituents that add cooling (menthol, odorless synthetic coolants), and constituents that add sweetness (humectants, sweeteners) delivered via different routes and products (oral, inhaled, intravenous) on initiation, addiction, and harm reduction. Project 1 will examine whether odorless cooling flavors, sweeteners, humectants, and different nicotine stereoisomers impact initiation, nicotine preference, reinforcement, and transitions in use from adolescence to adulthood. Project 2 will evaluate whether thresholds for nicotine reinforcement, discrimination, and subjective reward are altered by nicotine dependence and exposure to sweeteners. Project 3 will examine whether odorless synthetic coolants and synthetic nicotine racemic mixtures alter the appeal and addiction potential of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. Project 4 will examine the impact of potential regulations addressing flavors and nicotine concentration in non-combustible tobacco products (e.g., nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes) on switching from combustible tobacco products. Researchers will build on Yale’s prior TCORS and integrate biological and behavioral testing in animal models with behavioral and pharmacological testing in humans to generate findings that may inform future regulatory activities.\n\nSuchitra Krishnan-Sarin and Stephanie O’Malley Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 2U54DA036151-11\n\nInstitution: Yale University 09/25/2023\n\nAppalachian Tobacco Regulatory Science Team (AppalTRuST) (TCORS 3.0)\n\nThe University of Kentucky TCORS (AppalTRuST) will investigate the impact of FDA regulatory policies (i.e., potential restrictions on flavored and high-nicotine products) in rural communities, a vulnerable and understudied population. Project 1 will measure the factors associated with tobacco use behaviors -- including initiation, progression, dual/poly tobacco use, product switching, and cessation-related behaviors – connected to conventional and novel product use across levels of rurality over time. Project 2 will evaluate how FDA regulations may affect patterns of use of conventional and novel products among young adults across levels of rurality. Project 3 will involve a randomized parallel groups trial using an Experimental Tobacco Marketplace to assess the impact of three proposed tobacco regulations to estimate effects of regulatory policies on use behavior across levels of rurality. These projects will leverage the AppalTRuST Cohort of 2,000 adults (ages 18+) in Appalachian Kentucky to evaluate whether FDA regulatory activities will shift individuals to lower harm products or facilitate tobacco cessation, guided by a definition of rurality that is diverse and heterogeneous.\n\nSeth Himelhoch Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1U54DA058256-01\n\nInstitution: University of Kentucky 09/25/2023\n\nPenn State TCORS: Tobacco Product Composition Effects on Toxicity and Addiction (TCORS 3.0)\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University TCORS will study the toxicity and addiction potential of three diverse tobacco products (e-cigarettes, little cigars, and oral nicotine pouches) by characterizing smoke/aerosol oxidants and their biological effects. Project 1 will involve studies in both laboratory animals and e-cigarette users to evaluate whether inhaled e-cigarette oxidants and their potential for harm are influenced by product design features and whether the biological effects of these oxidants can be measured through biomarkers of both exposure and harm. Project 2 will use epidemiologic data and clinical and laboratory studies to investigate the potential toxicity related to oxidant production in little cigar smokers and the little cigar design features that may affect human exposure. Project 3 will involve a randomized controlled clinical trial that tests whether biomarkers of harm, including those related to oxidative stress, are significantly reduced in smokers who are provided with oral nicotine pouches. Findings may inform regulatory actions to reduce the harm from tobacco products.\n\nJoshua Muscat Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1U54DA058271-01\n\nInstitution: Pennsylvania State University 09/25/2023\n\nAdvancing Tobacco Regulatory Science to Reduce Health Disparities (TCORS 3.0)\n\nThe University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill TCORS will study how population disparities in the use of menthol-flavored products and non-cigarette tobacco products (e.g., little cigars, cigarillos, e-cigarettes) may be reduced through communication campaigns and federal product bans. This TCORS will focus on several populations facing tobacco use disparities, including Black individuals; individuals with lower-socioeconomic status (SES); lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) populations; and youth and young adults. Project 1 will develop a new communication campaign to discourage young adult little cigar and cigarillo use. Project 2 will evaluate whether the impact of a menthol cigarette ban could be amplified by a smoking cessation campaign targeting menthol smokers, including Black and LGB smokers. Project 3 will build a microsimulation model to estimate the public health impact of a federal flavored cigar ban on tobacco use, mortality, and health disparities. Project 4 will test the ability of vaping prevention video ads with promising features to reduce youth and young adult susceptibility to vaping. This research will provide new evidence that may inform FDA regulations and communication campaigns.\n\nKurt M. Ribisl Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1U54DA060049-01\n\nInstitution: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 09/20/2023\n\nCenter for the Assessment of Tobacco Regulations (CAsToR) (TCORS 3.0)\n\nThe University of Michigan TCORS will provide evidence-based and expert-informed modeling of the behavioral and public health impacts of FDA regulatory activities. The TCORS will pursue four projects based on detailed analyses of current and historical tobacco use patterns in the US using established tobacco simulation models. Project 1 will involve comparative modeling of the impact of FDA regulatory actions and novel tobacco products on tobacco use and long-term health outcomes. Project 2 will model the process of nicotine addiction among youth and young adults and potential future consequences. Project 3 will develop tools to assess the impact of flavor restrictions on smoking and vaping for the overall US population and for urban and rural populations. Project 4 will develop models for vulnerable populations and assess the impact of tobacco use and regulations by race/ethnicity, education, and their intersection. Findings will help policy makers gauge regulatory impact on the US population and vulnerable subpopulations.\n\nRafael Meza, David Mendez, and David Levy Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 2U54CA229974-06\n\nInstitution: University of Michigan 09/08/2023\n\nUSC Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS 3.0)\n\nThe University of Southern California TCORS will conduct four projects to determine how non-combustible tobacco products impact adolescent and young adult tobacco product use uptake, escalation, abuse liability, and poly-use patterns across subpopulations and to identify product characteristics and marketing approaches that amplify these effects. Project 1 will determine how availability of different new non-combustible products will impact tobacco product use in US youth from 2024-2028. Project 2 will examine the role of oral nicotine products, e-cigarettes, and other non-combustible tobacco products in use outcomes over time, and the product characteristics and populations driving these outcomes. Project 3 will examine which features of oral nicotine products increase abuse liability and product appeal in young adult e-cigarette users. Project 4 will determine how adolescents and young adults engage with social media depictions of non-combustible tobacco products with varying features and the influence of social media platforms (e.g., TikTok) on use susceptibility. The TCORS will provide evidence on whether certain non-combustible product classes (e.g., nicotine pouches), product types (e.g., products that can be used discreetly), characteristics (e.g., e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches in concept flavors), and marketing strategies (e.g., social media influencers) increase the risk of the initiation and progression of tobacco use, including in key adolescent and young adult subpopulations (e.g., sexual/gender minority).\n\nAdam Leventhal Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 2U54CA180905-11\n\nInstitution: University of Southern California 09/14/2023\n\nThe Ohio State University Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (OSU-TCORS) (TCORS 3.0)\n\nThe Ohio State University Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (OSU-TCORS) will study how three aspects of nicotine – nicotine concentration, nicotine form, and synthetic nicotine (isomers) – in e-cigarettes and oral nicotine pouches are impacting product appeal, addictiveness, use patterns, and toxicity. Project 1 and Project 2 will examine the influence of e-cigarette and oral nicotine pouch nicotine manipulations on product appeal, abuse liability, use, and toxicity. Project 3 will examine the influence of nicotine marketing claims on appeal and product trial of oral nicotine products. Project 4 will examine how young people, including priority populations, respond to both nicotine product marketing and design characteristics in the natural environment. The projects are highly integrated and will inform the use of the Consumer Response Model (a model developed by the tobacco industry to assess subjective user responses to tobacco product design characteristics) as a tool to protect public health.\n\nTheodore Wagener and Peter Shields Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1U54CA287392-01\n\nInstitution: The Ohio State University 09/05/2023\n\nThe Effects of Flavored E-cigarette Sales Bans on Tobacco-Use Behaviors Among Youth and Young Adults\n\nIn 2020, FDA banned prefilled, single-use cartridges containing e-liquids in “non-tobacco” flavors (e.g., fruit, candy); six states (Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and Utah) enacted additional, stricter flavored e-cigarette bans. Using Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data, researchers will investigate how these stricter statewide flavored e-cigarette bans affect e-cigarette and other tobacco product use as well as smoking cessation and reduction and will assess individual behavioral changes between subsequent waves. Study aims are: (1) to assess the impact of statewide bans on flavored e-cigarette sales on e-cigarette use and smoking behaviors among adolescents (ages 12-17), young adults (ages 18-24), and adults (ages 25+); and (2) to examine whether statewide bans on flavored e-cigarette sales undermine the potential benefit to smoking cessation and reduction among adult (ages 18+) cigarette smokers. In an additional exploratory aim, researchers will evaluate changes in biomarkers of exposure and harm associated with flavored e-cigarette bans among adolescents, young adults, and adults with varying tobacco use statuses. Findings will provide relevant data on the positive and negative impact of flavored e-cigarette bans.\n\nMeng-Yun Lin and Rachel Denlinger-Apte Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health - Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21DA059793-01\n\nInstitution: Wake Forest University Health Sciences 09/01/2023\n\nDeveloping Evidence to Inform Regulatory Policy on Nicotine Content in E-Liquids\n\nThis study will assess whether e-cigarette users who use lower nicotine content e-liquids are actually consuming less nicotine compared to those who use higher nicotine content e-liquids and whether low nicotine content e-liquid use reduces exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs). Researchers will monitor 120 pod and pen-style regular e-cigarette users (ages 21 and older) in the community for one week, collecting actual use data, daily salivary cotinine, subject effects and exposure, and health effect biomarkers. Study aims are: (1) To evaluate HPHC exposure using the traditional approach of salivary cotinine (a well-accepted biomarker for nicotine exposure) and other urinary and salivary biomarkers of exposure and adverse health effects; (2) to evaluate HPHC exposure using a new alternative outcome measure -- behavior-based yield -- that incorporates one week of intensive puff-by-puff use data and product-specific emissions, and (3) to add pharmacokinetics (the body’s effect on a drug) to the behavior-based yield model to improve predictive utility by incorporating personalized reaction kinetics, and then use the model to predict the time-course of salivary cotinine during one week of real-world use. Findings will provide new data regarding the relationship between nicotine concentration and nicotine uptake and adverse health effects. This study will assess whether e-cigarette users who use lower nicotine content e-liquids are actually consuming less nicotine compared to those who use higher nicotine content e-liquids and whether low nicotine content e-liquid use reduces exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs). Researchers will monitor 120 pod and pen-style regular e-cigarette users (ages 21 and older) in the community for one week, collecting actual use data, daily salivary cotinine, subject effects and exposure, and health effect biomarkers.

This study has two aims. In Aim 1, researchers will analyze the pooled biomarker/adult interview data to (a) examine between-subject differences in biomarkers of exposure (BOEs) by nicotine concentration level, and (b) test the interaction effects of nicotine levels and e-cigarette products on BOEs from five classes of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (nicotine metabolites, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds) and BOEs of health effects (e.g., oxidative stress) in urine and serum panels. In Aim 2, researchers will use adult interview data to examine associations of ENDS nicotine levels with tobacco use behaviors (e.g., subsequent abstinence from or relapse to cigarette smoking) and nicotine dependence. Findings may inform future regulatory activities related to ENDS products and their nicotine concentration levels.\n\nHongying Dai Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21DA058328-01\n\nInstitution: University of Nebraska Medical Center 08/15/2023\n\nDetermination of a Correlation Between Endotoxin and Glucan Concentration and Microbial Counts in Open e-Liquids\n\nElectronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) e-liquids may contain bacterial and fungal microbes whose proliferation may impact the product’s microbial stability over the product’s shelf life. While endotoxin and glucan have been detected in e-liquids, it is unknown whether the measured concentrations correlate with e-liquid microbial levels. In this study, researchers will develop a method to determine whether endotoxin and glucan persist in an open e-liquid after microbial proliferation ceases or is undetectable. Twenty-four e-liquid formulations (with differences in propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin ratios, nicotine levels, nicotine types, and flavors) will be made in-house by RTI using materials sourced from a major e-liquid manufacturer. The e-liquids will be spiked with gram-negative bacteria and fungi at varying levels. Researchers will then analyze the e-liquids for presence of endotoxin and glucan and determine the minimal colony forming unit (CFU) threshold necessary for endotoxin and glucan detection. They will analyze the e-liquids at multiple timepoints throughout a 24-month stability study to represent the beginning, middle, and end of shelf-life. By evaluating microbial proliferation (or lack thereof), this study will determine whether endotoxin or glucan presence is independent of microbial detection throughout an e-liquid’s shelf-life.\n\nJean Kim and Karmann Riter (CTP Contact: Nikhil Kumar) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40122D00008\n\nInstitution: Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International 08/15/2023\n\nCreative Concept Testing Designed to Prevent Youth and Young Adult Use of ENDS (Wave 4)\n\nThis research study will investigate how youth (ages 13-17) and young adults (ages 18-20) who are primarily at risk of initiating (susceptible) e-cigarette use or who have experimented with e-cigarettes react to various “The Real Cost” public education campaign creative concepts. Specifically, up to 42 discussion groups with up to 6 participants each will focus on comprehension, relevance, relatability, believability, and overall reactions to presented creative concepts and statements. Findings will help identify the most promising creative concepts and statements for further development and indicate areas for refinement.\n\nKristen Holtz (CTP Contact: Emily Peterson) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40121D00016\n\nInstitution: KDH Research & Communication 08/14/2023\n\nDeveloping Measures for Evaluating Short and Long-term Outcomes of Public Education Activities on Tobacco Use Prevention and Reduction\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop measures (e.g., scales, indices, stand-alone questions) that will be used in CTP’s public education campaign research and evaluation studies. Specific measures will address but are not limited to the following topics: (1) campaign advertisement awareness, (2) campaign advertisement engagement, (3) campaign-targeted psychosocial constructs, and (4) tobacco product user groups. Measures will be developed based on information gathered from literature reviews, subject matter experts (SMEs), and cognitive interviews. A total of four quantitative studies will be conducted within three years to assess the validity and reliability of the new measures; the sample size for each study will range from 600 to 900 youth ages 13-17.

The study will be performed on six different tobacco products in a variety of container closure systems. Testing will be conducted at three time points over the course of a 12-month period. Findings will present new data regarding the baseline water activity of different tobacco products, how it changes over time, and how different microbial parameters are influenced by any changes in water activity which will further inform regulatory activities related to these tobacco products.\n\nJean Kim and Karmann Riter (CTP Contact: Brian Della Fera) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40122D00008\n\nInstitution: Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International 08/02/2023\n\nDeveloping a New Smoking Regimen for Generating and Quantitating B[a]P, TNCO, and TNSA from Pipe Mainstream Smoke\n\nAlthough tobacco pipes are less popular than cigarettes, smokers of tobacco pipes may have similar health risks (e.g., oral cancer, esophageal cancer) as those who smoke cigarettes. There are few published studies on HPHCs generated from tobacco pipes. This study will develop reproducible smoking regimens that can be used to generate and evaluate HPHCs yields from the mainstream smoke of pipe tobacco. This study has three objectives: (1) to identify key smoking parameters (e.g., puff duration, puff volume, interpuff interval) for establishing smoking regimens under non-intense and intense smoking conditions for tobacco pipes; (2) to evaluate tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (TNCO), N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) yields in mainstream smoke from commercial pipe tobacco using a smoking machine; and (3) to evaluate nicotine, NNN, and NNK levels in the tobacco filler to determine transfer efficiency. The smoking regimens established by this study will provide a thorough representation of human smoking patterns and potential exposure to chemical constituents generated in mainstream pipe smoke.\n\nTannya Agarwal (CTP Contact: Stephanie Daniels) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40122D00006\n\nInstitution: Labstat International ULC 07/28/2023\n\nThe Abuse Liability, Topography and Toxicology of Ice Flavors and Non-menthol Synthetic Cooling Agents in E-cigarette Products\n\nThe synthetic cooling agents WS-3 and WS-23, which impart a cooling sensation without a mint flavor, are used in some e-cigarettes and are marketed with “ice” in the flavor name (e.g., “watermelon ice”). Unlike menthol, synthetic cooling agents can be added at very high concentrations (>5% by weight) to e-liquids, allowing users to get extreme cooling/anesthetic properties during e-cigarette use without the eyewatering and harshness associated with menthol. This study will investigate the effects of synthetic cooling agents on e-cigarette appeal, puffing behavior, and toxicity. The study will involve a randomized trial with 120 young adult e-cigarette users (ages 21-29 years), precisely manipulated e-liquids, a well-characterized commercial e-cigarette device, validated psycho-behavioral measures, and a new puff-playback method to estimate human exposures to harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) and other toxicants from vaping e-liquids with and without WS-3 and WS-23. Study aims are: (1) to assess the abuse liability of e-liquids with and without the presence of synthetic cooling agents; (2) to determine the impact of synthetic cooling agents and flavor on e-cigarette puffing behavior; and (3) to determine the exposure ranges (HPHCs, other toxicants) from using e-liquids with and without the presence of synthetic cooling agents. Findings may inform future regulatory activities related to synthetic cooling agent additives in e-cigarette products.\n\nAlayna Tackett Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01CA276696-01\n\nInstitution: University of Southern California 06/09/2023\n\nClinical Pharmacology of Nicotine Enantiomers\n\nA number of e-cigarette brands use liquids that are “tobacco-free,” meaning they contain “synthetic” nicotine. Nicotine can exist as two mirror image forms called enantiomers or optical isomers: the (S)-isomer and the (R)-isomer. While nicotine from tobacco is almost exclusively (S)-nicotine, most synthetic nicotine products are a 50/50 combination of (S)- and (R)-nicotine (called racemic nicotine). Little information exists on the effects of (R)- and racemic nicotine in humans. Researchers will compare the effects of (S)-, (R)-, and racemic nicotine in 18 experienced e-cigarette users ages 21 and older. Subjects will, on three separate days, use (S)-, (R)-, or racemic nicotine both in standardized sessions (15 puffs, one every 30 seconds) and in a 90-minute session in which they use the product as desired. Study aims are to measure the following for (S)-, (R)-, and racemic nicotine: (1) pharmacokinetics (including plasma nicotine concentration measures), (2) pulmonary retention, (3) nicotine metabolism, (4) cardiovascular responses (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate), (5) subjective responses (e.g., reward, craving), and (6) nicotine self-administration. Findings related to the relative abuse potential, cardiovascular effects, and metabolic differences in (S)-, (R)-, and racemic nicotine may inform possible future FDA regulation of synthetic nicotine products.\n\nNeal Benowitz Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01DA057282-01\n\nInstitution: University of California, San Francisco 05/18/2023\n\nCardiopulmonary outcomes of dual cigarette and e-cigarette use in animal models of chronic exposure\n\nThe chemical profiles of cigarette smoke and pod-style nicotine salt e-cigarette (e-cigpod) aerosols are different, which suggests that the health effects of chronic smoking and vaping may not fully overlap. Researchers will test whether cigarette smoking and e-cigpod vaping are independent risk factors for cardiopulmonary disease and whether dual use worsens abnormal changes in the lungs, heart, and blood vessels compared to use of either product alone. They will expose mice to e-cigpod aerosols, cigarette smoke, or a combination of the two, and will compare the structural and functional changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. They will measure the mechanical properties of the of aorta (tissue stiffness, distensibility, and elastic storage), heart (fractional shortening and ejection fractions), and lungs (resistance and elastance) and will characterize tissue microstructure (air space sizes, collagen content, and elastic fiber integrity) to highlight the factors that most heavily contribute to observed functional changes. Specific aims are: (1) to compare the structural and functional remodeling of the heart and central vasculature in mice following chronic inhalation of e-cigpod aerosols, alone or in combination with cigarette smoke; and (2) to determine the respiratory co-morbidities affecting lung structure and function in mice upon chronic inhalation of e-cigpod aerosols, alone or alternated with cigarette smoke. Findings will provide new information related to dual cigarette/e-cigarette use.\n\nChiara Bellini Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01HL168719-01\n\nInstitution: Northeastern University 05/05/2023\n\nRutgers Center of Excellence in Rapid Surveillance of Tobacco (CRST)\n\nRapid assessment and response to changes in the tobacco market are important to informing and evaluating FDA’s current and pending regulatory actions, including proposed product standards and pending marketing authorizations for e-cigarettes. This project assembles a large collaborative network that includes six sentinel states (California, Kentucky, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, and Vermont) and triangulates multiple data sources to establish the Center for Rapid Surveillance of Tobacco (CRST). The aims of CRST are: (1) to conduct rapid surveillance of tobacco product marketing to generate signals of interest; (2) to conduct rapid surveillance of the tobacco product marketplace to generate and refine signals of interest; (3) to conduct rapid surveillance of changes in tobacco product use behaviors to generate, refine, and evaluate signals of interest; and (4) to implement an optimal rapid tobacco surveillance program that will enhance FDA’s tobacco product regulatory activities. CRST will establish a new paradigm of tobacco surveillance, serve as a resource on surveillance methods and measures, support evolutions in traditional surveillance measures, and meaningfully advance the field of tobacco regulatory science.\n\nCristine Delnevo Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1U01CA278695-01\n\nInstitution: Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences – School of Public Health 05/01/2023\n\nThe Impact of Menthol Regulation for Cigarettes and E-cigarettes on Tobacco Use Patterns for Current Menthol Smokers\n\nThe impact of a cigarette menthol ban on changes in tobacco use may depend on whether menthol is banned in e-cigarettes. Researchers will conduct a randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of menthol bans for cigarettes and e-cigarettes on tobacco use patterns including cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, use of medicinal nicotine, and cessation-related behaviors. In a 2x2 study design (four groups), 240 current menthol smokers (ages 21 and older) will be assigned to either menthol or non-menthol cigarettes and either menthol or tobacco-flavored e-liquid for seven weeks. Study aims are: (1) to assess the impact of simulated cigarette and e-cigarette menthol regulations on tobacco use patterns (cigarettes smoked per day, e-cigarette use, ability to abstain from smoking) among current menthol smokers using electronic daily diaries; (2) to evaluate the impact of simulated cigarette and e-cigarette menthol regulations on cigarette and e-cigarette subjective effects and dependence; and (3) to describe the impact of simulated cigarette and e-cigarette menthol regulations, calibrate the effect to the US adult menthol smoking population, and model the impact on death and life-years lost attributable to smoking and e-cigarette use. To assess the ability to abstain from smoking, participants will complete a 1-week practice quit attempt in Week 7 and researchers will assess the time to first smoking lapse. Self-reported tobacco use will be corroborated by biomarkers for smoke and nicotine exposure (expired carbon monoxide, urinary cotinine). Findings will provide important information about the impact of menthol bans for cigarettes and e-cigarettes.\n\nTracy Smith Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01DA055985-01A1\n\nInstitution: Medical University of South Carolina 04/28/2023\n\nA Comprehensive Evaluation of Tobacco-Flavored vs. Non-Tobacco Flavored E-cigarettes on Smoking Behavior\n\nResearchers will conduct a nationwide randomized trial to evaluate the benefits of e-cigarette flavors, if any, to adult smokers. The study will evaluate the impact of e-cigarette flavors on product uptake and appeal; cigarette craving, symptoms, and dependence; and smoking behavior, including switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. They will also study whether e-cigarettes offer an increased benefit vs. patch+lozenge nicotine replacement therapy. A total of 1500 smokers (ages 21 and older) will be randomized to use their preferred flavor e-cigarette, a tobacco flavor e-cigarette, or combination NRT. Products will be provided for 14 weeks (2-week trial before switch date and 12 weeks of use following switch date). Changes in smoking will be biochemically confirmed with a carbon monoxide reading at 12 weeks and again 14 weeks later. Study aims are: (1) to determine preferred flavor vs. tobacco flavor e-cigarettes vs. NRT on tobacco use patterns including product switching, cigarette abstinence, and number of cigarettes smoked; (2) to examine the effects of preferred flavor vs. tobacco flavor e-cigarettes vs. NRT on cigarette craving, withdrawal symptoms, and perceived nicotine dependence; and (3) to examine the effects of preferred flavor vs. tobacco flavor e-cigarettes on product appeal and uptake, including initial trial, days used during the period of product provision, and purchase and continued use after 12 weeks. Findings will provide important information about the impact of e-cigarette flavors on tobacco use among adult smokers.\n\nTheodore Wagener and Tracy Smith Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant.\n\nID Number: 1R01DA057327-01\n\nInstitution: The Ohio State University 04/28/2023\n\nUsing Casual Machine Learning Methods to Inform Tobacco Regulatory Science\n\nThis study will use Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data and causal machine learning methods to determine the influence of e-cigarettes on subsequent conventional cigarette smoking in youth and adult populations and in vulnerable subgroups. The PATH Study data analyzed will include data from Waves 1 to 5 (10,384 youth ages 12-17; 21,285 adults ages 18 and older). Study aims are: (1) to determine average exposure effects of e-cigarette use on subsequent cigarette smoking in youth and adults; (2) to determine heterogeneous e-cigarette exposure effects among vulnerable subgroups (defined by age, gender, poverty, and race/ethnicity); and (3) to evaluate the performance of causal machine learning methods to generalize e-cigarette exposure effects using both simulated and PATH Study data. Understanding how e-cigarettes influence subsequent cigarette smoking, particularly among vulnerable subgroups and their intersectionality, will help inform regulatory activities that address tobacco-related health disparities.\n\nShu Xu Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1K01DA058408-01\n\nInstitution: New York University School of Medicine 04/07/2023\n\nUtilizing tobacco discrete choice experiments to predict the population impacts of FDA regulatory policies\n\nDiscrete choice experiments (DCEs), a method to assess consumer preferences for new products, have been used to study the impacts of potential regulatory policies on tobacco use behaviors, particularly in the areas of product standards and messaging development (e.g., warnings, campaigns). The goal of this project is to estimate the impact of FDA regulatory policies on tobacco use behaviors using existing DCE evidence. Researchers will conduct systematic reviews to synthesize DCE evidence on product standards and messaging development by assessing consumer rankings of policy importance and willingness to pay. They will also combine DCE evidence with Nielsen Retail Scanner data and nationally representative surveys to reduce the hypothetical bias in DCEs -- namely, the bias between what people claim they would do (stated preference) and what people actually do in the real world (revealed preference. Study aims are: (1) to conduct a systematic review of tobacco DCEs that manipulate product attributes; (2) to conduct a systematic review of tobacco DCEs that manipulate product messaging; and (3) to combine stated-preference DCEs and revealed-preference real-world retail and survey data to predict the impacts of FDA regulatory policies on product market shares and tobacco use. This project will provide the first systematic review of tobacco DCEs in the context of informing FDA regulatory policies.\n\nCe Shang Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21CA281031-01\n\nInstitution: The Ohio State University 04/01/2023\n\nNetwork-based analysis of disease-associated epigenetic changes in young adult electronic cigarette users\n\nMany toxicants and carcinogens in e-cigarette aerosols cause changes in genes related to disease development. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical in regulating gene expression (i.e., how the information in a gene turns into a trait). This study will investigate lncRNA-mediated gene regulation and its association with disease development in 196 young adults ages 18-24. Study aims are: (1) to detect abnormal lncRNAs and their interactions in order to identify new biomarkers of exposure for e-cigarette use; (2) to identify which diseases are associated with the abnormal lncRNAs detected; and (3) to describe the associations between abnormal lncRNAs, the intensity and duration of e-cigarette use session (i.e., dose), and the characteristics of e-cigarette products used by young adults. Findings regarding how e-cigarette use patterns (i.e., dose) and product characteristics can cause biological effects in young adults will provide new data that may inform future FDA regulatory activities.\n\nAhmad Besaratinia Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21DA058342-01\n\nInstitution: University of Southern California 04/01/2023\n\nAssessing the real-world impact of a low nicotine product standard for smoked tobacco in New Zealand\n\nIn December 2021, the New Zealand (NZ) government launched the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Action Plan, outlining a strategy to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5%. A major component of the plan is to mandate a low nicotine product standard for all smoked tobacco. This study will assess the real-world impact of this mandated nicotine reduction. Researchers will study 1500 adults (ages 21 and older) who smoke daily or nearly daily, sampling individuals from three priority populations (individuals with anxiety and depression; young adults living in socioeconomically deprived areas; and individuals who report heavy alcohol and/or cannabis use) and ensuring representation of NZ ethnic groups (Māori, Pacifika) with high smoking prevalence. Researchers will follow subjects for 2.5 years (1.5 years before and 1 year after implementation of a low nicotine product standard), using online surveys, biomarkers of exposure, physiological assessments, qualitative interviews, and medical records to assess changes in smoking behavior, health, and well-being. Study aims are: (1) to assess the impact of a mandated reduction of nicotine in smoked tobacco on nicotine and tobacco product use, and (2) to assess the impact of a mandated reduction of nicotine in smoked tobacco on health and well-being. An exploratory aim will investigate individual differences in the impact of nicotine reduction. Findings may inform the implementation of a US nicotine reduction policy.\n\nRachel Denlinger - Apte Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01DA058264-01\n\nInstitution: Wake Forest University Health Sciences 04/01/2023\n\nVaping and Smoking Cessation in Intensive Longitudinal National Data\n\nThis study will investigate whether e-cigarette use encourages smokers to initiate and sustain smoking cessation in the real world, and whether they experience cessation-related mental health benefits. The study will use data generated by the nationally representative survey of the Understanding America Study, which includes 26 bi-weekly survey waves (April 2020 - July 2021) and nine additional monthly follow-up surveys (October 2021 - June 2022) with past-week e-cigarette use and smoking frequency measures. Specifically, the current study will use a subsample of 1,154 baseline past-week adult smokers (ages 18 and older) to assess bi-weekly associations of nicotine e-cigarette use with smoking abstinence two weeks later across follow-ups extending up to 110 weeks, which will provide more precision than previous national studies of smoking cessation assisted by e-cigarette use. Study aims are: (1) to determine short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (up to 110 weeks) associations of daily or non-daily (vs. no) e-cigarette use with smoking cessation; (2) to determine whether anxiety/depression symptoms are a mediator and consequence of e-cigarette-related smoking cessation; and (3) to examine other substance use as a time-varying moderator of the association of e-cigarette use with smoking cessation and the anxiety/depression mediation pathway. Findings may inform future regulatory activities related to e-cigarettes.\n\nAdam Leventhal Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21DA058343-01\n\nInstitution: University of Southern California 04/01/2023\n\nThe CRILLOS Project: Impact of Tobacco Regulatory Policy on Dynamic Use of Exclusive, Dual, or Poly Cigar and Other Tobacco Product Use among Young Adults\n\nThis study will investigate whether little cigar and cigarillo (LCC) repackaging and rhetoric about over-policing and discrimination against smokers influence African-American/Black (AA/B) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) young adult (ages 18-34) flavor ban perceptions and predict future LCC smoking behaviors among current users and non-users. Study aims are: (1) to assess the impact of LCC repackaging and rhetoric about over-policing and discrimination against smokers on the future LCC smoking behaviors of AA/B and H/L young adults; (2) to assess the impact of the flavor ban on AA/B and H/L young adult preferences for other flavored tobacco products not included in the ban; and (3) to assess the impact of the flavor ban on AA/B and H/L young adult preferences for purchasing banned LCCs from illicit sources. To achieve Aim 1, researchers will conduct focus groups with 40 participants as well as online surveys every six months over six data collection waves among 1000 AA/B and H/L young adults. To achieve Aim 2, researchers will conduct a second focus group round with a new sample of 40 AA/B and HH/L young adults who will describe their experiences with other flavored tobacco products. Focus group data will inform a discrete choice experiment with 150 current LCC users and 150 susceptible non-users to determine the impact of the flavor ban on preferences for other flavored tobacco products (e.g., hookah, roll-your-own, hemp wraps). To achieve Aim 3, a third focus group round will include another new sample of 40 AA/B and HH/L young adults who will assess their consideration of and openness to buying banned LCC products from illicit sources. These data will inform a second DCE to determine the impact of the flavor ban on banned product purchasing preferences of a new group of 150 current LCC users and 150 susceptible non-users. Findings may inform the development of additional product standards for LCCs.\n\nKimberle Sterling Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R01DA058261-01\n\nInstitution: University of Texas Health Sciences Center Houston 04/01/2023\n\nElectronic Cigarettes: Emerging Ingredients, Acids, Toxicants, and Indicators of Non-Tobacco Nicotine\n\nRecent changes in e-liquid chemistry involve the use of many emerging ingredients, including (but not limited to) new cooling agents and synthetic nicotine.

Researchers will conduct 20 online focus groups (6-9 participants each) with adults ages 21+ (current users of combusted cigarettes; dual/poly users of tobacco products; and former users of combusted cigarettes) as well as susceptible never-tobacco-users ages 18-20. Participants will describe their harm perceptions about categories of tobacco products, and then be asked to provide feedback on stimuli presenting modified risk information or harmful and potentially harmful constituent (HPHC) information. Participants will be asked questions to uncover how and what information people consider when forming harm perceptions. Study stimuli will take the form of mock product labels that include modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) claims and infographics presenting HPHC information.

The study involves two phases. Phase 1 studies will involve anti-microbial effectiveness, aw, and endotoxin testing conducted with laboratory-prepared e-liquids containing varying levels of PG, VG, and nicotine (36 samples: 3 PG/VG ratios × 4 nicotine levels × 3 flavors). Phase 2 testing will be conducted on commercial closed system e-liquids and will include 21 products, chosen based on 2019 Nielsen data, at defined time points during storage at ambient temperature. Phase 2 testing will include aw, total aerobic microbial count (TAMC), total yeast and mold count (TYMC), endotoxin, (1→3)-β-D-glucan, NNN, and NNK.

Using a modifiable laboratory-grade waterpipe, researchers will measure HPHCs in mainstream smoke during one-hour smoking sessions. Baseline studies will establish a comparison between charcoal and electric heat sources and their effects on temperature and HPHC yields. Next, researchers will modify individual waterpipe components (head, stem diameter, base volume, tobacco blend, charcoal type) separately to evaluate the effect of each component on HPHC yields. Findings will clarify the effects of waterpipe design parameters on HPHCs and may inform regulatory activities related to waterpipes.\n\nTannya Agarwal Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40122D00006\n\nInstitution: Labstat International ULC 09/26/2022\n\nEvaluation of Canadian Policy Limiting Nicotine Concentration in Vaping Products and a U.S. Policy Restricting Tobacco Product Sales\n\nThis study involves two comprehensive evaluations of sales restrictions on tobacco products to determine whether the policies were implemented as intended; had the intended public health impact (and if not, why); and resulted in any potential unintended consequences. The primary outcome to be examined is change in youth tobacco use behaviors following policy implementation; secondary outcomes, such as adult use behaviors (e.g., switching, cessation), will also be considered. Potential unintended consequences to be examined could include policy loopholes, consumer or industry behaviors intended to circumvent the policy, or unanticipated changes in consumer behavior (e.g., fewer adults switching from combustible product use to vaping products). The first of the two policies to be evaluated is a Canadian federal policy limiting nicotine concentration in vaping products. In June 2021, Health Canada announced a new federal regulation setting a maximum nicotine concentration of 20 mg/mL for vaping products manufactured or imported for sale in Canada. The date by which manufacturers and importers were expected to comply with this regulation was August 8, 2021, and retailers were expected to comply by August 22, 2021. Vaping products manufactured exclusively for export are exempt from this regulation and are permitted to have nicotine concentrations up to 66 mg/mL. There is also an exemption for vaping products that have received market authorization under Canada’s Food and Drugs Act. A second policy for evaluation is to be determined.\n\nBetty Brown Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: HHSF223201810042B\n\nInstitution: Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International 09/22/2022\n\nInvestigating the Effects of Nicotine Pouch Flavors on Abuse Liability in Smokeless Tobacco Users\n\nThis study will evaluate the impact of nicotine pouch flavor and tobacco-derived vs. non-tobacco nicotine formulation on abuse liability and nicotine exposure. Study aims are: (1) to compare nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK; how the body processes nicotine) and pharmacodynamics (PD; nicotine’s effects on the body), subjective effects, relative reinforcement, and product use behavior of nicotine pouches compared to traditional moist snuff products; (2) to assess the influence of pouch flavors on nicotine PK, subjective effects, and product use behavior; and 3) to compare nicotine PK and PD, subjective effects, relative reinforcement, and product use behavior of pouches with synthetic nicotine compared to pouches with tobacco-derived nicotine. Participants will include 30 adult (ages 21-65) smokeless tobacco users. Participants will complete five study visits during which they will use a moist snuff product or a nicotine pouch product (three flavors of tobacco-derived pouches and one flavor-matched pouch with synthetic nicotine). Participants will use the study products under both prescribed (i.e., 30 minutes of directed use) and ad libitum use (i.e., 4 hours of uncontrolled use). Blood plasma, blood pressure, heart rate, subjective effects (e.g., liking, withdrawal, sensory effects), use topography measures (e.g., time to first use, number of pouches used, duration of use), and hypothetical purchasing tasks will be collected/completed throughout the session. Findings may inform future regulatory activities related to nicotine pouches.\n\nCarson Smith and Wallace Pickworth Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: HHSF223201710040I\n\nInstitution: Battelle 09/22/2022\n\nPharmacological and Subjective Differences Between E-Liquids Containing Freebase Nicotine or a Nicotine Salt as a Function of ENDS Experience\n\nThis study will evaluate the effects of nicotine salts and freebase nicotine on nicotine pharmacokinetics and subjective effects among experienced ENDS users and smokers with no ENDS experience. Study aims are: (1) to determine whether the use of freebase nicotine or nicotine salt-containing e-liquids leads to differences in nicotine pharmacokinetics; (2) to assess whether the use of freebase nicotine or nicotine salt-containing e-liquids leads to differences in subjective effects and puff topography. Over six visits, 30 participants (ages 21-65) will use their own brand combusted cigarette or ENDS and will be randomized to use one of four unique e-liquids (containing freebase nicotine or a nicotine salt, with either a low or high nicotine concentration) from an ENDS device. Each visit will include a standardized puffing session and an ad libitum use session. Results from this study may inform future regulatory activities related to ENDS.\n\nJacob McDonald Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: HHSF223201710041I / 75F40122F19001\n\nInstitution: Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute (LBERI) 09/16/2022\n\nLoopholes, Enforcement Challenges, and Tobacco Industry Interference with Tobacco Control Policies\n\nDuring 2019-2020, two federal actions were taken: (1) Tobacco 21 (T21) increased the minimum legal sales age for tobacco to 21 years; and (2) a policy prioritizing enforcement against unauthorized pod/cartridge-based e-cigarette products that contained flavors other than mint/menthol was announced by FDA. This study involves a comprehensive social media assessment aimed at uncovering information regarding these actions in three areas: policy efficacy, enforcement challenges, and industry interference. Study aims are: (1) to identify loopholes that circumvent emerging federal tobacco access laws and policies; (2) to identify key challenges related to enforcement of tobacco access; and (3) to investigate tobacco industry interference with T21 and FDA’s flavored e-cigarette enforcement policy. To achieve these aims, researchers will use specialized software and a comprehensive list of search terms to collect data from several social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook). After developing a codebook to explore sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, and mixed/both) about tobacco youth access policies and laws, two trained independent coders will code a sub-sample of collected data, stratifying by month, day, and time. Finally, content analyses and social network analyses will be used to explore loopholes, enforcement challenges, and interference with emerging tobacco access policies and laws. Findings may inform future regulatory activities related to product standard development and policy implementation.\n\nPage Dobbs Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1K01CA267967-01A1\n\nInstitution: University of Arkansas at Fayetteville 09/15/2022\n\nSimulating the Impact of a Menthol Ban in the US; Translating the Canadian Model\n\nThis study will use two data sources -- the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study in the US and a cohort of smokers from Ontario, Canada -- to develop a simulation model predicting how the Canadian ban on menthol cigarettes, one of the only evaluated national-level menthol bans in the world, would be experienced in the US given differences in age, sex, race, menthol use, and expectations of behavior change. The goal of this project is to study the impact of the Canadian menthol ban to predict the impact of menthol regulations in the US on smoking cessation, health outcomes, and health costs. Findings will provide information on the expected impacts of menthol regulations in the US and provide practical guidance to inform the development of regulatory policy.\n\nMichael Chaiton and Shehzad Ali Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21CA260823-01A1\n\nInstitution: Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) 09/15/2022\n\nConsumer Perceptions of Cessation and Harm Reduction Messaging (CHarM)\n\nThis study will investigate consumer perceptions related to cessation of tobacco and nicotine products, nicotine, combustion, and continuum of risk. Researchers will conduct 18 virtual focus groups with approximately 54-108 adults (ages 25+) who are established cigarette smokers and currently smoke cigarettes. Discussions will cover topics such as the definition of quitting and experiences with quitting cigarettes; participants will also share reactions to draft messaging statements and stimuli focused on these topics. Findings will inform the development of FDA tobacco education strategies, including potential web content for consumers.\n\nCarol Schmitt (CTP Contact: Megan Vigorita) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40120A00017\n\nInstitution: Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International 09/15/2022\n\nConsumer Perceptions of Modified and Reduced Risk (MoRR) Study\n\nFDA will conduct 18 qualitative focus groups with 54-108 adults ages 25 and older who currently smoke cigarettes to inform the development of updated website content intended to educate the public about modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) and the continuum of risk. Discussion topics will include the level of risk or harm consumers attribute to combustible and non-combustible tobacco products, consumer understanding of the concepts of \"relative risk\" and \"modified/reduced risk\", and consumer perceptions of FDA regulations. To better understand their comprehension and interpretation of these statements, participants will also read and respond to CTP statements related to these topics. Findings will inform web content and potentially additional content for other communication products (e.g., webinars, presentations) that will describe these concepts in consumer-friendly and plain language. Findings will also inform plain language communications for consumers about CTP application review pathways and decision-making guidelines, including pathways for MRTP applications and new tobacco products submitted through the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway.\n\nCarol Schmitt (CTP Contact: Emily Peterson) Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40120A00017\n\nInstitution: Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International 09/13/2022\n\nCommunication Messages to Reduce Youth Multiple Tobacco Product Use\n\nThe goal of this study is to develop and evaluate messages about the harms of multiple tobacco product (MTP) use aimed at youth. Study aims are: (1) to identify effective themes for youth-oriented messages that communicate the harms of MTP use by conducting six focus groups with up to 42 youth MTP users (ages 13-18), an expert panel review, and an online experiment with 300 MTP users; (2) to develop a set of high-impact messages that discourage MTP use and determine whether other message elements (e.g., testimonials, quitting approach, self-efficacy cue) increase tobacco quit intentions using two online experiments with 500 youth MTP users; and (3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial with 200 youth MTP users (50% with lower socioeconomic status) to determine whether the MTP messages over a two-week period increase tobacco quit intentions more than existing messages that focus only on single tobacco products and control messages. Findings may inform future public education campaign communications and messaging.\n\nSarah Kowitt Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1K01CA265886-01A1\n\nInstitution: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 09/01/2022\n\nRespiratory Effects, Metal and Aldehyde Exposure from E-cigarette Use in Young Adults (REMA)\n\nThis project will investigate exposure to toxic metals and aldehydes and pulmonary health effects associated with e-cigarette use among young adults (ages 18-24). Specific aims are: (1) to evaluate the relationship between e-cigarette use and metal and aldehyde exposure and effects; (2) to assess the association between e-cigarette use and respiratory outcomes and inflammatory markers; and (3) to assess metal and aldehyde exposure as a factor in e-cigarette-related respiratory health outcomes. To achieve Aim 1, the researcher will assess e-cigarette biomarkers of exposure (aldehydes, metals) and effect (metallothionein) in 75 users by collecting data on vaping regimen, device, and e-liquid constituents as well as aerosol samples, biospecimens (blood, urine), and spirometry measures and will compare findings to data collected from 75 non-users. To achieve Aim 2, the researcher will collect the same data from a second cohort of 150 participants (75 e-cigarette users, 75 non-users) along with biomarkers of effect and inflammation (blood, urine, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)) and gene expression profiles (in nasal epithelial cells); the researcher will then evaluate whether e-cigarette users have increased respiratory symptoms, inflammation and altered gene expression profiles compared to non-users. To achieve Aim 3, the researcher will combine Aim 1 and Aim 2 cohort data to analyze whether metal and aldehyde exposure is positively associated with respiratory outcomes and oxidative stress markers. Findings will provide new data regarding how e-cigarettes can impact metal and aldehyde exposure and respiratory health.\n\nAngela Aherrera Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1K99ES034507-01\n\nInstitution: Johns Hopkins University 08/30/2022\n\nThe Effect of E-Cigarette and Hookah Use on the Age of Asthma Onset in the USA\n\nThis study will investigate the effect of past 30-day e-cigarette and hookah use among never cigarette users on the age of asthma onset. Age of asthma onset will use data from waves 1-5 (and any subsequent waves released during the study period) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study (participants ages 12-75+ years). Study aims are: (1) to explore the association between past 30-day e-cigarette use and the age of asthma onset after controlling for other risk factors; and (2) to explore the association between past 30-day hookah use and the age of asthma onset after controlling for other risk factors. Findings will provide information that may inform our understanding of potential health consequences associated with e-cigarette use.\n\nAdriana Pérez Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21HL165401-01\n\nInstitution: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston 08/30/2022\n\nNicotine Pouches: Chemical Composition, Toxicity and Behavioral Effects of a New Tobacco Product Category\n\nThis study will examine the chemical composition, behavioral and addictive effects, and toxicological properties of nicotine pouches. Study aims are: (1) to analyze the chemical composition of nicotine pouch products (e.g., On!, Velo, Zyn) and evaluate nicotine and flavorant (e.g., menthol, cooling agents, vanillin, cinnamaldehyde) release; (2) to examine the toxicological effects of nicotine pouch extracts on human oral epithelial cells; and (3) to examine the effects of synthetic sweeteners and flavors in nicotine pouches on preference behavior in mice.

This supplement adds a fourth country, New Zealand, to the parent grant’s youth and young adult tobacco use data collections in the US, Canada, and England. Recently, New Zealand announced its national Smokefree New Zealand 2025 Action Plan. The research performed as part of this supplement will inform Action Plan policy discussions by adding critically important baseline survey data on vaping and smoking behaviors among New Zealand’s youth and young adult population. Over the longer term, a New Zealand youth and young adult sample would allow the INPAM study to compare the relative effects of policies among youth versus adult smokers in New Zealand and comparisons between New Zealand, the US, and other INPAM participant countries. Because of the novelty of New Zealand’s Smokefree Action Plan, these data comparisons have the potential to inform tobacco control policy in the US, Canada and Europe.\n\nMichael Cummings Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 3P01CA200512-07S1\n\nInstitution: Medical University of South Carolina 08/30/2022\n\nChanges in the Public Health Burden of Tobacco Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The C4R Study\n\nThis study will characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use patterns and the association between pre-COVID tobacco use and the risk and severity of COVID-19 illness. Researchers will study these topics as part of the Collaborative Cohort of Cohorts for COVID-19 Research (C4R), a nationwide study of 14 population-based multi-ethnic NIH-funded cohorts, which is assessing self-reported cigarette and e-cigarette use using standardized questionnaires in over 45,000 cohort participants. C4R is also ascertaining COVID-19 cases via questionnaires and validating cases via SARS-CoV-2 serology. C4R has already collected over 45,000 COVID questionnaires and over 17,000 dried blood spots for SARS-CoV-2 serology; over 1,000 COVID-related events are undergoing adjudication. In Aim 1, researchers will identify and examine changes in cigarette and e-cigarette status, intensity of use, and product mix use during the pandemic period (2020-22) compared to pre-pandemic tobacco use trajectories (1971-2019). These changes will be assessed in association with socio-demographics, psychosocial factors, comorbidities, COVID risk mitigation behavior (including vaccination), and history of COVID-19 illness. In Aim 2, researchers will assess whether COVID-19 outcomes, including post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), are associated with pre-COVID non-cigarette tobacco use patterns (pipes, cigars, and e-cigarettes), compared to cigarette use and never tobacco-use. Findings will provide new information on whether tobacco use increases the relative risk of adverse pandemic-era health outcomes, severe COVID-19, and PASC.\n\nPallavi Balte and Elizabeth Oelsner Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21HL165405-01\n\nInstitution: Columbia University Health Sciences 08/30/2022\n\nEffect of Menthol to Non-Menthol Cigarette Switching on Subclinical Inflammatory Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Health: Simulating a Menthol Cigarette Ban\n\nThis study will evaluate whether menthol cigarette (MC) use elevates biomarkers of inflammation in smokers and increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk compared to non-menthol cigarette (NMC) use. Study aims are: (1) to evaluate differences in biomarkers of systemic inflammation and CVD risk between MC and NMC smokers by analyzing biomarker data gathered during Waves 1-5 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study; and (2) to examine how switching from MC to NMC smoking impacts biomarkers of systemic inflammation, smoking behavior, and subjective responses related to smoking in a five-week study. In this study, 68 MC smokers (ages 21-60) will participate in one week of baseline of MC smoking (Phase 1), followed by four weeks of switching to study-provided, brand-matched NMCs (Phase 2). Biomarkers of systemic inflammation (e.g., hsCRP, interleukin cytokines) and tobacco exposure (e.g., cotinine, carbon monoxide) will be analyzed from blood samples before, during, and after switching. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods will also be gathered to measure patterns of smoking and smoking-related subjective responses.

The proposed experiments will use banked bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) airway secretion samples from ENDS users who switched from cigarette smoking, smokers, never smokers, and former smokers to assess the effects of product use transition. Study aims are: (1) to examine the airway effects of the transition from combusted to non-combusted tobacco product use, using secreted proteome and peptidome profiles as biomarker outcomes; and (2) to investigate adducts/modifications in airway secretion samples in the same user groups. Findings will help to assess changes in health effects associated with tobacco product transition indicated by airway biomarkers and may inform future regulatory activities.\n\nBoris Reidel Funding Mechanism: National Institutes of Health – Grant\n\nID Number: 1R21HL161789-01A1\n\nInstitution: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 08/01/2022\n\nEffective Cigarillo Public Education Messaging for Black Young Adults\n\nThis study will identify effective health communication strategies to communicate the harms of cigarillo smoking to Black young adults ages 18-30. Study aims are: (1) to develop and pilot test cigarillo harm messages among Black young adults at risk for established cigarillo use; and (2) to test the efficacy of cigarillo harm messages on harm perceptions and use intentions and explore the effects on use behaviors among Black young adults at risk for established cigarillo use. The researcher will first test candidate messages with 50 participants to examine their visual attention, measure perceived message effectiveness via self-report measures, and garner feedback about the messages. Next, in an online randomized controlled trial, 360 participants will be assigned to receive 1 of 3 message conditions: (1) harm messages; (2) contextualized harm messages; or (3) control messages to test message effects on cigarillo harm perceptions, use intentions, and use behaviors. Participants will view condition messages online and complete self-report measures of cigarillo harm perceptions, use intentions, and use behaviors at the beginning of their study participation and at 1- and 3-month follow-up.

Study aims are: (1) to evaluate the health and economic impact of a reduced nicotine cigarette policy for people with depression from 2021-2100; and (2) to evaluate the health and economic impact of a reduced nicotine cigarette policy for socioeconomically disadvantaged women of reproductive age from 2021-2100. The researcher will extend a previously developed simulation model of smoking and depression to incorporate morbidity and economic outcomes, including direct medical costs and productivity losses. The researcher will also develop a new smoking model specific to women of reproductive age and level of educational attainment that will simulate smoking during pregnancy and its adverse effects on maternal and infant health, including premature delivery, low-birthweight, small for gestational age, and sudden infant death syndrome. Both models will simulate the potential effects of e-cigarette use and an illicit market for normal nicotine cigarettes under a reduced nicotine cigarette policy.

Specific aims are: (1) to examine sensory perception, appeal, and reinforcing value of cooling and sweet flavor in nicotine-containing e-cigarettes by sex; and (2) to evaluate the relative reinforcement of both cooling and sweet flavor compared to no added flavor by sex. To achieve Aim 1, in separate sessions following overnight abstinence, participants will be exposed to nicotine-containing e-cigarettes with a cooling flavor, a sweet flavor, and no added flavor. For each flavor, sensory perception, appeal, and reinforcing efficacy will be examined by sex. To achieve Aim 2, researchers will use a behavioral economic design to directly compare the relative reinforcement of sweet and cooling flavors (concurrently) to no added flavor in nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. In separate sessions, each flavored e-cigarette will be available on a progressive-ratio schedule, while an unflavored e-cigarette will be available on a low, fixed-ratio schedule. Differences by sex will be compared.

The study will investigate non-filtered, machine-made cigarillos, machine-made tipped cigars, machine-made large cigars, and premium cigars. The study will have two phases. In Phase I, researchers will characterize cigars by design parameters, tobacco filler pH, and tobacco filler HPHCs. Based on the cigar characteristics, a subset of cigars will then be selected so that physical parameters and their impact on smoke chemistry can be thoroughly investigated. In Phase II, researchers will conduct mainstream smoke analyses on the selected cigars using the Health Canadian Intense (HCI) smoking regimen; HPHC smoke yield results will be correlated with the measured design parameters. For comparison, cigarettes will also be evaluated in both phases of the study. Findings will establish the effects of cigar design parameters on HPHC smoke yields and may inform future regulatory activities related to cigars.\n\nJonathan Thornburg Funding Mechanism: Research Contract\n\nID Number: 75F40122F00008\n\nInstitution: Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International 04/25/2022\n\nPod and Disposable E-Cigarette Aerosol Chemical and Physical Characterization\n\nThis study will provide comparative data on the physical and chemical characteristics of e-liquids and aerosols, including the levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs), produced by four pod and six disposable style devices with varying nicotine concentrations and formulations. Researchers will use analytical methods that utilize positive pressure to reduce aerosol aging, gathering data with better accuracy on aerosol particle size distributions and concentrations of nicotine, propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), carbonyls, and metals found for each particle size fraction collected. Results will be compared across different device types, formulations, and nicotine content to evaluate the effects of the different design parameters and e-liquid formulations on aerosols and HPHCs.

In Study Aim 1, researchers will conduct individual interviews with 72 New Zealand adults (ages 18+) who smoke tobacco cigarettes to assess product perceptions, concerns for individual health and well-being, need for support services, and behavioral intentions in response to a pending mandated reduction of nicotine in all smoked tobacco products. In Study Aim 2 (450 participants), researchers will conduct a quantitative survey with items related to tobacco use behaviors; tobacco dependence; attitudes, beliefs, and norms; other health behaviors; significant health conditions and associated risk factors; mental health indicators; and smoking cessation history. As part of Aim 2, biosamples will be banked in a biorepository located at the University of Auckland for future analysis of changes in objective measures of exposure to tobacco smoke. Both study aims will focus on three populations with high smoking prevalence (oversampling ethnic groups, i.e., Maori, Pacific Islanders): (1) individuals with self-reported anxiety, depression and other mental health concerns; (2) young adult women (ages 18-24) living in socioeconomically deprived areas who are at greater risk of smoking during pregnancy; and (3) individuals who report heavy alcohol and/or cannabis use.

The goal of this study is to describe nicotine pouch product features and marketing tactics that may drive initiation and continued use among smokers and non-nicotine users, including youth. Study aims are: (1) to examine how pouch flavors and nicotine doses impact pharmacokinetics (PK), or how nicotine moves through the body, and pharmacodynamics (PD), or the effects a person feels after using a drug, in cigarette smokers; (2) to characterize nicotine pouch marketing tactics in advertisements and examine the influence of these tactics on cigarette smokers’ and youth non-nicotine users’ product perceptions; and (3) to examine how a common marketing tactic (e.g., “tobacco-free” descriptors) impacts use behaviors and PK/PD effects in cigarette smokers and non-nicotine users. To achieve Aim 1, 28 smokers (ages 21+) will use pouches of different flavors (tobacco, mint, fruit) and nicotine doses (low, high), and their own brand of cigarettes over seven laboratory sessions, and PK and PD effects (e.g., subjective abuse liability, tobacco withdrawal) will be assessed. In Aim 2, researchers will review nicotine pouch advertisements over 5 years to identify/monitor marketing tactics and examine, via web-based experiments, how common tactics influence product perceptions (i.e., perceived harm, addictiveness, appeal) and use intentions among 2,500 adult (ages 21+) cigarette smokers and 2,500 youth (ages 13-20) non-nicotine users. In Aim 3, researchers will conduct a second laboratory study with 60 smokers and 60 non-nicotine users (ages 21+) to determine how a common marketing tactic identified from the Aim 2 marketing analysis (“tobacco-free” descriptors) impacts"
