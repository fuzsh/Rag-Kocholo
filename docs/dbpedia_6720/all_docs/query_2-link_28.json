        "text": "Effects of nicotine\n\nUse of any drug can have risks. It’s important to be careful when taking any type of drug.\n\nNicotine affects everyone differently, based on:\n\nsize, weight and health\n\nwhether the person is used to taking it\n\nwhether other drugs are taken around the same time\n\nthe amount taken\n\nthe strength of the tobacco and how much is contained in the product.\n\nThe following effects may be experienced among people who do not normally smoke tobacco products:\n\ndizziness\n\nheadache\n\nnausea\n\nabdominal cramps\n\npossibly vomiting or weakness1\n\nFor people who smoke tobacco products regularly, they will build up a tolerance to the immediate short-term effects of smoking tobacco, and may experience the following effects after smoking:\n\nmild stimulation\n\nincrease in heart rate\n\nincreased ability to concentrate\n\nrelaxation\n\ntemporary reduction in the urge to smoke\n\ncoughing\n\ndizziness, headaches\n\nbad breath\n\ntingling and numbness in fingers and toes\n\nreduced appetite, stomach cramps and vomiting.1,3\n\nIf a large amount of nicotine is taken the following effects may also be experienced:\n\nconfusion\n\nfeeling faint\n\nseizures\n\nfast breathing\n\nrespiratory arrest (stop breathing) and death.1\n\nSome people believe that smoking ‘light’ or ‘low tar’ cigarettes is less harmful than regular cigarettes. However, there is little difference between the amount of chemicals inhaled by people who smoke ‘light’ cigarettes and those who smoke regular ones.4\n\nLong-term effects\n\nRegular smoking of tobacco products which contain nicotine have well documented negative effects on health and is recognised as a major preventable cause of premature death and disability around the world.1, 5 Use of nicotine through smoking may eventually cause the following types of chronic disease and issues:\n\nstroke\n\nblindness, cataracts (eye diseases)\n\nbirth defects if the fetus is exposed to cigarettes\n\nperiodontitis (yellowing teeth, gum disease)\n\naortic aneurism (enlarging of major blood vessels)\n\ncoronary heart disease\n\npneumonia\n\nvarious respiratory diseases (shortness of breath, asthma, coughing fits)\n\ndiabetes\n\nreduced fertility\n\nectopic pregnancy (in the fallopian tube)\n\nhip fractures\n\nmale sexual dysfunction\n\nrheumatoid arthritis\n\nreduced immune function (regular colds and flu)\n\noverall diminished health (ageing, back pain, slower healing wounds, mood swings)\n\ndependence on smoking\n\nfinancial, work and social problems.5\n\nSmoking cigarettes containing nicotine are causally linked to the following cancers (i.e. smoking may directly cause these cancers)\n\noropharynx\n\nlarynx\n\noesophagus\n\ntrachea, bronchus and lung\n\nacute myeloid leukemia\n\nstomach\n\nliver\n\npancreas\n\nkidney and ureter\n\ncervix\n\nbladder\n\ncolorectal.5\n\nPassive smoking\n\nPassive smoking is when someone breathes in smoke from other people smoking. Passive smoking can cause many of the health problems listed above, so it’s important not to smoke near other people, particularly babies, children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and people with chronic respiratory conditions.6\n\nUsing nicotine with other drugs\n\nThe effects of using nicotine with other drugs – including over-the-counter or prescribed medications – can be unpredictable and could cause:\n\nNicotine + benzodiazepines: reduced effectiveness of benzodiazepines.\n\nNicotine + contraceptive pill: increased risk of blood clots forming.7\n\nSmoking tobacco appears to increase the amount of Warfarin (a prescribed medication) required to be effective.8\n\nIt’s important to check with a medical professional about whether nicotine might affect any medications you are taking.\n\nWithdrawal\n\nGiving up nicotine after using it for a long time is challenging because the body has to get used to functioning without it. Withdrawal symptoms usually start within 2–3 hours after you last use tobacco. The symptoms may last from a few days to a few weeks. These symptoms can include:\n\ncravings\n\nirritability, anxiety and depression\n\nrestless sleep\n\neating more and putting on weight\n\ntrouble concentrating\n\nheadaches\n\ncoughing and sore throat\n\naches and pains\n\nupset stomach and bowels.9"
