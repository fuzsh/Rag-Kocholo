        "text": "Frank Saunders, Philip Morris's director of corporate relations, lit a Merit cigarette and pointed to handsomely framed color photograph of the 39th President of the’ United States taken during the swearing‐in ceremony.\n\n“Your help on my campaign made this day possible,” read the inscription, The signature: JimmY Carter.\n\nThe picture was a routine political acknowledgment that Mr. Saunders had taken a leave of absence from Philip Morris during the final weeks of the 1976 Presidential campaign to serve as Mr. Carter's director of business liaison. While hardly &tidal by itself, it symbolized the aggressive political action that his won the tobacco industry a reputation as one of the nation's most sophisticated and effective lobbying forces.\n\n“Hour for hour, and dollar for dollar, they're probably the most effective lobby on Capitol Hill,” said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the health subcommittee and a leader of Washington's antismoking forces.\n\nToday, more than ever, cigarette makers need political clout. Faced with new antismoking initiatives by the Government and by such health organizations as the American Cancer Society, they have stepped up their lobbying, legal and public relations activities— from the White House to the halls of Congress, into city halls and court rooms, onto television\n\nMichael C. Jensen is a business and financial reporter for The New York Times. and radio talk shows, and into newspaper and magazine columns. Their representatives—the finest and most persuasive lawyers, public relations men and lobbyists that ‘money can buy—include former Senators, Congressmen and friends of Presidents.\n\nAccording to health officials, someone in the. United States dies every minute and a half as a result of smoking. But agents of the Tobacco Institute and tobacco‐company executives deny that the health. issue is conclusive. They spend considerable time and money attempting to discredit the antismoking forces by challenging their research, motives, accuracy sand objectivity. And they pump their own dollars into research—a good deal of it aimed at find-\n\nBecause much of the battle is being fought in Washington, the industry persistently tries to win the loyalty and votes of influential Senators and Congressmen. How successful are they? Direct quid pro quos are difficult to pinpoint, but Washington insid. ers see the industry's tracks everywhere. Mr. Saunders of Philip Morris, they point out, was the only big‐business man who worked fulltime on Carter campaign; the President sometimes vacations at the .1,800‐acre estate of Smith Bagley, heir to the R.J. Reynolds tobacco fortune, and Mr. Carter is, of course, a son of Georgia, a major tobacco producer.\n\nA few weeks ago Dr. Peter Bourne, the White\n\nHouse medical adviser, issued what was widely interpreted as a pro‐industry statement on cigarette smoking on the very day that Joseph A. Califano Jr., secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, called for a $6 million Government program on the dangers of smoking, restrictions against smoking in Government buildings and a possible increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. The Califano stance led Raymond J. Mulligan, president of Liggett, to call Mr.‐Califano a “silly ass,” arguing that the antismoking campaign could put small tobacco companies out of business. Dr. Bourne's statement that the Government ought not make “outcasts” of smokers is thought to have taken some of the sting out of the H.E.W. Secretary's comments.\n\nMost of the country's big tobacco companies‐R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson, American Brands, Lorillard and the Liggett Group,are politically active individually. But the industry's major lobbying agent, with a staff of 40 employees, is the Tobacco Institute, with Washington headquarters. The companies funnel research‐money into a separate organization, the Council for Tobacco Research.\n\nThe Institute, which is essentially political in nature, is headed by 53-year-old Horace R. Kornegay. A North Carolina Democrat who served in the House from 1955 through 1960, he was an influential member of the House Interstate and Foreign CoMmerce Committee, and as a Congressman he argued forcefully and effectively for the tobacco industry.\n\nLike Mr. Kornegay, many of the tobacco industry's most powerful figures come from the tobaccoproducing states. Mr. Kornegay's predecessor as head of the institute was Earle C._Clements, a widely acquainted former Democratic Senator from Kentucky and a friend of Lyndon B. Johnson's: Now in his 80's, Mr. Clements still consults with-his tobaceo colleagues and serves as chairman of the steering committee of tie institute's political fund.\n\nOne story ne sto ‘Circulated by ‘WeSiiiiiitorf, lisiders is‐indicative of the tobacCo lobbehind-the-scenes activity “ Mr.. Clements is ‐said to have ‘lobbied .yigorr busly in 1974 “for the appointment Of, Stenator Wendell H: Ford, Demotrat of kentucky, ‘then a freshman the‐Sen lite Commerce Committee, where the inr litistry lacked a strong advocateb Within\n\nyears, Mr. ,FOrd had, been named chairrnan of the Commerce Committee'S consumer subcoMinittee, which his oversight jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission. The F.T.C. kas a lohg‐running lawsuit against the tobacco companies seeking information about their advertising campaigns.\n\nInsiders also recall that in the early 1970's President Nixon, supposedly responding to pressure from the tobacco lobby, considered eliminating from the Federal budget any funds for the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health, an H,:E.W. arm that had become the bete noire of the tobacco industry because it was disseminating alarming data about the impact of smoking on ,health. Only a last‐minute rally by Clearinghouse advocates saved it.\n\nThe Tobacco Institute's overall budget is a closely guarded secret, as are the dues the tobacco companies pay for its support. But the money the institute channels into political campaigns must by law be divulged to the Federal Election Commission. Records at the commission's Washington offices indiL cate that the tobacco industry annually gives tens of thousands of ‘dollars, legally and mostly in small amouhts, to Senators and Congressmen for their campaigns;\n\nLast year, for example, the institute through its “Tobacco People's Public Affairs Committee” made political contributions ranging from $100 for Repra‐'; sentative Henry S. Reuss, Democrat of Wisconsin, to $1,000 for Senator Walter D. Huddleston,. Democrat of Kentucky. Many, but not all, of the committee's dozens of contributions went to candidates from the tobacco states; Outsiders who received money included Represenjative Barry M..Goldwaier Jr., Republican of California, who was given $200, and Senator Edmund. S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, who received $250.\n\nAt lease two candidates last year decided, not to keep the institute's money: Representatives: Margaret M. Heckler, a Massachusetts Republican, who said she supported H.E.W.'s efforts to discourage smoking, and Matthew F. McHugh, a New York Democrat, who said he opposed tobacco supports. Each returned $100. .\n\nMoney for the institute's political fund is given by the industry's leading executives, with the size•of contributions often parallelling corporate status. In August 1975, for example, donations by R.J. Reynolds officials included: Colin Stokes, chairman, $2,500; David S. Pea ples, a vice chairman, $2,500; William S. Smith, another vice chairman, $2,000, and more than a dozen lesser executives, $200 to $750.\n\nThe institute's political fund represents only a fragment of the money that flows from the tobacco industry into political campaigns. The National Information Center on Political Finance places direct and indirect contributions by executives of the six big tobacco companies to 1972 campaigns at $278,000. Much of the effectiveness of the tobacco lobby is said to come from day-today contact with the Washington power structure by the institute's three major lobbyists: Jack Mills, former executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee and a personal friend of former President Gerald R. Ford; Fred Panzer, who was an aide in the Johnson White House, and, the most recent addition, William Hecht, a former staffer for a Democratic Congressman from Missouri, who maintains contact with Southeastern representatives. The institute has also expanded its “State Activities” office to coordinate the efforts of six fulitime field representatives in such cities as Atlanta, Boston and ChicagO and to hire local lobbyists across the country for specific assign-\n\nThe‐reason for the expansion: a wave of legislation that could dampen cigarette sales. The Tobacco Institute estimated early last year that more than 200 antismoking bills would be introduced in state legislatures by the end of the\n\nand that a host of local measures woulo4 be debated. The industry claimed victory over one such local measure when an Indianapolis ordinance to restrict smoking in public places was defeated.\n\nOne of the most visible arms of the Tobacco Institute is its roving squad of spokesmen who have been specially trained to present a prosmoking view on talk shows and in panel discussions. Its senior member is Bill Dwyer, formerly an upstate New York radio announcer, reporter and public relations executive—he once served as spokesman for the Federal Government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and still keeps his OSHA hardhat nearby.\n\nIn three years of criss‐crossing the nation, the institute's team has spoken in more than 400 cities in 48 states. It has received coverage in several hundred newspapers and on more than 1,300 television and radio- shows, including the Today Show and Good Morning America.\n\nA tabloid newspaper called “The Tobacco Observer,” published six times year by the Tobacco Institute, carries stories that reflect favorably on the tobacco industry or tend to deflect criticism.\n\nIn one issue, a headline asserted: “Heavy Smokers—Less Lung Cancer.” Another issue headlined a story: “Eating Habits Called Major Cancer Suspect.” Recently, Nick Buoniconti, former pro football player, was quoted as saying he was incensed by “radical groups” who tried to dictate where people could and could not smoke.\n\nThe Tobacco Institute also organizes letter‐writing campaigns. In 1976, Mr. Kornegay wrote to 3,200 police chiefs across the nation about “the wave of new laws that make it a crime to smoke tobacco in public.” He argued that the new laws would divert law‐enforcement manpower from apprehending “real criminals.”\n\nAnother arm of the industry is the Tobacco Tax Council, with headquarters in Richmond, which follows and opposes attempts by states to raise tobacco excise taxes.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes role played by some tobacco companies is sketched out in 8‐K Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington. They disclose a pattern of illegal or “questionable” behavior by companies that attempted to influence politicians.\n\nR.J. Reynolds, for example, used some $190,000 in company funds between 1968 and 1973 for domestic political contributions. (It is illegal to use company money in Federal political campaigns.) Reynolds diverted some money from a foreign licensee and also employed dummied invoices to build up its political kitty, which was then used for Congressional and Presidential campaign contributions.\n\nSome tobacco companies gave Government officials cigarettes and rides on corporate planes and employed other questionable practices to curry favor. Two Georgia Congressmen, for example, were roiled to have accepted $900 each from Brown & Williamson for touring the company's Macon, Ga., plant and meeting its executives.\n\nThe tobacco companies have used variety of techniques to oppose nonsmoking initiatives. In 1972, when the Ralph Nader organization sought to force airlines to provide nonsmoking seating areas on planes, Arthur J. Stevens, general counsel of Lorillard, . sent an internal memorandum to his company's advertising vice president.\n\nThe memorandum said: “Attached are five drafts of ‘letters’ to the Civil Aeronautics Board opposing the rule to require the airlines to segregate smokers. Could you get some of the agency people to write these—by hand—on noncompany letterheads, using home addresses, and ask each one to get one or two more, similar, but not exactly the same.”\n\nAccording to documents filed with the C.A.B., a number of letters bearing a close resemblance to the drafts were subsequently received. Mr. Stevens asserted that the letter campaign did not violate any board rules, and the C.A.B. rejected a motion to invalidate the letters, observing that both sides had solicited comments."
