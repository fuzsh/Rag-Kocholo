        "text": "As tobacco companies have learned, when making statements to the public about products, there are limits to the free speech protections afforded under the First Amendment.\n\nTobacco companies engage in a form of speech every day. For example, their advertising and marketing campaigns to sell their products represent a classic form of commercial speech.\n\nThrough labeling, tobacco companies make statements about the nature and effects of their products. During the 1990s, more than 40 states filed suit against major tobacco companies for several forms of misconduct, some involving speech regarding the health risks of their product. This controversy has, in turn, led to increased laws on tobacco advertising that the industry has challenged through the years on free speech grounds.\n\nLawsuits alleged that tobacco advertising was false\n\nThe lawsuits in the 1990s, coordinated by the statesâ€™ attorneys general, alleged first and foremost that the tobacco companies had engaged in false advertising by neither disclosing information about health effects that could result from the regular use of tobacco products nor discussing the potentially addictive nature of tobacco products. The attorneys general also challenged certain advertising campaigns, such as the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel. They alleged that the Joe Camel cartoon character living a decadent life of wealth and fame in the company of beautiful women targeted minors.\n\nIn settling with the various states in the so-called Master Settlement Agreement, the tobacco companies made a series of commitments, including the abandonment of advertising campaigns like Joe Camel and the production of public service announcements on the potentially hazardous nature of smoking."
