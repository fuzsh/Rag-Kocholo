        "text": "View the Tobacco and e-cigarettes in Australia fact sheet >\n\nTobacco is made from the dried leaves of the tobacco plant and nicotine is the active ingredient responsible for its addictive properties. Tobacco is usually smoked in a cigarette, cigar or pipe, but it might also be snorted or chewed. Nicotine can now also be inhaled as a vapour through electronic nicotine delivery systems (see electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)).\n\nTobacco use in Australia is legal, however, its supply and consumption are subject to strict regulations. The advertising of tobacco is prohibited in Australia. In recent years, the restrictions have expanded to ban advertising at the point of sale and include the introduction of plain packaging.\n\nSmoking is also banned inside restaurants, bars and clubs, in cars with children and around many public places such as near children’s play equipment, swimming pools, public transport, and around public buildings.\n\nAvailability\n\nRetailing laws in each jurisdiction regulate the advertising, promotion and display of tobacco products, e-cigarettes and accessories, non-tobacco smoking products and age requirements for purchase.\n\nLatest available industry sales data from Tobacco in Australia indicate that the value of retail sales of tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars and smoking tobacco has increased from 2016 to 2017, despite the quantity of cigarette sticks sold declining (Scollo & Bayly, Table 10.6.1). In 2017, supermarkets contributed to the largest volume of cigarette sales at 7,734 million, followed by tobacconists/tobacco specialists at 2,489 million. Overall, total cigarette sales decreased by 6.7% from 2016 to 2017 (Scollo & Bayly, Table 10.6.2).\n\nData on the availability of illicit tobacco in Australia are limited. However, the level of illicit trade of tobacco in Australia is considered to be low (Scollo & Bayly 2019). The Australian Tax Office (ATO) estimated that the amount of lost excise revenue from illicit tobacco in 2017–18 ($647 million) was 5% of the amount of collectable tobacco excise (ATO 2019).\n\nConsumption\n\nFor related content on tobacco consumption by region, see also:\n\nData by region: Tobacco smoking\n\nData by region: International comparisons\n\nThere has been a long-term downward trend in tobacco smoking in Australia. The National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS) found:\n\nThe proportion of people aged 14 and over smoking daily more than halved from 24% in 1991 to 8.3% in 2022–2023 (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.1).\n\nThe proportion of people aged 14 and over who have never smoked has increased to the highest levels since the survey began (from 49% in 1991 to 65% in 2022–2023) (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.1; Figure TOBACCO 1).\n\nThe long-term decline in daily smoking has largely been driven by people never taking up smoking rather than people quitting smoking (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.1, Figure TOBACCO 1).\n\nWhen interpreting these findings, it is useful to consider the proportion of people who had ever smoked but no longer smoked (the ‘quit proportion’). This proportion increased from 42% in 1991 to 62% in 2019 (Greenhalgh et al. 2020).\n\nFigure TOBACCO 1: Tobacco smoking status, people aged 14 and over, 1991 to 2022–2023 (per cent)\n\nData from the National Health Survey (NHS) show a similar pattern to the NDSHS data over time. The proportion of adults who smoke daily (aged 18 or older) declined steadily over the 2 decades to 2022, and after adjusting for age, has halved from 22.3% in 2001 to 10.7% in 2022. Over recent years the proportion of adults who smoke daily declined slightly from 14.7% in 2014–15 (ABS 2023, Table S1.3; age standardised).\n\nEstimates using self-reported NHS data show that in 2022:\n\n1 in 10 people (10.6%) aged 18 years and over currently smoked daily.\n\nMen were more likely to smoke daily than women (12.6% compared with 8.7%) (ABS 2023, Table 14.3).\n\nFor more information about the differences between the NDSHS and the NHS, refer to Box TOBACCO 1.\n\nThe National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program (NWDMP) measures the presence of substances in sewerage treatment plants across Australia. Nicotine (including cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and nicotine replacement products such as gums and patches) is typically among the most commonly consumed substances monitored by the program (ACIC 2024).\n\nThe most recent data from the NWDMP show that the estimated population-weighted average consumption of nicotine (including tobacco products, e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement products, such as gums and patches) has remained relatively stable since the start of the program in 2016. The most recent reporting period (April and August 2023) showed that the average consumption was higher in regional areas compared with capital cities (ACIC 2024).\n\nFor state and territory data, see the National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program reports\n\nBox TOBACCO 1: National data sources on smoking and alcohol consumption\n\nA number of nationally representative data sources are available to analyse recent trends in tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. The AIHW National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS) and the ABS National Health Survey (NHS) have large sample sizes and collect self-reported data on tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\nData from the NDSHS and NHS show variations in estimates, yet comparison of trends over time are consistent between the 2 surveys. Differences in scope, collection methodology and design may account for this variation and comparisons between collections should be made with caution. For example:\n\nData are collected for people aged 14 years and over for the NDSHS and people aged 18 years and over for the NHS. Estimates are provided for people aged 18 years and over for both surveys.\n\nNDSHS respondents could choose to complete the survey via a self-complete drop and collect questionnaire, online survey or computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI).\n\nThe questions asked in the surveys also differ and therefore results from the surveys are not directly comparable (ABS 2023; AIHW 2024c).\n\nFor more information on the technical details of these surveys, please see the technical notes and data quality sections for the NDSHS and NHS.\n\nFor information about data sources examining tobacco, alcohol and other drug use by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (First Nations) people, see also: Box INDIGENOUS 2.\n\nTypes of tobacco products consumed\n\nTrends in the type of tobacco product consumed by people who smoke has changed over the past decades. Data from the 2022–2023 NDSHS found that, of people who currently smoke:\n\nThe proportion of people who smoked manufactured cigarettes exclusively declined from a peak of 74% in 2004 to 56% in 2022–2023 (AIHW 2024c, Table 2.24).\n\nThe proportion who smoked roll-your-own cigarettes exclusively increased from 5.7% in 2001 to 16% in 2022–2023 (AIHW 2024c, Table 2.24).\n\nOver 1 in 5 (22%) people aged 18–24 smoked roll-your-own cigarettes exclusively, the highest of any age group (AIHW 2024c, Table 2.25).\n\nMenthol cigarettes are flavoured tobacco products that contain menthol additive in the cigarette filter or filler. Menthol cigarettes, while smoked less frequently than non-menthol cigarettes, may be more difficult to quit as menthol modifies the effects of nicotine on the brain (Winnall et al. 2023).\n\nAccording to the 2022–2023 NDSHS almost one quarter of people who smoke daily (23%) reported smoking menthol cigarettes on a daily basis (AIHW 2024c, Table 2.26).\n\nExpenditure on tobacco products\n\nAdjusting for increasing prices of tobacco products (so that all prices are expressed in current-day terms), expenditure estimates for tobacco have declined from $44 billion in 1990 to $32 billion in 2000 and $17.2 billion in 2018 (Bayly & Scollo 2019). ABS National Accounts data have found that estimates of expenditure on tobacco also suggest continuing declines in consumption (ABS 2018).\n\nTobacco smoking by age and gender\n\nFindings from the 2022–2023 NDSHS (Figure TOBACCO2; AIHW 2024b, Table 2.4) showed that:\n\nPeople aged 50–59 (12.1%) were the most likely age group to smoke daily (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.4).\n\nIn people aged 14 and over, males (9.0%) were more likely to smoke daily than females (7.7%) (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.4).\n\nYoung adults aged 18–24 years were more likely to have never smoked than any other adult age group (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.4).\n\nThe average age at which younger people (aged 14–24 years) had their first full cigarette decreased from 16.6 years in 2019 to 16.3 years in 2022–2023 (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.18).\n\nFor more information from the NDSHS on smoking rates and trends over time, see Tobacco and e-cigarettes/vapes.\n\nData from the 2022 NHS showed that:\n\nPeople aged 55–64 years (14.9%) had the highest proportion for daily smoking (ABS 2023, Table 14.3)\n\nOf people aged 18 and over, a higher proportion of men (12.6%) than women (8.7%) currently smoked daily (ABS 2023, Table 14.3)\n\n79% of 18–24-year-olds reported never smoking in 2022, up from 75% in 2017–18 (ABS 2023, ABS 2019)\n\nThe number of cigarettes smoked per day increased with age – 8.2% of people who smoked aged 18–24 years smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day, compared with 26.5% of those aged 65 years and over (ABS 2023, Table 14.3).\n\nRecent estimates from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey show declines in daily smoking for both males (from 21.4% to 12.4%) and females (from 15.8% to 9.5%) between 2003 and 2021 (Wilkins et al. 2024). Declines in daily smoking were noted across most age groups, with greater declines for those in younger age groups.\n\nFigure TOBACCO 2: Tobacco smoking status, people aged 14 and over, by age and gender, 2001 to 2022–2023 (per cent)\n\nThe most recent data from the NWDMP show that the estimated population-weighted average consumption of nicotine (including tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and nicotine replacement products, such as patches and gum) is typically higher in regional areas than capital cities (ACIC 2024).\n\nSmoking cessation\n\nThe addictive nature of nicotine means that successful cessation may take many attempts over several years. Data from the 2022–2023 NDSHS showed that:\n\n62% of people who currently smoked had future intentions to quit (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.39).\n\nOf those who had changed their smoking behaviour:\n\n53% did so because it was costing too much\n\n45% did so because it was affecting their health or fitness (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.35)\n\nFor more data from the NDSHS on smoking cessation, see Did people who smoke try to quit or reduce their smoking?.\n\nData from the HILDA Survey indicate that between 2.1% and 3.5% of people quit smoking in any given year between 2003 and 2021. However, 3 in 5 (61.5%) people who quit smoking between 2003 and 2018 started smoking again within 3 years (Wilkins et al. 2024). Males were more likely than females to start smoking again after quitting (63.6% and 59%, respectively). These data are likely an underestimate as people who quit and start smoking again between annual survey waves will not be counted in these estimates (Wilkins et al. 2024).\n\nIllicit tobacco\n\nIllicit tobacco includes both unbranded tobacco and branded tobacco products on which no excise, customs duty or Goods and Services Tax (GST) was paid.\n\nUnbranded illicit tobacco includes finely cut, unprocessed loose tobacco that has been grown, distributed, and sold without government intervention or taxation (AIHW 2024c). According to the NDSHS, in 2022–2023:\n\nOver 2 in 5 (43%) people who smoke were aware of unbranded tobacco – an increase from 34% in 2019.\n\nAlmost one quarter (23%) of all people who smoke had smoked unbranded tobacco in their lifetime (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.30).\n\nIllicit branded tobacco includes tobacco products that are sold in Australia without the plain packaging/graphic health warnings that are required by law. The 2022–2023 NDSHS showed that:\n\nMore people who currently smoke had seen tobacco products without plain packaging/graphic health warnings in the previous 3 months (20% compared with 15.2% in 2019).\n\nOf the 10% of people who currently smoke who purchased these products, 40% said they purchased them from a tobacconist and 26% said they bought them from a supermarket, convenience or grocery store (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.31).\n\nData on the availability of illicit tobacco in Australia are limited. However, the level of illicit trade of tobacco in Australia is considered to be low (Scollo & Bayly 2019). The Australian Tax Office (ATO) estimated that the amount of lost excise revenue from illicit tobacco in 2021–22 ($2.3 billion) was 13% of the amount of collectable tobacco excise (ATO 2023).\n\nHarms\n\nBurden of disease and injury\n\nTobacco is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia. The Australian Burden of Disease Study 2018, found that tobacco smoking was responsible for 8.6% of the total burden of disease and injury. Estimates of the burden of disease attributable to tobacco use showed that cancers accounted for 44% of this burden (AIHW 2021).\n\nTobacco use contributed to the burden for 8 disease groups including 39% of respiratory diseases, 22% of cancers, 11% of cardiovascular diseases, 6.2% of infections and 3.2% of endocrine disorders (AIHW 2021, Table 6.3).\n\nThe total burden attributable to tobacco use has been declining since 2003. There was a 32% decline in the age-standardised rate (from 2003 to 2018), and the proportion of total burden due to tobacco use fell from 10.4% in 2003, to 9.0% in 2015, to 8.6% in 2018 (AIHW 2021).\n\nTobacco smoking in pregnancy\n\nTobacco smoking during pregnancy is a preventable risk factor for pregnancy complications, and support to stop smoking is widely available through antenatal clinics. Smoking is associated with poorer perinatal outcomes, including low birth weight, being small for gestational age, pre-term birth and perinatal death (AIHW 2023b).\n\nThe AIHW’s National Perinatal Data Collection indicates that the proportion of mothers who smoke during pregnancy has fallen over time in Australia. In 2021, 8.7% (or 26,433) of all mothers who gave birth smoked at some time during their pregnancy, down from 13.2% in 2011. The proportion of mothers who smoked during pregnancy declined for both First Nations mothers and non-Indigenous mothers (AIHW 2023b).\n\nExposure to second-hand smoke\n\nThe inhalation of other people’s tobacco smoke can be harmful to health. Second-hand smoke causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer in non-smoking adults, and induces and exacerbates a range of mild to severe respiratory effects in infants, children and adults. Second-hand smoke is a cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and a range of other serious health outcomes in young children. There is increasing evidence that second-hand smoke exposure is associated with psychological distress (Campbell, Ford & Winstanley 2017).\n\nResults from the 2022–2023 NDSHS show that parents and guardians are choosing to reduce their children’s exposure to tobacco smoke at home. The proportion of households with children aged under 14 where someone smoked inside the home on a daily basis has fallen from 31% in 1995 to 2.1% in 2022–2023 (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.14).\n\nIn 2022–2023, 2.6% of adults who did not smoke were exposed to tobacco inside the home on a daily basis (AIHW 2024b, Table 2.16).\n\nFor more data from the NDSHS about household exposure see “How many people were exposed to tobacco smoke at home?”\n\nResults from the 2014–15 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS) found over half (63% or 85,768) of young Indigenous people aged 15–24 reported someone in their household smoked daily (AIHW 2018). Less than one-fifth (15% or 21,155) of young Indigenous people resided in a household where someone smoked indoors (AIHW 2018).\n\nSource: AIHW 2024, tables Drg.1, SC.11 and Drg.45.\n\nSmoking cessation medicines\n\nData from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) provide information on the number of prescriptions dispensed and the number of patients supplied at least one script under the PBS within a given financial year. The PBS database includes information about medicines that are used to help people stop their smoking (smoking cessation medicines).\n\nSome smoking cessation medicines, such as Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRT; for example, nicotine patches and gums), are available over-the-counter (OTC) as well as via a prescription. OTC NRT data are not captured in the PBS data as OTC medicines are not subsidised under the PBS. For more information, refer to the Technical notes and Box PHARMS 2.\n\nData from the PBS indicate that around 323,600 scripts for prescription smoking cessation medicines were dispensed to 160,000 patients in 2021–22, a rate of 1,300 scripts and 620 patients per 100,000 population (Supplementary data tables PBS61–64). Between 2012–13 and 2021–22, dispensing rates fluctuated but overall fell from 2,200 scripts dispensed and 1,400 patients to 1,300 scripts and 620 patients per 100,000 population (tables PBS62 and PBS64).\n\nIn 2021, global distribution of Varenicline (marketed in Australia as Champix), a prescription medicine that assists adults to stop smoking, was paused due to manufacturing issues causing a long-term shortage (TGA 2021). This should be taken into consideration when comparing data with previous years.\n\nIn 2021–22:\n\nRates of smoking cessation medicine dispensing were higher for males than females.\n\nMales aged 60–69 had the highest rates of scripts dispensed (around 2,600 scripts per 100,000) and males aged 50–59 had the highest rates of patients who were dispensed smoking cessation of any group (1,300 patients per 100,000 population) (Tables PBS66 and PBS68).\n\nPeople aged 40–49, 50–59 and 60–69 had the highest rates of dispensing (Tables PBS66 and PBS68). For more information on PBS dispensing by age group, see Older people: Treatment.\n\nRates of dispensing were highest in Outer regional areas and dispensing varied between states and territories (tables PBS69–76). For more information, see Data by region.\n\nAt-risk groups\n\nDespite large reductions in tobacco smoking over time, there are challenges associated with addressing the inequality of smoking rates between some populations and the broader community.\n\nThe proportion of people who currently smoke is disproportionately high among First Nations people.\n\nPeople aged 50–59 were one of the age groups most likely to smoke daily in 2019. The highest proportion of people who smoke who were not planning to quit smoking were aged 70 and over.\n\nPeople with mental health conditions or high psychological distress are twice as likely to smoke daily as people without mental health conditions and those with low distress.\n\nElectronic cigarettes (vapes)\n\nElectronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems, personal vaporisers or vapes) are devices designed to deliver nicotine and/or other chemicals via inhalation of an aerosol vapour (Department of Health and aged Care 2021). Most e-cigarettes contain a battery, a liquid cartridge and a vaporisation system and are used in a manner that simulates smoking (ACT Health 2021). The solution used in e-cigarettes varies. Common e-liquids include propylene glycol, vegetable glycerol, and flavourings, and may contain nicotine in freebase or salt form (Banks et al. 2022).\n\nThe 2022–2023 NDSHS showed both lifetime and current use of e-cigarettes increased between 2016 to 2019, and again to 2022–23. Specifically:\n\nLifetime use of e-cigarettes increased from 11.3% in 2019 to 19.8% in 2022–2023 (AIHW 2024b, Table 3.1).\n\nCurrent use of e-cigarettes increased from 2.5% in 2019 to 7.0% in 2022–2023 (AIHW 2024b, Table 3.3).\n\nFor people who currently use e-cigarettes:\n\nAround 1 in 2 (49%) used them daily, an increase from 2019 (42%) (AIHW 2024b, Table 3.8).\n\nAlmost 3 in 4 (73%) reported the last one they used contained nicotine (AIHW 2024b, Table 3.16).\n\nSocial and economic factors shape people’s behaviours of vaping or smoking. Generally, people living in the lowest socio-economic areas were the most likely to currently smoke but not vape, (13.2% in 2022–2023). By contrast, people living in the highest socio-economic areas were the most likely to vape but not smoke (6.6%) (AIHW 2024b, Table 3.43).\n\nDaily use of e-cigarettes was more common among younger people than people of older age groups (Figure VAPING 1). Data from the 2022–2023 NDSHS showed that:\n\nPeople aged 18–24 had the highest rate of daily vaping (9.3%). Daily vaping was slightly more common among females in this age group (10.3%) than males (8.5%).\n\nPeople aged 25–34 were the most likely to report they used to use e-cigarettes but no longer use them (6.0%).\n\nIn 2022–2023, the average age of initiation for e-cigarette use was:\n\n19.4 years for those who had never smoked a cigarette, a decrease from 20.2 years in 2019\n\n25.8 years for people who smoke socially\n\n33.0 years for people who smoke regularly, a decrease from 38.1 years in 2019 (AIHW 2024b, Table 3.33).\n\nFigure VAPING 1: Use of e-cigarettes, by age and gender, 2016 to 2022–2023 (per cent)"
