        "text": "While overall smoking rates have declined in recent years, smoking rates remain higher among specific subpopulations, including African Americans. These differences are in large part due to the tobacco industry’s targeted marketing through advertising, price discounting and other strategies.[i] Every year the tobacco industry spends $9.1 billion in the United States marketing their deadly and addictive products.[ii]\n\nTobacco Use in the Black Community\n\nCigar Use Puts Health at Risk\n\nIn 2020, 19.4% of Black adults reported using a tobacco product including 14.4% who reported using cigarettes.[iii] In 2022, 11.5% of Black middle and high school students used a tobacco product.[iv] Even though Black people tend to smoke fewer cigarettes daily and start smoking cigarettes at an older age, they are more likely to die from smoking-related diseases than white people.[v] In the African American community, tobacco use continues to be a major risk factor for the three leading causes of death – heart disease, cancer, and stroke.\n\nAggressive Marketing of Menthol to Black Communities\n\nLarge disparities exist in who is smoking menthol cigarettes by race and ethnicity with nearly 83.1% of African Americans who smoke, 48.0% of Hispanics who smoke, 41.5% of Asians who smoke, and 31.6% of whites who smoke using menthol cigarettes.[vi]\n\nThese disparities in the use of menthol cigarettes, which are easier to start and harder to quit, are no accident.[vii],[viii] Tobacco companies disproportionately market menthol products in African American neighborhoods, magazines popular with African Americans, and events that are aimed for African Americans.[ix] The industry has also provided more shelf space for menthol products located in the community’s neighborhood stores.[x]\n\nTobacco Industry Targeting of Black Communities\n\nThe tobacco industry targets Black communities through advertising, price promotions, retail, and point-of-sale advertising.[xi] Some of the marketing tactics Big Tobacco has utilized to target African Americans include:\n\nPlacing large amounts of ads in publications to expose members of the community to more cigarette advertisements.[xii]\n\nSignificantly lower prices for tobacco products in neighborhoods with higher proportions of African Americans.[xiii]\n\nMaking contributions to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), elected officials, civic and community organizations, and scholarship programs, along with supporting and sponsoring cultural events such as music concerts and festivals.[xiv]\n\nAdditionally, studies have found greater tobacco retailer density nationwide in census tracts with a higher proportion of African American residents.[xv] The more tobacco retailers, the more exposure to tobacco marketing individuals face. In fact, retail marketing, including in-store advertising, product displays, and discounts accounts for a large portion of the tobacco industry’s marketing budget. In 2020 Big Tobacco spent 97% of their total cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising and promotion budgets on strategies that facilitated retail sales, such as price discounts, point-of-sale advertising, coupons, and payments to ensure prime retail space.[xvi]\n\nBig Tobacco’s Deceptive and Targeted Marketing Costs Lives"
