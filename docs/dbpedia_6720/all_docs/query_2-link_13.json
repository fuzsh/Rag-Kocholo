It is situated at Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh, India.[2]\n\nIn 1945, Government of India constituted Indian Central Tobacco Committee (ICTC) to improve the research activities and production of tobacco in India. To improve research activities, quality control and production of Tobacco, the institute is established in 1947 which was later undertaken by ICAR.\n\nThe institute has six regional research stations at Guntur, Kandukuru, and Jeelugumilli in Andhra Pradesh, and at Hunsur, Karnataka, Vedasandur, Tamil Nadu and Dinhata, West Bengal.\n\nBurley Tobacco Research Centre (BTRC) at Kalavacharla, East Godavari, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nArvind Kumar Srivastava, Achila Singh, D.
