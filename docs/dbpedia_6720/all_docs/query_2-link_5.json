        "text": "RESULTS\n\nIn 1977, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) started the first project to address social acceptability and social cost issues, Studies on the Social Aspects of Smoking, SOSAS (R.J. Reynolds, 1979b). RJR concluded that spreading information linking smoking, and particularly passive smoking, with disease was reducing the social acceptability of smoking, cigarette consumption and industry profits. RJR also identified increased public and governmental focus on smoking’s social costs as a threat (Berman, 1979). The three main objectives for SOSAS were: (1) identifying key issues that could move public opinion on the social acceptability and social costs of smoking, (2) testing possible countermeasures that could alter public opinion in favor of the industry (No author, 1977; R.J. Reynolds, 1979a) and (3) exploring the feasibility of creating an intensive, long-term, industry-wide effort to improve public opinion and tolerance of smoking (No author, 1977).\n\nRJR worried that acting alone to oppose declining social acceptability and cigarette consumption could “backfire drastically” because it would increase the chances that opponents would “galvanize their efforts and direction toward the company,” its brands and stock (Sustana, 1978). RJR, as a transnational company, realized that the social issues were global and addressing them would require an industry-wide effort. RJR took the SOSAS studies to the Tobacco Institute (TI, the tobacco industry’s US lobbying organization) to stimulate a long-term, industry-wide program (Tucker, 1979)."
