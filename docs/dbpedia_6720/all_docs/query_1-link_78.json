        "text": "If the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has its way, the following unequivocal label will appear on cigarette packs and in all advertising for cigarettes starting next year: WARNING! CIGARETTE SMOKING CAUSES CANCER, EMPHYSEMA, HEART DISEASE; MAY COMPLICATE PREGNANCY; AND IS ADDICTIVE. The Senate effort, headed by Democrat Thomas Eagleton, who smokes a pack a day of Pall Malls, is the latest and strongest warning about cigarettes.\n\nIn 1957, after the first Government caveat concerning smoking, Utah Senator Wallace Bennett introduced a bill to require the admonition: WARNING: PROLONGED USE OF THIS PRODUCT MAY RESULT IN CANCER, IN LUNG, HEART AND CIRCULATORY AILMENTS, AND OTHER DISEASES. Nothing happened until 1965 when, in the wake of a 1964 Surgeon General’s report on smoking, Congress passed the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. This called for the first pack label: CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH. In 1970, the wording was strengthened to read: WARNING: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.\n\nThe Tobacco Institute opposes all warnings, arguing that no one has ever proved that a link exists between smoking and illnesses. Says Spokesman William Toohey: “We don’t believe we know conclusively that smoking causes heart disease or cancer. It may or may not.”"
