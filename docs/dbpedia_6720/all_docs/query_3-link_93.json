        "text": "In 1964, a landmark Surgeon General report was released warning of the health hazards of smoking. Since then, the rate of tobacco use in the United States has significantly decreased but there is still work to do. Preventing tobacco use remains a high priority of the Office of the Surgeon General because, even with that decrease, it continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Today, we know that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. We know that the very design of tobacco products, especially e-cigarettes, makes them more attractive and addictive than ever. And we know, without a doubt, that quitting smoking saves lives.\n\nLearn what the Surgeon General has been doing to eradicate the scourge of tobacco. Explore the wide range of publications below on how we can protect all Americans from the dangers of tobacco and nicotine and prevent our youth from starting to use tobacco in the first place.\n\nTitle Type Preventing Tobacco Use Smoking Cessation: A Report of the Surgeon General Smoking Cessation Full Report* 2020 Executive Summary* 2020 Consumer Guide 2020 Factsheet - Key Findings 2020 Factsheet - Summary for Health Care Professionals 2020 Factsheet - Summary for Payers 2020 Factsheet - E-Cigarette and Adult Cessation 2020 Infographic - By the Numbers 2020 CDC Resources 2020 Press Release 2020 Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon General Full Report 2012 Executive Summary 2012 Consumer Booklet 2012 Fact Sheet 2012 Spanish Fact Sheet Surgeon General's Video Contest: Tobacco—I'm Not Buying It Press Release 2012 Video: Ages 13-17: Grand Prize: Tobacco I'm Not Buying It Rap 2012 Video: Ages 18-25: Grand Prize: You Don't Smoke Cigarettes, Cigarettes Smoke You 2012 Video: Grand Prize (Spanish) 2012 Video playlist: Winning entries for the Surgeon General's Video Contest: Tobacco 2012 Making Our Next Generation Tobacco Free View the Video for Making Our Next Generation Tobacco Free 2012 Smoking & Tobacco Use View the Resource for Smoking & Tobacco Use 2012 Talking to Teens About Tobacco Use View the Physician Card for Talking to Teens About Tobacco Use 2012 What You Need to Know About Tobacco to Talk to Your Teens View the Parent Card for What You Need to Know About Tobacco to Talk to Your Teens 2012 E-cigarettes E-cigarette Use Among Youth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon General Full Report 2016 Executive Summary 2016 Fact Sheet 2016 Tip Sheet for Parents 2016 Surgeon General releases advisory on E-cigarette epidemic among youth View the Advisory for Surgeon General releases advisory on E-cigarette epidemic among youth 2018 View the Press Release for Surgeon General releases advisory on E-cigarette epidemic among youth 2018 Health Consequences of Smoking The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General Full Report 2014 Executive Summary 2014 Chapter 14.
