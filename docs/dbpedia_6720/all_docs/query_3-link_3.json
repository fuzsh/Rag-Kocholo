This law—commonly called the Tobacco Control Act—gives us broad authority to regulate the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products.\n\nGuided by the center’s strategic plan, CTP takes a comprehensive approach to reduce the negative health effects of tobacco product use. We develop policy, issue regulations, conduct research, educate people on tobacco products, and make decisions on whether new tobacco products and claims can be marketed—including the review and evaluation of applications and claims before the new products are allowed on the market.\n\nThis cohesive, comprehensive approach can help us reach our goals of:\n\nPreventing people from starting to use tobacco products\n\nEncouraging people who use tobacco to quit\n\nReducing the harm caused by tobacco use\n\nAs we work to protect the public’s health, we use the full power of the law to protect people from the dangers of tobacco use.\n\nFor the latest news and actions from CTP, visit the CTP Newsroom and subscribe to CTP email newsletters.\n\nOur Vision\n\nTo make tobacco-related death and disease part of our nation’s past by ensuring a healthier future and advancing health equity for those living in the United States.\n\nOur Mission\n\nTo protect the public health of the U.S. population from tobacco-related death and disease by comprehensively regulating the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products; educating the public, especially youth, about the dangers of using tobacco products; and promoting and supporting strategies that ensure an equitable chance at living a healthier life for everyone.\n\nJobs, Fellowships, and Internships\n\nJobs, Fellowships, and Internships at the Center for Tobacco Products\n\nMeet Our Leadership\n\nExecutive Biographies\n\nOrganizational Charts\n\nContact and Connect with CTP\n\nContact and connect with the Center for Tobacco Products.
