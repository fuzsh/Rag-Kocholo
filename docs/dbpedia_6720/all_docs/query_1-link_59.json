        "text": "Madison Avenue, which always admires a deft maneuver, was fascinated last week by the cigarette industry's efforts to ward off restrictive Government regulation.\n\nFaced with severe restrictions proposed by the Federal Trade Commission, a spate of regulatory bills pending in Congress and a proposed code under consideration by the National Association of Broadcasters, cigarette companies decided last week to administer their own medicine.\n\nThey announced a selfregulatory code to be administered by an independent czar who would have total control over industry advertising. The code imposed limitations in three principal areas of cigarette advertising —appeals to youth, health claims and the so‐called virility theme.\n\nOn the youth issue, the code would ban cigarette ads from college media and from television shows directed mainly at persons under 21 years of age. On the health issue, the code bars claims involving health, filters, tars, resins and so forth unless the industry czar is satisfied that the claims can be verified.\n\n●The code also restricts the virility appeal by barring ads that show smokers indulging in athletic contests or that suggest that smoking is “essential to social prominence, distinction, success or sexual attraction.”\n\nBy the weekend it became clear that the code had picked up both firm proponents and opponents. Critics of the code argued that it failed to go far enough beyond the “suggestions” on cigarette advertising handed down last July by the Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group. Many of the ads barred by the present code—such as athletes' testimonials and college advertising—have been informally prohibited since last summer.\n\n“This is obviously just a grandstand play,” scoffed one agency president who had earlier announced that he would not accept any cigarette account.\n\nCritics also contend that the code's language is too vague. A proposed set of guidelines on cigarette advertising has been drawan up by the N.A.B.'s Code Authority containing language considerably more specific than that of the code, according to one source. But the N.A.B. code has now been set aside as a result of the tobacco industry's effort at self‐regulation. Tobacco companies spent $135 million on television advertising alone last year, so the broadcasters probably were just as happy to be taken off the hook.\n\nThe proposed N.A.B. guidelines, for example, attempted to define precisely what settings and dramatic situations would be permissible, while the tobacco companies' code speaks generally about this problem. Similarly, the tobacco companies' code states generally that cigarette companies should not advertise on shows aimed mainly at young people, without laying down precise hours during which advertising is permitted.\n\nSome people believe that it is imperative to set a precise definition of when cigarette ads should and should not be broadcast, such as exists in Britain. They note that, according to one F.T.C. study, as many as 12.6 million children each week watch early evening TV shows that have cigarette ads.\n\n●Aside from these questions, critics of the cigarette code believe that it evades the most important issue facing the industry — namely, the F.T.C. proposal that every cigarette ad and package be required to carry a warning that smoking is dangerous to health. Senator Maurine B. Neuberger, Democrat of Oregan, while favoring the code in general, said the absence of such a provision was a big “defect.” Paul Rand Dixon, chairman of the F.T.C., also is understood to feel that this warning is the most important objective.\n\nProponents of the code dismiss these protests and agree with Leroy Collins, president of the N.A.B., that it “contributes meaningfully to the future of the whole American free enterprise system.”\n\nThough the code's language may be general, they say, the still‐to‐be‐appointed industry czar will be empowered to interpret the language as he sees fit.\n\nThey point to the tobacco industry's promise that this czar will be “a person of recognized independence, integrity and intellectual achievement who shall not be connected with any tobacco manufacturer.”\n\nA top executive of one agency that handles a big cigarette account said:\n\n“This code took guts. Frankly I was astonished that this industry had the unity and determination to give such sweeping powers to an outside czar.”\n\n●Proponents of the code also refute the argument that precise hours should be set aside for cigarette advertising. The differing time zones across the country would make such a rule untenable, they argue. Moreover, they add, the important consideration is the nature of the program, not its time.\n\nWill the code forestall Government regulation? Some observers expressed the belief that the tobacco industry stands a good chance of escaping Government intervention. Others, however, note that Mr. Dixon of the F.T.C. still favors his proposed rules and that Mr. Dixon doesn't like to change his mind.\n\nAnd Mr. Dixon is by no means the only Government official who feels this way. Only three weeks ago Mrs. Esther Peterson, special assistant to the President on consumer affairs, urged a national advertising campaign to inform young people of the “dangers of smoking.” And the Public Health Institute also has indicated its intention to start some trial “educational efforts” aimed at dissuading youngsters from smoking.\n\nIn the teeth of these problems, most cigarette executives are still confident about their long‐term prospects. Joseph F. Cullman 3d, president of Philip Morris, Inc., predicted last week that the cigarette industry's unit sales would increase by “at least 15 per cent by 1970.” The industry, he said, has long demonstrated its “record of continuing growth and ability to adjust to attacks and changes in consumer demand.”\n\nDespite this confidence, the big cigarette makers had a trying period in the first quarter of 1964. Of the five leading companies, four reported declines in sales and four in earnings. The relatively undiversified companies suffered the most: P. Lorillard for example, sustained a 50 per cent decline in earnings compared with the 1963 level.\n\nZach Toms, president of the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, acknowledged that the Surgeon General's report on smoking had cast a cloud over the industry's prospects for the short term at least. “Any forecast must take into account the possible effect on sales of the report,” he said.\n\n●Given these financial setbacks and the establishment of a new code of standards governing advertising, would the cigarette industry curtail its advertising appropriations?\n\nMost observers thought not, though some speculated that the rate of increase of the last few years might taper off slightly. One study supplied to the F.T.C. showed that advertising expenditures of the six biggest companies between 1946 and 1960 soared from $46.4 million to $236.4 million —an increase of more than 400 per cent. Sales in the meantime went from $2.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Clearly no industry could sustain a prolonged increase of this magnitude."
