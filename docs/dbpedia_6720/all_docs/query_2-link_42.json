The PATH Study is a collaboration between the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study sampled over 150,000 mailing addresses across the United States to create a national sample of people who use or do not use tobacco.\n\n45,971 adults and youth constitute the first (baseline) wave, Wave 1, of data collected by this longitudinal cohort study. These 45,971 adults and youth along with 7,207 \"shadow youth\" (youth ages 9 to 11 sampled at Wave 1) make up the 53,178 participants that constitute the Wave 1 Cohort. Respondents are asked to complete an interview at each follow-up wave. Youth who turn 18 by the current wave of data collection are considered \"aged-up adults\" and are invited to complete the Adult Interview. Additionally, \"shadow youth\" are considered \"aged-up youth\" upon turning 12 years old, when they are asked to complete an interview after parental consent.\n\nAt Wave 4, a probability sample of 14,098 adults, youth, and shadow youth ages 10 to 11 was selected from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 4. This sample was recruited from residential addresses not selected for Wave 1 in the same sampled Primary Sampling Unit (PSU)s and segments using similar within-household sampling procedures. This \"replenishment sample\" was combined for estimation and analysis purposes with Wave 4 adult and youth respondents from the Wave 1 Cohort who were in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 4. This combined set of Wave 4 participants, 52,731 participants in total, forms the Wave 4 Cohort.\n\nAt Wave 7, a probability sample of 14,863 adults, youth, and shadow youth ages 9 to 11 was selected from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 7. This sample was recruited from residential addresses not selected for Wave 1 or Wave 4 in the same sampled PSUs and segments using similar within-household sampling procedures. This \"second replenishment sample\" was combined for estimation and analysis purposes with the Wave 7 adult and youth respondents from the Wave 4 Cohorts who were at least age 15 and in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 7 participants, 46,169 participants in total, forms the Wave 7 Cohort.\n\nPlease refer to the Restricted-Use Files User Guide that provides further details about children designated as \"shadow youth\" and the formation of the Wave 1, Wave 4, and Wave 7 Cohorts.\n\nDataset 0002 (DS0002) contains the data from the State Design Data.

The \"special collection all-waves\" weight files for the Wave 4 Cohort contain weights for participants who completed a Wave 7 interview and completed interviews (if old enough to do so) or verified their information (if not old enough to be interviewed) in Waves 4, 5, 6, and the special collections in Wave 4.5, and Wave 5.5 or PATH-ATS.\n\nThe \"cross-sectional\" weight files contain weights for all respondents in the Wave 7 Cohort.\n\nDataset 7401 (DS6401) contains the Wave 7 State Identifier data for Adults and has 5 variables and 30,801 cases. Dataset 7402 (DS7402) contains the Wave 7 State Identifier data for Youth and Parents, and has 5 variables and 10,834 cases. The same 5 variables are in each State Identifier dataset, including PERSONID for linking the State Identifier to the questionnaire and biomarker data and 3 variables designating the state (state FIPS, state abbreviation, and full name of the state). The State Identifier values in these datasets represent participants' state of residence at the time of Wave 7.\n\nDataset 7601 (DS7601) contains the Tobacco Universal Product Code (UPC) data from Wave 7. This data file contains 53 variables and 4,533 cases. This file contains UPC values on the packages of tobacco products used or in the possession of adult respondents at the time of Wave 7. The UPC values can be used to identify and validate the specific products used by respondents and augment the analyses of the characteristics of tobacco products used by these respondents at the time of Wave 7.\n\nEach case in an Adult data file represents a single, completed interview. Each case in a Youth data file represents one youth and his or her parent's responses about that youth. Parents who provided permission for their child to participate in a Youth Interview were asked to complete a brief interview about their child. In both waves of data collection, less than 0.5 percent of the parents did not complete an interview. Most questions are asked about the child.\n\nWhen multiple youth from the same household were selected to be in the study, the parent(s) completed separate interviews about each youth. If one parent completed two or more interviews, that parent only answered questions about himself/herself once. Those questions were then skipped in the subsequent interview(s) for the other child(ren) and the responses duplicated in that child(ren)'s data file(s).\n\nCitation View help for Citation\n\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services.

The study's primary objectives are to:\n\nObjective 1: Identify and explain between-person differences and within-person changes in tobacco-use patterns, including the rate and length of use by specific product type and brand, product/brand switching over time, uptake of new products, and dual- and poly-use of tobacco products (i.e., use of multiple products within the same time period and switching between multiple products).\n\nObjective 2: Identify between-person differences and within-person changes in risk perceptions regarding harmful and potentially harmful constituents, new and emerging tobacco products, filters and other design features of tobacco products, packaging, and labeling; and identify other factors that may affect use, such as social influences and individual preferences.\n\nObjective 3: Characterize the natural history of tobacco dependence, cessation, and relapse, including readiness and self-efficacy to quit, motivations for quitting, the number and length of quit attempts, and the length of abstinence related to various tobacco products.\n\nObjective 4: Update the comprehensive baseline and subsequent waves of data on tobacco-use behaviors and related health conditions, including markers of exposure and tobacco-related disease processes identified from the collection and analysis of biospecimens, to assess between-person differences and within-person changes over time in health conditions potentially related to tobacco use, particularly with use of new and different tobacco products, including modified-risk tobacco products.\n\nObjective 5: Assess associations between TCA-specific actions and tobacco-product use, risk perceptions and attitudes, use patterns, cessation outcomes, and tobacco-related intermediate endpoints (e.g., biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers related to disease). Analyses will attempt to account for other potential factors, such as demographics, local tobacco-control policies, and social, familial, and economic factors, that may influence the observed patterns.\n\nObjective 6: Assess between-person differences and within-person changes over time in attitudes, behaviors, exposure to tobacco products, and related biomarkers among and within population sub-groups identified by such characteristics as race-ethnicity, gender, and/or age, or by risk factors, such as pregnancy or co-occurring substance use or mental health disorders.\n\nObjective 7: To the extent to which sample sizes are sufficient, assess and compare samples of those who report former and never use of tobacco products for between-person differences and within-person changes in relapse and uptake, risk perceptions, and indicators of tobacco exposure and disease processes.\n\nObjective 8: Use data from the PATH Study's baseline and follow-up waves on tobacco-use behaviors, attitudes, and related health conditions, including potential markers of exposure and related disease processes identified from the analysis of biospecimens, to screen and subsample respondents for participation in formative and/or nested studies conducted during and after the PATH Study's waves of data and biospecimen collection.\n\nStudy Design View help for Study Design\n\nAt Wave 1, the study sampled over 150,000 mailing addresses which, using a four-staged stratified sampling design, yielded a sample of 45,971 respondents (32,320 adults / 13,651 youth) who completed a Wave 1 interview. People who use or do not use tobacco who were at least 9 years old living in a civilian, non-institutionalized setting were considered for participation during Wave 1. Youth who turn 18 by the next wave of data collection are considered \"aged-up adults\" and are invited to complete the Adult Interview. Additionally, 7,207 \"shadow youth\" (youth ages 9 to 11 sampled at Wave 1) are considered \"aged-up youth\" upon turning 12 years old when they are asked to join the study. These 53,178 participants form the Wave 1 Cohort.\n\nAt Wave 4, a probability sample of 14,098 adults, youth, and shadow youth ages 10 to 11 was selected from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 4. This sample was recruited from close to 174,000 mailing addresses not selected for Wave 1, in the same sampled PSUs and segments using similar within-household sampling procedures. To meet the needs for the Wave 4 Cohort shadow sample, a randomly selected subset of the sampled addresses (115,500 or close to two-thirds of the addresses) were screened solely to identify shadow youth ages 10 to 11. The remaining addresses (close to 58,500) were screened for adults, youth, and shadow youth ages 10 to 11. These are referred to as the \"SO\" (shadow youth only) and \"AYS\" (adults, youth, and shadow youth) replenishment samples, respectively. This replenishment sample was combined for estimation and analysis purposes with Wave 4 adult and youth respondents from the Wave 1 Cohort who were in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 4. This combined set of Wave 4 participants, 52,731 participants in total, forms the Wave 4 Cohort.\n\nAt Wave 7, a probability sample of 14,863 adults, youth, and shadow youth ages 9 to 11 was selected from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 7. This sample was recruited from close to 244,000 mailing addresses not selected for Wave 1 or Wave 4, in the same sampled PSUs and segments using similar within-household sampling procedures. To meet the needs for the Wave 7 youth sample and the need for a Wave 7 Cohort shadow sample, the address sample was randomly divided into three subsamples. A subset of about 111,500 addresses (or close to 45 percent) were screened solely to identify youth ages 9 to 14; another subset of about 97,000 addresses (or close to 40 percent) were screened to identify youth ages 9 to 17. The remaining addresses (close to 36,000) were screened for adults, youth, and shadow youth ages 9 to 11. These subsamples are referred to as the \"YYO\" (young youth only ages 9 to 14), \"YO\" (youth only ages 9 to 17) and \"AYS\" (adults ages 18 and above, youth ages 12 to 17, and shadow youth ages 9 to 11) replenishment samples, respectively. This replenishment sample was combined for estimation and analysis purposes with Wave 7 adult and youth respondents from the Wave 1 and Wave 4 Cohorts who were at least age 15 and in the civilian,and, in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time of Wave 7. This combined set of Wave 7 participants, 46,169 participants in total, forms the Wave 7 Cohort.\n\nThe Adult files contain a single record for every adult who completed an interview in the wave. The Youth/Parent files contain a single record of every youth who completed an interview in a given wave. Parents who provided permission for their child to complete a Youth Interview were asked to complete a brief Parent Interview that contained questions about parental supervision, school performance, and tobacco use by youth. The Parent Interview is primarily an interview about the child(ren), not the parent. Almost all youth respondents had a parent or guardian complete the Parent Interview (over 99.0 percent). When multiple youth from the same household were selected to be in the study, the parent(s) completed separate interviews about each youth. If one parent completed multiple interviews, then questions asked about him or her were only asked once and skipped in the other interview(s). The parent's responses were then duplicated for the other child or children.\n\nAll data were collected through in-person interviews in Waves 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For the continued safety of PATH Study participants and interviewers during the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection for Wave 6 began with telephone interviews only. As conditions improved in certain parts of the country, the PATH Study began in-person interviews with participants on May 7, 2021. All in-person contacts with participants were conducted in compliance with local and state restrictions for COVID-19 mitigation. Wave 6 data were collected with a mix of telephone and in-person interviews. Data collection for Wave 7 began with both telephone and in-person interviews. In addition, a pilot test was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of introducing Web versions of the PATH Study interviews. A sample of continuing adults, parents, and youth was selected to complete the Wave 7 data collection via the Web. Wave 7 data were collected with a mix of telephone, Web, and in-person interviews.\n\nA $2 incentive was mailed to all addresses sampled at Wave 1 and Wave 4 prior to screening. At Wave 7, a $2 incentive was mailed to all addresses in the AYS portion of the replenishment sample. Addresses in the YYO and YO portions of the replenishment sample were prepaid a $5 incentive along with invitation to complete the pre-screener on the Web, and an offer of an additional $5 for completing the online survey. All households that completed the pre-screener received the completion incentive: $5 if the pre-screener was returned via mail or if it was returned via the Web before the nonresponse follow-up mailing; $10 if the pre-screener was returned via the Web after the nonresponse follow-up mailing.\n\nAdult respondents were paid $35 for their participation in Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3, and Wave 4. In Wave 5, Wave 6, and Wave 7, adult respondents were paid $50 for their participation. In Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3, and Wave 4, youth were paid $25 to complete the Youth Interview, and their parents were given $10 for each Parent Interview. In Wave 5, Wave 6, and Wave 7, youth were paid $35 to complete the Youth Interview, and their parents were given $15 for each Parent Interview.\n\nSample View help for Sample\n\nA four-stage stratified area probability sample design was used in the PATH Study, with a two-phase design for sampling adults at the final stage. At the first stage, a stratified sample of geographical primary sampling units (PSUs) was selected, in which a PSU is a county or group of counties. For the second stage, within each selected PSU, smaller geographical segments were formed and then a sample of these segments was drawn. At the third stage, the sampling frame consisted of the residential addresses located in these segments. The fourth stage selected adults and youth from the sampled households identified at these addresses, with varying sampling rates for adults by age, race, and tobacco use status. Adults were sampled in two phases - Phase 1 sampling used information provided in the household screener and Phase 2 sampling used information provided by the adult in the Phase 2 screener at the beginning of the Adult Instrument.
