DATE: July 18, 1997. ADDRESSES: Copies of the full report are available from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room 130, 6th St. and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580. (202) 326-3222. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Phillip S. Priesman, Attorney, Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, 6th St. and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580. Telephone (202) 326- 2484. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These are the most recent test results of the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide levels of the smoke of domestic cigarettes reported by the FTC. This Report contains data on 1206 varieties of cigarettes manufactured and sold in the United States in 1994. The Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory (TITL), a private laboratory operated by the cigarette industry, conducted the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide testing for the widely-available domestic cigarette varieties. This testing was conducted under the review of a representative of the FTC through periodic unannounced inspections. TITL provided the results to the respective cigarette companies. The companies provided the data generated by TITL regarding their own brands to the FTC in response to compulsory process issued by the Commission. Cigarette smoke from generic, private label, and not- widely-available cigarettes was not tested by TITL, but was tested by the cigarette companies and provided under compulsory process to the FTC. The methodology, processes, and procedures that the companies and TITL employed are required to be the same as those the Commission has followed in the past. In October 1996, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) published the 7th monograph in its smoking and tobacco control series: ``The FTC Cigarette Test Method for Determining Tar, Nicotine, and Carbon Monoxide Yields of U.S. Cigarettes: Report of the NCI Expert Committee.'' In light of the concerns raised by the NCI conferees about the current system, the Commission is giving careful consideration to possible changes in the test method. By direction of the Commission. Donald S. Clark, Secretary. [FR Doc. 97-18990 Filed 7-17-97; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6750-01-M"
