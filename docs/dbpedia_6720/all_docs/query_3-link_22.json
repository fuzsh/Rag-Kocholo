        "text": "Tobacco smoking and working adults\n\nTobacco cigarette smoking is a leading cause of illness and death in the U.S. A recent study showed an estimated one in five working adults (33 million; 22%) used some form of tobacco. Cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product. The study showed cigarette smoking was highest among the following groups:\n\nWorkers with less than a high school education (24%)\n\nWorkers with no health insurance (26%)\n\nWorkers living below the federal poverty level (23%)\n\nWorkers aged 18–24 years (16%)\n\nCigarette smoking by workers was highest in the following industries and occupations:\n\nIndustries\n\nAccommodation and Food Service (24%)\n\nConstruction (23%)\n\nAdministrative and Support & Waste Management and Remediation Services (22%)\n\nOccupations\n\nConstruction and Extraction (26%)\n\nFood Preparation and Serving Related (25%)\n\nProduction (24%)\n\nWhen looked at by gender, 17% of working mend smoked cigarettes compared to 14% of working women.\n\nElectronic vaping products\n\nUsing emerging tobacco products, including hookah and electronic vaping products (EVPs) such as e-cigarettes, has increased in recent years. During 2017-2018, an estimated 5 million (3%) U.S. workers used e-cigarettes and was higher among workers than non-workers.\n\nE-cigarette use was highest among workers in the following industries and occupations:\n\nIndustries\n\nAccommodation and food services (7%)\n\nTransportation and warehousing (5%)\n\nRetail trade (5%)\n\nOccupations\n\nFood preparation and serving (7%)\n\nTransportation and material moving (6%)\n\nProtective service (5%)\n\nAs of March 2023, 17 states have passed laws that specifically prohibit using e-cigarettes in workplaces. Employers can enact policies that restrict smoking and using tobacco products at work. In a survey of U.S. employees, nearly half of respondents (48%) reported their employer had a written policy addressing e-cigarette use. The majority (74%) supported e-cigarette-free workplaces, including the majority of current e-cigarette users (54%).\n\nSecondhand smoke\n\nIn 2015, an estimated 20% of nonsmoking workers reported some exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke at work. Frequent exposure was reported to be 10% (twice a week or more).\n\nNon-smokers reporting highest exposures:\n\nRepair and maintenance workers (45%)\n\nTransportation workers (39%)\n\nPotential health risks to users or bystanders exposed to secondhand smoke from EVPs are still under investigation.\n\nSmokeless tobacco\n\nSmokeless tobacco includes:\n\nChewing tobacco\n\nDip\n\nSnuff\n\nSnus\n\nA study on workers using smokeless tobacco showed the following industries and occupations as being the highest:\n\nIndustries\n\nMining (14%)\n\nUtilities (9%)\n\nConstruction (8%)\n\nOccupations\n\nInstallation, Maintenance, and Repair (10%)\n\nConstruction and Extraction (9%)\n\nFarming, Fishing, and Forestry (9%)\n\nBecause the tobacco is not smoked, many perceive it as being safer than smoking. However, smokeless tobacco still contains highly addictive nicotine and many of the same harmful chemicals found in cigarettes. Smokeless tobacco can cause:\n\nMouth cancer\n\nEsophageal cancer\n\nOral disease\n\nSmokeless tobacco use may also increase the risk of death from heart disease and stroke.\n\nWorkplace smoke-free policies\n\nWorkplace smoking legislation has been adopted by 27 states and the District of Columbia. It requires non-hospitality workplaces, restaurants, and bars to be completely smoke-free. These statewide comprehensive smoke-free laws protect 59% of the U.S. population. The laws are in addition to local comprehensive smoke-free laws.\n\nIntervention and cessation program resources\n\nWorker health and well-being is vital for establishing a healthy and safe workforce. Addressing the risks of smoking and tobacco use in the workplace and providing cessation programs can improve overall health of individuals.\n\nPromote health through workplace tobacco policies!‎\n\nCurrent Intelligence Bulletin 67: Promoting Health and Preventing Disease and Injury Through Workplace Tobacco Policies is aimed at preventing occupational illness related to tobacco use and secondhand smoke. This report recommends that all workplaces become tobacco-free, and employers make tobacco cessation programs available to workers.\n\nThe following resources provide information on intervention and cessation programs and guidance for employers and employees.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nWorkplace Health Promotion - Workplace programs and policies to help reduce health risks and improve the quality of life for workers.\n\nSmoking & Tobacco Use - Guidance for tobacco users that includes information on nicotine dependence, the health benefits of quitting, and ways to quit.\n\nQuit Smoking - CDC's website provides smoking cessation information and resources for state tobacco control programs and public health professionals.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nSmokefree.gov - Guidance provided by the National Institutes of Health – National Cancer Institute for smoke-free support and information.\n\nAmerican Lung Association\n\nQuit Smoking - The American Lung Association provides extensive information on smoking facts, how to quit, and freedom from smoking."
