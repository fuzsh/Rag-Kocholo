        "text": "Study sample and methodology for data collection\n\nThe current study is part of a European Commission Horizon-2020 funded study entitled European Regulatory Science on Tobacco: Policy implementation to reduce lung diseases (EUREST-PLUSHCO-06-2015). The EUREST-PLUS Project aims to monitor and evaluate the impact of the implementing Acts of the TPD within the context of the FCTC and its implementation within Europe13. Using the methodology of The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC) Project, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among six European countries (Wave 1 6E)14. A nationally representative sample of 6011 cigarette smokers of age 18 years or older was collected from Germany (n=1003), Greece (n=1000), Hungary (n=1000), Poland (n=1006), Romania (n=1001), and Spain (n=1001). Ethics approval for data collection was provided for each national cohort by the corresponding local ethics committees and informed consent was received from all participants.\n\nData collection occurred between June 2016 and September 2016. According to Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), the geographic strata were NUTS2 regions (NUTS1 in Germany) crossed with degree of urbanization (urban, semi-urban, rural). Approximately 100 area clusters were sampled in each country, with the aim of obtaining 10 adult smokers per cluster. Clusters were allocated to strata proportionally to the population size for adults 18 years and older. Within each cluster, household addresses were sampled using a random walk design. One randomly selected male smoker and one randomly selected female smoker were chosen for interview from a sampled household where possible. Screening of households continued until the required number of smokers from the cluster had been interviewed. All interviews were conducted face-to-face by interviewers using tablets. Further details on the methodology of the 6E Survey can be found elsewhere13.\n\nDuring the data collection period (June–Sept. 2016), Greece had text warnings on tobacco packages, while Germany and Poland had just moved from text warnings to large pictorial warnings covering ≥50% of the front and back of the package in May 2016. Romania, Hungary and Spain had medium-size pictorial warning (<50% of the front and back of package) which had been in place since 2008 (Romania) or 2011 (Hungary and Spain); in Hungary since 20 August 2016, there may have been tobacco products with large pictorial warnings, but compared to all, probably only to a negligible extent (Table 1).\n\nMeasures\n\nKnowledge of health risks\n\nIn order to assess knowledge of the health risks of smoking, respondents were presented with nine diseases and conditions (heart disease, impotence, lung cancer, blindness, mouth cancer, throat cancer, stroke, emphysema, bronchitis) and were asked to state whether they believed the condition is caused by smoking. Respondents were also asked to state if they believed secondhand smoke caused lung cancer in non-smokers, heart attacks in non-smokers, and asthma in children. Knowledge of health risks was coded as 0=‘not caused by smoking/don’t know’ and 1=‘caused by smoking’. An index regarding knowledge of the health risks of smoking (KHR) was calculated by summing the standardized scores (z-scores calculated across all countries) of each participant’s responses to the questions pertaining to health risks of smoking.\n\nWarning label impact\n\nWarning label effects were measured using six indicators as in previous ITC surveys7,8,15-16. Each indicator was analyzed as a dichotomous measure of frequency. Warning label salience was assessed using two questions: 1) NOTICING: ‘in the last month, how often, if at all, have you noticed the warning labels on cigarette packages (1=very often or often; 0=sometimes, rarely, or never)?’, and 2) READING: ‘In the last month, how often, if at all, have you read or looked closely at the warning labels on cigarette packages (1=often; 0=never or once in a while)?’. THOUGHTS of harm were assessed with the following question: ‘to what extent, if at all, do the warning labels make you think about the health risks of smoking (1=a lot; 0=somewhat, a little, or not at all)?’. Thoughts of QUITTING were assessed with the question: ‘to what extent, if at all, do the warning labels on cigarette packs make you more likely to quit smoking (1=a lot; 0=somewhat, a little, or not at all)?’. FORGOING of cigarettes was assessed by asking: ‘in the last month, have the warning labels stopped you from having a cigarette when you were about to smoke one (1=many times, a few times, or once; 0=never)?’. AVOIDING was assessed: ‘in the last month, have you made any effort to avoid looking or thinking about the warning labels, such as covering them up, keeping them out of sight, using a cigarette case, avoiding certain warnings, or any other means (1=yes, 0=no)?’.\n\nThe Labels Impact Index (LII) was calculated using the methodology employed in several previous ITC reports7,8,15-17. The LII is a composite measure that combines four of the six warning label effectiveness indicators and then weighting and summing the standardized scores (z scores) using the following calculation: LII = (NOTICING × 1) + (THOUGHTS × 2) + (QUITTING × 2) + (FORGOING × 3). The LII was calculated using the original four/five-point scales of the individual measures of health warning effectiveness, not dichotomized. Higher LII scores indicate greater impact16.\n\nRespondents were also asked if they would like to have more, less or the same amount of information contained in the health warnings.\n\nDemographics and smoking behavior\n\nSociodemographic characteristics including country, age, gender, degree of urbanization (urban, semi-urban, rural), level of education (low, medium, high) and income level (low, medium, high) were assessed. Highest level of formal education completed categorized as: low (primary, lower pre-vocational secondary, middle pre-vocational secondary), moderate (secondary vocational, senior general secondary and pre-university) and high (higher professional and university Bachelor, university Masters). Due to the different income cut-off points across countries, income was categorized as low, medium, and high using standardized country-level cut-offs established by the ITC Project18 as follows: low income level (<€1750 for Germany, Greece and Spain; ≤150000 Ft for Hungary; ≤2000 zł for Poland; ≤1000 lei for Romania), moderate income (€1750 to €3000; 150001 Ft to 250000 Ft; 2001 zł to 4000 zł; 1001 lei to 2500 lei), and high income (>€3000, >250000 Ft, >4000 zł, >2500 lei). Smoking behavior included the assessment of number of cigarettes smoked per day (<10, 11–20, 21–30, >30).\n\nEffects of warning labels\n\nThe proportion of smokers who reported noticing warning labels ‘often or very often’ varied across countries (Table 5). Specifically, rates were lowest in Greece and Hungary, and highest in Romania and Poland where more than half of respondents reported they noticed the warnings. Less than one in five smokers declared that they read the warning labels often or very often, except in Romania where one-third of the smokers declared this.\n\nTable 5\n\nVariableOverallGermanyGreeceSpainRomaniaHungaryPoland% (SE)% (SE)% (SE)% (SE)% (SE)% (SE)% (SE) Noticing 38.3 (1.1) 30.7 (2.7) 21.4 (2.4) 36.6 (3.0) 56.5 (2.8) 25.2 (2.6) 59.2 (2.9) Reading 20.2 (0.9) 11.5 (1.5) 21.9 (2.5) 12.6 (1.2) 37.6 (2.9) 15.0 (2.3) 20.7 (2.4) Thoughts 5.6 (0.4) 4.7 (1.2) 5.1 (1.0) 5.1 (1.0) 12.8 (1.3) 3.0 (0.8) 3.3 (0.9) Quitting 4.0 (0.4) 3.2 (0.9) 2.5 (0.7) 2.4 (0.6) 10.6 (1.3) 1.4 (0.5) 3.9 (1.0) Foregoing 15.4 (0.8) 10.3 (1.5) 13.5 (1.7) 14.2 (2.2) 14.5 (1.7) 18.3 (2.3) 21.6 (2.6) Avoidance 13.3 (0.7) 9.9 (1.4) 14.2 (1.6) 19.9 (1.9) 16.5 (2.0) 9.2 (1.8) 10.4 (1.6)Saw quitting supports Helpline numberb 24.0 (1.0) 28.6 (2.3) 6.5 (1.3) 19.2 (2.4) 36.3 (2.6) 21.8 (3.0) 31.4 (2.4) Quitting websiteb 15.2 (0.8) 20.9 (2.1) 5.4 (1.1) 15.7 (1.7) 17.9 (1.9) 14.8 (2.3) 16.4 (1.9)Health Information Want more 14.4 (0.7) 8.4 (1.3) 23.5 (2.1) 14.9 (1.7) 25.1 (2.2) 3.0 (0.6) 11.9 (1.3) Want the same 63.1 (1.1) 46.5 (3.0) 63.8 (2.7) 61.2 (2.3) 60.6 (2.7) 72.2 (2.7) 74.3 (2.1) Want less 18.3 (0.9) 40.0 (3.0) 10.9 (1.7) 18.8 (2.0) 11.1 (1.3) 21.9 (2.5) 7.3 (1.4)Mean Score (SE) Label Impact Index (LII) -0.071 (0.147) -1.090 (0.327) -0.335 (0.364) -0.378 (0.318) 1.519 (0.343) -0.650 (0.378) 0.507 (0.422)\n\nThe percentage of smokers who recalled seeing a helpline number on cigarette packs was around 30% in Germany, Romania and Poland, but was lower than 22% in Hungary and Spain, while in Greece it was around 7%. Information regarding quitting websites was noticed on cigarette packs by about 15% of smokers in all countries, ranging from the highest in Germany (20.9%) to the lowest in Greece (5.4%).\n\nThe percentage of smokers who declared that the warning labels made them think ‘a lot’ about health risks or made them more likely to quit was less than 6% for all countries, except in Romania, where more than 10% declared this. In Germany, Greece, Spain and Romania, 15% or less of smokers declared that in the last 30 days warning labels made them refrain from smoking at least once, while the percentage in Hungary and Poland was around 20%.\n\nLII scores were lowest in Germany and Hungary, followed by Greece and Spain, and highest in Poland and Romania (Table 5). In all countries, except for Spain, the LII was higher among respondents who reported lower daily cigarette consumption (Table 6). In Poland, the LII was lower among people with lower educational level, while in Romania it was higher among those with low income. In Poland and Romania, it was lower among younger age groups, while in Greece a reverse situation was found. In Germany, urban residence was positively associated with a higher LII, while in Poland, the LII was lower among men.\n\nAround two-thirds of smokers reported they wanted the same amount of health information to appear on cigarette packages, with the exception of Germany where more than 40% of smokers reported wanting less information on warning labels.\n\nPrincipal findings\n\nThe findings of this study indicate that there are significant gaps in smokers’ understanding of the health risks of smoking across the six EU MS of the EUREST-PLUS ITC Survey. The vast majority of smokers were aware that smoking causes illnesses such as heart disease, lung and throat cancers. However, more than 20% of the smokers did not know that tobacco use causes mouth cancer, pulmonary diseases, and stroke. Smokers’ knowledge of the causal relationship between smoking and impotence and blindness was significantly lower. Importantly, with the exception of Romania, modest levels of knowledge of the health harms caused by exposure to secondhand smoke were observed across all six EU MS. These findings are similar to that of previous ITC reports for other countries4,19-21. All countries in the present study included health warning labels that address risk of heart attack, stroke, lung cancer, and impotence, and to a lesser extent messages regarding blindness, throat, or mouth cancers. Warning labels included non-specific or general messages in terms of lung disease but did not include specific messages related to emphysema or bronchitis. For the most part, warning labels did not include specific messages about health effects of secondhand smoke on heart disease and lung cancer or asthma in children. In general, levels of knowledge observed in countries for specific diseases and conditions corresponded to the specific warning labels’ messages in circulation.\n\nThere were several country-level differences documented, with Romania and Greece having a greater percentage of smokers who recognized the smoking health harms for most of the diseases/ conditions assessed and higher scores on the KHR index. The lowest KHR index scores were documented in Germany and Hungary. These trends did not necessarily correspond to strong health warning labels in these countries in 2016. Given that there are other sources of information on the health risks of smoking, including educational programs in schools, mass media, and medical advice, the higher rates of KHR scores documented in some countries are potentially the consequence of several activities, in addition to warning labels, however this requires further validation22-24. For instance, EUREST-PLUS Project findings show that there is an association between high exposure to mass media anti-smoking campaigns and increased knowledge of smoking health harms25. Moreover, in Hungary, despite the fact that pictorial warnings were used on tobacco packages, many smokers were using roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, and packaging of RYO rolling papers and filters, which had no health warning information prior to August 201626.\n\nSeveral sociodemographic factors were associated with KHR index scores although trends varied between countries sampled. In three countries (Germany, Hungary, Poland) women had higher KHR scores, while in Romania and Greece, older age was associated with better KHR scores.\n\nOur study found that only about one-third of smokers noticed warning labels often or very often, and only 20% read them often or very often. Approximately 5% of smokers declared that the warning labels made them think ‘a lot’ about health risks, or made them more likely to quit, and 15% reported warning labels made them refrain from smoking at least once. Seeing quitline and website information was reported at significantly lower rates in Greece, which is expected given this information did not appear on the warning labels in Greece in 2016 due to the non-existence of a National quitline.\n\nAdditionally, there was variability between countries with regard to health warnings’ impact on perceptions and actions of the smokers. For instance, Romania and Poland were the countries with the highest LII scores, while Germany and Hungary had the lowest scores. One potential explanation of the low LII score observed in Hungary could be that almost half of smokers in Hungary reported using roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, while packaging of RYO rolling papers and filters had no health warning information prior to August 201626. At the same time, the impact might vary between countries also as a consequence of type (only text or text and pictorials) and dimension of the health warning, and the type of messages2-9.\n\nThere was a correlation between higher daily cigarette consumption and lower LII scores. Other socioeconomic characteristics also influenced the LII at the country level. In Poland and Romania, the LII was higher among older age groups, while in Greece a reverse situation was observed. In Germany, urban residence was positively associated with a higher LII, while in Poland, the LII was higher among smokers with higher educational level. Other country-level factors, including the prevalence of tobacco use, characteristics of tobacco users and the extent to which comprehensive tobacco policies have been implemented are also expected to play a role in warning label effectiveness. As has been reported by others, it is possible that cultural factors, including receptivity to regulation, may play a role in explaining part of the differences observed between countries27,28.\n\nIn almost all countries, a significant positive relationship was documented between a KHR and LII scores. Romania and Germany being the countries where this relationship was evident for 10 or 11 of the 12 investigated health risks, while in the other countries the LII scores were associated with the level of knowledge for at least three health risks.\n\nLimitations and strengths\n\nWhile this study has many strengths with a large sample size of smokers across six nationally representative EU MS, findings should be interpreted in light of study limitations. First, the study used a cross-sectional design, which allows for the exploration of association rather than causality. The study included only current smokers and as such does not reflect individuals who recently quit smoking. The results are also based on participant self-report that may be subject to respondent and measurement bias. The present study examined variables prior to the implementation of the EU TPD and in some countries large pictorial warnings had been introduced just prior to our assessment and may not be sufficient to measure the effects of warning label changes in these countries. Likewise, KHR may have been influenced by other sources of education including mass media, which were not examined as part of this study. Given that the above warnings differed across countries including the size and health effects featured, some country level differences would be expected that were not controlled for in the analysis. In addition, there are other individual-level factors (e.g. nicotine addiction, presence of smoking-related illness or mental health illness) that might influence outcomes of interest that were not examined as part of this study.\n\nNevertheless, this study is the only one of its kind to provide a comprehensive baseline of the impact of health warning labels on smokers’ knowledge and smoking behaviors across multiple EU MS prior to the full implementation of the EU TPD, which will then be used to evaluate the impact of health warning provisions in a post-TPD assessment."
