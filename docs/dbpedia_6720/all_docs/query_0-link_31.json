After early increases, e-cigarette use and initiation peaked with the 2005 birth cohort. These patterns are in contrast with the continuous decreases by cohort in cigarette, cigar, and smokeless use and initiation. As the tobacco product landscape continues to evolve, it will be essential to monitor patterns of use of adolescent and young adult cohorts as they age into adulthood.\n\nAUTHORS: Rossana Torres-Alvarez, Jihyoun Jeon, David T Levy, Rafael Meza JOURNAL: Preventive medicine.\n\nPOSTED: Mon June 24, 2024\n\nRead this publication »\n\nFeatured News\n\n“Oral nicotine pouches deliver lower levels of toxic substances than smoking - but that doesn’t mean they’re safe”\n\nOral nicotine pouches - like Zyn and Velo in the U.S. - appear to be less toxic than cigarettes and deliver comparable levels of nicotine. This makes them an alternative for people who smoke. However, people who’ve never smoked are using them, too, and youth are open to trying them. These are key findings of our recent systematic review, published in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research.\n\nPOSTED: Mon Jun 17, 2024\n\nRead this article on the Conversation »\n\nFeatured Publication\n\n“The Potential Impact of Oral Nicotine Pouches on Public Health: A Scoping Review”\n\nONPs appear to be less toxic than cigarettes and deliver comparable nicotine, presenting an alternative for combustible product users, although key data are mainly available from industry-funded studies. Data from independent research is critically needed. Industry marketing of ONPs may encourage initiation in youth and situational and dual use in adults.\n\nAUTHORS: Nargiz Travis, MScPH, Kenneth E Warner, PhD, Maciej L Goniewicz, PhD, Hayoung Oh, MPH, Radhika Ranganathan, MScPH, Rafael Meza, PhD, Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, PhD, David T Levy, PhD JOURNAL: Nicotine & Tobacco Research.\n\nPOSTED: Mon Jun 17, 2024\n\nRead this publication »\n\nFeatured News\n\n“A Quarter of Smokers Quit Under Menthol Bans, Study Finds” in the New York Times\n\nIn a study in 2021 that used a model to assess the effects of a menthol ban, David Levy, a Georgetown University oncology professor, found that it could lead to an overall reduction in smoking of about 15 percent. By 2060, the study projected, as many as 11 million years of life could be gained rather than lost to smoking-related deaths.\n\n“These effects are delayed, but nevertheless important.”— CAsToR Principal Investigator David Levy, PhD\n\nTAGS: #MentholBan\n\nPOSTED: Mar 4, 2024\n\nRead this article on NYTimes.com »\n\nFeatured News\n\n“A quarter of smokers quit within a year or two of menthol bans” on CNN\n\n“It adds to the already very compelling evidence that banning menthol would result in fewer people smoking cigarettes and provide higher public health benefits, especially for populations that have pretty high rates of use, particularly Black Americans. There’s just more and more evidence every day that it would be a good idea to do a ban.” — CAsToR Principal Investigator Rafael Meza, PhD\n\nTAGS: #MentholBan\n\nPOSTED: Feb 21, 2024\n\nRead this article on CNN.com »\n\nFeatured News\n\n“Most Americans Are Quitting Smoking—Except For Those Over 65” in Time magazine\n\nPublic health campaigns and programs outlining the dangers of smoking aren’t really aimed at older adults, says Rafael Meza, an integrative oncologist at the BC Cancer Research Institute in Vancouver and the lead author of a new study on adult smoking. “In the U.S., smoking really has a generational pattern,” he says. Meza’s new analysis, published Dec. 1 in JAMA Health Forum, shows that while people ages 40 through 64 smoke the most, Americans 65 and above are picking up the habit in a way nobody else is. While the prevalence of regular smokers dropped to 15.2% down from 21.2% in a little over a decade for that middle-aged group, older adults saw an increase from 8.7% to 9.4% in the same time frame.\n\nPOSTED: Dec 7, 2023\n\nRead this article in Time magazine »\n\nFeatured Preprint\n\n“Changing patterns of cigarette and ENDS transitions in the USA: a multistate transition analysis of adults in the PATH Study in 2017-2019 vs 2019-2021”\n\nUnderstanding product transitions is key to determining the likely public health benefit or harm of ENDS. If ENDS promote cigarette cessation, reduced smoking, or divert those who would have otherwise smoked, there would be a benefit to public health.However, there remain concerns about youth initiation, particularly as many flavors are targeted to youth, as well as concerns that ENDS may interfere with long-term cigarette cessation because of continued or enhanced nicotine addiction.\n\nAUTHORS: Andrew F Brouwer, Jihyoun Jeon, Evelyn Jimenez-Mendoza, Stephanie R Land, Theodore R Holford, Abigail S Friedman, Jamie Tam, Ritesh Mistry, David T Levy, Rafael Meza JOURNAL: medRxiv.\n\nPOSTED: Mon October 23, 2023\n\nRead this preprint »\n\nFeatured Preprint\n\n“E-cigarette Flavor Restrictions’ Effects on Tobacco Product Sales”\n\nOver 375 US localities and 7 states have adopted permanent restrictions on sales of flavored electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”). These policies’ effects on combustible cigarette use (“smoking”), a more lethal habit, remain unclear. Matching new flavor policy data to retail sales data, we find a tradeoff of 15 additional cigarettes for every 1 less 0.7 mL ENDS pod sold due to ENDS flavor restrictions. Further, cigarette sales increase even among brands disproportionately used by underage youth. Thus, any public health benefits of reducing ENDS use via flavor restrictions may be offset by public health costs from increased cigarette sales.\n\nAUTHORS: Abigail Friedman, Alex C.

Cigarette pack years, by contrast, remained associated with a net increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease incidence risk. These findings highlight the importance of using prospective longitudinal data and adequately controlling for cigarette smoking history to assess the independent health effects of ENDS.\n\nAUTHORS: Steven F.
