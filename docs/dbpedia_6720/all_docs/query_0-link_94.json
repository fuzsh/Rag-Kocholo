        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nTobacco consumption is a major contributing and risk factor and the 6th leading cause of death globally1. Smokeless tobacco is consumed in an unburnt form and has been widely used orally or through nasal inhalation2. Smokeless tobacco products have differences in their composition, preparation, and toxicity, but they all consisting of a nicotine alkaloid3. The chemical constituents or main ingredients present in the smokeless tobacco products are nicotine, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA), nitrosamine acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aldehydes, and heavy metals4. Globally, the consumption of smokeless tobacco is largely concentrated in India and Bangladesh. These two countries have 80% of the 300 million smokelesstobacco users worldwide5,6. The tobacco industry invests half a billion dollars annually to promote the manufacture of SLT products, twice as much as earlier7,8. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a rule to reduce the amount of tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines in SLT products in the United States due to their carcinogenic activity9.\n\nSmokeless tobacco users who dip or chew 8–10 times a day might ingest a similar amount of nicotine as cigarette smokers who smoke 30–40 cigarettes per day10,11. The consumption of smokeless tobacco is higher due to the greater social acceptance, curiosity, and culture, which are influencing factors for SLT initiation and prevalence. About 35–40% of tobacco consumption in India is in smokeless tobacco forms, most of which is Nicotiana rustica, while most smoking tobacco is Nicotiana tabacum12. There are several types of chewing habits like the use of betel quid, khaini, mawa, panmasala plain without tobacco, and gutkha13. Promotion of SLT use has increased as non-users start to use SLT, which serves as an alternative to smoking and leads to dual-users of tobacco14,15 with the number of consumers increasing annually.\n\nTo combat the above epidemic, the Indian government has introduced warning labels for cigarettes or other tobacco products16. Tobacco warning labels are a useful tobacco control tool, however research has shown that attention to warnings and exposure to current health warning labels is lowest among individuals with lower education and income17,18. Health warnings on product packaging are a costeffective, population-wide strategy to inform populations about the health risks associated with tobacco consumption19.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to examine the reported composition, characteristics and manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products in India."
