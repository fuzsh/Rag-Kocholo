        "text": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have awarded the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science (TCORS) $18.6 million to further research into tobacco product regulations.\n\nThe center is led by Kurt Ribisl, PhD, program leader of cancer prevention and control at UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Jo Anne Earp Distinguished Professor and chair of the Department of Health Behavior at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nUNC TCORS was launched at UNC Lineberger in 2013 and is one of seven institutions to receive a grant in the current round of funding by the FDA Center for Tobacco Products in partnership with the NIH. This is the third cohort of the multidisciplinary TCORS, which will continue the work of providing scientific studies that inform FDA’s regulatory authority for tobacco products.\n\nUNC TCORS research\n\nUNC TCORS currently has four active research projects:\n\nThis integrated set of four research projects seeks to understand the impact of regulations and communication campaigns on people who are disadvantaged by tobacco use disparities, including Black, lower socioeconomic status, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) populations, as well as youth and young adults.\n\nThe center also is home to a Career Enhancement Core led by Goldstein and Shelley Golden, PhD, associate professor of health behavior and UNC Lineberger member. The core aims to train 30 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career faculty.\n\nThis interdisciplinary project’s work on the successful grant proposal was supported by Krysta Gougler-Reeves, MSW, MPH, project director at UNC Lineberger.\n\n“The theme of our UNC TCORS is building the science for effective regulation of and communication about tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, menthol cigarettes and flavored cigarillos that are disproportionately used by priority populations, such as lower income, Black and LGBT individuals and youth,” Ribisl said. “Tobacco products cause 480,000 premature deaths in the United States each year. The results from our UNC research projects will inform current and future FDA regulations that will reduce the amount of death and disability caused by tobacco products.”"
