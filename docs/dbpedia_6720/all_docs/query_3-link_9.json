        "text": "The second half of the 20th century saw a more intense effort to limit smoking. It came under even more scrutiny in the 1990s once activities of the tobacco companies like Brown & Williamson became more widely known and many legal cases were filed around the country.\n\nHearings were held in 1994 and 1998, and the Master Settlement Agreement that was agreed to in November 1988. The Settlement was originally between the four largest United States tobacco companies (Philip Morris Inc., R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard as the \"original participating manufacturers\") and the attorneys general of 46 states. The agreement settled the many lawsuits that had been brought against the various companies.\n\nWe have not included all of the material related to the settlement, but have included some material from the hearings and documents that came out of the Settlement. They contain information that is important to understanding how individuals companies operated and can be quite valuable in terms of understanding the history of industry. If you search the catalog, use tobacco settlement to find items that are national in scope as well as materials produced by, or of interest to, a particular state."
