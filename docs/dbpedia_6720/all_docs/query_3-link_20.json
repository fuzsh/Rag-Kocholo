        "text": "Tobacco products are one of the most heavily marketed consumer products in the U.S. In 2022, the latest year for which information is available, the five largest cigarette manufacturers spent a total of $8.01 billion—or close to $22 million dollars a day—to promote and advertise their products. The five largest smokeless tobacco manufacturers spent $572.7 million on advertising and promotion in 2022.1\n\nOnly a few states are funding their tobacco control programs at the levels currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), meaning that tobacco company marketing efforts are largely occurring without effective, well-funded state tobacco control programs to respond."
