        "text": "For most of the past 100 years, cigarette manufacturers have told smokers that their products were not proven to be injurious to health (8-10). In fact, cigarette companies frequently implied to consumers that their brands were safer than their competitor's brands because the smoke was less irritating, smoother, and milder (11). Ironically, making cigarette smoke lighter, milder, and less irritating caused smokers to inhale the smoke more deeply into their lungs, thereby negating any health benefit that might have been gained by altering the product (12-14). The question of when tobacco companies knew or should have known about the serious health consequences of smoking goes to the very question of whether or not there was a real cigarette controversy.\n\nEvidence linking smoking and cancer appeared in the 1920s (15). Between 1920 and 1940, a chemist named Angel Honorio Roffo published several articles showing that cancers could be experimentally induced by exposure to tars from burned tobacco (16). Roffo et al. further showed that cancer could be induced by using nicotine-free tobacco, which means that tar, with or without nicotine, was carcinogenic. Research implicating smoking as a cause of cancer began to mount during the 1950s, with several landmark publications in leading medical journals (17-23). The first official U.S. government statement on smoking and health was issued by the Surgeon General Leroy Burney in a televised press conference in 1957, wherein he reported that the scientific evidence supported cigarette smoking as a causative factor in the etiology of lung cancer (24, 25). By 1960, Joseph Garland, Editor of the New England Journal, wrote, “No responsible observer can deny this association, and the evidence is now sufficiently strong to suggest a causative role” (26).\n\nIn their public statements, tobacco companies held that cigarettes had not been proven to be injurious to health. For example, a November 1953 press release issued by the American Tobacco Company stated, “…no one has yet proved that lung cancer in any human being is directly traceable to tobacco or its products in any form” (27). In a New York Times story based on this press release, the headline states that Mr. Hahn (President of the American Tobacco Company) characterizes the evidence of a link between cigarette smoking and an increase in the incidence of lung cancer as “Loose Talk” (28). In 1954, Philip Morris Vice President George Weissman announced that if the company had any thought or knowledge that in any way we were selling a product harmful to consumers, that they would stop business immediately (29). Senior scientists and executives at tobacco companies, however, knew about the potential cancer risk of smoking as early as the 1940s, and most accepted the fact that smoking caused cancer by the late 1950s (30-34).\n\nA 1939 memorandum from the American Tobacco Company Research Director Hiram Hanmer noted, “We have been following Roffo's work for some time, and I feel that it is rather unfortunate that a statement such as his [implicating smoking in cancer] is widely disseminated” (30). A few years later, H.B. Parmele, a scientist working for the Lorillard Tobacco Company, wrote a report to the company's manufacturing committee observing that, “Certain scientists and medical authorities have claimed for many years that the use of tobacco contributes to cancer development in susceptible people. Just enough evidence has been presented to justify the possibility of such a presumption…benzpyrene is presumed to be a combustion product of burning tobacco and, by animal experiments, it has been shown to possess definite carcinogenic properties” (31). In 1953, a chemist at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Claude Teague, produced a literature survey on smoking and cancer referencing 78 articles, which offered the following conclusion: “…studies of clinical data tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and prolonged tobacco smoking and incidence of cancer of the lung” (32). Three scientists from the British American Tobacco Company reported in 1958 on the results of a visit to the United States, investigating the extent to which tobacco industry and non-industry scientists accepted the premise that cigarette smoke was a cause of lung cancer (33). Their report concludes that “With one exception [HSN Green from Yale University] the individuals with whom we met believed that smoking causes lung cancer, if by ‘causation’ we mean any chain of events which leads finally to lung cancer and which involves smoking as an indispensable link” (33).\n\nIn 1961, the Arthur D. Little Company provided a confidential report to Liggett and Myers Tobacco Company, which stated that there are “biologically active materials present in cigarette tobacco. These are: a) cancer causing; b) cancer promoting; and c) poisonous” (34). A 1961 presentation to the R&D committee at Philip Morris acknowledged that there was evidence that smoking may be a causative factor in lung cancer and included a partial list of carcinogens identified in cigarette smoke (35). A 1962 report by the R.J. Reynolds scientist Dr. Alan Rodgman characterized the amount of evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoking as a health risk as “overwhelming,” whereas the evidence challenging such an indictment was “scant” (36).\n\nIn summary, internal industry documents reveal that the tobacco companies knew and for the most part accepted the evidence that cigarette smoking was a cause of cancer by the late 1950s.\n\nScientists were the perfect foil for the tobacco industry's public relations response to allegations that cigarette smoking was injurious to health. Scientists could be counted on to call for more research, giving the impression that there was controversy. In addition, by supporting scientific research, the industry would be seen as doing something positive to address the serious allegations that smoking was harmful (43).\n\nThe “Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers” informed the public that the tobacco industry “will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health” and to support independent research into all phases of tobacco use and health. According to a TIRC press release, the purpose of the organization was to “…encourage and support qualified research scientists in their efforts to learn more about smoking and health” (44). However, in the first year of operation, the TIRC did not fund any independent research, instead used the resources to mount an aggressive public relations campaign (45). In 1955, Dr. Clarence Little, the first Scientific Director of TIRC, appeared on the Edward R. Murrow show and was asked, “Dr. Little have any cancer-causing agents been identified in cigarettes?” Dr. Little replied, “No. None whatever, either in cigarettes or in any product of smoking, as such.” Dr. Little was also asked, “Suppose the tremendous amount of research going on were to reveal that there is a cancer causing agent in cigarettes, what then?” Dr. Little replied, “It would be made public immediately and just as broadly as we could make it, and then efforts would be taken to attempt to remove that substance or substances” (46).\n\nHowever, by the late 1950s, it was becoming increasing difficult for the TIRC to appear free from the influence of tobacco manufacturers. It was for this reason in 1958 that the communications committee of the TIRC split off to form the TI. The TI charter listed the following among its duties: dissemination of scientific and medical material related to tobacco, cooperating with governmental agencies and public officials with reference to the tobacco industry, and promoting the public good will (47). Over its 40-year history (1958-1998), the TI was the collective voice of the tobacco industry. In 1958, the TI started its operation with just four people but increased to a staff of 32 by the mid-1970s (48). Budget documents reveal that the funding sources and management structure of TIRC and TI were essentially the same (49).\n\nThe Surgeon General's 1964 Report on Smoking and Health left little doubt about whether smoking was harmful to health; yet, the tobacco companies continued to insist that the case against smoking was unproven. However, tobacco companies also recognized it was becoming increasing difficult for them to suggest that they were supporting independent research on smoking and health given their financial stake in the outcome. In an effort to create a perception of independence from the tobacco companies 1 month after the Surgeon General issued his first report on smoking and health, the TIRC changed its name to CTR (50). However, the management of CTR remained intact, and evidence shows that industry lawyers started to exert greater control over how CTR research funds were expended (4, 51-54).\n\nFrom 1964 onward, the TI frequently made reference to the fact that qualified scientists challenged the evidence that smoking caused disease. Yet, many of these so-called independent scientists were recruited and had their research programs supported by the tobacco industry through the TIRC/CTR (55, 56). For example, in 1970, the TI sponsored the “Truth” public service campaign that informed the public that there was a scientific controversy about whether smoking caused disease (57-59). The “Truth” campaign encouraged people to contact the TI to get a copy of a “White Paper” that included quotes from scientists challenging the evidence that smoking caused the disease. Lawyer-controlled “special project accounts” were used to recruit and support scientists who were willing to make statements and/or conduct research that would be favorable to the industry's view that causes other than smoking were responsible for lung cancer and other diseases (51-54).

Reynolds Tobacco Company (76) “[d]espite all the research going on, the simple and unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know the cause or causes of the chronic diseases reported to be associated with smoking.”\n\nAlthough TIRC and CTR did fund legitimate peer reviewed research on cancer and other tobacco-related health issues, much of the research that was supported was far removed from addressing the question of whether cigarette smoking caused cancer or other diseases. Evidence that CTR funded research projects had little to do with smoking and health was confirmed in a 1989 survey of CTR-funded scientists, which asked grantees if their research had anything to do with understanding the relationship between smoking and health. Only one of six scientists responded affirmatively to this question (60).\n\nInternal documents from the industry acknowledge that TIRC/CTR was largely a public relations asset for them rather than a real research endeavor to address the smoking and health controversy (51-54). A 1970 letter from Helmut Wakeham, then Vice President of the Corporate Research and Development at Philip Morris, to the President of the TI summed up this view: “nobody believes we are interested in the truth on this subject; and the fact that a multi-billion dollar industry has put up 30 million dollars for this over a ten-year period cannot be impressive to a public which at the same time is told we spend upwards of 300 million dollars in one year on advertising” (61).\n\nThe tobacco company conspiracy to manufacture a false controversy about smoking and health is summarized in a 1972 TI memorandum, which defined the strategy as consisting of three parts: (a) “creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it”; (b) “advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice”; and (c) “encouraging objective scientific research as the only way to resolve the question of the health hazard” (62). In her analysis of the purpose of the industry's jointly funded “research” organizations, Judge Kessler observed that the TI, TIRC, CTR, and CIAR helped the industry achieve its goals because they “sponsored and funded research that attacked scientific studies demonstrating harmful effects of smoking cigarettes but did not itself conduct research addressing the fundamental questions regarding the adverse health effects of smoking” (ref. 8, see pages 1532-33).\n\nIn summary, the internal industry documents show how tobacco companies deliberately confused the public debate about smoking and health by creating and supporting research organizations that were never really interested in discovering the truth about whether smoking was a cause of disease."
