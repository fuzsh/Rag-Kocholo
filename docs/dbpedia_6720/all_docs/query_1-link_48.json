        "text": "We never stand still. We are always innovating, experimenting, and delivering newÂ Tobacco Harm ReductionÂ solutions. This is why our Research and Development is so important to the business, accelerating pioneering approaches to scientific innovation.\n\nÂ\n\nDemonstrating the reduced-risk status, compared to smoking, of non-combustible products can only be achieved through science.Â\n\nÂ\n\nItâs why we invest almost Â£350 million a year to find innovative new ways to contribute to Tobacco Harm Reduction, and aim to have 50 million consumers of our non-combustible products by 2030.The main focus of this investment is in our RRPs*â .\n\nÂ\n\nTesting our products: our nine-step risk assessment framework\n\nÂ\n\nAs alternative tobacco and nicotine products are relatively new to the market, they lack the long-term epidemiological data, observed over many years, that could show the overall impact on public health. That is why itâs necessary to take a weight of evidence approach, using the best available data to draw conclusions.\n\nÂ\n\nUsing the work of the U.S. Institute of Medicine, BAT developed a nine-step scientific assessment framework. The framework evaluates the emissions, exposure and risk of our New Category products and compares them to smoking cigarettes or other comparators, such as nicotine replacement therapy.\n\nÂ\n\nThe graph shows the weight of importance of each of the steps in demonstrating the reduced-risk*â potential of the alternative tobacco and nicotine products.\n\nÂ\n\nUsing this framework, our scientists have conducted and published more than 210 peer-reviewed studies on our New Category products assessing different aspects. In addition to our own research, our scientists are constantly monitor and review external publications to ensure they have a holistic view of the evidence base.\n\nÂ\n\nA weight of evidence approach to assess risk\n\nÂ\n\nTo further consumer choice, we have three New Categories â Vapour Products, Tobacco Heating Products and Modern Oral Products. All adhere to strict product quality standards, undergoing thousands of hours of testing before they reach the consumer.\n\nÂ\n\nOur commitment\n\nÂ\n\nItâs our job to demonstrate the positive effects our research can have. We place great value on robust, evidence-based and independent scientific findings and we think our science should be judged on its merits.\n\nThere are several myths around tobacco and nicotine products that only science can help to dispel. For example, itâs now widely acknowledged that itâs largely the toxicants in tobacco smoke which cause the majority of smoking-related disease â and not the nicotine in tobacco.\n\nÂ\n\nThe challenges\n\nÂ\n\nWe are working to develop reduced-risk* products and to secure the support of public health professionals and regulators as we bring them to market.\n\nÂ\n\nTobacco companies, scientists and regulators need to work together to ensure a science-based approach to assessing new products that potentially pose less risk than conventional cigarettes. This will provide consumers with the assurance that the product information they receive is based on sound, evidence-based science and allow them to make an informed choice based on the risk profile of different products.\n\nÂ\n\nAnimal testing\n\nWe do not routinely test our ingredients or products on animals. We have invested many years in the research and development of suitable alternatives aimed at developing non-animal based in vitro tests within our research centres and with external research organisations.Â\n\nÂ\n\nThe vast majority of our assessments relies on scientific literature, chemical analyses and/or by using in vitro techniques including human 3D tissues, systems biology and cutting edge robotics. Where there is no recognised alternative, animal testing may be necessary to meet safety, legal and / or regulatory requirements.\n\nÂ\n\nWe have received recognition from the PETA International Science Consortium Ltd for our significant contribution to help advance non-animal testing."
