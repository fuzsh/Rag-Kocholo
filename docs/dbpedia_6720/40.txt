The Institute for Global Tobacco Control's mission is to prevent death and disease from tobacco products by generating evidence to support effective tobacco control interventions. Operating within the three-pillar framework of (1) knowledge generation, synthesis and translation, (2) evaluation and surveillance, and (3) capacity building, IGTC's goal is to reduce tobacco use globally. OUR WORK The instituteâ€™s work supports tobacco control action in countries around the world. The institute has received recognition for its work and achievements by being designated as a partner in the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use since 2006 and a Collaborating Centre of the World Health Organization since 2004. As a key player in the tobacco control arena, IGTC has trained hundreds of professionals through capacity building programs and produced more than 100 articles in peer-reviewed academic journals. The institute has also been involved in the development of key resources for tobacco control policy development and implementation. Among these are the Global E-cigarette Policy Scan, how-to guides on assessing compliance with Tobacco Advertising, Promotion and Sponsorship (TAPS) bans (in collaboration with CTFK and The Union), and our State of Evidence reviews, as well as fact sheets and the Tobacco Pack Surveillance System (TPackSS) website.
