About The Institute for Nicotine & Tobacco Studies

The Institute for Nicotine & Tobacco Studies (INTS) is one of the nation’s leading tobacco focused research centers. It seeks to reduce and ultimately eliminate tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in New Jersey, the US, and globally. INTS does this via research that informs interventions, regulations, and policies; the delivery of evidence-based tobacco treatment; dissemination of research findings to key stakeholders; and training of tobacco treatment providers and the next generation of tobacco control researchers.

Over the past two decades, the Center has been awarded approximately $50 million in extramural funding. INTS also serves the citizens of the state and has treated over 7,000 smokers in New Jersey. INTS’s continuing education program has broad reach – over 3,000 clinicians have been trained as tobacco treatment specialists from all 50 states and over 11 countries.

Five Centers or Programs currently operate at the Institute.
