Founded in 1998, the Institute for Global Tobacco Control works to build the evidence base informing efforts to effectively end the tobacco epidemic as soon as possible. We strive to produce and assemble the best available information to empower policymakers and public health professionals to implement policy changes to prevent tobacco-caused death and disease.

We are a partner in the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use, a collaborating centre of the World Health Organization, and our talented, dedicated team is core to our work and our mission.
