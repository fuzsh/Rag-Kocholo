        "text": "Graham Harman finally comes up with a nickname for himself.\n\nHere is Graham “The Sniper” Harman in action:\n\nThe French philosopher and novelist Tristan Garcia was born in Toulouse in 1981. This makes him rather young to have written such an imaginative work of systematic philosophy as Forme et objet, the latest entry in the MétaphysiqueS series at Presses universitaires de France. But this reference to Garcia’s youthfulness is not a form of condescension: by publishing a complete system of philosophy in the grand style, he has already done what none of us in the older generation of speculative realists has done so far. His book is sophisticated, erudite, rigorous, imaginatively rich, and abundant in worldly wisdom– despite the author’s conclusion that wisdom does not exist.\n\nAlways on to some new untranslated work that will forever change philosophy and so on. Reading new books that no one read yet and praising them to heavens. Beautiful.\n\nQuestion: Can I publish the same article twice?\n\nAnswer: Of course you can. You can publish the same article thrice. Some scholars publish the same article (or the same book) over and over again their entire life. No need to worry about this, kid.\n\nQuestion: Post Hegelian philosophy?\n\nAnswer: There is no such thing. Whoever told you to look it up is an idiot – punch him in the face.\n\nQuestion: If you can put your five finders through it…\n\nAnswer: …it’s not an object anymore – contact your local object-oriented philosopher to inquire about what to do next.\n\nQuestion: Learning German to read Hegel…\n\nAnswer: …is a waste of your time. It will take most of your life and by the time you are good at it, you’ll realize you wasted most of your life on a useless skill. It’s like learning French to read Derrida or learning Russian to read Dostoevsky. Get a life!\n\nInteresting piece at Salon about wages, unions and workers:\n\nAs Oil Can Eddie pointed out, a class consciousness discourages office workers from unionizing. There’s a popular discounting company in Chicago called Groupon, where the account executives — who are all expected to have bachelors’ degrees — earn $37,800 a year. Adjusted for modern dollars, that’s about Stanley’s starting wage, without overtime. Because they’re educated and sit safely at desks, they don’t think of themselves as blue-collar mopes who need to strike for higher pay and better working conditions."
