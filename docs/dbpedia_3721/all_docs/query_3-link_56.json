        "text": "The week of February 24, 2024 was Oscar Isaac inspiring unholy thoughts while wearing Fear of God; the ravenous black hole eating a sun a day; and yes, we cried during Young Jeezy’s Tiny Desk. What, you didn’t?\n\nThe Mash-Up Americans:\n\nToday’s the first full moon of the lunar year (once a huge holiday in places like Korea, but alas, now outshined by LNY), so it’s fitting that we’re thinking back to our chat with astrologer extraordinaire Chani Nicholas. Let’s bring our goals to fruition!, too).\n\nMash-Ups In The News:\n\nLessons From My Father, Alexey Navalny\n\nTED\n\nThe message of this four-month-old TED Talk from Dasha Navalnaya, daughter of Alexey, is perhaps more resonant and haunting now with his recent — perhaps inevitable? — passing. Take notes.\n\nThe Loss Of Things I Took For Granted\n\nSLATE\n\nKids aren’t reading like they used to and Adam Kotsko’s ringing the alarm. “I have to think that we can, at the very least, stop actively preventing young people from developing the ability to follow extended narratives in the classroom.”\n\nThe Year After A Denied Abortion\n\nPRO PUBLICA\n\nSpoiler alert: It’s not good. After the forced pregnancy of Mayron Hollis last year under Tennessee’s harsh anti-abortion laws, we get a glimpse at her life with a premature baby, endless health issues, mounting debt, and insufficient childcare.\n\nThe Anabaptist Community Taught Me Everything I Know About Sorghum Syrup\n\nSAVEUR\n\nOne farmer/writer mourns the decline of small, family-run sorghum production as modern businesses transform the rural landscape (lookin’ at you, Dollar General). The Huber sisters are the ones keeping it alive — for now.\n\nThe Friends Who Are Caring For Each Other In Older Age\n\nTHE ATLANTIC\n\nA growing number of older adults, or “elder orphans,” have no close family to lean on as they age. So who will care for them when they need assistance, or fall ill? They’re turning to each other.\n\nFlorida School Asks Parents For Permission To Have Book By An African American Author Read To Students\n\nNBC NEWS\n\nAnother preposterously racist event, another demerit for DeSantis. Glad to know at least one parent was taken aback by the request, but the “anti-woke” movement still at it.\n\nThey’re Called ‘Big Pie.’ Where To Find Giant Chinese Scallion Pancakes\n\nTHE LOS ANGELES TIMES\n\nThey’re “essentially China’s answer to focaccia” and holy crap they look glorious. We’re already planning visits to the two name-checked San Gabriel Valley spots that specialize in the pillowy, crusty, peppery bread.\n\nIn Harlem’s ‘Little Senegal,’ West African Migrants Find Community And Challenges\n\nGOTHAMIST\n\n“The number of migrants from West African nations like Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania has tripled in the last year alone and garnered worldwide attention.” But they’re struggling to find work, and orgs are struggling to support them.\n\nThis Evangelical Billionaire Family Wants To Convert You On Super Bowl Sunday\n\nROLLING STONE\n\nA campaign promoting Jesus and loving your neighbors is driven by the billionaire family behind Hobby Lobby, which has denied its employees birth control coverage and use of bathrooms associated with their gender identity. LOL the hypocrisy.\n\nHow Food Stylists On ‘Feud’ Brought La Côte Basque Back To Life\n\nEATER\n\nWith the food at the iconic French restaurant playing such a huge role in telling the Feud story, attention to every historical detail was critical — and the stylists nailed it, they really did.\n\n‘New Literacy Test’: The Black Organizers Waging War On Disinformation\n\nCAPITAL B\n\n“Every time an election looms, Baton Rouge resident Ashley Shelton notices the red flags — the signs sprinkled around the city and other parts of Louisiana that give the wrong information about when voters can cast their ballots.”\n\nThe Unsettling Scourge Of Obituary Spam\n\nTHE VERGE\n\nWe really know how to ruin everything, is the point of this one. “In the wake of death, AI-generated obituaries litter search results, turning even private individuals into clickbait.”"
