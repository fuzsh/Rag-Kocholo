        "text": "Update: Published paper available at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050303219874366. This paper examines how “love” as an affective concept was brought into the Chinese vocabulary where previously such meaning was absent, and the ways in which it has been adapted as a political discourse and a social force in Republican (1911-1949) and Communist China (1949-) in different ways. Although the making of love as an affect for the project of Chinese modernity has been noted by certain scholars, the source of such affect is primarily attributed to Christianity and Christian humanism (Lee, Goossaert, Wielander, Wickeri). My project will show 1) a typology of Christian influence as missionaries helped to reconfigure Asia through love when overt political and military power had begun to prove difficult or impossible to execute effectively, and as legacies of sentimentalism drawn into the age of modern nation-state nationalism: imperialism registered in the language of love; 2) alternative impact from revolutionary radicalism (e.g. October Revolution in Russia and socialism in France) and folk religions that has been decisive to the formation of the discourse of universal love, equality, and ‘harmonious society’ in state propaganda and everyday politics. This project will carefully take a top-down and from-below approach, to explore sources from media, contextual theology, and state propaganda. Ultimately, I wish this project could elucidate the expression of feeling as the means by which institutions and cultural authenticity are created and renewed, a means that has so far been neglected in the study of religion and politics in China."
