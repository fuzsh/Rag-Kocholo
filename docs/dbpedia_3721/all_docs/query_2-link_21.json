        "text": "In this recent collection of their essays on the work of Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, Colby Dickinson (author of Agamben and Theology: Dickinson 2011) and Adam Kotsko (translator of many of Agamben’s recent theological works) offer an assortment of texts interrogating the relationship between Agamben’s ‘coming philosophy’ and the new tasks and uses of theology. Though many of the essays have been published in earlier forms in various journals and edited collections, they have been updated to reflect recent publications by Agamben and, when brought together, offer focused reflections back on the Homo Sacer project from its terminus, and on Agamben’s theological inquiries more broadly. The full impact of the ‘theological turn’ in Agamben’s work has likely not yet been felt, largely because some of his most heavily theological works have been translated into English only recently. By unpacking some of the key issues in at play in Agamben’s theological reflections, Dickinson and Kotsko offer insight into the depth and breadth of the theological shift – an important and timely contribution for Agamben’s English-language readership.\n\nThe Oxford Handbook of Philosophical Theology is a collection of twenty-six essays or articles edited by Thomas Flint, professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, and Michael Rea, also a professor of philosophy at the same university. In the Introduction to this work, the editors give a definition of what they consider philosophical theology to be: “philosophical theology (as we understand it) is aimed primarily at theoretical understanding of the nature and attributes of God, and God’s relationship to the world and things in the world” (p. 1). With the publication of Alasdair Maclntyre and Anthony Flew’s New Essays in Philosophical Theology in 1955, there was a great revival of interest in the philosophy of religion in general and, in its wake, in philosophical theology in particular, especially in the latter half of the twentieth century. The topics presented in the book were like the agenda for subsequent work in philosophy of religion for the next two or three decades, such as the meaningfulness of religious discourse and questions about the rationality of religious belief. This present work, however, covers a new focus of attention apart from those concerning the nature, rationality, and meaningfulness of theistic belief. In the last twenty years, as the editors remark, “a great deal of attention has been devoted recently to philosophical problems arising out of the Christian doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Atonement; there has been an explosion of work on questions about the nature of divine providence and its implications for human freedom; and a fair bit of recent work has also been done on questions about the metaphysical possibility of the resurrection of the dead” (p. 4). At the same time, the authors note that there is a very small literature on the topic of divine revelation and the inspiration of Scripture, only a handful of works on the topics of prayer, original sin, and the nature of heaven and hell, and virtually nothing on the Christian doctrine of the Eucharist from a philosophical standpoint. The book is divided into five parts covering five general topics: I. Theological Prolegomena II. Divine Attributes III. God and Creation IV. Topics in Christian Philosophical Theology V. Non-Christian Philosophical Theology\n\nCourse Description From the Bulletin: Critical examination of philosophical texts which have played an important role in framing theological questions and discussions; of representative theological texts for how philosophical issues and presuppositions bear on their interpretation; of representative accounts (historical and contemporary) of the relationship between theology and philosophy. This course aims to introduce students to six philosophers and to consider how their philosophical insights can contribute to the task of theological reflection. Rather than trying to master any one thinker's oeuvre, our task will be to treat each figure as a \"companion thinker\" whose work can broaden and deepen our understanding of what it means to do theology today. Ph.D. Learning Outcomes 1. Make scholarly contributions within a specialized field of theology 2. Demonstrate ability to facilitate a theological discussion at a post-secondary level 3. Where needed and helpful, to comprehend philosophical and theological resources in historically significant languages (e.g., Latin, Greek, Hebrew) and in internationally used languages (e.g., German, French, Spanish) Course Objectives By the end of this course, students will be able to: • identify and describe the potential contributions to theological reflection made by the philosophers engaged. • assess the coherence and adequacy of philosophical insights into anthropology, moral ontology, the relationship between faith and reason, and the way philosophers and theologians can serve as companion thinkers. • evaluate and integrate philosophical arguments into their own scholarly projects."
