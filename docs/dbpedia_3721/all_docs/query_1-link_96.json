        "text": "A Brief History of Neoliberalism\n\nBy David Harvey,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nThis is the book that put “neoliberalism” on the map in contemporary debates. Published years before the Global Financial Crisis, it offers a global and historical perspective on the neoliberal order. I have some questions about Harvey’s definitions—especially his claim that China is a neoliberal country—but no one can beat him for mastery of economic data and trends.\n\nBy David Harvey,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked A Brief History of Neoliberalism as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNeoliberalism - the doctrine that market exchange is an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide for all human action - has become dominant in both thought and practice throughout much of the world since 1970 or so.\n\nIts spread has depended upon a reconstitution of state powers such that privatization, finance, and market processes are emphasized. State interventions in the economy are minimized, while the obligations of the state to provide for the welfare of its citizens are diminished. David Harvey, author of 'The New Imperialism' and 'The Condition of Postmodernity', here tells the political-economic story of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Limits of Neoliberalism: Authority, Sovereignty and the Logic of Competition\n\nBy William Davies,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nDavies offers an exceptionally clear and useful definition of neoliberalism: “the disenchantment of politics by economics.” But what really makes this book valuable is the research he has conducted on the office culture of the government officials who are actually implementing neoliberal policy—how they think, what they believe they’re achieving, and how they sometimes deviate from the letter of neoliberal theory while remaining true to its spirit.\n\nBy William Davies,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Limits of Neoliberalism as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBrilliant...explains how the rhetoric of competition has invaded almost every domain of our existence.\"\n\n-Evgeny Morozov, author of To Save Everything, Click Here\"\n\n\"In this fascinating book Davies inverts the conventional neoliberal practice of treating politics as if it were mere epiphenomenon of market theory, demonstrating that their version of economics is far better understood as the pursuit of politics by other means.\"\n\n-Professor Philip Mirowski, University of Notre Dame\n\n\"A sparkling, original, and provocative analysis of neoliberalism. It offers a distinctive account of the diverse, sometimes contradictory, conventions and justifications that lend authority to the extension of the spirit…\n\nPreview\n\nUndoing the Demos: Neoliberalism's Stealth Revolution\n\nBy Wendy Brown,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nMore than most authors on neoliberalism, Brown takes it seriously as a philosophy and worldview that aims to reshape human society and our individual sense of self. Drawing on classic philosophers like Aristotle, Marx, and Arendt, she argues that neoliberalism is hollowing our sense of what it means to be human by turning us all into hyper-competitive, self-marketing, self-branding drones. I wind up arguing with her a lot in my book, but whether you wind up agreeing or disagreeing with her, she’s an essential point of reference.\n\nBy Wendy Brown,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Undoing the Demos as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNeoliberal rationality ― ubiquitous today in statecraft and the workplace, in jurisprudence, education, and culture ― remakes everything and everyone in the image of homo oeconomicus. What happens when this rationality transposes the constituent elements of democracy into an economic register? In vivid detail, Wendy Brown explains how democracy itself is imperiled.\n\nThe demos disintegrates into bits of human capital; concerns with justice cede to the mandates of growth rates, credit ratings, and investment climates; liberty submits to the imperative of human capital appreciation; equality dissolves into market competition; and popular sovereignty grows incoherent. Liberal democratic practices may not survive…\n\nPreview\n\nFamily Values: Between Neoliberalism and the New Social Conservatism\n\nBy Melinda Cooper,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nMost commentators see neoliberalism as primarily an economic project that tries to overcome old cultural prejudices and divisions. Cooper shows us that beneath this cosmopolitan façade, neoliberalism has always been about reinforcing traditional hierarchies of race, gender, and sexuality. Through a painstaking review of the actual roll-out of neoliberal policy from Reagan to Obama, she shows that racism, sexism, homophobia, and nationalism are not outdated “leftovers” from a previous era but an essential part of the neoliberal order.\n\nBy Melinda Cooper,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Family Values as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn investigation of the roots of the alliance between free-market neoliberals and social conservatives.\n\nWhy was the discourse of family values so pivotal to the conservative and free-market revolution of the 1980s and why has it continued to exert such a profound influence on American political life? Why have free-market neoliberals so often made common cause with social conservatives on the question of family, despite their differences on all other issues? In this book, Melinda Cooper challenges the idea that neoliberalism privileges atomized individualism over familial solidarities, and contractual freedom over inherited status. Delving into the history of the American…\n\nPreview"
