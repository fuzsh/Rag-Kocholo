        "text": "In 1979, Michel Foucault gave a series of lectures on the emerging governmental body of thought called 'neoliberalism'. The lectures have proven to be prophetic: today, neoliberalism is considered the dominant mode of economic governance. It mobilizes the governmental apparatus to promote free market competition, entrepreneurship, and the maximization of shareholder value. Foucault's lectures, however, were experimental forays into unknown terrain, so they also had their limits. Thirty years later, researchers have emphasized (a) more continuities with modern liberalism than Foucault had acknowledged, (b) a strange affinity with religious traditionalist social movements, and (c) governments' tendency to not only promote neoliberal forms of conduct but also to exclude those who are no longer worth this investment. I use Giorgio Agamben's engagement with Foucault's history of governmentality to provide a new critique of neoliberalism that accounts for these blind spots. According to Agamben, modern economic governance still bears the traces of medieval theological ideas of 'oikonomia'. He identifies this insight as the foundation of a new field of study: economic theology. In the Middle Ages, theologians used the word 'economy' to refer to God's providential government of the world toward salvation. This approach played a crucial role in medieval theodicy: God’s goodness, omniscience, and omnipotence could be reconciled with the existence of evil in the world, because God had entrusted the 'oikonomia' of the world to his fallible creatures. God supposedly ensured the general laws of nature, while individual creatures had been created in such a way that they would spontaneously bring about salvation, although some collateral damage along the way would be inevitable. According to Agamben, modern liberal economists like Adam Smith adapted this theological idea of Divine Providence to the domain of free market trade. Liberals argued that the free market was construed as an 'economy', which entailed that, if everyone acted out of self-interest, the common good would spontaneously be procured. The invisible hand of the market, or God, allegedly guaranteed the reconciliation between private and public interest, even if some collateral damage along the way was inevitable. By tracing this genealogy further in the 20th century, I show how the economic theology of neoliberalism reveals (a) what continuities exist between classical liberalism and neoliberalism, (b) why neoliberalism goes together so well with religious traditionalism, and (c) how neoliberals use arguments similar to theodicy to defend the exclusion of marginalized groups. The dissertation has three parts: (I) presenting the insights and limits of Foucault’s analysis of neoliberal governmentality, (II) elucidating Agamben’s economico-theological project, and (III) applying this economico-theological project to neoliberalism. I take the problem of exclusion (c) as the primary fuel to drive the argument forward. After explaining Foucault’s conceptualization of governmentality in chapter 1 and of neoliberalism in chapter 2, I thus devote chapter 3 to the merits and limits of Foucault’s approach to exclusion in neoliberal governmentality. Moving to part II, I argue in chapter 4 how Agamben’s economico-theological approach expands the notion of exclusion in governmentality toward the idea of collateral damage. In chapter 5, I subsequently show how Agamben rewrites the history of governmentality from the perspective of economic theology and collateral damage. Here the concerns for continuity (a) and the religious factor (b) also return. Agamben rethinks the history of governmentality as a progressive secularization of providential theology because the modern sciences and Smithian liberalism re-furbish the signature of ‘economy’ to structure their own discourses. Through the signature of ‘economy’, the liberal governmental rationality becomes an oikodicy for the free market that justifies the expulsion of surplus populations in the name of the auctoritas of the market. In part III, I extend this reading prism to neoliberal governmental discourses. I focus, more specifically, on Hayek’s competition theory, the Chicago School’s economic approach to human behaviour, and Novak’s celebration of the primacy of shareholder value in corporate governance. In each instance, I show discursive continuity with liberalism and/or medieval providential theology: Hayek and the Chicago School invoke liberal arguments and Smith’s ‘invisible hand’-metaphor to justify neoliberal government, while Novak even explicitly returns to medieval providential theology to justify corporations. All three also display a religious dimension: they structure their discourse as an theodicy for the free market at the cost of poverty and deprivation. All three, lastly, employ the rhetorics of theodicy to identify and justify the collateral damages caused by neoliberalism: Hayek admits his ideal competitive markets still exclude those who fail to adapt to competitive pressures or lose out due to bad luck; for the Chicago School, I focus on how they use the economic approach to human behaviour to legitimate the discrimination and structural unemployment of African Americans on US labour markets; Novak, thirdly, uses a mix of theology and neoliberal management theory to absolve corporate managers from responsibility toward the negative side-effects of corporations’ misconducts.\n\nDotan Leshem’s study is a valuable intervention in the larger project of developing a theological genealogy of the modern concepts of economy and government, a project inspired by Michel Foucault’s lectures on governmentality in the late 1970s and extended more recently in Giorgio Agamben’s latest contributions to the Homo Sacer series. In my remarks, I will focus mainly on Leshem’s dialogue with Foucault and Agamben, highlighting areas where I believe his work has clarified and furthered their established discourses. I will then turn to several questions that I believe are productively opened in the conclusion of Leshem’s book. These questions revolve around the mechanisms through which the theological heritage of economy mutates into the neoliberal market of the contemporary world. Leshem’s work seems ambivalent about whether this mechanism should be understood as a process of secularization or something more radical. I suggest that a deeper engagement with the Reformation moment, and particularly the classic understanding of the Reformation’s impact on the economic subject established in Max Weber’s Protestant Ethic and the “Spirit” of Capitalism, might be pursued in future work. Moreover, I suggest that a more extended engagement with Foucault’s own account of the transformation of the Christian pastorate in the wake of the Reformation and the pastorate’s implicit transformation into the regime of neoliberal governmentality could also illuminate some of the questions raised by Leshem’s study.\n\n+annex of tables and figures. Forthcoming June 4th, Columbia University Press See Flyer for details. \"Leshem's important book makes a very powerful and original contribution to an increasingly significant discussion across different disciplines. Its consistency, erudition, and relevance for contemporary research into the theological \"genealogy\" of economy and government is impressive indeed.\" — Étienne Balibar, Professor Emeritus of Moral and Political Philosophy, Université de Paris-Ouest Nanterre (France) and Visiting Professor, Columbia University \"In my opinion this work is the most significant text so far in the field of what has come to be termed 'political theology.' Through his wide-ranging and careful scholarship, Leshem shows the extent to which a theological, Biblically-based dimension totally altered the operative categories of political virtue.\" — John Milbank, author of Beyond Secular Order: The Representation of Being and the Representation of the People \"This dazzling book takes us on an intellectual journey of rare substance. It demonstrates that our current predicament — the dominance of economic \"rationality,\" the imperatives of growth — is at once newer and older, narrower and broader, than we have been taught. This is a humbling and teaching book that will change, that must change, the way we conceive of the economic in its relation to the political, the philosophical, the theological. An economist and a philosopher, Dotan Leshem writes with masterful intensity and compellingly calls for an extraordinary transformation, for an \"ethical economy,\" for nothing less than a new political philosophy.\" — Gil Anidjar, author of Blood: A Critique of Christianity"
