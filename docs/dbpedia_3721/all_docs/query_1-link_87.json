        "text": "Sorry, it’s gonna be a long one…\n\nI recently read an article called “I Don’t Know Why Everyone’s in Denial About College Students Who Can’t Do the Reading” by Adam Kotsko, which appeared in Slate a few weeks ago. When I first saw the title on MSN (it was published under “The Loss of Things I Took for Granted” on the actual Slate website), I immediately thought it would be a snotty list of complaints about how “kids these days” are so much lazier and less intelligent than previous generations of students or something.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that the article was actually a very sympathetic piece by a humanities professor reflecting on the detrimental impact of not only smartphones but also standardized testing and the curriculum designed around it. It brought to mind my own experience of teaching at the university level and the frustration that I felt throughout — not because of my students, but because of the circumstances that shaped them.\n\nAs Kotsko says in his piece, “We are not complaining about our students. We are complaining about what has been taken from them.”\n\nWhen I took my pedagogy seminar in graduate school, my instructor warned the class that we would be teaching a new kind of student — Gen Z students, that is. As someone born in 1998, I’m actually a Gen Z kid as well, which I think made me much more sympathetic than some older people in my cohort.\n\nI noticed pretty quickly that most of my students seemed to have lower literacy and composition skills that I had expected. This was obvious not only in their written assignments, but in how they acted in class and when communicating one-on-one with me as well. Most appeared to genuinely struggle with reading passages out loud, and many would repeatedly ask me questions to which I had already clearly stated the answer both verbally in class and in writing.\n\nHowever, I never thought my students were lazier or less intelligent than I had been as an undergraduate. (I’ll never forget one particularly embarrassing day in my World Literature class when no one was able to respond to our professor’s questions about the reading, prompting him to ask, “Did anyone actually do the reading?” No one had.) I recognized that most of them actually tried very hard to do well in class, and I had several students that I thought were absolutely brilliant, if a bit rough around the edges.\n\nStill, even in a freshman English 101 course, it disappointed me to see that so many of my students underperformed in class. I was absolutely shocked the first time I graded their essays. I didn’t know how so many students had made it to college with such a poor understanding of basic composition and sentence structure.\n\n“If we ask what has caused this change, there are some obvious culprits,” Kotsko writes. “The first is the same thing that has taken away almost everyone’s ability to focus — the ubiquitous smartphone. Even as a career academic who studies the Quran in Arabic for fun, I have noticed my reading endurance flagging.”\n\n“I am able to ‘turn it on’ when demanded, for instance to plow through a big novel during a holiday break,” he continues. “That’s because I was able to develop and practice those skills of extended concentration and attentive reading before the intervention of the smartphone. For children who were raised with smartphones, by contrast, that foundation is missing.”\n\nI’m no stranger to lack of focus and motivation, especially in recent years. I’m a terrible procrastinator, and I slept through a lot of my general education courses, but maintained good grades because I always chose subjects that I already understood well and was able to skate by on my test-taking ability and sheer memorization.\n\nI knew that general education classes can be very boring, and English composition can be especially uninteresting for kids if they don’t see how writing can connect to their other interests. Traditional composition pedagogy is also steeped in colonial mentality (mostly in the form of prescriptive grammar), which discourages and sometimes prevents bilingual or English-learning students from honing their creative skills and achieving fluency in writing, particularly bilingual critical literacy.\n\nIn an attempt to make writing essays more interesting to my students and less of a chore, I spent a lot of time in class showing them different examples of what I considered “fun” compositions — illustrated essays, conversational narrative pieces, analyses of pop culture media, podcast and video essays, and humor writing. I repeatedly tried to impress upon them that they were allowed to write about anything they wanted — and they could “write” it pretty much however they wanted, even if that meant relying on visual or auditory storytelling.\n\nThis worked to a certain extent. I had a handful of students in every class that would take up this challenge and create the most amazing final projects. One student wrote and illustrated a twenty-page graphic narrative. Another student made a feature film-length video essay about their favorite video game. Several delivered very personal, moving pieces that made me tear up.\n\nStill, the mindset that had been instilled in them throughout their K-12 education was difficult to eradicate. For every exceptional student who put their heart into their project, there was one or two that did the bare minimum in a very boring way. It was clear that these kids had been taught to meet standards and little more. Kotsko points this out in his article.\n\n“Less discussed than these broader cultural trends [like the prevalence and reliance on smartphones] over which educators have little control are the major changes in reading pedagogy that have occurred in recent decades — some motivated by the ever-increasing demand to ‘teach to the test’ and some by fads coming out of schools of education,” he notes.\n\n“The result of this vibes-based literacy is that students never attain genuine fluency in reading,” Kotsko asserts. “Even aside from the impact of smartphones, their experience of reading is constantly interrupted by their intentionally cultivated inability to process unfamiliar words.”\n\nI think kids have forgotten that intellectual challenges can be fun. It can be exciting to push yourself to do something creative and new. Learning can bring you joy. Education isn’t just a road to employment — it’s a way to improve your life in so many other ways, open up new worlds of possibilities, and even contribute to bettering society.\n\nYou can’t solve your life’s problems without learning to identify and understand them first, but it’s hard to do even that if you have no motivation or confidence in your abilities.\n\nIn his article, Kotsko also briefly mentions remote learning and school closures during the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“There is still some debate about the necessity of those measures, but what is not up for debate any longer is the very real learning loss that students suffered at every level,” he writes.\n\nEven as an instructor and graduate student, I felt that I lost a lot during the pandemic. Having only taught one semester of face-to-face instruction before the closures began, I couldn’t completely or accurately gauge the massive shift in attitudes, teaching methods, and learning ability that took place at the time.\n\nWhat I was able to see immediately though, was the disengagement of both the students and myself as an instructor. A couple of my classes were asynchronous, and I pre-recorded lectures for students to watch on their own time; I felt like I hardly knew the kids in these classes. In live Zoom classes, the distance of distance-learning was embodied by most of my students’ desire to leave their cameras off all the time.\n\nNow, with the explosion of AI-generated or AI-assisted writing, instructors are complaining that students are less likely to actually write essays themselves than ever before. I would argue that AI actually has very little to do with this; students who don’t write their own essays aren’t lazy — they’re just doing what they think they need to do to get a leg up. That’s the price of relying on grades to gauge a student’s success, as well as the price of framing college education as only a means to the end of securing a profitable career.\n\nI can’t blame them; I did the same thing, many times. I’m still reflecting on and processing my graduate school experience during the pandemic, and I don’t know if I’ll ever really understand what I missed out on in those years. I can only hope that I’m able to correct course and motivate myself to make up for that disparity now that I’m out of school.\n\nI’m sure we’ll continue to see the negative effects of school closures (despite their necessity at the time) — and, as long as public education continues down the path it’s on now, those effects will only be compounded by the poor state of education in the United States (and, presumably, in many other countries as well).\n\nKotsko concludes his article with a moving reminder that literacy and rhetorical skills aren’t just pastimes for the elite and well-educated — they are essential to understanding others and challenging the narratives meant to confuse and disempower us.\n\n“I have to think that we can, at the very least, stop actively preventing young people from developing the ability to follow extended narratives and arguments in the classroom,” Kotsko writes. “Regardless of their profession or ultimate educational level, they will need those skills. The world is a complicated place. People — their histories and identities, their institutions and work processes, their fears and desires — are simply too complex to be captured in a worksheet with a paragraph and some reading comprehension questions.”\n\nI hope we’re able to pump the brakes and restore a certain standard to modern pedagogy. There’s only so much that can be accomplished by improving yourself — we need to be sure that everyone is equipped with the skills they need to have a fighting chance in this chaotic world.\n\nIf anyone’s interested, I’ll link my Decolonial Composition Pedagogy site here. It was part of my master’s thesis portfolio, and it reflects some of my strongest feelings about teaching English. The whole project was a bit rushed and isn’t as robust as I would’ve wanted, but maybe it can still be a resource or at least an interesting perspective for others to see. If anyone does check it out, let me know your thoughts. I appreciated the comments on my last post! :)\n\nI’ll see y’all next time. Hopefully, there will be a shorter interval between this dispatch and the last."
