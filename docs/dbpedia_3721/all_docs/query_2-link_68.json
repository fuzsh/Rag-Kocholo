        "text": "“Wilderness,” ca. 1200, a “wild, uninhabited, or uncultivated place,” developed from the compounding of the Old English wild-deor, a “wild animal, wild deer,” with -ness. “Wild,” or the Old English wilde is that adjective meaning “in a natural state, uncultivated, untamed, undomesticated, uncontrolled,” ultimately of uncertain origin, through perhaps from the PIE root *welt-, “woodlands, wild.” The same root gives us the related “wold” alternately, in Old English’s Anglian and West Saxon or Kentish, respectively as wald and weald, meant “forest, wooded upland,” which is now really only seen preserved in names, such as the Cotswold. The mid 13th c. saw “wild” implying the “sexually dissolute” and “loose,” and in 1955’s America, its sense of being “exciting, excellent.” Its verb sense, “to run wild, refuse to be tamed” comes from the Old English awildian, which, in the 1520’s, simply mean the noun “plant that grows without cultivation,” and in the 1590’s, “uncultivated or desolate region.”\n\nWalled Garden: while the hortus conclusus double stuttered its nature as enclosed, its boundaries were often permeable—hedges, wattles, and so forth—whereas the proper walled garden was encircled with towering brick or stone walls designed to further protect its plant occupants from winds and cold, create a microclimate, absorbing the sun’s heat for evening release, and even its brick walls often having a hollow within where fires could be lit, smoke chimneyed out, so to protect espalier fruit trees or vines from frost, and having squares which could be removed for venting in warmer months.\n\n“Agriculture” comes from the mid-15th c. meaning “tillage, cultivation of large areas of land to provide food” from the Late Latin agricultura, “cultivation of the land,” contracting together agri cultura, or agri, “a field,” and cultura, “cultivation.”\n\n​\n\n“Hortus conclusus,” the Latin for “enclosed garden,” stutters a bit, both words meaning some sort of enclosure (hortus’ root of *gher- means “to grasp, enclose;” conclusus meaning “concluded, finished,” conclude, “to shut up, close, imprison, enclose, confine”). While for gardening, the enclosure is often deemed to have practical value for protection of one’s plants, in medieval art, such walled gardens suggested purity, a virginal impenetrability, often paintings of the Virgin and Child, her womb closed off, unsullied, pure, for her son’s conception was immaculate.* The Song of Songs 4:12: Hortus conclusus soror mea, sponsa, hortus conclusus, fons signatus [“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up”].\n\n* A good example being Andrea del Verrocchio’s “The Virgin and Child with Two Angels,” ca. 1467-69, tempera on panel, The National Gallery, London. Curiously, “the Virgin was often metaphorically described as the ‘gateway of heaven’ (‘porta coeli’) as it was through her that Christ came into the world from heaven, an attribute alluded to pictorially in numerous Annunciations through the motif of an open door,” e.g., Duccio’s “Annuciation,” (Alasdair Flint, ‘Master of the Judgement of Paris, The Annunciation,’ published online 2014, in ‘Building the Picture: Architecture in Italian Renaissance Painting’, The National Gallery, London, {see ~~here~~ }).\n\nMy mother's garden, 2018\n\n“Landscape,” from ca. 1600, was a noun some three hundred years before gaining its verb sense, and for its first roughly 286 years of documented use it was a painter’s term for art “representing an extensive view of natural scenery.” Formed ca. 1600 from the conjunction of land-, ground or soil, one’s home region, and -scap, or -ship, something’s state or condition, “landscape” only gained its non-artistic meaning of a “tract of land with its distinguishing characteristics” in 1886. By 1916 it became the verb meaning “to lay out lawns, gardens, etc., plant trees for the sake of beautification.”\n\nNiguÌelas, Andalusia, Spain, 2019\n\nWales countryside, 2009\n\n“Orchard,” from the late Old English orceard, a “fruit garden” or “piece of ground, usually enclosed, devoted to the culture of fruit-trees,” yet also a place for meeting, recreation, and so forth; its earlier form was ortgeard, perhaps from wortgeard, a compound of wort, from wyrt for “vegetable, plant root,” and geard, “garden, yard” and “vegetable garden.”\n\n(above) Newly planted three-year-old fig trees; (right) figs seven years later\n\n​“Plant,” as a noun, is from the Old English plante, “young tree or shrub, herb newly planted, a shoot or strip recently sprouted from seed,” from the Latin planta, “sprout, shoot, cutting,” possibly coming from a verb *plantare, “to drive in with the feet, push into the ground with the feet,” or even “to level the earth” by the “sole of the foot,” deriving from the PIE root *plat-, “to spread,” later giving the Old English plantain, to “put or set in the ground to grow.” By the 1550’s, it expanded to name non-tree vegetation more generally.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n“Paradise”: while the late Old English meant by this “the garden of Eden,” as did the Old French, the Late Latin paradisus just as much meant “a park, orchard, and abode of the blessed” from the Greek paradeisos, which compares to the Iranian, Avestan, Persian, and Arabic uses, and is a compound of pairi-, “around,” and diz, “to make, to form (a wall).” Xenophon and others used the Greek for an orchard or royal hunting park in Persia, and the Septuagint took it to mean “the garden of Eden,” and the New Testament translations of Luke 23:43 to mean “the Christian heaven, place where the souls of the righteous departed await resurrection” since ca. 1200 in English and 1400 extended to the Muslim heaven. “Paradise” meaning a “place of extreme beauty, blissful state like or comparable to Paradise” is ca. 1300. Since the late 14th c., the “gates of paradise” meant “the Virgin Mary.”\n\nSudeley Castle, Tithe Barn Ruins\n\n\"The history of the word 'paradise', which sounds so familiar to us, is a succession of loans from one language to another, as if the foreign term were for some reason always held to be untranslatable or else one wanted at every cost to avoid its obvious equivalent\"\n\n​--Giorgio Agamben, The Kingdom and the Garden, trans. Adam Kotsko (London: Seagull Books, 2020), 4."
