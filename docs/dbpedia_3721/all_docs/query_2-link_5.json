        "text": "I have often joked that I support Rahm Emanuel because he’s so evil. It’s funny, but it’s not actually a joke. First of all, I do support him. I went out of my way to make sure my Chicago residency was (re)established specifically so that I could vote in the mayoral election and then to visit an early-voting location on a Sunday to vote for him. When he was kicked off the ballot by the appeals court, I anxiously hovered over my computer seeking fresh news on the situation — the only other news issues I do that for are presidential elections and major public transit-related legislation. (And like all right-thinking people, I have of course avidly followed the @MayorEmanuel Twitter feed.)\n\nWhy am I so supportive of a conservative Democrat who took a couple years off of politics to cash out in investment banking and famously dismissed liberal activists as “fucking retarded”? I have two reasons for this, based on my understanding of Chicago politics and of the place of large urban centers in the US and global economy:\n\nThere must be an orderly succession: I had long joked that when Daley stepped down, I would need to flee the city, because all hell would break loose. Chicago is famous for its authoritarian system, and suddenly switching to a more dispersed system seems like a recipe for gridlock and confusion. An authoritarian system, however, doesn’t really make for a “deep bench” in terms of people ready to take and effectively exercise power — hence my worry about Daley stepping down. The entry of Rahm Emanuel into the race changed this calculus entirely, however. Obviously a former congressional power-broker and White House Chief of Staff nows how to exercise power, and the fact that he has a farcically huge campaign warchest and previously served as the head of fundraising for Daley means that he is ready to take power.\n\nAnthony said recently on Twitter that Rahm was the architect of a failed term for Obama — yet the Obama administration has basically gotten everything they wanted out of the legislative process, with the exception of cap and trade (which I’m convinced is bullshit anyway). They didn’t want the best things, but they got them. Obama didn’t do what he did because Rahm told him to, he recruited Rahm because of what he wanted to do.\n\nSimilarly, one might object to the recruiting of “Blue Dog” Democrats — I certainly find Blue Dogs to be the most loathsome creatures on earth, with the exception of Joe Lieberman — but the strategy did deliver Congress into the hands of the Democrats, making Nancy Pelosi, probably one of the most liberal national politicians currently in office, the Speaker of the House.\n\nIn a neoliberal system, small units must be able to work neoliberalism to their advantage: As much as I would love to see a Socialist Republic of Chicago, any such program would inevitably end in disaster because corporate interests would essentially turn Chicago into Detroit. It’d be great if politicians had unilateral power to implement coherent programs, etc., but that’s never been the way things work in America even at the level of the presidency, much less at the level of a political unit representing less than 1% of the US population. As it stands, I think that Daley has worked within the neoliberal constraints at a near-genius level, turning Chicago into a growing city — with all the great things that makes possible — in a region full of dying cities. And although he is constrained to cultivate the favor of high finance, he has managed to use that strategy to implement progressive goals on other fronts. Chicago is a hugely gay-friendly city, for instance, and Daley has made environmental concerns a significant priority; Rahm shares both priorities.\n\nOne can interpret the infamous sale of the parking meters as being, in part, a pro-environmental move — pushing parking fees to the highest level the market can bear is one of the biggest things a city can do to tip the balance away from driving (Daley himself is an avid biker and has reportedly not driven a car in 30 years), but elected officials are afraid to do so. The solution? Outsource it under the cover of budget necessity, and then you can blame the greedy corpoation for jacking up the rates. Ideally the city would’ve jacked up the rates themselves and used the revenue for better public transit or something, but that never would’ve happened — or if it did, the public outcry would’ve been overwhelming and led to a restoration of the status quo ante. This is the kind of thing where an anti-democratic approach is the best way to go.\n\nOn the question of public transit, one of Rahm’s stated goals is to rehab and extend the Red Line, seeking out corporate partnerships to help do so. The most recent example of a “public-private partnership” on the CTA is the North and Clybourn station, which has been remodelled to fit aesthetically with the new Apple Store — it sucks that corporate sponsorship was necessary to do it, but it’s a pretty significant improvement over the previous setup where you literally could not tell it was even a subway station and the whole place smelled like cheap pizza.\n\nMore generally, I take the Chicago Democratic “machine” to be a model for the national Democratic party. A command and control model is definitely preferable to ineffectual Beautiful Soul-ism, and while corruption is lamentable, it does at least demonstrate a consciousness that one actually has power — something that I’m not confident most members of the national Democratic party realize, preferring instead to cultivate the fawning admiration of Sunday talk show moderators.\n\nSo in short, I support Rahm precisely because he disagrees with my views on the most important economic priorities. I spent the first 18 years of my life directly witnessing what happened to Flint when corpoate interests turned against it. An evil centrist Democrat is apparently what it takes to make Chicago what it is, and voting in favor of preserving Chicago is more important to me than voting in favor of abstract principles — especially when the alternative isn’t the actual implementation of the policies I favor, but stagnation and blight.\n\nNeoliberalism must be opposed, but the municipal level does not have sufficient leverage to oppose it effectively. And so I say: three cheers for the shitty person who is soon to rule over Chicago.\n\nPublished by Adam Kotsko\n\nView all posts by Adam Kotsko"
