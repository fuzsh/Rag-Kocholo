        "text": "On Christianity and the Loss of Mourning\n\nMy grandmother-in-law died a couple weeks ago. She was 105-years-old. She seemed ready to go. She held on for a long time, but I am glad that she felt like she didn’t need to keep holding on. Still, I am sad she’s gone. She would tell us a story about something that happened a long time ago and then she’d say, “It’s funny what you remember.” We like to say that at our house now. It’s been a kind of rite to visit her whenever we are in Spokane, a rite that connects us to other parts of the family. I’ll miss that. I’ll miss her matter-of-factness about the world. “I’m not old,” she’d tell us. Thinking about her now makes me smile. I am sad that she will no longer be out there in the world.\n\nI was going to tell my parents, and then I didn’t. I didn’t because I knew that they would ask me, “Was she a Christian?” And I knew that they would ask because they wanted to know whether she was going to heaven. And that they would want to know that because they would want to know whether it was really an occasion for mourning or not. Or at least, that’s how that question always felt to me. Christianity, as I came to know it as a very young child, was about avoiding death and the need to mourn death. The Christians I grew up around would evangelize to people who didn’t believe by asking them whether they knew where they were going when they died. And they would tell them that they would go to hell if they didn’t believe in Jesus. When someone died, if they were a Christian, it didn’t seem like anyone around me would be really sad about it. Countless times, reports would come to me of someone dying with the information that they were believers.\n\nI’ve been working through some of the affects of Christianity and one that I think has stayed with me is the difficulty in truly mourning–whether it be loss or injustice. I briefly discuss the way that Christianity seems to mourn mortality, and structure itself around avoiding death in my post on Christianity Without Metaphysics. What I have lately come to realize is that Christianity, at least a Christianity that thinks the goal is heaven, has robbed me of the capacity to experience loss or mourning. And it is only with the end of heaven that true mourning becomes possible. What I have newly come to see and understand is that I want to be able to mourn. I want to be able to acknowledge loss, to see the gaps left by the absence of people I love. Like this last summer when I went to the small town in Montana where my grandmother lived her whole life and where my dad grew up and the whole town felt haunted by my grandparents. I missed them because they were gone. I missed them without consolation of a possible reunion. They were there, waving from the porch until they couldn’t see us anymore, and then they were not. And they will never be again.\n\nI wonder about what we lose when we lose the capacity to mourn. I wonder if we lose the capacity to take this life and this world, its pain, the real death of others, seriously. I wonder whether this inability to mourn is what keeps us from doing something about genocide of the Rohinga in Myanmar and of the harm done by ICE deporting DREAMers and ending TPS for immigrants from Haiti and Syria. If death doesn’t matter, then killing doesn’t matter.\n\nI’m of the mind that ways of thinking should be considered for how they work in the world, for their use, as much as for whether they can be justified and supported through argument. This notion that we need not be really sad because someone has gone to heaven seems to work by limiting our capacity to feel loss in the face of death, which then makes us fail to take death seriously, which then leads us to accept the notion that some people are just going to have to die for other people to live the way they want to live. But it also keeps us from thinking about the decisions we make in life as really real, as really mattering. The only decision is to do what is required so that you avoid death. And then heaven is just life stretched out where nothing will lead to the end, the eternal return of the same.\n\nThe Greeks had the Eleusian Mysteries believed to be protected by Demeter. The Mysteries were commonly understood to be about death and to be about preparing for death. Rumor has it the mystery of death is that there is no mystery. The Mysteries were closely guarded, and I wonder if it was because if they were made public, then people might take living a heck of a whole lot more seriously.\n\nI’m not someone who longs for heaven. I think I would rather mourn than have the consolation of heaven. But I do wonder whether really bringing about a world that might resemble heaven requires letting go of our hold on the consolations of death.\n\n‘You Can’t Legislate Morality’: On Punishing Adults to Change Their (legally permissible) Behaviors\n\nI’ve watched a couple episodes of Leah Remini’s exposé of Scientology that has been airing on A&E. In the first episode, Remini interviews a woman is encouraged to cut herself off from her daughter who has left the Church of Scientology and has become a vocal critic of it. Remini explains this process of “In Scientology you are also led to believe by disconnecting from your son or daughter or brother or divorcing your husband is because you are helping them to get back in the good graces. By you saying, “I’m not talking to you,” we’ll straighten you out. You will come to your senses, and come crawling back to the church to get help.” I grew up in a church that employed this sort of “church discipline” with the same thinking that the pain of being cut off from people would compel you to change.\n\nThese same people would argue against what they called “legislating morality.” What they mean is, you can’t make people not racist or sexist through the law, and they see laws aimed at protecting people from racism and sexism as actually aimed at changing the privately held views that some people have about others. By calling it “legislating morality” those on the right make it seems like those laws violate individual rights or privacy in some way. Those kinds of arguments continue to be made about whether business owners should have to serve customers whose sexuality they think is wrong or provide reproductive healthcare to women.\n\nThrough this past campaign season, I began to realize something I’ve personally experienced writ onto a larger scale. Social conservatives actually want to make the lives of certain people–gay people, trans people, people who have sex without being married–unpleasant, difficult and unhappy following the same logic of Scientologist disconnection or Christian excommunication. Not having healthcare or visitation rights or shared parenting and inheritance rights, not being able to have your driver’s license changed to the right sex, to use public restrooms without harassment, to have your testimony believed by law enforcement will “straighten you out” or make you “come to your senses” about sex and sexuality. I just want to point out that this approach is akin to parental discipline. As much as conservatives bemoan the government’s involvement in making society better and call it paternalistic, this approach is more emphatically paternalistic that busing kids to produce desegregation is. The paternalism that certain people have to have about other people’s lives where they think that by creating difficult conditions in their lives that could only be changed by changing what those certain people find wrong about other people’s lives will actually change those people, discipline them into their view of righteousness, is immense.\n\nThe initial concern of those who did not approve of the way they thought morality was being legislated seemed to be that how we think about the world should not be a matter of legislation. Indeed, while some people think sexism is right and do so with the full protections of the First Amendment, we have decided pretty much that as a community we won’t allow for at least overt sexist policies and practices. These same religious conservatives who criticize legislating morality want the law to make people’s lives more difficult and painful in order to get them to live otherwise. This disciplinary strategy–not even in a Foucaultian sense but in a parental sense of disciplinary–aims to use the law to cause people to suffer with the “loving” motivation of getting them to change. This disciplinary strategy would seem to be a means not only of changing the way that people live but of the way they think about what is good and right, about what they want.\n\nIt’s one thing to disagree with people, but another to want to discipline them into agreeing with your view of how they should live by making them miserable."
