        "text": "Or, “A Rant of the Middle Way.”\n\nCome on baby,\n\nGet in the road.\n\nCome on now,\n\nIn the middle of the road, yeah (The Pretenders).\n\nI was just looking at a proposal for a senior capstone paper on the Wisconsin Idea. The student notes that Progressives saw themselves as mediating between two ideological extremes. That’s certainly the view of Charles McCarthy, who wrote the book The Wisconsin Idea. which the student is focusing on right now.\n\nBut why isn’t the middle ground an ideology? Most of the time we don’t speak of it that way. Ideologues are people who hold rigidly to a core set of beliefs. The people in the middle are not considered rigid. Certainly they don’t think of themselves that way.\n\nSometimes they see themselves as pragmatists: People who conclude (with apologies to Alexander Pope):\n\nAnd spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite,\n\nOne truth is clear, Whatever works, is right.\n\nOthers almost ritually assume that the “truth is somewhere in between.” Isn’t that ideological—or certainly epistemological. We find the truth by looking between the extremes. Ideologues do evil at the extremes but we know better.\n\n“The view’s better from here.” Another example from the Progressives. They believed that because they were in the Middle Class that they could see the flaws and the virtues of both labor and management, both the immigrant and the native born. Their vista was the truer one.\n\nGiven that they were thoroughly connected to the industrial order, this had more than a touch of the Puritan: they were in the capitalist world but not of it. We have no trouble speaking of Puritans as ideologues, so why not their distant descendants? And why didn’t they speak of themselves in that way?\n\nSo where are the ideologues of the middle way? Why don’t we have battle cries of “Down with the Extremists!” Why is there no graffiti threatening to line both sides up against the wall and shoot them?\n\nWhy do we leave it to the Pretenders to put a kick in the message?\n\nIn the middle of the road you see the darndest things\n\nLike fakirs driving ’round in jeeps through the city\n\nWearing big diamond rings and silk suits\n\nPast corrugated tin shacks full up with kids\n\nOh man I don’t mean a hampstead nursery\n\nWhen you own a big chunk of the bloody third world\n\nThe babies just come with the scenery\n\nOr is there a middle at all?\n\n- - - -\n\nPS. Jon’s post just below on “Pipe’s Privateers” is a marvel.\n\ncomments powered by Disqus\n\nMore Comments:\n\nJonathan Dresner - 2/23/2005\n\nI've been calling myself an \"enraged moderate\" for some time now. Kotsko's sniping aside, there's substantial political and epistemological power in pragmatic moderation and opposition to actions/solutions/policies that are theory-driven instead of fact-driven.\n\nSometimes moderates must take stands and take action: moderation is not passivity or agnosticism or majoritarianism, but an active engagement with events and ideas to find consensus consistent with the values of the community. It is not conservative or liberal in any meaningful sense of those words: moderates believe that progress is possible, but not inevitable; that the past is useful but not proscriptive; that the nation/community is valuable but not supreme; that rights are essential but in tension.... I could go on. But I've said enough for now.\n\nAdam Kotsko - 2/23/2005\n\nWouldn't a true moderate sometimes be willing to have recourse to extremist solutions -- but in moderation? This knee-jerk rejection of all radicalism is dangerously radical!\n\nJon Christensen - 2/23/2005\n\nThere are \"ideologues of the middle way\" who cry “Down with the Extremists!”\n\nThese days they call themseves \"the radical center.\" Google that phrase and you will find some of them, most notably in Ted Halstead and Michael Lind's book, The Radical Center: The Future of American Poilitics (2001) and out West at the Quivira Coalition which has issued an \"invitation to the radical center\" here (http://www.quiviracoalition.org/documents/invitation.asp), for those ready to abandon the polarized extremes of the historic public lands debates."
