        "text": "The Great Transformation\n\nBy Karl Polanyi,\n\nFrom my list on understanding the transformation of capitalism and globalisation.\n\nBy Vinícius Guilherme Rodrigues Vieira Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nSince 2008, I have conducted research on themes related to International Political Economy. I am currently the co-chair of the research committee on this topic at the International Political Science Association (IPSA) and am passionate about making sense of the interplay between material and symbolic factors that shape capitalism and globalisation. Being based in Brazil, I was stuck when the country—which did not have salient identity cleavages in politics—came to be, after 2008, a hotspot of religious-based right-wing populism associated with the defence of trade liberalisation as globalisation started to face meaningful backlash from White-majority constituencies who are relatively losers of the post-Cold War order in the advanced industrialised democracies.\n\nVinícius' book list on understanding the transformation of capitalism and globalisation\n\nWhy did Vinícius love this book?\n\nAs post-Cold War globalisation seems to face its fate, I always go back to this book as it offers lessons on the perils of taking for granted economic rationality. The 19th-century liberal order crumbled, and fascism emerged as a solution. In the same vein, is far-right populism a reaction against the consequences of neoliberalism?\n\nAlthough he does not bring to the centre stage the impact of ethnic-religious cleavages, such a shortcoming only made me wonder whether his riveting account of modernity applies nowadays.\n\nBy Karl Polanyi,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n12 authors picked The Great Transformation as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this classic work of economic history and social theory, Karl Polanyi analyzes the economic and social changes brought about by the \"great transformation\" of the Industrial Revolution. His analysis explains not only the deficiencies of the self-regulating market, but the potentially dire social consequences of untempered market capitalism. New introductory material reveals the renewed importance of Polanyi's seminal analysis in an era of globalization and free trade.\n\nPreview\n\nA Brief History of Neoliberalism\n\nBy David Harvey,\n\nFrom my list on consumer culture and tearing it down.\n\nBy Dawn Woolley Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have been a feminist for as long as I can remember. I recall seeing a billboard featuring Sophie Dahl sprawling on a sofa, completely naked. I recognized that I had no control over the images that dominate the visual landscape I inhabit, and I wanted to change this. These books might seem varied, but they all critique aspects of contemporary culture and offer ways to change things. In my academic writing and artwork, I examine these issues through a queer, feminist, and anti-capitalist lens, and these books offer a glimpse into the struggles that I think are important and the methods for change that I think could work.\n\nDawn's book list on consumer culture and tearing it down\n\nWhy did Dawn love this book?\n\nTo be honest, I could’ve picked any book by David Harvey–he writes about capitalism and how it affects people and the places we inhabit in a really accessible way. This brief introduction is a great way to get into his writing (a gateway book!). It is also a useful guide to thinking about contemporary issues with hope rather than despair.\n\nLike the book by Ahmed, this one offers ideas for a socially just society, giving the reader solutions and not just problems. I think it is important when critiquing society to come up with tangible ways that we can move away from unequal systems to more equitable ones. This book makes change feel possible.\n\nBy David Harvey,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked A Brief History of Neoliberalism as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNeoliberalism - the doctrine that market exchange is an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide for all human action - has become dominant in both thought and practice throughout much of the world since 1970 or so.\n\nIts spread has depended upon a reconstitution of state powers such that privatization, finance, and market processes are emphasized. State interventions in the economy are minimized, while the obligations of the state to provide for the welfare of its citizens are diminished. David Harvey, author of 'The New Imperialism' and 'The Condition of Postmodernity', here tells the political-economic story of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Limits of Neoliberalism\n\nBy William Davies,\n\nFrom my list on understanding neoliberalism.\n\nBy Adam Kotsko Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up outside of Flint, Michigan, which during my lifetime went from being a pretty nice place to live to being a perpetual basket case that still doesn’t have clean water. I’ve always been very concerned with the question of what went wrong, and very early in my graduate education, it became clear to me that the neoliberal agenda that started under Reagan has been at the root of the economic rot and destruction that has afflicted Flint and so many other places. That personal connection, combined with my background in theology, makes me well-suited to talk about how political belief systems “hook” us, even when they hurt us.\n\nAdam's book list on understanding neoliberalism\n\nWhy did Adam love this book?\n\nDavies offers an exceptionally clear and useful definition of neoliberalism: “the disenchantment of politics by economics.” But what really makes this book valuable is the research he has conducted on the office culture of the government officials who are actually implementing neoliberal policy—how they think, what they believe they’re achieving, and how they sometimes deviate from the letter of neoliberal theory while remaining true to its spirit.\n\nBy William Davies,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Limits of Neoliberalism as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBrilliant...explains how the rhetoric of competition has invaded almost every domain of our existence.\"\n\n-Evgeny Morozov, author of To Save Everything, Click Here\"\n\n\"In this fascinating book Davies inverts the conventional neoliberal practice of treating politics as if it were mere epiphenomenon of market theory, demonstrating that their version of economics is far better understood as the pursuit of politics by other means.\"\n\n-Professor Philip Mirowski, University of Notre Dame\n\n\"A sparkling, original, and provocative analysis of neoliberalism.

I’ve always been very concerned with the question of what went wrong, and very early in my graduate education, it became clear to me that the neoliberal agenda that started under Reagan has been at the root of the economic rot and destruction that has afflicted Flint and so many other places. That personal connection, combined with my background in theology, makes me well-suited to talk about how political belief systems “hook” us, even when they hurt us.\n\nAdam's book list on understanding neoliberalism\n\nWhy did Adam love this book?\n\nMost commentators see neoliberalism as primarily an economic project that tries to overcome old cultural prejudices and divisions. Cooper shows us that beneath this cosmopolitan façade, neoliberalism has always been about reinforcing traditional hierarchies of race, gender, and sexuality. Through a painstaking review of the actual roll-out of neoliberal policy from Reagan to Obama, she shows that racism, sexism, homophobia, and nationalism are not outdated “leftovers” from a previous era but an essential part of the neoliberal order.\n\nBy Melinda Cooper,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Family Values as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn investigation of the roots of the alliance between free-market neoliberals and social conservatives.\n\nWhy was the discourse of family values so pivotal to the conservative and free-market revolution of the 1980s and why has it continued to exert such a profound influence on American political life? Why have free-market neoliberals so often made common cause with social conservatives on the question of family, despite their differences on all other issues? In this book, Melinda Cooper challenges the idea that neoliberalism privileges atomized individualism over familial solidarities, and contractual freedom over inherited status. Delving into the history of the American…\n\nPreview\n\nIn the Ruins of Neoliberalism\n\nBy Wendy Brown,\n\nFrom my list on how neoliberalism f*&ks up democracy.\n\nBy Jacqueline Kennelly Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI came to activism at a young age, inspired by a book given to me by a friend in Grade 10. I also grew up poor; my trajectory into university was unusual for my demographic, a fact I only discovered once I was doing my PhD in the sociology of education. By the time I started interviewing activists for my doctorate, I had a burning desire to understand how social change could happen, what democracy really looked like, and who was left out of participating. I am still trying to figure these things out. If you are, too, the books on this list might help!\n\nJacqueline's book list on how neoliberalism f*&ks up democracy\n\nWhy did Jacqueline love this book?\n\nI’ve loved Wendy Brown’s work since I started reading it while I was doing my PhD back in 2003. I cite her stuff in almost everything I’ve written. This recent book pulls together her vast expertise and insights about political theory, inequality, and democratic practices to explain how neoliberalism has always been anti-democratic, and how it continues to prop up authoritarian styles of leadership, like that of Donald Trump in the US. Key to this, she argues, is how neoliberalism has always made an appeal to ‘tradition,’ which smuggles in patriarchal, classist, and heterosexist notions of the nuclear family, the supremacy of Christian ideals, and a sort of rugged individualism that denies the necessity of a welfare state.\n\nBy Wendy Brown,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked In the Ruins of Neoliberalism as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAcross the West, hard-right leaders are surging to power on platforms of ethno-economic nationalism, Christianity, and traditional family values. Is this phenomenon the end of neoliberalism or its monstrous offspring?\n\nIn the Ruins of Neoliberalism casts the hard-right turn as animated by socioeconomically aggrieved white working- and middle-class populations but contoured by neoliberalism's multipronged assault on democratic values. From its inception, neoliberalism flirted with authoritarian liberalism as it warred against robust democracy. It repelled social-justice claims through appeals to market freedom and morality. It sought to de-democratize the state, economy, and society and re-secure the patriarchal family.

Amadae Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have been studying neoliberal political economy and its future transformations since I wrote Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy. One major insight has been the deep entanglement of neoliberal political-economic practices with de facto power relations. The liberal normative bargaining characterizing Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations yields to coercive bargaining in which threats of harm are the surest and best means to get one’s way. If one seeks to understand how systems will evolve when governed by strategic competition, then orthodox game theory is useful. However, if one seeks to live in a post-scarcity society in which genuine cooperation is possible, then we can enact solidarity, trust-based relationships, and collective moral accountability.\n\nS.M.'s book list on to move beyond neoliberalism\n\nWhy did S.M. love this book?\n\nSince John Williamson’s Washington Consensus and the structural adjustment reforms imposed on developing nations as a condition for IMF and World Bank loans, understanding and criticizing neoliberal development economics is important for a balanced perspective on the international political economy. Chang and Grabel perform this task of an incisive yet graspable critique of neoliberal development theory. Importantly they go further and suggest alternative approaches and policies.\n\nBy Ha-Joon Chang, Ilene Grabel,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Reclaiming Development as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThere is no alternative to neoliberal economics - or so it appeared when Reclaiming Development was published in 2004. Many of the same driving assumptions - monetarism and globalization - remain within the international development policy establishment. Ha-Joon Chang and Ilene Grabel confront this neoliberal development model head-on by combining devastating economic critique with an array of innovative policies and an in-depth analysis of the experiences of leading Western and East Asian economies.\n\nStill, much has changed since 2004 - the relative success of some developing countries in weathering the global financial crisis has exposed the latent contradictions of the…\n\nPreview\n\nPenis Envy and Other Bad Feelings\n\nBy Mari Ruti,\n\nWhy did Todd love this book?\n\nAlthough Ruti’s book is not directly about capitalism, it includes perhaps the best psychoanalytic proposal of confronting the imperatives of capitalist society that I have ever read. Ruti discusses how sexism operates within capitalism primarily in the book, but her point is always about how concepts from psychoanalysis that seem retrograde—such as penis envy—can actually be the basis for a critique of capitalism and sexism.\n\nBy Mari Ruti,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Penis Envy and Other Bad Feelings as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMari Ruti combines theoretical reflection, cultural critique, feminist politics, and personal experience to analyze the prevalence of bad feelings in contemporary everyday life. Proceeding from a playful engagement with Freud's idea of penis envy, Ruti's autotheoretical commentary fans out to a broader consideration of neoliberal pragmatism. She focuses on the emphasis on good performance, high productivity, constant self-improvement, and relentless cheerfulness that characterizes present-day Western society. Revealing the treacherousness of our fantasies of the good life, particularly the idea that our efforts will eventually be rewarded-that things will eventually get better-Ruti demystifies the false hope that often causes us to…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism\n\nBy David M. Kotz,\n\nFrom my list on class warfare and that the wrong class is winning.\n\nBy Robert Chernomas Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nNeoliberalism and I have grown up in opposition to one another over the past four decades. As a professor of economics, union, and political activist I have observed, wrote about, and resisted its effects on the life chances of the great majority of its citizens with particular focus on the United States as its primary protagonist and gatekeeper. The opposition to this transformative epoch included writing about the significant contributions of my profession to Neoliberal economics in two previous books; The Profit Doctrine: The Economists of the Neoliberal Era and Economics in the 21st Century: A Critical Perspective.\n\nRobert's book list on class warfare and that the wrong class is winning\n\nWhy did Robert love this book?\n\nIn addition to its excellent coverage of the economics of this transformation, its historical account of the shift in class partnerships makes a unique contribution to our understanding of the period. In the Golden Age of the previous period Big Business maintained a fraught alliance with its unions willing to pay growing wages closely aligned with labor productivity growth with the grudging acceptance of higher taxes and regulations of the Keynesian era leaving small business to fend for itself. Once Japan and Germany reindustrialized creating a more competitive economic landscape Kotz describes the full-blown class warfare identified by Buffet as Big Business realigned with small business to fight for cuts to its wages, taxes, regulatory costs and unions, and progressive politics.\n\nBy David M. Kotz,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Rise and Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe financial and economic collapse that began in the United States in 2008 and spread to the rest of the world continues to burden the global economy. David Kotz, who was one of the few academic economists to predict it, argues that the ongoing economic crisis is not simply the aftermath of financial panic and an unusually severe recession but instead is a structural crisis of neoliberal, or free-market, capitalism. Consequently, continuing stagnation cannot be resolved by policy measures alone. It requires major institutional restructuring.\n\n\"Kotz's book will reward careful study by everyone interested in the question of\n\nstages in…\n\nPreview\n\nThiefing a Chance\n\nBy Rebecca Prentice,\n\nWhy did Alanna love this book?\n\nIn Thiefing a Chance, Rebecca Prentice shows us what life is like for women who make clothing in a factory in Trinidad – a livelihood shared by more than 75 million people worldwide, most of them in the Global South. I recommend this book because although Prentice discusses the ways that late-capitalism and neoliberal structural reforms have produced the difficult economic and working conditions that her research participants must cope with, she also shows how the women are not passive subjects in these processes. She documents how they take every opportunity on the factory floor to informally gain skills and to make ‘illicit’ garments out of spare materials, which they can sell outside of work.\n\nHowever, Prentice resists the temptation to analyze these practices as ‘social resistance,’ and instead shows how such informal practices actually encourage these women to embrace neoliberal identities of competitive, enterprising individuals.\n\nBy Rebecca Prentice,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Thiefing a Chance as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen an IMF-backed program of liberalization opened Trinidad’s borders to foreign ready-made apparel, global competition damaged the local industry and unraveled worker entitlements and expectations but also presented new economic opportunities for engaging the “global” market. This fascinating ethnography explores contemporary life in the Signature Fashions garment factory, where the workers attempt to exploit gaps in these new labor configurations through illicit and informal uses of the factory, a practice they colloquially refer to as “thiefing a chance.”\n\nDrawing on fifteen months of fieldwork, author Rebecca Prentice combines a vivid picture of factory life, first-person accounts, and anthropological analysis to…\n\nPreview"
