Rather, our ambition is to explore how the idea and practice of ‘reform’ encodes a distinctive theological inheritance, inter alia.\n\nBroadly we argue that considering welfare policy as a ‘governmentalizing’ power, with an assemblage of definitions which classify individuals as unemployed (Boland and Griffin, 2015), explains much of how welfare policy works, but does not explore its whys and wherefores – or what it means. In this chapter we explore the deeper formulation of problems that foreshadow their solution, as a theological impulse to reformat people and the polity at large.\n\nWelfare is broadly an anti-revolutionary construct (Ewald, 2020), an insurance against unrest that guarantees the state’s existence, maintenance and adaptation. This idea follows in the footsteps of Machiavelli’s originality as a prophet of policymaking with a deep understanding of instrumental, managerialist political thinking, and his general concern for political continuity through internal stability (Berlin, 1974). In his lesser known Florentine Histories, he dispassionately considers the Ciompi Revolt, an insurrection of the lowest stratum of Florentine working classes (1378), which led to revolution, the overthrow of the elite and instituting of a radical democracy. Machiavelli departed from the historical orthodoxy of Bracciolini, who suggested the insurrection was God’s wrath on the city, and Bruni who had little sympathy for the violent criminals or for treating the revolt as a political movement (Winters, 2012). Machiavelli retells the story as a lesson: an excess of poverty can spill over into political violence which can even topple the Medici dynasty for a while, something every leader must keep under a keen eye.\n\nFrom medieval peasant rebellions met by dispensations for the poor, to post-war opportunities for reconstruction, the state frequently prescribes welfare as a salve to inequality and suffering, without systemic change. This is evident in the post-1968 era which saw the final evisceration of the radical left after the supposedly ‘history-ending’ coup de grâce of 1989. Creative destruction, chaos, the ex nihilo impulse to rise up and revolt are irreconcilable with policy reform. Although the birth of the welfare state in the post-war era is often presented as a new perpetual settlement, it is an amalgam of older concepts from the ‘poor law’ pensions, old age and child care, universal healthcare, poverty alleviation schemes and income protection that are assembled together. Importantly, it is also an explicit gesture towards rapprochement in Europe, an armistice to the continent’s repeated state of fratricidal war. Welfare is a salve to moderate rather than address inequality (Pickett and Wilkinson, 2009; Piketty, 2020), to do enough to keep people off the streets, and welfare is thus most compelling when those with wealth and power fear for their position and lives, and welfare recedes when they are comfortable.\n\nRevolution is animated by ideologies that announce their ambitions. The current intense epoch of welfare reform (Esping-Andersen, 2002) has rippled out from the Scandinavian shift towards more activation, taking hold in the USA under Regan and Clinton, Germany in the Hartz reforms, France under Sarkozy, and Britain from Thatcher, Blair and Cameron. Yet, these reforms are just as political as revolutions, seeking to transform society in line with ideal horizons: not a revolutionary apocalypse, but an earthly ‘City of God’ where individuals are tested, judged and reformed.\n\nTo ground these diagnoses of welfare reform, we will examine specific welfare reforms, from crisis, through politics, to policy, concentrating on the recent EU Youth Guarantee. Later we argue that welfare processes put the unemployed through trials, in an attempt to transform them. But first, we must clarify the matter of reformation."
