Muhammad Abdallah (retd), says President Muhammadu Buhari has approved recruitment of 5,000 personnel for the agency to boost its manpower. Abdallah made the disclosure on Friday at the Public Destruction of Drug Exhibits by Taraba Command of NDLEA in Jalingo. He said that the gesture would go a long way in improving operations of the agency on campaign against drug addiction in Nigeria. He said increased consumption of illicit drugs among the youths in Taraba was worrisome, appealing to families to brace up to their responsibilities. According to Abdallah, effective drug prevention must involve positive engagement of children, youths and adults with their families, schools, workplace and community. He commended Gov. Darius Ishaku of Taraba for his support to the agency in addressing drug problems in the state. He also commended Mrs Anna Darius, wife of the governor, for giving great impetus to the war against drug abuse in the state. The chairman thanked the governor for including NDLEA commandant in the state’s Security Council as well as supporting the agency with operational vehicles. He noted that the provision of Hope Afresh Foundation, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), managed by the wife of the governor for sensitisation against drug abuse was a great boost to anti-drug abuse campaign. Earlier, Acting Commander of NDLEA in the state, Mr Peter Odaudu, had said that the agency had assembled seven tonnes (6,963.80 kilogrammes) of deadly weeds and psychotropic substances for destruction. Odaudu said that the exhibits were seized between January, 2003 and December, 2018. He listed some of the illicit drugs assembled for destruction as Cannabis Sativa, Diazepam, Rophynol, Cough syrups with codeine and Tramadol. According to him, a court order for their destruction has been duly obtained. Odaudu commended other security agencies in the state for their cooperation in the success recorded by the NDLEA. He commended the state government for supporting the agency towards ensuring effective control in consumption of illicit drugs in the state. In his remarks, the state governor, Mr Darius Ishaku, said that drug consumption had increased violent crimes in the state. Ishaku, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Alhaji Haruna Manu, said that most persons arrested for violent crimes in the state were youths. He, therefore, urged the youths to avoid the use of illicit drugs, saying that it was dangerous to their health and the society. He also urged the agency to collaborate with office of the First Lady to achieve more feat in its mandate of ensuring a drug-free society. Ishaku said that the construction of health centres by the first lady’s foundation for sensitisation in the three senatorial zones was a better platform to adopt by the agency. He assured the agency of continued support by the state government to eradicate drug abuse.

Think of Dr. Kenneth Chien as a heart mechanic. \"We're making a heart part and (eventually) we're going to put the part in,\" is how he describes the work by his team of Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers. Lots of work remains before trying that dramatic an experiment in people. But regenerating damaged heart muscle is a holy grail in cardiac care. Doctors today have lots of treatments to prevent a heart attack. But once one strikes, there's no way to restore the heart muscle it kills. Gradually the weakened heart quits pumping properly, leading to deadly heart failure. Hence the focus on embryonic stem cells, master cells that can give rise to any tissue in the body. Until now, scientists haven't known how to coax those cells into producing pure cardiac muscle. Instead, researchers have tried injecting heart attack survivors with mixes of different kinds of stem cells, next-generation types like those found in bone marrow. The idea: Perhaps once those cells were inside a damaged heart, ones capable of growing cardiac muscle would receive a \"get to work\" signal and take root. There's been little success so far. The new research, published in Friday's edition of the journal Science, promises a more targeted approach. \"It's not the home run,\" cautioned Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which is spending millions on research nationwide into cardiac regeneration. \"But it's a major advance that's helping to move the field forward in a very significant way.\" Embryonic stem cells give rise to more specialized organ-producing stem cells. The team from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Mass General recently discovered a master heart stem cell present in both human and mouse embryos. But could they control it enough to make just the kind of heart cell they wanted to grow? They'd have to winnow out the daughter cell whose only job is to grow the muscle fibers of the ventricle, or pumping chamber. Chien genetically engineered mice so that certain cells in the embryos' developing hearts would light either fluorescent red or green. As he watched the embryos grow, where the colors overlapped signaled developing heart muscle. Sure enough, when the team plucked out those cells, they were pure ventricle generators. Next Harvard engineers pitched in with a special scaffolding. The team \"seeded\" the scaffolding with these ventricle stem cells, and a thin strip of mouse heart muscle grew right in the laboratory. Not only that, it spontaneously beat, the team reported in Science and at a National Institutes of Health meeting this week on the state of cardiac regeneration. \"This looks like the kind of work a normal heart tissue strip would do,\" said Chien, director of Mass General's Cardiovascular Research Center. \"We went from embryonic stem cells to an organ.\" What next? This was not a fully developed piece of heart muscle but a thin strip. To be usable, it would have to be thicker, more three-dimensional, for more beating strength. It also needs a nourishing blood supply. So a next big challenge is pinpointing which daughter to those master heart stem cells will grow blood vessels. The NIH's Nabel said the experiment also offers a possible new opportunity for cell therapy -- that perhaps injecting the precise muscle-generating cell directly into a damaged heart would have a better chance of sticking and working. The Harvard team wants both methods tried. \"We're not saying this is going to happen tomorrow,\" said Chien, who also is working on repeating the work with human cells. \"I believe within five years,\" it might be ready to try with people.

I came across it online the other day and thought it would be fun to reprint it here. Describing yourself as a “psychic love coach” can be a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it makes you sound like a superior kind of love coach, with a phone line directly to the Divine; on the other, in a field which is seen by many as, well, a bit flaky, you could appear to be the farthest crumb clinging to the edge of the pastry crust. I rather inclined to the second view when I first met Alison Chan Lung, a fortysomething psychic love coach, in a West London flat. I had explained on the phone that I was a 39-year-old single journalist who wanted to meet a nice girl, fall in love, marry and live happily ever after. And Alison had agreed to give me a face-to-face psychic session and to coach me over the phone for four weekly half-hour sessions to help me achieve my goal. At her office, Alison, a tall, slim woman of Chinese and Irish descent, said that she had been psychic since the age of 6 when her dead grandmother, who had also been psychic, contacted her to tell her that she had special powers. After a brief period of meditation, Alison shuffled an ordinary pack of cards and asked me to pick 14 of them at random. Spreading them out face up in two rows of seven, she began the reading. In the top rank of cards was the queen of spades, directly above the two of hearts. In the near future, Alison said, I would meet a strong, dark, independent woman and have an intimate loving relationship with her. Excellent. But, Alison cautioned that a business woman (the queen of clubs, a couple of cards along), would also be in my life. I agreed to talk to her for half an hour every Friday for the next four weeks. She said she would send me a “love crystal”, a smooth pink rock the size of a pound coin that would draw love towards me — a sort of mystic girl-magnet. The weekly sessions were surprisingly harrowing. I discovered that, psychic mumbo-jumbo aside, Alison was an excellent psychologist. Her intelligent insights into my inadequacies as a man were profound and painful to confront. She told me that I hid behind jokes and flattery because I didn’t believe the real me was worthy of love. After each session I felt wrung-out but optimistic. And I began to take her seriously. She set me homework: listing six negative beliefs about relationships and women; repeating mantras such as: “I love and accept myself as I am”; and listing 50 qualities that I was looking for in a woman. In the final week, with this last list reduced to the most important qualities, I had to draw up a manifesto on a sheet of red paper. Every night, after lighting a candle and clutching my love crystal, I’d chant from the manifesto: “I now attract a wonderful, loving, attractive, soulmate into my life without delay.” Unfortunately, my flatmates overheard me one night and made my life hell for weeks. I’d be queuing at the bar in the local pub and behind me they would intone: “I now attract two pints of lager and a large gin and tonic into my life without delay.” As if that wasn’t bad enough, Alison told me to go speed dating. I was twitching with nerves when I stepped into a Knightsbridge bar to meet about 40 single women in their thirties and forties. After chanting under my breath “I love and accept myself as I am . . .” (and attracting a large gin and tonic into my life without delay), I began to feel more confident and actually enjoyed myself. I did meet two women I liked. After a couple of dates, one, a tough businesswoman (the queen of clubs?), dumped me, I suspect because during the week I dated her I grew a purple boil the size of a planet on my left cheek. The other woman, Mary, well, she’s wonderful. We’ve had many dates (she didn’t even seem to notice the boil) and we have fallen in love. A couple of months ago we went on holiday, I proposed and, guess what, in June we’re going to be married. (Note from December 2019: nearly 15 years later, Mary and I are still married and have two lovely children, a boy, 7, and a girl, 10. I don’t work for The Times any more, I now write historical novels full time from home.) My latest novel Blood’s Campaign is available in hardback from Amazon.

Composition Competition Christmas at All Saints The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols is sung by our choirs of Boys, Girls and Men on Sunday 19 December at 6:00pm. This is one of the most popular services of the year at All Saints and members of the congregation are asked to arrive no later than 5:30pm to guarantee a seat. During the service the Choirs give the first performance of two new carols, especially commissioned for the service from Sir Richard Rodney Bennett, known to many as the composer of the music for the films Murder on the Orient Express and Four Weddings and a Funeral. These two carols have been written in memory of Miss Valerie Travis, a long-standing supporter of our music, and set two traditional texts - The Holly and the Ivy and The Shepherd's Carol. For more information on the new carols, and the forthcoming broadcast on BBC Radio 3 of The Holly and the Ivy, please visit the composer's website. On Sunday 12 December at 6:00pm the Girls' Choir perform Britten's Ceremony of Carols, a sequence of medieval carols given the atmospheric accompaniment of harp and candlelight. Alongside this ever-popular, evocative wintry work, the Choir will give the first performance of the Lee Dunleavy's sequence of traditional carols - Make we Merry! This includes arrangements of many well-known carols, including Away in a Manger, Ding dong, merrily on high and The Angel Gabriel, arranged for girls' voices and harp. Our final preparations for the great Festival of Christmas begin on Friday 17 December at 6:00pm when Evensong is sung for the first of seven consecutive nights. It is especially in this final week of Advent that our attention is fixed on the messianic promises proclaimed by the ancient prophets of Israel. A distinctive feature of Evensong in this week preceding the Christmas vigil is the antiphon sung before and after the recitation of the Magnificat. Originally incorporated into the monastic office in the Middle Ages, these antiphons, often called the “Greater Antiphons” or the “O Antiphons”, add a mood of eager expectation to the liturgy that builds throughout these seven days and climaxes at Christmas. Midnight Mass is at 11:15pm on Christmas Eve and is sung by the Girls and Men to a setting by Cécile Chaminade and includes the anthem The word made flesh by Philip Wilby. Christmas Day sees a said celebration of the Mass at 8:00am with Carols, and the Festal Choral Eucharist of Christmas Day at 10:30am sung by the Boys and Men. The Festal Choral Eucharist will be accompanied by string ensemble, who will join the choir to perform music by Bach and Haydn, as well as a number of your favourite carols. All are welcome to all of our services and events, which are Free with collections being taken to help defray the not inconsiderable costs of mounting such a large programme.

Stations have the right to edit out offer announcements on PBS programs but may not insert any other announcements of program-related offers in their place or in any other part of a PBS program. Comment: This rule establishes a limited exception to PBS's prohibition against stations editing PBS programs, in recognition that some stations may wish not to air certain announcements even though they are directly related to the program itself. The availability of a program may not be conditioned on a station's agreement to broadcast these announcements. Placement on Programs. Offers of the following items are permitted to appear between the end of main program content and the closing PBS logo: (a) transcripts (printed, audio cassette, or videocassette), including videocassettes of other episodes of a series that are serially connected to the episode in which the offer appears (e.g., an offer of the entire \"Jewel in the Crown\" series on a \"Jewel in the Crown\" episode of MASTERPIECE THEATRE) ; (b) companion works (defined as an underlying work upon which the program or series is substantially based, or a derivative work that contains substantially the same material as appears in the program or series); (c) viewer guides (synopses, reading lists, etc.); (d) learning materials (textbooks, workbooks, etc.); (e) college credit or course information; or (f) mentions (not offers for sale) of the availability of any of the above items in book stores or elsewhere. Unless they qualify for a combination offer as described in the final paragraph of this section, program-related items that do not fall within any of the foregoing categories must appear after the PBS logo, preferably as the first element following the logo. These include items such as: (a) videocassettes of episodes from a series that are not serially connected to the episode on which the offer appears (e.g., an offer of \"Jewel in the Crown\" on \"The Bretts\" episodes of MASTERPIECE THEATRE); (b) compilations of series and other material. An offer announcement may also appear immediately after the PBS logo in intermissions permitted by PBS Program Management. When the fulfillment entity is the same for all items being offered, whether the items qualify for pre-logo placement or post-logo placement, a combination offer is generally preferred. This means that post-logo items may be offered with pre-logo items in a pre-logo :15 offer; or vice versa, in a post-logo offer of up to :30. The offer should not come between the production credits and the funding credits. Comment: FCC rules provide only that announcements may not interrupt regular programming. Hence, we have limited the placement of announcements to those breaks in which PBS rules permit the placement of underwriting credits or optional fill material. Placement on Program Promos. Offers may not appear in program promos except where it is determined that such materials would be valuable to viewers' understanding of program content in advance of broadcast to be used most effectively. This rule recognizes that advance receipt of program-related materials may encourage viewing and enhance viewer participation in certain programs. (These guidelines do not cover \"stand-alone\" offers. Such announcements are, in part, the subject of other policy considerations and may be distributed independently of a PBS program in any event.) Program Length. PBS's standard program lengths are meant to be inclusive of all offers of program-related materials and fill material, whether placed before or after the PBS logo. Finished programs may not vary from these standard lengths. Subsequent Releases. If the items offered are no longer available for subsequent releases of the program, it is the producer's responsibility, at its own expense, to remove the offer and substitute material which fills out the program to the standard length.

That conversation is being given a new voice and a new tone by inviting suicide attempt survivors to share their insights on both staying alive and finding hope. The mission of the Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force of the Action Alliance is to create a resource that would convey the voice of suicide attempt survivors. The untold stories of hope and recovery that belong to attempt survivors are the stories of suicide prevention; what they learned is what we all must learn. With these new voices come new ideas, new questions, and new insights. The Way Forward emerges from those new voices. For far too many years suicide prevention has not engaged the perspectives of those who have lived through suicidal experiences. Because of social stigma and fear, as well as personal shame, a culture of silence prevailed. The Way Forward represents a seminal moment in this field’s history; it is an opportunity to benefit from the lived experience of suicide attempt survivors. Many of its recommendations are derived from evidence-based practices, and several are aspirational. All are grounded in the evidence of recovery and resiliency that is clear in the lives of our Task Force members. Viewing suicide prevention through the lens of the eight core values presented in The Way Forward can help us enhance safety while also bringing hope and meaning to those in suicidal despair. It is our hope that The Way Forward will also help serve as a bridge to developing a conversation about suicide prevention between mental health policymakers and consumer advocates. Often, many mental health professionals have narrowly focused on ‘identifying persons at risk and getting them into treatment.’ Conversely, many mental health consumer advocates either avoid or react negatively to suicide prevention discussions, at times due to traumas associated with historically coercive practices and policies. This resource may enable these two powerful forces for change to come together and develop new, more effective approaches to reducing suicide attempts and deaths. Like the Task Force itself, we, its co-leads, bring a range of personal and professional perspectives to these efforts. Through our work together over years, one a survivor of suicide attempts and mental health advocate, the other a psychologist with years of experience working with people in suicidal crisis, we have come to believe that collaboration and understanding are critical. Like all of the partners, colleagues, and supporters that helped to develop this resource, we feel deeply that suicide is preventable. It will be the spirit of collaboration – from policy-makers and advocates to clinicians and clients – that will make suicide prevention possible. We greatly hope that The Way Forward will serve as a model for your new collaborations with others, aligned around a new vision for a world free of the tragedy of suicide.

These Core Values were generated through an extensive dialogue of the Task Force membership. Many are based in the tenets of mental health recovery developed through decades of work by peer advocates, behavioral health professionals, and community feedback. They reflect the consensus perspectives that emerged and were clarified through Task Force discussions and correspond with many protective factors that counter risk for suicidal thinking and behavior. “Our best route to understanding suicide is… directly through the study of human emotions described in plain English, in the words of the suicidal person.” – Shneidman in The Suicidal Mind, 1996. Part 1: The Core Values Part 2: Core Values in Relation to Recovery and the National Strategy Summary of TASK FORCE Recommendations Attempt survivors as helpers: self-help, peer support, and inclusion Every form of help and support for someone who has been suicidal depends on that person’s willingness and capability to seek and accept help. Further, given that the suicidal crisis is predominately internal, all changes, regardless of where they are initiated, must ultimately occur within individuals. Beginning with the individual attempt survivor is consistent with mental health recovery practices, person-centered care practices, and the Core Values. The journey to recovery often begins with self-help practices (e.g., self-advocacy, community involvement, religious/spiritual activity, exercise) which can be supported by family, friends, and professionals. An additional approach to extend support is the peer-operated warm line, which can provide non-crisis assistance at times when traditional services are unavailable. After surviving a suicidal crisis and successfully navigating available systems and supports, peers can model self-care practices, and provide unique and powerful contributions to another’s recovery. The Task Force recommends that suicide prevention and behavioral healthcare organizations engage, hire, and/or collaborate with peer support professionals. Beyond work as peer support professionals, attempt survivors should be included as key partners in a wide range of suicide prevention efforts. Family, friends, and support network Community connectedness is one of the Core Values and an established protective factor against suicide. An essential part of that is the assistance provided by family and friends. Each attempt survivor should define a support network, and the people in that network should be offered educational and other resources. It is important to establish who those supportive persons are and how they can assist before, during, and after a crisis. Family and friends also need support for themselves. Unfortunately, there are very few support resources that have been developed to fulfill this need. The Task Force recommends developing, evaluating, and promoting programs specifically intended to help the family and friends of attempt survivors. Clinical services and supports Behavioral healthcare organizations can enhance care and support for individuals experiencing, or recovering from, a suicidal crisis in multiple ways. At the leadership level, organizations should make suicide prevention a core component of care. Individual professionals should begin care with clear discussions about how they approach crisis situations. Beyond a focus on the suicidal crisis, however, professionals should conduct a comprehensive assessment that recognizes the strengths and challenges in multiple dimensions of life whenever possible. Similarly, all treatment, including the use of medication, should take place within a collaborative approach that discusses multiple options, respects informed choices, and engages a wide range of supports. While most of the professional care for suicidal persons takes place within behavioral healthcare settings, many key services are provided in general healthcare offices, clinics, and hospitals. In every setting and situation, care for someone who is in, or recovering from, a suicidal crisis would be greatly improved by addressing negative stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination around suicide and mental health issues among medical professionals. Treating people with dignity and respect can help ease tensions and facilitate the type of collaborative care relationships that are most effective in addressing suicide risk. The Task Force recommends that medical and behavioral health providers integrate principles of collaborative assessment and treatment planning into their practices. Crisis and emergency services Many crises can be addressed before emergency services are needed through the use of key crisis supports such as hotlines and crisis respite centers. In support of the Core Value emphasizing timely access to care, developing and/or sustaining supports and services that can be available 24/7/365 is critical. Yet, many people are wary of hotline services because they fear police involvement or inpatient commitment, based on prior experience or stories from others. Crisis hotlines can do much to alleviate such concerns by following protocols like those established by the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for active engagement of callers and the use of least invasive approaches, with active rescue being a “last resort.” As an additional resource, more crisis respite centers (particularly ones that employ peer providers) should be developed and promoted. In cases where active rescue, or non-medical on-site intervention, is required, it would be ideal to call a mobile crisis team that includes peer support professional. When such a team is unavailable, first responders with training about behavioral health emergencies should be engaged. The recommendations for professionals in emergency departments mirror those for general medical and behavioral healthcare professionals in many ways. Improvements in care should begin with shifting attitudes toward collaborative, respectful, and dignified treatment of persons undergoing a suicidal crisis. The person in crisis can also benefit greatly from the expanded support available from family, friends, and peers, who should be offered relevant information and resources. Peer professionals could provide additional support during onsite crisis intervention, follow-up after a crisis, or emergency department visit and/or discharge. The Task Force recommends that providers of crisis or emergency services develop formal partnerships with organizations which offer peer support services and especially organizations that are operated or driven by people with lived experience. Systems linkages and continuity of care Long-term connections between educational, social, healthcare, and behavioral healthcare settings are solidified through formal agreements and partnerships. As one example, both educational systems and hospitals can establish formal ties with peer support programs or organizations to enhance services. Connecting attempt survivors to peer specialists provides an additional source of support, connection to the community, and a means to facilitate access to other services. Continuity of care can be furthered through follow-up and/or innovative approaches with technology. Follow-up practices or programs can demonstrate compassion and caring while encouraging help-seeking. Innovative approaches such as online self-help tools and mobile applications can be used to facilitate timely access to care. The Task Force recommends that hospitals and providers of crisis services establish formal strategies for ensuring continuity of care by helping people transition to community supports. At the broadest level of support, community organizations often use communications and/or social marketing campaigns. The Action Alliance Framework for Successful Messaging encourages campaign developers and champions to have a clear strategy, convey a hopeful message, and follow relevant guidelines including maintaining safety. Those messages could be effectively promoted by individuals who have lived through a suicidal crisis. Many recommended programs and practices in The Way Forward can be seen as promising, often having evidence for supporting Core Values but lacking formally measured evidence of effects on suicidal thinking or behavior. Research and evaluation efforts are needed to strengthen the evidence base for such approaches, adding science-based knowledge to the insights from lived experience. Developing a network of professionals with lived experience related to suicide to initiate and implement such research and evaluation projects would be a major catalyst for this work. As a key message in this section, and overall, the Task Force recommends that suicide prevention and behavioral health groups engage attempt survivors as partners in developing, implementing, and evaluating efforts. Each year, millions of people in the U.S. seriously consider suicide. Some who survive suicide attempts have recurring or ongoing suicidal thoughts and feelings, and a substantial number of people attempt suicide again. It is imperative to develop and disseminate effective supports that are critically needed. Confronting and abolishing the fear, discrimination, and misunderstanding that have blocked these efforts is long overdue. With The Way Forward, the Task Force aims to begin a new and more inclusive chapter in suicide prevention, sparking the development of innovative programs and projects, altering public policy, and promoting much needed social change. The recommendations in this resource combine research and practice with lived experience from attempt survivors to help put the NSSP into action. They provide a blueprint for a newly invigorated community effort to reduce suicide attempts and deaths. Achieving these goals requires social and political support from attempt survivors, families, friends, and allies. To translate the collective vision of The Way Forward into reality, the Task Force recommends developing a national center focused on helping attempt survivors and including attempt survivor peer specialists in current mental health technical assistance centers. Core Values for Supporting Attempt Survivors Core Values in Relation to Recovery and the National Strategy In creating the Core Values, the Task Force identified values and tenets that have been used in mental health recovery, the mental health consumer movement, and personal experiences. The Task Force modified the concepts to make them more applicable to the suicide prevention context. The NSSP was a key resource. As a result, the Core Values are consistent with recognized principles of recovery and concepts used throughout the NSSP (see Table 1). Table 1. Core Values compared to recovery principles and NSSP concepts Pathways to hope, recovery, and wellness with insights from lived experience Prepared by the Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention July 2014 Activating Hope is… building upon the lived experience of people who have been through suicidal struggles to help others and prevent suicide death. The experience of those who have through with suicidal intensity, distress and attempts can be a powerful resource to reduce suicide. As recently seen, stories of recovery from and growth through periods of suicidal struggle can spread a ‘contagion of hope’ and reduce suicide publicly.

Jennifer Lawrence's dress definitely did not rip or tear while she collected her award on Sunday - ok? The Silver Linings Playbook actress set tongues wagging for all the wrong reasons when her full-length Christian Dior gown appeared to split in two as she made her way through the tables to the stage. It separated mid-thigh, with Twitter erupting into action and many fans questioning whether she'd suffered a dreaded wardrobe malfunction. \"I fell on the ground,\" she told ABC News' Chris Connelly backstage, \"Somebody's chair got stuck on my train or somebody's foot or something. I will never look at pictures of this. That's the only true way to happiness.\" Hmmm, seems as though Lawrence thought she suffered a wardrobe malfunction now doesn't it? Nevertheless, Dior came out in a fiery defense of its dress in a statement to USA Today, saying, \"The dress is made with different levels of tulle and satin, and that is what the viewers saw when Jennifer lifted her dress slightly. It was not ripped, and there was no malfunction. . It was the design of the gown.\" Couture fashion designer Bradley Bayou blamed it all on Lawrence, \"If she is just walking down the runway, she would never have a reason to lift the dress up.

The maximum number initiated per frond depends on the species. Wolffiella and Wolffia form no roots, and roots may occasionally be absent in the other groups. Lemna fronds make just one root, while Spirodela and Landoltia fronds initiate more. According to Landolt (1986) Spirodela can have as many as 21 roots per frond. We do not know what environmental factors govern the number of roots initiated. The regulation of root length depends on environmental conditions (Landolt, 1986). Except in extreme conditions, low levels of nitrogen, phosphate or trace minerals encourage longer roots, while high fertility results in very short roots, or even an absence of root. Far-red light shortens roots, suggesting that phytochrome is involved. Gibberellins may also have a role. Photo: A view from below, roots of Spirodela as collected from a wetland. The reflection at the water surface makes some of the roots appear to grow upward. Debris from the wetland still clings to some roots but will fall off as the roots grow in culture. The structure of duckweed roots is very simple. Unlike most plants, duckweed roots do not show secondary growth or branching, and do not sprout root hairs. As a result, duckweed roots are very slender, less than 0.5 mm. Like other primary roots, they can be divided into four zones: the root cap, the meristematic region, the elongation zone, and the zone of mature cells. What is the function of the duckweed root? That question may seem obvious if one knows plant physiology, but duckweeds are exceptional. Research has shown that duckweeds mostly absorb water and nutrients through the lower surface of the frond, not the roots. An experiment you can try: Paul Gorham (1941) tried painting the lower surface of Lemna fronds (but not the roots) with lanolin, a soft fat. The thin lanolin coating prevented the fronds from making direct contact with the water. He found that coated fronds grew very slowly and their roots elongated more than the roots of control plants. For another control, he painted some fronds with lanolin on the upper surface. Those fronds were unaffected. Another experiment showed that Lemna will dry up if the fronds are held above the water but with their root tips still submerged. In the water, long duckweed roots become entangled with one another. If one tries to gently pick up one plant or frond colony, often the result is to pick up several others whose roots are entangled with the first. In nature, this helps duckweeds to form loosely- connected mats on the water surface. Landolt (1986) points out that the a duckweed root provides stability to help keep the individual plants orientated rightside-up in the water as they encounter wind and water turbulance. The root is like a sea-anchor. A sea anchor does not touch bottom, but prevents a sailor's boat from drifting in the wind. In the same way, the duckweed root slows the plant's movement when the wind blows. Duckweed roots are very sticky. This is key to another root function: dispersal. Ducks and other aquatic birds land among duckweeds and eat the fronds. When they do, some of the fronds may adhere to their feathers. This allows duckweeds to hitch a ride on the bird to the next pond. In this way, duckweeds spread from one place to another. Test this experiment yourself with a duckweed frond that has one or more long roots: Pick up a frond with a stainless steel spoon or spatula. Tip the spoon and let the water drain off for just a minute. Try gently shaking the frond off. Did it still cling? Take a paper towel or tissue and gently wick the water from the root. Does it still cling? Cut the root(s) off the frond and repeat the experiment. Can you think of a way to measure the force it takes to pick up a frond clinging to a smooth surface? http://www.mobot.org/jwcross/duckweed/duckweed-root.htm The Charms of Duckweed.

The winner of the four-month long Higgs Machine Learning Challenge, launched on 12 May, is Gábor Melis from Hungary, followed closely by Tim Salimans from The Netherlands and Pierre Courtiol from France. They will receive cash prizes, sponsored by Paris-Saclay Centre for Data Science and Google, of $7000, $4000, and $2000 respectively. The three winners have been invited to participate at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference on 13 December in Canada. The Special High Energy Physics meets Machine Learning Award was given to team Crowwork's Tianqi Chen and Tong He. Though their score was 3.72 to Melis' 3.81, a thorough scrutiny showed that Crowwork's algorithm was an excellent compromise between performance and simplicity, which could improve tools currently used in high-energy physics. The team has been invited to CERN next year for a workshop where they will discuss the application of machine learning techniques in high-energy physics. The Challenge, hosted by Kaggle, had the all-time record of 1,785 teams participating. \"The Challenge is done but we are only really half-way through the project. We now have to digest the many ideas submitted by the participants, and establish long-term collaboration between high energy physics and machine learning communities,\" says David Rousseau, ATLAS physicist and organizer of the Challenge. Participants had to develop an algorithm that improves the detection of Higgs boson signal events decaying into two tau particles in a sample of simulated ATLAS data that contains few signal and a majority of non-Higgs boson \"background\" events. The observation of the Higgs boson was a groundbreaking result published by the ATLAS and the CMS experiments in 2012, leading a year later to the award of the Nobel Prize in physics to theorists who proposed the underlying theoretical mechanism. For the Challenge however, no knowledge of particle physics was required but skills in machine learning – the training of computers to recognize patterns in data – was at stake. \"In the course of the Challenge, I learned that physicists and computer scientists think in different ways. Combining their strengths might lead to better results,\" says Crowwork's Tong He. \"I hoped to win, but even if everything goes smoothly, there is always an element of luck involved. How much physics knowledge would be required was uncertain. I expected a machine learning savvy physicist to win,\" says Melis, a graduate in software engineering and mathematics. His algorithm is an ensemble of deep neural networks trained on random subsets of data provided with very little feature engineering and no physics knowledge. \"Competitions like these offer a great platform to try out new modelling techniques and update skills. The competitive element makes them fun,\" says Salimans, who has a PhD in Econometrics and works as a data science consultant. He describes his solution as a combination of a large number of boosted decision tree ensembles, with some tricks to improve statistical efficiency. \"The Higgs Machine Learning challenge was special. It shows that machine learning and data mining are very important to the world, not just in generating profit but also in cutting-edge research. In the course of the Challenge, I learned that physicists and computer scientists think in different ways. Combining their strengths might lead to better results,\" says Crowwork's Tong He, a Masters student in Data Mining and Bioinformatics at Simon Fraser University, Canada. Team Crowwork developed XG Boost, an optimized general-purpose gradient boosting (or trees) algorithm that learns the effective high order combination of input variables. The toolkit is efficiently parallelized, with good accuracy. They made this available early on in the competition to other participants also. Crowwork's Tianqi Chen developed XG Boost because his research code-base was too slow. \"XG Boost has some nice features that go beyond what existing tools offer so we thought it would be helpful to share the toolkit. We were very glad that XGBoost was adopted by many users, their feedback helped us improve it,\" says Chen, a PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Washington, Seattle. \"The huge success of the Challenge shows the fascination that the discovery of the Higgs boson, including the statistical tools used for it, holds for the public. It also reveals that experimental particle physics, in spite of its sophistication, can learn a lot from machine learning science,\" says Andreas Hoecker, physics coordinator of the ATLAS experiment. For the detailed documentation of their optimization work, the CSE_Team_0 members – Chamila Wijayarathna, Dimuthu Upeksha, Maduranga Siwriwardena, Sachith Withana – were Specially Mentioned, together with contestant Dhiana Deva. The simulated data used for the Challenge will be made available on opendata.cern.ch for those who would like to test new ideas.

What on earth was the legendary off-road company thinking? And yet, while Wrangler fans undoubtedly continue to look down their noses at the Compass – one of a trio of platform siblings along with the Dodge Caliber and Jeep Patriot – this little hatchback seems to do okay for itself with buyers, if the number I see on the road is any indication. It’s gently redesigned for 2011, with handsome new exterior styling that echoes the front of the updated Grand Cherokee, and an interior that retains the same general layout as before but with some better-quality materials, an improvement in fit-and-finish and some new controls. Also new, and added to my CVT-equipped tester, is the availability of Jeep’s Freedom Drive II system, one of nine all-wheel systems available across the company’s line-up. The system runs primarily in front-wheel drive, but when needed, it will send torque to the rear wheels. It can also be locked into 50/50 via a handle on the centre console. When the shifter is put into Low, the Compass includes a 19:1 crawl ratio and hill descent control. My tester was the Compass North, a Canada-only trim line that slots between the Sport and Limited. The North name is used specifically on a package of heated front seats and leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, although I wonder if the overall trim level name might also refer to John North Willys, the man behind the Willys brand that brought the Jeep to military prominence during the Second World War. The Compass’ standard engine is a 2.4-litre four-cylinder, but if you order a front-wheel Sport or North, you can opt for a 2.0-litre four-cylinder. Chrysler’s pricing structure tends to be confusing, with trim levels often indicated as options on base models, but the Munroney sticker on my vehicle indicated a base price of $21,195 and a final price, after numerous options, of $28,765 before taxes and freight. These included $1,750 for a continuously variable transmission (CVT) in place of the stock five-speed manual, $750 for adding the Freedom Drive II in place of the model’s standard Freedom Drive I, and an upgraded stereo with satellite radio. The Compass has its good points, but I have to admit that it didn’t feel like almost $29,000 worth of car. Especially since, ironically enough, it didn’t contain a compass.This extra low-gear ability allows the Compass, for the first time, to wear the coveted Jeep “Trail-Rated” badge. The badge indicates off-road worthiness in traction, ground clearance, manoeuvrability, articulation and water fording. There is a caveat, however: the Trail-Rated designation is Jeep’s own, not an industry standard, and the company doesn’t divulge exactly what minimum requirements a vehicle must meet in order to earn the badge. That said, having driven a Patriot with the Freedom Drive II system on a challenging snow-covered course through woods and fields, it performed much better than I expected for an “off-road lite” system. Equipped with good winter tires, it made its way around the trail in snow that came up almost to the bumper and then took a deep gully in stride. While it certainly wouldn’t have the rock-climbing cred of the Jeep Wrangler that was also part of the event, it performed just as well as the Wrangler on a trail that would pretty much be the roughest that most drivers would ever ask it to cross. Whatever the Trail Rated badge entails, the Drive II Compass definitely appears to earn the right to wear it. Still, in the grand scheme of things, the Compass is sized to be an urban commuter, and for most people going about their daily driving chores, this little Jeep may well be a contender among their choices. I really like that all the seats fold down flat, including the front passenger chair, part of the North package. With all seats up, the cargo hold is 75 cm long. Fold the second-row seats and it lengthens to 150 cm, while dropping the front seat opens it up to a length of 245 cm, enough to bring home an eight-foot piece of lumber. On its own, the Compass will tow 450 kg (1,000 lbs), and with the $225 trailer tow prep package added to mine, it increases to 907 kg (2,000 lbs).Part of the problem lies in the CVT. These transmissions are all over the map when it comes to noise and performance: some are very pleasant to drive and some considerably less so, and I’ve sometimes found both types in different vehicles from the same manufacturer. The Compass’ engine, producing 172 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, is a little rough and growly, and the CVT emphasizes that, so the entire package is noisy as it drones up and down the tachometer. It’s not helped by the road noise that comes up from the asphalt, either. Don’t expect to be drag racing too many competitors off the lights, as acceleration is leisurely, and the low gear on the Freedom Drive II supersedes the manual mode that you get on the CVT without Drive II. As my husband wrote down in my notebook, “When accelerating to pass, the Compass has the sound of desperation.” For those who dinghy-tow behind an RV, only the 4×4 with manual transmission can be flat-towed; the CVT model cannot be hooked up this way. The brakes are good, though, with nice pedal feel and solid bite. My fuel consumption was less than stellar, which may have been due to the bitterly cold weather: against published figures of 9.9 L/100 km (29 mpg Imp) in the city and 7.5 (38) on the highway, the best I could get was 13.1 (22) in combined driving. I really like the ultra-simple controls, which consist of three big dials for the climate system, big buttons for the stereo, air vents that pop open or closed with a quick touch, a centre console box lid that slides forward as an armrest, and clear, easy-to-read instruments in the cluster. The centre console box and an open dash cubby over the glove-box provide quick storage. The first-row seats are relatively comfortable, although I’d question their ability to remain so on long trips; the second-row seats have okay legroom and they recline slightly, but the Bonneville salt flats have more contours than these cushions. Put the children back there while you can still quiet their complaints with promises of ice cream, and if you’re the driver on carpool duty, remember who fails to make another pot when the office coffeemaker goes dry.Still, there are a couple of sour notes. Should you use a tall travel mug, you’ll probably end up knocking it against the shifter when you take it out of the front cupholder, and if you’ve slid the armrest forward, you’ll hit that when accessing your drink from the rear cupholder. That pales beside a cubby in the centre console that’s covered by the parking brake lever any time the brake isn’t on, rendering it completely inaccessible when you’re driving. Didn’t any of the designers stop and give this a second look? Pricing: 2011 Jeep Compass North 4×4 Options: $7,570 (Customer Preferred Package of 60/40 reclining and folding rear seats, height-adjustable driver’s seat, fold-flat passenger seat, deep-tint glass, heated mirrors, keyless entry, air conditioning, 115-volt outlet, power windows, power locks, illuminated entry, body-colour door handles and liftgate appliqué and North badge, $3,300; Sirius satellite radio group including auto-dimming mirror with microphone, one-year subscription, Bluetooth and Uconnect voice control, $625; trailer tow prep group, $225; North All-Season Group of heated front seats and leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, $495; Freedom Drive II off-road group, $750; CVT, $1,750; six-CD/DVD/MP3 media centre, $225; full-size spare tire, $200) Buyer’s Guide: 2011 Jeep Compass Crash test results Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) The Compass has its feet on both the positive and negative sides of the equation. On the good side, it’s better-looking both inside and out than before, its flat-folding seats make it very practical for carrying goods (at eight feet in total length, it can carry longer items than some pickup trucks), its controls are simple to operate, and its optional Freedom Drive II system works great in rougher terrain without moving to the Wrangler’s bouncy ride. On the down side, its growly engine and transmission don’t measure up to many competitors, some ergonomics could be much better, and it tends to get pricey when you add options. Each buyer must test-drive and decide individually, and there are enough of these vehicles out there that they definitely have appeal to many drivers. It’s up to you whether it’s a Jeep thing that you understand. This entry was posted in Gallery, Reviews and tagged 2011, 4×4, Compass, Jeep, North.

I looked at the woman sitting in the car next to me. She had this startled look on her face. We were all thinking the same thing. We looked out the front of our windows to try to see the plane, and it wasnt until a few seconds later that we realized the jet was coming up behind us on that major highway. And it veered to the right into the Pentagon. The blast literally rocked all of our cars. It was an incredible moment.[1] Aydan Kizildrgli, an English language student who is a native of Turkey, saw the jetliner bank slightly then strike a western wall of the huge five-sided building that is the headquarters of the nation's military. \"There was a big boom,\" he said. \"Everybody was in shock. I turned around to the car behind me and yelled 'Did you see that?' Nobody could believe it.\" Donald R. Bouchoux \"I was driving down Washington Boulevard (Route 27) along the side of the Pentagon when the aircraft crossed about 200 yards in front of me and impacted the side of the building. There was an enormous fireball, followed about two seconds later by debris raining down. The car moved about a foot to the right when the shock wave hit. I had what must have been an emergency oxygen bottle from the airplane go flying down across the front of my Explorer.... Daryl Donley, saw the crash as he was driving on Washington Boulevard. Among debris that was scattered as the plane crashed, he found a \"scorched green oxygen tank marked 'Cabin air. Airline use' \" on the road.... Mark Bright, a police officer at the Pentagon, saw the plane hit the building. He had been manning the guard booth at the Mall Entrance to the building. \"I saw the plane at the Navy Annex area,\" he said. \"I knew it was going to strike the building because it was very, very low -- at the height of the street lights. It knocked a couple down.\" The plane would have been seconds from impact -- the annex is only a few hundred yards from the Pentagon. He said he heard the plane \"power-up\" just before it struck the Pentagon. Tim Timmerman, who is a pilot himself, noticed American Airlines markings on the aircraft as he saw it hit the Pentagon.[56] it had been an American Airways 757. \"It added power on its way in,\" he said. \"The nose hit, and the wings came forward and it went up in a fireball.\" \"I was looking out the window; I live on the 16th floor, overlooking the Pentagon, in a corner apartment, so I have quite a panorama. And being next to National Airport, I hear jets all the time, but this jet engine was way too loud. I looked out to the southwest, and it came right down 395, right over Colombia Pike, and as it went by the Sheraton Hotel, the pilot added power to the engines. Frank Probst, left the Wedge 1 construction site trailer [and] began walking to the Modular Office Compound, which is located beyond the extreme north end of the Pentagon North Parking Lot, for a meeting at 10 a.m. As he approached the heliport, he noticed a plane flying low over the Annex and heading right for him. The aircraft pulled up, seemingly aiming for the first floor of the building, and leveled off. Rick Renzi: The plane came in at an incredibly steep angle with incredibly high speed.\" \"The jet creamed in at a dive bombing angle\" http://web.archive.org/web/20011228113620/ http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1590000/video/_1593685_pentagon17_biles_vi.ram James Ryan: Within a hundred feet. It was very low. At that point he tilted his wings this way and this way (mimics), And the plane was slow, so that happened concurrently with the engines going down. (mimics) And then straightened out sort of suddenly and hit full gas. http://digipressetmp3.teaser.fr/uploads/488/Ryan2.ram Anonymous at Pentagon: At approximately 9:45am I entered the old office of my friend Gary Ramos', directly adjacent to the executive director.... As I stood there, I instinctively ducked at the extremely loud roar and whine of a jet engine spooling up.... The aircraft, looking to be either a 757 or Airbus, seemed to come directly over the annex, as if it had been following Columbia Pike - an Arlington road leading to Pentagon.... The aircraft was at a sharp downward angle of attack, on a direct course for the Pentagon. It was \"clean\", in as much as, there were no flaps applied and no apparent landing gear deployed. He was slightly left wing down as he appeared in my line of sight, as if he'd just \"jinked\" to avoid something. As he crossed Route 110 he appeared to level his wings, making a slight right wing slow adjustment as he impacted low on the Westside of the building..... Mike Walter, USA Today reporter, while driving on Washington Boulevard, also witnessed the crash. He recounted to CNN, \"...looked out my window. I saw this plane, the jet, American Airlines jet coming. And I thought, this doesn't add up. It's really low. And I saw it. It just went I mean, it was like a cruise missile with wings, it went right there and slammed right into the Pentagon. Huge explosion.\" Steve Storti: Time seemed to slip into slow motion as he watched the plane cross over Route 395, tip its left wing as it passed the Navy annex, veer sharply and then slice into the Pentagon. \"I remember thinking that whoever is flying this knows what they're doing,\" Storti said. Afework Hagos, a computer programmer, was on his way to work but stuck in a traffic jam on Columbia Pike near the Pentagon when the plane flew over. \"There was a huge screaming noise and I got out of the car as the plane came over. Everybody was running away in different directions. It was tilting its wings up and down like it was trying to balance. It hit some lampposts on the way in.\"[4] Penny Elgas exited I-395 and came on to Washington Boulevard, heading towards the Memorial Bridge. She was \"stuck in late morning rush hour traffic, almost in front of the Pentagon. Traffic was at a standstill. I heard a rumble, looked out my driver's side window and realized that I was looking at the nose of an airplane coming straight at us from over the road (Columbia Pike) that runs perpendicular to the road I was on. The plane just appeared there- very low in the air, to the side of (and not much above) the CITGO gas station that I never knew was there. My first thought was Oh My God, this must be World War III! In that split second, my brain flooded with adrenaline and I watched everything play out in ultra slow motion.... ...In my adrenaline-filled state of mind, I was overcome by my visual senses. ... At the second that I saw the plane, my visual senses took over completely and I did not hear or feel anything -- not the roar of the plane, or wind force, or impact sounds.... ...I saw the plane coming in slow motion toward my car and then it banked in the slightest turn in front of me, toward the heliport. In the nano-second that the plane was directly over the cars in front of my car, the plane seemed to be not more than 80 feet off the ground and about 4-5 car lengths in front of me. It was far enough in front of me that I saw the end of the wing closest to me and the underside of the other wing as that other wing rocked slightly toward the ground. I remember recognizing it as an American Airlines plane -- I could see the windows and the color stripes. And I remember thinking that it was just like planes in which I had flown many times but at that point it never occurred to me that this might be a plane with passengers.... ....The plane seemed to be floating as if it were a paper glider and I watched in horror as it gently rocked and slowly glided straight into the Pentagon. At the point where the fuselage hit the wall, it seemed to simply melt into the building. I saw a smoke ring surround the fuselage as it made contact with the wall. It appeared as a smoke ring that encircled the fuselage at the point of contact and it seemed to be several feet thick. I later realized that it was probably the rubble of churning bits of the plane and concrete. The churning smoke ring started at the top of the fuselage and simultaneously wrapped down both the right and left sides of the fuselage to the underside, where the coiling rings crossed over each other and then coiled back up to the top. Then it started over again -- only this next time, I also saw fire, glowing fire in the smoke ring. At that point, the wings disappeared into the Pentagon. And then I saw an explosion and watched the tail of the plane slip into the building. It was here that I closed my eyes for a moment and when I looked back, the entire area was awash in thick black smoke.\" http://www.debunk911myths.org/topics/Pentagon_witnesses http://911research.wtc7.net/pentagon/evidence/witnesses/sgydk.html http://www.playaudiovideo.com/msearch?co=v&loc=29-114232983-1-0-114232969&wo=plane+crash Flight Paths into WTC - 9/11 Commission http://ie.youtube.com/watch?v=YJX2fStDMo4 Last edited by Fintan on Mon Feb 25, 2019 6:00 pm; edited 1 time in total Wow....there is NOTHING better than coming home for the day and literally seeing a new audio from Dunne....fantastic lol, and I haven't even listened to it yet, double fantastic lol. Pretty interesting now with getting technical Fintan, I surely thought back to the Final Verdict series, which ironically, I have just listened to both of them today, I think I go through all of your audios at least 2-3 times a day lol. Look forward to more great analysis. Excellent, thanks Fintan. I always figured it was done by some sort of auto-pilot system but having the planes full of passengers was a new one for me. Some think that building 7 was the 'command centre' for this and thus had to be destroyed afterwards. From Joe Vialls: Electronically Hijacking the WTC Attack Aircraft Forget the media hype about \"Arab hijackers\" because there were none on board any of the aircraft on 11 September. Outrageous, you say? The four aircraft used in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, were hijacked electronically from the ground, and flown into their respective targets without the consent of the pilots, who were rendered helpless by the advanced technology used. http://vialls.homestead.com/ http://geocities.com/mknemesis/homerun.html Oh dear, the links are dead, no pun intended. Oh my, a 360 degree turn in broad daylight. WHY? 1) Fire and fire alone had absolutely nothing to do with the actual collapse of the twins---IF IT DID then Tower one would have fallen first. 2) The ultra slow eyewitness account was akin to a script--too obvious. Who speaks like that in the real world/? NOBODY. 3) Why not show real time video of the Plane at the Pentagon and put the speculation to rest once and for all! Wait don't tell me >> all part of the plan to confound and confuse---got it-- 4) Steel the likes used in the construction of those towers would NEVER--not in 1 million years be turned to dust, nano particulate, or gnat assed sized spheres of any kind by the energy from the collapse ALONE~~~NO WAY! Questions: What is going on here? Why the contradictions ? How can fire do in two absent all of the HOLLYWOOD STYLE FUEL spent \" OUTSIDE \" the building? Isn't that the culprit---Fire needs fuel---something about a triangle comes to mind. lol Being hit lower is a rabbit hole and in that regard the KISS METHOD eliminates any further discussion due to most all fuel burning up outside the building. Besides commons sense ( is that still allowed ) says that Tower 2 being struck in the corner ( more toward the corner ) would have caused Two to topple LONG LONG before it would have ever collapsed in the manner that was seen! How do you account for the 46 minutes of difference in time from beginning to end for Tower 1 vs Tower 2? ANYONE? Another thing: A Pilot who would have gotten COLD FEET would have been blown from the sky within a few seconds of changing his mind. As it's been said 100% IS 100% CONTROL-- Eyewitness accounts cut both ways: Who said: \" From my vantage point it doesn't look like a plane hit the pentagon at all \" How can a seasoned CNN Reporter make such a mistake? Too many holes this time around and too little time to double back for verification! Remote controlled Planes! Really. Never in the History of the world has there even been an event that has generated more play on words that 9-11. Much of it is lost in the shuffle, especially by those less inclined to THINK with an open mind. What is possible, or was possible, doesn't exist where 9-11 is concerned and that's the real shame of it all. A grave mistake to underestimate technology on one hand only to promote it on the other. Russian leaders offing themselves due to guilt from murder: How many near 9-11 have done the same? Hombre' With all due respect to Fintan"
