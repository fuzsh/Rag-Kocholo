        "text": "Before the What Are You Reading posts from the Central APA, this feature was looking at work done on specific philosophers. Now that those posts are over and the Pacific has yet to start, we are going to revisit that theme. Giogio Agamben was born on April 22, 1942 in Rome, Italy. He is most well-known in the US for his work Homo Sacer, which explores the concept of the state of exception and the sacred human. Here is some of the most recent work done on him:\n\nJacob Meskin and Shapiro, Harvey, “‘To Give an Example is a Complex Act’: Agamben’s pedagogy of the paradigm,” Educational Philosophy & Theory, April 2014.\n\nSusan Dianne Brophy, “Meaningless Authenticity: The Ethical Subject in Agamben’s Early Works,” Critical Horizons, August 2015.\n\nTyson Edward Lewis, “It’s a Profane Life: Giorgio Agamben on the freedom of im-potentiality in education,” Educational Philosophy & Theory, April 2014.\n\nMichael Peters, “Giorgio Agamben’s Homo Sacer Project,” Educational Philosophy & Theory, April 2014.\n\nAdam Kotsko, “Genealogy and Political Theology: On Method in Agamben’s The Kingdom and the Glory,” Political Theology, February 2013\n\n*"
