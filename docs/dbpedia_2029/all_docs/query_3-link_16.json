        "text": "Sergio Osmena Jr., an exiled Filipino politician and businessman, who ran against President Ferdinand E. Marcos in his campaign for re-election in 1969, died yesterday of respiratory failure at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 67 years old and lived in Beverly Hills.\n\nMr. Osmena, a member of a wealthy and socially prominent family in Cebu Province, was a former governor of Cebu and mayor of Cebu City. His father, Sergio Osmena Sr., was the wartime Filipino President-in-exile who waded ashore with Gen. Douglas MacArthur when the Americans returned at the end of World War II.\n\nThe younger Mr. Osmena was a veteran of the often violent feuds that marked Filipino politics until President Marcos imposed martial law inSeptember 1972.\n\nMr. Osmena was elected Governor of Cebu in 1951, defeating a rival family's political machine. He resigned in 1953 after backing Elpidio Quirino, the losing presidential candidate against Ramon Magsaysay. Served as Representative\n\nKnown to harbor presidential ambitions, he later became a Liberal Party member of the House of Representatives but was suspended in 1960 after intimating that Mr. Magsaysay's successor, Carlos P. Garcia, had taken a large bribe and run a corrupt administration.\n\nMr. Osmena was a Senator in 1969 when he challenged President Marcos, who was running for a second four-year term on the Nationalist ticket. Mr. Osmena accused the Marcos Administration of being the ''most corrupt in Philippine history.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
