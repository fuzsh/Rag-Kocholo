        "text": "The Nacionalista Party is a conservative political party in the Philippines, founded on 29 April 1907 by Manuel Quezon; it is the oldest political party in Southeast Asia. The original party was founded in 1901 during the Philippine-American War, espousing self-rule, and it first attained representation in the Philippine Assembly in 1907. The party advocated the full independence of the Philippines from the United States, and the party led the country for the majority of the 20th century; Presidents Quezon, Sergio Osmena, Ramon Magsaysay, Carlos P. Garcia, and Ferdinand Marcos hailed from the party. Marcos led the party from 1965 to 1972 while serving as the dictator of the Philippines; in 1972, he formed the far-right Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party, causing the Nacionalistas to briefly disappear from politics until Salvador Laurel revived it in the 1980s. The Nacionalista Party would remain conservative instead of gravitating further to the right, but Marcos' son Bongbong Marcos became a leader of the party.\n\nGallery[]"
