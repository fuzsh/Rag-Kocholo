He was Vice President under Manuel L. Quezon, and succeeded as President upon Quezon's sudden death in 1944, becoming the oldest officeholder at age 65. A founder of Nacionalista Party, he was also the first Visayan to become President of the Philippines.\n\nContents\n\nPresident sergio osmena and general douglas mcarhtur visit leyte island in philip hd stock footage\n\nPresidency\n\nWar Cabinet 194445\n\nCabinet and judicial appointments 194546\n\nLiberation\n\nRestoration of the Commonwealth\n\nGovernment reorganization\n\nRehabilitation of the Philippine National Bank\n\nPeoples court\n\nUnited Nations Charter\n\nForeign Relations Office\n\nInternational banking\n\nBell Trade Act\n\n1946 presidential election\n\nPost presidency and death\n\nFamily\n\nDescendants\n\nReferences\n\nPrior to his accession in 1944, Osmena served as Governor of Cebu from 1906 to 1907, Member and first Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1907 to 1922, and Senator from the 10th Senatorial District for thirteen years, in which capacity he served as Senate President pro tempore. In 1935, he was nominated to be the running-mate of Senate President Manuel L. Quezon for the presidential election that year. The tandem was overwhelmingly re-elected in 1941.\n\nHe was patriarch of the prominent Osmena family, which includes his son, former Senator Sergio Osmena, Jr., and his grandsons, senators Sergio Osmena III and John Henry Osmena), ex-governor Lito Osmena, and former Cebu City mayor Tomas Osmena.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nOsmena was born in Cebu City to Juana Osmena y Suico ,who was reportedly only 14 years of age when she gave birth to him. Owing to the circumstances of his birth, the identity of his father had been a closely guarded family secret. Although carrying the stigma of being an illegitimate child – Juana never married his father – he didn't allow this aspect to affect his standing in society. The Osmena family, a rich and prominent clan of Chinese Filipino heritage with vast business interests in Cebu, warmed to him as he established himself as a prominent figure in local society.Osmena received his elementary education at the Colegio de San Carlos and graduated in 1892. Osmena continued his education in Manila, studying in San Juan de Letran College where he first met Manuel L. Quezon, a classmate of his, as well as Juan Sumulong and Emilio Jacinto. He took up law at the University of Santo Tomas and was second place in the bar examination in 1903. He served on the war staff of General Emilio Aguinaldo as a courier and journalist. In 1900, he founded the Cebu newspaper, El Nuevo Dia [English: 'The New Day'] which lasted for three years.\n\nPublic Service in Cebu When Cebu Governor Juan Climaco was sent as a member of the Board of Commissioners of the St. Louis Purchase Expedition, Osmena was appointed acting governor. When Climaco returned, he was appointed as provincial fiscal. His stint there elevated him in politics when he was elected governor of Cebu in 1906.\n\nCongressional career House of Representatives While governor, he ran for election to the first National Assembly of 1907 and was elected as the first Speaker of that body. Osmena was 29 years old and already the highest-ranking Filipino official. He and another provincial politician, Manuel L. Quezon of Tayabas, set up the Nacionalista Party as a foil to the Partido Federalista of Manila-based politicians. In his first years as Speaker, he was plagued with organizational burdens as the National Assembly is still organizing. The Members of the Assembly sought to establish legislative procedures which were constantly rejected by the American superiors because they still perceive that Filipinos are incapable to be independent. Three important bills from the Assembly were rejected by the Philippine Commission:\n\nthe repeal of the Sedition law which imposed penalties on any Filipino who advocated independence;\n\nthe repeal of the Flag law which banned display of the Filipino flag;\n\nthe grant of more powers to the local governments.\n\nHowever, it did not stopped him to preside over important legislations the Assembly has passed. The creation of the Council of State and the Board of Control enabled the Philippine legislature to share some of the executive powers of the American Governor-General.\n\nIn 1916, the Jones Law was passed replacing the Philippine Commission with a Philippine Senate.\n\nQuezon-Osmena rivalry Osmena were friends and classmates with Manuel Quezon who was the Majority Floor Leader under Osmena's speakership. When the Jones Law was passed, Quezon was elected as Senate President and Osmena retained his post as Speaker.\n\nSenate In 1922 Osmena was elected to the Senate representing the 10th Senatorial District. He went to the United States as part of the OsRox Mission in 1933, to secure passage of the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Independence Bill which was superseded by the Tydings–McDuffie Act in March 1934.\n\nVice-Presidency\n\nIn 1924, Quezon and Osmena reconciled and joined forces in the Partido Nacionalista Consolidado against the threat of an emerging opposition from the Democrata Party. The reunited Nacionalista Party dominated the political scene until the second break-up when the members polarized into Pros and Antis in 1934. Quezon and Osmena again reconciled for the 1935 Presidential Election. In 1935 Quezon and Osmena won the Philippine's first national presidential election under the banner of the Nacionalista Party. Quezon obtained nearly 68% of the vote against his two main rivals, Emilio Aguinaldo and Bishop Gregorio Aglipay.\n\nThey were inaugurated on 15 November 1935. Quezon had originally been barred by the Philippine constitution from seeking re-election. However, in 1940, constitutional amendments were ratified allowing him to seek re-election for a fresh term ending in 1943. In the 1941 presidential elections, Quezon was re-elected over former Senator Juan Sumulong with nearly 82% of the vote. Re-elected in 1941, Osmena remained vice president during the Japanese occupation when the government was in exile. As Vice-President, Osmena concurrently served as Secretary of Public Instruction from 1935–40, and again from 1941–44.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion resulted in periodic and drastic changes to the government structure. Executive Order 390, 22 December 1941 abolished the Department of the Interior and established a new line of succession. Executive Order 396, 24 December 1941, further reorganized and grouped the cabinet, with the functions of Secretary of Justice assigned to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nQuezon-Osmena impasse By 1943, the Philippine Government-in-exile was faced with a serious crisis. According to the 1935 Constitution, the official term of President Quezon was to expire on 30 December 1943, and Vice-President Sergio Osmena would automatically succeed him in the Presidency. This eventuality was brought to the attention of President Quezon by Osmena himself, who wrote the former to this effect. Aside from replying to this letter informing Vice-President Osmena that it would not be wise and prudent to effect any such change under the circumstances, President Quezon issued a press release along the same line. Osmena then requested the opinion of U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, who upheld Osmena's view as more in keeping the law. Quezon, however, remained adamant. He accordingly sought President Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision. The latter choose to remain aloof from the controversy, suggesting instead that the Philippine officials themselves solve the impasse. A cabinet meeting was then convened by President Quezon. Aside from Quezon and Osmena, others present in this momentous meeting were Resident Commissioner Joaquin Elizalde, Brig. Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, and Cabinet Secretaries Andres Soriano and Jaime Hernandez. Following a spirited discussion, the Cabinet adopted Elizalde's opinion favoring the decision and announced his plan to retire in California.\n\nAfter the meeting, however, Vice-President Osmena approached the President and broached his plan to ask the American Congress to suspend the constitutional provisions for presidential succession until after the Philippines should have been liberated. This legal way out was agreeable to President Quezon and the members of his Cabinet. Proper steps were taken to carry out the proposal. Sponsored by Senator Tydings and Congressman Bell, the pertinent Resolution was unanimously approved by the Senate on a voice vote and passed the House of Representatives by the a vote of 181 to 107, on 10 November 1943.\n\nPresidency\n\nOsmena became president of the Commonwealth on Quezon's death in 1944. He returned to the Philippines the same year with General Douglas MacArthur and the liberation forces. After the war, Osmena restored the Commonwealth government and the various executive departments. He continued the fight for Philippine independence. For the presidential election of 1946, Osmena refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew of his record of 40 years of honest and faithful service. He lost to Manuel Roxas, who won 54 percent of the vote and became president of the independent Republic of the Philippines.\n\nWar Cabinet 1944–45\n\nOn 8 August 1944, President Osmena issued Executive Order 15-W reorganizing and consolidating the Executive Departments of the Commonwealth government. The reorganization of the government after it was reestablished on Philippine soil was undertaken with Executive Order No. 27; 27 February 1945.\n\nCabinet and judicial appointments 1945–46\n\nExecutive Order No. 27; 27 February 1945 was issued upon the restoration of civilian authority to the government of the Commonwealth, and members of the new cabinet appointed on 8 March 1945. Subsequent renaming and mergers of departments have separate listings.\n\nLiberation\n\nOsmena accompanied U.S. General Douglas MacArthur during the landing of U.S. forces in Leyte on 20 October 1944, starting the liberation of the Philippines during the Second World War was both the combined Filipino and American soldiers including the recognized guerrilla units was fought to the Japanese Imperial forces. Upon establishing the beachhead, MacArthur immediately transferred authority to Osmena, the successor of Manuel Quezon, as Philippine Commonwealth president.\n\nRestoration of the Commonwealth\n\nWith Manila liberated, General of the Army, Douglas MacArthur, on behalf of the United States, turned over the reins of government of the Philippines to Commonwealth President, Sergio Osmena, on 27 February 1945, amidst brief, but impressive, ceremonies held at the Malacanan Palace. President Osmena, after thanking the United States through General MacArthur, announced the restoration of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and work out the salvation of the Philippines from the ravages of war.\n\nGovernment reorganization\n\nPresident Osmena proceeded with the immediate reorganization of the government and its diverse dependencies. On 8 April 1945, he formed his Cabinet, administering the oath of office to its component members. Later, President Osmena received the Council of State to help him solve the major problems confronting the nation. Government offices and bureaus were gradually reestablished. A number of new ones were created to meet needs then current. Also restored were the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the inferior courts. The Court of Appeals was abolished and its appellate jurisdiction was transferred to the Supreme Court, the members of which were increased to eleven – one Chief Justice and ten Associate Justice – in order to attend to the new responsibilities. Slowly but steadily, as the liberating forces freed the other portions of the country, provincial and municipal governments were established by the Commonwealth to take over from the military authorities.\n\nRehabilitation of the Philippine National Bank\n\nFollowing the restoration of the Commonwealth Government, the Congress was reorganized. Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino were elected Senate President and Senate President pro tempore respectively. At the House of Representatives, Jose Zulueta of Iloilo was elected Speaker and Prospero Sanidad as Speaker pro tempore. The opening session of the Congress was personally addressed by President Osmena, who reported on the Commonwealth Government in exile and proposed vital pieces of legislation.\n\nThe First Commonwealth Congress earnestly took up the various pending assignments to solve the pressing matters affecting the Philippines, especially in regard to relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. The first bill enacted was Commonwealth Act No. 672 – rehabilitating the Philippine National Bank.\n\nPeople's court\n\nYielding to American pressure, on 25 September 1945, the Congress enacted C.A. No. 682 creating the People's Court and the Office of Special Prosecutors to deal with the pending cases of \"collaboration\".\n\nUnited Nations Charter\n\nPresident Osmena sent the Philippine delegation, which was headed by Carlos P. Romulo, to the San Francisco gathering for the promulgation of the Charter of the United Nations on 26 June 1945. Other members of the delegation were Maximo Kalaw, Carlos P. Garcia, Pedro Lopez, Francisco Delegado, Urbano Zafra, Alejandro Melchor, and Vicente Sinco. The 28th signatory nation of the United Nations, the Philippines was one of the fifty-one nations that drafted the UN Charter. Once approved by Philippine delegation, the UN Charter was ratified by the Congress of the Philippines and deposited with the U.S State Department on 11 October 1945.\n\nForeign Relations Office\n\nTo prepare for the forthcoming independent status of the Philippine, President Osmena created the Office of Foreign Relations. Vicente Sinco was appointed as its first Commissioner, with cabinet rank. In this connection, President Osmena also entered into an agreement with the United States Government to send five Filipino trainees to the U.S. State Department to prepare themselves for diplomatic service. They were sent by U.S. State Department to the United States embassies in Moscow and Mexico City and consulates in Saigon and Singapore.\n\nInternational banking\n\nOn 5 December 1945, President Osmena appointed Resident Commissioner Carlos P. Romulo as his representative to accept Philippine membership in the International Monetary Fund and in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which bodies had been conceived in the Bretton Woods Agreement, in which the Philippine had also taken part. Romulo signed said membership on 27 December 1945 on behalf of the Philippines.\n\nBell Trade Act\n\nOn 30 April 1946, the United States Congress, at last approved the Bell Act, which as early as 20 January had been reported to the Ways and Means Committee of the lower house, having been already passed by the Senate. President Osmena and Resident Commissioner Ramulo had urged the passage of this bill, with United States High Commissioner, Paul V. McNutt, exerting similar pressure.\n\nThe Act gave the Philippines eight years of free trade with the United States, then twenty years during which tariffs would be upped gradually until they were in line with the rest of the American tariff policy. The law also fixed some quotas for certain products: sugar – 850,000 long tons; cordage – 6,000,000 pounds; coconut oil – 200,000 long tons; cigars – 200,000,000 pounds. This aid was coupled with that to be obtained from the recently passed Tydings Damage bill, which provided some nine hundred million dollars for payment of war damages, of which one million was earmarked to compensate for church losses. The sum of two hundred and forty million dollars was to be periodically allocated by the United States President as good will. Also, sixty million pieces of surplus property were transferred to the Philippines government.\n\n1946 presidential election\n\nSoon after the reconstitution of the Commonwealth Government in 1945 Senators Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino and their allies called for the holding on an early national election to choose the president and vice president of the Philippines and members of the Congress. In December, 1945 the House Insular Affairs of the United States Congress approved the joint resolution setting the election date no later than 30 April 1946. Prompted by this congressional action, President Sergio Osmena called the Philippine Congress to a three-day special session. Congress enacted Commonwealth Act No. 725, setting the election on 23 April 1946, and this was approved by President Osmena on 5 January 1946.\n\nThree parties presented their respective candidates for the different national elective positions. These were the Nacionalista Party – Conservative (Osmena) Wing, the Liberal Wing of the Nacionalista Party, and the Partido Modernista. The Nacionalistas had Osmena and Senator Eulogio Rodriguez as their candidates for president and vice president respectively. The Modernistas chose Hilario Camino Moncado and Luis Salvador for the same positions. The standard bearers of the Liberals were Senators Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino. On 3 January 1946, President Osmena announced his re-election bid. On 22 January 1946 Eulogio Rodriguez was nominated as Osmena's running mate for Vice President, in a convention held at Ciro's Club in Manila. According to the Manila Chronicle:\n\nThe convention opened at 10:15 in the morning when the acting secretary of the party, Vicente Farmoso, called the confab to order. Congressman Jose C. Romero, who delivered the keynote speech accused Senate President Manuel Roxas and his followers \"of fanning the flames of discontent among the people, of capitalizing on the people's hardship, and of minimizing the accomplishment of the [Osmena] Administration. These men with the Messiah complex have been the bane of the country and of the world. This is the mentality that produces Hitlers and the Mussolinis, and their desire to climb to power. they even want to destroy the party which placed them where they are today.\"\n\nSenator Carlos P. Garcia, who delivered the nomination speech for President Sergio Osmena, made a long recital of Osmena's achievements, his virtues as public official and as private citizen.\n\nEntering the convention hall at about 7:30 p.m, President Osmena, accompanied by the committee on notification, was greeted with rounds of cheer and applause as he ascended the platform. President Osmena delivered his speech which was a general outline of his future plans once elected. He emphasized that as far as his party is concerned, independence is a close issue. It is definitely coming on 4 July 1946\n\nOn 19 January 1946, Senator Roxas announced his candidacy for President in a convention held in Santa Ana Cabaret in Manila. According to the Manila Chronicle:\n\n...more than three thousand (by conservative estimate there were only 1,000 plus) delegates, party members and hero worshipers jammed into suburban, well known Santa Ana Cabaret (biggest in the world) to acclaim ex-katipunero and Bagong Katipunan organizer Manuel Acuna Roxas as the guidon bearer of the Nacionalista Party's Liberal Wing. The delegates, who came from all over the Islands, met in formal convention from 10:50 am and did not break up till about 5:30 pm.\n\nThey elected 1. Mariano J. Cuenco, professional Osmenaphobe, as temporary chairman; 2. Jose Avelino and ex-pharmacist Antonio Zacarias permanent chairman and secretary, respectively; 3. nominated forty-four candidates for senators; 4. heard the generalissimo himself deliver an oratorical masterpiece consisting of 50 per cent attacks against the (Osmena) Administration, 50 per cent promises, pledges. Rabid Roxasites greeted the Roxas acceptance speech with hysterical applause.\n\nA split developed among the members of the Nacionalista Party over issues. President Osmena tried to prevent the split in the Nacionalista Party by offering Senator Roxas the position of Philippine Regent Commissioner to the United States but Roxas turned down the offer. A new political organization was born, the Liberal Wing of the Nacionalista Party, which would later become the Liberal Party of the Philippines.\n\nThe election was generally peaceful except in some places, especially in the province of Pampanga. According to a \"controversial\" decision of the Electoral Tribunal of the House of Representatives in Meliton Soliman vs. Luis Taruc, \"Pampanga was under the terroristic clutches and control of the Hukbalahaps. So terrorized were the people of Arayat, at one time, 200 persons abandoned their homes, their work, and their food, all their belongings in a mass evacuation to the poblacion due to fear and terror.\"\n\nA total of 2,218,847 voters went to the polls to elect a President and Vice President. who were to be the Commonwealth's last and the Republic's first. Four days after election day, the Liberal party candidates were proclaimed victors.
