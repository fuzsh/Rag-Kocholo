        "text": "Sergio Osmeña (September 9, 1878 – October 19, 1961) was the fourth President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. He was Vice President under Manuel L. Quezon, and rose to the presidency upon Quezon's death in 1944. He was a founder of Nacionalista Party.\n\nOsmeña is the patriarch of the prominent Osmeña family, which includes his son (former Senator Sergio Osmeña Jr.) and his grandsons (Senators Sergio Osmeña III and John Henry Osmeña), ex-Governor (Lito Osmeña and Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña).\n\nEarly life and career\n\nA Chinese-mestizo with some Spanish blood, Osmeña was born in Cebu to Juana Osmeña y Suico. He took his elementary education in the University of San Carlos and graduated in 1892. Osmeña continued his education in Manila, studying in San Juan de Letran College where he first met Manuel L. Quezon, a classmate of his. He took up law at the University of Santo Tomas and was second place in the bar examination in 1903.\n\nOsmeña served on the war staff of General Emilio Aguinaldo as a courier and journalist. In 1900, he founded the Cebu newspaper, El Nuevo Día which lasted for three years.\n\nPolitical career\n\nIn 1904, the American colonial administration appointed him governor of Cebu. Two years later he was elected governor of Cebu. While governor, he ran for election to the first Philippine Assembly of 1907 and was elected Speaker of that body. Osmeña was only 29 and already the highest-ranking Filipino official.\n\nHe and another provincial politician, Manuel L. Quezon of Tayabas, set up the Nacionalista Party as a foil to the Partido Federalista of Manila-based politicians. The two would engage in a rivalry for political dominance ever since.\n\nOsmeña was elected an assemblyman, in 1907, and remained a member of the lower house until 1922. He was the country's vice president for two consecutive terms under the Philippine Commonwealth.\n\nHe went to the US, in 1933, to secure passage of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Independence Bill which was superseded by the Tydings-McDuffie Act in March 1934.\n\nOsmeña was elected as vice-president of the Commonwealth in 1935, with Quezon as president. He was re-elected in 1941. When the Commonwealth government relocated in the US in exile, Osmeña went with Quezon.\n\nPresidency\n\nOsmeña became president of the Commonwealth on Quezon's death in 1944. He returned to the Philippines the same year with General Douglas MacArthur and the liberation forces. After the war, Osmeña restored the Commonwealth government and the various executive departments. He continued the fight for Philippine independence.\n\nFor the presidential election of 1946, Osmeña refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew of his record of 40 years of honest and faithful service. Nevertheless, he was defeated by Manuel Roxas, who won 54 percent of the vote and became the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines.\n\nWar Cabinet 1944-45\n\nOn August 8, 1944, President Osmeña issued Executive Order 15-W reorganizing and consolidating the Executive Departments of the Commonwealth government. The reorganization of the government after it was reestablished on Philippine soil was undertaken with Executive Order No. 27, February 27, 1945.\n\nOFFICE NAME TERM President Sergio Osmeña 1944–1946 Secretary of Finance Jaime Hernandez 1944–1945 Secretary of National Defense and Communications Basilio Valdes 1944–1945 Secretary of Information and Public Relations Carlos P. Romulo (concurrent capacity) 1944–1945 Secretary of Justice, Labor and Welfare Mariano A.

Romulo 1944–1945 Budget and Finance Commissioner Ismael Mathay 1944–1945 Judge Advocate General of the Army Mariano Eraña 1944–1945 Economic Adviser Urbano Zafra 1944–1945 Military Adviser Alejandro Melchor 1944–1945\n\nCabinet and Judicial Appointments 1945-46\n\nExecutive Order No. 27, February 27, 1945 was issued upon the restoration of civilian authority to the government of the Commonwealth, and members of the new cabinet appointed on March 8, 1945. Subsequent renaming and mergers of departments have separate listings.\n\nOFFICE NAME TERM President Sergio Osmeña 1944–1946 Secretary of the Interior Tomas Confesor 1945 Secretary of Finance and Reconstruction Jaime Hernandez 1945–1946 Secretary of Justice, Agriculture and Commerce Delfin Jaranilla 1945 Secretary of Justice Ramon Quisumbing 1945–1946 Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce Vicente Singson Encarnacion 1945–1946 Secretary of National Defense Tomas Cabili 1945 Secretary of National Defense and Interior Alfredo Montelibano 1945–1946 Secretary of Health and Public Welfare Basilio Valdes 1945 Jose Locsin 1945–1946 Secretary of Public Instruction and Information Francisco Benitez 1945 Secretary of Education Francisco Benitez 1945–1946 Secretary of Public Works and Communications Sotero Cabahug 1945–1946 Secretary of the Budget Ismael Mathay 1944–1945 Secretary to the President Jose S.

He died at the age of 83 on October 19, 1961, at the Veteran's Memorial Hospital in Quezon City. He is buried in the Manila North Cemetery in Manila."
