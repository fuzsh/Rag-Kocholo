        "text": "When fiery, chain-smoking Manuel Acuna Roxas announced last year that he would run for the Presidency of the Philippines, many an island politico winked significantly over his cigar. There is but one Philippine party, the Nacionalistas. According to all the rules of island politics, Roxas would soon make a deal with aging President Sergio Osmeña, withdraw in the old man’s favor.\n\nBut last week 2,000 insurgent Roxas followers crowded into Manila’s Santa Ana Cabaret* drink beer, spout oratory in Tagalog, English and Spanish, and nominate him for the island’s highest office. A few days later old line Nacionalistas held a nominating convention in Giro’s, another nightclub, and put Osmeña’s name on the ballot. The Philippines were devastated and flat broke. They would stay that way until the dilatory U.S. Congress passed legislation granting $450,000,000 for postwar rehabilitation. But now the future at least promised excitement. The hottest political campaign in island history—and the one which would provide the first President of the new Philippines Republic—was under way.\n\nMany a voter guessed there might be gunfire as well as oratory before it was over, since thousands of ex-guerrillas still keep their arms in the hills of Luzon. But it was too early to guess at the outcome. Smart, flashy Manuel Roxas would have the edge in political sex appeal, and Philippine voters traditionally disregard platforms and causes to vote for personal reasons. He has always been popular with Juan de la Cruz, the Filipino man-in-the-street. Rumor had it that several rich island families would back him in buying up blocs of votes from local political leaders—a custom which every candidate must duly observe. But he also had a cross to bear—he had held political office during the Japanese occupation.\n\nThough most U.S. authorities were convinced that Roxas had accepted the position to aid his countrymen, the Osmeña faction promptly painted him in different colors. Cried Osmeña’s political ally, Tomás Confesor:\n\n“He says he voluntarily remained behind to fight with his people. The truth is that he cried like a baby when he found out that he was not on MacArthur’s list of men to be evacuated to Australia. Roxas’ claims that he supplied the guerrillas with information are baloney. There is much evidence that he was a collaborator. He should be disqualified. . . .”\n\nThe communists, home-grown and foreign, are bitterly anti-Roxas. But Roxas, strongly pro-American and by far the most talented public man in the Philippines, could be counted on to take care of himself in a hot argument. -In bombed-out Manila no big public halls or buildings remain standing.\n\n*In bombed-out Manila no big public halls or buildings remain standing"
