        "text": "What countries were allied with America in World War 2?\n\nCountries involved in WWIIBy the end of World War 2 there were few sovereign nations who were not involved in the war in some way.Most everyone played a role in the war that could be construed as having some kind of major effect (even an officially neutral nation like Sweden, whose government allowed the passage of German troops through its territories, for example), which is why it was a truly global conflict. But the list of major players who were involved in major fighting goes something like this:Axis CountriesGermanyItalyJapannew lumpa landHungaryRomaniaBulgariaCroatiaSlovakiaThe following are sometimes also included: Iraq (Gailani government), Burma, Thailand, The Philippines (Laurel government), Republic of China at Nanking and Manchukuo.Allied CountriesUnited States (America, USA)CanadaAustraliaSome would count exactly 51 Allied countries, since each became a charter member of the United Nations and in order to qualify for charter membership in the UN, a nation had to have been at war with one or more of the Axis nations. These 51 were: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Byelorussia SSR, Canada, Chile, China (Republic of..), Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Guatamala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iran, Iraq (post-Gailini government), Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, The Philippines (Osmena government), Poland, Russia USSR, Saudia Arabia, South Africa, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine SSR, USA, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.France was actually on the side of both, Allies and Axis. The southern part was known as the \"Vichy French\" that were loyal to Axis powers.And at first, USSR was a neutral nation with the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. But then USSR became a 'untrusted' ally of Britain the United States when Hitler invaded the them.Some argue Argentina was an Axis power in World War 2. They were at war with Brazil with German support and supplies. It was called the Planaterian War. What's more, Argentina only entered the war on 29 March 1945 as a last minute gesture and welcomed SS men wanted for war crimes.Here is more input:A better question might be 'which countries were not involved in WWII?\" Just about every nation on earth was \"involved\" in World War II in one way or another. By that I mean colonies, protectorates, commonwealths, or satellite nations of the belligerents following the wishes of their patron countries. And other countries and even neutral nations were supplying belligerents with material or resources, harboring or interning civilians, military personnel, refugees, spies etc. to stay or cross their particular country.Maybe you mean which countries were neutral during World War II? Only eight nations - Argentina, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and Vatican City - remained neutral througout the war. A few countries were neutral at the start of the war but soon became subjugated or belligerents. Chile began the war as a neutral but was pressured into it by the Organization of American States. Dennmark and Norway were neutral but were soon invaded by Germany.AnswerMany nations were involved in WW2, here is a few countries that I know of: Germany, Japan Italy China Britain Soviet Union Thailand Philipines Poland Indonesia France Malaysia Belgium Netherlands Denmark Norway Morocco Finland Nigeria Czechoslovakia Egypt Hungary South Africa Bulgaria Romania Greece Australia Albania New Zealand YugoslaviaUnited States CanadaThere are lots of other countries involved, but they aren't as significant to the rest of the world.AnswerAllied Powers: Russia China Britain France United StatesAxis Powers: Japan Germany Italy"
