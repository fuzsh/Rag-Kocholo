        "text": "A frail little man, a Spanish mestizo with burning eyes and a sharp tongue, lay seriously ill in his suite at Washington’s Shoreham Hotel. Philippine President Manuel Quezon waited word of his future.\n\nDowntown in the refurbished red brick mansion which houses the Philippine Government in Exile, another man, a Chinese mestizo with inscrutable eyes and cautious tongue, also waited—Sergio Osmeña, Vice President of the Philippines, successor to Manuel Quezon under the Philippine Constitution.\n\nThen Congress and Franklin Roosevelt put the Philippine Constitution in suspended animation, decreed that Manuel Quezon should continue as Philippine President until the Jap is driven from the Islands. Sergio Osmeña will continue as Vice President.\n\nThus was written the next-to-last chapter in the 36-year-long duel for power between Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmeña, who have fought together for Philippine independence and against each other for prestige at home.\n\nAndante. Manuel Quezon is only 21 days older than Sergio Osmeña. They met on the campus of Manila’s Santo Tomas University, roomed together in law school. Both rose to provincial governorships, both were elected to the National Assembly. Osmeña, boss of the Nationalist Party, became Speaker, chose his friend Quezon for floor leader.\n\nCrescendo. Manuel Quezon knew that any help for the Philippines must come from the U.S. In 1909 he wangled his way to Washington as Philippine Resident Commissioner. Osmeña opposed the move; Quezon went anyway. Seven years later he returned to Manila with the Jones Act in his pocket, giving the Philippines a two-house elective legislature and more independence than ever before. Quezon, national hero, became president of the Senate; Osmeña remained as Speaker of the House.\n\nIn 1930 Osmeña’s chance came at Washington. He wangled more than the Jones Act—a bill for complete independence. Swiftly Quezon marshaled his forces among the Islands’ politicos, defeated the bill in the Philippine Legislature. Then, in 1934, Manuel Quezon, aided by powerful U.S. sugar and hemp lobbies, got his own independence bill. He became the obvious choice for first Philippine President. Manuel Quezon loudly proclaimed that he would not run unless Sergio Osmeña ran with him for Vice President. Osmeña went along.\n\nDiminuendo. The throttlebottomry of the Philippine Vice Presidency did not diminish Sergio Osmeña’s popularity. He lived his quiet life, while dapper Manuel Quezon, quixotic spendthrift, lover of luxury, danced and entertained at Malacañan Palace and junketed about the world. At press receptions, Osmeña served wine, Quezon hard liquor. Osmeña, born with the Chinese hate for the Jap, held his tongue while Quezon was royally received in Japan. When they ran for re-election in 1941, Osmeña polled a higher vote than Quezon.\n\nOsmeña remained above the battle in Washington. The question was in U.S. hands, and the Administration clearly wanted ailing Manuel Quezon to stay. But the same Resolution which continues Manuel Quezon in office will automatically make Sergio Osmeña President of the Philippines the moment the Islands have been reclaimed from the Jap."
