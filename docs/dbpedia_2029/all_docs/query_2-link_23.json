        "text": "Delicadeza, honor, decency and uncompromising honesty in public service, hard work, perseverance, respect for others and the abiding humility and self-restraint -- these are the enduring qualities of the greatest Cebuano who ever lived. Brilliant and erudite in law, bar topnotcher, but his intellectual gifts never caused him to become arrogant and haughty, nor proud. Loyal to his party, faithful to Cebu and trustworthy to his friend Manuel Quezon, he never lied just to win favors or gain mileage. Don Sergio was a man of integrity. Today is his 143rd birth anniversary. Let us honor his memory.\n\nHe was always self-effacing. He knew how to wait for his turn. He had always been a Nacionalista until he died. He never left the party that he founded. He worked hard to reach the apex of his political career. He never cheated in elections, never betrayed his allies, nor claimed credit for things done by others. Don Sergio founded the Nacionalista Party. He dedicated his time, efforts and resources to build the party. He was betrayed by Manuel Roxas who lost in a clean party convention and bolted the party, and founded the Liberal Party. Don Sergio stood firm and loyal to the ideals of the Nacionalistas.\n\nHe was more intellectually gifted than his classmate, Quezon, but Don Sergio always gave way to the fiery orator from Baler, if only to preserve the unity of the party and national leadership. Born on September 9, 1878 to a 14-year-old mother, Juana Osmena y Suico, with no known father (that's why he had no middle name), he studied in the old Colegio de San Carlos, then transferred to Juan de Letran in Manila. He took up law in UST, where he met Quezon. He topped his law class, and placed number 2 in the Bar. Quezon placed number 4. But Quezon was always more aggressive, assertive and forceful. Don Sergio always gave way.\n\nDon Sergio was governor of Cebu from 1904 to 1907, at the age of 26. He was a congressman and Speaker of the House from 1907 to 1922, at age of 29. He was senator from 1922 to 1935. He was vice president from 1935 to 1944. He became president on August 1, 1944, when Quezon died in New York. He could have assumed the presidency much earlier, when Quezon’s term limited but Don Sergio was the one who asked the US Congress to pass a law extending the term of Quezon. It was for the sake of unity considering that the Philippines was embroiled in the war between the USA and Japan.\n\nIn 1946, Manuel Roxas and Don Sergio contested the official candidacy for president. Don Sergio won in a clean, honest and fair convention. Roxas lost fair and square, and, instead of honoring the results, he left NP and founded the Liberal Party. The two Visayans fought. Roxas campaigned vigorously. Don Sergio only delivered one speech because Roxas was his friend. Roxas won with a slim margin. Don Sergio graciously attended Roxas' oath-taking and turned over the presidency to his friend. He even praised Roxas and supported his leadership.\n\nThere is no political leader today who can do what the grand old man of Cebu did. Let us, therefore, honor his memory by extolling his virtues. They do not make politicians like him anymore. He was one of a kind. We, Cebuanos, should be proud of him. He is one of my three best presidents."
