        "text": "Synopsis\n\nPrivate equity firms Cinven and Warburg Pincus have agreed to buy Dutch cable operator Casema for $2.6bn, one of the Casema owners.\n\nAMSTERDAM: Private equity firms Cinven and Warburg Pincus have agreed to buy Dutch cable operator Casema for e2.1bn ($2.6bn), one of the Casema owners, the Carlyle Group, said on Tuesday.\n\nCasema, which is jointly owned by private equity firms Providence Equity Partners, Carlyle Group and GMT Communications Partners, is the Netherlands’ third-largest cable operator.\n\nThe transaction, which is expected to close in the second half of ‘06, is subject to regulatory approvals. Casema serves about 1.3m subscribers in the central and south-western regions of the Netherlands.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been acquiring European cable firms over the past few years as consumers across the continent increasingly embrace multi-channel digital TV, high-speed broadband and internet-based telephone services.\n\nOther bidders for Casema included BC Partners, Macquarie Bank and Liberty Global’s UPC Netherlands, according to media reports. Providence Equity Partners, Carlyle Group and GMT Communications Partners, together acquired Casema for e665m in ‘03 from France Telecom. They have invested about e250m since then in upgrading the network.\n\nProvidence and Carlyle each own 46% of Casema and GMT owns 8 %. Goldman Sachs International was the sole financial advisor. Among other recent deals, Warburg Pincus acquired rival Dutch operator Multikabel last year for 515m euros.\n\nCinven recently agreed to buy UPC France for 1.25m euros to gain control of nearly all of the country’s cable networks. Essent, the Netherlands’ second-largest cable operator, is also up for sale.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nTata Consumer Products needs a Starbucks ‘shot’ to increase its market value exponentially\n\nPorts to power, what companies facing insolvency mean for Adani Group\n\nA list of 20 large-cap stocks where you have lost money big time.\n\nThe challenges dotting India’s push for 6G leadership\n\nAre Yamaha dealer IPO investors and Sir Isaac Newton on the same page?\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
