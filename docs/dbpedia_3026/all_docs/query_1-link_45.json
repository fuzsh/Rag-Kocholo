        "text": "Dear Jim,\n\nFor the Mac version, BEAGLE only runs in 32bit mode so you must have -d32 on the java command line. The other issue, I think, is because you have installed the latest version of BEAGLE which has advanced a bit since BEAST v1.5.4 was released. The latest version of BEAGLE only works with the latest _in development_ version of BEAST which is probably not stable enough for general use.\n\nThe solution is to obtain an older version of BEAGLE that works with BEAST v1.5.4. To obtain this use the following command to check out the code:\n\nsvn checkout http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/svn/tags/BEAST_V1_5_4 beagle-lib\n\nThen follow the instructions to build this version.\n\nI have updated the instructions on the wiki to use this version:\n\nhttp://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/BEAGLE_on_Mac_OS_X\n\nBest,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n\n> --\n\n> You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"beast-users\" group.\n\n> To post to this group, send email to beast...@googlegroups.com.\n\n> To unsubscribe from this group, send email to beast-users...@googlegroups.com.\n\n> For more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/beast-users?hl=en.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nAndrew Rambaut\n\nInstitute of Evolutionary Biology University of Edinburgh\n\nAshworth Laboratories Edinburgh EH9 3JT\n\nEMAIL - a.ra...@ed.ac.uk TEL - +44 131 6508624\n\n--\n\nThe University of Edinburgh is a charitable body, registered in\n\nScotland, with registration number SC005336.\n\nDear Andrew,\n\nI followed your instructions on the wiki, but ran into a problem.\n\nAfter downloading the CUDA Developer Drivers for MacOS and the CUDA Toolkit\n\nand installing them (default options used everywhere), I downloaded BEAGLE,\n\nand tried the next commands, but I get an error message:\n\nhubert-turners-macbook:beagle-lib hubertturner$ cd beagle-lib\n\nhubert-turners-macbook:beagle-lib hubertturner$ ./autogen.sh\n\n./autogen.sh: line 3: autoreconf: command not found\n\nWhat did I do wrong, and how can I correct my error?\n\nThe MacOS is 10.6.3.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nHubert Turner\n\nhon. staff biogeography\n\nt +31 71 527 35 75\n\ne turner[at]nhn[dot]leidenuniv[dot]nl\n\nNetherlands Centre for Biodiversity Naturalis (section NHN), Leiden\n\nUniversity\n\np.o. box 9514, 2300 ra leiden, the netherlands\n\nmembers.casema.nl/arp/ <http://members.casema.nl/arp/>\n\nwww.ncbnaturalis.nl <http://www.ncbnaturalis.nl/>\n\n"
