This free domain lookup tool will perform quick domain analysis to determine if any fraud, abuse, malware, phishing, and other types of unwanted actions have originated from this domain. IPQS analyzes domain threat data from across our network, based on scoring hundreds of millions of transactions per day and extensive live reporting feedback from our clients. You can also check the domain's IP reputation health, which could also explain email domain reputation issues.\n\nWhat Are Benefits of Domain Reputation Analysis?\n\nMail domains provide a good initial overview of the email address reputation. Disposable and high risk email service providers are likely to result in fake or duplicate accounts. User registrations from domains in this category should be treated as completely fraudulent and a robust API makes it possible to filter account sign ups in real-time. IPQS has a full suite of tools available to detect bot traffic and fraudulent sign ups with advanced screening for email reputation.\n\nHow Can I Verify an Individual Email Address?\n\nQuickly determine if an email address is valid and obtain details about the inbox an deliverability using IPQS free email verifier. This check determines the health of an email address such as when the domain was first registered and when the email address was first seen across the IPQS threat network. Additional risk analysis data points make it easy to judge the quality of an email address and the corresponding mail domain reputation.\n\nDoes Domain Reputation Affect Email Deliverability?\n\nAbsolutely. Domain reputation is used by all major mail service providers like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, Hotmail, AOL, and many more to identify SPAM and abusive senders. If you are unsure if your email domain reputation is contributing to poor email deliverability, please use our free email SPAM check to identify possible issues. We also recommend checking your domain health with the lookup tool above. Cleaning email lists every 6-12 months, especially for older subscribers can greatly improve domain reputation.\n\nHow To Improve Email Domain Reputation?\n\nEmail domain reputation can be improved by ensuring best practices for email deliverability, including setting valid DNS records like SPF, rDNS, PTR, DMARC, and DKIM policies. Maintaining clean reputation for sending IP and domains is critical for email service providers (ESPs) to allow messages into the inbox, instead of quarantining the message into the SPAM folder. Periodically checking to see if your domain or IP is blacklisted can help prevent email deliverability issues."
