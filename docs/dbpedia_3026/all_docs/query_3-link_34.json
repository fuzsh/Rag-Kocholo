        "text": "Article 11(1)\n\n[173] Jurisdiction ratione temporis\n\n1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute.\n\nThe Court has the power to exercise jurisdiction following the 1 July 2002, when the Rome Statute was ratified by 60 States and thus entered into force (Article 126). Thus, the Rome Statute is based on the non-retroactivity principle and the temporal jurisdiction of the Court is prospective (Article 24(1)).\n\nThe Rome Statute is silent in regard to violations which are committed prior to the entry into force of the Statute and continued afterwards. It is submitted that references in future cases to acts pre-dating the entry into force of the Statute may be useful in establishing the historical context but they may not be form the basis of a charge.\n\nThe jurisdiction ratione temporis may be limited in two ways. The Security Council may according to Article 16 prevent the Court from exercising jurisdiction for a fixed period of time. A State may also upon ratification of the Rome Statute make a declaration in accordance with Article 124 and opt out for a period of seven years from the jurisdiction of the Court in relation to war crimes.\n\nCross-references:\n\nArticles 16, 24(1), 124 and 126.\n\nAuthor: Mark Klamberg\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 11(2)\n\n[174] 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State has made a declaration under Article 12, paragraph 3.\n\nA precondition to the Court's exercise of jurisdiction is that the State has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court (Article 12). In addition the Security Council may refer a situation to the Court (Article 13). The requirement on consent on behalf of the State has implications for the temporal jurisdiction of the Court. In regard to States that accepts the jurisdiction of the Court two exceptions may be noted in relation to the jurisdiction ratione temporis set by the entry into force of the Rome Statute.\n\nThe first exception concerns States Parties. When a State becomes a party, the Court's temporal jurisdiction is limited to the crimes committed after the entry into force of the Rome Statute for that State, unless that State in accordance with Article 12(3) accepts jurisdiction for acts committed prior to ratification but after the entry into force of the Statute. It is submitted that the declaration must be explicit, which was the case in the situation in Uganda and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, see letter of the Prosecutor of 17 June 2004 attached to the Decision Assigning the Situation in Uganda to Pre-Trial Chamber II, 5 July 2004 (page 4) and Decision Assigning the Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo to Pre-Trial Chamber I, 5 July 2004 (page 4).\n\nThe second exception, concerning States Not Parties to the Rome Statute, is examined in the comment to Article 12.\n\nCross-references:\n\nArticles 12 and 13\n\nDoctrine:\n\nSharon A. Williams, in Otto Triffterer (Ed.), Commentary on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court - Observers' Notes, Article by Article, Second Edition, C.H. Beck/Hart/Nomos, München/Oxford/Baden-Baden, 2008, pp. 539-545.\n\nStéphane Bourgon, in Antonio Cassese et al. (Eds.), The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A Commentary, Oxford Univerity Press, Oxford, 2002, pp. 543-552.\n\nAuthor: Mark Klamberg\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 12\n\n[175] Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction\n\nGeneral Remarks\n\nArticle 12 sets the preconditions for the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court. As such, the provision has been called ‘one of the cornerstone provisions of the Statute’ (Bergsmo, p. 30). In addition to specifying the general preconditions for the exercise of jurisdiction, Articles12 must furthermore be seen as the main provision governing the territorial jurisdiction (ratione loci jurisdiction) of the ICC. Given that the Rome Statute does not provide for a separate and exclusive provision dealing in toto with the ratione loci jurisdiction of the Court (Stéphane Bourgon, p. 560)—such as Article 11 on the temporal jurisdiction (ratione temporis jurisdiction)— Article 12 is the central legal source when it comes to determining the territorial jurisdiction of the ICC.\n\nOn the basis of this dogmatic structure Article 12 may be divided into two separate yet intertwined stipulations: First, Article 12(1) determines how a State may accept the jurisdiction of the ICC concerning the core crimes, namely by becoming a party to the Rome Statute. Second, in order for the ICC to be able to exercise this jurisdiction, Article 12(2) requires either the territorial State or the nationality State to be among the State Parties. To further extend the possibility of the ICC to exercise jurisdiction Article 12(3) Rome Statute provides for territorial and nationality non-State Parties to ad hoc accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the ICC.\n\nWith this understanding, Article 12 demonstrates an apparent respect for the sovereignty of States (Malanczuk, p. 17) and confirms the role of the principle of State sovereignty as a limiting factor for the jurisdiction of the ICC. Thus, Article 12 to be the result of a ‘compromise between State sovereignty and the needs of international justice’ (Stéphane Bourgon, p. 560). In the Rome Statute’s current structure State sovereignty, as underlined in particular in Article 12(2)-(3), may be pierced only by the referral of a situation to the prosecutor by the United Nations Security Council (‘UNSC’), pursuant to Article 13(b).\n\nA temporary opt out from the automatic jurisdiction under Article 12(1) is possible for war crimes pursuant to Article 124 if a declaration to this effect is made by a State upon becoming a Party to the Rome Statute. Such an opt out can be made for a maximum seven years and may be withdrawn at any time. For example, France has declared that “[p]ursuant to Article 124 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the French Republic declares that it does not accept the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the category of crimes referred to in Article 8 when a crime is alleged to have been committed by its nationals or on its territory”. (Reservation of 9 June 2000).\n\nPreparatory Works\n\nThe drafting history of Article 12 was not straightforward. There were several alternatives.\n\nGermany represented one extreme in the alternative that may be described as \"universal jurisdiction\". Germany held the view that States could delegate their jurisdiction they are entitled under customary international law to the Court. Since several States exercise universal jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes this jurisdiction could be delegated to the Court. They were supported by States such as Sweden, Czech Republic, Latvia, Costa Rica, Albania, Ghana, Namibia, Italy, Hungary, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ecuador.\n\nAt the other extreme was the United States that held that the State of nationality had to give its consent in all cases, except for Security Council referrals. India, Indonesia, Gabon, Russia, Jamaica, Nigeria, Vietnam, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and China advanced similar positions in preference of a narrower jurisdiction.\n\nOther States, such as the United Kingdom and Korea, tried to find a compromise. As indicated above, the result as manifested in Article 12 demonstrates respect for the sovereignty of States, a narrower jurisdiction for the Court.\n\nAuthor: Dominik Zimmerman, revised by Mark Klamberg\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 12(1)\n\n[176] 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the crimes referred to in Article 5.\n\nThe main content of Article 12 is the codification of the principle of automatic jurisdiction of the ICC vis-à-vis State Parties with respect to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community (the jurisdictional mechanism of ‘automatic jurisdiction’ is sometimes referred to as ‘inherent’ jurisdiction, see e.g. Wagner, p. 477). As such Article 12(1) merely refers to Article 5 which in turn contains the offences triggering the ratione materiae jurisdiction of the ICC. Article 12(1) thus does not itself codify the ratione materiae jurisdiction of the Court but instead expresses the central implication for States of becoming a Party to the Rome Statute, namely the fulfillment of the preconditions for the exercise of jurisdiction of the ICC in relation to every new State party. Through the codification of automatic jurisdiction, Article 12(1) furthermore puts emphasis on the understanding of the ICC as being ‘an independent permanent International Criminal Court’ (see Preamble of the Rome Statute; emphasis added by the author). Pursuant to Article 120 no reservation is permitted with the exception of the \"opt-out\" possibility for war crimes provided for in Article 124.\n\nDue to the reference of Article 12(1) to Article 5, the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court may be limited as far as the crime of aggression is concerned if and when, pursuant to Article 121(5), the Rome Statute has been amended by a definition of this crime (cf Articles 5(2), 121(5) and 123).\n\nAuthor: Dominik Zimmerman, revised by Mark Klamberg\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 12(2)\n\n[177] 2. In the case of Article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with paragraph 3:\n\nArticle 12(2) applies to the circumstances in Article 13(a) or (c) but not to Article 13(b). By omitting Article 13(b) the Court can, when authorized by the Security Council, exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of non-Party States.\n\nThe second subsection of Article 12 provides guidance as to which State(s) has (have) to accept the ICC’s jurisdiction in order for the Court to be able to exercise it in a particular situation. Article 12(2) contains two separate, but alternative, categories of State parties related to a conduct possibly constituting a crime under Article 5, that may constitute the necessary precondition for the ICC’s jurisdiction: (a) the State on whose territory the relevant conduct has occurred (so-called territorial State); and (b) the State of which the accused person(s) is (are) national(s) (so-called nationality State). By adhering to these categories, the Statute does not provide for the exercise of jurisdiction if only the State in whose custody a suspect is being held (so-called custodial State), or the State whose national was a victim of the relevant conduct (so-called victim’s State) is a State Party. In these cases, however, a referral of the relevant situation to the Prosecutor by the UNSC according to Article 13(b) may still trigger the exercise of jurisdiction. Although such situations are likely to be relatively rare, due also to the difficulty of finding political consensus within the UNSC, this possibility might prove to be valuable in the future in order to reach the ambitious goal of ending impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. Similarly, an ad hoc acceptance of an affected territorial or nationality non-State Party to the Rome Statute pursuant to Article 12(3) does have this same effect, i.e. enabling the ICC to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\nFollowing from the alternative wording ‘one or more’ contained in Article 12(2) the Court may come to exercise its jurisdiction in cases where States not being Parties to the Statute are involved and which do not, pursuant to Article 12(3), ad hoc accept the exercise of jurisdiction. This may for example be the case where a crime is committed in the territory of a State party by a national of a non-State Party, or where a national of a State Party commits a serious crime in the territory of a non-State Party. Notwithstanding the influence this might imply on a State not being a party to the Rome Statute, due to the anchorage of both the principle of territoriality and nationality in general international law, such exercise of jurisdiction cannot, however, be in violation of Article 34 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ([concluded 23 May 1969, entered into force 27 January 1980] 1155 UNTS 331).\n\nAuthor: Dominik Zimmerman, revised by Mark Klamberg\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 12(2)(a)\n\n[178] (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;\n\nThe first basis for the exercise of jurisdiction is the membership of the territorial State to the Rome Statute. This provision is mainly based on the assertion of territorial jurisdiction as one of the main implications of the principle of State sovereignty (Malcolm N Shaw, p.579; Vaughan Lowe, p.342–345). The consideration that ‘all individuals staying on the territory of a state are subjected to the law of that 'State' (Hans Kelsen, p.309) forms a necessary precondition in this regard. Under international law States may exercise this jurisdiction within their own municipal organizational structure or delegate this right in international agreements. Closely connected to the delegation of the sovereign ability to prosecute crimes committed on a State’s territory is the granting of full exercise of the ICC’s function and powers on the territory of the State Party pursuant to Article 4(2). According to the principle of territorial jurisdiction the territorial State may exercise jurisdiction regardless of the nationality of the person accused of the crime (there is no difference between citizens and aliens with respect to the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction of a State; see Hans Kelsen, p.310). With regard to the ICC this means that the Court may take jurisdiction over a conduct which occurred in the territory of a State Party, regardless of whether the person accused of the crime is a citizen of that same State or of a non-State Party. Furthermore, the exercise of jurisdiction is independent of the victim’s nationality and whether the alleged criminal remains in a custodial State which is a State Party or non-State party.\n\nWhether or not the nationality State or custodial State is a State Party to the Rome Statute is thus not of any relevance to the possibility of the ICC to exercise jurisdiction but instead has an influence on the obligation to co-operate with the ICC. Whereas State Parties, pursuant to Part 9 are obliged to fully co-operate with the Court in its investigation and prosecution of crimes, the same rules also apply to non-State Parties if they lodge an ad hoc declaration under Article 12(3), according to which the exercise of jurisdiction of the ICC is accepted in a particular case (see below).\n\nHowever, the United Nations Security Council may under the powers in Article 25 and Chapter VII of the UN Charter decide that all States, including non-State parties, shall co-operate fully with and provide any necessary assistance to the Court and the Prosecutor. The Security Council used this power when it referred the situation of Darfur to the Court in Resolution 1593 (2005).\n\nAs far as crimes that have been committed on board a vessel or aircraft are concerned the State of registration of the vessel or aircraft is equated with the territorial State. This is in line with Article 91(1) United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ([concluded 10 December 1982, entered into force 16 November 1994] 1833 UNTS 3) and Article 17 Convention on International Civil Aviation ([signed 7 December 1944, entered into force 4 April 1947] 15 UNTS 295) according to which ships have the nationality of the State whose flag they are entitled to fly and an aircraft has the nationality of the State in which it is registered.\n\nThere is no requirement that the territorial jurisdiction delegated to the Court is under the effective control of the State. Northern Cyprus is an example where this issue might arise (Schabas, p. 285).\n\nAuthor: Dominik Zimmerman, revised by Mark Klamberg\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 12(2)(b)\n\n[179] (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national.\n\nThe concept of nationality underlying Article 12(2)(b) is a confirmation of the legal link between a sovereign State and the individuals remaining on its territory (Malcolm N Shaw, p. 584; Vaughan Lowe, p. 345–47). This linkage does not only entitle a person to a series of rights, but moreover forms the basis for prosecution for crimes committed outside the territory of the State.\n\nThe nationality principle is widely used by civil law States as a model to claim jurisdiction over crimes committed by their nationals abroad. As far as serious crimes are concerned also the common law countries adhere to the nationality principle and have furthermore not protested against the use of this principle in criminal matters by other States (Malcolm N Shaw, p. 589).\n\nThe possibility to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction pursuant to Article 12(2)(b) does not extend to the case where only the State of which the victim is a national is a State party (so-called passive personality principle). Instead the provision is reduced to the active personality principle.\n\nThe issue of a possible obligation to co-operate with the ICC is handled in the same way as in the case of territorial jurisdiction, i.e. only the State parties to the Rome Statute are obliged to co-operate.\n\nThe Prosecutor has considered the possibility to prosecute in relation to alleged acts in Iraq (a non-party State) by nationals of the United Kingdom, a State Party. On the basis of the admissibility assessment pertaining to gravity, the Prosecutor decided not to proceed with an investigation into the situation in Iraq, (Annex to Update on Communications Received by the Office of the Prosecutor: Iraq Response, 9 February 2006). The preliminary examination was reopened in 2014 (OTP Press Release: Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, Re-opens the preliminary examination of the situation in Iraq, 13 May 2014).\n\nAuthor: Dominik Zimmerman, revised by Mark Klamberg\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 12(3)\n\n[180] 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception in accordance with Part 9.\n\nArticle 12(3) concerns non-Party States. It is a residue of the 1994 draft statute of the International Law Commission where consent was required by States on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn situations where neither the relevant territorial State nor the relevant nationality State is a party to the Statute, and where the UNSC does not refer the situation to the Prosecutor the ICC may still exercise jurisdiction provided the territorial State and/or the nationality State (being a non-State Party) on an ad hoc basis accepts the exercise of jurisdiction of the ICC. The declaration by which the approval of jurisdiction of the Court is being affirmed ‘must be express, unequivocal, and precise as to the crime(s) or situation it applies to.’ (Stéphane Bourgon, p. 563.)\n\nProvided a declaration has been lodged with the Registrar of the ICC pursuant to Article 12(3), the accepting State thereby commits itself to co-operate with the ICC as if it were a State Party. This commitment is limited, however, to the crime(s) in question and does thus not embrace any investigation and/or prosecution of crimes other than those covered by the declaration. This facultative obligation to co-operate is in line with Article 34 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties according to which ‘[a] treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.’\n\nThe wording ‘the crime in question’ contained in Article 12(3) must furthermore be interpreted in accordance with Rule 44. Accordingly the ‘Article 12(3)-declaration’ made by a non-State Party implies the ‘acceptance of jurisdiction with respect to the crimes referred to in Article 5 of relevance to the situation’ (emphasis added by the author), rather than individual crimes or specific incidents (Carsten Stahn et al, pp. 427–28; Hans-Peter Kaul, p. 611). As an example, the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, while not being a party to the Rome Statute, accepted the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court regarding crimes committed on its territory since the events of 19 September 2002 (see Press Release of 15 February 2005, Declaration under Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute, 18 April 2003 and Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, ICC PT. Ch. III, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, ICC-02/11-14, 3 October 2011, para. 10). A similar declaration, extending the temporal jurisdiction back to the time of the entry into force of the Statute, was made by the Ugandan government in December 2003 (see letter of the Prosecutor of 17 June 2004 attached to the Decision Assigning the Situation in Uganda to Pre-Trial Chamber II, ICC-02/04-1, 5 July 2004) as well as by the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see letter of the Prosecutor of 17 June 2004 attached to the Decision Assigning the Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo to Pre-Trial Chamber I, ICC-01/04-1, 5 July 2004). Due to its facultative character, Article 12(3) is in line with the overall State sovereignty-friendliness of Article 12.\n\nArticle 12(3) moreover provides the possibility for States to extend the ratione temporis jurisdiction of the Court. Pursuant to Article 11(1) the Court has jurisdiction only over crimes committed after the entry into force of the Statute. With regard to States that have become parties to the Rome Statute after its entry into force the jurisdiction only extends to crimes committed after the entry into force of the Rome Statute for that State, unless that State in accordance with Article 12(3) accepts jurisdiction for acts committed prior to ratification but after the entry into force of the Statute. However, it is likely that the Court may also consider facts that occurred prior to the time specified in an Article 12(3)-declaration—for the purpose of securing evidence or uncovering acts of a continuing nature—provided that these facts are linked to events that occurred after that time (Carsten Stahn, p. 429–31).\n\nCross-reference:\n\nRule 44\n\nDoctrine:\n\nSharon A.

Absent from the statutes of international criminal tribunals created ad hoc, such provision assumes foundational value in the ICC architecture because of its prospective, permanent and potentially universal mandate [Schabas, 2011, p. 157].\n\nAs the Article’s structure shows, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) is the authority deputed to analyse situations in which crimes under the Court’s jurisdiction may have been committed, then independently decide whether to open an investigation and, if the case, prosecute one or more individuals. Hence, States Parties’ and Security Council referrals have the purpose of bringing a certain situation under the Prosecutor’s attention.\n\nResort to the said triggering mechanisms does not require the territorial State’s previous consent. Victims, their relatives and non-governmental organizations are not mentioned in Article 13, but can file communications to the OTP asking for the opening of an investigation. States that are not Parties to the ICC Statute cannot refer situations to the Prosecutor, but may act through the Security Council or just provide information in view of an investigation to be opened ex Article 13(c). Notably, Article 12(3) does not establish an additional triggering mechanism, but allows States that are not Parties to accept the Court’s jurisdiction ad hoc, i.e. without becoming Parties (whilst States Parties accept the Court’s jurisdiction prospectively and unconditionally)[Stahn et al., 2005, p. 425]. Such acceptance is ‘just’ a precondition for the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction, which would still need to be triggered via Article 13.\n\nAs made clear by the provision, referrals concern ‘situations’, not specific cases. Pre-Trial Chamber (PTC) I has clarified that ‘situations’ are “generally defined in terms of temporal, territorial and in some cases personal parameters” [Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Decision on the Applications for participation in the proceedings of VPRS 1, VPRS 2,VPRS 3,VPRS 4,VPRS 5 and VPRS 6, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-101-tEN-Corr, 17 January 2006, para. 65. See also Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Decision Concerning Pre-Trial Chamber I's Decision of 10 February 2006 and the Incorporation of Documents into the Record of the Case against Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/06-8-Corr, 24 February 2006, para. 21; Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga, Decision on the evidence and information provided by the Prosecution for the issuance of a warrant of arrest for Germain Katanga, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-4, 5 November 2007, para. 9; Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, Decision on the Prosecutor’s Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, ICC PT. Ch. III, ICC-01/05-01/08-14-tENG, 10 June 2008, para. 16], and refer basically to the set of circumstances subject to investigation and prosecution. Most situations have so far been delimited with reference to a particular region or country (e.g. Northern Uganda or Central African Republic). The Comoros referral is the first not to define the situation geographically, but ‘with respect to the 31 May 2010 Israeli raid on the Humanitarian Aid Flotilla bound for Gaza strip’, and the first one to invoke a vessel’s flag as precondition for the exercise of jurisdiction [Referral under Articles 14 and 12(2)(a) of the Rome Statute arising from the 31 May 2010, Gaza Freedom Flotilla situation, 14 May 2013, available at https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Referral-from-Comoros.pdf]. PTC I explained that prosecutions can be initiated as long as they remain within the boundaries of the situation object of the referral. This means that the Prosecutor can investigate not only crimes that have already been committed or are ongoing at the time of the referral, but also subsequent ones “in so far as they are sufficiently linked to the situation of crisis referred to the Court” [Prosecutor v. Callixte Mbarushimana, Decision on the Prosecutor’s Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Callixte Mbarushimana, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/10-1, 11 October 2010, para. 6. The view was later confirmed in Prosecutor v. Callixte Mbarushimana, Decision on the \"Defence Challenge to the Jurisdiction of the Court\", ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/10-451, 26 October 2011, paras. 26-27].\n\nOnce recourse has been made to one of them, the mechanisms listed in Article 13 cannot be used in reverse to prevent the Court from exercising its jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the Security Council possesses the power to defer investigations or prosecutions by means of Article 16, and the OTP has the possibility not to proceed with investigations – subject to the procedures enunciated by the Statute and, in particular, by Article 53. Such procedures allow the different stakeholders and the Court itself to oversee and if the case challenge the jurisdiction activated through Article 13.\n\nIn this regard, it is also to be noted that Article 13 is not concerned with the admissibility of cases, which are instead regulated by subsequent provisions of the Statute (most notably Articles 17-20). Should an investigation be opened after a State referral or proprio motu, the Prosecutor has a duty to inform States Parties and States which would normally exercise jurisdiction over the relevant crimes, in order to give them a chance to challenge the Court’s jurisdiction or the case admissibility. Importantly, the entire ‘complementarity’ framework applies to all cases, regardless of the mechanism used to trigger the Court’s jurisdiction – thus, even if the referral came from the Security Council (see infra) [As showed by the admissibility decisions in the Libya situations. See Prosecutor v. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi, Judgment on the appeal of Mr Abdullah Al-Senussi against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I of 11 October 2013 entitled “Decision on the admissibility of the case against Abdullah Al-Senussi'”, ICC A. Ch., ICC-01/11-01/11-565, 24 July 2014; and Prosecutor v. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi, Judgment on the appeal of Libya against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I of 31 May 2013 entitled “Decision on the admissibility of the case against Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi\", ICC A. Ch., ICC-01/11-01/11-547-Red, 21 May 2014].\n\nPreparatory works\n\nThe final version of Article 13 is the result of intense negotiations over several points. Referrals from States Parties and the Security Council were conceived since the beginning as the key triggering mechanisms for the Court’s jurisdiction [Report of the ILC 1994, Articles 21 and 25 (States) and 23 (Security Council)]. However, a few issues concerning States Parties referrals were seen as controversial.\n\nFirst, it was debated whether States Parties referrals could concern specific crimes, as opposed to situations. Moreover, since earlier drafts contemplated the possibility of accepting the Court’s jurisdiction only for certain categories of crimes (‘opt-in’ system), it was proposed to allow States to refer only crimes with regard to which they had accepted the Court’s jurisdiction (a sort of ‘reciprocity restriction’). Referrals concerning alleged acts of genocide could have been reserved to States party to the Genocide Convention [Report of the ILC 1994, Article 25(1)]. Once negotiations proceeded, however, the view that referrals should be centred on situations prevailed, in order to avoid politicization and to promote efficiency [ICC Preparatory Committee Report, 1996, para. 146]. Since the ‘opt-in’ system was also abandoned in favour of the Court’s automatic jurisdiction (subject to the ‘preconditions’ listed in Article 12), it was agreed to allow all States Parties to refer situations involving any crime under the Court’s jurisdiction. In this regard, nevertheless, it was debated whether the Court’s jurisdiction should be activated only by States Parties with an interest in the situation – e.g. the State on whose territory the situation occurred, or whose nationals were the perpetrators or victims, or which had custody of one or more perpetrators [Ad Hoc Committee Report, 1995, para. 112; ICC Preparatory Committee Report, 1996, para. 147]. Once it became clear that the Prosecutor would have been able to independently initiate investigations over any situation, restrictions on State Party referrals became less relevant. Thus, the view that all States Parties should be allowed to refer any situation to the Court succeeded, also in consideration of the symbolic fact that all States have an interest in the repression of international crimes [Kirsch, Robinson, 2002, p. 622; and ICC Preparatory Committee Report, 1996, para. 147].\n\nThe ILC Draft Statute of 1994 did not contain a provision on Prosecutor’s proprio motu investigations. However, subsequent negotiations evidenced a diffuse willingness to endow the Prosecutor with such a power, especially in light of the proven reluctance of States to initiate complaints before the existing human rights bodies, mostly due to diplomatic reasons [Ad Hoc Committee Report, 1995, paras. 113-115; ICC Preparatory Committee Report, 1996, para. 149]. Moreover, the possibility of submitting communications directly to the Prosecutor in view of a proprio motu investigation was seen as a form of direct access to justice for victims and non-governmental organizations [Kirsch, Robinson, 2002, p. 662]. Fears of politicization of an independent Prosecutor were addressed by creating a system of check and balances to her action, most prominently the need for an authorization from the Pre-Trial Chamber [Proposal submitted by Argentina and Germany, A/AC.249/1998/WG.4/DP.35, 25 March 1998].\n\nAuthor:\n\nAntonio Coco\n\nUpdated:\n\n15 August 2017\n\nArticle 13(a)\n\n[181] The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in Article 5 in accordance with the provisions of this Statute if: (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with Article 14;\n\nAnalysis\n\ni) Referral by a State Party\n\nAccording to Article 13(a), States Parties have the right to bring a situation under the Prosecutor’s attention by means of a referral, which follows the conditions enunciated in Article 14. Referrals activate the Court’s jurisdiction over all crimes that may have been committed in such a context. Therefore, a referral cannot be limited to crimes committed by a certain party to a conflict, or to crimes committed by specific individuals who – for instance – belong to a certain national, political or military group [See also Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Decision requesting clarification on the Prosecutor’s Application under Art 58, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-575, 11 October 2010, paras. 6-8]. The Prosecutor made this view clear when reacting after the Ugandan government’s referral, which pretended the Court’s attention to be focused only on the crimes committed by its political opponents [Situation in Uganda, Letter of Prosecutor dated 17 June 2004 annexed to Decision Assigning the Situation in Uganda to Pre-Trial Chamber II, ICC-02/01, ICC Presidency, 5 July 2004]. Referring ‘situations’ as opposed to specific crimes also carries a practical advantage: identifying specific crimes in a context of generalized violence might require a proper investigation in itself, a task which can be left to the ICC Prosecutor after the referral. This does not prevent referrals from including specific allegations concerning certain individuals or incidents [Rastan, 2011, p. 422 fn 2].\n\nWith the right to referral, States Parties are conceived as watchdogs against the commission of crimes under the Court’s jurisdiction. All States Parties can refer a situation to the Prosecutor, regardless of whether they have any link with the crimes committed in such situation. However, ‘diplomatic discomfort’ has hindered the exercise of such power, which might be perceived as unfriendly by States actively involved in the referred situation [Schabas, 2011, p. 159]. In this sense, it is easier for States to provide the relevant information to the Prosecutor and leave him the possibility to open an investigation proprio motu. For this reason, all State Party referrals resulting in the opening of a formal investigation, to date, have concerned situations occurring on the territory of the referring State. Such so-called ‘self-referrals’ offer a practical advantage for the Prosecutor when compared to proprio motu investigations. On one side, indeed, the decision to open an investigation following a State referral is not subject to an authorization by the PTC, as demanded instead by Article 15; on the other, the OTP is not exposed to the difficulty of justifying why it opened an investigation in a certain situation and not another, among the dozens of possible situations falling under the ICC jurisdiction [Schabas, 2011, p. 166].\n\nAfter having activated the Court’s jurisdiction, the referring State maintains only a limited power of control over the investigation and prosecution of the relevant crimes. According to Article 53(3)(a), indeed, referring States can request the PTC to review an OTP decision not to investigate or not to proceed after investigation. This, in turn, may lead the PTC to request the Prosecutor to reconsider its decision.\n\nAuthor:\n\nAntonio Coco\n\nUpdated:\n\n15 August 2017\n\nArticle 13(b)\n\n[182] (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or\n\nii) Referral by the UN Security Council\n\nAccording to Article 13(b), the UN Security Council can refer situations to the ICC Prosecutor in the exercise of its powers deputed to maintaining and restoring international peace and security. The reference to Chapter VII of the UN Charter means precisely that such referrals are dependent on a previous finding that an act of aggression or a breach or threat to international peace and security has occurred (Article 39 UN Charter). In the UN Charter system, Security Council referrals to the ICC could be most probably considered as a measure falling short of the use of force, in line with the wording of Article 41. Hence, Article 13(b) can be considered as a ‘bridging mechanism’ between the ICC and the Security Council powers [Rastan, 2015, p. 157 and fn 75], as a practical alternative to the creation of additional ad hoc international criminal tribunals. Indeed, entrusting an existing institution with the task of carrying out criminal proceedings over a certain situation could take, at least in theory, less time and resources than creating a new tribunal. As such, the presence of Article 13(b) in the ICC Statute can be ascribed to the view that recourse to the Court can be used – among other things – as a crisis management tool. Whether a Security Council referral is actually conducive to peace and stability in the affected regions remains controversial, and beyond the scope of this commentary.\n\nA reading of Article 12(2) – on preconditions to the exercise of ICC jurisdiction – reveals that the Security Council has a broader referral right when compared to States Parties. Indeed, the Security Council is not limited to referring situations where crimes appear to have been committed on the territory of a State Party or by a national of a State Party. The Security Council can ask the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute nationals of States that are not Parties for crimes committed on the territory of States that equally are not Parties. Correspondingly, the Security Council’s temporal delimitation of situations is not constrained by the Statute’s entry into force for any particular State, as long as it does not backdate the Court’s jurisdiction beyond the limit set in Article 11(1).\n\nSuch feature brings into question whether Security Council referrals are also a means for conferring jurisdiction to the ICC where the latter would not otherwise have it, or whether they remain a simple triggering mechanism in all circumstances. The first view assumes that the ICC jurisdiction is consent-based. Thus, Security Council referrals would grant to the Court jurisdiction precisely in the absence of State consent, normally expressed through ratification or a declaration ex Article 12(3). However, in so doing, the Security Council would make the ICC Statute’s substantive provisions retroactively applicable to nationals of States non-Party who performed the relevant conduct on the territory of States non-Party. This consideration has convinced some scholars to advocate for the use of customary international law as law applicable to such cases, in order to avoid a violation of the principle of legality [e.g. Milanović, 2011, pp. 34 and 37-38]. The second view, instead, presupposes that – when adopting the Rome Statute – States exercised universal prescriptive jurisdiction, binding all individuals in the world from the Statute’s entry into force onwards and sufficiently putting such individuals on notice of any criminal prohibition listed in the Statute [as described in Milanović, 2011, pp. 49 and 52]. Hence, the ICC would enjoy inherent universal jurisdiction with respect to the crimes listed in article 5, which however can only be exercised in presence of certain conditions, including ‘acceptance’ by States in the form of ratification of the Statute or an ad hoc declaration ex Article 12(3). Accordingly, a Security Council determination that a situation constitutes a threat to international peace and security would make up for the absence of the preconditions set in Article 12, but it would not create new jurisdiction for the Court [e.g. Sadat, Carden, 2000, pp. 409-410, and 412-413]. Such reading would confirm the nature of Security Council referrals as a ‘pure’ triggering mechanism, ensuring the internal consistency of Article 13. Additionally, it would avoid considering Security Council referrals as conferring retroactive jurisdiction to the Court, what could potentially create problems from a nullum crimen perspective. The language used throughout the Rome Statute, including in Article 12 (‘preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction’), appears compatible with this last reading. In this respect, one should note that the Court still cannot prosecute cases outside of its subject-matter (Article 5), temporal (Article 11(1)) or personal (Article 26) jurisdiction, even if arising from a Security Council referral.\n\nIn any case, the Security Council prominent Chapter VII powers do not absolve it from operating in conformity with the Statute of the ICC – a separate and autonomous international organization – when referring situations to the Court [Condorelli, Villalpando, 2002, pp. 575 and 578]. Thus, Security Council referrals cannot push the Court to act outside of its statutory legal framework by, e.g., asking it to investigate crimes committed prior to the Statute’s entry into force [Rastan, 2015, pp. 170-171]. This notwithstanding, it remains unclear whether the ICC could exercise a ‘quasi-constitutional’ control over the legality of a Security Council referral and, if yes, to what extent. Since, under Article 19, the Court shall verify its jurisdiction over any case brought before it, it seems logical that it could also examine whether the rules on triggering such jurisdiction have been respected. Whilst it is hard to imagine the ICC ever challenging the Security Council’s qualification of a given situation as posing a threat to peace and security, the question has been raised with regard to referrals that appear to be incompatible with the ICC Statute (e.g. excluding the Court’s jurisdiction over nationals of certain States) [Schabas-Pecorella, 2016, p. 700; see e.g. SC Res 1593, para. 6; SC Res 1970, para. 6]. It is controversial, in particular, whether incompatible clauses contained in the relevant Security Council Resolution could be ‘severed’ and considered as if not present (as opposed to invalidating the entire referral) [Cryer, 2006, pp. 213-214; Sluiter, 2008, pp. 878-881]. The early ICC practice on cases originating from Security Council referrals does not offer any conclusive information in this regard.\n\nArticle 18 implies that the procedure for preliminary rulings on jurisdiction and admissibility – whereby the Prosecutor communicates the opening of an investigation to all States which would normally exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed in the related situation – does not apply to investigations originating from a Security Council referral. Despite this procedural peculiarity, the entire complementarity framework continues to apply, since article 17 and 19 contain no exception for situations referred by the Security Council. Actually, Article 19(3) specifies that the Security Council is allowed to submit observations with regard to questions of admissibility of cases deriving from its referrals. As a matter of fact, the Court has already examined the admissibility of cases emanating from Security Council referrals [see supra, Gaddafi and Al-Senussi cases].\n\nLike referring States, also the Security Council can request the PTC to review an OTP decision not to investigate or not to proceed after investigation, if such decision concerns a situation arising from referral ex Article 13(b). This, in turn, may lead the PTC to request the Prosecutor to reconsider its decision (see Article 53(3)(a)).\n\nAs said, Security Council referrals might concern situations occurring on States that are not Party to the ICC Statute. As such, these States would not have any obligation to cooperate with the Court during investigations and other proceedings, unless the Security Council resolution containing the referral made such obligation explicit. Whilst Resolutions 1593 and 1970 have explicitly obliged the territorial States (i.e. Sudan and Libya) to cooperate with the Court, all other States (as well as regional and other international organizations) have been simply ‘urged’ to do so, making sure to recall that States that are not Parties do not have any obligation in this respect [SC Res 1593, para. 2; SC Res 1970, para. 5]. As a result, the extent to which States other than Sudan and Libya have to cooperate with the Court has been the object of much debate [especially with regard to the potential arrest of Sudan’s President, Omar Al-Bashir. See Akande, 2009; Gaeta, 2009; Tladi, 2013; Boschiero, 2015; Ventura, 2015].\n\nArticle 115 provides that the UN shall provide funds to the ICC, in particular to cover expenses brought about by Security Council referrals. The release of such funds shall be regulated by the terms of the Agreement between the UN and the ICC. Whilst Article 115 alone does not oblige the UN to cover the said expenses, the first two Security Council referrals still contained explicit indication that the UN would not bear any such costs [SC Res 1593, para. 7; SC Res 1970, para. 8].\n\nAuthor:\n\nAntonio Coco\n\nUpdated:\n\n15 August 2017\n\nArticle 13(c)\n\n[183] (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with Article 15.\n\niii) Proprio motu investigation by the Prosecutor\n\nThanks to the third triggering mechanism listed in Article 13, the ICC jurisdiction can be activated ‘internally’ when the Prosecutor decides to initiate an investigation. Since the Prosecutor – absent a State or Security Council referral – acts on its own decision, such investigations are commonly known as ‘proprio motu’ (i.e. ‘on its own impulse’ in Latin). This does not mean that the OTP acts without any external inputs. Victims, their relatives and non-governmental organizations can file communications to the OTP in order to convince it to open an investigation, and also States can provide information to the OTP to that effect (see Article 15(1-2)).\n\nArticle 13(c) differs in language from the first two paragraphs of the same article, since it does not mention “a situation in which one or more crimes appear to have been committed”. By mentioning an investigation “in respect of such a crime” (i.e. a crime under the Court’s jurisdiction) it seems to leave the door open for an investigation into one or more specific cases, as opposed to a broader situation. Whilst the first proprio motu investigations have indeed concerned ‘situations’, such difference in language should not surprise. The Prosecutor enjoys indeed a great discretion in selecting cases to be prosecuted even after having carried out an investigation into a ‘situation’, so it would not make a big difference to just investigate one or more specific cases after a preliminary examination of the general context. In this regard, prosecutorial discretion at the ICC is extremely wide when compared to national courts and even ad hoc tribunals, considering that only a small amount of all cases involving cases within the ICC jurisdiction will actually be prosecuted before the Court. The perception of such discretion is magnified by the fact that crimes which the OTP can decide not to investigate or prosecute are arguably more serious than those that a domestic prosecutor (even assuming she does have some sort of prosecutorial discretion) can decide not to investigate or prosecute.\n\nNevertheless, this seemingly wide discretion is tempered by the fact that investigations proprio motu can only be opened with a previous PTC authorization (Article 15). In this respect, according to the Kenya authorization decision, it appears that the Prosecutor may only seek authorization to investigate crimes that have already been committed or are ongoing at the time of the request [Situation in the Republic of Kenya, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/09-19-Corr, 31 March 2010, § 206]. Such stance seems to be premised on PTC II’s fear to lose its supervisory power if authorizing open-ended investigations, and has spurred criticism because it artificially decreases the Prosecutor’s ability to investigate complex and evolving situations of crisis [Rastan, 2012, pp. 21-22]. However, a different PTC, when authorizing investigations in Côte d’Ivoire, has affirmed that investigations on any crime subsequent to the Prosecutor’s request would still be covered by the authorization, as long as part of the same ongoing situation [Situation in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, Corrigendum to ‘‘Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire’’, ICC PT. Ch. III, ICC-02/11-14-Corr, 15 November 2011, paras. 178-179].\n\nOn a further note, PTC control powers include the prerogative to review decisions not to investigate or not to prosecute in accordance with Article 53. Moreover, should the Prosecutor decide to initiate an investigation after a State referral or proprio motu, she shall notify all States Parties and those States which would normally exercise jurisdiction over the crimes under scrutiny, giving them a chance to challenge the Court’s jurisdiction or the cases’ admissibility (Articles 18 and 19).\n\nAll the mentioned procedures aim at avoiding that the proprio motu power can be abused to initiate politicized or frivolous investigations.\n\nCross-references\n\n• Articles 5-8bis\n\n• Article 11\n\n• Article 12\n\n• Article 14\n\n• Article 15\n\n• Articles 17-19\n\n• Article 26\n\n• Article 53\n\nDoctrine 1.

Article 14 complements Article 13(a).\n\nState referrals were thought to have little potential for use, but the law-in-action has proven such expectations wrong. As a matter of fact, five out of nine situations before the ICC are based upon State referrals (Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic I and II and Mali).\n\nPreparatory Works\n\nA mechanism for States to trigger the ICC’s jurisdiction was uncontroversial, but the original idea focused primarily on “complaints” by injured States against other States [Article 25 of the ILC Draft Statute 1994]. During ad hoc Committee meetings in 1995, possibilities for trigger mechanisms were further discussed. Some delegations favored a broad referral tool, while others wanted to restrict the referral to “interested States”. Numerous options were included in brackets in Article 45 [25] of the Zutphen Draft 1998, which found its way into Article 11 of the Preparatory Committee’s Draft Statute 1998.\n\nAn alternative draft by the United Kingdom, entitled “Referral of a situation by a State”, was included into the Draft Statute 1998. This proposal suggested that “situations” rather than single cases should be referred, a phrasing that found its way into the final version of the Rome Statute. The UK’s proposal, intentionally or not, also altered the language moving away from the term “complaint”. It was changed to “State referring a situation”. No reference to self-referrals or the like can be found in the discussions.\n\nAnalysis of provisions and sub-provisions\n\nArticle 14 partly repeats Article 13(a). The object of the referral is a “situation”. The neutral wording “situation” was introduced to avoid complaint against specific individuals and as such reduces the prospect of States Parties referring individualized complaints rather than a conflict situation as a whole. Any State Party may refer such a conflict situation to the ICC under mentioned articles. In accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 14, the relevant circumstances shall be specified and the referral shall be accompanied by supporting documentation.\n\nAuthor: Ignaz Stegmiller\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 14(1)\n\n[185] 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of such crimes.\n\n“A State Party” refers to any State that has ratified the Rome Statute. A limitation to a certain State, i.e. the territorial or national State, was not included.\n\nIn the context of Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute the OTP initially denied an investigation with regard to Palestine due to its unclear status under international law. [Decision by the Prosecutor, Situation in Palestine, 3 April 2012]. In the context of Article 14, this question would have to be solved already beforehand when a State seeks to become a member of the Rome Statute in accordance with Article 125(3) Rome Statute. It is clear that only State Parties may use the trigger mechanism under Article 14. Non-State Parties are limited to a declaration under Article 12(3) and the appropriate trigger mechanism falls under Article 13(c), 15 of the Rome Statute.\n\nIn accordance with Article 125 (3) Rome Statute, Palestine then acceded to the Rome Statute (The State of Palestine accedes the Rome Statute, 7 January 2015). It is worthy to note that, despite its unclear status under international law, the accession was accepted and not only discussed during the Assembly of State Parties. Be that as it may, the OTP opened a new preliminary examination, this time on the basis of Article 14 Rome Statute (The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, opens a preliminary examination of the situation in Palestine, 16 January 2015).\n\nReferrals of State Parties can be divided into two categories: third party referrals and self-referrals. Earlier drafting history focused on third party referrals, but practice shows an increasing tendency towards self-referrals by States. According to the prevailing interpretations of Articles 13(a) and 14, self-referrals are referrals by a State Party of a situation in which crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the Court appear to have been committed on that State Party’s territory [Müller/Stegmiller, 2010, p. 1272]. The Office of the Prosecutor adopted a policy of inviting and encouraging such voluntary self-referrals [Paper on Some Policy Issue before the Office of the Prosecutor, September 2003].\n\nTo date, all referrals under Article 14 are such self-referrals, except Palestine. In Palestine, crimes were allegedly committed by Israel, and if this referral leads to full investigations, it would constitute the first referral in the sense of a \"complaint\" against a third state. In five situations referred to it under Article 14 the Office of the Prosecutor initiated (full) investigations pursuant to Article 53(1) Rome Statute:\n\nIn the Situation of Uganda, the President of Uganda referred “the situation concerning the LRA” to the ICC in 2004 [ICC - President of Uganda refers situation concerning the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) to the ICC, 29 January 2004 (ICC-20040129-44)]. Despite the wording of the referral (“concerning the LRA”), the Prosecutor is conducting investigations against all involved parties [Statement by Luis Moreno-Ocampo, Prosecutor of the ICC - Informal meeting of Legal Advisors of Ministries of Foreign Affairs, 24 October 2005, p.7,]. The Prosecutor thus redefines the situation referred to him as encompassing “all crimes committed in Northern Uganda in the context of the ongoing conflict involving the LRA” [Prosecutor v. Kony et al., ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision to Convene a Status Conference on the Investigation in the Situation in Uganda in Relation to the Application of Article 53, ICC-02/04-01/05-68, 02.12.2005, para.5].\n\nThe second referral concerned the Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo where the Chief Prosecutor received a letter signed by the President in 2004 [Prosecutor receives referral of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 19 April 2004 (ICC-OTP-20040419-50)].\n\nA third self-referral was received by the Chief Prosecutor on behalf of the government of the Central African Republic in 2005 [ICC - Prosecutor receives referral concerning Central African Republic, 07 January 2005 (ICC-OTP-20050107-86)], and a fourth referral regarding the Central African Republic (\"Situation in the CAR II\") was received in May 2014 [Referral under Articles 13 (a) and 14, 30 May 2014]\n\nA fifth referral by Mali was received in 2012 [Referral letter by the Government of Mali, 13 July 2012].\n\nAnother self-referral by the Comoros “with respect to the 31 May 2010 Israeli raid on the Humanitarian Aid Flotilla bound for Gaza Strip, requesting the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court pursuant to Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the Rome Statute to initiate an investigation into the crimes committed within the Court’s jurisdiction, arising from this raid’’ was also under scrutiny by the Office of the Prosecutor [Referral under Articles 14 and 12(2)(a) of the Rome Statute arising from the 31 May 2010, Gaza Freedom Flotilla situation, 14 May 2013]. The referral by the Comoros was rejected on the basis of Article 53 (1) Rome Statute (Statement of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, on concluding the preliminary examination of the situation referred by the Union of Comoros: “Rome Statute legal requirements have not been met”, 6 November 2014). However, as noted above, the sitution of Palestine as a whole has now been referred (again) by Palestine itself and is pending before the ICC-OTP.\n\nIt may be noted that in the Situation of Kenya, the Office of the Prosecutor initially also favored a self-referral [Agreed Minutes of the Meeting between Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo and the delegation of the Kenyan government, 3 July 2009].\n\nThe practice of self-referrals was highly disputed amongst scholars and practitioners [see, for example, Schabas. 2010, Article 14, 306 et seq.], but according to the Chambers in Lubanga and Katanga does not face legality concerns. [Prosecutor v. Lubanga, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision concerning Pre-Trial Chamber I's Decision of 10 February 2006 and the Incorporation of Documents into the Record of the Case against Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC-01/04-01/06-8-US-Corr, 24 February 2006, para. 35; Prosecutor v. Katanga and Chui, ICC T. Ch. II, Reasons for the Oral Decision on the Motion Challenging the Admissibility of the Case (Article 19 of the Statute), ICC-01/04-01/07-1213, 16 June 2009, paras. 79-80].\n\nDespite the unclear drafting history, that is only supplementary in nature, the terminology “referral” and “refer” rather than “complaint” is neutral and allows for action by any State Party, be it the State Party on which territory the conflict took place. In Lubanga, PT. Ch. I mentioned that “[…] the self-referral of the DRC appears consistent with the ultimate purpose of the complementarity regime [...]”. [Prosecutor v. Lubanga, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision concerning Pre-Trial Chamber I's Decision of 10 February 2006 and the Incorporation of Documents into the Record of the Case against Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, ICC-01/04-01/06-8-US-Corr, 24 February 2006, para.35]. In Katanga, T. Ch. II further clarified, in the context of an admissibility challenge by the Defence, that:\n\n“[…] However, if a State considers that it is more opportune for the Court to carry out an investigation or prosecution, that State will still be complying with its duties under the complementarity regime, if it surrenders the suspect to the Court in good time and cooperates fully with the Court in accordance with Part IX of the Statute. […] The Chamber is not in a position to ascertain the real motives of a State which expresses its unwillingness to prosecute a particular case. A State may, without breaching the complementarity principle, refer a situation concerning its territory to the Court if it considers it opportune to do so, just as it may decide to carry out an investigation or prosecution of a particular case. […]” [Prosecutor v. Katanga and Chui, ICC T. Ch. II, Reasons for the Oral Decision on the Motion Challenging the Admissibility of the Case (Article 19 of the Statute), ICC-01/04-01/07-1213, 16 June 2009, paras. 79-80].\n\nThe possibility of self-referrals was upheld by the Appeals Chamber in Katanga and Chui stating that “the Statute does not prevent a State from relinquishing its jurisdiction in favour of the Court” [Prosecutor v. Katanga and Chui, ICC A. Ch., Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Germain Katanga against the Oral Decision of Trial Chamber II of 12 June 2009 on the Admissibility of the Case, ICC-01/04-01/07-1497, 25 September 2009, para. 85; in the situation in Central African Republic, Prosecutor v. Bemba, ICC T. Ch. III, Decision on the Admissibility and Abuse of Process Challenges, ICC-01/05-01/08-802, 24 June 2010, paras. 259-260].\n\nPolicy concerns of the practice of self-referral are further discussed in doctrine and evaluated more critically [Schabas, 2010, pp.309-312; Stegmiller, 2011, pp.131-134; Arsanjani & Reismann, 2005, p.394; Apuuli, 2006, p.185; Akhavam, 2005, p.411]. Similarly, withdrawals of self-referrals, meaning that the State attempts to regain its ius puniendi by taking its former referral back, have gained academic interest [Maged, 2006, pp.419-422; El Zeidy, 2009, pp.55-56]. The issue could have arisen in the Ugandan situation, where Museveni threatened to withdraw the case and solve the Kony problem by himself, but was never taken to the level of challenging the ICC’s jurisdiction or admissibility. Article 127(1) of the Rome Statute states that a State that withdraws from the Statute shall not be discharged from the obligations arising from the Statute while it was a party. From a contextual point of view, withdrawals of referrals are not consistent with the procedural system of the ICC, which provides for challenges under Articles 18 and 19 of the Rome Statute. Furthermore, Article 16 Rome Statute regulates a deferral mechanism for the Security Council. Any other withdrawal or deferral possibility cannot be found in the ICC’s procedural system.\n\nAuthor: Ignaz Stegmiller\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 14(2)\n\n[186] 2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.\n\nThe formalities regulated in paragraph 2 are not further specified in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Rule 45 foresees a submission in writing. There is little practical relevance of this provision so far. It regulates the accompanying information that a State has to provide to the Office of the Prosecutor. The wording (“shall”) implies a duty to provide information, however the extent remains unclear and should have been further specified by the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. “As far as possible” and “as is available” allow for a variation of a strict duty. “Supporting” and “relevant” are also open to interpretation.\n\nThe Presidency needs to be informed by the Prosecutor pursuant to Regulation 45. Furthermore, OTP Regulation 30 foresees a notification of UN Security Council if a State referral reaches the level of a “reasonable basis” to initiate an investigation under Article 53(1) Rome Statute.\n\nCross-references:\n\n1.

In combination with Article 13(c) Rome Statute it outlines the proprio motu power of the Prosecutor. The expression proprio motu means “on his own motion”.\n\nThe provision regulates a complex preliminary examination procedure. In contrast to the trigger mechanisms of a State or Security Council referral, the Pre-Trial Chamber must authorize an investigation (Article 15(3), (4) Rome Statute). To-date, such decisions were rendered in the situations of Kenya and Côte d'Ivoire. In the Kenya situation, PTC II highlighted that Article 15 of the Rome Statute is “one of the most delicate provisions of this Statute” [Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC-01/09-19, 31 March 2010, para. 17]. The (former) Chief Prosecutor was very reluctant to make practical use of the proprio motu power during the first eight years of the ICC’s activities.\n\nPreparatory Works\n\nThe proprio motu power was one of the most controversial aspects during the Rome Conference and political issues had to be resolved before the adoption of the Rome Statute. Opponents and proponents of the mechanism did agree that the inclusion or absence of the mechanism would fundamentally affect the ICC system [Bergsmo & Pejić, 2008, p.582].\n\nThe International Law Commission discussions in 1994 did not even foresee a prosecutorial proprio motu power and provided only for State Party and Security Council referrals. This changed during the Ad Hoc Committee debates in 1995 and the autonomous power of initiating investigations by the Prosecutor was brought to the negotiation table for the first time. A draft proposal was then adopted at the Preparatory Committee’s 1996 session, followed by Article 25bis of the Preparatory Committee’s session in 1997, which was subsequently reproduced without change in Article 46 Zutphen Draft Statute:\n\nArticle 25 bis:\n\n“The Prosecutor [may] [shall] initiate investigations [ex officio] [proprio motu] [or] on the basis of information [obtained] [he may seek] from any source, in particular from Governments, United Nations organs [and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations]. The Prosecutor shall assess the information received or obtained and decide whether there is sufficient basis to proceed. [The Prosecutor may, for the purpose of initiating an investigation, receive information on alleged crimes under Article 20(a) to (d) from Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, victims and associations representing them, or other reliable sources.]]”\n\nThe Preparatory Committee’s meetings from 1996-1998 were characterized by opposing debates. Two groups crystalized, the so-called “like-minded” States in favor of a proprio motu power and a strong Prosecutor, and an opposing group that feared politically motivated or frivolous proceedings by the Chief Prosecutor [Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC-01/09-19, 31 March 2010, para.18 with fn.23]. A joint Argentine-German proposal of 25 March 1998 led to broader acceptance of a prosecutorial proprio motu power. The proposal limited the Prosecutor’s preliminary examinations to “information received from other parties” and introduced the approval by the Pre-Trial Chamber. The current version of Article 15 is largely identical to the Argentine-German proposal.\n\nDuring the Rome Conference, 76 percent of the participating countries - in total numbers 61 States - supported a proprio motu power. It was yet unclear until the end of the negotiations whether the mechanism would find its way into the Rome Statute. Despite opposition by States, such as the United States, China, India and Japan, Article 15 was finally adopted.\n\nAnalysis of provisions and sub-provisions\n\nPreliminary examinations are on-going in Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Ukraine, Palestine, Colombia, Georgia, Guinea, and Nigeria [Report on Preliminary Examination Activities 2013, Office of the Prosecutor, November 2013; see also the ICC-OTP website on Preliminary Examinations]. Examinations with regard to the Comoros, Korea and Venezuela were closed.\n\nIt is worthy to note that preliminary examinations (pre-investigations) are conducted with regard to all three trigger mechanisms. Rules 48 and 104 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence lead to a partial overlap between Article 15 and 53 Rome Statute and the same factors need to be assessed [Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC-01/09-19, 31 March 2010, para. 23; Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, ICC PT. Ch. III, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, ICC-02/11-14, 03 October 2011, para. 17; Situation in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, ICC PT. Ch. III, Judge Fernàndez de Gurmendi’s separate and partially dissenting opinion to the Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, ICC-02/11-15, 3 October 2011, para.24; Stegmiller, 2011, pp. 209 et seq.].\n\nRegulation 25 of the OTP Regulations states:\n\n“The preliminary examination and evaluation of a situation by the Office may be initiated on the basis of:\n\n(a) any information on crimes, including information sent by individuals or groups, States, intergovernmental or non- governmental organisations;\n\n(b) a referral from a State Party or the Security Council; or\n\n(c) a declaration pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 3 by a State which is not a Party to the Statute. […]”\n\nMoreover, Regulation 29(1) OTP Regulations spells out:\n\n“In acting under Article 15, paragraph 3, or Article 53, paragraph 1, the Office shall produce an internal report analysing the seriousness of the information and considering the factors set out in Article 53, paragraph 1(a) to (c), namely issues of jurisdiction, admissibility (including gravity), as well as the interests of justice, pursuant to rules 48 and 104. The report shall be accompanied by a recommendation on whether there is a reasonable basis to initiate an investigation. […]”\n\nA first report under regulation 29(1) OTP Regulations was published in the Mali Situation [Situation in Mali, Article 53(1) Report, 16 January 2013]. The process and criteria are thus similar with regard to all trigger mechanisms. However, the process under Article 15 with regard to proprio motu information takes significantly longer in practice.\n\nIn fact, no provision in the Rome Statute or the Rules of Procedure and Evidence regulates a specific time period for the completion of a preliminary examination. Regulation 19(4) OTP Regulations states, rather generally, that the evaluation shall continue as long as the situation is investigated. The decision whether or not a “reasonable basis” is reached marks the line between preliminary examinations and investigations, but the question remains what happens if the Prosecutor does not officially announce such a decision. The matter led to a controversy in the situation in the Central African Republic when the Prosecutor gave no information on the situation under scrutiny for over two years. The Pre-Trial Chamber emphasized that a preliminary examination must be completed within “reasonable time”, regardless of its complexity [Situation in the Central African Republic, ICC PT. Ch. III, Decision Requesting Information on the Status of the Preliminary Examination of the Situation in the Central African Republic, ICC-01/05-6, 30 November 2006, p.4]. The Prosecutor provided information on the status of the preliminary examination, but pointed out that this information was given on a voluntary basis as the Pre-Trial Chamber has no supervisory function with regard to this early stage and that the decision to seek the opening of investigations lies within the discretion of the Prosecution alone [Situation in the Central African Republic, ICC PT. Ch. III, Decision Requesting Information on the Status of the Preliminary Examination of the Situation in the Central African Republic, ICC-01/05-6, 30 November 2006]. The disagreement was neither explicitly settled by jurisprudence nor by an amendment of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The status and length of preliminary examinations could be (partly) resolved by a new rule or regulation [Stegmiller, 2011, p.235].\n\nAuthor: Ignaz Stegmiller\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 15(1)\n\n[188] 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu on the basis of information on crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.\n\n“May initiate” suggests discretion of the Prosecutor. Commentators have stated that the Prosecutor’s initiation right is “unconditional and discretionary, but carefully balanced by the need for authorization by a Pre-Trial Chamber” [Bergsmo/Pejić, 2008, p.585, para.9]. The phrasing has to be put into context with the followings words: “investigation” and “proprio motu”.\n\nUnder this paragraph, the Prosecutor may not start full investigations, despite the wording, but may only initiate preliminary examinations. Taking a glance at the whole provision of Article 15, its accompanying rules 48 and 104 of the Rule of Procedure and Evidence and regulations 25 and 29 of the OTP Regulations, paragraph 1 of Article 15 should not be misconstrued. Paragraph 6 of Article 15 refers to the “preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 (emphasis added)”. This preliminary state can be clearly distinguished from the investigation stage under Article 54 Rome Statute.\n\n“Proprio motu” means on his/her own initiative without any formal referral by a third party. Article 13(c) of the Rome Statute names Article 15 Rome Statute as one of three trigger mechanisms, on equal footing with Articles 13(a), 14, and Article 13(b).\n\nIn consequence, the discretionary “may” under paragraph 1 simply means that the Prosecutor has the right to pre-investigate gathered information if he/she thinks fit. Full investigations, however, require authorization under paragraph 3 of Article 15 Rome Statute. The decision of the PTC to authorize full investigations under Article 15(4) Rome Statute is then – procedurally – on equal footing with the Article 53(1) Rome Statute. Only after this decision one may speak of investigations in the narrow sense.\n\nArticle 15 therefore embraces two different levels: First, preliminary examination methods are regulated in paragraphs 1, 2, and 6. Second, an intermediary phase is foreseen during which the Pre-Trial Chamber “checks and balances” the proprio motu power of the Prosecutor in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4, and 5.\n\nAuthor: Ignaz Stegmiller\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 15(2) - The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness\n\n[189] 2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received.\n\nThe Prosecutor “shall” analyze “the seriousness” of the “information received”. In practice, the Office of the Prosecutor uses “communication” as an abbreviation and short term rather than “information received” or “information on crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court”. The latter terms are statutory language, but the former (“communication”) is not. In regulation 26 of the OTP Regulations it is held that all information shall be registered. The newly drafted OTP Regulations also depart from the term “communication” and the Prosecutor seems to acknowledge the legal notion of “information received”.\n\nThe term “shall” indicates a legal duty to analyze all information received. A qualified member of the Office of the Prosecutor must analyze all incoming information. Once information is classified as such under Article 15 Rome Statute, there is thus a statutory obligation to conduct a preliminary examination and inform the information provider of the result. This duty is acknowledged pursuant to regulation 28(1) OTP Regulation [see further below at Article 15 paragraph 6 Rome Statute].\n\nPublic reports may be made available if confidentiality concerns allow pursuant to rule 46 Rules of Procedure and Evidence, regulation 28(1) OTP Regulations. The Office of the Prosecutor issued public reports with regard to examinations that were ceased in Iraq [OTP response to communications received concerning Iraq, 09 February 2006], Venezuela [OTP response to communications received concerning Venezuela, 09 February 2006], Palestine [Decision by the OTP with regard to the situation in Palestine, 03 April 2012], Korea (Article 5 Report, 23 June 2014), and Comoros (Article 53(1) Report, 6 November 2014). A policy paper further spells out the Office of the Prosecutor’s understanding of preliminary examination activities [Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations, November 2013] and general reports with regard to on-going examinations are given annually [Report on Preliminary Examination Activities 2013, Office of the Prosecutor, November 2013].\n\n“Seriousness” refers to a minimum threshold for information to qualify under Article 15 for further inquiries. The Rome Statute is silent of the content of “information” under Article 15. Too broad and general information might not provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for the Prosecutor to launch an investigation. It is not a test of appropriateness [Bergsmo/Pejić, 2008, p. 587, para. 13] but rather an initial assessment of information to filter out unfounded, frivolous information. For this purpose, the Office of the Prosecutor makes preliminary distinctions between matters which “manifestly fall outside the jurisdiction of the Court” and other, more profound information pursuant to regulation 27 of the OTP Regulation that is further processed. The Office of the Prosecutor has also established a filtering process comprising four phases, each phase focusing on a distinct statutory factor for analytical purpose: phase 1 deals with an initial assessment of the “seriousness” of information, phase 2 turns to the preconditions of jurisdiction under article 12 Rome Statute, phase 3 deals with admissibility under Article 17 Rome Statute, and phase 4 examines the “interests of justice” in accordance with Article 53(1)(c) Rome Statute [Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations, November 2013, paras.77-84].\n\nThe Prosecutor thus understands “seriousness” as an initial evaluation of information based on its evidentiary value, taking into account the reliability of the source and the credibility of the information, and examining information from multiple sources as a means of bias control pursuant to regulation 24of the OTP Regulations. “Seriousness” is an evidentiary assessment linked to the legal factors of Article 53(1) and implies some degree of sincerity.\n\nAuthor: Ignaz Stegmiller\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 15(2) - additional information\n\n[190] For this purpose, he or she may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non-governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.\n\nAccording to the second sentence of Article 15(2) Rome Statute, the Prosecutor “may seek additional information” and “may receive written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court”. The decision to seek further information is discretionary. The investigation steps are yet limited to the two mentioned possibilities and must be interpreted narrowly. The Prosecutor “cannot deploy all this investigative powers” [Situation in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, ICC PT. Ch. III, Judge Fernàndez de Gurmendi’s separate and partially dissenting opinion to the Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, ICC-02/11-15, 3 October 2011, para.29]. Forms of cooperation from States are limited and Part 9 of the Rome Statute does not yet apply to preliminary examinations. Rule 104(2) of the Rule of Procedure and Evidence repeats the measures of Article 15(2), introducing the same method for State referrals and SC referrals. Information can be gathered from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and other reliable sources. The Prosecutor may send requests for information to these sources. Field missions for the purpose of analyzing the information are possible, but have to be limited to obtaining further information. Such field missions were conducted inter alia in Colombia, Guinea, and Nigeria (Report of the Activities of the Court, International Criminal Court, 21.10.2013 [ICC-ASP/12/28, para.72, para.74, para.77].\n\nTestimony is to be received at the seat in The Hague. Rule 47 of the Rule of Procedure and Evidence specifies this further. For example, a record in accordance with rules 47(1), 111 and 112 Rule of Procedure and Evidence is always necessary. The provision is not to be construed as narrowly as meaning testimony has to be taken at the seat, but refers to receiving it. Therefore, testimony can be gathered through national authorities and be transmitted to The Hague.\n\nThe Prosecutor may gather information through the measures outlined in Article 93 Rome Statute. While States might assist the Prosecutor, regardless of the application of cooperation provisions under the Rome Statute, in the case on non-compliance, however, Articles 86 and 87 et seq. Rome Statute do not apply, thus not imposing a legal duty to cooperate [Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations, November 2013, para .85; Informal Expert Paper, Fact-Finding and investigative functions of the Office of the Prosecutor, including co-operation, September 2003, paras. 25-29]. During preliminary examinations, the Prosecutor therefore must rely on voluntary cooperation and gather information through open sources to the extent available.\n\nAuthor: Ignaz Stegmiller\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 15(3) - reasonable basis to proceed\n\n[191] 3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any supporting material collected.\n\nThe Prosecutor submits a “request for authorization” to the Pre-Trial Chamber if preliminary examinations provide for a “reasonable basis” to proceed with an investigation. At this stage, the intermediary step from pre- to full investigations is foreseen, in other words, the Prosecutor continues the inquiry after the authorization by means of the associated powers under Article 54.\n\nThe Prosecutor determines “reasonable basis” at this stage, and he or she “shall” submit a request for authorization. “Shall” refers to the binding obligation to seek authorization, in contrast to State referrals and Security Council referrals, where the Prosecutor enjoys freedom from such an authorization. This notwithstanding, the Prosecutor should, if a “reasonable basis” under Article 15(3) and 53(1) Rome Statute has been reached, in principle, investigate unless exceptions arise. The incorporation of Article 53’s criteria, above-all the “interests of justice,” into the Prosecutor’s final determination, provides an opening for prosecutorial discretion and such an exception.\n\nThe Prosecutor must be aware of the fact that the Pre-Trial Chamber will subsequently apply the same reasonability test under Article 15(4) Rome Statute. The content of reasonable basis is the same under Article 15(3) and (4) and under Article 53(1) Rome Statute, which is restated by rule 48 Rules of Procedure and Evidence.\n\nRule 50(2) Rules of Procedure and Evidence further states that the request shall be made in writing. In accordance with regulation 49 Court Regulations, the Prosecutor attaches the information collected in the situation in hand to the authorization request in annexes. As far as possible, the annexes should include a chronology of relevant events, maps detailing relevant information, including the location of the alleged crimes, and an explanatory glossary of relevant names of persons, locations and institutions. Regulation 38(1)(e) of the Court Regulations establishes a limit of 100 pages for the document requesting the authorization. It is thus clear that the wording “any supporting material collected” of Article 15(3) Rome Statute does not mean “any and all”. The Office of the Prosecutor is only obliged to forward as much supporting material as is required to demonstrate to the Pre-Trial Chamber that the conclusion to further investigate is well-founded. “Supporting material” cannot, however, be reduced to incriminating evidence only and the Office of the Prosecutor may not purposefully withhold information which does not support its conclusion. Article 54(1)(a) Rome Statute that requires the Office to investigate “incriminating and exonerating circumstances equally”. In accordance with rule 46 Rule of Procedure and Evidence, supporting material can be submitted as a confidential attachment to the request.\n\nAuthor: Ignaz Stegmiller\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 15(3) - Victims may make representations\n\n[192] Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.\n\nVictims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber when a request under Article 15 Rome Statute is made. Information of victims may be brought to the attention of the Prosecutor under Article 15(1) and (2) Rome Statute, and as a corollary of the important role of victims in proprio motu proceedings their participation is regulated during early procedure. If the Prosecutor intends to seek a request under Article 15(3) Rome Statute, all victims known to the Prosecutor or to the Victims and Witnesses Unit must be informed under rule 50(1) Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Victims may then make representations in writing according to rule 50(2) and (3) Rules of Procedure and Evidence. A time limit of 30 days applies pursuant to rule 50(3) Rule of Procedure and Evidence and regulation 50(1) Court Regulations. In addition, regulation 38(2)(a) Court Regulations limits the documents submitted by victims under Article 15(3) and rule 50(3) to no more than 50 pages. The Chamber may request additional information from victims who have made representations and, “if it considers appropriate, may hold a hearing” pursuant to rule 50(4) Rules of Procedure and Evidence. In practice, victims sought participation in the situations in Kenya and Côte d’Ivoire. For the qualification as a “victim” the Chambers consulted rule 85 Rules of Procedure and Evidence [Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, ICC PT. Ch. III, Order to the Victims Participation and Reparations Section Concerning Victims’ Representations Pursuant to Article 15(3) of the Statute, ICC-02/11-6, 6 July 2011, para. 10]. With regard to the participation procedure and victims’ rights at such an early stage, jurisprudence has not yet found a common practice. The Pre-Trial Chamber in Kenya requested the Victims Participation and Reparations Section (VPRS) to:\n\n“(1) identify, to the extent possible, the community leaders of the affected groups to act on behalf of those victims who may wish to make representations (collective representation);\n\n(2) receive victims’ representations (collective and/or individual);\n\n(3) conduct an assessment, in accordance with paragraph 8 of this order"
