        "text": "Dutch cable operator\n\nCasema (Centrale Antenne Systemen Exploitatie Maatschappij) was a major Dutch provider of cable television, internet and telephone services until the merger with Multikabel and @Home to Ziggo on 16 May 2008. The company was mainly active in and around the cities of The Hague, Amersfoort, Utrecht, Amstelveen, and Breda.\n\nCasema was founded on 7 January 1970 and was at that time mainly concerned with cable television. Until 1998, it was owned by KPN (75%) and Netherlands Public Broadcasting (25%). The company was then sold to France Télécom, who in turn sold Casema to the Carlyle Group, GMT Communications and Providence Equity Partners in 2003.\n\nIn July 2006, Cinven and Warburg Pincus purchased the company for €2.1 billion.[1] The new owners also bought Multikabel and @Home, two other cable companies. From 16 May 2008, the three companies were merged to form Ziggo.\n\nAt the time of the merger, Casema had approximately 1.4 million customers. The merged company has approximately 3.3 million customers.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDigital television in the Netherlands\n\nList of cable companies in the Netherlands\n\nTelevision in the Netherlands\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
