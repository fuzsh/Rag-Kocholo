        "text": "Completely bananas\n\nCologne\n\nWalls have become canvases on which street artists can express themselves in XXL. The underground culture is particularly active in Cologne, which has become a haven for urban artists. The highest density of murals can be found in the district of Ehrenfeld. Original, small-format street art, such as stickers, paste-ups and stencils (graffiti with a template) can be admired at trendy local spots on Körnerstraße, Lichtstraße and Heliosstraße.\n\nThomas Baumgärtel – alias: Banana Sprayer – is a well-known street artist in Cologne. He sprayed his first banana back in the 1990s. Now thousands of the pop art yellow fruits adorn walls throughout Germany and around the world. His message is mostly political, so it comes across as brazen and is intended to provoke. \"Spraying bananas,\" said the artist, \"is an expression of my fight for art and freedom of speech.\" A mindset shared by many underground artists.\n\nPink Man and Fraternal Kiss\n\nBerlin\n\nStreet art has been elevated to monument status in Germany's trendy capital. The East Side Gallery in Berlin's Friedrichshain district uses a 1.3-kilometre section of what was once the Berlin Wall as its canvas. Street artists the world over have transformed the grey wall, a visual symbol of separation, into a brightly coloured monument to freedom and reconciliation. Its most famous paintings include The Fraternal Kiss by Dmitri Vrubel and a Trabant breaking through the cement by Birgit Kinder.\n\nBut street art culture in Berlin goes far beyond the creations on the Berlin Wall. The scene is huge. Even the big names in street art, including Banksy, Tristan Eaton, BLU and many others, have let their creativity run free on the walls of Berlin. Urban artworks, some of which are on a huge scale, can be predominantly found in the districts of Mitte and Kreuzberg. One of the most famous and sociopolitically controversial murals is The Pink Man by BLU. At first glance, it looks like a pink monster. On closer inspection, the viewer can see a cluster of several hundred naked men clinging on to each other.\n\nSea dog in XXL\n\nHamburg\n\nStreet art tells the story of a city from a new perspective, one that is worlds apart from the forms of expression of other established artists. Visitors strolling through Altona, the Gängeviertel, St. Pauli or Ottensen in Hamburg will find maritime murals that tell tales of life in the Hanseatic city at every turn. In a back courtyard in the Sternschanze quarter, for example, a larger-than-life \"sea dog\" wearing a striped T-shirt and with a big bushy beard looks down at passers-by from the wall. On a building wall near the Reeperbahn, two massive seagulls scrap over a delicious morsel of food. There's even a street art memorial dedicated to Hans Albers, a famous blond man with an accordion, who sang fervent songs about the sea and the sailors' burning desire, and who shaped the image of Hamburg's red-light district.\n\nHall of Fame\n\nFrankfurt\n\nWhen junction boxes, bridges, concrete piers and fire hydrants are adorned with graffiti, posters, stickers or stencil art, some see it as criminal damage, others view it as art. The authorities used to come down hard on sprayers, but today they are often recognised as artists and the powers that be are more relaxed about their activities. In some places, it was suddenly decided that urban sprayers should have dedicated spaces for their creative compositions. The Ratswegkreisel Hall of Fame in Frankfurt is one of them. Countless graffiti, from the funny to the revolutionary to the satirical, have ignited a firework of urban art here. And yet astonishing feats have also been achieved beyond this dedicated area. The dynamic and vibrant Bull vs. Bear mural was created on Friedberger Landstraße to pay homage to Frankfurt's status as a financial hub. The Flying Horses by world-famous graffiti artist Andreas von Chrzanowski, aka Case Ma'Claim, at Frankfurt East train station is also worth seeing. His subject is visualising motion. The recurring element of \"running hands\" can be found in his works in Amsterdam, Basel and in the Ostendstraße S-Bahn station in Frankfurt.\n\nAnimal Farm\n\nLeipzig\n\n\"Is that art or can we get rid of it?\" This pronouncement sums up the relationship many have with modern art, including street art. Viewers are increasingly learning to appreciate the lesser-known artworks that embellish the often-grey look of a city. Brushes, paint rollers and spray cans are also being used more and more often in Leipzig, the trendy metropolis in Saxony, and no bin, traffic light or road sign is safe. Connewitz, Südvorstadt and Plagwitz are the up-and-coming street art districts here. Political issues are often depicted in the street art here. Take the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean Sea as an example: In this instance, twelve artists worked on this piece on the corner of Arno-Nitzsche-Straße and Bernhard-Göring-Straße in Connewitz. It was named after the famous Animal Farm quote by George Orwell: \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"\n\nScandal surrounding Wholetrain\n\nMunich"
