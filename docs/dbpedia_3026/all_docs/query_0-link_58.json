        "text": "Casema selects BigBand Networks for digital cable infrastructure\n\nBigBand Networks, a leading provider of network platforms for video, voice and data services, has been selected by Casema for an end-to-end digital cable infrastructure deployment.\n\nThis multi-vendor solution is led by BigBand Networks’ European professional services organisation, and is based on the company’s digital video platforms. It enables Casema to directly provide more than one million out of its 1.3 million analogue cable subscribers with digital television services at the highest levels of reliability, quality and cost effectiveness.\n\n“BigBand Networks has distinguished itself with platforms and a solution design that address our current and ongoing needs,” said Andrei Noppe, vice president network operations for Casema. “We are leveraging the best-of-breed characteristics of infrastructure from BigBand Networks and other industry leaders to expand offerings to our subscribers, while enhancing our economics and management capabilities.”\n\nThis deployment links 13 regional headends in the southwestern and central parts of The Netherlands to a primary headend in The Hague. Programming is sourced on the BigBand BMR (Broadband Multimedia-Service Router) which controls channel line-ups, video quality and bandwidth efficiency. Distribution between sites is achieved by cost-effective Gigabit Ethernet, with advanced route and source redundancy to assure service availability. High-density edge modulation transmits scores of high-quality video programs and services to a variety of digital set-top boxes which Casema subscribers can purchase retail.\n\nBigBand Networks has designed Casema’s digital cable system to include end-to-end monitoring and active management availability for real-time control over operations. The deployment is fully standards-compliant, openly incorporates encryption for content security, and enables ongoing innovations and enhancements to fulfill evolving objectives.\n\n(GB)"
