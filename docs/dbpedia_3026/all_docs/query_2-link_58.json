The coal and steal industry had shaped this town\n\n100 years ago to what it was and to what it has become now. While wandering the city you can still guess how vibrant it must have been.\n\nLet’s be clear about this, there is no future in coal as there is no such thing as clean coal, but there is so much potential in cities that already\n\nhave the infrastructure, the neighborhoods and the hard working families.\n\nThe artist met some great locals who already are working on a better future for their community. Go check it out yourself and make sure to stop at Ash’s Arthouse cafe and treat yourselves with some damn good Halloumi Sandwiches.\n\nGood luck Port Kembla, you got this!"
