The Institution does not collect healthcare, financial, or government identification (e.g., social security) information.\n\nYour Internet Protocol address is automatically logged by CustomViewbook and the Institution may request this information from the CustomViewbook provider (the “Platform Provider”) to help us understand and analyze trends, and improve services and user experience.\n\nAll Collected Information is stored on secure servers that are only accessible to the Platform Provider CustomViewbook and the Institution.\n\nThe Institution may import, store, and use any Collected Information in our admissions database and related processes, and may contact You solely for the purpose of exploring Your potential future association with the Institution.\n\nThe Platform Provider will not distribute Your personal information unless You “opt in” for a specific additional use of Your information. Such use would be disclosed to You prior to collection of that information. Platform Provider may use Collected Information in aggregate for statistical purposes and to evaluate the performance of the CustomViewbook platform, unless You specifically object to such use.\n\nGoogle Analytics Privacy\n\nPlatform Provider includes a standard implementation of Google Analytics, which uses “cookies” to collect data that may be provided to the Institution. Visit “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps” (located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) to see how Google will use this data.

You may contact the Institution concerning the use of Your personal information by sending an email to CaseMA@alfredstate.edu. Collected Information is retained and processed by the Institution when a CustomViewbook is generated by Your request on the Institution's website, or in response to email, social media posts, or printed material supplied by the Institution. Initial processing takes place on secure, US-based cloud hosting platforms operated by Platform Provider, and subsequent processing takes place on protected assets under the control of the Institution. Collected Information may be subject to automated processing by the Institution to compare Your stated interests to their offerings. Encrypted data will be stored by Platform Provider in accordance with contractual terms with the Institution. You have the right to request access or an electronic copy, make corrections, request erasure, restrict processing, withdraw consent, or lodge a complaint regarding the handling of Your Collected Information by the Institution at any time.
