A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is simply a way of changing the identity source of your network connection and establishes a protected chain when using public networks. VPN's are becoming the go-to way of maintaining security online, and just so happen to allow users the chance to view content from different countries. That brings us to iPlayer, and accessing its unique content through a British IP Address.\n\nHow Does VPN Work When Watching BBC in Netherlands\n\nInternet in Netherlands first became available in 1993 with the first public ISP connecting the country and its people to the Global Network. As of 2021, there are 16,385,220 people in Netherlands using the internet, out of the total population being 17,086,118 people, reaching 95.9% of the total population. Some of the major ISPs (Internet Service Providers) in Netherlands are Casema, Claranet, Hacktic Netwerk. The highest percentage of people with Internet access and ability to use a VPN to watch the BBC iPlayer from Netherlands live in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague.\n\nA VPN reroutes your internet traffic from your ISP in Netherlands (Internet Service Provider) through a network server. In that way, the data you send out from your computer or smartphone does not reach the website, cloud service, or app from your device IP but the VPN server IP address. The process hides your Netherlands IP address and protects your anonymity on the Internet. Here is the kicker - you can choose the location of the server you are using. It can be in the UK, US, Canada, or any other location the VPN service offers. That is how you can bypass the localisation issue of the BBC iPlayer and enjoy the quality BBC programming from every corner of the world.\n\nHow to Unblock BBC in Netherlands\n\nTo unblock BBC services, you'll first need to get your hands on a Virtual Private Network service.
