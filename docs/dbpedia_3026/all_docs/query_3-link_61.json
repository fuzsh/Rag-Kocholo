I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the organizations, businesses, and individuals who generously funded these scholarships. Receiving this recognition has boosted my confidence in my academic abilities and motivated me to strive even harder to achieve my goals. As a speaker mentioned during the ceremony, none of this would have been possible without the help and sponsorship of these philanthropists. This experience has taught me a valuable lesson for the future, and helped foster the aim that I too will be able to give back to my community. As I move forward, I am committed to making the most of this opportunity and paying it forward by supporting others in need. Additionally, I have also become one of the 37 students to receive the \"Early College Promise Scholarship\" and be admitted to the program to receive a free education+required materials at no cost for an entire year at MCC! The financial assistance will undoubtedly alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with pursuing higher education. Considering that I'm graduating High School with 23 college credits already, I hope to receive my associates quicker than most and hope to work towards double majoring in Accounting and Criminal Justice at Manning School of Business, UMass Lowell. #scholarship #education #philanthropy #scholarships #community #gratitude #highereducation #experience"
