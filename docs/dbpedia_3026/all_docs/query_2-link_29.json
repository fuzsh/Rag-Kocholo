        "text": "A Dutch cable television company owned by France Telecom S.A., Casema, said it was in talks to buy the cable unit of Essent N.V., the biggest Dutch power supplier. Casema could sell shares, join with a United States cable company or get help from France Telecom to finance the purchase, which could cost about 5.4 billion guilders ($2.3 billion), the company said. The purchase would double Casema's share of the Dutch cable market to 42 percent and allow it to overtake United Pan-Europe Communications N.V. as the biggest Dutch provider."
