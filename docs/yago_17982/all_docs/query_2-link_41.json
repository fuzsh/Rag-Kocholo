        "text": "US electronic hardcore outfit Machine Girl has officially signed with the iconic Australian label Future Classic.\n\nTo celebrate this new partnership, the duo has released their first single, “Until I Die”, and announced their highly anticipated new album, MG Ultra, slated for release on October 18th.\n\nMachine Girl, an American electronic music project, was created in 2012 by Matt Stephenson in Long Island, New York.\n\nIn 2015, the project expanded into a duo with the addition of percussionist Sean Kelly, who brought live drums to their intense performances.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the frenetic rhythms of Chicago footwork and a wide array of digital culture references, Machine Girl’s sound embodies a DIY ethos with a distinctly hi-fi, maximalist vision.\n\nMachine Girl’s profound cultural impact and dedicated fanbase underscore their global resonance. Their notorious live performances, characterised by raw energy and unpredictability, have earned them a reputation as one of the most exciting acts in the underground music scene.\n\nTheir role as the main support on 100 Gecs’ tour further attests to their widespread appeal, showcasing their ability to engage diverse audiences.\n\n“Until I Die”, the first single from MG Ultra, is a genre-bending track that combines elements of breakcore, jungle, footwork, noise, and metal. The track shows off their innovative approach to music, merging the frenetic energy of breakcore with the visceral intensity of metal and noise.\n\nMG Ultra promises to be a culmination of Machine Girl’s decade-long exploration of these genres, offering a complex sonic narrative that addresses themes of alienation, dysmorphia, and the commodification of the mind, with the album’s title itself is a play on the infamous MKUltra experiments.\n\nSigning with Future Classic marks a significant milestone in Machine Girl’s career. Known for its roster of cutting-edge artists, Future Classic is the perfect home for Machine Girl’s innovative sound. This partnership is expected to elevate Machine Girl’s profile, bringing their music to a broader audience while maintaining the integrity of their DIY roots."
