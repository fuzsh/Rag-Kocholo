        "text": "New York City electronic hardcore duo Machine Girl have announced MG Ultra, their sixth studio album and their first in half a decade. It arrives in October and marks the duo’s debut with their new label home Future Classic. The news arrives today along with the record’s amped-up lead single “Until I Die.”\n\n“Until I Die” is a very danceable blend of breakbeats and glitchy noise that puts a heavy emphasis on melody. It’s not the most “hardcore” Machine Girl have ever sounded, but it still goes pretty hard. Listen to “Until I Die” and see the tracklist for MG Ultra below.\n\nMG Ultra by Machine Girl\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 “Until I Die”\n\n02 “Nu Nu Meta Phenomena”\n\n03 “Sick!!!”\n\n04 “Just Because You Can”\n\n05 “Hot Lizard”\n\n06 “Innerface”\n\n07 “Motherfather”\n\n08 “Ass2Mars”\n\n09 “Cicadas”\n\n10 “Grindhouse”\n\n11 “House of Mirrors”\n\n12 “Schizodipshit”\n\n13 “Psychic Attack”\n\nMG Ultra is out 10/18 via Future Classic."
