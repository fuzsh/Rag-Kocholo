        "text": "Director: Noboru Iguchi\n\nWriter: Noboru Iguchi\n\nStars: Minase Yashiro, Asami and Kentarô Shimazu\n\n******SPOLIERS********\n\nI FINALLY got around to watching The Machine Girl last night and I have to say, I don’t know why I put it off for so long! As you may or may not all know, I’m rather partial to Japanese Splatterpunk films and The Machine Girl is a particularly good one.\n\nThe basic story is that Ami’s brother, Yu, is being bullied by the local rich kid, Sho. His father is the local head honcho of the Hanzo Hattori gang and he’s a rather nasty piece of work. Sho and his gang bully Yu and his best friend Takeshi relentlessly and at the beginning of the film, are both killed by Sho’s gang. Ami and Yu’s parents committed suicide a few years back after being accused of murder. You never actually find out if they were guilty or not but ultimately it has meant that Ami has had to look after Yu so is naturally very protective. After Yu’s murder, Ami naturally goes on a murdering rampage of revenge and along the way enlists the help of Takeshi’s parents. They are reluctant at first but given time, start relish the idea of getting they’re own back on Sho and his family for their son’s untimely end.\n\nThe gore in this film is just as you would expect for this genre – squirting arteries, messy loss of limbs and gloriously over the top death scenes. Unlike some other films of this type, it’s very nicely shot and aside from the odd few death scenes, doesn’t feel at all cheaply made like some others do. My particular favourite moment in this film is Sho’s mothers Drill Bra. Utterly ludicrous, hilariously funny and just what you want in a good Splatterpunk film! Another best bit for me is when Miki uses Ami’s chainsaw hand to replace her severed foot to take out one of the bad guys. Genius!\n\nAll in all, this is a well written film, the acting is just right and the acting is actually pretty good. I’ve seen A LOT of Splatterpunk films and this one I would say is one of the better ones. It’s got the same quality feel to it as Vampire Girl Vs Frankenstein Girl and Tokyo Gore Police so it feels polished but doesn’t take itself too seriously at all.\n\nSo, if you like Japanese school girls running around taking revenge with a machine gun for an arm, then this is one for you!\n\nVISIT THE WEBSITE:\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER:"
