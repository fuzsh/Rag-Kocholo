        "text": "With newly discovered high definition elements, now is the perfect time to rev up the engine and roll out THE MACHINE GIRL for another spin! Ami, an average school girl is trying to provide a normal life for herself and her younger brother following the tragic death of their parents. But her whole world comes crashing down when her brother and his best friend are brutally murdered by a ruthless gang of bullies headed by the spoiled brat son of a local yakuza boss! When Ami sets out to avenge her slain sibling, she quickly finds herself way over her head and minus a left arm! Bleeding profusely and left for dead after a yakuza attack, Ami seeks shelter in an auto repair garage where two kindly mechanics take pity on her and help rehabilitate her. To assist Ami in her unrelenting quest for revenge, they fit her arm stump with a custom mechanical appendage that sports a high-powered rotary cannon-style machine gun! Soon, Ami meets and teams up with the equally vengeful mom of her brother s slain friend and together they wage an unholy two-woman war against the yakuza s lethal army of hit men and ninja assassins in the cinema s greatest all-out apocalyptic, crimson-drenched showdown! (97 mins.)"
