        "text": "Directed by: Noboru Iguchi\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nActors: ‚ÄúAmi‚Äù Minase Yashiro, ‚ÄúMiki‚Äù Asami Sugiura.\n\nMinase Yashiro as ‚ÄúAmi‚Äù\n\nPlot/ Short description:\n\n‚ÄúAmi loses her brother to yakuza bullies then her arm when she seeks retribution. Two mechanics take pity on her and create a new limb out of a machine gun allowing her and a chain-saw wielding woman to seek out their revenge.‚Äù\n\nPlease note: This is a gore film. If the topic or imagery disturb you STOP READING NOW PLEASE.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT STOP READING NOW***\n\nI try not to include spoilers, however on occasion I do unintentionally‚Ä¶. So be warned. Spoilers MAY or MAY NOT occur.\n\nMy thoughts on the film‚Ä¶\n\nI actually prefer outlandish gore movies.\n\nI mean what is there to dislike?\n\nAnyway, The Machine Girl, delivers on the action and more than delivers on ridiculous amazing gore and epic kills‚Ä¶ Overall‚Ä¶. pretty entertaining film. I‚Äôve watched it at least once a year.\n\nThe close up shots, ridiculous gore, hefty fight scenes, and added blood sprays and badassery of Miki and Ami‚Ä¶ Makes it one of my all time favorites.\n\nIt‚Äôs a revenge tale obviously (synopsis/description clearly outlines this). It has some moments that drag a bit, but that‚Äôs few and far between. You‚Äôll be more impressed with the awesome machine gun arm Ami carries as easily as she chops Yakuza bullies in half. (watch for exploding heads ‚Ä¶ Kinda)\n\nI don‚Äôt see negatives with The Machine Girl\n\nBut I‚Äôll play devil‚Äôs advocate and say‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs subtitled‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs about all I can think might irk a few.\n\nSubtitled films don‚Äôt bother me in the slightest. However, if they bother you, you‚Äôll likely be pissy watching The Machine Girl‚Ä¶ Sad for you üò¢\n\nAnyway here‚Äôs my brief and attempted spoiler free reviews/rundown of one of my favorite Japanese gore action/shock gore films ‚ò†Ô∏è\n\nThanks for reading my dearest Goreys"
