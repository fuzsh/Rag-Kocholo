        "text": "Machine Girl\n\nRePorpoised Phantasies\n\n4.0\n\nexcellent\n\nReview\n\nby pizzamachine USER (632 Reviews)\n\nDecember 16th, 2022 | 11 replies\n\nRelease Date: 2020 | Tracklist\n\nReview Summary: A whale-y phantastic EP.\n\nRePorpoised Phantasies succeeds as an electronic music representation of the tropics, while sounding quite similar to N64 games. If I had to compare this album to any artist it would be Lone, especially considering the album Galaxy Garden. However, Machine Girl can take the simple concept of an oceanic album, and breathe life into it far beyond the capabilities of other electronic artists.\n\nWith synthesizers that sound like steel drums and a hazy sun, RePorpoised involves lovely instrumental storytelling. Add vocal samples, something that sounds like an orca, almost heavenly synths, speedy drums, and boom: a frenetic, oceanic fantasy. Definitely a chaotic trip to the beach, which won’t be for everyone, but it’s entirely evocative of memories either way. There will always be the argument that the sound Machine Girl creates is too much, bombastic overkill, but the restraint shown here is seasoned. These wind swept synthesizers are rarely boring, but they’re also inviting.\n\nWhat the album gets right is its focus. Beats are forward facing punches that can shake a car. With constant, showery noise effects, it’s easy to get lost in the atmosphere too. The glitchy, unexpected transitions are right where they need to be, and the culmination of motifs creates a catchy, unique experience.\n\nMy final note is that the album is a great listen. It might push someone over the edge if they have a headache, but otherwise it’s a blast. This is the type of electronic dance music that Machine Girl excels at, bringing to mind Gemini. This is easily one of Machine Girl’s best efforts, bar none. It’s another world to get transported to and lost in, as per usual. So good, so fresh sounding - so long!\n\nTweet\n\nRecent reviews by this authorJinjer King of EverythingDarko (US) StarfireDropout Kings Riot MusicNightrage Remains of a Dead WorldAnette Olzon RaptureBlood Stain Child Cyberia"
