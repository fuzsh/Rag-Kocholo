        "text": "A live-action television series adaptation of Akira Hiramoto's Prison School manga will premiere on the MBS and TBS stations this October. Noboru Iguchi (The Machine Girl, Nuigurumaa Z) is directing the late-night series at the production studio ROBOT, and the cast will be announced later.\n\nNorth American publisher Yen Press licensed the manga for North America, and it describes the series:\n\nHachimitsu Private Academy was a revered and elite all-girls' boarding school on the outskirts of Tokyo...once upon a time. But with the new school year comes a revision to school policy: Boys are to be admitted into the student body for the first time ever. But on his first day at Hachimitsu, Kiyoshi Fujino discovers that he's one of only five boys enrolled at the school. Their numbers overwhelmed by the thousand girls in the student body, is it heaven or hell that awaits these five (un)fortunates?!\n\nIguchi said with a laugh that when he heard about the live-action television plans, he initially asked, \"Is this for real?\" He felt that if he squandered this chance to adapt this amusing manga, he would regret it for the rest of his life. He asked fans to wait a little bit longer for the cast announcements for Kiyoshi, Gakuto, the Vice-President, Hana, and the President.\n\nHiramoto launched the manga in Kodansha's Young Magazine in February 2011, and it has 6 million copies in print. (The 18th volume will ship on August 6.) The manga won the Best General Manga award alongside YÅ«ji Moritaka and Keiji Adachi's Gurazeni manga at Kodansha's 37th Annual Manga Awards last year.\n\nThe manga is also inspiring an ongoing Summer television anime, and Funimation is streaming the anime.\n\nHiramoto also wrote the award-winning supernatural drama manga Me and the Devil Blues, which Del Rey published in North America. Hiramoto's Ago Nashi Gen to Ore Monogatari manga received a mobile phone anime adaptation in 2010. Hiramoto's Yarisugi Companion to Atashi Monogatari manga inspired a live-action film in 2011."
