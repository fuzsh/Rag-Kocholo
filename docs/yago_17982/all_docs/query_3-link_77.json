        "text": "Originally formed in New York City and recently relocated to Pittsburgh, Machine Girl is a solo turned two piece digital hardcore outfit consisting of vocalist and producer Matt Stephenson and drummer Sean Kelly.\n\nCutting their teeth on the DIY circuit across North America, Machine Girl have quickly become known for their unpredictable and cathartic live shows, amassing a rabid following of club kids, punks and metal heads reveling in the band's amorphous blur between grindcore mosh pit and underground gabber rave.\n\nAlongside fellow New York artists such as Bonnie Baxter, Prison Religion and Deli Girls, Machine Girl spearhead a recent wave of DIY music culture existing on the borders between punk, noise, techno, and rap. Sonically collapsing the borders between these genres, Machine Girlâ€™s music reflects the sensual overload of an omnipresent media. It represents a postmodern world in which cultural points of reference have become universal, readily available to anyone at any time to be consumed."
