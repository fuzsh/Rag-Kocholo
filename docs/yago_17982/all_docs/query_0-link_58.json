        "text": "RELEASE DATE: June 25, 2029\n\nOn June 25, 2029, Media Blasters is releasing the Blu-ray for The Machine Girl: Chronicles, which includes 2008’s The Machine Girl: Jacked! and 2019’s Rise of the Machine Girls.\n\nIn Noboru Iguchi’s The Machine Girl: Jacked!, a high school girl’s (Minase Yashiro) life is destroyed when her brother is killed. When her hand is cut off, she gets help from two mechanics, who fit her with a machine gun where her arm used to be. She unleashes her fury, avenging her brother’s death.\n\nWith newly discovered high definition elements, now is the perfect time to rev up the engine and roll out The Machine Girl for another spin! Looking sharper and better than ever, The Machine Girl: Jacked! is the definitive experience!\n\nAlso included is Yuki Kobayashi’s Rise of the Machine Girls, starring Himena Tsukimiya (Red Blade), Kanon Hanakage (Nowhere Girl) and *drum roll* cult martial arts star Tak Sakaguchi (Re:Born, Versus).\n\nMeet the two new mechanical enhanced sisters who replace their missing anatomy with high-powered automatic weaponry the same way some people collect tattoos! As sideshow freaks, the sisters just scrape by while secretly lusting for revenge against the sinister Dharma company that forced their poor mother to cash them in as babies for their body parts! Beware the wrath of two battle-busting sisters bent on vengeance!\n\nStay tuned for pre-order information.\n\nDisclaimer: cityonfire.com does not own any of the photos contained in the blog. cityonfire.com was made merely to pay homage to these films, directors, talent, etc. and not for any profit or commercial reasons.
