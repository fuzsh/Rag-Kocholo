Blu-ray (worldwide premiere) / DVD and 24-page booklet\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe two sisters Yoshi and Ami are orphans who earn their living with fight shows. When Yoshi is captured by the Dharma organ trafficking family, Ami sets out to rescue her sister. In the process, however, she loses her arm, which is later replaced by a machine gun. Ami thus becomes an almost unstoppable killing machine that only has one thing in mind: REVENGE!!!!\n\nThe madness continues! THE MACHINE GIRL 2: RISE OF THE MACHINE GIRLS is a bloodbath of a film that lives up to its cult predecessor, THE MACHINE GIRL. In terms of pacing and gore effects, the film easily outshines its predecessor, since there seem to be no limits. Cult actor Tak Sakaguchi (VERSUS) is also involved in this film-like battle record, although he really doesn’t take any prisoners either. Just as it should be at a real gore festival.\n\nAudio:\n\nGerman DTS-HD 5.1, Japanese DTS-HD 5.1\n\nSubtitle:\n\nGerman English\n\nFormat:\n\nBD: 2.35:1 1080p (DVD: 2.35:1 16:9)\n\nRunning time:\n\nBD: 80 minutes (DVD: approx. 76 minutes)\n\nBonus features:\n\nBehind The Scenes (OV)\n\nTrailers\n\n-24-page booklet with lyrics by Nando Rohner"
