Then her younger brother, Yu (and his friend Takeshi), were killed at the hands of Sho Kimura, the son of Yakuza gangsters. With the police labeling it a suicide, and Takeshi’s mother blaming Yu for her son’s death (due to Ami’s parents having been accused of murder and committing suicide in response), Ami realizes her brother’s killers are going to literally get away with murder.\n\nDiscovering her brother’s diary and a list people Yu wants to kill, Ami sets out to find the leader of the gang who killed her brother. Her first stop ends in disaster, as the boy named in the diary declines all knowledge of the event and his father attacks her for trying to smear the family name. Driven away, she returns later, killing the son with a kami (sickle), then then killing the boy’s mother. Upon realizing what she’s done, Ami snaps, deciding she will become a “demon” until she’s killed everyone connected with the murder of her brother.\n\nHaving found out where Sho Kimura lives, Ami attacks, armed with just a knife. While she kills several Yakuza soldiers, she’s eventually captured, and ends up having her arm lopped off. Escaping, she staggers down the road, eventually fetching up at Sugihara Motors (Takeshi’s parent’s shop). Suguru Suighara, Takeshi’s father, takes her in, sews up her arm, and nurses her back to health. Miki, Takeshi’s mother, eventually comes around, and while Suguru builds Ami a new arm, Miki trains her in various combat techniques.\n\nAs Ami and Miki prepare to head out on their quest for revenge, the Kimura attack, and Suguru is killed. Incensed, Ami and Miki torture a captured Yakuza soldier until he tells them where to find the Kimuras. Armed with Ami's new machine gun arm, a chainsaw, and other weapons, the two head out for a blood-soaked (and then some) finale.\n\nPersonality/Motivation: Ami has gone from an older sister concerned about her brother’s well-being to a revenge-filled maniac who will kill anyone and everyone associated with Sho Kimura’s gang or the Kimura ninja/Yakuza clan. She is utterly ruthless in battle, and only wants to see Sho (and his father) dead.\n\nQuote: \"Even if you don’t remember [Yu], he’s waiting for you in Hell!\"\n\nPowers/Tactics: Fairly athletic and combat capable before losing her arm, Miki’s training has made Ami even more effective. Normally she’ll start (and finish) any fight with long bursts from her Machine Gun Arm, and has been known to blow holes clean through a target with a concentrated burst. Normally, she targets one person at a time, but has been seen to fire at three at once (to limited effect). If unable to use her Machine Gun Arm, Ami is also quite effective with her hands and feet, and is skilled with the kami, using one to slit more than a few throats. Oh, and let’s not forget that if all else fails, she has a Chainsaw Arm as well.\n\nAppearance: Ami Hyuga (played by Minase Yashiro) is an attractive Japanese girl of average height and build with black hair that falls just to her shoulders. When acting as Machine Girl, she wears a fairly typical Japanese girl’s school uniform with a white blouse and a plaid skit.\n\nDesigner's Notes: Okay, before you go run out and try to find this movie, let’s get one thing straight—this might be the bloodiest movie I have ever seen (although Planet Terror might have it beat). Granted, the “blood” was of a level that reached parody, in which just about any cut results in a pressure hose geyser that would kill the victim in seconds if real. And lets not mention the various mutilations, dismemberments, and decapitations. Of course, with this level of violence, it’s hard to take seriously (the movie sure doesn’t), and part of me combated the squick factor by marveling at the effects (and laughing at some of the more insane sequences).\n\nAs for the Machine Girl (which is not her name in the movie), the character sheet her represents her right before she heads off for the final battle. Actually, there is a bit of a disconnect to the film, as the initial fight scene doesn’t make any sense when you look at the timeline of the rest of the movie. But that’s not all that important in the grand scheme of things. Anyway, I built Machine Girl to be a highly Talented Normal, with physical skills on par with above average mooks and the like. She’s not totally dominating in combat (unless fighting a hapless bunch of high school thugs), but her Machine Gun Arm does even the odds quite a bit. Still, if you want to make her tougher, give her +1 SPD, and some of the Combat Skill Level Super Skill builds from Dark Champions (such as Machine Gunner From Hell).\n\nThe Machine Girl's Hero Designer File\n\n(The Machine Girl created by Noboru Iguchi, character sheet created by Michael Surbrook)"
