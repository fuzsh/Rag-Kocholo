        "text": "Walker Pictures and Nishimura Eizo’s Dead Sushi, the latest horror/comedy from acclaimed Japanese director Noboru Iguchi, will World Premiere at Montreal’s prestigious Fantasia International Film Festival on July 22nd, followed shortly thereafter by its Asian Premiere at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan). Iguchi, best-known for his high-octane 2008 action/comedy The Machine Girl, has become an international sensation with jaw-dropping, boundary-pushing films such as RoboGeisha, Karate-Robo Zaborgar, and Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead.\n\nWe’ve scored and exclusive new clip from the film called “Flying Squid”, and it’s got a pretty high body count for only being a minute or so long. If you have yet to see a decapitation today, we’ve got you covered.\n\nDead Sushi, which stars 21-year-old martial arts prodigy Rina Takeda, “tells the tale of Keiko, the daughter of a legendary sushi chef, who runs away from home when his kung fu-like regimen becomes too severe. Finding work at a rural hot springs inn, she is ridiculed by the eccentric staff and guests, including the employees of a pharmaceutical firm there on a work vacation. But little do they know that a disgruntled former researcher has also come to the inn with a plan for revenge, using a serum he developed that can awaken the murderous instincts of ordinary sushi, turning it into bloodthirsty monsters! Keiko must use both her sushi training and her martial arts skills to save the others and defeat the flying killers.”\n\nFor more on the film you can check out the official website or its Facebook. Head inside for the clip!\n\nWriter and director Andrew Bell’s new vampire horror movie Bleeding is set to premiere at Grimmfest this Halloween season, and we’ve got the film’s festival trailer for you this week.\n\nWatch the trailer below and find the film’s festival poster underneath.\n\nIn Bleeding, “Vampire blood is harvested as a drug, and two desperate teenagers on the run from a vicious dealer break into an empty house and find a sleeping girl locked inside.”\n\nGrimmfest previews, “It might seem a strange claim for a narrative ostensibly about vampires, but this is a film with a rare, raw authenticity; a stark, grim, utterly unsentimental exploration of the nature of addiction, which keeps its genre elements dialed down low, focusing instead on the day to day existence of the small-town, small-time addict; the petty thefts and betrayals of friends and family, the desperate hustles, the confrontations with vicious but low-level dealers and their brutal head-busting goons.\n\n‘The protagonists could just as easily be junkies or crackheads or tweakers as vampires, and the film’s clear-eyed but compassionate and sympathetic depiction of suburban teenage desperation and nihilistic despair owes as much to films such as River’s Edge as it does to more overtly horror-themed narratives, and grounds the film’s more fantastic elements within an all-too-unnervingly real world, making it all the more harrowing, horrifying, and emotionally brutal.”\n\nJohn R. Howley, Jasper Jones and Tori Wong star.\n\nNicholas Payne Santos, Andrew Bell, Bofan Zhang, Kenneth Green produced Bleeding.\n\nAndrew Bell is a writer, director, actor and educator from the Pacific Northwest. He holds an MFA from Columbia University. His shorts Let Me Play and Wellness Check have played at festivals across the world and can be found streaming on CryptTV, ShortsTV, and SCREAMBOX.\n\nBleeding marks Bell’s feature directorial debut."
