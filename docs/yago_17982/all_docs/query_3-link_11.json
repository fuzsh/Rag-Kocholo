        "text": "Machine Girl is the brainchild of producer and DJ, Matthew Stephenson, featuring drummer, Sean Kelly. The two met performing together in middle school and later separated in high school, going on to perform music with separate projects. Based in Long Island at the time, Matt Stephenson created Machine Girl in 2012, a moniker he held onto since 2010. Debuting with the track “Gravity Girl”, Machine Girl went on to self-release their EP 13th Hour trailed by Electronic Gimp Music in 2013. Several other releases followed on London-based Dred Collective, compiled to create the debut full-length album ‘WLFGRL’. The project was a major success online, thriving in the blog centric era of music and introducing a new generation of listeners to breakcore genres that so heavily dominated the 90’s rave scene. The album's remix EP featured a variety of electronic producers, from DJ Earl of Chicago's Teklife collective to Detroit’s very own Sinistarr.\n\nThe second full-length ‘Gemini’, released by Orange Milk in 2015, received critical acclaim from blogs and fans alike, solidifying Machine Girl’s reputation as digitalcore’s golden child. In 2017, Stephenson shied away from their sonic signature that gained previous notoriety, bringing in Kelly to bridge the gap of their influences. The release of the aptly titled ...Because I'm Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For brought their metal roots to the forefront of a new sound, weaving euphoric synths and classic breaks in-between snarling vocals and distortion beyond coherence. The duo went on to release two more albums and a slew of EP’s and remixes, honing their cyborg sound; a hybridization of electronic programming and live instrumentation. 2022 saw Machine Girl taking on a new challenge with their soundtrack for the first person shooter game ‘Neon White”, a seemingly natural direction for the duo to take with their sound already drawing comparisons to video games, animation, and all things other worldly."
