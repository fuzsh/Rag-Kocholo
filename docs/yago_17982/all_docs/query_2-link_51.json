        "text": "There are good movies. There are bad movies. Then there are movies that are so bad, they somehow flip around and become good in their own special way.\n\nThe Machine Girl lay in the third category, although I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s so bad that it’s awesome.\n\nThe movie follows a college girl named Ami, whose brother is killed by the son of a Yakuza gangster. She goes out to get revenge for her brother, and winds up losing her arm in the process. Later she has a machine gun attached to it.\n\nI felt like I was watching an anime (and not a good one) brought to life. The gore is cartoonish, the dialogue ridiculous, and the plot basically non-existent.\n\nThat being said, it’s a fun movie. Don’t expect to do a lot of thinking, and don’t watch it if you don’t like gallon upon gallon of gore. The Machine Girl is cinematic junkfood at its finest; little more than fluff and bad special effects that somehow come together to make an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.\n\nI was a bit puzzled as to why it was categorized as a horror flick; it’s not scary and wasn’t intended to be so. Rather, it feels like a low budget version of Kill Bill.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed it. There’s nothing deep here, nothing scary, and certainly nothing new. It’s just a fun little movie for people who like flicks with low budgets and cheesy special effects."
