To say that director Noboru Iguchi is a colorful person is a bit of an understatement. He’s been known to show up to film festivals wearing diapers and generally entertaining the crowd with his huge smile and friendly demeanor. We caught up with him recently to talk about his latest film, The Machine Girl, which if you haven’t seen you need to immediately, if not sooner!

Its characters traipse through a hilariously unbelievable ultra-violent society that feels like it bled directly from a dog-eared manga. The Machine Girl exists in a world where all women wear schoolgirl outfits 24 hours a day and are packing guns and bullets that remove baseball-sized chunks of flesh from anyone who gets in their way.

How can you not love it for its absurdity alone? Check out the interview below.
