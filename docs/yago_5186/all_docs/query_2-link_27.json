        "text": "Jeffrey Hunter is best remembered today for his roles as half-breed Martin Pawley in John Ford’s classic western The Searchers (1956), as Jesus Christ in Nicholas Ray’s King of Kings (1961) and as Christopher Pike, the first captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, in the original Star Trek pilot. This work chronicles Hunter’s entire film and television career from his beginnings as a 20th Century–Fox contract player to his untimely death in 1969 at the age of 42.\n\nFellow 20th Century–Fox contract player Robert Wagner provides the Foreword and contributes his memories of working with Hunter. Former vice president and head of Desilu Studios Herbert F. Solow discusses Hunter’s role in the original Star Trek pilot and Lloyd J. Schwartz shares his memories of being present at Hunter’s audition for the role of Mike Brady in The Brady Bunch (1969). Hunter’s “lost” film Strange Portrait (1966) is also discussed in detail and his radio and theatre career highlighted.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAcknowledgments v\n\nForeword by Robert Wagner 1\n\nPreface 3\n\nIntroduction 5\n\n1.
