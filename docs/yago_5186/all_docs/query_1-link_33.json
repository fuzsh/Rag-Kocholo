        "text": "Hi there! My name is Emily McLaughlin and I am an agent here in the Snowshoe area. I am originally from Western Kentucky where I was born and raised in Paducah, KY. I went to college at Murray State University and majored in Agriculture Education. This is where I met my husband who was from West Virginia. After several years in the classroom, my life in Kentucky came to an end and a new chapter began here in West Virginia. Jarrett (husband) and I moved back to his home town of Dunmore and began growing our family on his traditional family farm. Now we are raising two children, cows, horses and sheep. We love being outdoors, and have a passion for farming and agriculture. Today, Jarrett and I are both in the real estate business and we enjoying assisting families find their dream homes and help make it a reality. We are here to help in every way possible please please use our resources!"
