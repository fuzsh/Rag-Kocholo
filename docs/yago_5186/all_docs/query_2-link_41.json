        "text": "Jeffrey Dale Hunter of Gilcrest, Colorado, passed away September 1, 2022 in Joplin, Missouri. He was 67. Jeff was born in Fargo, North Dakota on July 3, 1955 to Robert and Patricia Hunter. He chose to make his appearance in the world early while his father was on a fishing trip for the Fourth of July weekend. This set the tone for many of the antics Jeff would experience throughout in his life, which have provided many memories for his family and friends. Jeff never chose the easy way to do anything! Jeff and his family moved from Grandin, North Dakota to Boulder, Colorado in December of 1962. Jeff graduated from Fairview High School in 1973 and then he enrolled at UNC Greeley for a short time. Jeff found his calling working for King Soopers, where he had a long and successful career for 45 years. He retired in 2020 and during retirement enjoyed gardening, camping, and traveling with his wife, Laurie, who he married on February 23, 2013. He was also very creative and enjoyed making stained glass, rock art, and metal works which he shared with family and friends throughout his life. Jeff made his home in Gilcrest, Colorado and lived there for 45 years before he and Laurie moved to Carthage, Missouri in June of 2022. Their life together was spent having adventures with their side-by-side, transforming their home with many projects they enjoyed doing together, and just loving the time they had with each other. Jeff was a supporter. He never shied away from someone in need of a shoulder to cry on, he took opportunities to mentor others toward a better path in life, and those who needed him knew that he was only a phone call away. He took pride in being present for the many activities and adventures of his family. He was always in attendance for his children’s sporting events, double checking the math of the diving scores, just to make sure the judges did it correctly. He would pack his four-wheeler or fishing pole in a moment’s notice when an impromptu trip was made, and he would never say no to a beach vacation. He found a love for scuba diving in 2010 and this passion took he and Laurie to many amazing locations like Indonesia, Hawaii, Cozumel, the Florida Keys and the Cayman Islands. He obtained his Master Diver certification on August 19, 2013. Jeff was enormously proud of his children, Jeremy (Tabatha) Hunter and Jacque (Eric) Troudt, and Kevin (Jess) Reid. He loved spending time with his grandchildren, Bryant Hunter, Easton Troudt, and Kadin, Caston, and Jace Reid. He was known to brag about his five wonderful grandsons any chance he got. Jeff is survived by his wife, Laurie, children, grandchildren and sisters, Veralyn (Jim) Johansen and Rebecca Hunter. He is preceded in death by his mother and father, Robert and Patricia Hunter. Jeff’s hearty laugh, ready smile and love for life will be missed by his family and friends. His life will be celebrated at Journey Christian Church, 4757 W 31st Street in Greeley, Colorado on September 24, 2022 at 1:00 pm."
