        "text": "biography\n\nBorn Henry McKinnies in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 25, 1926, screen idol Jeffrey Hunter nursed early ambitions to be an actor. Growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by the mid 1940s Hunter had done quite a bit of local radio work and community theater. Hunter enlisted in the Navy after graduating from high school, and after his discharge in 1946, he attended Northwestern University. After graduating in 1949, he appeared in David Bradley's 16mm production of Julius Caesar, filmed in Chicago. Hunter soon left Chicago to enter graduate school at UCLA. He was discovered on the opening night of a UCLA production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons in May 1950, and signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox that same month. Just a few months later, Hunter met gorgeous actress Barbara Rush, and the couple married in December 1950.\n\nLEFT: Hunter with first wife Barbara Rush in the early 1950s. RIGHT: Hunter was briefly engaged to actress Sally Ann Howes in 1968\n\nThroughout Hunter's career, he was often cast in war films and westerns, at which he excelled. Careerwise, he hit is stride in the mid 1950s, starring in five big pictures including the westerns The Searchers (1956; with John Wayne), The Proud Ones (1956; with Robert Ryan), and Gun for a Coward (1957; with Fred MacMurray). Hunter also starred in Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase (1956; with Fess Parker and John Lupton) and the United Artists thriller A Kiss Before Dying (1956; with Robert Wagner and Virginia Leith).\n\nEarly in his film career, 20th Century Fox served up many beefcake photos of Jeffrey Hunter. The far right image includes fellow 20th Century Fox contract player Robert Wagner\n\nUpon leaving Fox in 1958, Hunter freelanced in many films at a variety of studios, including the Warner Bros. western Sergeant Rutledge (1960; with Constance Towers), the Allied Artists picture Hell to Eternity (1960; with David Janssen) and MGM's Key Witness (1960; with Dennis Hopper). Hunter starred as Jesus Christ in perhaps the biggest picture of his career, MGM's epic King of Kings (1961; with Viveca Lindfors). Inexplicably, Hunter's fortunes in Hollywood began to erode in the early 1960s. He began making films in Europe, as many other actors such as Lex Barker and Guy Madison had done. One of his earliest was the 1963 French/Italian co-production Gold for the Caesars (1963; with Mylene Demongeot and Ron Randell).\n\nthe films of jeffrey hunter\n\nFourteen Hours (1951)\n\nAt Fox, Hunter was often paired with beautiful Debra Paget, with whom he acted in five films.

O'Farrell, which also starred Bob Hope and Phyllis Diller\n\nlater years\n\nIn 1963 Hunter signed a two-year contract with Warner Bros., where he starred in the TV series Temple Houston. About 30 episodes of the hour-long western were filmed before the series was canceled in 1964. Hunter's 1963 film The Man From Galveston was originally the pilot episode of Temple Houston. And in late 1964, Hunter starred in Star Trek: The Cage, the first pilot episode for the NBC series Star Trek. The completed pilot never aired (until 1988), because NBC rejected the pilot and ordered a new one. Hunter opted out of the second pilot and returned to Europe and Asia to act in such films as the comedy A Witch Without a Broom (1967; with Maria Perschy) and the spaghetti western Find a Place to Die (1968).\n\nBarbara Rush and Hunter parted ways in 1955. Hunter remarried in 1957 to wife Joan and divorced again ten years later. After an engagement to actress Sally Ann Howes, Hunter married actress Emily McLaughlin in February 1969 following a whirlwind courtship. McLaughlin is best known for her role as Nurse Jessie Brewer on the ABC-TV soap General Hospital from 1963 through 1991. Sadly, Hunter passed away from a massive stroke after falling and fracturing his skull on May 27, 1969, at the age of 42. He was survived by his third wife, Emily McLaughlin (1928-1991), four sons, and a stepson, Robert Lansing Jr."
