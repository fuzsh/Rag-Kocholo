        "text": "Sweet Jesus...\n\nToday’s featured actor is one of those Hollywood casualties who held so much promise (and he did make about 50 films over two decades), but whose life was peppered with misfortune and was cut short, thus robbing him of the full status and fame due him. Possessing strong acting talent along with a warm, “boy next door” quality, yet having looks that would make a person sell his grandmother to cannibals in order to live next door to him, he could have and should have been a far bigger star than he turned out to be.\n\nHenry “Hank” McKinnies was born in Louisiana, but raised in Wisconsin where he studied theatre. He went to graduate school at UCLA, which is where he was spotted by two different talent scouts who swiftly offered the handsome, and very talented, young man motion picture contracts. He wound up signing with 20th Century Fox under the name he is known by: Jeffrey Hunter. At this stage, he was already married to a pretty, young starlet who was just beginning her own career. Wedlock with Barbara Rush, however, would only last five years.\n\nHe was immediately put to work on a small role in the film Fourteen Hours, which was about a desperate man threatening to jump from a high-rise window ledge. The film (not actually Hunter’s first as he had done two minor bits previously for other people) marked the debut of close to a dozen actors, including Grace Kelly, who would go on to notable careers. In an o dd twist of fate, the day the film was previewed, one of Fox’s chief execs, Spyros Skouras, lost his daughter to suicide in the same manner, prompting the film to be shelved for half a year.\n\nStill, Hunter was kept busy, first in The Frogmen (about men on a Naval underwater demolition team) in which he had a great, featured role as an injured man in danger of drowning, followed by other movies in varied genres including Red Skies of Montana, Belles on Their Toes, Dreamboat and Princess of the Nile. His stunning looks, particularly his ice blue eyes, made him especially striking in color films.\n\n1956 was an impressive year for Hunter because it’s the year he was loaned to Warner Brothers to costar with John Wayne in The Searchers, a revenge-western that was lauded upon release and has only gained in stature over the years. Hunter played the adopted, part-Indian, brother of a girl who’s been captured by a ferocious chief. Hunter held his own with Wayne as the pair battled it out onscreen over how best to retrieve the girl, played by Natalie Wood.\n\nFor inexplicable reasons, Hunter began being paired with the up and coming Robert Wagner, but receiving second-billing and secondary roles when he actually possessed far greater talent and more handsome features. It is likely that Wagner’s teen following (egged on by his fairytale marriage to Natalie Wood) had a hand in this. While the men suited each other on screen, even playing brothers in The True Story of Jesse James, the differences in their abilities fairly screams off the screen in films such as White Feather (in which Hunter’s eyes were covered with brown contact lenses and his face augmented with war paint, rendering him almost unrecognizable) and A Kiss Before Dying (later remade with Matt Dillon.)\n\nHunter continued to provide strong wo rk in many films, but often in support of another star, such as Robert Ryan in The Proud Ones, Fess Parker in The Great Locomotive Chase, Fred MacMurray in Gun for a Coward or Spencer Tracy in The Last Hurrah. A genial presence anyway, even in unsympathetic roles, perhaps he complimented the other actors so well that his own leading man potential was not fully trusted?\n\nOccasionally, as in The Way to the Gold and Count Five and Die, he would b e given top billing. Other times he would be featured in ensembles as he was in No Down Payment (which also starred his ex-wife Rush!) and In Love and War. The Searchers’ director John Ford, had thought enough of Hunter to use him in The Last Hurrah and then gave him the leading role in the controversial film Sergeant Rutledge, about the court-martial of a black soldier accused of raping and killing a white girl as well as killing her father.\n\nBy now, Hunter was finally recognized as leading man material, though he hadn’t really delivered a blockbuster or even a future-classic of his own. When director Nicholas Ray chose him in 1961 to portray Jesus Christ in King of Kings, the first time that Jesus’ face would be continually shown in a major Hollywood film, most critics balked. Some catty film columnists even referred to the movie as “I Was a Teenage Jesus” due to Hunter’s handsome, youthful and healthy good looks and as a derisive way of reacting to them. The truth is, even though Jesus was normally portrayed in an older way to that date, Hunter was in fact two years older than Christ when he was crucified. Typical of the idiocy of that time, preview audiences took offense to Hunter’s chest hair while on the cross (is this really what they gleaned out of the scene?!) and it had to be re-shot after he’d shaved it and his armpits.\n\nThis ludicrous and shameful criticism of Hunter’s thoughtful, reverent performance in a likewise beautiful and tremendously produced film led to box office disappointment. An epic film in the grand tr adition (those are real extras, folks on a real landscape!) featured eye-popping sets and costumes along with vivid supporting performances, notably from Robert Ryan as John the Baptist, Rip Torn as Judas and especially Rita Gam as Herod’s wife. The sublime music of Miklos Rozsa has also come to be recognized as classic. Poseidon is not even Christian and yet the film is watched every Easter here in The Underworld!\n\nFeature film-wise, Hunter hit a lean period after this and increasingly turned to tele vision. He starred in a western series called Temple Houston (about the son of legendary Sam Houston), but it only lasted a season. Upon its cancellation, Hunter was given the lead in a new sci-fi series pilot, an unusual little project known as Star Trek! (Ironically enough, the Temple Houston photo here shows him with Grace Lee Whitney, who would later appear on Trek, though not with him.)\n\nThe project concerned Captain Christopher Pike and his starship’s five-year mission to explore the unknown reaches of space. Hunter was handsome and virile in his role, but the network wanted another version of the pilot, one not as cer ebral in nature and with more action. Then married to former model Joan “Dusty” Bartlett, who wasn’t enamored of having a husband working in a then-sneered upon genre and having been advised to demand more money and to pursue films again, he wound up passing on the entire ball of wax. His pilot was later interpolated into a two-part episode of the series, which, of course, wound up starring William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk. Trek with Hunter would have been an altogether different show. Perhaps it would have been more serious and dramatic in tone, but then the magical chemistry of the eventual leads wouldn’t have been there and that is really what propelled it into an iconic show.\n\nIn any case, little film work came about and, before long, Hunter found himself working as a guest on more TV shows and eventually landing in Europe, headlining quite a few foreig n films. He was aged (rather unconvincingly) for a part in Custer of the West, which was filmed in Spain. Occasionally, he would find himself in an American film, though not in anything particularly prestigious. Bob Hope’s The Private Navy of Sgt. O’Farrell is far from the big time, but Hunter still looked terrific. Unfortunately, Mr. Hunter would be dead within a year.\n\nWhen Sherwood Schwartz was putting together The Brady Bunch, Jeffrey Hunter lobbied heavily to win the role of the father. In what is a tremendous head-scratcher, Schwartz declared that Hunter was “too good looking” to be an architect! Schwartz was paid back in spades for his attitude when he cast Robert Reed in the part and began what was a marathon of bickering, complaining and temper tantrums throughout the entire run of the series.\n\nSo, it was back to Europe again to make more features there. On Viva America!, a horrible chain of events began which would eve ntually cost Jeff his life. First, an on-set explosion injured his face. Then, a “friendly” sparring match with an old military friend resulted in him being clipped in the chin and, more importantly, hit in the head when falling backwards. On the way home to America, he suffered a stroke on the plane (while accompanied by his new wife, Emily McLaughlin, best known as Nurse Jessie Brewer on General Hospital and, no, I don’t get it either!) Once past that, he had another stroke at home and fell to the floor fracturing his skull and lying unconscious for some time. He never again came to after that, dying in the hospital at age 42. I was alerted to the charms of Jeffrey Hunter about six or seven years ago by a fellow movie buff who couldn’t get enough of him. I started paying attention to him myself and very quickly saw what the fuss was about. This guy could do anything. He played petulant Indian braves and erudite professors and assured cowboys with equal commitment. And those eyes… The world lost a true gem when he passed away at such an age. Fortunately, he did leave behind a sizeable body of work that can be enjoyed time and again, hopefully winning him new fans even now.\n\n\"The Concorde\" Takes a Dive\n\nIn the beginning, there was Airport, an A-list, ultra-slick adaptation of a best-selling book and a nominee for multiple Oscars (including Best Picture!) Then came Airport 1975 with a bit too much humor (intentional and unintentional) and Karen Black flying a damaged 747. Airport '77 next had a private plane sinking beneath the ocean while rich passengers dropped like flies.\n\nIn an inane attempt to continue the exploitation of the original, and superior, film (as well as cash in on the notoriety of the then-new Concorde, the fastest commercial plane ever), The Concorde: Airport ‘79 (was it necessary to alter the scheme of the films' titles every time?!) came along and ended the series. A year later, Airplane! would slam the coffin lid and seal it for good with it's hysterical sending up of the many clichés of the air-disaster genre. Thanks to the merciless idiocy of this film, it was almost redundant to parody the scenarios! Though I can't be certain, this also may have been the last of the \"box films,\" which prominently sold the all-star casts in a row of boxes on the movie's poster.\n\nHere, Robert Wagner (sometimes wearing the ugliest eyeglasses ever manufactured) is a high-pow ered industrialist who's been selling arms to enemies of the U.S. When his TV reporter mistress Susan Blakely is informed of this, he tries to have her killed. After she boards the Concorde en route to Moscow, he (ludicrously) decides to pull out every stop in the book to demolish the aircraft, even though it is full of Olympians, TV journalists, music legends, human organs and little old ladies who can't stay out of the bathroom!\n\nThe entire film is both stagnant and simultaneously uproarious at the same time. The director, writer, editor and the actors can't seem to get ANYTHING right! (See Blakely's ridiculously unconvincing newscast in which she never once looks into the camera, is situated in a cavernous, yet undecorated newsroom and in which clips from events AS THEY ARE HAPPENING IN REAL TIME parade across the screen as though they are parts of an edited news story.) The movie also contains some of the most abominable blue-screen and model special effects ever to be seen in a major studio film.\n\nThe cast of is huge and full of names, though most of them are given, literally, nothing to do but embarrass themselves. A dour Wagner looks very tired and hardly bothers to vary his facial expressions. Blakely works hard but is defeated by the stupidity of the character and the script. George Kennedy (the one actor who w as in all four films) is promoted to Captain this time after previously being seen as a mechanic and an administrative employee, but is reduced to cracking crude sexual jokes and (in the film's most celebratedly lunatic scene) cracking open the cockpit window in mid-flight and shooting off a flare! The flare in question is supposed to distract a heat-seeking missile, as if it could possibly be thrown off the course of a roaring supersonic jet by an activated distress signal. At one point, Ingmar Bergman protegee Bibi Andersson is lowered into having to do a love scene with the crass, burly man.\n\nFairly haggard former screen-god Alain Delon, as another pilot, tries to beat preposterous dialogue like, \"Your hair is my French fries\" in his affair with sex kitten stewardess Sylvia Kristel (whose calf-length uniform has a split up to her thigh! Previous costumer Edith Head wisely took a hike this time out and it shows.) Delon is never lit well enough to accent his once-amazing looks and Kristel, who was trying to attempt a film that didn’t feature her in the nude, can’t seem to effectively deliver even the most benign dialogue.\n\nOther oddities include Mercedes McCambridge spouting a dreadful Russian accent and flouncing around in curtain-like tops as an overprotective gymnastics (!) coach, Jimmie Walker as a pot-smoking saxophone player, Monica Lewis as a jazz legend who feels she may be losing it (we can vouch that she just might be even though Jennings Lang, the producer of this film and her husband, may think differently!), Dorito’s advertising stooge and comedic performer Avery Schreiber as a Russian coach with a deaf daughter (at least she doesn't have to hear Lewis awkwardly singin g along with Walker's sad sax!) and Polident spokeswoman Martha Raye as a grandma with a bladder control problem (What? Did June Allyson turn the part down?) Raye has the honor of having her last film contain scenes of her stuck in an airplane john which is coming apart and dousing her with water and who knows what else.\n\nSpecial mention must be given to the sidesplittingly fretful appearance of Cicely Tyson as a mother escorting a frozen heart, along with doctor Nicholas Coster, to her dying son. (Since when do parents go off and collect organs while their kid is expiring somewhere else? For that matter, since when do the doctors go and get them??) In an apparent attempt to disappear from this rancid film, she hides her face under every imaginable object. Already buried under what must be Victoria Principal's fright wig from Earthquake, she uses hankies, a clutch purse, blankets, ANYTHING to obscure her face from being seen, eventually turning away from the camera entirely! (Kathryn Grayson admitted to doing this in her final film The Vagabond King. She loathed her costar and hated the Paramount production values as compared to her former studio MGM and truly attempted to hide her face from the camera so as not to be spotted in her own movie!)\n\nThe endless, Fantasy Island-esque Concorde cast list also co ntains Eddie Albert as the airline owner and Sybil Danning as his trophy wife. Albert is charming and Danning gives one of the best performances in the film because she isn’t excruciatingly annoying as most of the rest are! Charo has a cameo as a pushy passenger attempting to stowaway a Chihuahua. John Davidson plays a sports reporter with the hots for Olympian Andrea Marcovicci, who gets another special mention.\n\nUnbelievably, she plays a twenty-four year-old gymnast (!) going for her third gold medal, wh ich is crazy enough except that she was thirty-one in real life! Just one more nutty aspect of this thoroughly stunted, unispired film. She and Davidson have a “cute” seduction scene that takes place in a training room whirlpool as McCambridge hovers nearby. Apparently, this sequence was so stunning that it warranted a vomitous six-part publicity photo detailing every stage of it for the viewer… Some asshole even numbered the photos as if no one could tell what order the blessed event took place in!\n\nPerhaps the most bizarre aspect of all is the fact that the plane goes through several traumas, spinning violently and nearly crashing as it is pursued by the missiles, yet, after a layover in Paris, vir tually every single passenger GETS BACK ON! The fun then continues as the plane is outfitted to start coming apart at the seams in midair. (All this rather than just shooting Blakely while she was off the vessel in Paris.) At least this part offers more laughs as dippy passengers groove out to a transistor radio (!) while the carpet is ripping at their feet and Albert discovers that he “has the best seat in the house.”\n\nAs if things weren't bad enough, the 1980 Olympics that were pushed so heavily in this movie wound up being boycotted that year by the U.S., so the whole film was outdated before it was even released anyway! Eventually, the makers realized the unintentional comedy of their screen excrement and started marketing it as such!"
