        "text": "November 1st, 2017\n\nDear Professor Harrison,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I understand that you’re a busy person so I’ll try to keep this brief. Hopefully my brevity will also prevent me from sounding too fawning or obsequious.\n\nThis is just to say thank you.\n\nI’m a (still young, still reaching) professional writer now, but I wasn’t always. Ten years ago I was an enlisted Infantryman deployed to Iraq. I was also a college dropout nurturing a flamboyant autodidact streak. We were allowed one large black plastic trunk to store our effects in and I packed mine full of books. Melville. Cervantes. Freud. Cicero. Genet. Mann. I dragged my precious box, roughly the size of a small coffin, around Baghdad and its environs like an amulet to ward off death. Or, maybe more accurately, as a reminder of something bigger and deeper than my own day to day experiences. Of the richness and variety of life itself.\n\nI don’t remember exactly when I first heard Entitled Opinions, but it must have been sometime in 2007. I didn’t need the box anymore afterwards. My chest full of literature shrunk down to my iPod. It was a logistical improvement, for sure, but it also resonated with the immediacy of living human voice, taking me even further away from “death’s dream kingdom”.\n\nThere was something else about elevated human conversation. Something not quite benign. Maybe it was something like an imperative or a challenge posed. “You must change your life”. If THIS – this searching and articulating and creating – was so dear to me, if I valued it above all else, then I had an existential imperative to live that out. I had to become myself.\n\nAfter the Army I moved to New York, worked in publishing for a spell (for Archipelago Books), then a few years ago settled down in Mid-coast Maine to write and write seriously. I’ve published essays and reviews (a few of which I’ll link to below) and I’m currently under contract to write a book for Zero Books. My accomplishments are modest, but not bad work for a kid from Missouri without a college degree. I pinch myself every day.\n\nI hope you’re able to accept the sincere gratitude of a perfect stranger. Your podcast and books have played such a profound role in my life that I struggle to articulate the depth of their influence. I struggle to comprehend the depth of their influence. Thank you.\n\nI won’t flatter myself by thinking that you’ll have the time or interest to read my clips, but I feel like it would be rude not to send a few along just in case.\n\nreview of ‘Miłosz: A Biography’: http://www.drb.ie/essays/at-home-in-exile\n\nvaporwave and irony: http://brooklynrail.org/2017/04/music/Attention-Online-Shoppers\n\nGaddis, Westworld, and mechanized art: http://www.full-stop.net/2017/04/19/blog/scott-beauchamp/his-masters-voice-is-calling-me/\n\ngraffiti in military latrines: https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/11/12/kilroy-is-still-here/\n\nreview of ‘David Jones’: http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/review-of-david-jones-engraver-soldier-painter-poet/\n\nIn gratitude,\n\nScott Beauchamp\n\nBath, ME 04530\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 30th, 2017\n\nDear Robert ,\n\nI met Sepp Gumbrecht at a conference in Moscow last week. I am a big fan of his writing, but the reason I finally decide to write to you is because the first thing I said to Sepp when I saw him smoking at the entrance to the venue was “I’ve been listening to you on Entitled Opinions, it was great, so many thanks!” And only then did I say: “I love your books, too.” And only then did we talk about writing and reading. But listening came first.\n\nThere is a reason for that: your show accompanied me through pretty stressful times of intense military and political conflicts in Israel, when heavy objects were falling from the sky on both sides of the border and people were saying pretty dreadful things about other people. Then, listening to your show served as a regular reminder that language and thinking can be life-saving, sometimes literally. Understanding ideas ultimately brings one to a better understanding of (other) people. The shows certainly helped me remain sane.\n\nWhen I was feeling lonely and, well, rootless and alienated in Vienna, listening to the show was like coming home. Sometimes I would listen to one program in little bits so that it would last me a week. It was brutal rationing, but necessary.\n\nHere in England, where the state bureaucracy is working hard to remind those of us who come from other countries that we are here, but “not quite, not really, not for long,” your show is a consolation in that it affirms, again and again, that true reflection, and true intellectual exploration, knows no borders, and that obstacles of any nature become experience when they are approached, and reflected upon, creatively. I haven’t written to say “thank you” before because I thought you’d be receiving so many emails and it would just be one more message in your inbox. But I understood from Sepp that you might still be open to receiving a “thank you.” So — thank you.\n\nBest wishes, and looking forward to more inspiring, exciting, life-affirming programs,\n\nNatalia\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 16th, 2017\n\nDear Professor Harrison,\n\nAfter all hours spent with “Entitled Opinions” in my headphones it sort of feels like I am writing an old friend. But we have never met, and sorry for finding your email online. I just wanted to send a big THANK YOU for all the hours of world-widening thought-provoking discussions. I found the podcast on iTunes via the Bolaño episode, and has been a fan ever since.\n\nI am a Swedish writer of novels and plays, based in Stockholm.\n\nBest,\n\nJonas Hassen Khemiri\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 15th, 2017\n\nDear Professor Harrison,\n\nI just wanted to thank you for your great radio program. I do enjoy it very much, and have subscribed to Entitled Opinions in ITunes U.\n\n“Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy without Entitled Opinions were food without spice.”\n\nCordially from Hamburg, Germany,\n\nReinhard Kunze\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 13th, 2017\n\nDear Robert,\n\nI am a long-time, extremely grateful devotee of Entitled Opinions.\n\nThe other night as I was browsing the philosophy section in the basement of the Strand bookstore. I couldn’t help but smile when I noticed where a stray copy of Gardens had come to rest. Robert Harrison fans sure are predictable.\n\nI cannot thank you enough for the more than a decade of thought and ideas you have fostered in me. I believe you will be remembered as an archetype of the 21st century public intellectual. Your commitment to sharing ideas and thinking is surpassed by no one in these most uncertain times.\n\nSimply, thank you!\n\nRyan\n\nNew York, NY\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 11th, 2017\n\nProfessor Harrison,\n\nMy name is Wesley Bishop, I am a PhD candidate in American history at Purdue University, and I just wanted to take a moment and let you know how much I love your show Entitled Opinions. Last year a friend of mine told me about it, and since then I have been working my way through this season and the older archived episodes on the website. I noticed that you mentioned in a few of the episodes that you appreciate hearing from listeners, so I thought I would let you know that your show is arguably one of the best and most thoughtful podcasts out there. I am eager to hear the new season, and simply wanted to write and thank you for producing such a high quality show dedicated to higher thought.\n\nKeep up the good work! And know you have an audience out here in the cornfields of Indiana. Thanks!\n\nWesley Bishop\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 10th, 2017\n\nDear Professor Harrison,\n\nI really enjoy your podcast and I am looking forward to some new episodes.\n\nI re-listened to your episode on fiction-writing programs because this fall I will be going to Columbia for an MFA in writing fiction. I know what you mean by narcolepsy for post-war American fiction. I think the most recently published novel that I consider a, for lack of a better description, first-rate classic is Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita. I have not yet given writers such as David Foster Wallace or Thomas Pynchon a try yet, but I have a hunch that they will not measure up to the great writers of earlier generations. In general, though, I do not think the novels coming out are doing many interesting things. This may partly be a result of the over-saturation of novels, there are so many it’s hard to know which are worth reading, but along with this I feel that the novels that get the most success or attention are novels made to be written into films.\n\nAlso, I hope Glass Wave releases another album. You’re all a talented group of musicians.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAustin Baker\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 26th, 2017\n\nDear Robert Harrison (Chevalier?),\n\nI hope you don’t mind me writing you. I understand you must be a very busy person.\n\nI am reaching out to you first of all because I have started listening to your podcast “Entitled Opinions” (about Life and Literature) voraciously. Somehow I came across this and I am addicted. I tried to comment on the page to share my pleasure in listening to it, but I couldn’t find a space to share that.\n\nSo I am writing you this email.\n\nI am a PhD candidate who has recently submitted her dissertation in the intersecting practices of poetry and dance. I chose to do creative and critical PhD, one that has an outcome of a book of visual poetry, a dance film and a 40 000 word critical commentary. I have an MA in Literature from The University of Toronto, a Diploma in Dance studies from Trinity Laban. I’m Canadian, but I have travelled widely and now live in The Netherlands.\n\nAs I read your profile page on the Stanford website, I am intrigued by the titles of books you’ve written, and I am interested in learning more about you both as a writer, an educator and a radio host.\n\nI have just begun listening to your conversation with Laura Wittman – I share your concerns about the study of literature and how we are so used to only speaking English. In my poetry, I bring in different linguistic play. I speak French and am learning Dutch, Irish and Italian.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nNancy E. Miller\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 16th, 2017\n\nDear Robert Harrison,\n\nI’m a long time Entitled Opinions listener from the UK. I first found the show when I was writing an essay on Hannah Arendt when I was a University student. I’ve been hooked on your unique and fascinating show since and listen via iTunes.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAdam Ditchburn\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSeptember 4th, 2016\n\nDear Robert Harrison,\n\nI want to thank you in a general way for “Entitled Opinions.: We have a six-month-old baby and there is no more time to read, so I spend my days pushing him around in a stroller and listening to your show. This is more than a matter of diversion or intellectual engagement. I’m a novelist; my job is to learn things. It’s curious to me that what I do with the things I learn is fit them into byzantine metaphorical systems in which knowledge is suspect or irrelevant, but in a way I have nothing to do with that. I am just the apparatus through which the knowledge passes. Restrict the flow and the whole thing rusts and falls apart. So: thank you!\n\nBest,\n\nAaron Thier\n\nDear Robert,\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAugust 31st, 2016,\n\nDear Robert,\n\nI greatly admire your show, as do several of my friends. If I ever make it to the US I’d love to discuss literature over coffee some time.\n\nBension Siebert | Journalist, InDaily\n\nSolstice Media\n\n4 Cinema Place, Adelaide, South Australia 5000\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAugust 5th, 2016\n\nDear Professor Harrison,\n\nThis is a fan letter from a colleague. (I’ve been at Stanford since 1985 and I’m not sure if we’ve met.) I knew about your program but never managed to catch it on KZSU. I discovered the podcasts only lately and I’ve become a dedicated follower — I usually listen when I walk between home and the office. Thank you so much for sharing your insights on such a wide variety of subjects, and the insights of our colleagues as well. Long may you continue!\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrad Osgood\n\nElectrical Engineering, Stanford\n\nPS I, too, am a musician. I play the trombone (that most romantic of all instruments, as I tell my wife) in a jazz band.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 4th, 2014\n\nDear Professor Harrison,\n\nI’m from Durban, South Africa and I listen to the podcasts of your show on the internet. They are incredible and insightful. You make Melvyn Bragg look like “a featureless cog” (Eichmann in Jerusalem, Hannah Arendt).\n\nWhat is the title of the song that you introduce you show with on Hegel with Adrian Daub?\n\nAlso, please do a show on Saul Bellow.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nDante\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMarch 28th, 2014\n\nI am so very happy to have Dr. Harrison’s show back on air. I am finally getting my oxygen in the barren and orthodox land of Pakistan where lunacy rules and religious fundamentalism along with brutal patriarchy destroys all the critical and creative potential in every thinking person.\n\nThanks a million for such a brilliant show.\n\nAll love,\n\nAqsa\n\nLehore\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMarch 28th, 2014\n\nListening to old shows whilst y’all are away is like re-reading old Homeric tales.\n\nGlad you’ve stuck your oar back in our ears.\n\nPeter Forbes\n\nWDC\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFebruary 20th, 2014\n\nA lack of Entitled Opinions had sharpened my senses –not destroyed –not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in Robert Harrison’s voice. I heard many things in Thomas Sheehan’s voice. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily –how calmly I can tell you the whole story.\n\nIt is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved Entitled Opinions. It had never wronged me. It had never given me insult. For Robert’s golden voice I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a Catskill Eagle –a gray eye, the keenest. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees –very gradually –I made up my mind that I must have more Entitled Opinions!\n\n. . . with credit (and apologies) to EA Poe, H. Melville and A. Bierce . . .\n\nI sure hope you all will be back soon . . . !\n\nStephen\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJanuary 22nd, 2014\n\nI listen and listen again\n\nAnd again still listening to\n\nThe light going on the\n\nFlicker growing into my\n\nAware-nesses, filling shadows\n\nWith light-nesses.\n\nDuring a prolonged illness, I listened to all of these podcasts some, many times.\n\nI found your program while looking for more info about Dante, now I’m anxious for the new show anxious for the next shot of energy.\n\nThank You\n\nGary\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJanuary 11th, 2014\n\nDear Professor Harrison\n\nThis is indeed a classic case of long time listener and first time caller. I have listened to almost every episode, many of them twice, and have found myself at various times wishing I could be in the studios to weigh in with my own, albeit not full entitled, opinion. Some day I will write a longer letter, no doubt, for now, let me say what a service you have done having this show on the air and available online.\n\nLike many listeners, I have my own list of topics and authors I would like to hear discussed on the show, but one in particular that I think would be unique for the program and encapsulate almost 500 years of history, literature, social movements and philosophy, a topic that Shakespeare dwelled on constantly, I am talking about none other than, syphilis.\n\nThere’s a lot of directions such a show could take, all of them would no doubt contain a good amount of uncomfortable laughter. And I already have part of your intro prepared. A quote from Flaubert, from his Dictionnaire des ides recues, wherein he defines syphilis as: “Plus ou moins, tout le monde en est affecte.”\n\nKeep up the good work and I look forward to reading your next book (which you mentioned on the Fuller show).\n\nPete Marshall\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOctober 26th, 2013\n\nDear Professor Harrison\n\nThis is just a short note of thanks to you for your wonderful show, Entitled Opinions. I relish the depth and range of topics you cover, and especially enjoy your introductions each week. I have many suggestions for future topics for your programme, but here’s one: I would love to hear you discuss William Blake. Keep up the good work.\n\nChris\n\nSurrey, UK\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSeptember 9th, 2013\n\nHi Robert\n\nBig fan of the show – listening from Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nI would sincerely like to request a show on Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nI’ve been listening to his biography on audiobook while reading\n\nhis essays and I think his life and writings would make for a great\n\nshow on Entitled Opinions.\n\nRegards,\n\nMarlowe__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJuly 17th, 2013\n\nHello Robert.\n\nI only recently came across Entitled Opinions (via podcast The Partially Examined Life) but have been listening to you and your guests non-stop for the last three days. At work. Mowing cemetery-lawns. The time flies, AND I’d like to think I learn a thing or two. Thank you!\n\nThe match-factor for your show is eerie: I study comparative literature at the University of Gothenburgh [currently using the antiquated archetypal criticism-theory for my master’s thesis, and wrote my very first lit.-thesis on Ezra Pound’s Pisan Cantos no. 81]; no formal philosophy-training but a budding amateur interest in the history of philosophy [hoping to one day be a Heideggerian;)]; huge progressiv-rock fan during my formative years [w/ special love for Gentle Giant]. Check, check, check!\n\nNeedless to say, keep up the good work! And if I may add a request: Please consider doing a few shows on different “schools” of literary theory/criticism – critically of course, knowing how sceptical you are of lit.theory – using the pool of talent you have at your disposal at Stanford. Survey of the latest trends; past & future classics of literary theory & literary criticism; broad historical over-view, etc. (Another, oh, say six-ten episodes with Marjorie Perloff would do just fine!)\n\nDaniel G.\n\nGöteborg, Sweden\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJuly 7th, 2013\n\nConvey my thanks to Robert for all of his shows over the years, but particularly for the recent show with Thomas Sheehan on Heidegger (on technology)\n\nIt’s quite heartwarming to hear such a principled and dare I say gentlemanly exchange of conflicting views and tastes. The result was illumination rather than heat, a rare commodity indeed.\n\nI particularly appreciate being directed to the Heidegger that will fill my being and occupy my time profitably.\n\nAnd thanks to Robert for directing me to Arendt, whom I’ve sadly neglected all these years.\n\nBrian B\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJuly 3rd, 2013\n\nDear Robert,\n\nCompliments to you. Your capacity to change your mind in the course of discourse is an admirable thing that most radio hosts can’t boast of. I really enjoyed your show with Michael, speaking as one of the hopeful souls who put in a request for Wallace back in . . . January 2010!\n\nI was thrilled to hear Michael’s original claims about Infinite Jest, and I’d love to read her dissertation, if you don’t mind conveying that message to her or putting her in touch with me.\n\nI still don’t think Wallace is a great fiction writer, but scaling (not w/out sweat or tears) Infinite Jest changed my life. I used to be a person whose Interests flag and attentions ebb with incredible ease; I used to be a slave to my phone and the internet. I thought I got better because of the persuasive ideas in the book about paying attention, and so it was an epiphany for me to hear Michael say that reading the book itself was a antidote, certainly another reason why I felt a change. In retrospect, I was indeed working out my attention endurance. “Project fiction.” I like it.\n\nThanks for the show.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJed\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 13th, 2013\n\nDear Robert,\n\nI so loved your discussion of DFW with Michael Hoyer. Wallace is an artist I’ve always wanted to embrace wholeheartedly, steadfastly; however, upon final examination, I find his fiction jumbled and rife with (soft?) impenetrability… As a reader, I am half a generation removed from his thought. I can’t speak to his struggle with addiction as I think it was possibly the secret thread that coursed though his world view. I believe it is what he really(?) wanted to write about. Biochemical manifestations are utterly personal and ultimately, profoundly private (in an Arendtian way). Your mindfulness of Heidegger yields an elegant sense in your hesitation toward considering DFW the great writer as per Hoyers suggestion. Thank you for your skepticism….\n\nAll best,\n\nRob W, Brooklyn, NY\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 29th, 2013\n\nProf. Harrison:\n\nYou do not know me but I am a huge fan of your podcast. I believe I have listened to (nearly?) every one. I know from past shows that you are not a big fan of the cinema but I think there are certain topics that would be perfectly suited for your show. One that immediately comes to mind is the work of Stanley Kubrick. With the the advent of the internet along with the recent release of “Room 237” what was once considered nonsense fringe analysis has made its way into the main stream (like so many other things..Tea Party anyone?). I would love to hear someone who actually knows what they’re talking about delve into this brilliant artist’s work. I am not sure if you are aware of this or not, but Kubrick was tremendously inspired by Nietzsche and his philosophy infuses much of Kubrick’s work. I can’t help but think of his films as being tailor made for discussion on your show.\n\nAgain; thank you so much for your podcast. It is one of the greatest teacher I’ve ever had.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid W\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 27th, 2013\n\nHi Robert,\n\nAfter listening to your latest program on Heidegger for a third time, I realized that if I didn’t respond to the discussion in some way, I would be lost in an infinite re-listening loop. The program’s subject has been on the top of my mind since the bizarre public offering of Facebook.\n\nAt the end of the discussion I understood you to say something to the effect that the point of commoditization (in Heidegger’s theory) had to be more than the profit motive. I agree. Commoditization might be the way nature reveals itself to us, but the way that we understand the revelation is through monetization. Monetheism is the great unified theory of the postmodern world and is not about profit in the common sense of the word. I would propose that monetization is very much how and why we turn our gaze from our finitude (stopping at the Here and Now, which are what I understand to be Heidegger’s two conditions for being “human” and the foundation of an ethic).\n\nFacebook, LinkedIn, Twitter have also revealed to us that human relations can be commoditized and monetized. In the digital age, anything can be consolidated into rich commodity pools, and understood (in the way it seems humans have decided to understand the world) through monetization. And once monetized, we order and sort everything, everything on the CBOE, NYSE, NASDAQ, etc. The Matrix of blinking lights tells the single story of all things. Anything pulled out of the earth or out of someone’s mind (except perhaps the Humanities) will eventually be commoditized and take its place on the big board.\n\nYou want understanding? Listen to Bloomberg or CNBC for 24/7 sermons on understanding the entire scope of human endeavor. Jaime Dimon (pronounced demon) and Lloyd Blankfein are the Philosopher Kings of Heidegger’s modern technology.\n\nBut I embarrass myself,\n\nA grateful listener.\n\nBill\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 24th, 2013\n\nBravo Robert!\n\nYou were very brave to outline your thoughts on animal husbandry. Every sensitive, thinking human must agree with you; yet we can never collectively acknowledge the truth.\n\nI am a young man who grew up in the city. I searched, and practiced and found myself. I have committed my future to developing a small organic blueberry farm near Whistler, British Columbia. I have a true wife, and now two sons. We took in three goats, two pygmy sisters and a younger but normal-sized male. We had a complicated cousin in Whistler, he hanged himself. The young horned goat was outgrowing the girls, outgrowing their pen, and outgrowing my wife and baby. Our rough friend had always wanted to eat this goat, so, for his wake we resolved to provide young Sigmund for the spit. I have not been a hunter, and had never undertaken something like this before. But with the help of his best friend, another wild Quebecer of the bush, I led Sigmund away from the girls after dark, out into my raw field. I wrestled him to the ground and I slit his throat. We tied his ankles and hung him from the bucket of my tractor, we skinned him and dressed him and wrapped him in plastic, all with the best and most profound design. And in the gory darkness of that night, I was struck, as by a laser, that this was the original sin of humanity: raising an innocent being in slavery with the express intent of slaughtering it for consumption.\n\nI could never exactly comprehend original sin in the contexts of sex, or of knowledge; that night I understood that animal husbandry is the defining act that expells mankind from the garden of species.\n\nI still eat meat too, but less than before, and I’m more discerning about it’s origins. I feel that the memory of hot blood on my hands keeps me a little more honest about it. And, though I haven’t in the past felt sufficiently thankful for my own sustenance to say a grace before meals, after listening to your recent show, I pledge now to speak some acknowledgement every time I eat the flesh of another.\n\nI have to say however, that, as much as I do agree with you, I feel you argued your monologue from the stance of someone who is more or less comfortably fed. It struck me that hunger must be considered, as it leads to desperation, innovation, etc.\n\nAnd then I thought: what a fascinating concept to explore in one of your shows – “Hunger”\n\nCheers, I can’t tell you how much I value your show (that would be boring 🙂\n\nJD Hare\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 20th, 2013\n\nHi Robert,\n\nExcellent show with some really good podcasts. This is especially true for a black letter Mexican lawyer like myself who does not encounter much independent and creative thinking.\n\nToo often in life we do not take time to really think about life and think about the world we live in. Entitled opinions provides an escape hatch from the confines of my life. It is my hidden pleasure, my secret mistress and my hour away from work and family. Every Sunday with a bourbon in one hand and a cigar in the other I sit back and listen to your show. This is my time. I especially love the episodes on God and the supernatural with Dr Luhrmann and the really excellent podcast by Dr Kayali on Bioethics.\n\nKeep up the excellent show,\n\nCarlos\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear Robert,\n\nCongratulations on launching and going thru what will certainly become another successful term for Entitled Opinions. It has been great to start receiving the EO signals again. I am getting the goose skin each time the EO signature tune starts and Robert’s voice breaks the air. And I also know you take courage from the fact that the EO brigade is tuning in.\n\nI have very much enjoyed all the shows this year–particularly the Fuller monolog, Darwin show and the most recent one on Kafka. The latter has particularly resonated with me–as a citizen of Prague for 10 years, I walked thru streets that had some relation to Kafka’s life and that of his family–some real and some imagined by the tourist industry. I recall, without knowing at the time who he was, grabbing one of his books with hope to learn more about Prague and the Czechs–I had to assume that they will be very much featured in his work, similarly to Kundera, Skworecky, Klima and other Czech writers’ novels. I was surprised that Kafka’s narrative was all taking place only in his head, and by the end of the book in my head as well–so much that I could not stand it anymore. He took me deeper into the world of hopelessness than I ever was willing to go.\n\nWhile your EO crew was regrouping, I went thru some older shows and got hooked on Tomas Sheehan. I have previously liked his shows on Heidegger – he could talk about complex philosophical concepts in a way that were helping me to better understand my own thrownness in the world. After I have discovered your conversations on Jesus and religion, I also downloaded his “Historical Jesus” Stanford lectures. I have found his unique view on history and unorthodox approach to religion very refreshing and educational.\n\nI am also looking forward to hearing more about Robert’s new book to which you had devoted time free from the show, and eventually getting to read it. I think there was a mention of the book on the first show this year, and the promise to get into more details later.\n\nStaying tuned – always wondering what will come next from you.\n\nSasha\n\nPS, I also wanted to mention to Robert that on my professional side, I am working on a project run by the Turkish government — they want to get a tablet computer to every school child in Turkey. You may have noticed that Erdogan stopped by Palo Alto last weekend with his whole family — his ambition is to turn Turkey into 10th biggest economy in the world. With respect to the tablet project, I am trying to argue to their govt that unless technology comes with the strong academic curriculum, getting a tablet to schoolchildren does not accomplish anything in particular when it comes to studies and results.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFor obvious reasons, I e-thumbed back a couple of years in the Entitled archives to the June 2010 episode on The Doors. Sad as the occasion was that prompted this, I was glad I did so because my 18 year old daughter has just finished her first year at a performing arts school and came out with good questions and puzzles on her mind about visual, musical and textual inter-relationships. She is not getting her allowance until she listens to Robert’s brilliant reflections on the collective essence of The Doors. A belated thanks for this.\n\nPS. The session on Kafka likewise was a visit into territory I thought I was very familiar with, but understand a lot better thanks to Robert and Amir.\n\nNorman from Northern BC\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 19th, 2013\n\nMy 2 cents on the essayistic character of nature. It seems to connect to some of the things I‘ve been thinking lately. I assume nature cannot be essayistic without an observer. Humans know that best from our own experience with our own creativity.\n\nFirst being essayistic probably lies at the root not just of nature but of our being as humans. And it could very well be the reason for what Heidegger called man‘s uncontrollable drive to technicity. And that is responsible for the gloomy prospects of our civilization.\n\nAnd then our obvious freedom to make our own mistakes looks to me like one of the better proofs for the existence of god.\n\nRemember the show on cosmology where we heard that (in my words) a witnessing consciousness is the precondition for the big bang to actually happen. We might call this witness god. Given our inability to conceive of a beginning we might just as well revert to the traditional term.\n\nWe know this from watching little kids – and ourselves. Our creativity and development (essayistic nature) depends a lot on at least imagining the presence of a witnessing consciousness. So there seems to be no essayism without this presence of an observer.\n\nBut then there is the question of the benevolence of this whole set up.\n\nAt least I think that love is directed at someone‘s autonomy. But autonomy not in the sense of a state of independence but rather as a functioning in a state of inner and outer integration.\n\n„God‘s love“ of our essayistic nature however might be of a rather disengaged sort. If her or his love shows in letting us (or nature) make our own mistakes the downside of this is that this includes mistakes in the dimension of a holocaust, the extinction of races and the ultimate end of our world. If it is love, it is not directed at us as individuals, not even species, but at the essayistic faculty in nature itself. Which means anything might happen to us or our loved ones.\n\nFinally: What about the benignity of our own essayism?\n\nI‘m not very happy with the way Robert introduced original sin in the first show on Enlightenment. It is obvious that we as a species cannot be trusted, but why?\n\nThe concept of sin can be seen as a pre-psychological concept to grapple with the question why we do not do what we want to do and do things that we don‘t want to do. That is: We have a moral consciousness that differentiates what we want and do from what we „really“ want and „really“ should do. The concept of sin measures the gap between the two.\n\nBut what is original about it? How does the trouble really start? Psychologically I am with psychoanalyst Arno Gruen here. That our „essays“ frequently end up in horrors has everything to do with how we developed our human nature – in culture.\n\nThe standard take on this that we can hear from educators and presidents of constitutional courts is: We have to cultivate our nature, be civilized in order to overcome the problematic drives of our nature.\n\nThat really is a laugh. (Or as Robert sometimes says: You – cannot – be – serious!)\n\nA fleeting glance on nature reveals that the power of destruction we find in animals is nowhere near our highly cultured faculties. (Talk about refining vices – 2nd show on Enlightenment) If we could forget our cultures and live again like animals the world would be a safer place. Actually it would have a chance to survive that it hasn‘t today.\n\nThe problem with our essayistic nature is not so much that our nature was evil (original sin) but that our state of mind is so unstable.\n\nOur mind, our consciousness, is one of nature‘s especially audacious essays. How this experiment ends is altogether unclear. And it might as well end the experiment on this planet altogether.\n\nOur mind is not so much a state but a perpetually open question. The self is the process of constantly having to answer it.\n\nThe problem is that our mind enables us to disconnect from our bodies, emotions, sensations, so that it is everybody‘s own-most task to figure out the relation between his thinking and „herself“ oder „himself“. Or with anything else. (The german anthropological philosopher Helmuth Plessner called this: man‘s ex-centric positionality. Plessners approach was drowned out by Being and Time which appeared shortly afterwards.)\n\nWe can look at ourselves with the eyes of a stranger.\n\nWhich brings us back to love and autonomy as integration. Charles Taylor says that we depend on God‘s unconditional love – agape, neighborly love. And he suspects that our capacity for this was not sufficient without the support of a belief in God.\n\nGiven the highly unpersonal character of the divine love that I touched on above I would rather say, that what we depend on as humans is not so much something like being infused by a love that we otherwise couldn‘t come up with in ourselves – but something more like resonance.\n\nWe have to have our souls touched. And if that happens we resonate with love. (As long as we are not too fucked up already as a lot of people are.)\n\nAnd all goes well. The witnessing consciousness again. But this time not just as an impartial, detached, disengaged divine observer but as something more integrated with us.\n\nWe have to feel – didn‘t Heidegger write something to that effect? – that what we deal with looks back at us.\n\nLooks like these thoughts turned out as billion-dollar-bills rather than 2 cents – but in a highly inflationary currency that doesn‘t seem to buy much anymore these days. Nevertheless it seems that is what I feel entitled to.\n\nMichael G.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 15th, 2013\n\nQu’ils mangent le poulet!\n\nWhen asked what he thought about Entitled Opinions, JFK famously replied:\n\n“I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the studios of KZSU, with the possible exception of when Robert Harrison delivers a monologue.”\n\nI concur and hold up the latest monologue on Animal Rights (5-8-2013) as “Exhibit A”. Thought-full and -provoking and challenging to both the listener and Professor Harrison himself. Inspired, I’m going back to have yet another listen to:\n\n“A Post-Avian Epilogue on Consumerism and the Earthly Paradise” (mentioned in the above monolgoue)\n\nand\n\n“The Earthly Paradise – An Epilogue”\n\n. . . because Odysseus has been on my mind.\n\nThank you both for the work you do!\n\nStephen McD\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 26th, 2013\n\nDear Robert,\n\nThis podcast is simply wonderful, it wouldn’t be possible to express how much enjoyment and intellectual pleasure it has brought me, all I can say is thank you. Rather than continuing the tradition of suggesting general topics or figures for discussion, I have a specific faculty member in mind: Sianne Ngai from Stanford’s English Department. Her work is fascinating, and the two of you could discuss her thoughts on moods and aesthetics, that would be right in your wheelhouse. The show on Darwin was great, I’m thrilled that another season has begun. Here’s hoping there are many more to come. I’ll be listening!\n\nBest regards,\n\nMadhava M\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMarch 27th, 2013\n\nDear Mr. Harrison,\n\nMy name is Michael G, 52, living in Frankfurt, Germany. By profession I am a judge in custodian law (dealing with all sorts of mental illnesses of people who need help or even some sort of governance by a custodian). I am a supporter of the Freie Schule Frankfurt, which grew out of Germanys first “anti-authoritarian” kindergarden (kind of like Summerhill as a day school for kids between 3 and 13).\n\nAnd (you guessed right) I am a fan of Entitled Opinions. I am deeply grateful to what you do and your presentation of so many things that are dear to me.\n\nHere is something, that I am breeding over for some time, and that I want to give you back as food for thought.\n\n(Wayne Shorter, in a recent interview, said that he felt grateful to Life and wanted to give something back. But what can you give back to Life? “Life has everything”. His answer – very typical, bless him – “Originality”.)\n\nNow here is what I want to give back to you.\n\nI suggest to extend Heidegger’s notion, that I am very fond of, that things tend to withdraw themselves and can therefore only be disclosed in part – to extend this notion not only to things, as you discussed it with Andrew Mitchell, but also to ourselves, our selves to be more exact. To our sexuality, to our self-images, and especially to our autonomy and sense of self-determination. You might even (if you like – I do) derive a sense of holiness from this, that our autonomous thrivings share.\n\nCheers\n\nMichael G\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMarch 3rd, 2013\n\nDear Dr. Harrison,\n\nI love Entitled Opinions. But let me introduce myself first. My name is Sara Jane. I’m 20 now, but have been listening to Entitled Opinions since I was 16. I have to say your conversations and monologues have inspired and shaped my approach to the humanities, and greatly influenced my choice of university. As you maybe can tell from my email address, I go to NYU in New York, but I began my education with NYU in Florence. It was only after returning from Italy last May that I realized your specialty was Italian studies, and Dante in particular! I’m not sure how I went on listening to EO for so long without knowing that but I think I began to pay more attention after living in Florence and becoming more or less obsessed with everything Florentine. How lucky! But I suppose it isn’t surprising, after all, since Florence was and has been the most compact urban epicenter of the humanities anywhere in the world. Anyway, I hope you never stop creating new Entitled Opinions (although I see the stanford website says you’ve been on leave since autumn 2012) because they’re wonderful and I love them! I’m working on a project now about theater in Italy and your Commedia dell’Arte post was a very happy discovery.\n\nThank you thank you thank you for putting something intelligent and free on the itunes!\n\nAll the best,\n\nSara Jane\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear Dr. Harrison,\n\nI hope and wish that this email finds you well. My name is Aqsa and I am writing to you from Lahore, Pakistan. Thanks to the internet that we can actually express our gratitude and complements to the people we like. I have been listening to the podcast of Entitled Opinions for past one month and I assure you that I am literally drawn into it.\n\nI have been doing Radio almost all my teen and in the early twenties now l am a lecturer at a university here and teach Literary Theory, Classics of World Literature and Cultural Studies. Along with that I am working on some research projects some of which include, a translation of a very prolific Urdu writer’s work, A paper on English Creative writing by Pakistani writers and The Study of Heroic Archetype in some of great Greek Literature. I would love to share some of this work if you’d like to have a look. ( Particularly to have your expert feedback) and would love to meet you in person if I get a chance to do my PhD in US.\n\nYour program is one of its kind and I learn a lot from your conversation on various subjects. I loved the programs that you did on Lolita, Pink Floyd, Hegel, Yeats and Phenomenology. And there is a whole range of them that I am listening to every day. I wonder why I didn’t come across this program before. Probably because I was not using Apple back then.\n\nStay blessed and thank you so much for producing such a program. I am truly grateful to be able to write to you. And I hope to meet you one day and share views on the subjects of mutual interests,\n\nHope to hear from you,\n\nRegards,\n\nAqsa\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFebruary 5th, 2013\n\nDear Professor Harrison,\n\n>\n\n>my name is Karla K, I come from the Czech Republic.

Some five years ago in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, I came to EO to learn more about Rorty, stayed, and cultivated a deep and abiding interest in the worlds of Dante, Stevens, and Ammons, among others.\n\nI went on to earn a Humanities B.A. (Univ. of Louisville) in part by explicating works such as La Vita Nuova and “Corsons Inlet”, then moved to Washington to contribute as an intern for The New Republic magazine.\n\nNow I’m in Kansas City, Missouri, where I moved to be with my girlfriend. I’m unemployed, applying to graduate programs, and slowly learning the Italian language. And I must politely urge you, sir, to resume the show! I suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder (as many do), and when I’m enduring a typical bout of poor reading comprehension, I find EO unmatched as an intellectually rewarding alternative.\n\nI wish you all the best, Dr. Harrison. Perhaps after I finish my M.A. I will be admitted to Stanford’s Italian program. Here’s hoping!\n\nSincerely,\n\nSimon M\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNovember 30th, 2012\n\n>Dr Harrison:\n\n>\n\n>I enjoy your podcasts immensely.

It is exasperating, not being able to consciously know how one feels and why, and it engenders a destructive, corrosive internal turmoil, initially out of pure frustration and defeat, which then transforms into a feeling of guilt-guilt of perceiving these injustices, these problems, that enable one to recognize what you talk about, when everyone else seems to be content and grateful and happy; guilt of contemplating about oneself so intently, and therefore about others and the world when one feels as if one has no right or knowledge even to think about such abstract things; guilt of being discontent with authority when everyone else criticizes and complains about it but eventually assumes the same role.\n\nNo, I do not sound like this in person-I really do not know what I sound like, my voice is still in flux, unconsolidated and restlessly wandering and searching, trying to experience beyond this invisible mold I was born into, and to gradually overcome the power exerted on my thoughts and actions. Many will probably think it silly that I even feel this way because I have the most ordinary life in the most ordinary circumstances. I am not too old, a college student in South Korea. I have spent more of my life in the United States, and Korean colleges are no friendlier to genuine intellectual thinking than are the suburbs of New Jersey. If anything though, because Korea is so highly concentrated and aggregated, in almost every way-the economy, education, politics, the people-some of the phenomenon are more apparent. Numbers definitely lack the ability to capture the complexity of human beings-high GDP, high standardized test scores, high enrollment numbers to Ivy League schools, et cetera et cetera-it is a country obsessed with the exterior, the superficial, yet it has completely lost internal, and I hate to use this word, but moral, direction. There are so many deep contradictions, abuses and injustices in this country, yet everyone is too busy trying to race forward, blindly, ruthlessly, tearing each other apart and it is becoming an intellectual, moral wasteland. But aside from the fact that it is a concentration, and a conspicuous case of this type of tragedy, humans, at least from what I have seen and read and experienced in my short life, seem so similar regardless of this man-made label of nationality. But I think it best if I not be too specific here, because I think I can argue the contrary while still keeping the overall idea intact. If I had expressed any of this while I was in the US, people probably would have thought that I was odd because I was “Korean,” and if I express it here, people would probably think I am odd because I am from “the States.” Maybe this is why I keep silent.\n\nAnyway, when I first came across Foucault in a scholarly article, everything felt right. It struck me and I felt free, like I was not alone in seeing the world in such a way, that someone was able to organize how I felt so brilliantly and eloquently (though I am in no way claiming that I am now “enlightened,” for I am still narrow minded, and I have only started to taste philosophy and literature in between my other obligations–though, increasingly, I find myself unable, unwilling to deny this aspect more and more–and I still feel the same as I did before I started reading philosophy in many ways). I had been immersed in Hugo, Bronte, and so on sporadically since I was young (although I always tried to deny this and concentrate on my “real life”), but through Foucault, Socrates (Plato), Dostoyevsky, Schopenhauer, Kant, Thoreau (but only one or two books by each so far) I was able to see literature in an entirely different way-as if philosophy connected the world of literature and my reality. Thoreau, Dostoyevsky and other thinkers that I have been influenced by are more writers than philosophers, but great minds are great minds beyond any one specific discipline or genre (the idea of which draws me to the poets whom you talk about). And finally, I felt like I was living “deliberately.” And Nietzsche, Nietzsche. I am not ready to talk about him, because I have only read a couple of his works as well, and I am not quite sure what happened when I read him last year, but I know I must learn German to hear his genuine, or at least the closest to his genuine, voice (and I cannot describe the excitement–the elation and sublimity–I felt when I heard you talk about him in the manner that you do after I found your program). I have so much I want to learn and experience and read, and I know this appreciation for literature has developed in me pretty late, but your show has given me immense hope that passion for knowledge does not have to be strictly for the academia, that it can be applied to life in general. Your show has expanded all of your listener’s scope immensely, and though I still do not study literature or philosophy in college (yet) due to personal circumstances, listening to your program has allowed me to embrace the intense passion for them, instead of feeling guilty about it, and instead of straying away from philosophy because of the analytic trend of the overall discipline. I always felt as if I did not even deserve to read these works but now I no longer think about that.\n\nI really don’t know how much your program has influenced me because everything-Entitled Opinions, books, experiences, personal interactions-worked simultaneously over a couple months (I stumbled upon Entitled Opinions last spring while I was searching for Foucault on iTunes University), but I am sure it has had a profound affect on me in incomprehensible ways, expanding and deepening my perspective on literature and philosophy and a lot of other things. I started to listen to the episode on Foucault, and had to stop because I felt like I had found some kind of hidden treasure, could not believe I had stumbled on something so precious, and I was overwhelmed with the same sense of liberation, freedom, genuine happiness and intellectual stimulation that I experienced when I read him. I stopped that particular episode and I subscribed to the whole corpus immediately, listening to every single Entitled Opinions episode over a span of a couple months, and it has become the one of the most valuable and penetrating sources of light amid the suffocating intellectual darkness that I am living in–and not just because of the content and the topics, but because of your own philosophy behind the show, and your dedication to the democracy of knowledge, in the most beautiful sense, in a time when scholars opt to hide behind their books or modern sophists abuse knowledge purely for economic reasons. (Have you heard of Internet lectures, not by professors, but by “lecturers”? I am overgeneralizing, but they have replaced high school and college education in Korea because of the broken public and the private education system, where, though I am largely overgeneralizing again, only a small fraction of professors genuinely care about what they do. There are, no doubt, brilliant professors here in Korea, undeserving of the system they are trapped in, but to the vast majority of any leader, be it political, scholarly, legal, business, or otherwise, only the exterior matters. The most disturbing thing is that because of this facade of “success” and “modernity,” this international recognition of being an “economic miracle,” we as a nation are completely unaware that we are so entirely foolish. But again, I am not criticizing this nation per se, but just lamenting about us as a human species in general.)\n\nAll this-I don’t quite know what to call it-is still deeply a personal endeavor and I am reluctant to express anything in words, especially to you, but I have finally caught up with the 2012 episodes and the one on Foucault, which started this all, and wanted to express my deep, genuine appreciation for everything you have done. The way the world breathes amazes me-how a student in Korea can read Foucault, a French philosopher, in English, and have the sudden whim to look him up on iTunes a couple years later while listening to a political philosophy lecture on iTunes University (which exposed me to Hana Arendt, whom I was able to become more acquainted with through your program, though I have yet to read any of her works), and how a single inadvertent click could lead one to Entitled Opinions. I wish I could have said all of this in a way that sounded more like myself, but my voice is just starting to become conscious of itself. I hope to write to you again when does find itself, if it does, but for now, thank you for sharing your soulful, nuance, passionate, sophisticated, intellectual, and most gratefully, genuine, voice on literature, philosophy, history, music and so much more.

I am\n\n>just writing you to thank you for your show Entitled Opinions. I\n\n>stumbled across your show at the beginning of the summer via the\n\n>iTunesU podcast app. I believe I had done a search for Heidegger and\n\n>one of your podcasts came up. I must say at first I was kind of put\n\n>off by the theme music (this was an old episode so it was the track\n\n>by Enigma, not the tune by your band) and your opening monologue,\n\n>but I gave it a shot and listened anyway. Over the course of the\n\n>summer, I believe I listened to every single episode of your show\n\n>that is available online (which I assume is all of them). Entitled\n\n>Opinions has been a constant companion over the past few months of\n\n>my life.\n\n>\n\n>This summer was my last summer living in the Washington D.C. area,\n\n>which is where I grew up. I have just moved to NYC for graduate\n\n>school. It has been a very intense time of reflection and memory,\n\n>nostalgia and projection into my future. The topics on your show\n\n>have intensified and enriched that experience immeasurably.\n\n>\n\n>Were I to attempt to comment on each of the shows that had an impact\n\n>on me, this email would be dissertation length. However I will say\n\n>that I really appreciate your treatment of figures in the history of\n\n>Continental Philosophy with seriousness and rigor, something which\n\n>is sorely lacking in mainstream Anglo-American academia. I suppose\n\n>this is why so many people turn to literature departments in order\n\n>to study actual philosophy, because the philosophy departments don’t\n\n>teach it. Additionally I have loved your historical and literary\n\n>episodes, as well as the shows on religion and music. I feel like by\n\n>listening to your show, I have become aware of so many holes in my\n\n>cultural education. Rather than a cause for dismay, it is a cause\n\n>for celebration. To borrow a Heideggerian trope, each episode has\n\n>disclosed worlds.\n\n>\n\n>I also want to thank you for your repeated attention to Hannah\n\n>Arendt. I must confess beyond knowing her name, the title of some of\n\n>her books, and some basic biographical details, I knew very little\n\n>about her until listening to your two part episode on her. As an\n\n>incoming New School philosophy student it would have been a real\n\n>shame had my interest in her work remained so rudimentary. Listening\n\n>to the way you discussed her life and work and particularly the\n\n>audio clip you shared of her speaking really inspired me to learn\n\n>more about her, and in turn has made me value her legacy at the New\n\n>School all the more.\n\n>\n\n>Anyway, I don’t want this email to drone on forever, but I just hope\n\n>to convey how much I appreciate what you are doing. Philosophy in\n\n>its finest moments, occurs in dialogue. Your show embodies that to\n\n>me. Whether the topic is Dante or The Doors, Stimmung or Samuel\n\n>Beckett, Plato or Proust. Even your monologues take the form of the\n\n>dialogue, if you understand what I’m saying. Thank you for sharing\n\n>so much with the world, it is truly a remarkable gift.\n\n>\n\n>Lastly I will say, although I would obviously like to see more shows\n\n>on philosophy, the eclecticism is one of the things that makes the\n\n>show great, so keep it up. I know that who your guests are and what\n\n>topics you discuss is largely dependent on what scholars are either\n\n>in residence or visiting Stanford at any given time. With that out\n\n>of the way, a few critiques/suggestions:\n\n>\n\n>I know that you are interested in Heidegger and judging from some of\n\n>your comments, it seems that you have an conception of Husserl that\n\n>he is an overly scientistic and systematic philosopher, and that the\n\n>really interesting work in phenomenology comes out of Heidegger’s\n\n>response to Husserl. I will not argue against this completely, but I\n\n>will say that you may want to take another look at Husserl (as many\n\n>scholars are doing as we speak) particularly the later work such as\n\n>the Crisis of the European Sciences.\n\n>\n\n>Also, I know that you have very mixed feelings about Deconstruction,\n\n>particularly as a sort of reified, reductionist literary methodology\n\n>(or ideology) however I would humbly suggest that you are long\n\n>overdue in having a show on Jacques Derrida. Regardless of what you\n\n>think about him, he was undoubtedly one of the most influential\n\n>thinkers and writers of the last half of the 20th century and I\n\n>think he deserves at least one episode. Furthermore, coming from a\n\n>position that reads him as primarily a phenomenological thinker,\n\n>rather than strictly as literary theorist, opens up a much richer\n\n>way of approaching his work. I would love to hear some of this\n\n>discussed on your show. A few other philosophers I would love to\n\n>hear more about are Paul Ricoeur, Hans-Georg Gadamer, William James,\n\n>Henri Bergson, Augustine and Gilles Deleuze.\n\n>\n\n>Another suggestion would be to do a show on Minimalist music, either\n\n>as a whole, or focusing on some of the major figures (i.e. La Monte\n\n>Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, John Adams, Arvo Part\n\n>etc). A show on John Cage could also be very interesting.\n\n>\n\n>Lastly, I love your shows on poetry. Keep em coming. Would love to\n\n>hear something on Holderlin, Rilke, or Celan.\n\n>\n\n>Thanks again, and I look forward to the next episode.\n\n>\n\n>-Eric\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear Prof. Harrison,\n\nI was a Capuchin Franciscan Seminarian from 1980-84 and received a\n\nB.A. in Philosophy from the GTU at Berkeley. I have found great\n\nenrichement in listening to your programs. My favorites thus far are: 1.\n\nThomas Sheehan on the Resurrection, 2. Erwin Schrodinger, 3. Jimi\n\nHendrix and 4. Martin Heidegger.\n\nAs to the Resurrection, I thought it was particularly interesting\n\nhow Sheehan points out that the word is actually “awakening” in the\n\noriginal Greek. Have the two of you ever dicussed that Buddha is the one\n\nwho awoke and that Jesus and Buddha have quite a bit in common? They are\n\nboth master psychologists on the deepest level. Jesus speaks of the one\n\nwho loses his life will find it. Buddha’s second noble truth that\n\nattachment is origin of suffering and self is a delusional form of\n\nattachment.\n\nI first became interested in Erwin Schrodinger while listening to\n\nJoseph Campbell. He recommended reading My View of the World and I\n\nbought it from Cambridge Press. If I understand Schrodinger correctly,\n\nhe is saying that emperical scientists can no more prove the existence\n\nof the material world than a philosopher can prove the existence of the\n\nmetaphysical one. Furthermore he takes the Vedantic view (and perhaps\n\nJungian view) that there is only one universal mind (no individual\n\nminds), perhaps paralleling Jesus’ “lose one’s life”and Buddha’s “no\n\nself.”\n\nJimi Hendrix was my teenage idol and like you I believed (maybe\n\nstill believe) he was from another world. It is interesting that he\n\ncalled the band The Experience because he was definitley able to make\n\none experience his sound unlike many others can do. Listening to Jimi, I\n\nhad the feeling of being transported (whatever that might mean). This\n\nbrings up a related question to you and Thomas Sheehan; it seems to me\n\nthat Bible scholars (e.g. Sheehan, Crossan and Borg) come to the\n\nconclusion that the Jesus experience is social justice. While I\n\nacknowledge the importance of social justice, it seems there must be\n\nsome deeper “soul felt experience” of the Divine, and perhaps social\n\njustice flows from that. Have you and Thomas ever discussed mystical\n\nexperiences? Is mystical experience too personal or just too difficult\n\nto describe in words to for a one hour program?\n\nFinally have you ever considered doing shows on:\n\n1. Jiddu Krishnamurti\n\n2. Alan Watts\n\n3. Joseph Campbell\n\n4. Stan Grof or Ralph Metzner?\n\nFinally, finally I mentioned Heidegger because I never really\n\nstudied him and I was intrigued by his looking at being as being as\n\nopposed to what it means for things to be. Your program (again with\n\nThomas Sheehan) served as a very enlightening primer.\n\nThanks for the good work,\n\nMark L\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHello Professor Harrison,\n\nI’m a very new fan of Entitled Opinions and I’ve just got to tell you how much I truly enjoy the show.\n\nI usually listen to podcasts at the gym or when I’m running and EO has been on constant rotation, perhaps even causing me to run a little further and lift a little heavier.\n\nOther than encomium, I’ve got a couple of subject requests to offer. I’m sure I can’t be the only person to make such a request, so I hope you’ll excuse my pedestrianism.\n\nThe first: I’d really love to hear what you might have to say on the subject of the original Earth First!ers and their patron saint, Edward Abbey. Judging by your book on the forest (which I’ve just ordered) and the super fascinating talk you had on the Unabomber with Jean-Marie Apostolides, I think you’d have quite a bit to add to the subject.\n\nThe second: my old Rhetoric professor at UC Berkeley, Dale Carrico, has a great blog- http://www.amormundi.blogspot.com\n\nHe is a tireless critic of movement Transhumanism and is constantly on their radar as a noted enemy. I sort of see him as the Oscar Wilde/Amazing Randi of bioethics and technological chicanery. He is also a devotee of Hanna Arendt, as you can probably tell by his blog’s title. I would love to hear him on the show!\n\nThank you for the hours of good entertainment. You deserve a raise, whatever your salary.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChad\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSeptember 10th, 2012\n\nRobert- all acolytes and participants… Greetings from the mountains of Montana.\n\nEagerly awaiting your new season- Every blessing on the endeavor!\n\nMarianne V\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSeptember 2nd, 2012\n\nHi Robert\n\nMt name is Zach G, 25.\n\nI have lived in Israel my whole life, both my parents are US born and raised\n\nI have been a big fan of your show “entitled opinions” for quite some time now. recently I red your book “Gardens : an essay on the human condition” I wanted to express to you personally my deep pleasure in your scholarly work.\n\nyou have a real talent for bringing together the best of an authentic and learning experience\n\nmany thanks to you and your team\n\ntake care\n\nzac\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAugust 28th, 2012\n\nDear Robert (if may),\n\ni followed yr entlited opinions back in 2008.\n\nit is still a wonderful program. i wish we will have again on stage mr\n\nGirard. I recently listened to the Italian Cinema conversation; as you said we\n\nmust apologize to all the others that for time constraints were not mentioned.\n\nFranco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia were a duo that, besides a lot of trash, worked with Pasolini, Fellini and Comencini. As much as Totó was napolitanean, they were the sicilians from Palermo. they all remain, like the great Louis de Funes, essentially untranslatable. there is a wonderful although long docu (“come inguiammo il cinema italiano”) on them made by Ciprí&Maresco, a wonderful couple of new Italian Cinema. Also you may check another docu “indagine su un cittadino di nome Volonté” on the life of this great actor.\n\nMany more wait in line….\n\nkindest regards and thanks.\n\nEnis K\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAugust 24th, 2012\n\nRobert:\n\nYour show is my salvation! A rare gem, truly… Gratitude to you..\n\nI greatly enjoyed the two shows where your brother was a guest: Pink\n\nFloyd and 1910.. I thought how great would it be if you did something\n\non the German group Can or composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Definitely\n\nrich territory when seen in relation to Pink Floyd and Arnold\n\nSchoenberg..\n\nBest regards,\n\nRob Weingart\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAugust 9th, 2012\n\nDear Mr. Harrison,\n\nI would like to congratulate you with your wonderful radio show. I’m\n\nnot the type to write fan letters, so a I am not going to — but I\n\nwould just like to say that I enjoy your shows tremendously, and\n\nthat I am jealous of the Stanford students that have the chance to\n\nbe in your classroom.\n\nI have just listened to the show on Proust again — it must be the\n\nfourth or fifth time by now — and I was once more struck by your\n\nintroduction to that show’s episode. You start with that quote by\n\nDescartes and then submit your own analogies regarding forests and\n\nliterature.\n\nDoes that introduction, by any chance, exist in written form? I\n\nwould like to both include it in my own collection of Stuff to\n\nRe-Read Every Once in a While, and — if you would allow me — post\n\nit on my website VoorJeHarses.nl. I won’t be too disappointed if you\n\ndon’t have it anymore, since the Proust show was broadcast way back,\n\nin 2007. (Also, if you don’t have the time to search, I would\n\nunderstand.)\n\nAnyway, please keep up with the show. You are making a lot of people\n\nhappy; and what’s more, you are doing so by creating something that\n\ncannot be found easily, especially in cultural wastelands such as\n\nHolland, my native country. You truly fulfill a need.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSander K\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJuly 25th, 2012\n\nHello Robert\n\nThank you for the always stimulating and engaging Entitled Opinions. In this message from the antipodes I wanted to let you know how valued your work is. My favourite shows were the ones on Hannah Arendt and on Dante – both providing a path to new experiences for me.\n\nThe recent programs on Post-Humanismand Hermaphroditism were compelling – it is brilliant how you connect studies in new areas in the humanities with the broad audience of Entitled Opinions.\n\nI usually list to the podcast as I walk along a canal and acqueduct that previously supplied the water for Sydney and has been turned into a walk/cycle way. It is in bushland. This morning as I listened to the Petrarch show three black cockatoos flew by; several sulphur crested cockatoos and galahs screeched from the gum trees; and in the woodland area swarms of finches flitted by.\n\nMany thanks for such a wonderful program\n\nregards\n\nPaul\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJuly 4th, 2012\n\nProfessor Harrison;\n\nIt was only a few months ago that I stumbled upon Entitled Opinions. At the ripe age of 57 I had decided that if I wasn’t ready to read Proust now, then I will never be ready; and if I started now, then I might finish all the volumes before dying.\n\nOn a lark, I typed “Proust” into the iTunes store. One never knows what will come up: up came Entitled Opinions. I listened to the discussion on Proust, and then another on Borges. At first, I was a little put off by the scent of intellectual arrogance detectable in your preambles and in some comments by Hans Gumbrecht. However, it was a small price to pay for the highest quality topics and discussions. Now, after listening to discussions on Moby Dick, Homer, Virgil, Hermaphroditism, Post-humanism, and general whatnot (sic), I must say that I am obsessed by your program. A true turning point, however, was your discussion about Jimi Hendrix which inspired me to download all the songs which I once listened to on long lost LPs and under circumstances bordering on the oceanic. I will even admit to now listening to your preambles in rapt attention and anticipation of the themes to be developed within the body of the discussion.\n\nI will say that as a veteran of the Columbia College Core Curriculum, your program brings me back to the early years of my undergraduate education. We were warned at that time that what we were reading would become more meaningful later in life. At the age of 19, it was hard to imagine but now true. How many times have I felt myself lost in a dark wood, in need of a guide?\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael S\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJuly 2nd, 2013\n\nDear Prof. Harrison,\n\nListening to your shows always lifts me above the mundane concerns of life and takes me to the world of ideas which I would never have come across in my day to day existance. I just want to thank you so so so much for bringing a unique voice in the world of random cacophany .\n\nWould like to suggest a show on ‘Steppenwolf’ by Herman Hesse!!\n\nAvid follower and a listener\n\nPradeep G\n\nNepal\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 21st, 2012\n\nProfessor Harrison,\n\nI wanted to thank you for your show “Entitled Opinions (about Life and Literature;)” I have only been listening to it for a few weeks now, but I am very glad to have found these programs on itunes. I attended a Liberal Arts university in Dallas and have recently had to move to West Texas to take a job. In my current position, I do quite a bit of driving, and your program has been a faithful part of my daily commute to place that it seems heaven itself has forgotten. Out here in West Texas, it is very hard to have conversations like I used to have with my peers in Dallas. “Entitled Opinions” has really helped me to keep thinking and churning philosophic ideas. I know a program like “Entitled Opinions” requires a lot of attention and huge commitment of time. I wanted to thank you and all of the other people involved in the program. I especially have enjoyed the discussions concerning: Homer, Hegel, Machiavelli, and many others. I am especially grateful for your program on Moby Dick; it has been my favorite books since I read it as junior In college. Anyway, thank you for the time and energy you put into the show.\n\nDoug R\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 16th, 2012\n\nI’d like to thank you for your show (a feast of civility and reason) which I listen to by podcast in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nI wonder if you would think of doing a show on Joyce/Ulysses?\n\nAlso, I think a man of Robert’s reach could stretch to some broad science/economic topics.\n\nThanks again for a wonderful listening experience.\n\nGerald C\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 13th, 2012\n\n>Dear Professor Harrison,\n\n>\n\n>This is somewhat unusual, but I wanted to write briefly and say that\n\n>I happened to start listening to a lot of “Entitled Opinions”\n\n>recently, and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate the show.\n\n>\n\n>I used to be a graduate student in German at Stanford (now\n\n>transferred–in English at Princeton), and I’d accumulated a lot of\n\n>episodes in an iTunes folder that for some reason seemed appealing a\n\n>few weeks ago.

However, I do regret that there haven’t been any shows yet on modern Greek literature and culture. It would be a great joy for me to listen to you explore the works of Nikos Kazantzakis, the most tragic of Greece’s authors, whose immense love for Christ led to his excommunication from the church. Or you could have a show on Konstantinos Kavafis, in my opinion the greatest poet of the modern era, unsung to a certain degree because of his Alexandrian birth and his homosexuality. It would be even more delightful to listen to you dwell into the heartfelt blues-like genre of Rembetiko music, from its primary form of hashish-smugglers’ songs to its later embellished serenades.\n\nI am no patriot; far from it (I was born in Tbilisi, I grew up in Athens and now I study cinema in Paris). I do think however that modern Greeks deserve a more varied representation than simply being branded as Europe’s black sheep, notorious only for their tremendous debt and their inefficient taxation system. I would like you to introduce to your listeners the vibrant complexity and not to forget, beauty, of the modern Greek soul.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your show.\n\nWith great admiration,\n\nKonstantin Lucas M\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 9th, 2012\n\nDear Robert,\n\nA long-time addict of Entitled Opinions, I haven’t tuned in for a while (because of the demands of a new job and country). But yesterday I listened to two shows on the theme of listening – Gabriella Safran, and EO listener Sasha Borovik, in conversation with you – and I would like to thank you for these two wonderful conversations. I am hooked again. Both talks were full of resonances for me, for reading poetry, for making music, and for listening to this programme.\n\nI loved Gabriella Safran’s idea that listening has a cultural history, whose development can be traced through different stages of development. The notes about Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy,’s appreciation of Chekhov were a revelation to me, and chimed with other texts I thought your listeners might like to know about.\n\nAbove all, I thought of George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda, which is saturated with thoughts about music and the ethics of listening. Given that this novel is her exploration of Judaism in Britain, it makes sense with everything you discussed about the differences between the Platonic/Christian visual traditions and the Hebrew auditory imagination. George Eliot’s partner, Henry Lewes wrote in detail about the physics of listening in his 1879 The Physiology of Common Life.\n\nAnd they both read the work of H. L. F. Helmholtz, (1885) On the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music, which is full of precise observations like these: Stiff elastic hairs project into the vestibule where the nerves terminate. It is clear that they are “extremely well adapted for moving sympathetically with the motion of the fluid, and hence for producing mechanical irritation in the nerve fibres… between their roots… Close to these surfaces, which are covered with nerves, lie the calcareous concretions, called auditory stones (otoliths)… These otoliths seem also extremely well suited for producing a mechanical irritation of the nerves whenever the fluid in the labyrinth is suddenly agitated” (p. 138-139). And “There must be different parts of the ear which are set in [sympathetic ] vibration by tones of different pitch and which receive the sensation of these tones” (p. 143-144).\n\nThis seems to me pretty closely connected with the idea that reading (people, novels) is a question of empathy, of being open to the other – and that Eliot and Lewes thought of this as an auditory rather than a visual capacity.\n\nThere is also Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe’s Le Chant des muses who writes about the ear that it is ‘le seul des organes sensoriels entièrement ouvert, qui ne se ferme jamais ni ne se met jamais en suspens. … je ne peux pas ne pas entendre’ and he goes on to remark about Nietzche, that ‘l’écoute est beaucoup plus noble, plus profonde, plus révélatrice (de l’intériorité surtout) que la simple vision.’\n\nHe also remarks, that the ancient Greeks associated music ‘ à la mort, c’est à dire, à l’inverse de la mémoire: à l’oubli, au passage du fleuve Lèthè.’ I am not sure about linking it with oblivion, but the sense that one hears in music something of ‘l’autre coté’ rings true to me. It would have made sense to the English Romantic poets, Keats (and Wordsworth, maybe).\n\nI agree with your intuition that reading as listening to a voice may not survive into the next generation of readers, who (if they are like my students) largely read visually, on screen. But listening to the beyond in music seems to be flourishing, despite the general din. Perhaps the auditory imagination just shifts its ground, rather than withers and dies.\n\nThis show brought me fluidly on to the extraordinary voice of your listener, Sasha Borovik. Such a fascinating life. And I completely agree with his description of his experience listening to EO: the sense of ceremony, of savouring a pleasure, and of being open to a Socratic voice that stimulated his thinking, and helped him to affirm himself, and to expand his mental horizons, in the midst of such grim experiences. There are other good radio broadcasts but none that ‘took me so high’: absolutely right, Sasha.\n\nI first came across Entitled Opinions when I was looking for ideas for an undergraduate lecture on The Waste Land in 2010. I went from the show about Eliot, to Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, to Nietzche, and then on through nearly the whole archive. It took me a year to catch up. Listening to EO revived my ideas about what I thought the intellectual life would be like – a symposium, a feast of shared thoughts, a celebration, a voyage, an ever-intensifying conversation, a réseau, words like a bell… It helped me out of an intellectual limbo, and in to a life where many of my dreams have become possible, and those ideas about the intellectual life, realisable.\n\nHearing from another listener closed the circle of the radio format, or rather opened it up: so now I can listen, enchanted not only by the music of the words (and music itself!) but also by the sense of listening in such an absorbed, and thoughtful company.\n\nTo continue the tradition of suggesting topics (not that there is anything lacking in your choices): a programme on listening in Romantic poetry and philosophy?\n\nWith many thanks!!!\n\nRachel F, Lausanne\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDr. Harrison,\n\nI’m hooked on the show. Thanks!\n\nI can think of so many topics that would be great for the show, but I thought I would throw out one particular musician that would be an interesting match for the show: Trey Spruance. He’s the main composer of the group Secret Chiefs 3 and has a serious background in mysticism and Pythagoras. I feel like Spruance interviews only begin to scratch the surface of his ideas.\n\nHere’s some info on him:\n\nQuick Wiki reference:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Spruance\n\nhttp://www.markprindle.com/spruance-i.htm\n\nhttp://www.faithnomoreblog.com/2010/05/trey-spruance-interview.html\n\nThanks for offering a show with substance over soundbite. I like that the writers in discussion (Bataille or Nabokov) are sometimes not your favorites. The defense that the guests offer to your questions often lead to a more complex and interesting understanding of the subjects. The Beckett show is a particular favorite, especially since so much of it is devoted to Murphy–I just don’t hear the novels discussed that often.\n\nAgain, thanks!\n\nAll my best,\n\nStephen McC\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 2nd, 2012\n\nHello, I wanted to make a comment on the latest podcast with Gabriella Safran:\n\nAt about 40 minutes into the podcast, Professor Harrison makes a comment about “the phenomena of hearing voices inside your head” and there not being a classical example of a story about a character hearing voices inside their head and acting on this and whether this is a “psychological symptom” of modernity –\n\nI found this fascinating and a synchronicity as I had just a few hours before listened to a podcast of “Big Ideas” Dr. Iain McGilchrist on Our Mind at War\n\nhttp://bigideas.tvo.org/episode/176134/dr.-iain-mcgilchrist\n\nwhere he discusses the fact that there are good descriptions of depression and mood disorders in antiquity but nothing that corresponds to schizophrenia and that such descriptions seem to appear only after the industrial era. He relates this to a possible product of the stress for certain individuals of living in a left hemisphere dominant society. He has developed this theme throughout his talk and it’s fascinating and related to Professor Harrison’s comment, so perhaps there are connections.\n\nThanks again for all of you who bring Entitled Opinions to us, your listeners!\n\nStephen McD\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 1st, 2012\n\nJe vous écris à nouveau de mon Québec francophone.\n\nLors de votre dernière émission, votre invitée, Gabriella Safran, demandait – si j’ai bien compris – (35: 42) : “Can we ever recapture the experience of listening as for someone whose primary mode of (Š) taking in words is listening?”\n\nÀ moins qu’écouter ne veuille pas dire primitivement « écouter des mots », mais écouter quelqu’un. Sommes-nous encore capables aujourd’hui d’être simplement à l’écoute de quelqu’un? De quelqu’un d’autre? Autre que soi-même? C’est le « on » (das Man) – ne croyez-vous pas? – qui écoute les mots en tant que mots. Mais les mots que l’ “on” s’entend dire ne sont rien d’autre que la projection d’une image visible (lisible) sur l’invisibilité (illisibilité) de l’oral. Or, la parole – non pas la langue faite de mots – est issue de l’oralité. Pour pouvoir être à l’écoute de qui parle, l’autre Je, il faut pouvoir soi-même être un « Tu » (se laisser tutoyer par l’autre Je). Le poète Paul Celan, dont l’¦uvre n’est qu’une continuelle méditation sur la relation Je-Tu, écrit quelque part :\n\nIch bin du, wenn ich ich bin.\n\nSinon, je ne suis pas je, mais un il: le “il” (“er” ou “he”) que l’ “on” est; alors que, en réalité, je te dois, chaque fois, plutôt, un il : a he I owe you.

(Joyce, Ulysses)\n\nMerci pour cette exceptionnelle émission!\n\nJean L.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJune 1st, 2012\n\nI just listened to your Entitled Opinions podcast on “listening”. A completely auditory experience. Or was it? Certainly there was no video as I was obtaining the podcast entirely through my sense of audition using an IPOD. However, I was also walking on the side of a mountain overlooking a river and dawn was breaking. Taking in all that meant that besides audition, I was also experiencing perception through olfaction,vision, tactition and as it turns out gustation. All 5 of the senses simultaneously experienced through the manifold of perception. I listened to the podcast and could maintain a reasonable “sense” of attention to what was being said. But I could also feel the temperature and the wind and the ground beneath my feet. At once I could also smell the river and the blooming Syringa and wild rose as well as see the mountains and the clouds and the colours of dawn and the cliff and the river and anything I attended my eyes toward. As for gustation, I had just finished a cup of coffee and I could taste it quite intensely when I attended to it.\n\nSo, all of my senses were functioning even though I listened carefully to the podcast. Indeed, having only one listen, I went about my morning chores and only after some deliberation lasting a few more hours, did I decide to write this email. When you read it, you will see the words and you will “hear” them spoken. You will also be attending to whatever else is in front of you, such as lunch, the touch of the keypad and maybe music playing on some radio.\n\nMy point is that we never really stop using all of our senses except when unconscious and even then, we can startle to sound and light and smell and touch and I suppose if someone put bitter lemon on our tongue, we might even wake up to that sense! Therefore “listening” is always happening as part of the background of experience and often also as part of the network of sensation.\n\nWhich brings me to the second point. This involves the “theory” of perception. It goes something like this. There is first a stimulus, then a sensation, felt by the observer through his senses. This sensation is then processed through the manifold of the mind (largely unconsciously) to generate perceptions which are further processed both consciously and unconsciously into an “understanding”.\n\nThis “understanding” is what we attend to with our knowledge and reason to generate the space-time that we call an experience such as the blooming syringa, Entitled Opinions podcast in May 2012 and the river and the sunrise etc.\n\nThe third point I would like to bring to your attention is that of the wave-particle duality of light and that of sound. Here Im moving away from the observer and toward the source of the sensation.\n\nYou were talking about the “space between us all”. Ok that was to “lighten up” this extended email. Sorry.This chance wont come againŠhah\n\nAnyway, you were talking about how a painting isn’t like a symphony. How the “temporal” nature of sound made it different than sight. This seems to suggest that there is something different between the sources of the sensation or that the reception of the sensation into a perception was somehow different. Well, I would agree. But its not that there isn’t a “temporal” aspect to viewing a painting or mountain. There surely is. All space is co-occupied with time. You cannot separate the two. They are fundamentals of the physical universe. However, the light waves that you sense from the painting are moving at 300,000,000 meters/sec while the sound waves you generally hear are traveling at 343 meters/sec. The photons move at roughly 106 faster than sound waves. But both are part of the electromagnetic spectrum as are microwaves, radio waves, x-rays, heat, etc.\n\nThere is thereore a temporal nature to your visual senses but the rate is so fast it is perceived as instantaneous and uninterrupted. But that’s not the case; visual images are constantly “updated” by your visual cortex to provide what on experience, feels like a continuum without oscillation.\n\nOne more point about sound waves. They can reinforce, cancel each other or produce “noise” depending on the wave-form which is a function of wavelength and amplitude.\n\nFinally then, I would argue that “listening” to someone speak is different but not categorically distinct from any of the other senses and furthermore, that we experience reality (ie space-time) with all of our senses, while conscious, quite effortlessly and with a non-bias toward our understanding.\n\nOn another level, when you hear someone speak of a train or a sonata or a studio, I contend that you are also visualizing these auditory sensations as perceptions and understandings.\n\nPerhaps the world seems to be getting noisier but stand next to a river or walk on a mountain ledge and try n"
