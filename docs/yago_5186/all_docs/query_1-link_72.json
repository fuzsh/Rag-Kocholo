        "text": "Dr. Emily B. McLaughlin - Double Board Certified Plastic Surgeon\n\nOwner & Medical Director of West Magnolia Plastic Surgery & The Retreat Medical Spa\n\nDr. McLaughlin is a Plastic Surgeon based in Fort Worth, Texas with board certification in both general and plastic surgery. Her practice includes cosmetic and reconstructive surgery with a focus on aesthetic breast and body procedures. After a breast cancer diagnosis in 2016 and now post double mastectomy with reconstruction, her interest in breast cancer patients and their reconstruction is elevated more than even prior to that reality. She founded West Magnolia Plastic Surgery in 2004 with a vision for a comfortable, inviting atmosphere to help ease the anxiety that is often related to surgical procedures, both elective and reconstructive. In 2017, she added the Retreat Medical Spa on site to expand nonsurgical procedures for patients. As a woman, Dr. McLaughlin has the unique ability to comprehend the concerns of females and their interest in rejuvenation of the face, breast and body. Dr. McLaughlin was the first female plastic surgeon to establish a practice in Fort Worth and her ability to communicate with her patients personally and professionally on a very intimate level is well established."
