He was the only one they wanted to keep from the pilot but his wife got in the way because she looked down on TV. A commentator said he wouldn't have been a jerk with the cast like Shatner was, which is true. Good thing they gave him such a nice name. Henry McInnies just doesn't sound as good. I saw him in 4 films before ST rolled around--Brainstorm, Lure of the Wilderness, No Man is an Island, n Man Trap, which was, of course, also the title of the\n\n1st aired episode of ST. And Menagerie was really great n memorable. Too bad he passed away at such a young age. This is a great doc. on him in a great series.\n\nWatch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c8imbemv4g from YouTube\n\nSF-Fandom not responsible for video content\n\nSF-Fandom reserves the right to remove inappropriate video content from its discussions.\n\nYouTube may remove the video from its service without notification.\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nI'm sure he would have done a great job, although I'm not sure he would have had the same swagger and same air of command that Shatner did. Then again, I don't know how much of that was Shatner, and how much was the writers and directors.\n\nI've seen him in No Man Is An Island, as well as The Searchers, The Longest Day, Custer of the West, and King of Kings. Also The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell on tv when I was really young, so I don't recall him very well in that one. He did fine in all those, although was usually playing young, with older character actors around him. Shatner of course continued the idea of the youngest Captain in Starfleet, but he always played the role with the confidence of a much older man.\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nFilmGuy\n\nAdministrator\n\nPosts: 801\n\nThreads: 561\n\nJoined: Dec 2011\n\nA lot of Shatner's famous theatrical pauses were written into the scripts, perhaps by writers who knew that he wanted to insert those kinds of pauses for dramatic effect.\n\nHunter had a much different background than Shatner. Eerily, both actors' careers took a downturn after they stopped working on the Star Trek TV show. Hunter died from complications suffered in a fall when he had a stroke (his second). Shatner managed to work his way back into fame and fortune.\n\nWriting about Science Fiction and Fantasy films.\n\nhttp://www.sf-fandom.com/\n\nSpace Marshal\n\nSenior Member\n\nPosts: 360\n\nThreads: 94\n\nJoined: Sep 2012\n\nShatner was \"Shakespearean\"-trained so he did tend to be theatrical, and many say he was the king of over-acting. I'm not a great judge of acting, but I tend to think that if the part calls for an emotional scene--if it's appropriate, in other words--than that's the way the actor should play it. But other actors like Grace Lee Whitney did say that he was over the top n bombastic. So my way of seeing it is very layman-like, n I don't understand how other laymen can talk as if they're experts on acting. But what always galled me is people who think that if the actor or actress, usually actress, is attractive, they can't act. It's a very immature, unrealistc, prejudiced, n illogical view.\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nYep, that's the same with fame too, and doubly so if it's someone famous and attractive.\n\nThe thing with Shatner is that no one ever complained about his acting back when the show was on... or when he was one of the up and coming hot young stars on Broadway and in Hollywood. Or when he was starring in his next series Barbary Coast, or in countless tv guest star roles in the 70's. Once the show acquired cult status, comedians began imitating him in an exaggerated style (Belushi on SNL, Kevin Pollak in his standup routine) plus by then he was in a very campy and over the top cop series, T. J. Hooker. And people were making fun of the show - not just him, but Adrian Zmed, Heather Locklear and its whole Charlie's Angels vibe. But the comedians weren't complaining, they were just doing comedy, like people imitate James Cagney saying \"you dirty rat,\" and never go back to add \"but actually he was an incredibly talented and diverse actor - this is just comedy.\" Then suddenly the Trek movies came out, and Shatner was no longer a young man, and so it became easy to make fun of him just like Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, and Lloyd Bridges made fun of themselves in Airplane. But I don't think anyone except people that the Force might have a strong influence on confuse comedy with actual appreication of a performer's work.\n\nBut Shatner laughed all the way to the bank. And ironically, if people hadn't been making fun of him, I doubt he'd have gotten the Priceline commercials gig, which has probably proved more profitable for him that anything else.\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nSpace Marshal\n\nSenior Member\n\nPosts: 360\n\nThreads: 94\n\nJoined: Sep 2012\n\nThat's very interesting about complaints about Shatner's acting starting only later. I've been hearing recently that overacting is what actors did back then. I imagine this is another myth.\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nWell, I don't think there are any casting directors who claim that Shatner overacts.\n\nBut yeah - watch Montalban in Trek 2, or Christopher Plummer (who got his start in French and English radio and theatre with Shatner in Montreal) in Trek 6, or Malcolm McDowall in almost any film he's ever done, or Cagney in White Heat, or Heston in Planet of the Apes, or Meryl Streep in Devil Wears Prada, or Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, and then tell me who is being histrionioc, them or Shatner. :tongue: \"Back then\" is still in our lifetime, and acting hasn't changed. If you want to see Shatner being low-key, check him out in Judgement in Nuremburg, while Maximillian Schell gets to chew the scenery.\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nSpace Marshal\n\nSenior Member\n\nPosts: 360\n\nThreads: 94\n\nJoined: Sep 2012\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nSpace Marshal\n\nSenior Member\n\nPosts: 360\n\nThreads: 94\n\nJoined: Sep 2012\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nOK, direct from his autobiography:\n\nQuote:my family lived in a comfortable house in Girouard Street, in the more affluent, mostly Catholic area, NDG, Notre Dame de Grace.\n\nHe describes it as being two miles from McGill where he went to college.
