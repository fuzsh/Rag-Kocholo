The program, fully funded by industry through assessments on the sale of its products, does not use taxpayer dollars.\n\n“I am thrilled to appoint a highly talented slate of concrete industry leaders from across the country to pioneer the National Concrete Masonry Products Board,” said Secretary Gina Raimondo. “Concrete masonry is a proud American tradition, and strengthening this important industry will expand markets, create jobs, and lead to higher quality outputs.”\n\nThe program aims to strengthen the position of the domestic concrete masonry products industry, maintain, develop, and expand domestic markets for concrete masonry products, and promote the use of concrete masonry products in construction and building.\n\nThe board is responsible for implementing an order passed by an industry referendum on December 18, 2021. For additional information on the program and a copy of the order, please visit the Department's checkoff website.\n\nVoting board members:\n\nMember\n\nCompany\n\nRegion\n\nBrendan Quinn\n\nErnest Maier, Inc\n\nNortheast\n\nRichard O’Connor\n\nTaylor Concrete Products, Inc\n\nNortheast\n\nHeidi Jandris\n\nJandris Block\n\nNortheast\n\nPreston Sparkman\n\nQuality Block & Supply\n\nSoutheast\n\nMajor Ogilvie\n\nCemex (Ready Mix)\n\nSoutheast\n\nGregg Gibbel\n\nQuikrete Best Block\n\nSoutheast\n\nMelissa Kline\n\nConsumers Concrete Corp\n\nN.
