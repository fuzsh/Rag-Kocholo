        "text": "Conference Theme Overview\n\nNew political, technological, and economic forces are changing the ways development is designed, practiced, and experienced today, in poor and rich countries alike. Three interrelated elements, in particular, deserve our analytical attention: a geopolitically and economically unsettled global order, smart information and communication technologies, and extreme inter- and intra-country inequities. By transforming practices of accumulation, surveillance, and redistribution, these factors shape the experience of development in significant ways.\n\nAn unsettled global order—triggered in part by a threatened US hegemony and China’s rising power—defines the diplomatic initiatives and economic investments in poor countries. Some foreign investments are driven by private capital, others are state-led. Some initiatives are for profit, others are designated as development aid. New ambitious projects include the UN-led Sustainable Development Goals and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Other projects are driven and funded by local actors. On the ground, the effects on development are potentially dramatic—investments in basic health and education must have major redistributive effects; infrastructural projects are likely to transform social and economic practices in and across cities; the environment is necessarily affected—but we are yet to fully understand the origins and potential impact of such programs.\n\nOne competition informing global and local restlessness today is over technology. A smart global order is currently being created—an order in which information and communication technologies dominate public arenas and private lives. Much of the debates on new technologies have been concerned with the global North, yet in so many ways the impact on the global South may be even more significant. In the global South, new technologies are being effectively used to overcome extant infrastructural barriers to improve people’s lives. India famously uses biometric ID systems to distribute social benefits, for example, and other governments are currently collecting biometric data allegedly for similar purposes. New technologies are also used to monitor and control people. Governments exploit mass surveillance and smartphone technologies to compromise opposition figures; facial-recognition technology is used to scan for the presence of dissidents. The poor, refugees, and people trapped in the criminal justice system are particularly vulnerable. In the meantime, social media influence operations attempt to sway elections. In turn, technologies can be used by civil society actors to hold states more accountable. Local dynamics informing the development and use of technologies—and the impact of technologies on the future of work, the future of welfare, and the future of democracy—are essential to analyze.\n\nFinally, the current global order is unapologetically unequal. Foreign interventions may strengthen current elites or empower rival fractions; mass automation is likely to bifurcate the global division of labor, but in unexpected ways; our submission to the gaze of corporations and governments make all of us vulnerable—but not equally so. And especially where social and political institutions are weak, the impact of current geopolitical dynamics and techno-political transformations is likely to both reproduce old dividing lines across classes, genders, and ethnic groups, and to add new divisions. Yet, we should also identify ways by which these geopolitical dynamics and techno-political transformations are used in the fight against injustices.\n\nThe SASE conference held online from 18-21 July 2020 will feature papers on all issues of concern for socio-economics, but we especially welcome contributions that explore development today and how geopolitical interventions, technological forces, and inequalities shape and are in turn shaped by development, today as in the past, from a variety of disciplinary and methodological perspectives. SASE’s current members are uniquely positioned to tackle these new realities and offer valuable insights; we hope that this year’s theme would, in addition, bring first-time participants, novel approaches, and new inquiries to add to our conversations.\n\nEstablished in 1989, SASE owes its remarkable success to the determination to provide a platform for creative research addressing important social problems. Throughout its three decades, SASE has encouraged and hosted rigorous work of any methodological or theoretical bent from around the world based on the principle that innovative research emerges from paying attention to wider context and connecting knowledge developed in different fields. SASE is committed to a diverse membership and lively intellectual debates and encourages panels that include or are likely to include a diverse group of participants.\n\nPresident: Nitsan Chorev (nitsan_chorev@brown.edu)\n\nProgram Committee: Rina Agarwala, Diego Sánchez-Ancochea, Daniel Mügge\n\nLocal Organizing Committee: Daniel Mügge, Jonathan Zeitlin\n\nBackground\n\nEstablished in November 2017 by a group of female social science scholars, the Women and Gender Forum (WAG) is an interest group of the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics (SASE). Membership is open to all female SASE members and those who identify as women in a way that is significant to them.\n\nOur aims\n\nWAG has three objectives: 1. to improve senior representation of women in academia, 2. to provide a networking space for female scholars, and 3. to stimulate discussions about important issues, such as “challenges of publishing,” “work-life balance,” “leadership roles,” or “career progression.” Every year we come together at the SASE Annual conference in a dedicated session to discuss research, share information, network with each other, and welcome our junior colleagues.\n\nLast events/achievements\n\n2018 Kyoto\n\nThe 2018 Kyoto kick-off event of the Women and Gender Forum was very successful. We had over 80 participants discussing issues related to publishing, career progression, and work-life balance, followed by a networking lunch.\n\nSASE Diversity Committee and WAG Keynote speaker\n\nAs a result of the WAG Forum’s activities, in 2018 SASE set up a “Diversity Committee” within the Executive Council to monitor and support diversity within the organization and supported our initiative to allocate a special keynote speaker for the WAG Forum at the Annual Meetings.\n\n2019 New York\n\nIn 2019 in New York, we organized a themed round-table discussion session, a networking lunch as well as a WAG Keynote lecture with Professor Nancy Fraser.\n\n2020 Women and Gender Forum Meeting\n\nThis year’s event will take place online on Sunday, July 19th at 8am EST—a time slot that does not clash with any other sessions.\n\nThe pandemic disrupted our lives in an unprecedented way, and research shows that it affected women’s research productivity and work-life balance significantly. Reflecting on these changes, we decided to dedicate the WAG 2020 meeting to establish support networks for women to exchange ideas with people in similar situations and further develop their research topics and to initiate new co-operations, providing fruitful discussions in these demanding times. To help us understand the situation of our members we kindly ask you to participate in this survey.\n\nThis year’s WAG Keynote lecture will be delivered by Prof. Stephanie Barrientos at 2pm EST on 19 July. A link to the lecture will be provided shortly, as will a link to the 2020 WAG program.\n\nIf you would like to become a member, please fill out the form on this page.\n\nIf you would like to get in touch, please e-mail: D.Sallai@lse.ac.uk\n\nLoading…\n\nWAG Committee\n\nFounding Chair – Dorottya Sallai\n\nCommittee members –Sarah Ashwin, Chiara Benassi, Virginia L Doellgast, Jacqueline O’Reilly, and Caroline Ruiner.\n\nSS4RW – 2020 – Repurposing the Corporation to Save Capitalism from Itself?\n\n11am-12pm EST (5pm-6pm CET)\n\nMonday, July 20th\n\nThe current pandemic is expected to have a major impact on economies around the world for years to come. In times of crises, economic growth, employment levels, and firm survival tend to become the top priority for politicians and business leaders alike. Other objectives – such as social and environmental sustainability – fall into the background. Indeed, corporate expenditures related to social and environmental initiatives are often considered the first costs that can be cut.\n\nLoading…\n\nAt the same time, the current crisis comes at a moment when companies face increasing societal pressures to become more socially and environmentally responsible. From the Black Lives Matter and ‘Climate Strike’ movements, to the Extinction Rebellion protests, to high-profile academic and civil society projects seeking to develop new theoretical foundations which redefine corporate purpose beyond shareholder value maximisation (see here, here, and here), societal pressures on companies are arguably stronger now than ever before.\n\nMany of these movements see Covid-19 not just as another crisis, but rather a direct result of an unsustainable economic model, and debate has raged over the question whether the processes of global capitalism can be blamed for the quick spread of the virus and the inability of countries to react to it. In this context, various societal actors are seeking to make sure that the post-Covid-19 rebound will be used as an opportunity for a ‘green recovery’ and a ‘Green New Deal’ that will fundamentally change the dominant economic model.\n\nCompanies adopting ‘low road strategies’ that focus on producing at low cost to be able to sell at prices that are affordable for financially squeezed customers may certainly benefit from the crisis. Nevertheless, there are signs that many other companies are willing to use the crisis as an impetus to undertake ambitious reforms towards more sustainable business models. Thus, Danone’s shareholders recently voted to turn the company into an ‘Entreprise à Mission,’ thus enshrining in its articles of incorporation a corporate purpose that goes beyond shareholder value. According to its CEO Danone’s shareholders have thus ‘toppled a statue of Milton Friedman.’\n\nThe tensions between economic necessities in the context of the post-crisis recovery and public pressures on companies to do more to reconcile them with a broader range of stakeholder interests and goals can be expected to become more prominent still in the years to come. Indeed, given the corrosive impact that the post-2008 Global Financial Crisis phase of austerity has had on public support for the current economic and political order, it may not be an exaggeration to suggest that repurposing the corporation and moving away from a singular focus on shareholder wealth may become a vital question for the future of modern capitalism and democracy.\n\nThis year’s Social Sciences for the Real World (SS4RW) session brings together academics and practitioners who deal with the question of the purpose of the corporation in their daily work and will discuss the crucial question whether “repurposing the corporation to save capitalism from itself?” is feasible and desirable.\n\nWe seek to bring together – albeit virtually – a panel of academics and interested members of the public to engage in a constructive debate about this crucial issue, and about how social scientists and people in the “real world” perceive them and what they can learn from each other.\n\nRepurposing the Corporation to Save Capitalism from Itself?\n\nSpeakers: Erik Breen (Managing Director and Owner Infinsus), Isabelle Ferreras (Université Catholique de Louvain), Rosl Veltmeijer-Smits (Triodos Bank NV), Jeroen Veldman (Nyenrode)\n\nChairs: Imran Chowdhury (Wheaton College), Anna Skarpelis (Harvard University)\n\nWe would like to encourage participants to send us ahead of the session their general questions on the topic or specific points they would like to see speakers address. This will allow us to get a sense of what may be of most interest to the audience. Please e-mail them to G.Schnyder@lboro.ac.uk with SS4RW question in the subject header."
