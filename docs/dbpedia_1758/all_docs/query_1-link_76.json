        "text": "3/2/2015 update: No word on whether or not BOT Secretary Angela Wilhelm will tear down that wall of PR flack tables separating the Trustees from the university community during this Thursday and Friday’s meetings, but it’s a good sign that 20 months into their term in office, the Board is willing to meet with faculty. I’m on the list, so Wilhelm’s assistant Amanda Hatch can’t have been screening people too carefully:\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 3, 2015\n\nTO: Individuals Attending Faculty/Trustee Discussions\n\nFROM: Susan Gary, Faculty Trustee\n\nRE: Thoughts on the March 6 Discussions\n\nThank you for your willingness and interest in participating in the discussions with UO trustees this\n\nFriday, March 6, at 8:00 AM. These conversations will give the trustees a great opportunity to learn\n\nmore about the faculty – what we do, our strengths and the challenges we face. I thought it would be\n\nhelpful to provide some ideas about conversation topics, although these are not restrictive. You should\n\nfeel free to discuss any issues of concern to you, and the trustees may have questions they want to ask.\n\nThe conversations will evolve, as conversations do.\n\nOur initial target size was 10 faculty members and three trustees per group. Given the number of\n\npeople who expressed interest, we can accommodate everyone if we increase the group size to 11, so\n\nthat is what we have decided to do. I think 11 should be fine; if you would prefer to wait until June (we\n\nplan to have more discussions then), please let Amanda Hatch know and we can save your information.\n\nThe trustees will want to hear from everyone, so please be courteous with respect to time so that\n\neveryone can have a chance to speak. It’s a conversation, so multiple short comments will likely be\n\nbetter than one long comment per person.\n\nHere are suggested topics for discussion that I brainstormed. I use “faculty” to include both TTF and\n\nNTTF because most topics apply to both, although sometimes in different ways.\n\nFaculty classifications.\n\n– What do the classifications of faculty as TTF and NTTF – mean? (and NTRF and Library faculty if\n\nsomeone can speak to those categories)\n\n– What roles do different faculty members play?\n\n–\n\n– What is the promotion process like for TTF and NTTF?\n\nTeaching.\n\n– What contributes to teaching excellence?\n\n– How much work goes into preparing a class?\n\n– How do teachers keep their classes fresh?\n\n– How does the Teaching Effectiveness Program work with faculty to improve teaching? (Have you\n\ntaken advantage of TEP and what has been the benefit?)\n\n– How does research contribute to teaching?\n\n– What are classroom conditions like – technology, class size, and configuration of classrooms?\n\n– How do negative factors hinder teaching excellence – increases in class size, increased teaching\n\nload?\n\nService.\n\n– What kind of University and unit service do faculty do?\n\n– What is the service work load and what types of service work do faculty do (admissions,\n\nscholarships, curriculum, hiring, promotion and tenure, etc.)\n\n– How does the level of service required affect teaching and scholarship?\n\nMentoring.\n\n– How do faculty mentor students?\n\n– Undergraduates? What kind of mentoring do undergrads need? What are the\n\nchallenges/rewards of mentoring undergrads?\n\n– Graduate students? What is the relationship between an advisor and a\n\ncandidate? How does advising a grad student work?\n\n– How do faculty help students think about career options?\n\nResearch.\n\n– What is the role of research for a TTF?\n\n– What is the grant writing process like?\n\n– What is the publication process like?\n\nMasters or Ph.D.\n\n– What synergies exist among the research, teaching and service obligations of faculty members?\n\n– (Note: There is a lot to say about research, but this is an area the trustees have already had\n\nsome exposure to, so it may be good to focus on other topics.)\n\nUnit structure.\n\n– How do TTF and NTTF interact within units?\n\n– How do units govern themselves?\n\nUniversity Senate.\n\n– What role does the Senate play? What role should the Senate play?\n\n– Do faculty feel engaged with the Senate?\n\nOnline education.\n\nThis probably deserves a separate discussion when issues can be discussed more thoroughly – there is a\n\nlot of work needed to develop a strategy – but someone may have particular insights to share.\n\n2/25/2015 update: Ron Bramhall (Business) and faculty union VP for NTTFs, persuades the BOT’s sole Faculty Trustee, Susan Gary (Law), to invite NTTFs to meetings with Board members:\n\n12/14/2014: Video of the Senate meeting is now available:\n\n12/10/2014 PM update:\n\nAlexandra Wallachly from the Emerald has posted a report on the meeting, here.\n\nOn the Board meeting Thursday: I think it’s important to show up at the Board meeting Thursday at 8AM in the Alumni Center. While the board has backed off on the latest power grab, there’s plenty of potential for surprises, those making public comments deserve some supporters, and it’s important that the Board sees that the faculty take what’s been happening very seriously. And I hear someone will be passing out “Save our Senate” buttons.\n\nOn the Senate meeting today: I got there at the very end. I’d love it if someone would send me some notes or post them. People tell me it was standing room only, and filled with dismay and outrage over what’s going on with our administration.\n\nThe Senate passed an amended version of the motion below, opposing the Triplett/Park power grab. The fact that they did this even after Coltrane announced the Board would withdraw the motion at his suggestion shows how deep the mistrust of Johnson Hall has become. Coltrane and Bronet need to take charge of that snake-pit, decisively and soon.\n\nThe Senate then apparently wrote and approved a second motion, directing the Academic Integrity Task Force to investigate the administration’s “alleged plans to establish groundwork for disciplinary procedures” against Philosophy Dept Chair Bonnie Mann and other faculty who refused to issue “fraudulent” grades. Apparently there is also an accusation that a CAS administrator not only gave out grades for courses, but then raised them after students complained. I don’t know if the TAIF will also investigate that.\n\nI’ll post the video when available, and I expect the motions (passed unanimously?) will be on the Senate website soon, here. Meanwhile check Try Bree Nicolello’s twitter reports on the meeting: https://twitter.com/breenicolello.\n\n12/10/2014 update: (see below for Coltrane response)\n\nSorry, I’m at the Board committee meetings, no live-blog."
