        "text": "Four Republican former elected officials who went to court last month to void Oregon’s new congressional districts map that they dubbed an “obvious, extreme, partisan gerrymander” do not appear to have convinced a retired judge appointed to gather facts in the case.\n\nSenior Judge Henry Breithaupt, appointed to serve as the “special master” in the redistricting case, will issue final findings of fact on Friday for a five-judge panel to consider as they decide by Nov. 24 whether to dismiss the Republicans’ petition to overturn the congressional map. On Monday, Breithaupt issued a preliminary opinion to give lawyers for the Republicans, the Legislature and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee a short window to object."
