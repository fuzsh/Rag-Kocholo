        "text": "The mission of the Oregon State Capitol Foundation is to connect Oregonians to a shared heritage, enhance the beauty of the Capitol, and involve citizens in their democracy. The group accomplishes its mission through work in three main areas.\n\n1. Providing funding for educational and cultural programs, events and displays\n\nOregonians and visitors have engaging opportunities to learn from important milestones in Oregon’s history, celebrate aspects of our shared heritage and build community through annual events produced by the History Gateway and funded by the Capitol Foundation. Funding from the Capitol Foundation underwrites these enriching and fun events, where attendees can learn about and from each other; they are free and open to all. One of the Capitol Foundation’s major projects, the Capitol History Gateway, and a strong partnership with Capitol Visitor Services allows educators to access and teach a curriculum for 4th grade classroom trips, during which students visit the Capitol and learn about the legislative process, the unique building, and state history. As a result of these experiences, many students develop a strong interest in our state’s heritage, and perhaps, public service. The Capitol itself is a grand environment where visitors learn about state history.History Gateway exhibits located in the galleria area, also funded by the Capitol Foundation, include topics that illuminate the history and experiences of all Oregonians.\n\n2. Preserving history\n\nEducation about history, the legislative process, and representative democracy is critical for the health of our state and way of life; it is a core strategy for achieving the Capitol Foundation’s mission. To support this goal, the Capitol Foundation has compiled, produced and preserved twenty-three oral histories from ordinary Oregonians, working people willing to become involved in the life of our state and had a great impact on our state and the daily life of its citizens. Viewers hear directly from former governors, legislators, lobbyists, and state employees about their Capitol experiences and involvement in making laws that continue to impact Oregonians every day.\n\n3. Supporting improvements that contribute to the dignity and beauty of the building.\n\nOregon’s Capitol is more appealing, dignified, educational, and beautiful because of the Capitol Foundation. The Capitol Foundation donates enhancements to the building and grounds for the benefit of visitors and those who work in the building. The Capitol Foundation also funds memorials to citizens who have significantly enriched the health or well-being of our state and nation, so that all may be inspired by their contributions. In addition, the Capitol Foundation is a public advisor and advocate for building needs, such as earthquake preparedness.\n\nProviding educational and cultural programs, events and displays:\n\nBy conceiving and funding the creation of the Capitol History Gateway and its ongoing programming, including:\n\n- 4th Grade curriculum development and support\n\n- Web-based visitor tours\n\n- Funding Oregon’s Heritage events and Capitol celebration events, over twenty per year\n\n- Exhibits about Capitol history and people in the Capitol who made history\n\n- Training and uniforms for Capitol volunteers\n\nPreserving history, such as:\n\n- Oral History Project videos\n\n- Speaker Series\n\n- Regional Museum Outreach management and funding\n\nSupporting improvements that contribute to the dignity and beauty of the building\n\nExamples include:\n\n- Memorials\n\n- Historical displays\n\n- Benches for viewing the Capitol Rotunda\n\n- Archival display case to display historic documents\n\n- Pianos for the House and Senate Chambers\n\nThe Capitol Foundation will continue to provide funding for the History Gateway and its many exhibits, visitor events, and educational programs that serve over 100,000 visitors per year, as well as more than 20,000 students on school tours. In addition to the work noted above, the Capitol Foundation plans to:\n\n• Contribute to the design and funding of an updated Visitor Welcome Center interior\n\n• Digitally transcribe the growing Oral History collection\n\n• Support funding for new governor portraits\n\n• Translate virtual self-guided tours into foreign languages\n\n• Host a welcome event at the opening of the Legislature’s regular sessions in odd-numbered years\n\n• Convert historic Capitol slides/photos into a digital format\n\n• Create and fund a fellowship program for graduate students"
