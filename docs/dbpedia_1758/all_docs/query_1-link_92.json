        "text": "FOND DU LAC - A Mount Calvary woman was ordered to serve 30 days in jail and two years of probation for stealing poppy sales money from veterans.\n\nDonna Wilhelms, 65, pleaded no contest Tuesday to three counts of felony theft from a business setting. Fond du Lac County Circuit Court Judge Gary Sharpe also ordered Wilhelms pay back $10,660 in restitution money during the duration of her probation.\n\nMembers of American Legion Auxiliary Post 75 contacted police in the summer of 2017 to report missing money from a poppy flower sale they hold every year as a fundraiser.\n\nProfits from the sale are split in half between the auxiliary and the Legion post.\n\nWilhelms was the Fond du Lac County Legion Treasurer at the time.\n\nPolice detectives discovered most of the money deposited into an American Legion Auxiliary account at Marine Credit Union would be withdrawn from the account shortly after it was deposited, draining the account, court records state.\n\nWilhelms later confessed to taking checks written out to the American Legion, depositing them, then withdrawing cash for her own personal use.\n\nIt's estimated at least $7,500 was withdrawn between June 2013 and December 2016.\n\nWilhelms told detectives she was having financial difficulties.\n\nSharpe ordered the defendant write a letter of apology and serve 30 hours of community service.\n\nRELATED: FDL County Courthouse will be secured on Aug. 5\n\nRELATED: FDL County DA disqualified from prosecuting murder case\n\nContact Sharon Roznik at 920-907-7936 or sroznik@gannett.com.
