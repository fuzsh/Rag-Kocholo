        "text": "[Congressional Record Volume 166, Number 208 (Wednesday, December 9, 2020)] [House] [Pages H7088-H7092] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] REQUIRING SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO CONSIDER CERTAIN RECOGNIZED SECURITY PRACTICES Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7898) to amend title XXX of the Public Health Services Act to provide for a technical correction to provide the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Service certain authorities with respect to investigations of information blocking, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 7898 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. RECOGNITION OF SECURITY PRACTICES. Part 1 of subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (42 U.S.C. 17931 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 13412. RECOGNITION OF SECURITY PRACTICES. ``(a) In General.--Consistent with the authority of the Secretary under sections 1176 and 1177 of the Social Security Act, when making determinations relating to fines under such section 1176 (as amended by section 13410) or such section 1177, decreasing the length and extent of an audit under section 13411, or remedies otherwise agreed to by the Secretary, the Secretary shall consider whether the covered entity or business associate has adequately demonstrated that it had, for not less than the previous 12 months, recognized security practices in place that may-- [[Page H7089]] ``(1) mitigate fines under section 1176 of the Social Security Act (as amended by section 13410); ``(2) result in the early, favorable termination of an audit under section 13411; and ``(3) mitigate the remedies that would otherwise be agreed to in any agreement with respect to resolving potential violations of the HIPAA Security rule (part 160 of title 45 Code of Federal Regulations and subparts A and C of part 164 of such title) between the covered entity or business associate and the Department of Health and Human Services. ``(b) Definition and Miscellaneous Provisions.-- ``(1) Recognized security practices.--The term `recognized security practices' means the standards, guidelines, best practices, methodologies, procedures, and processes developed under section 2(c)(15) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act, the approaches promulgated under section 405(d) of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, and other programs and processes that address cybersecurity and that are developed, recognized, or promulgated through regulations under other statutory authorities. Such practices shall be determined by the covered entity or business associate, consistent with the HIPAA Security rule (part 160 of title 45 Code of Federal Regulations and subparts A and C of part 164 of such title). ``(2) Limitation.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as providing the Secretary authority to increase fines under section 1176 of the Social Security Act (as amended by section 13410), or the length, extent or quantity of audits under section 13411, due to a lack of compliance with the recognized security practices. ``(3) No liability for nonparticipation.--Subject to paragraph (4), nothing in this section shall be construed to subject a covered entity or business associate to liability for electing not to engage in the recognized security practices defined by this section. ``(4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Secretary's authority to enforce the HIPAA Security rule (part 160 of title 45 Code of Federal Regulations and subparts A and C of part 164 of such title), or to supersede or conflict with an entity or business associate's obligations under the HIPAA Security rule.''. SEC. 2. TECHNICAL CORRECTION. (a) In General.--Section 3022(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300jj-52(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(4) Application of authorities under inspector general act of 1978.--In carrying out this subsection, the Inspector General shall have the same authorities as provided under section 6 of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).''. (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114-255). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 7898. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in 2016, the Energy and Commerce Committee led the charge in passing the 21st Century Cures Act. In addition to investing billions in cutting-edge research and opioid abuse prevention and treatment, the Cures Act also included several provisions related to improving the interoperability of health information technology. Specifically, the act defined the practice of information blocking. It also provided the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, with the authority to investigate and levy penalties on entities found to be engaging in information blocking. Examples of information blocking could include a developer placing unnecessary restrictions on authorized exchanges of information. Another example would be when a developer implements their electronic health record, EHR, technology in such a nonstandard way that it becomes incredibly difficult to exchange a patient's health information with a system not owned by that developer. Practices like these simply stand in the way of patients accessing their own data and carrying their data with them as they move between plans and providers. I am pleased that the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, ONC, and the OIG have worked since the passage of the Cures Act to implement these important policies. The bill before us today, H.R. 7898, provides for a technical correction to the Cures Act to ensure that the OIG has the authority they fully need to enforce the information blocking prohibitions. H.R. 7898 also includes another health IT-related policy that was part of a bipartisan, bicameral health agreement released by the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions last December. This policy incentivizes healthcare entities to adopt strong cybersecurity practices by encouraging the Secretary of HHS to consider entities' adoption of recognized cybersecurity practices when conducting audits or administering HIPAA fines. Cyberattacks are increasingly a major concern for healthcare providers. It is important that we acknowledge those providers that are acting in good faith and doing everything in their power to safeguard patient data. This provision encourages providers to follow widely recognized best practices in the field with the goal of helping all providers be better prepared for potential cybersecurity attacks. These both are commonsense policies, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting them. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7898, a technical corrections bill introduced by Dr. Burgess. The 21st Century Cures Act had a major provision, led by Dr. Burgess, regarding information blocking. This is a process where a healthcare provider or an electronic healthcare record vendor will not move a patient's data between care settings or erects significant technological or financial barriers to do so. The 21st Century Cures Act was significant in that it banned the practice of information blocking, which is a key patient protection and an effort to transform our healthcare delivery system. Patient access and control over personal health information should be at the center of our efforts in securing high-quality and patient-driven care. The Energy and Commerce Committee delivered this win for patients, and today, we need to make a minor but very important technical correction to ensure our policy is enforced. H.R. 7898 would clarify the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general regarding information blocking, to make crystal clear that the IG has the authority to enforce this ban, to go after bad actors, and to protect patient access to personal health data. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), the author of this provision and our ranking member, the top member on the Republican side, on the Health Subcommittee. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the recognition. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7898, once again, to clarify the enforcement and investigative authorities of the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services with respect to health record information blocking. In 2016, as has been stated, Congress passed the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act with the goal of closing the gap between innovation and our Nation's regulatory process. Throughout the drafting of Cures, I made it a priority to address important health information technology issues, including interoperability and the prevention of information blocking. I am a physician, but I am also a patient, and I am acutely aware of the frustrations surrounding the difficulty of a patient accessing their medical records. Patients should control their own medical data. Yet, if a patient and their doctor have difficulty in accessing electronic health records, the patient's care may suffer. In the Cures bill, Congress provided the tools necessary for doctors and patients to better coordinate their care through the sharing of patient data. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology promulgated a rule that outlines what is permissible. This rule, [[Page H7090]] which was finalized this past May, aims to allow patients to seamlessly access their electronic health information. This bill, H.R. 7898, is needed in order to ensure that there is a smooth and effective implementation and to allow for the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services to enforce this rule. In the context of this coronavirus pandemic, I think we have all seen the importance of allowing the efficient flow of a patient's medical records so that patients and their doctors can have informed conversations about their care plans. Also of importance is ensuring patient privacy and ensuring that it is protected and that information is secure. H.R. 7898 builds on the sections of the 21st Century Cures Act and encourages healthcare entities to adopt strong cybersecurity practices, which are essential in protecting patient data from bad actors. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 1 minute. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Finally, I would like to point to the bipartisan, bicameral support of H.R. 7898, which was included in title V of the Lower Health Care Costs package in the Senate. We have both Chambers and both parties coming to an agreement, and that is a positive sign. It certainly indicates the importance of this legislation. It is for these reasons that I encourage Members to vote in favor of H.R. 7898. Again, I thank the ranking member for his years of friendship and service to the committee. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I was hoping I wasn't going to have to make this statement about Greg Walden retiring because I really didn't want him to retire. I guess I kept hoping that he wouldn't or that he would still be here in some fashion--and he will be in some fashion. But I wanted to thank him for 20 years of extraordinary service on the Energy and Commerce Committee, in particular. And I want to particularly thank him for his leadership and friendship over the last 4 years as he served as the top Republican on the committee. During those first 2 years, he chaired the committee, and then over the last 2 years, he served as the ranking member. Our committee, as he knows and I think a lot of people know, has a long and proud tradition of bipartisanship, and Greg has really been a great partner, particularly over the last year as we faced the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19. We have worked very closely over the last 11 months on all the legislation that was signed into law to respond to the pandemic. Among those laws was the CARES Act, which provided essential assistance to the American people, healthcare workers, hospitals, small businesses, and State and local government. We have taken some significant steps, but the work continues as we hope to complete another COVID-19 relief package in the coming days before we adjourn. Prior to the pandemic this year, we were able to come together over the last 4 years, thanks to Greg's leadership, to pass a lot of other substantial bills that actually became law. We passed comprehensive legislation to address the opioid epidemic by expanding treatment to people fighting opioid use disorder and supporting those affected by the opioid crisis. We reauthorized the Safe Drinking Water Act for the first time in 20 years. We eliminated annoying robocalls--I don't know, ``eliminating'' may not be accurate, but we eliminated a lot of them. We passed the RAY BAUM'S Act, named after the late Republican staff director of the committee and Greg's longtime friend, which reauthorized the Federal Communications Commission for the first time in 28 years. I know the law is very important to Greg, not only because it was named after Ray but also because of Greg's longtime love for broadcasting. Of course, not everything is bipartisan. He will probably never forget his initiation as chairman. His first full committee markup--as was already mentioned by other colleagues--was the longest markup in the Energy and Commerce Committee's history, 27 hours as we debated the Republican Affordable Care Act repeal bill. That was really baptism by fire. At the end of the day, I am going to remember Greg most for the commitment he made day in and day out to help everyday Americans. It is really special. A lot of people have a bad opinion of Congress. They think that we come here for self-aggrandizement because somehow we want to get a better job after we leave--not that there is one--or that we are trying to help our families or trying to help special interests. The one thing I will say about Greg is that none of that is true. {time} 1530 One thing I will say about Greg is that none of that is true. He has a strong dose of humility, and humility is something that I would say oftentimes is lacking, not just in Congress, but in general. Sometimes I wonder if people even value it as something that they cherish. But certainly Greg does. He is not only humble, he really cares about everyone, and he is not just out for himself. I also want to thank his wife, Mylene, for sharing him with us for all these years. We are going to miss Greg, and we will miss Mylene also. Greg, I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors. I have been hearing different rumors from other Members. Earl actually told me about some trip you took in the mountains in Oregon. Everybody is sort of secret about these different things that he is doing, but I suspect that they are going to be endeavors that he loves and that, when I hear about them, will be fantastic. I just feel bad about even making this speech about his leaving, but that is the way it is, and I am going to miss him. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. To my friends in this assembly, thank you for your friendship. To the chairman of the committee, we have developed a wonderful relationship. Sometimes your staff and our staff spar, but we are a family, and families do disagree from time to time. But generally speaking, we are headed in the same direction, and that direction is making America a better place for everyone and solving problems. So I am very thankful for your very generous and kind comments, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I will say it has been a real delight and joy to work with the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I would have to admit it was a more delight and joy to work with the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee when I was chairman, but that is the way of the world, and that is democracy. We switched roles and handed off the gavel in peace, and we began to approach issues from a different angle but with the same mission. Mr. Speaker, as 2020 comes to a thankful close--I think we are all ready to get it behind us--so does my 22 years of public service in this incredible crucible of democracy, the United States House of Representatives. I want to start by thanking my wife of 38 years, and our son, who is 30, Mylene and Anthony. They have always supported me during my three decades of State and Federal service, all the campaigns, all the meetings, and all the times away. I know my colleagues will understand this when I say I will never fully understand all that they sacrificed so that I could fulfill my duty in office, but I do know it was a lot. I also want to thank my terrific staff over the years, and especially those who helped me build and lead such successful organizations, including my two personal office chiefs of staff of over 22 years, Brian MacDonald and Lorissa Bounds, terrific leaders both; my executive directors at the NRCC when I ran the Republican campaign organization, Liesl Hickey and Rob Simms; and my staff directors at the Energy and Commerce Committee. You have heard of the late great Ray Baum, my colleague dating clear back to the late eighties in the Oregon Legislature and then all the way through [[Page H7091]] just a couple years ago when he passed away of cancer. Mike Bloomquist and Ryan Long also did such terrific work heading up the best committee in Congress. I want to thank the professional staff, many of whom have been on the floor today, my personal staff in Oregon and Washington, D.C. We rely so much on these very smart and talented people, and the country is well-served by their work. I want to thank the thousands of volunteers and supporters of my campaigns over the years. We did it together, and I would like to believe we did it for the right reasons: to leave our State and to leave our country better places than we found them. I also want to thank some important mentors in my life. Of course, I would have to start with my parents, who grew up with nothing during the Great Depression. They taught me the importance of giving back to the community, of working hard, and of always being honest and seldom being judgmental. I want to thank those along the way who gave me some interesting career opportunities. My freshman year in college was spent at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. I want to thank the folks at KTVF and the old KFRB Mighty Ninety in Fairbanks who put a 17-year-old kid in charge of producing and directing the 11 o'clock TV news. I had never been in a TV studio before, and suddenly, as a freshman in college, I was working every night doing that. To Roger Martin, Vic Atiyeh, Gary Wilhelms, and Denny Smith, I learned so much from working for each of you. To former Oregon Speaker Larry Campbell, time and again you showed Oregon how principled leadership produces good results. So it was great sport serving alongside you in the Oregon House. Of course, I want to thank the church, school, and scout leaders who influenced my life in such a positive way. I would give a shout-out to the late Earl Fowler. He was my high school vice principal and student body officer adviser whose counsel, when I was student body president at Hood River Valley High School, was as valuable then as it is now. I remember one of the things he told us as student leaders was: ``When there is a leadership vacuum, fill it.'' He expected us to step up, to lead, and to take on challenges. I am indeed thankful for the opportunity the people of Oregon have given me to represent them in the United States House of Representatives. It is a responsibility I have always taken seriously as I faithfully tried to do my best to represent them. After all, this is their office, not mine. I was simply entrusted to use the powers bestowed upon it for their benefit, something I never forgot. It is part of why I have returned home nearly every weekend and will soon--whenever we wrap up business here--complete my 644th round trip back home. My team and I put special emphasis on taking care of the men and women who wear or have worn our Nation's uniform and defended America's freedom: We helped thousands of Oregon veterans and families receive the benefits they earned and deserved. We worked to strengthen the mission at Kingsley Air Field and open veterans clinics throughout the community and the district. We helped save the veterans facility in White City. America is blessed to have those brave men and women who risk their lives so that we can enjoy ours in peace. America owes them a debt we can never fully repay. Having grown up on a cherry orchard outside of The Dalles, Oregon, I always had great admiration for those who farm and ranch and feed us. I worked hard to protect their way of life, defending farmers and ranchers from bad policy proposals. I stood up for their water rights. I protected their land and ranching way of life. I am especially proud of the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act and the collaborative approach that it envisioned. Moreover, I supported ag research and water conservation efforts throughout the district. And while we made much progress on both fronts, my one regret is that we could never find the key to unlocking a durable and fair solution to the water crisis in the Klamath Basin that could also pass in the Congress. We did make progress to improve forest management, even though I am disappointed Congress has dragged its feet in enacting much-needed reforms to make our Federal forests healthier and more resilient to climate change. It was 17 years ago last week that President Bush signed the Healthy Forest Restoration Act into law. Hopefully, in the next Congress, you all will heed the guidance of our Yale forestry graduate and colleague, Bruce Westerman, to modernize how we manage this great American resource before the rest of it goes up in smoke. Having spent 6 years as chair of the Telecommunications Subcommittee, I am really proud of the bipartisan work we did together to open up spectrum for advanced communications; enact FirstNet, our first responders' new interoperable broadband network; and to expand access to high-speed internet, although much work still remains to fully connect all Americans to high-speed broadband. With the RAY BAUM'S Act, we even reauthorized and modernized the FCC, and, as you heard, that hadn't been done in a couple of decades. When I had the great privilege and honor to chair the Energy and Commerce Committee, we took on the deadly epidemic of drug overdose and combined more than 60 bipartisan pieces of legislation into the SUPPORT Act, which, while focused on the opioid crisis, actually was much bigger than that and provided support for our communities to help all with addiction. We modernized our mental health laws, stepped up medical research, and fully funded the Children's Health Insurance Program for a decade-- something that had never been done before. We modernized the FDA and its approval processes for medicines and medical devices, and thank goodness we did. Some of these changes have already proven their value during this pandemic. I am proud to have done my part to help enact Medicare part D, which finally brought more affordable medicines to America's seniors. While we need to update this law, it is a fact that Medicare part D has been a godsend to seniors who no longer have to board buses to foreign countries to get lifesaving medicines. We also unleashed a cleaner energy revolution in America that created thousands of new jobs and reduces America's carbon emissions, too. Energy innovation holds the opportunity for a strong economy and a healthier environment. Mr. Speaker, as you can tell, I am pretty passionate about good public policy, and I have really enjoyed this opportunity in serving with all of you. I think we can use our resources we have among ourselves in Congress to get good things done for the American people. It wasn't easy to decide to voluntarily leave this wonderful institution, but I had long ago decided I didn't want to get voted out--and I don't think that was going to happen--or carried out. I was confident I would win reelection, and my health is good, so I leave on my own terms, feeling good about that which I have helped improve in the lives of those who entrusted me election after election. I leave feeling positive about the ability to get good policy done right here in the U.S. House of Representatives. In fact, we just worked through a slate of bipartisan bills again today. I will miss this process, and I will miss you, my colleagues. Always remember how important the work you do here is and how much the fate of the American way of life rests in your hands every time you put that voting card in one of these machines. I am a big fan of Theodore Roosevelt. His writings have also had an impact on my life. Just as my high school adviser encouraged us to fill leadership vacuums, so did Roosevelt laud those who climbed into the arena. So I close with President Roosevelt's words: ``It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to [[Page H7092]] do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.'' God bless you, my colleagues, family, and friends, and may God bless the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for passage of the bill, and I also yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7898, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consider certain recognized security practices of covered entities and business associates when making certain determinations, and for other purposes.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________"
