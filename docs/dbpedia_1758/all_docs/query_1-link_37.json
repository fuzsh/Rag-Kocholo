        "text": "K\n\nKemp DeVille posted a condolence\n\nLonnie was a great friend. What fun we had during our youthful years. We, and our group of friends. Such fond memories. Sadly, I lost touch, and rarely saw Lonnie during his adult years. May God keep his soul. May he sail on pristine heavenly waters. Kemp DeVille Wilmington, NC seacoast@ec.rr.com\n\nS\n\nSam Sanders posted a condolence\n\nMy earliest memories with Lonnie were listening to music, played too loud, in his bedroom that he had painted black. Lonnie was always cool. Lonnie was independent and could be a private person, but once he let you in it was a bond for life. Early on there was a group of us that were really tight. They included Kemp DeVille, Gary Huffman (RIP), Bill Kelley, Mike Summers, Curt Leasor, and of course my sister Jane. There were lots of camping trips, projects, and of course, rock concerts. Good times. Time would pass, girlfriends, wives, and later children would change the landscape but the bond would remain. Lonnie was the best man at my wedding. I loved him like a brother. I will miss him and wish that we could have relived these memories together. Rock on Lonnie. I love you man! Sam Sanders"
