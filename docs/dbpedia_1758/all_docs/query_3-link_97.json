        "text": "Ted Kaizer is Professor in Roman Culture and History. He was educated at Leiden (MA, 1995) and Brasenose College, Oxford (DPhil, 2000), and held a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (2002-2005) before coming to Durham. His main research interest is the social and religious history of the Near East in the Late Hellenistic and Roman period. He is the author of The Religious Life of Palmyra (Stuttgart, 2002) and has written articles on various aspects of religion and history of the Classical Levant. He is the editor of Blackwell's forthcoming Companion to the Hellenistic and Roman Near East. His present research project concerns a study of the social patterns of worship at Dura-Europos, a fortress town on the Middle Euphrates, and in this context he has also produced the historiographical introductions to two volumes in the Bibliotheca Cumontiana for the Academia Belgica in Rome: Scripta Minora VII, Franz Cumont's collected articles and reviews: D. Praet, T. Kaizer and A. Lannoy (eds.), Doura-Europos (Leuven, 2020 in press), p.XI-XCVIII; and Scripta Maiora XI, the republication of Cumont's 1926 monograph Fouilles de Doura-Europos, 1922-1923 (series editor C.
