        "text": "Dismiss the matter\n\nThe complainant alleged that the materials he received from the Oregon-Washington Veteran Action Committee appeared to be the result of PAC activity. The complainant also found that the committee wasn’t registered with the Federal Election Commission. The Commission decided to exercise its prosecutorial discretion and dismiss the matter. Chairman Thomas and Commissioners Mason, McDonald and Weintraub issued a Statement of Reasons.\n\nDocuments from this matter are available from the Commission’s web site at http://www.fec.gov by entering 5519 under case number in the Enforcement Query System. They are also available in the FEC’s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.\n\nNo reason to believe*\n\nThe complaint alleged that the third criterion used by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which is that each candidate have the support of at least 15% of the electorate as determined by five national public opinion polling organizations violated election law and the complainant’s constitutional rights. The complainant claimed that the use of polling results to determine which candidates to invite to the debates is “partisan” and a deliberate attempt to exclude those candidates who theoretically could win the election based on their ballot access. The Commission found no reason to believe the Commission on Presidential Debates violated the law.\n\nDocuments from this matter are available from the Commission’s web site at http://www.fec.gov by entering 5530 under case number in the Enforcement Query System. They are also available in the FEC’s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington."
