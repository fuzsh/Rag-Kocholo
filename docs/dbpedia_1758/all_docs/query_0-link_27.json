        "text": "The new maps, which were passed just hours before the legislature would have lost the right to pass them, are now being challenged in court.\n\nBEAVERTON, OR — For members of the Oregon Legislature, passing the new redistricting maps this year had been a high wire exercise in which one misstep would have resulted in the make up of their districts falling under control of a panel of retired judges. Turns out, judges will still play a role.\n\nFour prominent former Republican officials sued to have the new districts declared unconstitutional.—\n\nLive in Beaverton?
