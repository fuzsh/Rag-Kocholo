        "text": "It may seem strange today to study aspects of the political sphere—from foreign policy to diplomacy and the military—in the context of sexuality. But the Belle Epoque (1871–1914) was an era of prestige politics, also with respect to the politics of sexuality. This article reveals how the Eulenburg Scandal of 1906 to 1909 used sexual morality as a way to explain and interpret the tensions that pervaded Germany's domestic affairs and international relations. The reliance on sexual mores as an explanation for large-scale political events was the result of an ever-intensifying chain of national and international complications—complications that later undermined Germany's sense of national honor. The Eulenburg Scandal is remembered today mainly as the first major homosexual scandal of the twentieth century, but contemporaries experienced it in a wider sense: it became Germany's counterpart to the Dreyfus Affair in France—two examples of political, social, and cultural conflict that threatened the foundations of their respective countries.\n\n6 For a useful historiography of masculinities, see Dickinson, Edward R. and Wetzell, Richard, “The Historiography of Sexuality in Modern Germany,” German History 23, no. 3 (2005)CrossRefGoogle Scholar: 291. Also see George L. Mosse, Nationalism and Sexuality: Respectability and Abnormal Sexuality in Modern Europe (New York: Fertig, 1985); Idem, Das Bild des Mannes. Zur Konstruktion der modernen Männlichkeit (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1997), 91. On the German peculiarities, see Rüdiger Lautmann and Angela Taeger, eds., Männerliebe im alten Deutschland. Sozialgeschichtliche Abhandlungen (Berlin: Verlag Rosa Winkel, 1992).\n\n30 Holstein wrote that Harden had flown into a tantrum when he heard that Lecomte had been invited to Liebenberg. See von Holstein, Friedrich, Lebensbekenntnis in Briefen an eine Frau, ed. Rogge, Helmuth (Berlin: Ullstein, 1932)Google Scholar, 296. Harden's press campaign began two weeks later, on November 24, 1906. During the trial, it was revealed that Lecomte had been invited to the hunt at Liebenberg on the express wish of Wilhelm II. See Friedländer, Interessante Kriminal-Prozesse, 4163.\n\n31 In reality, the peaceful intentions of Wilhelm II during the Morocco Crisis reached France from the envoy of the Welfen-dynasty, Hermann von Hodenberg, and from the Center Party deputies Franz von Arenberg and Emile Wetterlé. In addition, a file on Moroccan policy that contained a revealing comment by the Kaiser—“But no war because of this!”—was stolen from the Foreign Office. See Mayer, Martin, Geheime Diplomatie und öffentliche Meinung.

Zur Semantik geschichtlicher Zeiten (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1989), 349–75Google Scholar.
