Because it is illegal for corporations or State Chapter PACs to directly contribute to federal candidates or to political parties, MAC PAC allows you the opportunity to have a national impact on federal elections. This is possible by pooling our resources and dealing from a position of collective strength.\n\nAnyone can contribute up to $5,000 in a calendar year to MAC PAC.\n\nIf you would like to voluntarily contribute to MAC PAC, please download the form below or donate online:\n\nDownload MAC PAC Contribution and Authorization Form\n\nOnline MAC PAC Contribution\n\nCriteria for Candidate Support\n\nThe MAC PAC bases its decisions on which candidates receive its support on specific criteria as follows:\n\nMCAA voting record\n\nIssue strategy\n\nIn-person candidate interviews\n\nCandidate questionnaires\n\nVariable race factors\n\nA candidate’s political party affiliation is not a criterion for support.\n\nMAC PAC contributions to candidates vary in dollar amount depending upon all of the determining factors mentioned above.\n\nMAC PAC is registered with the Federal Election Commission and files reports of all receipts and candidate contributions. These reports become part of the public record at the FEC.\n\nLegislative Victories\n\nThe MCAA has won many legislative victories over the past few years with the help of many MCAA member companies, including:\n\nRepeal of the 3% government withholding tax\n\nPermanently addressed the “patch” to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) by indexing the AMT to inflation\n\nMajor step forward in permanently extending the estate tax exemption level at $5 million per spouse, indexing the exemption level for inflation, capping the tax rate at 40 percent and allowing for spousal portability\n\nIncluding life-cycle costing (LCC) related to Military Construction projects\n\nLife-cycle costing as a part of OMB’s Circular A-94 (Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs)\n\nBut our work does not stop with those victories. We need your continued engagement and input as we continue to take the voice of the masonry industry to Washington, D.C.\n\nCandidate Contributions\n\nMAC PAC is able to give $5,000 per federal candidate per election (primary, general or run-off). MAC PAC is not restricted to an aggregate contribution limit on all candidates supported.\n\nMAC PAC will never support more than one candidate in a race.\n\nPAC contributors and chapters are not only asked but encouraged to deliver the MAC PAC checks directly to the candidates in the district.\n\nParticipation in MAC PAC is strictly voluntary.\n\nMAC PAC Donors\n\n2024\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2023\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\n2022\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\n2021\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\n2020\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\n2019\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\n2018\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCapitol Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2017\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCapitol Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2016\n\nPresident’s Club\n\nCapitol Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2015\n\nCapitol Club\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2014\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2013\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2012\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2011\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2010\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2009\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\n2008\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2007\n\nCapitol Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2006\n\nCongressional Club\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nDirector’s Club\n\nGrassroots Club\n\n2005\n\nExecutive’s Club\n\nMAC PEC Donors\n\n2019\n\n$5,000\n\n2016\n\n$250 - $499\n\n2015\n\n$3,000 - $4,999\n\n$1,200 - $2,999\n\n$500 - $1,199\n\n2014\n\n$1,200 - $2,999\n\n2013\n\n$250 - $499\n\n$100 - $249\n\n2012\n\n$500 - $1,199\n\n$250 - $499\n\n$100 - $249\n\n2011\n\n$500 - $1,199\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n$250 - $499\n\n$100 - $249\n\n2007\n\n$500 - $1,199\n\n$250 - $499\n\n$100 - $249\n\n2006\n\n$500 - $1,199\n\n$250 - $499\n\n$100 - $249\n\n2005\n\n$1,200 - $2,999"
