        "text": "Picked up a vinyl copy of kind of blue brand new on DOL records at a cost of £10 from a shop called head in the uk. I have listened to it a few times and don't think it's anything special, a little flat.\n\nI have also listened many times to a copy on Cd that I have owned for for 5years or so, it's a remastered special edition bla bla...I remember enjoying this more.\n\nSo my question is what version/grade should I be looking for on vinyl to get the best sound quality?\n\nI suspect DOL is an EU-loophole pirate, i.e. exploiting the 50 year copyright lifespan in the EU. Chances are it's never been anywhere even close to a master-tape. I'd expect any legit copy to be on CBS/Sony/Columbia or a credible audiophile reissue label. Sadly there is nothing stopping anyone selling a copy of say KOB that they made using a stretched coffee stained cassette or whatever as a \"master\". It's a minefield out there.\n\nown a couple of Columbia Lp's and recently bought the remastered 2 disc CD - these are both exceptional music and wonderful sounding. Also bought one of the European pressings and would agree - VERY silent vinyl but sure does sound like the master mighta been a not very high quality MP3. My old and abused copies are much noisier - but way more pleasant to listen to despite their abuse/flaws.And I enjoy the CD more than the Euro press version.\n\nI just picked up a copy of the record store day mono vinyl. It's my 6th copy of KoB - a mix of CD and vinyl- and by far the best. There's a little crackle on the first ten seconds of side 1 but apart from that pretty silent.\n\nI've got the mono vinyl of three Miles records and they're all worth having and have a deeper sound than the stereo mixes. The bass on KoB is much fuller sounding than on any of the other versions I own and the whole thing sounds more coherent - much like the mono Someday My Prince Will Come or Round About Midnight.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00GD98EOQ/?tag=pinkfishmedia-21\n\nPlenty in the market place at good prices.\n\nMust get a copy of Milestones at some point but I sense CBS have remastered these with some care.\n\nKevin\n\nThis issue comes up a fair amount. I'm relatively new to jazz vinyl and find it to be an absolute minefield. When I first started buying, I got KOB on Columbia (180g) and it's great but I bought Coltrane's \"Blue Train\" on 180g (\"Not Now\") label and, though it's not bad, it's just missing that magic in the astmosphere that I really enjoy from that era and I find myself hardly ever playing it as a consequence. I suspect it's from the CD - must get a \"proper\" copy of that one!\n\nI really wish new releases would declare their sources. The number of times I've seen a reasonably cheap copy of \"Somthin' Else\" and after ferreting around, found out that it's been \"digitally remastered\". Finally found a good price on a Blue Note one yesterday. Hopefully it *really is* on Blue Note when it turns up.\n\nAs well as useful recommendations here, I've found the Steve Hoffman forums to be a good source of info on which version to buy, though they can be inclined towards the expensive end of things.\n\nFWIW my advice / recommendation is to avoid current Miles (and in fact all vintage jazz) vinyl unless you know *exactly* what pressings you are hunting and simply buy the Perfect Miles Davis Collection on CD. It is staggeringly good value and beautifully mastered. The KOB in there sounds great to my ears, and I say that as someone with both the Classic Records 2xLP and a Nimbus Supercut of that title. Once you've finished playing KOB you'll find many other equally amazing Miles albums lurking in the box!\n\nI suspect DOL is an EU-loophole pirate, i.e. exploiting the 50 year copyright lifespan in the EU. Chances are it's never been anywhere even close to a master-tape.\n\nCorrect. They've issued over 100 titles in eighteen months, none of which are licensed/authorised, and all of which will be CDs with surface noise. They've seen a market and are exploiting it.\n\nI just snagged the mono copy referred to in the prior post. That one sounds like it could be especially good to me, Mikey seems to like it! Thanks for the reminder, got the last one from Soundstage Direct with a 10% Presidents' Day coupon. It will be nice to have a clean and super quiet \"mono\" mix.\n\nSo it's a minefield then mostly\n\nNot really, the ones to buy, if you can afford them are two eye Columbia mono or the six eye Columbia stereo original pressings or the CBS 62096 UK press which I've got and which will cost you about £20 or so for a decent copy.\n\nA decent six eye mono original isn't too expensive either BTW.\n\nOr you could buy the ones I linked to at £20 plus postage and tax from the US for the mono release or about £45 for the MOFI 45 rpm 2 X LP one when it is released here, there are a few other good re-issues too like the Classic release from the 90s or the 50th anniversary release.\n\nTony\n\nInteresting reading the analogue planet article. The mono press of KoB was released or the November record store day 2013, as was the (very good) music on vinyl edition. The MoV appears to be CBS pressing in all but the spine on the sleeve and a small logo. Are MoV franchised to market and distribute all CBS vinyl in the UK? Do CBS do any vinyl direct? There's a lot of CBS represses in my local store in Oxford, all with the MoV logo - and all a lot better than the Waxtime editions in HMV. I bought Someday My Prince Will Come on Waxtime first but it was horribly digital sounding and I'm 99% sure from a cd source. I then got the mono MoV which is quite sublime.\n\nIf the MoV is the same as the edition in the article you can get it on Amazon marketplace for under £15 - and it'll be money well spent. The link is in my earlier post. Tbh I can't believe they are different pressings.\n\nIf you read the article that I linked to the comments below refer to the MOV mono version that someone in Portugal bought and the consensus seems to be that version isn't as good sounding as the RSD US release, that's why I haven't bought the MOV mono version.\n\nScott Nangle has a load of versions for sale but he doesn't have the RSD version or the new 2 X LP 45RPM version.\n\nTony\n\nhttp://snvinyl.co.uk/epages/eshop943300.sf/en_GB/?ObjectID=26158711&ViewAction=ViewProduct\n\nhttp://snvinyl.co.uk/epages/eshop943300.sf/en_GB/?ObjectID=23323788&ViewAction=ViewProduct\n\nThis one is the US RSD stereo version I think\n\nhttp://snvinyl.co.uk/epages/eshop943300.sf/en_GB/?ObjectID=24606076&ViewAction=ViewProduct\n\nThe two LP version which hasn't been released yet I believe\n\nhttp://snvinyl.co.uk/epages/eshop943300.sf/en_GB/?ObjectID=23275406&ViewAction=ViewProduct\n\nYeah saw that. It mentions the European RSD but they don't seem to have played it or compared to US RSD version. Just interested in the relation between UK and US RSD editions. It looks like they could be the same remaster but with the MoV pressed in The Netherlands under license. That doesn't in itself mean it would be inferior to a US pressing if the masters were the same. They were both released on the same day. Mine is numbered as part of a release of 1500. It would be interesting to get a side by side comparison...\n\nMoV do facsimile covers so have v little info on mastering etc, just original studio details.\n\nEither way mine sounds better than my late 70s sunrise CBS vinyl and the speed corrected stereo cd so it makes me pretty happy\n\nPs: Just checked on Hoffman - see 4th post\n\nhttp://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threa...limited-edition-legacy-vs-movlp.335929/page-2\n\nKevin\n\nYeah saw that.
