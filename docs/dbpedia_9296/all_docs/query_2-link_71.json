Considered as one of the 20th century's most influential musicians, several of his former bandmates went on to successful careers, including Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, and Herbie Hancock. His style of \"cool jazz\" and \"be-bop\" revolutionized music in the 1940s & 1950's. His album, Kind of Blue is officially (per the RIAA) the biggest selling jazz album of all-time, and led to it being declared as a \"national treasure\" by a unanimous vote of the House of Representatives in 2009. His career spanned six decades, but he took a sabbatical in 1976 that would last five years, due to his increasing drug use (which he battled since the 1950s), which he stopped after rekindling an old flame with Cicely Tyson in 1979. He would collaborate with the New Wave fixtures during that era, including Scritti Politti, Public Image Ltd., then contributed to the Artists United Against Apartheid recordings in the mid-1980s. He then branched into film, appearing in Vice, then in the movie Scrooged (with David Johansen), then his final film appearance (and final performance) in 1990's Dingo, filmed in Australia. Davis was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nPersonal Life/Death[]\n\nDavis was married to Betty Mabry (1944-2022), a model from 1968 until their divorce in 1969, then married Tyson in 1981, divorcing in 1988. He also had two children from another relationship. In 1991 Davis suffered a stroke, and combined with pneumonia & respiratory failure, Davis died on September 28, 1991, at the age of 65."
