        "text": "Midway through “Miles Ahead,” the soon-to-be-released movie about Miles Davis, directed by and starring Don Cheadle, the famously irascible musician tells a freelance writer (played by Ewan McGregor) in a dowdy corduroy blazer, “You’re not driving me around looking like that no more.”\n\nIt’s 1979. Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Getaway” had just been blasting on the stereo in Davis’s West 77th Street apartment. He slides open the door to a walk-in closet and the journalist sees a collection of silks, furs, scarves and lamé jackets.\n\n“From Brooks Brothers sharp to Issey Miyake prints, leather and bright colors, Miles wore it all and was always cool doing it,” Mr. Cheadle said. “He made the clothes.”\n\nGersha Phillips, the costume designer who also made all the clothes for “Miles Ahead,” including a kimono in habutai, did not know how fashionable the trumpeter was until she started her research. “I was quite amazed,” she said. “I just feel like he was always forward-thinking, and just the way he was with his music he was with fashion: ahead of his time.”\n\nThe main action takes place as Davis is considering a comeback after a five-year, self-imposed exile on the Upper West Side, with deft swings back to the 1950s and ’60s. No matter the decade — as a sideman to Charlie Parker in the 1940s; birthing cool jazz with Gil Evans in the early ’50s; moving further ahead with John Coltrane in the late-’50s and then the mid-’60s, before an electric period from 1968-75 — Davis is the focal point, in part because of what he wore.\n\nWith Davis, it wasn’t a case of style over substance. His style was essential to his substance.\n\n“His music, of course, everyone is familiar with,” said Marcus Miller, the bassist, composer and producer who was part of Davis’s band in 1980. “But when I knew him, he was painting as much as playing, and that was a real reflection of him, as well — and then his clothes. It was all the same thing. It was a statement of who he was and how he wanted to present himself.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
