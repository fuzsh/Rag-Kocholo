        "text": "This is Bluescentric Brand's official Miles Davis store, carrying Miles Davis t-shirts, coffee mugs, music, merchandise, and gifts.\n\nBluescentric Brand official Miles Davis t-shirts are available in a variety of colors, and sizes ranging from Small to 5XL. We also carry Miles Davis shirts in women's tees, tank tops, and crops in sizes up to 2XL, plus children's, XLT, 2XLT and 3XLT sizes.\n\nArguably the most accomplished trumpet player in history, Miles Davis' body of work spans nearly fifty years. Born just east of Saint Louis in Illinois, Miles went to music school in New York City -- mostly to find & learn from jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker, setting off a course of events that would change popular music forever.\n\nMiles worked at his profession for over ten years before collaborating with Gil Evans on diverse works like Miles Ahead in 1957, Sketches of Spain in 1960, and the best-selling Jazz album of all time -- Kind of Blue in 1959.\n\nWhile Davis started in Jazz, his wide array of influence couldn't be confined to one genre. During his \"Electric Period\", Miles released the platinum-selling Bitches Brew, the beautiful rock-n-roll styled tribute to Jack Johnson, and performed to new audiences at venues like the legendary Fillmore East & West.\n\nMiles won eight Grammy Awards, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990, inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, and in 2014, 77th Street in New York was renamed \"Miles Davis Way\" in honor of the trumpet player's longtime residence on the street.\n\nNew Miles Davis merchandise is released often. \"Limited edition\" shirts are only available for a limited time or in a limited quantity."
