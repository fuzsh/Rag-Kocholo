        "text": "A modal masterpiece from 1959, Kind of Blue is a true classic that never gets old, no matter how many times you listen to it. Bill Evans’ understated piano is the perfect foil for Miles’ melodies, contrasted by the soaring alto sax of Cannonball Adderley; Jimmy Cobb and Paul Chambers keep the rhythm section steady but unobtrusive, allowing Miles and Cannonball to shine. ‘So What’ and ‘Freddie Freeloader’ are seductive, deceptive gems, imparting all the frustration, begrudging and joy as only a great jazz record can; ‘Blue In Green’ and ‘All Blue’ have melancholy hues and ‘Flamenco Sketches’ a precursor to Sketches Of Spain. Every household should have at least one copy of Kind Of Blue, one of the greatest records ever made.\n\nTracklist\n\nSIDE A"
