        "text": "A never before heard series of live recordings, provisionally titled “MILES to go“, has been discovered in an abandoned filing cabinet in a derelict Los Angeles building, let at one time to Fantasy Records.\n\nThe recordings were commissioned by music entrepreneur Alfred Weinerstein. On the back of the success of Miles Columbia club dates, Live at The Blackhawk, and Live at The Plugged Nickel, the newly discovered recordings were intended to introduce Miles to a more diverse blue-collar family audience, through popular fast-food joints.\n\nThe plan was that after evening sessions in Greenwich Village clubs, Miles would take the quintet downtown to perform an impromptu live set for diners queuing for burgers or pizza, recorded by Van Gelder’s mobile recording studio truck.\n\nSeveral unmarked tape boxes were found in the back of the dusty filing cabinet. The McDonald’s session had apparently reached the stage of Van Gelder mastering. A test pressing, made at Prestige’s regular pressing plant Abbey Mfg. in New Jersey, was discovered inside a jacket.\n\nhttps://londonjazzcollector.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/miles-davis_live-at-mcdonalds_miles-to-go_ljc.mp3\n\n. . .\n\nAccording to Miles hand-written notes, the complete series was planned to include live sessions at Pizza Hut, K.F.C., and further venues would later include Dunkin’ Donuts and Wendy’s.\n\nMiles Unknown “Public Service Programme” . . .\n\nAmong other papers found in the abandoned filing cabinet, it seems Weinerstein had been approached by New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. who was up for re-election. Jazz fan Wagner invited Miles to perform a number of live sessions at select public venues, in a programme to modernise the image of essential but under-appreciated New York City services. Provisional venues discussed for The Quintet included the Chief Medical Examiner’s mortuary service – Live at The Morgue, and the city cremation services at Fresh Ponds Middle Village, Live at the Crematorium.\n\nThe clock ran out on negotiations when the Quintet had to travel at short notice to Europe, to perform the Jazz Festival du Monde, Antibes, France, in late July 1963. The proposed public service sessions were never realized, as Mayor Wagner was subsequently unseated by Republican Rep. John Lindsay, who unfortunately for Weinerstein, had a preference for Country music.\n\nMILES to go, gone\n\nThe MILES to go programme was finally abandoned by Weinerstein after Columbia, who held Miles under contract, withdrew the courtesy agreement for Miles fast food appearances, to play only in more prestigious high-ticket venues.\n\nOf interest to serious collectors, covers for the MILES to go volumes had already been prepared for Weinerstein, and sample copies were found in the cabinet, which have never been seen – until now.\n\nPLP 700001 MILES to go Volume 2: Live At Pizza Hut\n\nPRLP 70002 Miles to go Volume 3, Live at K.F.C.!\n\nLive At Kentucky Fried Chicken, “it’s Finger Lickin’ Good!”, wrapped up the first series,\n\nMosaic Records preserve the “Fast Food” sessions\n\nMichael Cuscuna’s Mosaic Records have done their usual scholarly job assembling a Limited Edition three album box set, MR3-101 The Complete MILES to go, pressed on tomato-red 180gm vinyl, complementary ketchup sachet and serviette included for the full evening dine-in experience.\n\nTen copies of Mosaic’s The Complete Miles to go Special LJC Edition are up for grabs exclusively for LJC readers.\n\nSimply click the Like button at the foot of this post to automatically register your chance to win a copy of this unique Miles Davis Quintet Fast Food Collection.\n\nTen lucky winners will have their boxset delivered direct to their door by Deliveroo (mainland US and Canada only; other territories, UPS).
