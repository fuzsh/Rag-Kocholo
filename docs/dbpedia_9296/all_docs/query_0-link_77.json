        "text": "Current Stock:\n\nAdding to cart… The item has been added\n\nAdd to Wish List\n\nCreate New Wish List\n\nDescription\n\nRolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time - Rated 31/500!\n\nOut Of Print! Only 1 copy available!\n\nTAS Recommended! Rated a 'Best Audiophile Label Recording' in the November 2009 issue of The Absolute Sound!\n\nYes, that's right, \"Kind of Blue\", the most successful Jazz album in history is back in print from Classic Records. To commemorate the official introduction of Classic Quiex SV - Super Vinyl, we thought it appropriate that \"Kind of Blue\" should be one of the titles to debut on the new vinyl formulation. We have also taken the opportunity to reissue \"Kind of Blue\", as it should have been in 1959 - completely at the proper speed! You might recall that Columbia discovered that side A of this legendary title had always been issued a quarter tone too sharp as a result of a faulty tape machine that was running slow at the sessions. A few years ago Columbia reissued \"Kind of Blue\" with the tunes originally on side A at the correct speed. Classic then reissued the title on LP with a novel twist. Realizing that the world, especially the vinyl world, was used to hearing side A at the wrong speed, we reissued \"Kind of Blue\" as a two record set - record 1 as it had always been complete with side A sharp, and record 2 with side A at the correct speed. We also coupled record 2 with the only complete outtake that exists from the sessions on the B side. The definitive Classic two record set (now extremely collectible) went out of print some time ago and since then we have been asked repeatedly to bring it back. So, rather than reissue the two record set we decided to make this release distinctive.\n\n\"This painterly masterpiece is one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz. At the time it was made, Kind of Blue was also a revolution all its own. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation  breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in the thick of hard bop.\" - www.rollingstone.com\n\nFirst, we have gone back to a single jacket that is a very authentic reproduction of the original - down to a printed paper on board construction rather than directly printed board. Also, this will be the first time in history that \"Kind of Blue\" will be issued on a single LP entirely at the correct speed. If that is not enough reason to get a copy of the re-release then consider that it will be pressed on Quiex SV-P 200g vinyl which will reveal even more of the music captured in the grooves by Bernie Grundman from the original three track session master tapes. This is another historic moment for Classic Records and \"Kind of Blue\". We are sure that Miles would approve so don't miss out!\n\nSelections:\n\n1. So What\n\n2. Freddie The Freeloader\n\n3. Blue In Green, All Blues\n\n4. Flamenco Sketches"
