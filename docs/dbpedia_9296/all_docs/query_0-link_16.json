        "text": "Press reviews\n\n\"Another live Miles Davis recording. Well, once the studio outtakes have dried up, this is the only seam left to mine. Happily, with advances in sound technology, old radio broadcasts are increasingly being dusted down and treated to a little digital TLC. Since 1983, Fresh Sounds Records has been a leading light in reissues and archival releases (see Fresh Sound Records and the Legacy of Recorded Jazz), in addition to producing many hundreds of contemporary artists. This one from Jordi Pujol's Barcelona label has rarity value, representing the first unabridged release of Davis' concert at the Olympia, Paris, in 1957. At this historic venue, the trumpeter was backed by top French musicians and old sparring partner from Minton's Playhouse days, drummer Kenny Clarke.\n\nThe set is a typical one for that time in Davis' trajectory—post-bop, swing, blues and ballads. Given that Davis had undergone a throat procedure just two months prior to this late-November date, he is in remarkably good form. Local musicians Rene Urtreger on piano, bassist Pierre Michelot and tenor saxophonist Barney Wilen are well up to the task. Wilen, who despite his youthful twenty years had already recorded an album as leader at the start of the year, had impressed Davis on the American's visit to Paris the year before, and little wonder. Listening to Wilen's solos on \"Tune Up\" and \"I'll Remember April,\" to pick just two gems, we hear a saxophonist confident enough not to be imitative.\n\nDavis sits out three songs—the hard-working Wilen plays overtime on \"Now's the Time\" but otherwise leads from the front, switching between mute and open bell on one extended solo after another. Fired up on \"No Moe\" and \"Bags' Groove,\" Davis is hauntingly tender on \"Round Midnight\" and \"What's New?\" This latter sounds like a ghostly forerunner of \"Blue in Green\" from Kind of Blue (Columbia, 1959), a tune generally credited to Bill Evans. Regardless of tempo, the trumpeter's playing is unfailingly emotive.\n\nMichelot and Urtreger enjoy their moments in the spotlight but impress most for locking in rhythmically with the dynamic Clarke. The great drummer, a Paris resident, is in wonderfully feisty mode, his trademark ride cymbal and bass-drum bombs driving the music and injecting an edge into otherwise fairly safe material. Notable too, however, is his subtly persuasive brushwork.\n\nFour days later this same line-up would go into the studio to record the music for Louis Malle's film \"Ascenseur pour l'eschafaud\" (Fontana, 1958). Almost entirely improvised, Davis' atmospheric noir soundtrack asks more of the musicians, and is the more remarkable recording for that. Still, the evident passion of this live performance from the Olympia, created in no small part by an engaged Parisian audience, makes In Concert at the Olympia, Paris 1957 a welcome extract from the Davis mine that keeps on giving.\"\n\n—Ian Pattson (January 7, 2024)\n\nhttps://www.allaboutjazz.com/\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\"On November 30, 1957, four days before trumpeter Miles Davis began recording the soundtrack to the French movie Ascenseur Pour L'echafaud, he performed at L'Olympia theater in Paris. He was backed by the Rene Urtreger Quartet, featuring Barney Wilen (ts), Rene Urtreger (p), Pierre Michelot (b) and Kenny Clarke (d) —the same musicians who would accompany him on the soundtrack.\n\nNow, for the first time, we have the entire performance in sterling 24-bit remastered audio, thanks to Jordi Pujol and his Fresh Sound label. While parts of the concert were previously released on gritty bootlegs and a private recording by Urtreger, this release marks the first high-quality commercial issuing of the music.\n\nThe quintet is remarkable for its exceptional individual players. Wilen was a superb modern tenor saxophonist, Michelot was a solid bassist and Clarke was a superstar expatriate and a founding father of bebop. Most interesting, the quartet behind Davis didn't try to emulate the sound of his working group with John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones, though Wilen and Coltrane did share a similar dry tone.\n\nIn addition, Davis sounds at ease and playing as beautifully as he would on the movie soundtrack days later. In part, I would attribute this to Paris and his long-running love affair with the city and French audiences' love affair with him.\n\nBut Davis' passion for Paris ran a little deeper. Nearly all of his trips there included an affair. In 1949, he was with actress-singer Juliette Gréco. In 1956, he formed a romantic attachment with Urtreger's sister, Jeanne De Mirbeck. And a year later, around the time of this recording, he had begun an affair with Ascenseur Pour L'echafaud's leading actress, Jeanne Moreau.\n\nDuring this trip, he also continued his affair with Urtreger's sister. “He was obsessed by sex, not by women,” she has said. “But when he was with me, he was with me.” During the tour, Davis wore her scarves on stage as keepsakes. Paris will do that to you.\n\nThe songs performed on the album are Solar, Four, What's New?, No Moe, Lady Bird, Tune Up, I'll Remember April, Bags' Groove, Round Midnight, Now's the Time, Walkin' and The Theme.\n\nAnother spectacular historical release of previously unisssued material that's first rate on every level. Kudos to Jordi and Fresh Sound.\"\n\n—Marc Myers (September 19, 2023)\n\nhttps://www.jazzwax.com/\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\"1957 was a very significant year for Miles Davis: he had recorded ‘Miles Ahead’ with Gil Evans in May; in December the ground breaking soundtrack recording for the film ‘Lift To The Scaffold’ was recorded. Just four days before that recording Miles played this concert at the Olympia in Paris. The musicians that he played with were the same that he used for the soundtrack recording.\n\nContracted to appear at the club Saint-Germain, Miles had left his usual group behind in New York. By 1957 he was famous enough to draw crowds on his own. He had been to Paris before and the group that he assembled included Barney Wilen, at just twenty, new to the scene. Pierre Michelot had played with Bechet and Clifford Brown. Urtreger played at the club and had accompanied Lester Young. Kenny Clarke on drums had redefined jazz drumming in the nineteen forties and had made Paris his home. In addition to working at the club, the group played concerts in Brussels, Amsterdam and Stuttgart.\n\nJournalist and trombone player Mike Zwerin went to the concert. He knew Miles having worked with him briefly on the nonet recordings in 1949. He wrote: ‘Miles was the big man...The Olympia Theatre was sold out that night…. Finally the curtain went up... They started playing Walkin and sounded fine... Barney took a tenor solo, and as he was finishing, backing away from the microphone, Miles appeared from the wings and arrived at the mike without breaking his stride, just in time to start to playing – strong. It was an entrance worthy of Nijinsky. If his choreography was good, his playing was perfect that night.’\n\nThree years earlier Miles had defeated his heroin addiction and now was in good health. His trumpet playing was hitting a peak. Like a lyric poet Miles’ playing had lucidity, fluency, a cool logic and passion. The cogency and the architectural quality of his solos was impressive. There was a questing, coherent, narrative shape to his playing that would culminate two years later in the Kind of Blue sessions.\n\nMiles was a dramatist. He compels attention to his playing on ‘What’s New’. The majesty and purity of the tone was a summons: an aspect that he would develop in the next few years. Here is an early example. The pretty tune is made beautiful, given depth. He not only varies the main line of the piece but his tone moves from almost a whisper to searing, searching high notes, always playing within himself.\n\nConfident and assertive, Miles approaches ‘Round Midnight’ not afraid to define the blue notes. His hand over phrase to Wilen is appropriate. Wilen has a tone that is close to Hank Mobley: there is warmth and an exploratory feel to his music.\n\nMiles’ solo is magnificent on ‘Bag’s Groove’. Urtreger’s playing takes his cue from Miles. When Miles returns, he plays call and response with himself for moments as he explores the tonal quality of the horn before reaching for the high notes. It is only ten years since Miles, ineffectual and lacking in confidence, played with Parker.\n\n‘Walkin’’ he played many times before; the rhythm is easy going. Miles picks the notes carefully exuding relaxation not afraid to go for the higher notes or to repeat ideas. The tone is clear, silvery brass. The contours of the tune fit well. He hands over to Wilen who is backed beautiful by Michelot and Clarke. Miles returns before the end exploring long notes with Clarke punctuating Miles’ musings.\n\nMiles would go a long way in the next thirty years. His influence on jazz would grow but it is doubtful if his trumpet playing would improve greatly over this bravura, luminous playing in Paris.\n\nSome of this material has been available on bootlegs. The recording of the concert is presented in its entirety for the first time. The remastered original tapes have been used to produce this album ensuring excellent sound quality.\"\n\n—Jack Kenny (September 21, 2023)\n\nhttps://jazzviews.net/\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________"
