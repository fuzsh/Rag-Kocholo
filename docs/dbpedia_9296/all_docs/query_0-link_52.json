        "text": "Miles Davis\n\nMiles Davis's name is synonymous with twentieth-century jazz. Alongside Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, he is one of the three most influential trumpet players in the history of jazz.\n\nMiles Dewey Davis got his first trumpet at the age of 9 or 10 and took lessons from Elwood Buchanan. By 1948 he had formed his own nine-piece band with a revolutionary new horn section of trumpet, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, trombone, French horn and tuba, backed by piano, bass and drums.\n\nEmploying arrangements by Gil Evans and others, this line-up - featuring Kai Winding, Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, J. J. Johnson and Kenny Clarke - recorded three seminal sessions that were later collected together on an LP under the title The Birth Of The Cool. The name was entirely appropriate, for this music marked a break with bebop and the emergence of a new 'cool' jazz style that was to prove hugely influential (represented on this collection by the tracks 'Jeru' and 'Boplicity').\n\nThe Columbia contract in the mid-1950s - the label he was to remain with for the next thirty years - enabled Davis to put together a stellar quintet featuring John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chamberand Philly Joe Jones. The period is represented on this Rough Guide collection by the tracks 'Nature Boy' and ''Round Midnight'. In 1957, Davis teamed up again with arranger Gil Evans on the album 'Miles Ahead', with a twelve-strong brass orchestra to create one of the great lyrical masterpieces of modern jazz (represented here by the title track, 'Blues For Pablo' and 'New Rhumba').\n\nWith saxophonist Cannonball Adderley added to the Coltrane, Garland, Chambers and Jones line-up to create the Miles Davis Sextet, he recorded the 1958 album Milestones (represented on this collection by the title track and 'Dr Jackle').\n\nAlternating his recordings between his quintet/sextet and orchestral albums, Davis teamed up again with the pianist/arranger Gil Evans on an album of masterful arrangements of music from Gershwin's 'Porgy And Bess' (heard here on magnificent takes on 'Summertime' and 'The Buzzard Song').\n\nWith a new line-up Miles Davis recorded 'Kind Of Blue', one of the most famous and influential landmarks in jazz history, which presaged a new form of modal jazz, full of sculpted elegance and profound mystery. This album - not only Davis's best-selling album, but the biggest-selling jazz album of all time&;mdashis represented on this compilation by 'Blue In Green' and 'Stella By Starlight', with which the Rough Guide compilation of Davis's early career concludes.\n\nMusicians\n\nCD1: Miles Davis: Birth Of A Legend\n\n01 The Miles Davis Nonet: Jeru (1949)\n\n02 The Miles Davis Nonet:Boplicity (1949)\n\n03 Miles Davis:Ezz-thetic (1951)\n\n04 The Miles Davis Quintet:Dear Old Stockholm (1952)\n\n05 Miles Davis:Nature Boy (1955)\n\n06 The Miles Davis Quintet:'Round Midnight (1956)\n\n07 Miles Davis:Miles Ahead (1957)\n\n08 Miles Davis:Blues for Pablo (1957)\n\n09 Miles Davis:New Rumba (1957)\n\n10 Miles Davis:Milestones (1958)\n\n11 The Miles Davis Sextet: Dr Jackie (1958)\n\n12 Miles Davis: Summertime (1958)\n\n13 Miles Davis: The Buzzard Song (1958)\n\n14 Blue In Green: (1959)\n\n15 Miles Davis: Stella By Starlight (1959)\n\nCD2 -Bonus CD: Jazz Giants\n\n01 Clark Terry Quintet: Donna Lee (1957)\n\n02 Coleman Hawkins: Wrap Up Your Troubles In Dreams (1945)\n\n03 Lee Konitz: Sound-Lee (1949)\n\n04 Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser (1951)\n\n05 Gerry Mulligan: Walking Shoes (1959)\n\n06 Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers: Moanin' (1958)\n\n07 Charles Mingus: Goodbye Pork Pie Hat (1959)\n\n08 Horace Silver: Sister Sadie (1959)\n\n09 John Coltrane: Blue Train (1957)"
