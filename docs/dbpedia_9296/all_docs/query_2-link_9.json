        "text": "Music, like water, finds its own course- ever flowing, seeking what is new and modern. Water is self-propelled; in music, there are those who arrive, push sound and style forward, and, for a few years, define the latest wave and deliver the newest of the new.\n\nMiles Dewey Davis III- trumpeter, visionary, and eternal modernist- was a force of nature. With an ear that disregarded categories of style, he sought out new musical worlds, and generation followed in his footsteps."
