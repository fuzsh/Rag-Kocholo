        "text": "By Bob Belden\n\nMiles Davis and Gil Evans were a team. They shared much in common musically and respected each other’s uniqueness. The sum was greater than the parts. The recorded legacy left behind by this team is one of the greatest in jazz. With their range of emotion and color, nuances and shadings, each one of these collaborations had a stunning impact. Not since Ellington had the sound of jazz been so dramatically altered.\n\nAlthough Ellington had written individual pieces based on and for certain soloists, Miles Ahead was the first concept album built upon the sound of the soloist, not the composer. It demonstrated Gil’s belief that Miles Davis extended the tradition of Louis Armstrong. Armstrong required of his arrangers to take into account all the elements of his sound; texture, range, harmonic language and emotion. Armstrong and Miles Davis were both capable of conveying this totality in their performances. Miles Ahead contained not only stunning and virtuosic music, but carried the seeds of future breakthroughs as well. The trumpet solo section of “New Rhumba” and the song “Blues For Pablo” predate “Milestones” as the first examples of Miles Davis soloing with only scales to improvise on. Tying all of the songs together with musical transitions so that the entire album could be experienced as one performance (or suite) was also a programming innovation.\n\nPorgy And Bess further defined Miles Davis as a storyteller and set the standard for the use of dramatic material in a jazz context. Sketches Of Spain was a high-concept album, a warm yet exotic mixture of cultures that brought out the North African influences in jazz. Again, Miles Davis was using scales and melodies to create the mood, but here the mood was the most important thing.\n\nJazz music up until this time, did not concern itself with mood and other such esoteric things; these were the days of hard bop. Swing and drive were important. Ballads were about the only mood pieces that hard bop bands dealt with. But Miles Davis concentrated on the overall result of a piece, not caring whether a standard format was used (head solos head, etc.) and this became a major development for jazz. Sketches Of Spain was not only a triumph, it proved to also be a Waterloo, a dead end of sorts for Miles Davis and Gil.\n\nThe results of Miles Davis’ and Gil’s collaborative efforts are justly praised for their innovations and beauty. There have been debates as to who influenced whom, and as to whether Gil’s triumphs with Miles Davis were ever duplicated with his own orchestra. Needless to say, the music could not have existed without both men considering themselves equals.\n\nMiles was given the context to further the reaches of his sound and Gil was given the canvas to paint, and they inspired each other to unforeseen heights. This Gil Evans and Miles Davis discography stands the test of time and will always be considered the finest music jazz has to offer. – Bob Belden, liner note excerpt Mosaic Records Miles Davis/Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings (11 LPs)\n\nBy Todd Coolman\n\nFrom late 1964 through the end of 1968, Miles Davis engaged in what is perhaps his most creative period in the midst of a musical career that spanned several stylistic genres. The second great quintet combined elements that encompassed the entire history of jazz, including group improvisation and interaction reminiscent of early jazz groups from the 1920s, new compositional forms that revolutionized the relationship between jazz composition and improvisation, and the phenomenal presence of a prodigy, drummer Tony Williams, whose revolutionary and unprecedented polyrhythmic approach served as the catalyst for the extraordinary creative expression that only the greatest jazz musicians of that era could have produced.\n\nIn discussing the drummer in the mid 60s, Herbie Hancock said, “Tony Williams was a phenomenon. Nobody was playing like him. He was creating a whole new approach to drumming and we actually ‘clicked’. We actually worked together very well. You know, Tony was one of the strongest elements in that band. I think a lot of what Miles told us…he put a lot of responsibility on the drums to give the band a certain fiery, dynamic personality.”\n\nBy 1967, Miles Davis had found and solidified the sound, style, and substance he had been searching for since 1964. The sessions of May through July of 1967 make a strong case for the assertion that the Miles Davis Quintet was the singular pivotal force in propelling jazz out of the bebop era and into the music of the ’70s and beyond.\n\nThe Quintessential Ensemble\n\nThroughout the history of jazz recordings, there have been several artists who have been prolific in both the number of compositions written and recordings produced. Some examples include Duke Ellington with Billy Strayhorn, Horace Silver, and Charles Mingus. But in each of these examples, the bandleaders were usually the sole composers.\n\nThe Miles Davis Quintet of the mid 1960s, on the other hand, is perhaps the only ensemble, before or since, that produced such a massive corpus provided by all five of its members, in a mere three-and-one half-year period between January of 1965 and June of 1968. This is yet another feature that sets this group apart from its contemporaries, including those of such giants as John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Horace Silver, and Art Blakey, to name a few.\n\nIn his autobiography, Miles Davis vividly recalled the excitement of being part of the singularly fertile collective that produced six landmark albums in less than four years, saying, “Every night Herbie, Tony, and Ron would sit around back in their hotel rooms, talking about what they had played until the morning came. Every night they would come back and play something different. And every night I would have to react. The music we did together changed every night; if you heard it yesterday, it was different tonight. Man, it was something how the music changed from night to night after awhile. Even we didn’t know where it was all going to. But we did know it was going somewhere else and that it was probably going to be hip, and that was enough to keep everyone excited while it lasted.”\n\nMiles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams had strong individual and group identities that forged a standard in small group jazz performance, remaining to this day as the pinnacle of the art form. Throughout his musical career, Miles Davis demonstrated an uncanny knack for being able to lead a band and at the same time allow the sidemen ample freedom so that he could also learn and grow from their combined creative output. Herbie Hancock recalled, “Miles was the teacher, but as a master teacher, Miles was also a learner. That’s something that Miles taught me. He was always listening to what we were playing and responding to what we were playing and reacting to what we were playing.”\n\nFor many musicians, critics, and jazz fans in more recent times, the members of this group have assumed the status of icons. They have come to represent the very best that group jazz improvisation and interplay have to offer. Not surprisingly, the mystique and conjecture regarding the life and times of this ensemble could probably fill a small library.\n\nIt was the combination of their love of and dedication to the music, their ability to selflessly play what the music called for, their consummate musicianship, and their confidence in one another that helped create one of the most singular musical evolutions in the history of jazz. “We had absolute trust in each other’s ability to respond to whatever would happen. In other words, you never fear that anything you might play would throw anyone off. You didn’t have to go through a real big editing process (while improvising). You could just throw something out there just because you felt it and you would know you could trust that something would come back”, recalled Hancock.\n\nOf course, this assemblage was the result of the foresight of one of the great leaders in any jazz movement, past or present. Miles Davis had the vision to allow each member of the group to make his distinctive contributions to the music by encouraging him to push the envelope creating extraordinary music to the Miles Davis discography. This leader had the willingness, even eagerness, to learn from younger, more adventurous and impressionable sidemen. He had the ability to assimilate new developments in the direction the music was taking and then expound upon it, showing his sidemen a vision of the music yet to be played, like a beacon. – Todd Coolman, liner note excerpt Mosaic Records The Complete Studio Recordings Of The Miles Davis Quintet 1965 – June 1968 (10 LPs)"
