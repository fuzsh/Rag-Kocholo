        "text": "OK, I got it. The \"Rudy, put all of it on the record\" incident is during the false start at the beginning of \"The Man I Love (Take 1)\" from the 1954 Christmas Eve session.\n\nAccording to Jazzdisco.org, it was this take that got originally issued on a 10-inch LP in 1955. If that's true, then this would be the first appearance of such studio chatter. The 12-inch LP it came out on is \"Miles And The Modern Jazz Giants\", which contained both takes 1 and 2. But that LP is from 1958, meaning i and Relaxin' had already been issued.\n\nBut here's what. What if Jazzdisco.org is wrong? To me, \"The Man I Love (Take 2)\" seems like the more likely candidate to have been released on the 10-inch. This is debatable, but I feel it's the better take.\n\nDoes anyone have the 10-inch? Can you confirm which take it is? And whether there is chatter at the start?\n\nEDIT: Listening to both takes again, I not so sure anymore. Maybe I'm biased towards Take 2 because that's it was the opener on the 12-inch.\n\n'Round About Midnight (1955-1956)\n\nColumbia CL 949, released March 1957\n\n...and here we are: Miles' first Columbia album, coinciding with the release of the new Miles Davis Original Mono Recordings box. Aren't we well timed?\n\nFrom Wikipedia, to put it in context all over again:\n\nAt the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, Davis performed the song \"'Round Midnight\" as part of an all-star jam session, with the song's composer Thelonious Monk, along with Connie Kay and Percy Heath of the Modern Jazz Quartet, Zoot Sims, and Gerry Mulligan. Davis's solo received an extremely positive reception from many jazz fans, and critics. It was viewed as a significant comeback and indication of a healthy, drug-free Miles (he had in fact been free from heroin addiction for well over a year). Miles's response to this performance was typically laconic: \"What are they talking about? I just played the way I always play.\" George Avakian of Columbia Records was in the audience, and his brother Aram persuaded him that he ought to sign Davis to the label. Davis was eventually signed to Columbia Records, and was able to form his famous \"first great quintet\" with John Coltrane on saxophone. 'Round About Midnight was to be his first album for his new label.\n\nDavis was still under contract to Prestige Records, but had an agreement that he could record material for Columbia to release after the expiration of his Prestige contract. The recording dates for the album were at Columbia Records studios; the first session was on October 26, 1955 at Studio D, during which the track \"Ah-Leu-Cha\" was recorded along with three other numbers which didn't make the album. This is the first studio recording of the quintet. The remainder of the album was recorded during sessions on June 5, 1956 (\"Dear Old Stockholm\", \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" and \"Tadd's Delight\") and September 10, 1956 (\"All of You\" and the titular \"'Round Midnight\") at Columbia's 30th Street Studio. During the same period, the Miles Davis Quintet was also recording sessions to fulfill its contract with Prestige.\n\nOn release, 'Round About Midnight received an average reception. Ralph Berton of The Record Changer described it as \"orthodox, middle-of-the-road conservative progressive jazz.\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings states that the recording \"sounds like a footnote\" to the Prestige contractual obligation sessions (eventually released as the albums Miles, Relaxin', Workin', Steamin', and Cookin'), and that \"the material is fine but somehow fails to cast quite the consistent spell which the Prestige recordings do.\"\n\nThroughout the years following its initial reception, 'Round About Midnight's standing among critics has improved significantly. Music writer Eugene Holley, Jr. later praised the album in a review, writing:\n\nStylistically, Midnight encompasses standards (or soon-to-be standards) such as \"Dear Old Stockholm\", \"Bye-Bye Blackbird\", Tadd Dameron's \"Tadd's Delight\", and Jackie McLean's forward-thinking composition \"Little Melonae.\" Miles and company reprise \"Budo\" from the historic Birth of the Cool sessions. The standout track is Davis's Harmon-muted reading of Thelonious Monk's ballad, \"'Round Midnight\", which is still a Miles standard bearer... If you want to hear the origins of post-bop modern jazz, this is it.​\n\nBob Rusch of Cadence wrote, \"everything about this date, from the black-and-white cover photo, washed in red, of Miles Davis, removed in thought behind dark glasses, to the performances, is classic. Not surprisingly, careful packaging and exquisite artistry have created a legend and, in this case, one of the essential recordings in the history of recorded music.\"\n\nConsidered by most to be one of the pinnacles of the hard bop era, the song selection on Midnight represents a summation of the earlier bebop era, with the performances tempered by Davis' inherent lyricism but rooted in the new style as promoted by hard bop pioneers Art Blakey and Horace Silver with the Jazz Messengers, and the Max Roach/Clifford Brown quintet, in 1956 featuring ex-Davis foil Sonny Rollins. Coltrane had yet to become an iconic figure in jazz history, his presence in the Davis Quintet a let-down to many in lieu of the aforementioned Rollins. His style, while embryonically frenetic and searching, was not quite the sheets of sound approach celebrated later in the decade. In April 1957, Coltrane's heroin use would lead to his leaving Davis and working with Monk, and under Monk's tutelage the saxophonist's playing style solidified considerably.​\n\nFor me it is different. I think it flows pretty well despite the fact that it is compiled by sessions spread out in time. It might be that I got to hear this album long time ago and let it grow on me for some time before I had heard a lot of jazz.\n\nI kind of agree that it's an uneven album. As for the original reviews, hardly any record with Coltrane on it got good reviews at the start, or if it did it was in spite of his playing. The critics mostly told Miles to kick him to the curb, didn't they.\n\nThose photos are amazing crispi! Concerning contemporary reviews, here is Ralph J. Gleason's published in Down Beat:\n\nMiles Davis\n\nColumbia 12\" LP 949 - Round About Midnight\n\n***** (Five Stars)\n\nFirst, let me say that you should buy this LP immediately. Perhaps even two copies, since you may wear out one playing it and you will want another. This is the kind of album to which one returns time and time again because it is, in its way, a perfect thing, a slice of modern jazz conceived and executed in the very best style. To those of you who may have heard this group (the album was made by the unit with which Miles has been touring for some time now) and have been disappointed, I want to point out that this album has captured air the best of the group and that Columbia and George Avakian have managed to make them sound on record as they have sounded only occasionally in person. There is a mellowness, a lack of hostility and a ripe, romantic grooviness to the sound and spirit of this album which makes it an utter pleasure to hear. The cover picture shows Miles with fingers in his ears, a position that some have emulated when Jones has been busy playing with less thought about dynamics than one might wish. On the album, however, he has been restrained either through electronics or by other devices, to use brushes at least part of the time behind Miles, and the result is an extraordinary example of the Milesian extension of single horn solos over rhythm. It is hard to see what can be done next. Miles is in exquisite form. His inferential , tentative, haunting, low pressure direction (reminiscent some times of Bunk Johnson—of all persons) is at its best in Midnight, All of You,\n\nand Blackbird, in which his essentially melodic conception seems particularly at home. Miles plays with a dainty, almost delicate manner as he probes the melodic possibilities in these tunes, setting up a romantic, glowing mood in his first choruses which allows him to improvise endlessly in the second half of his solos. The break at the end of Davis' initial statement in All of You is as close to a wail as he produces on this album and yet it is a very moving thing. His solos build beautifully to logical climaxes, and Coltrane, who customarily enters after Miles, seems here to have more of the melding of Pres and Hawkins and less of the bad tone which has been his lot up to now. In All of You, Coltrane and Chambers set up what is almost a duet and although Jones has switched to cymbals, it does not detract but rather adds. Garland, with his occasional excursions into the use of locked chords in his second choruses plays very effectively throughout the entire album. His chorus on Blackbird was particularly impressive to me for the manner in which he walked in, dancing along in a most attractive, elfin fashion. Chambers has a long solo in the bop classic, Tadd's Delight , which, while it is impressive as all of his solos are, seems to indicate he has yet to master his tone problem. Avakian's notes are informative despite an almost maidenly reluctance to mention Capitol when discussing Miles' previous important recordings. (Ralph J. Gleason)"
