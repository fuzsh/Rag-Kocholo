        "text": "On the second day after his double surgery, David Nalbandian left the hospital, the Sanatorio de Trinidad in Buenos Aires. David travelled back home in Unquillo, which may count as another sign that everything went well.\n\nMiguel Khoury, one of the doctors in charge, explained what was done during the two surgeries.\n\n\"Everything went very well, as we were expecting. For the hernia, a biodegradable mesh was put in place. For the adductors, in David's case those muscles were weakened and the abdominal wall was also reinforced. We are optimistic and he's ready to deal with this situation. We hope that in a month's time he can go back to training and play on the Tour again in two months. Of course, that depends on how his recovery will develop.”\n\n“After the operation he will be in better shape than he was before,” Nalbandian’s trusted kinesiologist Diego Rodriguez said, according to the tennis player’s official fan blog.\n\nApparently, the plan is for David to return at the Masters in Madrid to launch on May 1or at the Masters in Rome due May 8."
