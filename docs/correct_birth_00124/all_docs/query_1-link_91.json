        "text": "Classy from Djokovic at the end there as he stopped his post-match interview to go over to console an emotional Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nThe Bulgarian struggled to hold back the tears as he had a towel covering his face.\n\nThe Parisian crowd then showed their love for Dimitrov who had tears in his eyes as he got up out of his chair to thank the crowd for their support.\n\nThat's Paris Masters title No 7 for the world No 1!\n\nDjokovic barely broke a sweat in that final.\n\nDimitrov didn't do much wrong in either set, but Djokovic was clinical when it mattered most to break at crucial parts.\n\nThe Bulgarian's spirit was destroyed after the break in the second with Djokovic doing what was needed to get the job done.\n\nThat's FORTY Masters 1000 titles now for the Serbian superstar!\n\nIt's been an extremely close contest but Novak Djokovic took the only break point opportunity of the entire set to take the early lead.\n\nDimitrov won't be too disheartened at how the first set went, but that will certainly hurt that he wasn't able to take the lead.\n\nAll to do now for the Bulgarian!\n\nA light show to start proceedings in Bercy with both players making their way out onto court.\n\nIt's time and Dimitrov receives a huge ovation as he comes out onto the court.\n\nGet the feeling very quickly that the crowd are going to side with the underdog throughout the match.\n\nNothing Djokovic hasn't faced before and he's thrived in those kinds of atmospheres throughout his career.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov's resurgence in Paris has been the talking point of the tournament with the Bulgarian hoping to take his opportunity with both hands.\n\n\"I want to win or lose on my own terms. That brings me back again to another point, how everything has been happening on and off the court in my life is the same thing.\n\n\"I can control my attitude, and I don't want to feel sorry for myself for the past years. I don't want to feel like I have missed opportunities. Yes, have I? Yeah, of course, too many, if you ask me. Have I made mistakes? Yes, too many,\" he said.\n\nDjokovic is undeniably the more talented player in today's final, but Dimitrov's chances may be helped by the Serbian's fitness concerns.\n\nDjokovic has needed a few medical time-outs this week and received treatment on his back before the third set against Andrey Rublev on Saturday.\n\nDimitrov will certainly want to test his rival's resolve in the final with Djokovic seemingly not at 100 per cent.\n\nJessica Pegula reached her “biggest final ever” amid more chaos at the season-ending WTA Finals in Mexico.\n\nTop players have been complaining all week about the last-minute organisation and court conditions in Cancun.\n\nAnd rain and heavy winds over the weekend will see the singles final now played on Monday - the day before the Billie Jean King Cup finals start in Seville.\n\nThe American world No.5 booked her place by beatin her doubles partner and US Open champion Coco Gauff 6-2 6-1 in a match twice interrupted by rain.\n\nPegula has never got beyond the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam before - and lost all three matches on her WTA Finals debut last year.\n\n“I managed to get my act together at the end of the year,” she said. “I’ve done a good job of resetting coming here\n\n\"It's probably my biggest final ever .It's going to give me a lot of confidence going into next year.\"\n\nOver at the WTA finals, the iconic Martina Navratilova is using her status and voice to demand alterations to the system.\n\nShe becomes the latest figure from the world of tennis to pile pressure on the WTA after saying it will be ‘hard’ for CEO Steve Simon to stay in his role after recent criticism.\n\nPutting together of the 2023 offering of the WTA Finals was deemed chaotic, with the host venue not being announced until September.\n\nIt shouldn’t have come that late in the year, making this decision. There was a sequence of bad decisions,” 18-time Grand Slam singles champion Navratilova said on Amazon Prime.\n\n“Ultimately, Steve Simon has been the boss for nine years and here we are. Players adjusted and they had to but to come to Cancun in the rainy season?\n\n\"You cannot be hoping it’s not gonna rain at a premier event for the WTA Tour. It was just a whole bunch of decisions.\n\n“You have to own the bad decisions you made and make some choices after that.”\n\nHe's not at the Paris Masters, but one man who loves playing his tennis in France is none other than Rafa Nadal.\n\nThe Spanish icon has weighed heavily on fans' heartstrings this season, with many sensing that his illustrious tennis career is coming to an end.\n\nThere may however be a way to both prolong this, and also ensure Olympic glory.\n\nHis Uncle Toni, who is famously outspoken, has been drawing up a few plans.\n\nDavid Nalbandian once reached a Wimbledon final and won the Paris Masters during his tennis career but now has a very different profession.\n\nThe 41-year-old, who climbed as high as third in the ATP singles rankings, scooped 11 titles during his 13-year tennis career spanning from 2000 to 2013.\n\nThe Unquillo native needed more thrill in his life once the tennis days had concluded. The adrenaline simply was not pumping in the same way that it used to.\n\nFULL STORY HERE."
