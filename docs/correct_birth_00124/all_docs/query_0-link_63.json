        "text": "Rubik Kocharian is a fine artist living and working in California. To date in his prolific career, he has produced over 1,000 original oil paintings and drawings.\n\nRubik was born in 1940 in Yerevan, Armenia. His family was exiled to Siberia in 1946 during Stalin’s regime. Rubik studied under Ivan Pavlov, a Russian artist in exile. In 1953, his family returned to Yerevan where he entered the Terlemezian Art School, studying under several well known Armenian artists. In 1955, Rubik entered Moscow School of Art and had the opportunity to study Old Masters at the Pushkin Museum. He returned to Yerevan in 1959 where he worked with leading influential artists and received his Masters Degree in Fine Arts from Yerevan State Art Institute in 1968. Rubik participated in many shows in Armenia and throughout the former Soviet Union.Rubik emigrated to the United States in 1974, arriving in this country with no money and no paintings, which he was forced to leave behind in Russia. During the hardship of his early years in America, Rubik managed to establish a studio on Madison Avenue in New York City and filled his studio with newly created paintings. He exhibited in numerous galleries in New York and Washington, DC.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1982, Rubik created a series of paintings in Greece on a commission by a collector. In 1986, Rubik relocated to Los Angeles where he was represented by Heritage Gallery and other venues. He has been living in Clovis, California since 1996. Rubik’s paintings are in private collections and have been featured in museums in Russia and America.\n\nYou can follow his creations on his official Facebook page!\n\nBellow a small selection of his wonderful art.\n\nChariot Race by Rubik Kocharian\n\nBowl of Pomegranates by Rubik Kocharian\n\nAkhtamar (Based on Armenian Legend), 2002 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nIncense Burner 2005 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nGolden Chalice 2005 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nMithradates VI Greeted at the Shrine of Goddess Anahit 2010 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nGirl with Shield 2010 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nE-World 2004 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nThe Apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew in Armenia 2010 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nPomegranate Dance 2010 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nLady of Urartu 2005 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nWhite Elephant 1990 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nCollectibles 2005 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nSacrifice for Shedu 2002 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nUrartian Sculptor 2008 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nMithradates & Tigranes 2008 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nThe Mithridate Wine 2009 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nTigranakert in its Glory 2003 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nWelcoming Queen Sheba 2004 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nOedipus in the Temple of Apollo 2002 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nPomegranates & Grapes by Rubik Kocharian\n\nCherubs with Zvartnots Cathedral Eagle 2012 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nMortar and Pestle 2000 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nCherubs with Goddess Anahit 2012 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nCherubs with the Vase 2006 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nSelf Portrait 2011 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nEvening Ride 2011 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nDaisy Tiara 2009 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nSeven Dates 2008 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nArtist’s Muse 2003 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nFinding Venus 2004 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nPhaeton’s Chariot Struck by Zeus 2011 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nGirl in Blue 2002 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nPeppers and Mugs 2006 by Rubik Kocharian\n\nPomegranates on Tree by Rubik Kocharian\n\nLong before Baron Pierre de Coubertin, after a nearly 1200-year hiatus, organized the Modern Olympics of “Athens 1896,” the Ancient Olympics that began in 776 B.C. honored countless athletes every four years, including some famous Armenians.\n\nAmong them, Prince Varazdat Arshakuni (Վարազդատ in Armenian; Latinized as Varastades), later King of Armenia, was the last known recorded Ancient Olympic victor who won the boxing event at the 291st Olympiad (in 385 A.D.). A memorial plate, now in display at the Olympic Museum in Olympia, Greece, details his win as the most honored champion of the 291st Olympiad. At the 265th Olympiad, 104 years earlier (281 A.D.), another of the famous non-Greek winners (in wrestling) was the Armenian King Trdat III (286-342 A.D), who in 301 A.D. adopted Christianity as the state religion, making Armenia the first Christian nation. The exploits of both kings were chronicled by the Armenian Historian Movses Khorenatsi (Moses of Khoren) in his History of Armenia.\n\nThe end of the Ancient Olympics came in 393 A.D., when the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, a convert to Christianity, legally abolished the games as an old “pagan” religious rite. In 1998, the International Olympic Academy installed in Olympia a marble bust by sculptor Levon Tokmajyan, honoring the Armenian King Varazdat Arshakuni (385 A.D.).\n\nThe first Armenian Olympic champion of the Modern Olympics was Hrant Shahinyan (1923-96), born in the village of Gyulagarak, who at age 28 competed at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics as a member of the USSR Artistic Gymnastic National Team, receiving two gold medals in gymnastic rings and team combined exercises, and two silvers in gymnastics individual men’s all-around and the pommeled horse. He was also a seven-time USSR and two-time world champion. Among the other Armenian athletes competing alongside Shahinyan—all representing the Soviet Union—were Albert Azaryan and Artur Akopyan.\n\nArmenia was represented as a unified country for the first time at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics as part of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). With only five athletes participating, the team won three gold medals in weightlifting, wrestling, and sharp-shooting. Armenia has been competing as an official independent nation since the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games.\n\nIn recent years, Armenian athletes have succeed mainly in weightlifting and wrestling. In fact, at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, medals awarded were three in weightlifting, two in wrestling, and one in boxing, all bronze.\n\nThe Republic of Armenia was proudly represented by 25 athletes at the XXX Olympiad, the 2012 London Summer Games, encompassing a variety of sports, with competitors in wrestling, weightlifting, shooting, swimming, artistic gymnastics, judo, taekwondo, and athletics. Of the 25 athletes there, 7 were competing in wrestling and 6 in weightlifting.\n\nArmenian President Serge Sarkisian was in attendance at the London Opening Ceremony on Fri., July 27. On Sun., July 30 he attended the Armenian Open-Air Festival, organized by the Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church in the United Kingdom and Ireland, in honor of Armenia’s athletes participating in London 2012. He also watched some of the athletes perform on Sat., July 28, including the boxing match for men’s middle (75 kg.) between Andranik Hakobyan and the American Terrell Gausha. Hakobyan was born in Echmiadzin in 1985. As the Americans in the crowd cheered for Gausha, the overbearing cries of “Ar-men-ia” could be heard from the other fans. The match ended in a 3-4 loss after the referee called an end to the contest.\n\nSeveral other Armenian athletes were competing for countries other than Armenia. Among them, Arsen Galstyan, representing Russia, won that country’s first gold medal—in men’s 60 kg. judo category on July 28, wrestling the gold from the Japanese contender, Hiroaki Hiraoka. The same day, another Armenian in the same category, Hovhannes Davtyan representing Armenia, born in 1983 in Gyumri, was eliminated in an earlier round. Born in Soviet Armenia in 1989, Galstyan was trained at an early age after his move to Russia. His siblings, Arman and Tigran, also compete in the same sport. When asked about his training routine, Galstyan reportedly said, “When I have nobody to train with, I recruit one of my brothers, it seems to me that my victories give them additional stimulation to train and win.”\n\nFamed professional tennis player and former world no. 3 David Nalbandian, who is competing for Argentina, was born in Unquillo, Cordoba Province, Argentina in 1982 to a mother of Italian origin and a father of Armenian origin. He was introduced to tennis as a young boy, playing in a cement court in their backyard built by his Armenian grandfather, and became a professional tennis player at 18. He was eliminated in the first round of the men’s singles and doubles on July 28. His doubles partner was Eduardo Schwank.\n\nArtur Ayvazian, born in Yerevan, Armenia in 1973, competed as a shooter for the Ukraine team, qualifying 21st for the 50 m. rifle prone on Aug. 3, and 10th for the 50 m. rifle 3 positions after a shoot off on Aug. 6. Four years ago, Artur won gold in the 50 m. rifle prone at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nTvin Moumjoghlian, representing Lebanon in women’s singles table tennis, was eliminated in the preliminary round on July 28. Born in Beirut in 1989, she started playing table tennis at age nine, under the tutelage of her father Raffi Moumjoghlian, a professional table tennis player and Lebanese champion. Tvin Moumjoghlian trained in Vienna for the 2012 London Games and has studied economics at the American University of Beirut.\n\nAlso competing on the Lebanese team is sprinter Gretta Taslakian, born in Ghadir, Lebanon, in 1985 to parents of Lebanese and Armenian origin. Her specialty is the running the 200 m. sprint and she has competed in the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games, as well as in numerous other championships. On Aug. 6 she qualified for 8th place in round 1 of the women’s 200 m. sprint.\n\nAn Armenian can also be found on a United States team, but not as a competitor. Adam Krikorian is the head coach of the U.S. women’s water polo team. The team received attention after beating Italy 9-6 in the preliminary round. They’ll face Australia in the semifinals. Krikorian is also the water polo coach at UCLA.\n\nOn Sun., Aug. 5, Armenia won its first Olympic medal of the 2012 London Games. The bronze medal was awarded to Hripsime Khurshudyan, who competed in women’s weightlifting +75 kg. Born in Kasakh in 1987, this was Khurshudyan’s first medal awarded at an international competition.\n\nLater in the evening on Sunday, Armenia won its second Olympic medal of the 2012 London Games, this time a silver medal which was awarded to Arsen Julfalakyan, in 74 kg. Greco-Roman wrestling. Born in Gyumri in 1987, he is the son of Armenia’s national wrestling coach Levon Julfalakyan, who won gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Arsen Julfalakyan, who had placed 10th at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, defeated Azerbaijan’s Emin Ahmadov in the semifinal round, but lost to Russia’s Roman Vlasov in the finals. In previous years he won the 2009 European championship, plus a silver and a bronze at the 2010 and 2011 World championships.\n\nOn the evening of Monday August 7, Armenia brought its medal count at the London Games up to three, with a bronze awarded to Artur Aleksanyan, born in Gyumri in 1991, in men’s 96kg Greco-Roman Wrestling. Artur defeated Cenk Ildem of Turkey 3-0 in the Repechage Round 2, before out-wrestling Yunior Estrada Falcon of Cuba 3-0 for the bronze. Earlier in the afternoon, one of his team-mates Hovhannes Varderesyan, born in Yerevan in 1989, competing in men’s 66kg Greco-Roman Wrestling, was defeated in Repechage Round 1 by the wrestler Pedro Isaac Mulens Herrera from Cuba.\n\nhttp://www.armenianweekly.com/2012/08/13/armenian-olympians-ancient-olympiads-to-2012-london-olympics/"
