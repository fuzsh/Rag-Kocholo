        "text": "David Nalbandian never shied away from controversy during his tennis career and that narrative is continuing long after he hit his final ball in anger on the court.\n\nNalbandian was a Wimbledon finalist in 2002 and won the ATP Finals three years later in a career that also included three Davis Cup wins with Argentina as he reached a career-high ranking of No 3.\n\nHe was known to be a feisty player on the court and was famously disqualified from the 2012 Final at the Queen’s Club in London after he kicked an advertising hoarding and inadvertently inflicted an injury on a line judge.\n\nA decade after his retirement from tennis, Nalbandian is back in the headlines once again after it emerged he is being sued by ex-girlfriend Araceli Torrado.\n\nReports emerging from America suggest the lawsuit has been filed for sexual harassment and stalking after Nalbandian reortedly confirmed he installed hidden cameras in the air conditioning when he was in a relationship with Torrado.\n\nShe then made the complaint against her former partner Nalbandian, 41, accompanying it with a video in which she discovers the camera allegedly installed in her room.\n\nA judge has already ruled that the camera was installed by Nalbandian but declared it was not a crime. Now Torrado has confirmed she is pursuing Nalbandain in her own legal case.\n\nAs reported by C5N, Nalbandian has admitted to installing the device, saying: “What matters to me is that I’m okay with you, I want to find a way for us to get back together.\n\n“Do you want me to be honest? Yes, it was me. I was never able to watch anything because of the internet. I can not see it.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Olly_Tennis_/status/1727427680319217730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1727427680319217730%7Ctwgr%5E28ff419b99c698826116d9f0f509789647f331af%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F11%2F27%2Fsports%2Fdavid-nalbandian-sued-for-setting-up-hidden-camera-to-spy-on-ex%2F\n\nTorrado made a statement on her social media channel confirming the news as she said: “In light of the questions I receive about the events of which I was a victim and whose author was David Nalbandian, I want to inform you that I am filing a criminal case and the corresponding civil legal proceedings. thanks for the support.”\n\nThe explosion in publicity around this case is certain to ensure the media start to show a bigger interest in what comes next, with Torrado’s high profile on Instagram certain to make this a story that creates plenty of headlines in the coming weeks and months.\n\nTorrado has 214k followers on Instagram and has a lot of interaction on her page as she posts a series of revealing images to her army of fans around the world.\n\nREAD MORE: Top 10 star responds to claims his stunning girlfriend is distracting his tennis\n\nRosario-born Torrado is a model, influencer and broadcaster and before she dated Nalbandian, she was a partner of former Manchester United and Argentina footballer Juan Sebastián Verón, with whom she lived. Their relationship ended in 2021.\n\nNow she is back in the headlines again following the end of her relationship with Nalbandian and this story capturing big headlines in Argentina over the last few days."
