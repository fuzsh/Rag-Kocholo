        "text": "Roger Federer\n\nSeed 1\n\nAge 26\n\nNationality Swiss\n\nGrass class Added his fifth Halle title to his five Wimbledons this month which beats the total grass titles of his supposed nemesis, Rafael Nadal, 10-1.\n\nMind game Assumed to have been turned into a gibbering wreck by Nadal's 6-0 thrashing in the third set in the French Open final - think the effect Peter Sellers' Clouseau had on Herbert Lom's Dreyfus - but was happy to credit Nadal for his 50 unforced errors while hinting that the Spaniard is always the greener on grass.\n\nBack home Lives in Oberwil in Switzerland and has an opulent bolthole in Dubai which he shares with girlfriend and manager, former world No76 Mirka Vavrinec.\n\nWhat you'll see Praeternaturally calm with a vast array of outrageous shots. Occasional fits of Luddism inspired by Hawk-Eye.\n\nBest day Toss-up between beating his hero Pete Sampras in a five-set epic in 2001 and his only other Wimbledon five-setter - last year's victory over Nadal to equal Bjorn Borg's record of five successive titles.\n\nRafael Nadal\n\nSeed 2\n\nAge 22\n\nNationality Spanish\n\nGrass class Unveiled a reassuringly expansive game to bag the Artois tournament. Bjorn Borg, the last to win French and Wimbledon titles in the same year, says Nadal has the confidence and guile to do it.\n\nMind game No one is better at fighting back to win sets from a heavy deficit. He can be as relentless as Monty Python's Black Knight from the Holy Grail - except the armless chevalier would undoubtedly have had a stronger serve.\n\nBack home Lives in Mallorca with parents and grandparents. His father runs a successful businesses - restaurants and selling replacement windows, like a cross between Gordon Ramsay and Ted Moult.\n\nWhat you'll see If he wins, he'll sink his teeth into the trophy like a sort of Spanish Monsieur Mangetout. \"I just prefer biting them to kissing the trophies,\" he says.\n\nBest day Fourth French Open title this year. He had beaten Federer 10 times before but never had those post-spinach Popeye biceps given the Swiss such a pasting.\n\nNovak Djokovic\n\nSeed 3\n\nAge 21\n\nNationality Serbian\n\nGrass class Steady progess in SW19 - third round, fourth and semi-finals in the past three years. The man with a David Miliband hair share certainly has the explosive power to prosper.\n\nMind game The Djoker says his toughness came at the age of 12 when Nato bombed Belgrade in 1999. Fizzes with energy but a tell-tale sign of pressure is when he bounces the ball 75 times pre-serve.\n\nBack home Lives in Monte Carlo but steps out with his former school mate Jelena Ristic, an economics student in Milan. Risible attempt by the Lawn Tennis Association to lure him to become a British citizen two years ago dashed by his patriotism.\n\nWhat you'll see The John Virgo of the circuit, he spices up the locker room ennui and post-match interviews with impressions. His Maria Sharapova is spot on. His Ray Reardon needs work.\n\nBest day His three-set victory over Roger Federer in this year's Australian Open semi, winning it on his first match point.\n\nAndy Roddick\n\nSeed 6\n\nAge 25\n\nNationality American\n\nGrass class Won the Artois four times, runner-up at Wimbledon twice. Has aggressive serve and return to flourish but, with Jimmy Connors having left the A-Team, A-Rod may lack the A-Ris (-totle = bottle) to make the A-List.\n\nMind game Lost it at the 2001 US Open, calling the umpire a \"moron\". Some feel he uses outbursts to intimidate opponents, others that, if self-control were gunpowder, he does not have enough in his brain to blow off his ubiquitous baseball cap.\n\nBack home Engaged to swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker. Divides his time between an apartment in New York, a mansion in Austin, Texas and a Florida house. Emergence of a rival American idol in James Blake seems to have given him his competitive edge back.\n\nWhat you'll see Huge serve, cocky posturing, anger masquerading as \"passion\", quick-fire result, witty or sarcastic press conference depending on outcome.\n\nBest day Won the 2003 US Open.\n\nDavid Nalbandian\n\nSeed 7\n\nAge 26\n\nNationality Argentinian\n\nGrass class Made the final in 2002 at the first attempt but remarkably, like George Michael, the more experience he's had on grass, the worse he has become.\n\nMind game In 2006 he called the Court 13 crowds, \"you fucking English whores\". Various abdominal complaints confirm he may have the hunger but not the stomach to win a grand slam title.\n\nBack home Was born and lives in Unquillo, on the outskirts of Córdoba, deep in polo country. His run in 2002 was honoured by the townsfolk naming a bus stop, roundabout and hot-dog stand after him.\n\nWhat you'll see Tears for souvenirs - he tends to cry when he wins and when he loses but it garners the man known as \"Nasty\" little sympathy. Likes to tell the world that other players are not popular among their peers. Must lack a mirror.\n\nBest day In 2005 he came back from two sets down to beat a hobbling Roger Federer in the Masters Cup, ending his opponent's run of 24 successive final wins.\n\nRichard Gasquet\n\nSeed 8\n\nAge 22\n\nNationality French\n\nGrass class Semi-finalist last year and a quarter-finalist at the Artois this month, he bolsters his credentials on grass with two Nottingham titles, which is one more than Brian Clough achieved.\n\nMind game Slated for \"tanking it\", throwing in the towel, when nerves get the better of him. He remains unpredictable - ESPN calls him \"the microwave\" because he can get hot at any moment. At least it is better than the \"gasket-blower\".\n\nBack home An only child, both his parents are tennis coaches and he lives with them in the home of the Swiss watchmaking industry, Neuchâtel. France piles on the pressure for his first grand slam title.\n\nWhat you'll see French critics say the baseball cap always worn back-to-front Vanilla Ice-style is a symbol of his immaturity.\n\nBest day Won the mixed doubles at the 2004 French Open with Tatiana Golovin but his gutsiest performance came at Wimbledon last year, when he came from two sets down to defeat Andy Roddick.\n\nJames Blake\n\nSeed 9\n\nAge 28\n\nNationality American\n\nGrass class Won 10 hard-court titles and was runner-up at Queen's in 2006, having beaten Andy Roddick in the semi-finals. Has the height, athleticism, foot speed and booming forehand to do well.\n\nMind game Bratty as a teenager but has shown great composure since, overcoming scoliosis and a broken neck sustained in 2004.\n\nBack home Lives in a gated community in Tampa with his brother Thomas and has Mardy Fish as a neighbour. His mother, Betty, is from Banbury in Oxfordshire, making him the highest ranked player in the world with a British mother.\n\nWhat you'll see Praised for his dignity and calm, he'll stick to the back of the court hitting flat, deep forehands and taking receipt of Banbury cakes from the Blakettes.\n\nBest day At the US Open in 2005, a year after his neck injury and the death of his father, he beat Rafael Nadal en route to the quarter-finals, where he lost a five-setter to his hero, Andre Agassi. \"It couldn't have been more fun to lose,\" he said.\n\nAndy Murray\n\nSeed 12\n\nAge 21\n\nNationality British\n\nGrass class Successful on hard courts, his injury-hit year has not been ideal preparation for a surface on which he seems to find it hard to keep his footing. Should try studs but don't tell the groundsman.\n\nMind game Combines foul-mouthed drama queenery with moments of intense focus but still far too liable to bouts of self-chastisement and bloke-on-the bus random shouting. Still, will have the wholesale backing of most people present.\n\nBack home In a long-term relationship with drama student Kimberley Sears, he divides his down time satisfying his cravings for square sausages in Dunblane and chowing on chorizo in Barcelona.\n\nWhat you'll see It will be what you hear, rather than what you see - squealing, braying and a thousand calls of \"C'mon Andy\"."
