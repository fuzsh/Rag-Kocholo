        "text": "Nationality: Argentinian.\n\nAge: 21.\n\nLives: Cordoba, Arg.\n\nHeight: 5ft 11in.\n\nWeight: 12st 7lb.\n\nTurned pro: 2000.\n\nTournaments won 2 (0 grand slams).\n\nWimbledons: 1 (2002).\n\nBest performance: runner-up 2002.\n\nCareer prize money: Â£878,200.\n\nWorld ranking: 8 (highest 8).\n\nOn court\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nBefore reaching the final of last year's Wimbledon - his first professional grass-court tournament - Nalbandian was known as \"David who?\" Now it's more \"David who fluked his way to the final\". Which is an improvement of sorts.\n\nGrass or pass\n\nGiven that he has lost only one match at Wimbledon (he won the junior doubles in 1999 and was defaulted from the singles having got his semi-final start time wrong), we think he might quite like it.\n\nDistinguishing feature\n\nWith his blond hair, blue eyes and pasty white skin, Nalbandian looks more like a trainee Viking than an Argentinian tennis player.\n\nHot shot\n\nBackhand which all but rips a trench through the grass.\n\nPressure point\n\nProlonged whining about line calls during that final defeat by Lleyton Hewitt suggests he doesn't cope too well in the kitchen when the heat's been turned up. Or something.\n\nOutside court\n\nHero or zero\n\nA hero. They named a bus stop and hot-dog stand after him in his home town of Unquillo after he made the Wimbledon final and his family celebrated by roasting a goat.\n\nHappy clappies\n\nHis dad Norberto, mum Alda and brothers Dar'o and Javier, none of whom could afford to come last year. Instead he was cheered on by a small but reliable three-man band: his girlfriend, his coach and his coach's wife.\n\nDon't mention\n\nHis Davis Cup debut against Russia last year. The doubles match lasted six hours and 20 minutes and, though Argentina edged that match, a knackered Nalbandian flopped in his Sunday singles. Also, the male streaker who held up last year's final. \"It was terrible,\" he said.\n\nBritish claim\n\nPractised for last year's Wimbledon success at Hurlingham, the English-style sports club in Buenos Aires that has the country's only grass courts, as well as such proper pursuits as polo and cricket. Much more of that and he'll be turning up at Henley in a straw boater.\n\nLuvvy rating\n\nOther players are more likely to mistake him for a lockerroom attendant than a former Wimbledon finalist. 5/10\n\nThe winning formula\n\nAt home on grass x impressive backhand + memorable name = unforgettable winner"
