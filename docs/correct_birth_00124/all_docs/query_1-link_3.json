        "text": "David Nalbandian ( Unquillo , January 1 1982 ) is a former Argentine tennis player . The name Nalbandian is an Armenian name of Persian origin and means blacksmith . The grandfather of David Nalbandian is an immigrant from Armenia and his mother is of Italian descent [1] .\n\nHe reached the finals once in his career in a Grand Slam tournament he achieved in 2002 as a relatively unknown, the final battle at Wimbledon . In the final he lost to Australian Lleyton Hewitt . His highest ranking was third. All Grand Slams he reached at least the semi-finals.\n\nIn 2005 he won the final of the Tennis Masters Cup of the world leader Roger Federer (6-7, 6-7, 6-2, 6-1, 7-6). It marked the end of Federer's record string of 24 consecutive finals won.\n\nIn 2012, Nalbandian was in the final of the ATP tournament in London , a voorbereidingstoernooi at Wimbledon , disqualified. Nalbandian missed a ball and lost his serve in turn, after he broke a billboard kicked out of frustration. This billboard was at a line judge , who by the sharp edges a cut to the bone over the incident continued.\n\nNalbandian was known as a very versatile player and a shot maker, a pure tennis. His strongest weapons were his footwork and double-handed backhand down the line. Purely on talent, he was able to, if he was in shape, winning the best tennis players. In 2007 he won the Masters Tournament in Madrid and Paris after the other, he defeated both tournaments twice bothRoger Federer and Rafael Nadal , who at that time together dominated the tennis world. Nalbandian, however, was not the most disciplined and mentally strongest tennis player, and could not at all hard court surfaces as well as on the feet indoor.\n\nOn October 1, 2013 Nalbandian announced his retirement from professional tennis. The main reason they gave shoulder problems. [2] He is known as one of the best tennis players without a Grand Slam title ever.
