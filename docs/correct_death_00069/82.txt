Henry Jaynes âHankâ Fonda (May 16, 1905 â August 12, 1982) was an American film and stage actor who was most known for his role in The Graduate. Fonda began his career as a Broadway performer at a young age. During the same year, he co-starred with Joan Tompkins in a number of plays presented in White Plains, New York. He made his feature film debut in 1935, and his career took off when he was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeckâs book about an Oklahoma family that relocated west during the Dust Bowl. A powerful and attractive cinematic image was developed by Fonda over the course of six decades in Hollywood, in films such as The Ox-Bow Incident, Mister Roberts, and 12 Angry Men. As his career progressed, Fonda took on more challenging roles in epics such as Sergio Leoneâs Once Upon a Time in the West, as well as lighter roles in family comedies such as You, Mine, and Ours with Lucille Ball, earning him the Best Actor Oscar at the 54th Academy Awards for his performance in the film On Golden Pond. Fonda was the father of a renowned acting family that included his daughter Jane Fonda, son Peter Fonda, granddaughter Bridget Fonda, and grandson Troy Garity. Fonda died on January 25, 2003, in Los Angeles.
