Fonda soon gained recognition for roles in The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, Jezebel and the Academy Award nominated The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nThough appearances in Twelve Angry Men and Young Mr. Lincoln cemented his role as an onscreen American hero, Fonda memorably played the ruthless killer Frank in Once Upon a Time in the West. In his later career, he received a Tony nomination for Clarence Darrow and an Academy Award for On Golden Pond, his final film appearance.\n\nFonda passed away in 1982, with several of his children and grandchildren following him into acting.\n\nSinging[]\n\nFonda sang in a handful of films, including The Grapes of Wrath (in which he performed \"Red River Valley\") and The Male Animal. He also duetted on \"Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet\" in Rings on Her Fingers.\n\nFonda also performed the classic \"Rock of Ages\" in Warlock and \"Rolling Stone\" in The Cheyenne Social Club.\n\nFilm[]\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (1940)[]\n\nRed River Valley (solo)\n\nThe Male Animal (1942)[]\n\nWho's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
