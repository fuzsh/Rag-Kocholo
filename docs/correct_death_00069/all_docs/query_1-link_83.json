Henry Fonda's career spanned five decades in Hollywood and on Broadway. On the big screen, he gained acclaim for his performances in such films as \"Jezebel,\" \"Young Mr. Lincoln,\" \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" \"The Lady Eve,\" \"My Darling Clementine,\" \"12 Angry Men,\" \"Once Upon a Time in the West,\" and \"On Golden Pond,\" the lattermost of which earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor.
