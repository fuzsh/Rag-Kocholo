        "text": "1891 Â· Angel Island Serves as Quarantine Station\n\nAngel Island served as a quarantine station for those diagnosed with bubonic plague beginning in 1891. A quarantine station was built on the island which was funded by the federal government at the cost of $98,000. The disease spread to port cities around the world, including the San Francisco Bay Area, during the third bubonic plague pandemic, which lasted through 1909.\n\n1892 Â· The Chicago Canal\n\nThe Chicago River Canal was built as a sewage treatment scheme to help the city's drinking water not to get contaminated. While the Canal was being constructed the Chicago River's flow was reversed so it could be treated before draining back out into Lake Michigan.\n\n1910 Â· Boy Scouts of America\n\nWhen W. D. Boyce was visiting London, he encountered a boy that helped him find his destination. The boy refused the tip that Boyce offered to him and told him that he was just doing his daily good turn. Being inspired, Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America to help teach young men how to have an attitude of service always. Since its foundation, The Boy Scouts of America has become one of the largest Scouting organizations in the United States. Around 110 million people have been participants at some time in their life. The BSA was established to help young people make better choices in life and showing selflessness by serving the community."
