As we grieve, we ask that you respect our privacy,\" the Fonda family wrote.\n\n\"And, while we mourn the loss of this sweet and gracious man, we also wish for all to celebrate his indomitable spirit and love of life,\" they added. \"In honor of Peter, please raise a glass to freedom.\"\n\nPeter Fonda was the only son of Hollywood legend Henry Fonda and socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw. He was also the brother of actress Jane Fonda.\n\nPeter Fonda had a brief film career in the mid-1960s before his breakout performance as Wyatt in Easy Rider,costarring Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. Fonda produced and co-wrote the film, earning an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.\n\nHe was later nominated for an Oscar for best actor in the 1997 film Ulee's Gold.\n\nCopyright 2021 NPR.
