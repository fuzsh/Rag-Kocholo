        "text": "To begin with, Thomson uses a thought experiment about a hypothetical famous violinist, to further her argument that abortion is morally permissible. In this thought experiment, you are kidnapped and unconsciously plugged to a famous violinist so that your kidney can remove toxins from the violinist’s kidney and ultimately save his life. Thomson argues that you are not required to stay plugged to the famous violinist even if unplugging yourself from the violinist would result in his death. Thomson argues that while everyone has the right to life, no one has the right to dictate what happens to another person 's body.\n\nThe next issue is, in Thomson’s opinion, the most important question in the abortion debate; that is, what exactly does a right to life bring about? The premise that “everyone has a right to life, so the unborn person has a right to life” suggests that the right to life is “unproblematic,” or straight-forward. We know that isn’t true. Thomson gives an analogy involving Henry Fonda. You are sick and dying and the touch of Henry Fonda’s hand will heal you. Even if his touch with save your life, you have no right to be “given the touch of Henry Fonda’s cool hand.” A stricter view sees the right to life as more of a right to not be killed by anybody. Here too troubles arise. In the case of the violinist, if we are to “refrain from killing the violinist,” then we must basically allow him to kill you. This contradicts the stricter view. The conclusion Thomson draws from this analogy is “that having a right to life does not guarantee having either a right to be given the use of or a right to be allowed continued use of another person’s body—even if one needs it for life itself.” This argument again proves the basic argument wrong. The right to life isn’t as clear of an argument as I’m sure opponents of abortion would like it to be or believe it is.\n\nSecond, the author uses her “expanding child” example. “Trapped in a tiny house with a growing child and you are up against a wall, and in a few minutes, you will be crushed, on the other hand the child won’t be crushed. The only thing that will save her life is to kill the child. Is abortion permissible to save the pregnant woman’s life? Because the mother being compared to that of the house, this brings up the idea that the mother should be able to do as she pleases with her body, and that her body carries more significance than the fetus’ right to life. This brings in the argument of a third-party intervention, such as a doctor. If a doctor did not agree to perform an abortion, to save this mother, then the mother would be denied her rights, and the right to decide what is done with her body. If a woman doesn’t have a right to their body, then you should not be unplugged, thus, save the violinists life. This reasoning is concluded with two smart statements, “It seems to me that to treat the matter in this very way (refuse abortion for the mother’s health) is to refuse to grant the very status of person which is so firmly insisted on for the fetus by anti-abortion advocates. (243) and “a fetus who existence is due to rape” has no right to use their mother’s bodies, and aborting them is not depriving them of anything they had a\n\nIn Judith A. Thomson’s article, ‘A defense of abortion’ Thomson defends her view that in some cases abortion is morally permissible. She takes this stance even with the premise that fetuses upon the moment of conception are in fact regarded as persons. However one criticism of her argument would be that there is a biological relationship between mother and fetus however there is no biological relationship between you and the violinist. Having this biological relationship therefore entails special responsibility upon the mother however there is no responsibility in the case of the violinist. Thomson argues against those who are opposed to abortion with her violinist thought experiment.\n\nJudith Thomson makes many different arguments regarding the morality of abortion. One of her many arguments is that a woman should have a right to defend her own life, and therefore the extreme view of abortion is inherently false (268). To make her argument, Thomson does addresses two things. One, she addresses the opposition by confronting their core argument (that a fetus is a person and has a right to life), and although she may not agree, assumes that it is correct (266). Two, she addresses an analogous situation to pregnancy, the case of the violinist, on which she introduces her argument. By addressing the opposition, and discussing an analogous situation, Thomson comes to the conclusion that although a fetus may be a person and have a right to life, a mother has a right to self-defense, and therefore the extreme view of abortion (in which abortions are not permitted in any circumstances) is false (268).\n\nAs a result, since the mother never granted permission for the foetus to be in her body, according to Thomson, it would follow that abortion in this particular circumstance is not killing unjustly. Therefore, abortion is morally permissible and is a reasonable decision despite the fact that the pregnancy was the product of the woman having consensual sexual intercourse and doing it voluntarily. Thomson made a logical argument, with the assumption that her experiments had addressed all potential cases of pregnancy, and proving that it is morally acceptable to abort in all proposed cases, then concluding that it is still never immoral. Despite this, it must be brought up that, Thomson recognized the morals and values of the individual who is willing to do whatever it takes to sustain the violinist’s life, an action that sets the bar for morality so high that it would be unacceptable to expect one to follow. Furthermore, Thomson states that while she is “arguing for the permissibility of abortion in some cases” (Thomson, 66), she is “not arguing for the right to secure the death of the unborn child” (Thomson, 66). She also points out that we must be confuse these two\n\nIn Thomson’s defence of abortion she argues that abortion is permissible when a mother’s life is not at risk. Working on her interpretation of the secular conservative argument, she first assumes that the premise of a foetus being a person is true, then moves onto the second premise, that a person has the right to life. Analysing what the right to life means, she first looks at the idea that the right to life is the right to have the bare minimum a person needs in order to survive. She quickly rebuts this by providing the Henry Fonda analogy and the violinist analogy. Both of these show that just because a person needs something to survive, like Henry Fonda’s cool hand or another person’s kidneys, a person doesn’t have the right to take it. With this in mind she modifies the argument so that the right to life is the right not to be killed. This she rebuffs with the violin analogy, noting that by pulling the plugs you would in effect be killing the violinist. While the violinist didn’t have the right to your kidneys, it could be argued that he does have the right for you not to intervene. However these are your kidneys, and you should not be forced to allow him continued use. Having ascertained that the right to life is not the right to the bare minimum needed to survive, nor the right not to be killed, she concludes that the right to life is the right not to be killed unjustly, or the\n\nWhile Thomson makes many different analogies in his essay “A Defense of Abortion”, none were as persuasive as the famous violinist analogy. In the analogy, Thomas paints the picture of someone being kidnapped and their kidneys being used to support the life of the violinist. Thomson uses this argument to represent the idea of a woman supporting the life of a child or fetus at the expense of their own. Thomson goes on to show the reader that the idea of unplugging yourself is not unjust, therefore “unplugging” yourself from a fetus is not unjust as well. The question of rape is also addressed with this analogy as the violinist is violating the victim’s body just as the rapist does. Thomson goes on to modify the analogy throughout the essay. The first modification to the analogy is that the act of supporting the violinist will kill you, just as sometimes birth may kill a woman. In either case, it is widely accepted that unplugging yourself or aborting the baby is within\n\nIn “A Defense of Abortion” by Judith Jarvis Thompson, Thompson works to argue that even if a human fetus is considered a person, abortion is still often morally permissible. This paper will work to explain Thompson’s positions on the different accounts of the right to life, and to provide an evaluation of them and explain why they are not plausible, specifically regarding three of the analogies on-which she based her entire argument: the violinist, the coat, and the case of Kitty Genovese, as well as to explore a logical counterargument and explain why it’s stance is impermissible.\n\nThompson grants that for the sake of the argument that an embryo is considered a person. From this statement she then claims that one can’t effectively argue that abortion is morally impermissible based on whether or not an embryo is a human. After this she presents the basic argument for abortion. The basic argument states the following: A fetus is a person and everyone has a right to life, therefore a fetus has a right to life. The mother has a right to decide what happens in and to he body, but a fetus’ right to life outweighs the mothers right to choose. Therefore, the fetus may not be aborted. However, Thompson refutes the basic argument by saying that abortion is morally permissible in cases where abortion is necessary to save the mother, in cases of rape, or failed contraception. To support her claim that abortion is morally permissible in cases of rape she creates the violin thought experiment. The violin thought experiment is when imaging waking up in the morning and finding yourself attached in bed with an unconscious famous violinist. Whom has been found to have a fatal kidney problem, and the Society of Music Lovers has found that you alone have the right blood type to help him. The society has therefore\n\nIn the article the violinist was compared to rape, because in the violinist scenario the person was kidnapped and plugged in with the violinist without there person volunteering. It's the same with rape you do not volunteer you have no say in the matter. Thomson said people who oppose abortion should make an exception for rape and he certainly agrees with it. So the violinist scenario and the rape scenario are the same in a way because you didn't volunteer and also you have the option of saving the \"person\" or killing them. Thomson says, \"They can say that persons have a right to life only if they didn't come into existence because of rape\". For me this conclusion is right for one the person\n\nThomson acknowledges that fetuses are persons and that they have the right to life. She talks about permission stating that though the fetus has the right to life it does not have the right to your body without permission. She begins with a series of analogies. Her first analogy is the famous violinist, who is on the verge of death and needs someone to plug in to save him. She states that you do not have to\n\nThe violinist that is attached to you needs your kidneys in order to survive the same way a fetus needs its mother in order to survive. Only one thing is that the violinist was plugged to you by the music lovers without your consciousness in which Thomson was trying to refer to rape. You didn’t want this, but it happened. This can also be referred to unprotected sex in which the fetus is unwanted. The violinist doesn’t have the right to your body the same as the fetus with the mother, but the violinist has the right not to be killed just like the fetus. A decent Samaritan would not unplug from the violinist because even though what the music lovers did was unjust he deserves to live (176). This can also be referred to the fetus. The fetus has a right to live even though if it was unwanted during conception. Thomson talks about how we need to be minimal decent Samaritans in which we sacrifice ourselves and take the responsibility for the violinist and the fetus (184). What she is trying to say is that we should not unplug from the violinist and we shouldn’t get"
