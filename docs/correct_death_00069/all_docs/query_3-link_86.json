        "text": "Peter Fonda, the actor son of movie titan Henry Fonda and brother to Jane Fonda, has died of respiratory failure from lung cancer in Los Angeles, his family announced Friday. He was 79.\n\n\"It is with deep sorrow that we share the news that Peter Fonda has passed away,\" according to a statement from the actor's family, issued by the family's longtime publicist Melody Korenbrot.\n\nThe statement said Fonda died at 11:05 a.m. at his home, surrounded by family. The official cause of death was respiratory failure due to lung cancer.\n\n“In one of the saddest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our hearts. As we grieve, we ask that you respect our privacy,\" the statement added.\n\nAnd, while we mourn the loss of this sweet and gracious man, we also wish for all to celebrate his indomitable spirit and love of life. In honor of Peter, please raise a glass to freedom.\"\n\nRecent news:Peter Fonda apologizes for 'vulgar' Barron Trump tweet\n\nJane Fonda said in a statement to USA TODAY that she was \"very sad\" over losing \"my sweet-hearted baby brother. The talker of the family. I have had beautiful alone time with him these last days. He went out laughing.”\n\nAlthough not as well known as his father and sister, Peter Fonda was best known for 1969’s groundbreaking counterculture classic \"Easy Rider.\" Fonda produced, co-wrote and co-starred in the movie along with Dennis Hopper, who directed the film.\n\nFonda played Wyatt, who rode his chopper alongside Hopper's Billy, as the two motorcyclists traveled through the nation's Southwest and Deep South with money from a large cocaine deal. Fonda's Wyatt wore a stars-and-stripes helmet matching his gas tank and called his motorcycle “Captain America,” re-purposing traditional images.\n\nIn \"Easy Rider,\" Wyatt and Billy smoke marijuana, visit a commune and befriend an alcoholic, ACLU attorney George (Jack Nicholson) – who dons a gold football helmet and rides along the back of the chopper until he is killed by rednecks. Wyatt and Billy trip out in New Orleans during Mardi Gras with two prostitutes. The two are shot dead in the end by locals in a random drive-by shooting.\n\nFonda described the film's message to The Hollywood Reporter as, \"A man went looking for America. And couldn't find it anywhere.\n\n\"I knew how it was going to end when I started writing it. That the end would be mine and Dennis' death and nothing beyond that,\" said Fonda. \"People would wonder and ask themselves, what was that? They would have to come back again to figure it out.\"\n\nThe film, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in July, earned Fonda a best original screenplay nomination and was added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry in 1998.\n\nFonda was nominated for a best actor Academy Award for his role playing a beekeeper trying to keep his family together in 1997's \"Ulee’s Gold.\"\n\nHe described working on \"Ulee's Gold\" as the \"most fun\" he had ever had working on a movie. Fonda wore the same wire-rimmed glasses his father wore in \"On Golden Pond,\" but he said he was not channeling Henry Fonda in the performance.\n\nHe lost out on the Oscar to Nicholson, who won for “As Good as It Gets.” Nicholson said in his acceptance speech that it as an honor to be nominated alongside “my old bike pal Fonda.”\n\nFonda also starred in \"The Hired Hand\" and \"The Trip.\"\n\nHe is survived by his third wife, Margaret DeVogelaere, his daughter, actress Bridget Fonda and son, Justin, both from his first marriage to Susan Brewer.\n\nHollywood paid respects. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences remembered the two-time Oscar nominee on Twitter.\n\nDirector Rob Reiner called him a \"revolutionary filmmaker during a revolutionary time...his spirit will be missed.\"\n\nDirector Edgar Wright wrote on Twitter, \"RIP Peter Fonda, counter culture legend, groundbreaking actor and all round real life hero.\"\n\nActress Mia Farrow posted a photo of herself with Fonda, calling him \"a beautiful soul.\"\n\nActor Cary Elwes noted \"legend\" Fonda for his impact on the independent film industry. \"There will never be another like him.\""
