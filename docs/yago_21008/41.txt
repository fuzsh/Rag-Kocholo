Kevin and Perry Go Large (2000)

Director: Ed Bye

Actors: Harry Enfield, Kathy Burke, Rhys Ifans

Synopsis: Horny teenagers, Kevin (Harry Enfield) and Perry (Kathy Burke), make the trip of a lifetime to Ibiza, where they hope to fulfil their ambition of becoming top DJs.

Review: Despite the incredibly short running time – 82 minutes (although maybe that’s a sign of the tenuousness of the whole concept) – Kevin and Perry Go Large still manages to feel too long, and betrays the characters’ origin as a sketch show skit.

It doesn’t take long (only 5 minutes) before the first, surly teenager tantrum rocks in that Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke have mined to such iconic effect in the TV show. Thereafter, the writers pad the material out akin to many TV serials migrating to the big screen – namely, putting the characters through a “high concept” (usually an overseas trip à la Sex and the City 2 and The Inbetweeners). Kevin and Perry are also given an arc familiar to the lads of American Pie and The Inbetweeners where they essentially spend the large chunk of the movie trying to get their end away.

At least there are no pretensions here: it’s all lowest common denominator stuff based around bodily functions (Kevin even eats Perry’s sea poo at one point!) There are also some very non-PC jokes about gays, transvestites and Germans which are a reminder of the age of this film – it was a by-product of Generation Xers rather than the Millennials. In short, the film is instantly forgettable, but perhaps contains a smidgeon of nostalgia value for those who were fans of the TV sketch. (August 2017)
