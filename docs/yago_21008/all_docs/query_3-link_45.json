        "text": "Flawlessness has complications. Perfect teeth, long a Hollywood ideal, have now become the onscreen standard for A-list actors. The rise of orthodontia and the fall of smoking have played roles in bringing about this new normal. But the key factor has undoubtedly been the historic conquest of veneers.\n\nWhile there are notable holdouts — including Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst (who has said of her crooked smile, “That’s what makes me special”) — these days there seems to be an inexorable pull in the industry to go from individualistic snaggle to symmetrical dazzle. This can run upward of $60,000 for a complete set of veneers from one of the town’s top cosmetic dentists. But that’s often deemed worth it in a merciless age of high-def TVs and zoomable photos on social media. After all, second-rate work might mean risking the uncanny “Chiclet” effect and its attendant public scorn.\n\nHollywood’s most in-demand veneer specialists contend that while for some clients the brighter and whiter the better, they prefer to practice toned-down naturalism. “It’s about designing for your face, following your anatomy and contours,” explains Dr. Sam Saleh, whose clientele includes The Weeknd, Doja Cat, and Real Housewives castmembers. Dr. Kevin Sands, whose practice draws the likes of Emma Stone, Miles Teller and Kim Kardashian, agrees: “On a weekly basis, people say, ‘I want [my teeth] to look like Kim Kardashian.’ Well, Kim’s teeth look perfect for Kim.”\n\nDr. Bill Dorfman, who’s worked on everyone from Hugh Jackman and Eva Longoria to Anne Hathaway, notes: “I’ve treated most of the peak A-list celebrities in town, and you’d never know they have veneers. The worst thing in the world for me is if someone walks up to you and says, ‘Oh my God, your veneers look great.’ I don’t want people to know you have them.”\n\nThese dentists strive for verisimilitude by focusing on understated detail. They add texture by finely layering porcelain. They’re mindful of retaining humanistic incongruities via gumline gradation. And they’re sure to introduce translucency at the biting edge of their custom shells. “A dead giveaway for veneers is if you don’t have it,” Dorfman explains.\n\nStill, talent reps wonder if five-figure price tags are worth it as a business investment, especially for up-and-coming talent. “It’s like, I know what you’re making,” says one manager regarding conversations with yet-to-break clients. (Another insider quips that many young actors shoulder “veneers debt” on top of college debt.)\n\nBut the reality is that teeth are rarely a determinant in who gets roles. “If they’re an issue, there are ways of handling it,” explains casting director John Papsidera (Oppenheimer, Yellowstone).\n\nThose handling any issues are effects artisans specializing in dental prosthetics. While they sometimes implement attention-calling appurtenances like fangs, much of their work is about the subtle craft of degrading Hollywood glamour smiles into more banal, lived-in looks. Todd McIntosh, the hair and makeup head on Netflix’s Griselda, noted that seasoned onscreen dental prosthetic designer Art Sakamoto developed several sets of false chompers for Sofía Vergara to play the eponymous real-life Miami drug queenpin, after which McIntosh used specific makeup paint for teeth to yellow them. “Some were more bent and twisted, others more or less yellowed,” he says. “Teeth are a very specific thing. They can overpower. We settled on the least disruptive set: slightly crooked, slightly out of alignment and yellowed from smoking.”\n\nSakamoto — who has conjured distinctive pearlies for Sarah Paulson’s Linda Tripp in Impeachment: American Crime Story and Colin Farrell’s upcoming titular The Penguin — compares wearing prosthetic teeth to donning tailored clothing, which prompts performers to express their bodies in new ways. “It’s physical,” he says. “It affects how they speak and react.”\n\nChristian Tinsley, whose effects studio handles smile issues for such productions as HBO’s Perry Mason, notes that decision-makers become most focused on dental detail when it comes to character-driven period pieces. There are two solutions to help make an actor with too-perfect teeth fit into another decade or century. Less costly is a daily process of applying enamel paints directly to the teeth. “It’s a film-forming makeup,” Tinsley explains. “You can add a nicotine-and-coffee look.” More involved is producing prepainted micro-thin dentures, as Tinsley recently did for Annette Bening on an unnamed 1930s-set project: “All she has to do is pop them on between takes.” This is the best approach for stars whose characters have crooked, chipped or missing teeth.\n\nDental technician Gary Archer — who’s spent three decades tailoring teeth for hundreds of productions, including Austin Powers’ gnarly smile and Mrs. Doubtfire’s dentures — utilizes a method of vacuum-forming plastic akin to Invisalign. Or he’ll use acrylic shells worn over the talent’s own teeth, as in the case of David Oyelowo’s character in Lawmen: Bass Reeves, which imbue the allusion of imperfection needed for the 1860s-set Paramount+ series. Says Archer, “David’s teeth — God bless him — are perfect, but they look incongruous for the time.”\n\nBeatrice Verhoeven contributed to this report."
