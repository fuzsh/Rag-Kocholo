Sarah Hyland and Mila Kunis\n\nThe \"Modern Family\" and \"Ted\" actresses say they get mistaken for the other all the time. Upon meeting each other in December 2010 at a Nylon party, the two decided they'd pretend to be each other in public.\n\n\"She came up to me and said she gets called me all the time too,\" Hyland told InStyle. \"She said that sometimes she pretends she's me because it makes her feel young. I asked if I could pretend to be her next time somebody asks me if I'm her, and she said OK.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Bill Skarsgård and Steve Buscemi\n\nDuring a 2019 appearance on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" Skarsgård said he has heard this resemblance his entire life, even as a child.\n\n\"I had big, soulful eyes,\" Skarsgård said. \"I had a friend who even looked more like Steve Buscemi than I did, I thought. So, the running joke when we were growing up was, 'No, you look like Steve Buscemi. No, you look like Steve Buscemi.'\"\n\nThere's even an Instagram account dedicated to their similar appearances, which Skarsgård said was \"a huge compliment.\"\n\n\"I think he has one of the best faces in the business,\" Skarsgård said of the \"Boardwalk Empire\" actor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Amy Adams and Isla Fisher\n\nDespite the eye color difference, the \"Arrival\" and \"Bachelorette\" actresses get confused often. Fisher joked about the duo's striking resemblance in her cover story with Allure in January 2009.\n\n\"If 'Shopaholic' is a hit, then it was Isla Fisher in the movie,\" said Fisher. \" ... and if it doesn't work out, it was Amy Adams.\"\n\nFisher used Adams' photo in her Christmas card one year and fooled both family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Margot Robbie and Samara Weaving\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Weaving, who has starred in \"Ready or Not,\" told Who magazine she has been mistaken for the Oscar-nominated actor plenty of times, with fans requesting photos.\n\n\"I've tried saying, 'No, it's not who you think it is,' but because I also have an Australian accent, people still think I'm Margot and that she's being really rude. Now I just stand there like her,\" Weaving said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes\n\nNeeson has said people often confuse the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Taken\" stars. That shouldn't be too much of a surprise since the two have starred in multiple films alongside each other (\"Schindler's List,\" \"Wrath of the Titans\"). The only difference is that Fiennes usually plays the bad guy while Neeson's the hero.\n\n\"He is one of my best, best, dearest friends. I keep getting fans and stuff mixing me up with Ralph because we have very similar profiles,\" Neeson said on The Jonathan Ross Show in 2014. \"So I've been complimented on winning a Tony Award for my Hamlet, he's been complimented on the 'Taken' movies.\"\n\nYou can watch Neeson discuss their similarity more here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley\n\nShort, long, curly, or straight hair, Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman look strikingly similar no matter how you pair them.\n\nThe two look so similar, Knightley played Portman's double, Sabé, in \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Katy Perry and Zooey Deschanel\n\nThe \"New Girl\" actress was initially kind of frustrated when fans confused the two.\n\n\"It's a little bit annoying, to be totally blunt,\" Deschanel told MTV back in 2009. \"The only similarity that we have is that we look a little bit alike.\"\n\nThe actress has since appeared to warm up to the similarity.\n\n\"I was relieved because everyone kept saying 'this girl looks so much like you,'\" she told Letterman in November 2012. \"And then I met her and I was like, 'Thank God she's attractive!' I was worried she was gonna be an unattractive person.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Will Ferrell and Chad Smith\n\nThe comedian and Red Hot Chili Pepper drummer know they look so similar that they took their rivalry to \"Jimmy Fallon\" in 2014 in a drum-off. The pair even dressed alike.\n\nYou can watch their competition here and see their equally humorous interview here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard\n\nThe actresses are well aware that fans get them mixed up.\n\n\"We did 'Help' together and that was the first time we like grabbed each other and said, 'Let's look in the mirror,'\" Chastain told Jimmy Fallon in 2015. \"And we looked at our faces side by side and we were like, 'Okay, we look alike.'\"\n\nChastain recalled how she was mixed up with the \"Jurassic World\" star later and how she sometimes just goes with it. The two are good sports about it though and have tried to clear up all the confusion.\n\nHoward made a short dubsmash clip where she let's people know who's who. It caught the attention of Chastain who shared it on Instagram. In May 2015, Chastain shared a funny image on Twitter poking fun at how people can't tell them apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek\n\nThe official Oscars Instagram even confused the two back in 2014.\n\nIn real life, the two are really good friends and take selfies with each other. They have a nickname for one another, too — huevos — which is Spanish for eggs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Nathan Fillion and Jeremy Renner\n\nWhenever we flip past ABC's \"Castle\" we think we're catching sight of \"The Avengers\" star on screen. In 2014, Fillion took to Twitter to discuss various celebs that fans think he looks like. How did he grade Renner? \"Brothers.\"\n\nFillion said he has also spoken with Jason Bateman about their resemblance to one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Millie Bobby Brown and Natalie Portman\n\nNatalie Portman makes this list twice! In January 2018, fans took to Twitter to note the resemblance between \"Stranger Things\" star Millie Bobby Brown and a young Portman.\n\nCan we get these two to play sisters in a movie?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. Halsey and Millie Bobby Brown\n\nSinger Halsey told Jimmy Fallon they thought Millie Bobby Brown would be perfect to play them in a biopic, noting their similar appearances.\n\n\"Millie would be great,\" Halsey said. \"But I don't really think I'm famous enough to cast Millie.\"\n\nThey added: \"It's kind of uncanny how much we look alike. It's like, 'Oh no, we actually just look like sisters.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. Jesse Eisenberg and Michael Cera\n\nPeople mix these actors up all the time, according to \"Arrested Development\" actor Cera.\n\n\"I bumped into Jesse on the street once and he told me he gets it once a day,\" Cera told the New York Post in 2014. \"People think he's Michael Cera.\"\n\nCera said he gets mistaken for other people too, including Jon Heder (\"Napoleon Dynamite\").\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Coco Jones and Jennifer Hudson\n\nSince 2012, \"Bel-Air\" star Coco Jones has said she's received comparisons to the EGOT winner.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"The Jennifer Hudson Show,\" Hudson asked the crowd whether or not the two looked alike.\n\nWhen they received a resounding yes, they shared how they're often mistaken for each other.\n\n\"I get that so often that, honestly at this point, I just play into it,\" Jones told Hudson.\n\n\"I get people saying that all the time,\" Hudson responded, adding, \"I don't tell them I'm Jennifer Hudson, but I'll be like, 'Coco Jones? No, but thank you!'\" Hudson said.\n\n\"I take it as such a compliment,\" Jones told Hudson. \"You know you have been so impactful in my life, just watching you, another beautiful, dark-skinned woman just killing it. That's my motivation.\"\n\n16. Jennifer Connelly and Demi Moore\n\nIf it weren't for Connelly's fuller brows, we would think these two were interchangeable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Ryan Seacrest and Joel McHale\n\nThis is a running joke between the two that has been referenced numerous times on NBC's \"Community.\"\n\nMcHale even took over Seacrest's Twitter handle and website one day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n18. Zoe Saldaña and Thandie Newton\n\nZoe Saldaña said on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" she doesn't only get mistaken for the \"Westworld\" actress, but also Kerry Washington.\n\n\"Sometimes I'll just be walking down the street and I'll have people go, 'Hey, Thandie Newton,'\" Saldaña said in 2013. \"It's like, 'Oh my god, your show on TV is amazing, Ms. Washington.' So it's sort of like ... it humbles you.\"\n\nAnd it's not just fans. Saldana told The Hollywood Reporter her mom saw Newton on a poster for \"Crash\" and thought it was her daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. Evan Rachel Wood and Rachel Brosnahan\n\nNewton isn't the only \"Westwood\" star with a Hollywood doppelganger.

John Mulaney and Grant Gustin\n\nCan we get Mulaney to play an alternate version of Barry Allen on the CW series?

Hilary Swank and Jennifer Garner\n\nThe two-time Oscar winner told Conan O'Brien she has been mistaken for the \"Alias\" actress.\n\n\"I do. In fact, people get angry at me because they think that I'm just trying not to sign an autograph for them or take a picture,\" Swank told O'Brien of when fans incorrectly identify her in public.\n\nSwank said it gets to the point where fans won't believe her when she tells them she's not Garner, so she'll relent.\n\n\"They actually said, 'Don't be a b---h,'\" she added. \"I didn't want to give her a bad name, so I took a photo with them. Maybe someone will say some day, 'That's not Jennifer Garner.'\"\n\nSwank said she told Garner about it and was surprised to hear she gets the same.\n\n22. Paul Reubens and Alan Cumming\n\nOnly one of these actors is Pee Wee Herman. The other you probably know from his role on \"The Good Wife.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n23.

Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon\n\nEven Matt Damon says he suffers from a case of mistaken identity every now and then with the \"Transformers\" actor. In 2013, \"The Martian\" actor told Absolute Radio that he discussed the fan confusion with Wahlberg.\n\n\"I've talked to Mark about this because he gets people [that] come up and say, 'I love you in 'The Bourne Identity,'\" he said. \"So Mark and I have a deal. If we're mistaken for one another, we have to be as polite as possible.\"\n\nDamon said he has even signed his name as Mark's.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n36. Nina Dobrev and Victoria Justice\n\nEven Victoria Justice believes she's the \"Vampire Diaries\" star's real life doppelgänger. That's how she introduced the actress when she presented Dobrev with an award at the Teen Choice Awards back in summer 2015.\n\nFans later freaked out when the two took a photo together at a polo event that same year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n37. Lucy Hale and Selena Gomez\n\nThe \"Pretty Little Liars\" actress has previously said she would always get mistaken for the singer when younger and she would play along.\n\n\"When I was younger, it was a lot of Selena Gomez, during her 'Wizards of Waverly Place' days,\" Hale told Insider. \"Usually, I would correct them, but I remember there was this one time, it was this older lady in an airport, and she was like, 'Can I get a picture with you?' I thought that she thought I was Lucy.\"\n\n\"Afterward she started listing off the projects that she liked of mine and I quickly realized that she thought I was Selena.

Margot Robbie and Jaime Pressly\n\nRobbie and Pressly haven't spoken out about getting mistaken for one another, but fans think the two are dead ringers despite a 13-year age difference.\n\nIn case you think they're the same person, they have been photographed together and their resemblance is uncanny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n30. Emma Mackey and Margot Robbie\n\nAs soon as \"Sex Education\" debuted on Netflix many thought young actress Emma Mackey looked a lot like the \"Suicide Squad\" star.\n\nMackey told UK publication PinkNews she heard the comparisons. While she said that's great, she hopes fans will judge her acting based on her skills.\n\n\"I hope that people will see past the physical aspects of my person and focus on my job as opposed to my looks, if that's okay with you all,\" said Mackey.\n\nDuring the 2023 \"Barbie\" tour, Robbie told Buzzfeed she's been mistaken for Mackey in public and rolls with it.\n\n\"When people come up and say, 'I loved you in 'Sex Education,' I just say 'Thank you. Thank you so much,'\" Robbie said.\n\nTheir similar appearances led to Robbie and director Greta Gerwig to discuss a role for Mackey in the film. Mackey does appear in the movie, but a joke about the two stars looking alike was scrapped when they realized they didn't look that similar, after all.\n\n\"Once we got all dressed up as our Barbies, we were kind of like, 'We don't actually look that similar,'\" Robbie told Buzzfeed. \"So, we didn't put that joke in the movie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n31. Regina Hall and Regina King\n\nRegina Hall said she gets mistaken for Regina King often, and she's OK with it because she winds up getting some of her freebies.\n\n\"I hope she wins [more awards], because people get us confused and I get all the perks,\" said Hall at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards in January 2019, according to People. \"Seriously, they're like 'Here's a gift certificate for Regina King, for $5,000 for Barney's' and I'm just like, 'I'm her!'\"\n\nLast year, King won the Oscar for best supporting actress in \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n32.

Odeya Rush and Mila Kunis\n\nAfter Netflix released \"Let It Snow,\" fans immediately thought one of the young stars, Odeya Rush, resembled a younger Mila Kunis.

Zach Braff and Dax Shepard\n\nEven Braff knows the two look alike.

Leelee Sobieski and Jennifer Lawrence\n\nBefore Jennifer Lawrence became one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, there was Leelee Sobieski, who you may remember from \"The Glass House.\" The two look strikingly similar whether they don short or long hairdos.\n\nSobieski — who some say also resembles a young Helen Hunt — left Hollywood to focus on being a mother to her two children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n38.

But those people would be wrong because that's Ewan McGregor,\" he said. \"He's the other Scottish actor.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n39. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Javier Bardem.\n\nWhen Jeffrey Dean Morgan entered Seattle Grace Hospital on ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy\" we had to do a double take to make sure he wasn't the Academy Award winner.\n\nMorgan is now breaking hearts (and bodies) on \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n40. Helen Mirren and Alexandra Grant\n\nAfter Keanu Reeves stepped out with girlfriend, artist Alexandra Grant, fans immediately started confusing her for \"The Queen\" actress, Helen Mirren.\n\n\"That was very flattering on me, you know, because she's obviously lovely,\" Mirren told \"Entertainment Tonight\" of the comparisons.\n\nMirren has been married to director Taylor Hackford for more than 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n41.

Rowling's popular franchise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n42. Gerard Butler and Clive Owen\n\nWe're not the first to confuse the \"300\" and \"Children of Men\" actors.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, we remember Butler is more likely to star in romantic comedies (\"Bounty Hunter,\" \"P.S. I Love You\").\n\nAdvertisement\n\n43. Glenn Close and Cloris Leachman\n\nGlenn Close told Jimmy Fallon she was mistaken for actress Cloris Leachman by an excited fan while at the premiere for her new movie, \"The Wife.\"\n\n\"I was in the hotel and I was in the elevator and the doors opened and this woman — she had dark glasses on. She said, 'Cloris Leachman!'\" said Close.\n\nThough Close tried to correct her, the fan wasn't having it.\n\n\"And I said, 'No, I'm Glenn Close,' She said, 'No, you're not!'\" Close recalled. \"And I said, 'Yes, I am.' And then she said, 'I meant that!'\"\n\nClose said she went to her hotel room, and while she believes Leachman is a wonderful actress, she found Leachman was born in 1926 and is 92. Close is 71.\n\n44. Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nEver since the two co-starred in \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" we always thought Gordon-Levitt could play the late Ledger's twin.\n\nRead next\n\nCelebrities Margot Robbie Barbie\n\nAdvertisement"
