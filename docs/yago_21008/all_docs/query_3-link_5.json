        "text": "Another change in the second season was the sound of Twiki's voice. Mel Blanc left the series after the end of the first season and another actor, Bob Elyea, supplied Twiki's voice.\n\nBlanc returned for the final six episodes of the second season, though no explanation was given for the change in Twiki's voice\n\nYou sure about that? I've watched the episode referred to as being the pilot several times, and it's the same actress playing the mother then as it was all throughout Sheen's years (and maybe still, I no longer watch it). Is there another, very little broadcast, 'genuine' pilot or something?\n\nMy personal fav is the replacement of Will and Carlton's Aunt on Fresh Prince, where they actively make it part of the show. Jeff is round at the mansion and he's eyeing her suspiciously, as if to say 'I don't know what it is, but there's something different about you today Mrs Banks'.\n\nIn the sitcom May to December, the character of Zoe was played by Eve Matheson in the first two seasons but was then replaced by Lesley Dunlop.\n\nAnd I remember when I used to watch Home and Away years ago, there was a character called Selina - the actress who played her was ill for a few episodes but instead of writing Selina out until the actress recovered, they had another actress playing Selina for a few episodes. Bizarre!\n\nKevin's father has been played by four actors:\n\nMartyn Whitby in Harry Enfield's Television Programme - before Kevin was a teenager.\n\nDuncan Preston in Harry Enfield and Chums\n\nStephen Moore in Harry Enfield and Chums - Moore replaced Preston in the mid-1990s.\n\nJames Fleet in Kevin & Perry Go Large - a full length feature film based on the character.\n\nKevin's mother has been played by two actors:\n\nCaroline Quentin in Harry Enfield's Television Programme - before Kevin was a teenager.\n\nLouisa Rix in Harry Enfield and Chums and Kevin & Perry Go Large"
