        "text": "An Academy Awards voter’s mission of sifting through a field of over 300 movies is more daunting than many awards enthusiasts assume. And when it comes to performances, that task becomes even more expansive.\n\nFrom Hollywood stalwarts like Jeff Daniels and Donald Sutherland to crowd favorites such as Zendaya and Oscar Isaac, numerous esteemed actors are still eagerly awaiting their names to be called on Oscar nomination morning. Variety has compiled a ranking of the top 40 living actors who have yet to receive their first Oscar nod.\n\nWhile some incredibly talented actors have earned nominations in non-acting categories over the years—explaining their absence from this list—such as Julie Delpy (a two-time adapted screenplay nominee for “Before Sunset” in 2004 and “Before Midnight” in 2013), Jeff Goldblum (nominated for live action short for “Little Surprises” in 1996), and Owen Wilson (recognized for original screenplay for “The Royal Tenenbaums” in 2001), the list remains extensive and ever-changing.\n\nNonetheless, this list is vast, and ever-changing. Read below.\n\nHonorable mentions: Steve Buscemi (“Ghost World”), Billy Crudup (“The Stanford Prison Experiment”), Billy Crystal (“When Harry Met Sally”), Blythe Danner (“I’ll See You In My Dreams”), Idris Elba (“Beasts of No Nation”), Mia Farrow (“Hannah and Her Sisters”), Gong Li (“Memoirs of a Geisha”), James McAvoy (“Atonement”), Martin Sheen (“Apocalypse Now”), John David Washington (“BlacKkKlansman”)\n\nRead Variety’s Awards Circuit for the latest Oscars predictions in all categories.\n\nUpdate: Original entrants from March 16, 2022 — Ana DeArmas (#25), Brian Tyree Henry (#18), Colin Farrell (#14), Emily Blunt (#10) and Michelle Yeoh (#2) — were removed from the list after receiving Oscar noms."
