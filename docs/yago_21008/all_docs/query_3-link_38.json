        "text": "Jamie Lee Curtis helped her co-star and friend Cate Blanchett dodge a red carpet catastrophe this week as they promoted their new movie, Borderlands.\n\nTrue to form, the actors opted for stunning ensembles as they appeared at a fan event in Los Angeles. Cate wore a striking metallic top by Swedish brand Hodakova that was constructed out of 102 antique spoons, while Jamie opted for a red blazer and trousers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the two women posed for photos, however, they appeared to be standing unusually close to one another.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, Jamue was helping Cate conceal what appeared to be a rip in her pants.\n\nBoth women appeared to be in good spirits, with the Freaky Friday star playfully shutting down the ET reporter’s inquiry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Nothing is going on,” she quipped. “You know what is going on? I got her back.”\n\nAs Cate pointed out, though, Jamie’s on-the-fly assistance was indicative of the overall support the Halloween actor provides to her co-stars.\n\n“On every single movie that Jamie makes, she is a den mother,” she said.\n\nIn cinemas now, Borderlands is based on the popular video game series of the same name.\n\nIt follows Lilith (played by Cate), a hard-boiled bounty hunter who calls in a trio of treasure seekers (portrayed by Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Florian Munteanu) to help her rescue an arms dealer’s missing daughter.\n\nSpeaking to USA Today, Cate said she found the game to be “quite addictive,” and said she was impressed that it featured so many strong female characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I mean, it’s not The Grapes Of Wrath. It’s not Blade Runner. It’s its own strange, weird thing, and when you look at the casting, there’s a motley quality to it,” she explained."
