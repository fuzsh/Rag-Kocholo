        "text": "Kathy Burke has hailed a Kevin and Perry duo who took Hardwick Live by storm.\n\nThe Kevin and Perry lookalikes left festival-goers speechless when they dressed up as the famous ‘dumb-duo’ from the cult classic movie.\n\nBritish sitcom star Kathy, 57, praised the hysterical lookalikes after she was tagged in clip of the pair bursting out some epic dance moves while at the festival.\n\nKathy, who became a household name after the 2000 flick crafted by Harry Enfield, shared her disbelief over the uncanny similarities between the creative festival-goer and her famed character.\n\nKathy portrayed cheeky teenage boy Perry Carter while her co-star Harry played his best friend, Kevin Patterson.\n\n“If I wasn’t so much older and wider I’d swear this was me,” she wrote while retweeting the hilarious clip.\n\n“Lovely stuff,” the star added.\n\nIt wasn’t just Kathy who was impressed by the genius rendition of the pair’s iconic dance.\n\nDo you know the Kevin and Perry lookalikes? Get in touch at webcelebs@trinitymirror.com\n\nAfter laying eyes on the side-splitting video, fans flocked in their dozens to praise the lookalike duo.\n\n“I have genuinely never seen two people look and act so alike. This is crazy,” tweeted one viewer.\n\n“Literally would have 100% believed this was Kathy and Harry. Fair play to these legends,” another echoed.\n\n“WOW! This is insane. It’s as if they were separated at birth lol,” someone else voiced.\n\nMeanwhile, a fourth quipped: “My goodness this just brought me back about twenty years. If Kathy is feeling old, she’s not the only one.”\n\nThe 2000 teen coming of age sex comedy was initially based on the Harry Enfield sketch Kevin the Teenager.\n\nThe film was written by Dave Cummings and Harry Enfield and directed by Ed Bye.\n\nEnfield, Kathy Burke and Louisa Rix all return to their roles after previously appearing on Harry Enfield & Chums.\n\nHowever, James Fleet replaced Stephen Moore as Kevin's father in the flick.\n\nAlthough the film received mixed reviews upon release, it has since gained a cult following - primarily due to its soundtrack."
