Is that weird? Do we all have weird things like that? I think we do. I just shared mine with the world.\"\n\nThe former 'American Idol' judge also admitted that, these days, a lot of the space in her bag is given over to her daughter's essentials.\n\nShe said: \"[I] always have a snack, always have water for her. Always have, like, a little toy or something that she can play with.\"\n\nKaty also \"swears by\" a Solawave red light therapy wand - but she \"stole\" the \"handy\" gadget from her 47-year-old partner.\n\nShe said: \"When I'm not wearing make-up, I do some skin prep. Okay, I swear by this little guy. It's called the Solawave.\n\n\"I stole this from Orlando's [Golden] Globes gift basket.\n\n\"It's just this little pen, and it's so handy, dandy.\n\n\"Turn it on. And it's red light therapy. And I just go up, up, up. I'm doing work, I'm taking calls. Red light therapy just helps create more collagen, I think, and bring your skin back to life. Health is wealth.\"\n\nThe 'Teenage Dream' singer credited the 'Lord of the Rings' actor for being the reason why she carries around so many different vitamins and health supplements.\n\nShe said: \"Orlando is very healthy, like annoyingly healthy.\""
