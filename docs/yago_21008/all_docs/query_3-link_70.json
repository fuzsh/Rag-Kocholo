        "text": "This post has been updated with new clues, confirmations, and eliminations.\n\nClaim to Fame is the perfect summer reality series: It’s mindless and low-stakes enough to feel breezy, but also invites enough wild speculation to make it seem like it somehow matters if someone is Jason Aldean’s cousin or Nick Cannon’s brother. And because we’re playing along at home with the contestants trying to sniff out their fellow fame-adjacents before getting eliminated themselves, it’s more satisfying than, say, The Masked Singer, where the embarrassingly off-base guesses Jenny McCarthy and company have been known to throw around can make the show’s reveals anti-climactic. On Claim to Fame, when it’s revealed that someone is Tom Hanks’s niece, that shit lands.\n\nThe contestants on Claim to Fame also don’t necessarily aspire to be famous and they’re not thrashing around in some desperate attempt to remain relevant, a la RuPaul’s Secret Celebrity Drag Race or We Are Family. Sure, some of them would undoubtedly love to come out on the other side with a few more social-media followers and some name recognition of their own, but most of them seem to genuinely be in it for the $100,000 in prize money, which — for the very un-famous relative of someone actually famous — is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nBut who are the celebrity relatives of these 11 hopefuls who are vying for not only the Claim to Fame crown but for the hard-earned approval of hosts Kevin and Franklin Jonas? Here are our best guesses based on a combination of in-show clues and online sleuthing, updated weekly as contestants are eliminated and new clues are revealed.\n\nWho is Adam’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Adam: In the premiere episode’s game of two truths and a lie, he says his celebrity relative is his uncle, who’s an actor, and who has won a Grammy. Later on, Adam reveals that his relative is a singer who was most famous in the ’80s and ’90s, and that he actually sounds quite a lot like him when he sings. We also know, from the senses game, that his relative has or had a famous mullet, and that some part of their name starts with “Bolt.”\n\nWhy it’s Michael Bolton: Redditors put this one together before the season aired, figuring out through some rabbit-hole sleuthing that Adam’s real name is Adam Christoferson, and that his mother’s brother is the ’90s balladeer. But beyond that, honestly, just look at him. Throw a wig on Adam and shave back that beard, and that’s Michael Bolton right there. The wine bottle clue, “long haired ’90s singer who sang ballads,” only confirms it.\n\nWhy it might not be Michael Bolton: Perhaps there could be some other long-haired ’90s balladeer with “Bolt” in his name, but good luck thinking of one.\n\nWho is Bianca’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Bianca: Her two truths and a lie are that her famous relative is her aunt who’s an actress, and who’s won a Peabody Award. The latter clue seems specific enough to not be a lie, and there are very few actresses who also have Peabodies, so it’s safe to assume it’s her aunt.\n\nWhy it’s Robin Roberts: Typically, Peabody Awards are given for excellence in reporting, though they have also gone to other media trailblazers like Carol Burnett, Quinta Brunson, Issa Rae, Lily Tomlin, and Terry Gross. Bianca seems to at least be in her thirties, which would most likely mean her aunt is in her fifties or sixties. While it could have been Oprah, there’s something about Claim to Fame’s ABC connection that made us think it’s Robin Roberts, host of Good Morning America — which was confirmd when Bianca was eliminated in the first episode, greeted in defeat by a nice video from her aunt.\n\nWho is Danny’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Danny: Danny’s two truths and a lie clues are that his relative is his uncle, who’s a pro wrestler, and who’s won a Grammy. While a lot of contestants seem to think he looks like Jelly Roll, Mr. Roll is only 39 and has never won a Grammy, though he was nominated. Danny’s wine-bottle clue in the episode with the senses challenge adds some clarity when we learn that his singer relative is a “Man on Fire” who at once fell for J.Lo.\n\nWhy it’s Marc Anthony: It took a few weeks, but one online fan managed to put this one together based on the canoe spelling bee. As Reddit user Savegeo9872 wrote, “seeing ‘maracas’ made me think he [had] to have ties to something Latin. Looking at him over and over he reminded me of a singer’s son.” Fast-forward a few Google-heavy hours later, and the answer was revealed: Danny is actually Nael Zayas, son of Marc Anthony’s brother, Bigram Zayas, which was verified when he was eliminated on a bad guess in episode six.\n\nWho is Dedrick’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Dedrick: Dedrick’s two truths and a lie are that his famous relative is his uncle, who’s a singer, and who won a “Best Rock Song,” award, an assertion that’s too vague to possibly be true. (Get better at lying, Dedrick!) Later we learn that his uncle is “one of the most famous and iconic people in the world,” and in a thrown-off comment, Dedrick slips and calls himself “Mr. Jackson.” For someone who’s on a reality show where you keep your identity hidden, Dedrick really plays fast and loose with over-the-top celebrity stories, telling Danny that his (presumably deceased) uncle showed up once at 2 a.m. to take him to a closed-down Toys “R” Us for a shopping spree, and that Charlie Sheen tried to give his uncle a Ferrari but that he couldn’t drive.\n\nWhy it’s Michael Jackson: If you’re talking about the Venn diagram of people old enough to be uncles and who are also “the most famous and iconic” singers “in the world,” that pool of people is very, very small. Throw in the “Mr. Jackson” flub, plus a wine-bottle clue that summoned up both The Wiz and the moonwalk, and the aviator glasses and multiple mirrors on the clue wall (not to mention a little online sleuthing), and we’re putting all our money on Michael Jackson — a suspicion that was confirmed when Dedrick was eliminated with a very bad Owen Wilson guess in episode five.\n\nWho is Gracie Lou’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Gracie Lou: Her two truths and a lie are that her famous relative is her uncle, who’s a musician, and who has an Emmy. She tells the camera in the premiere that she wants people to think she’s country royalty, but that she’s really just playing a game based on her down-home name. She’s a double-agent in cowboy boots.\n\nWhy it’s Jon Cryer: All the credit for this one goes to Redditors, who figured out that Gracie Lou is her stage name and that her real name — Gracie Hyland — makes her Jon Cryer’s niece. This was confirmed when Gracie Lou was eliminated at the end of episode two and welcomed back into the real world by her uncle Ducky.\n\nWho is Hud’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Hud: Hud’s two truths and a lie are that his famous relative is his mom, who’s a singer, and who has a Grammy. Hud also has a mustache. Naomi pulled his wine-bottle rebus clue in episode two, which featured a cherry, a bomb, a painter (?), an owl, a hurt knee, a sewing needle, and a thumbs-up. Naomi thinks this means his mom is the Runaways’ Cherie Currie, but we’re not so sure. After all, if people in the house don’t know who Antonio Banderas is, would they know Cherie Currie? (Sorry, Ms. Currie.)\n\nWhy it’s John Mellencamp: If you’re of a certain age, and remember John Mellencamp’s ’90s marriage to model Elaine Irwin, then you also remember that the pair had two kids: Hud and Speck. (The “Little Pink Houses” singer also has three other kids, including former Real Housewife Teddi Mellencamp.) Hud also looks just like his parents, something the mustache is perhaps intended to obscure. Also, that rebus totally amounts to “Come on baby, make it hurt so good.”\n\nWhy it might not be John Mellencamp: Maybe some other famous singer has a kid named Hud. Also, there’s nothing that screams Mellencamp on the clue wall, but maybe Claim to Fame just didn’t want to make it too obvious.\n\nWho is Jill’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Jill: Jill’s two truths and a lie are that she’s there for her grandfather, an actor, who has a People’s Choice Award. As of right now, that’s pretty much all we know about Jill, other than that she’s really good at that magic trick where you pull stuff out of your mouth.\n\nWhy it’s John Stamos: Jill’s celebrity relative was a big mystery right up until she was eliminated at the end of the second episode thanks to a faulty guess aimed at Miguel. No one ever made guesses about Jill’s relative or even mentioned John Stamos, but apparently he’s her maternal uncle. Jill was a bit too quiet to really make waves on Claim to Fame, which is kind of sad because if she’d been able to hang in there, she might have made it pretty far.\n\nWho is Mackenzie’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Mackenzie: Mackenzie’s pretty quick out of the gate to let us know that, while she claims to be related to someone with a Tony, that’s absolutely false. So instead we know her dad is a singer. Mackenzie also says that “goatee,” a word that was up for grabs at the boat challenge, relates to her relative.\n\nWhy it’s Trace Adkins: Mackenzie is so cute and country that it doesn’t take much Googling to figure out that her dad is country icon Trace Adkins. She even kind of looks like him if you squint.\n\nWhy it might not be Trace Adkins: It’s unclear what clues on the board point to Trace Adkins, but that could just be because — like, we assume, more than a few of the contestants — we don’t know all that much about him.\n\nWho is Miguel’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Miguel: One of the first two people to fall into the bottom, Miguel is a bit of a wild card. He quickly tells us that he’s lying about his grandpa being his relative, but that his person is an actor and an Oscar winner. He also says he’s using a fake name to make people think he’s “more Spanish” than he really is, and that he’s playing the game because he wants to help his mom, which does make you think his mom isn’t the famous person. We also know Miguel’s relative isn’t Antonio Banderas, thanks to a faulty guess from Jill at the end of episode two that — we come to find out — Miguel actually led her right into.\n\nWhy it’s Jamie Lee Curtis: Redditors figured this one out again, but a quick Google and Miguel’s elimination at the end of episode three prove it: Miguel’s real name is Raphael, and his aunt is Jamie Lee Curtis. His mom is Jamie Lee’s half-sister Allegra Curtis, and his grandpa is the legendary Tony Curtis, to whom he bears a passing resemblance. Not that there’s any love lost between his mother and his grandfather: The late patriarch re-wrote his will in his later years, cutting off all his children and leaving everything to his fifth wife.\n\nWho is Naomi’s celebrity relative?\n\nWhat we know about Naomi:\n\nNaomi is a slippery one, though we do know a little more about her than some other contestants. Her two truths and a lie are that her cousin is a singer, and won the Young Artist Award. Gracie Lou also got a wine-bottle rebus clue about Naomi in the first episode, which revealed characters amounting to “brat pack,” as well as an arrow, a bracket, a tiara, a spiky mace, and four mugs with croissants. Naomi says Gracie Lou’s mention of The Breakfast Club gave her “a mini heart attack” and that her relative and Gracie Lou’s uncle, Jon Cryer, “have more in common than either one of us realized.” There’s also a pink diamond ring on the clue wall that seems to irk Naomi.\n\nWhy it’s Molly Ringwald: The Brat Pack hint narrows Naomi’s possibilities pretty greatly, especially if you couple that with our guess that the mace, mugs, and croissants suggest The Breakfast Club. Naomi’s elimination at the end of episode four confirms that the mom of three’s relative is Ringwald, who she says she really got to know as a young adult.\n\nWho is Shane’s celebrity relative?"
