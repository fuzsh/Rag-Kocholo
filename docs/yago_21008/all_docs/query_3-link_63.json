        "text": "“So now I gotta cut loose… Footloose…” Don’t deny it. You’re already singing along and shaking your head to the beat, aren’t you? The 1984 classic film and song of the same name, Footloose, has a very special place in our hearts. This year, both turn 40! In the film, we are introduced to the small town of Bomont, USA. This town doesn’t have any fun and has banned dancing and rock and roll music. When Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) rolls into town from the big city of Chicago, he doesn’t exactly take these rules well.\n\nAs crazy as it seems that an entire town would ban dancing, it was based on a true story about a town called Elmore City, Oklahoma which banned dancing for religious reasons. Of course, in the movie, things change and there is a whole lot of singing and dancing at the end. Now, let’s find out what happened to some of the surviving stars of the movie and what they’re up to now. We must note that Chris Penn, who played Willard Hewitt sadly died in 2006 at the age of 40.\n\nKevin Bacon (65)\n\nRen McCormack\n\nBacon got his big break in Footloose and went on to appear in some huge films including Apollo 13 and A Few Good Men. In addition to acting, he has also directed movies and television shows. When he starred in the film Lemon Sky, he met his wife, fellow actor Kyra Sedgwick and they have been together for 35 years. Recently, news broke that they have both been cast in the upcoming film Connescence, working together for the first time in 20 years.\n\nBacon embraced the social phenomenon around him and created a nonprofit podcast called Six Degrees with Kevin Bacon. It was inspired by the idea of six degrees of separation, with many people noting that almost every actor is only six people away (or less!) from working with Bacon.\n\nLori Singer (66)\n\nAriel Moore\n\nLori Singer portrayed Ariel, the Reverend’s daughter who was brave enough to fight against the town’s rules and fell in love with Ren. Prior to acting, Singer was admitted to the Oregon Symphony at 13 and accepted to the Julliard School, becoming the youngest person to graduate. She began modeling and acting in the ’80s. In more recent years, she decided to go back to music and sang at Carnegie Hall. Singer worked as an executive producer on the documentary Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God (2012) about sexual abuse in the church, which won three Emmys.\n\nIn 2023, she starred as the main character in the film Rachel Hendrix.\n\nJohn Lithgow (78)\n\nReverend Shaw Moore\n\nLithgow was already pretty famous when he was cast in Footloose after appearing on Broadway, TV, and in movies. After Footloose, he became known for the show 3rd Rock from the Sun. In more recent years, he appeared as Winston Churchill in The Crown, wrote and starred in his own solo play called John Lithgow: Stories by Heart, appeared in the Perry Mason reboot, and in the film Killers of the Flower Moon. He is set to appear in a film called Spellbound this year and in a play titled Giant at London’s Royal Court Theatre.\n\nLithgow has also written several books and recorded music for children.\n\nDianne Wiest (76)\n\nVi Moore\n\nOver the years, Wiest and Lithgow collaborated many times, including playing husband and wife in Footloose. This was her first big movie as she mostly appeared on Broadway before that. She won an Academy Award for her role in Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986.\n\nShe has appeared in films and shows such as The Lost Boys, Parenthood, Practical Magic and Law & Order. Her most recent role is in Mayor of Kingstown as Miriam McClusky.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker (59)\n\nRusty\n\nParker began working in Hollywood as a child. After Footloose, she only became more popular when she got the role of Carrie in Sex and the City. She currently stars and produces the sequel series And Just Like That… She also recently appeared in the Hocus Pocus sequel, which was highly-anticipated after the first ’90s film came out. She is married to fellow actor Matthew Broderick.\n\nThe pair worked together in several Broadway and off-Broadway productions including How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Plaza Suite."
