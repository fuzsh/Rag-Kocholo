Essentially, it is a coming-of-age story concerning the exploits of (as the title indicates) self-proclaimed 'superstar DJ's' 'Kev P.' (Harry Enfield) and 'Perr. E.' (Kathy Burke), as they holiday in Ibiza with Kevin's reluctant parents, Mr and Mrs Patterson (James Fleet and Louisa Rix). It should be noted that the characters of Kevin and Perry originated from Harry Enfield's sketch show, imaginatively titled Harry Enfield and Chums.\n\nKevin and Perry are both approximately sixteen years old, and behave as teenage boys typically would. During their time in Ibiza, they aim to lose their virginity to two equally hormone-addled and awkward girls, Candice and Gemma (Laura Fraser and Tabitha Wady), and gain the friendship of the real superstar DJ du jour, Eyeball Paul (Rhys Ifans). Hilarity Ensues.\n\nThis film contains examples of the following tropes:[]\n\nAll Men Are Perverts: Kevin and Perry salivate over anything with boobs and a pulse, and Eyeball Paul has 'club babes' with names like 'Buttasha' 'Twattia' and 'Wankette'.\n\nCatch Phrase: Many.\n\n\"THAT IS SO UNFAIR!\"\n\n\"I am not your slave!\"\n\n\"Havin' it large!\"\n\nCaught with Your Pants Down: In the opening scene, Kevin is having a fantasy about shagging Anne Boleyn.\n\nMrs Patterson: Kevin! How's your homework going?\n\nKevin: Fine, until you came in! *throws book into a corner*\n\nComing of Age Story\n\nCringe Comedy: Oh, yes.\n\nHey, It's That Guy!: Xenophilius Lovegood used to be a DJ?\n\nHormone-Addled Teenager: Pretty much the entire premise of the film.\n\nJerkass: Eyeball Paul, who uses Kevin and Perry's admiration of him to his own ends.\n\nEyeball Paul: You'll see I've just had a bangin' shit in the bog. Won't flush. You might have to push it down."
