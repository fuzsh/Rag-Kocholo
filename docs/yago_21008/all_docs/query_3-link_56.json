These friends can help each other land roles, defend against the gossip magazines, or even fluff each other's dresses on the red carpet.\n\nYou surely know about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's lasting friendship and you might be well aware that \"Friends\" costars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox are best buds in real life, but there are quite a few friendships that you likely never knew about.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nHere are celebrity duos you likely didn't know were friends.\n\nAmy Daire, Anjelica Oswald, and Kim Renfro contributed to previous versions of this article.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorde and Cazzie David\n\nLorde, 27, and David, 30, have been best friends for several years after meeting online. In a 2020 feature for Interview Magazine, the two said they talk \"every day.\"\n\n\"Now I feel like I'm a part of your family,\" Lorde said to David. \"We spend our summers together.\"\n\nDavid, who is the daughter of TV legend Larry David, has shared many Instagram posts of her hangouts with Lorde (who herself is off social media these days). David also hangs out with Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, and other pop singers in her Hollywood social circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatthew McConaughey and Guy Fieri\n\nMcConaughey gave a speech when celebrity chef Guy Fieri was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Oscar-winning actor said he first saw Fieri's Food Network TV show, \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" almost two decades ago and was instantly obsessed.\n\nHe later contacted Fieri for a restaurant recommendation, and the rest was history. Now the two men are the best of friends, and share their love of living life \"authentically.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Corden and Dominic Cooper\n\n\"Mamma Mia!\" star Dominic Cooper has been besties with James Corden since 2004. The pair lived together for a spell, and Cooper was the person who introduced Corden to his wife Julia Carey.\n\nThey even tested their friendship on Corden's \"Late Late Show\" with a physical shock quiz game, during which Cooper revealed he knew Corden's birthday and Corden knew the name of each of Cooper's brothers (among other friend trivia).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaty Perry and Allison Williams\n\nNot only do they attend award shows together, but singer Katy Perry and \"Girls\" actor Allison Williams say they're close enough to have best-friend telepathy.\n\nThe friends even accidentally went blonde on the same day in 2017.\n\n\"I was texting her, and I was like, 'I'm going to be blonde next time I see you,'\" Williams told People. \"And she was like, 'Me too!' It was hilarious.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence\n\nActresses Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence have been longtime friends ever since their shared co-star Woody Harrelson introduced them.\n\n\"We both really do love each other and care about each other as people, beyond being actors,\" Stone told Vanity Fair in 2016. \"I support her completely when it comes to work and I feel the same from her, but I know we'd be friends even if we didn't do the same job.\"\n\nThey've since interviewed each other for W Magazine and again in August 2018, when Stone requested Lawrence be the one to do her cover interview with Elle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack McBrayer and Alexander Skarsgård\n\nThe two actors have been close friends for some time and often appear at award shows side-by-side. McBrayer attended the 2018 SAG Awards and after-parties with Skarsgård.\n\nMcBrayer and Skarsgård even made a \"Funny or Die\" video about being best friends heading out on an Antarctic adventure together.\n\n\"We were incredibly close until we spent nine days together on a boat in bunk beds,\" Skarsgård joked during an Esquire interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston\n\nThe two stars met in 2014 through their mutual management company and instantly bonded when Aniston invited Gomez over to her house.\n\n\"We've known each other for years,\" Aniston said to Gomez while guest-hosting \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in January. \"You've been to my house. We've had pizza. Girl after my own heart, do we love a pizza or what? We love a pizza.\"\n\n\"Yes, we do,\" Gomez said.\n\nGomez also said Aniston gives her \"maternal advice\" and the two have shared a few loving Instagram posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd\n\nAniston and Rudd first met when they co-starred in the 1998 movie \"The Object of My Affection.\" They remained close friends, working together again when Rudd joined the \"Friends\" cast as the side character Mike Hannigan in 2002.\n\nThe old pals played an on-screen couple once again in the 2012 movie \"Wanderlust\" (which also starred Aniston's now-ex-husband Justin Theroux).\n\n\"I love him. He is a dear friend,\" Aniston told The Hollywood Reporter while talking about working with Rudd again. \"We just have a true affection for each other and I just feel honored any time I get to work with him.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitbull and John Travolta\n\nMusician Pitbull and actor John Travolta are friends who, like many, exchange texts and jokes. Pitbull (whose real name is Armando Perez) would send the \"Grease\" star edited photos showing what he'd look like bald.\n\nEventually Travolta took the inspiration and decided to embrace the no-hair look, just as Pitbull did years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChelsea Handler and Jennifer Aniston\n\nAniston and Handler go way back. Handler says their friendship \"just happened\" and since then, she's made headlines for defending her bestie. She's called Angelina Jolie a \"lunatic\" and made sure that everyone knew Aniston didn't care one bit about their divorce.\n\nHowever, Handler has jokingly mentioned that being best friends with someone so famous isn't as fun as one might think.\n\n\"Everywhere I go, people ask me about Jennifer Aniston's wedding,\" Handler said to HuffPost Live before Aniston's split with Justin Theroux. \"I always say to her, I'm like, 'Being friends with you is a burden.' You think it's hard to be friends with me? Do you know what it's like to walk down a red carpet and go, 'When are Jen and Justin getting married?' Like I'm in charge of that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJimmy Kimmel and Justin Theroux\n\nKimmel hosted Theroux's bachelor party and officiated his 2015 wedding to Jennifer Aniston. Theroux even said Kimmel cried during the lovebirds' nuptials.\n\n\"That was the biggest blessing in the world,\" Theroux said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" about Kimmel presiding over their wedding. \"It was exactly what you would want him to do. He was extremely funny, kept things extremely light, was extremely touching. Cried a little bit, he did. We both [did] … everyone did.\"\n\nThough Theroux and Aniston have since split up, the two men remain friends and celebrated Thanksgiving together in 2019 (Aniston was there, too).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire\n\nThis interesting friendship kicked off in 1990 when the two auditioned for the same role in a TV show. They reportedly agreed to help each other in the industry whenever possible, and their bond hasn't broken yet.\n\nFlash forward to 2013 and the two finally star together in Baz Luhrmann's \"The Great Gatsby.\" Between those pivotal moments, paps have spotted the pair rooting on teams at basketball games, snorkeling with each other on vacations, and sitting together at parties.\n\nTheir years-long friendship has withstood the test of time, and in Hollywood, that's even more impressive.\n\n\"Every single choice I've made, I've talked to Tobey about and vice versa,\" DiCaprio said to The Associated Press during an interview. \"We've had endless conversations about certain projects and argued with one another and supported one another along the way.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelena Gomez and Cara Delevingne\n\nDelevingne has a girl gang made up of what seems like every model and pop singer in Hollywood. She's known to hang out with a variety of celebrities, but one of her closer friends is the retired Disney Channel star.\n\nThey attend events together and got so cozy that rumors even started to spread that they were more than just friends.\n\n\"She's incredible and very open and she just makes me open. She's so fun and she's just extremely adventurous, and sometimes I just want that in my life, so I didn't mind it,\" Gomez said of the rumors while talking to to PrideSource. \"I loved it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, and Princess Beatrice and Dave Clark\n\nThese two couples apparently hit it off when Kutcher landed Virgin Galactic's spot for the 500th space traveler and met Clark, who is the head of astronaut relations. Since then they've all been spotted together across the globe, chatting it up in Mexico, double dating in London, yachting in St. Tropez, and sharing Ubers in New York City.\n\nThey haven't spoken about their friendship, but they reportedly get along well thanks to Kunis' obsession with the royal family.\n\n\"It isn't just a superficial friendship, they get on really well, as Dave introduced Bea to Ashton and Ashton introduced Mila to them,\" a source told Heat Magazine, according to the Daily Mail. \"Mila is impressed with the royal family, respects their tradition, and watched every minute of Kate and Wills' wedding, so being friends with Beatrice is a total head trip.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSienna Miller and Keira Knightley\n\nMiller and Knightley have long been spotted on the red carpet together. The British superstars met in 2008 when they worked on \"The Edge of Love\" together. Knightley was struggling with a breakup when Miller suggested that they get drunk and make total fools out of themselves to get through it. Her advice worked, and they've been close ever since.\n\nMiller praises Knightley for everything she does, from her parenting to her looks.\n\n\"The most beautiful woman I've ever seen? Keira Knightley,\" Miller said to Vogue. \"She has simply stunning genes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulianne Hough and Nina Dobrev\n\nHough and Dobrev were introduced by their mutual hairstylist, who thought the two girls \"had to meet,\" and the rest is history. They've paired up at Taylor Swift concerts and Lakers games, hit the red carpet with one another, and have even gone on vacation (and mooned everyone!).\n\nThe two went through breakups around the same time they became friends, but Dobrev says the foundation of their friendship is much deeper than that.\n\n\"That's not what our friendship is about. Unfortunately, that's how it's perceived, but there's more to us. People aren't defined by their relationships. The whole point is being true to yourself and not losing yourself in relationships, whether romances or friendships,\" she said during an interview with Cosmopolitan. \"It's been cool to find an active buddy – there are lots of girlie girls around. We don't talk about makeup; we talk about life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBette Midler and 50 Cent\n\nThis unlikely pair met through the New York Restoration Project and became fast friends. They've helped make New York a better place by updating and cleaning community gardens, parks, and other public spaces.\n\n\"He's one of the newest members of our tribe,\" she said during a speech at one of the organization's events. \"He's really made my life worth living. [50] has been with me through thick and thin.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEva Longoria and Victoria Beckham\n\nLongoria and Beckham have been friends ever since the Beckham family hopped the pond to live in America. They are the definition of besties and apparently have the secrets to prove it — not that they'd ever tell.\n\nBeckham and Longoria are so close that the former Spice Girl even designed Longoria's wedding gown, something she wouldn't do for just anyone. Longoria is also godmother to Beckham's daughter, Harper.\n\n\"She's really funny; she makes me laugh,\" Longoria said of Beckham when she appeared on the show \"Loose Women\" in the fall of 2016. \"She's very loyal, a very loyal friend. She's an amazing businesswoman, a great business mind. She's super smart.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Beckham and Snoop Dogg\n\nLike his wife, David also has a friend you probably didn't know about. Snoop and David met when the Beckham family moved to California from England. Since then, they've supported each other through it all. David even made an appearance on Snoop's TV show and Snoop has inspired some of David's new ventures.\n\n\"Whenever I make a record, I give him a copy before it's done. He's like a brother. I'm gonna show him to rap, for shizzle,\" he said to the UK \"Mirror.\" \"He's my boy. I love soccer just as he loves hip-hop. Beckham needs to keep doing what he's doing — he's a great father.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlake Lively and Taylor Swift\n\nWith Swift's squad of besties, it's easy for some to get lost in the crowd. Lively and Swift are actually really good friends. The two have spent days at theme parks together and have shared their love for one another on social media.\n\nWhen fans and gossip magazines thought Lively was \"throwing shade\" at Swift in 2015, Lively was quick to profess her love and dispel the rumors.\n\n\"Umm whoever thought I was throwing shade clearly doesn't know I have a 'Taylor Swift Please Be My Wife VooDoo Doll' #obsessed. Look how rad she is here making my niece Heather feel like a rock star. Love my Canadian family almost as much as I love Taylor Lively. I mean Swift. Ok, FIIINE we can hyphenate our last names. Xo Blake Swift-Lively 4eva,\" the actor wrote on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourteney Cox and Ed Sheeran\n\nCox and Sheeran's friendship is certainly one of the weirder ones in Hollywood. Sheeran got close to the \"Friends\" star when he stayed in her Malibu house while recording his hit album \"X.\"\n\nThe singer even introduced Cox to her then-fiancé Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol. Rumor had it Sheeran was going to be ordained to perform the marriage and performing for them before they decided to hold off on the wedding.\n\n\"We are certainly grateful to Ed for introducing us,\" Cox said to The Sun in August 2015. \"I can't imagine him not playing something at the wedding.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdele and Jennifer Lawrence\n\nLawrence and Adele met back in 2013 at the Oscars, where Lawrence snuck backstage to watch the singer perform \"Skyfall.\" They've remained close ever since and have even spent Thanksgiving together.\n\nWhen Lawrence was asked to pen an essay about Adele when the singer was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, the world realized just how close they are.\n\n\"What you don't see is what a wonderful mother she is. What a wonderful partner and friend she is,\" she wrote. \"That she makes her son's Halloween costumes. Adele is a gift, an international treasure, but she's also sweet, funny, intelligent and beautiful.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley Cyrus and Kelly Osbourne\n\nThe daughters of music industry giants got close on the set of their movie \"So Undercover,\" which went straight to DVD in 2012. Osbourne doesn't agree with everything the singer does, like sticking her tongue out or smoking out of bongs, but she's proud of her no matter what.\n\n\"I'm proud of her because whether you agree with what she does or not, she stands by her guns and she's not fake,\" the former \"Fashion Police\" co-host said to HuffPost Live.\n\nBetty White and Jennifer Love Hewitt\n\nDuring an appearance on \"The Late Late Show With James Corden,\" Jennifer Love Hewitt described her friendship with Betty White.

Nobody knows that.\"\n\nThe latest indication of how close they are came in the liner notes for Swift's new album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" \"Emily Jean Stone\" is credited with providing \"oddities\" to the track \"Florida!!!\"\n\nThat's Emma Stone's real name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Sandler and Timothée Chalamet\n\nSome friendships are forged through sports, and that's the case with Adam Sandler and Timothée Chalamet.\n\nFor years, when the two are in NYC they always try to meet up and play some pickup basketball.\n\nTheir latest run back in 2023 was captured by photographers.\n\nImagine finding yourself in a game playing against Happy Gilmore and Paul from \"Dune\"?\n\nCourteney Cox and Laura Dern\n\nCourteney Cox and Laura Dern have been appearing at each other's side on red carpets for years.
