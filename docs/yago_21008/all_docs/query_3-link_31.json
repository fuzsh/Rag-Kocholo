        "text": ",\n\nJoe Biden’s out. Kamala Harris is in, and Donald Trump has parted ways from his message of unity after being targeted in an assassination attempt last month. As this election session continues to heat up, Kevin Hart “simply” wants people to exercise their right to vote.\n\nThe comedian and actor, 45, stars in the new summer blockbuster, “Borderlands” alongside Jamie Lee Curtis and Cate Blanchett, where they find themselves united for the same cause to save a missing girl, played by Ariana Greenblatt. Like the film, Hart is also aware of the impact that lies within “doing your part” and how holding truth to power can result in actionable change.\n\n“It's our job to make sure that we apply ourselves in the best way that we possibly can,” the star told Bet.com. “I think it's important for people to utilize their power and voice.”\n\nRELATED: Beverly Hills Cop Turns 35: 5 Buddy Cop Action Films with Black Leads to Watch with Your Bestie\n\nIn the one-hour and forty-minute high-octane adventure, Hart plays Roland, a former soldier influenced by morality who boots up for an assignment that will challenge his pride and dexterity. Throughout many twists, turns, and near-death experiences, Roland and his team prove their unique abilities are the “it” factor that will lead them to victory.\n\nBet.com caught up with the star to discuss the sci-fi dramedy and how the action flick parallels this year’s election session.\n\nBet.com: Your character, Roland, develops a special bond with pre-teen Tina, played by Ariana Greenblatt, who everyone is trying to save. We know you’re a dad to sons and daughters in real life. How did your fatherhood journey help you envelop those parts of the script?\n\nKevin Hart: The relationship and bond between Tina and Roland are significant, and they build as the story goes on. He feels that he has not only a job to do but also the morally right thing to do. I can go down the list of just how special this girl is and why we can't turn our backs on her or why we need to make sure that we service the approaching task at hand.\n\nMy relationship with my kids is everything. My kids being in danger, Lord knows what I would do to try my best to prevent or correct whatever it is, simply because of them being my children.\n\nBet.com: After overcoming defeat, the crew regroups for a celebration. You recently celebrated your 45th and this year also marks the 20th anniversary of Soul Plane. Over the past 45 years, what has been your best achievement?\n\nKevin Hart: Getting one kid to college is a big deal. My niece is the first in the family to do said thing. My niece started a through line that we want to follow and stay true to. So my oldest daughter, Heaven [Hart] to graduate high school, [be] top of her class, and now be operating at the top of our class in college, that's a big deal for any father, to see their kids grow up.\n\nI think I have many more of these accomplishments, because I have a total of four kids, but right now, that's the big one. My first one is grown, [is] an amazing person with a great heart. Those are the big wins. Those are the big accomplishments.\n\nBet.com: In the film, Atlas, the arch nemesis, demonstrates what power looks like in the wrong hands. We are in an unprecedented election season. How important is it for people to vote not just for the POTUS, but vote up and down the ballot this season?\n\nKevin Hart: So many people speak on problems, but not a lot of people want to be a part of the solve. Every vote counts, regardless of what side you're on. It's not about voicing it. It's just about doing it. There's a lot of laws out there. Some can impact you, some may impact others that you know and love. The change you're looking for may be in just that understanding."
