        "text": "During a recent visit to Ochre House Theater, Matthew Posey and Kevin Grammer were outside building a cage for a trio of hares. They’ll be portrayed by puppets in the company’s latest production, Carla Parker’s Daddy’s Rabbits: A Cotton Tale.\n\nAlong with Justin Locklear, who designed the puppets, Posey, Grammer and Parker make up the core of Ochre House, which has been presenting its own brand of surreal, often over-the-top material since Posey launched the group in 2008.\n\n“What we do, probably any theater could potentially do, but nobody does,” Parker says. “That’s very intriguing to me. I’ve always been a writer even when nobody saw it. I’m a storyteller. If somebody leaves blanks in a story, I will fill them in with my own idea. I can’t stand a half-told story.”\n\nIn addition to writing Daddy’s Rabbits, Parker directs the premiere at the 40-seat storefront theater in Exposition Park. The cast includes Grammer, Meagan Harris, Omar Padilla, Marti Etheridge, Ben Bryant and Lauren Massey, all regulars in Ochre House productions. Locklear, who composed the show’s music, plays keyboards alongside Trey Pendergrass on percussion and Lyle Hathaway on guitar. The musicians voice the puppets.\n\n“One advantage is you learn how to communicate with each other,” Parker says of the tight-knit group. “They’re familiar with the expectations, the way we do things here. Since we don’t produce anything we haven’t written ourselves, sometimes the script gets tweaked all the way up to the opening. It helps to have familiarity with our process, which happens fast.”\n\nParker’s new play, her seventh since joining Ochre House in 2011, takes place in a boardinghouse where the owners, renters and jackrabbits live happily together until a stranger intrudes.\n\n“I wanted to find a group of people and explore their relationships. I guess that’s pretty much the basis for all my stuff, on the surface,” she says. “This one looks into their cycles and the rituals they go through to find themselves.”\n\nParker typically fills up journals with her research, organizing ideas with tabs and color coding. This time, she used note cards, which are easier to shuffle through. She learned a lot about different kinds of rabbits. She chose jackrabbits, a type of hare, because they’re precocial, born with their eyes open, all of their fur and the ability to leave the nest and fend for themselves. They’re no cuddly bunnies.\n\nIn Daddy’s Rabbits, Parker says, they’re more self-aware and less honest than the people. “They’re just beasts. Bunnies have to be protected by their mothers. They’re defenseless. Hares are good to go.”\n\nA native of Lubbock, Parker has been acting since she was 6. She would’ve started in kindergarten but the local children’s theater required performers to be at least in the first grade. She became interested when she saw a schoolmate tap dancing in Gypsy. “I thought, ‘Kids can do that?’ ”\n\nBy that time, she’d already started performing informally. “This is so dumb,” she confesses. “I used to walk into a room at family gatherings, do a little number and then go around saying, ‘10 cents please.’ I was probably 5.”\n\nBy third grade, she’d appeared on a children’s TV show, and she continued acting and playing the viola through high school. After attending Texas Tech, Parker completed her undergraduate degree at Excelsior University, became a theater teacher and earned a master’s from Central Washington University.\n\n“Like our mission says, we use minimal resources to their maximum possibilities,” Parker says of Ochre House. “This is all created in the heads and the bodies of the people in this room in that moment in time. And most likely, it will never happen again.”\n\nDetails"
