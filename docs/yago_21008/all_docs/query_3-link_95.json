        "text": "Television's biggest drama is also the television industry's biggest drama. Paramount Network's hit Western Yellowstone should be on an easy ride into a record-ratings sunset, but instead it's more of a bucking bronco that can't be tamed. Season 5, which has been on hiatus since January 2023, will be the show's final season, and while we always knew the end would be near, we weren't expecting it this soon, and Paramount Network probably wasn't either. Star Kevin Costner will not return for the final episodes of the series as the actor moves on to a new passion project of his own — a series of Western films — which became the impetus for the series ending. But there is some good news from the ranch: Yellowstone Season 5 is back on the horse and has resumed production, and a release date for the final episodes has been announced.\n\nThere's a lot of unfinished business to take care of before the flagship series signs off. Civil war has broken out among the Duttons, with Jamie (Wes Bentley) and Beth (Kelly Reilly) at each other's throats, John (Costner) at risk of being impeached, and a devastating illness spreading through Montana wildlife and endangering the Duttons' cattle.\n\nBelow, we'll go through what we know about the second half of the final season, including the release date, cast information, and recaps of the first part of the season to set you up for what's to come.\n\nALSO READ: Yellowstone stars discuss life with John as the governor\n\nYellowstone Season 5 Part 2 latest news\n\nOK, it's not technically news about Season 5 Part 2, but it is news about Yellowstone. In early August, MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios, the studios behind Yellowstone, announced that the contemporary Yellowstone sequel series previously known as 2024 will now be called The Madison, and it will star Michelle Pfeiffer. For more on this and other spin-offs, head to the spin-off section below.\n\nYellowstone Season 5 Part 2 release date\n\nThis certainly qualifies as a YEEHAW: Our favorite Western has a return date. Yellowstone Season 5 Part 2 will premiere on Sunday, Nov. 10 at 8/7c. The last time we saw a new Yellowstone episode? Jan. 1, 2023. Paramount Network also revealed that internationally, Yellowstone Season 5 Part 2 will debut in Canada on Paramount+ on Nov. 10, in the U.K. on Nov. 11, and in Latin America, Brazil, and France at a later date.\n\nYellowstone Season 5 production\n\nYellowstone is finally back in business, after more than 17 months off the air. On May 21, Deadline reported that Yellowstone had resumed production on Season 5 Part 2 in Montana. Let's hope everyone remembers how to ride a horse.\n\nYellowstone is ending with Season 5\n\nYellowstone will end with Season 5, Paramount has announced. At the time of the announcement in early May 2023, the show's final episodes were scheduled to premiere in November 2023, while a currently untitled sequel series was confirmed to be in the works and set to debut in December. However, the writers strike and the actors strike delayed both projects, and Season 5 will now return on Nov. 10, 2024.\n\nThe news that the show will be ending came after months of speculation surrounding the question of whether Kevin Costner would return for the remainder of Season 5 (and a report that claimed Costner would leave the show after Season 5, before the final season news was announced). Costner has since confirmed that he won't be involved in the final episodes.\n\nIn an eye-opening interview with The Hollywood Reporter in June 2023, Sheridan insisted that his intended ending was still in play even if Costner did not return to the series. \"I'm disappointed,\" Sheridan said in the Hollywood Reporter interview. \"It truncates the closure of his character. It doesn't alter it, but it truncates it.\"\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean the final season will be truncated, though. Yellowstone Season 5 Part 2 was expected to be just six episodes, and actor Ian Bohen indicated in March of 2024 that six episodes are still the expectation. However, in June 2023, Sheridan told The Hollywood Reporter, \"If I think it takes 10 episodes to wrap it up, [Paramount Network will] give me 10. It'll be as long as it needs to be.\"\n\nParamount has also announced a contemporary Yellowstone spin-off series, now titled The Madison.\n\nWill Kevin Costner return to Yellowstone?\n\nKevin Costner has confirmed that his days in John Dutton's cowboy hat are over. On June 20, Costner posted a video on social media announcing that he will not return to Yellowstone for its final episodes.\n\n\"Hi everyone,\" Costner said in the video. \"I just want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things that's required, and thinking about Yellowstone, that beloved series that I love, that I know you love, I just realized that I'm not going to be able to continue Season 5B or into the future.\"\n\nThe actor continued, \"It was something that really changed me. I loved it. And I know you loved it. And I just wanted to let you know that I won't be returning, and I love the relationship we've been able to develop, and I'll see you at the movies.\"\n\nIn an interview with GQ in May, Costner claimed that the reason he left Yellowstone was that delays in production interfered with his schedule and some filming contracts he had surrounding his Horizon Western films.\n\nCostner essentially said he had tried to come up with an amicable solution, offering up his time to finish out his arc before he was committed to shoot Horizon: An American Saga. He said he was even willing to come in to film John Dutton's death scene, if it needed to come to that. According to Costner, \"I said, 'Well, if you want to kill me, if you want to do something like that,' I said, 'I have a week before I start [shooting Horizon], I'll do what you want to do.'\" But Paramount and Sheridan didn't take him up on his offer.\n\nCostner also bemoaned how he was portrayed in the media, with some outlets saying he was only willing to give the show a week of his time, when he feels it was the delays in production and scripts that left him feeling stuck while his passion project waited in the wings, so he moved forward on Horizon.\n\n\"What am I supposed to do? I'm just not a dog that waits in a driveway not knowing when the person's going to come home,\" he said. \"I want to know. And I also understood that their universe was really big, so I just decided not to sit in the driveway, but to be busy myself and be available when I could. It didn't end up happening.\"\n\nCostner had previously indicated that he would be open to returning to the series under the right circumstances. On April 9, Costner was interviewed by Entertainment Tonight at CinemaCon, where he was promoting Horizon. \"I'd like to be able to [return to Yellowstone] but we haven't been able to,\" he said. \"I've loved making that series. I made five seasons of it, I thought I was going to make seven [seasons]. So how it works out — I hope it does — but they've got a lot of different shows going on. Maybe it will. Maybe this will circle back to me. If it does and I feel really comfortable with [it], I'd love to do it.\"\n\nYellowstone on CBS\n\nWhile Yellowstone is on hiatus, it's still finding new fans. The Paramount Network series made its broadcast debut Sept. 17, 2023, on CBS, where it aired Sundays, starting from the beginning of Season 1. Season 2 began airing on Sunday, Oct. 29.\n\nOn Dec. 4, CBS announced it would continue to air Yellowstone in 2024, even though the writers and actors strikes had ended. Season 3 began its run on CBS with three episodes on Jan. 14 and concluded with a two-night finale event on Sunday, Jan. 28 and Monday, Jan. 29. Because CBS returned to regular programming after the Super Bowl on Feb. 11, it's unclear whether, or when, the network will air Season 4 of Yellowstone. CBS will be airing another Sheridan series, Tulsa King, in the summer, and hasn't announced plans to air Season 4 of Yellowstone in the summer or fall.\n\nIn its first week on CBS, Yellowstone drew 6.6 million viewers, much more than the 2.8 million who tuned into the series premiere when it debuted on Paramount Network back in 2018. (As the audience grew, episodes on Paramount Network peaked at almost 10 million viewers.)\n\nYellowstone Season 5 Part 2 teaser\n\nParamount did release a teaser for the back half of the season, but it contained no new footage, since the new episodes hadn't been filmed yet. Piper Perabo told TV Guide in mid-December 2022 that she had no idea what was coming after Episode 8.\n\nYellowstone Season 5 recaps\n\nNeed to catch up on the recent episodes?

His intentions are clear in the two-part premiere of Season 5. The ranch hands have not changed their ways, despite John's new gig, which makes for some of the best scenes in the premiere episodes.\n\nRead TV Guide's full review of the two-part premiere: Yellowstone Season 5 premiere review: John Dutton may be governor, but the ranch remains the same\n\nYellowstone Season 5 cast\n\nKevin Costner will not appear in the final episodes, but Season 5 has already brought a mix of familiar and new faces to the ranch. Josh Lucas returned as young John Dutton for the first time since Season 3. He was joined by Kylie Rogers as young Beth and Kyle Red Silverstein as young Rip. Jacki Weaver also returned as the Duttons' latest business foe, Market Equities CEO Caroline Warner, with Mo Brings Plenty and Wendy Moniz promoted to series regulars as Thomas Rainwater's (Gil Birmingham) right-hand man Mo and governor-turned-senator Lynelle Perry, respectively.\n\nFour new characters have arrived on Yellowstone as well. Kai Caster plays a young cowboy named Rowdy. Lainey Wilson plays a musician, Abby. Lilli Kai plays Clara Brewer, Gov. Dutton's new assistant. And 1883's Dawn Olivieri joined the cast as Sarah Atwood, a Montana newcomer and \"corporate shark\" who has attached herself to Jamie.\n\nThe whole bunkhouse is also back, including Forrie J. Smith, Denim Richards, Ian Bohen, Ryan Bingham, and Jen Landon as Teeter, who has been promoted to series regular.\n\nBefore the season premiered, it was announced that Kathryn Kelly, who plays Jimmy's fiancée, Emily, had also been promoted to series regular and returned to the show alongside Jefferson White as Jimmy. So far, they've only appeared in the midseason finale and are happily living and working at the Four Sixes Ranch in Texas.\n\nThe back half of the season is also likely to feature more Orli Gottesman as Halie, a young, confident girl drawn to Carter. So far, we've only seen her at the county fair and briefly in the midseason finale. \"In Season 5, Halie becomes that person who gives Carter the chance to come out of his shell and to teach him not only about himself, but he finds himself always wanting Halie to be around,\" reads her character description. \"Halie comes along and now there is someone who can fit that mold and be there for him.\"\n\nALSO READ: The Yellowstone universe explained: Every show, how to watch, Dutton family tree, and more\n\nMain cast members\n\nKevin Costner as John Dutton (not returning for Season 5 Part 2)\n\nKelly Reilly as Beth\n\nLuke Grimes as Kayce\n\nWes Bentley as Jamie\n\nCole Hauser as Rip\n\nKelsey Asbille as Monica\n\nBrecken Merrill as Tate\n\nFinn Little as Carter\n\nGil Birmingham as Thomas Rainwater\n\nYellowstone Season 4 recap\n\nYellowstone Season 5 picked up after the bloody events of the Season 4 finale; Beth (Kelly Reilly), who we all know is the real brains behind every operation on the Yellowstone-Dutton Ranch, manipulated her adopted brother Jamie (Wes Bentley) into killing his biological father, Garrett (Will Patton). After it was revealed that Garrett was the one who ordered the attempted hits on John, Beth, and Kayce (Luke Grimes) back in Season 3, Beth figured he had it coming. She also made sure to hang onto the evidence, so now she's got Jamie under her thumb and out of the governor's race, clearing the way for their father to be the only Dutton running for office. She also just got hitched to Rip Wheeler (Cole Hauser) and watched her father's new, confusing vegan special friend (Piper Perabo) head off to jail, so basically, it's Beth's world and everyone else is just living in it.\n\nComplicating Beth's quest for world/Montana domination is the fact that Kayce has been on a heck of a spiritual journey that showed him a vision of two paths. At least one of those paths, as he told Monica (Kelsey Asbille), would result in \"the end of us.\" Whatever that means, it can't be good.\n\nYellowstone prequels and spin-offs\n\nIn November 2023, Paramount officially greenlit two more spin-off series: 1944 and a contemporary spin-off then called 2024. In August 2024, Paramount announced that 2024 was retitled The Madison, and it will star Michelle Pfeiffer, who will also executive produce. In a release, the series was described as \"a heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.\" Paramount also did not mention whether The Madison would air on Paramount Network or Paramount+.\n\nThe news on The Madison was first broken by TVLine, which also reported that the contemporary spin-off may also star Kurt Russell and Patrick J. Adams, and follow \"wealthy matriarch Stacy Clyburn and her family as they leave New York City and head to Montana in the wake of her husband and brother-in-law's tragic deaths in a plane crash.\" Production is reported to start soon, with 2025 eyed for the premiere.\n\nPreviously, Variety reported that, according to sources, the contemporary spin-off will feature new characters as well as some crossover characters from the flagship show. Matthew McConaughey was reportedly in talks to star in a Yellowstone spin-off, though it is unclear if he is still involved in any Yellowstone spin-off, or if Russell's potential character was the one meant for McConaughey.\n\nAccording to a report in early February by the Hollywood insider newsletter Puck, Yellowstone stars Kelly Reilly (who plays Beth Dutton), Cole Hauser (Rip Wheeler), and Luke Grimes (Kayce Dutton) are in some tough negotiations to star in an in-development follow-up series as well (though it is unknown whether this is The Madison or another contemporary Yellowstone series). We knew that some Yellowstone stars were being considered to be part of a new series' cast. But whether they ride on to the new series depends on whether Paramount is ready to match the stars' alleged salary demands. Puck reported that Reilly and Hauser are asking in the $1.2 million per episode range (Reilly initially wanted $1.5 million, but came down), a considerable raise over their Yellowstone salaries, while Grimes is lower on the scale. Paramount has a big decision to make. As for McConaughey, Puck reported that he was not a definite lock for the role and was, at the time, still waiting for a script.\n\nA prequel limited series, 1883, aired on Paramount+ late in 2021 and revealed the origin story of the Dutton family arriving in Montana. The series starred Isabel May as the brave and adventurous teenager Elsa, elder sister to John Dutton's great-grandfather, John Sr., and Tim McGraw as her father, James.\n\nA second Yellowstone prequel, titled 1923, premiered in December 2022. It picks up 40 years after 1883 with the next generation of Duttons tending to their ranch during the aftermath of World War I and the start of Prohibition. The series, which is slated to return for Season 2, stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as Jacob and Cara Dutton, the brother and sister-in-law to Tim McGraw's James Dutton from 1883. The premiere of 1923 also revealed some hidden secrets about the Dutton family tree.\n\nSheridan is also writing a Yellowstone spin-off called 6666, which takes place at the real historic Four Sixes Ranch in Texas (which Sheridan owns) and tells the story of how the ranch has continued to operate in the same way today as it did over a century ago. That spin-off will air on Paramount Network, along with the original show, though it's currently on hold as Sheridan assesses its heritage — as owner, from a front-row seat — to honor its history.\n\nThe Sheridan-produced limited series Lawmen: Bass Reeves, starring David Oyelowo as Bass Reeves, was originally expected to exist within the Yellowstone universe as a prequel to 1883 but was changed to function as its own standalone series.\n\nAdditionally, Sheridan has previously said he had several more Yellowstone prequels in the works. \"[The prequels are] time capsules of life in Montana as a microcosm of the world as a whole,\" Sheridan told The Hollywood Reporter in June 2023. \"They're big spectacles, and the more that you move into the modern era, the bigger that spectacle becomes. I know these are huge bets Paramount makes on me every time. I'm asking them to give me Game of Thrones Season 6 money for what is essentially a pilot every year, and that's a big ask. As long as I do my job well, and people don't bore of the genre, I think there will be enough for many more [prequels] — three or four.\"\n\n30 fun facts about Yellowstone\n\nIf you think you're a fan of Yellowstone but want to become a super fan, then check out TV Guide's compilation of 30 (and counting) fun facts and behind-the-scenes secrets about the show, including how you can visit the real Dutton ranch and what it takes to be a cowboy on a Taylor Sheridan show.\n\nHow to watch Yellowstone\n\nYellowstone Seasons 1-4 and the first half of Season 5 are streaming on Peacock. New episodes of Season 5 will air on the Paramount Network."
