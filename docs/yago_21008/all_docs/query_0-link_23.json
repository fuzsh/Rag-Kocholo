        "text": "A movie spin-off from Harry Enfield's TV series, featuring the popular character of Kevin the Teenager. When stubborn, spotty Kevin and his equally hopeless best friend Perry go on holiday to the party island Ibiza, they see it as their big chance to become superstar club DJs and, more importantly, to lose their virginities. But they aren't prepared for the interference of top DJ Eyeball Paul, not to mention the embarrassment factor of Kevin's long-suffering parents.\n\nThis movie is fantastic. Love this film, it's great and very funny. Great cast as well.\n\nAnyone else like this film?\n\nI saw this at the theater when I was working in Surrey. I had only seen the TV show that spawned it once or twice, but anyone who doesn't like Kathy Burke is crackers. Her comedy is amazing. And I used to have a crush on Harry Enfield.\n\nAnyway, after the movie is a GREAT selection of Kevin and Perry clips from the TV show, and that alone is worth purchasing the DVD for!"
