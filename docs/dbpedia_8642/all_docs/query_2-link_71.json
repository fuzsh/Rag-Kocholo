        "text": "Every Friday I pull a jersey out of my collection, and tell the first story it makes me think of like a hockey Rorschach test. This week I’ll take a look at the uniform worn by Vladislav Tretiak during the 1972 Summit Series.\n\nLet’s take things in a different direction this week shall we? Instead of telling a story from the past, let’s look at what could have happened with a single roster move.\n\nI recently read Ken Dryden‘s 1973 book Face-off at the Summit which was a recounting of the lead up to and the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the USSR. This series was the first of its kind in a true best-on-best match-up, and would radically change the face of global hockey forever.\n\nAs I read it, I couldn’t stop thinking about one potential scenario that could have completely altered the two decades of hockey.\n\nNow before I go any further, what if scenarios tend to be awkward thought experiments. Once you tug on one thread of the tapestry of history it creates a cascading domino effect that sooner or later everything devolves into fantasy. With this “what if” scenario, I am only going to focus on a few threads to try and keep some form of “next case scenario” logic.\n\nThe question that plagued me all through this book, was what would have happened if Vladislav Tretiak joined the Montreal Canadiens?\n\nThroughout the eighties, it wasn’t out of the ordinary for NHL teams to use late draft picks on Soviet players, on the off chance they could ever get them out from behind the Iron Curtain. It was a pretty shrewd move to make by an NHL general manager. The odds of a seventh-rounder for example turning into anything tangible was a long shot so why not use it on a member of the talented Soviet teams. If the Soviet player you drafted never makes it to North America you’re in the same spot you’d have been had you drafted someone from Sudbury, Ontario. If the Soviet player was able to cross the Atlantic though, suddenly you’ve added one of the top players not playing in the NHL.\n\nIn 1983 the Montreal Canadiens used a seventh-round pick to draft the thirty-year-old Tretiak. It had been four years since Dryden had retired leaving the Habs a platoon of goaltenders to split the net. Between Richard Sevigny, Michel Larocque, Denis Herron and Rick Wamsley no one was able to cement themselves as the de facto number one. If Montreal could reach an agreement to bring Tretiak over they would be set in goal for the rest of the eighties.\n\nIf Tretiak had arrived in time for the 1983-84 season a new history slowly begins to form. That year Montreal was middling at best once again using a platoon of goalies in net, finishing fourth in the Adams Division with 75 points. Thanks to a divisional playoff structure similar to today, the Habs made the playoffs even though they trailed the next closest team in the division by 19 points. Every other team in the Prince of Wales Conference had at least 93 points.\n\nEnter Steve Penney\n\nOn the back of their rookie goaltender’s heroics, the lowly Canadiens went on a run to the final four. There they met the New York Islanders who were in pursuit of their fifth straight Stanley Cup. New York would end the Cinderella run in six games.\n\nWith Tretiak in net though, one has to think the Canadiens are nowhere as bad as they actually were during the 83-84 regular season. Even if they still finish fourth in the Division they couldn’t possibly be 19 points back of third, right? If Tretiak is between the pipes in this scenario there’s a very good chance Montreal makes it back to the Conference Final. Maybe they even knock off the Islanders, but I don’t see it.\n\nMuch like Penney, Tretiak would be crowned the number one goalie. The biggest difference between the two though would be the international pedigree that Treitak held would likely make the Canadiens comfortable leaving the net in his hands for the foreseeable future. All of this leads to the 1984 draft, and the next thread we pull which completely rewrites the NHL landscape.\n\nIf Tretiak is a reliable starter going forward, would the Montreal Canadiens use their third-round pick on Patrick Roy? Or would they use it to shore up other areas of their roster? While I think Montreal still picks Roy as they hunt for the next great French star, let’s have some fun and presume they don’t add a young goaltender to their talent pool.\n\nTo keep this thought experiment relatively simple let’s slot Roy onto the next team who drafted a goaltender. Instead of going 51st overall, Roy drops to the 56th seed which belonged to the St. Louis Blues.\n\nWith Tretiak in net, we have Montreal make the Stanley Cup Final in 1986, but instead of meeting Calgary, it’s St. Patrick and his Blues lining up across the ice.\n\nRoy would have burst onto the scene with a solid St. Louis squad just like he did in Montreal. During the 1986 season, he would serve in a platoon with Rick Wamsley before taking over the net by playoff time. St. Louis cruises through the playoffs, but instead of losing in the Campbell Conference Finals to Calgary, Roy writes the first chapter in his midwestern legend leading the Blues to the Cup Final.\n\nCould you imagine that series? The fiery uber-competitive Roy going up against his childhood team? While Montreal tries to win a Stanley Cup for their Soviet living legend? It would have been unbelievable and a toss-up with both teams equally deserving a title.\n\nComing out of that Cup Final though is where history really begins to diverge.\n\nIn theory, Montreal’s trajectory going forward is relatively the same. They remain a fairly competitive team and a darkhorse to win another Stanley Cup for several years. The biggest difference is when the Habs truly begin to decline. With Tretiak being much older than Roy the inevitable Habs collapse happens earlier. It’s unlikely Montreal gets within spitting distance of the 1993 Stanley Cup with Tretiak now forty and that’s if he even chose to play that long. Instead of limping along in a state of mediocrity into the mid to late nineties like they did with Roy, Montreal would be forced to start a rebuild in the early nineties. If that’s the case would they have made a push to acquire the pick used on the next great French Canadian star Alexandre Daigle? Would Montreal become irrelevant for most of the nineties with Rejean Houle as GM?\n\nThe ramifications of this for St. Louis run far deeper. By returning to the Final in ’86 the Blues aren’t necessarily plagued by the choke artist reputation they developed in the nineties. With Roy in the fold, perhaps the dominating rivalry throughout the nineties becomes St. Louis/Detroit with the Avalanche struggling to get over the hump. If we slide St. Louis into Colorado’s spot does that mean Roy only wins two championships? Or is Roy able to lead St. Louis to the promised land in say 1989, 1993 or 1994? These three years would be the only logical shots because even with Roy the Blues would not get past the eighties Oilers or the nineties Penguins.\n\nI know this is projecting best-case scenarios for Roy in St. Louis but it’s fun to look at just the immediate ripple effects a single personnel move could have. As much as Montreal wanted Tretiak, and Tretiak wanted to try his hand in the NHL they couldn’t broker a deal. Ultimately Montreal’s dreams were a few years too early as the late eighties began to see an influx of Russian players coming to North America to cut their teeth."
