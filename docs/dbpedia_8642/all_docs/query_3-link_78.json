His remarkable achievement, unthinkable at the time, came while he was playing for the Kansas City Blues of the Central Hockey League in a Feb. 21, 1971, game vs. Oklahoma City. While clearing a loose puck with 44 seconds lto go in a 2-1 game, Plasse, who was certainly not attempting to score, flipped it all the way down the ice into the net, which was left open for an extra attacker. Nearly two decades later, this situation would amount to the same scenario under which Ron Hextall became the first NHL goalie to score a goal.\n\nLife Outside the NHL\n\nFull Name: Michel Pierre Plasse\n\nOther Post-Draft Teams: Cleveland (AHL); Jacksonville (EHL); Kansas City (CHL); Nova Scotia (AHL); Hershey (AHL); Hampton, Philadelphia (AHL); Fort Worth (CHL); Binghamton (AHL)\n\nDeath: Plasse died of a heart attack in Ile du Pas, Quebec, at the end of 2006. He was 58 years old.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\nSelected by Quebec Nordiques in 1972 WHA Draft, the first-ever WHA Draft, in February 1972. Left Montreal in 1974 Expansion Draft after Ken Dryden had opted to return from law school. Was one of the first NHL goalies to wear the European birdcage-style mask in mid-1970s. Ranked among NHL leaders in minutes played in both 1975-76 (3,096) and 1976-77 (2,986). Recorded his first NHL shutout in Pittsburgh's 5-0 home win over Minnesota on March 6, 1976. Faced 50 or more shots in four games for Colorado during the 1976-77 season. Made 48 saves in Colorado's 5-2 home victory over N.Y. Rangers on Feb. 1, 1977.
