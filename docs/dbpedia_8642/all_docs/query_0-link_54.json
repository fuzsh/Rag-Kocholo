WORLD Western trio caught in Cambodian politics SOUTHAM NEWS JONATHAN MANTHORPE Sihanouk to chair a peace confer- PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Three Western hostages appear in danger of becoming bargaining chips in Cambodia's political strife in the wake of new demands from the guerrillas believed to be holding them. While it does not mention the hostages directly, a letter from the Khmer Rouge blames the United States, France and Australia for alleged attacks on their bases and seeks $1 million U.S. compensation .\n\nTrain ambushed Australian David Wilson, 29, Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet, 28, and Briton Mark Slater, 28, were among about 100 people taken at gunpoint July 26 when their train was ambushed about 150 kilometres south of the capital in Kampot province. About 14 people including Westerners the three are still being held. Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan has denied any involvement in the kidnapping and, in a letter released Saturday, vowed to investigate the incident. But the government isn't buying the protestations. \"They always speak like that,\" Lieut .\n\n-Gen. Teng Savong of the National Security Ministry told Reuters on the weekend. \"But we know for sure it is the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who kidnapped the The Khmer Rouge boycotted last year's democratic elections but now controls about 10 per cent of the country and wants to be brought into the government. The letter dated Sunday and signed \"Commander Brin,\" deputy to Samphan was given to a Cambodian journalist seeking to interview. Khmer Rouge leaders in the area where the hostages are believed to be held .\n\nWithout giving dates or locations, the letter refers to three helicopter attacks on Khmer Rouge positions in which it says a large number of people were wounded and houses and crops destroyed. It also alleges infantry attacked guerrilla positions in May during a failed attempt by King Norodom PRAYERS ence between the government and the guerrillas. Meanwhile, the Cambodian government and the three countries involved have refused to pay the $50,000 worth of gold for the kidnapped tourists, saying it would encourage attacks on foreigners. But they have left the door open to providing food, medical supplies or development aid, which has been done in the past for hostages taken by the guerrillas. A railway guard captured in the attack and released last week said the kidnappers have threatened to kill the Westerners if no ransom is paid .\n\nGovernment spokesman Ung Tea Seam told reporters yesterday the government has a \"connection\" to the Khmer Rouge, but denied negotiations for the hostages' release are taking place. Ung said the hostages \"will be released in the very near future because the government is going to have them released and get a good image for He also denied any knowledge of Sunday's letter or of the attacks described in it. The government fears the hostage taking, the second this year, will harm the tourist industry and make foreign companies nervous about investing in the country. Local bandits In April, two Australians and a Briton were kidnapped on the road from Phnom Penh to the port of Sihanoukville. Their captors were also reported to be Khmer Rouge, though they might have been local bandits .\n\nThe three are believed to have been killed. There have been few improvements in Cambodia since the royalist party won the United Nationsorganized elections in May 1993. But at the urging of the king, the royalists entered an uneasy alliance with the Communists, who had ruled before the votes. Sihanouk also supports bringing Samphan's guerrillas into government even though five of his sons were among the more than one million Cambodians killed during the Rouge's brutal regime of 1975-79. New Hampshire steamed at plant lobster poaching acquainted with accidental fish entrapment, or in this case, crustacean entrapment, wildlife officials were startled by the magnitude of the catch at the fossil-fuel power plant .\n\nWorkers had essentially created a giant lobster trap from a system meant to keep debris out of the cooling system, Bonenfant said. As the plant pulls water from the Piscataqua River through a 5-footwide pipe, lobsters, fish and debris are sucked against a metal filter at the base of the pipe. Every six hours, the filter is removed and the debris is washed into a channel that flows back into the river. But someone had placed another grate at the base of that channel, catching up to 50 lobsters every six hours, or 200 a day, officials said. The number, said Bruce Smith, a state marine biologist, is \"higher than any of us ever imagined.\" Ian G .\n\nWilson, a spokesman for the plant operator, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, said the company was interviewing employees and working to modify the cooling system so it sucks in fewer lobsters. Bonenfant said it appeared that workers had taken advantage of an outdated system. \"Instead of doing the right thing and putting them in a bucket and taking them back out to the river, it would be just as easy for an employee to pick them up and take them home,\" he said. \"The opportunity was NEW YORK TIMES While utility companies are well BOSTON It started when an anonymous caller gave wildlife officials a tip: an employee at a New Hampshire power plant, the caller said, was illegally sneaking home lobsters that had been sucked into the plant's cooling system. So last week, officials stopped the employee, Joseph Couture, as he was leaving the Schiller Station Plant in Newington .\n\nThey found 28 live lobsters in the trunk of his car. They went to his apartment and found 480 carcasses more than 70 pounds of lobster meat in two freezers. Now, law enforcement officers at the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department say they suspect that employees at the plant in Newington, a small town in the southeast corner of the state, have been smuggling out lobsters for more than six years. Thousands might have been brought out, they say. Bruce Bonenfant, a fish and game officer investigating the smuggling, said the department had found no evidence that employees had tried to sell the lobsters .\n\nBut taking them for personal consumption is still a serious offence, he said. Couture, who has been suspended without pay, has been charged with catching lobsters without a license, possessing an egg-bearing fomale lobster and possessing undersized lobsters. If convicted, he faces up to a year in jail and a fine of $30,480, or $60 per lobster.
