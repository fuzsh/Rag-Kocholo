Valentine's Day flood of 1986 .\n\n'Dr. Mom' has an outspread palm ASSOCIATED PRESS CHICAGO Despite experts' advice, a lot of mothers believe spanking is a good way to discipline young children, a survey found. \"Mothers spank fairly frequently they both believe in it and do it often,\" said Rebecca Socolar, the lead researcher and a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. Forty-two per cent of the 204 mothers surveyed had spanked their young children in the week before the survey, the authors reported in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics. All of the children were younger than 4 .\n\nMothers believed more strongly in spanking for dangerous misbehavior such as getting too close to a hot iron than for annoying antics such as splashing water from the bathtub on to the floor, the survey found. The U.S. surgeon-general in 1985 said corporal punishment should be discouraged at home and forbidden in schools. The 49.000-member American Academy of Pediatrics also has urged that it be outlawed in schools and avoided at home. The U.S .\n\nNational Association of Social Workers is also on record as opposing all spanking at home and at school. A ."
