Pittsboro is the epicenter, if a family can be said to have such a thing, of Murphreedom in North Mississippi. Her ancestors were leaders (perhaps a voting majority) on the commission appointed by the Mississippi legislature to create Calhoun County and establish its initial county seat and county government.After forming the county, they directed the county surveyor to drive a stake in the absolute geographic center of the county, declared that that was the county seat and that its name was Pittsboro.\n\nYou will recall that the last home of the first Daniel Murphree (from whom we all descend) was Pittsboro, North Carolina, and they named their new county seat for the ancient ancestral home, although I do not think that any of the people on the commission that formed the county had ever actually lived in Pittsboro, NC.They were born along the migratory route between Pittsboro, NC and Pittsboro, MS, but they did honor their ancestral home by that name.\n\nAnyone knowing Mary Frances Murphree Ford in Jackson would have thought that she was one of the founding families of Jackson in that she lived and participated in the community in that fashion.Nevertheless, she did maintain ties back in Calhoun County and at Pittsboro, and regularly cutivated her remaining friends in that area.The MGA has certainly sustained a loss.\n\nMary Frances Ford was one of the charter members of the MGA; and not only a charter member, but a work horse contributor in every respect for 20 years or soafter it was formed.\n\nYou will note that her remains were returned to Pittsboro for burial, as were her parents and her husband .
