        "text": "01 of 30\n\nAcapulco (2021–present)\n\nInspired by the 2017 comedy How to Be a Latin Lover starring Eugenio Derbez, Acapulco features the actor as wealthy mogul Maximo Gallardo Ramos as he recalls his extraordinary life story. Enrique Arrizon plays the younger version of Maximo, who works as a pool boy at a luxury resort in 1980s Acapulco, Mexico. The series is imbued with the warm glow of nostalgia, brought to life with eye-popping colors and a charming cast of supporting players, including Chord Overstreet as the resort's general manager and Vanessa Bauche as Maximo's widowed mother.\n\nIt's easy to make comparisons to other shows, from the comforting energy of Ted Lasso to the resort-centered satire of The White Lotus, but Acapulco also offers something different as a bilingual comedy focused on the working class. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch Acapulco: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Eugenio Derbez, Enrique Arrizon, Damián Alcázar, Camila Perez, Raphael Alejandro\n\n02 of 30\n\nThe Afterparty (2022–2023)\n\nAs former classmates reunite at a high school reunion, the afterparty — held at a luxe mansion owned by former loser–turned–hot Hollywood star Xavier (Dave Franco) — turns deadly when their host is found dead, the subject of an apparent murder. Arriving at the scene of the crime, Detective Danner (Tiffany Haddish) begins questioning each of the guests about their version of the night's events and soon, everyone's secrets start tumbling out about why all the classmates hated Xavier. This deft murder mystery incorporates filmmaking elements of animation, musicals, slasher horror, action, romantic comedy, and more as Danner races to uncover the truth of who killed Xavier and why.\n\nIn season 2, Danner investigates a wedding where there's a new cast of characters to question about a dead groom. Created by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, The Afterparty is full of laughs and revelations as it is with creative flourishes. —Jace Lacob\n\nWhere to watch The Afterparty: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Zoë Chao, Ike Barinholtz, Ben Schwartz, Ilana Glazer, Jamie Demetriou, Dave Franco\n\n03 of 30\n\nBad Sisters (2022–present)\n\nFans of Amazon's Catastrophe will no doubt take pleasure in Sharon Horgan's wickedly funny crime thriller Bad Sisters. The Irish comedy follows Eva, Grace, Ursula, Bibi, and Becka, five sisters who face a life insurance investigation after the death of Grace's abusive husband — though we quickly come to find that Grace's sisters had been secretly plotting his demise all along. As the series bounces back and forth between past and present, the puzzle pieces gradually come together and reveal the true story of how it all went down.\n\nPraised by EW's Nick Romano as \"equal parts emotionally wrenching trauma story, addictive thriller, and giggly whodunnit,\" Bad Sisters turned into a word-of-mouth hit for Apple, which greenlit a second season shortly after the season 1 finale. The acclaimed series has already earned industry recognition, with nominations from the Primetime Emmys, the Critics Choice Awards, and the Writers Guild of America Awards. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Bad Sisters: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Sharon Horgan, Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene, Eve Hewson, Claes Bang, Brian Gleeson, Daryl McCormack, Assaad Bouab, Saise Quinn\n\n04 of 30\n\nBlack Bird (2022)\n\nDennis Lehane, the novelist behind such crime mystery novels as Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, and Shutter Island, developed this six-episode miniseries about the real-life story of Jimmy Keene. Portrayed in the series by Taron Egerton, Keene was sentenced to 10 years in prison without parole after being accused of drug and weapons conspiracy. Authorities then offered him an opportunity for freedom if he was able to coax a confession out of a convicted serial killer.\n\nCritics have hailed Black Bird as an exemplary addition to the true crime genre, with committed performances by Egerton and Paul Walter Hauser, who won an Emmy, Golden Globe, and Critics Choice award for playing suspected serial killer Larry Hall. The limited series also marks one of the final onscreen appearances by Ray Liotta (also Emmy-nominated) as Keene's father. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Black Bird: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Taron Egerton, Paul Walter Hauser, Sepideh Moafi, Greg Kinnear, Ray Liotta\n\n05 of 30\n\nCriminal Record (2024–present)\n\nOld Cop, Young Cop — a dynamic so often repeated it's become a classic TV trope. Criminal Record may be the latest crime drama to riff on this workplace pairing, but its themes of generational divide pack a much greater punch than your average procedural.\n\nCush Jumbo stars as June Lenker, a detective sergeant reexamining a murder case from 2012, questioning if Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Hegarty (Peter Capaldi) got the wrong perp. This leads to tension within the department, with June facing the insidious nature of being a Black woman threatening the status quo of a predominantly white boys club. Jumbo and Capaldi make for compelling leads in what EW's critic calls a \"suspenseful tale of a decade-old murder, institutional power dynamics, and good old-fashioned shoe-leather police work.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Criminal Record: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Peter Capaldi, Cush Jumbo, Zoë Wanamaker, Charlie Creed-Miles, Cathy Tyson, Stephen Campbell Moore, Shaun Dooley\n\n06 of 30\n\nDickinson (2019–2021)\n\nHailee Steinfeld stars in period comedy Dickinson, which explores the life of poet Emily Dickinson, who while little-known during her lifetime, has since become renowned as one of the greatest voices in American literature. Created by Alena Smith, Dickinson blends together the period drama trappings of Emily's life with a modern sensibility — there's Wiz Khalifa as Death, for example, and the soundtrack features modern-day bangers by Billie Eilish, Lizzo, and Mitski. Each episode is inspired by one of Emily Dickinson's poems and Steinfeld, who imbues Emily with a cunning sense of wit in this irresistible coming-of-age story about a woman ahead of her time. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Dickinson: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Hailee Steinfeld, Toby Huss, Adrian Blake Enscoe, Anna Baryshnikov, Ella Hunt, Jane Krakowski\n\n07 of 30\n\nThe Essex Serpent (2022)\n\nBased on the novel by Sarah Perry, The Essex Serpent is an atmospheric period drama centered on Cora Seaborne (Claire Danes), a London widow and amateur scientist, who travels to Essex in search of a mythical serpent. When Cora crosses paths with dishy vicar Will Ransome (Tom Hiddleston), their bond creates ripples through the local community and Cora finds herself the subject of hostility and suspicion when tragedy strikes.\n\nWhat follows is a gothic romance tale with Will trapped between the pull he feels for Cora and his duty to his wife and his congregation, whom he tries to lead out of \"times of uncertainty.\" Is the serpent a harbinger of something evil? Is it real? Danes and Hiddleston anchor a tremendous cast as a village grapples with the mystery of the unknown, the mythic, and the nature of sin. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch The Essex Serpent: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Claire Danes, Tom Hiddleston, Frank Dillane, Hayley Squires, Clémence Poésy, Jamael Westman, Michael Jibson, Gerard Kearns\n\n08 of 30\n\nFive Days at Memorial (2022)\n\nThe harrowing aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is explored in riveting fashion in this eight-part miniseries. The series dramatizes the real-life experiences of doctors and patients who were stuck for five days without power at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans, as well as the investigation into medical staff euthanizing critically ill patients.\n\nThe atrocity of the flooding and subsequent ethical dilemma make for compelling drama, even if what's depicted can be difficult to watch. Still, as EW's critic asserts, \"More Katrinas are inevitable — more Memorials would be a choice. If Five Days serves as the catalyst for some kind of official change, that will be all that matters.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Five Days at Memorial: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Vera Farmiga, Cherry Jones, Cornelius Smith Jr., Robert Pine, Adepero Oduye, Julie Ann Emery, Michael Gaston, Molly Hager\n\n09 of 30\n\nFor All Mankind (2019–present)\n\nFrom the visionary mind of Ronald D. Moore (Battlestar Galactica) comes this alternate-history drama about the space race between the United States and Russia. In the reality posited by the show, the Soviet Union staked its claim as the victor when it landed on the moon first in 1969. In response to the Russians' success, America pushes itself to surpass its rival, bringing women and minorities (who were excluded from the space program) into the heart of the international competition to claim the stars and build the first lunar base.\n\nThe alternate history of For All Mankind becomes a canvas to look at the social and political realities of the 20th century, where \"female pilots like Tracy Stevens (Sarah Jones) and Molly Cobb (Sonya Walger) get fast-tracked at NASA and find themselves struggling against both their own inexperience and the entrenched sexism of American patriarchy.\" The show has been renewed for a fifth season. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch For All Mankind: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Joel Kinnaman, Michael Dorman, Sarah Jones, Shantel VanSanten, Jodi Balfour, Wrenn Schmidt\n\n10 of 30\n\nLessons in Chemistry (2023)\n\nBased on the best-selling novel of the same name, Lessons in Chemistry tells the story of Elizabeth Zott, a gifted chemist living in 1950s America who is fired from her job as a lab tech after getting pregnant out of wedlock. Elizabeth decides to take her skills elsewhere by becoming the host of a TV cooking show — and turning into a feminist icon in the process.\n\nThe eight-episode miniseries, which EW calls \"a delightful concoction,\" stars Academy Award winner Brie Larson as Zott, who dedicated extensive research to her role. As series creator Lee Eisenberg told EW, \"She's a very believable chemist, and she is a more than believable cook. More than that, she just has a giant heart, and all of that comes through.\" Indeed it does, with Larson turning in an inspiring yet nuanced performance, while the series around her is a compelling period drama pastiche. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Lessons in Chemistry: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Brie Larson, Lewis Pullman, Aja Naomi King, Stephanie Koenig, Patrick Walker\n\n11 of 30\n\nLoot (2022–present)\n\nThis charming comedy stars Maya Rudolph as an obscenely wealthy woman moving on to the next chapter of her life after divorcing her cheating husband. Molly decides to involve herself in the charitable organization she forgot she founded years ago, though she gets off to a bumpy start. Her out-of-touch perspective juts up against the earnest intentions of the foundation, leading to more than a few PR mishaps.\n\nEW's critic calls the series \"a hoot,\" with particular praise for the ensemble cast including Michaela Jaé Rodriguez as the foundation's dedicated director and Joel Kim Booster as Molly's snobbish assistant. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Loot: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Maya Rudolph, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Joel Kim Booster, Ron Funches, Nat Faxon, Meagen Fay, Stephanie Styles\n\n12 of 30\n\nMasters of the Air (2024)\n\nFans of HBO's Band of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010) now have a third epic war miniseries — this time on Apple TV+ — from executive producers Gary Goetzman, Tom Hanks, and Steven Spielberg. The nine-episode limited series centers on the 100th Bomb Group, an Air Force bomber unit fighting in World War II. Balancing high-production value spectacle with intimate human drama, Masters of the Air is an absorbing drama that doesn't shy away from depicting the human cost of war.\n\nLike Band of Brothers and The Pacific before it, the series also stars some of the brightest young male actors working today, including Austin Butler, Callum Turner, and Barry Keoghan. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Masters of the Air: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle, Barry Keoghan, Nikolai Kinski, Stephen Campbell Moore, Sawyer Spielberg, Isabel May, James Murray\n\n13 of 30\n\nMonarch: Legacy of Monsters (2023–present)\n\nThis TV installment of the MonsterVerse franchise takes a slightly more grounded approach than the action-oriented Godzilla and/or Kong films that predate it. In the series, half-siblings Cate (Anna Sawai) and Kentaro (Ren Watabe) team up to investigate the disappearance of their father, Hiroshi, and his involvement with the monster-tracking organization Monarch. Joining them is Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell), a former colonel who worked with Cate and Kentaro's grandparents at Monarch in the '50s. In a clever bit of casting, the series provides a dual narrative in which Russell's real-life son, Wyatt Russell, portrays Lee Shaw in his younger days.\n\nWhile Monarch does feature quite a few monsters as promised, the series is also more focused on humans than you'd typically expect from films within the same universe. \"It's the journey of two siblings to uncover the secrets their father kept and why he kept them,\" executive producer Chris Black told EW, adding, \"This is a show about people who have woken up and live in a world where monsters are real.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Monarch: Legacy of Monsters: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Anna Sawai, Ren Watabe, Kurt Russell, Wyatt Russell, Kiersey Clemons, Mari Yamamoto, Anders Holm, Joe Tippett, Elisa Lasowski\n\n14 of 30\n\nMythic Quest (2020–present)\n\nCreated by It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Megan Ganz, workplace comedy Mythic Quest centers on the employees of a video game studio responsible for one of the industry's biggest hits who are anything but responsible adults. Creative director Ian Grimm (McElhenny) constantly clashes with his lead engineer — and later co-director — Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) over the creative direction of the titular MMORPG Mythic Quest and just about everyone else at the company. The result is if you crossed the workplace dynamics of The Office with the caustic humor of Sunny but doubled down on the weird, niche factors.\n\nWhile some shows would have been content to merely focus on workplace shenanigans, Mythic Quest continually tests the elasticity of its format, producing episodes set in the 1970s or without its main characters altogether. The result is one of the most original, incisive, and compelling comedies on television right now. Season 4 is presently in production. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Mythic Quest: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Rob McElhenney, Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, Imani Hakim, David Hornsby, Charlotte Nicdao, Danny Pudi\n\n15 of 30\n\nPachinko (2022–present)\n\nThis critically acclaimed drama — created by Soo Hugh (The Terror) and based on the New York Times best-selling novel by Min Jin Lee — follows four generations of a Korean family over the course of a turbulent century. The result is an epic, powerful, globe-trotting, multigenerational story about immigration, diaspora, identity, and opportunity.\n\nPachinko shuttles between matriarch Sunja (played by Academy Award winner Yuh-jung Youn as an older woman and as a young woman by Minha Kim) and her grandson Solomon (Jin Ha), an investment banker in Tokyo as he moves through his own life in the present day. Described by EW's critic as \"gripping\" and a \"beautiful, yearning testament to the concept of home,\" this is one drama not to be missed.

The SNL vet plays Maxine, an aspiring socialite who desperately tries to integrate herself into sunny Palm Beach's high society. Set in 1969 and featuring an all-star cast that includes Laura Dern, Allison Janney, and Carol Burnett, the series is a vibrant throwback to women-centered primetime dramas like Desperate Housewives, while also exploring resonant themes such as the desire to belong and the price you have to pay to attain that higher status. The 11-time Emmy-nominated series has been renewed for a second season. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Palm Royale: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Kristen Wiig, Ricky Martin, Josh Lucas, Leslie Bibb, Amber Chardae Robinson, Laura Dern, Allison Janney, Carol Burnett\n\n17 of 30\n\nPlatonic (2023–present)\n\nSeth Rogen and Rose Byrne proved to have a unique, winning chemistry with 2014's Neighbors (and its 2016 sequel), and this charming comedy series shows they've still got it. This time, the pair play Will and Sylvia, former best friends who reconnect after Will divorces his wife, whom Sylvia did not care for. Both are at a point where they're taking stock of how they got to this place in their lives and where to go from here, and seeking comfort in having each other to rely on.\n\nWhile the series may be relatively low stakes, EW's critic writes, \"I'm certainly not going to be so ghoulish as to suggest that all comedy series need to have a message. TV is allowed to be fun, and Platonic just wants to show you a good time.\" Platonic has been renewed for a second season. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Platonic: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Luke Macfarlane, Tre Hale, Andrew Lopez, Carla Gallo\n\n18 of 30\n\nPresumed Innocent (2024–present)\n\nTV maestro David E. Kelley adapts Scott Turow's classic best-selling novel in this riveting legal thriller series. As fans of Turow's novel and its 1990 film adaptation starring Harrison Ford know, Presumed Innocent follows Rusty Sabich (played here by Jake Gyllenhaal), a prosecutor who takes on the case of a murdered colleague — without disclosing he cheated on his wife with her. After a rival prosecutor suspects Rusty may have been the murderer, he must fight to prove his innocence.\n\nKelley, who has previously spun dramas like The Practice, Ally McBeal, and Big Little Lies into Emmy-winning gold, is right in his element here, expanding upon the original story without deviating from what's kept readers and viewers in suspense for decades. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Presumed Innocent: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Ruth Negga, Bill Camp, O-T Fagbenle, Chase Infiniti, Nana Mensah, Renate Reinsve, Peter Sarsgaard, Kingston Rumi Southwick, Elizabeth Marvel\n\n19 of 30\n\nSchmigadoon! (2021–2023)\n\nSchmigadoon! is a loving (and sometimes biting) satire for musical theater nerds. Cecily Strong and Keegan-Michael Key star as Melissa and Josh, a couple on a backpacking trip trying to salvage their relationship, who stumble upon the mysteriously cheerful town of Schmigadoon. As it turns out, the community is stuck in a Golden Age-era musical populated with all the tropes you would expect, including the handsome rogue, the farmer's daughter, the humble schoolmarm, and judgmental townsfolk.\n\nThe series features all original music (including the undeniably catchy Emmy-winning song \"Corn Puddin'\"), toeing the line between irony and earnestness. While the first season told its own complete story, season 2 found Melissa and Josh entering a whole new musical world — Schmicago — which satirized the darker, sexier musicals released in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Schmigadoon!: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Cecily Strong, Keegan-Michael Key, Dove Cameron, Jaime Camil, Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Cumming, Ariana DeBose, Ann Harada, Jane Krakowski, Aaron Tveit\n\n20 of 30\n\nServant (2019–2023)\n\nAn unsettling quality permeates every second of M. Night Shyamalan's slow-burn psychological horror Servant. After the accidental death of their newborn son Jericho, local news anchor Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose) and chef Sean (Toby Kebbell) struggle to hold onto their sanity...until they find a replacement for their lost child in a reborn doll and hire nanny Leanne (Nell Tiger Free) to care for it.\n\nBut Leanne isn't your bog-standard Midwesterner — the mysterious nanny has formidable supernatural powers over which she has little, if any, control. As Dorothy struggles with acute mental illness, convinced that her baby has been kidnapped, Dorothy's brother Julian (Rupert Grint) becomes aware of Leanne's strange abilities. The result is a surprisingly droll horror-drama, one which becomes \"even darker, scarier, and funnier\" in its second season. All four seasons are currently available to stream — just don't watch with the lights off. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Servant: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Lauren Ambrose, Toby Kebbell, Nell Tiger Free, Rupert Grint\n\n21 of 30\n\nSeverance (2022–present)\n\nWith 14 Emmy nominations and two wins in tow, sci-fi/dark comedy-thriller Severance, from creator Dan Erickson and directors Ben Stiller and Aoife McArdle, focuses on a group of tech workers — including Adam Scott, John Turturro, and Christopher Walken — who undergo a procedure known as \"severance,\" splitting their memories between home and work. Productive workers don't need to be bogged down by problems at home, and wouldn't it be great to leave your work troubles at the office door?\n\nHowever, this is a trippy thriller, so things tend to go horribly wrong. The intriguing concept centers on Mark (Scott), a grieving history teacher mourning his dead wife who gets to turn off his feelings every time he enters the basement floor of Lumon HQ, a stark white environment that is both cold and alienating. What follows is a profound reflection on technology, productivity, and memory. Season 2 has wrapped filming, with the premiere date slated for Jan. 17, 2025. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Severance: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Adam Scott, Zach Cherry, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Jen Tullock, Dichen Lachman, Michael Chernus, John Turturro, Christopher Walken, Patricia Arquette\n\n22 of 30\n\nShining Girls (2022)\n\nElisabeth Moss, Jamie Bell, and Wagner Moura headline this mind-bending thriller based on the novel by Lauren Beukes. Moss plays newspaper archivist Kirby Mazrachi, who was attacked and left for dead by a mysterious killer, leaving her traumatized. When Kirby encounters an attack like her own, she teams up with reporter Dan Velazquez (Moura) to dig into the incident and they \"uncover a killing spree that inexplicably spans several decades,\" committed by a sociopath killer (Bell).\n\nThis would be enough to unnerve anyone, but Shining Girls takes its creepy conceit even farther as Kirby is left perpetually off-kilter and unbalanced as her life continually shifts after her attack. Flitting through realities, Kirby and Dan race to end the killer's reign of terror in a series that masterfully blends together sci-fi, horror, and feminist drama. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Shining Girls: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Elisabeth Moss, Wagner Moura, Phillipa Soo, Chris Chalk, Amy Brenneman, Jamie Bell\n\n23 of 30\n\nShrinking (2023–present)\n\nWhat happens when a psychiatrist finally expresses what they really think about their patients' situations? Such is the hook of Shrinking, with Jason Segel playing Jimmy, a grieving therapist who tries a more direct approach in his sessions and discovers that it actually starts to help his patients move forward. Harrison Ford — in a rare TV role — portrays Jimmy's colleague and mentor Paul, who is dealing with his own personal struggles.\n\nSegel also created the series alongside Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein, with this serving as a logical extension of the kind of poignant comedy and compassion delivered on their other show, Ted Lasso. As EW's critic raves, Shrinking is \"a funny, brainy grief-com about the power — and dangers — of radical honesty.\" The second season begins on Oct. 16. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Shrinking: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Jason Segel, Jessica Williams, Luke Tennie, Michael Urie, Lukita Maxwell, Christa Miller, Harrison Ford\n\n24 of 30\n\nSilo (2023–present)\n\nEmmy-winning writer Graham Yost (Justified) adapts Hugh Howey's Silo book series to the small screen in this dystopian thriller. The show takes place in the distant future, where the uninhabitable conditions of Earth have forced its inhabitants underground. Living in a subterranean silo, the community is kept in the dark about the outside world. Everything changes after a hard drive is discovered, uncovering hidden truths of the past.\n\nThe mystery series — as noted by many critics — is a descendant of Lost and other sci-fi dramas of its ilk, with a starry ensemble led by Rebecca Ferguson as a rebellious engineer. The show's second season premieres Nov. 15. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Silo: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Rebecca Ferguson, Rashida Jones, David Oyelowo, Common, Tim Robbins, Harriet Walter\n\n25 of 30\n\nSlow Horses (2022–present)\n\nBased on the Slough House books by British novelist Mick Herron, high-octane espionage drama Slow Horses focuses on the denizens of Slough House, a purgatory for \"slow horses,\" or English intelligence operatives who have flamed out spectacularly.\n\nOverseen with gruff irritation by often flatulent and always offensive spook Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman), Slough House is where failed spies dream of one day making it back to Regents Park, where their careers all went wrong. Among those stuck in Slough House is River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) — a one-time golden boy and grandson of Regents Park big cheese David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce) — whose own career burned to the ground, much to the irritation of (or perhaps because of) current MI5 bigwig Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas), an icy authoritarian. When the slow horses are drawn into a kidnapping plot, they race to save the victim, unaware of the larger chess game being played by Taverner and others. Season 4 is slated to begin Sept. 4. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Slow Horses: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Gary Oldman, Jack Lowden, Kristin Scott Thomas\n\n26 of 30\n\nStillwater (2020–2023)\n\nWhile Apple TV+ may be more known for its prestige adult-oriented programming, there's still plenty to enjoy for kids. Stillwater — adapted from the picture book Zen Shorts by John J. Muth — is one of the more beloved children's shows on the streamer, telling short and sweet stories of a trio of young siblings who live next to a panda named Stillwater. The wise panda imparts crucial life lessons to the siblings while finding beauty and fun in the little things in life. Stillwater has won multiple awards including Emmys and a Peabody. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Stillwater: Apple TV+\n\nCast: James Sie, Eva Ariel Binder, Tucker Chandler, Judah Mackey\n\n27 of 30\n\nSunny (2024–present)\n\nThis sci-fi series with darkly comedic undertones gives Rashida Jones one of her best showcases in years. Set in futuristic Japan, the series centers on Suzie (Jones), an American expat whose husband and son mysteriously disappear in a plane crash. Though she presumes them to be dead, Suzie is thrown for a loop when she is gifted a doe-eyed robot named Sunny, courtesy of her husband's company — unaware he even worked in robotics in the first place. Suzie doggedly tries to get to the bottom of what happened to her family, while forming a reluctant relationship with her unwanted new houseguest. Bittersweet in tone, Sunny is a compellingly original mystery anchored with complexity by Jones. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Sunny: Apple TV+\n\nCast: Rashida Jones, Hidetoshi Nishijima, Joanna Sotomura, Judy Ongg, annie the clumsy, Jun Kunimura, You\n\n28 of 30\n\nSwagger (2021–2023)\n\nInspired by the experiences of NBA star Kevin Durant, Swagger is an engrossing glimpse into the high-stakes world of youth basketball, charting the journey of Jace Carson (Isaiah Hill), a 14-year-old prospect hoping to make it to the big leagues. O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays Jace's mentor, Ike, who went through this experience in his youth and hopes to lead the next generation. Similar to other beloved sports-centered series like Friday Night Lights and Ted Lasso, Swagger finds value in the people behind the players, investing you in its characters by focusing as much on their personal lives as their professional exploits. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Swagger: Apple TV+\n\nCast: O'Shea Jackson Jr., Isaiah Hill, Shinelle Azoroh, Tessa Ferrer, Quvenzhané Wallis, Caleel Harris, James Bingham, Solomon Irama, Ozie Nzeribe, Jason Rivera, Tristan Wilds\n\n29 of 30\n\nTed Lasso (2020–2023)\n\nBelieve: This Emmy award-winning feel-good comedy is about far more than just sports. In its sophomore season, Ted Lasso — co-created by Bill Lawrence — deepened all of its characters, including its titular lead, perpetually chipper American college football coach Ted Lasso (Jason Sudeikis), who left behind a failed marriage to manage a struggling British football (read: soccer) team in Blighty. There, he encountered a ragtag team of oddballs and resistance from the team's divorcée owner (Hannah Waddingham), whom he won over with home-baked biscuits and his aw-shucks charm.\n\nInstead of coasting on its first season, the \"sweeter, weirder\" second season of Ted Lasso chose to take a more difficult route, exploring Ted's motivations and pushing his adoring assistant coach Nate (Nick Mohammed) to new extremes. The season 3 finale dropped in May 2023, and Though it's still unclear whether season 3 was the end of the series forever (or if there will be some sort of spinoff), we're Richmond till we die. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Ted Lasso: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Jason Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, Jeremy Swift, Phil Dunster, Brett Goldstein, Brendan Hunt, Nick Mohammed, Juno Temple"
