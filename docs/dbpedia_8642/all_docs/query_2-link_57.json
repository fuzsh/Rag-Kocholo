Yet Leach feels it may have broken a jinx. By THE CANADIAN PRESS The touring Soviet all-star team, opened with some accurate shooting and hung on for a 4-3 win Thursday night over Winnipeg Jets of the World Hockey Association .\n\nThe all-stars had Just five shots on goal in the first period. But four of the shots by Sergei Makarov, Jirev Gimaev, Alexander Volkov and Alexander Andrev beat Winnipeg goalie Markus Mattson. The Jets replied with first-period goals by Morris \"Lukowich and Kith Preston, and a second-period tally by Peter Sullivan.

There was no scoring in the third period .\n\nThe Jets, playing at home before a near-capacity crowd of 9,912, had a 33-27 edge in shots on goal.
