An avid hockey fan since my early teens, I realized that no one had ever written a comprehensive book about the team. Inspired by the thought of telling the Penguins’ story, I began to do research. I spent my weekends combing through microfilm files of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Pittsburgh Press at the Carnegie Library. During my free time I began to craft what eventually became a piece of the “Down Through the Seasons” chapter. Little did I realize at the time that this book would be 19 years in the making! Over the next several years I wrote in fits and starts, adding seasons and player profiles here and there. As the team’s fortunes took a turn for the worse in the early part of this decade, I stopped writing altogether. Around 2006, however, I pulled the book out of mothballs. Determined to finish what I started, I once more began to work on it in earnest. When Tom Bast of Triumph Books responded to my query about a publishing deal in the fall of 2009, I had a mini-version of what would ultimately become Total Penguins in place. It was his vision to do the book on a grander scale. Tom’s willingness to take a chance on a first-time author, and Adam Motin’s invaluable assistance and continual support throughout the project, helped to make my lifelong dream of authoring a book about the Penguins come true. I’d like to thank Dave Molinari of the Pittsburgh PostGazette for graciously contributing the foreword. The author of his own book about the Penguins—Best in the Game—Dave has covered the team for more than 25 years with a masterful blend of insight and humor. In 2009 he received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame. I’m honored that he was willing to contribute to Total Penguins. So many people offered encouragement throughout this process. It goes without saying that without the love and support of my family, Total Penguins would not have been possible. I wish to acknowledge Connor Buker, Dan Buker, Joshua Buker, Karen Buker, Kyle Buker, Laurie Buker, Linda Buker, Alexander Costello, Chase Costello, Roger\n\n00TP10_FrontMatter.indd 5\n\nCostello, Bonnie Faucheux, the late Susan Haley, and John and Linda Tinnemeyer for their support and indulgence. Friends played a big part, too. I’d like to thank Rich Arthurs, Ric Drake, Dave Karpinski, Kathryn Kluk, Stasi Longo, Mike Shullo, Debbie Stockdale, Mike Verdello, Shelby Whaley, and Dave Yelich, and fellow “hockey nuts” Rob Black, Tom Blanciak, Evan Freshwater, Ryan Kish, and Paul Sarknas for their steadfast encouragement. A special word of thanks goes to Stasi, who provided much-needed insight and guidance along the way. I owe a large debt of gratitude to Melanie Blaser, my friend and supervisor at my former employer, Consolidated Natural Gas Company. Melanie mentored me for countless hours and did so much to nurture and develop the skills required for Total Penguins. My sincere appreciation goes to my boss, Dave Wright, and my coworkers at Wright’s Gym in Pittsburgh. Although we operate with a lean staff, Dave allowed me to work parttime during the height of our busy season. Travis Gracey selflessly picked up two of my shifts—often putting in 50- to 60-hour weeks—while I did the lion’s share of the writing. Bob Mazuer assumed extra duties and volunteered to work during his off hours. Their sacrifices enabled me to complete the book in a timely fashion, while easing my burden. Likewise, I wish to acknowledge Allison Alexander, Shari Smedley, Angelika Kane, and the marketing staff at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for their help and support during the photo selection process. They graciously shared their office with me while providing training and other resources. A special thanks to everyone who has played for or been a part of the Penguins organization over the years, from Mario Lemieux to the locker-room attendees. Without their supreme effort and sacrifice, there would be no story to tell. Last but not least, I wish to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Through Him, all things are possible.\n\n8/30/10 2:32 PM\n\nForeword T\n\nhe Pittsburgh Penguins have been a lot of things since they entered the National Hockey League in 1967. Controversial. Combative. Endangered. Entertaining. Woefully inept. Wildly successful. During the franchise’s first four-plus decades—and there were several times when there was little reason to believe it would last that long—it won three Stanley Cups, survived two bankruptcies, produced 13 NHL scoring champions, fended off threats to transplant it to such diverse locales as Hamilton, Ontario, and Kansas City, and sent no fewer than 17 players, coaches, and executives to the Hockey Hall of Fame. All of that is chronicled in Total Penguins, a comprehensive look at the story, with all its brilliance and blemishes, of a franchise that has experienced the highest highs and lowest lows imaginable. It covers the triumphs of their championships and the off-ice tragedies, like the untimely death of Michel Briere in an auto accident after his rookie season. Hundreds of players, from Ramzi Abid to Sergei Zubov, have pulled on a Penguins sweater—whatever colors it happened to be at the time—since 1967, and many of them aren’t household names beyond the confines of their backyards. Others, though, are among the most storied and celebrated figures in hockey history. The headliner since 1984 has, of course, been Mario Lemieux, who became the cornerstone of the franchise when he was the first player selected in that year’s draft. He went on to lead the Penguins to their first two Stanley Cups, being honored as the most valuable performer in the playoffs both times. Little more than a year after retiring as a player in 1997, he brought the team out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, though, didn’t settle for having the view from the owner’s box, and revived his playing career late in 2000, remaining on active duty until 2005, when a heart ailment finally caused him to hang up his skates for good. Just a few years later, however, his protégé, Sidney Crosby, captained the Penguins to their first championship with Lemieux as the boss. Lemieux hardly is the only world-class talent who has passed through Pittsburgh. Jaromir Jagr had his most productive seasons with the Penguins. Ron Francis was a key\n\n00TP10_FrontMatter.indd 7\n\nmember of their first two Cup-winning squads. So was Joe Mullen, who was a member of the Penguins when he became the first U.S.-born player to score 500 goals. Hall of Famer Paul Coffey added to his Cup collection while playing for the Penguins, too. Although the Penguins didn’t win their first championship until 1991, there were some pretty special players who passed through Pittsburgh before that, and Total Penguins doesn’t neglect them. While the franchise struggled to find its footing and a niche in the city’s sports hierarchy during its early years, by the mid-1970s, its lineup featured the gifted likes of Pierre Larouche and the “Century Line” of Syl Apps, Jean Pronovost, and Lowell MacDonald. Those with an appreciation for good defense admired the shotblocking ability of Dave Burrows, and fans of give-noquarter hockey—and there’s never been a shortage of those in Pittsburgh—roared their support for Bob “Battleship” Kelly and Steve “Demolition Durby” Durbano. For years, the Penguins’ most memorable moments came in defeat, and the 1975 squad that was built around those players suffered one of the most epic setbacks in hockey history, as the New York Islanders became just the second NHL team ever to rally from a 3–0 deficit to win a bestof-seven playoff series. That devastating loss was followed in short order by a plunge into receivership, and highlights and happy moments during the late 1970s and early 1980s were all too rare for Penguins fans. And again, there were heartbreaking playoff defeats by superior opponents—to St. Louis in double overtime in 1981, to the Islanders in overtime a year later—that continued to define the franchise as star-crossed. The Penguins bottomed out in 1983–84, when they earned a mere 38 points, but their fortunes took a dramatic turn for the better in June 1984 when Lemieux was put on the payroll. There still were tough times and frustrations to be endured, but at that point, the Penguins began the metamorphosis into the top-shelf operation they are today. Some key pieces still had to be put in place—hiring Craig Patrick as general manager in 1989 was another critical moment in the Penguins’ evolution—but it was clear the\n\n8/30/10 2:32 PM\n\nviii\n\nTotal Penguins\n\ncornerstone was in place from the moment Lemieux scored a goal on his first professional shift. The Penguins’ fortunes began to pick up. So did their victories total. And the crowds at the Civic Arena. Long before they won their first Stanley Cup, they had cemented their place as a major force on the city’s sporting landscape and when that championship did arrive, their fans celebrated with a pent-up exuberance born of all those years of defeat and disappointment. And now, nearly 20 years later, Lemieux and Francis and Jagr have given way to the likes of Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, and Marc-Andre Fleury as cultural icons in Western Pennslyvania, players whose popularity rivals, or surpasses, that of any athletes in the city. The years of ownership that were less than stable are way in the rearview mirror, and the\n\n00TP10_FrontMatter.indd 8\n\nPenguins are moving into the new arena they believe will give them the resources to remain competitive for decades to come. Of course, the Penguins aren’t the only pro hockey team that has called Pittsburgh its home, and Total Penguins doesn’t ignore their predecessors. Fans interested in just how deep the game’s roots run in Western Pennsylvania will find a chapter detailing clubs like the Pirates, Yellow Jackets, and, of course, the Hornets, the American Hockey League club that was the primary tenant at the Civic Arena before the Penguins moved in. The story of hockey in Pittsburgh is a rich and long one. And Total Penguins tells it all. —Dave Molinari, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\n8/30/10 2:32 PM\n\nTotal Penguins\n\n00TP10_FrontMatter.indd 9\n\n8/30/10 2:32 PM\n\n1\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 10\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons A\n\nfter operating as a tightly knit six-team organization for nearly 25 years, the National Hockey League stunned the sports world in 1965 by unveiling plans to double in size for the 1967–68 season. The announcement drew the attention of a pair of former law school classmates, Pennsylvania senator Jack McGregor and attorney Peter Block. Determined to bring big-league hockey back to Pittsburgh, they began to line up investors and gather information on the bidding process. McGregor and Block soon learned the NHL’s expansion plan was based on geography. The league planned to add two teams from the West Coast, two from the Midwest, and two from the East. With Philadelphia already earmarked as one of the eastern clubs, Pittsburgh faced some stiff competition. “Our closest competition was Buffalo,” McGregor recalled. “The Buffalo group went all out to pick off the sixth franchise. Two half brothers, Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings, and Jim Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks, began leaning toward Buffalo.” Fortunately, McGregor had an ace in the hole. He enlisted the help of Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney Sr., who had connections to the Norris brothers through the horse-racing business. “I’ll never forget Art calling each from his New York City hotel room, in my presence,” McGregor recalled. “He said to each: ‘You owe this to me. You cannot put Buffalo ahead of Pittsburgh. It would be personally embarrassing to me if you did.’” A short time later the NHL awarded a franchise to McGregor’s 21-man syndicate, which included Rooney and some of the most prominent names in Pittsburgh business society. The other franchises were awarded to Los Angeles, Minneapolis–St. Paul, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco–Oakland. Senator McGregor’s first order of business was to select a general manager. In May of 1966 he chose Jack Riley\n\nto fill the post. A man with vast hockey experience, the 46-year-old Riley had served as the general manager for the Rochester Americans and later as president of the American Hockey League. Riley immediately hired 36-year-old George James “Red” Sullivan to coach the club. A former captain of the New York Rangers, Sullivan starred in the NHL for nine seasons. After hanging up his skates he coached the Rangers for three seasons. With the management team in place, attention shifted to choosing a name. As suggestions poured in, McGregor decided to sponsor a “Name the Team” contest. After accepting 26,400 entries, McGregor announced that the team would be called the Penguins. “Most fans wanted to keep the Hornets name,” Jack Riley recalled. “I certainly wasn’t in favor of the name Penguins at the time, but it caught on.” Indeed, the Hornets would cast a large shadow over the fledgling franchise. While Riley and Sullivan were busy preparing for the upcoming Expansion Draft, the Hornets were tearing up the AHL. Arguably one of the most powerful minor league teams ever assembled, they steamrollered the competition en route to the Calder Cup. For Riley and Sullivan, the timing couldn’t have been worse. The Hornets’ success pushed them to build a team that could compete right away. They consciously emphasized experience, an approach that led them to bypass younger players. Still, the duo did their homework. In the fall of 1966 Riley unearthed a gem by signing goaltender Les Binkley. A vastly underrated performer, Binkley had never been given a shot by the established NHL clubs because he wore contact lenses. “The contact lenses, that’s what kept me back,” Binkley said. “[The managers] knew I had good reflexes, but they were afraid I couldn’t see.”\n\nCraig Simpson is congratulated by Mario Lemieux after scoring a big goal.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 1\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n2\n\nTotal Penguins\n\n1967–68 Record: 27–34–13 Points: 67 Goals For: 195 Goals Against: 216 Finish: Fifth (West) Coach: Red Sullivan General Manager: Jack Riley On June 5, 1967, Senator McGregor signed a check for $2 million and the Penguins became official members of the National Hockey League. The following day he and his staff gathered at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal for the Expansion Draft. Since the established teams were allowed to protect 11 skaters and a goaltender, the talent pool consisted mainly of former stars and fringe players. Staying true to their “win now” philosophy, the Penguins’ brass selected mostly veterans. As a result, the team averaged a creaking 32 years of age. The Pens’ first pick was Joe Daley, a 24-year-old goaltender from the Red Wings’ system. Conscious of making the team strong down the middle, Riley chose New York center Earl Ingarfield as his first position player. After 12 rounds were completed, McGregor got a strong endorsement from Montreal general manager Sam Pollock. A keen judge of talent, Pollock told the Penguins owner that his club—along with Oakland—had done the best job of drafting. Some of the Pens’ top picks came from the Detroit Red Wings. They included husky winger Ab McDonald and stocky Leo Boivin, a rock ’em, sock ’em defenseman. But the best pick was yet to come. “Going into the 17th round I noticed that Andy Bathgate was still available. He was expensive [$75,000], another reason why he had not been selected. But I felt he had a year or two left in him and should be worth the investment,” McGregor said. “I told Jack Riley, our general manager, ‘Let’s go for Andy Bathgate.’” The Penguins promptly snatched up the former Hart Trophy winner, who would serve as a major gate attraction. In an effort to boost fan support even further, Riley picked as many former Hornets as possible. Indeed, the Penguins roster boasted no fewer than nine onetime Wasps, including Bathgate, Boivin, McDonald, Bob Dillabough, Val Fonteyne, Dick Mattiussi, Art Stratton, Gene Ubriaco, and popular goaltender Hank Bassen. Dubbed “Sully’s Skaters” by the local press, the Pens posted an impressive 4–1–1 mark in exhibition play. With proven veterans like Bathgate, Ingarfield, and Boivin leading the way, many experts felt the new Pittsburgh entry was a cinch to capture the West Division crown. The first meeting between an established club and an expansion team took place on October 11, 1967, pitting the Penguins against the powerhouse Montreal Canadiens at the Civic Arena.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 2\n\nHall of Famer Andy Bathgate led the club in scoring in 1967–68.\n\nA healthy crowd of 9,307 fans turned out to watch the Canadiens nip the Pens 2–1 in a tight defensive struggle. Bathgate scored the first Penguins goal, while legendary Montreal center Jean Beliveau reached a milestone by notching his 400th career goal. “[Goalie Rogie] Vachon saved the game for us,” Habs coach Toe Blake said. “On a given night, with everybody playing well, Pittsburgh is going to win some games against the old clubs.” Led by Bathgate, who exploded for six goals in the first seven games, the Pens zoomed into second place. However, Ingarfield was felled by a knee injury and the club began a gradual fade, while Minnesota and St. Louis gained ground. By the end of January the Penguins had tumbled to fifth place. To make matters worse, key performers Ken Schinkel and Les Binkley were sidelined with injuries. The team rebounded to win its last four games, but it was too little too late. The Pens finished a scant two points behind fourth-place Minnesota and missed the playoffs. In the fiercely competitive West Division, the team trailed the first-place Philadelphia Flyers by only six points. On an individual level the ruggedly handsome Bathgate was every bit the marquee player the club had hoped for. He\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\nhad a wonderful season, leading all West Division players with 59 points, including 20 goals. “He was the best 17th-round draft choice in sports history,” Riley said. Captain Ab McDonald also had a fine year, notching a team-high 22 goals, while rookie Gene Ubriaco chipped in with 18. Ingarfield, Schinkel, and Boivin contributed with solid campaigns. The most pleasant surprise was Binkley. The 33-year-old rookie justified Riley’s faith in him by posting a sparkling 2.88 goals-against average and six shutouts, the latter a club record that stood for 30 years. Unfortunately, the team did not fare well at the box office. Steel City fans were used to cheering for a winner. They did not warm easily to a team with a losing record. At the end of the season the Penguins received a sorely needed infusion of cash when a group of nine Michigan businessmen headed by Detroit bank executive Donald Parsons purchased an 80 percent interest in the club. Parsons replaced McGregor on the board of governors, while the latter continued to serve as team president.

According to former general manager Jack Riley, the payroll for the inaugural Pens team totaled around $315,000—a mere pittance when compared to today’s salaries. Fast-forward to the 2009–10 season when the NHL salary cap was set at $56.8 million. The lowest-paid Penguin—backup goalie Brent Johnson—earned $525,000.\n\n1968–69 Record: 20–45–11 Points: 51 Goals For: 189 Goals Against: 252 Finish: Fifth (West) Coach: Red Sullivan General Manager: Jack Riley The team’s philosophy of drafting veterans had failed to produce a winner. With a roster packed with 16 players aged 30 years or older, Donald Parsons wisely recognized the need for a farm system. Taking his cue from the frontrunning Flyers and Kings, who had each purchased a minor league team, he struck a working agreement with Amarillo of the Central Hockey League. Riley brought in Jack Button, a trusted lieutenant from his American Hockey League days, to manage the new club. Riley gave the team a facelift during the off-season with an emphasis on improving the club down the middle, where it was paper thin. He dealt Ab McDonald to St. Louis in a three-team trade that netted center Lou Angotti, the captain of the division-champion Flyers. In one of his best deals ever, Riley picked up a young French Canadian right wing named Jean Pronovost from Boston for a first-round draft pick. The addition of Pronovost helped ease the loss of Bathgate, who abruptly called it quits before the end of training camp. Despite the new faces, the Penguins faded quickly. Although the club had a modicum of talent, they were a passive team that didn’t like the rough going, a trait that galled the combative Sullivan to no end. “Some of these guys feel all they’ve got to do is throw their sticks on the ice,” he fumed. “They better get on the ball, I tell you that.”\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n4\n\nTotal Penguins\n\nThe 1968–69 Penguins are ready for action.\n\nIn late January, with the club mired in last place and floundering in the midst of a nine-game winless streak, Riley made some drastic changes. He dealt aging Leo Boivin to Minnesota for veteran defenseman Duane Rupp. The following week Riley pulled off a blockbuster sixplayer trade with Oakland. He sent two of the team’s top scorers, Ingarfield and Ubriaco, along with defenseman Dick Mattiussi to the Seals for forward George Swarbrick, utility player Bryan Watson, and minor league defenseman Tracy Pratt. Riley was roundly criticized for giving up too much for three players who had scored a combined total of five goals. But he knew his club lacked the snarl that Swarbrick, Watson, and Pratt would supply. The key player in the deal was Watson. Nicknamed “Bugsy” for his irritating style of play, he made a name for himself by checking Chicago great Bobby Hull to a standstill during the 1966 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Indeed, Watson had taken to the daunting task of shadowing the Chicago superman with such fervor that he immediately became known as “the Boy on Bobby’s Back.” Although the Penguins finished in a fifth-place tie with the North Stars, there were a few bright spots. The newcomers pumped some badly needed life into the club. The Pens finished with a respectable 10–13–4 record in the final two months, including a team-record six-game unbeaten streak to end the season. Schinkel led the club in scoring with 52 points. For the second year in a row the Johnny Unitas look-alike played in the All-Star Game. Gritty Keith McCreary enjoyed the best season of his career with 25 goals. The speedy Pronovost had a fine rookie campaign, rolling up 16 goals and 41 points.\n\nKen Schinkel Charlie Burns Keith McCreary Jean Pronovost Lou Angotti Val Fonteyne Wally Boyer Bob Woytowich Gene Ubriaco Earl lngarfield Billy Harris Noel Price Billy Dea Leo Boivin Dunc McCallum Paul Andrea Duane Rupp George Swarbrick Bill Speer Tracy Pratt Ron Snell Bryan Watson Doug Barrie Gary Swain Dick Mattiussi John Arbour Jean-Guy Lagace Marv Edwards Bill Lecaine Bob Dillabough Joe Daley Les Binkley\n\nGP 76 76 70 76 71 74 62 71 49 40 54 73 66 41 62 25 30 19 34 18 4 18 8 9 12 17 17 1 4 14 29 50\n\nG 18 13 25 16 17 12 10 9 15 8 7 2 10 5 5 7 3 1 1 0 3 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 34 38 23 25 20 17 19 20 11 15 13 18 8 13 13 6 10 6 4 5 1 4 1 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nPTS 52 51 48 41 37 29 29 29 26 23 20 20 18 18 18 13 13 7 5 5 4 4 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nPM 18 22 42 41 36 2 17 62 14 4 8 61 4 26 81 2 24 28 27 34 6 35 8 0 14 35 14 0 0 2 2 0\n\n+/- 39 -9 - 23 -4 - 21 - 25 - 21 - 26 0 - 17 - 18 - 30 - 32 -6 - 35 - 10 - 13 -4 - 16 6 4 - 11 -2 -1 -2 - 14 -8 0 0 -6 0 0\n\nMarv Edwards Joe Daley Les Binkley\n\nGP MlNS GA 1 60 3 29 1615 87 50 2885 158 76 4560 252\n\nSH AVG W L 0 3.00 0 1 2 3.23 10 13 0 3.29 10 31 2 3.32 20 45\n\nT 0 3 8 11\n\n1969–70 Record: 26–38–12 Points: 64 Goals For: 182 Goals Against: 238 Finish: Second (West) Coach: Red Kelly General Manager: Jack Riley The Penguins continued to make changes during the offseason. Sullivan was replaced behind the bench by another redhead, Leonard “Red” Kelly. A former Hall of Fame\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 4\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\nplayer and a member of eight Stanley Cup championship teams, Kelly had guided the Los Angeles Kings into the playoffs the previous two seasons. On the ice, Jack Riley gave the team a major overhaul. He claimed former All-Star winger Dean Prentice and bolstered the lineup with tough forwards Glen “Slats” Sather and Bryan Hextall. In a big trade with St. Louis, the Penguins GM swapped Angotti for hardworking center Ron Schock. To help Binkley in goal, he plucked colorful Al Smith from Toronto. The best addition came through the Amateur Draft. On the recommendation of Quebec scout Dick Coss, the Penguins selected a small center of French Canadian heritage named Michel Briere. Although reed thin, he was a smooth skater, a wonderful playmaker, and a fierce competitor. Briere blossomed into the team’s best player, finishing third on the club in scoring while leading the way with 32 assists. An intriguing team to say the least, the Penguins averaged barely two goals per game and were shutout a whopping 14 times. But they employed a scrappy, defensive style that earned them the nickname “Pesky Pens.” The ringleader was Watson, who was establishing himself as one of the toughest players in the league while piling up 189 penalty minutes. Sather, a terrific agitator, and big Tracy Pratt also joined the “century club.” The Pens had some talent to go with the toughness. Prentice made Riley look like a genius by leading the club with 26 goals and 51 points. Schinkel finished second in the team scoring race with 45 points, including 20 goals. Pronovost reached the 20-goal plateau as a sophomore while teaming up with Briere and Val Fonteyne on the speedy “Jet Line.” Defenseman Bob Woytowich—a favorite of the team’s Polish fans—tallied 33 points and was named to the West Division All-Star team. Despite the mixture of muscle and ability, the Penguins started slowly. The turning point came on January 31 during a contest with the division-leading St. Louis Blues. Like the Pens, the Blues’ lineup bristled with rugged skaters, including the notorious Plager brothers, Barclay and Bob.\n\nWoyto’s Polish Army Defenseman Bob Woytowich wasn’t the most talented player to ever don a Penguins jersey. He did, however, have something in common with Western Pennsylvania’s most celebrated athlete, golf great Arnold Palmer. He had an Army of his own. After discovering Woytowich was of Polish descent, Tom Niemiec began to organize the Polish Army. Its ranks soon swelled to nearly 70 full-fledged members and hundreds of sympathizers. The Army camped in the cheap seats, up near the Civic Arena roof. On Saturday nights in the late 1960s and early 1970s they often filled an entire section.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 5\n\n5\n\nGoaltender Les Binkley starred for the Pens from 1967 to 1972.\n\nEarly in the second period Barclay Plager jousted with Watson. Later in the frame the St. Louis bad boy took another run at the spunky Penguins defenseman. This time Sather intervened before Plager could reach his intended target, so they dropped their sticks and gloves and started swinging. As the battle intensified, Tracy Pratt led a charge off the Penguins’ bench, and Bob Plager and the Blues followed suit. When order was finally restored the Pens triumphed 2–1. Afterward, Sather drew the ire of Blues coach Scotty Bowman for his part in the melee. “He [Sather] couldn’t lick his lips,” Bowman fumed. “He’s all mouth. What a little [expletive].” The Penguins had a different reaction. Ignited by the big win, they reeled off nine victories in their next 14 games to catapult into second place. Although they cooled in March, the Pens earned their first-ever berth in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. For his superb coaching job, Kelly was named Coach of the Year by the Hockey News. Following the playoffs, he was appointed to the dual role of coach and general manager. Jack Riley was promoted to club president. Despite its origins, one didn’t have to be Polish to join the Army. The entry requirements were simple: prospective members were required to purchase a general admission ticket and root like crazy for Woytowich and the Penguins. Under no circumstances was a member allowed to say anything complimentary about the opposing team. According to John Patterson of the Pittsburgh Press, the Army even had scripted cheers. For example, Bobby Hull and his Chicago teammates were serenaded by the following diddie: “Clap your hands/Stomp your feet/Chicago Black Hawks have flat feet.”\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n6\n\nTotal Penguins\n\nDean Prentice Ken Schinkel Michel Briere Jean Pronovost Bob Woytowich Bryan Hextall Ron Schock Keith McCreary Glen Sather Val Fonteyne Wally Boyer Nick Harbaruk Jim Morrison Duane Rupp Tracy Pratt Bob Blackburn Bryan Watson Mike McMahon Rick Kessell Ron Snell George Swarbrick Les Binkley Joe Daley Dunc McCallum Al Smith\n\nGP 75 72 76 72 68 66 76 60 76 68 72 74 59 64 65 60 61 12 8 3 12 27 9 14 46\n\nG 26 20 12 20 8 12 8 18 12 11 11 5 5 2 5 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 25 25 32 21 25 19 21 8 14 15 12 17 15 14 7 7 9 3 2 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nPTS 51 45 44 41 33 31 29 26 26 26 23 22 20 16 12 11 10 4 3 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nPM 14 19 20 45 49 87 40 67 114 2 34 56 40 18 124 51 189 19 0 0 8 0 0 16 20\n\n+/- 20 - 26 - 15 -2 - 12 - 22 -7 -6 - 13 -4 -5 -7 - 20 - 11 - 29 - 14 -1 2 0 -2 0 0 0 -4 0\n\nJoe Daley Al Smith Les Binkley\n\nGP MlNS GA 9 528 26 46 2555 129 27 1477 79 76 4560 238\n\nSH AVG W L T 0 2.95 1 5 3 2 3.03 15 20 8 3 3.21 10 13 1 5 3.13 26 38 12\n\n1970–71\n\ncoma for seven weeks, he spent much of the next year in a twilight condition, alternating between consciousness and unconsciousness. His loss would have a devastating effect on the team. Stunned by the horrendous twist of fate, the club made few moves over the off-season. The only significant additions were first-round draft pick Greg Polis, a high-scoring left wing, and Andy Bathgate, who returned after a two-year hiatus. In December the team absorbed yet another cruel blow when owner Donald Parsons announced that he could no longer pay his debts. The league assumed control of the troubled franchise for the remainder of the season. On the ice, the Penguins plodded into the new year tied for fourth place. As if the team hadn’t been plagued by enough misfortune, McCreary, Rupp, Schinkel, and Watson were felled by injuries within the span of a week. Remarkably, the club responded with a superb effort over the next month to move into a tie for third place. However, the wear and tear of playing without so many key performers eventually took its toll. In a dismal finish, the Penguins won only three of their last 23 games and subsided to sixth. They were a terrible team away from the Civic Arena, winning just three road games all season long. Still, the club made some progress, most notably through a savvy trade Riley engineered with New York GM Emile Francis. Desperate for muscle, the Rangers shipped promising youngsters Syl Apps and Sheldon Kannegiesser to Pittsburgh for Glen Sather, who was arguably the team’s most popular player. At the time of the deal Apps had scored only one goal in 31 games, while Kannegiesser was playing defense for the Rangers’ farm team in Omaha. The swap was derided by the Penguins faithful, who hung a banner at the Civic Arena imploring “Why Slats?” Apps quickly silenced the critics. In his first game as a Penguin he scored a spectacular breakaway goal against\n\nRecord: 21–37–20 Points: 62 Goals For: 221 Goals Against: 240 Finish: Sixth (West) Coach: Red Kelly General Manager: Red Kelly On May 15, 1970, fate intervened and dealt the Penguins a crushing blow. While driving with two friends on a rainy evening near his hometown of Malartic, Quebec, Michel Briere was involved in a terrible automobile accident. When emergency crews arrived on the scene, they found him lying unconscious a short distance from the car. Although he had been thrown from the vehicle, there wasn’t a mark on him. While he showed no obvious signs of injury, Briere had suffered brain damage in the accident. After lapsing into a\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 6\n\nCoach Red Kelly makes a point with newcomers (left to right) John Stewart, Lowell MacDonald, and Greg Polis.\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\nToronto’s legendary netminder, Jacques Plante. The gifted young center went on to register nine goals and 16 assists in 31 games. After undergoing a series of operations to relieve pressure on his brain, Michel Briere passed away from his injuries on April 13, 1971. To honor their fallen teammate, his number 21 was retired, never to be worn again. “His death left a big hole on the club,” Red Kelly said. “We just couldn’t fill it.” Bryan Hextall Jean Pronovost Andy Bathgate Wally Boyer Ron Schock Dean Prentice Ken Schinkel Keith McCreary Greg Polis Duane Rupp Dunc McCallum Bob Woytowich Nick Harbaruk Syl Apps Rod Zaine Val Fonteyne Glen Sather Jim Morrison Bob Blackburn Bryan Watson John Stewart Robin Burns Yvon Labre Rick Kessell Sheldon Kannegiesser Steve Cardwell Lowell MacDonald Paul Hoganson Cam Newton Les Binkley Al Smith\n\nGP 76 78 76 68 71 69 50 59 61 59 77 78 78 31 37 70 46 73 64 43 15 10 21 6 18 5 10 2 5 34 46\n\nG 16 21 15 11 14 21 15 21 18 5 9 4 13 9 8 4 8 0 4 2 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 32 24 29 30 26 17 19 12 15 28 20 22 12 16 5 9 3 10 5 6 1 3 1 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nPTS 48 45 44 41 40 38 34 33 33 33 29 26 25 25 13 13 11 10 9 8 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nPM 133 35 34 30 20 18 6 24 40 34 95 30 108 21 21 0 96 32 54 119 9 4 19 2 29 15 0 0 4 0 41\n\n+/- 23 8 - 11 10 2 -8 - 19 7 -6 - 10 - 13 8 -9 3 -8 -8 0 - 12 0 -5 -9 1 2 1 -9 -4 -6 0 0 0 0\n\nLes Binkley Al Smith Cam Newton Paul Hoganson\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 7\n\nGP MlNS 34 1870 46 2472 5 281 2 57 78 4680\n\nGA 89 128 16 7 240\n\nSH AVG W L T 2 2.86 11 11 10 2 3.11 9 22 9 0 3.42 1 3 1 0 7.37 0 1 0 4 3.08 21 37 20\n\n7\n\n1971–72 Record: 26–38–14 Points: 66 Goals For: 220 Goals Against: 258 Finish: Fourth (West) Coach: Red Kelly General Manager: Red Kelly–Jack Riley As the memory of the bitter 1970–71 season faded away, the Penguins began to rebuild. The club was purchased by a group of Pittsburgh investors headed by Thayer “Tad” Potter, Peter Burchfield, Elmore Keener, and former club secretary Peter Block. The new owners immediately gave Red Kelly a vote of confidence, signing him to a lucrative five-year contract with an annual salary of $50,000. Believing a youth movement was in order, Kelly replaced many of his grizzled veterans with fresh legs. This was particularly evident on defense, where he made sweeping changes. He plucked 22-year-old Dave Burrows from Chicago in the Intra-League Draft and promoted promising youngsters Kannegiesser and Darryl Edestrand from Hershey. Twentyyear-old Joe Noris, the club’s second pick in the Amateur Draft, also made the squad. To serve as unofficial playing coach for his kiddie corps of defensemen, Kelly claimed Tim Horton, a former teammate on Toronto’s great Stanley Cup champions. Although 41 years old, Horton had long been regarded as one of the strongest players in the league. The perennial All-Star was just the man to provide on-ice instruction and leadership for his youthful teammates. Kelly continued to shuffle the deck by claiming speedy young center Rene Robert in the Intra-League Draft. When the Red Wings selected hard-luck Al Smith, he snapped up 22-year-old goalie Jim Rutherford. Buoyed by the infusion of new blood, the Penguins won five of their first six games, including a club-record three straight on the road. However, Horton sustained a broken ankle and the young defensive corps struggled during his absence. The Pens soon fell back into the pack. They spent most of the season chasing St. Louis and Philadelphia for the final playoff spot. As the season wore on, Kelly began to rely more heavily on his veterans. Horton returned to the lineup at midseason, and steady Duane Rupp was recalled from Hershey. Jack Riley reassumed the GM duties in January and promptly dealt Robert to Buffalo for another former teammate of Kelly’s, winger Eddie Shack. With the defense stabilized and the rugged Shack providing a much-needed spark, the Penguins rallied sharply down the homestretch, compiling a 5–1–5 record in their last 11 games.\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n8\n\nTotal Penguins\n\nKeith McCreary is bloodied but unbowed after a battle with Vancouver’s John Schella.\n\nThe chase for the fourth and final playoff spot came down to the final night of the season. Needing a victory over St. Louis coupled with a Philadelphia loss, the Pens rose to the occasion and clobbered the Blues at the Civic Arena 6–2. Meanwhile, at the Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo, the Flyers appeared to be skating to a tie with the Sabres. But with only four seconds left on the clock Gerry Meehan uncorked a 60-foot slap shot that sailed past Philly goaltender Doug Favell. Suddenly the Penguins were in the playoffs. There were many bright spots. The young line of Apps, Pronovost, and West Division All-Star Greg Polis developed into an offensive force. Pronovost and Polis set a club record with 30 goals apiece, while Apps established new highs for assists and points. Rugged Bryan Hextall reached the 20-goal plateau and continued to develop into a solid player. On defense, rookie Dave Burrows displayed the poise of a seasoned veteran. Bugsy Watson, as cantankerous as ever, led the league with 212 penalty minutes. Young Jim Rutherford emerged as the team’s goaltender of the future.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 8\n\nSyl Apps Jean Pronovost Greg Polis Ron Schock Ken Schinkel Bryan Hextall Darryl Edestrand Bob Leiter Nick Harbaruk Duane Rupp Bryan Watson Val Fonteyne Al McDonough Rene Robert Steve Cardwell Eddie Shack Dave Burrows Tim Horton John Stewart Keith McCreary Joe Noris Sheldon Kannegiesser Bob Woytowich Bill Hicke Brian McKenzie Wally Boyer Rick Kessell Roy Edwards Robin Burns Les Binkley Jim Rutherford\n\nGP 72 68 76 77 74 78 77 78 78 34 75 68 37 49 28 18 77 44 25 33 35 54 31 12 6 1 3 15 5 31 40\n\nG 15 30 30 17 15 20 10 14 12 4 3 6 7 7 7 5 2 2 2 4 2 2 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 44 23 19 29 30 24 23 17 17 18 17 13 11 11 8 9 10 9 8 4 5 4 4 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nPTS 59 53 49 46 45 44 33 31 29 22 20 19 18 18 15 14 12 11 10 8 7 6 5 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nPM 78 12 38 22 8 126 52 18 46 32 212 0 8 42 18 12 48 40 23 22 20 47 8 6 4 0 0 0 8 2 16\n\n+/18 15 -4 - 10 - 10 - 26 - 12 - 25 - 13 0 5 -1 -6 - 11 0 5 -7 5 -6 - 10 -8 - 14 - 19 -6 -2 -1 -1 0 -4 0 0\n\nRoy Edwards Jim Rutherford Les Binkley\n\nGP MlNS GA 15 847 36 40 2160 116 31 1673 98 78 4680 258\n\nSH AVG W L T 0 2.55 2 8 4 1 3.22 17 15 5 0 3.51 7 15 5 1 3.31 26 38 14\n\n1972–73 Record: 32–37–9 Points: 73 Goals For: 257 Goals Against: 265 Finish: Fifth (West) Coach: Red Kelly–Ken Schinkel General Manager: Jack Riley Encouraged by the team’s progress, Jack Riley continued to promote the Penguins’ youth movement.

The club boasted three solid forward lines and promising youngsters Burrows and Rutherford on defense and in goal. “They have spirit and drive, and can go as far as they want,” Kelly said. With strong production from their forwards, the Penguins got off to a quick start. On November 22, they erupted for the fastest five goals in NHL history en route to a 10–4 destruction of St. Louis. The Pens reached their peak on December 16 with a victory over Atlanta to gain sole possession of fourth place. Things began to sour when Jean Pronovost was forced from the lineup with a badly broken nose, upsetting the club’s delicate offensive balance. The team suffered through an eight-game winless streak, managing a paltry 16 goals during the slide. By the time the Pens snapped out of the doldrums with a victory over Chicago, Red Kelly’s job was in jeopardy. In January Riley replaced him with Ken Schinkel, who promptly retired as the team’s all-time leading scorer to take over the helm. Under Schinkel the Penguins bobbed along at a .500 clip. The club had its best season to date, posting a 32–37–9 mark, but failed to qualify for the playoffs by three points.\n\n9\n\nSinging the Blues While the 1972–73 Penguins weren’t the most talented bunch in franchise history, they did possess some firepower. On the night of November 22, 1972, they put it on display against archrival St. Louis before a hometown crowd at the Civic Arena. The eruption began innocently enough, when Bryan Hextall struck for a power-play goal at the 12-minute mark of the third period. Eighteen seconds later, Jean Pronovost beat Blues goalie Wayne Stephenson again.

He was complemented beautifully by a pair of former Los Angeles Kings, Al McDonough and Lowell MacDonald. Nicknamed “the Mad Hatter” for his penchant for scoring hat tricks, McDonough set a new club standard with 35 goals. MacDonald enjoyed a truly remarkable season. He scored 34 goals and led the team with a sterling plus/minus rating of plus 37. The fact that the 31-year-old was still playing was a testimony to his grit and determination. The soft-spoken veteran had missed nearly two full seasons while recuperating from knee surgery, a dark art at best in the days before arthroscopic procedures. It was only fitting that he was awarded the Masterton Trophy for his Lazarus-like performance.

Several youngsters were being counted on to make an impact, including top picks Blaine Stoughton and Wayne Bianchin. The club also had high hopes for Jim Wiley, a big free-agent center who had produced well at Hershey, and Ron Jones, a defenseman culled from the Bruins in the Intra-League Draft. Although Bryan Watson was still, pound for pound, one of the toughest players in the league, the Pens had been intimidated the previous season by big, physical teams like Philadelphia, Boston, and St. Louis. The tone was set in a preseason game against the Blues. Early in the contest Bob Plager chopped down Bianchin. A full-scale brawl erupted in the second period when Barclay Plager attacked Watson in the penalty box. At one point Bugsy fended off Plager and several other Blues while big Steve Durbano, who had just beaten the daylights out of Watson in a lopsided fight, threatened to vault the Plexiglas partition that separated the penalty boxes. Across the way, Bryan Hextall could see that Watson was in big trouble. He motioned to the Penguins’ bench for help. No one budged. Finally, Hextall charged across the ice to rescue his teammate. He was intercepted and pummeled by one of the Blues. Emasculated by St. Louis, the Penguins began the season in a tailspin. Their reputation as the 98-pound weaklings of the league was well deserved.

But by far the most colorful was goaltender Andy Brown. A journeyman of modest abilities, Brown had the distinction of being the last NHL goalie to play without a mask. Perhaps as a way of protecting his exposed mug, he became proficient at using his big goaltender’s blade as a deterrent, whacking and hacking his way to 60 penalty minutes—a league record for netminders. During a late-season contest against Chicago, the combative Brown took a huge swipe at Black Hawks defenseman Phil Russell. Fortunately, the rugged rearguard’s self-preservation instincts took over. He ducked out of harm’s way in the nick of time, saving him from becoming an on-ice version of the Headless Horseman.\n\nFeisty Andy Brown was the last goalie in the NHL to play without a mask.\n\nBrown’s taste for danger wasn’t confined to the hockey rink.

So few of the players seemed to be putting forth an effort that one rival general manager suggested that Riley and Schinkel check jerseys to see who was breaking a sweat. The Pens plummeted toward the bottom of the standings. Riley seemed genuinely stunned by the team’s poor showing. Despite the club’s terrible start, MacDonald, McDonough, and Burrows were named to the West Division All-Star team. Apps, Pronovost, and Polis were All-Star-caliber players. It was an impressive array of talent for a next-to-last place team. Early in the new year the Penguins’ GM finally made a bold move. He traded the club’s leading scorer, Al McDonough, to the Atlanta Flames for forward Chuck Arnason and defenseman Bob Paradise. The trade didn’t have much impact. Paradise was big, strong, and tough as nails, but he wasn’t a policeman. While Arnason displayed a blistering shot, he had difficulty getting it on net. The club continued to sag. Time finally ran out on Jack Riley. On January 13 owner Tad Potter accepted his resignation and promoted director of player personnel Jack Button. Four days later Potter worked out a blockbuster fiveplayer trade with St. Louis. He shipped Polis, Watson, and a second-round draft pick to the Blues for Steve Durbano, left wing Bob “Battleship” Kelly, and defenseman Ab DeMarco. Hours after the big trade with St. Louis, Button swung his first deal, sending Rutherford and Jack Lynch to Detroit for giant defenseman Ron Stackhouse. The shake-up had a dramatic effect on the team. Standing 6'1\" and weighing 210 pounds, the 22-year-old\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 11\n\nDurbano was a larger-than-life character straight from the movie Slap Shot. Aptly described by a local sportswriter as a “hard fist of a defenseman,” his appetite for mayhem had already reached legendary proportions. While skating for the Rangers’ top farm team in Omaha in 1971–72 he set a professional hockey record with an astronomical 402 penalty minutes. Hockey fans in London, Ontario, still spoke with disbelief about the night Durbano had speared three of their star players on the opening shift of a playoff game. The bluster of his physical play obscured the fact that Durbano was a talented defenseman. His heavy shot and surprisingly soft hands made him an ideal point man on the power play. Like Durbano, Kelly was coveted for his muscle. After all, he wasn’t nicknamed “Battleship” for nothing. The tall, rangy winger had earned a reputation as one of the most fearsome fighters in hockey. His victims included Philly’s notorious bad man, Dave “the Hammer” Schultz. It was as if Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterton had suddenly ridden into town. With Durbano and Kelly riding shotgun, the Penguins’ skill players flourished once more. During a 6–2 triumph over Vancouver, Durbano scored the first goal of the game and broke Dave Dunn’s nose with a roundhouse right. Next, the Pens visited Philadelphia to take on the pugnacious Flyers. Prior to the game, Kelly was interviewed on camera by a local sportscaster. “You can play this interview in their locker room,” Kelly said. “I don’t care. I’m not afraid of anyone.” The Penguins won 5–3.\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n12\n\nTotal Penguins\n\nWhen the team began to sputter again, Button reassigned Schinkel and promoted Marc Boileau, who was coaching the club’s International League affiliate at Fort Wayne. Nicknamed “Popeye” for his fiery nature, Boileau had no NHL coaching experience. However, the Pens jelled under his leadership, compiling a 14–10–4 mark down the homestretch. They had fallen too far behind to make the playoffs. But they had transformed from one of the worst teams in the division into one of the best by season’s end.

Realizing the Penguins relied too heavily on the “Century Line” of Apps, MacDonald, and Pronovost, he made two major trades over the summer to add some offensive punch. First, he took advantage of a fire sale by the Rangers and landed onetime 50-goal scorer Vic Hadfield. Then he acquired young sniper Rick Kehoe from Toronto for talented but unproven Blaine Stoughton. The Pens bolstered their offense even further by selecting 19-year-old center Pierre Larouche with their first pick in the Amateur Draft. Small and shifty, the enormously gifted Larouche had tallied 94 goals and 251 points the previous season with Sorel of the Quebec League. On defense Button added a pair of rugged rookies, Colin “Soupy” Campbell and hard-hitting Dennis Owchar. Steel City fans were buzzing about the team’s chances as the much-improved Penguins opened the season with a 4–2 victory over Minnesota. But after clobbering Detroit in their home opener, the Pens fell to defending Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia. As if losing to the hated Flyers wasn’t bad enough, Steve Durbano shattered his left wrist in a collision with Andre Dupont. At first he was expected to miss only six weeks, but the injury was career-threatening. It would take several surgeries to repair the damage. With Durbano on the shelf, weaknesses in the Penguins’ defense were quickly exposed. In November Button shipped Ab DeMarco to Vancouver for veteran Barry Wilkins, a tough, steady rearguard. Owchar, who was aptly nicknamed “Owch,” replaced Jean-Guy Lagace and responded with a slew of thundering hits. Lagace was sent to Kansas City for Michel Plasse, a solid backup goalie. Plasse’s presence lit a fire under incumbent Gary Inness, who performed brilliantly in the second half of the season. Rejuvenated by the trades, the team finally began to jell during a five-game home stand over the holidays. Following ties with St. Louis and Atlanta, the Pens heated up with consecutive victories over Toronto, Minnesota, and Vancouver. They were even better in the new year. Paced by a record-tying six-assist performance by Ron Stackhouse, the Penguins thrashed the Flyers 8–2 on March 8. They rode a 20-game unbeaten streak on home ice to a third-place finish in the newly formed Norris Division. Boasting three strong lines, the team was an offensive juggernaut. The Pens lit the lamp a whopping 326 times—the\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\n13\n\nwatering holes. They constantly teased him about his age. In the war of words the fresh-faced rookie gave as good as he got. During one such exchange Lucky Pierre needled elder statesman Vic Hadfield: “When I was a little kid, Vic, I used to watch you on television.” The stage was set for a strong postseason run. But after sweeping aside archrival St. Louis in the Preliminary Round, the Penguins suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the upstart New York Islanders. The disappointing loss undermined the team’s fragile finances. In June, principal owner Tad Potter was forced to enter into receivership. Pete Laframboise and Jean Pronovost hunt for the puck while Montreal goalie Ken Dryden scrambles back to the net. Future Pen Don Awrey is tending goal.\n\nfourth-highest total in the league. Nine players topped the 20-goal mark. The Century Line combined for 94 goals, including a team-leading 43 by Pronovost. The second unit of Hadfield, Kehoe, and Ron Schock was nearly as potent, scoring 86 times. Perhaps the most pleasant surprise was the play of the third line, which featured Larouche skating between Battleship Kelly and Chuck Arnason. Oozing charisma and extremely popular with the fans, “Lucky Pierre” set new team rookie scoring records with 31 goals, 37 assists, and 68 points. The 19-year-old Larouche became a talisman of sorts to his fun-loving teammates, who dragged him to their favorite\n\nLucky Pierre Even as a fresh-faced 19-year-old center straight from the junior ranks, Pierre Larouche didn’t lack for confidence. When the storied Montreal Canadiens promised to make him a first-round pick in the 1974 Entry Draft, Larouche told them not to bother. “If you draft me, you’ll send me right to the minor leagues,” he said. “I’m good enough to play in the NHL now. If you draft me, I’ll sign with the World Hockey Association.” Rebuffed, the Canadiens passed on Larouche. Penguins general manager Jack Button promptly snatched up the cocky youngster with the eighth overall pick. Days later Button received a telegram, which said: “You are invited to attend the first annual Pierre Larouche Invitational Golf Tournament in Amos, Quebec. Bring your own clubs. Pierre.”\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 13\n\nRon Schock Syl Apps Jean Pronovost Vic Hadfield Pierre Larouche Rick Kehoe Lowell MacDonald Ron Stackhouse Chuck Arnason Bob Kelly Barry Wilkins Colin Campbell Pete Laframboise Bob Paradise Dennis Owchar Dave Burrows Bob McManama Lew Morrison Nelson Debenedet Jean-Guy Lagace Kelly Pratt Ab DeMarco Ron Lalonde Gary lnness Mario Faubert Steve Durbano Michel Plasse Yves Bergeron Wayne Bianchin Denis Herron Bob Stumpf Harvey Bennett Bob Johnson\n\nGP 80 79 78 78 79 76 71 72 78 69 59 59 35 78 46 78 40 52 31 27 22 8 24 57 10 1 20 2 2 3 3 7 12\n\nG 23 24 43 31 31 32 27 15 26 27 5 4 5 3 6 2 5 7 6 1 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nGary lnness Michel Plasse Bob Johnson Denis Herron\n\nGP MlNS 57 3122 20 1094 12 476 3 108 80 4800\n\nA 63 55 32 42 37 31 33 45 32 24 29 15 13 15 11 15 9 5 3 8 6 1 3 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 GA 161 73 40 11 289\n\nPTS 86 79 75 73 68 63 60 60 58 51 34 19 18 18 17 17 14 12 9 9 6 3 3 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nPM 36 43 37 72 52 22 24 52 32 120 97 172 8 109 67 49 6 4 11 39 15 4 0 2 6 10 6 0 0 0 4 0 6\n\n+/22 8 13 5 2 18 16 13 0 6 29 28 3 -2 12 3 6 -5 -3 5 1 -4 1 0 -2 0 0 -3 -1 0 -4 -2 0\n\nSH AVG W L T 2 3.09 24 18 10 0 4.00 9 5 4 0 5.04 3 4 1 0 6.11 1 1 0 2 3.61 37 28 15\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n14\n\nTotal Penguins\n\n1975–76 Record: 35–33–12 Points: 82 Goals For: 339 Goals Against: 303 Finish: Third (Norris) Coach: Marc Boileau–Ken Schinkel General Manager: Wren Blair Despite the grim set of circumstances, the club was purchased within a month by a group headed by Albert Savill, Otto Frenzel, and former Minnesota GM Wren Blair for the bargain-basement price of $3.8 million. Blair assumed the dual role of president and general manager, which meant that Jack Button—one of the most capable executives in club history— was out of a job. Marc Boileau was retained as coach. While the new owners hardly had deep pockets, the financial situation was stabilized. Players and fans alike began to look forward to the upcoming season. The Penguins had loads of offensive talent. With the return of tough guy Steve Durbano, who had missed virtually the entire 1974–75 season with a severe wrist injury, some felt they might even be a dark-horse challenger for the Stanley Cup. It was not to be the Penguins’ year. After opening the season on a high note with four victories, they slipped into a 2–9–2 tailspin. The club briefly righted itself at the end of November with four straight wins, but it proved to be a last gasp. In December the Pens collapsed and fell into a deep slump. Although still an offensive powerhouse, the defense was atrocious and the transition game was in shambles. Blair pulled the trigger on several trades in an effort to shake the team out of the doldrums. He shipped Bob\n\nParadise and hulking Harvey Bennett to Washington for versatile forward Stan Gilbertson and a draft choice. Early in the new year Durbano and Chuck Arnason were sent packing to Kansas City for veteran winger Simon Nolet and youngster Ed Gilbert. While the trades added even more skill to a talent-laden lineup, they cost the team a huge chunk of muscle. It was a shortcoming that would quickly be exposed in the heyday of goon-squad hockey. Although Battleship Kelly was still a commanding presence, most opponents avoided him like the plague. When the club continued to sputter, Blair relieved Boileau of the coaching duties and handed the reins back to Ken Schinkel, who had remained in the organization as a scout. The team had logged a dismal 15–23–5 record under Boileau. Morale was at an all-time low. Under Schinkel’s steady hand the Pens began an immediate turnaround. They soon ran off an 11-game unbeaten streak, a club record that stood for 17 years. The hot streak propelled the team into the playoffs for the second year in a row. Despite the team’s Jekyll and Hyde play, it was a season filled with brilliant individual achievements. Second-year pro Pierre Larouche burst into stardom, becoming the youngest player in NHL history to score 50 goals. He finished fifth in the league scoring race and established club records with 53 goals and 111 points. Only slightly off Larouche’s torrid pace was Jean Pronovost, who also cracked the 100-point barrier. On March 24 “Prony” became the first player in franchise history to tally 50 goals. Silky smooth Syl Apps joined his teammates among the league’s top-10 scorers while establishing career highs with 32 goals, 67 assists, and 99 points. On the blue line, Ron Stackhouse and Dave Burrows were far and away the team’s top performers.

Burrows enjoyed the best season of his career with seven goals and 22 assists and a team-leading plus 27 rating. A mobile rearguard who could skate faster backward than most players could skate forward, Burrows was especially brilliant. Opponents who tried to go around him were cleanly but firmly ridden off the puck and into the boards. The quiet-tough defender was nearly impregnable to an inside move as well.

The move was very well received among the local fans and press. An old-school executive who had worked his way up through the ranks, Bastien was a folk hero of sorts in Pittsburgh. Once a promising young goaltender, he’d lost an eye while playing for the Hornets, which served to cement his popularity with the hardscrabble, steel-working Pittsburgh fans. After becoming the club’s coach in 1966, he led the Hornets to a Calder Cup title. The team’s top priority in the off-season was to shore up the porous defense. The Pens obtained seasoned pro Don Awrey from Montreal and added a strapping Americanborn rookie from the University of Minnesota named Russ Anderson. Blair also made wholesale changes in goal. In a savvy move he signed free agent Denis Herron, who had played brilliantly for a terrible Kansas City team, while shipping spare parts Campbell, Nolet, and Plasse to the Scouts as compensation. The club had one of its finest Amateur Drafts in 1976. Blair had shrewdly exchanged first-round draft positions in his deal with Kansas City the year before. With the second choice overall he selected Saskatoon Blades scoring ace Blair Chapman, a sharp-shooting right wing who was universally hailed as an impact player. The Penguins followed up by grabbing husky center Greg Malone. In the third round they chose Morris Lukowich, a tough, speedy little winger from Medicine Hat who would prove to be the best of the bunch. Unfortunately the bidding war with the fledgling World Hockey Association had reached its zenith. Operating on a shoestring budget, Blair couldn’t come to terms with Lukowich, who went on to score a whopping 65 goals in 1978–79 as a member of the Winnipeg Jets. With Chapman and Malone adding fresh legs up front, the Penguins blasted Vancouver in the season opener. The victory came with a steep price, however, as Herron went down with a broken arm. The plan to use unproven Gordie Laxton in goal lasted one game—a 10–1 shellacking at the hands of Montreal. Desperate to plug the dyke, Blair scurried to find an experienced netminder.

Misfortune continued to dog the Pens through the early going as top scorers Hadfield and MacDonald were felled by injuries. The situation grew worse in November when the team’s brass suspended Larouche for two games for a myriad of sins. Everyone involved tried to downplay the suspension. “I don’t know why the press made such a big deal of it,” coach Ken Schinkel said. But it was a harbinger of things to come. With so many key performers either hobbled or on the shelf, the team’s production plummeted. Gone were the days of fire-wagon hockey and 6–5 victories. To his credit, Schinkel encouraged a more defensive style of play and the Pens pared down their goals against. It was a stunning reversal of form for a team that had been such an offensive force. Still, defensive hockey had its merits. For the third year in a row, the Penguins placed third in the Norris Division to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 16\n\nJean Pronovost Pierre Larouche Syl Apps Rick Kehoe Ron Schock Mike Corrigan Ron Stackhouse Greg Malone Blair Chapman Wayne Bianchin Bob Kelly Dennis Owchar Stan Gilbertson Mario Faubert Russ Anderson Don Awrey Dave Burrows Lew Morrison Ed Van lmpe Lowell MacDonald Tom Price Vic Hadfield Denis Herron Dunc Wilson Yves Bergeron Steve Lyon Gord Laxton Ed Gilbert\n\nGP 79 65 72 80 80 73 80 66 80 79 74 46 67 47 66 79 69 76 10 3 7 9 34 45 1 3 6 7\n\nG 33 29 18 30 17 14 7 18 14 28 10 5 6 2 2 1 3 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 31 34 43 27 32 27 34 19 23 6 21 18 9 11 11 12 6 1 3 1 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nPTS 64 63 61 57 49 41 41 37 37 34 31 23 15 13 13 13 9 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nPM 24 14 20 10 10 36 72 43 16 28 115 37 13 32 81 40 29 0 6 0 4 0 4 21 0 2 0 0\n\n+/8 - 10 2 -5 -6 - 13 11 3 - 12 -1 13 -7 -9 -4 5 -2 - 15 -6 -2 -1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 -3\n\nDenis Herron Dunc Wilson Gord Laxton\n\nGP MlNS GA 34 1920 94 45 2627 129 6 253 26 80 4800 252\n\nSH AVG W L T 1 2.94 15 11 5 5 2.95 18 19 8 0 6.17 1 3 0 6 3.15 34 33 13\n\n1977–78 Record: 25–37–18 Points: 68 Goals For: 254 Goals Against: 321 Finish: Fourth (Norris) Coach: Johnny Wilson General Manager: Baz Bastien With the near miss against the Islanders and disappointing opening-round losses to Toronto as a backdrop, the aging Penguins were ripe for a retooling. The rebuilding effort would be led by Baz Bastien, who had been promoted to the post of general manager.\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\n17\n\nThe Penguins and the Black Hawks brawl. Russ Anderson is at the center of the melee.\n\nIn terms of management style, Bastien operated in much the same manner as Raymond “Buddy” Parker, the impulsive Pittsburgh Steelers coach of the late 1950s and early ’60s. Parker, a fiery Texan who won a pair of NFL championships with the Detroit Lions, was a free-wheeling sort who traded draft picks for veterans at the drop of a hat. Like Parker, Bastien was a master of the short-term fix. He also had little regard for the Amateur Draft, a point that was driven home in his first major trade. The new Penguins GM astounded the hockey world by dealing the club’s first pick in the 1979 draft to Washington for Hartland Monahan, a rather ordinary checking forward who was coming off a career year. Monahan would play all of seven games with the team before he, too, was traded away. Bastien faced some daunting challenges. Veteran Vic Hadfield had retired and penalty-killing ace Stan Gilbertson tragically lost a leg in an automobile accident. Thirty-sixyear-old Lowell MacDonald was a huge question mark as well—he had suffered yet another career-threatening injury. Other key departures included free agents Battleship Kelly and Don Awrey.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 17\n\nPierre Larouche was clearly unhappy in Pittsburgh. He postured throughout the summer for a trade. To Bastien’s credit, he lined up a beauty with the Cleveland Barons that would have netted high-scoring center Dennis Maruk and hard-nosed winger Al MacAdam. Unwilling to play for a franchise that was struggling even more than the Penguins, Larouche killed the deal by invoking a no-trade clause in his contract. Unfazed, Bastien continued to reshape the team. In an effort to add some muscle and spirit he reacquired rugged Bob Paradise and shipped aging captain Ron Schock to Buffalo for rambunctious winger Brian “Spinner” Spencer. Scrappy Colin Campbell rejoined the team after spending a season with Colorado. Hoping to instill a sense of discipline, Bastien promoted Ken Schinkel to director of player personnel and brought in his old friend and former coach with the Rockies, NHL iron man Johnny Wilson. It was anything but a match made in heaven. Predictably, the Penguins slogged out of the starting gate. Dismayed by his team’s dismal showing, Al Savill sought out\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n18\n\nTotal Penguins\n\nthe opinion of ex-Bruins star Derek Sanderson at a party. Sanderson, who staged a brief and unsuccessful comeback with the Penguins later in the season, advised Savill that the club lacked aggression. “You have no real big, tough guy,” the former Boston bad boy said. “You should get Dave Schultz. You’ve got a lot of right-handed center-men. Get rid of one of your centers.” The Penguins did just that. In a stunning trade, Bastien shipped popular but declining Syl Apps and the recently acquired Monahan to the Los Angeles Kings for Schultz and center Gene Carr. “The Hammer” lived up to his press clippings. Although no longer the NHL’s undisputed heavyweight champ, he dropped the mitts a whopping 20 times. Meanwhile, Carr added some dash and color to the mix with his blazing speed. Bastien soon followed up with a second blockbuster deal. He sent Larouche, who had become a cancer in the locker room, to Montreal for hulking center Pete Mahovlich and prospect Peter Lee. Bastien was well acquainted with Mahovlich, who had briefly played for the old Hornets. Lee was a speedy little winger who scored 81 goals in his final year of junior hockey. While it was debatable whether the trades made the club better, it certainly gave the team more heart and spirit. Backed by Schultz’s bare-knuckled, brawling style, the Pens began to hustle and hit. The newcomers made significant contributions. Mahovlich averaged better than a point per game and electrified the fans with his patented end-to-end rushes. Carr and Tom Edur—nicknamed “the Gold Dust Twins” for their flowing blond locks—gave the club a pair of competent point men on the power play. Lee didn’t score many goals, but he endeared himself to teammates and fans with his diligent play. The Penguins gradually closed in on the .500 mark and entered March a scant two points behind second-place Los Angeles. Just as they appeared to be gathering momentum, the wheels fell off the wagon. They collapsed down the homestretch, winning just five of 20 games. There were few individual performances of note. Once again, Pronovost paced the attack with 40 goals and 65 points, while Kehoe, Chapman, and Wayne Bianchin reached the 20-goal mark. Mahovlich gave a great effort, at times trying to lift the team into the playoffs single-handed. Fortunately, the team’s fragile finances received a considerable boost when Edward DeBartolo Sr. took control. DeBartolo, who amassed a fortune through his construction and real estate ventures, would provide the Penguins with the stable ownership they had always lacked.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 18\n\nJean Pronovost Pete Mahovlich Greg Malone Gene Carr Rick Kehoe Blair Chapman Tom Edur Dave Schultz Wayne Bianchin Brian Spencer Mike Corrigan Ron Stackhouse Dave Burrows Peter Lee Russ Anderson Lowell MacDonald John Flesch Bob Paradise Pierre Larouche Dennis Owchar Colin Campbell Tom Cassidy Syl Apps Jim Hamilton Mario Faubert Derek Sanderson Jacques Cossette Hartland Monahan Lew Morrison Dunc Wilson Denis Herron Kim Davis Greg Redquest Gord Laxton Tom Price\n\nGP 79 57 78 70 70 75 58 66 61 79 25 50 67 60 74 19 29 64 20 22 55 26 9 25 18 13 19 7 8 21 60 1 1 2 10\n\nG 40 25 18 17 29 24 5 9 20 9 8 5 4 5 2 5 7 2 6 2 1 3 0 2 0 3 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 25 36 43 37 21 20 38 25 13 11 12 15 15 13 16 8 5 10 5 8 9 4 7 4 6 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nPTS 65 61 61 54 50 44 43 34 33 20 20 20 19 18 18 13 12 12 11 10 10 7 7 6 6 4 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nPM 50 37 80 76 10 37 18 378 40 81 10 36 24 19 150 2 19 53 0 23 103 15 0 2 11 0 4 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\n+/- 16 4 - 16 - 15 - 18 - 11 -9 -9 - 14 - 18 -7 - 16 - 30 - 11 -5 0 -7 - 30 - 13 - 12 - 19 -4 0 -3 2 -6 -5 -7 3 0 0 0 0 0 -4\n\nDenis Herron Dunc Wilson Gord Laxton Greg Redquest\n\nGP MlNS 60 3534 21 1180 2 73 1 13 80 4800\n\nGA 210 95 9 3 321\n\nSH AVG W L T 0 3.57 20 25 15 0 4.83 5 11 3 0 7.40 0 1 0 0 13.85 0 0 0 0 4.01 25 37 18\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\n1978–79 Record: 36–31–13 Points: 85 Goals For: 281 Goals Against: 279 Finish: Second (Norris) Coach: Johnny Wilson General Manager: Baz Bastien Baz Bastien faced a major rebuilding job in the off-season. Convinced that his team needed an infusion of new blood, he engineered a series of deals that were designed to instill a winning attitude. For the second year in a row Bastien traded away the Pens’ first-round draft choice. This time he received three proven veterans from the Flyers in return—Orest Kindrachuk, Ross Lonsberry, and Tom Bladon. In one of his best trades, he acquired speedy forward George Ferguson and husky young defenseman Randy Carlyle from Toronto in exchange for Dave Burrows. A few days into the season Bastien dealt yet another first-round pick to Montreal for left wing Rod Schutt. “I just got Schutt from Montreal,” he crowed to the press corps. Folklore has it that he believed he had acquired Steve Shutt, the brilliant left wing who’d scored 60 goals during the 1976–77 season. Although the club seemed to be headed in the right direction, Jean Pronovost was unwilling to endure another\n\n19\n\nrebuilding program. Bastien did his best to accommodate the club’s career scoring leader, sending him to Atlanta in a three-way deal that netted Gregg Sheppard, a badly needed center. Thanks to Bastien’s bold maneuvering, the Penguins were vastly improved. They started slowly, but caught fire in December and rambled through the month with a 9–2–4 record. The Pens capped off one of the most successful stretches in club history with a rousing come-from-behind victory over Detroit on New Year’s Eve. Trailing the Red Wings by four goals late in the second period, they struck for five straight goals, including the game winner by Randy Carlyle with just seven seconds remaining. The Pens continued to play solid hockey in the second half. The team finished with a record of 36–31–13, good for second place in the Norris Division and a slot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Youngsters Greg Malone and Peter Lee blossomed into 30-goal scorers—Malone in particular seemed destined for stardom. Newcomers Ferguson, Lonsberry, and Schutt each topped the 20-goal mark, as did holdover Rick Kehoe. Team captain Orest Kindrachuk played gritty, inspired hockey while providing sterling leadership. The club was tremendously improved on defense. Stackhouse rebounded to have a solid year. Randy Carlyle exceeded all expectations by scoring 13 goals and 47 points. Colin Campbell had his finest season and played particularly well down the homestretch. Bladon and Dale Tallon added much-needed experience and mobility at the blue line, while Russ Anderson supplied the muscle.\n\nEx-Flyers Ross Lonsberry and Orest Kindrachuk battle against their former team.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 19\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n20\n\nTotal Penguins\n\nBetween the pipes, Denis Herron and Greg Millen posted winning records and identical 3.37 goals-against averages.

Under the agreement hammered out between the rival leagues, the cream of the WHA crop—the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques, and Winnipeg Jets—joined the NHL. The merger came at a steep price for the former WHA teams. In addition to paying a $10 million entry fee, each club was allowed to protect only two skaters and two goalies. The rest of their players would be offered to the NHL teams that held their rights through a special “reclaim” draft. The new teams would then be restocked through an Expansion Draft.\n\nDenis Herron Greg Millen Gord Laxton\n\nGP MlNS 56 3208 28 1532 1 60 80 4800\n\nGA 180 86 8 279\n\nSH AVG W L T 0 3.37 22 19 12 2 3.37 14 11 1 0 8.00 0 1 0 2 3.49 36 31 13\n\nPens goalie Greg Millen keeps his eyes on the puck.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 20\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\nGroundhog Day In the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, comedian Bill Murray plays a weatherman who keeps reliving the same day. Fourteen years earlier the Penguins experienced a real-life “groundhog week” of their own. Beginning on December 8, 1979, the Pens played to four consecutive 3–3 ties over a seven-day stretch. Even more remarkably, three days prior to commencing the streak the Penguins skated to a 3–3 deadlock with Vancouver. Their eerie dance with déjà vu was suspended—but only temporarily—by a 5–3 victory over the Capitals on December 7. Murray’s movie character escapes his predicament by using the recurring day to improve himself. Alas, the Penguins had no such luck. They snapped their string of cookie-cutter ties with a dismal 4–1 loss to Quebec.\n\nBastien coveted Winnipeg’s high-scoring winger Morris Lukowich and Quebec’s Paul Baxter, a rugged defenseman. As fate would have it, they were among the players protected by their respective teams. The Penguins settled for Kim Clackson, a fierce blue-liner and onetime WHA penalty king. The club lost Wayne Bianchin and Colin Campbell along with the rights to Tom Edur. All three were claimed by Edmonton. Never satisfied with the return he’d gotten in the Larouche deal, Bastien swung his third major trade with the Canadiens in three years. This time he shipped starting goaltender Denis Herron to Montreal for unproven netminder Rob Holland and Pat Hughes—the man he’d wanted all along. The Penguins’ GM was ecstatic. He was convinced that the husky, blond-haired winger would become a star. He also believed that Gary McAdam, nicknamed “Wheels” for his blazing speed, would develop into a big-time offensive threat. The team performed remarkably well through the first half of the season. Early in the new year they beat the Islanders to gain sole possession of first place for the first time in franchise history. In an effort to reinforce the winning tradition established by Pittsburgh’s other big-league sports teams, the Penguins lobbied to change their colors from columbia blue, navy blue, and white to black and gold. The Boston Bruins, who also wore black and gold, immediately filed a protest. The league sided with the Penguins, citing that the original Pittsburgh entry—the Pirates—had sported the colors back in the 1920s. Although they were now birds of a different color, the Penguins weren’t a very good team. The club tumbled from\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 21\n\n21\n\nits lofty perch as injuries to Malone and Kindrachuk took away precious scoring and leadership. McAdam scored 18 goals by the end of December, but in a complete reversal of form tallied only one more the rest of the way. Mark Johnson, fresh from his heroic gold-medal performance in the Olympic Games, joined the club in February but failed to provide a spark. Johnny Wilson was exposed as an unimaginitive coach who relied too heavily on his veterans. By the end of the season the Pens had slipped to a record of 30–37–13, although it was good enough for third place in the mediocre Norris Division and a playoff berth.

Once again, his primary concern was shoring up the defensive corps, which was thinned by the losses of Tom Bladon and Dale Tallon to free agency. For the first time in years the Penguins had a first-round pick in the Entry Draft. They hoped to land speedy defenseman Paul Coffey, an offensive whiz. The Edmonton Oilers snatched up Coffey, so the Pens selected Brantford Alexander scoring ace Mike Bullard. Bastien also signed coveted free agent Paul Baxter, sending the gritty Kim Clackson to Quebec as compensation. To no one’s surprise, Johnny Wilson got the axe. Bastien replaced his old friend with former Chicago coach Eddie Johnston, who had guided the Black Hawks to the Smythe Division title. Johnston, a long-time Bruins mainstay, brought with him the blueprint for Boston’s imposing power play. Upon his arrival, “EJ” was shocked by the dearth of bigleague talent at his disposal.\n\n“When I first got here as coach, we only had 23 players on the roster,” he said. “Every guy at camp made the team. Our extra guy was a kid named Jim Hamilton.” The lack of depth would soon come back to haunt them. From the opening face-off the Penguins were beset by injuries. Key players Anderson, Baxter, Kindrachuk, and Sheppard went down in rapid-fire succession. When Mark Johnson suffered a hand injury to leave the club with just one healthy center, Bastien sprang to action. He acquired Paul Gardner and former Pen Dave Burrows from Toronto for youngsters Paul Marshall and Kim Davis. It was one of his finest trades. Gardner was a proven sniper who had scored 30 goals in each of his first three seasons. Although fading, Burrows still was a capable defender. Bastien continued to stir the pot. He dealt the unproductive McAdam to Detroit for Errol Thompson and acquired scrappy winger Gary Rissling from the Capitals. In March he sent struggling Pat Hughes to Edmonton for edgy defenseman Pat Price. After nearly tumbling into the cellar in mid-January, the club finally began to jell. Combative newcomers Price and Rissling added an aggression and fire that had been sorely lacking. Thanks to Johnston’s renewed emphasis on offense, the team boasted one of the league’s most dangerous power plays. “The only reason we made the playoffs that year was the power play,” Johnston would recall. “I used the pick play. I learned that from [Boston Celtics Hall of Famer] Tommy Heinsohn.” Several players enjoyed standout seasons. Utilizing his puck savvy and lightning-quick release to full advantage,\n\nRoss Lonsberry rips off a shot against Dave Parro while Pierre Bouchard (26) closes in.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 22\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\n23\n\nRick Kehoe exploded for a club-record 55 goals. Paul Gardner planted himself in the crease and collected garbage goals on rebounds and deflections, an approach that paid off handsomely. He racked up 34 goals and 74 points in just 62 games, while becoming the first Penguin ever to score four goals in one game. Among the rearguards, Randy Carlyle blossomed into a Norris Trophy winner. He finished second to Kehoe in scoring with 83 points and was the first Penguin ever named to the postseason All-Star team.\n\n1981–82\n\nRick Kehoe Randy Carlyle Paul Gardner Peter Lee Rod Schutt Mario Faubert Greg Malone Ross Lonsberry George Ferguson Ron Stackhouse Mark Johnson Gregg Sheppard Pat Hughes Paul Baxter Russ Anderson Errol Thompson Nick Libett Orest Kindrachuk Gary McAdam Pat Price Marc Chorney Jim Hamilton Paul Marshall Mike Bullard Dave Burrows Greg Millen Kim Davis Gary Rissling Bennett Wolf Gilles Lupien Tony Feltrin Nick Ricci Rob Holland\n\nBuoyed by an inspired effort against the Blues in the previous year’s playoffs, the Penguins were looking forward to the new season with high expectations. However, the league had realigned, placing them in the tough Patrick Division alongside the Islanders, Rangers, Flyers, and Capitals. The team would have to improve a great deal in order to keep pace with its new brethren. In one of the most highly publicized moves of the summer, the Hartford Whalers signed goaltender Greg Millen to a lucrative deal. Since the Penguins still held his rights, Hartford was required to compensate them. The Whalers offered two of their lesser lights, winger Jordy Douglas and veteran goalie John Garrett. Bastien and Johnston shrugged off the Whalers’ offer and boldly went for the jugular. They demanded left wing Pat Boutette—an 80-point scorer—and promising junior player Kevin McClelland. Arbitrator Joe Kane sided with the Penguins. To plug the pronounced gap in goal, Bastien inked lowprofile free agent Michel Dion to a deal. He added more muscle by acquiring giant winger Paul Mulvey from the Capitals for Orest Kindrachuk. Bastien had assembled the most physical Penguins team in years. Baxter, Price, and Anderson formed the hub of a rough and ready defense, while Mulvey, Boutette, and Rissling provided toughness up front. The club’s aggressive attitude was contagious. In a game against Quebec, gentle giant Ron Stackhouse shocked his teammates by instigating a fight with pugnacious Dale Hunter. With their new espirit de corps, the team played excellent hockey through the early going. Backed by the red-hot Dion, who electrified the fans with his acrobatic style, the Pens stormed through a 12-game stretch in November and early December at a 9–1–2 clip to close to within two points of the division-leading Islanders. When the team began to falter, Johnston and Bastien shuffled the lineup in an effort to rekindle the fire. However, most of their moves backfired. Anderson was shipped off to Hartford for former Flyers star Rick MacLeish, who was clearly on the downside of a distinguished career. Rookie Doug Shedden—a capable scorer—was sent to the minors\n\nGP 80 76 62 80 80 72 62 80 79 74 73 47 58 51 34 34 43 13 34 13 8 20 13 15 53 63 8 25 24 31 2 9 10\n\nG 55 16 34 30 25 8 21 17 25 6 10 11 10 5 3 6 6 3 3 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 33 67 40 34 35 44 29 33 18 29 23 17 9 14 14 8 6 9 9 10 6 6 0 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\nPTS 88 83 74 64 60 52 50 50 43 35 33 28 19 19 17 14 12 12 12 10 7 7 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nPM 6 136 59 86 55 118 68 76 42 86 50 49 161 204 112 12 4 34 30 33 14 18 4 19 28 6 4 143 94 34 0 2 0\n\n+/-9 - 16 -5 0 - 13 - 18 - 14 -3 - 30 - 11 4 - 13 -9 - 11 12 -9 2 3 - 16 2 1 2 -7 -1 - 13 0 -3 -4 -1 - 15 -3 0 0\n\nNick Ricci Greg Millen Rob Holland\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 23\n\nGP MlNS GA 9 540 35 63 3721 258 10 539 45 80 4800 345\n\nSH AVG W L T 0 3.89 4 5 0 0 4.16 25 27 10 0 5.01 1 5 3 0 4.31 30 37 13\n\nRecord: 31–36–13 Points: 75 Goals For: 310 Goals Against: 337 Finish: Fourth (Patrick) Coach: Eddie Johnston General Manager: Baz Bastien\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\n24\n\nTotal Penguins\n\nMichel Dion searches for the puck while Randy Carlyle (25) and Vancouver’s Dave “Tiger” Williams fight for position.\n\nto make room for MacLeish. Mulvey failed to pass through waivers and was claimed by the Kings. The club never regained its early momentum and chugged home in fourth place. The Pens did manage to finish the campaign on a mild upswing by going undefeated in their final five games. In the season finale they rolled to a 7–2 triumph over their first-round playoff opponent, the twotime Stanley Cup champion Islanders. Offensively, the team still possessed plenty of firepower. Rick Kehoe slipped a bit to 33 goals, but led the way with 85 points. Paul Gardner and rookie Mike Bullard paced the attack with 36 goals apiece. Feisty Pat Boutette tallied 23 goals and 74 points while serving 230 minutes in the sin bin. On the blue line, Randy Carlyle enjoyed another splendid season, piling up 11 goals and 64 assists. Paul Baxter registered 43 points while playing a tough, physical brand of defense. He and his partner, hot-tempered Pat Price, combined for an astounding total of 731 penalty minutes.\n\n01TP10_Down_Through_the_Season.indd 24\n\nRick Kehoe Randy Carlyle Pat Boutette Paul Gardner Mike Bullard George Ferguson Paul Baxter Greg Malone Pat Price Peter Lee Rick MacLeish Doug Shedden Gregg Sheppard Mark Johnson Rod Schutt Ron Stackhouse Bobby Simpson Steve Gatzos Pat Graham Andre St. Laurent Mario Faubert Greg Hotham Jim Hamilton Paul Mulvey Marc Chorney Kevin McClelland Randy Boyd Russ Anderson Michel Dion Dave Hannan Bennett Wolf Nick Ricci Tony Feltrin Gary Edwards Paul Harrison Gary Rissling\n\nGP 71 73 80 59 75 71 76 78 77 74 40 38 58 46 35 76 26 16 42 18 14 25 11 27 60 10 23 31 62 1 1 3 4 6 13 16\n\nG 33 11 23 36 36 22 9 15 7 18 13 10 11 10 9 2 9 6 6 8 4 4 5 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nA 52 64 51 33 27 31 34 24 31 16 12 15 10 11 12 19 9 8 8 5 8 6 3 7 6 4 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nPTS 85 75 74 69 63 53 43 39 38 34 25 25 21 21 21 21 18 14 14 13 12 10 8 8 7 5 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nPM 8 131 230 28 91 45 409 125 322 98 28 12 35 30 42 102 4 14 55 4 14 16 2 76 63 4 49 98 4 0 2 0 4 2 0 55\n\n+/- 27 - 16 - 23 -7 -1 -6 -9 - 24 2 -8 -7 -2 9 - 14 3 - 11 -3 0 -1 5 -2 -6 2 -7 - 11 6 -5 -4 0 -2 0 0 -3 0 0 -2\n\nGary Edwards Michel Dion Nick Ricci Paul Harrison\n\nGP MlNS GA 6 360 22 62 3580 226 3 160 14 13 700 64 80 4800 337\n\nSH AVG W L T 1 3.67 3 2 1 0 3.79 25 24 12 0 5.25 0 3 0 0 5.49 3 7 0 1 4.21 31 36 13\n\n8/30/10 2:34 PM\n\nDown Through the Seasons\n\n1982–83 Record: 18–53–9 Points: 45 Goals For: 257 Goals Against: 394 Finish: Sixth (Patrick) Coach: Eddie Johnston General Manager: Baz Bastien Entering the 1982–83 campaign, the Penguins felt good about their chances. Justifiably proud of a strong effort against the Islanders the previous postseason, the club possessed a core of solid veterans reinforced by what appeared to be a group of talented youngsters. Eddie Johnston summed up the prevailing belief that the team was on the verge of becoming a contender. “We are about four hockey players away,” he asserted. Ron Stackhouse retired during the off-season, ending the career of perhaps the most maligned and underappreciated player in franchise history. The club had high hopes that Randy Boyd, winner of the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the Ontario League’s top defenseman, would fill his slot. One of the team’s top defensive forwards, Gregg Sheppard, also hung up his skates. With Andre St. Laurent and scrappy rookie Dave Hannan waiting in the wings, the Penguins’ brass wasn’t overly concerned. For insurance Bastien picked up former All-Star defenseman Ian Turnbull from Los Angeles and reacquired Denis Herron from Montreal for a third-round draft pick. It was the veteran goalie’s third tour of duty with the team. The Pens’ top choice in the Entry Draft that year was Lethbridge Bronco right wing Rich Sutter, the youngest (along with twin brother Ron) of the famous hockey-playing family from Viking, Alberta. Although undersized, Sutter had been a productive offensive player in junior hockey while\n\n25\n\ndisplaying the tenacity and grit that had become a family trademark. But Sutter showed surprisingly little in training camp, leaving the Penguins no choice but to return him to Lethbridge for one more year of junior hockey. When the Penguins sputtered out of the starting gate, Boyd, Schutt, and Turnbull were immediately dispat"
