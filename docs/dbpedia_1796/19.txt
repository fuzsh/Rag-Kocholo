The AFF was founded by member states of, and is officially associated with, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).[2]

The AFF was established in Jakarta on 31 January 1984 during an informal meeting of representatives of six ASEAN member states; Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Thailand. The idea of founding the federation came from the initial meeting of founding the sub-continental football association in Bangkok in 1982 that was attended by Hamzah Abu Samah, Peter Velappan, Hans Pandelaki, Fernando G. Alvarez, Pisit Ngampanich, Teo Chong Tee and Yap Boon Chuan.[3] Other nations that have joined the federation since are Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (all in 1996),[1] East Timor in 2004, and Australia in 2013.[4]
