        "text": "After over 40 years of involvement in football, as I approach my last game tonight in Perth, Western Australia between Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United, I am extremely grateful for everybody that has assisted me along the way. I am in no way able to recognise the help and sacrifices that everyone has made in allowing me to achieve so many goals along the way, but what stays with me most are the memories, people and relationships formed that will remain with me. So, thank you to you all, and I have attempted to detail some of those below that have been instrumental in my career journey, as well as some amazing matches that I was privileged to be a part of. I will be thinking about you all as I enter the field one last time tonight, none of it would have been possible without my family, friends, colleagues, and employers who always supported my efforts, I hope to be able to enjoy reminiscing with you all soon. Love you all, Matthew Cream"
