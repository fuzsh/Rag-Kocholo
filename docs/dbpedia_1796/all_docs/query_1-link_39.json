        "text": "Kelly aiming for World Cup spot\n\nIrish referee Alan Kelly planned to use his experience in the MLS in America to try and secure a FIFA appointment to the next World Cup tournament in Russia in 2018. Former FIFA and UEFA ranked Kelly took up a new and exciting challenge as a referee and development training officer based in Boston and admits it was a job offer he just could not refuse.\n\n“Basically it’s a two-fold role – one is the actual refereeing in the MLS and the other is a coaching/training and development role for younger referees. The refereeing side of it is the main part and the coaching is a bit of a side issue but, at the same time, it’s important and it’s really interesting,” said Kelly. “The way things have panned out I will be refereeing in the MLS virtually straight away with pre-season games and then I will have a few MLS reserve division games and get involved as the fourth official just to get familiar with the league, the players and the culture,” he explained. “I am well prepared and ready to step into the MLS set up and I am looking forward to it now. My FIFA badge and ranking is recognised in America too and I’d hope to get a few more international fixtures down the road“, said Kelly whose new job commands a salary in the region of £130,000 per annum. Kelly added: “My plan is to go out and referee in the first season – set a standard and establish myself – and hopefully then when it comes to the international side of it that they see enough in me to nominate me again for a FIFA badge and I can go again. “That will open up more doors for me in terms of international football on that side of the world and I have to admit that I have half an eye on the World Cup finals in Russia. I think if I can establish myself in America, I will have a better opportunity of getting to Russia in 2018 than I probably would have in Ireland with UEFA”, he added. “That’s the long-term goal to officiate at World Cup finals. I am 38 now and with the retirement age set at 45 that could be my swan song”, he said.\n\nSource: Evening Echo\n\n↧\n\nFIFA Women’s World Cup 2015 Qualifiers\n\n13 September 2014\n\nRussia –

to change referees due to visa problems\n\nInitially appointed for the UEFA Champions League match Chelsea – Schalke, referee Milorad Mazic and his team had some problems in obtaining their British visas. The UK Embassy in Warsaw, in charge of the entire region, kept their passports a day longer, instead of sending the passports back to Serbia on Monday morning, they only did it in the evening, so the passports would not arrive on time. UEFA replaced the Serbian match officials (photo) with the Croatian Ivan Bebek along with his team, who were meant to be on Europa League duty this Thursday. They were also replaced by a Czech referee team led by Ivan Kruzliak. (Source: Daily Mail / bportal.ba)\n\nLast year, a French referee team had problems with their passports, but they managed to sort them out on time. \"The CFA, after reviewing the documents, including emails from the Technical Refereeing Department regarding the procedure for obtaining Russian visas, after hearing Nicolas Danos by conference call in his explanations, given the neglect observed in this case not to have sent the passport but simply copying it, considering the consequences of this administrative failure that could have prevented the visa without the intervention of diplomatic authorities, nevertheless that Nicolas Danos tried to limit the effect by providing immediate passport on the first flight and the travel of the French referee quartet finally took place normally. According to Article 39 section 6 of the referee regulations, decided unanimously to suspend Nicolas Danos for 15 days, starting on 3 September 2013.\" (Source: The Third Team)\n\n↧\n\nUEFA Europa

A review has been launched after a broken headset led to referee Manuel Grafe failing to award Eintracht Frankfurt a penalty during their 1-0 defeat to Augsburg. With the game still 0-0 after 16 minutes, Augsburg's Dominik Kohr pulled down Frankfurt attacker Vaclav Kadlec in the box, and many inside Frankfurt's Waldstadion expected Grafe (photo) to point to the spot, but he never blew the whistle.\n\nThe referee later apologised to Frankfurt coach Thomas Schaaf, and explained that he and his assistant did not see the infringement, and that the fourth official had tried to contact him via the headset. However, Grafe and the fourth official were not able to communicate because of problems with their headset. Frankfurt, who had been pondering an official protest against the result, announced that they would not lodge a protest because \"it was a referee's decision.\" CEO Heribert Bruchhagen said he had \"rarely seen a clearer penalty from the stands\" but added: \"It is like it is. Such things happen.\"\n\nHerbert Fandel, the head of the German FA's referee commission, said he would investigate the incident and attempt to prevent a repeat in the future. \"I think that it has been a very unfortunate and annoying situation, even if it was an exceptional occurrence,\" Fandel told Suddeutsche Zeitung. \"Even so, we will talk about this with the Bundesliga referees, and try to find ways to ensure those hard-to-imagine incidents can be eliminated in the future.\" Speaking to Sky, former referee Hellmut Krug, who is also a member of the commission, added: \"We will address this with the refs as soon as possible. We have never had such a case before. That the referee and the assistants don't see the penalty but the fourth official sees it and wants to communicate but can't -- you can't really imagine that happening in your wildest dreams.\" Krug said the fourth official, Patrick Ittrich, could have informed the referee without the headset but clarified that he was not reproaching him. \"It was a special situation, with a lot of pressure and stress, but a fourth official needs to do all he can to get in touch with the assistant,\" he said.\n\nSource: ESPN\n\n↧\n\nFIFA AR removes shirt to protest corruption and manipulation\n\nAlgerian FIFA Assistant Referee Mahmoud Mounir Bitam said FA’s President asked him to fix games. Algerian football is in major crisis after a headline grabbing stunt from a linesman in the second division. The match between CA Bordj Bou Arreridj and WA Tlemcen was brought to a standstill when 39-year-old assistant referee Mahmoud Mounir Bitam took off his shirt and marched off the field. For the record, Bitam has refereed at the highest level in Africa, being an assistant in FIFA’s international matches.\n\nThe assistant referee’s shirt aimed accusations of manipulation at Hamoum Khelil, the head of Algeria’s referee’s committee, and Mahfoud Kerbadj, the head of the country’s FA. Mahmoud Mounir Bitam later told the press the Mahfoud Kerbadj has twice asked him to help fix the result of matches.\n\nBitam said that Kerbadj asked him to fix the cup final between Algeria MC Alger and USM Alger so that MC Algiers would win. He also said Kerbadj wanted to influence the cup semi-final between JS Kabylie and CRB Fakroun Ain so that JSK would lose “intelligently”.\n\nSource: Stadiums News\n\n↧\n\nCopa Sudamericana – Group Stage (Matchday 6)\n\n23 September 2014\n\nCerro Porteño – Independiente del Valle\n\nReferee: Daniel Fedorczuk (URU, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Gabriel Popovits (URU)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Richard Trinidad (URU)\n\nFourth Official: Carlos Amarilla (PAR)\n\nReferee Observer: Ubaldo Aquino (PAR)\n\nUniversidad César Vallejo – Universitario\n\nReferee: Adrián Vélez (COL)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Wilmar Navarro (COL)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Rafael Rivas (COL)\n\nFourth Official: Miguel Santivañez (PER)\n\nReferee Observer: Gilberto Hidalgo (PER)\n\n24 September 2014\n\nUniversidad Católica – Huachipato\n\nReferee: José Argote (VEN)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Luis Sánchez (VEN)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Luis Murillo (VEN)\n\nFourth Official: Diego Lara (ECU)\n\nReferee Observer: Bommer Fierro (ECU)\n\nCaracas – Capiatá\n\nReferee: Víctor Carrillo (PER)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Raúl López (PER)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Braulio Cornejo (PER)\n\nFourth Official: Juan Soto (VEN)\n\nReferee Observer: Bernardo Corujo (VEN)\n\nDeportivo Cali – Peñarol\n\nReferee: Antonio Arias (PAR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Milciades Saldivar (PAR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Eduardo Cardozo (PAR)\n\nFourth Official: Luis Sánchez (COL)\n\nReferee Observer: Ramón Girón (COL)\n\n25 September 2014\n\nRiver Plate – Emelec\n\nReferee: Diego Ceballos (ARG)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Diego Bonfa (ARG)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Gustavo Rossi (ARG)\n\nFourth Official: Christian Ferreyra (URU)\n\nReferee Observer: Jorge Larrionda (URU)\n\nGeneral Díaz – Atlético Nacional\n\nReferee: Julio Bascuñán (CHI)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Marcelo Barraza (CHI)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Raúl Orellana (CHI)\n\nFourth Official: Julio Quintana (PAR)\n\nReferee Observer: Cecilio Bejarano (PAR)\n\n↧\n\nCONCACAF Champions League – Group Stage (Matchday 5)\n\n23 September 2014\n\nPortland Timbers – Alpha United\n\nReferee: Ricardo Montero (CRC, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Warner Castro (CRC)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Juan Lemus (GUA)\n\nFourth Official: Jafeth Perea (PAN)\n\nReferee Observer: Neftali Recinos (SLV)\n\nSporting Kansas City – Real Esteli\n\nReferee: Oscar Moncada (HON)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Jairo Morales (PUR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Omar Leiva (HON)\n\nFourth Official: Melvin Matamorros (HON)\n\nReferee Observer: Elix Peralta (PAN)\n\n24 September 2014\n\nCF Pachuca – CSD Municipal\n\nReferee: Javier Santos (PUR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Kedlee Powell (JAM)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Graeme Browne (SKN)\n\nFourth Official: Valdin Legister (JAM)\n\nReferee Observer: Jaggernath Goolcharan (TRI)\n\nDC United – Tauro FC\n\nReferee: Hugo Cruz (CRC)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Octavio Jara (CRC)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Javier Rojas (CRC)\n\nFourth Official: Jorge Perez (MEX)\n\nReferee Observer: Amato DeLuca (CAN)\n\nCD Fas – New York Red Bulls\n\nReferee: Fernando Guerrero (MEX)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Ricardo Louisville (SUR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Venton Mars (GUY)\n\nFourth Official: William Anderson (PUR)\n\nReferee Observer: Dave Meikle (JAM)\n\nCS Herediano – Club Leon\n\nReferee: David Gantar (CAN)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Phillippe Briere (CAN)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Garnet Page (JAM)\n\nfourth Official: Johannes Dolaini (SUR)\n\nReferee Observer: Jozsef Michna (USA)\n\n25 September 2014\n\nPuerto Rico Bayamón – Comunicaciones FC\n\nReferee: Oscar Davila (NCA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Keytzel Corrales (NCA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Henry Pupiro (NCA)\n\nFourth Official: Roberto Moreno (PAN)\n\nReferee Observer: Jorge Gasso (MEX)\n\nChorrillo FC – Liga Deportiva Alajuelense\n\nReferee: Joel Aguilar (SLV)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Hermenerito Leal (GUA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Jose Mangandi (SLV)\n\nFourth Official: Marlon Mejia (SLV)\n\nReferee Observer: Jesus Lebron (PUR)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nFIFA: Referees must “smell” the game\n\nAt the FIFA Technical Conference held in Panama for representatives of CONMEBOL and CONCACAF one of the juiciest discourses was conducted by Massimo Busacca, the FIFA Head of Refereeing. Not only for what he expressed, but also for the consultations with the participants. The interesting chat with Busacca had to be stopped by the moderators of the Conference for reasons of time and programming but with the promise that the dialogue would continue.\n\nBusacca gave an overview of the task by management noting that \"the FIFA Referees Committee assigned 25 three-person referee teams and 8 support teams from 43 countries. Training and monitoring of these referees began in 2012 under the project entitled \"Road to Brazil.\" He highlighted in this regard that \"the technical and physical activities were supported by strict medical supervision.\" He cited as a high point \"the meetings with coaches and representatives of all the selections in Florianópolis. We seek to clarify several key points and it seems important that players, coaches and referees can talk about sportsmanship. In Brazil these meetings were repeated with each of the teams with a full squad of players and coaching staff. These meetings were important not only from a technical point of view but also to have direct communication. It is good to develop a relationship of mutual respect on and off the field.\" He cited significant progress in \"goal line technology and the use of spray to mark the position for a free kick.\"\"In the case of goal line technology, it allowed us to check twice that the ball went over the line and in the case of the spray it helped locate the wall in the right place and that it stayed there. That's good for the player who takes the free kick and also so the players won't creep forward and get yellow cards.\"\n\n“We are the 33rd team and we also try to have the best 'players”\n\nBusacca went on to say that \"we (referees) are the 33rd team and what we want is the same as the coaches of the other 32 teams. We also want to have the best on our team and for that we work on all aspects. The same as on any team not all are at the same level not all are 'number 10'. There are some with higher skills and others who don't have that. If a referee naturally has these skills everything is easier but if not you have to work more.\" About a referees preparation for a World Cup he said that \"today it's not enough just the technical, physical and medical preparation. Today a referee requires much knowledge of the game, the characteristics of the teams, players, tactics. It is very important that the referee reads the game which allows him to anticipate what might happen and that requires a lot of concentration and a lot of knowledge of the game and the teams that are playing. In the physical part it doesn't matter that he runs a lot but that he runs well.\"\n\n“It is essential that a referee has a football mentality”\n\nReferring to the practical part of refereeing, Busacca said \"it is essential that the referee has a football mentality. That he really knows the game and not just the rules, that he understands what happens, why it happens and how it happens, that he can interpret every action of the game and here we return to what we have already said, there are referees who have that gift, who have that knowledge, that feel the game that way and others that don't. We often say that the referee should have a nose for football, he must \"smell\" the game, have that \"feeling\" that lets him know how to act at all times. We look for the ref to do everything as simply as possible, with plenty of communication, a good relationship, trying to prevent what can be prevented and to avoid what can be avoided. We seek to protect the players and the image of the game, sportsmanship, fair play and respect.\"\n\nOpen dialogue = transparency\n\nWhen it was time for questions the exchange with the participants had very nice moments, laden with football essence as, for example, when the national coach of Mexico, Miguel Herrera, inquired again about something that was mentioned in the course of the World Cup and that has to do with what in Mexico are called \"los clavados\" (dives) and in South America is called \"jumping into the pool.\" In particular he referred to \"the Robben case\". He also wondered why in decisive games that a referee is used from the same continent as one of the teams. Busacca responded that \"it would be very difficult to comment on each of the games and each of the calls. We seek to eliminate errors but we know that there will be some and we ask forgiveness. We are sorry because we know perfectly well that a mistake can decide classification or elimination. It hurts a lot when we realize there was a mistake but it happens in our job. With respect to a referee from a continent assigned a decisive game with a team from the same continent we do not look at that, we look at the best and if we believe that a referee is right for a match we trust in their ability and honesty.\" Among the questions arose the issue of goalkeepers coming out of their goal on penalty kicks and Busacca responded that \"we are working on that and we seek to follow the course of which we have spoken, there is much talk with the keepers, they are warned and we believe in this World Cup there were no cases of them coming out of goal.\" The discussion was closed although it could have continued indefinitely as almost all talks about football. The best part is what can be achieved through this type of dialogue between people from different sectors of football that is open, honest, and transparent. And, of course, refereeing plays an important role in this. So it was good that before Massimo Busacca left he reiterated that \"we will always apologize for mistakes, we are very sorry when they occur.
