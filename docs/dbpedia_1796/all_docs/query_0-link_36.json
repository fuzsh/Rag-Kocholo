        "text": "Purpose: determine the level of individual functionality referees qualifications. Objective of the study was to determine the physiological parameters characterizing the functionality of football referees qualifications. Material : mainly experiment involved 29 highly qualified referees aged 21-45 years. In the main experiment participated 29 referees and 40 assistant referees (n = 69) Ukrainian Premier League. Results: found that the means and methods that use Ukrainian football referee high qualification in the special physical training for a competition, are not effective enough. Consequence of poorly planned training process is to increase the number of wrong decisions of the referees during the match associated with poor motor activity. Conclusions: data obtained in the course of educational research confirmed our theory about the necessity of individualization process special physical training qualifications of referees, which would entail increasing the functional and motor a...\n\nOne of the primary requirements for a futsal referee is the minimum of incorrect decisions in a match. An important starting point for the possibility of the correct decision of the referee is his position on the court when deciding. The aim of the thesis is to find out whether the error rate of the futsal referee changes when assessing game situations (leading to a direct free kick) in connection with his position. The research group consisted of referees of the 1st futsal league in the Czech Republic (n = 15); average age 39.4 (SD = 6.2). A total of 685 game situations were assessed from 42 matches in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons. The methods of work were: indirect observation of video recordings, notation analysis, expert assessment of game situations by an expert group (n = 5). Results: the error rate in the decisions of referees is 7%; inadequate positions detected 3%; A statistically significant relationship was found between the degree of error rate in the referees&#39; d...\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the physical capacities, in-game activity profiles and decision-making skills of experienced and less experienced football referees during the match. A total of 10 football referees, 5 experienced (>5 years) and 5 less experienced (<5 years) participated in this study voluntarily. As a result of statistical analysis; aerobic capacity of experienced referees (61.14±3.31 ml/kg/min) was significantly higher than the less-experienced referees (54.67±2.93 ml/kg/min.) (p<0.05). As compared with less-experienced referees (9.09±1.08 km), the total distance covered (10.73±.41 km) and sprint distance of experienced referees (experienced: 686.95±140.93 m, less-experienced: 459.85±168.37 m) were significantly higher in the match. There was no significant difference in the total decision scores in two football competitions between experienced and less experienced referees (184.80±21.25 and 193.40±26.12) (p>0.05). It was found that less-experienced referees made more incorrect decisions in the match than experienced referees (9.60±4.21 and 20.20±2.68) (p<0.05). Experienced referees had higher in-game activity profiles than less-experienced referees, and their incorrect decision making scores were lower. In addition, in order to minimize the incorrect decision scores of the experienced and especially less-experienced referees in the match, it is thought that it is important to include exercises related to perceptual-motor skills in their training programs as well as physical training.\n\nThe concern with the performance of football referees has opened lines of investigation in areas such as technical and physical performance. Theoretical and analytical gaps regarding the causes of their performances in a holistic perspective are scarce. The purpose of this study is to understand how various processes of personal, career development and contextual nature influences the classification of football referees. The literature review on excellence and the performance of the referees allowed to define a model that contemplates three distinct areas: 1) personal experience; 2) sports course; 3) surrounding context. The model to understand the causes of the performance of the Portuguese referees was obtained by comparing the classification of referees for national boards between the periods of 2009-10 and 2018-19 with the relative data to their age, experience as a federated player and referee, region density and proximity to peers of national board. The results show that the p...\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the continuing education preferences of soccer referees registered with the United States Soccer Federation. Participants completed a Likert-type survey consisting of 18 topics asking them to rank how helpful they would consider each topic for continuing education. Results indicated that referees considered player management, using personality to manage games, and the decision making process as the most important topics for continuing education. Administrative duties and handling were considered the least important topics. There were no significant differences in perceptions of importance when comparing referee experience levels. These findings suggest that referee curriculum should be reviewed and revised according to referee preferences.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to report on the outcome of a two-day consensus-building exercise amongst sport scientists and sport practitioners interested in the recruitment, development, and retention of sport officials. Twenty participants including volunteers and paid employees affiliated with nine Ontario-based sport organizations, university researchers, and provincial government policy makers participated. A consensus statement regarding this aspect of sport officiating and, more specifically, “What do we know?”, “What don’t we know?”, and “Where does the research need to go from here?” is presented. A willingness to consider and embrace these ideas may be critical in moving sport officiating from being an understudied and undervalued segment of the sport system to receiving the attention and respect it deserves going forward."
