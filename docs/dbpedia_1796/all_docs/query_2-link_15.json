While Erdenes has repaid a portion of the debt with coal shipments, an interest of more than 10 percent has inflated the amount outstanding.\n\nTavan Tolgoi, located 270 kilometers (168 miles) north of the Chinese border in the Gobi Desert, is one of several large scale mineral deposits that Mongolia expects will stimulate the economy. The country's pace of economic growth was 7.8 percent last year after three straight years of double-digit expansion.\n\nIn December, a group comprising Energy Resources LLC, China Shenhua Energy Co. and Sumitomo Corp. won the permit to develop a portion of the Tavan Tolgoi deposits, beating a bid from U.S. mining company Peabody Energy Corp.\n\nRetain Ownership\n\nMongolia, which will retain full ownership of the Tavan Tolgoi deposit, has set a requirement that the debt be paid by the consortium. While Aluminum Corp. of China, or Chalco, didn't participate in the bids, the presence of another state-owned Chinese company, Shenhua, in the group has come in the way of talks, Enkhsaikhan said.\n\n\"Chalco and Shenhua have to meet each other and try to resolve this problem,\" he said. \"If necessary, I hope the governments will be involved.\"\n\nEnergy Resources Chief Executive Officer Battsengel Gotov is responsible for negotiating on behalf of the consortium, said Enkhsaikhan. Battsengel can't comment because of a media \"blackout period,\" spokeswoman Ariunaa Baldandorj said.\n\nWhile a target date to conclude negotiations has yet to be set, results are expected \"within this month,\" Enkhsaikhan said.\n\nAnother key issue between Mongolia and the consortium is the construction of a railway network to transport coal from the mine to the Chinese border. The railway line will be built on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer agreement with 51 percent of the shares to be transferred to Mongolia after 30 years.\n\n\"We have almost reached an agreement on the railway, but it is still an open issue,\" said Enkhsaikhan. \"Maybe we need to talk a little more, once the Chalco debt issue is resolved.\"\n\nErdenes TT has found it difficult to develop the deposit and market the coal on its own. Suspensions have occurred due to disputes with Chinese coal buyers as well as Australia's Macmahon Holdings Ltd., the company's main contractor for the site. Erdenes TT and Macmahon are currently locked in negotiations over payments.\n\nLink to article\n\nNegotiations drawn out over Mongolia's largest coal mine\n\nBY TERRENCE EDWARDS\n\nMarch 10 (Reuters) - Talks to allow a consortium led by China's Shenhua Energy to take over Mongolia's largest coal mine have yet to be completed, with the project still paying off debts to another Chinese state miner, an official said on Tuesday.\n\nMongolia is desperate to kick-start a deal expected to be worth as much as $4 billion, with foreign investment into the country falling 74 percent last year, largely because of disputes between companies and the government.\n\nLast year, China's top coal firm Shenhua formed a consortium with Japan's Sumitomo Corp and Energy Resources LLC, a wholly-owned unit of the Mongolian Mining Corp, to take over the management of the Mongolian state-owned firm in charge of the huge Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit.\n\nThe mining project in the country's southern Gobi region includes the East and West Tsankhi blocks.\n\nNegotiations with Shenhua were due to be completed before Mongolia's lunar new year in February, but have already missed the deadline, according to Mongolian Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan, who oversees Tavan Tolgoi and other giant mining projects.\n\nOne challenge is how to handle debts owed to China's Chalco Group by Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, the Mongolian state-owned firm in charge of the project.\n\nErdenes Tavan Tolgoi borrowed $350 million from Chalco in 2011 and agreed to pay back the debt in the form of coal deliveries from its East Tsankhi block. It still owes about $150 million to the company, as well as other commitments.\n\nThe government used most of the funds it borrowed from Chalco to finance a short-lived social welfare programme that distributed about $15 to every citizen each month.\n\n\"After the repayment of outstanding loans to Chalco, Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi still has an obligation to sell 80 percent of its coal (to Chalco) from the East Tsankhi mine for five years,\" said Enkhbaatar Myagmarulzii, a project manager working under the minister.\n\nMongolia has set up a working group to lead negotiations with the consortium, which will be entrusted with developing and managing both the East and West Tsankhi blocks, which hold a combined 1.8 billion tons of coking coal.\n\nThe Tavan Tolgoi project has attracted the attention of dozens of foreign investment banks and mining conglomerates, but its progress has stalled as a result of financial strains and interference from the government.\n\nMongolia's previous attempt to find investment for Tavan Tolgoi ended in failure, when its decision to award the project to a consortium consisting of Shenhua, Peabody Energy and a team of Russian and Mongolian firms was criticised by Japanese and South Korean rivals and subsequently annulled.\n\nErdenes Tavan Tolgoi is also still in dispute with MacMahon Holdings, which was contracted to develop the mine's east block.

It may also consider providing working capital funding support for the Nuurstei project subject to the project meeting Noble's internal financing criteria.\n\nAspire has also agreed to provide Noble with options to subscribe for additional shares in the company as is required to maintain Noble's current 13.9% shareholding interest in Aspire on a diluted basis in the event that additional capital is raised in the Company during the next 12 months.\n\nErdenet to Ovoot railway\n\nAspire and its subsidiary Northern Railways, in which Noble has an option to acquire 10%, continue to make progress in developing a technical, environmental and funding case to support an application for a Rail Concession.\n\nIt is expected that the concession for the Erdenet – Ovoot railway will be considered in the next three months.\n\nThe 547 kilometre Erdenet-Ovoot rail line is a key requirement to unlock the value of the Ovoot Coking Coal Project and future earnings from mining and production from the project for Aspire.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAspire Mining now has more time to progress development of the key Erdenet-Ovoot railway after securing a 12 month extension to a US$5 million loan from Noble Group.\n\nIt will also benefit from Noble leveraging its established marketing capability and logistics capacity for the Nuurstei project and increasing the scope of coal marketing services to the Ovoot project to 40% of its production.\n\nNews flow ahead includes progress in discussions with potential funding partners as well as further advances towards securing the Rail Concession.\n\nLink to article\n\nGuildford: Transition from Explorer to Miner Complete\n\nFirst commercial coal shipment milestone\n\nMarch 10 -- Guildford Coal Limited (Guildford or the Company) (ASX: GUF) is pleased to advise that the Company has successfully completed the transition of the Company from explorer to miner with the completion of the first commercial shipment of 6,000t of coal to Baotou Iron & Steel (Group) Co.

To ride their horses and take away their possessions.\"\n\nPresent day Mongolia is still struggling to emerge from the bitter legacy of 70 years of a rule arguably even less enlightened than that of Genghis: the Soviet Union.\n\nOne of those legacies – which it has in common with many underdeveloped countries – is the reflexive attempt to grab the possessions not merely of its enemies but its foreign investors, thus damaging its own prospects.\n\nThe vast, thinly-populated country is a resource treasure house, which means that foreign investment is the surest route to economic growth, but an immature political system and a commodity price collapse have slowed development. Sitting between Russian history and Chinese resource demand has also proved to be something of a mixed blessing.\n\nKhan Resources is a Toronto-based company that knows something about sitting between Russia and China too. It was attempting to develop a uranium deposit at a site a four-hour drive from the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbataar (Mogi: L). When commodity prices started to rise a decade ago, suddenly both the Russians, who had held the rights to the deposit, and the Mongolian government (both still hold stakes) started adopting Genghis-style tactics.\n\nThe Russians attempted a low-ball takeover. Khan brought in a Chinese white knight. The deal fell apart. The Mongolian government cancelled the company's licences.\n\nThe Russians evaded a lawsuit from Khan by successfully invoking sovereign immunity (in Ontario, of all places), but last week, after four years of litigation, Khan received a US$100 million award against Mongolia from an international arbitration tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nThe award is worth around $1.50 a share. Khan has been trading at little more than 50 cents, so the market clearly thinks the company is going to have trouble collecting. However, Mongolia's desperate desire to boost foreign investment may be on Khan's side.\n\nAs a stunning indicator of how governance techniques have changed not merely since the thirteenth century but the fall of Berlin Wall, Mongolian cellphone customers recently got a text from their Prime Minister, Saikhanbileg Chimed. He wanted to know if the government should push ahead with more foreign investment in mining, or pursue austerity, slashing public spending. Talk about direct democracy.\n\nLike most polls, this one was obviously loaded, but it certainly laid out genuine alternatives: foreign investment or autarchic poverty. This makes the fate of the Khan judgment of more than passing interest to other foreign investors.\n\nA far larger project – again with a major Canadian element – relates to the development of the vast Oyu Tolgoi gold/copper deposit, which is now being overseen by Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto. Oyu Tolgoi was discovered in 2001 by Robert Friedland's Vancouver-based Ivanhoe Mines.\n\nDisputes between Ulaanbataar and Rio Tinto have led to a virtual halt of activity. This, combined with the commodity price slump, has led to a reported 88% decline in foreign investment in the past two years, and a sharp drop in Mongolian growth rates.\n\nCollecting arbitration awards against countries is always a complex and fraught business. The most spectacular award in recent history is that of US$50 billion against the government of Vladimir Putin for his government's flagrant expropriation of oil company Yukos. One can imagine how seriously Vlad the expropriator is treating that .\n\nVancouver miner Gold Reserve won a judgment for US$740 million last year against Venezuela following the expropriation of one of its properties by the regime of the late Hugo Chavez. Venezuela, thanks to the legacy of Mr. Chavez's misrule, was already in desperate straits before the oil price collapse. Now there are fears it may default on its government debt.\n\nAnother intriguing case is that being pursued by the Toronto-based Tokmakjian Group against the Castro regime in Cuba after the expropriation of its business there and the imprisonment of its founder and three managers, all of whom have now been released.\n\nThe Cuban regime provides a depressing example of how a \"stationary bandit,\" as the great economist Mancur Olson called predatory governments, can expropriate wholesale and get away with it for a very long time.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Embargo has signally failed to bring down the Castro dictatorship, President Obama's recent announcement of détente is undoubtedly being viewed cynically by the Castro brothers as a means of extending their rule.\n\nThe Mongolian Prime Minister's recent text/poll suggests that its government does not want to tread such a path. Khan, meanwhile, is hoping that the government will wish to demonstrate its adherence to the rule of law. If it doesn't, the company is no doubt investigating where it might lay its hands on Mongolian assets overseas.\n\nThe Canadian government has adopted a low-profile on this issue, as it usually does in such cases, even if Canada is the second largest investor in Mongolia, and Mongolia is a \"priority market\" under the Conservatives' Global Markets Action Plan. Ottawa has for some years been working on a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA) with Ulaanbataar.\n\nEd Fast, Minister of International Trade, met with Rentsendoo Jigjid, Mongolia's Minister of Mining, \"on the margins\" of the recent Prospectors and Developers conference in Toronto. One wonders if Mr. Fast suggested – diplomatically, of course — that Mongolia pay up.\n\nLink to article\n\nKhan Resources Director Raffi Babikian Sells 71,000 Shares (KRI)\n\nMarch 9 (Analyst Ratings Network) Khan Resources (TSE:KRI) Director Raffi Babikian sold 71,000 shares of the company's stock in a transaction dated Monday, March 9th.

Despite the success the Company has achieved in generating a 478 million tonne 2004 JORC Compliant Coal Mineral Resource at the Nuurst Project (326 million tonnes Measured, 104 million tonnes Indicated, 48 million tonnes Inferred) and culminating in the granting a mining licence in July 2013, Modun has not been able to convert this asset into growth in the Company's share price nor has it been able to secure the finance to bring the project into production.\n\nAs a consequence, the Company has been considering other opportunities available to it to bring value to its Shareholders. The Company has been investigating the opportunity to diversify into other industries including the technology sector via the acquisition of a technology business. The Company has been advised by ASX that, if it does pursue this strategy, then it will most likely need to re-comply with Chapters 1&2 of the Listing Rules. Shareholder approval will be required to sell the Nuurst Project.\n\nDuring the period, Modun appointed new members to the board to assist the Company implement its new strategy. On 1 September 2014, Mike Hill, Andrew Gray and Philip Kapp were appointed as Directors. This provides Modun with more than 30 years private equity investment experience that will be used to accelerate the transformation of Modun into a high growth and strong cash-flow generating business. The Directors will continue to assess opportunities across the range of the alternative strategies listed above.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, the Company entered into a highly conditional agreement to sell 100% of the issued share capital of its subsidiary, Modun Resources LLC (Modun LLC), which owns 100% of the Nuurst Project.\n\nThe consideration for the sale is US$8m payable as to US$1,000,000 in cash and US$7,000,000 in deferred (royalty) payments, paid on the basis of $0.50 per tonne for the first 14 millions tonnes of coal extracted and sold by the purchaser.\n\nThe Agreement is subject to a number of conditions including:\n\na)The purchaser completing, to its satisfaction, legal, accounting and technical due diligence by 30 April 2015;\n\nb)The granting of any necessary consents, approvals, exemptions, authorisations and regulatory approvals including:\n\n·the approval of Modun shareholders\n\n·the consent from the Government of Mongolia's Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia regarding the transaction (if required by Mongolian Law).\n\nThe due diligence process by the purchaser remains ongoing at the date of this report.\n\nEvents Occurring After the Balance Date\n\nOn 5 February 2015, the Company agreed to extend the exclusive due diligence period for the prospective purchaser of Modun LLC for a further 8 weeks in order to finalise information requirements and advance contractual negotiations.

Mongolia's economy is traditionally based on herding and agriculture, but is expanding aggressively due to foreign investments in large mining projects that capitalize on the country's vast deposits of coal, copper, gold, tungsten, tin, nickel, zinc, silver, and iron. Real GDP is expected to expand by 8.4% in 2015 and this should accelerate sharply if the government can resolve an ongoing dispute with a large foreign mining company. Mongolia's growth is also steered by high levels of agricultural production and the spill-over from China's epic growth.\n\nStock Market:\n\nThe Mongolian Stock Exchange (MSE), located in Ulan Bator, is the country's sole stock exchange. The history of MSE's securities market began between 1992-1995 when 475 state owned entities were successfully privatized through MSE distributing 96.1 million shares worth 8.2 billion MNT (7.0 million USD) to the citizens of Mongolia within the framework of implementing \"Privatization Policy\" of the Mongolian Government during the transitional period of a central planned economy to a market economy in Mongolia. Secondary market trade began on August 28, 1995 auctioning 16,000 shares of three companies that valued 15,000 USD.\n\nThe MSE now lists 212 companies and has a market capitalization of USD 700 million as of February 2015.\n\nMongolian Stock Exchange website: www.mse.mn\n\nCountry snapshots for all of AFC's markets can be found on our website at www.asiafrontiercapital.com\n\nAFC Country Report: Mongolia\n\nThe key topic that will continue to dictate investor confidence in Mongolia is the issue of Oyu Tolgoi, the USD 6 billion copper and gold mine that has become the focal point of a well-publicized dispute between Turquoise Hill Resources (a subsidiary of mining giant Rio Tinto), which owns 66% of the mine, and the Mongolian government, which owns 34% of the project. Hailed as a transformational discovery that would account for more than one-third of Mongolia's GDP upon completion, the project has become a litmus test for foreign investment in the country, with many outside observers expressing worry over the ongoing disagreements between the two joint venture partners regarding profit sharing and financing.\n\nMongolia's new Prime Minister Chimed Saikhanbelig (Mogi: I suggest the authors to get names of important folks right first) has tried to revive foreign investment in the wake of the Oyu Tolgoi dispute and several other incidents involving backtracking on mining licenses and changing foreign investment laws. He has proposed an amendment to the minerals law to allow the government to swap its ownership stake in the Oyu Tolgoi project in exchange for future royalty payments from mine developers (Mogi: this clause is not retroactive, therefore not applicable to OT). The amendment would mean that the Government of Mongolia would be off the hook for providing a significant amount of the USD 5 billion necessary for the construction costs of Phase Two of Oyu Tolgoi, which would help develop the underground portion of the mine, which contains 80% of the deposit's total value. Rio Tinto, however, does not want to increase its ownership percentage in the project by buying the Government's stake, especially in light of the fact that global commodity prices are down – in January, copper fell to its lowest price since the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nOne potential glimpse of hope for foreign investors watching the Mongolia situation came in early March when an international tribunal ordered the Government of Mongolia to pay USD 100 million to Canada-based Khan Resources in compensation for cancelling the company's uranium mining licenses granted in 2009. Khan's shares jumped +28% on the news, and the court ruling is hopefully a signal of a move towards better enforcement of laws, contracts, and agreements in the country between the government and foreign companies. (Mogi: this I agree with)\n\nMore good news came when the government announced its plan to renew the granting of mineral exploration licenses commencing on 26th January 2015 after a more than 5 year hiatus. There may also be signs of hope for continued political reform as the President of Mongolia also pardoned three foreign employees of coal miner SouthGobi Resources Ltd who had been sentenced to over 5 years in prison for tax evasion. The foreigners had been banned from leaving Mongolia, and the case was plagued by murky details and translation problems, threatening to further derail investor sentiment in the country.\n\nForward progress by the government is vital to coax back foreign investment, as the country's Central Bank announced in August of last year that FDI entering Mongolia from January to July 2014 had fallen 70% year-on-year to a total of USD 873 million, following a 43% drop during the same period in 2013. Slumping foreign investment has been the main catalyst for Mongolia's woes, but dipping commodity prices and a weakened currency have also contributed to the country's slide.\n\nByambasaikhan Bayanjargal, the CEO of Erdenes Mongol, the umbrella company that holds the Mongolian government's stakes in various mining projects in the country, believes he can transform the outlook for mining projects and foreign investment in the country. Bayanjargal, who previously worked for the Asian Development Bank in project finance and helped manage a USD 120 million wind farm project in the country, wants to raise foreign capital and sell shares in the company to create a \"Mongolian Temasek\" modeled after the highly-successful Temasek Holdings investment company in Singapore that manages about USD 164 billion on behalf of the Singaporean government.\n\n…\n\nAFC Travel Report: Mongolia\n\n…\n\nLink to report\n\nEx-UBS Banker to Wealthy Goes Solo, to Focus on East Africa, Mongolia, Vietnam\n\nMarch 11 (Bloomberg) -- Albert Momdjian quit his senior job at UBS Group AG last year to start an investment firm in Dubai. After more than 20 years in banking, he decided it was time to put his own money on the line.\n\n\"The industry has changed significantly over the years and is no longer what it used to be,\" Momdjian, 44, said at the offices of SOKOTRA Capital, his firm in the Dubai International Financial Center. \"It is extremely regulated, less lucrative financially, and certainly more stressful and less fun.\"\n\nLike other veteran bankers going solo, he was lured by a change in attitudes in the Middle East about how best to manage large family fortunes. In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, many family offices -- the wealth management units advising Middle Eastern billionaires and their relatives - - enlisted private equity firms and hedge funds to place their money, often giving them free rein. When the crisis erupted, family offices found themselves holding illiquid assets that were bleeding value but which they couldn't unload.\n\n\"Large institutions and family offices in the region as well as globally, are looking to be more actively involved in their investments,\" Momdjian said. \"The days of blind pool investing through private equity funds is nearing its end.\"\n\nRare Deals\n\nMomdjian, formerly the head of UBS's business with the Swiss bank's wealthiest clients in the Middle East and Africa, is inviting family offices and institutions to invest in deals with him in fast-growing, developing markets. By putting up his own money and not requiring lock-in periods, he is seeking to attract investors who want flexibility and assurances they are backing credible ventures.\n\nSOKOTRA is named after the island off Yemen known for its rare flora and fauna, a reference to his determination to find unique investment opportunities. It will initially focus on East Africa and emerging Asia, mainly Mongolia and Vietnam, because those countries offer an avenue into neighboring China, he said.\n\n\"Frontier markets still offer tremendous growth prospects for investors who understand them well,\" Momdjian said. \"Our aim is to complete at least one or two investments by the end of the year.\"\n\nBoutique Investment\n\nSOKOTRA is scouting for deals across industries ranging from agriculture and manufacturing to retail. Momdjian said he is interested in investments in which the firm would have a significant minority stake. He declined to discuss the firm's finances in detail but said he has enough to cover operating costs for three years in addition to personal funds.\n\n…\n\nLink to full article\n\nBack to top\n\nLocal Market\n\nBishrelt's Undarmaa Speculated to Replace MSE Acting CEO\n\nMarch 12 (Mongolian Economy) There is a rumor that Bishrelt Group CEO B.Undarmaa will step into the role of Mongolian Stock Exchange CEO, replacing acting chief D.Angar.\n\nThis issue was discussed during Mongolian Stock Exchange's (MSE) board of directors meeting on 6 March. By law, the MSE board of directors has the privilege to elect or replace the CEO. The Ministry of Finance, which has the responsibility of implementing the MSE's shareholder rights, submitted the executive appointment proposal. A decision has yet to be made.\n\nWho's who?\n\nThere's speculation that B.Undarmaa's appointment to the CEO of MSE would create a conflict of interests, because she owns a certain amount of stock in two companies and operates a broker-dealer company under her son's name.\n\nB.Undarmaa graduated from the Moscow Institute of Management and majored in engineering economics. She has a PhD in Economics. In 2012, she was appointed as Deputy Minister of Education. Currently, she is CEO of Bishrelt Group, head of the Mongolian Family Development Center, on the board of directors of the Mongolian Social Democratic Women's Association, and has been a member of Mongolian People's Party since 2007; in 2008, she was elected as the City Council's Chairman of the Standing Committee on Social Policy.\n\nActing CEO of the MSE D.Angar entered the office only a half year ago. He majored in finance from the University of Central Arkansas, and holds a master's degree in international finance and accounting from the University of Liverpool. Previously, he was the Head of Debt Management Department of the Ministry of Finance, and trade and economic advisor for the Mongolian Embassy in the UK from 2011 to 2014.\n\nAfter his appointment as CEO of MSE, he mentioned in an interview with www.mongolianeconomy.mn: \"Reforms are being done. Works to improve regulation and operations to meet international standards will be conducted. It's as if we're still using wooden wheels, while it's confirmed that rubber tire run faster.\"\n\nDuring his tenure, he managed to reform and revitalise the MSE. Over the past three years the MSE worked with no profit; but in each of the last two months, the MSE has generated a profit MNT 50 million.\n\nLink to article\n\nMSE Weekly Active Players Report\n\nMarch 13 (MSE) Mongolian Stock Exchange organized 5 securities trading sessions and made transaction of MNT 17,703,375,042.00 between 9 March 2015 and 13 March 2015.\n\nShare trading:\n\n106,893 shares of 56 joint stock companies worth of MNT 369,174,542.00 were traded.\n\nMOST ACTIVILY TRADED SECURITIES\n\nMOST ACTIVE BROKERAGE COMPANIES\n\nGovernment retail bonds trading:\n\n173,332 Government retail bonds worth of MNT 17,333,200,000.00 traded through one trading session.\n\nMOST ACTIVE BROKERAGE COMPANIES IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TRADING\n\nAs of 13 March 2015, market capitalization was MNT 1,378,547,310,649.08 which indicated increase of 2.36%, and MSE ALL index increased 0.65% from previous week.\n\nLink to report\n\nMSE Primary Offer: ₮83.3 Billion 28-Week T-Bills at 7.9% Discount, 16% Yield\n\nMarch 11 (MSE) --\n\n1.The issuer's name: Mongolian Ministry of Finance\n\n2.The purpose of the issuance of bond: Fund management of State treasure\n\n3.Offering scope of securities: Offering to the public\n\n4.Type of securities: Government securities\n\n5.Face value: MNT 100,000\n\n6.Discounted price: MNT 92,088.00\n\n7.Total amounts issued: 833,395 Units\n\n8.Securities performance:\n\nGovernment Securities name\n\nAmount /units/\n\nValue /billion MNT/\n\nMaturity /week/\n\nForm of Interest payment*\n\nInterest rate (percent)\n\nStarting date of the order\n\nClosing date of the trading\n\nЗГЭБ-Б-12-293\n\n833,395\n\n83.3\n\n28\n\nDiscounted\n\n16.00%\n\n2015.03.11\n\n2015.03.17\n\n9.Rate of interest: interest rate of the Government Securities, which will be issued weekly, will be based on auction results of Central Bank basis State Government Securities weighted average interest rate.

However, dependence on natural resources has exposed both economies to volatility in commodity prices and shifts in investor sentiment, undermining growth prospects in both countries and straining government finances.\n\nIn addition, downward pressures on exports and capital inflows have reduced foreign-exchange reserve buffers. Unpredictability in the policy environment has weighed on economic growth more in Mongolia than in Ghana.\n\nWhile both countries will face heightened external pressures from sovereign bond repayments in the coming years, falling commodity prices will hurt Ghana more than Mongolia, given the former's position as a net oil exporter. But Mongolia's external risks are more pronounced due to a sharp drop in foreign direct investment over the last year.\n\nWeak fiscal management is also a shared credit risk, but while Mongolia's fiscal performance is strongly correlated with commodity cycles, Ghana's public finances outcomes are more closely tied to electoral cycles.\n\nMoody's further notes that Ghana's public finances are more strained, as seen in its much heavier debt burden and weaker debt affordability metrics. In the case of Mongolia, interest payments comprise a lower 4.5% of revenues, versus 23% for Ghana -- but this relative strength is diminishing as interest payments rise and mineral and corporate tax revenues decline.\n\nSubscribers can access the full report at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_1002422\n\nLink to release\n\nMoody's: Mongolia banking system outlook negative; economic pressure rising\n\nHong Kong, March 06, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service says the negative outlook on Mongolia's banking system -- unchanged since 2013 -- reflects the multiple headwinds that continue to challenge Mongolian banks.\n\n\"While Mongolia's expanding mining capacity is a main driver in our growth assumption, weak commodity prices and slowing global demand continue to weigh on the outlook for the country's national income and external position,\" says Hyun Hee Park, a Moody's Assistant Vice President and Analyst.\n\n\"We expect Mongolian banks' credit profiles to suffer broad pressure after a period of rapid policy-triggered credit growth in recent years, which will be reflected in a continued deterioration in asset quality, liquidity and capitalization,\" adds Park.\n\nPark was speaking on the release of Moody's \"Banking System Outlook Mongolia\".\n\nThe report -- whose outlook expresses Moody's expectation of how bank creditworthiness will evolve in this system over the next 12-18 months -- looks at Mongolia's banking system in terms of five factors: Operating environment (which is classified as deteriorating); funding and liquidity (deteriorating); asset quality and capital (deteriorating); profitability and efficiency (deteriorating); and systemic support (stable).\n\nMoody's says economic growth will remain subdued in Mongolia over the next 12-18 months, driven by a slowdown in foreign direct investment and tightening macroeconomic policies.\n\nThe country's weak external position could keep its exchange rate under pressure and its inflation rate high, thereby requiring the Bank of Mongolia to maintain its tight monetary policy stance.\n\nMoody's assessment of Mongolia's banks takes into account the consideration that published metrics may not accurately reflects the true financial situation. For example, Moody's estimates that reported capital ratios are overstated by as much as 100 basis points due to regulatory forbearance.\n\nWhile a resolution of the government's dispute with Rio Tinto plc (A3 stable) over Phase 2 of the Oy Tolgoi mining project would facilitate further foreign direct investment, such rebound is by no means a panacea, says Moody's.\n\nIt would take several quarters for foreign direct investment to have a tangible economic impact, and will do little to ease the immediate strains the banks face over the next 12-18 months.\n\nMoody's rates the four largest commercial banks in Mongolia as well as the government-related policy bank Development Bank of Mongolia LLC (B2 negative). Moody's-rated commercial banks accounted for 65% of total system loans and 66% of total system deposits as of 30 September 2014.\n\nOf the four commercial banks that Moody's rates, it assigns a baseline credit assessment of b2 to Khan Bank LLC and a BCA of b3 to Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia LLC, State Bank LLC and XacBank LLC.

Also they have mentioned that Ch.Altankhuyag, Ch.Ulaan and N.Batbayar have resigned, while N.Zoljargal is still holding his position.\n\nAlso they have said that Mongolian citizens are living in between the loans, whereas Bank of Mongolia is not doing its job to stabilize tugrug depreciation and holding the currency reserves at the safety level. During past period Bank of Mongolia supplied total of MNT 4 trillion into market and now it is time that we demand the results of those money supply and ask how many jobs have been created.\n\nWhile D.Boldbaatar, Director of the Monetary Policy and Research at the Bank of Mongolia replied with denial that Bank of Mongolia supplied total of MNT 3.3 trillion and that number never reached 4 trillion and 2 trillion those 3.3 trillion where directed at financing the 8 percent mortgage loans, as at that time GoM was not able to finance the program alone and BoM supplied money. And added that due to complications at Oyu Tolgoi 2700 employees were laid off alone, while the mining sector has seen downsizing of 50 thousand jobs, it was inevitable that BoM had to support the construction sector.\n\nMPP Reform Committee is convinced that resignation of BoM Governor N.Zoljargal will prevent any more malicious monetary policy. Also the critics have touched president as well.\n\nHead of the MPP Reform Committee B.Gankhuyag said: \"The nation is still tightening its belts. There is no direction in our economy.

Presently, Mongolia is receiving 20 percent of its total energy from Russia and China. The Minister mentioned that outstanding projects which have been talked about for several years have still not been implemented yet. As the prices for energy consumption have been regulated by the state power stations and energy distribution companies have been working with losses, the sector has faced difficulties and has not been able to renovate its technology.\n\nAs reported by the Minister of Energy, as of today, power stations are trading produced energy for 122 MNT, however, the cost without value added is 144 MNT, resulting in losses of 22 MNT per 1 kw/hour. As of 2014, the energy sector has faced losses of 68.5 billion MNT.\n\nThe consumption of energy is continuing to increase. In the past year, the number of businesses and households consuming electricity has increased by 35,000 and users of heating by 40,000.\n\nThe energy sector has declared 2015 the year of improving efficiency and decreasing expenses. With this goal, the energy sector is planning to save 17 billion MNT.

Banks are still charging the double fees as of now, hitting hard the borrowers:\n\n- Bank loan fees supposed to be one time charge only and of one type, whereas banks tend to misinterpret and mislead its customers as separate charges, which is an illegal action.\n\n- Above actions are seen as the conflict of interests and intended act of illegal overcharging of the customers.\n\n- Loan fees are interpreted as unpredictable charges, which have been set too high and derogatory in view of the customers rights, breaching the equality of the contract.\n\nAlthough Fair Competition and Consumer Agency has sent the notes on eliminating those violations nine commercial banks: Capitron Bank, Trade and Development Bank, Golomt Bank, Arig Bank, Khan Bank, Capital Bank, Chinggis Khaan Bank, Ulaanbaatar City Bank and Xac Bank have appealed the decision and the 20th Initial Administrative Court hearing, which took place on March 11th, ruled out in favor of Fair Competition and Consumer Agency.\n\nBank regulations for loans indicate the charge of fees equal to 1% of the total loan sum. Meaning, for a loan sized MNT10 billion bank will charge MNT10 million and for MNT20 billion fee will rise to MNT20 million for service charges.

Amcham will support the Prime Minister and other decision makers, and try to cooperate henceforth.\" More than 100 representatives of foreign and domestic companies gathered during the meeting.\n\nMost of the investors and entrepreneurs who were participating in the meeting wanted to know the current investment atmosphere in Mongolia, and what measures parliament is undertaking to improve the situation. Participators emphasised the case of the management of SouthGobi Sands, which sent a nightmarishly negative message to foreign investors. The Prime Minister said: \"Judicial departments must correct the incomprehensible court decrees and laws. In order to avoid such situations in the future, we shall discuss if need to make amendments to the tax law during the spring session. I am confident that we will not face situations like this again, because Mongolia is heading in the right direction.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister added that participation of private sector actors in the development of value added manufacturing will bring about success.

Now this is an issue for Mongolia as a whole. This is a social issue. We are not talking about women; we are talking about the political structure, and the Constitution of Mongolia.\n\nWe are talking about how the government is being supervised, how to change poor structure; we are presenting our suggestions regarding this and trying to find proper solutions.\n\nI have initiated an open discussion at the Civil Hall and gave a presentation and led a discussion regarding this topic.\n\nI would like to submit the draft law before the opening of the spring session of the Parliament.

I would like to invite female MPs whose hearts are dedicated to this issue to be included in a working group on domestic violence.\n\nLink to article\n\nLessons from Rio's Mongolian adventure\n\nBy Neil Hume and James Wilson\n\nHow to minimise the risks of joint ventures with governments\n\nMarch 13 (The Commodities Note, FT) If Rio Tinto could start again with Oyu Tolgoi, a $12.6bn copper and gold mine in Mongolia, what would it do differently?\n\nThe question is addressed in an academic paper that examines ways to reduce the risks resource groups take when investing in frontier markets.\n\nOT, which has already cost more than $6bn, is expected to be one of the biggest copper producers in the world and to last for decades. However, development has stalled as the Anglo-Australian mining group and the Mongolian government argue over how to pay for the second underground phase.\n\nRio is refusing to proceed until disagreements over cost overruns and taxes have been ironed out, while the cash-strapped Mongolian government wants to cut its 34 per cent equity stake in the project in return for higher royalties from the mine. (Mogi: not exactly, the royalty for equity swap is not retroactive)\n\nMuch is at stake for both sides. For Rio, the expansion of OT will bulk up its copper business and reduce its dependence on iron ore. For Mongolia, it needs cash quickly from the mine to meet spending commitments.\n\nSo what can be done to prevent this situation happening again? The paper, written by Henry Steel, a special adviser at Rio, and Stefano Gatti, of Bocconi University Milan, focuses on the investment agreement between Rio and the Mongolian government as a key source of tension.\n\nUnder the complex arrangement, the Mongolian government will not receive dividends from OT until a loan, used to finance its 34 per cent equity stake in the project, has been repaid. According to the report that could take almost 20 years. That is because the loan is being repaid using cash flow from the mine.\n\n\"This has been a great source of contention in Mongolia, where a dispute over the cost escalation has delayed the project, further exasperating the problem,\" says the paper, which has been reviewed by the Financial Times.\n\nIn fact it arguably renders the government's 34 per cent stake in OT close to worthless — and presumably explains why the Mongolian government is to keen to swap its stake for higher revenues and why Rio is not interested. (Mogi: again, not exactly, the royalty for equity swap is not retroactive)\n\nA spokesperson for Rio Tinto said: \"The document is an independent academic report. It was not commissioned, contributed to or reviewed by Rio Tinto and in no way represents the views of the company.\"\n\nTo better align interests the report examines a number of other approaches. One idea is to have host governments swap their project level equity for shares in the ultimate parent company of the developer - in this case Rio Tinto.\n\n\"Whilst the host government may not obtain great influence over a project through the holding of a minority position in top level equity, we believe that the benefits of such a proposal outweigh the losses of such a structure: a host government will no longer have to take on project risk,\" says the paper, titled \"Risk management for multinational corporations in high risk jurisdictions\".\n\n\"Further, using top level equity to acquire assets…would be preferable to a host government because the top level of cash flows consist of a more diversified portfolio of…assets, allowing an improved ability to plan a sustainable government budget,\" the paper says.\n\nTo prevent that government from selling its shares, the report says a lock-up period could be included as well as a clause that would allow the shares to be cancelled if the agreement is changed by the host government. This could be determined by an independent arbitrator.\n\nWhether sovereigns are willing to accept shares in a multinational mining company, where they would be exposed to stock market fluctuations and have no control over dividend policy, is open to question. Equally, mining companies would probably be wary of giving equity to host governments that cannot be prevented from selling their shares for ever.\n\nHowever, what the paper shows is two things: the import"
