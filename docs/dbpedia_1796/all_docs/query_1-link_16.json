        "text": "A Foul Won is defined when a player wins a Free Kick or Penalty for their team after being fouled by an opposing player.\n\nThere are no fouls won for a Handball, Dive, Back Pass, Illegal Restart, Dissent, GK 6-second Violation or Obstruction where a free kick is conceded.\n\nHandball – A deliberate handball by an opposition player.\n\nDive – A deliberate attempt for an opposition player to deceive the referee and win a Free Kick.\n\nBack pass – A Pass picked up by a goalkeeper when played from a teammate.\n\nIllegal restart – An opposition player has consecutive touches directly after a dead ball situation.\n\nDissent – A player shows dissent towards a match official.\n\nGK 6-second violation – A goalkeeper picks up the ball and holds onto it for longer than 6 seconds.\n\nObstruction – A player traps the ball between their legs to stop an opposition player from playing the ball.\n\nThe attempted delivery of the ball from one player to another player on the same team. A player can use any part of their body (permitted in the laws of the game), to execute a Pass. Event categorisation includes open play Passes, Goal Kicks, Corners and Free Kicks played as a Pass. Crosses, Keeper Throws, and Throw-ins do not count as a Pass. Opta adds a whole range of qualifiers to each Pass event, so that various things can be measured.\n\nChipped Pass – A lofted ball with an intended recipient. Must be over shoulder height and using the Pass height to avoid opposition players.\n\nHeaded Pass – A header when there is an intended recipient.\n\nLaunch – A long high ball into space or an area for players to chase or challenge for the ball.\n\nFlick-On – A glancing Pass with head or foot onto a teammate when the ball is helped on in the same general direction.\n\nPull Back – A Pass inside the penalty area which is pulled back.\n\nLay-Off – A first time Pass away from Goal when there is pressure on the passer (typically played by a forward) with one touch when they have their back to Goal from the Goal-line to the centre of the penalty area.\n\nThrough Ball – A Pass splitting the defence for a teammate to run on to.\n\nTap Pass – A short Pass after a dead ball situation which cannot have a lost outcome.\n\nEach Pass is logged with X and Y co-ordinates for its point of origin and destination.\n\nThis allows Opta to log the following:\n\nPasses broken down by area of the pitch for example, as own half/opposition half or defensive/middle/final third or left/right/centre.\n\nPasses broken down by distance, for example short/long, short medium/long.\n\nPass direction, for example backwards/sideways/forwards.\n\nIn summation the event-based nature of the data is such that you can calculate any combination. For example, a Chipped Pass over 20 yards, in the final third, that goes sideways.\n\nA Tackle is defined when a player connects with the ball in a legal, ground level challenge and successfully takes the ball away from the opposition player. The tackled player must be in controlled possession of the ball to be tackled by an opposition player.\n\nA Tackle Won is deemed to be when the tackler or one of their teammates regains possession because of the challenge, or that the ball goes out of play and is safe.\n\nA Tackle Lost is when a tackle is made but the ball goes to an opposition player.\n\nBoth are categorised as Tackles, but the outcome of the Tackle (won or lost) is different based on where the ball goes after the Tackle.\n\nA goalkeeper preventing the ball from entering the goal with any part of their body when facing an intentional attempt from an opposition player.\n\nSaves have the following attributes:\n\nBody Part – Hands/Feet/Body/Fist.\n\nSave Type – Caught/Collected/Parried Safe/Parried Danger/Fumble/Fingertip\n\nGoalkeeper Movement – Diving/Standing/Sliding/Reaching/Stooping\n\nThis includes unintentional or misplaced efforts on target from a goalkeeper’s own teammates, but only if the intervention is not perceived to be a routine collection of the ball.\n\nIf after a goalkeeper’s intervention, a more prominent defensive action from a teammate prevents the ball from entering the goal, this will be categorised as a Block for the teammate, not a Save for the goalkeeper.\n\nIf the ball goes behind the goal because of a goalkeeper intervention, the match officials must award a Corner for it to be recognised as a Save."
