Orsato joined the Russian Expert Refereeing Committee

Italian top referee Daniele Orsato ended his on-field career after Euro 2024 and joined the Expert Refereeing Committee of the Russian Football Union (RFU).

“Daniele Orsato will interact, like all other our experts, either by voting or through online activities. There is nothing new in this part. We are very glad that we managed to get him onboard. As soon as he finished his career, he agreed to cooperate with us. He may have had alternative proposals, but we managed to agree on cooperation, signing a contract for one season. We do not exclude the possibility to invite him in-person to our winter and summer gatherings. He was one of the top referees in the world and it is a pleasure to have a Champions League final referee in Russian football. I don't think anyone could question his reputation and professionalism. Based on the current number and quality of experts, we can say that we consider the composition of the Expert Refereeing Committee to be finalized. We are very satisfied with the results of our search for experts who cooperate with the RFU”, said Pavel Kamantsev, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Expert Refereeing Committee. The other members of the RFU Expert Refereeing Committee are Nestor Pitana (ARG), Ravshan Irmatov (UZB) and Cuneyt Cakir (TUR), while Milorad Mazic (SRB) is the full-time Head of the Russian Refereeing Department.

VAR changes in Premier League

The Premier League has launched a new X account @PLMatchCentre ahead of the start of the 2024/25 season. For the first time, the social media account will provide near-live explainers and updates on operational and officiating matters for every Premier League match. The account will post factual explanations of on-pitch refereeing decisions and the involvement of the video assistant referee, including the role of technology in the decision-making process. In the absence of live VAR audio being broadcast, as it is not permitted in football, the Premier League Match Centre will be able to relay on social media near-live information from the VAR Hub during a game. Premier League Match Centre – based at Stockley Park – is the operational hub of the League that helps with the smooth running of matchday operations of the competition. It is linked into all Premier League stadiums, the VAR Hub and broadcast partners around the world.

Ahead of the 2024/25 season, Tony Scholes, the Premier League’s Chief Football Officer, and Howard Webb, the PGMOL's chief refereeing officer, discussed the changes to VAR that will be in place for the campaign.

This season the Premier League is introducing a term, “Referee's Call”, when communicating about VAR. Can you explain?

Tony Scholes: One of the difficulties around VAR for the last couple of years is the lack of clarity as to when the VAR should or should not intervene. “Referee’s Call” really is just an introduction of a terminology to make it clear that the initial decision by the on-pitch official is critical. It’s similar to what exists in other sports like cricket and “Umpire’s Call”. The referee’s call should stand unless the VAR, based on readily available evidence, can see without doubt the on-pitch official has made a clear mistake. In the absence of that clear evidence, the referee’s call will stand.

Howard Webb: “Referee’s Call” is important because it helps manage people's expectations. We have situations that split opinion – and VAR can’t always provide definitive answers all the time, because the real world is not always correct or incorrect. So “Referee’s Call” clarifies the process to fans, managers and players – even if they disagree with the decision.

Will this approach help to reduce delays for VAR decisions?

Webb: I hope that having this clearly established threshold in place will mean the VARs can recognize quickly if something is or isn't clearly and obviously wrong.

Scholes: What I’d add is that we are doing what the game is telling us they want to see in this league. We did an extensive survey in the spring, where managers, football directors and captains told us they wanted to have a high bar for the VAR intervention. In pre-season we have been visiting clubs and they have been supportive of the new terminology. It makes sense to them.

Tell us more about semi-automated offsides and what we can expect?

Scholes: We hope to introduce it after one of the autumn international breaks, but it’s important to point out that we will only do it when PGMOL are 100 per cent confident, because ultimately, they're in charge of decision-making. They will have to be completely happy that the process works and improves things.

Webb: The biggest benefit of semi-automated offsides is around the efficiency of the process. We already believe our interventions around offside are accurate. The manual use of technology can take time, particularly in the more complicated situations. We're looking forward to making it quicker but retaining the accuracy. It's “semi-automated” because there still needs to be some validation on the outputs from the technology that the VAR will go through, such as the kick point being identified. The other big advantage is it will create graphics we can use in-stadium for fans and with broadcasters. This ability to see the offside, we believe, will give a better experience for people watching on TV and within the stadium.

Scholes: The introduction of semi-automated offside technology should not only reduce delays but also instill greater confidence in the whole process.

You have talked about trying to improve the fan experience around VAR in stadiums. What are you looking to do?

Scholes: Back in June, we said we would discuss with clubs about improving the fan experience in stadiums so that it can become as good as for those fans watching on TV. One way we will do this in 2024/25 is through offering more big-screen replays where there has been a delay to the match, not only for decisions overturned after a VAR intervention but also for those decisions confirmed by the VAR. PGMOL intend to pilot in-stadium announcements by referees in a competition at some point this season, but this is unlikely to be in the Premier League.

Are you changing your approach to communication of VAR decisions elsewhere?

Scholes: The Premier League Match Centre is going to be much more proactive this season in setting out on social media the factual basis of a decision that's been made, or the VAR intervention that's been done. The intention is that fans around the world and in stadium can see the factual basis of the decision they have seen on the pitch.

What changes are being made to added time?

Scholes: Last season, we added on every second from when the ball hit the back of the net until the restart. In 2024/25, we are not going to add on the first 30 seconds on that because 30 seconds is the natural time it would take the two teams to get back in position for the restarts after a goal.

Webb: It’s a benefit, especially when you think of the number of goals that were scored last year [a record 1,246]. Suddenly, if you've got eight goals in a match, you've automatically got four minutes added on the board. Listening to the game, there's a sense that was potentially excessive. So, it's been well received by everybody we've consulted with.

At the Euros, UEFA had a rule on only captains approaching referees - will that be implemented in the Premier League?

Webb: We watch all developments closely such as what happened at the Euros. As a game, we collectively worked hard last year on participant behaviour, speaking extensively with clubs, their players, and management teams and the importance of not surrounding officials as the power of example is strong for the next generations. We saw more yellow cards last season, but we knew we would because referees were empowered by the game and told not to turn a blind eye to certain behaviours. But international football is significantly different to the Premier League; they have 52 games, we have 380. We have a 10-month season. If we commit to something in August, we need to be confident it's deliverable in May. If we set a benchmark early in the season that we find it difficult to sustain, and we have to change, then we lose credibility.

Scholes: Last season we made a lot of significant changes which brought a rise in the number of yellow cards. The players’ response was extremely good, and the behaviour levels last season, and therefore the image of the game, was a significant improvement on previous seasons. It's passionate game. Yes, we want passion in there - but the players are role models as well.

If you had one wish to take place in the Premier League regarding the football, refereeing, VAR, what would you like?

Webb: I hope that people understand and accept what VAR can do and can’t do - and therefore, if they don't agree with the final decision, I don't want them to automatically see that as a failing of VAR. We need to do our part in ensuring that when clear errors are identified they are acted upon, and VAR does what it’s setting out to do - but people have tolerance and understanding of those areas where it can't create perfection because perfection doesn't exist.

Scholes: Last season’s Premier League was compelling, entertaining, competitive. So my wish would be that the football is at least as good as it was last year and that all of the talk is about the football. We need to ensure that VAR is operating as effectively as it can be so that everybody is talking about the football, not about refereeing or VAR decisions.

FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup 2024

The FIFA Referees Committee has announced the match officials who will officiate at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup Dominican Republic 2024, which will take place from 16 October to 3 November. A total of 38 female match officials, comprising 12 referees, 24 assistant referees and 2 support referees, will take charge of the matches. “We have selected a talented group of match officials, with the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup set to play a key role in their development. After the successful FIFA Women’s World Cup last year, we are already working on the FIFA Women’s World Cup Brazil 2027. Knowing that an important generational change in FIFA TEAM ONE will be necessary, this tournament will offer match officials who have the potential to be candidates for Brazil 2027 to work under the guidance of top FIFA refereeing instructors," said the chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee, Pierluigi Collina. "Additionally, we look forward to further trialling football video support, which offers a clear example of how FIFA is driving the use of technology to help referees.” Following the successful tests conducted at the Blue Stars/FIFA Youth Cup 2024 and the planned trial at the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup Colombia 2024, this year’s edition of the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup will be the third FIFA tournament to feature football video support (FVS). The trial follows numerous requests from FIFA member associations for an alternative, cost-effective way to use technology to support match officials. In response to those requests, FIFA has developed FVS, which, unlike the VAR system, does not use dedicated video match officials and therefore does not check all match-changing incidents. Instead, the onus falls on the respective head coaches, who will be allowed to make a limited number of review requests per match when they feel that a clear and obvious error has been made in match-changing incidents, such as goals, penalty decisions, direct red-card incidents or cases of mistaken identity. The players can also recommend that their coach request a review. (Source: FIFA)

Referee Kulbakov ended his career with many records in Belarus

The match of the 18th round of the national championship between Torpedo and Neman was the last for Aleksei Kulbakov, the most accomplished referee of Belarus in the 21st century.

Aleksei Kulbakov began to referee in 1996, at the age of 16, when he was periodically assigned matches in the championship of the Gomel region. Very soon, he was noticed by specialists, and his career quickly went uphill: in 1998, Aleksei (not yet 19 years old) was trusted with games of the championship of Belarus in the second division, in 2000 – first division, in 2001 - the national youth tournament and the Cup. In 1998, Kulbakov was in the first referee category and only four years later promoted to national level. In the spring of 2003, at the age of 23, his long-awaited debut in the highest league took place on 12 May at the Youth City Stadium. He received special compliments from the honorary coach of Belarus, Nikolai Blashko, who inspected that match, and therefore he soon received a second match, followed immediately by the third and so on. At that time, no one knew that a new star had risen in the domestic refereeing.

In May 2005, Kulbakov refereed his first Belarus Cup final at the capital stadium Dynamo. Around the same time started Aleksei's international career, that developed steadily. His first match outside Belarus was Portugal – Albania, at a youth tournament in January 2004. Kulbakov received his FIFA badge in 2006 and, since then, his name has never left the refereeing list of FIFA. He refereed his first European Cup match in June 2006 (Daugavpils – Torshavn), followed by his first match of national teams (Cyprus – San Marino) in September 2007.

In 2008, there was a breakthrough in the career of a rapidly progressing Belarusian: Kulbakov became one of the 19 participants of the UEFA program "Talents and Mentors" for promising European referees. Over the next two years, Aleksei refereed UEFA matches under the leadership of the referee observer Andreas Schluchter from Switzerland. Since the 2009-10 season, the Belarusian began to receive regular appointments in the group stage of the Europa League (first match CFR Cluj – FC Copenhagen). From the 2014-15 season, he began to referee matches in the group stage of the Champions League, with the debut on 9 December 2014 (Benfica - Bayer Leverkusen).

In 2006, Kulbakov was in the fourth category of UEFA referees, but advanced quickly: 2008 – Category 3, 2009 – Category 2, 2011 – Category 1. In June 2019, He was promoted to the Elite category, which includes the top 26 leading European referees. Kulbakov's track record includes European U-17 Championship 2006 in Luxembourg (including the match for the third place Spain - Germany), the European U-19 Championship 2013 in Lithuania (including the final France - Serbia), and the European U-21 Championship 2019. He was involved in Euro 2016 in France as a reserve referee in 8 matches. In 2020, when the pandemic was rampant around the world, Aleksei became a participant in a very interesting experiment - to obtain international experience, he refereed in foreign competitions, such as Saudi Arabia, Greece and Libya.

During his long career, Kulbakov, a 44-year-old native of Gomel, refereed 535 matches, where he awarded 142 penalty kicks and issued 1836 yellow cards, 32 second yellow cards and 40 red cards. Aleksei leads the Belarusian Referees Club, established by the "Pressball," which includes referees who completed at least 300 games of the highest category. In the second place, after Kulbakov, is the best Belarusian referee of the last century, Vadim Zhuk with 389 matches, followed by Sergey Shmolik with 344. From the current generation of referees, the most matches in the highest category have Viktor Shimusik (210) and Dmitry Dmitriev (201).

Kulbakov’s national matches: 330 in the top national division, 48 in the Belarus Cup, 4 in the Super Cup, 15 in foreign national competitions. International matches: 88 in European Cups (Champions League 21, Europa League 61, Conference League 4, Intertoto Cup 2), 36 games with the participation of national A teams and 14 with national youth teams. Out of his 88 European Cup matches, 42 were in the group stage (Champions League 14, Europa League 25, Conference League 3), wile 12 were in the Europa League knock-out stage. Kulbakov’s domestic records: six finals of the Belarusian Cup (2005, 2008, 2016, 2017, 2023, 2024) and four Super Cups (2017, 2018, 2020, 2022). He was recognized seven times as the best referee in Belarus (2004, 2008, 2010, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2023).

Roldan sent off Boca player after 9 seconds in Copa Sudamericana

Boca Juniors defender Luis Advincula was sent off after only nine seconds in his team’s Copa Sudamericana knock-out match against Brazil’s Cruzeiro on Thursday. Cruzeiro advanced to the quarter-finals of the tournament after a 5-4 win in a penalty shootout.

The 34-year-old Peruvian right-back received the red card from veteran referee Wilmar Roldan after stepping with his right foot on the ankle of Cruzeiro’s Lucas Romero, who screamed in pain, but managed to continue playing. Advincula left the Mineirao Stadium in tears as his teammates tried to comfort him. Cruzeiro won the match 2-1, which forced the penalty shootout after Boca’s 1-0 win in the first leg. The Brazilian club will take on Paraguay’s Libertad in the next round of the tournament.

Soares Dias: “I had planned my retirement differently, but some events changed the way it was announced”

Artur Soares Dias hangs his whistle after more than 500 games in Portugal. More than 700 in total, if we add his international matches. At 45 years old, the referee from Porto leaves the field, but not football. In the first interview since the announcement, Artur Soares Dias went with A Bola to the former Portucel factory, in Viana do Castelo, where he worked until 2012, when he decided to stop being Director of Human Resources to become a professional football referee. An exclusive journey through a career full of tremendous challenges, but one that fills with pride the son of Manuel Soares Dias, also a former referee.

- Why did you choose to speak for the first time about the end of your referee career here at former Portucel, in Viana do Castelo?

- We are normal people, we have families, we have children, we are parents and so it is always good to show what is beyond that person that everyone sees on the field. And so I think it's good to show us in this reality. I was very happy here. It was here that I spent many of my youth years after college. I took over the management of Human Resources when I was only 24 years, with 310 employees and a budget of 11.4 million euros to manage. It was one of my biggest challenges, being able to lead a company of such a large size.

- As a Human Resources director, you had to negotiate, hire people and fire others. Among these collaborators some have certainly called you a lot of things, but not the bad words that football has made you known. No one called you corrupted here...

- It is true. One of the least rewarding areas of Human Resources is having to fire people. I was very resilient because I argued that dismissal should be the last measure to happen. They surely didn’t call me corrupt, unlike what happened on these football fields. But they may have called me something else, but I didn't know, did I? In the final part of my career, there was always a great respect for my experience, an understanding of the mistakes I made - and I made many of them, unfortunately - but they knew that they were human, and because they were human were acceptable. It was always very gratifying.

- But you dealt with frequent insults...

- I confess that we, when we are on the field, because of concentration, of the focus on what is the most important, which is to make good decisions, we are far aside from what everyone else perceives. Another thing is the insult on the streets, the gratuitous insult, the cheap insult. This is more difficult to digest, because we all have the right to our privacy, respect, and they were the most difficult times. Although, the result of what my career was, recognition, in particular in recent years, was easier. There were more selfies, words of encouragement, not to give up and continue. In the recent past, there was more and more of this, because some people began to realize that the end was near.

- I was at this former Portucel when, in 2010, you became an international referee and two years later you decided to be a full-time professional referee. How did you make the decision to abandon this life for the love of refereeing?

- I had two moments in my life that were the hardest to make decisions. One, surely, was in 2012, when, after a trip I made between Viana do Castelo and Porto, I heard a song from Antonio Variacoes that we all know – “Mude of life if you do not live satisfied...” [singing] I started working at 8:30 and could only leave from here a few times at eight o’clock at night, I arrived home very tired, still trained and the day after I was here again. I came home many times exhausted and found myself thinking that was not life. I had a huge passion for refereeing and the pressure I felt on the field. Oh, I love it. Resilience is one of the names that accompanies me. I believe that passion is essential to success. At that moment, I decided to go after my passion and I thought I would make it. I was going to make it to the Olympic Games, where no Portuguese referee had gone before. When I decided to be a professional referee, I decided to train, prepare, dedicate, strive to get there. It was not easy. I already had children and when I left the business world for some “biting”, as they said, it was not easy. We are not valued, we are not treated well... My father often said: “Boy, no one can serve two masters well.” I had a very big gentleman who is this [former Portucel] and another even bigger master who was football. I decided on the passion to manage 22 players, and my perspective was to conquer the world. It was to go out there to show that Portugal has top referees and has quality to show. The refereeing in Portugal is good.

- But from 2012 until today we continue to question the quality of refereeing...

- I believe there is background work to be done, there are mentalities to be changed and new perspectives to be given. There is new blood to enter, and I believe that there is a lot of work to be done in this matter because I think the value is here and we will be able to easily reach that level, if we can show the value that exists. It is a hard way, it will be a difficult path, but with everyone involved, including the leaders who are equally very mistreated, we will succeed. If it were not for the vision of these leaders to make good investments in certain referees and to develop the infrastructure this would be worse. I think there's little recognition.

- Not all football problems start and end with refereeing?

- That’s for sure, but it’s hard to have that perception, it’s true. If we all sit at a table, reflect... football is an industry, it is a business that gives something to all of us, if it is valued in the same way. It's time that we all think together.

- If the referees speak more often, would that help?

- I often say that communication is essential. Let’s go to what’s more basic: if we don’t talk to our children in a right way, if we don’t interact with them and if we don’t explain them the world, most likely they’re not. We have to communicate all. We must not be afraid to say, “I have erred, now help me not to err anymore.” We will create conditions that facilitate their work. Let's build it, it's easy. Let's share ideas.

- There were games where you wished to be the Human Resources director who called the players to speak openly as you couldn’t do as a referee?

- One of the most valued issues in refereeing is the body language, it is communication without verbalizing, but it is very difficult, because we will not stop the game because the fans want to see the game going on. But I loved it. The worst feeling I had in my life as a referee was to get home and realize that I was wrong, that I hurt someone, and then not being able to have the opportunity to change it. I had the habit of going to see what went well and what went wrong in the game. Let me send a word to the younger ones: help us to be better. Since I made this decision, I have received hundreds of messages, many of them from young people asking for videos to motivate them, something that has made me astonished. To think that I'm an idol for some people... I thought about it. There is a big shortage of referees. There are games that go not played due to lack of referees and we all have to help those 17- and 18-year-olds who want to start. We have to motivate them, so a word of appreciation to these young people who are resilient to be able to build the Soares Dias of the future. I wish you have an easiest life than I had. I remember when I was appointed to a derby I thought before whether I would survive or if it was going to be the end of my career. We know that our success or failure is at a second, a penalty, a red card. Fortunately, I managed to survive 20 years and many derbies and classics. Now with VAR you don't die in a second anymore, because we have someone who helps us make, and review, the best decision.

- Did you decide to be a referee because you were the son of the former referee Manuel Soares Dias?

- No. My father contradicted my wishes, because he knew well how difficult it was to be a football referee, and during his time it was worse. At this moment, it is much easier because there was a huge evolution in refereeing, at all levels; the result of the work of all people who were involved in refereeing, but at the time of my father it was very difficult and therefore he never encouraged me.

- How did the refereeing bug get into you?

- Look, I was a kid. I was 15 years old when I went with my father to a game in the old Estádio da Luz, full, and I remember perfectly entering those very narrow tunnels and having noticed the emotions, feeling the enormous pressure that was in that place. I found it cute, as a result of my young age, not knowing what I was going to get into.

- How did you say to Manuel that you were going to be a referee too?

- I’m a father and I know that parents want better for their children. We try to refer them to what we think is the best way for them, but we all have the right to experience anything, good and bad. He tried to discourage me but could not convince me and then became my greatest support and it was with him that I managed to get here.

- He died early in 2009 and did not have a real sense of the level his son reached...

- This is one of my greatest heartbreaks... I often joked with him and told him, “Father, I’m going to pass you in two years”. He replied, “You are judging now”. I have always defended the name Soares Dias. It’s one of the things I like most, it’s the respect I have in it, it’s what I consider most. It is a constant struggle to dignify it.

- You have a son and a daughter whom you have always protected from everything that was said?

- I tried to protect them to the fullest. Some stories are very difficult. My son came home and said, as he told me a few times, fortunately very few, that a classmate at the school told him that his father was a thief... hearing this from an eight- or nine-year-old. This comes from the lack of education, the lack of principles and values that is given at their home. Unfortunately, this happens, but I tried to protect my children. The only thing I taught them was: “When someone says a comment about your father, just say that your father is the best at what he does. Then ask them if their father is as good as yours. If their father is as good as yours, he'll be a very respected person, because your father is very good at what he does”.

- At some point you thought of quitting?

- Lots of times I found myself many nights wondering “what am I doing here?”

- Did anyone try to bribe you?

- Not really. Perhaps there have been attempts, but they have not been materialized. When we're talking about bribes, we're talking about giving a tracksuit when I started and was only a kid. But if we cut right away with these little things, like a workout pass or a lunch, people soon would know that you’re not going to do it.

- So that idea that they are all corrupt, they are all sold, is it pure invention?

- I believe so. In my case, it is pure invention. In society there are serious and less serious people. I'm not saying that others do or don't. I speak for myself and will always defend myself. I also believe that my colleagues in the first category do not have anything to do with this. I believe in their seriousness. I believe they are examples to follow for society, just like me.

- In 2017 you lived perhaps the worst moment of your career, at Maia’s training center. Were you threatened by a cheerleader?

- I'm glad you mentioned this. At Maia there were two 20-year-old kids who spent their time on the street and when they saw me, before the game Pacos de Ferreira-FC Porto, they said: “If you don’t behave well tomorrow, we’ll take care of your health.” I have received messages like these dozens of times. Even recently I got messages during the night threatening me. This is the life of a referee. However, that was only one in a thousand contacts. What is certain is that a story has been created around it, intentionally, in the sense of manipulating society, manipulating the masses. The facts occurred but were presented in the media on a larger scale. But do me a favor: mediatize all others, because there are many more. Create conditions so they do to happen. This is essentially because of education of the fans, creating conditions for families to go to the stadiums, children to go to stadiums with their parents, which happens less and less. I always say that when there is a problem, there is a cause.

- You have refereed three Euro 2024 matches. Why didn't you announce the end of your career when you returned from Germany?

- When Roberto Rosetti, the head of UEFA refereeing, said goodbye to me, I told him that I had finished my career. This decision was communicated to him and to all other leaders of Portuguese refereeing. I had planned to finish my career at 45 and that’s what I did.

- But why did we only find out about it on the eve of the Saudi Super Cup?

- There are circumstances of our lives that we do not control. I had planned it differently, thinking that the end of my career would be communicated in a structured, planned way. This structure, this plan, existed and exists, but we have had some events in-between that I think were not well managed. They made the news come out in a way that is not compatible with a career like mine, but life is like that. There are unforeseen events, and we just need the ability to relativize them and keep moving forward.

- After all this you refereed the Saudi Super Cup.

- I was very well received by Jorge Jesus, Luís Castro and Ronaldo, Ruben Neves, Otavio. It was fantastic.

- Why did you end your career with the Saudi Super Cup and not the Portuguese Super Cup?

- The president of the committee makes the appointments, and he considered that it was good for another colleague to be appointed. I think they should bet on the future of Portuguese refereeing.

- Is it without a heartache?

- None with anyone, even those who have hurt me. I thank them too, because they were the gasoline for my career.

- You are seen as the successor of Pedro Proença. When he leaves the League and heads to other roles, and it is said that the Portuguese Football Federation may be next for him, can you succeed him in the League?

- Fortunately, I can be anything, but it’s not anything I’m going to be. I will continue in sport, certainly, and in football in particular. I have a profile and knowledge that allows me to be in several roles and I have already been challenged to various possibilities. I have given a lot to refereeing, but the refereeing cycle has come to an end. I am sure I can bring value to football in some way.

- I see you as someone ready to work in football, but not just refereeing. Is that it?

- I have the same vision, but I think it’s still premature to close any door. I am not available for anything, but I am available to serve football. That will be the way.

- Is there still much to do in football?

- There is, definitely; new blood is needed in the organizations, and I feel like I have that blood. And I believe I can be an asset.

- Are there any doors open outside?

- The doors are open. But I'm still living the end of my referee career. It's still bubbling. The path will be found with clairvoyance. Now I need to relax. After so many weekends living football, I need to pay attention to my children.

- So, you won’t watch a lot of football, nor the matches of your colleagues?

- I need to rest from refereeing at this time.

- Refereeing gave you more friends or more enemies?

- My career was much better than I thought. Going to two European Championships, a World Cup, Olympic Games... Last year I was elected among the 25 best referees in the world. I never imagined this in my life, it was fantastic. I owe a lot to refereeing, it made me know the world. I'm grateful. I appreciate it.

- Which player did you like the most? Was there any?

- There were several. I can talk about one. Or two of them. Or better three. Pepe, who is a great person. There's that whole show on the field. Outside the field, he shows good education, fantastic attention, respect... I value this a lot. Renato Sanches: in a game in Russia, without asking him anything, knocking on the door and handing me a shirt of his team. Because I was Portuguese, and he liked my refereeing. Incredible! These things mark me. Bernardo Silva, for the same reasons. Incredible values. Even on the field, distinct from others. But there are more... these principles must be valued.

- The best leader?

- We have several. Those who are able to acknowledge their mistake, which has happened several times. As the result of the emotion, they feel ended up spilling over what was normal and some had the competence and principles of recognizing the error and apologizing. The leaders in Portugal should be more valued, for what they give to football. All are determined and I thank them for having put me on and even when I made mistakes, they always had the right way to tell me about them.

- The most difficult coach on the bench?

- Some go extra miles, more than others, but as I like the positive characters, I remember Jorge Jesus, who was kind enough to give me a shirt and applaud my refereeing. This is what I value and thank for.

- As a 45-year-old who ended your career as international referee, what do you ask for?

- I have everything. I'm not missing anything.

- What about the controversial video in the Povoas pool, in which you are seen by the pool, close to Pinto da Costa, former president of FC Porto?

- I landed in Saudi Arabia, and I was surprised by a video, which I didn’t even know that existed, and with the communication of the end of my career. It was all precipitated in the wrong way and it doesn’t make sense what happened. I have a right as a person - and I cannot dissociate, because I must have respect, education and principles - to be with friends. And I was invited to go to a party of a friend, Dr. Fernando Povoas, to go to his house with the family to see the animals. It was the first time I went there. And I was surprised by the presence of other people, among them Pinto da Costa”, he explains.

- If it were today, would you go again?

- I would perhaps think about going or not going, to protect myself, because it is certain that we are talking about a former referee and a former president who met at a private event. If I knew he was there, I wouldn't go. We have to protect ourselves a lot because society doesn't see this with good eyes. I never depended on club officials, so it was not now that I would need it. Not because he is Pinto da Costa, but because he is a leader or former leader of a club.

- Tiago Martins came up with the idea that “there are unjust cards to show.” You showed many cards throughout your career and one of them was showed to Jurgen Klopp in a Europa League match between Liverpool and Sparta Prague.

- He’s a football lord and, after showing him the card, he apologized to me for the attitude and told me that I was absolutely right. The ability to recognize error is not for everyone.

- In the final of the UEFA Conference League and in your last game, the Saudi Super Cup, you had Tiago Martins as VAR.

- Tiago Martins was one of the people, among others, very important in my career. I remember that in 2018, when FIFA asked me if there was any Portuguese to act as VAR, I indicated Tiago. Fortunately, I was right, because he has demonstrated his competence.

First EPL female referee Welch announces her retirement

The Premier League's first female referee Rebecca Welch has announced her retirement from her on-field career to take up a managerial role within PGMOL. Welch made history on a number of occasions as a match official, becoming the first woman to referee EFL and Premier League fixtures, while she was consistently entrusted on the international stage with regular appointments to major tournaments as well as being chosen to referee the UEFA Women’s Champions League final in May. She has decided to hang up her whistle after successfully coming through a competitive recruitment process to become the manager of the Select Group Women’s Professional Game, with the aim to support and develop the growing pool of Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship officials as well as continuing to inspire the next generation of officials. “I’m incredibly grateful for the support, guidance and opportunities I’ve been given during an unforgettable time on the field,” Welch said. “I’ve loved working alongside some great people and officials from all over the world – refereeing has given me so much including many amazing memories and I hope to continue to see more youngsters take advantage of the growing opportunities which are there for everyone.” She added: “I’m now excited by my new challenge and giving back to the game I love in a new capacity. There’s a real focus on the pathway and development at PGMOL and, alongside a great team already in place, I’m eager to help drive that culture of high-performance, offering my experience and support in developing officials within the women’s game.”

Welch began her refereeing journey in 2010, initially balancing this alongside her career in the NHS. Since becoming a full-time match official in 2019, Welch’s pathway has been marked by numerous historic achievements. In 2021 she became the first woman to referee an EFL match, taking charge of Harrogate Town v Port Vale, a feat which she backed up by refereeing matches in the Championship and the third round of the men’s FA Cup. These all preceded her Premier League debut in December 2023 as the world’s eyes watched her whistle Fulham v Burnley at Craven Cottage. Welch’s impressive resume solidifies her position as a leading light in women’s refereeing, having also overseen the Women’s FA Cup final in both 2017 and 2020. She was on the FIFA International List of Match Officials from 2015, and her talents were further recognised by UEFA in 2020 when she was chosen for the Elite Women’s List. Since then, Welch has officiated on some of football’s biggest stages, including the 2022 UEFA Women’s EUROs, the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, the 2024 UEFA Women’s Champions League final and, most recently, the Paris 2024 Olympics women’s football tournament where she concluded the final game of her career as fourth official for the Gold Medal Match. Welch’s illustrious list of achievements will see her officially inducted into the National Football Museum’s Hall of Fame in due course.

Champions League referees suspended for five months after stealing road sign and being taken to drunk tank

The Polish referees who nicked a road sign hours before a crucial Champions League clash have been banned for five months. Bartosz Frankowski and Tomasz Musial were removed from VAR duties for the Glasgow Rangers vs Dynamo Kyiv match after the incident. Local outlet TVP Sport say the Polish FA have banned them from matches for five months, with a further seven suspended. Experienced referee Frankowski was initially appointed as VAR, with Musial backing him up as assistant VAR.

TVP Sport reported that the duo and a third individual were caught by police allegedly stealing a road sign in the early hours of the morning. It claimed the trio were arrested at 1.43am for "destroying road infrastructure." The men, who were reported as being intoxicated, were then taken to a sobering-up centre - which will cost them money as police charge for use. Drunks tanks are used in many European countries when the crime is deemed not serious enough to be banged up in a cell. Senior Superintendent Kamil Golebiowski said: "At around 1:40am we received a report of three men carrying a road sign down the street. Police officers were dispatched to the scene. All of the men were intoxicated and had over 1.5 per milligrams of alcohol in their blood. They were taken to a sobering-up centre." As always for UEFA matches, the refereeing team was confirmed 48 hours before the match. Lithuanian referee Donatas Rumsas was confirmed to be leading the officials. Frankowski and Musial were listed as his VAR officials but were taken off the listing. Instead, fellow top flight Polish official Tomasz Kwiatkowski became the VAR, with Pawel Malec as his assistant. Frankowski, 37, is one of the top referees in Poland and an experienced international official. FIFA-listed for 10 years, he was an official at Euro 2020 and Euro 2024 - acting as VAR in the latter.

The Polish FA have also published a statement, which reads: "The Committee decided to:

- Recognise the liability of Bartosz Frankowski and Tomasz Musiał for the alleged act;

- Impose a basic penalty on each of the accused referees - one year suspension: each referee will serve the mandatory suspension of five months, while the execution of the remaining part of the penalty, i.e. seven months, is suspended for a probation period of two years;

- Additionally impose a fine of PLN 25,000 (£4,000) on each of the referees."
