        "text": "Catherine II the Great (born Sophie Friederike Auguste of Anhalt-Zerbst) came to power following the overthrow of her husband Peter III on 28 June 1762.\n\nOn 13 September 1762, she entered Moscow solemnly under the sounds of bells and canons. The streets of the first capital city were decorated with garlands, carpets and tapestry, the thick green spruce and numerous flowers.\n\nThe coronation of Catherine II took place in the Assumption Cathedral on 22 September 1762. The coronation regalia and headdresses of the new Russian Empress Catherine II were exposed for 18 days in ‘the former Senat chambers by the Chernigovsky Cathedral’. A new crown was created by goldsmith G.F. Ekart,court jeweller J. Pauzié, jewel-setter Orote, goldsmiths I. Estifeev and I. Lipman, apprentice I. Nikiforov and attracted the visitors most of all. At that time, the price of all precious stones of the crown amounted to 2 million rubles. A new orb also by G.F. Ekart was created in the shortest possible time. Obviously, there was a fear that the master would not manage the orb in time while the works on it had begun only on 7 September and on 14 September three orbs were brought from the Armoury Chamber to the apartment of Her Imperial Majesty. One of it was returned the same day, the second one of ‘Greek workmanship’ (belonged to Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich) – the next day after the coronation with a gilded handle fitted to it; and the third one – on 11 May 1763. Three mantles, one made of brocade and two of laces, which the Empress wore on the first and second days of audiences after the coronation, were exposed together with the coronation dress of Catherine II made of silver brocade and decorated with the coats of arms of the Russian Empire.\n\nAll dames must have come to the coronation wearing ‘the robe ronde of the patterned fabric’, while the cavaliers of Orders of St. Andrew the First-Called and St. Alexander Nevsky must have worn the order’s garments. With such a background the attire of the Empress looked especially impressive, it created a triumphal image of the imperial power. The representatives of the brightestroyal families of Europe gathered at the court to celebrate this historical event.\n\nOn 22 September at about 10 a.m. a solemn procession moved to the Assumption Cathedral followed by the sounds of trumpets and kettle-drums. The monarchess was at that time in her inner apartments of the palace and prepared for the sacred mystery: the anointing and the Eucharist. She came out to the audience-kammer, where the prepared regalia were waiting. After the holy water was sprinkled on the royal way, the procession started from the Red Porch to the Assumption Cathedral. The Empress went under the canopy, wearing a brocade dress with golden lace and embroidered two-headed eagle.\n\nMore than twenty prelates, forty archimandrites and other clergy led by Archbishop Demetrius of Novgorod met Catherine by the Cathedral’s doors. Heading the clergy, Catherine moved towards theRoyal doors, where she kissed the holy icons and then ascended a throne and sat on the prepared imperial chair. First, she put on the purple mantle and the Order of Andrew the First-called, then she took the crown and put it on herself. At the same time canons on Red Square shoot. Then, there followed the congratulations and Archbishop Demetrius of Novgorod addressed Her Imperial Majesty with a congratulatory speech after which he led a ceremony of anointing Catherine with chrism. Later Catherine went through the Royal Doors to the Lord’s table and therepartook of the Eucharist.\n\nWhen the Empress left the Assumption Cathedral, ‘all the army and all the numerous people exclaimed “Hurrah”’. The shouting had been continuing for an hour till the Empress gave a sign to start the procession. In the Archangel and Annunciation Cathedrals upon the ancient tradition, Catherine bowed before the ashes of the ancestors and kissed the most venerated icons and relics; then she returned to the palace. During her procession in Kremlin the regiments laid down the banners and saluted with music and drumbeat; people cried ‘hurrah’ and the noise and cheerful exclamations ‘seemed to move the air’, besides, silver and gold coins were thrown to the people all the way the Empress went. In the audience-hall, the Empress declared her favours mainly to those, who showed devotion when she ascended the throne, and to those, whose courage marked them during the recent Prussian war. Then the gala dinner in honour of the Holy coronation of Empress Catherine II took place in the Faceted Chamber.\n\nIn the evening the Kremlin was illuminated and the Muscovites gathered to see this ‘fire spectacle’. At midnight Catherine came down to Red Square in disguise to enjoy the illumination, but peoplepegged her and saluted with loud ‘hurrah’ until she went back to her apartments. This time the feast was arranged not only on the Cathedral Square but on Red Square as well. Coronation celebrations ran on for seven days."
