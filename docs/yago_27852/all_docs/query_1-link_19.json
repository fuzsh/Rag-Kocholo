        "text": "Suppose Empress Elizabeth chooses a different lady to be the wife of Peter.\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]The choice of Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste of Anhalt-Zerbst as a bride for the Grand Duke Peter was not coincidental, accidental or fortuitous.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Sofia was not rich, she was not beautiful, she did not belong to an important royal house.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]However, for the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna Romanova, the family from which comes the future bride is very important. Sophie Friederike was daughter of Christian August, co-ruler of the insignificant principality of Anhalt-Zerbst, and Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp, great-granddaughter of a king of Denmark. But the Empress was linked by kinship, as well as by affection, with the House of Holstein.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]\n\nFor the Tsar Peter I Romanov the victory of Poltava in 1709 was a great triumph military, political and diplomatic. The sovereigns of Europe were hasten to propose new treaties and alliances with the Tsar.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Peter I of Russia took advantage of this rebirth of the Russian diplomatic relations with the westerners sovereigns to give life to a new marriage policy; but at that time no foreign monarch had seen the slightest benefit to intermarry with the Russian royal house, whose importance on the political scene international was considered negligible.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Since 1707 Peter had made contact with the German house of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel with the hope of persuading the Duke Anton Ulrich to give his niece Carlotta Cristina as wife at the Tsarevich Aleksej Petrovič Romanov, but negotiations had gone for long because the duke was in no hurry to see his grandson married heir of a monarch who was about to be dethroned by the King of Sweden. The obstacles to the marriage had disappeared suddenly after Poltava. The wedding is finally celebrated the sunday 14 October 1711 in Torgau, in the castle of the Queen of Poland.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]The second marriage \"stranger\" that Peter the Great was able to agree on is that between his niece Anna Ivanovna Romanova, daughter of Ivan V, and the young Duke of Courland and Semigallia Frederick III Wilhelm von Kettler, grandson of Frederick I of Prussia. Anna's marriage was important because it was the first Russian princess to marry a foreigner for more than two hundred years, and was the recognition by Europe of the new status of Russia: from now on Peter and his successors could have Russian princesses to intervene in European dynastic complex business.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]The second great journey of Peter the Great in the West takes place in 1716-17, nineteen years after the \"Big Embassy\", and it was an opportunity to attend to a new marriage of a Russian princess. The sister-in-law of the Tsar, Praskovia Feodorovna Saltykova widow of Ivan V, is fond of Peter and agrees that his daughters are married for political purposes to strengthen the German alliances of Russia. After Anna, now is the time of Catherine Ivanovna Romanova, whom he married on 19 April 1716 in Gdansk the already twice widower Duke Charles Leopold of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the Duke of Mecklenburg is described as «a lout tyrannical despots and one of the most well-known» (E.Schuyler, Peter the Great), who having need of a powerful protector for his weak state, he sees in marriage with a Russian princess a useful way to get behind the tsar: being aware that two of the grandchildren of Peter are still unmarried and already a widow, not worrying about what he will be given in marriage, it sends an engagement ring in St. Petersburg with a marriage in which the name of the candidate is left blank. Is chosen the twenty-four Catherine. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]In 1722, Peter the Great 's daughters are of marriageable age. They received the typical education of European princesses, which consists in language, etiquette and dance , from the time of his visit to France, the Tsar hoped to marry one of his daughters , presumably Elizabeth, the child king Louis XV, or, at least, a prince of the royal house of France to be named king of Poland. Philippe d' Orléans, Regent of France, it seems tempted by the idea: Poland would be a useful ally behind Austria,and the prince more suited to encircle the crown is certainly his son the Duke of Chartres. Unfortunately for them there is a big obstacle: Augustus of Saxony still occupied the Polish throne Although it was not his \"friend\", Peter is not going to dethrone him. Proposes that the Duke of Chartres marry the princess at once, ensuring its support for the election to the throne of Poland after the death of Augustus. The Regent prefer to wait until the child has surrounded the Polish crown before entering into marriage. The French have some hesitation in more , about the obscure origins of the mother of the princesses and the mystery surrounding the date of the wedding of Tsar that raises questions about the legitimacy of his daughters... [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Since March 1721 is in Russia Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, grandson of the ancient enemy Charles XII of Sweden, who without any direct heirs if it was kept as close as was his successor, but never designate it as such, and the king of Sweden also had a sister still living, Ulrika Eleonora, married to Frederick of Hesse-Kassel, brother in law that he considered it one of his top advisers and commanders. When in November 1718 Charles XII, who has followed the nephew and brother in law, finds death in Norway during the Siege of Fredriksten, Ulrika Eleonora, following the signs of her husband, self-proclaimed queen, and arrested immediately who the opposes. The young Charles Frederick is still too saddened by the loss of his uncle to take care of asserting his rights to the throne when he does it is too late.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Denmark has meanwhile occupied the northern part of the duchy of Holstein-Gottorp and scored with a treaty that Sweden does not support more military pretensions of the young duke, who is now in St. Petersburg with the hope of winning the support of Tsar possibly sealing the whole thing with the marriage with one of his daughters. The condition of Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp improves in 1724: it is recognized as heir of Sweden, is granted him the title and the treatment of \"Royal Highness\" and income, as well as insurance to take an interest in Russian and Swedish King of Denmark for the return of its territories of Holstein. Since his position became regular, on 21 May 1725, in Trinity Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Charles Frederick married the Tsar's daughter Anna Petrovna Romanova.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]In 1724, Peter appointed his wife as \"Tsarina\" and he associates her to the government of Russia. Peter died in 1725 without having appointed a successor and inviting the regiments of the Imperial Guard to proclaim Catherine sovereign of Russia with the title of \"Empress\". The concern of a mother is to see the other daughter also joined in marriage.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Elizabeth Petrovna Romanova is betrothed to Charles Augustus of Holstein-Gottorp, recently succeeded his father as Prince of Eutin and Prince-Bishop of Lübeck, first cousin of Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]But Charles Augustus of Holstein-Gottorp dies of smallpox on 31 May 1727 in St. Petersburg where he went to meet his girlfriend.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp succeeded his brother Charles Augustus as the Lutheran Prince-Bishop of Lübeck and Prince of Eutin.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]At the end of the Russo–Swedish War of 1741–1743, also known as the Hats' Russian War, the Imperial Russian Army had occupied most of Finland, and the Russian politicians aspired to move the Swedish border considerably to the north, thus reducing the danger of Swedish attack on St Petersburg. As soon as hostilities ceased, the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna Romanova would have wanted that the Russian Forces occupied the Sweden in order to ensure the peace negotiations, but this plan aroused the vehement opposition of the Swedish representatives and was abandoned. The sudden collapse of Sweden had come as a disagreeable surprise to the Court of Versailles. Obtaining the best possible terms for a discomfited Sweden, was now the main object of the French diplomatists. With the Treaty of Åbo, Sweden ceded to Russia the areas east of the Kymi River with the fortress of Olavinlinna and the towns of Lappeenranta and Hamina. Hence, the Swedish border was moved to the north.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]On the other hand, the Swedes, in order to please and to appease the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna Romanova, agreed to elect Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, her relative, as the Crown Prince. This move exposed the country to the risk of war against Denmark, hence the Baltic Fleet sailed to Stockholm to protect the Swedish capital in case of Danish attack. The treaty marked the further decline of Sweden as a great power in Northern Europe.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp, mother of Sophie Friederike Auguste, was the sister of Charles Augustus and Adolf Frederick. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]No wonder that the Empress has therefore sought the bride of Grand Duke Peter in the House of Holstein, whom she knew, she had largely supported, and which was closely relative of his nephew Peter.[/FONT]\n\nJuliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern, although it is a very interesting figure for her character and for how she acted like Queen of Denmark, would never have been taken into account because she was the sister of Prince Antony Ulrich of Brunswick-Lüneburg, husband of Grand Duchess and Regent of Russia Anna Karlovna Leopoldovna, and father of the the baby Tsar Ivan VI Antonovich, dethroned and imprisoned by the coup d'état of Elizabeth Petrovna Romanova![/FONT]\n\nSuppose Elizabeth settles on Princess Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal. Charlotte Amalie (1730-1801) was the daughter of Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Philippsthal.\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]WHY, FOR WHAT REASON the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna Romanova would have to choose the Princess Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal???[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]You may not think that a princess is fine for a hypothetical marriage just because it has the right age for it! You can not randomly choose a princess for a wedding. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Behind every marriage (or marriage proposal) were complicated decisions and special interests, which led to make certain choices and not other choices. You can not shoot at random. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]As alternative to Sophie Friederike Auguste as a wife for the Grand Duke Peter, we could consider the Princess Ulrike Sophie of Hesse-Homburg (1726–1792). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Ulrike Sophie was the daughter of the Prince Casimir William of Hesse-Homburg (1690-1726), granddaughter of the Princess Louise Elisabeth Kettler of Courland (1646–1690), great-granddaughter of Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland (1610-1662), therefore she was a relative of Duke Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler of Courland, husband of Anna Ivanovna Romanova [daughter of the Tsar Ivan V and cousin of the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna Romanova].[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, sans-serif]Moreover Ulrike Sophie was the first-cousin of Louis John William Gruno, Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Homburg (1705-1745), Russian Field Marshal, husband of Princess Anastasia Trubezkaya (1700-1755), sister of Ivan Ivanovich Betskoi or Betskoy (1704-1795), General Major and Russian school reformer. Betskoy was actively involved in the coup d'etat that brought Elizaveta Petrovna to the Russian throne. Due to the Betskoy's friendly terms with Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp, there were rumours that Sophie Friederike Auguste was his biological daughter.\n\n[/FONT]"
