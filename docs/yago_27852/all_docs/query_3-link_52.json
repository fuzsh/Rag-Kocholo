        "text": "Peter I's 1722 Law of Succession should be evaluated in the context of this Romanov family feud. Traditionally, the 1722 law has often been understood as a moment in the story of the fitful relationship between Peter the Great and his son from his first marriage, Aleksei Petrovich. And for good reason: In 1718, Peter the Great found ample cause to disinherit, try and convict, and then cause the death of his son and heir presumptive. The betrayal of Tsarevich Aleksei is prominently mentioned in Peter's Law-his \"wickedness\" is likened to that of Absalom, the treasonous son of the biblical King David (2 Sam. 13-18)-and the tsarevich's inadequacies are enumerated at length in Feofan Prokopovich's pcean to the Law, the Pravda voli monarshei, as a justifi- cation for adopting the new Petrine rule of succession.11 Still, James Cracraft is probably right in suggesting that the Petrine Law is better thought of as relating to the feud between the two branches of the Romanov dynasty, Milo- slavskii and Naryshkin, than to the Tsarevich Aleksei affair.12 As Cracraft put it,\n\nIn the absence of a succession law, a dynastic feud broke out in the 1680s between the relatives and supporters of the late Tsar Aleksei's two wives.. Peter's solution to the dynastic crisis, and to the per- ceived shortcomings more generally of the political system that he in- herited in stages (death of his elder half-brother, Tsar Fedor, in 1682; deposition of his half-sister, the regent Sofia, in 1689; death of his other half-brother and co-tsar, Ivan V, in 1694; death of his mother, Tsaritsa Natalia, in 1696), was to lay down a succession law.13\n\nIn other words, the feud between the two branches of the Romanov dynasty was fueled by the lack of clarity about who the next ruler was to be after Peter.\n\nPeter's Law eliminated the need for an emperor-progenitor and, in effect, abolished the notion of the dynasty. The relevant portion of the Law reads that \"we have thought fit to lay down this statue, whereby it should always be in the power of the reigning monarch to appoint whomsoever he wishes as his successor; and if he sees any fault in him whom he has appointed, to revoke the succession.\"14In fact, Peter I believed that it was \"the old custom of granting the succession to the eldest son\" that was at heart to blame for Aleksei's treachery because, as history had shown, this \"old custom\" served only to foster a lackadaisical attitude toward duty and a penchant for rebellion among royal heirs, like his son.15\n\nBut then, there is law and there is the application of law. Of the seven sovereigns between Peter I's death in 1725 and Paul I's promulgation of his new Law of Succession on 5 April 1797 (the day of his coronation), only three Russian rulers actually named their heirs in accordance with the Petrine Law: Anna Ioannovna (1730-40), who selected her grand-nephew, Ivan VI Antonovich (1740-41); Elizabeth Petrovna (1741-62), who selected her nephew Karl Pieter Ulrich, or Peter III; and Catherine II the Great, who selected her son, Paul I.16 The other four transitions of power came after coups (Elizabeth succeeding Ivan VI, Catherine II succeeding Peter III) or at the whim of the court elite (Catherine I succeeding Peter I, Peter II succeeding Catherine I). Thus, the Petrine Law never took the crown outside the lineage of the Romanov dynasty, but it did permit the contest between the two branches of the dynasty, Miloslavskii and Naryshkin (represented by Anna Ioannovna and Ivan VI, and by Catherine I, Peter II, Peter III, and Catherine II, respectively) to continue (see again Figure 1, above).\n\nThe death of Catherine I - Peter I's second wife and successor - prompted the first significant reconsideration of the Petrine Law of Succession. At the time of her death on 6 May 1727, courtiers suddenly produced a testament that is almost certainly a forgery (the handwriting is A. V. Makarov's, Peter I's private secretary, and the document was made public only the next day).17 The document does more than indicate a successor, as the Petrine Law required. It sketches out a path for the succession beyond Catherine's designated heir (her stepson, Peter Alekseevich, or Peter II) and includes provisions that impose rules on the succession that violate the word and spirit of Peter I's unfettered Law of Succession:\n\nIf the Grand Duke [i.e., Peter II] dies without heirs, then Tsesarevna Anna Petrovna and her descendants succeed after him. After her, Tsesarevna Elizabeth and her descendants, and then the Grand Duchess [velikaia kniazhna-Tsarevich Aleksei's daughter, thegranddaughter of Peter I, and the older sister of the future Peter II] and her descendants. However, heirs of the male sex take precedence over those of the female sex. Under no circumstances shall anyone occupy the Russian throne who does not follow the Greek Orthodox faith or who has another crown.18\n\nWhether the testament is authentic or not, its purpose is entirely clear. First, it imposes new qualifications on anyone who should succeed to the throne. While Peter's Law only required that the heir be selected by the current ruler - evidently solely on the basis of perceived merit - Catherine I's testament required that the heir be Orthodox and not be reigning on any other, foreign throne. Perhaps Peter I assumed that his successors would have the good sense to avoid picking a Heterodox or foreign monarch as his or her heir, but Peter I's Law nowhere prohibits this. The monarch's volia, or will, is entirely unrestricted. Second, the testament assumes that the emperor-progenitor is Peter I. Interestingly, the text of the testament does not make Catherine I or even Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich the emperor- (or empress-) progenitor. Assigning that position to Catherine I would have excluded Peter II (her stepson) from the succession, which was clearly not the intent of the author(s) of the testament since, according to it, Peter II was to (and did) succeed to the throne after Catherine I. Nor does the text give that role to Tsar Aleksei since doing so would have necessarily pulled in his descendants from his first marriage (the Miloslavskii branch of the dynasty). Thus this testament contemplates Peter I as the emperor-progenitor, and so plots out the succession as if there were no living descendants of Ivan V, which there were. The crown was to stay in the Naryshkin line of the Romanov dynasty.\n\nAnd it did, but not for long. The pendulum swung back to the Miloslavskii branch of the family with the sudden death of Peter II in January 1730. Anna Ioannovna ruled, unpopularly, for a decade before she nominated her grand-nephew, the 14-month-old Ivan VI, as her heir, with his mother, Anna Leopoldovna, as regent. It was during Ivan VI's brief reign that the next major attempt was made to revise the Petrine Law, now with the goal of excluding the Naryshkin branch of the dynasty.\n\nOn 1 November 1741, Anna Leopoldovna ordered a special commission be formed to discuss the problem of the succession.19 It was a sensible, if self-serving, move. It was sensible because no one could count on the longevity of a 14-month-old infant in that day and age, though the boy did have a younger sister (Catherine, who was four months old) and his parents were healthy and still of child-bearing age (they would have, besides Ivan VI and Catherine, three more healthy and long-lived children). If Anna Leopoldovna's commission could agree to it, it would be possible to devise a rule of succession that passed the throne on to Ivan VI's sister or other future siblings. Anna Leopoldovna's commission was also self-serving, because part of her motive in forming it was to have recognized her own succession rights to the throne. On 2-4 November the commission, made up of Andrei Ivanovich Osterman, Count Gavriil Ivanovich Golovkin, Prince Aleksei Mikhailovich Cherkasskii, and Archbishop Amvrosii (Iushkevych) of Novgorod, met and discussed at length the principles of a new system.20 The four men went back and forth on many issues, but generally agreed that Peter I's Law had to be replaced with a new law rooted in a stable and rational rule of succession. They also discussed and largely agreed that the succession should operate by male primogeniture but have provisions for the succession of women should the male line expire. In this discussion, the experiences of female succession (that is, succession to or through female members of the ruling dynasties) in England, Denmark, Spain, and Portugal were cited as useful models for how the succession could work in Russia, too.\n\nThe four men also grappled with the notion of an emperor-progenitor, which must have been the most radical element of their discussions. After all, succession by male primogeniture and female rule were familiar enough concepts: primogeniture was very much like the system that had been in place in Muscovy, and by 1741, the idea of a female ruler must have hardly been any- thing shockingly new (by this date, there had been one sovereign regent and two empresses). To be sure, the notion of an emperor-progenitor was familiar, too. It was rooted in the Confirmatory Charter (Utverzhdennaia gramota) that brought Mikhail Romanov-the original Romanov emperor-progenitor-to the throne, and which records the professions of loyalty not just to the new tsar, but to all the heirs of his body-to \"the royal [tsarskim] children that God may in the future give to him, the sovereign.\"21 But for Osterman and the others, Tsar Mikhail (1613-45) was too remote an ancestor for their purposes, which, in part, were to secure the succession in the line of Ivan V-the Miloslavskii branch of the family. Thus the issue for the commission was to iden- tify a new emperor-progenitor - in this case, Ivan V - that would limit the succession to the Miloslavskii branch of the Romanov dynasty: to the regent, Anna Leopoldovna (the granddaughter of Ivan V) and to her current and future offspring (Ivan VI, Catherine, and any other children who might be born). In this way, Anna Leopoldovna's commission had the rules of primo- geniture on its side in trying to limit the succession to the Miloslavskii branch of the dynasty since Ivan V was the older (half-) brother of Peter I, and so his line would have preeminence in a strict primogeniturial system. These discussions therefore perfectly blended two very different impulses-the emerging Western legal notions about the role of law in the structures of government and royal succession, and the native, traditional, kinship-based conflicts between two factions of royal in-laws.\n\nCatherine the Greatâ€™s Projects for a Law of Succession\n\nThese two impulses-Western and Muscovite-are very much still in evidence in the second half of the 18th century. Just three weeks after Osterman, Golovkin, Cherkasskii, and Archbishop Amvrosii had convened their commission to rewrite the succession law, the pendulum swung back to the Naryshkin branch - the last swing of that pendulum, it turns out - when Peter I's daughter, Elizabeth Petrovna, seized the throne from Ivan VI and his mother, Anna Leopoldovna. The restoration of the Naryshkin branch of the Romanovs also meant the restoration of the Petrine Law of Succession, at least for a time. Empress Elizabeth is noteworthy for having been one of the few rulers actually to use the Law as it was intended, nominating her nephew, Karl Pieter Ulrich, or Peter III (ruled 1761-62), who was later arrested in a coup arranged at the behest of his wife, Sophie Friederike Auguste of Anhalt-Zerbst, or Catherine II. Catherine would be the last to use the Law, and the first to put forward a serious proposal for replacing it.\n\nCatherine tackled the problem of the succession in the same methodical and rational way she was approaching many of Russia's other legal and political ills. In 1766-67, Catherine sketched out the first scribblings of a modern, Western-style rule for the succession-a draft (chernovik) law that survives today and has been published, though remains largely unstudied and ignored in many of the best historical treatments of her reign and biography. The draft law is written in Catherine's own hand, with numerous grammatical and spelling irregularities, as one might expect in a non-native speaker of Russian.22 It begins with a preamble which situates her law within her other, larger attempts to regularize the laws and political system of the Russian Em- pire. She mentions her Nakaz (or \"Instructions\") to the Legislative Commission and her desire to compile a new compendium (ulozhenie) of Russian laws, but she singles out the law of succession as something that she, as sovereign, should handle personally, and not turn over to the Legislative Commission: \"But the first and fundamental [nachal'nyi] law of thisautocratic realm should, because of its nature, be given and inscribed by Our own Imperial hand, that is: a law that assures the stability of the throne andclarity in the succession.\"23Catherine further justifies her desire to write this new law of succession on the basis of the troubled history of kingdoms that had no firm laws of succession. \"Not only Russian chronicles and history, but the histories of many states in the world are filled with examples of great tumult, which have their origins in the instability of the throne and of the succession, even to the point that it caused the dismemberment of the realm and permitted, in the end, the invasion of barbarians, hardship, and utter destruction.\"24\n\nCatherine defined the provisions of her law within five articles. (A sixth article is left blank: \"6).\".) Article 1 establishes Catherine's authorship of the law: \"To call this law an Imperial decree [stat'ia] of Catherine II.\" Article 2 states that \"the Imperial throne may never be vacant.\" This provision prevents interregna, to be sure; but it also implies that the succession to thethrone is automatic upon the death of the ruler, and, furthermore, implies that it is the operation of the law itself that guarantees that continuity. That ele- ment-that the law itself determines the succession - which isonlyimpliedhere, will reappear explicitly in later versions of Catherine's law and in Paul I's Law of Succession and Statute on the Imperial Family. Article 3 in Catherine's draft law of succession names her son, Paul, as her heir: \"After my death, my son will inherit [the throne].\" This provision may on first glance appear to resemble the kind of nominations of heirs required by the Petrine Law of Succession, which Catherine was attempting to replace. But Catherine was more likely mentioning her only legitimate son not to nominate him in the manner of Peter's Law, but so as to designate herself as the empress-pro- genitor of the Romanov dynasty. That motive becomes clear when the first part of Article 4 is considered, which establishes a system of primogeniture among Paul's descendants: \"After my son, then his eldest son inherits [the throne], provided his eldest son has reached the age of 21 years.\" Leaping over the second part of Article 4 to Article 5, Catherine elaborates there that \"if the male line should die out, then the eldest daughter succeeds [to the throne].\"25 In this way, the law implies a system of male primogeniture, with the option of female succession in the absence of male heirs.\n\nBut the second part of Article 4 contains an odd and intriguing provision. It states that \"if he [the eldest son of Paul or another of her successors] is 20 years old or younger, then his mother is to be crowned and reign her entire life, for it is a dangerous time during the minority of a sovereign.\"26 While Catherine's draft law was clearly forward looking-toward securing the succession for her son and future descendants - this phrase was clearly all about herownlegitimacyonthethrone. Itwillberememberedthat Catherine seized the throne from her husband, Peter III, and chose not to become a regent for her eight-year-old son, but sovereign empress herself. She held that title for the rest of her life. Catherine was thus ensconcing in law her own possession of the throne - not her usurpation of it from Peter III (that was a topic she assiduously avoided), but her keeping it for herself once her son had reached adulthood (however \"adulthood,\" for purposes of succession, might legally be defined-15, 21, or whatever age a law of succession might specify). Catherine's first draft law of succession was therefore doing double duty: it was securing herself on the throne as much as it was defining the rights to it of future generations of her descendants.\n\nCatherine II's first attempt at writing a new law of succession came to nothing, just like many of the empress's other ambitious projects embraced by the Legislative Commission. Her next attempt to write a law of succession was also linked to larger legal and administrative reforms, and was just as unsuccessful. In 1785, Catherine devised an expansive reorganization of her central government and provincial administration, and part of that reorgani- zation included detailed provisions for the succession.27 These provisions repeat, in a more expanded form, those that appeared in Catherine's 1766-67 project, including the system of male primogeniture. The text provides that Catherine's empire (which is given the official name of the \"All-Russian Empire\"-Vserossiiskaia imperiia),\n\nis to remain whole and indivisible; that after my demise, the autoc- racy and crown of this realm shall pass to my beloved son and heir, Tsesarevich and Grand Duke Paul Petrovich, who will reign his entire life; that after himthe autocracy and crown shall pass to his eldest son (Our beloved grandson), Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, who will reign his entire life; and after him the autocracy and crown shall pass to his eldest son, who shall reign his entire life. If the legitimate line of descent from Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich should fall ex- tinct, then the autocracy and crown shall pass to [Grand Duke Paul Petrovich's] second son (Our beloved grandson) Grand Duke Con- stantine Pavlovich, who will reign his entire life. After him shall reign his eldest son his entire life. If the legitimate line of descent from Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich should fall extinct, then the au- tocracy and crown shall pass to his next eldest brother, who shall reign his entire life. And after him, the autocracy and crown shall pass to his eldest son, who shall reign his entire life, and so on-the eldest son after the father.28\n\nCatherine's law also allowed for the succession to and through females, after all of the male lines descended from her had expired: \"Should the legitimate male lines of descent, by God's will, all fall extinct, then the autocracy and crown should pass to the eldest sister and to her line of descent, and then to the younger sister, and her line of descent.\"29 Though it is not stated in the text, it appears that, once the succession should pass to a female line of descent, male primogeniture would again be reinstituted in the cognatic line.\n\nThe draft law of succession ends with a list of disqualifying factors for any potential heir to the throne:\n\nFrom the succession to the autocracy and crown are excluded:\n\n1. he or she who is not of the Greek Orthodox faith,\n\n2. he or she who wears the crown of another realm,\n\n3. he or she who is married to someone who does not belong to the Greek Orthodox faith.30\n\nThese exclusions, it will be remembered, also appear in the so-called will of Catherine I (quoted above), though here there is added a new regulation of dynastic marriage.\n\nIn some ways, Catherine II's proposed law is much better than her first attempt some 20 years earlier. There is vastly more specificity about how the system of male primogeniture is to work (though there are still important aspects of the system that are ignored, such as the resumption of the preference for male successors after the throne has passed through a female). The addi- tion of the three exclusions also is a sensible (if not very original) improve- ment. But there are signs that this second project was still very much a working draft. The omission of any discussion of regencies or the age of majority render the law rather incomplete, though the elimination of Catherine's provision that regencies of royal mothers last a lifetime is a welcome improvement. The elimination of this self-serving provision is likely explained by the simple fact that, by 1785, Catherine had been on the throne for nearly a quarter century, and she therefore may have felt less need to manipulate this law into a vehicle for propping up her own legitimacy. In assigning the role of empress-progenitor to herself, Catherine displayed her confidence that the rift in the Romanov dynasty between the Miloslavskii and Naryshkin branches was by 1785 all but over. In 1780, the three surviving siblings of Ivan VI (Catherine, Peter, and Alexei) had been moved to Horsens in Denmark, there to live under the protection of Queen Julianne (their aunt) and supported financially by a pension granted by Catherine II.31 None of the children married, and the Miloslavskii line of the House of Romanov conveniently passed out of existence.32\n\nToward a New Law of Succession\n\nThe last of the three projects Catherine II devised for the Imperial succession was the most expansive and best conceived. It appeared, again, as part of Catherine's continuing efforts to rationalize and regularize Russian government, and, again, was never enacted.33 But it had a lot in common with Paul I's Law of Succession and Statute on the Imperial Family, which actually was promulgated (in 1797) and which successfully regulated the succession down to the end of the empire (and does so even today).\n\nThe 1787 project accomplished far more than all the previous efforts at writing a law of succession. First, the project is more complete and well-considered than any previously proposed or actual rule of succession in Russian history, anticipating possible permutations in the succession - and in the Romanov family - over time. It provided for a system of male primogeniture, clearly giving women the right to inherit the throne and permitting the succession to pass through women to the next available male heir. It contemplated the concept of repraesentatio, whereby the son takes the place in the line of succession of a deceased father (a concept that, for example, was not available to the Muscovites during the succession crisis of 1497-1502, when Ivan III was deciding between his grandson - the son of his eldest son - and his own second-born son).34 It provides detailed(andconventional) provisions for a regency. It involved the Imperial Senate in the operation of the law, requiring that it be notified of deaths in the Imperial family so that the succession of the new emperor could be publicly proclaimed and oaths taken. And it provided precise rubrics for the distribution of titles among members of the Imperial house. Catherine's third project also expanded upon provisions in previous iterations of the law, adopting the requirement that emperors and their spouses be Orthodox, that they not simultaneously hold the crowns of other realms, and that the marriages of members of the Imperial house be regulated by the requirement that the emperor or empress give his or her consent. Finally, Catherine's 1787 project provides new and expanded rules for disqualifying her descendants from the succession, including the sensible requirement that heirs to the throne be of sound emotional and physical health and not be deficient morally (how that was determined and defined remained rather vague). There was also a provision that any heir who had participated in an uprising against the sovereign, or had plotted to do so, would be excluded from the succession.\n\nOf course, there are lots of questions that remained unanswered in this third draft law of Catherine's. What procedure, exactly, was to be used to exclude one of her descendants from the succession? Did the requirement for Orthodox spouses preclude marrying someone who had converted? The crowns of what \"other realms\" were to be counted as disqualifying, especially when Russian sovereigns had numerous official titles (including, at a later point, the titles of king of Poland and grand duke of Finland)? There is also the question of Paul's status in the third project. It has been noted by biographers of Catherine II that, toward the end of her life, she had planned to pass over her son, Paul, in favor of her eldest grandson, Alexander. The case for skipping over a generation has been based largely on rumors reported in the memoirs of several of Catherine's courtiers.35 The rumors seem to be supported by this third project, which, unlike the first two, fails to reference Paul - either as \"my son\" or by name - as her successor. It merely points to the general principle in the law that the eldest son succeeds to the throne on the death of the sovereign. M. M. Safonov has, however, made a convincing argument that these rumors are groundless - in each case, the courtier reporting these rumors was not privy to Catherine's plans, or made factual errors in their accounts, or was wildly speculating. O. A. Omel'chenko, the leading scholar of the laws of succession in Russia, is probably right when he points out that the third draft was a more abstract, normative description of the succession system: \"The law project of 1787 includes no reference to Paul as the undisputed, concrete heir, although it clearly specifies that the succession is to follow the principle of male primogeniture and the seniority of the 'eldest son.'\"36 In other words, the third draft omits a specific reference to Paul be- cause it is a better general law of succession - written so as to apply generally and in perpetuity, not just to Paul as the immediate successor to Catherine.\n\nCatherine's third attempt at a law of succession was an impressive monument to her well-known (if uneven) respect for the rule of law and rational governance. Her third stab at a law of succession was very likely well-enough designed to have worked, had it ever been promulgated. In fact, a form of it was promulgated. Paul I's Law of Succession and Statute on the Imperial Family included many of the same provisions as Catherine's 1797 draft law (see Table 1, below); and it is hard not to imagine that the experience of drafting Catherine's three laws of succession (if not, perhaps, the texts themselves) was enormously influential for Paul I when he sat down to write his own law. It may not be coincidental that Paul I wrote the text of the edict that would become his Law of Succession on 4 January 1788, in St. Petersburg, when he still was the heir-apparent-just a few months after Catherine wrote her third draft law.37"
