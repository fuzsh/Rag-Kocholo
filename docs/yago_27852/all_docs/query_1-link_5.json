He was proclaimed official heir to the Russian throne on November 7, 1742, by his aunt, Elizaveta Petrovna.\n\nOn August 21, 1745, Peter Feodorovich married Princess Sophia Augusta Frederica of Anhalt-Zerbst, who was christened into the Orthodox faith as Ekaterina Alexeevna (the future Catherine the Great ).\n\nPeter ascended the Russian throne on December 25, 1761, the day Empress Elizaveta Petrovna died.\n\nHis first action was an amnesty for and return from exile of state figures arrested by Elizaveta after her accession.\n\nDuring his short reign, he introduced various reforms, banned the persecution of dissenters, dissolved the Privy Council and by special decree released the gentry from compulsory state service.\n\nOn June 28, 1762, he was overthrown by a court coup led by his wife. After his deposition, he was imprisoned in Ropshinskii Castle, where on July 7, 1762, he was killed by Count Alexei Orlov, Catherine's favorite and one of the organizers of the coup.\n\nHe had two children from his marriage with Catherine: a son, later Emperor Paul I, and a daughter, who died in infancy."
