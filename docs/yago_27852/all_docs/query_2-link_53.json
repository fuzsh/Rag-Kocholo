        "text": "This is all the more surprising considering Catherine was not actually Russian—she was born in the German kingdom of Prussia, and was invited to Russia at the age of 15 by the then-Empress, Elizabeth Petrovna. Elizabeth was seeking a wife for her nephew, Peter, who she had chosen as heir to the throne, and Catherine’s ambitious mother had long been grooming her to marry well.\n\nAt 16, Catherine charmed everyone from Empress Elizabeth to the Russian population as a whole—everyone, that is, except Peter. The pair reportedly took a mutual dislike to one another as soon as they met, but nonetheless a marriage was quickly arranged in August of 1745. Peter III ascended as the Tsar of Russia almost two decades later, in 1762.\n\n…and only got worse from there on out. Even as teenagers, the couple reportedly never got along, so it’s no great shock that their marriage wasn’t a roaring success. For one thing, they did not have a child for more than eight years, which at the time was considered highly unusual, and has led some historians to speculate that Peter was either infertile or unable to consummate the marriage.\n\nBoth Catherine and Peter began extramarital affairs; hers was with a Russian military officer named Sergei Saltykov. When Catherine gave birth to her first son Paul, in 1754, it was rumored that Saltykov was the real father; the same was later rumored about her other three children.\n\nThough The Great takes plenty of liberties with the story, this wild aspect of the story is absolutely accurate. Following Peter’s ascension to the throne, he took a number of very unpopular measures, among them ending Russia’s long war with Prussia. With the population increasingly alienated, Catherine was also skeptical of her husband’s ability to rule, and when a discontented faction of the nobility concocted a plan to overthrow Peter, Catherine joined the effort. A faction led by Catherine’s lover, Grigory Orlov, unseated Peter from the throne and had him arrested.\n\nPeter’s reign lasted just six months before he abdicated, at which point Catherine became Russia’s ruler.\n\nYup, the coup got a lot uglier after Peter’s abdication. Just a week later, on July 17, 1762, Peter died, and although the circumstances remain mysterious, it’s widely believed that he was assassinated by Alexei Orlov, Grigory's brother. There’s no definitive proof one way or the other whether Catherine knew about—or may even have ordered—her husband’s murder, but the general assumption among the Russian people was that she did.\n\nIt’s not entirely surprising, therefore, that Catherine herself faced several uprisings during her long reign as empress. One of the most notable was in 1773, when a group led by former military officer Emelyan Pugachev questioned the validity of Catherine’s reign, on the grounds that Pugachev claimed he was, in fact, Peter III. Despite the strangeness of his claim, Pugachev gathered thousands of supporters and was able to mount a significant rebellion against Catherine, but he was ultimately captured and executed in 1775.\n\nLike father, like son. Paul's relationship with his mother was troubled—he was largely raised by Elizabeth, and his mother reportedly “had little time” for him. Things only grew more tense after Catherine’s ascension, and Paul was at times convinced that she was plotting his death—which was by all accounts not true, although she may have questioned his ability to rule as her heir.\n\nWhen Paul had children of his own, Catherine took over raising them (much as Elizabeth had for Paul) and it was rumored that she intended to name one of them as her heir instead of Paul. However, she died before she could put this plan into action, so Paul succeeded her in 1796, and set about reversing many of her signature policies. Five years into his reign, he was assassinated."
