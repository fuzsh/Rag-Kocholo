        "text": "The takeover of St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch by InBev last year stirred fear among local charities and other organizations that the company would become less generous. And the economic downturn has caused universities to worry that donors would be stingier.\n\nBut both concerns were eased Thursday - at least for one day with one major gift announcement. The Anheuser-Busch Foundation pledged $2.5 million over the next five years to the University of Missouri-St. Louis to help fund a business administration building that will bear the company's name.\n\nThe gift is one of the largest in UMSL's history. Its largest single gift was $10 million in 1997 from the St. Louis Mercantile Library Board of Direction.\n\nUMSL is in the early stages of fundraising and planning for the new Anheuser-Busch Hall. This is the first donation for the building, which has an estimated price tag of $30 million. The rest of the money is to come from private donors. UMSL hopes to break ground in a couple of years.\n\nJennifer Hatton, an UMSL spokeswoman, said the business administration's faculty, staff and classrooms are now scattered in four buildings. The new building would house all of them.\n\nThe gift \"reinforces our commitment to the community,\" said Dave Peacock, president of Anheuser-Busch, now a division of Anheuser-Busch InBev of Belgium. \"It's been a long-standing principle of Anheuser-Busch to support the community.\"\n\nAnheuser-Busch has given money to local schools including Washington University, St. Louis University and UMSL over the years. About 280 UMSL alumni work now for Anheuser-Busch InBev.\n\n\"These are important universities for us in identifying and creating talent,\" said Peacock, who earned his MBA from Washington University. \"These schools create our future colleagues, so it's important for us to invest there.\"\n\nWhile some charities were concerned that Anheuser-Busch would be less generous these days, Peacock said that the gift to UMSL is one example of A-B keeping its giving on track.\n\n\"The key for us is not just about giving money,\" he said. The goal is to improve \"the communities in which we work and live,\" he said.\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
