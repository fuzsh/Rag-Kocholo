Mental illness and addiction take a significant toll on the health of Albertans, and on the cost of providing healthcare. They also have a significant direct and indirect societal impact.\n\nMental illness can affect any of us. Any day.\n\nAt the Mental Health Foundation, we have a better future in mind for all ages and stages, from childhood to the elderly, with no gaps in service. Long stigmatized and hidden, mental health and addictions issues have been at best, under-supported; at worst, ignored. With your help we are changing those perceptions.\n\nThe funds we raise go to support essential programs and services, patient supports, research, education & awareness, and facility enhancements."
