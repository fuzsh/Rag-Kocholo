        "text": "I need 30 people in my LinkedIn Network to share this important subject on #OpioidUseDisorder Treatment Stigma. If you're in my network, expect a message from me about sharing this content with your LinkedIn connections. This is too important to ignore. The Pharmacy Podcast Network teamed up with University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, Duquesne University School of Pharmacy, and the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association to develop an in-depth and detailed podcast series to educate our Pharmacists and Physicians on the element of stigma and it's impact on treatment. Please share this series and tag your school of pharmacy. I am ready to work with 10 Schools of Pharmacy in 2023 on special projects like this. We're targeting WVU SCHOOL OF PHARMACY HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER, lead by Dr. William Petros, UConn School of Pharmacy led by Dr. Philip Hritcko -- and we're so excited about what's to come. Please share this series. Thank you. https://lnkd.in/gGET6-Ng\n\nHow can we expect health to improve when pharmacists are not considered “Providers”. Generally the only way the pharmacy is paid is through dispensing. Imagine if your physician was not paid to consult you or educate you on your treatment plan, but rather was only there to diagnose and see as many patients in that day as physically possible. I know it seems that way sometimes. Did you know pharmacists cannot bill for most of the services they provide? This causes more burnout than you know. Pharmacists need to be providers so they can take the needed time to educate and provide valuable information to reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes. Imagine going to your pharmacist and getting information on drug induced nutrients, quality foods and supplements to reverse any deficiencies, and set a plan of action moving forward to be ultimately healthy. Pharmacists are much more knowledgeable than what most know them to be. We need the time and more importantly the funding to provide the expert services that will inevitably save tax payers and private companies way more money than what is being spent. This is a known fact. For too many years organizations have been shut down in legislation while trying to get pharmacists to become “providers”. News flash: Pharmacists do not want a physicians job. Pharmacists do not want a nurses job. Pharmacists do not want a dieticians job. Pharmacists do not want anyone else’s job. They want a pharmacist job and to be part of health vs healthcare. They want to be paid to consult and educate so patients have individualized care. They want to monitor chronic diseases and create a concierge approach and convenience around care. They want to be considered a provider since they provide care. What am I missing?
