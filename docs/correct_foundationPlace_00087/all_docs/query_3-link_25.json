        "text": "Donation is less painful than you probably think.\n\nDiscomfort and side effects vary from person to person, but it’s nothing like what you see on TV. Some of the common side effects of PBSC donation are headaches, nausea and tiredness—from the daily filgrastim shots administered in the 5 days leading up to donation.\n\nFor a marrow donation, you experience no pain before or during the procedure, but you may feel sore or achy for a few days afterward.\n\nAge guidelines protect the safety of the donor and provide the best possible outcome for the patient. They are not meant to discriminate.\n\nSome believe that the age guidelines we have in place are to discriminate against those 41 and older. However, these guidelines are meant to protect the safety of the patient AND the donor.\n\nDonors between the ages of 18-35 provide the greatest chance for transplant success.\n\nDoctors request donors in the 18-35 age group 75% of the time.\n\nLearn more about why a donor’s age matters."
