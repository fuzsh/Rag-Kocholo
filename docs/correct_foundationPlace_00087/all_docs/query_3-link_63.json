They are usually spread during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. But sometimes they can spread through other sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. This is because some STIs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact.\n\nSome STIs can be passed from a pregnant person to the baby, either during pregnancy or when giving birth. Other ways that some STIs may be spread include during breastfeeding, through blood transfusions, or by sharing needles.\n\nThere are more than 20 types of STIs, including:\n\nChlamydia\n\nGenital herpes\n\nGonorrhea\n\nHIV\n\nHPV\n\nPubic lice\n\nSyphilis\n\nTrichomoniasis\n\nWhat causes sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\n\nSTIs can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.\n\nWho is affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\n\nMost STIs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for women. If an STI is passed to a baby, it can cause serious health problems.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\n\nSTIs don't always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection and not know it. And even without symptoms, STIs can still be harmful and may be passed on during sex.\n\nIf there are symptoms, they could include:\n\nUnusual discharge from the penis or vagina\n\nSores or warts on the genital area\n\nPainful or frequent urination (peeing)\n\nItching and redness in the genital area\n\nBlisters or sores in or around the mouth\n\nAbnormal vaginal odor\n\nAnal itching, soreness, or bleeding\n\nAbdominal (belly) pain\n\nFever\n\nHow are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed?\n\nIf you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STIs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STIs do not usually cause symptoms.\n\nSome STIs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through STI testing. Some tests involve a microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STIs.\n\nWhat are the treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\n\nAntibiotics can treat STIs that are caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STIs caused by viruses, but antiviral medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection.\n\nIt's important to get treatment if you have an STI. Some types of STIs can cause serious health problems if they are not treated.\n\nCan sexually transmitted infections (STIs) be prevented?\n\nThe surest way to protect yourself against STIs is to not have sex.\n\nIf you do decide to have sex, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by:\n\nHaving you and your partner tested for STIs before having sex.\n\nUsing a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\n\nReducing your number of sex partners. You might even consider \"mutual monogamy\" with just one partner. This means that you agree to be sexually active only with them, and they agree to be sexually active only with you. But first you should both get tested to make sure that you don't already have an STI.\n\nGetting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B.\n\nStart Here\n\nSexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development)\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)\n\nSexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Symptoms (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n\nDiagnosis and Tests\n\nGenital Problems in Men (American Academy of Family Physicians) Also in Spanish\n\nGenital Problems in Women (American Academy of Family Physicians) Also in Spanish\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections (STIs): Why Testing Is Important (American Academy of Pediatrics)\n\nSTD Testing: What's Right for You (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n\nSTD Tests (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n\nHow to Prevent STIs (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\nRelated Issues\n\nCervicitis (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n\nHepatitis B (American Academy of Family Physicians) Also in Spanish\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n\nSTI Myths & Facts Quiz (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish\n\nStatistics and Research\n\nFastStats: Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) (National Center for Health Statistics)\n\nSexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2022 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\nClinical Trials\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Sexually Transmitted Diseases (National Institutes of Health)\n\nPubic Lice (Crabs) (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n\nSTDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n\nTalking to Your Kids About STDs (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n\nTalking to Your Partner about Condoms (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n\nTalking to Your Partner about STDs (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n\nTelling Your Partner You Have an STD (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n\nAbout STIs and Gay Men (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\n\nHow Can Men Reduce the Risk of Getting a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)?
