(Data Broker Registration)\n\nRequires data brokers to register with, and provide certain information to, the Attorney General. Defines a data broker as a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship, subject to specified exceptions. Requires the Attorney General to make the information provided by data brokers accessible on its internet website. Data brokers that fail to register are subject to injunction and liability for civil penalties, fees, and costs in an action brought by the Attorney General, with any recovery to be deposited in the Consumer Privacy Fund, as specified. The bill would make statements of legislative findings and declarations and legislative intent.\n\nNevada\n\nNRS § 603A.300 (Requires websites in Nevada to allow users to opt-out of having their personal data sold to third parties.)\n\nRequires an operator (e.g., a person who owns or operates an Internet website or online service for commercial purposes or collects and maintains specified information from Nevada residents) to establish a designated request address through which a consumer may submit a verified request directing the operator not to make any sale of covered information collected about the consumer. The term “sale” is defined to mean the exchange of covered information for monetary consideration by the operator to a person for the person to license or sell the covered information to additional persons. The law also prohibits an operator who has received such a request from making any sale of any covered information collected about the consumer. The Attorney General may seek an injunction or a civil penalty for violations.\n\nNevada 2021 S.B. 260, Chap. 292\n\nRelates to Internet privacy; exempts certain persons and information collected about a consumer in this state from requirements imposed on operators, data brokers and covered information; prohibits a data broker from making any sale of certain information collected about a consumer in the state if so directed by the consumer; revises provisions relating to the sale of certain information collected about a consumer in the state.\n\nVermont\n\n9 V.S.A § 2446-2447 (Protection of Personal Information: Data Brokers)\n\nRequires data brokers--businesses that knowingly collect and license the personal information of consumers with whom such businesses do not have a direct relationship—to register annually with the Secretary of State. Data brokers also must provide consumers with specified information, including the name, e-mail, and Internet addresses of the data broker; whether the data broker permits a consumer to opt-out of personal information collection or data sales; the method for requesting an opt-out; activities or sales the opt-out applies to; and whether the data broker permits a consumer to authorize a third party to perform the opt-out on the consumer's behalf. A statement specifying the data collection, databases, or sales activities from which a consumer may not opt-out and a statement as to whether the data broker implements a purchaser credentialing process must also be disclosed, among other disclosures. Data brokers also must implement and maintain a written information security program containing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personally identifiable information.\n\nPrivacy of Personal Information Held by Internet Service Providers (ISPs)\n\nNevada and Minnesota require internet service providers specifically to keep private certain information concerning their customers unless the customer gives permission to disclose the information. Minnesota also requires ISPs to get permission from subscribers before disclosing information about the subscribers' online surfing habits and Internet sites visited. Maine prohibits using, disclosing, selling, or permitting access to customer personal information unless the customer expressly consents to such. Maine also prohibits a provider from refusing to serve a customer, charging a customer a penalty, or offering a customer a discount.\n\nMaine - 35-A MRSA § 9301 (effective 7-1-20)\n\nMinnesota - Minn.

It also prohibits an operator of a Web site or online service directed to minors from marketing or advertising to minors specified products or services that minors are legally prohibited from buying. The law also prohibits marketing or advertising certain products based on personal information specific to a minor or knowingly using, disclosing, compiling, or allowing a third party to do so.\n\nDelaware\n\nDel. Code § 1204C\n\nProhibits operators of websites, online or cloud computing services, online applications, or mobile applications directed at children from marketing or advertising on its Internet service specified products or services inappropriate for children’s viewing, such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms, or pornography. When the marketing or advertising on an Internet service directed to children is provided by an advertising service, the operator of the Internet service is required to provide notice to the advertising service, after which time the prohibition on marketing and advertising the specified products or services applies to the advertising service directly. The law also prohibits an operator of an Internet service who has actual knowledge that a child is using the Internet service from using the child’s personally identifiable information to market or advertise the products or services to the child, and also prohibits disclosing a child’s personally identifiable information if it is known that the child’s personally identifiable information will be used for the purpose of marketing or advertising those products or services to the child.\n\ne-Reader Privacy\n\nArizona\n\nAriz.

Requires a book service provider to prepare and post online an annual report on its disclosures of personal information unless exempted from doing so. The Consumer Protection Unit of the Department of Justice has the authority to investigate and prosecute violations of the acts.\n\nMissouri\n\nMo. Rev.

The law, among other things, requires that the privacy policy identify the categories of personally identifiable information that the operator collects about individual consumers who use or visit its Web site or online service and third parties with whom the operator may share the information.\n\nCal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.130(5), 1798.135(a)(2)(A)\n\nRequires certain companies to disclose specified information in an online privacy policy or policies if the business has an online privacy policy or policies and in any California-specific description of consumers’ privacy rights, or if the business does not maintain those policies, on its internet website and update that information at least once every 12 months.
