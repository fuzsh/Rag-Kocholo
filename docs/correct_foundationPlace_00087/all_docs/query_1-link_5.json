        "text": "To further the goals of the CMS National Quality Strategy, CMS leaders from across the Agency have come together to streamline quality measures across CMS quality programs for the adult and pediatric populations. This “Universal Foundation” of quality measures will focus provider attention, reduce burden, identify disparities in care, prioritize development of interoperable, digital quality measures, allow for cross- comparisons across programs, and help identify measurement gaps. The development and implementation of the Preliminary Adult and Pediatric Universal Foundation Measures will promote the best, safest, and most equitable care for individuals as we all work together on these critical quality areas. As CMS moves forward with the Universal Foundation, we will be working to identify foundational measures in other speciﬁc settings and populations to support further measure alignment across CMS programs as applicable.\n\nSelection Criteria for the Universal Foundation:\n\nThe measure is of a high national impact\n\nThe measure can be benchmarked nationally and globally\n\nThe measure is applicable to multiple populations and settings\n\nThe measure is appropriate for stratification to identify disparity gaps\n\nThe measure has scientific acceptability\n\nThe measure is feasible and computable (or capable of becoming digital)\n\nThe measure has no unintended consequences\n\nThese measures will be used across CMS quality programs and prioritized for stratification and digitization. The CMS Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) retains the role to test new and innovative measures.\n\nUniversal Foundation:\n\nAdult\n\nDomainMeasure Identification Number and NameWellness and prevention139: Colorectal cancer screening\n\n93: Breast cancer screening\n\n26: Adult immunization status Chronic conditions167: Controlling high blood pressure\n\n204: Hemoglobin A1c poor control (>9%)Behavioral health672: Screening for depression and follow-up plan\n\n394: Initiation and engagement of substance use disorder treatmentSeamless care coordination561 or 44: Plan all-cause readmissions or all-cause hospital readmissionsPerson-centered care158 (varies by program): Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems overall rating measures (CAHPS)Equity Identification number undetermined: Screening for social drivers of health\n\nPediatric\n\nDomain Measure Identification Number and NameWellness and prevention761 and 123: Well-child visits (well-child visits in the first 30 months of life; child and adolescent well-care visits)\n\n124 and 363: Immunization (childhood immunization status; immunizations for adolescents)\n\n760: Weight assessment and counseling for nutrition and physical activity for children and adolescents\n\n897: Oral evaluation, dental servicesChronic conditions80: Asthma medication ratio (reflects appropriate medication management of asthma) Behavioral health672: Screening for depression and follow-up plan\n\n268: Follow-up after hospitalization for mental illness\n\n264: Follow-up after emergency department visit for substance use\n\n743: Use of first-line psychosocial care for children and adolescents on antipsychotics\n\n271: Follow-up care for children prescribed attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder medicine Person-centered care158 (varies by program): Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems overall rating measures (CAHPS)\n\nAdd-ons:\n\nTo assess care provided to specific populations and settings (es. Hospital-based care or maternity care) additional measures beyond those captured in the Adult and Pediatric Universal Foundation are necessary. As with the Adult and Pediatric Universal Foundation measures, CMS will identify add-on measures to be implemented consistently across applicable programs. However, a particular measure may be essential to assess care, but only be appropriate for one program. CMS will continue developing more add-on sets in 2024, including one for behavioral health.\n\nHospital\n\nDomainMeasure Identification Number and NameChronic Conditions Equity696: Hybrid Hospital-Wide (All-Condition, All-Procedure) Risk-Standardized Mortality Measure\n\n1664: Screening for Social Drivers of HealthPerson-Centered Care338: Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey\n\n162: Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery CAHPS Survey\n\nSafety460: National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) Outcome Measure\n\n459: NHSN Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) Outcome Measure\n\n463: NHSN Facility-Wide Inpatient Hospital-onset Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Bacteremia Outcome Measure\n\n1: NHSN Surgical Site Infection (SSI)\n\n462: NHSN Facility-wide Inpatient Hospital-onset Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) Outcome Measure\n\n135: Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) 90\n\n678: Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Management Bundle\n\n1633: Severe Obstetric ComplicationsSeamless care coordination356: Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Readmission\n\n427: Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients\n\nPost-acute Care\n\nDomainMeasure Identification Number and NameBehavioral Health522: Percent of Residents Who Have Symptoms of Depression (Long Stay)\n\nPerson-Centered Care1698: Discharge Function Score\n\n154: Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Hospice SurveySafety225: Drug Regimen Review Conducted with Follow-Up for Identified Issues-PAC\n\n520: Percent of Residents Experiencing One or More Falls with Major Injury (Long-Stay)\n\n680: Skilled Nursing Facility Healthcare-Associated Infections (SNF HAI) Requiring Hospitalization\n\n121: Changes in Skin Integrity Post-Acute Care: Pressure Ulcer/Injury\n\n471: Number of Hospitalizations per 1,000 Long Stay Resident DaySeamless care coordination575: Potentially Preventable 30-Day Post-Discharge Readmission Measure\n\n210: Discharge to Community-Post Acute Care (PAC)\n\n728: Transfer of Health Information to the Provider Post-Acute Care (PAC)\n\n727: Transfer of Health Information to the Patient Post-Acute Care (PAC)\n\nMaternity Care\n\nDomainMeasure Identification Number and NameSafety418: Maternal Morbidity Structural Measure\n\n1633: Severe Obstetric Complications (eCQM)\n\n508: Cesarean Birth (LRCD-CH/ eCQM)Wellness and Prevention581: Prenatal and Postpartum Care: Postpartum Care (PPC-AD)\n\n582: Prenatal and Postpartum Care: Timeliness of Prenatal Care (PPC-CH)\n\nThe Universal Foundation: Next Steps\n\nThe Universal Foundation will continue to evolve over time:\n\nCMS will develop setting- and population-specific “add-on” measure sets\n\nMeasures may be replaced or removed when goals are met\n\nMeasures may be added to assess quality across the care journey\n\nCMMI will continue to test new and innovative measures\n\nCMS will solicit feedback on the Universal Foundation through comments, rulemaking, listening sessions, or other forums.\n\nTo learn more the impact and next steps of the Universal Foundation, read ‘Aligning Quality Measures Across CMS -the Universal Foundation’ in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSend feedback to QualityStrategy@cms.hhs.gov."
