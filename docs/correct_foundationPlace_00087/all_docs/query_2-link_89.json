        "text": "In South Africa's agriculture sector, in which women typically account for only sixteen percent of management roles, an innovative IFC project is helping to change this by training women to improve their leadership skills and equipping them to thrive.\n\nThe new scorecard provides an overarching view of the results indicators of the four institutions that make up the World Bank Group, IDA, IBRD, IFC and MIGA. The scorecard tracks progress toward the Group's broader vision to create a world free of poverty on a livable planet.\n\nCelebrated for her award-winning books and impactful talks, in this episode Chimamanda and host Makhtar Diop delve into gender dynamics in African societies, the influence of colonial histories on women's narratives, and the crucial work of reframing African stories.\n\nA strong and engaged private sector is indispensible to ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. That's where IFC comes in - we have more than 60 years experience in unlocking private investment, creating markets and opportunities where they are needed most.\n\nWe provide investment, advice, and asset management — offerings that are mutually reinforcing and can be tailored to a client’s specific needs.\n\nWe apply our financial resources, technical expertise, global experience, and innovative thinking to help our partners overcome financial, operational, and other challenges.\n\nIFC works with clients to create the opportunities which help the private sector mobilize solutions and finance to solve development challenges.\n\nIFC - a member of the World Bank Group - is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries.\n\nWe leverage the power of the private sector and share expertise to transform ideas into investments for green growth, inclusive jobs and impactful projects."
