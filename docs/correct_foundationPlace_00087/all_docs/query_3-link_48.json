        "text": "What is body mass index (BMI)?\n\nBody mass index (BMI) is calculated from your weight and height.\n\nBMI is calculated by dividing your weight by the square of your height as follows:\n\nBMI = Weight in kilos/Height in metres x Height in metres\n\nYou can find your BMI using the healthdirect BMI calculator. The calculator can give you an idea of any health risks related to your BMI or waist circumference. It also offers information based on your personal results.\n\nOnce you know your BMI, you can find your weight classification.\n\nFor adults, the BMI ranges and classifications are:\n\nBMI under 18.5: underweight\n\nBMI between 18.5 and 24.9: healthy weight range\n\nBMI between 25.0 and 29.9: overweight\n\nBMI equal to 30.0 or above: obese\n\nYour BMI is a guide to tell you if you are the correct weight for your height. Your BMI can give an indication of your chance of developing weight-related disease such as diabetes.\n\nNEED TO LOSE WEIGHT? — Use the BMI Calculator to find out if your weight and waist size are in a healthy range.\n\nWhat are the limitations of BMI?\n\nBMI is not always accurate for assessing healthy weight in some people. It can’t tell what amount of weight is due to fat or muscle.\n\nBMI is less accurate in the following groups of people:\n\ncertain ethnic groups:\n\nPacific Islanders\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\n\nMaori people\n\nSouth Asian people\n\nChinese people\n\nJapanese people\n\nbody builders or weightlifters\n\nsome high-performance athletes\n\npregnant women\n\npeople with a physical disability\n\npeople under 18 years\n\nHow can I tell if my child is in a healthy weight range?\n\nYou should use the healthy weight calculator for children and teenagers to find out if your child is in a healthy weight range, but you should use it as a guide only. Speak with their doctor for advice on your child’s health.\n\nIn children and teenagers, maintaining a certain weight range for their age and sex is important for healthy development.\n\nWhy measure waist circumference?\n\nPeople carry fat in different parts of their bodies. Some people carry extra body fat around their middle. This is more of a health risk than carrying weight on your hips and thighs.\n\nWaist circumference is a better estimate of ‘visceral fat’. This is the dangerous internal fat that coats your organs.\n\nMeasuring visceral fat can give a more accurate predictor of some health conditions. These include:\n\ncardiovascular disease risk\n\nmetabolic syndrome\n\ntype 2 diabetes\n\nHow do I measure my waist circumference?\n\nTo find your level of risk, it’s important to measure your waist circumference accurately.\n\nPlace the tape measure directly on your skin. You should not wear more than one layer of light clothing.\n\nThe correct place to measure your waist is halfway between your lowest rib and the top of your hipbone. This is roughly in line with your belly button.\n\nBreathe out normally and measure.\n\nMake sure the tape is snug, without squeezing your skin.\n\nWaist circumference is less reliable in overweight and obese people.\n\nWaist circumference and disease risk\n\nThese are the waist circumference thresholds that indicate an increased risk of disease:\n\nIf you are a female:\n\nyour risk is increased if your waist measurement is 80 cm or more\n\nyour risk is greatly increased if your waist measurement is 88 cm or more\n\nIf you are a male:\n\nyour risk is increased if your waist measurement is 94 cm or more\n\nyour risk is greatly increased if your waist measurement is 102 cm or more\n\nLimitations of waist circumference\n\nThese waist circumference measurements only apply to adults. They don’t apply to:\n\nchildren\n\npregnant people\n\npeople with a medical condition where their abdomen (tummy) is very enlarged\n\npeople from certain non-European backgrounds\n\nThese groups may have a different body shape.\n\nWhat does being overweight or obese mean?\n\nOverweight and obesity are health conditions of excess weight. They often result from eating too much food and/or not doing enough physical activity.\n\nCertain medicines and medical conditions can also cause weight gain.\n\nBeing overweight or obese can cause many serious health problems.\n\nMore than 6 in 10 Australian adults are overweight or obese. That number is rising.\n\nWhat are the health risks of being overweight or obese?\n\nBeing overweight, especially being obese, can increase your risk of developing serious health problems, including:\n\ntype 2 diabetes\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\ncardiovascular disease\n\nsleep apnoea\n\nosteoarthritis\n\nsome cancers\n\nMany of these diseases can be prevented by having a healthy weight and a healthy lifestyle. This includes eating a well-balanced diet and doing regular physical activity.\n\nEven small amounts of weight loss (as little as 5%) can bring health benefits. These benefits can be a lower your risk of getting heart disease or type 2 diabetes.\n\nHow can I lose weight?\n\nProbably the most successful way for weight loss is to make a change to your lifestyle. Try to eat food that is healthier and do more physical activity like exercise.\n\nPsychological support can be important too.\n\nFor many people, reaching a ‘healthy’ weight is unrealistic. A weight loss of 5% (which means losing 5 kg if you currently weigh 100 kg) is more achievable. It will still result in important health improvements.\n\nYour goals should focus on behaviour change and improved health, not weight loss.\n\nSome people may need a more intensive approach. This can mean having a very low energy diet or taking weight loss medicine.\n\nSome people may need bariatric surgery. This is especially likely in those who are obese or have other risk factors. It might be needed for people who haven’t been able to reduce their weight by changing their lifestyle.\n\nHow can I reduce my risk of disease?\n\nWaist circumference and BMI are important indicators of risk. However, many other factors also contribute to disease.\n\nThere are several other ways to improve your health, including:\n\nquitting smoking\n\nIncreasing your physical activity\n\nimproving your diet\n\nreducing your alcohol intake\n\ntreating other risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol\n\nensuring you get enough sleep\n\nRemember, increased physical activity and improved diet will help reduce your risk of disease. You may also have health benefits that are not directly related to weight loss."
