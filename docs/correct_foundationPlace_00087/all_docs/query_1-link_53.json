It simplifies the way to verify the identity of users based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server and to obtain user profile information in an interoperable and REST-like manner.\n\nOpenID Connect enables application and website developers to launch sign-in flows and receive verifiable assertions about users across Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients. And the specification suite is extensible to support a range of optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session logout.\n\nFor developers, it provides a secure and verifiable answer to the question “What is the identity of the person currently using the browser or mobile app that is connected?” Best of all, it removes the responsibility of setting, storing, and managing passwords which is frequently associated with credential-based data breaches."
