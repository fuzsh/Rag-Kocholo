        "text": "A nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize may be submitted by any person who meets the nomination criteria. A letter of invitation to submit is not required. The names of the nominees and other information about the nominations cannot be revealed until 50 years later.\n\nNominations for the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nThe deadline for nominating candidates for the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize expired on 31 January. The Norwegian Nobel Institute has registered a total of 285 candidates for this year’s peace prize, of which 196 are individuals and 89 are organisations. For comparison, the Nobel Institute received 351 valid nominations last year, distributed among 259 individuals and 92 organisations. The highest number ever was received in 2016, and was 376 candidates.\n\nFrom the statutes of the Nobel Foundation:\n\nProposals received for the award of a prize, and investigations and opinions concerning the award of a prize, may not be divulged. A prize-awarding body may, however, after due consideration in each individual case, permit access to material which formed the basis for the evaluation and decision concerning a prize, for purposes of research in intellectual history. Such permission may not, however, be granted until at least 50 years have elapsed after the date on which the decision in question was made.\n\nProcess of nomination and selection\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the Nobel Peace Prize laureates. A nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize may be submitted by any persons who are qualified to nominate.\n\nQualified nominators\n\nA nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is only considered valid if submitted by a person who meets certain criteria.\n\nAccording to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is considered valid if it is submitted by a person who falls within one of the following categories, a personal application for an award will not be considered:\n\nMembers of national assemblies and national governments (cabinet members/ministers) of sovereign states as well as current heads of state\n\nMembers of The International Court of Justice in The Hague and The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague\n\nMembers of l’Institut de Droit International\n\nMembers of the International Board of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom\n\nUniversity professors, professors emeriti and associate professors of history, social sciences, law, philosophy, theology, and religion; university rectors and university directors (or their equivalents); directors of peace research institutes and foreign policy institutes\n\nPersons who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nMembers of the main board of directors or its equivalent of organizations that have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nCurrent and former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee (proposals by current members of the Committee to be submitted no later than at the first meeting of the Committee after 1 February)\n\nFormer advisers to the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nUnless otherwise stated the term ‘members’ shall be understood as current (sitting) members.\n\nRevised in April 2018\n\nIf you belong to a group of qualified nominators, you may use the online nomination form to submit your nomination.\n\nCandidacy criteria\n\nThe candidates eligible for the Nobel Peace Prize are those persons or organisations nominated by qualified individuals, see above. A nomination for yourself will not be taken into consideration.\n\nSelection of Nobel Prize laureates\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of eligible candidates and the choice of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway, not in Stockholm, Sweden, where the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and the prize in economic sciences are awarded.\n\nHow are the Nobel Prize laureates selected?\n\nBelow is a brief description of the process involved in selecting the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.\n\nSeptember – The Norwegian Nobel Committee prepares to receive nominations. These nominations will be submitted by members of national assemblies, governments, and international courts of law; university chancellors, professors of social science, history, philosophy, law and theology; leaders of peace research institutes and institutes of foreign affairs; previous Nobel Peace Prize laureates; board members of organisations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize; present and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee; and former advisers of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.\n\nFebruary – Deadline for submission. In order to be considered for the award of the year, nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize shall be sent in to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo before the 1st day of February the same year. Nominations postmarked and received after this date are included in the following year’s discussions. In recent years, the Committee has received close to 200 different nominations for different nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. The number of nominating letters is much higher, as many are for the same candidates.\n\nFebruary-March – Short list. The Committee assesses the candidates’ work and prepares a short list.\n\nMarch-August – Adviser review.\n\nOctober – Nobel Prize laureates are chosen. At the beginning of October, the Nobel Committee chooses the Nobel Peace Prize laureates through a majority vote. The decision is final and without appeal. The names of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates are then announced.\n\nDecember – Nobel Prize laureates receive their prize. The Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony takes place on 10 December in Oslo, Norway, where the laureates receive their Nobel Prize, which consists of a Nobel Prize medal and diploma, and a document confirming the prize amount.\n\nAre the nominations made public?\n\nThe statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations, whether publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well as investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize.\n\nSubmission\n\nSubmission of nominations\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee has launched an on-line nomination form that you can use if you are a qualified nominator (see the list ‘Qualified nominators’) above). The form can be reached from the website of the Norwegian Nobel Committee between September and February.\n\nDeadline for nominations\n\nNomination deadline is 31 January at 12 midnight CET. Nominations which do not meet the deadline are normally included in the following year’s assessment. Members of the Nobel Committee are entitled to submit their own nominations as late as at the first meeting of the Committee after the expiry of the deadline.\n\nSelection process\n\nAt the first meeting of the Nobel Committee after the February 1 deadline for nominations, the Committee’s Permanent Secretary presents the list of the year’s candidates. The Committee may on that occasion add further names to the list, after which the nomination process is closed, and discussion of the particular candidates begins. In the light of this first review, the Committee draws up the so-called short list – i.e. the list of candidates selected for more thorough consideration. The short list typically contains from twenty to thirty candidates.\n\nThe candidates on the short list are then considered by the Nobel Institute’s permanent advisers. In addition to the Institute’s Director and Research Director, the body of advisers generally consists of a small group of Norwegian university professors with broad expertise in subject areas with a bearing on the Peace Prize. The advisers usually have a couple of months in which to draw up their reports. Reports are also occasionally requested from other Norwegian and foreign experts.\n\nWhen the advisers’ reports have been presented, the Nobel Committee embarks on a thorough-going discussion of the most likely candidates. In the process, the need often arises to obtain additional information and updates about candidates from additional experts, often foreign. As a rule, the Committee reaches a decision only at its very last meeting before the announcement of the Prize at the beginning of October.\n\nThe Committee seeks to achieve unanimity in its selection of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. On the rare occasions when this proves impossible, the selection is decided by a simple majority vote.\n\n50 year secrecy rule\n\nThe Committee does not itself announce the names of nominees, neither to the media nor to the candidates themselves. In so far as certain names crop up in the advance speculations as to who will be awarded any given year’s prize, this is either sheer guesswork or information put out by the person or persons behind the nomination. Information in the Nobel Committee’s nomination database is not made public until after fifty years.\n\nQuestions and answers about the nomination process for a Nobel Peace Prize\n\nSearch the nomination archive\n\nRead more about how the Nobel Prize laureates are nominated:"
